Longevity -- Modifications not necessarily simultaneous -- Modifications
apparently of no direct service -- Progressive development -- Characters of
small functional importance, the most constant -- Supposed incompetence of
natural selection to account for the incipient stages of useful structures
-- Causes which interfere with the acquisition through natural selection of
useful structures -- Gradations of structure with changed functions --
Widely different organs in members of the same class, developed from one
and the same source -- Reasons for disbelieving in great and abrupt
modifications.
<P>
I will devote this chapter to the consideration of various miscellaneous
objections which have been advanced against my views, as some of the
previous discussions may thus be made clearer; but it would be useless to
discuss all of them, as many have been made by writers who have not taken
the trouble to understand the subject.  Thus a distinguished German
naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I
consider all organic beings as imperfect:  what I have really said is, that
all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their
conditions; and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms in
many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding
foreigners.  Nor can organic beings, even if they were at any one time
perfectly adapted to their conditions of life, have remained so, when their
conditions changed, unless they themselves likewise changed; and no one
will dispute that the physical conditions of each country, as well as the
number and kinds of its inhabitants, have undergone many mutations.
<P>
A critic has lately insisted, with some parade of mathematical accuracy,
that longevity is a great advantage to all species, so that he who believes
in natural selection "must arrange his genealogical tree" in such a manner
that all the descendants have longer lives than their progenitors!  Cannot
our critics conceive that a biennial plant or one of the lower animals
might range into a cold climate and perish there every winter; and yet,
owing to advantages gained through natural selection, survive from year to
year by means of its seeds or ova?  Mr. E. Ray Lankester has recently
discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far as its extreme complexity
allows him to form a judgment, that longevity is generally related to the
standard of each species in the scale of organisation, as well as to the
amount of expenditure in reproduction and in general activity.  And these
conditions have, it is probable, been largely determined through natural
selection.
<P>
It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt, of
which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four thousand
years, so probably have none in any part of the world.  But, as Mr. G.H.
Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much, for the ancient
domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or embalmed, are closely
similar or even identical with those now living; yet all naturalists admit
that such races have been produced through the modification of their
original types.  The many animals which have remained unchanged since the
commencement of the glacial period, would have been an incomparably
stronger case, for these have been exposed to great changes of climate and
have migrated over great distances; whereas, in Egypt, during the last
several thousand years, the conditions of life, as far as we know, have
remained absolutely uniform.  The fact of little or no modification having
been effected since the glacial period, would have been of some avail
against those who believe in an innate and necessary law of development,
but is powerless against the doctrine of natural selection or the survival
of the fittest, which implies that when variations or individual
differences of a beneficial nature happen to arise, these will be
preserved; but this will be effected only under certain favourable
circumstances.
<P>
The celebrated palaeontologist, Bronn, at the close of his German
translation of this work, asks how, on the principle of natural selection,
can a variety live side by side with the parent species?  If both have
become fitted for slightly different habits of life or conditions, they
might live together; and if we lay on one side polymorphic species, in
which the variability seems to be of a peculiar nature, and all mere
temporary variations, such as size, albinism, etc., the more permanent
varieties are generally found, as far as I can discover, inhabiting
distinct stations, such as high land or low land, dry or moist districts. 
Moreover, in the case of animals which wander much about and cross freely,
their varieties seem to be generally confined to distinct regions.
<P>
Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in
single characters, but in many parts; and he asks, how it always comes that
many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the same time
through variation and natural selection?  But there is no necessity for
supposing that all the parts of any being have been simultaneously
modified.  The most striking modifications, excellently adapted for some
purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired by successive
variations, if slight, first in one part and then in another; and as they
would be transmitted all together, they would appear to us as if they had
been simultaneously developed.  The best answer, however, to the above
objection is afforded by those domestic races which have been modified,
chiefly through man's power of selection, for some special purpose.  Look
at the race and dray-horse, or at the greyhound and mastiff.  Their whole
frames, and even their mental characteristics, have been modified; but if
we could trace each step in the history of their transformation--and the
latter steps can be traced--we should not see great and simultaneous
changes, but first one part and then another slightly modified and
improved.  Even when selection has been applied by man to some one
character alone--of which our cultivated plants offer the best instances--
it will invariably be found that although this one part, whether it be the
flower, fruit, or leaves, has been greatly changed, almost all the other
parts have been slightly modified.  This may be attributed partly to the
principle of correlated growth, and partly to so-called spontaneous
variation.
<P>
A much more serious objection has been urged by Bronn, and recently by
Broca, namely, that many characters appear to be of no service whatever to
their possessors, and therefore cannot have been influenced through natural
selection.  Bronn adduces the length of the ears and tails in the different
species of hares and mice--the complex folds of enamel in the teeth of many
animals, and a multitude of analogous cases.  With respect to plants, this
subject has been discussed by Nageli in an admirable essay.  He admits that
natural selection has effected much, but he insists that the families of
plants differ chiefly from each other in morphological characters, which
appear to be quite unimportant for the welfare of the species.  He
consequently believes in an innate tendency towards progressive and more
perfect development.  He specifies the arrangement of the cells in the
tissues, and of the leaves on the axis, as cases in which natural selection
could not have acted.  To these may be added the numerical divisions in the
parts of the flower, the position of the ovules, the shape of the seed,
when not of any use for dissemination, etc.
<P>
There is much force in the above objection.  Nevertheless, we ought, in the
first place, to be extremely cautious in pretending to decide what
structures now are, or have formerly been, of use to each species.  In the
second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part is
modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes, such
as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual pressure,
an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed, and so forth
--as well as through other causes which lead to the many mysterious cases
of correlation, which we do not in the least understand.  These agencies
may be all grouped together, for the sake of brevity, under the expression
of the laws of growth.  In the third place, we have to allow for the direct
and definite action of changed conditions of life, and for so-called
spontaneous variations, in which the nature of the conditions apparently
plays a quite subordinate part.  Bud-variations, such as the appearance of
a moss-rose on a common rose, or of a nectarine on a peach-tree, offer good
instances of spontaneous variations; but even in these cases, if we bear in
mind the power of a minute drop of poison in producing complex galls, we
ought not to feel too sure that the above variations are not the effect of
some local change in the nature of the sap, due to some change in the
conditions.  There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual
difference, as well as for more strongly marked variations which
occasionally arise; and if the unknown cause were to act persistently, it
is almost certain that all the individuals of the species would be
similarly modified.
<P>
In the earlier editions of this work I underrated, as it now seems
probable, the frequency and importance of modifications due to spontaneous
variability.  But it is impossible to attribute to this cause the
innumerable structures which are so well adapted to the habits of life of
each species.  I can no more believe in this than that the well-adapted
form of a race-horse or greyhound, which before the principle of selection
by man was well understood, excited so much surprise in the minds of the
older naturalists, can thus be explained.
<P>
It may be worth while to illustrate some of the foregoing remarks.  With
respect to the assumed inutility of various parts and organs, it is hardly
necessary to observe that even in the higher and best-known animals many
structures exist, which are so highly developed that no one doubts that
they are of importance, yet their use has not been, or has only recently
been, ascertained.  As Bronn gives the length of the ears and tail in the
several species of mice as instances, though trifling ones, of differences
in structure which can be of no special use, I may mention that, according
to Dr. Schobl, the external ears of the common mouse are supplied in an
extraordinary manner with nerves, so that they no doubt serve as tactile
organs; hence the length of the ears can hardly be quite unimportant.  We
shall, also, presently see that the tail is a highly useful prehensile
organ to some of the species; and its use would be much influence by its
length.
<P>
With respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I shall
confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the
flowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures, which a
few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological differences
without any special function; but they are now known to be of the highest
importance for the fertilisation of the species through the aid of insects,
and have probably been gained through natural selection.  No one until
lately would have imagined that in dimorphic and trimorphic plants the
different lengths of the stamens and pistils, and their arrangement, could
have been of any service, but now we know this to be the case.
<P>
In certain whole groups of plants the ovules stand erect, and in others
they are suspended; and within the same ovarium of some few plants, one
ovule holds the former and a second ovule the latter position.  These
positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological
signification; but Dr. Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium the
upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones alone are
fertilised; and he suggests that this probably depends on the direction in
which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium.  If so, the position of the
ovules, even when one is erect and the other suspended within the same
ovarium, would follow the selection of any slight deviations in position
which favoured their fertilisation, and the production of seed.
<P>
Several plants belonging to distinct orders habitually produce flowers of
two kinds--the one open, of the ordinary structure, the other closed and
imperfect.  These two kinds of flowers sometimes differ wonderfully in
structure, yet may be seen to graduate into each other on the same plant. 
The ordinary and open flowers can be intercrossed; and the benefits which
certainly are derived from this process are thus secured.  The closed and
imperfect flowers are, however, manifestly of high importance, as they
yield with the utmost safety a large stock of seed, with the expenditure of
wonderfully little pollen.  The two kinds of flowers often differ much, as
just stated, in structure.  The petals in the imperfect flowers almost
always consist of mere rudiments, and the pollen-grains are reduced in
diameter.  In Ononis columnae five of the alternate stamens are
rudimentary; and in some species of Viola three stamens are in this state,
two retaining their proper function, but being of very small size.  In six
out of thirty of the closed flowers in an Indian violet (name unknown, for
the plants have never produced with me perfect flowers), the sepals are
reduced from the normal number of five to three.  In one section of the
Malpighiaceae the closed flowers, according to A. de Jussieu, are still
further modified, for the five stamens which stand opposite to the sepals
are all aborted, a sixth stamen standing opposite to a petal being alone
developed; and this stamen is not present in the ordinary flowers of this
species; the style is aborted; and the ovaria are reduced from three to
two.  Now although natural selection may well have had the power to prevent
some of the flowers from expanding, and to reduce the amount of pollen,
when rendered by the closure of the flowers superfluous, yet hardly any of
the above special modifications can have been thus determined, but must
have followed from the laws of growth, including the functional inactivity
of parts, during the progress of the reduction of the pollen and the
closure of the flowers.
<P>
It is so necessary to appreciate the important effects of the laws of
growth, that I will give some additional cases of another kind, namely of
differences in the same part or organ, due to differences in relative
position on the same plant.  In the Spanish chestnut, and in certain fir-
trees, the angles of divergence of the leaves differ, according to Schacht,
in the nearly horizontal and in the upright branches.  In the common rue
and some other plants, one flower, usually the central or terminal one,
opens first, and has five sepals and petals, and five divisions to the
ovarium; while all the other flowers on the plant are tetramerous.  In the
British Adoxa the uppermost flower generally has two calyx-lobes with the
other organs tetramerous, while the surrounding flowers generally have
three calyx-lobes with the other organs pentamerous.  In many Compositae
and Umbelliferae (and in some other plants) the circumferential flowers
have their corollas much more developed than those of the centre; and this
seems often connected with the abortion of the reproductive organs.  It is
a more curious fact, previously referred to, that the achenes or seeds of
the circumference and centre sometimes differ greatly in form, colour and
other characters.  In Carthamus and some other Compositae the central
achenes alone are furnished with a pappus; and in Hyoseris the same head
yields achenes of three different forms.  In certain Umbelliferae the
exterior seeds, according to Tausch, are orthospermous, and the central one
coelospermous, and this is a character which was considered by De Candolle
to be in other species of the highest systematic importance.  Professor
Braun mentions a Fumariaceous genus, in which the flowers in the lower part
of the spike bear oval, ribbed, one-seeded nutlets; and in the upper part
of the spike, lanceolate, two-valved and two-seeded siliques.  In these
several cases, with the exception of that of the well-developed ray-
florets, which are of service in making the flowers conspicuous to insects,
natural selection cannot, as far as we can judge, have come into play, or
only in a quite subordinate manner.  All these modifications follow from
the relative position and inter-action of the parts; and it can hardly be
doubted that if all the flowers and leaves on the same plant had been
subjected to the same external and internal condition, as are the flowers
and leaves in certain positions, all would have been modified in the same
manner.
<P>
In numerous other cases we find modifications of structure, which are
considered by botanists to be generally of a highly important nature,
affecting only some of the flowers on the same plant, or occurring on
distinct plants, which grow close together under the same conditions.  As
these variations seem of no special use to the plants, they cannot have
been influenced by natural selection.  Of their cause we are quite
ignorant; we cannot even attribute them, as in the last class of cases, to
any proximate agency, such as relative position.  I will give only a few
instances.  It is so common to observe on the same plant, flowers
indifferently tetramerous, pentamerous, etc., that I need not give
examples; but as numerical variations are comparatively rare when the parts
are few, I may mention that, according to De Candolle, the flowers of
Papaver bracteatum offer either two sepals with four petals (which is the
common type with poppies), or three sepals with six petals.  The manner in
which the petals are folded in the bud is in most groups a very constant
morphological character; but Professor Asa Gray states that with some
species of Mimulus, the aestivation is almost as frequently that of the
Rhinanthideae as of the Antirrhinideae, to which latter tribe the genus
belongs.  Aug. St. Hilaire gives the following cases:  the genus
Zanthoxylon belongs to a division of the Rutaceae with a single ovary, but
in some species flowers may be found on the same plant, and even in the
same panicle, with either one or two ovaries.  In Helianthemum the capsule
has been described as unilocular or tri-locular; and in H. mutabile, "Une
lame PLUS OU MOINS LARGE, s'etend entre le pericarpe et le placenta."  In
the flowers of Saponaria officinalis Dr. Masters has observed instances of
both marginal and free central placentation.  Lastly, St. Hilaire found
towards the southern extreme of the range of Gomphia oleaeformis two forms
which he did not at first doubt were distinct species, but he subsequently
saw them growing on the same bush; and he then adds, "Voila donc dans un
meme individu des loges et un style qui se rattachent tantot a un axe
verticale et tantot a un gynobase."
<P>
We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be attributed
to the laws of growth and the inter-action of parts, independently of
natural selection.  But with respect to Nageli's doctrine of an innate
tendency towards perfection or progressive development, can it be said in
the case of these strongly pronounced variations, that the plants have been
caught in the act of progressing towards a higher state of development?  On
the contrary, I should infer from the mere fact of the parts in question
differing or varying greatly on the same plant, that such modifications
were of extremely small importance to the plants themselves, of whatever
importance they may generally be to us for our classifications.  The
acquisition of a useless part can hardly be said to raise an organism in
the natural scale; and in the case of the imperfect, closed flowers, above
described, if any new principle has to be invoked, it must be one of
retrogression rather than of progression; and so it must be with many
parasitic and degraded animals.  We are ignorant of the exciting cause of
the above specified modifications; but if the unknown cause were to act
almost uniformly for a length of time, we may infer that the result would
be almost uniform; and in this case all the individuals of the species
would be modified in the same manner.
<P>
&gt;From the fact of the above characters being unimportant for the welfare of
the species, any slight variations which occurred in them would not have
been accumulated and augmented through natural selection.  A structure
which has been developed through long-continued selection, when it ceases
to be of service to a species, generally becomes variable, as we see with
rudimentary organs; for it will no longer be regulated by this same power
of selection.  But when, from the nature of the organism and of the
conditions, modifications have been induced which are unimportant for the
welfare of the species, they may be, and apparently often have been,
transmitted in nearly the same state to numerous, otherwise modified,
descendants.  It cannot have been of much importance to the greater number
of mammals, birds, or reptiles, whether they were clothed with hair,
feathers or scales; yet hair has been transmitted to almost all mammals,
feathers to all birds, and scales to all true reptiles.  A structure,
whatever it may be, which is common to many allied forms, is ranked by us
as of high systematic importance, and consequently is often assumed to be
of high vital importance to the species.  Thus, as I am inclined to
believe, morphological differences, which we consider as important--such as
the arrangement of the leaves, the divisions of the flower or of the
ovarium, the position of the ovules, etc., first appeared in many cases as
fluctuating variations, which sooner or later became constant through the
nature of the organism and of the surrounding conditions, as well as
through the intercrossing of distinct individuals, but not through natural
selection; for as these morphological characters do not affect the welfare
of the species, any slight deviations in them could not have been governed
or accumulated through this latter agency.  It is a strange result which we
thus arrive at, namely, that characters of slight vital importance to the
species, are the most important to the systematist; but, as we shall
hereafter see when we treat of the genetic principle of classification,
this is by no means so paradoxical as it may at first appear.
<P>
Although we have no good evidence of the existence in organic beings of an
innate tendency towards progressive development, yet this necessarily
follows, as I have attempted to show in the fourth chapter, through the
continued action of natural selection.  For the best definition which has
ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree to which
the parts have been specialised or differentiated; and natural selection
tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled to perform
their functions more efficiently.
<P>
A distinguished zoologist, Mr. St. George Mivart, has recently collected
all the objections which have ever been advanced by myself and others
against the theory of natural selection, as propounded by Mr. Wallace and
myself, and has illustrated them with admirable art and force.  When thus
marshalled, they make a formidable array; and as it forms no part of Mr.
Mivart's plan to give the various facts and considerations opposed to his
conclusions, no slight effort of reason and memory is left to the reader,
who may wish to weigh the evidence on both sides.  When discussing special
cases, Mr. Mivart passes over the effects of the increased use and disuse
of parts, which I have always maintained to be highly important, and have
treated in my "Variation under Domestication" at greater length than, as I
believe, any other writer.  He likewise often assumes that I attribute
nothing to variation, independently of natural selection, whereas in the
work just referred to I have collected a greater number of well-established
cases than can be found in any other work known to me.  My judgment may not
be trustworthy, but after reading with care Mr. Mivart's book, and
comparing each section with what I have said on the same head, I never
before felt so strongly convinced of the general truth of the conclusions
here arrived at, subject, of course, in so intricate a subject, to much
partial error.
<P>
All Mr. Mivart's objections will be, or have been, considered in the
present volume.  The one new point which appears to have struck many
readers is, "That natural selection is incompetent to account for the
incipient stages of useful structures."  This subject is intimately
connected with that of the gradation of the characters, often accompanied
by a change of function, for instance, the conversion of a swim-bladder
into lungs, points which were discussed in the last chapter under two
headings.  Nevertheless, I will here consider in some detail several of the
cases advanced by Mr. Mivart, selecting those which are the most
illustrative, as want of space prevents me from considering all.
<P>
The giraffe, by its lofty stature, much elongated neck, fore legs, head and
tongue, has its whole frame beautifully adapted for browsing on the higher
branches of trees.  It can thus obtain food beyond the reach of the other
Ungulata or hoofed animals inhabiting the same country; and this must be a
great advantage to it during dearths.  The Niata cattle in South America
show us how small a difference in structure may make, during such periods,
a great difference in preserving an animal's life.  These cattle can browse
as well as others on grass, but from the projection of the lower jaw they
cannot, during the often recurrent droughts, browse on the twigs of trees,
reeds, etc., to which food the common cattle and horses are then driven; so
that at these times the Niatas perish, if not fed by their owners.  Before
coming to Mr. Mivart's objections, it may be well to explain once again how
natural selection will act in all ordinary cases.  Man has modified some of
his animals, without necessarily having attended to special points of
structure, by simply preserving and breeding from the fleetest individuals,
as with the race-horse and greyhound, or as with the game-cock, by breeding
from the victorious birds.  So under nature with the nascent giraffe, the
individuals which were the highest browsers and were able during dearths to
reach even an inch or two above the others, will often have been preserved;
for they will have roamed over the whole country in search of food.  That
the individuals of the same species often differ slightly in the relative
lengths of all their parts may be seen in many works of natural history, in
which careful measurements are given.  These slight proportional
differences, due to the laws of growth and variation, are not of the
slightest use or importance to most species.  But it will have been
otherwise with the nascent giraffe, considering its probable habits of
life; for those individuals which had some one part or several parts of
their bodies rather more elongated than usual, would generally have
survived.  These will have intercrossed and left offspring, either
inheriting the same bodily peculiarities, or with a tendency to vary again
in the same manner; while the individuals less favoured in the same
respects will have been the most liable to perish.
<P>
We here see that there is no need to separate single pairs, as man does,
when he methodically improves a breed:  natural selection will preserve and
thus separate all the superior individuals, allowing them freely to
intercross, and will destroy all the inferior individuals.  By this process
long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have called
unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most important
manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, it seems
to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped might be converted
into a giraffe.
<P>
To this conclusion Mr. Mivart brings forward two objections.  One is that
the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased supply
of food, and he considers it as "very problematical whether the
disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than
counterbalance the advantages."  But as the giraffe does actually exist in
large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the world,
taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as far as size
is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have existed there,
subjected as now to severe dearths.  Assuredly the being able to reach, at
each stage of increased size, to a supply of food, left untouched by the
other hoofed quadrupeds of the country, would have been of some advantage
to the nascent giraffe.  Nor must we overlook the fact, that increased bulk
would act as a protection against almost all beasts of prey excepting the
lion; and against this animal, its tall neck--and the taller the better--
would, as Mr. Chauncey Wright has remarked, serve as a watch-tower.  It is
from this cause, as Sir S. Baker remarks, that no animal is more difficult
to stalk than the giraffe.  This animal also uses its long neck as a means
of offence or defence, by violently swinging its head armed with stump-like
horns.  The preservation of each species can rarely be determined by any
one advantage, but by the union of all, great and small.
<P>
Mr. Mivart then asks (and this is his second objection), if natural
selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage, why
has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty stature,
besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel, guanaco and
macrauchenia?  Or, again, why has not any member of the group acquired a
long proboscis?  With respect to South Africa, which was formerly inhabited
by numerous herds of the giraffe, the answer is not difficult, and can best
be given by an illustration.  In every meadow in England, in which trees
grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or planed to an exact level by the
browsing of the horses or cattle; and what advantage would it be, for
instance, to sheep, if kept there, to acquire slightly longer necks?  In
every district some one kind of animal will almost certainly be able to
browse higher than the others; and it is almost equally certain that this
one kind alone could have its neck elongated for this purpose, through
natural selection and the effects of increased use.  In South Africa the
competition for browsing on the higher branches of the acacias and other
trees must be between giraffe and giraffe, and not with the other ungulate
animals.
<P>
Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this same
order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis, cannot be
distinctly answered; but it is as unreasonable to expect a distinct answer
to such a question as why some event in the history of mankind did not
occur in one country while it did in another.  We are ignorant with respect
to the conditions which determine the numbers and range of each species,
and we cannot even conjecture what changes of structure would be favourable
to its increase in some new country.  We can, however, see in a general
manner that various causes might have interfered with the development of a
long neck or proboscis.  To reach the foliage at a considerable height
(without climbing, for which hoofed animals are singularly ill-constructed)
implies greatly increased bulk of body; and we know that some areas support
singularly few large quadrupeds, for instance South America, though it is
so luxuriant, while South Africa abounds with them to an unparalleled
degree.  Why this should be so we do not know; nor why the later tertiary
periods should have been much more favourable for their existence than the
present time.  Whatever the causes may have been, we can see that certain
districts and times would have been much more favourable than others for
the development of so large a quadruped as the giraffe.
<P>
In order that an animal should acquire some structure specially and largely
developed, it is almost indispensable that several other parts should be
modified and coadapted.  Although every part of the body varies slightly,
it does not follow that the necessary parts should always vary in the right
direction and to the right degree.  With the different species of our
domesticated animals we know that the parts vary in a different manner and
degree, and that some species are much more variable than others.  Even if
the fitting variations did arise, it does not follow that natural selection
would be able to act on them and produce a structure which apparently would
be beneficial to the species.  For instance, if the number of individuals
existing in a country is determined chiefly through destruction by beasts
of prey--by external or internal parasites, etc.--as seems often to be the
case, then natural selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly
retarded, in modifying any particular structure for obtaining food. 
Lastly, natural selection is a slow process, and the same favourable
conditions must long endure in order that any marked effect should thus be
produced.  Except by assigning such general and vague reasons, we cannot
explain why, in many quarters of the world, hoofed quadrupeds have not
acquired much elongated necks or other means for browsing on the higher
branches of trees.
<P>
Objections of the same nature as the foregoing have been advanced by many
writers.  In each case various causes, besides the general ones just
indicated, have probably interfered with the acquisition through natural
selection of structures, which it is thought would be beneficial to certain
species.  One writer asks, why has not the ostrich acquired the power of
flight?  But a moment's reflection will show what an enormous supply of
food would be necessary to give to this bird of the desert force to move
its huge body through the air.  Oceanic islands are inhabited by bats and
seals, but by no terrestrial mammals; yet as some of these bats are
peculiar species, they must have long inhabited their present homes. 
Therefore Sir C. Lyell asks, and assigns certain reasons in answer, why
have not seals and bats given birth on such islands to forms fitted to live
on the land?  But seals would necessarily be first converted into
terrestrial carnivorous animals of considerable size, and bats into
terrestrial insectivorous animals; for the former there would be no prey;
for the bats ground-insects would serve as food, but these would already be
largely preyed on by the reptiles or birds, which first colonise and abound
on most oceanic islands.  Gradations of structure, with each stage
beneficial to a changing species, will be favoured only under certain
peculiar conditions.  A strictly terrestrial animal, by occasionally
hunting for food in shallow water, then in streams or lakes, might at last
be converted into an animal so thoroughly aquatic as to brave the open
ocean.  But seals would not find on oceanic islands the conditions
favourable to their gradual reconversion into a terrestrial form.  Bats, as
formerly shown, probably acquired their wings by at first gliding through
the air from tree to tree, like the so-called flying squirrels, for the
sake of escaping from their enemies, or for avoiding falls; but when the
power of true flight had once been acquired, it would never be reconverted
back, at least for the above purposes, into the less efficient power of
gliding through the air.  Bats, might, indeed, like many birds, have had
their wings greatly reduced in size, or completely lost, through disuse;
but in this case it would be necessary that they should first have acquired
the power of running quickly on the ground, by the aid of their hind legs
alone, so as to compete with birds or other ground animals; and for such a
change a bat seems singularly ill-fitted.  These conjectural remarks have
been made merely to show that a transition of structure, with each step
beneficial, is a highly complex affair; and that there is nothing strange
in a transition not having occurred in any particular case.
<P>
Lastly, more than one writer has asked why have some animals had their
mental powers more highly developed than others, as such development would
be advantageous to all?  Why have not apes acquired the intellectual powers
of man?  Various causes could be assigned; but as they are conjectural, and
their relative probability cannot be weighed, it would be useless to give
them.  A definite answer to the latter question ought not to be expected,
seeing that no one can solve the simpler problem, why, of two races of
savages, one has risen higher in the scale of civilisation than the other;
and this apparently implies increased brain power.
<P>
We will return to Mr. Mivart's other objections.  Insects often resemble
for the sake of protection various objects, such as green or decayed
leaves, dead twigs, bits of lichen, flowers, spines, excrement of birds,
and living insects; but to this latter point I shall hereafter recur.  The
resemblance is often wonderfully close, and is not confined to colour, but
extends to form, and even to the manner in which the insects hold
themselves.  The caterpillars which project motionless like dead twigs from
the bushes on which they feed, offer an excellent instance of a resemblance
of this kind.  The cases of the imitation of such objects as the excrement
of birds, are rare and exceptional.  On this head, Mr. Mivart remarks, "As,
according to Mr. Darwin's theory, there is a constant tendency to
indefinite variation, and as the minute incipient variations will be in ALL
DIRECTIONS, they must tend to neutralize each other, and at first to form
such unstable modifications that it is difficult, if not impossible, to see
how such indefinite oscillations of infinitesimal beginnings can ever build
up a sufficiently appreciable resemblance to a leaf, bamboo, or other
object, for natural selection to seize upon and perpetuate."
<P>
But in all the foregoing cases the insects in their original state no doubt
presented some rude and accidental resemblance to an object commonly found
in the stations frequented by them.  Nor is this at all improbable,
considering the almost infinite number of surrounding objects and the
diversity in form and colour of the hosts of insects which exist.  As some
rude resemblance is necessary for the first start, we can understand how it
is that the larger and higher animals do not (with the exception, as far as
I know, of one fish) resemble for the sake of protection special objects,
but only the surface which commonly surrounds them, and this chiefly in
colour.  Assuming that an insect originally happened to resemble in some
degree a dead twig or a decayed leaf, and that it varied slightly in many
ways, then all the variations which rendered the insect at all more like
any such object, and thus favoured its escape, would be preserved, while
other variations would be neglected and ultimately lost; or, if they
rendered the insect at all less like the imitated object, they would be
eliminated.  There would indeed be force in Mr. Mivart's objection, if we
were to attempt to account for the above resemblances, independently of
natural selection, through mere fluctuating variability; but as the case
stands there is none.
<P>
Nor can I see any force in Mr. Mivart's difficulty with respect to "the
last touches of perfection in the mimicry;" as in the case given by Mr.
Wallace, of a walking-stick insect (Ceroxylus laceratus), which resembles
"a stick grown over by a creeping moss or jungermannia."  So close was this
resemblance, that a native Dyak maintained that the foliaceous excrescences
were really moss.  Insects are preyed on by birds and other enemies whose
sight is probably sharper than ours, and every grade in resemblance which
aided an insect to escape notice or detection, would tend towards its
preservation; and the more perfect the resemblance so much the better for
the insect.  Considering the nature of the differences between the species
in the group which includes the above Ceroxylus, there is nothing
improbable in this insect having varied in the irregularities on its
surface, and in these having become more or less green-coloured; for in
every group the characters which differ in the several species are the most
apt to vary, while the generic characters, or those common to all the
species, are the most constant.
<P>
The Greenland whale is one of the most wonderful animals in the world, and
the baleen, or whalebone, one of its greatest peculiarities.  The baleen
consists of a row, on each side of the upper jaw, of about 300 plates or
laminae, which stand close together transversely to the longer axis of the
mouth.  Within the main row there are some subsidiary rows.  The
extremities and inner margins of all the plates are frayed into stiff
bristles, which clothe the whole gigantic palate, and serve to strain or
sift the water, and thus to secure the minute prey on which these great
animals subsist.  The middle and longest lamina in the Greenland whale is
ten, twelve, or even fifteen feet in length; but in the different species
of Cetaceans there are gradations in length; the middle lamina being in one
species, according to Scoresby, four feet, in another three, in another
eighteen inches, and in the Balaenoptera rostrata only about nine inches in
length.  The quality of the whalebone also differs in the different
species.
<P>
With respect to the baleen, Mr. Mivart remarks that if it "had once
attained such a size and development as to be at all useful, then its
preservation and augmentation within serviceable limits would be promoted
by natural selection alone.  But how to obtain the beginning of such useful
development?"  In answer, it may be asked, why should not the early
progenitors of the whales with baleen have possessed a mouth constructed
something like the lamellated beak of a duck?  Ducks, like whales, subsist
by sifting the mud and water; and the family has sometimes been called
Criblatores, or sifters.  I hope that I may not be misconstrued into saying
that the progenitors of whales did actually possess mouths lamellated like
the beak of a duck.  I wish only to show that this is not incredible, and
that the immense plates of baleen in the Greenland whale might have been
developed from such lamellae by finely graduated steps, each of service to
its possessor.
<P>
The beak of a shoveller-duck (Spatula clypeata) is a more beautiful and
complex structure than the mouth of a whale.  The upper mandible is
furnished on each side (in the specimen examined by me) with a row or comb
formed of 188 thin, elastic lamellae, obliquely bevelled so as to be
pointed, and placed transversely to the longer axis of the mouth.  They
arise from the palate, and are attached by flexible membrane to the sides
of the mandible.  Those standing towards the middle are the longest, being
about one-third of an inch in length, and they project fourteen one-
hundredths of an inch beneath the edge.  At their bases there is a short
subsidiary row of obliquely transverse lamellae.  In these several respects
they resemble the plates of baleen in the mouth of a whale.  But towards
the extremity of the beak they differ much, as they project inward, instead
of straight downward.  The entire head of the shoveller, though
incomparably less bulky, is about one-eighteenth of the length of the head
of a moderately large Balaenoptera rostrata, in which species the baleen is
only nine inches long; so that if we were to make the head of the shoveller
as long as that of the Balaenoptera, the lamellae would be six inches in
length, that is, two-thirds of the length of the baleen in this species of
whale.  The lower mandible of the shoveller-duck is furnished with lamellae
of equal length with these above, but finer; and in being thus furnished it
differs conspicuously from the lower jaw of a whale, which is destitute of
baleen.  On the other hand, the extremities of these lower lamellae are
frayed into fine bristly points, so that they thus curiously resemble the
plates of baleen.  In the genus Prion, a member of the distinct family of
the Petrels, the upper mandible alone is furnished with lamellae, which are
well developed and project beneath the margin; so that the beak of this
bird resembles in this respect the mouth of a whale.
<P>
&gt;From the highly developed structure of the shoveller's beak we may proceed
(as I have learned from information and specimens sent to me by Mr.
Salvin), without any great break, as far as fitness for sifting is
concerned, through the beak of the Merganetta armata, and in some respects
through that of the Aix sponsa, to the beak of the common duck.  In this
latter species the lamellae are much coarser than in the shoveller, and are
firmly attached to the sides of the mandible; they are only about fifty in
number on each side, and do not project at all beneath the margin.  They
are square-topped, and are edged with translucent, hardish tissue, as if
for crushing food.  The edges of the lower mandible are crossed by numerous
fine ridges, which project very little.  Although the beak is thus very
inferior as a sifter to that of a shoveller, yet this bird, as every one
knows, constantly uses it for this purpose.  There are other species, as I
hear from Mr. Salvin, in which the lamellae are considerably less developed
than in the common duck; but I do not know whether they use their beaks for
sifting the water.
<P>
Turning to another group of the same family.  In the Egyptian goose
(Chenalopex) the beak closely resembles that of the common duck; but the
lamellae are not so numerous, nor so distinct from each other, nor do they
project so much inward; yet this goose, as I am informed by Mr. E.
Bartlett, "uses its bill like a duck by throwing the water out at the
corners."  Its chief food, however, is grass, which it crops like the
common goose.  In this latter bird the lamellae of the upper mandible are
much coarser than in the common duck, almost confluent, about twenty-seven
in number on each side, and terminating upward in teeth-like knobs.  The
palate is also covered with hard rounded knobs.  The edges of the lower
mandible are serrated with teeth much more prominent, coarser and sharper
than in the duck.  The common goose does not sift the water, but uses its
beak exclusively for tearing or cutting herbage, for which purpose it is so
well fitted that it can crop grass closer than almost any other animal. 
There are other species of geese, as I hear from Mr. Bartlett, in which the
lamellae are less developed than in the common goose.
<P>
We thus see that a member of the duck family, with a beak constructed like
that of a common goose and adapted solely for grazing, or even a member
with a beak having less well-developed lamellae, might be converted by
small changes into a species like the Egyptian goose--this into one like
the common duck--and, lastly, into one like the shoveller, provided with a
beak almost exclusively adapted for sifting the water; for this bird could
hardly use any part of its beak, except the hooked tip, for seizing or
tearing solid food.  The beak of a goose, as I may add, might also be
converted by small changes into one provided with prominent, recurved
teeth, like those of the Merganser (a member of the same family), serving
for the widely different purpose of securing live fish.
<P>
Returning to the whales.  The Hyperoodon bidens is destitute of true teeth
in an efficient condition, but its palate is roughened, according to
Lacepede, with small unequal, hard points of horn.  There is, therefore,
nothing improbable in supposing that some early Cetacean form was provided
with similar points of horn on the palate, but rather more regularly
placed, and which, like the knobs on the beak of the goose, aided it in
seizing or tearing its food.  If so, it will hardly be denied that the
points might have been converted through variation and natural selection
into lamellae as well-developed as those of the Egyptian goose, in which
case they would have been used both for seizing objects and for sifting the
water; then into lamellae like those of the domestic duck; and so onward,
until they became as well constructed as those of the shoveller, in which
case they would have served exclusively as a sifting apparatus.  From this
stage, in which the lamellae would be two-thirds of the length of the
plates of baleen in the Balaenoptera rostrata, gradations, which may be
observed in still-existing Cetaceans, lead us onward to the enormous plates
of baleen in the Greenland whale.  Nor is there the least reason to doubt
that each step in this scale might have been as serviceable to certain
ancient Cetaceans, with the functions of the parts slowly changing during
the progress of development, as are the gradations in the beaks of the
different existing members of the duck-family.  We should bear in mind that
each species of duck is subjected to a severe struggle for existence, and
that the structure of every part of its frame must be well adapted to its
conditions of life.
<P>
The Pleuronectidae, or Flat-fish, are remarkable for their asymmetrical
bodies.  They rest on one side--in the greater number of species on the
left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult
specimens occur.  The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight
the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less
developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often of
smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for they
are both placed on the upper side of the head.  During early youth,
however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then
symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured.  Soon the eye proper to the
lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side; but
does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly thought to be the
case.  It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round, it
could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on one
side.  The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by the
sandy bottom.  That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by their
flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life, is manifest
from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc., being extremely
common.  The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection from their
enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground.  The different members,
however, of the family present, as Schiodte remarks, "a long series of
forms exhibiting a gradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does
not in any considerable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum,
to the soles, which are entirely thrown to one side."
<P>
Mr. Mivart has taken up this case, and remarks that a sudden spontaneous
transformation in the position of the eyes is hardly conceivable, in which
I quite agree with him.  He then adds:  "If the transit was gradual, then
how such transit of one eye a minute fraction of the journey towards the
other side of the head could benefit the individual is, indeed, far from
clear.  It seems, even, that such an incipient transformation must rather
have been injurious."  But he might have found an answer to this objection
in the excellent observations published in 1867 by Malm.  The
Pleuronectidae, while very young and still symmetrical, with their eyes
standing on opposite sides of the head, cannot long retain a vertical
position, owing to the excessive depth of their bodies, the small size of
their lateral fins, and to their being destitute of a swim-bladder.  Hence,
soon growing tired, they fall to the bottom on one side.  While thus at
rest they often twist, as Malm observed, the lower eye upward, to see above
them; and they do this so vigorously that the eye is pressed hard against
the upper part of the orbit.  The forehead between the eyes consequently
becomes, as could be plainly seen, temporarily contracted in breadth.  On
one occasion Malm saw a young fish raise and depress the lower eye through
an angular distance of about seventy degrees.
<P>
We should remember that the skull at this early age is cartilaginous and
flexible, so that it readily yields to muscular action.  It is also known
with the higher animals, even after early youth, that the skull yields and
is altered in shape, if the skin or muscles be permanently contracted
through disease or some accident.  With long-eared rabbits, if one ear
flops forward and downward, its weight drags forward all the bones of the
skull on the same side, of which I have given a figure.  Malm states that
the newly-hatched young of perches, salmon, and several other symmetrical
fishes, have the habit of occasionally resting on one side at the bottom;
and he has observed that they often then strain their lower eyes so as to
look upward; and their skulls are thus rendered rather crooked.  These
fishes, however, are soon able to hold themselves in a vertical position,
and no permanent effect is thus produced.  With the Pleuronectidae, on the
other hand, the older they grow the more habitually they rest on one side,
owing to the increasing flatness of their bodies, and a permanent effect is
thus produced on the form of the head, and on the position of the eyes. 
Judging from analogy, the tendency to distortion would no doubt be
increased through the principle of inheritance.  Schiodte believes, in
opposition to some other naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite
symmetrical even in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how
it is that certain species, while young, habitually fall over and rest on
the left side, and other species on the right side.  Malm adds, in
confirmation of the above view, that the adult Trachypterus arcticus, which
is not a member of the Pleuronectidae, rests on its left side at the
bottom, and swims diagonally through the water; and in this fish, the two
sides of the head are said to be somewhat dissimilar.  Our great authority
on Fishes, Dr. Gunther, concludes his abstract of Malm's paper, by
remarking that "the author gives a very simple explanation of the abnormal
condition of the Pleuronectoids."
<P>
We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one side
of the head to the other, which Mr. Mivart considers would be injurious,
may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the individual and
to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both eyes, while
resting on one side at the bottom.  We may also attribute to the inherited
effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds of flat-fish being
bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones stronger and more
effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than on the other, for the
sake, as Dr. Traquair supposes, of feeding with ease on the ground. 
Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less developed condition of
the whole inferior half of the body, including the lateral fins; though
Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these fins is advantageous to the
fish, as "there is so much less room for their action than with the larger
fins above."  Perhaps the lesser number of teeth in the proportion of four
to seven in the upper halves of the two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five
to thirty in the lower halves, may likewise be accounted for by disuse. 
&gt;From the colourless state of the ventral surface of most fishes and of many
other animals, we may reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in
flat-fish on the side, whether it be the right or left, which is under-
most, is due to the exclusion of light.  But it cannot be supposed that the
peculiar speckled appearance of the upper side of the sole, so like the
sandy bed of the sea, or the power in some species, as recently shown by
Pouchet, of changing their colour in accordance with the surrounding
surface, or the presence of bony tubercles on the upper side of the turbot,
are due to the action of the light.  Here natural selection has probably
come into play, as well as in adapting the general shape of the body of
these fishes, and many other peculiarities, to their habits of life.  We
should keep in mind, as I have before insisted, that the inherited effects
of the increased use of parts, and perhaps of their disuse, will be
strengthened by natural selection.  For all spontaneous variations in the
right direction will thus be preserved; as will those individuals which
inherit in the highest degree the effects of the increased and beneficial
use of any part.  How much to attribute in each particular case to the
effects of use, and how much to natural selection, it seems impossible to
decide.
<P>
I may give another instance of a structure which apparently owes its origin
exclusively to use or habit.  The extremity of the tail in some American
monkeys has been converted into a wonderfully perfect prehensile organ, and
serves as a fifth hand.  A reviewer, who agrees with Mr. Mivart in every
detail, remarks on this structure:  "It is impossible to believe that in
any number of ages the first slight incipient tendency to grasp could
preserve the lives of the individuals possessing it, or favour their chance
of having and of rearing offspring."  But there is no necessity for any
such belief.  Habit, and this almost implies that some benefit great or
small is thus derived, would in all probability suffice for the work. 
Brehm saw the young of an African monkey (Cercopithecus) clinging to the
under surface of their mother by their hands, and at the same time they
hooked their little tails round that of their mother.  Professor Henslow
kept in confinement some harvest mice (Mus messorius) which do not possess
a structurally prehensive tail; but he frequently observed that they curled
their tails round the branches of a bush placed in the cage, and thus aided
themselves in climbing.  I have received an analogous account from Dr.
Gunther, who has seen a mouse thus suspend itself.  If the harvest mouse
had been more strictly arboreal, it would perhaps have had its tail
rendered structurally prehensile, as is the case with some members of the
same order.  Why Cercopithecus, considering its habits while young, has not
become thus provided, it would be difficult to say.  It is, however,
possible that the long tail of this monkey may be of more service to it as
a balancing organ in making its prodigious leaps, than as a prehensile
organ.
<P>
The mammary glands are common to the whole class of mammals, and are
indispensable for their existence; they must, therefore, have been
developed at an extremely remote period, and we can know nothing positively
about their manner of development.  Mr. Mivart asks:  "Is it conceivable
that the young of any animal was ever saved from destruction by
accidentally sucking a drop of scarcely nutritious fluid from an
accidentally hypertrophied cutaneous gland of its mother?  And even if one
was so, what chance was there of the perpetuation of such a variation?" 
But the case is not here put fairly.  It is admitted by most evolutionists
that mammals are descended from a marsupial form; and if so, the mammary
glands will have been at first developed within the marsupial sack.  In the
case of the fish (Hippocampus) the eggs are hatched, and the young are
reared for a time, within a sack of this nature; and an American
naturalist, Mr. Lockwood, believes from what he has seen of the development
of the young, that they are nourished by a secretion from the cutaneous
glands of the sack.  Now, with the early progenitors of mammals, almost
before they deserved to be thus designated, is it not at least possible
that the young might have been similarly nourished?  And in this case, the
individuals which secreted a fluid, in some degree or manner the most
nutritious, so as to partake of the nature of milk, would in the long run
have reared a larger number of well-nourished offspring, than would the
individuals which secreted a poorer fluid; and thus the cutaneous glands,
which are the homologues of the mammary glands, would have been improved or
rendered more effective.  It accords with the widely extended principle of
specialisation, that the glands over a certain space of the sack should
have become more highly developed than the remainder; and they would then
have formed a breast, but at first without a nipple, as we see in the
Ornithorhyncus, at the base of the mammalian series.  Through what agency
the glands over a certain space became more highly specialised than the
others, I will not pretend to decide, whether in part through compensation
of growth, the effects of use, or of natural selection.
<P>
The development of the mammary glands would have been of no service, and
could not have been affected through natural selection, unless the young at
the same time were able to partake of the secretion.  There is no greater
difficulty in understanding how young mammals have instinctively learned to
suck the breast, than in understanding how unhatched chickens have learned
to break the egg-shell by tapping against it with their specially adapted
beaks; or how a few hours after leaving the shell they have learned to pick
up grains of food.  In such cases the most probable solution seems to be,
that the habit was at first acquired by practice at a more advanced age,
and afterwards transmitted to the offspring at an earlier age.  But the
young kangaroo is said not to suck, only to cling to the nipple of its
mother, who has the power of injecting milk into the mouth of her helpless,
half-formed offspring.  On this head Mr. Mivart remarks:  "Did no special
provision exist, the young one must infallibly be choked by the intrusion
of the milk into the wind-pipe.  But there IS a special provision.  The
larynx is so elongated that it rises up into the posterior end of the nasal
passage, and is thus enabled to give free entrance to the air for the
lungs, while the milk passes harmlessly on each side of this elongated
larynx, and so safely attains the gullet behind it."  Mr. Mivart then asks
how did natural selection remove in the adult kangaroo (and in most other
mammals, on the assumption that they are descended from a marsupial form),
"this at least perfectly innocent and harmless structure?"  It may be
suggested in answer that the voice, which is certainly of high importance
to many animals, could hardly have been used with full force as long as the
larynx entered the nasal passage; and Professor Flower has suggested to me
that this structure would have greatly interfered with an animal swallowing
solid food.
<P>
We will now turn for a short space to the lower divisions of the animal
kingdom.  The Echinodermata (star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.) are furnished
with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist, when well
developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of three
serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of a
flexible stem, moved by muscles.  These forceps can seize firmly hold of
any object; and Alexander Agassiz has seen an Echinus or sea-urchin rapidly
passing particles of excrement from forceps to forceps down certain lines
of its body, in order that its shell should not be fouled.  But there is no
doubt that besides removing dirt of all kinds, they subserve other
functions; and one of these apparently is defence.
<P>
With respect to these organs, Mr. Mivart, as on so many previous occasions,
asks:  "What would be the utility of the FIRST RUDIMENTARY BEGINNINGS of
such structures, and how could such insipient buddings have ever preserved
the life of a single Echinus?"  He adds, "not even the SUDDEN development
of the snapping action would have been beneficial without the freely
movable stalk, nor could the latter have been efficient without the
snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite variations could
simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of structure; to deny
this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling paradox."  Paradoxical
as this may appear to Mr. Mivart, tridactyle forcepses, immovably fixed at
the base, but capable of a snapping action, certainly exist on some star-
fishes; and this is intelligible if they serve, at least in part, as a
means of defence.  Mr. Agassiz, to whose great kindness I am indebted for
much information on the subject, informs me that there are other star-
fishes, in which one of the three arms of the forceps is reduced to a
support for the other two; and again, other genera in which the third arm
is completely lost.  In Echinoneus, the shell is described by M. Perrier as
bearing two kinds of pedicellariae, one resembling those of Echinus, and
the other those of Spatangus; and such cases are always interesting as
affording the means of apparently sudden transitions, through the abortion
of one of the two states of an organ.
<P>
With respect to the steps by which these curious organs have been evolved,
Mr. Agassiz infers from his own researches and those of Mr. Muller, that
both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae must undoubtedly be
looked at as modified spines.  This may be inferred from their manner of
development in the individual, as well as from a long and perfect series of
gradations in different species and genera, from simple granules to
ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariae.  The gradation
extends even to the manner in which ordinary spines and the pedicellariae,
with their supporting calcareous rods, are articulated to the shell.  In
certain genera of star-fishes, "the very combinations needed to show that
the pedicellariae are only modified branching spines" may be found.  Thus
we have fixed spines, with three equi-distant, serrated, movable branches,
articulated to near their bases; and higher up, on the same spine, three
other movable branches.  Now when the latter arise from the summit of a
spine they form, in fact, a rude tridactyle pedicellariae, and such may be
seen on the same spine together with the three lower branches.  In this
case the identity in nature between the arms of the pedicellariae and the
movable branches of a spine, is unmistakable.  It is generally admitted
that the ordinary spines serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no
reason to doubt that those furnished with serrated and movable branches
likewise serve for the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more
effectively as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or
snapping apparatus.  Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine to
a fixed pedicellariae, would be of service.
<P>
In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being fixed or
borne on an immovable support, are placed on the summit of a flexible and
muscular, though short, stem; and in this case they probably subserve some
additional function besides defence.  In the sea-urchins the steps can be
followed by which a fixed spine becomes articulated to the shell, and is
thus rendered movable.  I wish I had space here to give a fuller abstract
of Mr. Agassiz's interesting observations on the development of the
pedicellariae.  All possible gradations, as he adds, may likewise be found
between the pedicellariae of the star-fishes and the hooks of the
Ophiurians, another group of the Echinodermata; and again between the
pedicellariae of sea-urchins and the anchors of the Holothuriae, also
belonging to the same great class.
<P>
Certain compound animals, or zoophytes, as they have been termed, namely
the Polyzoa, are provided with curious organs called avicularia.  These
differ much in structure in the different species.  In their most perfect
condition they curiously resemble the head and beak of a vulture in
miniature, seated on a neck and capable of movement, as is likewise the
lower jaw or mandible.  In one species observed by me, all the avicularia
on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards, with
the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about 90 degrees, in the
course of five seconds; and their movement caused the whole polyzoary to
tremble.  When the jaws are touched with a needle they seize it so firmly
that the branch can thus be shaken.
<P>
Mr. Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed difficulty
of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the pedicellariae of
the Echinodermata, which he considers as "essentially similar," having been
developed through natural selection in widely distinct divisions of the
animal kingdom.  But, as far as structure is concerned, I can see no
similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae and avicularia.  The latter
resembles somewhat more closely the chelae or pincers of Crustaceans; and
Mr. Mivart might have adduced with equal appropriateness this resemblance
as a special difficulty, or even their resemblance to the head and beak of
a bird.  The avicularia are believed by Mr. Busk, Dr. Smitt and Dr.
Nitsche--naturalists who have carefully studied this group--to be
homologous with the zooids and their cells which compose the zoophyte, the
movable lip or lid of the cell corresponding with the lower and movable
mandible of the avicularium.  Mr. Busk, however, does not know of any
gradations now existing between a zooid and an avicularium.  It is
therefore impossible to conjecture by what serviceable gradations the one
could have been converted into the other, but it by no means follows from
this that such gradations have not existed.
<P>
As the chelae of Crustaceans resemble in some degree the avicularia of
Polyzoa, both serving as pincers, it may be worth while to show that with
the former a long series of serviceable gradations still exists.  In the
first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down either
on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against one whole
side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the limb still
serves as an organ of locomotion.  We next find one corner of the broad
penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished with irregular
teeth, and against these the terminal segment shuts down.  By an increase
in the size of this projection, with its shape, as well as that of the
terminal segment, slightly modified and improved, the pincers are rendered
more and more perfect, until we have at last an instrument as efficient as
the chelae of a lobster.  And all these gradations can be actually traced.
<P>
Besides the avicularia, the polyzoa possess curious organs called
vibracula.  These generally consist of long bristles, capable of movement
and easily excited.  In one species examined by me the vibracula were
slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on the
same polyzoary often moved simultaneously; so that, acting like long oars,
they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my microscope.  When
a branch was placed on its face, the vibracula became entangled, and they
made violent efforts to free themselves.  They are supposed to serve as a
defence, and may be seen, as Mr. Busk remarks, "to sweep slowly and
carefully over the surface of the polyzoary, removing what might be noxious
to the delicate inhabitants of the cells when their tentacula are
protruded."  The avicularia, like the vibracula, probably serve for
defence, but they also catch and kill small living animals, which, it is
believed, are afterwards swept by the currents within reach of the
tentacula of the zooids.  Some species are provided with avicularia and
vibracula, some with avicularia alone and a few with vibracula alone.
<P>
It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in appearance
than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the head of a bird;
yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been developed from the
same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.  Hence, we can understand
how it is that these organs graduate in some cases, as I am informed by Mr.
Busk, into each other.  Thus, with the avicularia of several species of
Lepralia, the movable mandible is so much produced and is so like a bristle
that the presence of the upper or fixed beak alone serves to determine its
avicularian nature.  The vibracula may have been directly developed from
the lips of the cells, without having passed through the avicularian stage;
but it seems more probable that they have passed through this stage, as
during the early stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell,
with the included zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once.  In many
cases the vibracula have a grooved support at the base, which seems to
represent the fixed beak; though this support in some species is quite
absent.  This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is
interesting; for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia
had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever have
thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an organ,
resembling a bird's head, or an irregular box or hood.  It is interesting
to see two such widely different organs developed from a common origin; and
as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection to the zooid, there
is no difficulty in believing that all the gradations, by which the lip
became converted first into the lower mandible of an avicularium, and then
into an elongated bristle, likewise served as a protection in different
ways and under different circumstances.
<P>
In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases, namely the
structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of climbing plants. 
With respect to the former, he says:  "The explanation of their ORIGIN is
deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory--utterly insufficient to explain the
incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are of utility only
when they are considerably developed."  As I have fully treated this
subject in another work, I will here give only a few details on one alone
of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers of orchids, namely, their
pollinia.  A pollinium, when highly developed, consists of a mass of
pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk or caudicle, and this to a
little mass of extremely viscid matter.  The pollinia are by this means
transported by insects from one flower to the stigma of another.  In some
orchids there is no caudicle to the pollen-masses, and the grains are
merely tied together by fine threads; but as these are not confined to
orchids, they need not here be considered; yet I may mention that at the
base of the orchidaceous series, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads
were probably first developed.  In other orchids the threads cohere at one
end of the pollen-masses; and this forms the first or nascent trace of a
caudicle.  That this is the origin of the caudicle, even when of
considerable length and highly developed, we have good evidence in the
aborted pollen-grains which can sometimes be detected embedded within the
central and solid parts.
<P>
With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass of
viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of
gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant.  In most
flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little viscid
matter.  Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but in
much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas; and this stigma,
perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered sterile.  When
an insect visits a flower of this kind, it rubs off some of the viscid
matter, and thus at the same time drags away some of the pollen-grains. 
&gt;From this simple condition, which differs but little from that of a
multitude of common flowers, there are endless gradations--to species in
which the pollen-mass terminates in a very short, free caudicle--to others
in which the caudicle becomes firmly attached to the viscid matter, with
the sterile stigma itself much modified.  In this latter case we have a
pollinium in its most highly developed and perfect condition.  He who will
carefully examine the flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the
existence of the above series of gradations--from a mass of pollen-grains
merely tied together by threads, with the stigma differing but little from
that of the ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably
adapted for transportal by insects; nor will he deny that all the
gradations in the several species are admirably adapted in relation to the
general structure of each flower for its fertilisation by different
insects.  In this, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be
pushed further backwards; and it may be asked how did the stigma of an
ordinary flower become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of
any one group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to
attempt answering, such questions.
<P>
We will now turn to climbing plants.  These can be arranged in a long
series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I
have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils.  In these
two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the power
of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the tendrils
likewise possess.  The gradations from leaf-climbers to tendril bearers are
wonderfully close, and certain plants may be differently placed in either
class.  But in ascending the series from simple twiners to leaf-climbers,
an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness to a touch, by which
means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or these modified and
converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round and clasp the touching
object.  He who will read my memoir on these plants will, I think, admit
that all the many gradations in function and structure between simple
twiners and tendril-bearers are in each case beneficial in a high degree to
the species.  For instance, it is clearly a great advantage to a twining
plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is probable that every twiner which
possessed leaves with long foot-stalks would have been developed into a
leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had possessed in any slight degree the
requisite sensitiveness to a touch.
<P>
As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the
basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire this
power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and increased
through natural selection.  The power of twining depends, firstly, on the
stems while young being extremely flexible (but this is a character common
to many plants which are not climbers); and, secondly, on their continually
bending to all points of the compass, one after the other in succession, in
the same order.  By this movement the stems are inclined to all sides, and
are made to move round and round.  As soon as the lower part of a stem
strikes against any object and is stopped, the upper part still goes on
bending and revolving, and thus necessarily twines round and up the
support.  The revolving movement ceases after the early growth of each
shoot.  As in many widely separated families of plants, single species and
single genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners,
they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from
a common progenitor.  Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency
to a movement of this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with
plants which did not climb; and that this had afforded the basis for
natural selection to work on and improve.  When I made this prediction, I
knew of only one imperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a
Maurandia which revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of
twining plants, but without making any use of this habit.  Soon afterwards
Fritz Muller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a Linum--
plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural system--
revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has reason to
suspect that this occurs with some other plants.  These slight movements
appear to be of no service to the plants in question; anyhow, they are not
of the least use in the way of climbing, which is the point that concerns
us.  Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these plants had been
flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are exposed it had
profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit of slightly and
irregularly revolving might have been increased and utilised through
natural selection, until they had become converted into well-developed
twining species.
<P>
With respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and
flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in the
case of the revolving movements of twining plants.  As a vast number of
species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this kind of
sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in many plants
which have not become climbers.  This is the case:  I observed that the
young flower-peduncles of the above Maurandia curved themselves a little
towards the side which was touched.  Morren found in several species of
Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved, especially after
exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and repeatedly touched, or
when the plant was shaken.  I repeated these observations on some other
species of Oxalis with the same result; in some of them the movement was
distinct, but was best seen in the young leaves; in others it was extremely
slight.  It is a more important fact that according to the high authority
of Hofmeister, the young shoots and leaves of all plants move after being
shaken; and with climbing plants it is, as we know, only during the early
stages of growth that the foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.
<P>
It is scarcely possible that the above slight movements, due to a touch or
shake, in the young and growing organs of plants, can be of any functional
importance to them.  But plants possess, in obedience to various stimuli,
powers of movement, which are of manifest importance to them; for instance,
towards and more rarely from the light--in opposition to, and more rarely
in the direction of, the attraction of gravity.  When the nerves and
muscles of an animal are excited by galvanism or by the absorption of
strychnine, the consequent movements may be called an incidental result,
for the nerves and muscles have not been rendered specially sensitive to
these stimuli.  So with plants it appears that, from having the power of
movement in obedience to certain stimuli, they are excited in an incidental
manner by a touch, or by being shaken.  Hence there is no great difficulty
in admitting that in the case of leaf-climbers and tendril-bearers, it is
this tendency which has been taken advantage of and increased through
natural selection.  It is, however, probable, from reasons which I have
assigned in my memoir, that this will have occurred only with plants which
had already acquired the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.
<P>
I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners, namely, by
the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving movements,
which were at first of no use to them; this movement, as well as that due
to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of the power of moving,
gained for other and beneficial purposes.  Whether, during the gradual
development of climbing plants, natural selection has been aided by the
inherited effects of use, I will not pretend to decide; but we know that
certain periodical movements, for instance the so-called sleep of plants,
are governed by habit.
<P>
I have now considered enough, perhaps more than enough, of the cases,
selected with care by a skilful naturalist, to prove that natural selection
is incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful structures;
and I have shown, as I hope, that there is no great difficulty on this
head.  A good opportunity has thus been afforded for enlarging a little on
gradations of structure, often associated with strange functions--an
important subject, which was not treated at sufficient length in the former
editions of this work.  I will now briefly recapitulate the foregoing
cases.
<P>
With the giraffe, the continued preservation of the individuals of some
extinct high-reaching ruminant, which had the longest necks, legs, etc.,
and could browse a little above the average height, and the continued
destruction of those which could not browse so high, would have sufficed
for the production of this remarkable quadruped; but the prolonged use of
all the parts, together with inheritance, will have aided in an important
manner in their co-ordination.  With the many insects which imitate various
objects, there is no improbability in the belief that an accidental
resemblance to some common object was in each case the foundation for the
work of natural selection, since perfected through the occasional 
preservation of slight variations which made the resemblance at all closer;
and this will have been carried on as long as the insect continued to vary,
and as long as a more and more perfect resemblance led to its escape from
sharp-sighted enemies.  In certain species of whales there is a tendency to
the formation of irregular little points of horn on the palate; and it
seems to be quite within the scope of natural selection to preserve all
favourable variations, until the points were converted, first into
lamellated knobs or teeth, like those on the beak of a goose--then into
short lamellae, like those of the domestic ducks--and then into lamellae,
as perfect as those of the shoveller-duck--and finally into the gigantic
plates of baleen, as in the mouth of the Greenland whale.  In the family of
the ducks, the lamellae are first used as teeth, then partly as teeth and
partly as a sifting apparatus, and at last almost exclusively for this
latter purpose.
<P>
With such structures as the above lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit or
use can have done little or nothing, as far as we can judge, towards their
development.  On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye of a
flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of a prehensile
tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use, together with
inheritance.  With respect to the mammae of the higher animals, the most
probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous glands over the
whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious fluid; and that
these glands were improved in function through natural selection, and
concentrated into a confined area, in which case they would have formed a
mamma.  There is no more difficulty in understanding how the branched
spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as a defence, became
developed through natural selection into tridactyle pedicellariae, than in
understanding the development of the pincers of crustaceans, through
slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate and penultimate segments
of a limb, which was at first used solely for locomotion.  In the
avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have organs widely different in
appearance developed from the same source; and with the vibracula we can
understand how the successive gradations might have been of service.  With
the pollinia of orchids, the threads which originally served to tie
together the pollen-grains, can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the
steps can likewise be followed by which viscid matter, such as that
secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly
but not quite the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the
caudicles--all these gradations being of manifest benefit to the plants in
question.  With respect to climbing plants, I need not repeat what has been
so lately said.
<P>
It has often been asked, if natural selection be so potent, why has not
this or that structure been gained by certain species, to which it would
apparently have been advantageous?  But it is unreasonable to expect a
precise answer to such questions, considering our ignorance of the past
history of each species, and of the conditions which at the present day
determine its numbers and range.  In most cases only general reasons, but
in some few cases special reasons, can be assigned.  Thus to adapt a
species to new habits of life, many co-ordinated modifications are almost
indispensable, and it may often have happened that the requisite parts did
not vary in the right manner or to the right degree.  Many species must
have been prevented from increasing in numbers through destructive
agencies, which stood in no relation to certain structures, which we
imagine would have been gained through natural selection from appearing to
us advantageous to the species.  In this case, as the struggle for life did
not depend on such structures, they could not have been acquired through
natural selection.  In many cases complex and long-enduring conditions,
often of a peculiar nature, are necessary for the development of a
structure; and the requisite conditions may seldom have concurred.  The
belief that any given structure, which we think, often erroneously, would
have been beneficial to a species, would have been gained under all
circumstances through natural selection, is opposed to what we can
understand of its manner of action.  Mr. Mivart does not deny that natural
selection has effected something; but he considers it as "demonstrably
insufficient" to account for the phenomena which I explain by its agency. 
His chief arguments have now been considered, and the others will hereafter
be considered.  They seem to me to partake little of the character of
demonstration, and to have little weight in comparison with those in favour
of the power of natural selection, aided by the other agencies often
specified.  I am bound to add, that some of the facts and arguments here
used by me, have been advanced for the same purpose in an able article
lately published in the "Medico-Chirurgical Review."
<P>
At the present day almost all naturalists admit evolution under some form.
Mr. Mivart believes that species change through "an internal force or
tendency," about which it is not pretended that anything is known.  That
species have a capacity for change will be admitted by all evolutionists;
but there is no need, as it seems to me, to invoke any internal force
beyond the tendency to ordinary variability, which through the aid of
selection, by man has given rise to many well-adapted domestic races, and
which, through the aid of natural selection, would equally well give rise
by graduated steps to natural races or species.  The final result will
generally have been, as already explained, an advance, but in some few
cases a retrogression, in organisation.
<P>
Mr. Mivart is further inclined to believe, and some naturalists agree with
him, that new species manifest themselves "with suddenness and by
modifications appearing at once."  For instance, he supposes that the
differences between the extinct three-toed Hipparion and the horse arose
suddenly.  He thinks it difficult to believe that the wing of a bird "was
developed in any other way than by a comparatively sudden modification of a
marked and important kind;" and apparently he would extend the same view to
the wings of bats and pterodactyles.  This conclusion, which implies great
breaks or discontinuity in the series, appears to me improbable in the
highest degree.
<P>
Everyone who believes in slow and gradual evolution, will of course admit
that specific changes may have been as abrupt and as great as any single
variation which we meet with under nature, or even under domestication. 
But as species are more variable when domesticated or cultivated than under
their natural conditions, it is not probable that such great and abrupt
variations have often occurred under nature, as are known occasionally to
arise under domestication.  Of these latter variations several may be
attributed to reversion; and the characters which thus reappear were, it is
probable, in many cases at first gained in a gradual manner.  A still
greater number must be called monstrosities, such as six-fingered men,
porcupine men, Ancon sheep, Niata cattle, etc.; and as they are widely
different in character from natural species, they throw very little light
on our subject.  Excluding such cases of abrupt variations, the few which
remain would at best constitute, if found in a state of nature, doubtful
species, closely related to their parental types.
<P>
My reasons for doubting whether natural species have changed as abruptly as
have occasionally domestic races, and for entirely disbelieving that they
have changed in the wonderful manner indicated by Mr. Mivart, are as
follows.  According to our experience, abrupt and strongly marked
variations occur in our domesticated productions, singly and at rather long
intervals of time.  If such occurred under nature, they would be liable, as
formerly explained, to be lost by accidental causes of destruction and by
subsequent intercrossing; and so it is known to be under domestication,
unless abrupt variations of this kind are specially preserved and separated
by the care of man.  Hence, in order that a new species should suddenly
appear in the manner supposed by Mr. Mivart, it is almost necessary to
believe, in opposition to all analogy, that several wonderfully changed
individuals appeared simultaneously within the same district.  This
difficulty, as in the case of unconscious selection by man, is avoided on
the theory of gradual evolution, through the preservation of a large number
of individuals, which varied more or less in any favourable direction, and
of the destruction of a large number which varied in an opposite manner.
<P>
That many species have been evolved in an extremely gradual manner, there
can hardly be a doubt.  The species and even the genera of many large
natural families are so closely allied together that it is difficult to
distinguish not a few of them.  On every continent, in proceeding from
north to south, from lowland to upland, etc., we meet with a host of
closely related or representative species; as we likewise do on certain
distinct continents, which we have reason to believe were formerly
connected.  But in making these and the following remarks, I am compelled
to allude to subjects hereafter to be discussed.  Look at the many outlying
islands round a continent, and see how many of their inhabitants can be
raised only to the rank of doubtful species.  So it is if we look to past
times, and compare the species which have just passed away with those still
living within the same areas; or if we compare the fossil species embedded
in the sub-stages of the same geological formation.  It is indeed manifest
that multitudes of species are related in the closest manner to other
species that still exist, or have lately existed; and it will hardly be
maintained that such species have been developed in an abrupt or sudden
manner.  Nor should it be forgotten, when we look to the special parts of
allied species, instead of to distinct species, that numerous and
wonderfully fine gradations can be traced, connecting together widely
different structures.
<P>
Many large groups of facts are intelligible only on the principle that
species have been evolved by very small steps.  For instance, the fact that
the species included in the larger genera are more closely related to each
other, and present a greater number of varieties than do the species in the
smaller genera.  The former are also grouped in little clusters, like
varieties round species; and they present other analogies with varieties,
as was shown in our second chapter.  On this same principle we can
understand how it is that specific characters are more variable than
generic characters; and how the parts which are developed in an
extraordinary degree or manner are more variable than other parts of the
same species.  Many analogous facts, all pointing in the same direction,
could be added.
<P>
Although very many species have almost certainly been produced by steps not
greater than those separating fine varieties; yet it may be maintained that
some have been developed in a different and abrupt manner.  Such an
admission, however, ought not to be made without strong evidence being
assigned.  The vague and in some respects false analogies, as they have
been shown to be by Mr. Chauncey Wright, which have been advanced in favour
of this view, such as the sudden crystallisation of inorganic substances,
or the falling of a facetted spheroid from one facet to another, hardly
deserve consideration.  One class of facts, however, namely, the sudden
appearance of new and distinct forms of life in our geological formations
supports at first sight the belief in abrupt development.  But the value of
this evidence depends entirely on the perfection of the geological record,
in relation to periods remote in the history of the world.  If the record
is as fragmentary as many geologists strenuously assert, there is nothing
strange in new forms appearing as if suddenly developed.
<P>
Unless we admit transformations as prodigious as those advocated by Mr.
Mivart, such as the sudden development of the wings of birds or bats, or
the sudden conversion of a Hipparion into a horse, hardly any light is
thrown by the belief in abrupt modifications on the deficiency of
connecting links in our geological formations.  But against the belief in
such abrupt changes, embryology enters a strong protest.  It is notorious
that the wings of birds and bats, and the legs of horses or other
quadrupeds, are undistinguishable at an early embryonic period, and that
they become differentiated by insensibly fine steps.  Embryological
resemblances of all kinds can be accounted for, as we shall hereafter see,
by the progenitors of our existing species having varied after early youth,
and having transmitted their newly-acquired characters to their offspring,
at a corresponding age.  The embryo is thus left almost unaffected, and
serves as a record of the past condition of the species.  Hence it is that
existing species during the early stages of their development so often
resemble ancient and extinct forms belonging to the same class.  On this
view of the meaning of embryological resemblances, and indeed on any view,
it is incredible that an animal should have undergone such momentous and
abrupt transformations as those above indicated, and yet should not bear
even a trace in its embryonic condition of any sudden modification, every
detail in its structure being developed by insensibly fine steps.
<P>
He who believes that some ancient form was transformed suddenly through an
internal force or tendency into, for instance, one furnished with wings,
will be almost compelled to assume, in opposition to all analogy, that many
individuals varied simultaneously.  It cannot be denied that such abrupt
and great changes of structure are widely different from those which most
species apparently have undergone.  He will further be compelled to believe
that many structures beautifully adapted to all the other parts of the same
creature and to the surrounding conditions, have been suddenly produced;
and of such complex and wonderful co-adaptations, he will not be able to
assign a shadow of an explanation.  He will be forced to admit that these
great and sudden transformations have left no trace of their action on the
embryo.  To admit all this is, as it seems to me, to enter into the realms
of miracle, and to leave those of science.
