<p>There are things and there are faces which, when felt or seen for
the first time, stamp themselves upon the mind like a sun image on
a sensitized plate and there remain unalterably fixed. To take the
instance of a face--we may never see it again, or it may become the
companion of our life, but there the picture is just as we <u>first</u> knew
it, the same smile or frown, the same look, unvarying and unvariable,
reminding us in the midst of change of the indestructible nature of
every experience, act, and aspect of our days. For that which has been,
is, since the past knows no corruption, but lives eternally in its
frozen and completed self.
</p><p>These are somewhat large thoughts to be born of a small matter, but they
rose up spontaneously in the mind of a soldierly-looking man who, on the
particular evening when this history opens, was leaning over a gate in
an Eastern county lane, staring vacantly at a field of ripe corn.
</p><p>He was a peculiar and rather battered looking individual, apparently
over forty years of age, and yet bearing upon him that unmistakable
stamp of dignity and self-respect which, if it does not exclusively
belong to, is still one of the distinguishing attributes of the English
gentleman. In face he was ugly, no other word can express it. Here were
not the long mustachios, the almond eyes, the aristocratic air of the
Colonel of fiction--for our dreamer was a Colonel. These were--alas!
that the truth should be so plain--represented by somewhat scrubby
sandy-coloured whiskers, small but kindly blue eyes, a low broad
forehead, with a deep line running across it from side to side,
something like that to be seen upon the busts of Julius Caesar, and a
long thin nose. One good feature, however, he did possess, a mouth of
such sweetness and beauty that set, as it was, above a very square and
manly-looking chin, it had the air of being ludicrously out of place.
"Umph," said his old aunt, Mrs. Massey (who had just died and left him
what she possessed), on the occasion of her first introduction to him
five-and-thirty years before, "Umph! Nature meant to make a pretty girl
of you, and changed her mind after she had finished the mouth. Well,
never mind, better be a plain man than a pretty woman. There, go along,
boy! I like your ugly face."
</p><p>Nor was the old lady peculiar in this respect, for plain as the
countenance of Colonel Harold Quaritch undoubtedly was, people found
something very taking about it, when once they became accustomed to its
rugged air and stern regulated expression. What that something was it
would be hard to define, but perhaps the nearest approach to the truth
would be to describe it as a light of purity which, notwithstanding the
popular idea to the contrary, is quite as often to be found upon the
faces of men as upon those of women. Any person of discernment looking
on Colonel Quaritch must have felt that he was in the presence of a good
man--not a prig or a milksop, but a man who had attained by virtue of
thought and struggle that had left their marks upon him, a man whom it
would not be well to tamper with, one to be respected by all, and feared
of evildoers. Men felt this, and he was popular among those who knew him
in his service, though not in any hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. But
among women he was not popular. As a rule they both feared and disliked
him. His presence jarred upon the frivolity of the lighter members of
their sex, who dimly realised that his nature was antagonistic, and the
more solid ones could not understand him. Perhaps this was the reason
why Colonel Quaritch had never married, had never even had a love affair
since he was five-and-twenty.
</p><p>And yet it was of a woman that he was thinking as he leant over the
gate, and looked at the field of yellowing corn, undulating like a
golden sea beneath the pressure of the wind.
</p><p>Colonel Quaritch had twice before been at Honham, once ten, and once
four years ago. Now he was come to abide there for good. His old
aunt, Mrs. Massey, had owned a place in the village--a very small
place--called Honham Cottage, or Molehill, and on those two occasions
he visited her. Mrs. Massey was dead and buried. She had left him the
property, and with some reluctance, he had given up his profession, in
which he saw no further prospects, and come to live upon it. This was
his first evening in the place, for he had arrived by the last train on
the previous night. All day he had been busy trying to get the house a
little straight, and now, thoroughly tired, he was refreshing himself by
leaning over a gate. It is, though a great many people will not believe
it, one of the most delightful and certainly one of the cheapest
refreshments in the world.
</p><p>And then it was, as he leant over the gate, that the image of a woman's
face rose before his mind as it had continually risen during the last
five years. Five years had gone since he saw it, and those five years he
spent in India and Egypt, that is with the exception of six months which
he passed in hospital--the upshot of an Arab spear thrust in the thigh.
</p><p>It had risen before him in all sorts of places and at all sorts of
times; in his sleep, in his waking moments, at mess, out shooting, and
even once in the hot rush of battle. He remembered it well--it was at El
Teb. It happened that stern necessity forced him to shoot a man with his
pistol. The bullet cut through his enemy, and with a few convulsions
he died. He watched him die, he could not help doing so, there was
some fascination in following the act of his own hand to its dreadful
conclusion, and indeed conclusion and commencement were very near
together. The terror of the sight, the terror of what in defence of
his own life he was forced to do, revolted him even in the heat of the
fight, and even then, over that ghastly and distorted face, another face
spread itself like a mask, blotting it out from view--that woman's
face. And now again it re-arose, inspiring him with the rather recondite
reflections as to the immutability of things and impressions with which
this domestic record opens.
</p><p>Five years is a good stretch in a man's journey through the world. Many
things happen to us in that time. If a thoughtful person were to set to
work to record all the impressions which impinge upon his mind during
that period, he would fill a library with volumes, the mere tale of its
events would furnish a shelf. And yet how small they are to look back
upon. It seemed but the other day that he was leaning over this very
gate, and had turned to see a young girl dressed in black, who, with a
spray of honeysuckle thrust in her girdle, and carrying a stick in her
hand, was walking leisurely down the lane.
</p><p>There was something about the girl's air that had struck him while she
was yet a long way off--a dignity, a grace, and a set of the shoulders.
Then as she came nearer he saw the soft dark eyes and the waving brown
hair that contrasted so strangely and effectively with the pale and
striking features. It was not a beautiful face, for the mouth was too
large, and the nose was not as straight as it might have been, but there
was a power about the broad brow, and a force and solid nobility stamped
upon the features which had impressed him strangely. Just as she came
opposite to where he was standing, a gust of wind, for there was a stiff
breeze, blew the lady's hat off, taking it over the hedge, and he, as in
duty bound, scrambled into the field and fetched it for her, and she had
thanked him with a quick smile and a lighting up of the brown eyes, and
then passed on with a bow.
</p><p>Yes, with a little bow she had passed on, and he watched her walking
down the long level drift, till her image melted into the stormy sunset
light, and was gone. When he returned to the cottage he had described
her to his old aunt, and asked who she might be, to learn that she was
Ida de la Molle (which sounded like a name out of a novel), the only
daughter of the old squire who lived at Honham Castle. Next day he had
left for India, and saw Miss de la Molle no more.
</p><p>And now he wondered what had become of her. Probably she was married; so
striking a person would be almost sure to attract the notice of men. And
after all what could it matter to him? He was not a marrying man, and
women as a class had little attraction for him; indeed he disliked them.
It has been said that he had never married, and never even had a love
affair since he was five-and-twenty. But though he was not married, he
once--before he was five-and-twenty--very nearly took that step. It was
twenty years ago now, and nobody quite knew the history, for in twenty
years many things are fortunately forgotten. But there was a history,
and a scandal, and the marriage was broken off almost on the day
it should have taken place. And after that it leaked out in the
neighbourhood that the young lady, who by the way was a considerable
heiress, had gone off her head, presumably with grief, and been confined
in an asylum, where she was believed still to remain.
</p><p>Perhaps it was the thought of this one woman's face, the woman he had
once seen walking down the drift, her figure limned out against the
stormy sky, that led him to think of the other face, the face hidden
in the madhouse. At any rate, with a sigh, or rather a groan, he swung
himself round from the gate and began to walk homeward at a brisk pace.
</p><p>The drift that he was following is known as the mile drift, and had in
ancient times formed the approach to the gates of Honham Castle, the
seat of the ancient and honourable family of de la Molle (sometimes
written "Delamol" in history and old writings). Honham Castle was now
nothing but a ruin, with a manor house built out of the wreck on one
side of its square, and the broad way that led to it from the high road
which ran from Boisingham,[*] the local country town, was a drift or
grass lane.
</p><p>[*] Said to have been so named after the Boissey family, whose heiress    a de la Molle married in the fourteenth century. As, however, the
</p><p>    town of Boisingham is mentioned by one of the old chroniclers,
    this does not seem very probable. No doubt the family took their
    name from the town or hamlet, not the town from the family.
</p><p>Colonel Quaritch followed this drift till he came to the high road, and
then turned. A few minutes' walk brought him to a drive opening out of
the main road on the left as he faced towards Boisingham. This drive,
which was some three hundred yards long, led up a rather sharp slope to
his own place, Honham Cottage, or Molehill, as the villagers called it,
a title calculated to give a keen impression of a neat spick and span
red brick villa with a slate roof. In fact, however, it was nothing of
the sort, being a building of the fifteenth century, as a glance at its
massive flint walls was sufficient to show. In ancient times there had
been a large Abbey at Boisingham, two miles away, which, the records
tell, suffered terribly from an outbreak of the plague in the fifteenth
century. After this the monks obtained ten acres of land, known as
Molehill, by grant from the de la Molle of the day, and so named either
on account of their resemblance to a molehill (of which more presently)
or after the family. On this elevated spot, which was supposed to
be peculiarly healthy, they built the little house now called Honham
Cottage, whereto to fly when next the plague should visit them.
</p><p>And as they built it, so, with some slight additions, it had remained to
this day, for in those ages men did not skimp their flint, and oak, and
mortar. It was a beautiful little spot, situated upon the flat top of
a swelling hill, which comprised the ten acres of grazing ground
originally granted, and was, strange to say, still the most
magnificently-timbered piece of ground in the country side. For on the
ten acres of grass land there stood over fifty great oaks, some of them
pollards of the most enormous antiquity, and others which had, no doubt,
originally grown very close together, fine upstanding trees with a
wonderful length and girth of bole. This place, Colonel Quaritch's aunt,
old Mrs. Massey, had bought nearly thirty years before when she became a
widow, and now, together with a modest income of two hundred a year, it
had passed to him under her will.
</p><p>Shaking himself clear of his sad thoughts, Harold Quaritch turned round
at his own front door to contemplate the scene. The long, single-storied
house stood, it has been said, at the top of the rising land, and to the
south and west and east commanded as beautiful a view as is to be seen
in the county. There, a mile or so away to the south, situated in the
midst of grassy grazing grounds, and flanked on either side by still
perfect towers, frowned the massive gateway of the old Norman castle.
Then, to the west, almost at the foot of Molehill, the ground broke
away in a deep bank clothed with timber, which led the eye down by slow
descents into the beautiful valley of the Ell. Here the silver river
wound its gentle way through lush and poplar-bordered marshes, where
the cattle stand knee-deep in flowers; past quaint wooden mill-houses,
through Boisingham Old Common, windy looking even now, and brightened
here and there with a dash of golden gorse, till it was lost beneath
the picturesque cluster of red-tiled roofs that marked the ancient town.
Look which way he would, the view was lovely, and equal to any to be
found in the Eastern counties, where the scenery is fine enough in
its own way, whatever people may choose to say to the contrary, whose
imaginations are so weak that they require a mountain and a torrent to
excite them into activity.
</p><p>Behind the house to the north there was no view, and for a good reason,
for here in the very middle of the back garden rose a mound of large
size and curious shape, which completely shut out the landscape. What
this mound, which may perhaps have covered half an acre of ground, was,
nobody had any idea. Some learned folk write it down a Saxon tumulus,
a presumption to which its ancient name, "Dead Man's Mount," seemed to
give colour. Other folk, however, yet more learned, declared it to be
an ancient British dwelling, and pointed triumphantly to a hollow at the
top, wherein the ancient Britishers were supposed to have moved, lived,
and had their being--which must, urged the opposing party, have been
a very damp one. Thereon the late Mrs. Massey, who was a British
dwellingite, proceeded to show with much triumph <u>how</u> they had lived
in the hole by building a huge mushroom-shaped roof over it, and thereby
turning it into a summer-house, which, owing to unexpected difficulties
in the construction of the roof, cost a great deal of money. But as the
roof was slated, and as it was found necessary to pave the hollow with
tiles and cut surface drains in it, the result did not clearly prove
its use as a dwelling place before the Roman conquest. Nor did it make
a very good summer house. Indeed it now served as a store place for the
gardener's tools and for rubbish generally.
