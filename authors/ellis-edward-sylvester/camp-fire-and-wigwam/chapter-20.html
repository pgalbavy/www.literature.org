<p>At the instant the almost inaudible rustling struck the ear of
Deerfoot the Shawanoe, he caught sight of a rifle barrel as it
was thrust among the undergrowth and aimed at him. It was the
faintest possible sound, caused by the pushing aside of the leaves
which he heard, and which he was expecting for a full minute to
hear. The lightning-like glance cast toward the point showed him
the dark barrel, and the ferocious gleam of the face of an Indian,
crouching on one knee just beyond.</p>

<p>The warrior who aimed the weapon meant to send the bullet through
the chest of the youth, whose approach, stealthy as it was, he
had detected. The distance was so slight that the briefest possible
time was required to make his aim certain; but while in the very
act of doing so, the sinewy youth vanished like a puff of vapor.</p>

<p>The savage was dumfounded, for nothing of the kind had ever occurred,
so far as his experience went, and it was unexplainable to him.
He had used the proverbial caution of his people, and he knew
from the expectant position of the youth that his suspicions were
excited, but he could not comprehend by what means he had passed
so suddenly from sight. The red man was in the very act of pressing
the trigger when he discovered he was not aiming at any target.</p>

<p>If the Indian tongue contained an execration, it may well be
imagined that a most vigorous one escaped the lips of the baffled
redskin, who was shut out from his prize at the moment of closing
his fingers upon it.</p>

<p>The warrior was a brawny, full-grown Indian, almost in middle
life, who had sunk on one knee and brought his gun to his shoulder,
after briefly studying the form which had approached his lurking
place. He had never seen the stranger until that moment, and he
only knew that he belonged to some totem unknown to him. It was
probable that his home was on the eastern shore of the Mississippi,
and he resented the intrusion upon his hunting grounds as he did
that of a white man: consequently he was as quick to take the
life of one as of the other.</p>

<p>Finding that his intended victim had disappeared beyond all question,
the next step of the fierce assassin was to solve the meaning
of the unaccountable occurrence. He noiselessly straightened up,
and craning his head forward peeped through the undergrowth. All
that he saw was the huge boulder or rock, within a few feet of
where the youth had been standing. It followed, therefore that
he had flung himself behind it, and was hiding there at that moment.</p>

<p>The painted visage glowed with a baleful light, for he was assured
his triumph was postponed only for a few moments. The boulder
might serve as a shelter while the relative positions of the two
were the same, but it was in the power of the savage to change
that by putting forth only moderate skill.</p>

<p>Taking care not to reveal himself, he began a guarded movement
to the right, his course being the same as if starting to describe
a circle about the hiding place. It will be seen that if he could
accomplish this without exposing himself to the fire of the other,
he would not need to go far before gaining a view of the opposite
side of the boulder, and necessarily of him who was seeking to
screen himself from discovery. To do this, however, the victim
must remain where he was, for manifestly, if he shifted his position
correspondingly, he would continue invisible, but he counted himself
fortunate that he had noticed the peculiar configuration of the
boulder, which rendered such a man[oe]uvre beyond the power of
an ordinary warrior. As for himself, he had no personal fear,
for the trees were so numerous that he could use them to shield
his body while leaping from one to the other, while in many places
he could steal along the ground without the possibility of detection.</p>

<p>If the fool had but known the woodcraft of the youth against
whom he was so eager to pit himself, he would have turned and
fled from the spot as from a plague; but he had never heard the
name of Deerfoot, and little dreamed of the skill of the extraordinary
youth.</p>

<p>The warrior stooped, crept, leaped, and stole through the wood
with a celerity that was astonishing. Within a very short time
after beginning the movement, he had described one-fourth of the
circle and gained the view he wished. It must be remembered, too,
that he had kept the boulder under such close surveillance as
to be morally certain the youth could not shift his position without
being observed.</p>

<p>But to his amazement he saw nothing of his victim. The flat slope
and the leafy ground were free from anything resembling a human
being. He stood peering from behind the tree, and at his wit's
end to know what it meant. He held his rifle so that the hammer
could be raised the moment the necessity came, and he must have
felt that the wiser course was for him to leave the spot without
further search.</p>

<p>Probably such would have been his course had he not heard a most
alarming sound directly behind him. It was the faint cough of
a person seeking to clear his throat. The Indian turned like a
flash, and saw the dusky youth a rod distant, holding his bow
loosely in his right hand, while his terrible left was drawn back
over his shoulder, the fingers clenching the handle of his tomahawk.
His position was precisely that of one who was on the very point
of launching the deadly missile which would have cloven the skull,
as though made of card-board. He had taken the posture, and then
uttered the slight cough with a view of "calling the attention"
of the party of the first part to the fact, and he succeeded.
The elder was in the position of the hunter who while seeking
the tiger awoke to the fact that the tiger was seeking him.</p>

<p>The warrior, whose face was daubed with red, black and yellow
paint, was literally struck dumb. He had been engaged in many
an encounter with strange Indians, but never had the affray been
introduced in a more favorable manner to himself, and never had
he been more utterly overwhelmed.</p>

<p>He saw that the youth was merely holding his tomahawk; the very
second it was needed, he could drive it into his chest or brain.
He was too proud to ask for mercy, for he had no thought it would
be granted. He could only face his master and await his doom.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was not the one to prolong the wretchedness of another,
no matter if his most deadly enemy. He stood with his left foot
slightly advanced and his muscles gathered, so that he did not
require the slightest preparation, and, having held the pose just
long enough to make sure it had produced its full effect, he slowly
lowered the tomahawk, keeping his eyes fixed on his enemy. When
the weapon was at his side, he said:</p>

<p>"The Sauk is a wolf; he steals behind the hunter that he may
leap on his shoulders when he sleeps; but the hunter heard the
sound of his claws on the leaves and turned upon him."</p>

<p>These words were uttered in the mongrel tongue of the Sauk, for
Deerfoot, after a careful inspection of the painted warrior, was
quite sure he belonged to that restless and warlike tribe. He
had encountered the people before, though at rare intervals, and
he had hunted with a pioneer who was familiar with the tongue.
The youth detected so many resemblances to other aboriginal languages
with which he was familiar that he quickly mastered it and could
speak it like a native.</p>

<p>The warrior, as has been said, was a brawny savage, well on toward
middle life. He was attired in the usual fashion among the Indians,
his dress looking slouchy and untidy. His straggling black hair,
instead of being ornamented with eagle feathers, was gathered
in a knot, so as to form what is often called a scalp-lock, and
to proclaim the fact that the wearer of the same challenged any
one to take it if he could. Besides his long rifle, he carried
his knife and tomahawk, after the manner of his people. He would
have proved a dangerous foe in a hand-to-hand struggle, but he
was deprived of whatever advantage he might have possessed by
being taken at such overwhelming disadvantage.</p>

<p>He caught every word uttered by Deerfoot, who had not mistaken
his totem. He had no thought that the youth intended to show him
mercy, but believed he was indulging in a little preliminary sermonizing&mdash;so
to speak&mdash;before claiming his scalp for the ridge-pole of his
wigwam.</p>

<p>The words of Deerfoot served to awaken the Sauk from his paralysis,
and, throwing his head back, he said:</p>

<p>"The Sauk is no wolf; the Shawanoe is the fox that steals upon
the hunting grounds of the Sauks."</p>

<p>"The lands that stretch to the rising and setting sun belong
not to the Shawanoe nor Sauk nor Huron, but the Great Spirit,
who loves his children to chase the buffalo and hunt the deer
and bear where they can be found; but why should the Sauk and
the Shawanoe be enemies?"</p>

<p>And to give point to the question, Deerfoot advanced and offered
his hand. The Sauk concealed his surprise and gave the fingers
a warm grasp, but while doing so each looked distrustfully in
the face of the other. The frightful stains on the broad face
of the elder did not alarm Deerfoot, who had seen much more frightful
countenances among his own people. He gazed calmly into the eyes
of the warrior, as the two stood close together with their hands
clasped. The Indian is an adept in concealing whatever emotions
may stir him, but Deerfoot saw the savage was puzzled over his
action. He could not but know that the Shawanoes were the most
warlike Indians in the Mississippi Valley, and one of the last
weaknesses of which they could be accused was that of showing
mercy to an enemy.</p>

<p>One point was necessary for Deerfoot to establish. If the Sauk
was alone, nothing was to be feared from him; but if he had brother
warriors within call, the youth had need to be on his guard.</p>

<p>"Why does the brother of Deerfoot hunt the woods alone?" asked
the young Shawanoe, introducing himself in this characteristic
fashion.</p>

<p>"Because Hay-uta fears not to go everywhere alone; from the ridge-pole
of his wigwam flutter the scalps of the Shawanoes, the Hurons,
the Foxes, the Osages, and the strange red man whom he has met
and slain in the forest."</p>

<p>The old nature in Deerfoot prompted him to take this vaunting
warrior to task. The answer of the Sauk was indefinite, but the
youth could wait a few minutes for the information he sought.</p>

<p>"Hay-uta, the Man-Who-Runs-Without-Falling, has not taken the
scalp of Deerfoot, <em>and cannot do so</em>!"</p>

<p>The flash of the eye which accompanied these words added to their
force. Before they could receive reply the youth added:</p>

<p>"Hay-uta is a brave man when he talks to squaws; less than twenty
great suns have passed over the head of Deerfoot, but he is not
afraid of the Man-Who-Runs-Without-Falling."</p>

<p>Indian nature is quick to resent such taunts, and beyond a doubt
the hot blood flushed the skin beneath the paint. Deerfoot noted
the glitter of the eye, and a twitch of the muscles of the arm
whose hand rested on the knife, as he made answer:</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe is a dog that crept up behind the Sauk, without
giving him warning; the rattlesnake speaks, but the Shawanoe does
not."</p>

<p>Deerfoot was angered by these words because they were untrue.</p>

<p>"The Shawanoe was walking through the wood, when the Great Spirit
whispered, 'Take care; a snake is crawling through the grass;
he is called Hay-uta; he will strike his fangs through the moccasin
of Deerfoot, unless he crushes him with his heel; Hay-uta was
not brave, because he hid behind a tree, and he pointed his gun
through the bushes, meaning to shoot the Shawanoe before he could
chant a word of his death-song.'"</p>

<p>This charge was an exasperating one, and instantly raised the
anger of the warrior to white heat.</p>

<p>"The dog of a Shawanoe holds his tomahawk and bow; let him lay
them aside as Hay-uta does his weapon, and then it shall be shown
who is the brave warrior."</p>

<p>It was a curious fact that while this wrathful conversation was
going on, the couple had been steadily backing away from each
other. The act showed that in spite of the token of comity that
had just passed between them, they were mutually so suspicious
as to be ready to fly at each other. The last taunt forced the
quarrel to the exploding point. Deerfoot slipped the cord which
held the quiver of arrows in place over his head, by a motion
so quick as scarcely to be perceptible, flung his bow a rod from
him, tossed his tomahawk a dozen feet away, and whipping out his
hunting-knife, grasped it with his left hand, and defiantly confronted
the Sauk, who was scarcely behind him in taking up the gauge of
battle.</p>
