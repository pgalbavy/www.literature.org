<p>THE WEEK FOLLOWING Christmas brought in a thaw, and by New Year’s Day
all the world about us was a broth of grey slush, and the guttered slope
between the windmill and the barn was running black water. The soft
black earth stood out in patches along the roadsides. I resumed all my
chores, carried in the cobs and wood and water, and spent the afternoons
at the barn, watching Jake shell corn with a hand-sheller.
</p><p>One morning, during this interval of fine weather, Antonia and her
mother rode over on one of their shaggy old horses to pay us a visit.
It was the first time Mrs. Shimerda had been to our house, and she ran
about examining our carpets and curtains and furniture, all the while
commenting upon them to her daughter in an envious, complaining tone.
In the kitchen she caught up an iron pot that stood on the back of
the stove and said: ‘You got many, Shimerdas no got.’ I thought it
weak-minded of grandmother to give the pot to her.
</p><p>After dinner, when she was helping to wash the dishes, she said, tossing
her head: ‘You got many things for cook. If I got all things like you, I
make much better.’
</p><p>She was a conceited, boastful old thing, and even misfortune could not
humble her. I was so annoyed that I felt coldly even toward Antonia and
listened unsympathetically when she told me her father was not well.
</p><p>‘My papa sad for the old country. He not look good. He never make music
any more. At home he play violin all the time; for weddings and for
dance. Here never. When I beg him for play, he shake his head no. Some
days he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on
the strings, like this, but never he make the music. He don’t like this
kawntree.’
</p><p>‘People who don’t like this country ought to stay at home,’ I said
severely. ‘We don’t make them come here.’
</p><p>‘He not want to come, never!’ she burst out. ‘My mamenka make him come.
All the time she say: “America big country; much money, much land for
my boys, much husband for my girls.” My papa, he cry for leave his old
friends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play
the long horn like this’--she indicated a slide trombone. “They go
to school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want
Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle.”’
</p><p>‘Your mama,’ I said angrily, ‘wants other people’s things.’
</p><p>“Your grandfather is rich,” she retorted fiercely. ‘Why he not help my
papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very
smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.’
</p><p>Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs.
Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly
with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother
had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than
she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother.
</p><p>After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their
miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to
grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that
snooping old woman wouldn’t come to see us any more.
</p><p>Grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto’s
sock. ‘She’s not old, Jim, though I expect she seems old to you. No, I
wouldn’t mourn if she never came again. But, you see, a body never knows
what traits poverty might bring out in ‘em. It makes a woman grasping to
see her children want for things. Now read me a chapter in “The Prince
of the House of David.” Let’s forget the Bohemians.’
</p><p>We had three weeks of this mild, open weather. The cattle in the corral
ate corn almost as fast as the men could shell it for them, and we hoped
they would be ready for an early market. One morning the two big bulls,
Gladstone and Brigham Young, thought spring had come, and they began to
tease and butt at each other across the barbed wire that separated them.
Soon they got angry. They bellowed and pawed up the soft earth with
their hoofs, rolling their eyes and tossing their heads. Each withdrew
to a far corner of his own corral, and then they made for each other at
a gallop. Thud, thud, we could hear the impact of their great heads, and
their bellowing shook the pans on the kitchen shelves. Had they not been
dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat
steers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the
affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while
Fuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again
and again, finally driving them apart.
</p><p>The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth
of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto
came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet.
They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling:
</p><p>‘You’ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was
a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.’
</p><p>All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply
spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That
afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their
tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles. Neither
grandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens
and brought in a pitiful contribution of eggs.
</p><p>Next day our men had to shovel until noon to reach the barn--and the
snow was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years
my grandfather had lived in Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would
not try to reach the cattle--they were fat enough to go without their
corn for a day or two; but tomorrow we must feed them and thaw out their
water-tap so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the
corrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under
the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were
probably warming each other’s backs. ‘This’ll take the bile out of ‘em!’
Fuchs remarked gleefully.
</p><p>At noon that day the hens had not been heard from. After dinner Jake and
Otto, their damp clothes now dried on them, stretched their stiff arms
and plunged again into the drifts. They made a tunnel through the snow
to the hen-house, with walls so solid that grandmother and I could walk
back and forth in it. We found the chickens asleep; perhaps they thought
night had come to stay. One old rooster was stirring about, pecking at
the solid lump of ice in their water-tin. When we flashed the lantern
in their eyes, the hens set up a great cackling and flew about clumsily,
scattering down-feathers. The mottled, pin-headed guinea-hens, always
resentful of captivity, ran screeching out into the tunnel and tried to
poke their ugly, painted faces through the snow walls. By five o’clock
the chores were done just when it was time to begin them all over again!
That was a strange, unnatural sort of day.
