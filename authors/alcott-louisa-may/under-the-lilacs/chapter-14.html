Putting all care behind them, the young folks ran down the hill, with a
very lively dog gambolling beside them, and took a delightfully
tantalizing survey of the external charms of the big tent. But people
were beginning to go in, and it was impossible to delay when they came
round to the entrance.</p>

<p>Ben felt that now &quot;his foot was on his native heath,&quot; and the superb air
of indifference with which he threw down his dollar at the
ticket-office, carelessly swept up the change, and strolled into the
tent with his hands in his pockets, was so impressive that even big Sam
repressed his excitement and meekly followed their leader, as he led
them from cage to cage, doing the honors as if he owned the whole
concern. Bab held tight to the flap of his jacket, staring about her
with round eyes, and listening with little gasps of astonishment or
delight to the roaring of lions, the snarling of tigers, the chatter of
the monkeys, the groaning of camels, and the music of the very brass
band shut up in a red bin.</p>

<p>Five elephants were tossing their hay about in the middle of the
menagerie, and Billy's legs shook under him as he looked up at the big
beasts whose long noses and small, sagacious eyes filled him with awe.
Sam was so tickled by the droll monkeys that the others left him before
the cage and went on to see the zebra, &quot;striped just like Ma's muslin
gown,&quot; Bab declared. But the next minute she forgot all about him in her
raptures over the ponies and their tiny colts; especially one mite of a
thing who lay asleep on the hay, such a miniature copy of its little
mouse-colored mamma that one could hardly believe it was alive.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Ben, I must feel of it!  -  the cunning baby horse!&quot; and down went
Bab inside the rope to pat and admire the pretty creature, while its
mother smelt suspiciously at the brown hat, and baby lazily opened one
eye to see what was going on.</p>

<p>&quot;Come out of that, it isn't allowed&quot; commanded Ben, longing to do the
same thing, but mindful of the proprieties and his own dignity.</p>

<p>Bab reluctantly tore herself away to find consolation in watching the
young lions, who looked so like big puppies, and the tigers washing
their faces just as puss did.</p>

<p>&quot;If I stroked 'em, wouldn't they purr?&quot; she asked, bent on enjoying
herself, while Ben held her skirts lest she should try the experiment.</p>

<p>&quot;You'd better not go to patting them, or you'll get your hands clawed
up. Tigers do purr like fun when they are happy, but these fellers never
are, and you'll only see 'em spit and snarl,&quot; said Ben, leading the way
to the humpy carrels, who were peacefully chewing their cud and longing
for the desert, with a dreamy, far-away look in their mournful eyes.</p>

<p>Here, leaning on the rope, and scientifically biting a straw while he
talked, Ben played showman to his heart's content till the neigh of a
horse from the circus tent beyond reminded him of the joys to come.</p>

<p>&quot;We'd better hurry along and get good seats before folks begin to crowd.
I want to sit near the curtain and see if any of Smitthers's lot are
'round.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I ain't going way off there; you can't see half so well, and that big
drum makes such a noise you can't hear yourself think,&quot; said Sam, who
had rejoined them.</p>

<p>So they settled in good places where they could see and hear all that
went on in the ring and still catch glimpses of white horses, bright
colors, and the glitter of helmets beyond the dingy red curtains. Ben
treated Bab to peanuts and pop-corn like an indulgent parent, and she
murmured protestations of undying gratitude with her mouth full, as she
sat blissfully between him and the congenial Billy.</p>

<p>Sancho, meantime, had been much excited by the familiar sights and
sounds, and now was greatly exercised in his doggish mind at the unusual
proceeding of his master; for he was sure that they ought to be within
there, putting on their costumes, ready to take their turn. He looked
anxiously at Ben, sniffed disdainfully at the strap as if to remind him
that a scarlet ribbon ought to take its place, and poked peanut shells
about with his paw as if searching for the letters with which to spell
his famous name.</p>

<p>&quot;I know, old boy, I know; but it can't be done. We've quit the busin'ess
and must just look on. No larks for us this time, Sanch, so keep quiet
and behave,' whispered Ben, tucking the dog away under the seat with a
sympathetic cuddle of the curly head that peeped out from between his
feet.</p>

<p>&quot;He wants to go and cut up, don't he?&quot; said Billy, &quot;and so do you, I
guess. Wish you were going to. Wouldn't it be fun to see Ben showing off
in there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd be afraid to have him go up on a pile of elephants and jump through
hoops like these folks,&quot; answered Bab, poring over her pictured
play-bill with unabated relish.</p>

<p>&quot;Done it a hundred times, and I'd just like to show you what I can do. 
They don't seem to have any boys in this lot; shouldn't wonder if they'd
take me if I asked 'em,&quot; said Ben, moving uneasily on his seat and
casting wistful glances toward the inner tent where he knew he would
feel more at home than in his present place.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard some men say that it's against the law to have small boys now;
it's so dangerous and not good for them, this kind of thing. If that's
so, you're done for, Ben,&quot; observed Sam, with his most grown-up air,
remembering Ben's remarks on &quot;fat boys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't believe a word of it, and Sanch and I could go this minute and
get taken on, I'll bet. We are a valuable couple, and I could prove it
if I chose to,&quot; began Ben, getting excited and boastful.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, see, they're coming!  -  gold carriages and lovely horses, and flags
and elephants, and every thing,&quot; cried Bab, giving a clutch at Ben's arm
as the opening procession appeared headed by the band, tooting and
banging till their faces were as red as their uniforms.</p>

<p>Round and round they went till every one had seen their fill, then the
riders alone were left caracoling about the ring with feathers flying,
horses prancing, and performers looking as tired and indifferent as if
they would all like to go to sleep then and there.</p>

<p>&quot;How splendid!&quot; sighed Bab, as they went dashing out, to tumble off
almost before the horses stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;That's nothing! You wait till you see the bareback riding and the
'acrobatic exercises,'&quot; said Ben, quoting from the play-bill, with the
air of one who knew all about the feats to come, and could never be
surprised any more.</p>

<p>&quot;What are 'crowbackic exercises'?&quot; asked Billy, thirsting for
information.</p>

<p>&quot;Leaping and climbing and tumbling; you'll see George! what a stunning
horse!&quot; and Ben forgot every thing else to feast his eyes on the
handsome creature who now came pacing in to dance, upset and replace
chairs, kneel, bow, and perform many wonderful or graceful feats, ending
with a swift gallop while the rider sat in a chair on its back fanning
himself, with his legs crossed, as comfortably as you please.</p>

<p>&quot;That, now, is something like,&quot; and Ben's eyes shone with admiration and
envy as the pair vanished, and the pink and silver acrobats came leaping
into the ring.</p>

<p>The boys were especially interested in this part, and well they might
be; for strength and agility are manly attributes which lads appreciate,
and these lively fellows flew about like India-rubber balls, each trying
to outdo the other, till the leader of the acrobats capped the climax by
turning a double somersault over five elephants standing side by side.</p>

<p>&quot;There, Sir, how's that for a jump?&quot; asked Ben, rubbing his hands with
satisfaction as his friends clapped till their palms tingled.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll rig up a spring-board and try it,&quot; said Billy, fired with
emulation.</p>

<p>&quot;Where'll you get your elephants?&quot; asked Sam, scornfully. for gymnastics
were not in his line.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll do for one,&quot; retorted Ben, and Billy and Bab joined in his laugh
so heartily that a rough-looking, man who sat behind them, hearing all
they said, pronounced them a &quot;jolly set,&quot; and kept his eye on Sancho,
who now showed signs of insubordination.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo, that wasn't on the bill!&quot; cried Ben, as a parti-colored clown
came in, followed by half a dozen dogs.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm so glad; now Sancho will like it.  There's a poodle that might be
his ownty donty brother  -  the one with the blue ribbon,&quot; said Bab.
beaming with delight as the dogs took their seats in the chairs arranged
for them.</p>

<p>Sancho did like it only too well, for be scrambled out from under the
seat in a great hurry to go and greet his friends; and, being sharply
checked, sat up and begged so piteously that Ben found it very hard to
refuse and order him down. He subsided for a moment, but when the black
spaniel, who acted the canine clown, did something funny and was
applauded, Sancho made a dart as if bent on leaping into the ring to
outdo his rival, and Ben was forced to box his ears and put his feet on
the poor beast, fearing he would be ordered out if he made any
disturbance.</p>

<p>Too well trained to rebel again, Sancho lay meditating on his wrongs
till the dog act was over, carefully abstaining from any further sign of
interest in their tricks, and only giving a sidelong glance at the two
little poodles who came out of a basket to run up and down stairs on
their fore-paws, dance jigs on their hind-legs, and play various pretty
pranks to the great delight of all the children in the audience. If ever
a dog expressed by look and attitude, &quot;Pooh! I could do much better than
that, and astonish you all, if I were only allowed to,&quot; that dog was
Sancho, as he curled himself up and affected to turn his back on an
unappreciative world.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too bad, when he knows motr than all those chaps put together. I'd
give any thing if I could show him off as I used to. Folks always like
it, and I was ever so proud of him. He's mad now because I had to cuff
him, and won't take any notice of me till I make up,&quot; said Ben,
regretfully eying his offended friend, but not daring to beg pardon yet.</p>

<p>More riding followed, and Bab was kept in a breathless state by the
marvellous agility and skill of the gauzy lady who drove four horses at
once, leaped through hoops, over banners and bars, sprang off and on at
full speed, and seemed to enjoy it all so much it was impossible to
believe that there could be any danger or exertion in it. Then two girls
flew about on the trapeze, and walked on a tight rope, causing Bab to
feel that she had at last found her sphere; for, young as she was, her
mother often said,</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't know what this child is fit for, except mischief, like a
monkey.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll fix the clothes-line when I get home, and show Ma how nice it is.
Then, may be, she'd let me wear red and gold trousers, and climb round
like these girls,&quot; thought the busy little brain, much excited by all it
saw on that memorable day.</p>

<p>Nothing short of a pyramid of elephants with a glittering gentleman in a
turban and top boots on the summit would have made her forget this new
and charming plan. But that astonishing spectacle, and the prospect of a
cage of Bengal tigers with a man among them, in imminent danger of being
eaten before her eyes, entirely absorbed her thoughts till, just as the
big animals went lumbering out, a peal of thunder caused considerable
commotion in the audience. Men on the highest seats popped their heads
through the openings in the tent-cover and reported that a heavy shower
was coming up. Anxious mothers began to collect their flocks of children
as hens do their chickens at sunset; timid people told cheerful stories
of tents blown over in gales, cages upset and wild beasts let loose.
Many left in haste, and the performers hurried to finish as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm going now before the crowd comes, so I can get a lift home. I see
two or three folks I know, so I'm off;&quot; and, climbing hastily down, Sam
vanished without further ceremony.</p>

<p>&quot;Better wait till the shower is over. We can go and see the animals
again, and get home all dry, just as well as not,&quot; observed Ben,
encouragingly, as Billy looked anxiously at the billowing canvas over his
head, the swaying posts before him, and heard the quick patter of drops
outside, not to mention the melancholy roar of the lion which sounded
rather awful through the sudden gloom which filled the strange place.</p>

<p>&quot;I wouldn't miss the tigers for any thing. See, they are pulling in the
cart now, and the shiny man is all ready with his gun. Will he shoot any
of them, apprehension, for the sharp crack of a rifle startled her more
than the loudest thunder-clap she ever heard.</p>

<p>&quot;Bless you, no, child; it 's only powder to make a noise and scare 'em. 
I wouldn't like to be in his place, though; father says you can never
trust tigers as you can lions, no matter how tame they are. Sly
fellers, like cats, and when they scratch it's no joke, I tell you,&quot;
answered Ben, with a knowing wag of the head, as the sides of the cage
rattled down, and the poor, fierce creatures were seen leaping and
snarling as if they resented this display of their captivity.</p>

<p>Bab curled up her feet and winked fast with excitement as she watched
the &quot;shiny man&quot; fondle the great cats, lie down among them, pull open
their red mouths, and make them leap over him or crouch at his feet as
be snapped the long whip. When he fired the gun and they all fell as if
dead, she with difficulty suppressed a small scream and clapped her
hands over her ears; but poor Billy never minded it a bit, for he was
pale and quaking with the fear of &quot;heaven's artillery&quot; thundering
overhead, and as a bright flash of lightning seemed to run down the
tall tent-poles he hid his eyes and wished with all his heart that he
was safe with mother.</p>

<p>&quot;Afraid of thunder, Bill?&quot; asked Ben, trying to speak stoutly, while a
sense of his own responsibilities began to worry him, for how was Bab to
be got home in such a pouring rain?</p>

<p>&quot;It makes me sick; always did.  Wish I hadn't come,&quot; sighed Billy,
feeling, all too late, that lemonade and &quot;lozengers&quot; were not the
fittest food for man, or a stifling tent the best place to be in on a
hot July day, especially in a thunder-storm.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't ask you to come; you asked me; so it isn't my fault,&quot; said
Ben, rather gruffly, as people crowded by without pausing to hear the
comic song the clown was singing in spite of the confusion.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm so tired,&quot; groaned Bab, getting up with a long stretch of arms
and legs.</p>

<p>&quot;You'll be tireder before you get home, I guess. Nobody asked you to
Come, any way;&quot; and Ben gazed dolefully round him, wishing he could see
a familiar face or find a wiser head than his own to help him out of the
scrape he was in.</p>

<p>&quot;I said I wouldn't be a bother, and I won't.  I'll walk right home this
minute. I ain't afraid of thunder, and the rain won't hurt these old
clothes. Come along,&quot; cried Bab, bravely, bent on keeping her word,
though it looked much harder after the fun was all over than before.</p>

<p>&quot;My head aches like fury.  Don't I wish old Jack was here to take me
back,&quot; said Billy, following his companions in misfortune with sudden
energy, as a louder peal than before rolled overhead.</p>

<p>&quot;You might as well wish for Lita and the covered wagon while you are
about it, then we could all ride,&quot; answered Ben, leading the way to the
outer tent, where many people were lingering in hopes of fair weather.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Billy Barton, how in the world did you get here?&quot; cried a
surprised voice as the crook of a cane caught the boy by the collar and
jerked him face to face with a young farmer, who was pushing along,
followed by his, wife and two or three children.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Uncle Eben, I'm so glad you found Me! I walked over, and it's
raining, and I don't feel well. Let me go with you, can't I?&quot; asked
Billy, casting himself and all his woes upon the strong arm that had
laid hold of him.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't see what your mother was about to let you come so far alone, and
you just over scarlet fever. We are as full as ever we can be, but we'll
tuck you in somehow,&quot; said the pleasant-faced woman, bundling up her
baby, and bidding the two little lads &quot;keep close to father.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't come alone.  Sam got a ride, and can't you tuck Ben and Bab in
too? They ain't very big, either of them,&quot; whispered Billy, anxious to
serve his friends now that he was provided for himself.</p>

<p>&quot;Can't do it, any way.  Got to pick up mother at the corner, and that
will be all I can carry. It's lifting a little; hurry along, Lizzie, and
let us get out of this as quick is possible,&quot; said Uncle Eben,
impatiently; for going to a circus with a young family is not an easy
task, as every one knows who has ever tried it.</p>

<p>&quot;Ben, I'm real sorry there isn't room for you. I'll tell Bab's mother
where she is, and may be some one will come for you,&quot; said Billy,
hurriedly, as he tore himself away, feeling rather mean to desert the
others, though he could be of no use.</p>

<p>&quot;Cut away, and don't mind us. I'm all right, and Bab must do the best
she can,&quot; was all Ben had time to answer before his comrade was hustled
away by the crowd pressing round the entrance with much clashing of
umbrellas and scrambling of boys and men, who rather enjoyed the flurry.</p>

<p>&quot;No use for us to get knocked about in that scrimmage.  We'll wait a
minute and then go out easy. It's a regular rouser, and you'll be as wet
as a sop before we get home. Hope you'll like that?&quot; added Ben, looking
out at the heavy rain poring down as if it never meant to stop.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't care a bit,&quot; said Bab, swinging on one of the ropes with a
happy-go-lucky air, for her spirits were not extinguished yet, and she
was bound to enjoy this exciting holiday to the very end. &quot;I like
circuses so much! I wish I lived here all the time, and slept in a
wagon, as you did, and had these dear little colties to play with.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It wouldn't be fun if you didn't have any folks to take care of you,&quot;
began Ben, thoughtfully looking about the familiar place where the men
were now feeding the animals, setting their refreshment tables, or
lounging on the hay to get such rest as they could before the evening
entertainment. Suddenly he started, gave a long look, then turned to
Bab, and thrusting Sancho's strap into her hand, said, hastily:</p>

<p>&quot;I see a fellow I used to know. May be he can tell me something about
father. Don't you stir till I come back.&quot;</p>

<p>Then he was off like a shot, and Bab saw him run after a man with a
bucket who bad been watering the zebra. Sancho tried to follow, but was
checked with an impatient, - </p>

<p>&quot;No, you can't go!  What a plague you are, tagging around when people
don't want you.&quot;</p>

<p>Sancho might have answered, &quot;So are you,&quot; but, being a gentlemanly dog,
he sat down with a resigned expression to watch the little colts, who
were now awake and seemed ready for a game of bo-peep behind their
mammas. Bab enjoyed their funny little frisks so much that she tied the
wearisome strap to a post, and crept under the rope to pet the tiny
mouse-colored one who came and talked to her with baby whinnies and
confiding glances of its soft, dark eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, luckless Bab! why did you turn your back? Oh, too accomplished
Sancho! why did you neatly untie that knot and trot away to confer with
the disreputable bull-dog who stood in the entrance beckoning with
friendly wavings of an abbreviated tail? Oh, much afflicted Ben! why did
you delay till it was too late to save your pet from the rough man who
set his foot upon the trailing strap, and led poor Sanch quickly out of
sight among the crowd?</p>

<p>&quot;It was Bascum, but he didn't know any thing. Why, where's Sanch?&quot; said
Ben, returning. A breathless voice made Bab turn to see Ben looking
about him with as much alarm in his hot face as if the dog had been a
two years' child.</p>

<p>&quot;I tied him  -  he's here somewhere  -  with the ponies,&quot; stammered Bab, 
in sudden dismay, for no sign of a dog appeared as her eyes roved 
wildly to and fro.</p>

<p>Ben whistled, called and searched in vain, till one of the lounging men
said, lazily,</p>

<p>&quot;If you are looking after the big poodle you'd better go outside; I saw
him trotting off with another dog.&quot;</p>

<p>Away rushed Ben, with Bab following, regardless of the rain, for both
felt that a great misfortune had befallen them. But, long before this,
Sancho had vanished, and no one minded his indignant howls as he was
driven off in a covered cart.</p>

<p>&quot;If he is lost I'll never forgive you; never, never, never!&quot; and Ben
found it impossible to resist giving Bab several hard shakes, which made
her yellow braids fly up and down like pump handles.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm dreadful sorry. He'll come back  -  you said he always did,&quot; pleaded
Bab, quite crushed by her own afflictions, and rather scared to see Ben
look so fierce, for he seldom lost his temper or was rough with the
little girls.</p>

<p>&quot;If he doesn't come back, don't you speak to me for a year.  Now, I'm
going home.&quot; And, feeling that words were powerless to express his
emotions, Ben walked away, looking as grim as a small boy could.</p>

<p>A more unhappy little lass is seldom to be found than Bab was, as she
pattered after him, splashing recklessly through the puddles, and
getting as wet and muddy as possible, as a sort of penance for her sins.
For a mile or two she trudged stoutly along, while Ben marched before in
solemn silence, which soon became both impressive and oppressive because
so unnsual, and such a proof of his deep displeasure. Penitent Bab
longed for just one word, one sign of relenting; and when none came, she
began to wonder how she could possibly bear it if he kept his dreadful
threat and did not speak to her for a whole year.</p>

<p>But presently her own discomfort absorbed her, for her feet were wet and
cold as well as very tired; pop-corn and peanuts were not particularly
nourishing food; and hunger made her feel faint; excitement was a new
thing, and now that it was over she longed to lie down and go to sleep;
then the long walk with a circus at the end seemed a very different
affair from the homeward trip with a distracted mother awaiting her. The
shower had subsided into a dreary drizzle, a chilly east wind blew up,
the hilly road seemed to lengthen before the weary feet, and the mute,
blue flannel figure going on so fast with never a look or sound, added
the last touch to Bab's remorseful anguish.</p>

<p>Wagons passed, but all were full, and no one offered a ride. Men and
boys went by with rough jokes on the forlorn pair, for rain soon made
them look like young tramps. But there was no brave Sancho to resent the
impertinence, and this fact was sadly brought to both their minds by the
appearance of a great Newfoundland dog who came trotting after a
carriage. The good creature stopped to say a friendly word in his dumb
fashion, looking up at Bab with benevolent eyes, and poking his nose
into Ben's hand before he bounded away with his plumy tail curled over
his back.</p>

<p>Ben started as the cold nose touched his fingers, gave the soft head a
lingering pat, and watched the dog out of sight through a thicker mist
than any the rain made. But Bab broke down; for the wistful look of the
creature's eyes reminded her of lost Sancho, and she sobbed quietly as
she glanced back longing to see the dear old fellow jogging along in the
rear.</p>

<p>Ben heard the piteous sound and took a sly peep over his shoulder,
seeing such a mournful spectacle that he felt appeased, saying to
himself as if to excuse his late sternness,  - </p>

<p>&quot;She is a naughty girl, but I guess she is about sorry enough now.  When
we get to that sign-post I'll speak to her, only I won't forgive her
till Sanch comes back.&quot;</p>

<p>But he was better than his word; for, just before the post was reached,
Bab, blinded by tears, tripped over the root of a tree, and, rolling
down the bank, landed in a bed of wet nettles. Ben had her out in a
jiffy, and vainly tried to comfort her; but she was past any consolation
he could offer, and roared dismally as she wrung her tingling hands,
with great drops running over her cheeks almost as fast as the muddy
little rills ran down the road.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, oh dear! I'm all stinged up, and I want my supper; and my feet
ache, and I'm cold, and every thing is so horrid!&quot; wailed the poor child
lying on the grass, such a miserable little wet bunch that the sternest
parent would have melted at the sight.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't cry so, Babby; I was real cross, and I'm sorry.  I'll forgive you
right away now, and never shake you any more,&quot; cried Ben, so full of
pity for her tribulations that he forgot his own, like a generous little
man.</p>

<p>&quot;Shake me again, if you want to; I know I was very bad to tag and lose
Sanch. I never will any more, and I'm so sorry, I don't know what to
do,&quot; answered Bab, completely bowed down by this magnanimity.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind; you just wipe up your face and come along, and we'll tell
Ma all about it, and she'll fix us as nice as can be. I shouldn't wonder
if Sanch got home now before we did,&quot; said Ben, cheering himself as well
as her by the fond hope.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't believe I ever shall.  I'm so tired my legs won't go, and the
water in my boots makes them feel dreadfully. I wish that boy would
wheel me a piece. Don't you s'pose he would? asked Bab, wearily picking
herself up as a tall lad trundling a barrow came out of a yard near by.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo, Joslyn!&quot; said Ben, recognizing the boy as one of the &quot;hill
fellows&quot; who came to town Saturday nights for play or business.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo, Brown!&quot; responded the other, arresting his squeaking progress
with signs of surprise at the moist tableau before him.</p>

<p>&quot;Where goin'?&quot; asked Ben with masculine brevity.</p>

<p>&quot;Got to carry this home, hang the old thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Batchelor's, down yonder,&quot; and the boy pointed to a farm-house at the
foot of the next hill.</p>

<p>&quot;Goin' that way, take it right along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What for?&quot; questioned the prudent youth, distrusting such unusual
neighborliness.</p>

<p>&quot;She's tired, wants a ride; I'll leave it all right, true as I live and
breathe,&quot; explained Ben, half ashamed yet anxious to get his little
responsibility home as soon as possible, for mishaps seemed to thicken.</p>

<p>&quot;Ho, you couldn't cart her all that way! she's most as heavy as a bag of
meal,&quot; jeered the taller lad, amused at the proposition.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm stronger than most fellers of my size. Try, if I ain't,&quot; and Ben
squared off in such scientific style that Joslyn responded with sudden
amiability,  - </p>

<p>&quot;All right, let's see you do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Bab huddled into her new equipage without the least fear, and Ben
trundled her off at a good pace, while the boy retired to the shelter of
a barn to watch their progress, glad to be rid of an irksome errand.</p>

<p>At first, all went well, for the way was down hill, and the wheel
squeaked briskly round and round; Bab smiled gratefully upon her bearer,
and Ben &quot;went in on his muscle with a will,&quot; as he expressed it. But
presently the road grew sandy, began to ascend, and the load seemed to
grow heavier with every step.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll get out now.  It's real nice, but I guess I am too heavy,&quot; said
Bab, as the face before her got redder and redder, and the breath began
to come in puffs.</p>

<p>&quot;Sit still. He said I couldn't.  I'm not going to give in with him
looking on,&quot; panted Ben, and he pushed gallantly up the rise, over the
grassy lawn to the side gate of the Batchelors' door-yard, with his head
down, teeth set, and every muscle of his slender body braced to the
task.</p>

<p>&quot;Did ever ye see the like of that now?  Ah, ha!</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;The streets were so wide, and the lanes were so narry,<br />
 He brought his wife home on a little wheelbarry,&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>sung a voice with an accent which made Ben drop his load and push back
his hat, to see Pat's red head looking over the fence.</p>

<p>To have his enemy behold him then and there was the last bitter drop in
poor Ben's cup of humiliation. A shrill approving whistle from the hill
was some comfort, however, and gave him spirit to help Bab out with
composure, though his hands were blistered and he had hardly breath
enough to issue the Command,  - </p>

<p>&quot;Go along home, and don't mind him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nice childer, ye are, runnin' off this way, settin' the women
distracted, and me wastin' me time comin' after ye when I'd be milkin'
airly so I'd get a bit of pleasure the day,&quot; grumbled Pat, coming up to
untie the Duke, whose Roman nose Ben had already recognized, as well as
the roomy chaise standing before the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Did Billy tell you about us?&quot; asked Bab, gladly following toward this
welcome refuge.</p>

<p>&quot;Faith he did, and the Squire sent me to fetch ye home quiet and aisy. 
When ye found me, I'd jist stopped here to borry a light for me pipe. Up
wid ye, b'y, and not be wastin' me time stramashin' after a spalpeen
that I'd like to lay me whip over,&quot; said Pat, gruffly, as Ben came
along, having left the barrow in the shed.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you wish you could?  You needn't wait for me; I'll come when I'm
ready,&quot; answered Ben dodging round the chaise, bound not to mind Pat, if
he spent the night by the road-side in consequence.</p>

<p>&quot;Bedad, and I won't then.  It's lively ye are; but four legs is better
than two, as ye'll find this night, me young man.&quot;</p>

<p>With that he whipped up and was off before Bab could say a word to
persuade Ben to humble himself for the sake of a ride. She lamented and
Pat chuckled, both forgetting what an agile monkey the boy was, and as
neither looked back, they were unaware Master Ben was hanging on behind
among the straps and springs, making derisive grimaces at his
unconscious foe through the little glass in the leathern back.</p>

<p>At the lodge gate Ben jumped down to run before with whoops of naughty
satisfaction, which brought the anxious waiters to the door in a flock;
so Pat could only shake his fist at the exulting little rascal as he
drove away, leaving the wanderers to be welcomed as warmly as if they
were a pair of model children.</p>

<p>Mrs. Moss had not been very much troubled after all; for Cy had told her
that Bab went after Ben, and Billy had lately reported her safe arrival
among them, so, mother-like, she fed, dried, and warmed the runaways,
before she scolded them.</p>

<p>Even then, the lecture was a mild one, for when they tried to tell the
adventures which to them seemed so exciting, not to say tragical, the
effect astonished them immensely, as their audience went into gales of
laughter, especially at the wheelbarrow episode, which Pat insisted on
telling, with grateful minuteness, to Ben's confusion. Thorny shouted,
and even tender-hearted Betty forgot her tears over the lost dog to
join in the familiar melody when Bab mimicked Pat's quotation from
Mother Goose.</p>

<p>&quot;We must not laugh any more, or these naughty children will think they
have done something very clever in running away,&quot; said Miss Celia, when
the fun subsided, adding, soberly, &quot;I am displeased, but I will say
nothing, for I think Ben is already punished enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guess I am,&quot; muttered Ben, with a choke in his voice as he glanced
toward the empty mat where a dear curly bunch used to be with a bright
eye twinkling out of the middle of it.</p>
