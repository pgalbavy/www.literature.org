<p>WHEN Billy opened his eyes again he could not recall, for the instant,
very much of his recent past. At last he remembered with painful regret
the drunken sailor it had been his intention to roll. He felt deeply
chagrined that his rightful prey should have escaped him. He couldn't
understand how it had happened.
</p>
<p>“This Frisco booze must be something fierce,” thought Billy.
</p><p>His head ached frightfully and he was very sick. So sick that the room
in which he lay seemed to be rising and falling in a horribly realistic
manner. Every time it dropped it brought Billy's stomach nearly to his
mouth.
</p><p>Billy shut his eyes. Still the awful sensation. Billy groaned. He never
had been so sick in all his life before, and, my, how his poor head did
hurt. Finding that it only seemed to make matters worse when he closed
his eyes Billy opened them again.
</p><p>He looked about the room in which he lay. He found it a stuffy hole
filled with bunks in tiers three deep around the sides. In the center of
the room was a table. Above the table a lamp hung suspended from one of
the wooden beams of the ceiling.
</p><p>The lamp arrested Billy's attention. It was swinging back and forth
rather violently. This could not be a hallucination. The room might seem
to be rising and falling, but that lamp could not seem to be swinging
around in any such manner if it were not really and truly swinging. He
couldn't account for it. Again he shut his eyes for a moment. When he
opened them to look again at the lamp he found it still swung as before.
</p><p>Cautiously he slid from his bunk to the floor. It was with difficulty
that he kept his feet. Still that might be but the effects of the
liquor. At last he reached the table to which he clung for support while
he extended one hand toward the lamp.
</p><p>There was no longer any doubt! The lamp was beating back and forth like
the clapper of a great bell. Where was he? Billy sought a window. He
found some little round, glass-covered holes near the low ceiling at one
side of the room. It was only at the greatest risk to life and limb that
he managed to crawl on all fours to one of them.
</p><p>As he straightened up and glanced through he was appalled at the
sight that met his eyes. As far as he could see there was naught but a
tumbling waste of water. And then the truth of what had happened to him
broke upon his understanding.
</p><p>“An' I was goin' to roll that guy!” he muttered in helpless
bewilderment. “I was a-goin' to roll him, and now look here wot he has
done to me!”
</p><p>At that moment a light appeared above as the hatch was raised, and Billy
saw the feet and legs of a large man descending the ladder from above.
When the newcomer reached the floor and turned to look about his eyes
met Billy's, and Billy saw that it was his host of the previous evening.
</p><p>“Well, my hearty, how goes it?” asked the stranger.
</p><p>“You pulled it off pretty slick,” said Billy.
</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked the other with a frown.
</p><p>“Come off,” said Billy; “you know what I mean.”
</p><p>“Look here,” replied the other coldly. “Don't you forget that I'm mate
of this ship, an' that you want to speak respectful to me if you ain't
lookin' for trouble. My name's MR. Ward, an' when you speak to me say
SIR. Understand?”
</p><p>Billy scratched his head, and blinked his eyes. He never before had
been spoken to in any such fashion--at least not since he had put on the
avoirdupois of manhood. His head ached horribly and he was sick to his
stomach--frightfully sick. His mind was more upon his physical suffering
than upon what the mate was saying, so that quite a perceptible interval
of time elapsed before the true dimensions of the affront to his dignity
commenced to percolate into the befogged and pain-racked convolutions of
his brain.
</p><p>The mate thought that his bluster had bluffed the new hand. That was
what he had come below to accomplish. Experience had taught him that an
early lesson in discipline and subordination saved unpleasant encounters
in the future. He also had learned that there is no better time to put
a bluff of this nature across than when the victim is suffering from the
after-effects of whiskey and a drug--mentality, vitality, and courage
are then at their lowest ebb. A brave man often is reduced to the
pitiful condition of a yellow dog when nausea sits astride his stomach.
</p><p>But the mate was not acquainted with Billy Byrne of Kelly's gang.
Billy's brain was befuddled, so that it took some time for an idea to
wriggle its way through, but his courage was all there, and all to the
good. Billy was a mucker, a hoodlum, a gangster, a thug, a tough. When
he fought, his methods would have brought a flush of shame to the face
of His Satanic Majesty. He had hit oftener from behind than from before.
He had always taken every advantage of size and weight and numbers that
he could call to his assistance. He was an insulter of girls and women.
He was a bar-room brawler, and a saloon-corner loafer. He was all that
was dirty, and mean, and contemptible, and cowardly in the eyes of a
brave man, and yet, notwithstanding all this, Billy Byrne was no coward.
He was what he was because of training and environment. He knew no other
methods; no other code. Whatever the meager ethics of his kind he would
have lived up to them to the death. He never had squealed on a pal,
and he never had left a wounded friend to fall into the hands of the
enemy--the police.
</p><p>Nor had he ever let a man speak to him, as the mate had spoken, and get
away with it, and so, while he did not act as quickly as would have been
his wont had his brain been clear, he did act; but the interval of time
had led the mate into an erroneous conception of its cause, and into
a further rash show of authority, and had thrown him off his guard as
well.
</p><p>“What you need,” said the mate, advancing toward Billy, “is a bash on
the beezer. It'll help you remember that you ain't nothin' but a dirty
damn landlubber, an' when your betters come around you'll--”
</p><p>But what Billy would have done in the presence of his betters remained
stillborn in the mate's imagination in the face of what Billy really
did do to his better as that worthy swung a sudden, vicious blow at the
mucker's face.
</p><p>Billy Byrne had not been scrapping with third- and fourth-rate heavies,
and sparring with real, live ones for nothing. The mate's fist whistled
through empty air; the blear-eyed hunk of clay that had seemed such
easy prey to him was metamorphosed on the instant into an alert, catlike
bundle of steel sinews, and Billy Byrne swung that awful right with the
pile-driver weight, that even The Big Smoke himself had acknowledged
respect for, straight to the short ribs of his antagonist.
</p><p>With a screech of surprise and pain the mate crumpled in the far corner
of the forecastle, rammed halfway beneath a bunk by the force of the
terrific blow. Like a tiger Billy Byrne was after him, and dragging the
man out into the center of the floor space he beat and mauled him until
his victim's blood-curdling shrieks echoed through the ship from stem to
stern.
</p><p>When the captain, followed by a half-dozen seamen rushed down the
companionway, he found Billy sitting astride the prostrate form of the
mate. His great fingers circled the man's throat, and with mighty blows
he was dashing the fellow's head against the hard floor. Another moment
and murder would have been complete.
</p><p>“Avast there!” cried the captain, and as though to punctuate his remark
he swung the heavy stick he usually carried full upon the back of
Billy's head. It was that blow that saved the mate's life, for when
Billy came to he found himself in a dark and smelly hole, chained and
padlocked to a heavy stanchion.
</p><p>They kept Billy there for a week; but every day the captain visited him
in an attempt to show him the error of his way. The medium used by the
skipper for impressing his ideas of discipline upon Billy was a large,
hard stick. At the end of the week it was necessary to carry Billy above
to keep the rats from devouring him, for the continued beatings and
starvation had reduced him to little more than an unconscious mass of
raw and bleeding meat.
</p><p>“There,” remarked the skipper, as he viewed his work by the light of
day, “I guess that fellow'll know his place next time an officer an' a
gentleman speaks to him.”
</p><p>That Billy survived is one of the hitherto unrecorded miracles of the
power of matter over mind. A man of intellect, of imagination, a being
of nerves, would have succumbed to the shock alone; but Billy was not as
these. He simply lay still and thoughtless, except for half-formed ideas
of revenge, until Nature, unaided, built up what the captain had so
ruthlessly torn down.
</p><p>Ten days after they brought him up from the hold Billy was limping
about the deck of the Halfmoon doing light manual labor. From the other
sailors aboard he learned that he was not the only member of the crew
who had been shanghaied. Aside from a half-dozen reckless men from the
criminal classes who had signed voluntarily, either because they could
not get a berth upon a decent ship, or desired to flit as quietly from
the law zone of the United States as possible, not a man was there who
had been signed regularly.
</p><p>They were as tough and vicious a lot as Fate ever had foregathered in
one forecastle, and with them Billy Byrne felt perfectly at home. His
early threats of awful vengeance to be wreaked upon the mate and skipper
had subsided with the rough but sensible advice of his messmates. The
mate, for his part, gave no indication of harboring the assault that
Billy had made upon him other than to assign the most dangerous or
disagreeable duties of the ship to the mucker whenever it was possible
to do so; but the result of this was to hasten Billy's nautical
education, and keep him in excellent physical trim.
</p><p>All traces of alcohol had long since vanished from the young man's
system. His face showed the effects of his enforced abstemiousness in
a marked degree. The red, puffy, blotchy complexion had given way to a
clear, tanned skin; bright eyes supplanted the bleary, bloodshot things
that had given the bestial expression to his face in the past. His
features, always regular and strong, had taken on a peculiarly refined
dignity from the salt air, the clean life, and the dangerous occupation
of the deep-sea sailor, that would have put Kelly's gang to a pinch to
have recognized their erstwhile crony had he suddenly appeared in their
midst in the alley back of the feed-store on Grand Avenue.
</p><p>With the new life Billy found himself taking on a new character. He
surprised himself singing at his work--he whose whole life up to now had
been devoted to dodging honest labor--whose motto had been: The
world owes me a living, and it's up to me to collect it. Also, he was
surprised to discover that he liked to work, that he took keen pride in
striving to outdo the men who worked with him, and this spirit, despite
the suspicion which the captain entertained of Billy since the episode
of the forecastle, went far to making his life more endurable on board
the Halfmoon, for workers such as the mucker developed into are not to
be sneezed at, and though he had little idea of subordination it was
worth putting up with something to keep him in condition to work. It was
this line of reasoning that saved Billy's skull on one or two occasions
when his impudence had been sufficient to have provoked the skipper to
a personal assault upon him under ordinary conditions; and Mr. Ward,
having tasted of Billy's medicine once, had no craving for another
encounter with him that would entail personal conflict.
</p><p>The entire crew was made up of ruffians and unhung murderers, but
Skipper Simms had had little experience with seamen of any other ilk,
so he handled them roughshod, using his horny fist, and the short, heavy
stick that he habitually carried, in lieu of argument; but with the
exception of Billy the men all had served before the mast in the past,
so that ship's discipline was to some extent ingrained in them all.
</p><p>Enjoying his work, the life was not an unpleasant one for the mucker.
The men of the forecastle were of the kind he had always known--there
was no honor among them, no virtue, no kindliness, no decency. With them
Billy was at home--he scarcely missed the old gang. He made his friends
among them, and his enemies. He picked quarrels, as had been his way
since childhood. His science and his great strength, together with his
endless stock of underhand tricks brought him out of each encounter
with fresh laurels. Presently he found it difficult to pick a fight--his
messmates had had enough of him. They left him severely alone.
</p><p>These ofttimes bloody battles engendered no deep-seated hatred in the
hearts of the defeated. They were part of the day's work and play of the
half-brutes that Skipper Simms had gathered together. There was only one
man aboard whom Billy really hated. That was the passenger, and Billy
hated him, not because of anything that the man had said or done to
Billy, for he had never even so much as spoken to the mucker, but
because of the fine clothes and superior air which marked him plainly to
Billy as one of that loathed element of society--a gentleman.
</p><p>Billy hated everything that was respectable. He had hated the smug,
self-satisfied merchants of Grand Avenue. He had writhed in torture at
the sight of every shiny, purring automobile that had ever passed him
with its load of well-groomed men and women. A clean, stiff collar
was to Billy as a red rag to a bull. Cleanliness, success, opulence,
decency, spelled but one thing to Billy--physical weakness; and he hated
physical weakness. His idea of indicating strength and manliness lay in
displaying as much of brutality and uncouthness as possible. To assist
a woman over a mud hole would have seemed to Billy an acknowledgement of
pusillanimity--to stick out his foot and trip her so that she sprawled
full length in it, the hall-mark of bluff manliness. And so he hated,
with all the strength of a strong nature, the immaculate, courteous,
well-bred man who paced the deck each day smoking a fragrant cigar after
his meals.
</p><p>Inwardly he wondered what the dude was doing on board such a vessel as
the Halfmoon, and marveled that so weak a thing dared venture among real
men. Billy's contempt caused him to notice the passenger more than he
would have been ready to admit. He saw that the man's face was handsome,
but there was an unpleasant shiftiness to his brown eyes; and then,
entirely outside of his former reasons for hating him, Billy came to
loathe him intuitively, as one who was not to be trusted. Finally his
dislike for the man became an obsession. He haunted, when discipline
permitted, that part of the vessel where he would be most likely to
encounter the object of his wrath, hoping, always hoping, that the
“dude” would give him some slight pretext for “pushing in his mush,” as
Billy would so picturesquely have worded it.
</p><p>He was loitering about the deck for this purpose one evening when he
overheard part of a low-voiced conversation between the object of his
wrath and Skipper Simms--just enough to set him to wondering what was
doing, and to show him that whatever it might be it was crooked and that
the immaculate passenger and Skipper Simms were both “in on it.”
</p><p>He questioned “Bony” Sawyer and “Red” Sanders, but neither had nearly as
much information as Billy himself, and so the Halfmoon came to Honolulu
and lay at anchor some hundred yards from a stanch, trim, white yacht,
and none knew, other than the Halfmoon's officers and her single
passenger, the real mission of the harmless-looking little brigantine.
