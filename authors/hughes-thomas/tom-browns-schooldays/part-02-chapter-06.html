<p>Two years have passed since the events recorded in the last chapter,
and the end of the summer half-year is again drawing on. Martin
has left and gone on a cruise in the South Pacific, in one of
his uncle's ships; the old magpie, as disreputable as ever, his
last bequest to Arthur, lives in the joint study. Arthur is nearly
sixteen, and at the head of the twenty, having gone up the school
at the rate of a form a half-year. East and Tom have been much
more deliberate in their progress, and are only a little way up
the fifth form. Great strapping boys they are, but still thorough
boys, filling about the same place in the house that young Brooke
filled when they were new boys, and much the same sort of fellows.
Constant intercourse with Arthur has done much for both of them,
especially for Tom; but much remains yet to be done, if they are
to get all the good out of Rugby which is to be got there in these
times. Arthur is still frail and delicate, with more spirit than
body; but, thanks to his intimacy with them and Martin, has learned
to swim, and run, and play cricket, and has never hurt himself
by too much reading.</p>

<p>One evening, as they were all sitting down to supper in the fifth-form
room, some one started a report that a fever had broken out at
one of the boarding-houses. "They say," he added, "that Thompson
is very ill, and that Dr. Robertson has been sent for from Northampton."</p>

<p>"Then we shall all be sent home," cried another. "Hurrah! five
weeks' extra holidays, and no fifth-form examination!"</p>

<p>"I hope not," said Tom; "there'll be no Marylebone match then
at the end of the half."</p>

<p>Some thought one thing, some another, many didn't believe the
report; but the next day, Tuesday, Dr. Robertson arrived, and
stayed all day, and had long conferences with the Doctor.</p>

<p>On Wednesday morning, after prayers, the Doctor addressed the
whole school. There were several cases of fever in different houses,
he said; but Dr. Robertson, after the most careful examination,
had assured him that it was not infectious, and that if proper
care were taken, there could be no reason for stopping the school-work
at present. The examinations were just coming on, and it would
be very unadvisable to break up now. However, any boys who chose
to do so were at liberty to write home, and, if their parents
wished it, to leave at once. He should send the whole school home
if the fever spread.</p>

<p>The next day Arthur sickened, but there was no other case. Before
the end of the week thirty or forty boys had gone, but the rest
stayed on. There was a general wish to please the Doctor, and
a feeling that it was cowardly to run away.</p>

<p>On the Saturday Thompson died, in the bright afternoon, while
the cricket-match was going on as usual on the big-side ground.
The Doctor, coming from his deathbed, passed along the gravel-walk
at the side of the close, but no one knew what had happened till
the next day. At morning lecture it began to be rumoured, and
by afternoon chapel was known generally; and a feeling of seriousness
and awe at the actual presence of death among them came over the
whole school. In all the long years of his ministry the Doctor
perhaps never spoke words which sank deeper than some of those
in that day's sermon.</p>

<p>"When I came yesterday from visiting all but the very death-bed
of him who has been taken from us, and looked around upon all
the familiar objects and scenes within our own ground, where your
common amusements were going on with your common cheerfulness
and activity, I felt there was nothing painful in witnessing that;
it did not seem in any way shocking or out of tune with those
feelings which the sight of a dying Christian must be supposed
to awaken. The unsuitableness in point of natural feeling between
scenes of mourning and scenes of liveliness did not at all present
itself. But I did feel that if at that moment any of those faults
had been brought before me which sometimes occur amongst us; had
I heard that any of you had been guilty of falsehood, or of drunkenness,
or of any other such sin; had I heard from any quarter the language
of profaneness, or of unkindness, or of indecency; had I heard
or seen any signs of that wretched folly which courts the laugh
of fools by affecting not to dread evil and not to care for good,
then the unsuitableness of any of these things with the scene
I had just quitted would indeed have been most intensely painful.
And why? Not because such things would really have been worse
than at any other time, but because at such a moment the eyes
are opened really to know good and evil, because we then feel
what it is so to live as that death becomes an infinite blessing,
and what it is so to live also that it were good for us if we
had never been born."</p>

<p>Tom had gone into chapel in sickening anxiety about Arthur, but
he came out cheered and strengthened by those grand words, and
walked up alone to their study. And when he sat down and looked
round, and saw Arthur's straw hat and cricket-jacket hanging on
their pegs, and marked all his little neat arrangements, not one
of which had been disturbed, the tears indeed rolled down his
cheeks; but they were calm and blessed tears, and he repeated
to himself, "Yes, Geordie's eyes are opened; he knows what it
is so to live as that death becomes an infinite blessing. But
do I? O God, can I bear to lose him?"</p>

<p>The week passed mournfully away. No more boys sickened, but Arthur
was reported worse each day, and his mother arrived early in the
week. Tom made many appeals to be allowed to see him, and several
times tried to get up to the sick-room; but the housekeeper was
always in the way, and at last spoke to the Doctor, who kindly
but peremptorily forbade him.</p>

<p>Thompson was buried on the Tuesday, and the burial service, so
soothing and grand always, but beyond all words solemn when read
over a boy's grave to his companions, brought him much comfort,
and many strange new thoughts and longings. He went back to his
regular life, and played cricket and bathed as usual. It seemed
to him that this was the right thing to do, and the new thoughts
and longings became more brave and healthy for the effort. The
crisis came on Saturday; the day week that Thompson had died;
and during that long afternoon Tom sat in his study reading his
Bible, and going every half-hour to the housekeeper's room, expecting
each time to hear that the gentle and brave little spirit had
gone home. But God had work for Arthur to do. The crisis passed:
on Sunday evening he was declared out of danger; on Monday he
sent a message to Tom that he was almost well, had changed his
room, and was to be allowed to see him the next day.</p>

<p>It was evening when the housekeeper summoned him to the sick-room.
Arthur was lying on the sofa by the open window, through which
the rays of the western sun stole gently, lighting up his white
face and golden hair. Tom remembered a German picture of an angel
which he knew; often had he thought how transparent and golden
and spirit-like it was; and he shuddered, to think how like it
Arthur looked, and felt a shock as if his blood had all stopped
short, as he realized how near the other world his friend must
have been to look like that. Never till that moment had he felt
how his little chum had twined himself round his heart-strings,
and as he stole gently across the room and knelt down, and put
his arm round Arthur's head on the pillow, felt ashamed and half-angry
at his own red and brown face, and the bounding sense of health
and power which filled every fibre of his body, and made every
movement of mere living a joy to him. He needn't have troubled
himself: it was this very strength and power so different from
his own which drew Arthur so to him.</p>

<p>Arthur laid his thin, white hand, on which the blue veins stood
out so plainly, on Tom's great brown fist, and smiled at him;
and then looked out of the window again, as if he couldn't bear
to lose a moment of the sunset, into the tops of the great feathery
elms, round which the rooks were circling and clanging, returning
in flocks from their evening's foraging parties. The elms rustled,
the sparrows in the ivy just outside the window chirped and fluttered
about, quarrelling, and making it up again; the rooks, young and
old, talked in chorus, and the merry shouts of the boys and the
sweet click of the cricket-bats came up cheerily from below.</p>

<p>"Dear George," said Tom, "I am so glad to be let up to see you
at last. I've tried hard to come so often, but they wouldn't let
me before."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, Tom; Mary has told me every day about you, and how
she was obliged to make the Doctor speak to you to keep you away.
I'm very glad you didn't get up, for you might have caught it;
and you couldn't stand being ill, with all the matches going on.
And you're in the eleven, too, I hear. I'm so glad."</p>

<p>"Yes; ain't it jolly?" said Tom proudly. "I'm ninth too. I made
forty at the last pie-match, and caught three fellows out. So
I was put in above Jones and Tucker. Tucker's so savage, for he
was head of the twenty-two."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you ought to be higher yet," said Arthur, who
was as jealous for the renown of Tom in games as Tom was for his
as a scholar.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I don't care about cricket or anything now you're
getting well, Geordie; and I shouldn't have hurt, I know, if they'd
have let me come up. Nothing hurts me. But you'll get about now
directly, won't you? You won't believe how clean I've kept the
study. All your things are just as you left them; and I feed the
old magpie just when you used, though I have to come in from big-side
for him, the old rip. He won't look pleased all I can do, and
sticks his head first on one side and then on the other, and blinks
at me before he'll begin to eat, till I'm half inclined to box
his ears. And whenever East comes in, you should see him hop off
to the window, dot and go one, though Harry wouldn't touch a feather
of him now."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed. "Old Gravey has a good memory; he can't forget
the sieges of poor Martin's den in old times." He paused a moment,
and then went on: "You can't think how often I've been thinking
of old Martin since I've been ill. I suppose one's mind gets restless,
and likes to wander off to strange, unknown places. I wonder what
queer new pets the old boy has got. How he must be revelling in
the thousand new birds, beasts, and fishes!"</p>

<p>Tom felt a pang of jealousy, but kicked it out in a moment. "Fancy
him on a South Sea island, with the Cherokees, or Patagonians,
or some such wild niggers!" (Tom's ethnology and geography were
faulty, but sufficient for his needs.) "They'll make the old Madman
cock medicine-man, and tattoo him all over. Perhaps he's cutting
about now all blue, and has a squaw and a wigwam. He'll improve
their boomerangs, and be able to throw them too, without having
old Thomas sent after him by the Doctor to take them away."</p>

<p>Arthur laughed at the remembrance of the boomerang story, but
then looked grave again, and said, "He'll convert all the island,
I know."</p>

<p>"Yes, if he don't blow it up first."</p>

<p>"Do you remember, Tom, how you and East used to laugh at him
and chaff him, because he said he was sure the rooks all had calling-over
or prayers, or something of the sort, when the locking-up bell
rang? Well, I declare," said Arthur, looking up seriously into
Tom's laughing eyes, "I do think he was right. Since I've been
lying here, I've watched them every night; and, do you know, they
really do come and perch, all of them, just about locking-up time;
and then first there's a regular chorus of caws; and then they
stop a bit, and one old fellow, or perhaps two or three in different
trees, caw solos; and then off they all go again, fluttering about
and cawing anyhow till they roost."</p>

<p>"I wonder if the old blackies do talk," said Tom, looking up
at them. "How they must abuse me and East, and pray for the Doctor
for stopping the slinging!"</p>

<p>"There! look, look!" cried Arthur; "don't you see the old fellow
without a tail coming up? Martin used to call him the 'clerk.'
He can't steer himself. You never saw such fun as he is in a high
wind, when he can't steer himself home, and gets carried right
past the trees, and has to bear up again and again before he can
perch."</p>

<p>The locking-up bell began to toll, and the two boys were silent,
and listened to it. The sound soon carried Tom off to the river
and the woods, and he began to go over in his mind the many occasions
on which he had heard that toll coming faintly down the breeze,
and had to pack his rod in a hurry and make a run for it, to get
in before the gates were shut. He was roused with a start from
his memories by Arthur's voice, gentle and weak from his late
illness.</p>

<p>"Tom, will you be angry if I talk to you very seriously?"</p>

<p>"No, dear old boy, not I. But ain't you faint, Arthur, or ill?
What can I get you? Don't say anything to hurt yourself now&mdash;you
are very weak; let me come up again."</p>

<p>"No, no; I shan't hurt myself. I'd sooner speak to you now, if
you don't mind. I've asked Mary to tell the Doctor that you are
with me, so you needn't go down to calling-over; and I mayn't
have another chance, for I shall most likely have to go home for
change of air to get well, and mayn't come back this half."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think you must go away before the end of the half?
I'm so sorry. It's more than five weeks yet to the holidays, and
all the fifth-form examination and half the cricket-matches to
come yet. And what shall I do all that time alone in our study?
Why, Arthur, it will be more than twelve weeks before I see you
again. Oh, hang it, I can't stand that! Besides who's to keep
me up to working at the examination books? I shall come out bottom
of the form, as sure as eggs is eggs."</p>

<p>Tom was rattling on, half in joke, half in earnest, for he wanted
to get Arthur out of his serious vein, thinking it would do him
harm; but Arthur broke in,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, please, Tom, stop, or you'll drive all I had to say out
of my head. And I'm already horribly afraid I'm going to make
you angry."</p>

<p>"Don't gammon, young un," rejoined Tom (the use of the old name,
dear to him from old recollections, made Arthur start and smile
and feel quite happy); "you know you ain't afraid, and you've
never made me angry since the first month we chummed together.
Now I'm going to be quite sober for a quarter of an hour, which
is more than I am once in a year; so make the most of it; heave
ahead, and pitch into me right and left."</p>

<p>"Dear Tom, I ain't going to pitch into you," said Arthur piteously;
"and it seems so cocky in me to be advising you, who've been my
backbone ever since I've been at Rugby, and have made the school
a paradise to me. Ah, I see I shall never do it, unless I go head
over heels at once, as you said when you taught me to swim. Tom,
I want you to give up using vulgus-books and cribs."</p>

<p>Arthur sank back on to his pillow with a sigh, as if the effort
had been great; but the worst was now over, and he looked straight
at Tom, who was evidently taken aback. He leant his elbows on
his knees, and stuck his hands into his hair, whistled a verse
of "Billy Taylor," and then was quite silent for another minute.
Not a shade crossed his face, but he was clearly puzzled. At last
he looked up, and caught Arthur's anxious look, took his hand,
and said simply,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, young un?"</p>

<p>"Because you're the honestest boy in Rugby, and that ain't honest."</p>

<p>"I don't see that."</p>

<p>"What were you sent to Rugby for?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know exactly&mdash;nobody ever told me. I suppose because
all boys are sent to a public school in England."</p>

<p>"But what do you think yourself? What do you want to do here,
and to carry away?"</p>

<p>Tom thought a minute. "I want to be A1 at cricket and football,
and all the other games, and to make my hands keep my head against
any fellow, lout or gentleman. I want to get into the sixth before
I leave, and to please the Doctor; and I want to carry away just
as much Latin and Greek as will take me through Oxford respectably.
There, now, young un; I never thought of it before, but that's
pretty much about my figure. Ain't it all on the square? What
have you got to say to that?"</p>

<p>"Why, that you are pretty sure to do all that you want, then."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope so. But you've forgot one thing&mdash;what I want to
leave behind me. I want to leave behind me," said Tom, speaking
slow, and looking much moved, "the name of a fellow who never
bullied a little boy, or turned his back on a big one."</p>

<p>Arthur pressed his hand, and after a moment's silence went on,
"You say, Tom, you want to please the Doctor. Now, do you want
to please him by what he thinks you do, or by what you really
do?"</p>

<p>"By what I really do, of course."</p>

<p>"Does he think you use cribs and vulgus-books?"</p>

<p>Tom felt at once that his flank was turned, but he couldn't give
in. "He was at Winchester himself," said he; "he knows all about
it."</p>

<p>"Yes; but does he think you use them? Do you think he approves
of it?"</p>

<p>"You young villain!" said Tom, shaking his fist at Arthur, half
vexed and half pleased, "I never think about it. Hang it! there,
perhaps he don't. Well, I suppose he don't."</p>

<p>Arthur saw that he had got his point; he knew his friend well,
and was wise in silence as in speech. He only said, "I would sooner
have the doctor's good opinion of me as I really am than any man's
in the world."</p>

<p>After another minute, Tom began again, "Look here, young un.
How on earth am I to get time to play the matches this half if
I give up cribs? We're in the middle of that long crabbed chorus
in the Agamemnon. I can only just make head or tail of it with
the crib. Then there's Pericles's speech coming on in Thucydides,
and 'The Birds' to get up for the examination, besides the Tacitus."
Tom groaned at the thought of his accumulated labours. "I say,
young un, there's only five weeks or so left to holidays. Mayn't
I go on as usual for this half? I'll tell the Doctor about it
some day, or you may."</p>

<p>Arthur looked out of the window. The twilight had come on, and
all was silent. He repeated in a low voice: "In this thing the
Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house
of Rimmon to worship there, and he leaneth on my hand, and I bow
down myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow down myself in
the house of Rimmon, the Lord pardon thy servant in this thing."</p>

<p>Not a word more was said on the subject, and the boys were again
silent&mdash;one of those blessed, short silences in which the resolves
which colour a life are so often taken.</p>

<p>Tom was the first to break it. "You've been very ill indeed,
haven't you, Geordie?" said he, with a mixture of awe and curiosity,
feeling as if his friend had been in some strange place or scene,
of which he could form no idea, and full of the memory of his
own thoughts during the last week.</p>

<p>"Yes, very. I'm sure the Doctor thought I was going to die. He
gave me the Sacrament last Sunday, and you can't think what he
is when one is ill. He said such brave, and tender, and gentle
things to me, I felt quite light and strong after it, and never
had any more fear. My mother brought our old medical man, who
attended me when I was a poor sickly child. He said my constitution
was quite changed, and that I'm fit for anything now. If it hadn't,
I couldn't have stood three days of this illness. That's all thanks
to you, and the games you've made me fond of."</p>

<p>"More thanks to old Martin," said Tom; "he's been your real friend."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Tom; he never could have done for me what you have."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know; I did little enough. Did they tell you&mdash;you
won't mind hearing it now, I know&mdash;that poor Thompson died last
week? The other three boys are getting quite round, like you."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I heard of it."</p>

<p>Then Tom, who was quite full of it, told Arthur of the burial-service
in the chapel, and how it had impressed him, and, he believed,
all the other boys. "And though the Doctor never said a word about
it," said he, "and it was a half-holiday and match-day, there
wasn't a game played in the close all the afternoon, and the boys
all went about as if it were Sunday."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad of it," said Arthur. "But, Tom, I've had such
strange thoughts about death lately. I've never told a soul of
them, not even my mother. Sometimes I think they're wrong, but,
do you know, I don't think in my heart I could be sorry at the
death of any of my friends."</p>

<p>Tom was taken quite aback. "What in the world is the young un
after now?" thought he; "I've swallowed a good many of his crotchets,
but this altogether beats me. He can't be quite right in his head."
He didn't want to say a word, and shifted about uneasily in the
dark; however, Arthur seemed to be waiting for an answer, so at
last he said, "I don't think I quite see what you mean, Geordie.
One's told so often to think about death that I've tried it on
sometimes, especially this last week. But we won't talk of it
now. I'd better go. You're getting tired, and I shall do you harm."</p>

<p>"No, no; indeed I ain't, Tom. You must stop till nine; there's
only twenty minutes. I've settled you shall stop till nine. And
oh! do let me talk to you &mdash;I must talk to you. I see it's
just as I feared. You think I'm half mad. Don't you, now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I did think it odd what you said, Geordie, as you ask
me."</p>

<p>Arthur paused a moment, and then said quickly, "I'll tell you
how it all happened. At first, when I was sent to the sick-room,
and found I had really got the fever, I was terribly frightened.
I thought I should die, and I could not face it for a moment.
I don't think it was sheer cowardice at first, but I thought how
hard it was to be taken away from my mother and sisters and you
all, just as I was beginning to see my way to many things, and
to feel that I might be a man and do a man's work. To die without
having fought, and worked, and given one's life away, was too
hard to bear. I got terribly impatient, and accused God of injustice,
and strove to justify myself. And the harder I strove the deeper
I sank. Then the image of my dear father often came across me,
but I turned from it. Whenever it came, a heavy, numbing throb
seemed to take hold of my heart, and say, 'Dead-dead-dead.' And
I cried out, 'The living, the living shall praise Thee, O God;
the dead cannot praise thee. There is no work in the grave; in
the night no man can work. But I can work. I can do great things.
I will do great things. Why wilt thou slay me?' And so I struggled
and plunged, deeper and deeper, and went down into a living black
tomb. I was alone there, with no power to stir or think; alone
with myself; beyond the reach of all human fellowship; beyond
Christ's reach, I thought, in my nightmare. You, who are brave
and bright and strong, can have no idea of that agony. Pray to
God you never may. Pray as for your life."</p>

<p>Arthur stopped&mdash;from exhaustion, Tom thought; but what between
his fear lest Arthur should hurt himself, his awe, and his longing
for him to go on, he couldn't ask, or stir to help him.</p>

<p>Presently he went on, but quite calm and slow. "I don't know
how long I was in that state&mdash;for more than a day, I know; for
I was quite conscious, and lived my outer life all the time, and
took my medicines, and spoke to my mother, and heard what they
said. But I didn't take much note of time. I thought time was
over for me, and that that tomb was what was beyond. Well, on
last Sunday morning, as I seemed to lie in that tomb, alone, as
I thought, for ever and ever, the black, dead wall was cleft in
two, and I was caught up and borne through into the light by some
great power, some living, mighty spirit. Tom, do you remember
the living creatures and the wheels in Ezekiel? It was just like
that. 'When they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like
the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice
of speech, as the noise of an host; when they stood, they let
down their wings.' 'And they went every one straight forward:
whither the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when
they went.' And we rushed through the bright air, which was full
of myriads of living creatures, and paused on the brink of a great
river. And the power held me up, and I knew that that great river
was the grave, and death dwelt there, but not the death I had
met in the black tomb. That, I felt, was gone for ever. For on
the other bank of the great river I saw men and women and children
rising up pure and bright, and the tears were wiped from their
eyes, and they put on glory and strength, and all weariness and
pain fell away. And beyond were a multitude which no man could
number, and they worked at some great work; and they who rose
from the river went on and joined in the work. They all worked,
and each worked in a different way, but all at the same work.
And I saw there my father, and the men in the old town whom I
knew when I was a child&mdash;many a hard, stern man, who never came
to church, and whom they called atheist and infidel. There they
were, side by side with my father, whom I had seen toil and die
for them, and women and little children, and the seal was on the
foreheads of all. And I longed to see what the work was, and could
not; so I tried to plunge in the river, for I thought I would
join them, but I could not. Then I looked about to see how they
got into the river. And this I could not see, but I saw myriads
on this side, and they too worked, and I knew that it was the
same work, and the same seal was on their foreheads. And though
I saw that there was toil and anguish in the work of these, and
that most that were working were blind and feeble, yet I longed
no more to plunge into the river, but more and more to know what
the work was. And as I looked I saw my mother and my sisters,
and I saw the Doctor, and you, Tom, and hundreds more whom I knew;
and at last I saw myself too, and I was toiling and doing ever
so little a piece of the great work. Then it all melted away,
and the power left me, and as it left me I thought I heard a voice
say, 'The vision is for an appointed time; though it tarry, wait
for it, for in the end it shall speak and not lie, it shall surely
come, it shall not tarry.' It was early morning I know, then&mdash;it
was so quiet and cool, and my mother was fast asleep in the chair
by my bedside; but it wasn't only a dream of mine. I know it wasn't
a dream. Then I fell into a deep sleep, and only woke after afternoon
chapel; and the Doctor came and gave me the Sacrament, as I told
you. I told him and my mother I should get well &mdash;I knew
I should; but I couldn't tell them why. Tom," said Arthur gently,
after another minute, "do you see why I could not grieve now to
see my dearest friend die? It can't be&mdash;it isn't&mdash;all fever or
illness. God would never have let me see it so clear if it wasn't
true. I don't understand it all yet; it will take me my life and
longer to do that&mdash;to find out what the work is."</p>

<p>When Arthur stopped there was a long pause. Tom could not speak;
he was almost afraid to breathe, lest he should break the train
of Arthur's thoughts. He longed to hear more, and to ask questions.
In another minute nine o'clock struck, and a gentle tap at the
door called them both back into the world again. They did not
answer, however, for a moment; and so the door opened, and a lady
came in carrying a candle.</p>

<p>She went straight to the sofa, and took hold of Arthur's hand,
and then stooped down and kissed him.</p>

<p>"My dearest boy, you feel a little feverish again. Why didn't
you have lights? You've talked too much, and excited yourself
in the dark."</p>

<p>"Oh no, mother; you can't think how well I feel. I shall start
with you to-morrow for Devonshire. But, mother, here's my friend&mdash;here's
Tom Brown. You know him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; I've known him for years," she said, and held out
her hand to Tom, who was now standing up behind the sofa. This
was Arthur's mother: tall and slight and fair, with masses of
golden hair drawn back from the broad, white forehead, and the
calm blue eye meeting his so deep and open&mdash;the eye that he knew
so well, for it was his friend's over again, and the lovely, tender
mouth that trembled while he looked&mdash;she stood there, a woman
of thirty-eight, old enough to be his mother, and one whose face
showed the lines which must be written on the faces of good men's
wives and widows, but he thought he had never seen anything so
beautiful. He couldn't help wondering if Arthur's sisters were
like her.</p>

<p>Tom held her hand, and looked on straight in her face; he could
neither let it go nor speak.</p>

<p>"Now, Tom," said Arthur, laughing, "where are your manners? You'll
stare my mother out of countenance." Tom dropped the little hand
with a sigh. "There, sit down, both of you. &mdash;Here, dearest
mother; there's room here." And he made a place on the sofa for
her.&mdash;"Tom, you needn't go; I'm sure you won't be called up at
first lesson." Tom felt that he would risk being floored at every
lesson for the rest of his natural school-life sooner than go,
so sat down. "And now," said Arthur, "I have realized one of the
dearest wishes of my life&mdash;to see you two together."</p>

<p>And then he led away the talk to their home in Devonshire, and
the red, bright earth, and the deep green combes, and the peat
streams like cairngorm pebbles, and the wild moor with its high,
cloudy tors for a giant background to the picture, till Tom got
jealous, and stood up for the clear chalk streams, and the emerald
water meadows and great elms and willows of the dear old royal
county, as he gloried to call it. And the mother sat on quiet
and loving, rejoicing in their life. The quarter to ten struck,
and the bell rang for bed, before they had well begun their talk,
as it seemed.</p>

<p>Then Tom rose with a sigh to go.</p>

<p>"Shall I see you in the morning, Geordie?" said he, as he shook
his friend's hand. "Never mind, though; you'll be back next half.
And I shan't forget the house of Rimmon."</p>

<p>Arthur's mother got up and walked with him to the door, and there
gave him her hand again; and again his eyes met that deep, loving
look, which was like a spell upon him. Her voice trembled slightly
as she said, "Good-night. You are one who knows what our Father
has promised to the friend of the widow and the fatherless. May
He deal with you as you have dealt with me and mine!"</p>

<p>Tom was quite upset; he mumbled something about owing everything
good in him to Geordie, looked in her face again, pressed her
hand to his lips, and rushed downstairs to his study, where he
sat till old Thomas came kicking at the door, to tell him his
allowance would be stopped if he didn't go off to bed. (It would
have been stopped anyhow, but that he was a great favourite with
the old gentleman, who loved to come out in the afternoons into
the close to Tom's wicket, and bowl slow twisters to him, and
talk of the glories of bygone Surrey heroes, with whom he had
played former generations.) So Tom roused himself, and took up
his candle to go to bed; and then for the first time was aware
of a beautiful new fishing-rod, with old Eton's mark on it, and
a splendidly-bound Bible, which lay on his table, on the title-page
of which was written&mdash;"<em>TOM BROWN, </em>from his affectionate
and grateful friends, Frances Jane Arthur; George Arthur."</p>

<p>I leave you all to guess how he slept, and what he dreamt of.</p>
