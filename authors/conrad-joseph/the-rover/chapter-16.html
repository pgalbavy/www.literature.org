<p>Astern of the tartane, the sun, about to set, kindled a streak
of dull crimson glow between the darkening sea and the overcast
sky. The peninsula of Giens and the islands of Hyères formed one
mass of land detaching itself very black against the fiery girdle
of the horizon; but to the north the long stretch of the Alpine
coast continued beyond sight its endless sinuosities under the
stooping clouds.</p>

<p>The tartane seemed to be rushing together with the run of the
waves into the arms of the oncoming night. A little more than
a mile away on her lee quarter, the <em>Amelia</em>, under all
plain sail, pressed to the end of the chase. It had lasted now
for a good many hours, for Peyrol, when slipping away, had managed
to get the advantage of the <em>Amelia</em> from the very start.
While still within the large sheet of smooth water which is called
the Hyères Roadstead, the tartane, which was really a craft of
extraordinary speed, managed to gain positively on the sloop.
Afterwards, by suddenly darting down the eastern passage between
the two last islands of the group, Peyrol actually got out of
sight of the chasing ship, being hidden by the Ile du Levant for
a time. The <em>Amelia</em>, having to tack twice in order to
follow, lost ground once more. Emerging into the open sea, she
had to tack again, and then the position became that of a stern
chase, which proverbially is known as a long chase. Peyrol’s skilful
seamanship had twice extracted from Captain Vincent a low murmur
accompanied by a significant compression of lips. At one time
the <em>Amelia</em> had been near enough the tartane to send a
shot ahead of her. That one was followed by another, which whizzed
extraordinarily close to the mastheads, but then Captain Vincent
ordered the gun to be secured again. He said to his first lieutenant,
who, his speaking-trumpet in hand, kept at his elbow: "We must
not sink that craft on any account. If we could get only an hour’s
calm, we would carry her with the boats."</p>

<p>The lieutenant remarked that there was no hope of a calm for
the next twenty-four hours at least.</p>

<p>"No," said Captain Vincent, "and in about an hour it will be
dark, and then he may very well give us the slip. The coast is
not very far off and there are batteries on both sides of Fréjus,
under any of which he will be as safe from capture as though he
were hove up on the beach. And look," he exclaimed after a moment’s
pause, "this is what the fellow means to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the lieutenant, keeping his eyes on the white
speck ahead, dancing lightly on the short Mediterranean waves,
"he is keeping off the wind."</p>

<p>"We will have him in less than an hour," said Captain Vincent,
and made as if he meant to rub his hands, but suddenly leaned
his elbow on the rail. "After all," he went on, "properly speaking,
it is a race between the <em>Amelia</em> and the night."</p>

<p>"And it will be dark early to-day," said the first lieutenant,
swinging the speaking-trumpet by its lanyard. "Shall we take the
yards off the backstays, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Captain Vincent. "There is a clever seaman aboard
that tartane. He is running off now, but at any time he may haul
up again. We must not follow him too closely, or we shall lose
the advantage which we have now. That man is determined on making
his escape."</p>

<p>If those words by some miracle could have been carried to the
ears of Peyrol, they would have brought to his lips a smile of
malicious and triumphant exultation. Ever since he had laid his
hand on the tiller of the tartane every faculty of his resourcefulness
and seamanship had been bent on deceiving the English captain,
that enemy whom he had never seen, the man whose mind he had constructed
for himself from the evolutions of his ship. Leaning against the
heavy tiller he addressed Michel, breaking the silence of the
strenuous afternoon.</p>

<p>"This is the moment," his deep voice uttered quietly. "Ease off
the mainsheet, Michel. A little now, only."</p>

<p>When Michel returned to the place where he had been sitting to
windward, the rover noticed his eyes fixed on his face wonderingly.
Some vague thoughts had been forming themselves slowly, incompletely,
in Michel’s brain. Peyrol met the utter innocence of the unspoken
inquiry with a smile that, beginning sardonically on his manly
and sensitive mouth, ended in something resembling tenderness.</p>

<p>"That’s so, camarade," he said with particular stress and intonation,
as if those words contained a full and sufficient answer. Most
unexpectedly Michel’s round and generally staring eyes blinked,
as if dazzled. He too produced from somewhere in the depths of
his being a queer, misty smile from which Peyrol averted his gaze.</p>

<p>"Where is the citizen?" he asked, bearing hard against the tiller
and staring straight ahead. "He isn’t gone overboard, is he? I
don’t seem to have seen him since we rounded the land near Porquerolles
Castle."</p>

<p>Michel, after craning his head forward to look over the edge
of the deck, announced that Scevola was sitting on the keelson.</p>

<p>"Go forward," said Peyrol, "and ease off the foresheet now a
little. This tartane has wings," he added to himself.</p>

<p>Alone on the after-deck Peyrol turned his head to look at the
<em>Amelia</em>. That ship, in consequence of holding her wind,
was now crossing obliquely the wake of the tartane. At the same
time she had diminished the distance. Nevertheless, Peyrol considered
that had he really meant to escape, his chances were as eight
to ten&mdash;practically an assured success. For a long time he had
been contemplating the lofty pyramid of canvas towering against
the fading red belt on the sky, when a lamentable groan made him
look round. It was Scevola. The citizen had adopted the mode of
progression on all fours, and while Peyrol looked at him he rolled
to leeward, saved himself rather cleverly from going overboard,
and holding on desperately to a cleat, shouted in a hollow voice,
pointing with the other hand as if he had made a tremendous discovery:
"La terre! La terre!"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Peyrol, steering with extreme nicety. "What
of that?"</p>

<p>"I don’t want to be drowned!" cried the citizen in his new hollow
voice. Peyrol reflected a bit before he spoke in a serious tone:</p>

<p>"If you stay where you are, I assure you that you will ..." he
glanced rapidly over his shoulder at the <em>Amelia</em> ... "not
die by drowning." He jerked his head sideways. "I know that man’s
mind."</p>

<p>"What man? Whose mind?" yelled Scevola with intense eagerness
and bewilderment. "We are only three on board."</p>

<p>But Peyrol’s mind was contemplating maliciously the figure of
a man with long teeth, in a wig and with large buckles to his
shoes. Such was his ideal conception of what the captain of the
<em>Amelia</em> ought to look like. That officer, whose naturally
good-humoured face wore then a look of severe resolution, had
beckoned his first lieutenant to his side again.</p>

<p>"We are gaining," he said quietly. "I intend to close with him
to windward. We won’t risk any of his tricks. It is very difficult
to outmanœuvre a Frenchman, as you know. Send a few armed marines
on the forecastle ahead. I am afraid the only way to get hold
of this tartane is to disable the men on board of her. I wish
to goodness I could think of some other. When we close with her,
let the marines fire a well-aimed volley. You must get some marines
to stand by aft as well. I hope we may shoot away his halliards;
once his sails are down on his deck he is ours for the trouble
of putting a boat over the side."</p>

<p>For more than half an hour Captain Vincent stood silent, elbow
on rail, keeping his eye on the tartane, while on board the latter
Peyrol steered silent and watchful but intensely conscious of
the enemy ship holding on in her relentless pursuit. The narrow
red band was dying out of the sky. The French coast, black against
the fading light, merged into the shadows gathering in the eastern
board. Citizen Scevola, somewhat soothed by the assurance that
he would not die by drowning, had elected to remain quiet where
he had fallen, not daring to trust himself to move on the lively
deck. Michel, squatting to windward, gazed intently at Peyrol
in expectation of some order at any minute. But Peyrol uttered
no word and made no sign. From time to time a burst of foam flew
over the tartane, or a splash of water would come aboard with
a scurrying noise.</p>

<p>It was not till the corvette had got within a long gunshot from
the tartane that Peyrol opened his mouth.</p>

<p>"No!" he burst out, loud in the wind, as if giving vent to long
anxious thinking, "no! I could not have left you behind with not
even a dog for company. Devil take me if I don’t think you would
not have thanked me for it either. What do you say to that, Michel?"</p>

<p>A half-puzzled smile dwelt persistently on the guileless countenance
of the ex-fisherman. He stated what he had always thought in respect
of Peyrol’s every remark: "I think you are right, maître."</p>

<p>"Listen then, Michel. That ship will be alongside of us in less
than half an hour. As she comes up they will open on us with musketry."</p>

<p>"They will open on us ..." repeated Michel, looking quite interested.
"But how do you know they will do that, maître?"</p>

<p>"Because her captain has got to obey what is in my mind," said
Peyrol, in a tone of positive and solemn conviction. "He will
do it as sure as if I were at his ear telling him what to do.
He will do it because he is a first-rate seaman, but I, Michel,
I am just a little bit cleverer than he." He glanced over his
shoulder at the <em>Amelia</em> rushing after the tartane with
swelling sails, and raised his voice suddenly. "He will do it
because no more than half a mile ahead of us is the spot where
Peyrol will die!"</p>

<p>Michel did not start. He only shut his eyes for a time, and the
rover continued in a lower tone:</p>

<p>"I may be shot through the heart at once," he said; "and in that
case you have my permission to let go the halliards if you are
alive yourself. But if I live I mean to put the helm down. When
I do that you will let go the foresheet to help the tartane to
fly into the wind’s eye. This is my last order to you. Now go
forward and fear nothing. Adieu." Michel obeyed without a word.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the <em>Amelia’s</em> marines stood ranged on
the forecastle-head ready with their muskets. Captain Vincent
walked into the lee waist to watch his chase. When he thought
that the jibboom of the <em>Amelia</em> had drawn level with the
stern of the tartane he waved his hat and the marines discharged
their muskets. Apparently no gear was cut. Captain Vincent observed
the white-headed man, who was steering, clap his hand to his left
side, while he hove the tiller to leeward and brought the tartane
sharply into the wind. The marines on the poop fired in their
turn, all the reports merging into one. Voices were heard on the
decks crying that they "had hit the white-haired chap." Captain
Vincent shouted to the master:</p>

<p>"Get the ship round on the other tack."</p>

<p>The elderly seaman who was the master of the <em>Amelia</em>
took a critical look before he gave the necessary orders; and
the <em>Amelia</em> closed on her chase with her decks resounding
to the piping of boatswain’s mates and the hoarse shout: "Hands
shorten sail. About ship."</p>

<p>Peyrol, lying on his back under the swinging tiller, heard the
calls shrilling and dying away; he heard the ominous rush of the
<em>Amelia’s</em> bow wave as the sloop foamed within ten yards
of the tartane’s stern; he even saw her upper yards coming down,
and then everything vanished out of the clouded sky. There was
nothing in his ears but the sound of the wind, the wash of the
waves buffeting the little craft left without guidance, and the
continuous thrashing of its foresail the sheet of which Michel
had let go according to orders. The tartane began to roll heavily,
but Peyrol’s right arm was sound and he managed to put it round
a bollard to prevent himself from being flung about. A feeling
of peace sank into him, not unmingled with pride. Everything he
had planned had come to pass. He had meant to play that man a
trick, and now the trick had been played. Played by him better
than by any other old man on whom age had stolen, unnoticed, till
the veil of peace was torn down by the touch of a sentiment unexpected
like an intruder and cruel like an enemy.</p>

<p>Peyrol rolled his head to the left. All he could see were the
legs of Citizen Scevola sliding nervelessly to and fro to the
rolling of the vessel as if his body had been jammed somewhere.
Dead, or only scared to death? And Michel? Was he dead or dying,
that man without friends whom his pity had refused to leave behind
marooned on the earth without even a dog for company. As to that,
Peyrol felt no compunction; but he thought he would have liked
to see Michel once more. He tried to utter his name, but his throat
refused him even a whisper. He felt himself removed far away from
that world of human sounds, in which Arlette had screamed at him:
"Peyrol, don’t you dare!" He would never hear anybody’s voice
again! Under that grey sky there was nothing for him but the swish
of breaking seas and the ceaseless furious beating of the tartane’s
foresail. His plaything was knocking about terribly under him,
with her tiller flying madly to and fro just clear of his head,
and solid lumps of water coming on board over his prostrate body.
Suddenly, in a desperate lurch which brought the whole Mediterranean
with a ferocious snarl level with the slope of the little deck,
Peyrol saw the <em>Amelia</em> bearing right down upon the tartane.
The fear, not of death, but of failure, gripped his slowing-down
heart. Was this blind Englishman going to run him down and sink
the dispatches together with the craft? With a mighty effort of
his ebbing strength Peyrol sat up and flung his arm round the
shroud of the mainmast.</p>

<p>The <em>Amelia</em>, whose way had carried her past the tartane
for a quarter of a mile before sail could be shortened and her
yards swung on the other tack, was coming back to take possession
of her chase. In the deepening dusk and amongst the foaming seas
it was a matter of difficulty to make out the little craft. At
the very moment when the master of the man-of-war, looking out
anxiously from the forecastle-head, thought that she might perhaps
have filled and gone down, he caught sight of her rolling in the
trough of the sea, and so close that she seemed to be at the end
of the <em>Amelia’s</em> jibboom. His heart flew in his mouth.
"Hard a starboard!" he yelled, his order being passed along the
decks.</p>

<p>Peyrol, sinking back on the deck, in another heavy lurch of his
craft, saw for an instant the whole of the English corvette swing
up into the clouds as if she meant to fling herself upon his very
breast. A blown seatop flicked his face noisily, followed by a
smooth interval, a silence of the waters. He beheld in a flash
the days of his manhood, of strength and adventure. Suddenly an
enormous voice like the roar of an angry sea-lion seemed to fill
the whole of the empty sky in a mighty and commanding shout: "Steady!"...
And with the sound of that familiar English word ringing in his
ears Peyrol smiled to his visions and died.</p>

<p>The <em>Amelia</em>, stripped down to her topsails and hove to,
rose and fell easily, while on her quarter about a cable’s length
away Peyrol’s tartane tumbled like a lifeless corpse amongst the
seas. Captain Vincent, in his favourite attitude of leaning over
the rail, kept his eyes fastened on his prize. Mr. Bolt, who had
been sent for, waited patiently till his commander turned round.</p>

<p>"Oh, here you are, Mr. Bolt. I have sent for you to go and take
possession. You speak French, and there may still be somebody
alive in her. If so, of course you will send him on board at once.
I am sure there can be nobody unwounded there. It will anyhow
be too dark to see much, but just have a good look round and secure
everything in the way of papers you can lay your hands on. Haul
aft the foresheet and sail her up to receive a tow-line. I intend
to take her along and ransack her thoroughly in the morning; tear
down the cuddy linings and so on, should you not find at once
what I expect...." Captain Vincent, his white teeth gleaming in
the dusk, gave some further orders in a lower tone, and Mr. Bolt
departed in a hurry. Half an hour afterwards he was back on board,
and the <em>Amelia</em>, with the tartane in tow, made sail to
the eastward in search of the blockading fleet.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolt, introduced into a cabin strongly lighted by a swinging
lamp, tendered to his captain across the table a sail-cloth package
corded and sealed, and a piece of paper folded in four, which,
he explained, seemed to be a certificate of registry, strangely
enough mentioning no name. Captain Vincent seized the grey canvas
package eagerly.</p>

<p>"This looks like the very thing, Bolt," he said, turning it over
in his hands. "What else did you find on board?"</p>

<p>Bolt said that he had found three dead men, two on the after-deck
and one lying at the bottom of the open hold with the bare end
of the foresheet in his hand&mdash;"shot down, I suppose, just as he
had let it go," he commented. He described the appearance of the
bodies and reported that he had disposed of them according to
orders. In the tartane’s cabin there was half a demijohn of wine
and a loaf of bread in a locker; also, on the floor, a leather
valise containing an officer’s uniform coat and a change of clothing.
He had lighted the lamp and saw that the linen was marked "E.
Réal." An officer’s sword on a broad shoulder-belt was also lying
on the floor. These things could not have belonged to the old
chap with the white hair, who was a big man. "Looks as if somebody
had tumbled overboard," commented Bolt. Two of the bodies looked
nondescript, but there was no doubt about that fine old fellow
being a seaman.</p>

<p>"By heavens!" said Captain Vincent, "he was that! Do you know,
Bolt, that he nearly managed to escape us. Another twenty minutes
would have done it. How many wounds had he?"</p>

<p>"Three I think, sir. I did not look closely," said Bolt.</p>

<p>"I hated the necessity of shooting brave men like dogs," said
Captain Vincent. "Still, it was the only way; and there may be
something here," he went on, slapping the package with his open
palm, "that will justify me in my own eyes. You may go now."</p>

<p>Captain Vincent did not turn in, but only lay down fully dressed
on the couch till the officer of the watch, appearing at the door,
told him that a ship of the fleet was in sight away to windward.
Captain Vincent ordered the private night signal to be made. When
he came on deck the towering shadow of a line-of-battle ship that
seemed to reach to the very clouds was well within hail and a
voice bellowed from her through a speaking-trumpet:</p>

<p>"What ship is that?"</p>

<p>"His Majesty’s sloop <em>Amelia</em>," hailed back Captain Vincent.
"What ship is that, pray?"</p>

<p>Instead of the usual answer, there was a short pause, and another
voice spoke boisterously through the trumpet:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Vincent? Don’t you know the <em>Superb</em> when
you see her?"</p>

<p>"Not in the dark, Keats. How are you? I am in a hurry to speak
the Admiral."</p>

<p>"The fleet is lying by," came the voice, now with painstaking
distinctness, across the murmurs, whispers and splashes of the
black lane of water dividing the two ships. "The Admiral bears
<em>S.S.E. </em>If you stretch on till daylight as you are, you
will fetch him on the other tack in time for breakfast on board
the <em>Victory</em>. Is anything up?"</p>

<p>At every slight roll the sails of the <em>Amelia</em>, becalmed
by the bulk of the seventy-four, flapped gently against the masts.</p>

<p>"Not much," hailed Captain Vincent. "I made a prize."</p>

<p>"Have you been in action?" came the swift inquiry.</p>

<p>"No, no. Piece of luck."</p>

<p>"Where’s your prize?" roared the speaking-trumpet with interest.</p>

<p>"In my desk," roared Captain Vincent in reply.... "Enemy dispatches....
I say, Keats, fill on your ship. Fill on her, I say, or you will
be falling on board of me." He stamped his foot impatiently. "Clap
some hands at once on the tow-line and run that tartane close
under our stern," he called to the officer of the watch, "or else
the old <em>Superb</em> will walk over her without ever knowing
anything about it."</p>

<p>When Captain Vincent presented himself on board the <em>Victory</em>
it was too late for him to be invited to share the Admiral’s breakfast.
He was told that Lord Nelson had not been seen on deck yet that
morning; and presently word came that he wished to see Captain
Vincent at once in his cabin. Being introduced, the captain of
the <em>Amelia</em>, in undress uniform, with a sword by his side
and his hat under his arm, was received kindly, made his bow and
with a few words of explanation laid the packet on the big round
table at which sat a silent secretary in black clothes, who had
been obviously writing a letter from his Lordship’s dictation.
The Admiral had been walking up and down, and after he had greeted
Captain Vincent he resumed his pacing of a nervous man. His empty
sleeve had not yet been pinned on his breast, and swung slightly
every time he turned in his walk. His thin locks fell lank against
the pale cheeks, and the whole face in repose had an expression
of suffering with which the fire of his one eye presented a startling
contrast. He stopped short and exclaimed while Captain Vincent
towered over him in a respectful attitude:</p>

<p>"A tartane! Captured on board a tartane! How on earth did you
pitch upon that one out of the hundreds you must see every month?"</p>

<p>"I must confess that I got hold accidentally of some curious
information," said Captain Vincent. "It was all a piece of luck."</p>

<p>While the secretary was ripping open with a penknife the cover
of the dispatches Lord Nelson took Captain Vincent out into the
stern gallery. The quiet and sunshiny morning had the added charm
of a cool, light breeze; and the <em>Victory</em>, under her three
topsails and lower staysails, was moving slowly to the southward
in the midst of the scattered fleet carrying for the most part
the same sail as the Admiral. Only far away two or three ships
could be seen covered with canvas, trying to close with the flag.
Captain Vincent noted with satisfaction that the first lieutenant
of the <em>Amelia</em> had been obliged to brace by his afteryards
in order not to overrun the Admiral’s quarter.</p>

<p>"Why!" exclaimed Lord Nelson suddenly, after looking at the sloop
for a moment, "you have that tartane in tow!"</p>

<p>"I thought that your Lordship would perhaps like to see a 40-ton
lateen craft which has led such a chase to, I dare say, the fastest
sloop in His Majesty’s service."</p>

<p>"How did it all begin?" asked the Admiral, continuing to look
at the <em>Amelia</em>.</p>

<p>"As I have already hinted to your Lordship, certain information
came in my way," began Captain Vincent, who did not think it necessary
to enlarge upon that part of the story. "This tartane, which is
not very different to look at from the other tartanes along the
coast between Cette and Genoa, had started from a cove on the
Giens peninsula. An old man with a white head of hair was entrusted
with the service, and really they could have found nobody better.
He came round Cape Esterel intending to pass through the Hyères
Roadstead. Apparently he did not expect to find the <em>Amelia</em>
in his way. And it was there that he made his only mistake. If
he had kept on his course, I would probably have taken no more
notice of him than of two other craft that were in sight then.
But he acted suspiciously by hauling up for the battery on Porquerolles.
This manœuvre in connection with the information of which I spoke
decided me to overhaul him and see what he had on board." Captain
Vincent then related concisely the episodes of the chase. "I assure
your Lordship that I never gave an order with greater reluctance
than to open musketry fire on that craft; but the old man had
given such proofs of his seamanship and determination that there
was nothing else for it. Why! at the very moment he had the <em>Amelia</em>
alongside of him he still made a most clever attempt to prolong
the chase. There were only a few minutes of daylight left, and
in the darkness we might very well have lost him. Considering
that they all could have saved their lives simply by striking
their sails on deck, I cannot refuse them my admiration, and especially
to the white-haired man."</p>

<p>The Admiral, who had been all the time looking absently at the
<em>Amelia</em> keeping her station with the tartane in tow, said:</p>

<p>"You have a very smart little ship, Vincent. Very fit for the
work I have given you to do. French built, isn’t she?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my Lord. They are great shipbuilders."</p>

<p>"You don’t seem to hate the French, Vincent," said the Admiral,
smiling faintly.</p>

<p>"Not that kind, my Lord," said Captain Vincent, with a bow. "I
detest their political principles and the characters of their
public men, but your Lordship will admit that for courage and
determination we could not have found worthier adversaries anywhere
on this globe."</p>

<p>"I never said that they were to be despised," said Lord Nelson.
"Resource, courage, yes.... If that Toulon fleet gives me the
slip, all our squadrons from Gibraltar to Brest will be in jeopardy.
Why don’t they come out and be done with it? Don’t I keep far
enough out of their way?" he cried.</p>

<p>Vincent remarked the nervous agitation of the frail figure with
a concern augmented by a fit of coughing which came on the Admiral.
He was quite alarmed by its violence. He watched the Commander-in-Chief
in the Mediterranean choking and gasping so helplessly that he
felt compelled to turn his eyes away from the painful spectacle;
but he noticed also how quickly Lord Nelson recovered from the
subsequent exhaustion.</p>

<p>"This is anxious work, Vincent," he said. "It is killing me.
I aspire to repose somewhere in the country, in the midst of fields,
out of reach of the sea and the Admiralty and dispatches and orders,
and responsibility too. I have been just finishing a letter to
tell them at home I have hardly enough breath in my body to carry
me on from day to day.... But I am like that white-headed man
you admire so much, Vincent," he pursued, with a weary smile,
"I will stick to my task till perhaps some shot from the enemy
puts an end to everything.... Let us see what there may be in
those papers you have brought on board."</p>

<p>The secretary in the cabin had arranged them in separate piles.</p>

<p>"What is it all about?" asked the Admiral, beginning again to
pace restlessly up and down the cabin.</p>

<p>"At the first glance, the most important, my Lord, are the orders
for marine authorities in Corsica and Naples to make certain dispositions
in view of an expedition to Egypt."</p>

<p>"I always thought so," said the Admiral, his eye gleaming at
the attentive countenance of Captain Vincent. "This is a smart
piece of work on your part, Vincent. I can do no better than send
you back to your station. Yes ... Egypt ... the East.... Everything
points that way," he soliloquised under Vincent’s eyes, while
the secretary, picking up the papers with care, rose quietly and
went out to have them translated and to make an abstract for the
Admiral.</p>

<p>"And yet who knows!" exclaimed Lord Nelson, standing still for
a moment. "But the blame or the glory must be mine alone. I will
seek counsel from no man." Captain Vincent felt himself forgotten,
invisible, less than a shadow in the presence of a nature capable
of such vehement feelings. "How long can he last?" he asked himself
with sincere concern.</p>

<p>The Admiral, however, soon remembered his presence, and at the
end of another ten minutes Captain Vincent left the <em>Victory</em>,
feeling, like all officers who approached Lord Nelson, that he
had been speaking with a personal friend; and with a renewed devotion
for the great sea-officer’s soul dwelling in the frail body of
the Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty’s ships in the Mediterranean.
While he was being pulled back to his ship a general signal went
up in the <em>Victory</em> for the fleet to form line, as convenient,
ahead and astern of the Admiral; followed by another to the <em>Amelia</em>
to part company. Vincent accordingly gave his orders to make sail,
and, directing the master to shape a course for Cape Cicié, went
down into his cabin. He had been up nearly the whole of the last
three nights, and he wanted to get a little sleep. His slumbers,
however, were short and disturbed. Early in the afternoon he found
himself broad awake and reviewing in his mind the events of the
day before. The order to shoot three brave men in cold blood,
terribly distasteful at the time, was lying heavily on him. Perhaps
he had been impressed by Peyrol’s white head, his obstinacy to
escape him, the determination shown to the very last minute; by
something in the whole episode that suggested a more than common
devotion to duty and a spirit of daring defiance. With his robust
health, simple good nature, and sanguine temperament touched with
a little irony, Captain Vincent was a man of generous feelings
and of easily moved sympathies.</p>

<p>"Yet," he reflected, "they have been asking for it. There could
be only one end to that affair. But the fact remains that they
were defenceless and unarmed and particularly harmless-looking,
and at the same time as brave as any. That old chap now...." He
wondered how much of exact truth there was in Symons’ tale of
adventure. He concluded that the facts must have been true but
that Symons’ interpretation of them made it extraordinarily difficult
to discover what really there was under all that. That craft certainly
was fit for blockade running. Lord Nelson had been pleased. Captain
Vincent went on deck with the kindliest feelings towards all men,
alive and dead.</p>

<p>The afternoon had turned out very fine. The British fleet was
just out of sight with the exception of one or two stragglers,
under a press of canvas. A light breeze, in which only the <em>Amelia</em>
could travel at five knots, hardly ruffled the profundity of the
blue waters basking in the warm tenderness of the cloudless sky.
To south and west the horizon was empty except for two specks
very far apart, of which one shone white like a bit of silver
and the other appeared black like a drop of ink. Captain Vincent,
with his purpose firm in his mind, felt at peace with himself.
As he was easily accessible to his officers, his first lieutenant
ventured a question to which Captain Vincent replied:</p>

<p>"He looks very thin and worn out, but I don’t think he is as
ill as he thinks he is. I am sure you all would like to know that
his Lordship is pleased with our yesterday’s work&mdash;those papers
were of some importance you know&mdash;and generally with the <em>Amelia</em>.
It was a queer chase, wasn’t it?" he went on. "That tartane was
clearly and unmistakably running away from us. But she never had
a chance against the <em>Amelia</em>."</p>

<p>During the latter part of that speech the first lieutenant glanced
astern as if asking himself how long Captain Vincent proposed
to drag that tartane behind the <em>Amelia</em>. The two keepers
in her wondered also as to when they would be permitted to get
back on board their ship. Symons, who was one of them, declared
that he was sick and tired of steering the blamed thing. Moreover,
the company on board made him uncomfortable; for Symons was aware
that in pursuance of Captain Vincent’s orders, Mr. Bolt had had
the three dead Frenchmen carried into the cuddy, which he afterwards
secured with an enormous padlock that, apparently, belonged to
it, and had taken the key on board the <em>Amelia</em>. As to
one of them, Symons’ unforgiving verdict was that it would have
served him right to be thrown ashore for crows to peck his eyes
out. And anyhow, he could not understand why he should have been
turned into the coxswain of a floating hearse, and be damned to
it.... He grumbled interminably.</p>

<p>Just about sunset, which is the time of burials at sea, the <em>Amelia</em>
was hove to and, the rope being manned, the tartane was brought
alongside and her two keepers ordered on board their ship. Captain
Vincent, leaning over with his elbows on the rail, seemed lost
in thought. At last the first lieutenant spoke.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do with that tartane, sir? Our men are
on board."</p>

<p>"We are going to sink her by gunfire," declared Captain Vincent
suddenly. "His ship makes a very good coffin for a seaman, and
those men deserve better than to be thrown overboard to roll on
the waves. Let them rest quietly at the bottom of the sea in the
craft to which they had stuck so well."</p>

<p>The lieutenant, making no reply, waited for some more positive
order. Every eye on the ship was turned on the captain. But Captain
Vincent said nothing and seemed unable or unwilling to give it
yet. He was feeling vaguely that in all his good intentions there
was something wanting.</p>

<p>"Ah! Mr. Bolt," he said, catching sight of the master’s mate
in the waist. "Did they have a flag on board that craft?"</p>

<p>"I think she had a tiny bit of ensign when the chase began, sir,
but it must have blown away. It is not at the end of her mainyard
now." He looked over the side. "The halliards are rove, though,"
he added.</p>

<p>"We must have a French ensign somewhere on board," said Captain
Vincent.</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir," struck in the master, who was listening.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Bolt," said Captain Vincent, "you have had most to
do with all this. Take a few men with you, bend the French ensign
on the halliards and sway his mainyard to the masthead." He smiled
at all the faces turned towards him. "After all, they never surrendered
and, by heavens, gentlemen, we will let them go down with their
colours flying."</p>

<p>A profound but not disapproving silence reigned over the decks
of the ship while Mr. Bolt with three or four hands was busy executing
the order. Then suddenly above the top-gallant rail of the <em>Amelia</em>
appeared the upper curve of a lateen yard with the tricolour drooping
from the point. A subdued murmur from all hands greeted this apparition.
At the same time Captain Vincent ordered the line holding the
tartane alongside to be cast off and the mainyard of the <em>Amelia</em>
to be swung round. The sloop, shooting ahead of her prize, left
her stationary on the sea, then putting the helm up, ran back
abreast of her on the other side. The port bow-gun was ordered
to fire a round, aiming well forward. That shot, however, went
just over, taking the foremast out of the tartane. The next was
more successful, striking the little hull between wind and water,
and going out well under water on the other side. A third was
fired, as the men said, just for luck, and that too took effect,
a splintered hole appearing at the bow. After that the guns were
secured and the <em>Amelia</em>, with no brace being touched,
was brought to her course towards Cape Cicié. All hands on board
of her with their backs to the sunset sky, clear like a pale topaz
above the hard blue gem of the sea, watched the tartane give a
sudden dip, followed by a slow, unchecked dive. At last the tricolour
flag alone remained visible for a tense and interminable moment,
pathetic and lonely, in the centre of a brimful horizon. All at
once it vanished, like a flame blown upon, bringing to the beholders
the sense of having been left face to face with an immense, suddenly
created solitude. On the decks of the <em>Amelia</em> a low murmur
died out.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Réal sailed away with the Toulon fleet on the
great strategical cruise which was to end in the Battle of Trafalgar,
Madame Réal returned with her aunt to her hereditary house at
Escampobar. She had only spent a few weeks in town, where she
was not much seen in public. The lieutenant and his wife lived
in a little house near the western gate, and the lieutenant’s
official position, though he was employed on the staff to the
last, was not sufficiently prominent to make her absence from
official ceremonies at all remarkable. But this marriage was an
object of mild interest in naval circles. Those&mdash;mostly men&mdash;who
had seen Madame Réal at home, told stories of her dazzling complexion,
of her magnificent black eyes, of her personal and attractive
strangeness, and of the Arlesian costume she insisted on wearing,
even after her marriage to an officer of the navy, being herself
sprung from farmer stock. It was also said that her father and
mother had fallen victims in the massacres of Toulon after the
evacuation of the town; but all those stories varied in detail
and were on the whole very vague. Whenever she went abroad Mrs.
Réal was attended by her aunt, who aroused almost as much curiosity
as herself: a magnificent old woman with upright carriage and
an austere, brown, wrinkled face showing signs of past beauty.
Catherine was also seen alone in the streets, where, as a matter
of fact, people turned round to look after the thin and dignified
figure, remarkable amongst the passers-by, whom she herself did
not seem to see. About her escape from the massacres most wonderful
tales were told, and she acquired the reputation of a heroine.
Arlette’s aunt was known to frequent the churches, which were
all open to the faithful now, carrying even into the house of
God her sibylline aspect of a prophetess and her austere manner.
It was not at the services that she was seen most. People would
see her oftener in an empty nave, standing slim and as straight
as an arrow in the shade of a mighty pillar as if making a call
on the Creator of all things, with whom she had made her peace
generously, and now would petition only for pardon and reconciliation
with her niece Arlette. For Catherine for a long time remained
uncertain of the future. She did not get rid of her involuntary
awe of her niece as a selected object of God’s wrath until towards
the end of her life. There was also another soul for which she
was concerned. The pursuit of the tartane by the <em>Amelia</em>
had been observed from various points of the islands that close
the roadstead of Hyères, and the English ship had been seen from
the Fort de la Vigie opening fire on her chase. The result, though
the two vessels soon ran out of sight, could not be a matter of
doubt. There was also the story told by a coaster, that got into
Fréjus, of a tartane being fired on by a square-rigged man-of-war;
but that apparently was the next day. All these rumours pointed
one way and were the foundation of the report made by Lieutenant
Réal to the Toulon Admiralty. That Peyrol went out to sea in his
tartane and was never seen again was, of course, an incontrovertible
fact.</p>

<p>The day before the two women were to go back to Escampobar Catherine
approached a priest in the church of Ste Marie Majeure, a little
unshaven fat man with a watery eye, in order to arrange for some
masses to be said for the dead.</p>

<p>"But for whose soul are we to pray?" mumbled the priest in a
wheezy low tone.</p>

<p>"Pray for the soul of Jean," said Catherine. "Yes, Jean. There
is no other name."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Réal, wounded at Trafalgar, but escaping capture,
retired with the rank of Capitaine de Frégate and vanished from
the eyes of the naval world in Toulon, and indeed from the world
altogether. Whatever sign brought him back to Escampobar on that
momentous night was not meant to call him to his death but to
a quiet and retired life, obscure in a sense but not devoid of
dignity. In the course of years he became the Mayor of the Commune
in that very same little village which had looked on Escampobar
as the abode of iniquity, the sojourn of blood-drinkers and of
wicked women.</p>

<p>One of the earliest excitements breaking the monotony of the
Escampobar life was the discovery at the bottom of the well, one
dry year when the water got very low, of some considerable obstruction.
After a lot of trouble in getting it up, this obstruction turned
out to be a garment made of sail-cloth, which had armholes and
three horn buttons in front, and looked like a waistcoat; but
it was lined, positively quilted, with a surprising quantity of
gold pieces of various ages, coinages and nationalities. Nobody
but Peyrol could have put it there. Catherine was able to give
the exact date; because she remembered seeing him doing something
at the well on the very morning before he went out to sea with
Michel, carrying off Scevola. Captain Réal could guess easily
the origin of that treasure, and he decided with his wife’s approval
to give it up to the Government as the hoard of a man who had
died intestate with no discoverable relations, and whose very
name had been a matter of uncertainty, even to himself. After
that event the uncertain name of Peyrol found itself oftener and
oftener on Monsieur and Madame Réal’s lips, on which before it
was but seldom heard; though the recollection of his white-headed,
quiet, irresistible personality haunted every corner of the Escampobar
fields. From that time they talked of him openly, as though he
had come back to live again amongst them.</p>

<p>Many years afterwards, one fine evening Monsieur and Madame Réal,
sitting on the bench outside the salle (the house had not been
altered at all outside except that it was now kept whitewashed),
began to talk of that episode and of the man who, coming from
the seas, had crossed their lives to disappear at sea again.</p>

<p>"How did he get all that lot of gold?" wondered Madame Réal innocently.
"He could not possibly want it; and, Eugène, why should he have
put it down there?"</p>

<p>"That, ma chère amie," said Réal, "is not an easy question to
answer. Men and women are not so simple as they seem. Even you,
fermière (he used to give his wife that name jocularly sometimes),
are not so simple as some people would take you to be. I think
that if Peyrol were here he could not perhaps answer your question
himself."</p>

<p>And they went on, reminding each other in short phrases separated
by long silences, of his peculiarities of person and behaviour,
when, above the slope leading down to Madrague, there appeared,
first the pointed ears and then the whole body of a very diminutive
donkey of a light grey colour with dark points. Two pieces of
wood, strangely shaped, projected on each side of his body as
far as his head, like very long shafts of a cart. But the donkey
dragged no cart after him. He was carrying on his back on a small
pack-saddle the torso of a man who did not seem to have any legs.
The little animal, beautifully groomed and with an intelligent
and even impudent physiognomy, stopped in front of Monsieur and
Madame Réal. The man, balancing himself cleverly on the pack-saddle
with his withered legs crossed in front of him, slipped off, disengaged
his crutches from each side of the donkey smartly, propped himself
on them, and with his open palm gave the animal a resounding thwack
which sent it trotting into the yard. The cripple of the Madrague
in his quality of Peyrol’s friend (for the rover had often talked
of him both to the women and to Lieutenant Réal with great appreciation&mdash;"C’est
un homme ça") had become a member of the Escampobar community.
His employment was to run about the country on errands, most unfit,
one would think, for a man without legs. But the donkey did all
the walking while the cripple supplied the sharp wits and an unfailing
memory. The poor fellow, snatching off his hat and holding it
with one hand alongside his right crutch, approached to render
his account of the day in the simple words: "Everything has been
done as you ordered, Madame"; then lingered, a privileged servant,
familiar but respectful, attractive with his soft eyes, long face
and his pained smile.</p>

<p>"We were just talking of Peyrol," remarked Captain Réal.</p>

<p>"Ah, one could talk a long time of him," said the cripple. "He
told me once that if I had been complete&mdash;with legs like everybody
else, I suppose he meant &mdash;I would have made a good comrade
away there in the distant seas. He had a great heart."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Madame Réal thoughtfully. Then, turning to her
husband, she asked: "What sort of man was he really, Eugène?"
Captain Réal remained silent. "Did you ever ask yourself that
question?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Réal. "But the only certain thing we can say of him
is that he was not a bad Frenchman."</p>

<p>"Everything’s in that," murmured the cripple, with fervent conviction,
in the silence that fell upon Réal’s words and Arlette’s faint
sigh of memory.</p>

<p>The blue level of the Mediterranean, the charmer and the deceiver
of audacious men, kept the secret of its fascination&mdash;hugged to
its calm breast the victims of all the wars, calamities and tempests
of its history, under the marvellous purity of the sunset sky.
A few rosy clouds floated high up over the Esterel range. The
breath of the evening breeze came to cool the heated rocks of
Escampobar; and the mulberry-tree, the only big tree on the head
of the peninsula, standing like a sentinel at the gate of the
yard, sighed faintly in a shudder of all its leaves as if regretting
the Brother of the Coast, the man of dark deeds, but of large
heart, who often at noonday would lie down to sleep under its
shade.</p>
