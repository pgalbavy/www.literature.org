<p>It is necessary at this point that some attention should be given
to the predecessor of our friends in captivity &mdash;Gravity
Gimp.</p>

<p>The particulars of his capture will be recalled, it being somewhat
similar to that of his followers, inasmuch as he was pounced upon
and overwhelmed before he could make any effectual resistance,
though, for a time, he kept things "moving."</p>

<p>But he was forced to succumb at last, and was led away by those
whom he had fought so bravely, and into whose hands he dreaded
falling aware as he was what fate awaited him.</p>

<p>"Be keerful," he called out, limping heavily, "I've got a game
leg, and I want yer to play light on it."</p>

<p>Whether they understood his words or not is a small matter; but
the American Indian is accustomed to the language of gesture,
and when the African limped forward, as though unable to bear
half the weight on one limb, they could not mistake what it meant.</p>

<p>The gun of the captive was taken from him, and, as he was such
a miserable pedestrian just then, his hands were not bound behind
him, as was the case with the prisoners afterwards taken.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the rough usage given his captors during the struggle
would have resulted in serious injury to some of them; but the
Iroquois were too sinewy, lithe, and graceful on their feet to
fare ill, and they gathered about him, with something akin to
admiration, when he was conducted farther into the mountain, where
they had a large camp-fire burning.</p>

<p>"I s'pose eberybody makes mistakes," muttered Gravity, moving
slowly along; "leastways I'm purty sartin I made a wery big one,
when I got too cur'us to know what dese willains was up to."</p>

<p>No indignity was offered him on the walk to the fire, which was
burning a couple of hundred yards away, but he felt that nothing
like mercy was to be expected from his captors.</p>

<p>The negro had proven his coolness and courage in more than one
instance that day, and Maggie Brainerd asked herself whether the
loyal fellow really knew what fear is.</p>

<p>But when Gimp reached the camp-fire, and saw Jake Golcher with
other Indians grouped around him, his heart gave a throb of terror.</p>

<p>He knew that wretch too well to make any mistake concerning him.
It was Gimp who, but a few hours before, had visited the worst
kind of physical indignity on the Tory, who now possessed the
chance to repay him.</p>

<p>Jake was sitting on a fallen tree, leaning forward with his elbows
on his knees, and his chin in his hands, looking into the glowing
embers, and apparently only half listening to the guttural conversation
going on among the Indians about him.</p>

<p>He had spent so much time with the Seneca branch of the Iroquois,
that he understood their tongue quite well. But, as he slowly
puffed at his short clay pipe, his thoughts were far away.</p>

<p>Most likely he was recalling the incidents of the day, that were
a source of mixed pleasure and pain to him.</p>

<p>"The overthrow of the rebels was complete," he muttered, his
face lighting up with passion. "It'll be a good many years before
Wyoming will get over this, and I've got even with a lot of them
that hain't used me well. There's Parker, who called me a lazy
loafer two years ago, because I wouldn't pay him a little money
I had borrowed. Well, I settled up with him to-day, and he'll
never call anybody else such a disrespectful name agin.</p>

<p>"Then there's Sam Williams, that I used to go out hunting with,
and who was considered a pretty good chap by some folks. He used
to lend me money, and never cared whether I paid him back or not;
but he undertook to lecture me once on my dooty, and said, if
I didn't go to work, I never would be anybody, I've got too much
spirit to stand any such insults as that, and, when I come on
him to-day, I settled with him."</p>

<p>Dreadful thoughts were these to find such expression, and the
renegade was silent a minute, until it seemed as if Satan got
still a stronger hold upon him.</p>

<p>"But there's <em>one</em> man close by that I would give a thousand
prisoners for," he added, puffing spitefully at his pipe, "and
it looks as if I'm going to have him. Providence does favor the
truly good," added the miscreant. "I've got the whole party penned
up in a hole, and if they get away from us it will be the biggest
thing of the kind ever done in these parts.</p>

<p>"I want to get hold of that Gimp, that stole my gun and gave
me such a kicking that I feel six inches taller than ever before,
and have to be mighty careful about settin' down. He's a sort
of giant, but if we lay hands on him there'll be mighty little
of him left when we get through.</p>

<p>"There's Maggie Brainerd, the prettiest gal that ever left Connecticut
and settled in the Wyoming Valley. I knowed her when she was a
little one, and then she was so purty that people used to stop
her in the road, to kiss and admire her.</p>

<p>"She always acted kind toward me, and I used to think she was
kinder tender and loving, and I b'leve now I might have got her,
if that half-brother of hers, Fred Godfrey, hadn't come along
and set her agin me."</p>

<p>The brows of the Tory contracted at the recollection of something
that burned in his memory.</p>

<p>"A year ago, he was down here in the valley, and I feared there
wasn't much chance for me with Maggie, so I thought I would shame
him before the town to that extent he would never show his face
in it again. He was talkin' in the store to a lot of our neighbors,
and had enlisted, and he thought every young chap oughter. I said
I didn't b'leve he had enough courage to fire a gun at a red coat,
when he said he had enough to fire me out, if I didn't keep a
civil tongue in my head.</p>

<p>"That's just what I wanted, for I had been building up my muscle
for two weeks, with the very idee of whalin' him, and I sailed
in.</p>

<p>"Wal," added the Tory, with a sigh, "the fight was over afore
I'd fairly got into it. I come out of the winder with a sash round
my neck, and if I hadn't struck agin Aunt Peggy, who was walkin'
by, my neck would have been broken off short. I didn't get over
that lambastin' for a month, but Fred Godfrey little thought when
he jined the crowd in laughin' at me, that he had sealed his doom."</p>

<p>The face of the Tory flushed, for he was sure that he had the
best reason to believe that he spoke the truth.</p>
