<p>"<em>BARINIA, </em>the young stranger has arrived."</p>

<p>"Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he is waiting at the lodge."</p>

<p>"I told you to show him to Natacha’s sitting-room. Didn’t you
understand me, Ermolai?"</p>

<p>"Pardon, Barinia, but the young stranger, when I asked to search
him, as you directed, flatly refused to let me."</p>

<p>"Did you explain to him that everybody is searched before being
allowed to enter, that it is the order, and that even my mother
herself has submitted to it?"</p>

<p>"I told him all that, Barinia; and I told him about madame your
mother."</p>

<p>"What did he say to that?"</p>

<p>"That he was not madame your mother. He acted angry."</p>

<p>"Well, let him come in without being searched."</p>

<p>"The Chief of Police won’t like it."</p>

<p>"Do as I say."</p>

<p>Ermolai bowed and returned to the garden. The "barinia" left
the veranda, where she had come for this conversation with the
old servant of General Trebassof, her husband, and returned to
the dining-room in the datcha des Iles, where the gay Councilor
Ivan Petrovitch was regaling his amused associates with his latest
exploit at Cubat’s resort. They were a noisy company, and certainly
the quietest among them was not the general, who nursed on a sofa
the leg which still held him captive after the recent attack,
that to his old coachman and his two piebald horses had proved
fatal. The story of the always-amiable Ivan Petrovitch (a lively,
little, elderly man with his head bald as an egg) was about the
evening before. After having, as he said, "recure la bouche" for
these gentlemen spoke French like their own language and used
it among themselves to keep their servants from understanding&mdash;after
having wet his whistle with a large glass of sparkling rosy French
wine, he cried:</p>

<p>"You would have laughed, Feodor Feodorovitch. We had sung songs
on the Barque* and then the Bohemians left with their music and
we went out onto the river-bank to stretch our legs and cool our
faces in the freshness of the dawn, when a company of Cossacks
of the Guard came along. I knew the officer in command and invited
him to come along with us and drink the Emperor’s health at Cubat’s
place. That officer, Feodor Feodorovitch, is a man who knows vintages
and boasts that he has never swallowed a glass of anything so
common as Crimean wine. When I named champagne he cried, ‘Vive
l’Empereur!’ A true patriot. So we started, merry as school-children.
The entire company followed, then all the diners playing little
whistles, and all the servants besides, single file. At Cubat’s
I hated to leave the companion-officers of my friend at the door,
so I invited them in, too. They accepted, naturally. But the subalterns
were thirsty as well. I understand discipline. You know, Feodor
Feodorovitch, that I am a stickler for discipline. Just because
one is gay of a spring morning, discipline should not be forgotten.
I invited the officers to drink in a private room, and sent the
subalterns into the main hall of the restaurant. Then the soldiers
were thirsty, too, and I had drinks served to them out in the
courtyard. Then, my word, there was a perplexing business, for
now the horses whinnied. The brave horses, Feodor Feodorovitch,
who also wished to drink the health of the Emperor. I was bothered
about the discipline. Hall, court, all were full. And I could
not put the horses in private rooms. Well, I made them carry out
champagne in pails and then came the perplexing business I had
tried so hard to avoid, a grand mixture of boots and horse-shoes
that was certainly the liveliest thing I have ever seen in my
life. But the horses were the most joyous, and danced as if a
torch was held under their nostrils, and all of them, my word!
were ready to throw their riders because the men were not of the
same mind with them as to the route to follow! From our window
we laughed fit to kill at such a mixture of sprawling boots and
dancing hoofs. But the troopers finally got all their horses to
barracks, with patience, for the Emperor’s cavalry are the best
riders in the world, Feodor Feodorovitch. And we certainly had
a great laugh! &mdash;Your health, Matrena Petrovna."</p>

[* The "Barque" is a restaurant on a boat, among the isles,<br/>
near the Gulf of Finland, on a bank of the Neva.]

</p>
</div>
<p>These last graceful words were addressed to Madame Trebassof,
who shrugged her shoulders at the undesired gallantry of the gay
Councilor. She did not join in the conversation, excepting to
calm the general, who wished to send the whole regiment to the
guard-house, men and horses. And while the roisterers laughed
over the adventure she said to her husband in the advisory voice
of the helpful wife:</p>

<p>"Feodor, you must not attach importance to what that old fool
Ivan tells you. He is the most imaginative man in the capital
when he has had champagne."</p>

<p>"Ivan, you certainly have not had horses served with champagne
in pails," the old boaster, Athanase Georgevitch, protested jealously.
He was an advocate, well-known for his table-feats, who claimed
the hardest drinking reputation of any man in the capital, and
he regretted not to have invented that tale.</p>

<p>"On my word! And the best brands! I had won four thousand roubles.
I left the little fete with fifteen kopecks."</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna was listening to Ermolai, the faithful country
servant who wore always, even here in the city, his habit of fresh
nankeen, his black leather belt, his large blue pantaloons and
his boots glistening like ice, his country costume in his master’s
city home. Madame Matrena rose, after lightly stroking the hair
of her step-daughter Natacha, whose eyes followed her to the door,
indifferent apparently to the tender manifestations of her father’s
orderly, the soldier-poet, Boris Mourazoff, who had written beautiful
verses on the death of the Moscow students, after having shot
them, in the way of duty, on their barricades.</p>

<p>Ermolai conducted his mistress to the drawing-room and pointed
across to a door that he had left open, which led to the sitting-room
before Natacha’s chamber.</p>

<p>"He is there," said Ermolai in a low voice.</p>

<p>Ermolai need have said nothing, for that matter, since Madame
Matrena was aware of a stranger’s presence in the sitting-room
by the extraordinary attitude of an individual in a maroon frock-coat
bordered with false astrakhan, such as is on the coats of all
the Russian police agents and makes the secret agents recognizable
at first glance. This policeman was on his knees in the drawing-room
watching what passed in the next room through the narrow space
of light in the hinge-way of the door. In this manner, or some
other, all persons who wished to approach General Trebassof were
kept under observation without their knowing it, after having
been first searched at the lodge, a measure adopted since the
latest attack.</p>

<p>Madame Matrena touched the policeman’s shoulder with that heroic
hand which had saved her husband’s life and which still bore traces
of the terrible explosion in the last attack, when she had seized
the infernal machine intended for the general with her bare hand.
The policeman rose and silently left the room, reached the veranda
and lounged there on a sofa, pretending to be asleep, but in reality
watching the garden paths.</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna took his place at the hinge-vent. This was her
rule; she always took the final glance at everything and everybody.
She roved at all hours of the day and night round about the general,
like a watch-dog, ready to bite, to throw itself before the danger,
to receive the blows, to perish for its master. This had commenced
at Moscow after the terrible repression, the massacre of revolutionaries
under the walls of Presnia, when the surviving Nihilists left
behind them a placard condemning the victorious General Trebassof
to death. Matrena Petrovna lived only for the general. She had
vowed that she would not survive him. So she had double reason
to guard him.</p>

<p>But she had lost all confidence even within the walls of her
own home.</p>

<p>Things had happened even there that defied her caution, her instinct,
her love. She had not spoken of these things save to the Chief
of Police, Koupriane, who had reported them to the Emperor. And
here now was the man whom the Emperor had sent, as the supreme
resource, this young stranger &mdash;Joseph Rouletabille, reporter.</p>

<p>"But he is a mere boy!" she exclaimed, without at all understanding
the matter, this youthful figure, with soft, rounded cheeks, eyes
clear and, at first view, extraordinarily naive, the eyes of an
infant. True, at the moment Rouletabille’s expression hardly suggested
any superhuman profundity of thought, for, left in view of a table,
spread with hors-d’oeuvres, the young man appeared solely occupied
in digging out with a spoon all the caviare that remained in the
jars. Matrena noted the rosy freshness of his cheeks, the absence
of down on his lip and not a hint of beard, the thick hair, with
the curl over the forehead. Ah, that forehead&mdash;the forehead was
curious, with great over-hanging cranial lumps which moved above
the deep arcade of the eye-sockets while the mouth was busy&mdash;well,
one would have said that Rouletabille had not eaten for a week.
He was demolishing a great slice of Volgan sturgeon, contemplating
at the same time with immense interest a salad of creamed cucumbers,
when Matrena Petrovna appeared.</p>

<p>He wished to excuse himself at once and spoke with his mouth
full.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, madame, but the Czar forgot to invite me
to breakfast."</p>

<p>Madame Matrena smiled and gave him a hearty handshake as she
urged him to be seated.</p>

<p>"You have seen His Majesty?"</p>

<p>"I come from him, madame. It is to Madame Trebassof that I have
the honor of speaking?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And you are Monsieur&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Joseph Rouletabille, madame. I do not add, ‘At your service&mdash;because
I do not know about that yet. That is what I said just now to
His Majesty."</p>

<p>"Then?" asked Madame Matrena, rather amused by the tone the conversation
had taken and the slightly flurried air of Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Why, then, I am a reporter, you see. That is what I said at
once to my editor in Paris, ‘I am not going to take part in revolutionary
affairs that do not concern my country,’ to which my editor replied,
‘You do not have to take part. You must go to Russia to make an
inquiry into the present status of the different parties. You
will commence by interviewing the Emperor.’ I said, ‘Well, then,
here goes,’ and took the train."</p>

<p>"And you have interviewed the Emperor?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that has not been difficult. I expected to arrive direct
at St. Petersburg, but at Krasnoie-Coelo the train stopped and
the grand-marshal of the court came to me and asked me to follow
him. It was very flattering. Twenty minutes later I was before
His Majesty. He awaited me! I understood at once that this was
obviously for something out of the ordinary."</p>

<p>"And what did he say to you?"</p>

<p>"He is a man of genuine majesty. He reassured me at once when
I explained my scruples to him. He said there was no occasion
for me to take part in the politics of the matter, but to save
his most faithful servant, who was on the point of becoming the
victim of the strangest family drama ever conceived."</p>

<p>Madame Matrena, white as a sheet, rose to her feet.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said simply.</p>

<p>But Rouletabille, whom nothing escaped, saw her hand tremble
on the back of the chair.</p>

<p>He went on, not appearing to have noticed her emotion:</p>

<p>"His Majesty added these exact words: ‘It is I who ask it of
you; I and Madame Trebassof. Go, monsieur, she awaits you.’"</p>

<p>He ceased and waited for Madame Trebassof to speak.</p>

<p>She made up her mind after brief reflection.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Koupriane?"</p>

<p>"The Chief of Police? Yes. The grand-marshal accompanied me back
to the station at Krasnoie-Coelo, and the Chief of Police accompanied
me to St. Petersburg station. One could not have been better received."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Rouletabille," said Matrena, who visibly strove to
regain her self-control, "I am not of Koupriane’s opinion and
I am not"&mdash;here she lowered her trembling voice&mdash;"of the opinion
His Majesty holds. It is better for me to tell you at once, so
that you may not regret intervening in an affair where there are&mdash;where
there are&mdash;risks&mdash;terrible risks to run. No, this is not a family
drama. The family is small, very small: the general, his daughter
Natacha (by his former marriage), and myself. There could not
be a family drama among us three. It is simply about my husband,
monsieur, who did his duty as a soldier in defending the throne
of his sovereign, my husband whom they mean to assassinate! There
is nothing else, no other situation, my dear little guest."</p>

<p>To hide her distress she started to carve a slice of jellied
veal and carrot.</p>

<p>"You have not eaten, you are hungry. It is dreadful, my dear
young man. See, you must dine with us, and then&mdash;you will say
adieu. Yes, you will leave me all alone. I will undertake to save
him all alone. Certainly, I will undertake it."</p>

<p>A tear fell on the slice she was cutting. Rouletabille, who felt
the brave woman’s emotion affecting him also, braced himself to
keep from showing it.</p>

<p>"I am able to help you a little all the same," he said. "Monsieur
Koupriane has told me that there is a deep mystery. It is my vocation
to get to the bottom of mysteries."</p>

<p>"I know what Koupriane thinks," she said, shaking her head. "But
if I could bring myself to think that for a single day I would
rather be dead."</p>

<p>The good Matrena Petrovna lifted her beautiful eyes to Rouletabille,
brimming with the tears she held back.</p>

<p>She added quickly:</p>

<p>"But eat now, my dear guest; eat. My dear child, you must forget
what Koupriane has said to you, when you are back in France."</p>

<p>"I promise you that, madame."</p>

<p>"It is the Emperor who has caused you this long journey. For
me, I did not wish it. Has he, indeed, so much confidence in you?"
she asked naively, gazing at him fixedly through her tears.</p>

<p>"Madame, I was just about to tell you. I have been active in
some important matters that have been reported to him, and then
sometimes your Emperor is allowed to see the papers. He has heard
talk, too (for everybody talked of them, madame), about the Mystery
of the Yellow Room and the Perfume of the Lady in Black."</p>

<p>Here Rouletabille watched Madame Trebassof and was much mortified
at the undoubted ignorance that showed in her frank face of either
the yellow room or the black perfume.</p>

<p>"My young friend," said she, in a voice more and more hesitant,
"you must excuse me, but it is a long time since I have had good
eyes for reading."</p>

<p>Tears, at last, ran down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Rouletabille could not restrain himself any further. He saw in
one flash all this heroic woman had suffered in her combat day
by day with the death which hovered. He took her little fat hands,
whose fingers were overloaded with rings, tremulously into his
own:</p>

<p>"Madame, do not weep. They wish to kill your husband. Well then,
we will be two at least to defend him, I swear to you."</p>

<p>"Even against the Nihilists!"</p>

<p>"Aye, madame, against all the world. I have eaten all your caviare.
I am your guest. I am your friend."</p>

<p>As he said this he was so excited, so sincere and so droll that
Madame Trebassof could not help smiling through her tears. She
made him sit down beside her.</p>

<p>"The Chief of Police has talked of you a great deal. He came
here abruptly after the last attack and a mysterious happening
that I will tell you about. He cried, ‘Ah, we need Rouletabille
to unravel this!’ The next day he came here again. He had gone
to the Court. There, everybody, it appears, was talking of you.
The Emperor wished to know you. That is why steps were taken through
the ambassador at Paris."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. And naturally all the world has learned of it. That
makes it so lively. The Nihilists warned me immediately that I
would not reach Russia alive. That, finally, was what decided
me on coming. I am naturally very contrary."</p>

<p>"And how did you get through the journey?"</p>

<p>"Not badly. I discovered at once in the train a young Slav assigned
to kill me, and I reached an understanding with him. He was a
charming youth, so it was easily arranged."</p>

<p>Rouletabille was eating away now at strange viands that it would
have been difficult for him to name. Matrena Petrovna laid her
fat little hand on his arm:</p>

<p>"You speak seriously?"</p>

<p>"Very seriously."</p>

<p>"A small glass of vodka?"</p>

<p>"No alcohol."</p>

<p>Madame Matrena emptied her little glass at a draught.</p>

<p>"And how did you discover him? How did you know him?"</p>

<p>"First, he wore glasses. All Nihilists wear glasses when traveling.
And then I had a good clew. A minute before the departure from
Paris I had a friend go into the corridor of the sleeping-car,
a reporter who would do anything I said without even wanting to
know why. I said, ‘You call out suddenly and very loud, "Hello,
here is Rouletabille."’ So he called, ‘Hello, here is Rouletabille,’
and all those who were in the corridor turned and all those who
were already in the compartments came out, excepting the man with
the glasses. Then I was sure about him."</p>

<p>Madame Trebassof looked at Rouletabille, who turned as red as
the comb of a rooster and was rather embarrassed at his fatuity.</p>

<p>"That deserves a rebuff, I know, madame, but from the moment
the Emperor of all the Russias had desired to see me I could not
admit that any mere man with glasses had not the curiosity to
see what I looked like. It was not natural. As soon as the train
was off I sat down by this man and told him who I thought he was.
I was right. He removed his glasses and, looking me straight in
the eyes, said he was glad to have a little talk with me before
anything unfortunate happened. A half-hour later the entente-cordiale
was signed. I gave him to understand that I was coming here simply
on business as a reporter and that there was always time to check
me if I should be indiscreet. At the German frontier he left me
to go on, and returned tranquilly to his nitro-glycerine."</p>

<p>"You are a marked man also, my poor boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, they have not got us yet."</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna coughed. That <em>us</em> overwhelmed her. With
what calmness this boy that she had not known an hour proposed
to share the dangers of a situation that excited general pity
but from which the bravest kept aloof either from prudence or
dismay.</p>

<p>"Ah, my friend, a little of this fine smoked Hamburg beef?"</p>

<p>But the young man was already pouring out fresh yellow beer.</p>

<p>"There," said he. "Now, madame, I am listening. Tell me first
about the earliest attack."</p>

<p>"Now," said Matrena, "we must go to dinner."</p>

<p>Rouletabille looked at her wide-eyed.</p>

<p>"But, madame, what have I just been doing?"</p>

<p>Madame Matrena smiled. All these strangers were alike. Because
they had eaten some hors-d’oeuvres, some zakouskis, they imagined
their host would be satisfied. They did not know how to eat.</p>

<p>"We will go to the dining-room. The general is expecting you.
They are at table."</p>

<p>"I understand I am supposed to know him."</p>

<p>"Yes, you have met in Paris. It is entirely natural that in passing
through St. Petersburg you should make him a visit. You know him
very well indeed, so well that he opens his home to you. Ah, yes,
my step-daughter also"&mdash;she flushed a little&mdash;"Natacha believes
that her father knows you."</p>

<p>She opened the door of the drawing-room, which they had to cross
in order to reach the dining-room.</p>

<p>From his present position Rouletabille could see all the corners
of the drawing-room, the veranda, the garden and the entrance
lodge at the gate. In the veranda the man in the maroon frock-coat
trimmed with false astrakhan seemed still to be asleep on the
sofa; in one of the corners of the drawing-room another individual,
silent and motionless as a statue, dressed exactly the same, in
a maroon frock-coat with false astrakhan, stood with his hands
behind his back seemingly struck with general paralysis at the
sight of a flaring sunset which illumined as with a torch the
golden spires of Saints Peter and Paul. And in the garden and
before the lodge three others dressed in maroon roved like souls
in pain over the lawn or back and forth at the entrance. Rouletabille
motioned to Madame Matrena, stepped back into the sitting-room
and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Police?" he asked.</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna nodded her head and put her finger to her mouth
in a naive way, as one would caution a child to silence. Rouletabille
smiled.</p>

<p>"How many are there?"</p>

<p>"Ten, relieved every six hours."</p>

<p>"That makes forty unknown men around your house each day."</p>

<p>"Not unknown," she replied. "Police."</p>

<p>"Yet, in spite of them, you have had the affair of the bouquet
in the general’s chamber."</p>

<p>"No, there were only three then. It is since the affair of the
bouquet that there have been ten."</p>

<p>"It hardly matters. It is since these ten that you have had..."</p>

<p>"What?" she demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>"You know well&mdash;the flooring."</p>

<p>"Sh-h-h."</p>

<p>She glanced at the door, watching the policeman statuesque before
the setting sun.</p>

<p>"No one knows that&mdash;not even my husband."</p>

<p>"So M. Koupriane told me. Then it is you who have arranged for
these ten police-agents?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Well, we will commence now by sending all these police away."</p>

<p>Matrena Petrovna grasped his hand, astounded.</p>

<p>"Surely you don’t think of doing such a thing as that!"</p>

<p>"Yes. We must know where the blow is coming from. You have four
different groups of people around here&mdash;the police, the domestics,
your friends, your family. Get rid of the police first. They must
not be permitted to cross your threshold. They have not been able
to protect you. You have nothing to regret. And if, after they
are gone, something new turns up, we can leave M. Koupriane to
conduct the inquiries without his being preoccupied here at the
house."</p>

<p>"But you do not know the admirable police of Koupriane. These
brave men have given proof of their devotion."</p>

<p>"Madame, if I were face to face with a Nihilist the first thing
I would ask myself about him would be, ‘Is he one of the police?’
The first thing I ask in the presence of an agent of your police
is, ‘Is he not a Nihilist?’"</p>

<p>"But they will not wish to go."</p>

<p>"Do any of them speak French?"</p>

<p>"Yes, their sergeant, who is out there in the salon."</p>

<p>"Pray call him."</p>

<p>Madame Trebassof walked into the salon and signaled. The man
appeared. Rouletabille handed him a paper, which the other read.</p>

<p>"You will gather your men together and quit the villa," ordered
Rouletabille. "You will return to the police Headguarters. Say
to M. Koupriane that I have commanded this and that I require
all police service around the villa to be suspended until further
orders."</p>

<p>The man bowed, appeared not to understand, looked at Madame Trebassof
and said to the young man:</p>

<p>"At your service."</p>

<p>He went out.</p>

<p>"Wait here a moment," urged Madame Trebassof, who did not know
how to take this abrupt action and whose anxiety was really painful
to see.</p>

<p>She disappeared after the man of the false astrakhan. A few moments
afterwards she returned. She appeared even more agitated.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she murmured, "but I cannot let them go
like this. They are much chagrined. They have insisted on knowing
where they have failed in their service. I have appeased them
with money."</p>

<p>"Yes, and tell me the whole truth, madame. You have directed
them not to go far away, but to remain near the villa so as to
watch it as closely as possible."</p>

<p>She reddened.</p>

<p>"It is true. But they have gone, nevertheless. They had to obey
you. What can that paper be you have shown them?"</p>

<p>Rouletabille drew out again the billet covered with seals and
signs and cabalistics that he did not understand. Madame Trebassof
translated it aloud: "Order to all officials in surveillance of
the Villa Trebassof to obey the bearer absolutely. Signed: Koupriane."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" murmured Matrena Petrovna. "But Koupriane would
never have given you this paper if he had imagined that you would
use it to dismiss his agents."</p>

<p>"Evidently. I have not asked him his advice, madame, you may
be sure. But I will see him to-morrow and he will understand."</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, who is going to watch over him?" cried she.</p>

<p>Rouletabille took her hands again. He saw her suffering, a prey
to anguish almost prostrating. He pitied her. He wished to give
her immediate confidence.</p>

<p>"We will," he said.</p>

<p>She saw his young, clear eyes, so deep, so intelligent, the well-formed
young head, the willing face, all his young ardency for her, and
it reassured her. Rouletabille waited for what she might say.
She said nothing. She took him in her arms and embraced him.</p>
