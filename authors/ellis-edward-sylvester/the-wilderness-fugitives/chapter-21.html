<p>"Stay here," said the Mohawk, as soon as they halted; "Lena-Wingo
go look for Iroquois&mdash;soon be back&mdash;don't go away&mdash;don't make
noise, listen&mdash;watch, don't go away."</p>

<p>"But suppose some of them come down upon us, Jack?" asked Ned,
determined to understand the situation as fully as possible.</p>

<p>"Keep out way&mdash;won't come down&mdash;stay away."</p>

<p>"Well, if you are enough satisfied to give me a written guarantee,
that's all there is about it. How long do you expect to be gone?"</p>

<p>"Not long&mdash;soon be back."</p>

<p>This was not very definite, but it was all the Mohawk would say,
and without any more words he took his departure, walking back
over the trail which they had been following since leaving the
river.</p>

<p>"I can't understand why he is sure that no one will make a call
on us while he is gone," said Jo Minturn to Ned, as the three
once more seated themselves, this time on a fallen tree.</p>

<p>"The only reason that suggests itself to me is that he believes
we are so far off the track of the Iroquois that the only possibility
that can lead them this way is by their discovering our trail,
and if they attempt that, they will run against him, as he is
going backward over it."</p>

<p>"That seems to be a pretty good reason, but he may miss it, nevertheless.
There may not be much danger of an invasion from any other direction,
and yet there's no telling, either, from what point of the compass
these wretches may come."</p>

<p>"You ought to have explained all that," said Rosa. "I am quite
sure that Lena-Wingo would be grateful for all the instruction
you can give him in the ways of the woods. But you know he is
so much younger than you, and has had so little experience, that
you must be charitable, and not judge him too harshly."</p>

<p>Jo laughed and shook his head at his sister, who persisted in
"touching" him up on every occasion.</p>

<p>"As we are to stay here indefinitely," said Ned, "there can be
no harm in taking an observation and learning something for ourselves."</p>

<p>"How are we to do it?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>Ned pointed to the towering trees which stood on every hand.</p>

<p>"Climb up among those branches; what better outlook can one ask
than he can get among those limbs?"</p>

<p>"What a nice target a man would be, too, if an Indian should
catch sight of him!" said Rosa, as she looked up at the leaves
gently swaying in the slight morning breeze. "But after what Lena-Wingo
said, I don't think there's much to be feared of that, and I look
upon your idea as a good one, Edward."</p>

<p>"If my sister considers the idea a good one," said Jo, "that
settles it, and you need have no further fear."</p>

<p>"Of course not," was the prompt assent of Ned, who moved to the
tree which he had selected as his lookout.</p>

<p>As there was a remote possibility that some such a contingency
as the one intimated by their fair companion might occur, Jo and
Rosa stationed themselves beneath the tree to guard against surprise,
Jo holding his gun ready, while Ned left his own piece in the
hands of Rosa, who, should the occasion arise, knew how to employ
it effectively. It was the work of a few minutes for the athletic
young man to make his way to the top of the tree, which was one
of the tallest in the neighborhood, and gave him the opportunity
he wished. Ned remembered the words of Rosa, which, uttered in
jest as they were, contained a good deal of sense. While making
his way among the limbs, he frequently paused and carefully scrutinized
the ground below, on the lookout for lurking Indians.</p>

<p>The most rigid scrutiny failed to reveal anything alarming, and
reaching as high a point as was prudent, he settled himself among
the luxuriant branches, and then, like the shipwrecked mariner,
looked long and searchingly over the waste around him.</p>

<p>Peering to the northward, from his elevated perch, Ned saw the
stretch of woods, cultivated fields, the broad, smoothly-flowing
Susquehanna, with the faint view of the ruins of Fort Wintermoot
and of Forty Fort beyond. The view was a lovely one, as seen in
the clear sunlight of this summer morning, and it was hard to
realize that the fair vale had been desecrated within so brief
a time by the merciless white and red men, who had not yet left
the valley. No wonder that the beauties of this enchanting spot
have drawn the tribute of the poets of the Old and New World.</p>

<p>Ned Clinton had often gazed on the attractions of his native
vale, and he appreciated them always, but he restrained the admiration
which he might have felt at any other time. The first glance over
the extended scene failed to discover any signs of life; but when
he had looked again, he detected the figure of a canoe crossing
the river, the distance making it appear but a speck, while the
number of occupants was indistinguishable. To the southwest, almost
in the line of the Susquehanna, he observed a black cloud resting
like a smirch of dirt against a clear, blue sky. This, he had
no doubt, was the smoke from some conflagration of the night before.</p>

<p>The little primitive town of Wilkesbarre, with its rude fortifications,
lay also along the bank of the river, but owing to some intervening
trees of tall growth, standing close to the fort, the view in
that direction was not as complete as in others. Having scanned
the outer boundaries of the field, Ned attended to those portions
which lay nearer to him. It was a long time before he could fix
upon any spot that promised to give him information of friend
or foe. Nothing could be seen of Lena-Wingo, who was pursuing
his investigations in his own way, and was not likely to return
until he had accomplished something upon which to base an intelligent
course of action. But by and by, as the youth was scanning a point
two or three hundred yards away, his eye fell upon something which
promised to give him the very knowledge he was seeking.</p>

<p>In an open space at the distance mentioned, he observed a large
flat rock, which had nothing peculiar in its appearance, but which,
it was evident, was being used by some one as a means of concealment,
while he in turn took a survey of the young man in the tree. Ned
was under the impression that no matter how much he played the
sentinel, he was invisible to all outsiders that might be attempting
to steal toward him and his friends. It happened that he glanced
directly at the object at the moment that a man, whose dress showed
him to be of the same race as the young scout, rose to his feet,
stood a second or two, and then dropped down out of sight again.
His action was such as a man would make when he suspected that
some one else was trying to obtain a closer scrutiny than was
agreeable. Ned was not a little puzzled by what he witnessed.
He looked down to his friends, and spoke in a careful undertone:</p>

<p>"Keep a sharp lookout; I have discovered something which I want
to study a while."</p>

<p>"All right," called back Jo; "manage your end of the rope as
you ought, and we'll take care of ours."</p>

<p>Left thus free, the sentinel devoted himself to the task of watching
the movements of the stranger, and learning what his intentions
were in conducting himself in the manner described.</p>

<p>"He can't get away from where he is without my seeing him," was
the reflection of the watcher, "and if he means mischief, I shall
detect it in time to prevent his hurting us."</p>

<p>The stranger at this period was invisible, as he must continue
to be so long as he kept behind the rock; but it was hardly likely
that he would stay there long.</p>

<p>"It may be he is some fugitive like ourselves," added young Clinton,
"and he doesn't feel certain enough of our identity as yet to
trust himself within reach."</p>
