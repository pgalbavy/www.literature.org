<p>The tropical night wore away and the growing light in the east
showed that day was dawning. With the exception of the men who
wrought below, Miss Starland was the only one who slept during
those monotonous hours, but she was astir early, and with the
help of Martella set about preparing the morning meal for the
crew and passengers. General Yozarro could be counted upon to
carry a well stocked larder, and little solid food is required
in so warm a country. Many of the fish in the bifurcated river
are of delicious flavor, but rice and fruit form the principal
diet. She prepared coffee and the first food that was ready was
taken below by Martella for the men who did the hardest work.</p>

<p>"The Captain must not be forgotten, Martella; will you carry
a tray to him?"</p>

<p>"Not for all the gold in the Rubio Mountains; you told me you
allowed him to keep his pistol."</p>

<p>"True, as you said, it isn't best to tempt him too far; I will
take his food to him."</p>

<p>"Permit me to do so," interposed Captain Guzman, who thereupon
performed the pleasing task. Ortega was first invited to come
to the cabin to join them, but he replied that his duties required
him to remain in the pilot house. The delicate feeling that prompted
his refusal was understood by the brother and sister.</p>

<p>Just as the meal was finished, all were startled by the hoarse,
tremulous whistle overhead. Two long blasts sounded, and the clink
of the little brass lever was heard as it dropped back to its
resting place against the sounding tube.</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Major Starland, who the next moment
bounded to his feet and hurried to the Captain, with Guzman at
his heels.</p>

<p>"Captain, what is the cause of that signal; have you so soon
forgotten your neutrality?"</p>

<p>"It is a salutation to the steamer just coming round the bend.
Listen!"</p>

<p>A sepulchral tremolo rumbled across the water, and the topmast
of a craft was discerned gliding along over the stunted tops of
the timber growing on the projecting point of land which for the
moment shut the hull from view. From the highest point fluttered
the most beautiful flag ever bathed in the sunlight of heaven.
It seemed to be bounding forward as if borne at the head of a
charging regiment.</p>

<p>"By heavens!" exclaimed the happy American, to whom the answering
signal was one of the most familiar sounds on earth; "that's the
<em>Warrenia</em>, my own yacht!"</p>

<p>"I am pleased to know it," said Captain Ortega.</p>

<p>Miss Starland was scarcely behind the others in climbing to the
upper deck. The Captain lifted his hat, they smiled at each other,
but there was no other sign of recognition.</p>

<p>First the clean cut prow, with the pretty flag of the Triton
Navy dallying from the staff, then the graceful hull and the peak
with the flag of our country streaming in the gale created by
its own motion, and the whole magnificent craft steamed round
the bend and headed toward the tugboat. With dancing eyes centered
upon the thrilling picture, our friends saw a snowy puff shoot
upward from the brass cylinder and the old welcome signal shuddered
across the water.</p>

<p>"Will the Señorita oblige me by replying?" asked Captain Ortega.
The radiant young woman, with a smile and inclination of her head,
but with no further evidence that they were acquaintances, stepped
into the door that the Captain opened for her, and grasping the
cord answered the boat named for herself. Then, thanking the courteous
officer, she passed out again and excitedly waved her handkerchief
at a lady who was seen standing in front of the others at the
bow.</p>

<p>"That's Aunt Cynthia! There! she has raised her glass! She knows
me! Bless her dear heart!"</p>

<p>The woman had recognized her niece and her handkerchief was also
a-flutter. An understanding was had through the signalling of
the whistles and the two craft rapidly approached each other.
Major Starland swung his hat in greeting, again the whistles bellowed
across the decreasing space and all was gladness and joy.</p>

<p>While they were yet too far apart to converse readily, the Major
had noted another form near the pilot house, a little to one side
of Aunt Cynthia. It was bulky and broad, was in gorgeous uniform
of blue and gilt, with the golden sash high up in front and low
at the back, and the point of his scabbard touching the deck.</p>

<p>"What the mischief is General Bambos doing there?"</p>

<p>"Probably he is a self-invited guest," suggested Captain Guzman.</p>

<p>"True, and I can afford to welcome him; it is fortunate that
the yacht took aboard new supplies at San Luis."</p>

<p>The tinkling of signal bells and the reversing of screws and
the shifting over of wheels brought the two boats so nearly alongside
that conversation became facile among all parties. Holding off
the <em>General Yozarro</em>, Captain Ortega waited to know the
wishes of his chief passenger, who now became the supreme authority
on both crafts.</p>

<p>Under the manipulation of the adepts at the respective wheels,
the boats were laid beside each other and the gangplank of the
yacht connected the two. Miss Starland was the first to run across
and was clasped in the arms of her delighted relative. Then her
brother, Captain Guzman and Martella followed. General Bambos
bowed as nearly to the deck as he could, with his plumed hat sweeping
the air, and expressed his happiness at meeting the charming young
American Señorita again. Then, while the boats remained lashed,
he asked an explanation of the situation, which was a mystery
to him as it was to nearly all the others.</p>

<p>Major Starland took it upon himself to enlighten him and his
friends, doing so with a succinctness that left no doubt in the
mind of any one. The broad face grew solemn, when he succeeded
at last in comprehending the remarkable story.</p>

<p>"You will permit me to say, Major, that you have committed a
serious international offence."</p>

<p>"And I am prepared to bear all the consequences of my crime."</p>

<p>"They are likely to be graver than you seem to think; it is your
duty, first of all, to apologize&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Apologize to that scoundrel of a Yozarro! I'll see him hanged
first!"</p>

<p>"You will not deny that it is your honorable duty to restore
the Atlamalcan navy to my excellent compatriot, General Yozarro."</p>

<p>"You seem to be concerned for the brother with whom, only a day
or two ago, you were eager to go to war. I don't want that old
tub which he calls a gunboat; he is welcome to it; Atlamalco holds
a single solitary gentleman, Captain Ramon Ortega, who is up there
at the wheel, and he is at liberty to take the boat back to his
chief with my compliments, and that chief may go hang."</p>

<p>"But that will hardly do; you took it by force from him and should
return it in person. It is the only way by which an international
complication can be prevented."</p>

<p>Yielding to an impulse inspired by the humor of the situation,
Major Starland said:</p>

<p>"Very well; I'll take it upon myself to deliver the <em>General
Yozarro</em> to its owner with my own hands."</p>
