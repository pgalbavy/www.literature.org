<p>Henrietta Hen was waiting as patiently as she could for the fair to come
to an end. She tried to close her ears to the boasts of her neighbors on
either side of her, that they were going to win the first prize. She had
heard too many unpleasant remarks about herself to have even the
slightest hope of winning any prize at all--let alone the first.
</p>
<p>"Anyhow, we'll be going home tonight," Henrietta said to herself. "And
I'll never, never, never come to another fair. I'll go and hide 'way up
high in the haymow where they can't find me before I'll spend another
week in a place like this."
</p><p>While she was muttering under her breath like that some men came up to
her pen. And Henrietta Hen promptly squatted down in the furthest corner
of it, hoping they wouldn't say anything disagreeable about her. She felt
that she had already heard about all she could stand. She didn't even
look at her callers. And soon they moved away.
</p><p>Then Henrietta glanced up. She noticed something blue dangling from the
front of her pen. And there was a greater commotion than ever on all
sides of her.
</p><p>"What is it?" she cried. "What has happened?"
</p><p>Neighbor Number 1, on her right, shot a spiteful look at her.
</p><p>"Those stupid judges!" she spluttered. "They've made a terrible blunder.
They've gone and given you and your chicks the first prize. And of course
it was meant for me and mine!"
</p><p>"It wasn't!" screamed Neighbor Number 2 (on Henrietta's left). "That
prize was intended for me and my children!"
</p><p>"Who won second and third?" cried a noisy hen from across the way.
</p><p>"They're both at the other end of the hall!" somebody shrieked.
</p><p>"It's an outrage! It isn't fair! We've been cheated!" Henrietta Hen's
nearest neighbors clamored. But nobody paid any attention to them.
</p><p>As for Henrietta, she didn't quite know how to act. She had intended,
when she left home, to do a good deal of strutting back and forth in her
pen, with now and then a pause to preen herself, to make sure that she
looked her best. But somehow she no longer cared to put on grand airs, as
of old. She remembered that some of the other hens at the fair had been
haughty and proud and had smoothed their feathers, declaring boldly that
they expected to win the first prize.
</p><p>Henrietta had heard it said that fine feathers don't make fine birds. And
she knew at last what that meant. It meant that gay clothes and lofty
ways and boastful talk were of no account at all.
</p><p>So Henrietta tried to behave as if nothing unusual had happened. She told
her chicks that they were going home that evening, and that she would be
glad to be back on the farm again, among plain home-folks.
</p><p>At last Johnnie Green and his father came to load Henrietta and her
family into the wagon.
</p><p>"Well," said the old horse Ebenezer to Henrietta. "Did you enjoy the
races?"
</p><p>"I didn't have a chance to see them," she replied.
</p><p>"That's a pity," he told her. And then he asked her, "What's that blue
tag hanging from your pen?"
</p><p>"That--" said Henrietta--"that means that my chicks won the first prize."
</p><p>"She helped win it herself," cried old dog Spot, who was yelping about
the wagon. "Our little speckled hen was the best hen at the fair!"
</p><p>"Nonsense!" Henrietta exclaimed. But, all the same, she couldn't help
being pleased.
