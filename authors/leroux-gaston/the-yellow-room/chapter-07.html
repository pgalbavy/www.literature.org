<p>Rouletabille having pushed open the door of "The Yellow Room"
paused on the threshold saying, with an emotion which I only later
understood, "Ah, the perfume of the lady in black!"</p>

<p>The chamber was dark. Daddy Jacques was about to open the blinds
when Rouletabille stopped him.</p>

<p>"Did not the tragedy take place in complete darkness?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, young man, I don’t think so. Mademoiselle always had a nightlight
on her table, and I lit it every evening before she went to bed.
I was a sort of chambermaid, you must understand, when the evening
came. The real chambermaid did not come here much before the morning.
Mademoiselle worked late&mdash;far into the night."</p>

<p>"Where did the table with the night-light stand,&mdash;far from the
bed?"</p>

<p>"Some way from the bed."</p>

<p>"Can you light the burner now?"</p>

<p>"The lamp is broken and the oil that was in it was spilled when
the table was upset. All the rest of the things in the room remain
just as they were. I have only to open the blinds for you to see."</p>

<p>"Wait."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went back into the laboratory, closed the shutters
of the two windows and the door of the vestibule.</p>

<p>When we were in complete darkness, he lit a wax vesta, and asked
Daddy Jacques to move to the middle of the chamber with it to
the place where the night-light was burning that night.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques who was in his stockings&mdash;he usually left his sabots
in the vestibule&mdash;entered "The Yellow Room" with his bit of a
vesta. We vaguely distinguished objects overthrown on the floor,
a bed in one corner, and, in front of us, to the left, the gleam
of a looking-glass hanging on the wall, near to the bed.</p>

<p>"That will do!&mdash;you may now open the blinds," said Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Don’t come any further," Daddy Jacques begged, "you may make
marks with your boots, and nothing must be deranged; it’s an idea
of the magistrate’s&mdash;though he has nothing more to do here."</p>

<p>And he pushed open the shutter. The pale daylight entered from
without, throwing a sinister light on the saffron-coloured walls.
The floor&mdash;for though the laboratory and the vestibule were tiled,
"The Yellow Room" had a flooring of wood&mdash;was covered with a single
yellow mat which was large enough to cover nearly the whole room,
under the bed and under the dressing-table&mdash;the only piece of
furniture that remained upright. The centre round table, the night-table
and two chairs had been overturned. These did not prevent a large
stain of blood being visible on the mat, made, as Daddy Jacques
informed us, by the blood which had flowed from the wound on Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s forehead. Besides these stains, drops of blood had
fallen in all directions, in line with the visible traces of the
footsteps&mdash;large and black&mdash;of the murderer. Everything led to
the presumption that these drops of blood had fallen from the
wound of the man who had, for a moment, placed his red hand on
the wall. There were other traces of the same hand on the wall,
but much less distinct.</p>

<p>"See!&mdash;see this blood on the wall!" I could not help exclaiming.
"The man who pressed his hand so heavily upon it in the darkness
must certainly have thought that he was pushing at a door! That’s
why he pressed on it so hard, leaving on the yellow paper the
terrible evidence. I don’t think there are many hands in the world
of that sort. It is big and strong and the fingers are nearly
all one as long as the other! The thumb is wanting and we have
only the mark of the palm; but if we follow the trace of the hand,"
I continued, "we see that, after leaving its imprint on the wall,
the touch sought the door, found it, and then felt for the lock&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No doubt," interrupted Rouletabille, chuckling,&mdash;"only there
is no blood, either on the lock or on the bolt!"</p>

<p>"What does that prove?" I rejoined with a good sense of which
I was proud; "he might have opened the lock with his left hand,
which would have been quite natural, his right hand being wounded."</p>

<p>"He didn’t open it at all!" Daddy Jacques again exclaimed. "We
are not fools; and there were four of us when we burst open the
door!"</p>

<p>"What a queer hand! &mdash;Look what a queer hand it is!" I said.</p>

<p>"It is a very natural hand," said Rouletabille, "of which the
shape has been deformed by its having slipped on the wall. The
man dried his hand on the wall. He must be a man about five feet
eight in height."</p>

<p>"How do you come at that?"</p>

<p>"By the height of the marks on the wall."</p>

<p>My friend next occupied himself with the mark of the bullet in
the wall. It was a round hole.</p>

<p>"This ball was fired straight, not from above, and consequently,
not from below."</p>

<p>Rouletabille went back to the door and carefully examined the
lock and the bolt, satisfying himself that the door had certainly
been burst open from the outside, and, further, that the key had
been found in the lock on the inside of the chamber. He finally
satisfied himself that with the key in the lock, the door could
not possibly be opened from without with another key. Having made
sure of all these details, he let fall these words: "That’s better!"
&mdash;Then sitting down on the ground, he hastily took off his
boots and, in his socks, went into the room.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to examine minutely the overturned
furniture. We watched him in silence.</p>

<p>"Young fellow, you are giving yourself a great deal of trouble,"
said Daddy Jacques ironically.</p>

<p>Rouletabille raised his head and said:</p>

<p>"You have spoken the simple truth, Daddy Jacques; your mistress
did not have her hair in bands that evening. I was a donkey to
have believed she did."</p>

<p>Then, with the suppleness of a serpent, he slipped under the
bed. Presently we heard him ask:</p>

<p>"At what time, Monsieur Jacques, did Monsieur and Mademoiselle
Stangerson arrive at the laboratory?"</p>

<p>"At six o’clock."</p>

<p>The voice of Rouletabille continued:</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;he’s been under here,&mdash;that’s certain; in fact, there
was no where else where he could have hidden himself. Here, too,
are the marks of his hobnails. When you entered&mdash;all four of you&mdash;did
you look under the bed?"</p>

<p>"At once,&mdash;we drew it right out of its place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And between the mattresses?"</p>

<p>"There was only one on the bed, and on that Mademoiselle was
placed; and Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge immediately
carried it into the laboratory. Under the mattress there was nothing
but the metal netting, which could not conceal anything or anybody.
Remember, monsieur, that there were four of us and we couldn’t
fail to see everything&mdash;the chamber is so small and scantily furnished,
and all was locked behind in the pavilion."</p>

<p>I ventured on a hypothesis:</p>

<p>"Perhaps he got away with the mattress&mdash;in the mattress! &mdash;Anything
is possible, in the face of such a mystery! In their distress
of mind Monsieur Stangerson and the concierge may not have noticed
they were bearing a double weight; especially if the concierge
were an accomplice! I throw out this hypothesis for what it is
worth, but it explains many things,&mdash;and particularly the fact
that neither the laboratory nor the vestibule bear any traces
of the footmarks found in the room. If, in carrying Mademoiselle
on the mattress from the laboratory of the chateau, they rested
for a moment, there might have been an opportunity for the man
in it to escape.</p>

<p>"And then?" asked Rouletabille, deliberately laughing under the
bed.</p>

<p>I felt rather vexed and replied:</p>

<p>"I don’t know,&mdash;but anything appears possible"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The examining magistrate had the same idea, monsieur," said
Daddy Jacques, "and he carefully examined the mattress. He was
obliged to laugh at the idea, monsieur, as your friend is doing
now,&mdash;for whoever heard of a mattress having a double bottom?"</p>

<p>I was myself obliged to laugh, on seeing that what I had said
was absurd; but in an affair like this one hardly knows where
an absurdity begins or ends.</p>

<p>My friend alone seemed able to talk intelligently. He called
out from under the bed.</p>

<p>"The mat here has been moved out of place,&mdash;who did it?"</p>

<p>"We did, monsieur," explained Daddy Jacques. "When we could not
find the assassin, we asked ourselves whether there was not some
hole in the floor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is not," replied Rouletabille. "Is there a cellar?"</p>

<p>"No, there’s no cellar. But that has not stopped our searching,
and has not prevented the examining magistrate and his Registrar
from studying the floor plank by plank, as if there had been a
cellar under it."</p>

<p>The reporter then reappeared. His eyes were sparkling and his
nostrils quivered. He remained on his hands and knees. He could
not be better likened than to an admirable sporting dog on the
scent of some unusual game. And, indeed, he was scenting the steps
of a man,&mdash;the man whom he has sworn to report to his master,
the manager of the "Epoque." It must not be forgotten that Rouletabille
was first and last a journalist.</p>

<p>Thus, on his hands and knees, he made his way to the four corners
of the room, so to speak, sniffing and going round everything&mdash;everything
that we could see, which was not much, and everything that we
could not see, which must have been infinite.</p>

<p>The toilette table was a simple table standing on four legs;
there was nothing about it by which it could possibly be changed
into a temporary hiding-place. There was not a closet or cupboard.
Mademoiselle Stangerson kept her wardrobe at the chateau.</p>

<p>Rouletabille literally passed his nose and hands along the walls,
constructed of solid brickwork. When he had finished with the
walls, and passed his agile fingers over every portion of the
yellow paper covering them, he reached to the ceiling, which he
was able to touch by mounting on a chair placed on the toilette
table, and by moving this ingeniously constructed stage from place
to place he examined every foot of it. When he had finished his
scrutiny of the ceiling, where he carefully examined the hole
made by the second bullet, he approached the window, and, once
more, examined the iron bars and blinds, all of which were solid
and intact. At last, he gave a grunt of satisfaction and declared
"Now I am at ease!"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;do you believe that the poor dear young lady was shut
up when she was being murdered&mdash;when she cried out for help?"
wailed Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the young reporter, drying his forehead, ""The Yellow
Room" was as tightly shut as an iron safe."</p>

<p>"That," I said, "is why this mystery is the most surprising I
know. Edgar Allan Poe, in ‘The Murders in the Rue Morgue,’ invented
nothing like it. The place of that crime was sufficiently closed
to prevent the escape of a man; but there was that window through
which the monkey, the perpetrator of the murder, could slip away!
But here, there can be no question of an opening of any sort.
The door was fastened, and through the window blinds, secure as
they were, not even a fly could enter or get out."</p>

<p>"True, true," assented Rouletabille as he kept on drying his
forehead, which seemed to be perspiring less from his recent bodily
exertion than from his mental agitation. "Indeed, it’s a great,
a beautiful, and a very curious mystery."</p>

<p>"The Bete du bon Dieu," muttered Daddy Jacques, "the Bete du
bon Dieu herself, if she had committed the crime, could not have
escaped. Listen! Do you hear it? Hush!"</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques made us a sign to keep quiet and, stretching his
arm towards the wall nearest the forest, listened to something
which we could not hear.</p>

<p>"It’s answering," he said at length. "I must kill it. It is too
wicked, but it’s the Bete du bon Dieu, and, every night, it goes
to pray on the tomb of Sainte-Genevieve and nobody dares to touch
her, for fear that Mother Angenoux should cast an evil spell on
them."</p>

<p>"How big is the Bete du bon Dieu?"</p>

<p>"Nearly as big as a small retriever,&mdash;a monster, I tell you.
Ah! &mdash;I have asked myself more than once whether it was not
her that took our poor Mademoiselle by the throat with her claws.
But the Bete du bon Dieu does not wear hobnailed boots, nor fire
revolvers, nor has she a hand like that!" exclaimed Daddy Jacques,
again pointing out to us the red mark on the wall. "Besides, we
should have seen her as well as we would have seen a man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Evidently," I said. "Before we had seen this "Yellow Room",
I had also asked myself whether the cat of Mother Angenoux&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You also!" cried Rouletabille.</p>

<p>"Didn’t you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not for a moment. After reading the article in the ‘Matin,’
I knew that a cat had nothing to do with the matter. But I swear
now that a frightful tragedy has been enacted here. You say nothing
about the Basque cap, or the handkerchief, found here, Daddy Jacques?"</p>

<p>"Of course, the magistrate has taken them," the old man answered,
hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"I haven’t seen either the handkerchief or the cap, yet I can
tell you how they are made," the reporter said to him gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are very clever," said Daddy Jacques, coughing and embarrassed.</p>

<p>"The handkerchief is a large one, blue with red stripes and the
cap is an old Basque cap, like the one you are wearing now."</p>

<p>"You are a wizard!" said Daddy Jacques, trying to laugh and not
quite succeeding. "How do you know that the handkerchief is blue
with red stripes?"</p>

<p>"Because, if it had not been blue with red stripes, it would
not have been found at all."</p>

<p>Without giving any further attention to Daddy Jacques, my friend
took a piece of paper from his pocket, and taking out a pair of
scissors, bent over the footprints. Placing the paper over one
of them he began to cut. In a short time he had made a perfect
pattern which he handed to me, begging me not to lose it.</p>

<p>He then returned to the window and, pointing to the figure of
Frederic Larsan, who had not quitted the side of the lake, asked
Daddy Jacques whether the detective had, like himself, been working
in "The Yellow Room"?</p>

<p>"No," replied Robert Darzac, who, since Rouletabille had handed
him the piece of scorched paper, had not uttered a word, "He pretends
that he does not need to examine "The Yellow Room". He says that
the murderer made his escape from it in quite a natural way, and
that he will, this evening, explain how he did it."</p>

<p>As he listened to what Monsieur Darzac had to say, Rouletabille
turned pale.</p>

<p>"Has Frederic Larsan found out the truth, which I can only guess
at?" he murmured. "He is very clever&mdash;very clever&mdash;and I admire
him. But what we have to do to-day is something more than the
work of a policeman, something quite different from the teachings
of experience. We have to take hold of our reason by the right
end."</p>

<p>The reporter rushed into the open air, agitated by the thought
that the great and famous Fred might anticipate him in the solution
of the problem of "The Yellow Room".</p>

<p>I managed to reach him on the threshold of the pavilion. "Calm
yourself, my dear fellow," I said. "Aren’t you satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he confessed to me, with a deep sigh. "I am quite satisfied.
I have discovered many things."</p>

<p>"Moral or material?"</p>

<p>"Several moral,&mdash;one material. This, for example."</p>

<p>And rapidly he drew from his waistcoat pocket a piece of paper
in which he had placed a light-coloured hair from a woman’s head.</p>
