<p>Ariel flitted so rapidly along the ledge that her lover felt
obliged to ask her to desist, as he found it difficult to keep
pace with her.</p>

<p>The narrow path ascended more rapidly than before, and he saw
they were steadily climbing toward the top of the roof.  The shelly
support to their feet, too, became less substantial, crumbling
and giving way at a rate that threatened the most serious consequences.</p>

<p>He again cautioned the maiden, who seemed to dart over the rocky
ground with the graceful ease of a bird, and without producing
any more effect, with her dainty sandals.</p>

<p>Suddenly she paused.  She had reached the margin or break in
the ledge. A chasm, whose black depths the eye could not fathom,
yawned between her and the support on the opposite side.</p>

<p>"We will make our stand here," said he; "keep behind me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself in astonishment; for, at that moment, she
bounded as lightly across as a fawn.  He never would have permitted
it had he dreamed of her intention; but it was done.</p>

<p>He could only follow, and, gathering his muscles, he ran rapidly
the slight distance and bounded from the support.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous leap, and, for one instant, he believed he
would fail; but he cleared the chasm of breathless darkness and
landed on the edge, where, for a single second, he tottered between
life and death.</p>

<p>But, at the critical instant, a tiny hand was outstretched, and,
seizing one of the fluttering arms, his poise was restored, and
he stood firmly by her side.</p>

<p>Even then, as he stepped forward, the ground crumbled and gave
way for fully two feet, the debris rattling down the abyss as
long as the ear could detect the sound, growing fainter and fainter
as it hastened toward the far-away bottom.</p>

<p>"There is no one in that party except Ziffak who can leap it
now," said Ashman, gazing with a shudder behind him.</p>

<p>By this time the pursuers were close at hand and gaining fast.</p>

<p>The ledge led straight away and upward for a hundred feet, when
it terminated at a point in the dome as high as the middle portion. 
There the rocks were piled in irregular masses, and, knowing they
could go no further, Ashman resolved that the last stand should
be made there.</p>

<p>As he hurried onward, another shout fell upon his ear.  It was
a different voice, and he recognized it as Waggaman's, who was
leading the advance.</p>

<p>The fugitive glanced backward, while toiling up the slope, and
saw that the white man in his eagerness was fully a rod ahead
of the herculean Ziffak, while the rest were stringing along behind
him.</p>

<p>He might have wondered how the chieftain contrived to lose so
much ground had he not seen him clambering to his feet.  It followed
that he must have fallen in his hurry to get forward.</p>

<p>"We have them!" shouted the exultant convict; "there is no escape;
they are cornered!"</p>

<p>The words were yet ringing in his mouth, when he came to a stop.</p>

<p>He had reached the edge of the abyss and might well pause before
trying to leap across.</p>

<p>The fierce king called to him to make the jump.  It had been
done not only by the man, but by the girl who preceded him; why
should he hesitate?</p>

<p>Spurred by the taunt, the white man withdrew a few paces, and,
like Ashman, ran swiftly, the next instant his body rising in
air, as he made the fatal effort.</p>

<p>The American stood coolly watching the result.  If the miscreant
succeeded, where it looked impossible, he meant to shoot him. 
Thus the prospect before the convict could not have been worse.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous leap indeed, and the fellow struck the opposite
ledge with his chest, his feet dropping below.</p>

<p>In his furious efforts to save himself, he let go of his weapon,
which went ringing down the chasm, and seized the ledge with both
hands.</p>

<p>Even then, had the ground been firm, he might have succeeded,
but it gave way like rotten ice, and, with a shriek of agony,
he vanished forever from the sight of men.</p>

<p>The frightful occurrence brought the pursuers to a halt and gave
the fugitives a minute or two in which to prepare for the end.</p>

<p>Ariel, by command of her lover, placed herself behind the rocks
and bowlders, where she was secure against any of the missiles,
that were sure to be soon flying through the air.  Ashman also
placed himself so that all of his body was hidden, except his
head and shoulders, but his Winchester was thrust out, ready for
instant use.  He was resolved that no one of the party should
leap that chasm and live after reaching the other side.</p>

<p>There were two exceptions, be it remembered, to this resolution.</p>

<p>Ziffak, being next to Waggaman, approached the chasm, where he
also stopped and peered into the impenetrable depth, his dusky
face showing a horrified expression at the awful fate that had
befallen the foremost of the little party.</p>

<p>Ashman, who was closely watching the chieftain with a natural
wonder us to how he would conduct himself (for he did not waver
in his faith that the giant was still loyal to him), saw him suddenly
raise his eyes and gaze at the opposite ledge, which was fully
two feet above that upon which he was standing.</p>

<p>Haffgo was immediately behind him, and peering under his arms
at the opening.  There being no room for the two to stand beside
each other, this was the nearest position he could secure.</p>

<p>Beyond him the other figures could be partly discerned, all standing
motionless until some way should present itself for their advance.</p>

<p>Ashman observed the chieftain, as his eyes followed the ledge
until they rested upon him, crouching behind one of the bowlders
with his rifle leveled at the war party.</p>

<p>The two looked into each other's eyes for a single instant, when
Ziffak, knowing he could not be seen by any of those behind, contracted
his brows and moved his lips.</p>

<p>He did not speak, for that would have "given the whole thing
away," but his dusky mouth was contorted with such vigorous care
that the words were understood, as readily as if shouted aloud.</p>

<p>They formed the single sentence,</p>

<p>"<em>I am your friend!</em>"</p>

<p>No need of saying that, for, as we have stated, Fred Ashman had
never doubted it.</p>

<p>Haffgo now began urging his brother to make the leap, which had
proven the death of Waggaman, saying, with reason, that the strength
and activity of the head chieftain of the Murhapas were sure to
carry him over where no one else could succeed.</p>

<p>The two talked in their native tongue, but their meaning was
so clear that the American needed no one to interpret the words.</p>

<p>Ziffak replied that he would gladly do so, but for the treacherous
character of the other side of the ledge.  He showed that considerable
had fallen away, and intimated that the fugitives had loosened
it for the purpose of entrapping all the party just as Waggaman
had been entrapped.</p>

<p>Then the king took another look at the chasm.  It so happened
that while he was doing this, a large slice of the ledge sloughed
off and went down the abyss, after the miserable wretch who must
have been lying at that moment a shapeless mass far down the fearful
gorge.</p>

<p>Haffgo could not gainsay such testimony, and, for the first time,
his face showed an expression of disappointment.  It was not the
look of a baffled man, but of one forced to see a sweet pleasure
deferred.</p>

<p>He had only to peer up the ledge, as it led toward the roof,
to realize that the fugitives were as safely caged as if bound
and secured in his own home.</p>

<p>They had penetrated as far as possible in the cavern of diamonds. 
If the pursuers could not reach them, neither could they return
over the chasm by which they had attained the spot where they
still defied him.</p>

<p>The most athletic man living could not leap across that chasm,
nor could it be passed until it was bridged artificially, and
that could only be accomplished from below, where the pursuers
were glaring across.  They might erect a structure, if, the king
so willed, which would open a way of advance; but he was in no
mood to care for or think of anything of the kind.</p>

<p>Haffgo now talked earnestly for a few minutes to his head chieftain.
The latter listened respectfully, nodding his head several times
in acquiescence.  Then he suddenly looked up the ledge again,
steadied himself for an instant, and hurled his javelin with terrific
force at the head of Ashman.</p>

<p>It was done with such incredible deftness that the American had
no time in which to dodge the fearful missile.  Had it been accurately
aimed, it would have been driven straight through his skull!</p>

<p>But it missed by a hair's breadth, shooting up to the roof, where
it struck the rock with such violence that the head was shattered
and the remaining portion fell uselessly down among the rocks.</p>

<p>It was a close call, but Ashman was not frightened; he knew why
it missed him.</p>

<p>He now sighted along the barrel, as if he meant to shoot the
chieftain, who instantly ducked his head, and began crowding backward. 
It was the first time King Haffgo had been placed in such a grave
situation, and he was panic-stricken.  He turned so suddenly and
began crowding to the rear so hard, that he came within a hair
of precipitating himself and those immediately behind him from
the ledge.</p>

<p>But Ashman did not pull trigger.  He could not do so without
endangering the lives of Ziffak and the king, and as yet the other
warriors had made no demonstration against him.</p>

<p>But, seeing that the white man did not fire, Ziffak seemed to
gather courage and straightened up again.  The king passed his
own javelin to him, and he glared up the ledge as if looking for
another favorable chance to launch, it with greater effect than
before.</p>

<p>Ashman, who was narrowly watching every movement of his enemies,
now observed that the warrior directly behind the king, carried
a bow and arrow, and he was in the act of fitting a missile to
the string, with the evident intention of trying his hand at the
business in which the head chieftain had failed only a minute
before.</p>
