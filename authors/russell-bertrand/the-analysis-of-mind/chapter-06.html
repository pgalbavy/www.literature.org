<p>One of the main purposes of these lectures is to give grounds
for the belief that the distinction between mind and matter is
not so fundamental as is commonly supposed. In the preceding lecture
I dealt in outline with the physical side of this problem. I attempted
to show that what we call a material object is not itself a substance,
but is a system of particulars analogous in their nature to sensations,
and in fact often including actual sensations among their number.
In this way the stuff of which physical objects are composed is
brought into relation with the stuff of which part, at least,
of our mental life is composed.</p>

<p>There is, however, a converse task which is equally necessary
for our thesis, and that is, to show that the stuff of our mental
life is devoid of many qualities which it is commonly supposed
to have, and is not possessed of any attributes which make it
incapable of forming part of the world of matter. In the present
lecture I shall begin the arguments for this view.</p>

<p>Corresponding to the supposed duality of matter and mind, there
are, in orthodox psychology, two ways of knowing what exists.
One of these, the way of sensation and external perception, is
supposed to furnish data for our knowledge of matter, the other,
called "introspection," is supposed to furnish data for knowledge
of our mental processes. To common sense, this distinction seems
clear and easy. When you see a friend coming along the street,
you acquire knowledge of an external, physical fact; when you
realize that you are glad to meet him, you acquire knowledge of
a mental fact. Your dreams and memories and thoughts, of which
you are often conscious, are mental facts, and the process by
which you become aware of them <em>SEEMS </em>to be different
from sensation. Kant calls it the "inner sense"; sometimes it
is spoken of as "consciousness of self"; but its commonest name
in modern English psychology is "introspection." It is this supposed
method of acquiring knowledge of our mental processes that I wish
to analyse and examine in this lecture.</p>

<p>I will state at the outset the view which I shall aim at establishing.
I believe that the stuff of our mental life, as opposed to its
relations and structure, consists wholly of sensations and images.
Sensations are connected with matter in the way that I tried to
explain in Lecture V, i.e. each is a member of a system which
is a certain physical object. Images, though they <em>USUALLY
</em>have certain characteristics, especially lack of vividness,
that distinguish them from sensations, are not <em>INVARIABLY
</em>so distinguished, and cannot therefore be defined by these
characteristics. Images, as opposed to sensations, can only be
defined by their different causation: they are caused by association
with a sensation, not by a stimulus external to the nervous system&mdash;or
perhaps one should say external to the brain, where the higher
animals are concerned. The occurrence of a sensation or image
does not in itself constitute knowledge but any sensation or image
may come to be known if the conditions are suitable. When a sensation&mdash;like
the hearing of a clap of thunder&mdash;is normally correlated with
closely similar sensations in our neighbours, we regard it as
giving knowledge of the external world, since we regard the whole
set of similar sensations as due to a common external cause. But
images and bodily sensations are not so correlated. Bodily sensations
can be brought into a correlation by physiology, and thus take
their place ultimately among sources of knowledge of the physical
world. But images cannot be made to fit in with the simultaneous
sensations and images of others. Apart from their hypothetical
causes in the brain, they have a causal connection with physical
objects, through the fact that they are copies of past sensations;
but the physical objects with which they are thus connected are
in the past, not in the present. These images remain private in
a sense in which sensations are not. A sensation <em>SEEMS </em>to
give us knowledge of a present physical object, while an image
does not, except when it amounts to a hallucination, and in this
case the seeming is deceptive. Thus the whole context of the two
occurrences is different. But in themselves they do not differ
profoundly, and there is no reason to invoke two different ways
of knowing for the one and for the other. Consequently introspection
as a separate kind of knowledge disappears.</p>

<p>The criticism of introspection has been in the main the work
of American psychologists. I will begin by summarizing an article
which seems to me to afford a good specimen of their arguments,
namely, "The Case against Introspection," by Knight Dunlap ("Psychological
Review," vol xix, No. 5, pp. 404-413, September, 1912). After
a few historical quotations, he comes to two modern defenders
of introspection, Stout and James. He quotes from Stout such statements
as the following: "Psychical states as such become objects only
when we attend to them in an introspective way. Otherwise they
are not themselves objects, but only constituents of the process
by which objects are recognized" ("Manual," 2nd edition, p. 134.
The word "recognized" in Dunlap's quotation should be "cognized.")
"The object itself can never be identified with the present modification
of the individual's consciousness by which it is cognized" (ib.
p. 60). This is to be true even when we are thinking about modifications
of our own consciousness; such modifications are to be always
at least partially distinct from the conscious experience in which
we think of them.</p>

<p>At this point I wish to interrupt the account of Knight Dunlap's
article in order to make some observations on my own account with
reference to the above quotations from Stout. In the first place,
the conception of "psychical states" seems to me one which demands
analysis of a somewhat destructive character. This analysis I
shall give in later lectures as regards cognition; I have already
given it as regards desire. In the second place, the conception
of "objects" depends upon a certain view as to cognition which
I believe to be wholly mistaken, namely, the view which I discussed
in my first lecture in connection with Brentano. In this view
a single cognitive occurrence contains both content and object,
the content being essentially mental, while the object is physical
except in introspection and abstract thought. I have already criticized
this view, and will not dwell upon it now, beyond saying that
"the process by which objects are cognized" appears to be a very
slippery phrase. When we "see a table," as common sense would
say, the table as a physical object is not the "object" (in the
psychological sense) of our perception. Our perception is made
up of sensations, images and beliefs, but the supposed "object"
is something inferential, externally related, not logically bound
up with what is occurring in us. This question of the nature of
the object also affects the view we take of self-consciousness.
Obviously, a "conscious experience" is different from a physical
object; therefore it is natural to assume that a thought or perception
whose object is a conscious experience must be different from
a thought or perception whose object is a physical object. But
if the relation to the object is inferential and external, as
I maintain, the difference between two thoughts may bear very
little relation to the difference between their objects. And to
speak of "the present modification of the individual's consciousness
by which an object is cognized" is to suggest that the cognition
of objects is a far more direct process, far more intimately bound
up with the objects, than I believe it to be. All these points
will be amplified when we come to the analysis of knowledge, but
it is necessary briefly to state them now in order to suggest
the atmosphere in which our analysis of "introspection" is to
be carried on.</p>

<p>Another point in which Stout's remarks seem to me to suggest
what I regard as mistakes is his use of "consciousness." There
is a view which is prevalent among psychologists, to the effect
that one can speak of "a conscious experience" in a curious dual
sense, meaning, on the one hand, an experience which is conscious
of something, and, on the other hand, an experience which has
some intrinsic nature characteristic of what is called "consciousness."
That is to say, a "conscious experience" is characterized on the
one hand by relation to its object and on the other hand by being
composed of a certain peculiar stuff, the stuff of "consciousness."
And in many authors there is yet a third confusion: a "conscious
experience," in this third sense, is an experience of which we
are conscious. All these, it seems to me, need to be clearly separated.
To say that one occurrence is "conscious" of another is, to my
mind, to assert an external and rather remote relation between
them. I might illustrate it by the relation of uncle and nephew
a man becomes an uncle through no effort of his own, merely through
an occurrence elsewhere. Similarly, when you are said to be "conscious"
of a table, the question whether this is really the case cannot
be decided by examining only your state of mind: it is necessary
also to ascertain whether your sensation is having those correlates
which past experience causes you to assume, or whether the table
happens, in this case, to be a mirage. And, as I explained in
my first lecture, I do not believe that there is any "stuff" of
consciousness, so that there is no intrinsic character by which
a "conscious" experience could be distinguished from any other.</p>

<p>After these preliminaries, we can return to Knight Dunlap's article.
His criticism of Stout turns on the difficulty of giving any empirical
meaning to such notions as the "mind" or the "subject"; he quotes
from Stout the sentence: "The most important drawback is that
the mind, in watching its own workings, must necessarily have
its attention divided between two objects," and he concludes:
"Without question, Stout is bringing in here illicitly the concept
of a single observer, and his introspection does not provide for
the observation of this observer; for the process observed and
the observer are distinct" (p. 407). The objections to any theory
which brings in the single observer were considered in Lecture
I, and were acknowledged to be cogent. In so far, therefore, as
Stout's theory of introspection rests upon this assumption, we
are compelled to reject it. But it is perfectly possible to believe
in introspection without supposing that there is a single observer.</p>

<p>William James's theory of introspection, which Dunlap next examines,
does not assume a single observer. It changed after the publication
of his "Psychology," in consequence of his abandoning the dualism
of thought and things. Dunlap summarizes his theory as follows:</p>

<p>"The essential points in James's scheme of consciousness are
<em>SUBJECT, OBJECT, </em>and a <em>KNOWING </em>of the object
by the subject. The difference between James's scheme and other
schemes involving the same terms is that James considers subject
and object to be the same thing, but at different times In order
to satisfy this requirement James supposes a realm of existence
which he at first called 'states of consciousness' or 'thoughts,'
and later, 'pure experience,' the latter term including both the
'thoughts' and the 'knowing.' This scheme, with all its magnificent
artificiality, James held on to until the end, simply dropping
the term consciousness and the dualism between the thought and
an external reality"(p. 409).</p>

<p>He adds: "All that James's system really amounts to is the acknowledgment
that a succession of things are known, and that they are known
by something. This is all any one can claim, except for the fact
that the things are known together, and that the knower for the
different items is one and the same" (ib.).</p>

<p>In this statement, to my mind, Dunlap concedes far more than
James did in his later theory. I see no reason to suppose that
"the knower for different items is one and the same," and I am
convinced that this proposition could not possibly be ascertained
except by introspection of the sort that Dunlap rejects. The first
of these points must wait until we come to the analysis of belief:
the second must be considered now. Dunlap's view is that there
is a dualism of subject and object, but that the subject can never
become object, and therefore there is no awareness of an awareness.
He says in discussing the view that introspection reveals the
occurrence of knowledge: "There can be no denial of the existence
of the thing (knowing) which is alleged to be known or observed
in this sort of 'introspection.' The allegation that the knowing
is observed is that which may be denied. Knowing there certainly
is; known, the knowing certainly is not"(p. 410). And again: "I
am never aware of an awareness" (ib.). And on the next page: "It
may sound paradoxical to say that one cannot observe the process
(or relation) of observation, and yet may be certain that there
is such a process: but there is really no inconsistency in the
saying. How do I know that there is awareness? By being aware
of something. There is no meaning in the term 'awareness' which
is not expressed in the statement 'I am aware of a colour (or
what-not).'"</p>

<p>But the paradox cannot be so lightly disposed of. The statement
"I am aware of a colour" is assumed by Knight Dunlap to be known
to be true, but he does not explain how it comes to be known.
The argument against him is not conclusive, since he may be able
to show some valid way of inferring our awareness. But he does
not suggest any such way. There is nothing odd in the hypothesis
of beings which are aware of objects, but not of their own awareness;
it is, indeed, highly probable that young children and the higher
animals are such beings. But such beings cannot make the statement
"I am aware of a colour," which WE can make. We have, therefore,
some knowledge which they lack. It is necessary to Knight Dunlap's
position to maintain that this additional knowledge is purely
inferential, but he makes no attempt to show how the inference
is possible. It may, of course, be possible, but I cannot see
how. To my mind the fact (which he admits) that we know there
is awareness, is <em>ALL BUT </em>decisive against his theory,
and in favour of the view that we can be aware of an awareness.</p>

<p>Dunlap asserts (to return to James) that the real ground for
James's original belief in introspection was his belief in two
sorts of objects, namely, thoughts and things. He suggests that
it was a mere inconsistency on James's part to adhere to introspection
after abandoning the dualism of thoughts and things. I do not
wholly agree with this view, but it is difficult to disentangle
the difference as to introspection from the difference as to the
nature of knowing. Dunlap suggests (p. 411) that what is called
introspection really consists of awareness of "images," visceral
sensations, and so on. This view, in essence, seems to me sound.
But then I hold that knowing itself consists of such constituents
suitably related, and that in being aware of them we are sometimes
being aware of instances of knowing. For this reason, much as
I agree with his view as to what are the objects of which there
is awareness, I cannot wholly agree with his conclusion as to
the impossibility of introspection.</p>

<p>The behaviourists have challenged introspection even more vigorously
than Knight Dunlap, and have gone so far as to deny the existence
of images. But I think that they have confused various things
which are very commonly confused, and that it is necessary to
make several distinctions before we can arrive at what is true
and what false in the criticism of introspection.</p>

<p>I wish to distinguish three distinct questions, any one of which
may be meant when we ask whether introspection is a source of
knowledge. The three questions are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Can we observe anything about ourselves which we cannot observe
about other people, or is everything we can observe <em>PUBLIC,
</em>in the sense that another could also observe it if suitably
placed?</p>

<p>(2) Does everything that we can observe obey the laws of physics
and form part of the physical world, or can we observe certain
things that lie outside physics?</p>

<p>(3) Can we observe anything which differs in its intrinsic nature
from the constituents of the physical world, or is everything
that we can observe composed of elements intrinsically similar
to the constituents of what is called matter?</p>

<p>Any one of these three questions may be used to define introspection.
I should favour introspection in the sense of the first question,
i.e. I think that some of the things we observe cannot, even theoretically,
be observed by any one else. The second question, tentatively
and for the present, I should answer in favour of introspection;
I think that images, in the actual condition of science, cannot
be brought under the causal laws of physics, though perhaps ultimately
they may be. The third question I should answer adversely to introspection
I think that observation shows us nothing that is not composed
of sensations and images, and that images differ from sensations
in their causal laws, not intrinsically. I shall deal with the
three questions successively.</p>

<p>(1) <em>PUBLICITY OR PRIVACY OF WHAT IS OBSERVED. </em>Confining
ourselves, for the moment, to sensations, we find that there are
different degrees of publicity attaching to different sorts of
sensations. If you feel a toothache when the other people in the
room do not, you are in no way surprised; but if you hear a clap
of thunder when they do not, you begin to be alarmed as to your
mental condition. Sight and hearing are the most public of the
senses; smell only a trifle less so; touch, again, a trifle less,
since two people can only touch the same spot successively, not
simultaneously. Taste has a sort of semi-publicity, since people
seem to experience similar taste-sensations when they eat similar
foods; but the publicity is incomplete, since two people cannot
eat actually the same piece of food.</p>

<p>But when we pass on to bodily sensations&mdash;headache, toothache,
hunger, thirst, the feeling of fatigue, and so on&mdash;we get quite
away from publicity, into a region where other people can tell
us what they feel, but we cannot directly observe their feeling.
As a natural result of this state of affairs, it has come to be
thought that the public senses give us knowledge of the outer
world, while the private senses only give us knowledge as to our
own bodies. As regards privacy, all images, of whatever sort,
belong with the sensations which only give knowledge of our own
bodies, i.e. each is only observable by one observer. This is
the reason why images of sight and hearing are more obviously
different from sensations of sight and hearing than images of
bodily sensations are from bodily sensations; and that is why
the argument in favour of images is more conclusive in such cases
as sight and hearing than in such cases as inner speech.</p>

<p>The whole distinction of privacy and publicity, however, so long
as we confine ourselves to sensations, is one of degree, not of
kind. No two people, there is good empirical reason to think,
ever have exactly similar sensations related to the same physical
object at the same moment; on the other hand, even the most private
sensation has correlations which would theoretically enable another
observer to infer it.</p>

<p>That no sensation is ever completely public, results from differences
of point of view. Two people looking at the same table do not
get the same sensation, because of perspective and the way the
light falls. They get only correlated sensations. Two people listening
to the same sound do not hear exactly the same thing, because
one is nearer to the source of the sound than the other, one has
better hearing than the other, and so on. Thus publicity in sensations
consists, not in having <em>PRECISELY </em>similar sensations,
but in having more or less similar sensations correlated according
to ascertainable laws. The sensations which strike us as public
are those where the correlated sensations are very similar and
the correlations are very easy to discover. But even the most
private sensations have correlations with things that others can
observe. The dentist does not observe your ache, but he can see
the cavity which causes it, and could guess that you are suffering
even if you did not tell him. This fact, however, cannot be used,
as Watson would apparently wish, to extrude from science observations
which are private to one observer, since it is by means of many
such observations that correlations are established, e.g. between
toothaches and cavities. Privacy, therefore does not by itself
make a datum unamenable to scientific treatment. On this point,
the argument against introspection must be rejected.</p>

<p>(2) <em>DOES EVERYTHING OBSERVABLE OBEY THE LAWS OF PHYSICS?
</em>We come now to the second ground of objection to introspection,
namely, that its data do not obey the laws of physics. This, though
less emphasized, is, I think, an objection which is really more
strongly felt than the objection of privacy. And we obtain a definition
of introspection more in harmony with usage if we define it as
observation of data not subject to physical laws than if we define
it by means of privacy. No one would regard a man as introspective
because he was conscious of having a stomach ache. Opponents of
introspection do not mean to deny the obvious fact that we can
observe bodily sensations which others cannot observe. For example,
Knight Dunlap contends that images are really muscular contractions,*
and evidently regards our awareness of muscular contractions as
not coming under the head of introspection. I think it will be
found that the essential characteristic of introspective data,
in the sense which now concerns us, has to do with <em>LOCALIZATION:
</em>either they are not localized at all, or they are localized,
like visual images, in a place already physically occupied by
something which would be inconsistent with them if they were regarded
as part of the physical world. If you have a visual image of your
friend sitting in a chair which in fact is empty, you cannot locate
the image in your body, because it is visual, nor (as a physical
phenomenon) in the chair, because the chair, as a physical object,
is empty. Thus it seems to follow that the physical world does
not include all that we are aware of, and that images, which are
introspective data, have to be regarded, for the present, as not
obeying the laws of physics; this is, I think, one of the chief
reasons why an attempt is made to reject them. I shall try to
show in Lecture <em>VIII </em>that the purely empirical reasons
for accepting images are overwhelming. But we cannot be nearly
so certain that they will not ultimately be brought under the
laws of physics. Even if this should happen, however, they would
still be distinguishable from sensations by their proximate causal
laws, as gases remain distinguishable from solids.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>(3) <em>CAN WE OBSERVE ANYTHING INTRINSICALLY DIFFERENT FROM
SENSATIONS? </em>We come now to our third question concerning
introspection. It is commonly thought that by looking within we
can observe all sorts of things that are radically different from
the constituents of the physical world, e.g. thoughts, beliefs,
desires, pleasures, pains and emotions. The difference between
mind and matter is increased partly by emphasizing these supposed
introspective data, partly by the supposition that matter is composed
of atoms or electrons or whatever units physics may at the moment
prefer. As against this latter supposition, I contend that the
ultimate constituents of matter are not atoms or electrons, but
sensations, and other things similar to sensations as regards
extent and duration. As against the view that introspection reveals
a mental world radically different from sensations, I propose
to argue that thoughts, beliefs, desires, pleasures, pains and
emotions are all built up out of sensations and images alone,
and that there is reason to think that images do not differ from
sensations in their intrinsic character. We thus effect a mutual
rapprochement of mind and matter, and reduce the ultimate data
of introspection (in our second sense) to images alone. On this
third view of the meaning of introspection, therefore, our decision
is wholly against it.</p>

<p>There remain two points to be considered concerning introspection.
The first is as to how far it is trustworthy; the second is as
to whether, even granting that it reveals no radically different
<em>STUFF </em>from that revealed by what might be called external
perception, it may not reveal different <em>RELATIONS, </em>and
thus acquire almost as much importance as is traditionally assigned
to it.</p>

<p>To begin with the trustworthiness of introspection. It is common
among certain schools to regard the knowledge of our own mental
processes as incomparably more certain than our knowledge of the
"external" world; this view is to be found in the British philosophy
which descends from Hume, and is present, somewhat veiled, in
Kant and his followers. There seems no reason whatever to accept
this view. Our spontaneous, unsophisticated beliefs, whether as
to ourselves or as to the outer world, are always extremely rash
and very liable to error. The acquisition of caution is equally
necessary and equally difficult in both directions. Not only are
we often un aware of entertaining a belief or desire which exists
in us; we are often actually mistaken. The fallibility of introspection
as regards what we desire is made evident by psycho-analysis;
its fallibility as to what we know is easily demonstrated. An
autobiography, when confronted by a careful editor with documentary
evidence, is usually found to be full of obviously inadvertent
errors. Any of us confronted by a forgotten letter written some
years ago will be astonished to find how much more foolish our
opinions were than we had remembered them as being. And as to
the analysis of our mental operations&mdash;believing, desiring, willing,
or what not&mdash;introspection unaided gives very little help: it
is necessary to construct hypotheses and test them by their consequences,
just as we do in physical science. Introspection, therefore, though
it is one among our sources of knowledge, is not, in isolation,
in any degree more trustworthy than "external" perception.</p>

<p>I come now to our second question: Does introspection give us
materials for the knowledge of relations other than those arrived
at by reflecting upon external perception? It might be contended
that the essence of what is "mental" consists of relations, such
as knowing for example, and that our knowledge concerning these
essentially mental relations is entirely derived from introspection.
If "knowing" were an unanalysable relation, this view would be
incontrovertible, since clearly no such relation forms part of
the subject matter of physics. But it would seem that "knowing"
is really various relations, all of them complex. Therefore, until
they have been analysed, our present question must remain unanswered
I shall return to it at the end of the present course of lectures.</p>
