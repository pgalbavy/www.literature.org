<p>The scow containing the three fugitives was nearing the eastern
shore of the Susquehanna, when the negro servant, Gravity Gimp,
stopped, checking the craft by grasping the stern.</p>

<p>At that moment the water scarcely reached his waist, and was
shoaling at every step, so that the boat was entirely under his
control.</p>

<p>He had good cause for his alarm, for, only an instant before,
he had looked behind him at the group of Tories and Indians on
the western shore, who had stopped firing, and he saw that several
had entered the river with the intention of pushing the pursuit
through the desolate wilderness already spoken of as the "Shades
of Death."</p>

<p>The distance between the pursuer and pursued was slight, for
the Susquehanna is not a very broad river where it meanders through
the Wyoming Valley, and there remained so much of daylight that
the danger of a collision with their enemies was threatening indeed.</p>

<p>Still the sight increased the efforts to avoid them, and Gravity
had not lost his heart by any means, when he looked over the heads
of his friends to decide where they were to land.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that they had started below where most of
the fugitives were pushing for the other bank, and the action
of the current had carried them still lower, so there was reason
for hoping they were outside of immediate peril.</p>

<p>But the African had no more than fixed his eye on the point,
where there was much wood and undergrowth, than he noticed an
agitation of the bushes, and, to his dismay, a tall figure clad
in paint and feathers stepped forth to view.</p>

<p>He had a long rifle in one hand, and was daubed in the hideous
fashion of the wild Indian on the war-path.</p>

<p>The fact that he advanced thus openly in front of the fugitives,
who had been exchanging shots with their foes behind them, was
proof to Gravity that he was only one of a large party hidden
in the bushes, and into whose hands he and his friends were about
to throw themselves.</p>

<p>Thus it was that the little group was caught between two fires.</p>

<p>Worse than all, the two guns in the scow, with which something
like a fight might have been made, were empty, and it was out
of the question to reload them at this critical moment.</p>

<p>No wonder, therefore, when the faithful negro discovered the
trap into which they had run, that he straightened up, checked
the boat, and uttered the exclamation I have quoted.</p>

<p>The ladies, with blanched faces glanced from one shore to the
other, wondering to which party it was best to surrender themselves.</p>

<p>At this time, the warrior in front stood calmly contemplating
them, as if sure there was no escape, and nothing could be added
to the terror of the patriots.</p>

<p>"Let us turn down the river," said the brave-hearted Maggie,
thrusting the pole into the water again; "they have not captured
us yet, and it is better we should all be shot than fall into&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then the four were struck dumb by hearing the savage in
front call out:</p>

<p>"What have you stopped work for? Don't turn down the river; hurry
over, or those consarned Iroquois will overhaul you!"</p>

<p>Unquestionably that was not the voice of an Indian!</p>

<p>And yet the words were spoken by the painted individual who confronted
them, and whom they held in such terror.</p>

<p>He must have suspected their perplexity, for, noticing that they
still hesitated, his mouth expanded into a broad grin, as he added:</p>

<p>"Don't you know me? I'm Habakkuk McEwen, and I'm ready to do
all I can for you. Hurry up, Gravity; use that pole in the right
direction, Maggie; cheer up, Eva, and how are you, Aunt Peggy?"</p>

<p>No words can picture the relief of the little party, on learning
that he whom they mistook for an Indian was a white man and a
friend.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen was a neighbor, as he had called himself, and
came from the same section in Connecticut which furnished the
Brainerds and most of the settlers in the Wyoming Valley.</p>

<p>He had enlisted but a few months before, and, though not very
brilliant mentally, yet he was well liked in the settlement.</p>

<p>Excepting two individuals&mdash;whose identity the reader knows&mdash;it
may be safely said there was no one whom the patriots could have
been more pleased to see than Habakkuk, for he added so much strength
to the company that was sorely in need of it, but it may as well
be admitted, that the honest fellow, although a volunteer in the
defense of his country against the British invaders, was sometimes
lacking in the courage so necessary to the successful soldier.
However, there he was, and the words were scarcely out of his
mouth when the scow ran plump against the bank, the depth of the
water just permitting it, and Habakkuk cordially shook hands with
each as he helped them out, winding up with a fervid grip of the
African's huge palm.</p>

<p>His tongue was busy while thus engaged.</p>

<p>"You took me for an Injin, did you? Well, I'm pleased to hear
that, for it is complimentary to my skill, for that's what I got
up this rig for. I knowed what the danger was, and it struck me
that if I was going to sarcumvent Injins it was a good idea to
start out like one."</p>

<p>"Have you just arrived, Habakkuk?" asked Maggie.</p>

<p>"Not more than half an hour ago&mdash;you see&mdash;but let's get away
from this spot, for some of them loose bullets may hit us."</p>

<p>This was prudent advice, for their pursuers were at that moment
forcing their way through the river in pursuit.</p>

<p>"Gravity, you know this neighborhood better than I do&mdash;so take
the lead," said the disguised patriot: "and move lively, for I
begin to feel nervous."</p>

<p>"I kin move lively when dere's need ob it," replied the servant,
"and it looks to me as if there couldn't be a better time for
hurryin' dan dis identical one."</p>

<p>Gimp was familiar with the valley and mountains for miles around,
and he threw himself at once in the advance, the rest following
with rapid footsteps.</p>

<p>As they hastened toward the "Shades of Death" (and the name was
never more appropriate than on that eventful night), Habakkuk
McEwen explained how it was he arrived as he did.</p>

<p>"We fit the battle of Monmouth on the 28th of June, so you kin
see I've had to travel fast to git here even as late as I did.
But a lot of us heard that trouble was coming for Wyoming, and
we've been uneasy for a fortnight. Three of us went to Gineral
Washington and argufied the matter with him; he seemed to be worried
and anxious to do all he could, and he said that Connecticut orter
lend a hand, as we were her colony, but he was after the Britishers
just then, and he wouldn't 'low us to go till arter the battle.</p>

<p>"Wal, we had a first-class battle down there at Monmouth in Jersey,
and we and Molly Pitcher made the redcoats dance to the tune of
'Yankee Doodle' as they haven't danced since Saratoga and Trenton.
Whew! But wasn't the day hot, and didn't the dust fly along that
road! Well, I jus' felt when we had 'em on the run, that if the
Susquehanna could be turned down my throat, I would stand it for
a couple of hours.</p>

<p>"Howsumever, just as soon as the battle was over, and I seen
the Gineral had 'em, even though Gineral Lee tried to betray us,
why, I just pulled out and started for Wyoming.</p>

<p>"I didn't wait for the other chaps either, for, somehow or other,
I had the feeling strong that there wasn't an hour to spare down
in these parts. I traveled hard, and after crossing the upper
Delaware, I heard rumors that just made my hair stand on end.</p>

<p>"I knowed that the Tories and Iroquois were on their way, and
when I stopped at the house of a settler only twenty miles off,
I found him packing up and getting ready to move to Stroudsburg.</p>

<p>"I tried to persuade him to go back with me and help the folks,
but he couldn't see why he should desert his own family, even
though there was scarcely any danger to 'em.</p>

<p>"He was the man, howsumever, who suggested to me that I had better
fix up as an Injin, and he furnished the paint, feathers, and
rig. He helped me to get inside of 'em, too, and when he was through,
and showed me a glass, I acterally thought I was a Seneca warrior
for the time, and, if I'd had a tomahawk, I'd been likely to have
tomahawked the settler and his family.</p>

<p>"As it was, I jumped into the air and give out a ringin' whoop,
and felt mighty savage and peart like; then I struck out for Wyoming,
and I've done some tall traveling, I can tell you. Everybody that
saw me took me for an Injin, and gave me a wide berth. Two men
shot at me, and I was just beginning to think there might be less
fun in playing Injin than appeared at first.</p>

<p>"Well," added the eccentric individual, "I got here too late
to take part in the battle, but I'm ready to do all I can to help
you out of your trouble, which looks powerful serious."</p>

<p>And the little band, as may well be imagined, were grateful beyond
expression to find that what was first taken to be a dreaded enemy
was after all a valuable friend.</p>
