<p></p>

<p>Yet when there was a stirring, and a clink of flint and steel, and
the form of a man crouching like a dog over a bone, at a red
splutter of fire, and she knew it was morning coming, it seemed to
her the night had passed too soon.</p>

<p>When the fire was going, she came out of her shelter with one real
desire left: for coffee.  The men were warming more tortillas.</p>

<p>&quot;Can we make coffee?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The young man looked at her, and she imagined the same faint spark
of derision in his eyes.  He shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;We don't take it,&quot; he said.  &quot;There is no time.&quot;</p>

<p>And the elder men, squatting on their haunches, looked up at her in
the terrible paling dawn, and there was not even derision in their
eyes.  Only that intense, yet remote, inhuman glitter which was
terrible to her.  They were inaccessible.  They could not see her
as a woman at all.  As if she WERE not a woman.  As if, perhaps,
her whiteness took away all her womanhood, and left her as some
giant, female white ant.  That was all they could see in her.</p>

<p>Before the sun was up, she was in the saddle again, and they were
climbing steeply, in the icy air.  The sun came, and soon she was
very hot, exposed to the glare in the bare places.  It seemed to
her they were climbing to the roof of the world.  Beyond against
heaven were slashes of snow.</p>

<p>During the course of the morning, they came to a place where the
horse could not go farther.  They rested for a time with a great
slant of living rock in front of them, like the glossy breast of
some earth-beast.  Across this rock, along a wavering crack, they
had to go.  It seemed to her that for hours she went in torment, on
her hands and knees, from crack to crevice, along the slanting face
of this pure rock-mountain.  An Indian in front and an Indian
behind walked slowly erect, shod with sandals of braided leather.
But she in her riding-boots dared not stand erect.</p>

<p>Yet what she wondered, all the time, was why she persisted in
clinging and crawling along these mile-long sheets of rock.  Why
she did not hurl herself down, and have done!  The world was below
her.</p>

<p>When they emerged at last on a stony slope, she looked back, and
saw the third Indian coming carrying her saddle and saddle-bags on
his back, the whole hung from a band across his forehead.  And he
had his hat in his hand, as he stepped slowly, with the slow, soft,
heavy tread of the Indian, unwavering in the chinks of rock, as if
along a scratch in the mountain's iron shield.</p>

<p>The stony slope led downwards.  The Indians seemed to grow excited.
One ran ahead at a slow trot, disappearing round the curve of
stones.  And the track curved round and down, till at last in the
full blaze of the mid-morning sun, they could see a valley below
them, between walls of rock, as in a great wide chasm let in the
mountains.  A green valley, with a river, and trees, and clusters
of low flat sparkling houses.  It was all tiny and perfect, three
thousand feet below.  Even the flat bridge over the stream, and the
square with the houses around it, the bigger buildings piled up at
opposite ends of the square, the tall cotton-wood trees, the
pastures and stretches of yellow-sere maize, the patches of brown
sheep or goats in the distance, on the slopes, the railed
enclosures by the stream-side.  There it was, all small and
perfect, looking magical, as any place will look magical, seen from
the mountains above.  The unusual thing was that the low houses
glittered white, whitewashed, looking like crystals of salt, or
silver.  This frightened her.</p>

<p>They began the long, winding descent at the head of the barranca,
following the stream that rushed and fell.  At first it was all
rocks: then the pine-trees began, and soon, the silver-limbed
aspens.  The flowers of autumn, big pink daisy-like flowers, and
white ones, and many yellow flowers, were in profusion.  But she
had to sit down and rest, she was so weary.  And she saw the bright
flowers shadowily, as pale shadows hovering, as one who is dead
must see them.</p>

<p>At length came grass and pasture-slopes between mingled aspen and
pine-trees.  A shepherd, naked in the sun save for his hat and his
cotton loin-cloth, was driving his brown sheep away.  In a grove of
trees they sat and waited, she and the young Indian.  The one with
the saddle had also gone forward.</p>

<p>They heard a sound of someone coming.  It was three men, in fine
sarapes of red and orange and yellow and black, and with brilliant
feather headdresses.  The oldest had his grey hair braided with
fur, and his red and orange-yellow sarape was covered with curious
black markings, like a leopard-skin.  The other two were not grey-
haired, but they were elders too.  Their blankets were in stripes,
and their headdresses not so elaborate.</p>

<p>The young Indian addressed the elders in a few quiet words.  They
listened without answering or looking at him or at the woman,
keeping their faces averted and their eyes turned to the ground,
only listening.  And at length they turned and looked at the woman.</p>

<p>The old chief, or medicine-man, whatever he was, had a deeply
wrinkled and lined face of dark bronze, with a few sparse grey
hairs round the mouth.  Two long braids of grey hair, braided with
fur and coloured feathers, hung on his shoulders.  And yet, it was
only his eyes that mattered.  They were black and of extraordinary
piercing strength, without a qualm of misgiving in their demonish,
dauntless power.  He looked into the eyes of the white woman with a
long, piercing look, seeking she knew not what.  She summoned all
her strength to meet his eyes and keep up her guard.  But it was no
good.  He was not looking at her as one human being looks at
another.  He never even perceived her resistance or her challenge,
but looked past them both, into she knew not what.</p>

<p>She could see it was hopeless to expect any human communication
with this old being.</p>

<p>He turned and said a few words to the young Indian.</p>

<p>&quot;He asks what do you seek here?&quot; said the young man in Spanish.</p>

<p>&quot;I?  Nothing!  I only came to see what it was like.&quot;</p>

<p>This was again translated, and the old man turned his eyes on her
once more.  Then he spoke again, in his low muttering tone, to the
young Indian.</p>

<p>&quot;He says, why does she leave her house with the white men?  Does
she want to bring the white man's God to the Chilchui?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, foolhardy.  &quot;I came away from the white man's
God myself.  I came to look for the God of Chilchui.&quot;</p>

<p>Profound silence followed, when this was translated.  Then the old
man spoke again, in a small voice almost of weariness.</p>

<p>&quot;Does the white woman seek the gods of the Chilchui because she is
weary of her own God?&quot; came the question.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, she does.  She is tired of the white man's God,&quot; she replied,
thinking that was what they wanted her to say.  She would like to
serve the gods of the Chilchui.</p>

<p>She was aware of an extraordinary thrill of triumph and exultance
passing through the Indians, in the tense silence that followed
when this was translated.  Then they all looked at her with
piercing black eyes, in which a steely covetous intent glittered
incomprehensible.  She was the more puzzled, as there was nothing
sensual or sexual in the look.  It had a terrible glittering purity
that was beyond her.  She was afraid, she would have been paralysed
with fear, had not something died within her, leaving her with a
cold, watchful wonder only.</p>

<p>The elders talked a little while, then the two went away, leaving
her with the young man and the oldest chief.  The old man now
looked at her with a certain solicitude.</p>

<p>&quot;He says are you tired?&quot; asked the young man.</p>

<p>&quot;Very tired,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;The men will bring you a carriage,&quot; said the young Indian.</p>

<p>The carriage, when it came, proved to be a litter consisting of a
sort of hammock of dark woollen frieze, slung on to a pole which
was borne on the shoulders of two long-haired Indians.  The woollen
hammock was spread on the ground, she sat down on it, and the two
men raised the pole to their shoulders.  Swinging rather as if she
were in a sack, she was carried out of the grove of trees,
following the old chief, whose leopard-spotted blanket moved
curiously in the sunlight.</p>

<p>They had emerged in the valley-head.  Just in front were the maize
fields, with ripe ears of maize.  The corn was not very tall, in
this high altitude.  The well-worn path went between it, and all
she could see was the erect form of the old chief, in the flame and
black sarape, stepping soft and heavy and swift, his head forward,
looking to neither to right nor left.  Her bearers followed,
stepping rhythmically, the long blue-black hair glistening like a
river down the naked shoulders of the man in front.</p>

<p>They passed the maize, and came to a big wall or earthwork made of
earth and adobe bricks.  The wooden doors were open.  Passing on,
they were in a network of small gardens, full of flowers and herbs
and fruit trees, each garden watered by a tiny ditch of running
water.  Among each cluster of trees and flowers was a small,
glittering white house, windowless, and with closed door.  The
place was a network of little paths, small streams, and little
bridges among square, flowering gardens.</p>

<p>Following the broadest path - a soft narrow track between leaves and
grass, a path worn smooth by centuries of human feet, no hoof of
horse nor any wheel to disfigure it - they came to the little river
of swift bright water, and crossed on a log bridge.  Everything was
silent - there was no human being anywhere.  The road went on under
magnificent cotton-wood trees.  It emerged suddenly outside the
central plaza or square of the village.</p>

<p>This was a long oblong of low white houses with flat roofs, and two
bigger buildings, having as it were little square huts piled on top
of bigger long huts, stood at either end of the oblong, facing each
other rather askew.  Every little house was a dazzling white, save
for the great round beam-ends which projected under the flat eaves,
and for the flat roofs.  Round each of the bigger buildings, on the
outside of the square, was a stockyard fence, inside which was
garden with trees and flowers, and various small houses.</p>

<p>Not a soul was in sight.  They passed silently between the houses
into the central square.  This was quite bare and arid, the earth
trodden smooth by endless generations of passing feet, passing
across from door to door.  All the doors of the windowless houses
gave on to this blank square, but all the doors were closed.  The
firewood lay near the threshold, a clay oven was still smoking, but
there was no sign of moving life.</p>

<p>The old man walked straight across the square to the big house at
the end, where the two upper storeys, as in a house of toy bricks,
stood each one smaller than the lower one.  A stone staircase,
outside, led up to the roof of the first storey.</p>

<p>At the foot of this staircase the litter-bearers stood still, and
lowered the woman to the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;You will come up,&quot; said the young Indian who spoke Spanish.</p>

<p>She mounted the stone stairs to the earthen roof of the first
house, which formed a platform round the wall of the second storey.
She followed around this platform to the back of the big house.
There they descended again, into the garden at the rear.</p>

<p>So far they had seen no one.  But now two men appeared, bare-
headed, with long braided hair, and wearing a sort of white shirt
gathered into a loin-cloth.  These went along with the three
newcomers, across the garden where red flowers and yellow flowers
were blooming, to a long, low white house.  There they entered
without knocking.</p>

<p>It was dark inside.  There was a low murmur of men's voices.
Several men were present, their white shirts showing in the gloom,
their dark faces invisible.  They were sitting on a great log of
smooth old wood, that lay along the far wall.  And save for this
log, the room seemed empty.  But no, in the dark at one end was a
couch, a sort of bed, and someone lying there, covered with furs.</p>

<p>The old Indian in the spotted sarape, who had accompanied the
woman, now took off his hat and his blanket and his sandals.
Laying them aside, he approached the couch, and spoke in a low
voice.  For some moments there was no answer.  Then an old man with
the snow-white hair hanging round his darkly-visible face, roused
himself like a vision, and leaned on one elbow, looking vaguely at
the company, in tense silence.</p>

<p>The grey-haired Indian spoke again, and then the young Indian,
taking the woman's hand, led her forward.  In her linen riding
habit, and black boots and hat, and her pathetic bit of a red tie,
she stood there beside the fur-covered bed of the old, old man, who
sat reared up, leaning on one elbow, remote as a ghost, his white
hair streaming in disorder, his face almost black, yet with a far-
off intentness, not of this world, leaning forward to look at her.</p>

<p>His face was so old, it was like dark glass, and the few curling
hairs that sprang white from his lips and chin were quite
incredible.  The long white locks fell unbraided and disorderly on
either side of the glassy dark face.  And under a faint powder of
white eyebrows, the black eyes of the old chief looked at her as if
from the far, far dead, seeing something that was never to be seen.</p>

<p>At last he spoke a few deep, hollow words, as if to the dark air.</p>

<p>&quot;He says, do you bring your heart to the god of the Chilchui?&quot;
translated the young Indian.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell him yes,&quot; she said, automatically.</p>

<p>There was a pause.  The old Indian spoke again, as if to the air.
One of the men present went out.  There was a silence as if of
eternity, in the dim room that was lighted only through the open
door.</p>

<p>The woman looked round.  Four old men with grey hair sat on the log
by the wall facing the door.  Two other men, powerful and
impassive, stood near the door.  They all had long hair, and wore
white shirts gathered into a loin-cloth.  Their powerful legs were
naked and dark.  There was a silence like eternity.</p>

<p>At length the man returned, with white and dark clothing on his
arm.  The young Indian took them, and holding them in front of the
woman, said:</p>

<p>&quot;You must take off your clothes, and put these on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If all you men will go out,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No one will hurt you,&quot; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Not while you men are here,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He looked at the two men by the door.  They came quickly forward,
and suddenly gripped her arms as she stood, without hurting her,
but with great power.  Then two of the old men came, and with
curious skill slit her boots down with keen knives, and drew them
off, and slit her clothing so that it came away from her.  In a few
moments she stood there white and uncovered.  The old man on the
bed spoke, and they turned her round for him to see.  He spoke
again, and the young Indian deftly took the pins and comb from her
fair hair, so that it fell over her shoulders in a bunchy tangle.</p>

<p>Then the old man spoke again.  The Indian led her to the bedside.
The white-haired, glassy-dark old man moistened his finger-tips at
his mouth, and most delicately touched her on the breasts and on
the body, then on the back.  And she winced strangely each time, as
the fingertips drew along her skin, as if Death itself were
touching her.</p>

<p>And she wondered, almost sadly, why she did not feel shamed in her
nakedness.  She only felt sad and lost.  Because nobody felt
ashamed.  The elder men were all dark and tense with some other
deep, gloomy, incomprehensible emotion, which suspended all her
agitation, while the young Indian had a strange look of ecstasy on
his face.  And she, she was only utterly strange and beyond
herself, as if her body were not her own.</p>

<p>They gave her the new clothing: a long white cotton shift, that
came to her knees: then a tunic of thick blue woollen stuff,
embroidered with scarlet and green flowers.  It was fastened over
one shoulder only, and belted with a braid sash of scarlet and
black wool.</p>

<p>When she was thus dressed, they took her away, barefoot, to a
little house in the stockaded garden.  The young Indian told her
she might have what she wanted.  She asked for water to wash
herself.  He brought it in a jar, together with a long wooden bowl.
Then he fastened the gate-door of her house, and left her a
prisoner.  She could see through the bars of the gate-door of her
house, the red flowers of the garden, and a humming bird.  Then
from the roof of the big house she heard the long, heavy sound of a
drum, unearthly to her in its summons, and an uplifted voice
calling from the house-top in a strange language, with a far-away
emotionless intonation, delivering some speech or message.  And she
listened as if from the dead.</p>

<p>But she was very tired.  She lay down on a couch of skins, pulling
over her the blanket of dark wool, and she slept, giving up
everything.</p>

<p>When she woke it was late afternoon, and the young Indian was
entering with a basket-tray containing food, tortillas and corn-
mush with bits of meat, probably mutton, and a drink made of honey,
and some fresh plums.  He brought her also a long garland of red
and yellow flowers with knots of blue buds at the end.  He
sprinkled the garland with water from a jar, then offered it to
her, with a smile.  He seemed very gentle and thoughtful, and on
his face and in his dark eyes was a curious look of triumph and
ecstasy, that frightened her a little.  The glitter had gone from
the black eyes, with their curving dark lashes, and he would look
at her with this strange soft glow of ecstasy that was not quite
human, and terribly impersonal, and which made her uneasy.</p>

<p>&quot;Is there anything you want?&quot; he said, in his low, slow, melodious
voice, that always seemed withheld, as if he were speaking aside to
somebody else, or as if he did not want to let the sound come out
to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Am I going to be kept a prisoner here?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you can walk in the garden to-morrow,&quot; he said softly.  Always
this curious solicitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you like that drink?&quot; he said, offering her a little
earthenware cup.  &quot;It is very refreshing.&quot;</p>

<p>She sipped the liquor curiously.  It was made with herbs and
sweetened with honey, and had a strange, lingering flavour.  The
young man watched her with gratification.</p>

<p>&quot;It has a peculiar taste,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It is very refreshing,&quot; he replied, his black eyes resting on her
always with that look of gratified ecstasy.  Then he went away.
And presently she began to be sick, and to vomit violently, as if
she had no control over herself.</p>

<p>Afterwards she felt a great soothing languor steal over her, her
limbs felt strong and loose and full of languor, and she lay on her
couch listening to the sounds of the village, watching the
yellowing sky, smelling the scent of burning cedar-wood, or pine-
wood.  So distinctly she heard the yapping of tiny dogs, the
shuffle of far-off feet, the murmur of voices, so keenly she
detected the smell of smoke, and flowers, and evening falling, so
vividly she saw the one bright star infinitely remote, stirring
above the sunset, that she felt as if all her senses were diffused
on the air, that she could distinguish the sound of evening flowers
unfolding, and the actual crystal sound of the heavens, as the vast
belts of the world-atmosphere slid past one another, and as if the
moisture ascending and the moisture descending in the air resounded
like some harp in the cosmos.</p>

<p>She was a prisoner in her house and in the stockaded garden, but
she scarcely minded.  And it was days before she realised that she
never saw another woman.  Only the men, the elderly men of the big
house, that she imagined must be some sort of temple, and the men
priests of some sort.  For they always had the same colours, red,
orange, yellow, and black, and the same grave, abstracted
demeanour.</p>

<p>Sometimes an old man would come and sit in her room with her, in
absolute silence.  None spoke any language but Indian, save the one
younger man.  The older men would smile at her, and sit with her
for an hour at a time, sometimes smiling at her when she spoke in
Spanish, but never answering save with this slow, benevolent-
seeming smile.  And they gave off a feeling of almost fatherly
solicitude.  Yet their dark eyes, brooding over her, had something
away in their depths that was awesomely ferocious and relentless.
They would cover it with a smile, at once, if they felt her
looking.  But she had seen it.</p>

<p>Always they treated her with this curious impersonal solicitude,
this utterly impersonal gentleness, as an old man treats a child.
But underneath it she felt there was something else, something
terrible.  When her old visitor had gone away, in his silent,
insidious, fatherly fashion, a shock of fear would come over her;
though of what she knew not.</p>

<p>The young Indian would sit and talk with her freely, as if with
great candour.  But with him, too, she felt that everything real
was unsaid.  Perhaps it was unspeakable.  His big dark eyes would
rest on her almost cherishingly, touched with ecstasy, and his
beautiful, slow, languorous voice would trail out its simple,
ungrammatical Spanish.  He told her he was the grandson of the old,
old man, son of the man in the spotted sarape: and they were
caciques, kings from the old, old days, before even the Spaniards
came.  But he himself had been in Mexico City, and also in the
United States.  He had worked as a labourer, building the roads in
Los Angeles.  He had travelled as far as Chicago.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you speak English, then?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>His eyes rested on her with a curious look of duplicity and
conflict, and he mutely shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;What did you do with your long hair, when you were in the United
States?&quot; she asked.  &quot;Did you cut it off?&quot;</p>

<p>Again, with the look of torment in his eyes, he shook his head.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he said, in a low, subdued voice, &quot;I wore a hat, and a
handkerchief tied round my head.&quot;</p>

<p>And he relapsed into silence, as if of tormented memories.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you the only man of your people who has been to the United
States?&quot; she asked him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.  I am the only one who has been away from here for a long
time.  The others come back soon, in one week.  They don't stay
away.  The old men don't let them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And why did you go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The old men want me to go - because I shall be the Cacique - &quot;</p>

<p>He talked always with the same na&iuml;vet&eacute;, an almost childish candour.
But she felt that this was perhaps just the effect of his Spanish.
Or perhaps speech altogether was unreal to him.  Anyhow, she felt
that all the real things were kept back.</p>

<p>He came and sat with her a good deal - sometimes more than she
wished - as if he wanted to be near her.  She asked him if he was
married.  He said he was - with two children.</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to see your children,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>But he answered only with that smile, a sweet, almost ecstatic
smile above which the dark eyes hardly changed from their enigmatic
abstraction.</p>

<p>It was curious, he would sit with her by the hour, without even
making her self-conscious, or sex-conscious.  He seemed to have no
sex, as he sat there so still and gentle and apparently submissive,
with his head bent a little forward, and the river of glistening
black hair streaming maidenly over his shoulders.</p>

<p>Yet when she looked again, she saw his shoulders broad and
powerful, his eyebrows black and level, the short, curved,
obstinate black lashes over his lowered eyes, the small, fur-like
line of moustache above his blackish, heavy lips, and the strong
chin, and she knew that in some other mysterious way he was darkly
and powerfully male.  And he, feeling her watching him, would
glance up at her swiftly with a dark, lurking look in his eyes,
which immediately he veiled with that half-sad smile.</p>

<p>The days and the weeks went by, in a vague kind of contentment.
She was uneasy sometimes, feeling she had lost the power over
herself.  She was not in her own power, she was under the spell of
some other control.  And at times she had moments of terror and
horror.  But then these Indians would come and sit with her,
casting their insidious spell over her by their very silent
presence, their silent, sexless, powerful physical presence.  As
they sat they seemed to take her will away, leaving her will-less
and victim to her own indifference.  And the young man would bring
her sweetened drink, often the same emetic drink, but sometimes
other kinds.  And after drinking, the languor filled her heavy
limbs, her senses seemed to float in the air, listening, hearing.
They had brought her a little female dog, which she called Flora.
And once, in the trance of her senses, she felt she HEARD the
little dog conceive, in her tiny womb, and begin to be complex,
with young.  And another day she could hear the vast sound of the
earth going round, like some immense arrow-string booming.</p>

<p>But as the days grew shorter and colder, when she was cold, she
would get a sudden revival of her will, and a desire to go out, to
go away.  And she insisted to the young man, she wanted to go out.</p>

<p>So one day, they let her climb to the topmost roof of the big house
where she was, and look down the square.  It was the day of the big
dance, but not everybody was dancing.  Women with babies in their
arms stood in their doorways, watching.  Opposite, at the other end
of the square, there was a throng before the other big house, and a
small, brilliant group on the terrace-roof of the first storey, in
front of wide open doors of the upper storey.  Through these wide
open doors she could see fire glinting in darkness and priests in
headdresses of black and yellow and scarlet feathers, wearing robe-
like blankets of black and red and yellow, with long green fringes,
were moving about.  A big drum was beating slowly and regularly, in
the dense, Indian silence.  The crowd below waited - </p>

<p>Then a drum started on a high beat, and there came the deep,
powerful burst of men singing a heavy, savage music, like a wind
roaring in some timeless forest, many mature men singing in one
breath, like the wind; and long lines of dancers walked out from
under the big house.  Men with naked, golden-bronze bodies and
streaming black hair, tufts of red and yellow feathers on their
arms, and kilts of white frieze with a bar of heavy red and black
and green embroidery round their waists, bending slightly forward
and stamping the earth in their absorbed, monotonous stamp of the
dance, a fox-fur, hung by the nose from their belt behind, swaying
with the sumptuous swaying of a beautiful fox-fur, the tip of the
tail writhing above the dancer's heels.  And after each man, a
woman with a strange elaborate headdress of feathers and seashells,
and wearing a short black tunic, moving erect, holding up tufts of
feathers in each hand, swaying her wrists rhythmically and subtly
beating the earth with her bare feet.</p>

<p>So, the long line of the dance unfurling from the big house
opposite.  And from the big house beneath her, strange scent of
incense, strange tense silence, then the answering burst of inhuman
male singing, and the long line of the dance unfurling.</p>

<p>It went on all day, the insistence of the drum, the cavernous,
roaring, storm-like sound of male singing, the incessant swinging
of the fox-skins behind the powerful, gold-bronze, stamping legs of
the men, the autumn sun from a perfect blue heaven pouring on the
rivers of black hair, men's and women's, the valley all still, the
walls of rock beyond, the awful huge bulking of the mountain
against the pure sky, its snow seething with sheer whiteness.</p>

<p>For hours and hours she watched, spell-bound, and as if drugged.
And in all the terrible persistence of the drumming and the
primeval, rushing deep singing, and the endless stamping of the
dance of fox-tailed men, the tread of heavy, bird-erect women in
their black tunics, she seemed at last to feel her own death; her
own obliteration.  As if she were to be obliterated from the field
of life again.  In the strange towering symbols on the heads of the
changeless, absorbed women she seemed to read once more the Mene
Mene Tekel Upharsin.  Her kind of womanhood, intensely personal and
individual, was to be obliterated again, and the great primeval
symbols were to tower once more over the fallen individual
independence of woman.  The sharpness and the quivering nervous
consciousness of the highly-bred white woman was to be destroyed
again, womanhood was to be cast once more into the great stream of
impersonal sex and impersonal passion.  Strangely, as if
clairvoyant, she saw the immense sacrifice prepared.  And she went
back to her little house in a trance of agony.</p>

<p>After this, there was always a certain agony when she heard the
drums at evening, and the strange uplifted savage sound of men
singing round the drum, like wild creatures howling to the
invisible gods of the moon and the vanished sun.  Something of the
chuckling, sobbing-cry of the coyote, something of the exultant
bark of the fox, the far-off wild melancholy exultance of the
howling wolf, the torment of the puma's scream, and the insistence
of the ancient fierce human male, with his lapses of tenderness and
his abiding ferocity.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would climb the high roof after nightfall, and listen
to the dim cluster of young men round the drum on the bridge just
beyond the square, singing by the hour.  Sometimes there would be a
fire, and in the fire-glow, men in their white shirts or naked save
for a loin-cloth, would be dancing and stamping like spectres, hour
after hour in the dark cold air, within the fire-glow, forever
dancing and stamping like turkeys, or dropping squatting by the
fire to rest, throwing their blankets round them.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you all have the same colours?&quot; she asked the young Indian.
&quot;Why do you all have red and yellow and black, over your white
shirts?  And the women have black tunics?&quot;</p>

<p>He looked into her eyes, curiously, and the faint, evasive smile
came on to his face.  Behind the smile lay a soft, strange
malignancy.</p>

<p>&quot;Because our men are the fire and the daytime, and our women are
the spaces between the stars at night,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;Aren't the women even stars?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;No.  We say they are the spaces between the stars, that keep the
stars apart.&quot;</p>

<p>He looked at her oddly, and again the touch of derision came into
his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;White people,&quot; he said, &quot;they know nothing.  They are like
children, always with toys.  We know the sun, and we know the moon.
And we say, when a white woman sacrifice herself to our gods, then
our gods will begin to make the world again, and the white man's
gods will fall to pieces.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How sacrifice herself?&quot; she asked quickly.</p>

<p>And he, as quickly covered, covered himself with a subtle smile.</p>

<p>&quot;She sacrifice her own gods and come to our gods, I mean that,&quot; he
said, soothingly.</p>

<p>But she was not reassured.  An icy pang of fear and certainty was
at her heart.</p>

<p>&quot;The sun he is alive at one end of the sky,&quot; he continued, &quot;and the
moon lives at the other end.  And the man all the time have to keep
the sun happy in his side of the sky, and the woman have to keep
the moon quiet at her side of the sky.  All the time she have to
work at this.  And the sun can't ever go into the house of the
moon, and the moon can't ever go into the house of the sun, in the
sky.  So the woman, she asks the moon to come into her cave, inside
her.  And the man, he draws the sun down till he has the power of
the sun.  All the time he do this.  Then when the man gets a woman,
the sun goes into the cave of the moon, and that is how everything
in the world starts.&quot;</p>

<p>She listened, watching him closely, as one enemy watches another
who is speaking with double meaning.</p>

<p>&quot;Then,&quot; she said, &quot;why aren't you Indians masters of the white
men?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because,&quot; he said, &quot;the Indian got weak, and lost his power with
the sun, so the white men stole the sun.  But they can't keep him - 
they don't know how.  They got him, but they don't know what to do
with him, like a boy who catch a big grizzly bear, and can't kill
him, and can't run away from him.  The grizzly bear eats the boy
that catch him, when he want to run away from him.  White men don't
know what they are doing with the sun, and white women don't know
what they do with the moon.  The moon she got angry with white
women, like a puma when someone kills her little ones.  The moon,
she bites white women - here inside,&quot; and he pressed his side.  &quot;The
moon, she is angry in a white woman's cave.  The Indian, can see it - 
And soon,&quot; he added, &quot;the Indian women get the moon back and keep
her quiet in their house.  And the Indian men get the sun, and the
power over all the world.  White men don't know what the sun is.
They never know.&quot;</p>

<p>He subsided into a curious exultant silence.</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; she faltered, &quot;why do you hate us so?  Why do you hate me?&quot;</p>

<p>He looked up suddenly with a light on his face, and a startling
flame of a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;No, we don't hate,&quot; he said softly, looking with a curious glitter
into her face.</p>

<p>&quot;You do,&quot; she said, forlorn and hopeless.</p>

<p>And after a moment's silence, he rose and went away.</p>
