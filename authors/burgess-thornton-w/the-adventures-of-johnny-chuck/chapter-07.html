<p>After old Whitetail the Marshhawk passed Johnny Chuck without
offering to touch him, Johnny began to feel very brave and bold
and important. He strutted and swaggered along as much as his
short legs would let him. He held his head very high. Already
he felt that he had had an adventure and he longed for more. He
forgot the terrible lonesome feeling of a little while before.
He forgot that he had given away the only home he had. He didn't
know just why, but right down deep inside he had a sudden feeling
that he really didn't care a thing about that old home. In fact,
he felt as if he wouldn't care if he never had another home. Yes,
Sir, that is the way that Johnny Chuck felt. Do you know why?
Just because he had just begun to realize how big and strong he
really was.</p>

<p>Now it is a splendid thing to feel big and strong and brave,
a very splendid thing! But it is a bad thing to let that feeling
turn to pride, foolish pride. Of course old Whitetail hadn't really
been afraid of Johnny Chuck. He had simply passed Johnny with
a wink, because there was plenty to eat without the trouble of
fighting, and Whitetail doesn't fight just for the fun of it.</p>

<p>But foolish Johnny Chuck really thought that old Whitetail was
afraid of him. The more he thought about it, the more tickled
he felt and the more puffed up he felt. He began to talk to himself
and to brag. Yes, Sir, Johnny Chuck began to brag:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"I'm not afraid of any one;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They're all afraid of me!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I only have to show my teeth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make them turn and flee!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"Pooh!" said a voice. "Pooh! It would take two like you to make
me run away!"</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck gave a startled jump. There was a strange Chuck
glaring at him from behind a little bunch of grass. He was a big,
gray old Chuck whom Johnny never had seen on the Green Meadows
before, and he didn't look the least bit afraid. No, Sir, he didn't
look the teeniest, weeniest bit afraid! Somehow, Johnny Chuck
didn't feel half so big and strong and brave as he had a few minutes
before. But it wouldn't do to let this stranger know it. Of course
not! So, though he felt very small inside, Johnny made all his
hair bristle up and tried to look very fierce.</p>

<p>"Who are you and what are you doing on my Green Meadows?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Your Green Meadows! Your Green Meadows! Ho, ho, ho! Your Green
Meadows!" The stranger laughed an unpleasant laugh. "How long
since you owned the Green Meadows? I have just come down on to
them from the Old Pasture, and I like the looks of them so well
that I think I will stay. So run along, little boaster! There
isn't room for both of us here, and the sooner you trot along
the better." The stranger suddenly showed all his teeth and gritted
them unpleasantly.</p>

<p>Now when Johnny Chuck heard this, great anger filled his heart.
A stranger had ordered him to leave the Green Meadows where he
had been born and always lived! He could hardly believe his own
ears. He, Johnny Chuck, would show this stranger who was master
here!</p>

<p>With a squeal of rage, Johnny sprang at the gray old Chuck. Then
began such a fight as the Merry Little Breezes of Old Mother West
Wind had never seen before. They danced around excitedly and cried:
"How dreadful!" and hoped that Johnny Chuck would win, for you
know they loved him very much.</p>

<p>Over and over the two little fighters rolled, biting and scratching
and tearing and growling and snarling. Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun
hid his face behind a cloud, so as not to see such a dreadful
sight. The stranger had been in many fights and he was very crafty.
For a while Johnny felt that he was getting the worst of it, and
he began to wonder if he really would have to leave the Green
Meadows. The very thought filled him with new rage and he fought
harder than ever.</p>

<p>Now the stranger was old and his teeth were worn, while Johnny
was young and his teeth were very sharp. After a long, long time,
Johnny felt the stranger growing weaker. Johnny fought harder
than ever. At last the stranger cried "Enough!" and when he could
break away, started back towards the Old Pasture. Johnny Chuck
had won!</p>
