<P>
Absorbed in the effort to overcome his patient's reserve, the
doctor had forgotten Emily's letter. He opened it immediately.
<P>
After reading the first sentence, he looked up with an expression
of annoyance. "She has begun the examination of the papers
already," he said.
<P>
"Then I can be of no further use to you," Miss Jethro rejoined.
She made a second attempt to leave the room.
<P>
Doctor Allday turned to the next page of the letter. "Stop!" he
cried. "She has found something--and here it is."
<P>
He held up a small printed Handbill, which had been placed
between the first and second pages. "Suppose you look at it?" he
said.
<P>
"Whether I am interested in it or not?" Miss Jethro asked.
<P>
"You may be interested in what Miss Emily says about it in her
letter."
<P>
"Do you propose to show me her letter?"
<P>
"I propose to read it to you."
<P>
Miss Jethro took the Handbill without further objection. It was
expressed in these words:
<P>
"MURDER. 100 POUNDS REWARD.--Whereas a murder was committed on
the thirtieth September, 1877, at the Hand-in-Hand Inn, in the
village of Zeeland, Hampshire, the above reward will be paid to
any person or persons whose exertions shall lead to the arrest
and conviction of the suspected murderer. Name not known.
Supposed age, between twenty and thirty years. A well-made man,
of small stature. Fair complexion, delicate features, clear blue
eye s. Hair light, and cut rather short. Clean shaven, with the
exception of narrow half-whiskers. Small, white, well-shaped
hands. Wore valuable rings on the two last fingers of the left
hand. Dressed neatly in a dark-gray tourist-suit. Carried a
knapsack, as if on a pedestrian excursion. Remarkably good voice,
smooth, full, and persuasive. Ingratiating manners. Apply to the
Chief Inspector, Metropolitan Police Office, London."
<P>
Miss Jethro laid aside the Handbill without any visible
appearance of agitation. The doctor took up Emily's letter, and
read as follows:
<P>
"You will be as much relieved as I was, my kind friend, when you
look at the paper inclosed. I found it loose in a blank book,
with cuttings from newspapers, and odd announcements of lost
property and other curious things (all huddled together between
the leaves), which my aunt no doubt intended to set in order and
fix in their proper places. She must have been thinking of her
book, poor soul, in her last illness. Here is the origin of those
'terrible words' which frightened stupid Mrs. Mosey! Is it not
encouraging to have discovered such a confirmation of my opinion
as this? I feel a new interest in looking over the papers that
still remain to be examined--"
<P>
Before he could get to the end of the sentence Miss Jethro's
agitation broke through her reserve.
<P>
"Do what you proposed to do!" she burst out vehemently. "Stop her
at once from carrying her examination any further! If she
hesitates, insist on it!"
<P>
At last Doctor Allday had triumphed! "It has been a long time
coming," he remarked, in his cool way; "and it's all the more
welcome on that account. You dread the discoveries she may make,
Miss Jethro, as I do. And _you_ know what those discoveries may
be."
<P>
"What I do know, or don't know, is of no importance." she
answered sharply.
<P>
"Excuse me, it is of very serious importance. I have no authority
over this poor girl--I am not even an old friend. You tell me to
insist. Help me to declare honestly that I know of circumstances
which justify me; and I may insist to some purpose."
<P>
Miss Jethro lifted her veil for the first time, and eyed him
searchingly.
<P>
"I believe I can trust you," she said. "Now listen! The one
consideration on which I consent to open my lips, is
consideration for Miss Emily's tranquillity. Promise me absolute
secrecy, on your word of honor."
<P>
He gave the promise.
<P>
"I want to know one thing, first," Miss Jethro proceeded. "Did
she tell you--as she once told me--that her father had died of
heart-complaint?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Did you put any questions to her?"
<P>
"I asked how long ago it was."
<P>
"And she told you?"
<P>
"She told me."
<P>
"You wish to know, Doctor Allday, what discoveries Miss Emily may
yet make, among her aunt's papers. Judge for yourself, when I
tell you that she has been deceived about her father's death."
<P>
"Do you mean that he is still living?"
<P>
"I mean that she has been deceived--purposely deceived--about the
_manner_ of his death."
<P>
"Who was the wretch who did it?"
<P>
"You are wronging the dead, sir! The truth can only have been
concealed out of the purest motives of love and pity. I don't
desire to disguise the conclusion at which I have arrived after
what I have heard from yourself. The person responsible must be
Miss Emily's aunt--and the old servant must have been in her
confidence. Remember! You are bound in honor not to repeat to any
living creature what I have just said."
<P>
The doctor followed Miss Jethro to the door. "You have not yet
told me," he said, "_how_ her father died."
<P>
"I have no more to tell you."
<P>
With those words she left him.
<P>
He rang for his servant. To wait until the hour at which he was
accustomed to go out, might be to leave Emily's peace of mind at
the mercy of an accident. "I am going to the cottage," he said.
"If anybody wants me, I shall be back in a quarter of an hour."
<P>
On the point of leaving the house, he remembered that Emily would
probably expect him to return the Handbill. As he took it up, the
first lines caught his eye: he read the date at which the murder
had been committed, for the second time. On a sudden the ruddy
color left his face.
<P>
"Good God!" he cried, "her father was murdered--and that woman
was concerned in it."
<P>
Following the impulse that urged him, he secured the Handbill in
his pocketbook--snatched up the card which his patient had
presented as her introduction--and instantly left the house. He
called the first cab that passed him, and drove to Miss Jethro's
lodgings.
<P>
"Gone"--was the servant's answer when he inquired for her. He
insisted on speaking to the landlady. "Hardly ten minutes have
passed," he said, "since she left my house."
<P>
"Hardly ten minutes have passed," the landlady replied, "since
that message was brought here by a boy."
<P>
The message had been evidently written in great haste: "I am
unexpectedly obliged to leave London. A bank note is inclosed in
payment of my debt to you. I will send for my luggage."
<P>
The doctor withdrew.
<P>
"Unexpectedly obliged to leave London," he repeated, as he got
into the cab again. "Her flight condemns her: not a doubt of it
now. As fast as you can!" he shouted to the man; directing him to
drive to Emily's cottage.
