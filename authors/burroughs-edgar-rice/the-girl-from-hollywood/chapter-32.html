<p>After Custer left her, Shannon entered the bungalow and sat for a long
time before the table on which stood a framed photograph of her mother.
Never before had she felt the need of loving counsel so sorely as now.
In almost any other emergency she could have gone to Mrs. Pennington,
but in this she dared not. She knew the pride of the Penningtons. She
realized the high altar upon which they placed the purity of their
women in the sacred temple of their love, and she knew that none but
the pure might enter.
</p>
<p>In her heart of hearts she knew that she had the right to stand there
beside his mother or his sister; but the pity of it was that she
could never prove that right, for who would believe her? Men had been
hanged upon circumstantial evidence less damning than that which might
be arrayed against her purity. No--if ever they should learn of her
association with Wilson Crumb, they would cast her out of their lives
as they would put a leper out of their home.
</p><p>Not even Custer’s love could survive such a blow to his honor and his
pride. She did not think the less of him because of that, for she was
wise enough in the ways of the world to know that pride and virtue are
oftentimes uncompromising, even to narrowness.
</p><p>Her only hope, therefore, lay in avoiding discovery by Wilson Crumb
during his stay at Ganado. Her love, and the weakness it had induced,
permitted her to accept the happiness from which an unkind fate had
hitherto debarred her, and to which even now her honor told her she had
no right.
</p><p>She wished that Custer had not loved her, and that she might have
continued to live the life that she had learned to love, where
she might be near him, and might constantly see him in the happy
consociation of friendship; but with his arms about her and his kisses
on her lips she had not had the strength to deny him, or to dissimulate
the great love which had ordered her very existence for many months.
</p><p>In the brief moments of bliss that had followed the avowal of his love,
she had permitted herself to drift without thought of the future; but
now that the sudden knowledge of the approaching arrival of Crumb had
startled her into recollection of the past and consideration of its
bearings upon the future, she realized only too poignantly that the
demands of honor required that sooner or later she herself must tell
Custer the whole sordid story of those hideous months in Hollywood.
There was no other way. She could not mate with a man unless she could
match her honor with his. There was no alternative other than to go
away forever.
</p><p>It was midnight before she arose and went to her room. She went
deliberately to a drawer which she kept locked, and, finding the key,
she opened it. From it she took the little black case, and, turning
back the cover, she revealed the phials, the needles, and the tiny
syringe that had played so sinister a part in her past.
</p><p>What she was doing to-night she had done so often in the past year that
it had almost assumed the proportions of a rite. It had been her wont
to parade her tempters before her, that she might have the satisfaction
of deriding them, and of proving the strength of the new will that her
love for Custer Pennington had been so potent a factor in developing.
To-night she went a little further. She took a bit of cotton, and,
placing it in the bowl of a spoon, she dissolved some of the white
powder with the aid of a lighted match held beneath the spoon, and then
she drew the liquid into the syringe.
</p><p>Her nerves were overwrought and unstrung from the stress of the
conflicting emotions they had endured that evening and the risk she
took was greater than she guessed. And yet, as she looked at the
syringe, and realized that its contents held surcease of sorrow, that
it held quiet and rest and peace, she felt only repugnance toward it.
Not even remotely did she consider the possibility of resorting again
to the false happiness of morphine.
</p><p>She knew now that she was freer from its temptations than one who had
never used it; but she felt that after to-night, with the avowal of
Pennington’s love still in her ears, she must no longer keep in her
possession a thing so diametrically opposed to the cleanliness of his
life and his character. For months she had retained it as a part of the
system she had conceived for ridding herself of its power. Without it
she might never have known whether she could withstand the temptation
of its presence; but now she had finished with it. She needed it no
longer.
</p><p>With almost fanatical savagery she destroyed it, crushing the glass
phials and the syringe beneath her heel and tearing the little case
to shreds. Then, gathering up the fragments, she carried them to the
fireplace in the living room and burned them.
</p><hr/>
<p>On the following day the horses and several loads of properties from
the K. K. S. studio arrived at Ganado, and the men who accompanied
them pitched their camp well up in Jackknife Cañon. Eva was very much
excited, and spent much of her time on horseback, watching their
preparations. She tried to get Shannon to accompany her, but the latter
found various excuses to remain away, being fearful that even though
Crumb had not yet arrived, there might be other employees of the studio
who would recognize her.
</p><p>Crumb and the rest of the company came in the afternoon, although
they had not been expected until the following day. Eva, who had
made Custer ride up again with her in the afternoon, recalled to the
actor-director the occasion upon which she had met him, and they had
danced together, some year and a half before.
</p><p>As soon as he met her, Crumb was struck by her beauty, youth, and
freshness. He saw in her a possible means of relieving the tedium of
his several weeks’ enforced absence from Hollywood--though in the big
brother he realized a possible obstacle, unless he were able to carry
on his purposed gallantries clandestinely.
</p><p>In the course of conversation he took occasion to remark that Eva
ought to photograph well. “I’ll let them take a hundred feet of you,”
he said, “some day when you’re up here while we’re working. We might
discover an unsung Pickford up here among the hills!”
</p><p>“She will remain unsung, then,” said Custer curtly. “My sister has no
desire to go into pictures.”
</p><p>“How do you know I haven’t?” asked Eva.
</p><p>“After Grace?” he asked significantly.
</p><p>She turned to Crumb.
</p><p>“I’m afraid I wouldn’t make much of an actress,” she said; “but it
would be perfectly radiant to see myself in pictures just once!”
</p><p>“Good!” he replied. “We’ll get you all right some day that you’re up
here. I promise your brother that I won’t try to persuade you into
pictures.”
</p><p>“I hope not,” said Custer.
</p><p>As he and Eva rode back toward the house, he turned to the girl.
</p><p>“I don’t like that fellow Crumb,” he said.
</p><p>“Why?” she asked.
</p><p>“It’s hard to say. He just rubs me the wrong way; but I’d bet almost
anything that he’s a cad.”
</p><p>“Oh, I think he’s perfectly divine!” said Eva with her usual enthusiasm.
</p><p>Custer grunted.
</p><p>“The trouble with you,” announced Eva, “is that you’re jealous of him
because he’s an actor. That’s just like you men!”
</p><p>Custer laughed.
</p><p>“Maybe you’re right,” he said; “but I don’t like him, and I hope you’ll
never go up there alone.”
</p><p>“Well, I’m going to see them take pictures,” replied the girl; “and if
I can’t get any one to go with me, I’m going alone.”
</p><p>“I don’t like the way he looked at you, Eva.”
</p><p>“You’re perfectly silly! He didn’t look at me any differently than any
other man does.”
</p><p>“I don’t know about that. I haven’t the same keen desire to punch the
head of every man I see looking at you as I had in his case.”
</p><p>“Oh, you’re prejudiced! I’ll bet anything he’s just perfectly lovely!”
</p><p>Next morning, finding no one with the leisure or inclination to ride
with her, Eva rode up again to the camp. They had already commenced
shooting. Although Crumb was busy, he courteously took the time to
explain the scene on which they were working, and many of the technical
details of picture making. He had a man hold her horse while she came
and squinted through the finder. In fact, he spent so much time with
her that he materially delayed the work of the morning. At the same
time the infatuation that had had its birth on the preceding day grew
to greater proportions in his diseased mind.
</p><p>He asked her to stay and lunch with them. When she insisted that
she must return home, he begged her to come again in the afternoon.
Although she would have been glad to do so, for she found the work that
they were doing novel and interesting, she declined his invitation, as
she already had made arrangements for the afternoon.
</p><p>He followed her to her horse, and walked beside her down the road a
short distance from the others.
</p><p>“If you can’t come down this afternoon,” he said, “possibly you can
come up this evening. We are going to take some night pictures. I
hadn’t intended inviting any one, because the work is going to be
rather difficult and dangerous, and an audience might distract the
attention of the actors; but if you think you could get away alone, I
should be very glad to have you come up for a few minutes about nine
o’clock. We shall be working in the same place. Don’t forget,” he
repeated, as she started to ride away, “that for this particular scene
I really ought not to have any audience at all; so if you come, please
don’t tell any one else about it.”
</p><p>“I’ll come,” she said. “It’s awfully good of you to ask me, and I won’t
tell a soul.”
</p><p>Crumb smiled as he turned back to his waiting company.
</p><p>Brought up in the atmosphere that had surrounded her since birth,
unacquainted with any but honorable men, and believing as she did that
all men are the chivalrous protectors of all women, Eva did not suspect
the guile that lay behind the director’s courteous manner and fair
words. She looked upon the coming nocturnal visit to the scene of their
work as nothing more than a harmless adventure; nor was there, from her
experience, any cause for apprehension, since the company comprised
some forty or fifty men and women who, like any one else, would protect
her from any harm that lay in their power to avert.
</p><p>Her conscience did not trouble her in the least, although she
regretted that she could not share her good fortune with the other
members of her family, and deplored the necessity of leaving the house
surreptitiously, like a thief in the night. Such things did not appeal
to Pennington standards; but Eva satisfied these qualms by promising
herself that she would tell them all about it at breakfast the next
morning.
</p><p>After lunch that day Custer went to his room, and, throwing himself on
his bed with a book, with the intention of reading for half an hour,
fell asleep.
</p><p>Shortly afterward Shannon Burke, feeling that there would be no danger
of meeting any of the K. K. S. people at the Pennington house, rode up
on the Senator to keep her appointment with Eva. As she tied her horse
upon the north side of the house, Wilson Crumb stopped his car opposite
the patio at the south drive. He had come up to see Colonel Pennington
for the purpose of arranging for the use of a number of the Ganado
Herefords in a scene on the following day.
</p><p>Not finding Eva in the family sitting room, Shannon passed through the
house and out into the patio, just as Wilson Crumb mounted the two
steps to the arcade. Before either realized the presence of the other
they were face to face, scarce a yard apart.
</p><p>Shannon went deathly white as she recognized the man beneath his
make-up, while Crumb stood speechless for a moment.
</p><p>“My God, Gaza. You!” he presently managed to exclaim. “What are you
doing here? Thank God I have found you at last!”
</p><p>“Don’t!” she begged. “Please don’t speak to me. I am living a decent
life here.”
</p><p>He laughed in a disagreeable manner.
</p><p>“Decent!” he scoffed. “Where you getting the snow? Who’s putting up for
it?”
</p><p>“I don’t use it any more,” she said.
</p><p>“The hell you don’t! You can’t put that over on me! Some other guy is
furnishing it. I know you--you can’t get along two hours without it.
I’m not going to stand for this. There isn’t any guy going to steal my
girl!”
</p><p>“Hush, Wilson!” she cautioned. “For God’s sake keep still! Some one
might hear you.”
</p><p>“I don’t give a damn who hears me. I’m here to tell the world that no
one is going to take my girl away from me. I’ve found you, and you’re
going back with me, do you understand?”
</p><p>She came very close to him, her eyes blazing wrathfully.
</p><p>“I’m not going back with you, Wilson Crumb,” she said. “If you tell, or
if you ever threaten me again in any way, I’ll kill you. I managed to
escape you, and I have found happiness at last, and no one shall take
it away from me!”
</p><p>“What about my happiness? You lived with me two years. I love you, and,
by God, I’m going to have you, if I have to----”
</p><p>A door slammed behind them, and they both turned to see Custer
Pennington standing in the arcade outside his door, looking at them.
</p><p>“I beg your pardon,” he said, his voice chilling. “Did I interrupt?”
</p><p>“This man is looking for some one, Custer,” said Shannon, and turned to
reënter the house.
</p><p>Confronted by a man, Crumb’s bravado had vanished. Intuitively he
guessed that he was looking at the man who had stolen Gaza from him;
but he was a very big young man, with broad shoulders and muscles that
his flannel shirt and riding breeches did not conceal. Crumb decided
that if he was going to have trouble with this man, it would be safer
to commence hostilities at a time when the other was not looking.
</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “I was looking for your father, Mr. Pennington.”
</p><p>“Father is not here. He has driven over to the village. What do you
want?”
</p><p>“I wanted to see if I could arrange for the use of some of your
Herefords to-morrow morning.”
</p><p>Pennington was leading the way toward Crumb’s car.
</p><p>“You can find out about that,” he said, “or anything else that you may
wish to know, from the assistant foreman, whom you will usually find up
at the other end, around the cabin. If he is in doubt about anything,
he will consult with us personally; so that it will not be necessary,
Mr. Crumb, for you to go to the trouble of coming to the house again.”
</p><p>Custer’s voice was level and low. It carried no suggestion of anger,
yet there was that about it which convinced Crumb that he was fortunate
in not having been kicked off the hill physically rather than
verbally--for kicked off he had been, and advised to stay off, into
the bargain.
</p><p>He wondered how much Pennington had overheard of his conversation with
Gaza. Shannon Burke, crouching in a big chair in the sitting room, was
wondering the same thing.
</p><p>As a matter of fact, Custer had overheard practically all of the
conversation. The noise of Crumb’s car had awakened him, but almost
immediately he had fallen into a doze, through which the spoken
words impinged upon his consciousness without any actual, immediate
realization of their meaning, of the identity of the speakers. The
moment that he became fully awake, and found that he was listening to a
conversation not intended for his ears, he had risen and gone into the
patio.
</p><p>When finally he came into the sitting room, where Shannon was, he made
no mention of the occurrence, except to say that the visitor had wanted
to see his father. It did not seem possible to Shannon that he could
have failed to overhear at least a part of their conversation, for they
were standing not more than a couple of yards from the open window of
his bedroom, and there was no other sound breaking the stillness of
the August noon. She was sure that he had heard, and yet his manner
indicated that he had not.
</p><p>She waited a moment to see if he would be the first to broach the
subject, but he did not. She determined to tell him then and there all
that she had to tell, freeing her soul and her conscience of their
burden, whatever the cost might be.
</p><p>She rose and came to where he was standing, and, placing a hand upon
his arm, looked up into his eyes.
</p><p>“Custer,” she said. “I have something to tell you. I ought to have
told you before, but I have been afraid. Since last night there is no
alternative but to tell you.”
</p><p>“You do not have to tell me anything that you do not want to tell me,”
he said. “My confidence in you is implicit. I could not both love and
distrust at the same time.”
</p><p>“I must tell you,” she said. “I only hope----”
</p><p>“Where in the world have you been, Shannon?” cried Eva, breaking
suddenly into the sitting room. “I have been away down to your place
looking for you. I thought you were going to play golf with me this
afternoon.”
</p><p>“That’s what I came up for,” said Shannon, turning toward her.
</p><p>“Well, come on, then! We’ll have to hurry, if we’re going to play
eighteen holes this afternoon.”
</p><p>Custer Pennington went to his room again after the girls had driven off
in the direction of the Country Club. He wondered what it had been that
Shannon wished to tell him. Round and round in his mind rang the words
of Wilson Crumb:
</p><p>“You lived with me two years--you lived with me two years--you lived
with me two years!”
</p><p>She had been going to explain that, he was sure; but she did not have
to explain it. The girl that he loved could have done no wrong. He
trusted her. He was sure of her.
</p><p>But what place had that soft-faced cad had in her life? It was
unthinkable that she had ever known him, much less that they had been
upon intimate terms.
</p><p>Custer went to his closet and rummaged around for a bottle. It had
been more than two weeks since he had taken a drink. The return to his
old intimacy with Shannon, and the frequency with which he now saw her
had again weaned him from his habit; but to-day he felt the need of a
drink--of a big drink, stiff and neat.
</p><p>He swallowed the raw liquor as if it had been so much water. He wished
now that he had punched Crumb’s head when he had had the chance. The
cur! He had spoken to Shannon as if she were a common woman of the
streets--Shannon Burke--Custer’s Shannon!
</p><p>Feeling no reaction to the first drink, he took another.
</p><p>“I’d like to get my fingers on his throat!” he thought. “Before I
choked the life out of him, I’d drag him up here and make him kiss the
ground at her feet!”
</p><p>But no, he could not do that. Others would see it, and there would
have to be explanations; and how could he explain it without casting
reflections on Shannon?
</p><p>For hours he sat there in his room, nursing his anger, his jealousy,
and his grief; and all the time he drank and drank again. He went to
his closet, got his belt and holster, and from his dresser drawer took
a big, ugly-looking forty-five--a Colt’s automatic. For a moment he
stood holding it in his hand, looking at it. Almost caressingly he
handled it, and then he slipped it into the holster at his hip, put on
his hat, and started for the door.
