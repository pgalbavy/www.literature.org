<p>Words cannot picture the amazement and delight of the little
company in the cavern, when their strange visitor, who descended
so suddenly upon them, was recognized as Fred Godfrey.</p>

<p>Mr. Brainerd, when the fortunate shot was fired some time before,
felt just the faintest suspicion that it might be his son; but
he said nothing to the others, through fear of exciting hopes
that could only be disappointed.</p>

<p>Maggie, herself, thought of Fred, and prayed that it might be
he; but she, too, held her peace&mdash;and now here, was her daring
brother among them.</p>

<p>It required but a few minutes, after greeting his relatives,
to tell of his extraordinary escape from Queen Esther, and his
prolonged hunt for his friends. From what passed between him and
Mr. Brainerd while making their way up the western shore, he suspected
that when he should join his family, some such manner of flight
would be adopted.</p>

<p>He knew of this romantic place in the rocks, but it never occurred
to him until after he had wasted considerable time in hunting
for traces of them.</p>

<p>He had visited the spot more than once in his hunting excursions
through the Wyoming Valley, and it did not take him long to learn
the condition of affairs.</p>

<p>He conducted this delicate business with such skill that his
presence was never suspected by his enemies, and he did his utmost
to keep it concealed. He ventured on one or two signals, with
a view of apprising Mr. Brainerd of his proximity, but, if that
gentleman heard him, he suspected the calls were made by the Indians,
and therefore paid no attention to them.</p>

<p>Understanding the peril which threatened his friends, Fred extended
himself on the rocks above the cavern, and held the gun that he
had taken from the dead body of a soldier, pointed toward the
spot.</p>

<p>Just before he was ready, Mr. Brainerd shot the warrior, and
then Fred leveled his piece for the next one. Thus it was that,
instead of one rifle, there were two aimed at the second savage,
and when the first flashed in the pan, the other completed the
business.</p>

<p>This was providential, but Fred was wise enough to see that nothing
like permanent safety could be gained by that kind of defense.</p>

<p>He ventured on another reconnoissance, and it was while he was
thus engaged that Gravity Gimp emerged from the cavern, and walked
straight into the trap set for him.</p>

<p>"How was it you managed to get down here?" asked Mr. Brainerd.</p>

<p>"I used a grape-vine," replied Fred; "it took me a considerable
while to arrange it, and I came near slipping my hold and dropping
to the bottom of the ravine, as it was."</p>

<p>"Was it a wise proceeding?" continued the father.</p>

<p>"I hope so."</p>

<p>"Why did you not come down the regular path?" inquired Maggie;
"Gravity seemed to have no difficulty in going away by it."</p>

<p>"There must be at least half a dozen Indians up there; they could
have captured him without trouble, but they allowed him to get
so far away that they calculated you would not suspect the danger,
and might try to follow him, in which case every one of you would
be in their hands this minute."</p>

<p>This information was startling, and the listeners were silent.
Fred added:</p>

<p>"You can understand how great the risk was which I ran, and it
is hard to explain why they didn't discover what I was doing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they did."</p>

<p>"They would have fired on me had they known it; but there is
so much deep shadow above, and they were so unsuspicious of any
such proceeding, that I succeeded."</p>

<p>"It was a daring act, indeed, but what is to be the issue?"</p>

<p>"I saw that it would not do for you to remain until morning.
If to-morrow's sun finds you here, you are doomed. You have no
means of obtaining any food or water, and they can converge a
dozen rifles on you, for they will gain the position from which
we kept them a while ago."</p>

<p>"They have already done so," said Mr. Brainerd. "I saw, and was
unable to prevent them."</p>

<p>"That settles the matter, then; we must get out of this place
within the next two hours, and be well on our way toward the Delaware
by daylight. We can't venture up the path, and, therefore&mdash;hello!
What's that?"</p>

<p>In taking a backward step at that moment, Fred placed his foot
directly on the stomach of Habakkuk McEwen, who lay flat on his
back, sound asleep.</p>

<p>The New Englander emitted a groan, and sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed before everything was understood.</p>

<p>Fred apologized, and shook hands with him, as well as he could
in the gloom, and Habakkuk then became a listener to the all-important
conference that followed.</p>

<p>Fred, in making his reconnoissance, had discovered that Jake
Golcher was the leader of the Indians.</p>

<p>The coolness with which Fred Godfrey discussed the situation
had the effect of inspiring his friends with something of his
courage.</p>

<p>He stood erect while talking, and Maggie leaned on one arm, while
Eva, fully awake now, clung to the other side. Even Aunt Peggy
relaxed from her usual reserve, and only expressed displeasure
when the young man said that he saw Golcher and failed to shoot
the "scand'lous villain."</p>

<p>Habakkuk possessed sense enough to take no part in the conference,
feeling that he had forfeited all consideration in such a matter.</p>

<p>"The moon is working around in the sky," said Mr. Brainerd, "so
that I am afraid we shall not have the shadow until morning."</p>

<p>"Consequently we must not wait; nothing is to be expected from
Gimp, and we may as well venture at once."</p>

<p>There could be no disputing this decision, and all waited for
Fred to make known his plan.</p>

<p>It was very simple, though of course attended with peril: he
proposed that the grape-vine which had served him so well should
now be used to assist each to the bottom of the ravine, where,
in the deep shadow that prevailed, they would do their utmost
to steal out into the open wood, and so pass over the mountain.</p>

<p>It seemed impossible to do this without detection from the Indians,
who were besieging the fugitives, but desperate as was the risk,
no one hesitated. In fact, Habakkuk McEwen proposed that he should
go first.</p>

<p>"I can look around and see whether everything is all right; and
if it isn't, I'll let you know, and you needn't come."</p>

<p>"Instead of being the first, you'll be the last," said Mr. Brainerd,
curtly.</p>

<p>Habakkuk thought it not worth while to argue the matter, and
he replied not to the severe stricture of the elder.</p>

<p>Fred Godfrey now ventured to the mouth of the cavern, where the
vine was still dangling, the lower end being invisible in the
darkness below.</p>

<p>From the platform in front of the cavern to the bottom of the
ravine was something like twenty feet&mdash;not a very great distance,
but too great for any one to let himself drop to the flinty floor
below.</p>

<p>"The end of the support reaches half-way," said Fred, "and each
must fall the remaining distance. If we are all careful, no harm
will be done."</p>

<p>"Is it securely fastened above?"</p>

<p>"It would not have sustained me were it not. There is one thing
that must be borne in mind," added Fred, speaking to all, "and
that is, that no matter what happens, no noise must be made. The
least exclamation will be heard by the Indians, some of whom are
probably still at the upper end of the path, and if they suspect
what is going on, failure is certain."</p>

<p>All were so desirous of leaving the place without delay that
the directions of Fred seemed almost superfluous.</p>

<p>When the young man was about to lower himself by the vine, Brainerd
touched his arm and said:</p>

<p>"My recollection of that ravine below is that there is no way
out of it; why not, therefore, climb upward instead of going down?"</p>

<p>"It won't do; the only ones in this party beside myself who could
reach the top in that fashion are Maggie and Eva. With your age,
you couldn't draw yourself half-way up, even with help."</p>

<p>As silently as a shadow, the young patriot drew in the crooked
vine which still dangled in front of the opening, and, flinging
his gun back of his shoulder, where it was held in place, he grasped
the support. The next minute those standing in the gloom behind
him observed the dark figure, with legs drawn up, slowly descending,
as if he were going down a well.</p>
