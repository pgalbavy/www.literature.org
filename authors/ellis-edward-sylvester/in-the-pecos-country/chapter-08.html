<p>The afternoon dragged slowly by with Fred crouching, as he was,
in the top of the tree and waiting for the time to come when he
might descend and make the attempt to rejoin his friends, who
could not but be greatly concerned over his absence. At rare intervals,
the spiteful crack of a rifle reached his ear as before, and he
knew that the white and red men were watching each other, both
ready to seize the first opportunity that might offer for obtaining
the slightest advantage. The occasional clamping of the hoofs
of a galloping horse showed, too, that his dreaded foes were close
at hand.</p>

<p>Finally, the sun disappeared, and darkness slowly settled over
wood, forest, and prairie. There was the moon, shining as bright
and unclouded as on the night before; but the shadow was so dense
among the trees that this was of no particular importance, and
so soon as night was fairly come the impatient lad was resolved
upon making the attempt to reach his friends.</p>

<p>No Apaches had been seen beneath the tree since the departure
of the first stealthy visitor, and the hope was quite strong within
the lad that in the hurry and swirl of the fight the red-skins
had failed to note him in his hiding-place. If such were really
the case, it would seem that there was a chance of his passing
through the lines without detection.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I am going to try it," he muttered, with set teeth,
as he resumed his cautious descent of the tree.</p>

<p>A moment later he found himself upon the nethermost limb, where
he hesitated a few seconds, peering around in the breathless darkness
and listening for anything that might betray the location of his
enemies. The silence of the tomb seemed to have settled upon the
earth, and, hanging by his hands a moment, he let go and dropped
lightly to the ground. As he did so, he purposely sank upon his
hands and knees, in the belief that he was less liable to be seen
in that position than in any other.</p>

<p>The signs continued favorable, and, without any useless waiting,
he turned his face in the direction of New Boston and began stealing
forward, with the care and caution of a veteran courser of the
plains. There was a fluttering hope that, with the coming of night,
the red-skins had departed, but he knew better than to rely upon
any such chance to reach his friends. If they had really gone,
he would have heard something from Sut Simpson.</p>

<p>No more trying ordeal can be imagined than that which Fred endured
when he attempted thus to steal his way through the Apache lines
to his friends. He crept along upon his hands and knees, for he
dared not trust himself in an upright posture, and he studiously
avoided all those places through which the rays of the moonlight
made their way. There was scarcely a minute in which he did not
fancy that he heard the stealthy movement of some one near him,
and stopped and lay flat upon his face, remaining thus until hopeful
that it was safe to move forward again. And this apprehension
was not always imaginary. Two separate times the sound of footsteps
were too distinct to be mistaken, and the glimpse obtained of
a shadowy figure, as it flitted across a partially moonlit space,
was equally conclusive.</p>

<p>Almost an hour had passed, when Fred finally found himself on
the edge of the open area which separated the wood from the settlement.
Thus far he had evaded all danger and only a comparatively small
space remained to be passed over in order to reach the haven of
safety.</p>

<p>The boy assumed an upright position, and, standing in the shadow
of the wood, debated with himself as to the best means of getting
over that narrow but dangerous neck of territory which still interposed.
It would be useless to attempt to creep over it, for the moon
would be sure to reveal him to the Indians that were lurking near,
and it was not likely that he could advance a dozen yards without
detection. If it were possible, by drawing himself along on his
face, to elude the vigilance of the Apaches, it would be clearly
impossible to escape being discerned by his own friends. At such
a time, the entire company would be on the look-out for just such
insidious advances, and the chances were that he would be taken
for a savage and shot by his own friends.</p>

<p>Fred was compelled to do a good deal of thinking, and the conclusion
he came to was the next best possible to reach. Clearly, the wiser
course was for him to remain where he was for the time being.
So long as darkness remained, it was comparatively easy for him
to keep concealed, and, while the situation could not have grown
any worse, with the passage of the night, the chances were that
it would improve, as the way for a safe run across the exposed
area would have shown itself in due time. But it was natural that
the boy should become impatient, and he easily persuaded himself
that his position became more critical each moment.</p>

<p>He decided to make a run straight for the larger building, depending
not upon concealment but upon speed. He expected to be fired at,
and probably chased by some of the Apaches, but there was a reasonable
chance of his escaping both. The distance was short, and he was
sure to gain a good start at the beginning; but his main reliance
was upon his being recognized by his friends, who would cover
his flight. Having decided upon this course, he did not delay
its execution a moment, since delay foreboded so much.</p>

<p>Breathing a prayer to heaven to guide him safely, he drew in
a deep breath, and, leaping full into the moonlit space, started
through his fiery gauntlet.</p>

<p>For a second or two the tomb-like silence continued, and then
he heard several hoarse, crow-like calls, which he knew were made
by the Apaches. Then came several rifle reports, but he was not
injured. It showed, however, that his flight had been discovered.
Fred had nothing to do, however, but to run, and he put on the
utmost speed to which he could force himself, straining every
nerve in the hope of making the log-house, which seemed to recede
as he advanced.</p>

<p>Silence succeeded the shots and shouts, and the heart of the
young fugitive was throbbing with a wild hope, when a noise caused
him to look over his shoulder. To his horror, he perceived an
Indian runner on foot, and within a dozen feet, bearing down upon
him with the speed of the wind. The poor lad felt as if weighed
down by a horrible nightmare, but he bent to his work with the
desperation of despair.</p>

<p>It was useless.</p>

<p>His speed was not one half as great as that of the trained Apache,
who bounded forward like a panther, and the next instant griped
his horny fingers in the arm of Fred, who uttered a wail, and
sank like one dying.</p>

<p>At that moment, the sharp, penetrating crack of a rifle came
from the direction of the large building, and the warrior, with
an ear-splitting screech, threw up his hands, and fell backward.</p>

<p>"Run, you young beaver! Thar's a chance for you yet!"</p>

<p>The ringing voice of Sut Simpson, aroused the boy, who, finding
himself loose from the grasp of the Indian, bounded forward again.
But he had scarcely done so, when the tramp of horses' hoofs were
heard, and a warrior, more daring than the others, sent his mustang
forward with arrowy swiftness, not behind the lad, but directly
in front of him, so that he was compelled to turn to one side,
in the attempt to dodge him.</p>

<p>Detecting his purpose, a fusilade of rifles was kept up from
the houses, but the Apache seemed to escape them all; and, throwing
himself on the opposite side of the horse, so as to interpose
the body of the latter between himself and his enemies, and, without
checking his speed, he reached down, and catching the bewildered
lad, dashed up the slope, bearing him away in triumph.</p>
