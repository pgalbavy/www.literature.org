<p> For a long time after the course of the steamer <em>Sofala</em>
had been altered for the land, the low swampy coast had retained
its appearance of a mere smudge of darkness beyond a belt of glitter.
The sunrays seemed to fall violently upon the calm sea&mdash;seemed
to shatter themselves upon an adamantine surface into sparkling
dust, into a dazzling vapor of light that blinded the eye and
wearied the brain with its unsteady brightness.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley did not look at it. When his Serang, approaching
the roomy cane arm-chair which he filled capably, had informed
him in a low voice that the course was to be altered, he had risen
at once and had remained on his feet, face forward, while the
head of his ship swung through a quarter of a circle. He had not
uttered a single word, not even the word to steady the helm. It
was the Serang, an elderly, alert, little Malay, with a very dark
skin, who murmured the order to the helmsman. And then slowly
Captain Whalley sat down again in the arm-chair on the bridge
and fixed his eyes on the deck between his feet.</p>

<p>He could not hope to see anything new upon this lane of the sea.
He had been on these coasts for the last three years. From Low
Cape to Malantan the distance was fifty miles, six hours’ steaming
for the old ship with the tide, or seven against. Then you steered
straight for the land, and by-and-by three palms would appear
on the sky, tall and slim, and with their disheveled heads in
a bunch, as if in confidential criticism of the dark mangroves.
The Sofala would be headed towards the somber strip of the coast,
which at a given moment, as the ship closed with it obliquely,
would show several clean shining fractures&mdash;the brimful estuary
of a river. Then on through a brown liquid, three parts water
and one part black earth, on and on between the low shores, three
parts black earth and one part brackish water, the Sofala would
plow her way up-stream, as she had done once every month for these
seven years or more, long before he was aware of her existence,
long before he had ever thought of having anything to do with
her and her invariable voyages. The old ship ought to have known
the road better than her men, who had not been kept so long at
it without a change; better than the faithful Serang, whom he
had brought over from his last ship to keep the captain’s watch;
better than he himself, who had been her captain for the last
three years only. She could always be depended upon to make her
courses. Her compasses were never out. She was no trouble at all
to take about, as if her great age had given her knowledge, wisdom,
and steadiness. She made her landfalls to a degree of the bearing,
and almost to a minute of her allowed time. At any moment, as
he sat on the bridge without looking up, or lay sleepless in his
bed, simply by reckoning the days and the hours he could tell
where he was&mdash;the precise spot of the beat. He knew it well too,
this monotonous huckster’s round, up and down the Straits; he
knew its order and its sights and its people. Malacca to begin
with, in at daylight and out at dusk, to cross over with a rigid
phosphorescent wake this highway of the Far East. Darkness and
gleams on the water, clear stars on a black sky, perhaps the lights
of a home steamer keeping her unswerving course in the middle,
or maybe the elusive shadow of a native craft with her mat sails
flitting by silently&mdash;and the low land on the other side in sight
at daylight. At noon the three palms of the next place of call,
up a sluggish river. The only white man residing there was a retired
young sailor, with whom he had become friendly in the course of
many voyages. Sixty miles farther on there was another place of
call, a deep bay with only a couple of houses on the beach. And
so on, in and out, picking up coastwise cargo here and there,
and finishing with a hundred miles’ steady steaming through the
maze of an archipelago of small islands up to a large native town
at the end of the beat. There was a three days’ rest for the old
ship before he started her again in inverse order, seeing the
same shores from another bearing, hearing the same voices in the
same places, back again to the Sofala’s port of registry on the
great highway to the East, where he would take up a berth nearly
opposite the big stone pile of the harbor office till it was time
to start again on the old round of 1600 miles and thirty days.
Not a very enterprising life, this, for Captain Whalley, Henry
Whalley, otherwise Dare-devil Harry &mdash;Whalley of the Condor,
a famous clipper in her day. No. Not a very enterprising life
for a man who had served famous firms, who had sailed famous ships
(more than one or two of them his own); who had made famous passages,
had been the pioneer of new routes and new trades; who had steered
across the unsurveyed tracts of the South Seas, and had seen the
sun rise on uncharted islands. Fifty years at sea, and forty out
in the East ("a pretty thorough apprenticeship," he used to remark
smilingly), had made him honorably known to a generation of shipowners
and merchants in all the ports from Bombay clear over to where
the East merges into the West upon the coast of the two Americas.
His fame remained writ, not very large but plain enough, on the
Admiralty charts. Was there not somewhere between Australia and
China a Whalley Island and a Condor Reef? On that dangerous coral
formation the celebrated clipper had hung stranded for three days,
her captain and crew throwing her cargo overboard with one hand
and with the other, as it were, keeping off her a flotilla of
savage war-canoes. At that time neither the island nor the reef
had any official existence. Later the officers of her Majesty’s
steam vessel Fusilier, dispatched to make a survey of the route,
recognized in the adoption of these two names the enterprise of
the man and the solidity of the ship. Besides, as anyone who cares
may see, the "General Directory," vol. ii. p. 410, begins the
description of the "Malotu or Whalley Passage" with the words:
"This advantageous route, first discovered in 1850 by Captain
Whalley in the ship Condor," &amp;c., and ends by recommending
it warmly to sailing vessels leaving the China ports for the south
in the months from December to April inclusive.</p>

<p>This was the clearest gain he had out of life. Nothing could
rob him of this kind of fame. The piercing of the Isthmus of Suez,
like the breaking of a dam, had let in upon the East a flood of
new ships, new men, new methods of trade. It had changed the face
of the Eastern seas and the very spirit of their life; so that
his early experiences meant nothing whatever to the new generation
of seamen.</p>

<p>In those bygone days he had handled many thousands of pounds
of his employers’ money and of his own; he had attended faithfully,
as by law a shipmaster is expected to do, to the conflicting interests
of owners, charterers, and underwriters. He had never lost a ship
or consented to a shady transaction; and he had lasted well, outlasting
in the end the conditions that had gone to the making of his name.
He had buried his wife (in the Gulf of Petchili), had married
off his daughter to the man of her unlucky choice, and had lost
more than an ample competence in the crash of the notorious Travancore
and Deccan Banking Corporation, whose downfall had shaken the
East like an earthquake. And he was sixty-five years old.</p>
