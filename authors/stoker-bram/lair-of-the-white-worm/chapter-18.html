The woman turned sharply as Adam touched her shoulder.
<P>
"One moment whilst we are alone.  You had better not trust that
nigger!" he whispered.
<P>
Her answer was crisp and concise:
<P>
"I don't."
<P>
"Forewarned is forearmed.  Tell me if you will--it is for your own
protection.  Why do you mistrust him?"
<P>
"My friend, you have no idea of that man's impudence.  Would you
believe that he wants me to marry him?"
<P>
"No!" said Adam incredulously, amused in spite of himself.
<P>
"Yes, and wanted to bribe me to do it by sharing a chest of
treasure--at least, he thought it was--stolen from Mr. Caswall.  Why
do you distrust him, Mr. Salton?"
<P>
"Did you notice that box he had slung on his shoulder?  That belongs
to me.  I left it in the gun-room when I went to lunch.  He must
have crept in and stolen it.  Doubtless he thinks that it, too, is
full of treasure."
<P>
"He does!"
<P>
"How on earth do you know?" asked Adam.
<P>
"A little while ago he offered to give it to me--another bribe to
accept him.  Faugh!  I am ashamed to tell you such a thing.  The
beast!"
<P>
Whilst they had been speaking, she had opened the door, a narrow
iron one, well hung, for it opened easily and closed tightly without
any creaking or sound of any kind.  Within all was dark; but she
entered as freely and with as little misgiving or restraint as if it
had been broad daylight.  For Adam, there was just sufficient green
light from somewhere for him to see that there was a broad flight of
heavy stone steps leading upward; but Lady Arabella, after shutting
the door behind her, when it closed tightly without a clang, tripped
up the steps lightly and swiftly.  For an instant all was dark, but
there came again the faint green light which enabled him to see the
outlines of things.  Another iron door, narrow like the first and
fairly high, led into another large room, the walls of which were of
massive stones, so closely joined together as to exhibit only one
smooth surface.  This presented the appearance of having at one time
been polished.  On the far side, also smooth like the walls, was the
reverse of a wide, but not high, iron door.  Here there was a little
more light, for the high-up aperture over the door opened to the
air.
<P>
Lady Arabella took from her girdle another small key, which she
inserted in a keyhole in the centre of a massive lock.  The great
bolt seemed wonderfully hung, for the moment the small key was
turned, the bolts of the great lock moved noiselessly and the iron
doors swung open.  On the stone steps outside stood Oolanga, with
the mongoose box slung over his shoulder.  Lady Arabella stood a
little on one side, and the African, accepting the movement as an
invitation, entered in an obsequious way.  The moment, however, that
he was inside, he gave a quick look around him.
<P>
"Much death here--big death.  Many deaths.  Good, good!"
<P>
He sniffed round as if he was enjoying the scent.  The matter and
manner of his speech were so revolting that instinctively Adam's
hand wandered to his revolver, and, with his finger on the trigger,
he rested satisfied that he was ready for any emergency.
<P>
There was certainly opportunity for the nigger's enjoyment, for the
open well-hole was almost under his nose, sending up such a stench
as almost made Adam sick, though Lady Arabella seemed not to mind it
at all.  It was like nothing that Adam had ever met with.  He
compared it with all the noxious experiences he had ever had--the
drainage of war hospitals, of slaughter-houses, the refuse of
dissecting rooms.  None of these was like it, though it had
something of them all, with, added, the sourness of chemical waste
and the poisonous effluvium of the bilge of a water-logged ship
whereon a multitude of rats had been drowned.
<P>
Then, quite unexpectedly, the negro noticed the presence of a third
person--Adam Salton!  He pulled out a pistol and shot at him,
happily missing.  Adam was himself usually a quick shot, but this
time his mind had been on something else and he was not ready.
However, he was quick to carry out an intention, and he was not a
coward.  In another moment both men were in grips.  Beside them was
the dark well-hole, with that horrid effluvium stealing up from its
mysterious depths.
<P>
Adam and Oolanga both had pistols; Lady Arabella, who had not one,
was probably the most ready of them all in the theory of shooting,
but that being impossible, she made her effort in another way.
Gliding forward, she tried to seize the African; but he eluded her
grasp, just missing, in doing so, falling into the mysterious hole.
As he swayed back to firm foothold, he turned his own gun on her and
shot.  Instinctively Adam leaped at his assailant; clutching at each
other, they tottered on the very brink.
<P>
Lady Arabella's anger, now fully awake, was all for Oolanga.  She
moved towards him with her hands extended, and had just seized him
when the catch of the locked box--due to some movement from within--
flew open, and the king-cobra-killer flew at her with a venomous
fury impossible to describe.  As it seized her throat, she caught
hold of it, and, with a fury superior to its own, tore it in two
just as if it had been a sheet of paper.  The strength used for such
an act must have been terrific.  In an instant, it seemed to spout
blood and entrails, and was hurled into the well-hole.  In another
instant she had seized Oolanga, and with a swift rush had drawn him,
her white arms encircling him, down with her into the gaping
aperture.
<P>
Adam saw a medley of green and red lights blaze in a whirling
circle, and as it sank down into the well, a pair of blazing green
eyes became fixed, sank lower and lower with frightful rapidity, and
disappeared, throwing upward the green light which grew more and
more vivid every moment.  As the light sank into the noisome depths,
there came a shriek which chilled Adam's blood--a prolonged agony of
pain and terror which seemed to have no end.
<P>
Adam Salton felt that he would never be able to free his mind from
the memory of those dreadful moments.  The gloom which surrounded
that horrible charnel pit, which seemed to go down to the very
bowels of the earth, conveyed from far down the sights and sounds of
the nethermost hell.  The ghastly fate of the African as he sank
down to his terrible doom, his black face growing grey with terror,
his white eyeballs, now like veined bloodstone, rolling in the
helpless extremity of fear.  The mysterious green light was in
itself a milieu of horror.  And through it all the awful cry came up
from that fathomless pit, whose entrance was flooded with spots of
fresh blood.  Even the death of the fearless little snake-killer--so
fierce, so frightful, as if stained with a ferocity which told of no
living force above earth, but only of the devils of the pit--was
only an incident.  Adam was in a state of intellectual tumult, which
had no parallel in his experience.  He tried to rush away from the
horrible place; even the baleful green light, thrown up through the
gloomy well-shaft, was dying away as its source sank deeper into the
primeval ooze.  The darkness was closing in on him in overwhelming
density--darkness in such a place and with such a memory of it!
<P>
He made a wild rush forward--slipt on the steps in some sticky,
acrid-smelling mass that felt and smelt like blood, and, falling
forward, felt his way into the inner room, where the well-shaft was
not.
<P>
Then he rubbed his eyes in sheer amazement.  Up the stone steps from
the narrow door by which he had entered, glided the white-clad
figure of Lady Arabella, the only colour to be seen on her being
blood-marks on her face and hands and throat.  Otherwise, she was
calm and unruffled, as when earlier she stood aside for him to pass
in through the narrow iron door.
