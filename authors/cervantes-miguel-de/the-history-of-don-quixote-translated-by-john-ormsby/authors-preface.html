<p>Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would
this book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest,
and cleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract
Nature’s law that everything shall beget its like; and what, then,
could this sterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story
of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of
all sorts and such as never came into any other imagination—just
what might be begotten in a prison, where every misery is lodged
and every doleful sound makes its dwelling? Tranquillity, a cheerful
retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies, murmuring brooks, peace
of mind, these are the things that go far to make even the most
barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that fill
it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly,
loutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that
he does not see his defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts
and charms of mind and body, and talks of them to his friends
as wit and grace. I, however—for though I pass for the father,
I am but the stepfather to "Don Quixote"—have no desire to go
with the current of custom, or to implore thee, dearest reader,
almost with tears in my eyes, as others do, to pardon or excuse
the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine. Thou art
neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and
thy will as free as any man’s, whate’er he be, thou art in thine
own house and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and
thou knowest the common saying, "Under my cloak I kill the king;"
all which exempts and frees thee from every consideration and
obligation, and thou canst say what thou wilt of the story without
fear of being abused for any ill or rewarded for any good thou
mayest say of it.</p>

<p>My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,
without any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of
customary sonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly
put at the beginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing
it cost me some labour, I found none greater than the making of
this Preface thou art now reading. Many times did I take up my
pen to write it, and many did I lay it down again, not knowing
what to write. One of these times, as I was pondering with the
paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the desk, and my
cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came in
unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing
me so deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no
mystery of it, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had
to make for the story of "Don Quixote," which so troubled me that
I had a mind not to make any at all, nor even publish the achievements
of so noble a knight.</p>

<p>"For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that
ancient lawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me,
after slumbering so many years in the silence of oblivion, coming
out now with all my years upon my back, and with a book as dry
as a rush, devoid of invention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts,
wholly wanting in learning and wisdom, without quotations in the
margin or annotations at the end, after the fashion of other books
I see, which, though all fables and profanity, are so full of
maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole herd of philosophers,
that they fill the readers with amazement and convince them that
the authors are men of learning, erudition, and eloquence. And
then, when they quote the Holy Scriptures!—anyone would say they
are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as
they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe
a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon
that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this
there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote
in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I know
what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as
all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and
ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer
and the other a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets
at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises,
counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to
ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me them,
and such as the productions of those that have the highest reputation
in our Spain could not equal.</p>

<p>"In short, my friend," I continued, "I am determined that Señor
Don Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La
Mancha until Heaven provide someone to garnish him with all those
things he stands in need of; because I find myself, through my
shallowness and want of learning, unequal to supplying them, and
because I am by nature shy and careless about hunting for authors
to say what I myself can say without them. Hence the cogitation
and abstraction you found me in, and reason enough, what you have
heard from me."</p>

<p>Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead
and breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, "Before God, Brother,
now am I disabused of an error in which I have been living all
this long time I have known you, all through which I have taken
you to be shrewd and sensible in all you do; but now I see you
are as far from that as the heaven is from the earth. It is possible
that things of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy
and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit to break through and crush
far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes, not of any want
of ability, but of too much indolence and too little knowledge
of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? Well,
then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting
of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all
those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from
bringing before the world the story of your famous Don Quixote,
the light and mirror of all knight-errantry."</p>

<p>"Say on," said I, listening to his talk; "how do you propose
to make up for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of
perplexity I am in?"</p>

<p>To which he made answer, "Your first difficulty about the sonnets,
epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning,
and which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be
removed if you yourself take a little trouble to make them; you
can afterwards baptise them, and put any name you like to them,
fathering them on Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of
Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to have been famous
poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants or bachelors
should attack you and question the fact, never care two maravedis
for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot
cut off the hand you wrote it with.</p>

<p>"As to references in the margin to the books and authors from
whom you take the aphorisms and sayings you put into your story,
it is only contriving to fit in nicely any sentences or scraps
of Latin you may happen to have by heart, or at any rate that
will not give you much trouble to look up; so as, when you speak
of freedom and captivity, to insert</p>

<p><em>Non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro;</em></p>

<p>and then refer in the margin to Horace, or whoever said it; or,
if you allude to the power of death, to come in with—</p>

<p><em>Pallida mors æquo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas, Regumque
turres.</em></p>

<p>"If it be friendship and the love God bids us bear to our enemy,
go at once to the Holy Scriptures, which you can do with a very
small amount of research, and quote no less than the words of
God himself: <em>Ego autem dico vobis: diligite inimicos vestros.</em>
If you speak of evil thoughts, turn to the Gospel: <em>De corde
exeunt cogitationes malæ.</em> If of the fickleness of friends,
there is Cato, who will give you his distich:</p>

<p><em>Donec eris felix multos numerabis amicos, Tempora si fuerint
nubila, solus eris.</em></p>

<p>"With these and such like bits of Latin they will take you for
a grammarian at all events, and that now-a-days is no small honour
and profit.</p>

<p>"With regard to adding annotations at the end of the book, you
may safely do it in this way. If you mention any giant in your
book contrive that it shall be the giant Goliath, and with this
alone, which will cost you almost nothing, you have a grand note,
for you can put—<em>The giant Golias or Goliath was a Philistine
whom the shepherd David slew by a mighty stone-cast in the Terebinth
valley, as is related in the Book of Kings</em>—in the chapter
where you find it written.</p>

<p>"Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature
and cosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in
your story, and there you are at once with another famous annotation,
setting forth—<em>The river Tagus was so called after a King of
Spain: it has its source in such and such a place and falls into
the ocean, kissing the walls of the famous city of Lisbon, and
it is a common belief that it has golden sands</em>, etc. If you
should have anything to do with robbers, I will give you the story
of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women, there is
the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia,
Laida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit;
if with hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if
with witches or enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe;
if with valiant captains, Julius Cæsar himself will lend you himself
in his own ‘Commentaries,’ and Plutarch will give you a thousand
Alexanders. If you should deal with love, with two ounces you
may know of Tuscan you can go to Leon the Hebrew, who will supply
you to your heart’s content; or if you should not care to go to
foreign countries you have at home Fonseca’s ‘Of the Love of God,’
in which is condensed all that you or the most imaginative mind
can want on the subject. In short, all you have to do is to manage
to quote these names, or refer to these stories I have mentioned,
and leave it to me to insert the annotations and quotations, and
I swear by all that’s good to fill your margins and use up four
sheets at the end of the book.</p>

<p>"Now let us come to those references to authors which other books
have, and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple:
You have only to look out for some book that quotes them all,
from A to Z as you say yourself, and then insert the very same
alphabet in your book, and though the imposition may be plain
to see, because you have so little need to borrow from them, that
is no matter; there will probably be some simple enough to believe
that you have made use of them all in this plain, artless story
of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this long
catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of authority
to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify whether
you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way concerned
in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has
no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is,
from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of
which Aristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero
had any knowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations
of astrology come within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor
have geometrical measurements or refutations of the arguments
used in rhetoric anything to do with it; nor does it mean to preach
to anybody, mixing up things human and divine, a sort of motley
in which no Christian understanding should dress itself. It has
only to avail itself of truth to nature in its composition, and
the more perfect the imitation the better the work will be. And
as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the
authority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world
and with the public, there is no need for you to go a-begging
for aphorisms from philosophers, precepts from Holy Scripture,
fables from poets, speeches from orators, or miracles from saints;
but merely to take care that your style and diction run musically,
pleasantly, and plainly, with clear, proper, and well-placed words,
setting forth your purpose to the best of your power, and putting
your ideas intelligibly, without confusion or obscurity. Strive,
too, that in reading your story the melancholy may be moved to
laughter, and the merry made merrier still; that the simple shall
not be wearied, that the judicious shall admire the invention,
that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to praise
it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that ill-founded
edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised by
many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no
small success."</p>

<p>In profound silence I listened to what my friend said, and his
observations made such an impression on me that, without attempting
to question them, I admitted their soundness, and out of them
I determined to make this Preface; wherein, gentle reader, thou
wilt perceive my friend’s good sense, my good fortune in finding
such an adviser in such a time of need, and what thou hast gained
in receiving, without addition or alteration, the story of the
famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, who is held by all the inhabitants
of the district of the Campo de Montiel to have been the chastest
lover and the bravest knight that has for many years been seen
in that neighbourhood. I have no desire to magnify the service
I render thee in making thee acquainted with so renowned and honoured
a knight, but I do desire thy thanks for the acquaintance thou
wilt make with the famous Sancho Panza, his squire, in whom, to
my thinking, I have given thee condensed all the squirely drolleries
that are scattered through the swarm of the vain books of chivalry.
And so—may God give thee health, and not forget me. Vale.</p>

<p><em>SOME COMMENDATORY VERSES</em></p>

<p><em>URGANDA THE UNKNOWN</em></p>

<p>To the book of Don Quixote of la Mancha</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
If to be welcomed by the good,<br/>
O Book! thou make thy steady aim,<br/>
No empty chatterer will dare<br/>
To question or dispute thy claim.<br/>
But if perchance thou hast a mind<br/>
To win of idiots approbation,<br/>
Lost labour will be thy reward,<br/>
Though they’ll pretend appreciation.

</p>
<p>
They say a goodly shade he finds<br/>
Who shelters ’neath a goodly tree;<br/>
And such a one thy kindly star<br/>
In Bejar bath provided thee:<br/>
A royal tree whose spreading boughs<br/>
A show of princely fruit display;<br/>
A tree that bears a noble Duke,<br/>
The Alexander of his day.

</p>
<p>
Of a Manchegan gentleman<br/>
Thy purpose is to tell the story,<br/>
Relating how he lost his wits<br/>
O’er idle tales of love and glory,<br/>
Of "ladies, arms, and cavaliers:"<br/>
A new Orlando Furioso—<br/>
Innamorato, rather—who<br/>
Won Dulcinea del Toboso.

</p>
<p>
Put no vain emblems on thy shield;<br/>
All figures—that is bragging play.<br/>
A modest dedication make,<br/>
And give no scoffer room to say,<br/>
"What! Álvaro de Luna here?<br/>
Or is it Hannibal again?<br/>
Or does King Francis at Madrid<br/>
Once more of destiny complain?"

</p>
<p>
Since Heaven it hath not pleased on thee<br/>
Deep erudition to bestow,<br/>
Or black Latino’s gift of tongues,<br/>
No Latin let thy pages show.<br/>
Ape not philosophy or wit,<br/>
Lest one who cannot comprehend,<br/>
Make a wry face at thee and ask,<br/>
"Why offer flowers to me, my friend?"

</p>
<p>
Be not a meddler; no affair<br/>
Of thine the life thy neighbours lead:<br/>
Be prudent; oft the random jest<br/>
Recoils upon the jester’s head.<br/>
Thy constant labour let it be<br/>
To earn thyself an honest name,<br/>
For fooleries preserved in print<br/>
Are perpetuity of shame.

</p>
<p>
A further counsel bear in mind:<br/>
If that thy roof be made of glass,<br/>
It shows small wit to pick up stones<br/>
To pelt the people as they pass.<br/>
Win the attention of the wise,<br/>
And give the thinker food for thought;<br/>
Whoso indites frivolities,<br/>
Will but by simpletons be sought.

Thou that didst imitate that life of mine<br/>

Great were my feats, eternal fame their meed;<br/>

Ever to knighthood’s laws gave I good heed.<br/>
