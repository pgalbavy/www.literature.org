<p>In the morning, when the bugle sounded from the barracks they rose
and looked out of the window.  She loved his body that was proud
and blond and able to take command.  And he loved her body that was
soft and eternal.  They looked at the faint grey vapour of summer
steaming off from the greenness and ripeness of the fields.  There
was no town anywhere, their look ended in the haze of the summer
morning.  Their bodies rested together, their minds tranquil.  Then
a little anxiety stirred in both of them from the sound of the
bugle.  She was called back to her old position, to realize the
world of authority she did not understand but had wanted to serve.
But this call died away again from her.  She had all.</p>

<p>She went downstairs to her work, curiously changed.  She was in a
new world of her own, that she had never even imagined, and which
was the land of promise for all that.  In this she moved and had
her being.  And she extended it to her duties.  She was curiously
happy and absorbed.  She had not to strive out of herself to do her
work.  The doing came from within her without call or command.  It
was a delicious outflow, like sunshine, the activity that flowed
from her and put her tasks to rights.</p>

<p>Bachmann sat busily thinking.  He would have to get all his plans
ready.  He must write to his mother, and she must send him money to
Paris.  He would go to Paris, and from thence, quickly, to America.
It had to be done.  He must make all preparations.  The dangerous
part was the getting into France.  He thrilled in anticipation.
During the day he would need a time-table of the trains going to
Paris - he would need to think.  It gave him delicious pleasure,
using all his wits.  It seemed such an adventure.</p>

<p>This one day, and he would escape then into freedom.  What an agony
of need he had for absolute, imperious freedom.  He had won to his
own being, in himself and Emilie, he had drawn the stigma from his
shame, he was beginning to be himself.  And now he wanted madly to
be free to go on.  A home, his work, and absolute freedom to move
and to be, in her, with her, this was his passionate desire.  He
thought in a kind of ecstasy, living an hour of painful intensity.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard voices, and a tramping of feet.  His heart gave a
great leap, then went still.  He was taken.  He had known all
along.  A complete silence filled his body and soul, a silence like
death, a suspension of life and sound.  He stood motionless in the
bedroom, in perfect suspension.</p>

<p>Emilie was busy passing swiftly about the kitchen preparing the
children's breakfasts when she heard the tramp of feet and the
voice of the Baron.  The latter had come in from the garden, and
was wearing an old green linen suit.  He was a man of middle
stature, quick, finely made, and of whimsical charm.  His right
hand had been shot in the Franco-Prussian war, and now, as always
when he was much agitated, he shook it down at his side, as if it
hurt.  He was talking rapidly to a young, stiff Ober-leutnant.  Two
private soldiers stood bearishly in the doorway.</p>

<p>Emilie, shocked out of herself, stood pale and erect, recoiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, if you think so, we can look,&quot; the Baron was hastily and
irascibly saying.</p>

<p>&quot;Emilie,&quot; he said, turning to the girl, &quot;did you put a post card to
the mother of this Bachmann in the box last evening?&quot;</p>

<p>Emilie stood erect and did not answer.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; said the Baron sharply.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Herr Baron,&quot; replied Emilie, neutral.</p>

<p>The Baron's wounded hand shook rapidly in exasperation.  The
lieutenant drew himself up still more stiffly.  He was right.</p>

<p>&quot;And do you know anything of the fellow?&quot; asked the Baron, looking
at her with his blazing, greyish-golden eyes.  The girl looked back
at him steadily, dumb, but her whole soul naked before him.  For
two seconds he looked at her in silence.  Then in silence, ashamed
and furious, he turned away.</p>

<p>&quot;Go up!&quot; he said, with his fierce, peremptory command, to the young
officer.</p>

<p>The lieutenant gave his order, in military cold confidence, to the
soldiers.  They all tramped across the hall.  Emilie stood
motionless, her life suspended.</p>

<p>The Baron marched swiftly upstairs and down the corridor, the
lieutenant and the common soldiers followed.  The Baron flung open
the door of Emilie's room and looked at Bachmann, who stood
watching, standing in shirt and trousers beside the bed, fronting
the door.  He was perfectly still.  His eyes met the furious,
blazing look of the Baron.  The latter shook his wounded hand, and
then went still.  He looked into the eyes of the soldier, steadily.
He saw the same naked soul exposed, as if he looked really into the
MAN.  And the man was helpless, the more helpless for his singular
nakedness.</p>

<p>&quot;Ha!&quot; he exclaimed impatiently, turning to the approaching
lieutenant.</p>

<p>The latter appeared in the doorway.  Quickly his eyes travelled
over the bare-footed youth.  He recognized him as his object.  He
gave the brief command to dress.</p>

<p>Bachmann turned round for his clothes.  He was very still, silent
in himself.  He was in an abstract, motionless world.  That the two
gentlemen and the two soldiers stood watching him, he scarcely
realized.  They could not see him.</p>

<p>Soon he was ready.  He stood at attention.  But only the shell of
his body was at attention.  A curious silence, a blankness, like
something eternal, possessed him.  He remained true to himself.</p>

<p>The lieutenant gave the order to march.  The little procession went
down the stairs with careful, respectful tread, and passed through
the hall to the kitchen.  There Emilie stood with her face
uplifted, motionless and expressionless.  Bachmann did not look at
her.  They knew each other.  They were themselves.  Then the little
file of men passed out into the courtyard.</p>

<p>The Baron stood in the doorway watching the four figures in uniform
pass through the chequered shadow under the lime trees.  Bachmann
was walking neutralized, as if he were not there.  The lieutenant
went brittle and long, the two soldiers lumbered beside.  They
passed out into the sunny morning, growing smaller, going towards
the barracks.</p>

<p>The Baron turned into the kitchen.  Emilie was cutting bread.</p>

<p>&quot;So he stayed the night here?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>The girl looked at him, scarcely seeing.  She was too much herself.
The Baron saw the dark, naked soul of her body in her unseeing
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;What were you going to do?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;He was going to America,&quot; she replied, in a still voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Pah!  You should have sent him straight back,&quot; fired the Baron.</p>

<p>Emilie stood at his bidding, untouched.</p>

<p>&quot;He's done for now,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>But he could not bear the dark, deep nakedness of her eyes, that
scarcely changed under this suffering.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing but a fool,&quot; he repeated, going away in agitation, and
preparing himself for what he could do.</p>
