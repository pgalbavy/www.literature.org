<p>Perhaps Jack Starland's most noticeable trait in boyhood was
his fondness for the water. He was a magnificent swimmer and learned
to handle a small boat with the skill of a veteran sailor. Some
of his dare-devil exploits in cruising among the Farallones and
down the coast caused his father great concern. He placed such
severe restrictions upon the lad that he rebelled. One day he
slipped out of the house, went down to the wharf and engaged to
go as cabin boy on a South Sea whaler. At the critical moment,
however, his conscience asserted itself and he drew back. His
father never knew of this particular episode in the life of his
son. Had it been carried out, it would have broken the parent's
heart.</p>

<p>It was shortly after this that Jack received his appointment
to the Military Academy. He had told his "sister" Warrenia of
his narrow escape from playing the part of a fool and ingrate,
and naturally she was horrified.</p>

<p>"There never would have been the slightest excuse for such folly
and wickedness," said she, as the two sat in a palace car of the
overland train, flying eastward; "you have the kindest of fathers
and you can never do enough to repay your obligations to him."</p>

<p>"I admit all that," replied the young man smiling, "but what's
the use of rubbing it in when I <em>didn't</em> run away?"</p>

<p>"But you started to do so," she persisted.</p>

<p>"And stopped in time: what was wrong in <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"It was wrong that you should have had a minute when you seriously
intended to commit the crime."</p>

<p>"Commit the crime!" he repeated, with a reproving look; "perhaps
it would have been a crime, but I'm not so sure about that."</p>

<p>"I am; Jack I'm ashamed of you."</p>

<p>"So am I; but don't forget that I was younger then than now."</p>

<p>"Yes; two or three months; persons sometimes grow a good deal
in that period."</p>

<p>"They may not grow so much in stature, but they do in sense."</p>

<p>"I have heard of such instances, but I do not remember to have
met any."</p>

<p>"Come now, sister," laughed the youth who admired his friend's
brilliancy, "I beg you to let up; I confess all you have charged;
I am a base villain, for whom hanging would be too good; you will
be filled with remorse when I become General of the army and you
recall all the harsh words you have said of me."</p>

<p>"<em>When</em> you become General I will mourn my cruelty in
sackcloth and ashes. But I am willing to change the subject. Let
us drop the past and talk of the future. Your term at West Point
I believe is four years."</p>

<p>"Provided I'm not 'found' as the expression goes. But I'm not
really admitted as yet, though I passed the preliminary examination
before leaving home and won my appointment in a competitive contest.
The decisive examination will take place at the Point when I get
there; I understand it is severe, but I am quite confident."</p>

<p>"You always were, no matter what issue was involved."</p>

<p>Since we have already learned that all went well with the young
man, it is not necessary to repeat the speculation of the couple
as they steamed eastward. Jack did enter the Military Academy,
and, as I have said, made a creditable record for himself. Warrenia
Rowland at the same time became a student in the famous young
ladies' seminary, to which further reference will be made later,
and the two were graduated within a few weeks of each other.</p>

<p>It would be supposed that the military career upon which Major
Jack Starland entered would have extinguished his love of boating
and the water, but it did not. Could he have chosen his profession
it would have been that of the navy, and he would have entered
the Academy at Annapolis, but that could not be arranged and he
threw his whole energies into the military work.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Jack's room mate and intimate friend was
the son of a prominent ship builder in the East. This youth was
as fond of the sea as the young Californian. In one respect he
was more fortunate, for his father had presented him with a superb
yacht, with which he had cruised up and down the Atlantic coast
and made a trip or two to the West Indies. I may as well add that
this same yacht was placed at the disposal of our government at
the opening of the war with Spain and did good service in scouting
in Cuban waters.</p>

<p>The cadets at West Point have only one vacation during their
four years' course; that comes at the end of two years and lasts
for a couple of months. Jack Starland made a flying visit home
and then accepted the invitation of his room mate to go on a cruise
with him in his yacht. It being in the summer time, the craft
headed northward and visited Newport, Bar Harbor and several other
noted resorts on the Atlantic seaboard.</p>

<p>The excursion was a continual delight to both young men, who,
as you are aware, must have been fine specimens of physical vigor,
or they would not have been in the Military Academy. Jack wrote
such a glowing account of his holiday that his father's heart
was touched. He read the letter to his partner who remarked:</p>

<p>"A good sailor was spoiled when Jack became a soldier."</p>

<p>"I never knew a lad with a stronger liking for a nautical life.
Nothing would have delighted him more than to become a sailor.
What makes me respect Jack, is that with all this overwhelming
fondness for a sailor's life, he has had too much good sense to
yield to it. He has never asked me to allow him to go to sea,
but has always placed my wishes first. Do you know, Teddy, that
even when a headlong, impetuous youngster, he must have withstood
temptation with Roman firmness. Of course for the last year or
two no thought of going contrary to my desires has ever entered
his mind."</p>

<p>(Ah, fond parent, you are but a single example of multitudes
of fathers, who have kept their eyes closed to what was going
on within touch of their hands.)</p>

<p>"A father is a poorer judge of his children than others. My love
for Jack is hardly second to yours, but I am not blind to his
faults. I am glad to say that he hasn't any more of them than
he is entitled to have. No father ever had a more obedient son;
judging the boy therefore, in cold blood, I must say I agree fully
with you. If anybody had suggested to Jack when a boy that he
should go contrary to your wishes or run away, he would have made
it a <em>casus belli</em>."</p>

<p>(From which remark, it would appear that the father of a boy
is not always the only one who makes an error concerning the youth.)</p>

<p>"What I'm getting at, Teddy, is this: the reading of that letter
from Jack has caused me to decide upon a piece of extravagance.
I'm going to present him with a handsome yacht."</p>

<p>"It will cost you a tidy sum, Tom."</p>

<p>"I know that, but it will be a good investment. He may not have
many opportunities for enjoying it while he is an officer of the
army, but unless we have war very soon, Jack will follow the example
of many others who have been educated at West Point and resign,
holding himself at the disposal of the government whenever needed.
Of course his ultimate destination is here, in our business, in
this office, and the yacht will come in handy during his vacation
times."</p>

<p>"And probably add to the number of his vacations."</p>

<p>"Which will be well; for it can be said of few of our business
men that they have more vacations than are necessary or good for
them."</p>

<p>"May I give you a suggestion, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I am always glad to receive anything of the kind from you."</p>

<p>"We can make as good yachts on this side of the continent as
in the shipyards of the East. Nevertheless, purchase Jack's yacht
in the East."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"To bring it through the Golden Gate, he will have to come around
Cape Horn."</p>

<p>"A pretty risky voyage,&mdash;one that tests the staunchness of a
boat and the seamanship of the captain."</p>

<p>"True, and make it a condition that Jack himself shall bring
the yacht to California."</p>

<p>"It shall be done,&mdash;nothing will delight the young rascal more."</p>
