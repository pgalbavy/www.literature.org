<p>ONE warm damp June night the Denver Express was speeding westward across
the earthy-smelling plains of Iowa. The lights in the day-coach were
turned low and the ventilators were open, admitting showers of soot and
dust upon the occupants of the narrow green plush chairs which were
tilted at various angles of discomfort. In each of these chairs some
uncomfortable human being lay drawn up, or stretched out, or writhing
from one position to another. There were tired men in rumpled shirts,
their necks bare and their suspenders down; old women with their heads
tied up in black handkerchiefs; bedraggled young women who went to sleep
while they were nursing their babies and forgot to button up their
dresses; dirty boys who added to the general discomfort by taking off
their boots. The brakeman, when he came through at midnight, sniffed the
heavy air disdainfully and looked up at the ventilators. As he glanced
down the double rows of contorted figures, he saw one pair of eyes that
were wide open and bright, a yellow head that was not overcome by the
stupefying heat and smell in the car. “There's a girl for you,” he
thought as he stopped by Thea's chair.
</p><p>“Like to have the window up a little?” he asked.
</p><p>Thea smiled up at him, not misunderstanding his friendliness. “The girl
behind me is sick; she can't stand a draft. What time is it, please?”
</p><p>He took out his open-faced watch and held it before her eyes with a
knowing look. “In a hurry?” he asked. “I'll leave the end door open and
air you out. Catch a wink; the time'll go faster.”
</p><p>Thea nodded good-night to him and settled her head back on her pillow,
looking up at the oil lamps. She was going back to Moonstone for her
summer vacation, and she was sitting up all night in a day-coach because
that seemed such an easy way to save money. At her age discomfort was a
small matter, when one made five dollars a day by it. She had
confidently expected to sleep after the car got quiet, but in the two
chairs behind her were a sick girl and her mother, and the girl had been
coughing steadily since ten o'clock. They had come from somewhere in
Pennsylvania, and this was their second night on the road. The mother
said they were going to Colorado “for her daughter's lungs.” The
daughter was a little older than Thea, perhaps nineteen, with patient
dark eyes and curly brown hair. She was pretty in spite of being so
sooty and travel-stained. She had put on an ugly figured satine kimono
over her loosened clothes. Thea, when she boarded the train in Chicago,
happened to stop and plant her heavy telescope on this seat. She had not
intended to remain there, but the sick girl had looked up at her with an
eager smile and said, “Do sit there, miss. I'd so much rather not have a
gentleman in front of me.”
</p><p>After the girl began to cough there were no empty seats left, and if
there had been Thea could scarcely have changed without hurting her
feelings. The mother turned on her side and went to sleep; she was used
to the cough. But the girl lay wide awake, her eyes fixed on the roof of
the car, as Thea's were. The two girls must have seen very different
things there.
</p><p>Thea fell to going over her winter in Chicago. It was only under unusual
or uncomfortable conditions like these that she could keep her mind
fixed upon herself or her own affairs for any length of time. The rapid
motion and the vibration of the wheels under her seemed to give her
thoughts rapidity and clearness. She had taken twenty very expensive
lessons from Madison Bowers, but she did not yet know what he thought of
her or of her ability. He was different from any man with whom she had
ever had to do. With her other teachers she had felt a personal
relation; but with him she did not. Bowers was a cold, bitter,
avaricious man, but he knew a great deal about voices. He worked with a
voice as if he were in a laboratory, conducting a series of experiments.
He was conscientious and industrious, even capable of a certain cold
fury when he was working with an interesting voice, but Harsanyi
declared that he had the soul of a shrimp, and could no more make an
artist than a throat specialist could. Thea realized that he had taught
her a great deal in twenty lessons.
</p><p>Although she cared so much less for Bowers than for Harsanyi, Thea was,
on the whole, happier since she had been studying with him than she had
been before. She had always told herself that she studied piano to fit
herself to be a music teacher. But she never asked herself why she was
studying voice. Her voice, more than any other part of her, had to do
with that confidence, that sense of wholeness and inner well-being that
she had felt at moments ever since she could remember.
</p><p>Of this feeling Thea had never spoken to any human being until that day
when she told Harsanyi that “there had always been--something.” Hitherto
she had felt but one obligation toward it--secrecy; to protect it even
from herself. She had always believed that by doing all that was
required of her by her family, her teachers, her pupils, she kept that
part of herself from being caught up in the meshes of common things. She
took it for granted that some day, when she was older, she would know a
great deal more about it. It was as if she had an appointment to meet
the rest of herself sometime, somewhere. It was moving to meet her and
she was moving to meet it. That meeting awaited her, just as surely as,
for the poor girl in the seat behind her, there awaited a hole in the
earth, already dug.
</p><p>For Thea, so much had begun with a hole in the earth. Yes, she
reflected, this new part of her life had all begun that morning when she
sat on the clay bank beside Ray Kennedy, under the flickering shade of
the cottonwood tree. She remembered the way Ray had looked at her that
morning. Why had he cared so much? And Wunsch, and Dr. Archie, and
Spanish Johnny, why had they? It was something that had to do with her
that made them care, but it was not she. It was something they believed
in, but it was not she. Perhaps each of them concealed another person in
himself, just as she did. Why was it that they seemed to feel and to
hunt for a second person in her and not in each other? Thea frowned up
at the dull lamp in the roof of the car. What if one's second self could
somehow speak to all these second selves? What if one could bring them
out, as whiskey did Spanish Johnny's? How deep they lay, these second
persons, and how little one knew about them, except to guard them
fiercely. It was to music, more than to anything else, that these hidden
things in people responded. Her mother--even her mother had something of
that sort which replied to music.
</p><p>Thea found herself listening for the coughing behind her and not hearing
it. She turned cautiously and looked back over the head-rest of her
chair. The poor girl had fallen asleep. Thea looked at her intently. Why
was she so afraid of men? Why did she shrink into herself and avert her
face whenever a man passed her chair? Thea thought she knew; of course,
she knew. How horrible to waste away like that, in the time when one
ought to be growing fuller and stronger and rounder every day. Suppose
there were such a dark hole open for her, between to-night and that
place where she was to meet herself? Her eyes narrowed. She put her hand
on her breast and felt how warm it was; and within it there was a full,
powerful pulsation. She smiled--though she was ashamed of it--with the
natural contempt of strength for weakness, with the sense of physical
security which makes the savage merciless. Nobody could die while they
felt like that inside. The springs there were wound so tight that it
would be a long while before there was any slack in them. The life in
there was rooted deep. She was going to have a few things before she
died. She realized that there were a great many trains dashing east and
west on the face of the continent that night, and that they all carried
young people who meant to have things. But the difference was that SHE
WAS GOING TO GET THEM! That was all. Let people try to stop her! She
glowered at the rows of feckless bodies that lay sprawled in the chairs.
Let them try it once! Along with the yearning that came from some deep
part of her, that was selfless and exalted, Thea had a hard kind of
cockiness, a determination to get ahead. Well, there are passages in
life when that fierce, stubborn self-assertion will stand its ground
after the nobler feeling is overwhelmed and beaten under.
</p><p>Having told herself once more that she meant to grab a few things, Thea
went to sleep.
</p><p>She was wakened in the morning by the sunlight, which beat fiercely
through the glass of the car window upon her face. She made herself as
clean as she could, and while the people all about her were getting cold
food out of their lunch-baskets she escaped into the dining-car. Her
thrift did not go to the point of enabling her to carry a lunchbasket.
At that early hour there were few people in the dining-car. The linen
was white and fresh, the darkies were trim and smiling, and the sunlight
gleamed pleasantly upon the silver and the glass water-bottles. On each
table there was a slender vase with a single pink rose in it. When Thea
sat down she looked into her rose and thought it the most beautiful
thing in the world; it was wide open, recklessly offering its yellow
heart, and there were drops of water on the petals. All the future was
in that rose, all that one would like to be. The flower put her in an
absolutely regal mood. She had a whole pot of coffee, and scrambled eggs
with chopped ham, utterly disregarding the astonishing price they cost.
She had faith enough in what she could do, she told herself, to have
eggs if she wanted them. At the table opposite her sat a man and his
wife and little boy--Thea classified them as being “from the East.”
 They spoke in that quick, sure staccato, which Thea, like Ray Kennedy,
pretended to scorn and secretly admired. People who could use words in
that confident way, and who spoke them elegantly, had a great advantage
in life, she reflected. There were so many words which she could not
pronounce in speech as she had to do in singing. Language was like
clothes; it could be a help to one, or it could give one away. But the
most important thing was that one should not pretend to be what one was
not.
</p><p>When she paid her check she consulted the waiter. “Waiter, do you
suppose I could buy one of those roses? I'm out of the day-coach, and
there is a sick girl in there. I'd like to take her a cup of coffee and
one of those flowers.”
</p><p>The waiter liked nothing better than advising travelers less
sophisticated than himself. He told Thea there were a few roses left in
the icebox and he would get one. He took the flower and the coffee into
the day-coach. Thea pointed out the girl, but she did not accompany him.
She hated thanks and never received them gracefully. She stood outside
on the platform to get some fresh air into her lungs. The train was
crossing the Platte River now, and the sunlight was so intense that it
seemed to quiver in little flames on the glittering sandbars, the scrub
willows, and the curling, fretted shallows.
</p><p>Thea felt that she was coming back to her own land. She had often heard
Mrs. Kronborg say that she “believed in immigration,” and so did Thea
believe in it. This earth seemed to her young and fresh and kindly, a
place where refugees from old, sad countries were given another chance.
The mere absence of rocks gave the soil a kind of amiability and
generosity, and the absence of natural boundaries gave the spirit a
wider range. Wire fences might mark the end of a man's pasture, but they
could not shut in his thoughts as mountains and forests can. It was over
flat lands like this, stretching out to drink the sun, that the larks
sang--and one's heart sang there, too. Thea was glad that this was her
country, even if one did not learn to speak elegantly there. It was,
somehow, an honest country, and there was a new song in that blue air
which had never been sung in the world before. It was hard to tell about
it, for it had nothing to do with words; it was like the light of the
desert at noon, or the smell of the sagebrush after rain; intangible but
powerful. She had the sense of going back to a friendly soil, whose
friendship was somehow going to strengthen her; a naive, generous
country that gave one its joyous force, its large-hearted, childlike
power to love, just as it gave one its coarse, brilliant flowers.
</p><p>As she drew in that glorious air Thea's mind went back to Ray Kennedy.
He, too, had that feeling of empire; as if all the Southwest really
belonged to him because he had knocked about over it so much, and knew
it, as he said, “like the blisters on his own hands.” That feeling, she
reflected, was the real element of companionship between her and Ray.
Now that she was going back to Colorado, she realized this as she had
not done before.
