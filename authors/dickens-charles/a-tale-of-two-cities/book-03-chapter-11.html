<P>THE WRETCHED WIFE of the innocent man thus doomed to die, fell under
the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered
no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it
was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not
augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.
<P>The Judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of
doors, the Tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the
court's emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie
stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her
face but love and consolation.
<P>"If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good
citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!"
<P>There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who
had taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to
the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, "Let her embrace
him then; it is but a moment." It was silently acquiesced in, and they
passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he,
by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.
<P>"Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my
love. We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!"
<P>They were her husband's words, as he held her to his bosom.
<P>"I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don't
suffer for me. A parting blessing for our child."
<P>"I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her
by you."
<P>"My husband. No! A moment!" He was tearing himself apart from her.
"We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my
heart by-and-bye; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I
leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me."
<P>Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to
both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:
<P>"No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should
kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know,
now what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you
knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and
conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and
all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!"
<P>Her father's only answer was to draw his hands through his white
hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.
<P>"It could not be otherwise," said the prisoner. "All things have
worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain
endeavour to discharge my poor mother's trust that first brought my
fatal presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier
end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and
forgive me. Heaven bless you!"
<P>As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after
him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and
with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a
comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners' door, she turned,
laid her head lovingly on her father's breast, tried to speak to
him, and fell at his feet.
<P>Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved,
Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were
with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head.
Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity- that had a
flush of pride in it.
<P>"Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight."
<P>He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in
a coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took
his seat beside the driver.
<P>When they arrived at the gateway where he had paused in the dark not
many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough
stones of the street her feet had trodden, he lifted her again, and
carried her up rhe staircase to their rooms. There, he laid her down
on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her.
<P>"Don't recall her to herself," he said, softly, to the latter,
"she is better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only
faints."
<P>"Oh, Carton, Carton, Carton!" cried little Lucie, springing up and
throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. "Now
that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma,
something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all
the people who love her, bear to see her so?"
<P>He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his
face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious
mother.
<P>"Before I go," he said, and paused- "I may kiss her?"
<P>It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched
her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was
nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren
when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, "A life
you love."
<P>When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr.
Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:
<P>"You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at
least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very
friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?"
<P>"Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the
strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did." He returned
the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.
<P>"Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon
are few and short, but try."
<P>"I intend to try. I will not rest a moment."
<P>"That's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things
before now- though never," he added, with a smile and a sigh together,
"such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when
we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay
down if it were not."
<P>"I will go," said Doctor Manette, "to the Prosecutor and the
President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to
name. I will write too, and- But stay! There is a celebration in the
streets, and no one will be accessible until dark."
<P>"That's true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much
the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how
you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have
seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?"
<P>"Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from
this."
<P>"It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If
I go to Mr. Lorry's at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either
from our friend or from yourself?"
<P>"Yes."
<P>"May you prosper!"
<P>Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on
the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.
<P>"I have no hope," said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.
<P>"Nor have I."
<P>"If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to
spare him- which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or
any man's to them!- I doubt if they durst spare him after the
demonstration in the court."
<P>"And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound."
<P>Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon
it.
<P>"Don't despond," said Carton, very gently; "don't grieve. I
encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might
one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life
was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her."
<P>"Yes, yes, yes," returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, "you are
right.
<P>But he will perish; there is no real hope."
<P>"Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope," echoed Carton. And
walked with a settled step, down-stairs.
