<p>It must not be thought that the large assemblage which had gathered
in the Big Lodge were of one mind, or even that a majority were
ready to accept the new religion that was explained to them by
its model exemplar, Deerfoot the Shawanoe. A few yearned for the
light, and had already learned enough of the elemental truths
to be drawn toward them; but the majority were attracted by that
potent cause&mdash;curiosity. They listened closely. The simple words
of the preacher showed clearly that the new faith was the opposite
of the old; that, if accepted by them, it meant a revolution in
their beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>Most of the men and a few of the women revolted at the thought.
To them the most powerful of motives in human conduct were those
of revenge, of prowess in battle, and of mercilessness toward
an enemy. To be told that they must root out this passion and
be governed by the Golden Rule was turning themselves into squaws,
and spurning that nobility which is the crowning glory of the
red man's life. Their demeanor was stolid. The wise Deerfoot plainly
saw, however, that his doctrine found favor with only a few. He
made his appeal as clear and direct as he knew how, but he did
not need to be told that he was only partially successful.</p>

<p>The dramatic entrance and declaration by Chief Taggarak of the
"pangs of transformation" through which he had passed and his
emergence into the new light could not fail to be impressive and
to add to the force of what had just been said by the Shawanoe.
None the less, it had also an opposite effect in some cases. The
warriors who had accepted the leadership for years of one of the
greatest chiefs that ever swayed the destinies of the Blackfoot
people now repudiated him. He upon whom they had relied so long
to lead them in battle and of whose unquestioned bravery and prodigious
prowess all knew, had become a woman! But <em>they</em> would
remain true warriors and maintain the prestige of their tribe
as among the most aggressive in the Northwest.</p>

<p>Still Taggarak swept a number with him. Probably when he was
through with his burning appeal a fifth of those present were
under "conviction," and could be counted upon in favorable circumstances
to become believers in the faith preached by the One who spake
and taught as never man spake and taught. It may be said that
a half of that number were resolute in this decision. Their sentiments
were crystallized. The seed had been sown on good ground and was
bearing fruit.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe was tactful. For him to attempt to add anything
to the words of Taggarak would be to weaken them. They were the
climax, and silence was golden. Throughout the eloquent appeal
of the chief, Deerfoot stood with his hands idly folded behind
him, his eyes fixed upon the face of Taggarak, whose pose gave
a good view of his features, and listening in the very intentness
of his soul. When the chief had uttered his last word he gathered
his blanket about his shoulders and strode out of the Big Lodge,
looking neither to the right nor left, and again failing to notice
his wife and little boy, who sat on the ground and whom he brushed
as he passed into the open air. He did not glance behind, but
continued his dignified, deliberate stride till he was hidden
from sight among the trees beyond the cleared space.</p>

<p>Before this, Deerfoot, without speaking a word, picked his way
through the throng, who surveyed him curiously but did not stir
until he was outside. The Shawanoe glanced at George and Victor
Shelton, and by a look indicated that they were to follow him.
They did so, silent like the others, and the three returned to
their own tepee without exchanging a word on the road. They were
awed by what they had seen and heard, and respected their friend
too much to break in upon his meditations. He sat down on the
furs in his usual place and they busied themselves with what may
be considered their household duties, speaking only now and then
to each other. The afternoon was drawing to a close, and, but
for the fire that was kept burning, it would have been dark within
the lodge. They prepared their meal, but when Deerfoot was invited
to eat he shook his head, rose to his feet and passed out.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had no more time than to straighten up in the open
air when he was face to face with Mul-tal-la, who was on his way
to see him. They pressed each other's hand and the visitor said:</p>

<p>"Chief Taggarak wishes that his brother the Shawanoe shall come
to his lodge."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot goes there," replied the youth, who had been meditating
doing so. "Will my brother go with Deerfoot?"</p>

<p>"Only to the lodge. Taggarak does not wish to see <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>The two walked side by side, the hearts of both full. It was
so dark that they drew no attention to themselves. Just before
the well-known home of the chief was reached, Mul-tal-la turned
off without so much as a farewell word.</p>

<p>The war chief was expecting his visitor. He had sent his wife
and boy away in order that he might be alone with the Shawanoe.
He sat with his back against the rock, his position allowing the
firelight to show his face clearly, especially one side of it.
As he recognized his visitor he smiled and extended his hand,
after the manner of white men. Deerfoot quickened his pace and
grasped the palm and laid the other on the shoulder of the chieftain.
How different from their meeting by the lookout rock several days
before!</p>

<p>"The heart of Deerfoot is glad," said the visitor, in a low,
tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"Taggarak hears the birds sing again. There are no clouds before
the sun. He is happy, for the Great Spirit smiles upon him."</p>

<p>One of the most marvelous facts connected with the true religion,
and itself a proof of its divinity, is its complete adaptability
to every condition of life and to every degree of intelligence.
Its essentials are as readily grasped by the clodhopper as by
the profoundest scholar whose years are spent in delving into
the mysteries of science. No finite mind can fathom the mysteries
of life, of death, of sleep, of the beginning, the end, of eternity,
of the real nature of the soul and of God, how He came into existence;
nor, indeed, shall we ever comprehend in all their fullness the
simplest phenomena around us. What is the essence of color or
taste or smell? How is the word spoken by us understood by him
to whom it is addressed? When we move a hand or foot, where and
how does the action <em>begin</em>? What is the theoretical limit
of divisibility or expansion? These and scores of similar questions
have only to be asked for us to feel the utter helplessness of
our powers of understanding.</p>

<p>But to the untutored savage, shivering in his rude wigwam and
manacled by his sombre superstitions, the essential facts for
the saving of his soul become as clear as the sun in the unclouded
heavens. The man with a dwarfed intellect can see as plainly as
he whose telescope, sweeping the heavens, carries his vision to
the bounds of the universe.</p>

"All our philosophic pedants, all our sons of science know<br/>
Not a whit more than that dullard knew a million years ago."

<p>Deerfoot stayed with Taggarak for several hours. No one disturbed
them, and the chief would have kept his comforter still longer
had not the latter felt that it was better to leave the Blackfoot
to his communings with God.</p>

<p>When at last the Shawanoe emerged like a shadow from the lodge
of the chief he did not go to his own home. Instead, he turned
off, passed swiftly across the open space that had been the scene
of so many contests and games, entered the hilly section and did
not pause until he came to the place where he and Taggarak had
fought several days before.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had left his rifle at home and was alone. Folding his
arms and standing on the very spot where he had flung Taggarak
to the earth and held him at his mercy, he looked up at the faintly
moonlit sky and murmured:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot does not deserve such happiness as now fills his heart.
He thanks God for His mercy."</p>

<p>Never in all his brief but eventful career had the young Shawanoe
felt more unmistakably the presence of the Father whom he worshiped
and strove to obey. Ambition gratified, triumph obtained, earthly
love, physical or mental achievements, defeat of opponents, wealth,
pleasure, gratification of taste and longings, all these combined
cannot give to the human soul that thrilling happiness which kindles
and glows and burns into life when Conscience whispers, "Well
done!" and we know that some thought or word or deed of ours is
pleasing to God.</p>

<p>Nothing was or could be more real to Deerfoot than the cause
of the radiance that suffused his being when he came from the
lodge of the Blackfoot chieftain. Science may try to explain such
emotions as an exaltation resulting from physical causes, but
no such explanation can suffice. We feel that which we feel and
know that which we know.</p>
