<p><em>WHEN </em>Ethan Hopkins had surveyed the steam man fully,
he drew a long sigh and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Wal, naow, that's too had!'</p>

<p>'What's that?' inquired Bicknell, who had been not a little amused
at his open-mouthed amazement.</p>

<p>'Do you know I've been thinking of that thing for ten years,
ever since I went through Colt's pistol factory in Hartford, when
I was a youngster?'</p>

<p>'Did you ever think of any plan!'</p>

<p>'I never got it quite right, but I intended to do it after we
got through digging for gold. The thing was just taking shape
in my head. See here, naow, ain't you going to give a fellow a
ride?'</p>

<p>'Jis' what I wanted; shall I run it for you?'</p>

<p>'No, I see how it works; them 'ere thingumbobs and gimcracks
do it all.'</p>

<p>'Johnny, hyar, will tell yer 'bout it.'</p>

<p>The little humpback sprung nimbly down, and ran around the man,
explaining as well as he could in a few moments the manner of
controlling its movements. The Yankee felt some sensitiveness
in being instructed by such a tiny specimen, and springing into
the wagon, exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Git eout! tryin' to teach yer uncle! I knowed how the thing
would work before you were born!'</p>

<p>Perching himself on the top of the wood which was heaped up in
the wagon, the enthusiastic New Englander carefully looked over
the prairie to see that the way was clear, and was about to 'let
on steam,' when he turned toward the Irishman.</p>

<p>'Come, Mickey, git up here.'</p>

<p>'Arrah now, but I never learnt to ride the divil when I was home
in the ould country,' replied the Irishman, backing away.</p>

<p>But both Ethan and Baldy united in their persuasions, and finally
Mickey consented, although with great trepidation. He timidly
climbed upon the wagon and took his seat beside the Yankee, looking
very much as a man may be supposed to look who mounts the hearse
to attend his own funeral.</p>

<p>'When yer wants to start, jist pull that 'ere gimcrack!' said
Baldy, pointing to the crook in the rod upon which his hand rested.</p>

<p>'Git eout, naow! do you think you're goin' to teach me that has
teached school fur five year in Connecticut?'</p>

<p>There were some peculiarities about the steam man which made
him a rather unwieldy contrivance. He had a way of starting with
a jerk, unless great skill was used in letting on steam; and his
stoppage was equally sudden, from the same cause.</p>

<p>When the Irishman and Yankee had fairly ensconced themselves
on their perch, the latter looked carefully round to make sure
that no one was in the way, and then he tuned the valve, which
let on a full head of steam.</p>

<p>For a second the monster did not stir. The steam had not fairly
taken 'hold' yet; then he raised one immense spiked foot and held
it suspended in air.</p>

<p>'That's a great contrivance, ain't it?' exclaimed Ethan, contemptuously.</p>

<p>'Can't do nothin' more than lift his foot. Wait till you see
more! he's goin' to dance and skip like a lamb, or outrun any
locomotive you ever sot eyes on!'</p>

<p>'Bad luck to the loikes of yees, why d' yees go on?' exclaimed
the irate Irishman, as he leaned forward and addressed the obdurate
machine. 'Are yees tryin' to fool us, bad luck to yees?'</p>

<p>At this instant, the feet of the steam man began rising and falling
with lightning like rapidity, the wagon being jerked forward with
such sudden swiftness, that both Ethan and Mickey turned back
summersets, rolling heels over head off the vehicle to the ground,
while the monster went puffing over the prairie, and at a terrific
rate. Baldy was about to start in pursuit of it, when Johnny,
the deformed boy, restrained him.</p>

<p>'It won't run far; the steam is nearly out.'</p>

<p>'Be jibbers! but me head is caved in!' exclaimed the Irishman,
rising to his feet, rubbing his head, and looking at his hand
to see whether there was blood upon it.</p>

<p>'Jerusalem! I thought she had upset or busted her b'iler!' said
the Yankee, looking around him with a bewildered air.</p>

<p>The two spectators were laughing furiously, and they could scarcely
stand the trick which had been played upon them.</p>

<p>'Let your old machine go to blazes!' muttered Ethan. 'If it acts
that way, I don't want nothin' to do with it.'</p>

<p>In the mean time the steamer had gone rattling over the prairie,
until about a quarter of a mile distant, when it rapidly slackened,
and as quickly halted.</p>

<p>'What's the matter wid it now?' asked Mickey; 'has it got the
cramps and gi'n out?'</p>

<p>'The steam is used up!' replied the dwarf, as he hurried after
it; 'we can soon start it again!'</p>

<p>All four made all haste toward the stationary figure; but the
light frame and superior activity of little Johnny brought him
to it considerably in advance of the others. Emptying a lot of
wood from the wagon, he was busily engaged in throwing it into
his stomach when the other two came up. His eyes sparkled, as
he said:</p>

<p>'Jump up there, and I'll give you all a ride!'</p>

<p>The three clambered up and took their seats with great care,
Mickey and Ethan especially clinging as if their life depended
on it.</p>

<p>Johnny threw in the fuel until the black smoke poured in a stream
from the hat. Before leaving it, he opened two smaller doors,
at the knees, which allowed the superfluous cinders and ashes
to fall out. The water in the boiler was then examined, and found
all right. Johnny mounted in his place, and took charge.</p>

<p>'Now we are ready! hold fast!'</p>

<p>'Begorrah, if I goes I takes the wagon wid me,' replied Mickey,
as he closed his teeth and hung on like death.</p>

<p>The engineer managed the monster with rare skill, letting on
a full head of steam, and just as it made a move shutting it off,
and letting it on almost immediately, and then shutting off and
admitting it again, until it began moving at a moderate pace,
which, however, rapidly increased until it was going fully thirty
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more pleasant than this ride of a mile over
the prairie. The plain was quite level, and despite the extraordinary
speed attained, the wagon glided almost as smoothly as if running
upon a railroad. Although the air was still, the velocity created
a stiff breeze about the ears of the four seated on the top of
the wood.</p>

<p>The hight of the steam man's head carried the smoke and cinders
clear of those behind, while the wonderful machinery within, worked
with a marvelous exactness, such as was a source of continued
amazement to all except the little fellow who had himself constructed
the extraordinary mechanism. The click of the joints as they obeyed
their motive power was scarcely audible, and, when once started,
there was no unevenness at all in its progress.</p>

<p>When the party had ridden about a half-mile, Johnny described
a large circle, and finally came back to the starting, checking
the progress with the same skill that he had started it. He immediately
sprung down, examined the fire, and several points of the man,
when finding everything right, he opened his knee-caps and let
cinders and ashes drop out.</p>

<p>'How kin yeou dew that?' inquired Ethan Hopkins, peering over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>'What's to hinder?'</p>

<p>'How kin he work his legs, if they're holler that way and let
the fire down 'em?'</p>

<p>'They ain't hollow. Don't you see they are very large, and there
is plenty of room for the leg-rods, besides leaving a place for
the draft and ashes?'</p>

<p>'Wal, I swan, if that ain't rather queer. And you made it all
out of your head naow?' asked the Yankee, looking at the diminutive
inventor before him.</p>

<p>'No, I had to use a good deal of iron,' was the reply of the
youngster, with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>'You mean you got up the thing yourself?' 'Yes, sir,' was the
quiet but proud reply of the boy.</p>

<p>'Jingo and Jerusalem! but your daddy must be fond of you!' exclaimed
the enthusiastic New Englander, scanning him admiringly from head
to foot.</p>

<p>'I haven't any father.'</p>

<p>'Your mother then.'</p>

<p>'I don't know about that.'</p>

<p>'Say, you, can't yer tell a feller 'bout it?'</p>

<p>'Not now; I haven't time.'</p>

<p>As the steam horse was to rest for the present, he was 'put up.'
The engineer opened several cavities in his legs and breast, and
different parts of his body, and examined the machinery, carefully
oiling the various portions, and when he had completed, he drew
a large oil skin from the wagon, which, being spread out, covered
both it and the steam man himself. </p>
