As the great gate where I stood swung open my fifty Tharks,
headed by Tars Tarkas himself, rode in upon their mighty
thoats.  I led them to the palace walls, which I negotiated
easily without assistance.  Once inside, however, the gate
gave me considerable trouble, but I finally was rewarded
by seeing it swing upon its huge hinges, and soon my fierce
escort was riding across the gardens of the jeddak of Zodanga.
<P>
As we approached the palace I could see through the
great windows of the first floor into the brilliantly
illuminated audience chamber of Than Kosis.  The immense hall
was crowded with nobles and their women, as though some
important function was in progress.  There was not a guard
in sight without the palace, due, I presume, to the fact
that the city and palace walls were considered impregnable,
and so I came close and peered within.
<P>
At one end of the chamber, upon massive golden thrones
encrusted with diamonds, sat Than Kosis and his consort,
surrounded by officers and dignitaries of state.  Before them
stretched a broad aisle lined on either side with soldiery,
and as I looked there entered this aisle at the far end of
the hall, the head of a procession which advanced to the
foot of the throne.
<P>
First there marched four officers of the jeddak's Guard
bearing a huge salver on which reposed, upon a cushion
of scarlet silk, a great golden chain with a collar and
padlock at each end.  Directly behind these officers came
four others carrying a similar salver which supported the
magnificent ornaments of a prince and princess of the
reigning house of Zodanga.
<P>
At the foot of the throne these two parties separated
and halted, facing each other at opposite sides of the aisle.
Then came more dignitaries, and the officers of the palace
and of the army, and finally two figures entirely muffled in
scarlet silk, so that not a feature of either was discernible.
These two stopped at the foot of the throne, facing Than
Kosis.  When the balance of the procession had entered and
assumed their stations Than Kosis addressed the couple
standing before him.  I could not hear his words, but
presently two officers advanced and removed the scarlet robe
from one of the figures, and I saw that Kantos Kan had
failed in his mission, for it was Sab Than, Prince of Zodanga,
who stood revealed before me.
<P>
Than Kosis now took a set of the ornaments from one
of the salvers and placed one of the collars of gold about
his son's neck, springing the padlock fast.  After a few more
words addressed to Sab Than he turned to the other figure,
from which the officers now removed the enshrouding silks,
disclosing to my now comprehending view Dejah Thoris,
Princess of Helium.
<P>
The object of the ceremony was clear to me; in another
moment Dejah Thoris would be joined forever to the Prince
of Zodanga.  It was an impressive and beautiful ceremony,
I presume, but to me it seemed the most fiendish sight I
had ever witnessed, and as the ornaments were adjusted upon
her beautiful figure and her collar of gold swung open in
the hands of Than Kosis I raised my long-sword above my
head, and, with the heavy hilt, I shattered the glass of the
great window and sprang into the midst of the astonished
assemblage.  With a bound I was on the steps of the platform
beside Than Kosis, and as he stood riveted with surprise
I brought my long-sword down upon the golden chain
that would have bound Dejah Thoris to another.
<P>
In an instant all was confusion; a thousand drawn swords
menaced me from every quarter, and Sab Than sprang upon
me with a jeweled dagger he had drawn from his nuptial
ornaments.  I could have killed him as easily as I might a
fly, but the age-old custom of Barsoom stayed my hand,
and grasping his wrist as the dagger flew toward my heart
I held him as though in a vise and with my long-sword
pointed to the far end of the hall.
<P>
"Zodanga has fallen," I cried.  "Look!"
<P>
All eyes turned in the direction I had indicated, and
there, forging through the portals of the entranceway rode
Tars Tarkas and his fifty warriors on their great thoats.
<P>
A cry of alarm and amazement broke from the assemblage,
but no word of fear, and in a moment the soldiers and nobles
of Zodanga were hurling themselves upon the advancing Tharks.
<P>
Thrusting Sab Than headlong from the platform, I drew
Dejah Thoris to my side.  Behind the throne was a narrow
doorway and in this Than Kosis now stood facing me, with
drawn long-sword.  In an instant we were engaged, and I
found no mean antagonist.
<P>
As we circled upon the broad platform I saw Sab Than
rushing up the steps to aid his father, but, as he raised his
hand to strike, Dejah Thoris sprang before him and then
my sword found the spot that made Sab Than jeddak of
Zodanga.  As his father rolled dead upon the floor the new
jeddak tore himself free from Dejah Thoris' grasp, and again
we faced each other.  He was soon joined by a quartet of
officers, and, with my back against a golden throne, I fought
once again for Dejah Thoris.  I was hard pressed to defend
myself and yet not strike down Sab Than and, with him,
my last chance to win the woman I loved.  My blade was
swinging with the rapidity of lightning as I sought to parry
the thrusts and cuts of my opponents.  Two I had disarmed,
and one was down, when several more rushed to the aid of
their new ruler, and to avenge the death of the old.
<P>
As they advanced there were cries of "The woman!
The woman!  Strike her down; it is her plot.  Kill her!  Kill
her!"
<P>
Calling to Dejah Thoris to get behind me I worked my
way toward the little doorway back of the throne, but the
officers realized my intentions, and three of them sprang in
behind me and blocked my chances for gaining a position
where I could have defended Dejah Thoris against any army
of swordsmen.
<P>
The Tharks were having their hands full in the center of
the room, and I began to realize that nothing short of a
miracle could save Dejah Thoris and myself, when I saw
Tars Tarkas surging through the crowd of pygmies that
swarmed about him.  With one swing of his mighty longsword
he laid a dozen corpses at his feet, and so he hewed a pathway
before him until in another moment he stood upon the platform
beside me, dealing death and destruction right and left.
<P>
The bravery of the Zodangans was awe-inspiring, not one
attempted to escape, and when the fighting ceased it was
because only Tharks remained alive in the great hall, other
than Dejah Thoris and myself.
<P>
Sab Than lay dead beside his father, and the corpses of
the flower of Zodangan nobility and chivalry covered the
floor of the bloody shambles.
<P>
My first thought when the battle was over was for Kantos
Kan, and leaving Dejah Thoris in charge of Tars Tarkas I took
a dozen warriors and hastened to the dungeons beneath the
palace.  The jailers had all left to join the fighters in the
throne room, so we searched the labyrinthine prison without
opposition.
<P>
I called Kantos Kan's name aloud in each new corridor
and compartment, and finally I was rewarded by hearing a
faint response.  Guided by the sound, we soon found him
helpless in a dark recess.
<P>
He was overjoyed at seeing me, and to know the meaning
of the fight, faint echoes of which had reached his prison
cell.  He told me that the air patrol had captured him before
he reached the high tower of the palace, so that he had not
even seen Sab Than.
<P>
We discovered that it would be futile to attempt to cut
away the bars and chains which held him prisoner, so, at his
suggestion I returned to search the bodies on the floor above
for keys to open the padlocks of his cell and of his chains.
<P>
Fortunately among the first I examined I found his jailer,
and soon we had Kantos Kan with us in the throne room.
<P>
The sounds of heavy firing, mingled with shouts and
cries, came to us from the city's streets, and Tars Tarkas
hastened away to direct the fighting without.  Kantos Kan
accompanied him to act as guide, the green warriors commencing
a thorough search of the palace for other Zodangans and for loot,
and Dejah Thoris and I were left alone.
<P>
She had sunk into one of the golden thrones, and as I
turned to her she greeted me with a wan smile.
<P>
"Was there ever such a man!" she exclaimed.  "I know that
Barsoom has never before seen your like.  Can it be that all
Earth men are as you?  Alone, a stranger, hunted, threatened,
persecuted, you have done in a few short months what in
all the past ages of Barsoom no man has ever done: joined
together the wild hordes of the sea bottoms and brought them
to fight as allies of a red Martian people."
<P>
"The answer is easy, Dejah Thoris," I replied smiling.  "It
was not I who did it, it was love, love for Dejah Thoris, a
power that would work greater miracles than this you have seen."
<P>
A pretty flush overspread her face and she answered,
<P>
"You may say that now, John Carter, and I may listen, for I am free."
<P>
"And more still I have to say, ere it is again too late,"
I returned.  "I have done many strange things in my life, many
things that wiser men would not have dared, but never in my
wildest fancies have I dreamed of winning a Dejah Thoris
for myself--for never had I dreamed that in all the universe
dwelt such a woman as the Princess of Helium.  That you
are a princess does not abash me, but that you are you is
enough to make me doubt my sanity as I ask you, my princess,
to be mine."
<P>
"He does not need to be abashed who so well knew the
answer to his plea before the plea were made," she replied,
rising and placing her dear hands upon my shoulders, and so
I took her in my arms and kissed her.
<P>
And thus in the midst of a city of wild conflict, filled
with the alarms of war; with death and destruction reaping
their terrible harvest around her, did Dejah Thoris, Princess
of Helium, true daughter of Mars, the God of War, promise
herself in marriage to John Carter, Gentleman of Virginia.
<P>
