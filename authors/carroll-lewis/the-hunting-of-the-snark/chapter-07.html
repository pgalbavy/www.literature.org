               They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
               They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
               They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
               They charmed it with smiles and soap.
          <P>
               And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new<br />
               It was matter for general remark,<br />
               Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view<br />
               In his zeal to discover the Snark
          <P>
               But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,<br />
               A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh<br />
               And grabbed at the Banker, who shrieked in despair,<br />
               For he knew it was useless to fly.
          <P>
               He offered large discount--he offered a check<br />
               (Drawn "to bearer") for seven-pounds-ten:<br />
               But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck<br />
               And grabbed at the Banker again.
          <P>
               Without rest or pause--while those frumious jaws<br />
               Went savagely snapping around-<br />
               He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,<br />
               Till fainting he fell to the ground.
          <P>
               The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared<br />
               Led on by that fear-stricken yell:<br />
               And the Bellman remarked "It is just as I feared!"<br />
               And solemnly tolled on his bell.
          <P>
               He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace<br />
               The least likeness to what he had been:<br />
               While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white-<br />
               A wonderful thing to be seen!
          <P>
               To the horror of all who were present that day.<br />
               He uprose in full evening dress,<br />
               And with senseless grimaces endeavored to say<br />
               What his tongue could no longer express.
          <P>
               Down he sank in a chair--ran his hands through his hair--<br />
               And chanted in mimsiest tones<br />
               Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,<br />
               While he rattled a couple of bones.
          <P>
               "Leave him here to his fate--it is getting so late!"<br />
               The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.<br />
               "We have lost half the day. Any further delay,<br />
               And we sha'nt catch a Snark before night!"
