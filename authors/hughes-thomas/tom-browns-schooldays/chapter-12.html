<P>About six weeks after the beginning of the half, as Tom and
Arthur were sitting one night before supper beginning their
verses, Arthur suddenly stopped, and looked up, and said, &quot;Tom,
do you know anything of Martin?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Tom, taking his hand out of his back hair, and
delighted to throw his Gradus ad Parnassum on to the sofa; &quot;I
know him pretty well.  He's a very good fellow, but as mad as a
hatter.  He's called Madman, you know.  And never was such a
fellow for getting all sorts of rum things about him.  He tamed
two snakes last half, and used to carry them about in his
pocket; and I'll be bound he's got some hedgehogs and rats in
his cupboard now, and no one knows what besides.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I should like very much to know him,&quot; said Arthur; &quot;he was next
to me in the form to-day, and he'd lost his book and looked over
mine, and he seemed so kind and gentle that I liked him very
much.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, poor old Madman, he's always losing his books,&quot; said Tom,
&quot;and getting called up and floored because he hasn't got them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I like him all the better,&quot; said Arthur.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, he's great fun, I can tell you,&quot; said Tom, throwing
himself back on the sofa, and chuckling at the remembrance.  &quot;We
had such a game with him one day last half.  He had been kicking
up horrid stinks for some time in his study, till I suppose some
fellow told Mary, and she told the Doctor.  Anyhow, one day a
little before dinner, when he came down from the library, the
Doctor, instead of going home, came striding into the hall.
East and I and five or six other fellows were at the fire, and
preciously we stared, for he don't come in like that once a
year, unless it is a wet day and there's a fight in the hall.
'East,' says he, 'just come and show me Martin's study.'  'Oh,
here's a game,' whispered the rest of us; and we all cut
upstairs after the Doctor, East leading.  As we got into the New
Row, which was hardly wide enough to hold the Doctor and his
gown, click, click, click, we heard in the old Madman's den.
Then that stopped all of a sudden, and the bolts went to like
fun.  The Madman knew East's step, and thought there was going
to be a siege.</P>
<P>&quot;'It's the Doctor, Martin.  He's here and wants to see you,'
sings out East.</P>
<P>&quot;Then the bolts went back slowly, and the door opened, and there
was the old Madman standing, looking precious scared - his
jacket off, his shirt-sleeves up to his elbows, and his long
skinny arms all covered with anchors and arrows and letters,
tattooed in with gunpowder like a sailor-boy's, and a stink fit
to knock you down coming out.  'Twas all the Doctor could do to
stand his ground, and East and I, who were looking in under his
arms, held our noses tight.  The old magpie was standing on the
window-sill, all his feathers drooping, and looking disgusted
and half-poisoned.</P>
<P>&quot;'What can you be about, Martin?' says the Doctor.  'You really
mustn't go on in this way; you're a nuisance to the whole
passage.'</P>
<P>&quot;'Please, sir, I was only mixing up this powder; there isn't any
harm in it.  And the Madman seized nervously on his pestle and
mortar, to show the Doctor the harmlessness of his pursuits, and
went on pounding - click, click, click.  He hadn't given six
clicks before, puff! up went the whole into a great blaze, away
went the pestle and mortar across the study, and back we tumbled
into the passage.  The magpie fluttered down into the court,
swearing, and the Madman danced out, howling, with his fingers
in his mouth.  The Doctor caught hold of him, and called to us
to fetch some water.  'There, you silly fellow,' said he, quite
pleased, though, to find he wasn't much hurt, 'you see you don't
know the least what you're doing with all these things; and now,
mind, you must give up practising chemistry by yourself.'  Then
he took hold of his arm and looked at it, and I saw he had to
bite his lip, and his eyes twinkled; but he said, quite grave,
'Here, you see, you've been making all these foolish marks on
yourself, which you can never get out, and you'll be very sorry
for it in a year or two.  Now come down to the housekeeper's
room, and let us see if you are hurt.'  And away went the two,
and we all stayed and had a regular turn-out of the den, till
Martin came back with his hand bandaged and turned us out.
However, I'll go and see what he's after, and tell him to come
in after prayers to supper.&quot;  And away went Tom to find the boy
in question, who dwelt in a little study by himself, in New Row.</P>
<P>The aforesaid Martin, whom Arthur had taken such a fancy for,
was one of those unfortunates who were at that time of day (and
are, I fear, still) quite out of their places at a public
school.  If we knew how to use our boys, Martin would have been
seized upon and educated as a natural philosopher.  He had a
passion for birds, beasts, and insects, and knew more of them
and their habits than any one in Rugby - except perhaps the
Doctor, who knew everything.  He was also an experimental
chemist on a small scale, and had made unto himself an electric
machine, from which it was his greatest pleasure and glory to
administer small shocks to any small boys who were rash enough
to venture into his study.  And this was by no means an
adventure free from excitement; for besides the probability of a
snake dropping on to your head or twining lovingly up your leg,
or a rat getting into your breeches-pocket in search of food,
there was the animal and chemical odour to be faced, which
always hung about the den, and the chance of being blown up in
some of the many experiments which Martin was always trying,
with the most wondrous results in the shape of explosions and
smells that mortal boy ever heard of.  Of course, poor Martin,
in consequence of his pursuits, had become an Ishmaelite in the
house.  In the first place, he half-poisoned all his neighbours,
and they in turn were always on the lookout to pounce upon any
of his numerous live-stock, and drive him frantic by enticing
his pet old magpie out of his window into a neighbouring study,
and making the disreputable old bird drunk on toast soaked in
beer and sugar.  Then Martin, for his sins, inhabited a study
looking into a small court some ten feet across, the window of
which was completely commanded by those of the studies opposite
in the Sick-room Row, these latter being at a slightly higher
elevation.  East, and another boy of an equally tormenting and
ingenious turn of mind, now lived exactly opposite, and had
expended huge pains and time in the preparation of instruments
of annoyance for the behoof of Martin and his live colony.  One
morning an old basket made its appearance, suspended by a short
cord outside Martin's window, in which were deposited an amateur
nest containing four young hungry jackdaws, the pride and glory
of Martin's life, for the time being, and which he was currently
asserted to have hatched upon his own person.  Early in the
morning and late at night he was to be seen half out of window,
administering to the varied wants of his callow brood.  After
deep cogitation, East and his chum had spliced a knife on to the
end of a fishing-rod; and having watched Martin out, had, after
half an hour's severe sawing, cut the string by which the basket
was suspended, and tumbled it on to the pavement below, with
hideous remonstrance from the occupants.  Poor Martin, returning
from his short absence, collected the fragments and replaced his
brood (except one whose neck had been broken in the descent) in
their old location, suspending them this time by string and wire
twisted together, defiant of any sharp instrument which his
persecutors could command.  But, like the Russian engineers at
Sebastopol, East and his chum had an answer for every move of
the adversary, and the next day had mounted a gun in the shape
of a pea-shooter upon the ledge of their window, trained so as
to bear exactly upon the spot which Martin had to occupy while
tending his nurslings.  The moment he began to feed they began
to shoot.  In vain did the enemy himself invest in a pea-
shooter, and endeavour to answer the fire while he fed the young
birds with his other hand; his attention was divided, and his
shots flew wild, while every one of theirs told on his face and
hands, and drove him into howlings and imprecations.  He had
been driven to ensconce the nest in a corner of his already too-
well-filled den.</P>
<P>His door was barricaded by a set of ingenious bolts of his own
invention, for the sieges were frequent by the neighbours when
any unusually ambrosial odour spread itself from the den to the
neighbouring studies.  The door panels were in a normal state of
smash, but the frame of the door resisted all besiegers, and
behind it the owner carried on his varied pursuits - much in the
same state of mind, I should fancy, as a border-farmer lived in,
in the days of the moss-troopers, when his hold might be
summoned or his cattle carried off at any minute of night or
day.</P>
<P>&quot;Open, Martin, old boy; it's only I, Tom Brown.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, very well; stop a moment.&quot;  One bolt went back.  &quot;You're
sure East isn't there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no; hang it, open.&quot;  Tom gave a kick, the other bolt
creaked, and he entered the den.</P>
<P>Den indeed it was - about five feet six inches long by five
wide, and seven feet high.  About six tattered school-books, and
a few chemical books, Taxidermy, Stanley on Birds, and an odd
volume of Bewick, the latter in much better preservation,
occupied the top shelves.  The other shelves, where they had not
been cut away and used by the owner for other purposes, were
fitted up for the abiding-places of birds, beasts, and reptiles.
There was no attempt at carpet or curtain.  The table was
entirely occupied by the great work of Martin, the electric
machine, which was covered carefully with the remains of his
table-cloth.  The jackdaw cage occupied one wall; and the other
was adorned by a small hatchet, a pair of climbing irons, and
his tin candle-box, in which he was for the time being
endeavouring to raise a hopeful young family of field-mice.  As
nothing should be let to lie useless, it was well that the
candle-box was thus occupied, for candles Martin never had.  A
pound was issued to him weekly, as to the other boys; but as
candles were available capital, and easily exchangeable for
birds' eggs or young birds, Martin's pound invariably found its
way in a few hours to Howlett's the bird-fancier's, in the
Bilton road, who would give a hawk's or nightingale's egg or
young linnet in exchange.  Martin's ingenuity was therefore for
ever on the rack to supply himself with a light.  Just now he
had hit upon a grand invention, and the den was lighted by a
flaring cotton wick issuing from a ginger-beer bottle full of
some doleful composition.  When light altogether failed him,
Martin would loaf about by the fires in the passages or hall,
after the manner of Diggs, and try to do his verses or learn his
lines by the firelight.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, old boy, you haven't got any sweeter in the den this
half.  How that stuff in the bottle stinks!  Never mind; I ain't
going to stop; but you come up after prayers to our study.  You
know young Arthur.  We've got Gray's study.  We'll have a good
supper and talk about bird-nesting.&quot;</P>
<P>Martin was evidently highly pleased at the invitation, and
promised to be up without fail.</P>
<P>As soon as prayers were over, and the sixth and fifth form boys
had withdrawn to the aristocratic seclusion of their own room,
and the rest, or democracy, had sat down to their supper in the
hall, Tom and Arthur, having secured their allowances of bread
and cheese, started on their feet to catch the eye of the
prepostor of the week, who remained in charge during supper,
walking up and down the hall.  He happened to be an easy-going
fellow, so they got a pleasant nod to their &quot;Please may I go
out?&quot; and away they scrambled to prepare for Martin a sumptuous
banquet.  This Tom had insisted on, for he was in great delight
on the occasion, the reason of which delight must be expounded.
The fact was that this was the first attempt at a friendship of
his own which Arthur had made, and Tom hailed it as a grand
step.  The ease with which he himself became hail-fellow-well-
met with anybody, and blundered into and out of twenty
friendships a half-year, made him sometimes sorry and sometimes
angry at Arthur's reserve and loneliness.  True, Arthur was
always pleasant, and even jolly, with any boys who came with Tom
to their study; but Tom felt that it was only through him, as it
were, that his chum associated with others, and that but for him
Arthur would have been dwelling in a wilderness.  This increased
his consciousness of responsibility; and though he hadn't
reasoned it out and made it clear to himself yet somehow he knew
that this responsibility, this trust which he had taken on him
without thinking about it, head over heels in fact, was the
centre and turning-point of his school-life, that which was to
make him or mar him, his appointed work and trial for the time
being.  And Tom was becoming a new boy, though with frequent
tumbles in the dirt and perpetual hard battle with himself, and
was daily growing in manfulness and thoughtfulness, as every
high-couraged and well-principled boy must, when he finds
himself for the first time consciously at grips with self and
the devil.  Already he could turn almost without a sigh from the
School-gates, from which had just scampered off East and three
or four others of his own particular set, bound for some jolly
lark not quite according to law, and involving probably a row
with louts, keepers, or farm-labourers, the skipping dinner or
calling-over, some of Phoebe Jennings's beer, and a very
possible flogging at the end of all as a relish.  He had quite
got over the stage in which he would grumble to himself - &quot;Well,
hang it, it's very hard of the Doctor to have saddled me with
Arthur.  Why couldn't he have chummed him with Fogey, or
Thomkin, or any of the fellows who never do anything but walk
round the close, and finish their copies the first day they're
set?&quot;  But although all this was past, he longed, and felt that
he was right in longing, for more time for the legitimate
pastimes of cricket, fives, bathing, and fishing, within bounds,
in which Arthur could not yet be his companion; and he felt that
when the &quot;young un&quot; (as he now generally called him) had found a
pursuit and some other friend for himself, he should be able to
give more time to the education of his own body with a clear
conscience.</P>
<P>And now what he so wished for had come to pass; he almost hailed
it as a special providence (as indeed it was, but not for the
reasons he gave for it - what providences are?) that Arthur
should have singled out Martin of all fellows for a friend.
&quot;The old Madman is the very fellow,&quot; thought he; &quot;he will take
him scrambling over half the country after birds' eggs and
flowers, make him run and swim and climb like an Indian, and not
teach him a word of anything bad, or keep him from his lessons.
What luck!&quot;  And so, with more than his usual heartiness, he
dived into his cupboard, and hauled out an old knuckle-bone of
ham, and two or three bottles of beer, together with the solemn
pewter only used on state occasions; while Arthur, equally
elated at the easy accomplishment of his first act of volition
in the joint establishment, produced from his side a bottle of
pickles and a pot of jam, and cleared the table.  In a minute or
two the noise of the boys coming up from supper was heard, and
Martin knocked and was admitted, bearing his bread and cheese;
and the three fell to with hearty good-will upon the viands,
talking faster than they ate, for all shyness disappeared in a
moment before Tom's bottled-beer and hospitable ways.  &quot;Here's
Arthur, a regular young town-mouse, with a natural taste for the
woods, Martin, longing to break his neck climbing trees, and
with a passion for young snakes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I say,&quot; sputtered out Martin eagerly, &quot;will you come to-
morrow, both of you, to Caldecott's Spinney then? for I know of
a kestrel's nest, up a fir-tree. I can't get at it without help;
and, Brown, you can climb against any one.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh yes, do let us go,&quot; said Arthur; &quot;I never saw a hawk's nest
nor a hawk's egg.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You just come down to my study, then, and I'll show you five
sorts,&quot; said Martin.</P>
<P>&quot;Ay, the old Madman has got the best collection in the house,
out and out,&quot; said Tom; and then Martin, warming with
unaccustomed good cheer and the chance of a convert, launched
out into a proposed bird-nesting campaign, betraying all manner
of important secrets - a golden-crested wren's nest near
Butlin's Mound, a moor-hen who was sitting on nine eggs in a
pond down the Barby road, and a kingfisher's nest in a corner of
the old canal above Brownsover Mill.  He had heard, he said,
that no one had ever got a kingfisher's nest out perfect, and
that the British Museum, or the Government, or somebody, had
offered 100 pounds to any one who could bring them a nest and eggs not
damaged.  In the middle of which astounding announcement, to
which the others were listening with open ears, and already
considering the application of the 100 pounds, a knock came to the
door, and East's voice was heard craving admittance.</P>
<P>&quot;There's Harry,&quot; said Tom; &quot;we'll let him in.  I'll keep him
steady, Martin.  I thought the old boy would smell out the
supper.&quot;</P>
<P>The fact was, that Tom's heart had already smitten him for not
asking his fidus Achates to the feast, although only an
extempore affair; and though prudence and the desire to get
Martin and Arthur together alone at first had overcome his
scruples, he was now heartily glad to open the door, broach
another bottle of beer, and hand over the old ham-knuckle to the
searching of his old friend's pocket-knife.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, you greedy vagabonds,&quot; said East, with his mouth full, &quot;I
knew there was something going on when I saw you cut off out of
hall so quick with your suppers.  What a stunning tap, Tom!  You
are a wunner for bottling the swipes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've had practice enough for the sixth in my time, and it's
hard if I haven't picked up a wrinkle or two for my own
benefit.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, old Madman, and how goes the bird-nesting campaign?
How's Howlett?  I expect the young rooks'll be out in another
fortnight, and then my turn comes.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There'll be no young rooks fit for pies for a month yet; shows
how much you know about it,&quot; rejoined Martin, who, though very
good friends with East, regarded him with considerable suspicion
for his propensity to practical jokes.</P>
<P>&quot;Scud knows nothing and cares for nothing but grub and
mischief,&quot; said Tom; &quot;but young rook pie, specially when you've
had to climb for them, is very pretty eating.  - However, I say,
Scud, we're all going after a hawk's nest to-morrow, in
Caldecott's Spinney; and if you'll come and behave yourself,
we'll have a stunning climb.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And a bathe in Aganippe.  Hooray!  I'm your man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no; no bathing in Aganippe; that's where our betters go.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, well, never mind.  I'm for the hawk's nest, and anything
that turns up.&quot;</P>
<P>And the bottled-beer being finished, and his hunger appeased,
East departed to his study, &quot;that sneak Jones,&quot; as he informed
them, who had just got into the sixth, and occupied the next
study, having instituted a nightly visitation upon East and his
chum, to their no small discomfort.</P>
<P>When he was gone Martin rose to follow, but Tom stopped him.
&quot;No one goes near New Row,&quot; said he, &quot;so you may just as well
stop here and do your verses, and then we'll have some more
talk.  We'll be no end quiet.  Besides, no prepostor comes here
now.  We haven't been visited once this half.&quot;</P>
<P>So the table was cleared, the cloth restored, and the three fell
to work with Gradus and dictionary upon the morning's vulgus.</P>
<P>They were three very fair examples of the way in which such
tasks were done at Rugby, in the consulship of Plancus.  And
doubtless the method is little changed, for there is nothing new
under the sun, especially at schools.</P>
<P>Now be it known unto all you boys who are at schools which do
not rejoice in the time-honoured institution of the vulgus
(commonly supposed to have been established by William of
Wykeham at Winchester, and imported to Rugby by Arnold more for
the sake of the lines which were learnt by heart with it than
for its own intrinsic value, as I've always understood), that it
is a short exercise in Greek or Latin verse, on a given subject,
the minimum number of lines being fixed for each form.</P>
<P>The master of the form gave out at fourth lesson on the previous
day the subject for next morning's vulgus, and at first lesson
each boy had to bring his vulgus ready to be looked over; and
with the vulgus, a certain number of lines from one of the Latin
or Greek poets then being construed in the form had to be got by
heart.  The master at first lesson called up each boy in the
form in order, and put him on in the lines.  If he couldn't say
them, or seem to say them, by reading them off the master's or
some other boy's book who stood near, he was sent back, and went
below all the boys who did so say or seem to say them; but in
either case his vulgus was looked over by the master, who gave
and entered in his book, to the credit or discredit of the boy,
so many marks as the composition merited.  At Rugby vulgus and
lines were the first lesson every other day in the week, on
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; and as there were thirty-
eight weeks in the school year, it is obvious to the meanest
capacity that the master of each form had to set one hundred and
fourteen subjects every year, two hundred and twenty-eight every
two years, and so on.  Now, to persons of moderate invention
this was a considerable task, and human nature being prone to
repeat itself, it will not be wondered that the masters gave the
same subjects sometimes over again after a certain lapse of
time.  To meet and rebuke this bad habit of the masters, the
schoolboy mind, with its accustomed ingenuity, had invented an
elaborate system of tradition.  Almost every boy kept his own
vulgus written out in a book, and these books were duly handed
down from boy to boy, till (if the tradition has gone on till
now) I suppose the popular boys, in whose hands bequeathed
vulgus-books have accumulated, are prepared with three or four
vulguses on any subject in heaven or earth, or in &quot;more worlds
than one,&quot; which an unfortunate master can pitch upon.  At any
rate, such lucky fellows had generally one for themselves and
one for a friend in my time.  The only objection to the
traditionary method of doing your vulguses was the risk that the
successions might have become confused, and so that you and
another follower of traditions should show up the same identical
vulgus some fine morning; in which case, when it happened,
considerable grief was the result.  But when did such risk
hinder boys or men from short cuts and pleasant paths?</P>
<P>Now in the study that night Tom was the upholder of the
traditionary method of vulgus doing.  He carefully produced two
large vulgus-books, and began diving into them, and picking out
a line here, and an ending there (tags, as they were vulgarly
called), till he had gotten all that he thought he could make
fit.  He then proceeded to patch his tags together with the help
of his Gradus, producing an incongruous and feeble result of
eight elegiac lines, the minimum quantity for his form, and
finishing up with two highly moral lines extra, making ten in
all, which he cribbed entire from one of his books, beginning &quot;O
genus humanum,&quot; and which he himself must have used a dozen
times before, whenever an unfortunate or wicked hero, of
whatever nation or language under the sun, was the subject.
Indeed he began to have great doubts whether the master wouldn't
remember them, and so only throw them in as extra lines, because
in any case they would call off attention from the other tags,
and if detected, being extra lines, he wouldn't be sent back to
do more in their place, while if they passed muster again he
would get marks for them.</P>
<P>The second method, pursued by Martin, may be called the dogged
or prosaic method.  He, no more than Tom, took any pleasure in
the task, but having no old vulgus-books of his own, or any
one's else, could not follow the traditionary method, for which
too, as Tom remarked, he hadn't the genius.  Martin then
proceeded to write down eight lines in English, of the most
matter-of-fact kind, the first that came into his head; and to
convert these, line by line, by main force of Gradus and
dictionary into Latin that would scan.  This was all he cared
for - to produce eight lines with no false quantities or
concords:  whether the words were apt, or what the sense was,
mattered nothing; and as the article was all new, not a line
beyond the minimum did the followers of the dogged method ever
produce.</P>
<P>The third, or artistic method, was Arthur's.  He considered
first what point in the character or event which was the subject
could most neatly be brought out within the limits of a vulgus,
trying always to get his idea into the eight lines, but not
binding himself to ten or even twelve lines if he couldn't do
this.  He then set to work as much as possible without Gradus or
other help, to clothe his idea in appropriate Latin or Greek,
and would not be satisfied till he had polished it well up with
the aptest and most poetic words and phrases he could get at.</P>
<P>A fourth method, indeed, was used in the school, but of too
simple a kind to require a comment.  It may be called the
vicarious method, obtained amongst big boys of lazy or bullying
habits, and consisted simply in making clever boys whom they
could thrash do their whole vulgus for them, and construe it to
them afterwards; which latter is a method not to be encouraged,
and which I strongly advise you all not to practise.  Of the
others, you will find the traditionary most troublesome, unless
you can steal your vulguses whole (experto crede), and that the
artistic method pays the best both in marks and other ways.</P>
<P>The vulguses being finished by nine o'clock, and Martin having
rejoiced above measure in the abundance of light, and of Gradus
and dictionary, and other conveniences almost unknown to him for
getting through the work, and having been pressed by Arthur to
come and do his verses there whenever he liked, the three boys
went down to Martin's den, and Arthur was initiated into the
lore of birds' eggs, to his great delight.  The exquisite
colouring and forms astonished and charmed him, who had scarcely
ever seen any but a hen's egg or an ostrich's, and by the time
he was lugged away to bed he had learned the names of at least
twenty sorts, and dreamed of the glorious perils of tree-
climbing, and that he had found a roc's egg in the island as big
as Sinbad's, and clouded like a tit-lark's, in blowing which
Martin and he had nearly been drowned in the yolk.</P>
