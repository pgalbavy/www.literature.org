<p>The summer during which Nicholas Ribsam attained the age of twelve
years was viewed with dismal forebodings by many people, for the
reason that a celebrated weather prophet had foretold that it
would be unusually rainy, cold, and wet.</p>

<p>As a consequence, it proved to be the driest known in years.
Days, weeks, and even months passed without a drop of rain falling
from the brassy sky, and the fine powdery dust permeated everywhere.
The weather prophet lost caste, but he persisted in announcing
rain, knowing that he had only to stick to it long enough to hit
it in the course of time.</p>

<p>As the autumn approached and the drought continued over a vast
extent of territory, the forest fires raged in different parts
of the country. All day and night immense volumes of smoke and
vapor hung over the land, and the appearance of the sun was so
peculiar as to cause alarm on the part of those who were superstitious.</p>

<p>There came a "dark day," like that of the 19th of May, 1780,
which overspread New England, and was most marked in Massachusetts.
The Connecticut Legislature was in session, and the belief was
so universal that the last awful day had come that the motion
was made to adjourn. Then, as the graphic Quaker poet says:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
All eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport.<br/>
He rose, slow cleaving with his steady voice<br/>
The intolerable hush. "This well may be<br/>
The Day of Judgment which the world awaits;<br/>
But be it so or not, I only know<br/>
My present duty, and my Lord's command<br/>
To occupy till He come. So at the post<br/>
Where He has set me in His providence,<br/>
I choose, for one, to meet Him face to face&mdash;<br/>
No faithless servant frightened from my task,<br/>
But ready when the Lord of the harvest calls;<br/>
And, therefore, with all reverence, I would say,<br/>
Let God do His work, we will see to ours.<br/>
Bring in the candles." And they brought them in.

<p>Tuesday, September 7, 1881, was a day very similar to the memorable
one of a century ago. A strange, greenish-yellow pall overspread
the heavens, and so darkened the light of the sun that lamps and
gas were lighted, schools and factories closed, and multitudes
of the ignorant and superstitious believed that the Day of Judgment
had come.</p>

<p>Everything looked changed and unnatural. The faces of people
on the streets were ghastly, the gas jets in the stores, instead
of showing yellow, were as white and clear as the electric lights,
and thousands of the sect known as Second Adventists gathered
in their places of worship and confidently awaited the appearing
of the Lord.</p>

<p>The "dark day" was more wonderful in the country. The leaves
and withering foliage assumed a most singular tint of green, changing,
like that of the grass, to a brownish hue; fowls went to roost,
and the animal creation must have been greatly mystified by a
phenomenon such as they had never witnessed before.</p>

<p>A curious feature of this luminous haze was that it cast no shadow.
It was as light under the trees as away from them, the whole unnatural
appearance of things most likely being due to the immense forest
fires which were raging in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>It was during the summer, I repeat, in which Nick Ribsam reached
the age of twelve years, that so many forest fires raged, and
it was in the autumn of the same year that he saw the famous dark
day, so similar to that of September, 1881; in fact, it could
not have resembled it more closely, for I may as well state it
was that very day to which I refer.</p>

<p>"Nick," said his father, on that September morning, addressing
his boy in Dutch, "I promised to pay James Bradley one hundred
dollars to-day before three o'clock."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," responded the boy, who knew that the debt would be
paid on time.</p>

<p>"He was to come here to our house to get it, but he sent me word
last night that he would be much obliged if I would send it to
him at Martin's store in Dunbarton, as he is obliged to be there
all day. I like to accommodate any one, and I will therefore send
you to take it to him."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I am ready to go whenever you want me to do so."</p>

<p>Dunbarton, as has been stated, was a village nine miles away,
and the principal grocery store in the place was kept by Jacob
Martin. It was there that Nick was to take the one hundred dollars
which was to be handed to James Bradley, to whom his father owed
it.</p>

<p>It was like a holiday for Nick to take such a drive, and he was
glad when his father made known his wishes.</p>

<p>"Harness up the mare to the fall-top and drive over; you ought
to be back early in the afternoon."</p>

<p>"I will, if nothing happens to prevent."</p>

<p>Just then rosy-faced Nellie came out to feed the chickens. As
the fowls flocked toward her, some perching on her shoulders,
head, and wherever they could find a resting-place, she scattered
the golden grains of corn with a deft and lavish hand.</p>

<p>Her father looked at the cheeks as red as apples and the eyes
glowing with health, and, dropping into English, said with a sigh
and shake of the head:</p>

<p>"I dinks dot Nellie looks some bale."</p>

<p>He meant to say pale, and Nick laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't think she is very sick; she ate more breakfast than
I did this morning."</p>

<p>"Dot ish so, but I dinks dot I leafes her go mit you to Dunbarton,
if she can shpare her moder."</p>

<p>Mr. Ribsam meant all right, and when his wishes were made known
to Nellie she was delighted; her mother was glad to give her the
privilege of an excursion, for she was an industrious little girl,
and, furthermore, there were some purchases to be made both for
the mother and daughter, which Nellie could attend to better than
could any boy, no matter how intelligent.</p>

<p>The famous "dark day" of 1881 prevailed principally in New England
and the State of New York; but it was noticed further south, especially
in some of the wooded portions of Pennsylvania, though in the
larger part of the commonwealth it attracted no great attention.</p>

<p>It was between seven and eight o'clock when the four-wheeled
carriage with the single seat, and which vehicle is known as a
"fall top" in some sections of the country, was driven from the
humble home of the Ribsams, with the brother and sister seated
in it.</p>

<p>As they approached the scene of Nellie's adventure with the bear,
they naturally talked about it, while Nick again related his own
thrilling experience, when the animal was shot by Mrs. Fowler,
just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>Shark Creek had suffered so much from the long continued drought
that it was no more than one fourth its usual volume; but the
pond below was not much diminished in size, as it did not flow
off except when at a certain height.</p>

<p>The brother and sister did not speak of the peculiar appearance
of the atmosphere until nearly to the bridge. There had been a
great deal of smoke floating over the country for several days,
but there was nothing to cause any fear on the part of those who
lived near the large stretches of timber.</p>

<p>As the darkness increased, however, Nick said:</p>

<p>"It must be caused by the thick smoke; but I don't think it will
last, and when we reach Dunbarton that will be the end of it."</p>

<p>"It won't make any difference," said Nellie, "unless it gets
so dark we can't see the way."</p>

<p>"No fear of that."</p>

<p>But when at last they emerged from the woods, and shortly after
entered the village, the impressive gloom was deeper than ever.
The villagers were awed by the unnatural appearance of nature,
and were standing in groups looking at the sky and talking in
undertones.</p>

<p>Many were frightened, and not a few hurried to their homes, terrified
with the belief that the last awful day, when the heavens shall
be burned up as a scroll and the elements shall melt with fervent
heat, was at hand.</p>

<p>Ah, had it been the final Judgment Day, how many of us would
have had our houses in order for the coming of the angel of the
Lord?</p>

<p>Nick Ribsam sprang out of the carriage, helped Nellie to alight,
and went into the store of Mr. Martin, where James Bradley was
found awaiting him. The money was handed over, a receipt taken,
the horse fed, during which Nellie attended to the errand on which
she was sent, and, an hour later, the mare was given water, and
brother and sister started homeward, little dreaming of what awaited
them.</p>
