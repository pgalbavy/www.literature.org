MEANWHILE the new-baptized, who yet remained<BR>
At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen<BR>
Him whom they heard so late expressly called<BR>
Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,<BR>
And on that high authority had believed,<BR>
And with him talked, and with him lodged--I mean<BR>
Andrew and Simon, famous after known,<BR>
With others, though in Holy Writ not named--<BR>
Now missing him, their joy so lately found,<BR>
So lately found and so abruptly gone,<BR>
Began to doubt, and doubted many days,<BR>
And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.<BR>
Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,<BR>
And for a time caught up to God, as once<BR>
Moses was in the Mount and missing long,<BR>
And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels<BR>
Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.<BR>
Therefore, as those young prophets then with care<BR>
Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these<BR>
Nigh to Bethabara--in Jericho<BR>
The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old,<BR>
Machaerus, and each town or city walled<BR>
On this side the broad lake Genezaret,<BR>
Or in Peraea--but returned in vain.<BR>
Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,<BR>
Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,<BR>
Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),<BR>
Close in a cottage low together got,<BR>
Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Alas, from what high hope to what relapse<BR>
Unlooked for are we fallen!  Our eyes beheld<BR>
Messiah certainly now come, so long<BR>
Expected of our fathers; we have heard<BR>
His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth.<BR>
'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;<BR>
The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:'<BR>
Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned<BR>
Into perplexity and new amaze.<BR>
For whither is he gone? what accident<BR>
Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire<BR>
After appearance, and again prolong<BR>
Our expectation?  God of Israel,<BR>
Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.<BR>
Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress<BR>
Thy Chosen, to what highth their power unjust<BR>
They have exalted, and behind them cast<BR>
All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate<BR>
Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!<BR>
But let us wait; thus far He hath performed--<BR>
Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him<BR>
By his great Prophet pointed at and shown<BR>
In public, and with him we have conversed.<BR>
Let us be glad of this, and all our fears<BR>
Lay on his providence; He will not fail,<BR>
Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall--<BR>
Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:<BR>
Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return."<BR>
<BR>
  Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume<BR>
To find whom at the first they found unsought.<BR>
But to his mother Mary, when she saw<BR>
Others returned from baptism, not her Son,<BR>
Nor left at Jordan tidings of him none,<BR>
Within her breast though calm, her breast though pure,<BR>
Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised<BR>
Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Oh, what avails me now that honour high,<BR>
To have conceived of God, or that salute,<BR>
'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!'<BR>
While I to sorrows am no less advanced,<BR>
And fears as eminent above the lot<BR>
Of other women, by the birth I bore:<BR>
In such a season born, when scarce a shed<BR>
Could be obtained to shelter him or me<BR>
From the bleak air?  A stable was our warmth,<BR>
A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly<BR>
Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king<BR>
Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled<BR>
With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.<BR>
From Egypt home returned, in Nazareth<BR>
Hath been our dwelling many years; his life<BR>
Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,<BR>
Little suspicious to any king.  But now,<BR>
Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,<BR>
By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,<BR>
Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice,<BR>
I looked for some great change.  To honour? no;<BR>
But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,<BR>
That to the fall and rising he should be<BR>
Of many in Israel, and to a sign<BR>
Spoken against--that through my very soul<BR>
A sword shall pierce.  This is my favoured lot,<BR>
My exaltation to afflictions high!<BR>
Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!<BR>
I will not argue that, nor will repine.<BR>
But where delays he now?  Some great intent<BR>
Conceals him.  When twelve years he scarce had seen,<BR>
I lost him, but so found as well I saw<BR>
He could not lose himself, but went about<BR>
His Father's business.  What he meant I mused--<BR>
Since understand; much more his absence now<BR>
Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.<BR>
But I to wait with patience am inured;<BR>
My heart hath been a storehouse long of things<BR>
And sayings laid up, pretending strange events."<BR>
<BR>
  Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind<BR>
Recalling what remarkably had passed<BR>
Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts<BR>
Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:<BR>
The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,<BR>
Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,<BR>
Into himself descended, and at once<BR>
All his great work to come before him set--<BR>
How to begin, how to accomplish best<BR>
His end of being on Earth, and mission high.<BR>
For Satan, with sly preface to return,<BR>
Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone<BR>
Up to the middle region of thick air,<BR>
Where all his Potentates in council sate.<BR>
There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,<BR>
Solicitous and blank, he thus began:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones--<BR>
Daemonian Spirits now, from the element<BR>
Each of his reign allotted, rightlier called<BR>
Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath<BR>
(So may we hold our place and these mild seats<BR>
Without new trouble!)--such an enemy<BR>
Is risen to invade us, who no less<BR>
Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.<BR>
I, as I undertook, and with the vote<BR>
Consenting in full frequence was impowered,<BR>
Have found him, viewed him, tasted him; but find<BR>
Far other labour to be undergone<BR>
Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,<BR>
Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell,<BR>
However to this Man inferior far--<BR>
If he be Man by mother's side, at least<BR>
With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,<BR>
Perfections absolute, graces divine,<BR>
And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.<BR>
Therefore I am returned, lest confidence<BR>
Of my success with Eve in Paradise<BR>
Deceive ye to persuasion over-sure<BR>
Of like succeeding here.  I summon all<BR>
Rather to be in readiness with hand<BR>
Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst<BR>
Thought none my equal, now be overmatched."<BR>
<BR>
  So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all<BR>
With clamour was assured their utmost aid<BR>
At his command; when from amidst them rose<BR>
Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,<BR>
The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,<BR>
The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Set women in his eye and in his walk,<BR>
Among daughters of men the fairest found.<BR>
Many are in each region passing fair<BR>
As the noon sky, more like to goddesses<BR>
Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,<BR>
Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues<BR>
Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild<BR>
And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,<BR>
Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw<BR>
Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.<BR>
Such object hath the power to soften and tame<BR>
Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,<BR>
Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,<BR>
Draw out with credulous desire, and lead<BR>
At will the manliest, resolutest breast,<BR>
As the magnetic hardest iron draws.<BR>
Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart<BR>
Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,<BR>
And made him bow, to the gods of his wives."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:--<BR>
"Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st<BR>
All others by thyself.  Because of old<BR>
Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring<BR>
Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,<BR>
None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.<BR>
Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,<BR>
False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,<BR>
Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,<BR>
And coupled with them, and begot a race.<BR>
Have we not seen, or by relation heard,<BR>
In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st,<BR>
In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,<BR>
In valley or green meadow, to waylay<BR>
Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,<BR>
Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,<BR>
Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more<BR>
Too long--then lay'st thy scapes on names adored,<BR>
Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,<BR>
Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan?  But these haunts<BR>
Delight not all.  Among the sons of men<BR>
How many have with a smile made small account<BR>
Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned<BR>
All her assaults, on worthier things intent!<BR>
Remember that Pellean conqueror,<BR>
A youth, how all the beauties of the East<BR>
He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;<BR>
How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,<BR>
In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.<BR>
For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full<BR>
Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond<BR>
Higher design than to enjoy his state;<BR>
Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.<BR>
But he whom we attempt is wiser far<BR>
Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,<BR>
Made and set wholly on the accomplishment<BR>
Of greatest things.  What woman will you find,<BR>
Though of this age the wonder and the fame,<BR>
On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye<BR>
Of fond desire?  Or should she, confident,<BR>
As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne,<BR>
Descend with all her winning charms begirt<BR>
To enamour, as the zone of Venus once<BR>
Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),<BR>
How would one look from his majestic brow,<BR>
Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill,<BR>
Discountenance her despised, and put to rout<BR>
All her array, her female pride deject,<BR>
Or turn to reverent awe!  For Beauty stands<BR>
In the admiration only of weak minds<BR>
Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes<BR>
Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,<BR>
At every sudden slighting quite abashed.<BR>
Therefore with manlier objects we must try<BR>
His constancy--with such as have more shew<BR>
Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise<BR>
(Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);<BR>
Or that which only seems to satisfy<BR>
Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.<BR>
And now I know he hungers, where no food<BR>
Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:<BR>
The rest commit to me; I shall let pass<BR>
No advantage, and his strength as oft assay."<BR>
<BR>
  He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;<BR>
Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band<BR>
Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,<BR>
To be at hand and at his beck appear,<BR>
If cause were to unfold some active scene<BR>
Of various persons, each to know his part;<BR>
Then to the desert takes with these his flight,<BR>
Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,<BR>
After forty days' fasting, had remained,<BR>
Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:--<BR>
<BR>
  "Where will this end?  Four times ten days I have passed<BR>
Wandering this woody maze, and human food<BR>
Nor tasted, nor had appetite.  That fast<BR>
To virtue I impute not, or count part<BR>
Of what I suffer here.  If nature need not,<BR>
Or God support nature without repast,<BR>
Though needing, what praise is it to endure?<BR>
But now I feel I hunger; which declares<BR>
Nature hath need of what she asks.  Yet God<BR>
Can satisfy that need some other way,<BR>
Though hunger still remain.  So it remain<BR>
Without this body's wasting, I content me,<BR>
And from the sting of famine fear no harm;<BR>
Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed<BR>
Me hungering more to do my Father's will."<BR>
<BR>
  It was the hour of night, when thus the Son<BR>
Communed in silent walk, then laid him down<BR>
Under the hospitable covert nigh<BR>
Of trees thick interwoven.  There he slept,<BR>
And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,<BR>
Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet.<BR>
Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,<BR>
And saw the ravens with their horny beaks<BR>
Food to Elijah bringing even and morn--<BR>
Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;<BR>
He saw the Prophet also, how he fled<BR>
Into the desert, and how there he slept<BR>
Under a juniper--then how, awaked,<BR>
He found his supper on the coals prepared,<BR>
And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,<BR>
And eat the second time after repose,<BR>
The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:<BR>
Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,<BR>
Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.<BR>
Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark<BR>
Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry<BR>
The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.<BR>
As lightly from his grassy couch up rose<BR>
Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;<BR>
Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.<BR>
Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,<BR>
From whose high top to ken the prospect round,<BR>
If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;<BR>
But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw--<BR>
Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,<BR>
With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.<BR>
Thither he bent his way, determined there<BR>
To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade<BR>
High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,<BR>
That opened in the midst a woody scene;<BR>
Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),<BR>
And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt<BR>
Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs.  He viewed it round;<BR>
When suddenly a man before him stood,<BR>
Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,<BR>
As one in city or court or palace bred,<BR>
And with fair speech these words to him addressed:--<BR>
<BR>
  "With granted leave officious I return,<BR>
But much more wonder that the Son of God<BR>
In this wild solitude so long should bide,<BR>
Of all things destitute, and, well I know,<BR>
Not without hunger.  Others of some note,<BR>
As story tells, have trod this wilderness:<BR>
The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,<BR>
Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief<BR>
By a providing Angel; all the race<BR>
Of Israel here had famished, had not God<BR>
Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,<BR>
Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed<BR>
Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.<BR>
Of thee those forty days none hath regard,<BR>
Forty and more deserted here indeed."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus Jesus:--"What conclud'st thou hence?<BR>
They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none."<BR>
<BR>
  "How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied.<BR>
"Tell me, if food were now before thee set,<BR>
Wouldst thou not eat?"  "Thereafter as I like<BR>
the giver," answered Jesus.  "Why should that<BR>
Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend.<BR>
"Hast thou not right to all created things?<BR>
Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee<BR>
Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,<BR>
But tender all their power?  Nor mention I<BR>
Meats by the law unclean, or offered first<BR>
To idols--those young Daniel could refuse;<BR>
Nor proffered by an enemy--though who<BR>
Would scruple that, with want oppressed?  Behold,<BR>
Nature ashamed, or, better to express,<BR>
Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed<BR>
From all the elements her choicest store,<BR>
To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord<BR>
With honour.  Only deign to sit and eat."<BR>
<BR>
  He spake no dream; for, as his words had end,<BR>
Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,<BR>
In ample space under the broadest shade,<BR>
A table richly spread in regal mode,<BR>
With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort<BR>
And savour--beasts of chase, or fowl of game,<BR>
In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,<BR>
Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,<BR>
Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,<BR>
And exquisitest name, for which was drained<BR>
Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.<BR>
Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,<BR>
Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!<BR>
And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,<BR>
That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood<BR>
Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue<BR>
Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,<BR>
Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,<BR>
Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades<BR>
With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn,<BR>
And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed<BR>
Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since<BR>
Of faery damsels met in forest wide<BR>
By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,<BR>
Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.<BR>
And all the while harmonious airs were heard<BR>
Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds<BR>
Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned<BR>
From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells.<BR>
Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now<BR>
His invitation earnestly renewed:--<BR>
<BR>
  "What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?<BR>
These are not fruits forbidden; no interdict<BR>
Defends the touching of these viands pure;<BR>
Their taste no knowledge works, at least of evil,<BR>
But life preserves, destroys life's enemy,<BR>
Hunger, with sweet restorative delight.<BR>
All these are Spirits of air, and woods, and springs,<BR>
Thy gentle ministers, who come to pay<BR>
Thee homage, and acknowledge thee their Lord.<BR>
What doubt'st thou, Son of God?  Sit down and eat."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus Jesus temperately replied:--<BR>
"Said'st thou not that to all things I had right?<BR>
And who withholds my power that right to use?<BR>
Shall I receive by gift what of my own,<BR>
When and where likes me best, I can command?<BR>
I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou,<BR>
Command a table in this wilderness,<BR>
And call swift flights of Angels ministrant,<BR>
Arrayed in glory, on my cup to attend:<BR>
Why shouldst thou, then, obtrude this diligence<BR>
In vain, where no acceptance it can find?<BR>
And with my hunger what hast thou to do?<BR>
Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,<BR>
And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:--<BR>
"That I have also power to give thou seest;<BR>
If of that power I bring thee voluntary<BR>
What I might have bestowed on whom I pleased,<BR>
And rather opportunely in this place<BR>
Chose to impart to thy apparent need,<BR>
Why shouldst thou not accept it?  But I see<BR>
What I can do or offer is suspect.<BR>
Of these things others quickly will dispose,<BR>
Whose pains have earned the far-fet spoil."  With that<BR>
Both table and provision vanished quite,<BR>
With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard;<BR>
Only the importune Tempter still remained,<BR>
And with these words his temptation pursued:--<BR>
<BR>
  "By hunger, that each other creature tames,<BR>
Thou art not to be harmed, therefore not moved;<BR>
Thy temperance, invincible besides,<BR>
For no allurement yields to appetite;<BR>
And all thy heart is set on high designs,<BR>
High actions.  But wherewith to be achieved?<BR>
Great acts require great means of enterprise;<BR>
Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth,<BR>
A carpenter thy father known, thyself<BR>
Bred up in poverty and straits at home,<BR>
Lost in a desert here and hunger-bit.<BR>
Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire<BR>
To greatness? whence authority deriv'st?<BR>
What followers, what retinue canst thou gain,<BR>
Or at thy heels the dizzy multitude,<BR>
Longer than thou canst feed them on thy cost?<BR>
Money brings honour, friends, conquest, and realms.<BR>
What raised Antipater the Edomite,<BR>
And his son Herod placed on Juda's throne,<BR>
Thy throne, but gold, that got him puissant friends?<BR>
Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,<BR>
Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure heap--<BR>
Not difficult, if thou hearken to me.<BR>
Riches are mine, fortune is in my hand;<BR>
They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain,<BR>
While virtue, valour, wisdom, sit in want."<BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus Jesus patiently replied:--<BR>
"Yet wealth without these three is impotent<BR>
To gain dominion, or to keep it gained--<BR>
Witness those ancient empires of the earth,<BR>
In highth of all their flowing wealth dissolved;<BR>
But men endued with these have oft attained,<BR>
In lowest poverty, to highest deeds--<BR>
Gideon, and Jephtha, and the shepherd lad<BR>
Whose offspring on the throne of Juda sate<BR>
So many ages, and shall yet regain<BR>
That seat, and reign in Israel without end.<BR>
Among the Heathen (for throughout the world<BR>
To me is not unknown what hath been done<BR>
Worthy of memorial) canst thou not remember<BR>
Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus?<BR>
For I esteem those names of men so poor,<BR>
Who could do mighty things, and could contemn<BR>
Riches, though offered from the hand of kings.<BR>
And what in me seems wanting but that I<BR>
May also in this poverty as soon<BR>
Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more?<BR>
Extol not riches, then, the toil of fools,<BR>
The wise man's cumbrance, if not snare; more apt<BR>
To slacken virtue and abate her edge<BR>
Than prompt her to do aught may merit praise.<BR>
What if with like aversion I reject<BR>
Riches and realms!  Yet not for that a crown,<BR>
Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns,<BR>
Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights,<BR>
To him who wears the regal diadem,<BR>
When on his shoulders each man's burden lies;<BR>
For therein stands the office of a king,<BR>
His honour, virtue, merit, and chief praise,<BR>
That for the public all this weight he bears.<BR>
Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules<BR>
Passions, desires, and fears, is more a king--<BR>
Which every wise and virtuous man attains;<BR>
And who attains not, ill aspires to rule<BR>
Cities of men, or headstrong multitudes,<BR>
Subject himself to anarchy within,<BR>
Or lawless passions in him, which he serves.<BR>
But to guide nations in the way of truth<BR>
By saving doctrine, and from error lead<BR>
To know, and, knowing, worship God aright,<BR>
Is yet more kingly.  This attracts the soul,<BR>
Governs the inner man, the nobler part;<BR>
That other o'er the body only reigns,<BR>
And oft by force--which to a generous mind<BR>
So reigning can be no sincere delight.<BR>
Besides, to give a kingdom hath been thought<BR>
Greater and nobler done, and to lay down<BR>
Far more magnanimous, than to assume.<BR>
Riches are needless, then, both for themselves,<BR>
And for thy reason why they should be sought--<BR>
To gain a sceptre, oftest better missed."<BR>
