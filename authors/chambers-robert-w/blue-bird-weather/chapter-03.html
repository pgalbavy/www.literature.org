<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Blue-bird weather continued. Every day for a week Marche and
Molly Herold put out for Foam Island under summer skies, and with
a soft wind filling the sail; and in all the water-world there
was no visible sign of winter, save the dead reeds on muddy islands
and the far and wintry menace of the Atlantic crashing icily beyond
the eastern dunes.</p>

<p>Few ducks and no geese or swans came to the blind. There was
nothing for them to do except to talk together or sit dozing in
the sun. And, imperceptibly, between them the elements of a pretty
intimacy unfolded like spring buds on unfamiliar branches; but
what they might develop into he did not know, and she had not
even considered.</p>

<p>She had a quaint capacity for sleeping in the sunshine while
he was away on the island prowling hopefully after black ducks.
And one morning, when he returned to find her asleep at her post,
a bunch of widgeon left the stools right under her nose before
he had a chance to shoot.</p>

<p>She did not awake. The sun fell warmly upon her, searching the
perfections of the childlike face and throat, gilding the palm
of one little, sun-tanned hand lying, partly open, on her knee.
A spring-like wind stirred a single strand of bright hair; lips
slightly parted, she lay there, face to the sky, and Marche thought
that he had never looked upon anything in all the world more pure
and peaceful.</p>

<p>At noon the girl had not awakened. But something in John B. Marche
had. He looked in horrified surprise at the decoys, then looked
at Molly Herold; then he gazed in profound astonishment at Uncle
Dudley, who made a cryptic remark to the wife of his bosom, and
then tipped upside down.</p>

<p>Marche examined the sky and water so carefully that he did not
see them; then, sideways, and with an increasing sensation of
consternation, he looked again at the sleeping girl.</p>

<p>His was not even a friendly gaze, now; there was more than dawning
alarm in it&mdash;an irritated curiosity which grew more intense as
the seconds throbbed out, absurdly timed by a most remarkable
obligato from his heart.</p>

<p>He gazed stonily upon this stranger into whose life he had drifted
only a week before, whose slumbers he felt that he was now unwarrantedly
invading with a mental presumption that scared him; and yet, as
often as he looked elsewhere, he looked back at her again, confused
by the slowly dawning recognition of a fascination which he was
utterly powerless to check or even control.</p>

<p>One thing was already certain; he wanted to know her, to learn
from her own lips intimately about herself, about her thoughts,
her desires, her tastes, her aspirations&mdash;even her slightest fancies.</p>

<p>Absorbed, charmed by her quiet breathing, fascinated into immobility,
he sat there gazing at her, trying to reconcile the steadily strengthening
desire to know her with what he already knew of her&mdash;of this sleeping
stranger, this shabby child of a poor man, dressed in the boots
and shooting coat of that wretchedly poor man&mdash;his own superintendent,
a sick man whom he had never even seen.</p>

<p>What manner of man could her father be&mdash;this man Herold&mdash;to have
a child of this sort, this finely molded, fine-grained, delicate,
exquisitely made girl, lying asleep here in a wind-stirred blind,
with the Creator's own honest sun searching out and making triumphant
a beauty such as his wise and city-worn eyes had never encountered,
even under the mercies of softened candlelight.</p>

<p>An imbecile repetition of speech kept recurring and even stirring
his lips, "She'd make them all look like thirty cents." And he
colored painfully at the crudeness of his obsessing thoughts,
angrily, after a moment, shaking them from him.</p>

<p>A cartridge rolled from the shelf and splashed into the pit water;
the girl unclosed her gray eyes, met his gaze, smiled dreamily;
then, flushing a little, sat up straight.</p>

<p>"Fifteen widgeon went off when I returned to the blind," he said,
unsmiling.</p>

<p>"I <em>beg</em> your pardon. I am &mdash;I am terribly sorry,"
she stammered, with a vivid blush of confusion.</p>

<p>But the first smile from her unclosing eyes had already done
damage enough; the blush merely disorganized a little more what
was already chaos in a young man's mind.</p>

<p>"Has&mdash;has anything else come in to the stools?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p>"No," he said, relenting.</p>

<p>But he was wrong. Something <em>had</em> come into the blind&mdash;a
winged, fluttering thing, out of the empyrean&mdash;and even Uncle
Dudley had not seen or heard it, and never a honk or a quack warned
anybody, or heralded the unseen coming of the winged thing.</p>

<p>Marche sat staring out across the water.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>am so very sorry," repeated the girl, in a low voice.
"Are you offended with me?"</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her, and spoke steadily enough: "Of course
I'm not. I was glad you had a nap. There has been nothing doing&mdash;except
those stupid widgeon&mdash;not a feather stirring."</p>

<p>"Then you are not angry with me?"</p>

<p>"Why, you absurd girl!" he said, laughing and stretching out
one hand to her.</p>

<p>Into her face flashed an exquisite smile; daintily she reached
out and dropped her hand into his. They exchanged a friendly shake,
still smiling.</p>

<p>"All the same," she said, "it was horrid of me. And I think I
boasted to you about my knowledge of a bayman's duties."</p>

<p>"You are all right," he said, "a clean shot, a thoroughbred.
I ask no better comrade than you. I never again shall have such
a comrade."</p>

<p>"But &mdash;I am your bayman, not your comrade," she exclaimed,
forcing a little laugh. "You'll have better guides than I, Mr.
Marche."</p>

<p>"Do you reject the equal alliance I offer, Miss Herold?"</p>

<p>"I?" She flushed. "It is very kind of you to put it that way.
But I <em>am</em> only your guide&mdash;but it is pleasant to have
you speak that way."</p>

<p>"What way?"</p>

<p>"The way you spoke about&mdash;your bayman's daughter."</p>

<p>He said, smilingly cool on the surface, but in a chaotic, almost
idiotic inward condition: "I've sat here for days, wishing all
the while that I might really know you. Would you care to let
me, Miss Herold?"</p>

<p>"Know me?" she repeated. "I don't think I understand."</p>

<p>"Could you and your father and brother regard me as a guest&mdash;as
a friend visiting the family?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because," he said, "I'm the same kind of a man that you are
a girl and that your brother is a boy. Why, you know it, don't
you? I know it. I knew it as soon as I heard you speak, and when
your brother came into the room that first night with his Latin
book, and when I saw your mother's picture. So I know what your
father must be. Am I not right?"</p>

<p>She lifted her proud little head and looked at him. "We are what
you think us," she said.</p>

<p>"Then let us stand in that relation, Miss Herold. Will you?"</p>

<p>She looked at him, perplexed, gray eyes clear and thoughtful.
"Do you mean that you really want me for a friend?" she asked
calmly, but her sensitive lip quivered a little.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do men make personal friends among their employees? Do they?
I ask because I don't know."</p>

<p>"What was your father before he came here?" he inquired bluntly.</p>

<p>She looked up, startled, then the color came slowly back to her
cheeks. "Isn't that a little impertinent, Mr. Marche?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens! Yes, of course it is!" he exclaimed, turning very
red. "Will you forgive me? I didn't mean to be rude or anything
like it! I merely meant that whatever reverses have happened to
bring such a girl as you down into this God-forsaken place have
not altered what you were and what you are. <em>Can</em> you forgive
me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll tell you something. I <em>wanted</em> to be a little
more significant to you than merely a paid guide. So did Jim.
We&mdash;it is rather lonely for us. You are the first real man who
has come into our lives in five years. Do you understand, Mr.
Marche?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you do? We would like to feel that we could talk
to you &mdash;Jim would. It is pleasant to hear a man from the
real world speaking. Not that the people here are unkind, only"&mdash;she
looked up at him almost wistfully&mdash;"we <em>are</em> like you,
Mr. Marche&mdash;and we feel starved, sometimes."</p>

<p>He did not trust himself to speak, even to look at her, just
at the moment. Not heretofore sentimental, but always impressionable,
he was young enough to understand, wise enough not to misunderstand.</p>

<p>After a while, leaning back in the blind, he began, almost casually,
talking about things in that Northern world which had once been
hers, assuming their common interest in matters purely local,
in details, of metropolitan affairs, in the changing physiognomy
of the monstrous city, its superficial aspects, its complex phases.</p>

<p>Timidly, at first, she ventured a question now and then, and
after a while, as her reserve melted, she asked more boldly, and
even offered her own comments on men and things, so that, for
the first time, he had a glimpse of her mind at work&mdash;brief, charming
surprises, momentary views of a young girl's eager intelligence,
visions of her sad and solitary self, more guessed at than revealed
in anything she said or left unsaid.</p>

<p>And now they were talking together with free and unfeigned interest
and pleasure, scarcely turning for a glance at the water or sky,
save when old Uncle Dudley made insulting remarks to some slow-drifting
gull or soaring bird of prey.</p>

<p>All the pent-up and natural enthusiasm of years was fairly bubbling
to her lips; all the long-suppressed necessity of speech with
one of her own kind who was not of her own kin.</p>

<p>It seemed as though they conversed and exchanged views on every
topic which concerned heaven and earth, flashing from one subject
to another which had nothing at all to do with anything yet discussed.</p>

<p>Out around them the flat leagues of water turned glassy and calm
as a millpond; the ducks and geese were asleep on their stools;
even old Uncle Dudley stood sentinel, with one leg buried in the
downy plumage of his belly, but his weather eye remained brilliantly
open to any stir in the blue vault above.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "They ate their luncheon there together."]</p>

<p>They ate their luncheon there together, he serving her with hot
coffee from the vacuum bottle, she plying him with sandwiches.</p>

<p>And now, to her beauty was added an adorable friendliness and
confidence, free from the slightest taint of self-consciousness
or the least blemish of coquetry. Intelligent, yet modest to the
verge of shyness, eager yet reserved, warm hearted yet charmingly
impersonal with him, he realized that she was finding, with him,
only the happiness of speech with mankind in the abstract. And
so she poured out to him her heart, long stifled in the abyss
of her isolation; and, gazing into his eyes, she was gazing merely
toward all that was bright and happy and youthful and responsive,
and he was its symbol, God-sent from those busy haunts of men
which already, to her, had become only memories of a blessed vision.</p>

<p>And all the while the undercurrent of his own thoughts ran on
unceasingly: "What can I do for her? I am falling in love&mdash;in
love, surely, hopelessly. What can I do for her&mdash;for her brother&mdash;her
father? I am falling in love&mdash;in love&mdash;in love."</p>

<p>The long, still, sunny afternoon slipped away. Gradually the
water turned to pearl, inlaid with gold, then with glowing rose.
And now, far to the north, the first thrilling clangor of wild
geese, high in the blue, came to their ears, and they shrank apart
and lay back, staring upward. Nearer, nearer, came the sky trumpets,
answering faintly each to each&mdash;nearer, nearer, till high over
the blind swept the misty wedge; and old Uncle Dudley flapped
his wings and stretched his neck, calling up to his wild comrades
of earthly delights unnumbered here under the shadow of death.
And every wild goose answered him, and the decoys flapped and
clamored a siren welcome; but the flying wedge glided onward through
the blue.</p>

<p>"They've begun to move," whispered the girl. "But, oh, dear!
It is blue-bird weather. Hark! Do you hear the swans? I can hear
swans coming out of the north!"</p>

<p>Marche could not yet hear them, but the tethered swans and geese
heard, and a magnificent chorus rose from the water. Then, far
away as fairyland, faintly out of the sky, came a new murmur&mdash;not
the martial clangor of wild geese, but something wilder, more
exquisitely unearthly&mdash;nearer, nearer, enrapturing its weird,
celestial beauty. And now, through the blue, with great, snowy
wings slowly beating, the swans passed over like angels; and like
angels passing, hailing each other as they winged their way, drifting
on broad, white pinions, they called, each to the other in their
sweet, unreal voices, gossiping, garrulous, high in the sky. And
far away they floated on until they became only a silver ribbon
undulating against the azure; and even then Marche could hear
the soft tumult of their calling: Heu! Heu! Hiou! Hiou-oo! until
sound and snowy flecks vanished together in mid-heaven.</p>

<p>Again, coming from the far north, the trumpets of the sky squadron
were sounding; they passed, wedge after wedge, sometimes in steady
formation, sometimes like a wavering band of witches, and again
in shifting battalions, sternly officered, passing through intricate
aërial maneuvers, and greeted by Uncle Dudley and the other decoys
with wild beseeching mixed with applause.</p>

<p>Snowy, angelic companies of swans came alternately with the geese;
then a whimpering, whispering flight of wild ducks, water-fowl
in thousands and tens of thousands, rushing onward through the
aërial lanes.</p>

<p>But none came to the blind. Occasionally a wedge of geese wavered,
irresolute at the frantic persuasions of Uncle Dudley, but their
leader always dragged them back to their course, and the sagging,
hesitating ranks passed on.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in a nearer flight of swans, some long-necked, snowy
creature would bend its head to look curiously down at the tethered
swans on the water, but always they continued on, settling some
two miles south of Foaming Shoals, until there was half a mile
of wild swans afloat there, looking like a long, low bank of snow,
touched with faintest pink by the glow of the westering sun.</p>
