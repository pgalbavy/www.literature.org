<p><em>THIRTEEN</em></p>

<p>I had a sense of walking very fast&mdash;almost of taking flight&mdash;down
a long dim corridor, and of a door that opened into an immense
room. All that I remember of it, as I saw it then, was a number
of pastel portraits of weak, vacuous individuals, in dulled, gilt,
oval frames. The heads stood out from the panelling and stared
at me from between ringlets, from under powdered hair, simpering,
or contemptuous with the expression that must have prevailed in
the <em>monde</em> of the time before the Revolution. At a great
distance, bent over account&mdash;books and pink cheques on the flap
of an escritoire, sat my aunt, very small, very grey, very intent
on her work.</p>

<p>The people who built these rooms must have had some property
of the presence to make them bulk large&mdash;if they ever really did
so&mdash;in the eyes of dependents, of lackeys. Perhaps it was their
sense of ownership that gave them the necessary prestige. My aunt,
who was only a temporary occupant, certainly had none of it. Bent
intently over her accounts, peering through her spectacles at
columns of figures, she was nothing but a little old woman alone
in an immense room. It seemed impossible that she could really
have any family pride, any pride of any sort. She looked round
at me over her spectacles, across her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah ... Etchingham," she said. She seemed to be trying to carry
herself back to England, to the England of her land-agent and
her select visiting list. Here she was no more superior than if
we had been on a desert island. I wanted to enlighten her as to
the woman she was sheltering&mdash;wanted to very badly; but a necessity
for introducing the matter seemed to arise as she gradually stiffened
into assertiveness.</p>

<p>"My dear aunt," I said, "the woman...." The alien nature of the
theme grew suddenly formidable. She looked at me arousedly.</p>

<p>"You got my note then," she said. "But I don't think a woman
<em>can</em> have brought it. I have given such strict orders.
They have such strange ideas here, though. And Madame&mdash;the <em>portière</em>&mdash;is
an old retainer of M. de Luynes, I haven't much influence over
her. It is absurd, but...." It seems that the old lady in the
lodge made a point of carrying letters that went by hand. She
had an eye for gratuities&mdash;and the police, I should say, were
concerned. They make a good deal of use of that sort of person
in that neighbourhood of infinitesimal and unceasing plotting.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that," I said, "but the woman who calls herself
my sister...."</p>

<p>"My dear nephew," she interrupted, with tranquil force, as if
she were taking an arranged line, "I cannot &mdash;I absolutely
cannot be worried with your quarrels with your sister. As I said
to you in my note of this morning, when you are in this town you
must consider this house your home. It is almost insulting of
you to go to an inn. I am told it is even ... quite an unfit place
that you are stopping at&mdash;for a member of our family."</p>

<p>I maintained for a few seconds a silence of astonishment.</p>

<p>"But," I returned to the charge, "the matter is one of importance.
You must understand that she...."</p>

<p>My aunt stiffened and froze. It was as if I had committed some
flagrant sin against etiquette.</p>

<p>"If I am satisfied as to her behaviour," she said, "I think that
you might be." She paused as if she were satisfied that she had
set me hopelessly in the wrong.</p>

<p>"I don't withdraw my invitation," she said. "You must understand
I <em>wish</em> you to come here. But your quarrels you and she
must settle. On those terms...."</p>

<p>She had the air of conferring an immense favour, as if she believed
that I had, all my life through, been waiting for her invitation
to come within the pale. As for me, I felt a certain relief at
having the carrying out of my duty made impossible for me. I did
not <em>want</em> to tell my aunt and thus to break things off
definitely and for good. Something would have happened; the air
might have cleared as it clears after a storm; I should have learnt
where I stood. But I was afraid of the knowledge. Light in these
dark places might reveal an abyss at my feet. I wanted to let
things slide.</p>

<p>My aunt had returned to her accounts, the accounts which were
the cog-wheels that kept running the smooth course of the Etchingham
estates. She seemed to wish to indicate that I counted for not
very much in the scheme of things as she saw it.</p>

<p>"I should like to make your better acquaintance," she said, with
her head still averted, "there are reasons...." It came suddenly
into my head that she had an idea of testamentary dispositions,
that she felt she was breaking up, that I had my rights. I didn't
much care for the thing, but the idea of being the heir of Etchingham
was&mdash;well, was an idea. It would make me more possible to my pseudo-sister.
It would be, as it were, a starting-point, would make me potentially
a somebody of her sort of ideal. Moreover, I should be under the
same roof, near her, with her sometimes. One asks so little more
than that, that it seemed almost half the battle. I began to consider
phrases of thanks and acceptance and then uttered them.</p>

<p>I never quite understood the bearings of that scene; never quite
whether my aunt really knew that my sister was not my sister.
She was a wonderfully clever woman of the unscrupulous order,
with a <em>sang-froid</em> and self-possession well calculated
to let her cut short any inconvenient revelations. It was as if
she had had long practice in the art, though I cannot say what
occasion she can have had for its practice&mdash;perhaps for the confounding
of wavering avowers of Dissent at home.</p>

<p>I used to think that she knew, if not all, at least a portion;
that the weight that undoubtedly was upon her mind was nothing
else but that. She broke up, was breaking up from day to day,
and I can think of no other reason. She had the air of being disintegrated,
like a mineral under an immense weight&mdash;quartz in a crushing mill;
of being dulled and numbed as if she were under the influence
of narcotics.</p>

<p>There is little enough wonder, if she actually carried that imponderable
secret about with her. I used to look at her sometimes, and wonder
if she, too, saw the oncoming of the inevitable. She was limited
enough in her ideas, but not too stupid to take that in if it
presented itself. Indeed they have that sort of idea rather grimly
before them all the time&mdash;that class.</p>

<p>It must have been that that was daily, and little by little,
pressing down her eyelids and deepening the quivering lines of
her impenetrable face. She had a certain solitary grandeur, the
pathos attaching to the last of a race, of a type; the air of
waiting for the deluge, of listening for an inevitable sound&mdash;the
sound of oncoming waters.</p>

<p>It was weird, the time that I spent in that house&mdash;more than
weird&mdash;deadening. It had an extraordinary effect on me&mdash;an effect
that my "sister," perhaps, had carefully calculated. She made
pretensions of that sort later on; said that she had been breaking
me in to perform my allotted task in the bringing on of the inevitable.</p>

<p>I have nowhere come across such an intense solitude as there
was there, a solitude that threw one so absolutely upon one's
self and into one's self. I used to sit working in one of those
tall, panelled rooms, very high up in the air. I was writing at
the series of articles for the <em>Bi-Monthly</em>, for Polehampton.
I was to get the atmosphere of Paris, you remember. It was rather
extraordinary, that process. Up there I seemed to be as much isolated
from Paris as if I had been in&mdash;well, in Hampton Court. It was
almost impossible to write; I had things to think about: preoccupations,
jealousies. It was true I had a living to make, but that seemed
to have lost its engrossingness as a pursuit, or at least to have
suspended it.</p>

<p>The panels of the room seemed to act as a sounding-board, the
belly of an immense 'cello. There were never any noises in the
house, only whispers coming from an immense distance&mdash;as when
one drops stones down an unfathomable well and hears ages afterward
the faint sound of disturbed waters. When I look back at that
time I figure myself as forever sitting with uplifted pen, waiting
for a word that would not come, and that I did not much care about
getting. The panels of the room would creak sympathetically to
the opening of the entrance-door of the house, the faintest of
creaks; people would cross the immense hall to the room in which
they plotted; would cross leisurely, with laughter and rustling
of garments that after a long time reached my ears in whispers.
Then I should have an access of mad jealousy. I wanted to be part
of her life, but I could not stand that Salon of suspicious conspirators.
What could I do there? Stand and look at them, conscious that
they all dropped their voices instinctively when I came near them?</p>

<p>That was the general tone of that space of time, but, of course,
it was not always that. I used to emerge now and then to breakfast
sympathetically with my aunt, sometimes to sit through a meal
with the two of them. I danced attendance on them singly; paid
depressing calls with my aunt; calls on the people in the Faubourg;
people without any individuality other than a kind of desiccation,
the shrivelled appearance and point of view of a dried pippin.
In revenge, they had names that startled one, names that recalled
the generals and <em>flaneurs</em> of an impossibly distant time;
names that could hardly have had any existence outside the memoirs
of Madame de Sévigné, the names of people that could hardly have
been fitted to do anything more vigorous than be reflected in
the mirrors of the <em>Salle des Glaces</em>. I was so absolutely
depressed, so absolutely in a state of suspended animation, that
I seemed to conform exactly to my aunt's ideas of what was desirable
in me as an attendant on her at these functions. I used to stand
behind chairs and talk, like a good young man, to the assorted
<em>Pères</em> and <em>Abbés</em> who were generally present.</p>

<p>And then I used to go home and get the atmospheres of these people.
I must have done it abominably badly, for the notes that brought
Polehampton's cheques were accompanied by the bravos of that gentleman
and the assurances that Miss Polehampton liked my work&mdash;liked
it very much.</p>

<p>I suppose I exhibited myself in the capacity of the man who knew&mdash;who
could let you into a thing or two. After all, anyone could write
about students' balls and the lakes in the Bois, but it took <em>someone</em>
to write "with knowledge" of the interiors of the barred houses
in the Rue de l'Université.</p>

<p>Then, too, I attended the more showy entertainments with my sister.
I had by now become so used to hearing her styled "your sister"
that the epithet had the quality of a name. She was "mademoiselle
votre soeur," as she might have been Mlle. Patience or Hope, without
having anything of the named quality. What she did at the entertainments,
the charitable bazaars, the dismal dances, the impossibly bad
concerts, I have no idea. She must have had some purpose, for
she did nothing without. I myself descended into fulfilling the
functions of a rudimentarily developed chaperon&mdash;functions similar
in importance to those performed by the eyes of a mole. I had
the maddest of accesses of jealousy if she talked to a man&mdash;and
<em>such</em> men&mdash;or danced with one. And then I was forever
screwing my courage up and feeling it die away. We used to drive
about in a coupe, a thing that shut us inexorably together, but
which quite as inexorably destroyed all opportunities for what
one calls making love. In smooth streets its motion was too glib,
on the <em>pavé</em> it rattled too abominably. I wanted to make
love to her&mdash;oh, immensely, but I was never in the mood, or the
opportunity was never forthcoming. I used to have the wildest
fits of irritation; not of madness or of depression, but of simple
wildness at the continual recurrence of small obstacles. I couldn't
read, couldn't bring myself to it. I used to sit and look dazedly
at the English newspapers&mdash;at any newspaper but the <em>Hour</em>.
De Mersch had, for the moment, disappeared. There were troubles
in his elective grand duchy&mdash;he had, indeed, contrived to make
himself unpopular with the electors, excessively unpopular. I
used to read piquant articles about his embroglio in an American
paper that devoted itself to matters of the sort. All sorts of
international difficulties were to arise if de Mersch were ejected.
There was some other obscure prince of a rival house, Prussian
or Russian, who had desires for the degree of royalty that sat
so heavily on de Mersch. Indeed, I think there were two rival
princes, each waiting with portmanteaux packed and manifestos
in their breast pockets, ready to pass de Mersch's frontiers.</p>

<p>The grievances of his subjects&mdash;so the Paris-American <em>Gazette</em>
said&mdash;were intimately connected with matters of finance, and de
Mersch's personal finances and his grand ducal were inextricably
mixed up with the wild-cat schemes with which he was seeking to
make a fortune large enough to enable him to laugh at half a dozen
elective grand duchies. Indeed, de Mersch's own portmanteau was
reported to be packed against the day when British support of
his Greenland schemes would let him afford to laugh at his cantankerous
Diet.</p>

<p>The thing interested me so little that I never quite mastered
the details of it. I wished the man no good, but so long as he
kept out of my way I was not going to hate him actively. Finally
the affairs of Holstein-Launewitz ceased to occupy the papers&mdash;the
thing was arranged and the Russian and Prussian princes unpacked
their portmanteaux, and, I suppose, consigned their manifestos
to the flames, or adapted them to the needs of other principalities.
De Mersch's affairs ceded their space in the public prints to
the topic of the dearness of money. Somebody, somewhere, was said
to be up to something. I used to try to read the articles, to
master the details, because I disliked finding a whole field of
thought of which I knew absolutely nothing. I used to read about
the great discount houses and other things that conveyed absolutely
nothing to my mind. I only gathered that the said great houses
were having a very bad time, and that everybody else was having
a very much worse.</p>

<p>One day, indeed, the matter was brought home to me by the receipt
from Polehampton of bills instead of my usual cheques. I had a
good deal of trouble in cashing the things; indeed, people seemed
to look askance at them. I consulted my aunt on the subject, at
breakfast. It was the sort of thing that interested the woman
of business in her, and we were always short of topics of conversation.</p>

<p>We breakfasted in rather a small room, as rooms went there; my
aunt sitting at the head of the table, with an early morning air
of being <em>en famille</em> that she wore at no other time of
day. It was not a matter of garments, for she was not the woman
to wear a <em>peignoir</em>; but lay, I supposed, in her manner,
which did not begin to assume frigidity until several watches
of the day had passed.</p>

<p>I handed her Polehampton's bills and explained that I was at
a loss to turn them to account; that I even had only the very
haziest of ideas as to their meaning. Holding the forlorn papers
in her hand, she began to lecture me on the duty of acquiring
the rudiments of what she called "business habits."</p>

<p>"Of course you do not require to master details to any considerable
extent," she said, "but I always have held that it is one of the
duties of a...."</p>

<p>She interrupted herself as my sister came into the room; looked
at her, and then held out the papers in her hand. The things quivered
a little; the hand must have quivered too.</p>

<p>"You are going to Halderschrodt's?" she said, interrogatively.
"You could get him to negotiate these for Etchingham?"</p>

<p>Miss Granger looked at the papers negligently.</p>

<p>"I am going this afternoon," she answered. "Etchingham can come...."
She suddenly turned to me: "So your friend is getting shaky,"
she said.</p>

<p>"It means that?" I asked. "But I've heard that he has done the
same sort of thing before."</p>

<p>"He must have been shaky before," she said, "but I daresay Halderschrodt...."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's hardly worth while bothering that personage about such
a sum," I interrupted. Halderschrodt, in those days, was a name
that suggested no dealings in any sum less than a million.</p>

<p>"My dear Etchingham," my aunt interrupted in a shocked tone,
"it is quite worth his while to oblige us...."</p>

<p>"I didn't know," I said.</p>

<p>That afternoon we drove to Halderschrodt's private office, a
sumptuous&mdash;that is the <em>mot juste</em>&mdash;suite of rooms on the
first floor of the house next to the Duc de Mersch's <em>Sans
Souci</em>. I sat on a plush-bottomed gilded chair, whilst my
pseudo-sister transacted her business in an adjoining room&mdash;a
room exactly corresponding with that within which de Mersch had
lurked whilst the lady was warning me against him. A clerk came
after awhile, carried me off into an enclosure, where my bill
was discounted by another, and then reconducted me to my plush
chair. I did not occupy it, as it happened. A meagre, very tall
Alsatian was holding the door open for the exit of my sister.
He said nothing at all, but stood slightly inclined as she passed
him. I caught a glimpse of a red, long face, very tired eyes,
and hair of almost startling whiteness&mdash;the white hair of a comparatively
young man, without any lustre of any sort&mdash;a dead white, like
that of snow. I remember that white hair with a feeling of horror,
whilst I have almost forgotten the features of the great Baron
de Halderschrodt.</p>

<p>I had still some of the feeling of having been in contact with
a personality of the most colossal significance as we went down
the red carpet of the broad white marble stairs. With one foot
on the lowest step, the figure of a perfectly clothed, perfectly
groomed man was standing looking upward at our descent. I had
thought so little of him that the sight of the Duc de Mersch's
face hardly suggested any train of emotions. It lit up with an
expression of pleasure.</p>

<p>"You," he said.</p>

<p>She stood looking down upon him from the altitude of two steps,
looking with intolerable passivity.</p>

<p>"So you use the common stairs," she said, "one had the idea that
you communicated with these people through a private door." He
laughed uneasily, looking askance at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ..." he said.</p>

<p>She moved a little to one side to pass him in her descent.</p>

<p>"So things have arranged themselves&mdash;<em>là bas</em>," she said,
referring, I supposed, to the elective grand duchy.</p>

<p>"Oh, it was like a miracle," he answered, "and I owed a great
deal&mdash;a great deal&mdash;to your hints...."</p>

<p>"You must tell me all about it to-night," she said.</p>

<p>De Mersch's face had an extraordinary quality that I seemed to
notice in all the faces around me&mdash;a quality of the flesh that
seemed to lose all luminosity, of the eyes that seemed forever
to have a tendency to seek the ground, to avoid the sight of the
world. When he brightened to answer her it was as if with effort.
It seemed as if a weight were on the mind of the whole world&mdash;a
preoccupation that I shared without understanding. She herself,
a certain absent-mindedness apart, seemed the only one that was
entirely unaffected.</p>

<p>As we sat side by side in the little carriage, she said suddenly:</p>

<p>"They are coming to the end of their tether, you see." I shrank
away from her a little&mdash;but I did not see and did not want to
see. I said so. It even seemed to me that de Mersch having got
over the troubles <em>là bas</em>, was taking a new lease of life.</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em> think," I said, "a little time ago that ..."</p>

<p>The wheels of the coupe suddenly began to rattle abominably over
the cobbles of a narrow street. It was impossible to talk, and
I was thrown back upon myself. I found that I was in a temper&mdash;in
an abominable temper. The sudden sight of that man, her method
of greeting him, the intimacy that the scene revealed ... the
whole thing had upset me. Of late, for want of any alarms, in
spite of groundlessness I had had the impression that I was the
integral part of her life. It was not a logical idea, but strictly
a habit of mind that had grown up in the desolation of my solitude.</p>

<p>We passed into one of the larger boulevards, and the thing ran
silently.</p>

<p>"That de Mersch was crumbling up," she suddenly completed my
unfinished sentence; "oh, that was only a grumble&mdash;premonitory.
But it won't take long now. I have been putting on the screw.
Halderschrodt will ... I suppose he will commit suicide, in a
day or two. And then the&mdash;the fun will begin."</p>

<p>I didn't answer. The thing made no impression&mdash;no mental impression
at all.</p>
