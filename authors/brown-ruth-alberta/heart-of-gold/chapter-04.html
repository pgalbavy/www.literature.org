<p>The school year came to a close, the days grew hotter, the nights
brought no relief, and Dr. Coates, still a daily visitor at the
big house, began to look grave again.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the President, feeling intuitively that something
was wrong. "She is not doing as well?"</p>

<p>"No." The old doctor shook his head.</p>

<p>"The heat?"</p>

<p>"Possibly,&mdash;possibly. But she had stopped mending before the
hot wave struck us."</p>

<p>"Then you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it means that operation I mentioned when she was
first hurt."</p>

<p>The President turned on his heel and strode over to the window
where he stood looking out into the warm, breathless evening twilight.
When he wheeled about again, the doctor saw that the strong face
was set and white, and great beads of perspiration stood on his
forehead. "I &mdash;I trust you will not be offended, doctor,"
he said with a catch in his voice, "but I should like the opinion
of other physicians&mdash;specialists-before taking that step. You
say&mdash;it is&mdash;a very delicate operation?"</p>

<p>"Yes," the doctor admitted. "But I am afraid now that it is her
only chance. However, it is perfectly agreeable to me if you wish
to consult other authorities. I myself would be glad to hear the
opinions of specialists."</p>

<p>So it happened that a few days later a strange doctor bent over
the white bed in the Flag Room, and when he had punched and poked
to his heart's content and Peace's abject misery, another physician
took his place.</p>

<p>"Dr. Coates said I hadn't cracked a rib," moaned the unhappy
victim tearfully, as she saw the second unfamiliar face above
her, "but I'll bet that man who just went out has cracked the
whole bunch for me. Is that your business, too?"</p>

<p>"No, my dear," tenderly answered the big, burly specialist, beginning
his examination with such a gentle, practised touch that Peace
scarcely winced throughout the long ordeal. "My business is to
mend cracked ribs&mdash;also cracked backs. Does yours feel very badly
cracked?"</p>

<p>"All splintered up sometimes," the child promptly admitted. "It
gets so bad in the night when there's no one here to rub it that
I can't help crying once in a while. I tried to rub it myself
the other night, but it took all my breath away and I could hardly
get it back again. The bed is so hot! Dr. Coates said ages ago
that I could get up in two months, but it's more'n that now and
he shakes his head every time I ask him."</p>

<p>"Are you then so anxious to get out of this dear little crib?"</p>

<p>Peace stared hard at the kindly face so near her own, and then
ejaculated, "'Cause it's a dear little crib doesn't make it any
cooler nor any easier to stay tucked in when you are just crazy
to be dancing about. Why, it's <em>June</em> now! They told me
I'd be well so's I could plant the pansies on my Lilac Lady's
grave, seeing as Allee had to set out all the vi'lets without
any of my help. And now Hicks has had to transplant the pansies
'cause they will soon be too big."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," urged the specialist, as if every minute
of his time was not worth dollars to him; and Peace poured her
heart full of woe into his sympathetic ears. When she had finished
he abruptly asked, "Supposing Dr. Coates told you that an operation
would be necessary before you could get well, would you let him
perform it?"</p>

<p>"What's a <em>noperation</em>?" asked Peace inquisitively.</p>

<p>"There is something out of place in your back, caused by your
fall. It is pressing against the spine and must be lifted up where
it belongs before&mdash;you can ever&mdash;get well."</p>

<p>"And can Dr. Coates lift it up where it b'longs?" Peace was breathlessly
interested.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;we think so,&mdash;we hope so," stammered the doctor, startled
by the eager tone of her voice and the quick light in her big
eyes.</p>

<p>"All right then, we'll have the <em>noperation</em>. I'd most
begun to think I was going to be like my Lilac Lady. My legs don't
feel any more, and she said hers didn't."</p>

<p>"God forbid," muttered the man, who had already lost his heart
to the little invalid, and was deeply touched by the pathos of
the case; and gathering up his glittering instruments, he hurried
from the room.</p>

<p>That night a cooling rain washed the fever from the air and the
world awoke refreshed from its bath. The hot wave had broken,
but to poor Peace the cool atmosphere brought little relief. The
injured back hurt her cruelly and she could not keep the tears
from her eyes.</p>

<p>"I knew that first doctor would crack a rib," she sobbed wildly,
as the distracted President strove in vain to ease her pain. "Why
doesn't Dr. Coates come and <em>noperate</em>? O, it does hurt
me so bad, Grandpa!"</p>

<p>Laying the child back among her pillows, the stalwart man hastily
fled down the stairway, and when he came back Dr. Coates and a
sweet-faced, white-capped nurse were with him. The room across
the hall was stripped of its furnishings and scrubbed with some
evil-smelling stuff until the whole house reeked with it. Then
the walls were draped with spotless sheets, and the next morning
Peace was borne away to the improvised operating room, where only
Dr. Coates, the kindly-faced stranger physician, their young assistant
and the nurse were allowed to remain.</p>

<p>Peace looked about her curiously, murmured drowsily "I can't
say I admire your dec'rations," and fell asleep under the gentle
fumes of the ether.</p>

<p>It seemed hours later when she awakened to consciousness and
saw about her the white, drawn, anxious faces of her loved ones.
"Then I'm not dead yet," she exclaimed with satisfaction. "That's
good. Did you get my back patched up, Dr. Coates?"</p>

<p>The horrible strain was broken. With stifled, hysterical sobs,
the family hurriedly withdrew, and the nurse bent over the bed
with her finger on her lips as she gently commanded, "Hush, childie,
you mustn't talk now. We want you to get some sleep so the little
back will have a chance to heal."</p>

<p>"Can I talk when I wake up?" Peace demanded weakly.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you are very good."</p>

<p>"All right. You can go now. I don't like folks to stare at me
when I'm asleep. It d'sturbs my slumber." Closing her eyes once
more, she fell into a dreamless sleep, and the doctors departed,
much pleased with the result of their operation.</p>

<p>The days of convalescence were busy ones in the Campbell household,
for it required the combined efforts of family, nurse, doctor
and friends to keep the restless patient's attention occupied.
St. John and Elizabeth came often to the big house, bringing Glen
or Guiseppe or Lottie to amuse the prisoner; Miss Edith laughingly
declared that she was more frequently found in the Flag Room than
in her own home; Ted and Evelyn vied with each other to see which
could run the most errands, read the most stories, or propose
the most new plays during the long vacation hours; and even busy
Aunt Pen found opportunity occasionally to steal away for a brief
visit with the brown-haired sprite who had brought so much joy
into her own heart and life.</p>

<p>For a time the operation seemed a decided success, the back appeared
to be stronger, the pain almost disappeared, and the nurse was
no longer needed in the sick room. One day a wheel-chair was substituted
for the bed where Peace had lain so many weeks; and for the first
time since the accident, she was carried out under her beloved
trees, where she could watch the flowers bud and blossom, smell
their perfume on each passing breeze, and listen to the nesting
birds in the branches overhead. But the crutches she had so fondly
dreamed of, which were to teach her to walk again, were not forthcoming,
and with alarm she saw the summer slip rapidly by while she lay
among the pillows in the garden.</p>

<p>When she spoke of it to the older sisters, they answered cheerily,
"Be patient, girlie, it takes a long time for such a hurt to heal,"
and turned their heads away lest she should read the growing conviction
in their eyes.</p>

<p>"It's <em>so</em> hard to be patient," she protested mournfully.
"You bet I'll never climb another roof."</p>

<p>"No," they sighed sadly to themselves, "I am afraid you never
will."</p>

<p>But the cruel truth of the matter was broken to poor Peace at
a most unexpected moment. She was resting under her favorite oak,
close to the library window, one warm afternoon, planning as usual
for the day when she could walk again; and lulled by the drowsy
hum of the bees and the soft swish of the leaves above her, she
drifted off to slumberland. A slanting beam of the setting sun
waked her as it fell across her face, and she sat up abruptly,
hardly realizing what had roused her. Then she became aware of
voices issuing from the library beyond, and Allee's agonized voice
cried out, "O, Grandpa, you don't mean that she will <em>never</em>,
<em>never</em> walk again? Must she lie there all the rest of
her life like the Lilac Lady and Sadie Wenzell until the angels
come and get her? Grandpa, must she <em>die</em> like they did?"</p>

<p>With a startled gasp, Peace leaned forward in her chair, then
sank back among the pillows with a dreadful, sickening sensation
gripping at her heart. They were talking about her! She strained
her ears to catch the President's reply, but could hear only an
indistinct rumble of voices mingled with Allee's sharp sobs. So
the angels had carried Sadie Wenzell to her home beyond the Gates!
Idly she wondered when it had happened and why she had not been
told. It had been one of her dearest plans to visit Sadie some
day and see for herself how she enjoyed the scrapbooks which had
cost Peace so much labor and lament. Now Sadie was gone.</p>

<p>"Grandpa, Grandpa, why couldn't <em>I</em> have been the one
to fall and hurt my back?" wailed the shrill voice from the open
window. "'Twouldn't have made so much difference then, but Peace!
&mdash;O, Grandpa, I can't <em>bear</em> to think of her lying
there all the long years&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again the voice trailed away into silence, and Peace lay stunned
by the significance of the words. All her life chained to a chair!
All her life a helpless invalid like the Lilac Lady! The black
night of despair descended about her and swallowed her up.</p>

<p>They thought her asleep when they came to wheel her into the
house before the dew should fall; and as she did not stir when
they laid her in the white swan bed, they stole softly away and
left her in the grip of the demon Despair.</p>

<p>So this was what the Lilac Lady had meant when she had said so
bitterly, "You will turn your face to the wall, say good-bye to
those who you thought were your friends, build a high fence around
you and hide&mdash;<em>hide</em> from the world and everything!" The
words came back to her with a startling distinctness and a great
sob rose in her throat.</p>

<p>"What is it, darling?" asked a gentle voice from the darkness,
and Peace, clutching wildly for some human support in her hour
of anguish, threw her arms about the figure kneeling at her bedside,
and cried in terror, "O, Grandma, I <em>can't</em>, I <em>can't</em>!"</p>

<p>"Can't what?" asked the sweet voice, thinking the child was a
victim of some bad dream, for she never suspected that Peace could
know the dreadful truth.</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em> stay here all the rest of my life! I wasn't
made for the bed. My feet <em>won't</em> keep still. I <em>must</em>
run and shout. O, Grandma, tell me it isn't true!"</p>

<p>But the gentle voice was silent, and the woman's tears mingling
with those of the grief-stricken child told the story. Clasping
the quivering little body more tightly in her arms, the silvery-haired
grandmother sobbed without restraint until the child's grief was
spent, and from sheer exhaustion Peace fell asleep.</p>

<p>Then, loosing the grip of the slender hands, now grown so thin
and white, she laid her burden back on the bed, and as she kissed
the wet cheeks and left the weary slumberer to her troubled dreams,
she whispered sadly, "Good-night, little Peace,&mdash;and good-bye.
We have lost our merry little sprite. It will be a different Peace
who wakens with the morrow."</p>
