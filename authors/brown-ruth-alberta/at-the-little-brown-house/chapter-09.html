<p>"Do you know where Faith is?" asked Gail one Saturday morning
in early spring, finding Hope busy at making the beds, which was
the older sister's work.</p>

<p>"She discovered a heap of old magazines somewhere about the place
and is in the barn reading. Says her head aches too hard to work
today," answered Hope, with an anxious pucker in her usually serene
forehead.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do with that girl," sighed Gail, as she
adjusted her dustcap and picked up a broom. Her face looked so
worried, and her voice sounded so discouraged that Hope paused
in her task of plumping up the pillows to ask in alarm, "Do you
think she is any worse than usual?"</p>

<p>"She gets worse every day," answered Gail, somewhat sharply,
and two tears rolled slowly down her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"Oh, dearie, don't cry," coaxed Hope, dropping her pillows and
throwing her arms about the heaving shoulders. "It will be better
pretty soon. I'll do all of Faith's work. I only wish I were older."</p>

<p>Peace waited to hear no more. She had gone upstairs for a clean
apron before setting out for town with a basket of eggs and, unknown
to the two sisters in the room across the hall, had heard all
they said.</p>

<p>"I didn't s'pose Faith was sick," she whispered with white lips
as she flew down the path to the gate, swinging the heavy basket
dangerously near the ground in her heedlessness. "I thought she
was just lazy. She never does anything but mope around the house
and read or play the organ, but I thought it was 'cause she didn't
want to. S'posing she should die! Then we'd have three angels.
Oh, dear, I don't see why one family should have so many! I wonder
if there isn't something that will cure her. Gail hasn't called
the doctor yet. I am going to ask him myself!"</p>

<p>She slipped through the gate and sped up the road toward town,
still musing over this new trouble, and so completely wrapped
up in her thoughts that she did not even see her beloved Mr. Strong
until he called to her, "Why, hello, Peace! Are you coming over
to see our baby today! Elizabeth, will be glad to have you."</p>

<p>Her face lighted up at sight of her friend, but she shook her
head at his invitation, and soberly replied, as she hurried on,
"I'd like to, but I can't this time. I must take these eggs to
the doctor's house. Some other day I'll come and play with Baby
Glen."</p>

<p>Not to stop to discuss the welfare of the precious new baby at
the parsonage was very strange for Peace, for she loved the beautiful
boy as much as she did his parents, and was always eager to hear
of his latest tricks, no matter how pressed for time she might
be. But today she was too worried to think of even little Glen.</p>

<p>Breathlessly she climbed the steps to Dr. Bainbridge's big house,
just as the busy physician appeared in the doorway ready for his
round of calls, and in her eagerness to stop him before he should
climb into the waiting carriage, she quickened her pace to a run,
tripped on the door mat, and tumbled headlong, eggs and all, into
a drift of half-melted snow in the corner of the porch, announcing
in tragic tones, "Dr. Eggs, I have brought you some Bainbridge,
and here they are all spilled in the snow. It's lucky you aren't
a very neat man, for if you had cleared off your porches the way
you ought to, these eggs would likely have been everyone smashed.
As 'tis, there is only one broken, and one more cracked. I'll
bring another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" the doctor managed to stutter in an almost inaudible
voice, so overcome with surprise was he at the avalanche of eggs
and explanation.</p>

<p>"No, and only two of the eggs are, either &mdash;Oh, don't go
yet!" She scrambled hastily to her feet and laid a trembling,
detaining hand on his coat sleeve, as she demanded in a shaky
voice, "Is Faith real bad, do you think?"</p>

<p>"If people had more faith&mdash;" he began jestingly; then stopped,
seeing the real anxiety in the serious brown eyes, and asked gently,
"What is troubling you, child?"</p>

<p>"Faith, as usual. What is the matter with her? Gail cried about
her this morning, and Hope said maybe she would get better pretty
soon. They didn't know I heard. Is she real sick? I thought she
didn't do any work 'cause she was lazy &mdash;I mean 'cause she
didn't want to. I didn't know she was sick. What d'sease has she
got?"</p>

<p>"Well, as near as I can make out," answered the doctor gravely,
"she has a case of acute imagination. She thinks she is mourning,
but she is too selfishly wrapped up in her own grief to see the
sorrow of others. She has stepped out from under the burden of
the home and let its full weight fall upon shoulders too slender
to bear it. The sun doesn't shine for her any more, the birds
don't sing, the flowers have lost their fragrance. What she needs
is a good dose of common sense, but we don't seem to be able to
administer it. If only we could put a cannon cracker under her
chair, maybe it would rouse her. Oh, I was just speaking figuratively;
I didn't mean the real article," he hastened to assure his small
audience, as a gasp of horror escaped her.</p>

<p>The doctor had waxed eloquent in his diagnosis of the case, and
though Peace failed to understand half that he said, the grave,
almost harsh look about his mouth and eyes struck terror to her
heart, and she faintly faltered, "Is&mdash;do you think Faith will
be an angel soon?"</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement. "No!" he thundered, and she shivered
at his tone. "It will take ages to make an angel of Faith if she
keeps on in the way she is going. Gail is the angel if ever there
was one, and Hope's wings have sprouted, too&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh," moaned Peace, with wide, terrified eyes, "I don't want
Gail and Hope to be angels! We need them here! We could spare
Faith easier than them. Oh, Dr. Bainbridge, ain't two angels enough
for one family?"</p>

<p>The kindly old doctor suddenly understood, and patting the little
hood, covered with bits of eggshell and particles of ice, he said
remorsefully, "There, there, honey, I didn't mean that kind of
angels! I mean just dear, good, blessed girls, such as make the
world better for having been in it. There is no danger of their
flying away to the other land just yet, my child; though goodness
only knows what will become of Gail if Faith isn't waked up soon.
I must go call on my sick folks now, little girl. I'd drive you
home if I were going that way, but I am due this very minute at
the opposite end of town. Don't you fret, but be an awfully good
girl yourself and help Gail all you can. When Faith comes to her
senses and goes to work at something, she will be all right."</p>

<p>They parted, and Peace slowly wended her way home again, somewhat
relieved, and yet considerably alarmed over the doctor's words.
Down to the barn she wandered, and up the rickety ladder she climbed
into the cobwebby loft. A figure moved impatiently at the far
end of the loose boards, and as Peace's eyes became accustomed
to the dim light, she saw it was Faith, curled up among a lot
of ragged papers and coverless magazines, musty and yellow with
age.</p>

<p>"What are you ba&mdash;crying about!" asked Peace in awed tones, as
the other girl sniffed suspiciously and then wiped her eyes, already
red with weeping. She expected to be told to mind her business,
but contrary to her expectations, Faith answered:</p>

<p>"This is the <em>saddest</em> story,&mdash;all about a girl who loved
one man and had to marry another."</p>

<p>Peace's nose curled scornfully, and she said, with great contempt,
"I don't see any use in bawl&mdash;crying about that. Those story people
never lived. Real folks have more sense."</p>

<p>But Faith had gone back to her magazine of sorrows, and never
even heard this small sister's criticism. So Peace dropped down
on a heap of sacking, propped her chin up with her elbows on her
knees, and fell to studying the face opposite her, noting with
alarm how thin it had grown, and how darkly circled were the brown
eyes so like her own. Fear lest Dr. Bainbridge did not know how
ill she really was gripped her heart, and she sighed heavily just
as Faith finished her chapter and roused to search for the next
number of the magazine.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she demanded, looking at the sober little
face with surprise.</p>

<p>"Are you sick?" asked Peace in an awestruck whisper, ignoring
her sister's question.</p>

<p>"No. Why? My head aches some, but that is all."</p>

<p>"I sh'd think it <em>would</em> ache," cried the child in sudden
indignation. "Why did you poke up here where there ain't any window
to read by? You'll be blind some day if you <em>amuse</em> your
eyes like that. Teacher said so to all our class the day she found
Tessie Hunt reading on the basement stairs. If you've got to read
all the time, why don't you go out-doors or by a window? It's
enough to make anyone's head ache the way you mope around reading
all the time. Dr. Bainbridge says as soon as you get up and go
to work you'll be all right."</p>

<p>Faith's face flushed angrily and she demanded, with some heat,
"What do you know about what Dr. Bainbridge says?"</p>

<p>"I asked him a-purpose to see whether you were going to be an
angel soon."</p>

<p>For a moment Faith was too startled for reply, and then she asked
curiously, with a queer flutter in her heart, "What did he say!"</p>

<p>"He just howled, 'No&mdash;o!' as loud as he could shout, and after
that he said, more quiet-like, that you'd never be an angel as
long as you kept on the way you are going. He says you need a
good, common dose of sense and a cannon under your chair. He said
Gail and Hope are the angels, and when I cried and told him we
could spare you easier'n we could them, he said that he didn't
mean sure-enough angels which fly away and never come back, but
good, <em>sensitive</em> blessings that make the world better.
He says you've got a <em>cute minagination</em>, and when you
wake up and help Gail bear the slender burden on your shoulders,
everything will be all right."</p>

<p>Profound silence reigned in the barn for what seemed an eternity
to Peace, and then Faith burst forth hotly, "I never saw such
a meddlesome child in all my born days, Peace Greenfield! What
did you tell the doctor? Why did you chase to him in the first
place? Do you want to get the whole neighborhood to gossiping
about our affairs? I suppose you gave him the whole family history,
from the time of Adam."</p>

<p>"I never did!" Peace indignantly denied. "I don't know of any
Adam 'mong our relations. I found Gail upstairs crying about you
this morning, and Hope promised to do all your work. I couldn't
see why Hope should do your work unless you were going to be an
angel, so I went to the doctor about it, and that is why he told
me. He said we must help Gail all we could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why don't you, then, instead of causing her trouble whenever
you turn around? You are into something the whole time to fret
and worry her. Don't talk about me until you are perfect yourself!"</p>

<p>"I ain't perfect, but I <em>try</em> to help, and you know it.
Don't I help Cherry with the dishes every single day, and dust
the parlor and bring in wood, and hasn't Hope turned over setting
the table to me?"</p>

<p>"And don't you break half the dishes?"</p>

<p>"I've broken only one plate and three cups, and I bought new
ones out of my snow money, so there! When summer comes I'm going
to pick strawberries for Mr. Hartman, and when I've paid up for
those I spoiled last year, I'm going to give the rest of the money
I earn to Gail to help her all I can. 'F I could make the lovely
cakes you do, I'd go 'round the streets peddling them."</p>

<p>"If you were I, you'd do wonders," Faith broke in bitterly.</p>

<p>"Well, Mrs. Abbott told me herself that if the village baker
could cook like that she would get all her delicate things there
instead of bothering the girl with them, 'cause, in a little subu'b
like this, she can't get a cook and a second girl to stay at the
same time, and a common hired girl doesn't know beans about cakes
and nice cookery. Mrs. Lacy said she'd take a cake reg'lar every
week if she could get such nice ones as yours; and the butcher&mdash;guess
what the butcher asked me yesterday! I went in his shop on my
way home from the minister's, and he asked me when we were going
to break up housekeeping here."</p>

<p>"What did you say?" cried Faith, as the meaning of his question
dawned upon her, though Peace evidently had not understood.</p>

<p>"I didn't know what he was driving at, so I asked him, and he
said he had heard that we were going to leave this house and go
to live with different people in town. He wanted to know if he
could have Cherry, 'cause he thinks she is so pretty. I told him
he needn't joke with me like that, but he just laughed and _in_sured
me that Mr. Strong was going to take Allee, and Dr. Bainbridge
wanted Hope, and that you and Gail were to work in Martindale,
and I was the broom of condemnation."</p>

<p>"The what?" cried Faith in amazement.</p>

<p>"The broom of con-dem-nation," repeated Peace slowly, seeing
that she had made a blunder, but not understanding just wherein
it lay. "It means when a lot of people want the same thing."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are trying to say 'bone of contention,'" suggested
Faith, somewhat sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Maybe 'twas. Anyway, he says Mr. Hardman wants me&mdash;but I don't
want him, I can tell you that!"</p>

<p>"I thought you had signed a treaty of peace and were friends
now," murmured the older girl, considerably amused at the child's
belligerent attitude, in spite of her troubled thoughts.</p>

<p>"Oh, we are friends all right, but not bad enough so's I want
to go live with him. Though I don't know as it would be any worse
there than with Judge Abbott, and he's the other fellow who wants
me. My, the way he glared at me Thanksgiving morning, when we
shoveled the snow off his porch, scared me stiff! I thought he
was going to make us shovel it back on again, but he didn't. And
the time my snowball knocked Hector's teeth loose, I was sure
he was going to 'rest me, but I couldn't help if Hec opened his
mouth just in time to get that ball; and anyway, he deserved it,
'cause he was pulling Mamie Brady's red hair and calling her Carrots
till she cried. I told the Judge that Hec needed to have more
than just his teeth knocked loose, and he laughed and marched
him home by the ear."</p>

<p>"Peace, have you told Gail this?"</p>

<p>"About Hec's teeth?"</p>

<p>"No, about what Mr. Jones said to you?"</p>

<p>"Not yet. I didn't think it was a very nice joke, so I never
told anyone but you and the preacher. Mr. Strong said he'd see
that the butcher didn't tease me any more."</p>

<p>"Well, if I were you, I would forget all about it, but don't
ever tell Gail. She might take it in earnest and feel badly about
it."</p>

<p>Peace eyed the older girl, as if trying to fathom her meaning,
but Faith's face was like a mask, and after a brief pause, the
child answered, "I don't mean to; but ain't I glad she can't guess
all my thinks! Just s'posing everyone knew what everyone else
was thinking, wouldn't some folks be scrapping all the time? Brains
are queer things. I used to wish I could see one when it was doing
its thinking, but I guess God knew his business when he put them
inside our heads, where no one else can watch them."</p>

<p>"Peace, Peace! Where are you?" called an excited voice from below,
and the brown-eyed philosopher jumped up from her burlap couch
with the shout, "Coming, Allee! I hope you find your senses pretty
soon, Faith, for the doctor says when that happens you will be
all right and not have any more headache."</p>

<p>The faded red coat disappeared down the ladder, and Faith was
left alone again. But she read no more. The sad story had lost
its interest, and she cast aside the magazines without another
glance. Was what Mr. Jones had told Peace true? Was there a possibility
that the home must be broken up? Was the doctor right in his verdict?
Did all the sisters feel that she could be spared the easiest?
That was a fierce battle Faith waged with herself in the barn,
but when it was ended a determined-faced girl rose from the dusty
floor, descended the old ladder, and hurried away toward the village.
It was noon before she returned, and the five sisters, anxious
over her unusual absence, were just sitting down to a frugal dinner
of mush and milk when she entered the door, looking excited and
queer, but with a happier light in her eyes than had been there
for months.</p>

<p>The minute grace was said, Peace demanded suspiciously, "Where
have you been all this time?"</p>

<p>"Drumming up trade," was the startling answer. "I've got six
regular cake customers, and several who promised to buy of me
when they needed anything in my line."</p>

<p>Faith was awake at last.</p>
