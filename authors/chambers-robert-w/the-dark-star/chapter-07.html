<p>By the end of the week Brandes had done much to efface any unpleasant
impression he had made on Ruhannah Carew.</p>

<p>The girl had never before had to do with any mature man. She
was therefore at a disadvantage in every way, and her total lack
of experience emphasised the odds.</p>

<p>Nobody had ever before pointedly preferred her, paid her undivided
attention; no man had ever sought her, conversed with her, deferred
to her, interested himself in her. It was entirely new to her,
this attention which Brandes paid her. Nor could she make any
comparisons between this man and other men, because she knew no
other men. He was an entirely novel experience to her; he had
made himself interesting, had proved amusing, considerate, kind,
generous, and apparently interested in what interested her. And
if his unfeigned preference for her society disturbed and perplexed
her, his assiduous civilities toward her father and mother were
gradually winning from her far more than anything he had done
for her.</p>

<p>His white-faced, odd little friend had gone; he himself had taken
quarters at the Gayfield House, where a car like the wrecked one
was stabled for his use.</p>

<p>He had already taken her father and mother and herself everywhere
within motoring distance; he had accompanied them to church; he
escorted her to the movies; he walked with her in the August evenings
after supper, rowed her about on the pond, fished from the bridge,
told her strange stories in the moonlight on the verandah, her
father and mother interested and attentive.</p>

<p>For the career of Mr. Eddie Brandes was capable of furnishing
material for interesting stories if carefully edited, and related
with discretion and circumspection. He had been many things to
many men&mdash;and to several women&mdash;he had been a tinhorn gambler
in the Southwest, a miner in Alaska, a saloon keeper in Wyoming,
a fight promoter in Arizona. He had travelled profitably on popular
ocean liners until requested to desist; Auteuil, Neuilly, Vincennes,
and Longchamps knew him as tout, bookie, and, when fitfully prosperous,
as a plunger. Epsom knew him once as a welcher; and knew him no
more.</p>

<p>He had taken a comic opera company through the wheat-belt&mdash;one
way; he had led a burlesque troupe into Arizona and had traded
it there for a hotel.</p>

<p>"When Eddie <em>wants</em> to talk," Stull used to say, "that
smoke, <em>Othello</em>, hasn't got nothing on him."</p>

<p>However, Brandes seldom chose to talk. This was one of his rare
garrulous occasions; and, with careful self-censorship, he was
making an endless series of wonder-tales out of the episodes and
<em>faits divers</em> common to the experience of such as he.</p>

<p>So, of moving accidents by flood and field this man had a store,
and he contrived to make them artistically innocuous and perfectly
fit for family consumption.</p>

<p>Further, two of his friends motored over from Saratoga to see
him, were brought to supper at the Carews'; and they gave him
a clean bill of moral health. They were, respectively, "Doc" Curfoot&mdash;suave
haunter of Peacock Alley and gentleman "capper"&mdash;whom Brandes
introduced as the celebrated specialist, Doctor Elbert Curfoot&mdash;and
Captain Harman Quint, partner in "Quint's" celebrated temple of
chance&mdash;introduced as the distinguished navigating officer which
he appeared to be. The steering for their common craft, however,
was the duty of the eminent Doc.</p>

<p>They spent the evening on the verandah with the family; and it
was quite wonderful what a fine fellow each turned out to be&mdash;information
confidentially imparted to the Reverend Mr. Carew by each of the
three distinguished gentlemen in turn.</p>

<p>Doc Curfoot, whose business included the ability to talk convincingly
on any topic, took the Reverend Mr. Carew's measure and chose
literature; and his suave critique presently became an interesting
monologue listened to in silence by those around him.</p>

<p>Brandes had said, "Put me in right, Doc," and Doc was accomplishing
it, partly to oblige Brandes, partly for practice. His agreeable
voice so nicely pitched, so delightfully persuasive, recapitulating
all the commonplaces and cant phrases concerning the literature
of the day, penetrated gratefully the intellectual isolation of
these humble gentlepeople, and won very easily their innocent
esteem. With the Reverend Mr. Carew Doc discussed such topics
as the influence on fiction of the ethical ideal. With Mrs. Carew
Captain Quint exchanged reminiscences of travel on distant seas.
Brandes attempted to maintain low-voiced conversation with Rue,
who responded in diffident monosyllables to his advances.</p>

<p>Brandes walked down to their car with them after they had taken
their leave.</p>

<p>"What's the idea, Eddie?" inquired Doc Curfoot, pausing before
the smart little speeder.</p>

<p>"It's straight."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Doc, softly, betraying no surprise&mdash;about the only
thing he never betrayed. "Anything in it for you, Eddie?"</p>

<p>"Yes. A good girl. The kind you read about. Isn't that enough?"</p>

<p>"Minna chucked you?" inquired Captain Quint.</p>

<p>"She'll get her decree in two or three months. Then I'll have
a home. And everything that you and I are keeps out of that home,
Cap. See?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Quint. "Quite right, Eddie."</p>

<p>Doc Curfoot climbed in and took the wheel; Quint followed him.</p>

<p>"Say," he said in his pleasant, guarded voice, "watch out that
Minna don't double-cross you, Eddie."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>" &mdash;Or shoot you up. She's some <em>schutzen-fest</em>,
you know, when she turns loose&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Ah, I tell you she <em>wants</em> the divorce. Abe Grittlefeld's
crazy about her. He'll get Abe Gordon to star her on Broadway;
and that's enough for her. Besides, she'll marry Maxy Venem when
she can afford to keep him."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> never understood Minna Minti."</p>

<p>"Well, who ever understood any German?" demanded Brandes. "She's
one of those sour-blooded, silent Dutch women that make me ache."</p>

<p>Doc pushed the self-starter; there came a click, a low humming.
Brandes' face cleared and he held out his square-shaped hand:</p>

<p>"You fellows," he said, "have put me right with the old folks
here. I'll do the same for you some day. Don't talk about this
little girl and me, that's all."</p>

<p>"All the same," repeated Doc, "don't take any chances with Minna.
She's on to you, and she's got a rotten Dutch disposition."</p>

<p>"That's right, Doc. And say, Harman,"&mdash;to Quint&mdash;"tell Ben he's
doing fine. Tell him to send me what's mine, because I'll want
it very soon now. I'm going to take a month off and then I'm going
to show Stein how a theatre can be run."</p>

<p>"Eddie," said Quint, "it's a good thing to think big, but it's
a damn poor thing to talk big. Cut out the talk and you'll be
a big man some day."</p>

<p>The graceful car moved forward into the moonlight; his two friends
waved an airy adieu; and Brandes went slowly back to the dark
verandah where sat a young girl, pitifully immature in mind and
body&mdash;and two old people little less innocent for all their experience
in the ranks of Christ, for all the wounds that scarred them both
in the over-sea service which had broken them forever.</p>

<p>"A very handsome and distinguished gentleman, your friend Dr.
Curfoot," said the Reverend Mr. Carew. "I imagine his practice
in New York is not only fashionable but extensive."</p>

<p>"Both," said Brandes.</p>

<p>"I assume so. He seems to be intimately acquainted with people
whose names for generations have figured prominently in the social
columns of the New York press."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Curfoot and Quint know them all."</p>

<p>Which was true enough. They had to. One must know people from
whom one accepts promissory notes to liquidate those little affairs
peculiar to the temple of chance. And New York's best furnished
the neophytes for these rites.</p>

<p>"I thought Captain Quint very interesting," ventured Ruhannah.
"He seems to have sailed over the entire globe."</p>

<p>"Naval men are always delightful," said her mother. And, laying
her hand on her husband's arm in the dark: "Do you remember, Wilbour,
how kind the officers from the cruiser <em>Oneida</em> were when
the rescue party took us aboard?"</p>

<p>"God sent the <em>Oneida</em> to us," said her husband dreamily.
"I thought it was the end of the world for us&mdash;for you and me
and baby Rue&mdash;that dreadful flight from the mission to the sea."</p>

<p>His bony fingers tightened over his wife's toilworn hand. In
the long grass along the creek fireflies sparkled, and their elfin
lanterns, waning, glowing, drifted high in the calm August night.</p>

<p>The Reverend Mr. Carew gathered his crutches; the night was a
trifle damp for him; besides, he desired to read. Brandes, as
always, rose to aid him. His wife followed.</p>

<p>"Don't stay out long, Rue," she said in the doorway.</p>

<p>"No, mother."</p>

<p>Brandes came back. Departing from his custom, he did not light
a cigar, but sat in silence, his narrow eyes trying to see Ruhannah
in the darkness. But she was only a delicate shadow shape to him,
scarcely detached from the darkness that enveloped her.</p>

<p>He meant to speak to her then. And suddenly found he could not,
realised, all at once, that he lacked the courage.</p>

<p>This was the more amazing and disturbing to him because he could
not remember the time or occasion when the knack of fluent speech
had ever failed him.</p>

<p>He had never foreseen such a situation; it had never occurred
to him that he would find the slightest difficulty in saying easily
and gracefully what he had determined to say to this young girl.</p>

<p>Now he sat there silent, disturbed, nervous, and tongue-tied.
At first he did not quite comprehend what was making him afraid.
After a long while he understood that it was some sort of fear
of her&mdash;fear of her refusal, fear of losing her, fear that she
might have&mdash;in some occult way&mdash;divined what he really was, that
she might have heard things concerning him, his wife, his career.
The idea turned him cold.</p>

<p>And all at once he realised how terribly in earnest he had become;
how deeply involved; how vital this young girl had become to him.</p>

<p>Never before had he really wanted anything as compared to this
desire of his for her. He was understanding, too, in a confused
way, that such a girl and such a home for him as she could make
was going not only to give him the happiness he expected, but
that it also meant betterment for himself&mdash;straighter living,
perhaps straighter thinking&mdash;the birth of something resembling
self-respect, perhaps even aspiration&mdash;or at least the aspiration
toward that respect from others which honest living dare demand.</p>

<p>He wanted her; he wanted her now; he wanted to marry her whether
or not he had the legal right; he wanted to go away for a month
with her, and then return and work for her, for them both&mdash;build
up a fortune and a good reputation with Stein's backing and Stein's
theatre&mdash;stand well with honest men, stand well with himself,
stand always, with her, for everything a man should be.</p>

<p>If she loved him she would forgive him and quietly remarry him
as soon as Minna kicked him loose. He was confident he could make
her happy, make her love him if once he could find courage to
speak&mdash;if once he could win her. And suddenly the only possible
way to go about it occurred to him.</p>

<p>His voice was a trifle husky and unsteady from the nervous tension
when he at last broke the silence:</p>

<p>"Miss Rue," he said, "I have a word to say to your father and
mother. Would you wait here until I come back?"</p>

<p>"I think I had better go in, too&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please don't."</p>

<p>"Why?" She stopped short, instinctively, but not surmising.</p>

<p>"You will wait, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I was going in.... But I'll sit here a little while."</p>

<p>He rose and went in, rather blindly.</p>

<p>Ruhannah, dreaming there deep in her splint armchair, slim feet
crossed, watched the fireflies sailing over the alders. Sometimes
she thought of Brandes, pleasantly, sometimes of other matters.
Once the memory of her drive home through the wintry moonlight
with young Neeland occurred to her, and the reminiscence was vaguely
agreeable.</p>

<p>Listless, a trifle sleepy, dreamily watching the fireflies, the
ceaseless noise of the creek in her ears, inconsequential thoughts
flitted through her brain&mdash;the vague, aimless, guiltless thoughts
of a young and unstained mind.</p>

<p>She was nearly asleep when Brandes came back, and she looked
up at him where he stood beside her porch chair in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Miss Rue," he said, "I have told your father and mother that
I am in love with you and want to make you my wife."</p>

<p>The girl lay there speechless, astounded.</p>
