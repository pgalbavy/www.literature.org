<p>It was so quiet and peaceful and altogether lovely there in the
Green Forest, where Lightfoot the Deer lay resting behind a pile
of brush near the top of a little hill, that it didn't seem possible
such a thing as sudden death could be anywhere near. It didn't
seem possible that there could be any need for watchfulness. But
Lightfoot long ago had learned that often danger is nearest when
it seems least to be expected. So, though he would have liked
very much to have taken a nap, Lightfoot was too wise to do anything
so foolish. He kept his beautiful, great, soft eyes fixed in the
direction from which the hunter with the terrible gun would come
if he were still following that trail. He kept his great ears
gently moving to catch every little sound.</p>

<p>Lightfoot had about decided that the hunter had given up hunting
for that day, but he didn't let this keep him from being any the
less watchful. It was better to be overwatchful than the least
bit careless. By and by, Lightfoot's keen ears caught the sound
of the snapping of a little stick in the distance. It was so faint
a sound that you or I would have missed it altogether. But Lightfoot
heard it and instantly he was doubly alert, watching in the direction
from which that faint sound had come. After what seemed a long,
long time he saw something moving, and a moment later a man came
into view. It was the hunter and across one arm he carried the
terrible gun.</p>

<p>Lightfoot knew now that this hunter had patience and perseverance
and had not yet given up hope of getting near enough to shoot
Lightfoot. He moved forward slowly, setting each foot down with
the greatest care, so as not to snap a stick or rustle the leaves.
He was watching sharply ahead, ready to shoot should he catch
a glimpse of Lightfoot within range.</p>

<p>Right along through the hollow at the foot of the little hill
below Lightfoot the hunter passed. He was no longer studying the
ground for Lightfoot's tracks, because the ground was so hard
and dry down there that Lightfoot had left no tracks. He was simply
hunting in the direction from which the Merry Little Breezes were
blowing because he knew that Lightfoot had gone in that direction,
and he also knew that if Lightfoot were still ahead of him, his
scent could not be carried to Lightfoot. He was doing what is
called "hunting up-wind."</p>

<p>Lightfoot kept perfectly still and watched the hunter disappear
among the trees. Then he silently got to his feet, shook himself
lightly, and noiselessly stole away over the hilltop towards another
part of the Green Forest. He felt sure that that hunter would
not find him again that day.</p>
