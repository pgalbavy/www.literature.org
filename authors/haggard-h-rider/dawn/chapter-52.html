<p>Three days after her conversation with Lady Bellamy, Angela received
the following letter:--
</p>
<p>                                 "Isleworth Hall, Roxham, May 2.
</p><p> "Dear Cousin Angela,
</p><p> "My kind and devoted friend, Lady Bellamy, has told me that she has
  spoken to you on a subject which is very near to my heart, and
  that you have distinctly declined to have anything to do with it.
  Of course I know that the matter lies entirely within your own
  discretion, but I still venture to lay the following points before
  you. There have, I am aware, been some painful passages between us
  --passages which, under present circumstances, had much better be
  forgotten. So, first, I ask you to put them quite out of your
  mind, and to judge of what I have to propose from a very different
  point of view.
</p><p> "I write, Angela, to ask you to marry me it is true (since,
  unfortunately, my health will not allow me to ask you in person),
  but it is a very different offer from that which I made you in the
  lane when you so bitterly refused me. Now I am solely anxious that
  the marriage should take place in order that I may be enabled to
  avoid the stringent provisions of your grandfather's will, which,
  whilst forbidding me to leave these estates back to your father or
  his issue, fortunately does not forbid a fictitious sale and the
  settlement of the sum, or otherwise. But I will not trouble you
  with these legal details.
</p><p> "In short, I supplanted your father in youth, and I am now anxious
  to make every reparation in my power, and at present I am quite
  unable to make any. Independently of this, it pains me to think of
  the estate passing away from the old stock, and I should like to
  know that you, who have been the only woman whom I have felt true
  affection for, will one day come into possession of it. Of course,
  as you understand, the marriage would be <u>nothing but a form</u>, and
  if, as I am told, you object to its being gone through with the
  ceremonies of the Church, it could be made equally legal at a
  registry office.
</p><p> "But please understand, Angela, that I do not wish to press you: it
  is for you to judge. Only you must judge quickly, for I am a fastdying 
  man, and am anxious to get this matter off my mind one way
  or other, in order that I may be able to give it fully to the
  consideration of subjects of more vital importance to one in my
  condition, than marrying and giving in marriage.
</p><pre>
                     "Ever, dear cousin Angela,
                                 "Affectionately yours,
                                              "George Caresfoot."</pre>
<p> "P.S.--Remember you have your father to consider in this matter as
  well as yourself."
</p>
<p>The receipt of this letter plunged Angela into the greatest distress
of mind. It was couched in a tone so courteous and so moderate that it
carried with it conviction of its sincerity and truth. If she only had
been concerned, she would not long have hesitated, but the idea of her
duty to her father rose up before her like a cloud. What was her true
duty under the circumstances? there was the rub!
</p><p>She took the letter to Mr. Fraser and asked his advice. He read it
carefully, and thought a long while before he answered. The idea of
Angela being united to anybody in marriage, even as a matter of form,
was naturally abominable to him, but he was far too honourable and
conscientious a man to allow his personal likes or dislikes to
interfere with whatever he considered to be his duty. But in the end
he found it impossible to give any fixed opinion.
</p><p>"My dear," he said, "all that I can suggest is that you should take it
to your father and hear what he has got to say. After all, it is he
who must have your true welfare most at heart. It was into his hands
that I heard your mother, in peculiarly solemn words, consign you and
your interests. Take it to your father, dear, there is no counsel like
that of a father."
</p><p>Had Mr. Fraser been the father, this would, doubtless, have been true
enough. But though he had known him for so many years, and was privy
to much of his history, he did not yet understand Philip Caresfoot.
His own open and guileless nature did not easily suspect evil in
another, more especially when that other was the father of her whom he
looked upon as the earthly incarnation of all that was holy and pure.
</p><p>Angela sighed and obeyed--sighed from doubt, obeyed from duty. She
handed the letter to Philip without a word--without a word he read it.
</p><p>"I want your opinion, father," she said. "I wish to do what is right.
You know how painful what has happened has been for me. You know--or,
if you do not know, you must have guessed--how completely shattered my
life is. As for this marriage, the whole thing is repugnant to me;
personally, I had rather sacrifice fifty properties than go through
it, but I know that I ought to think of others. Mr. Fraser tells me
that it is my duty to consult you, that you will naturally have my
interest most at heart, that it was into your hands and to your care
that my mother consigned me on her deathbed. Father"--and she clasped
her hands and looked him full in the face with her earnest eyes--"Mr.
Fraser is right, it must be for you to decide. I will trust you
entirely, and leave the burden of decision to your honour and
generosity; only I say, spare me if you can."
</p><p>Philip rose and went to look out of the window, that he might hide the
evident agitation of his face and the tremor of his limbs. He felt
that the crucial moment had come. All his poor sophistry, all his
miserable shuffling and attempts to fix the responsibility of his acts
on others, had recoiled upon his own head. She had come to him and
laid the burden on his heart. What should he answer? For a moment the
shades--for with him they were only shades--of good angels gained the
upper hand, and he was about to turn and look her in the face--for
then he felt he could have looked her in the face--and bid her have
nothing to do with George and his proposals. But, even in the act of
turning to obey the impulse, his eyes fell upon the roof of Isleworth
Hall, which, standing on an eminence, could easily be seen from the
Abbey House, and his mind, quicker than the eye, flew to the outlook
place upon that roof where he had so often climbed as a boy, and
surveyed the fair champaign country beyond it; meadow and wood, fallow
and cornland, all of which were for him involved in that answer. He
did not stop turning, but--so quick is the working of the mind--he
changed the nature of his answer. The real presence of the demon of
greed chased away the poor angelic shadows.
</p><p>"It would not be much of a sacrifice for you, Angela, to go through
this form; he is a dying man, and you need not even change your name.
The lands are mine by right, and will be yours. It will break my heart
to lose them, after all these years of toiling to save enough to buy
them. But I do not wish to force you. In short, I leave the matter to
your generosity, as you would have left it to mine."
</p><p>"And suppose that I were to marry my cousin George, and he were not to
die after all, what would be my position then? You must clearly
understand that, to save us all from starvation, I would never be his
wife."
</p><p>"You need not trouble yourself with the question. He is a dead man; in
two months' time he will be in the family vault."
</p><p>She bowed her head and left him--left him with his hot and glowing
greed, behind which crept a terror.
</p><p>Next morning, George Caresfoot received the following letter:
</p>
<p>                                          "Bratham Abbey, May 5.
</p><p> "Dear Cousin George,
</p><p> "In reply to your letter, I must tell you that I am willing to go
  through the form of marriage with you--at a registry-office, not
  in church--in order to enable you to carry out the property
  arrangements you wish to make. You must, however, clearly
  understand that I do not do this on my own account, but simply
  and solely to benefit my father, who has left the matter to my
  'generosity.' I must ask you as a preliminary step to make a copy
  of and sign the enclosed letter addressed to me. Our lives are in
  the hand of God, and it is possible that you might be restored to
  health. In such an event, however improbable it may seem, it
  cannot be made too plain that I am not, and have never in any
  sense undertaken to be, your wife.
</p><pre>
                                        "Truly yours,
                                              "Angela Caresfoot."</pre>

<p>The enclosure ran as follows:
</p>
<p> "I, George Caresfoot, hereby solemnly promise before God that under
  no possible circumstance will I attempt to avail myself of any
  rights over my cousin, Angela Caresfoot, and that I will leave her
  as soon as the formal ceremony is concluded, and never again
  attempt to see her except by her own wish; the so-called marriage
  being only contemplated in order to enable me to carry out certain
  business arrangements which, in view of the failing state of my
  health, I am anxious to enter into."
</p>
<p>This letter and its curious enclosure, surely the oddest marriage
contract which was ever penned, George, trembling with excitement,
thrust into the hands of Lady Bellamy. She read them with a dark
smile.
</p><p>"The bird is springed," she said, quietly. "It has been a close thing,
but I told you that I should not fail, as I have warned you of what
will follow your success. Sign this paper--this waste-paper--and
return it."
