<p>The two were compelled to pick their way with extreme care, for
there was no saying when some of the wandering Indians would come
upon them. It was necessary, as our friends thought, to go considerably
farther up, before it would be at all safe to cross the river.</p>

<p>They were yet some distance from the point, when a slight disturbance
was heard in a patch of woods in front, and they stopped.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute or two, until I find out what it means," said
Fred; "it will save time to go through there, but it won't do
to undertake it if it isn't safe."</p>

<p>And before Mr. Brainerd could protest, his son moved forward,
as stealthily as an Indian scout, while the former concealed himself
until the issue of the reconnoissance should become known.</p>

<p>The old gentleman realized too vividly the horrors of the massacre
still going on around them to permit himself to run any unnecessary
risk, now that there was a prospect of rejoining his family; and
he regretted that his courageous child had gone forward so impulsively,
instead of carefully flanking what seemed to be a dangerous spot.</p>

<p>But it was too late now to recall him, for he was beyond sight,
and Mr. Brainerd could only wait and hope for the best, while,
it may be truly said, he feared the worst.</p>

<p>It was not long before Fred Godfrey began strongly to suspect
he had committed an error, from which it required all the skill
at his command to extricate himself.</p>

<p>The wood that he had entered covered something less than an acre,
and was simply a denser portion of the wilderness through which
they had been making their way. He had scarcely entered it when
the murmur of voices told him that others were in advance, and
he knew enough of the Indians to recognize the sounds as made
by them.</p>

<p>It was at that very moment he ought to have withdrawn, and, rejoining
Mr. Brainerd, left the neighborhood as silently as possible, but
his curiosity led him on.</p>

<p>That curiosity was gratified by the sight of six of his own people
held prisoners by a group of twice as many Indians, who, beyond
question, were making preparations for putting their victims to
death.</p>

<p>As seems to be the rule, these prisoners, all of whom were able-bodied
men, most of them young, were in a state of despair and collapse;
they were standing up unbound and unarmed, and looking stolidly
at their captors, who were also on their feet, but were talking
and gesticulating with much earnestness.</p>

<p>The most remarkable figure in the group was a woman. She was
doing the principal part of the talking, and in a voice so loud,
and accompanied by such energetic gestures, that there could be
no doubt that she was the leader.</p>

<p>She was attired in Indian costume, and was evidently a half-breed,
though it has been claimed by many that she was of pure Indian
blood. She was beyond middle life, her hair being plentifully
sprinkled with gray, but she still possessed great strength and
activity, and was well fitted to command the Indians, as she did
when they marched into and took possession of Forty Fort on the
succeeding day.</p>

<p>A son of this strange woman had been killed a short time before,
and she was roused to the highest point of fury. She demanded
not only the blood of those already captured, but that others
should be brought in; and she had established a camp in the place
named, until a sufficient number could be secured to satisfy,
to a partial extent, her vengeful mood.</p>

<p>She is known in history as Queen Esther and as Katharine Montour.
She was queen of the Seneca tribe of Indians&mdash;one of the Iroquois
or Six Nations&mdash;the most powerful confederation of aborigines
ever known on this continent.</p>

<p>Her home was in central New York, where the Six Nations had been
ruled by Sir William Johnson, the British superintendent, and,
among all the furies who entered Wyoming Valley on that day in
July, there was none who excelled this being in the ferocity displayed
toward the prisoners.</p>

<p>"That must be Queen Esther," thought Fred Godfrey, as he cautiously
surveyed the scene; "I have heard of the hecate&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that instant a slight rustling behind caused him to turn his
head, just in time to catch sight of a shadowy body that came
down upon him like an avalanche.</p>

<p>He struggled fiercely, but other Indians joined in, and in a
twinkling the lieutenant was disarmed and helpless, and was conducted
triumphantly into the presence of Katharine Montour, whose small,
black eyes sparkled as she surveyed this addition to her roll
of victims, for whose torture she was arranging at that moment.</p>
