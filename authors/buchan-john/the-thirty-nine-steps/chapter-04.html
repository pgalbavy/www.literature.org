<p>You may picture me driving that 40 h.p. car for all she was worth
over the crisp moor roads on that shining May morning; glancing
back at first over my shoulder, and looking anxiously to the next
turning; then driving with a vague eye, just wide enough awake
to keep on the highway. For I was thinking desperately of what
I had found in Scudder’s pocket-book.</p>

<p>The little man had told me a pack of lies. All his yarns about
the Balkans and the Jew-Anarchists and the Foreign Office Conference
were eyewash, and so was Karolides. And yet not quite, as you
shall hear. I had staked everything on my belief in his story,
and had been let down; here was his book telling me a different
tale, and instead of being once-bitten-twice-shy, I believed it
absolutely.</p>

<p>Why, I don’t know. It rang desperately true, and the first yarn,
if you understand me, had been in a queer way true also in spirit.
The fifteenth day of June was going to be a day of destiny, a
bigger destiny than the killing of a Dago. It was so big that
I didn’t blame Scudder for keeping me out of the game and wanting
to play a lone hand. That, I was pretty clear, was his intention.
He had told me something which sounded big enough, but the real
thing was so immortally big that he, the man who had found it
out, wanted it all for himself. I didn’t blame him. It was risks
after all that he was chiefly greedy about.</p>

<p>The whole story was in the notes—with gaps, you understand, which
he would have filled up from his memory. He stuck down his authorities,
too, and had an odd trick of giving them all a numerical value
and then striking a balance, which stood for the reliability of
each stage in the yarn. The four names he had printed were authorities,
and there was a man, Ducrosne, who got five out of a possible
five; and another fellow, Ammersfoort, who got three. The bare
bones of the tale were all that was in the book—these, and one
queer phrase which occurred half a dozen times inside brackets.
("Thirty-nine steps") was the phrase; and at its last time of
use it ran—("Thirty-nine steps, I counted them—high tide 10.17
p.m."). I could make nothing of that.</p>

<p>The first thing I learned was that it was no question of preventing
a war. That was coming, as sure as Christmas: had been arranged,
said Scudder, ever since February 1912. Karolides was going to
be the occasion. He was booked all right, and was to hand in his
checks on June 14th, two weeks and four days from that May morning.
I gathered from Scudder’s notes that nothing on earth could prevent
that. His talk of Epirote guards that would skin their own grandmothers
was all billy-o.</p>

<p>The second thing was that this war was going to come as a mighty
surprise to Britain. Karolides’ death would set the Balkans by
the ears, and then Vienna would chip in with an ultimatum. Russia
wouldn’t like that, and there would be high words. But Berlin
would play the peacemaker, and pour oil on the waters, till suddenly
she would find a good cause for a quarrel, pick it up, and in
five hours let fly at us. That was the idea, and a pretty good
one too. Honey and fair speeches, and then a stroke in the dark.
While we were talking about the goodwill and good intentions of
Germany our coast would be silently ringed with mines, and submarines
would be waiting for every battleship.</p>

<p>But all this depended upon the third thing, which was due to
happen on June 15th. I would never have grasped this if I hadn’t
once happened to meet a French staff officer, coming back from
West Africa, who had told me a lot of things. One was that, in
spite of all the nonsense talked in Parliament, there was a real
working alliance between France and Britain, and that the two
General Staffs met every now and then, and made plans for joint
action in case of war. Well, in June a very great swell was coming
over from Paris, and he was going to get nothing less than a statement
of the disposition of the British Home Fleet on mobilization.
At least I gathered it was something like that; anyhow, it was
something uncommonly important.</p>

<p>But on the 15th day of June there were to be others in London—others,
at whom I could only guess. Scudder was content to call them collectively
the "Black Stone". They represented not our Allies, but our deadly
foes; and the information, destined for France, was to be diverted
to their pockets. And it was to be used, remember—used a week
or two later, with great guns and swift torpedoes, suddenly in
the darkness of a summer night.</p>

<p>This was the story I had been deciphering in a back room of a
country inn, overlooking a cabbage garden. This was the story
that hummed in my brain as I swung in the big touring-car from
glen to glen.</p>

<p>My first impulse had been to write a letter to the Prime Minister,
but a little reflection convinced me that that would be useless.
Who would believe my tale? I must show a sign, some token in proof,
and Heaven knew what that could be. Above all, I must keep going
myself, ready to act when things got riper, and that was going
to be no light job with the police of the British Isles in full
cry after me and the watchers of the Black Stone running silently
and swiftly on my trail.</p>

<p>I had no very clear purpose in my journey, but I steered east
by the sun, for I remembered from the map that if I went north
I would come into a region of coalpits and industrial towns. Presently
I was down from the moorlands and traversing the broad haugh of
a river. For miles I ran alongside a park wall, and in a break
of the trees I saw a great castle. I swung through little old
thatched villages, and over peaceful lowland streams, and past
gardens blazing with hawthorn and yellow laburnum. The land was
so deep in peace that I could scarcely believe that somewhere
behind me were those who sought my life; ay, and that in a month’s
time, unless I had the almightiest of luck, these round country
faces would be pinched and staring, and men would be lying dead
in English fields.</p>

<p>About midday I entered a long straggling village, and had a mind
to stop and eat. Half-way down was the Post Office, and on the
steps of it stood the postmistress and a policeman hard at work
conning a telegram. When they saw me they wakened up, and the
policeman advanced with raised hand, and cried on me to stop.</p>

<p>I nearly was fool enough to obey. Then it flashed upon me that
the wire had to do with me; that my friends at the inn had come
to an understanding, and were united in desiring to see more of
me, and that it had been easy enough for them to wire the description
of me and the car to thirty villages through which I might pass.
I released the brakes just in time. As it was, the policeman made
a claw at the hood, and only dropped off when he got my left in
his eye.</p>

<p>I saw that main roads were no place for me, and turned into the
byways. It wasn’t an easy job without a map, for there was the
risk of getting on to a farm road and ending in a duck-pond or
a stable-yard, and I couldn’t afford that kind of delay. I began
to see what an ass I had been to steal the car. The big green
brute would be the safest kind of clue to me over the breadth
of Scotland. If I left it and took to my feet, it would be discovered
in an hour or two and I would get no start in the race.</p>

<p>The immediate thing to do was to get to the loneliest roads.
These I soon found when I struck up a tributary of the big river,
and got into a glen with steep hills all about me, and a corkscrew
road at the end which climbed over a pass. Here I met nobody,
but it was taking me too far north, so I slewed east along a bad
track and finally struck a big double-line railway. Away below
me I saw another broadish valley, and it occurred to me that if
I crossed it I might find some remote inn to pass the night. The
evening was now drawing in, and I was furiously hungry, for I
had eaten nothing since breakfast except a couple of buns I had
bought from a baker’s cart.</p>

<p>Just then I heard a noise in the sky, and lo and behold there
was that infernal aeroplane, flying low, about a dozen miles to
the south and rapidly coming towards me.</p>

<p>I had the sense to remember that on a bare moor I was at the
aeroplane’s mercy, and that my only chance was to get to the leafy
cover of the valley. Down the hill I went like blue lightning,
screwing my head round, whenever I dared, to watch that damned
flying machine. Soon I was on a road between hedges, and dipping
to the deep-cut glen of a stream. Then came a bit of thick wood
where I slackened speed.</p>

<p>Suddenly on my left I heard the hoot of another car, and realized
to my horror that I was almost up on a couple of gate-posts through
which a private road debouched on the highway. My horn gave an
agonized roar, but it was too late. I clapped on my brakes, but
my impetus was too great, and there before me a car was sliding
athwart my course. In a second there would have been the deuce
of a wreck. I did the only thing possible, and ran slap into the
hedge on the right, trusting to find something soft beyond.</p>

<p>But there I was mistaken. My car slithered through the hedge
like butter, and then gave a sickening plunge forward. I saw what
was coming, leapt on the seat and would have jumped out. But a
branch of hawthorn got me in the chest, lifted me up and held
me, while a ton or two of expensive metal slipped below me, bucked
and pitched, and then dropped with an almighty smash fifty feet
to the bed of the stream.</p>

<p>Slowly that thorn let me go. I subsided first on the hedge, and
then very gently on a bower of nettles. As I scrambled to my feet
a hand took me by the arm, and a sympathetic and badly scared
voice asked me if I were hurt.</p>

<p>I found myself looking at a tall young man in goggles and a leather
ulster, who kept on blessing his soul and whinnying apologies.
For myself, once I got my wind back, I was rather glad than otherwise.
This was one way of getting rid of the car.</p>

<p>"My blame, sir," I answered him. "It’s lucky that I did not add
homicide to my follies. That’s the end of my Scotch motor tour,
but it might have been the end of my life."</p>

<p>He plucked out a watch and studied it. "You’re the right sort
of fellow," he said. "I can spare a quarter of an hour, and my
house is two minutes off. I’ll see you clothed and fed and snug
in bed. Where’s your kit, by the way? Is it in the burn along
with the car?"</p>

<p>"It’s in my pocket," I said, brandishing a toothbrush. "I’m a
colonial and travel light."</p>

<p>"A colonial," he cried. "By Gad, you’re the very man I’ve been
praying for. Are you by any blessed chance a Free Trader?"</p>

<p>"I am," said I, without the foggiest notion of what he meant.</p>

<p>He patted my shoulder and hurried me into his car. Three minutes
later we drew up before a comfortable-looking shooting-box set
among pine trees, and he ushered me indoors. He took me first
to a bedroom and flung half a dozen of his suits before me, for
my own had been pretty well reduced to rags. I selected a loose
blue serge, which differed most conspicuously from my former garments,
and borrowed a linen collar. Then he haled me to the dining-room,
where the remnants of a meal stood on the table, and announced
that I had just five minutes to feed. "You can take a snack in
your pocket, and we’ll have supper when we get back. I’ve got
to be at the Masonic Hall at eight o’clock, or my agent will comb
my hair."</p>

<p>I had a cup of coffee and some cold ham, while he yarned away
on the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"You find me in the deuce of a mess, Mr ——; by-the-by, you haven’t
told me your name. Twisdon? Any relation of old Tommy Twisdon
of the Sixtieth? No? Well, you see I’m Liberal Candidate for this
part of the world, and I had a meeting on tonight at Brattleburn—that’s
my chief town, and an infernal Tory stronghold. I had got the
Colonial ex-Premier fellow, Crumpleton, coming to speak for me
tonight, and had the thing tremendously billed and the whole place
ground-baited. This afternoon I had a wire from the ruffian saying
he had got influenza at Blackpool, and here am I left to do the
whole thing myself. I had meant to speak for ten minutes and must
now go on for forty, and, though I’ve been racking my brains for
three hours to think of something, I simply cannot last the course.
Now you’ve got to be a good chap and help me. You’re a Free Trader
and can tell our people what a wash-out Protection is in the Colonies.
All you fellows have the gift of the gab—I wish to Heaven I had
it. I’ll be for evermore in your debt."</p>

<p>I had very few notions about Free Trade one way or the other,
but I saw no other chance to get what I wanted. My young gentleman
was far too absorbed in his own difficulties to think how odd
it was to ask a stranger who had just missed death by an ace and
had lost a 1,000-guinea car to address a meeting for him on the
spur of the moment. But my necessities did not allow me to contemplate
oddnesses or to pick and choose my supports.</p>

<p>"All right," I said. "I’m not much good as a speaker, but I’ll
tell them a bit about Australia."</p>

<p>At my words the cares of the ages slipped from his shoulders,
and he was rapturous in his thanks. He lent me a big driving coat—and
never troubled to ask why I had started on a motor tour without
possessing an ulster—and, as we slipped down the dusty roads,
poured into my ears the simple facts of his history. He was an
orphan, and his uncle had brought him up—I’ve forgotten the uncle’s
name, but he was in the Cabinet, and you can read his speeches
in the papers. He had gone round the world after leaving Cambridge,
and then, being short of a job, his uncle had advised politics.
I gathered that he had no preference in parties. "Good chaps in
both," he said cheerfully, "and plenty of blighters, too. I’m
Liberal, because my family have always been Whigs." But if he
was lukewarm politically he had strong views on other things.
He found out I knew a bit about horses, and jawed away about the
Derby entries; and he was full of plans for improving his shooting.
Altogether, a very clean, decent, callow young man.</p>

<p>As we passed through a little town two policemen signalled us
to stop, and flashed their lanterns on us.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Sir Harry," said one. "We’ve got instructions to
look out for a car, and the description’s no unlike yours."</p>

<p>"Right-o," said my host, while I thanked Providence for the devious
ways I had been brought to safety. After that he spoke no more,
for his mind began to labour heavily with his coming speech. His
lips kept muttering, his eye wandered, and I began to prepare
myself for a second catastrophe. I tried to think of something
to say myself, but my mind was dry as a stone. The next thing
I knew we had drawn up outside a door in a street, and were being
welcomed by some noisy gentlemen with rosettes.</p>

<p>The hall had about five hundred in it, women mostly, a lot of
bald heads, and a dozen or two young men. The chairman, a weaselly
minister with a reddish nose, lamented Crumpleton’s absence, soliloquized
on his influenza, and gave me a certificate as a "trusted leader
of Australian thought". There were two policemen at the door,
and I hoped they took note of that testimonial. Then Sir Harry
started.</p>

<p>I never heard anything like it. He didn’t begin to know how to
talk. He had about a bushel of notes from which he read, and when
he let go of them he fell into one prolonged stutter. Every now
and then he remembered a phrase he had learned by heart, straightened
his back, and gave it off like Henry Irving, and the next moment
he was bent double and crooning over his papers. It was the most
appalling rot, too. He talked about the "German menace", and said
it was all a Tory invention to cheat the poor of their rights
and keep back the great flood of social reform, but that "organized
labour" realized this and laughed the Tories to scorn. He was
all for reducing our Navy as a proof of our good faith, and then
sending Germany an ultimatum telling her to do the same or we
would knock her into a cocked hat. He said that, but for the Tories,
Germany and Britain would be fellow-workers in peace and reform.
I thought of the little black book in my pocket! A giddy lot Scudder’s
friends cared for peace and reform.</p>

<p>Yet in a queer way I liked the speech. You could see the niceness
of the chap shining out behind the muck with which he had been
spoon-fed. Also it took a load off my mind. I mightn’t be much
of an orator, but I was a thousand per cent better than Sir Harry.</p>

<p>I didn’t get on so badly when it came to my turn. I simply told
them all I could remember about Australia, praying there should
be no Australian there—all about its labour party and emigration
and universal service. I doubt if I remembered to mention Free
Trade, but I said there were no Tories in Australia, only Labour
and Liberals. That fetched a cheer, and I woke them up a bit when
I started in to tell them the kind of glorious business I thought
could be made out of the Empire if we really put our backs into
it.</p>

<p>Altogether I fancy I was rather a success. The minister didn’t
like me, though, and when he proposed a vote of thanks, spoke
of Sir Harry’s speech as "statesmanlike" and mine as having "the
eloquence of an emigration agent."</p>

<p>When we were in the car again my host was in wild spirits at
having got his job over. "A ripping speech, Twisdon," he said.
"Now, you’re coming home with me. I’m all alone, and if you’ll
stop a day or two I’ll show you some very decent fishing."</p>

<p>We had a hot supper—and I wanted it pretty badly—and then drank
grog in a big cheery smoking-room with a crackling wood fire.
I thought the time had come for me to put my cards on the table.
I saw by this man’s eye that he was the kind you can trust.</p>

<p>"Listen, Sir Harry," I said. "I’ve something pretty important
to say to you. You’re a good fellow, and I’m going to be frank.
Where on earth did you get that poisonous rubbish you talked tonight?"</p>

<p>His face fell. "Was it as bad as that?" he asked ruefully. "It
did sound rather thin. I got most of it out of the <em>Progressive
Magazine</em> and pamphlets that agent chap of mine keeps sending
me. But you surely don’t think Germany would ever go to war with
us?"</p>

<p>"Ask that question in six weeks and it won’t need an answer,"
I said. "If you’ll give me your attention for half an hour I am
going to tell you a story."</p>

<p>I can see yet that bright room with the deers’ heads and the
old prints on the walls, Sir Harry standing restlessly on the
stone curb of the hearth, and myself lying back in an armchair,
speaking. I seemed to be another person, standing aside and listening
to my own voice, and judging carefully the reliability of my tale.
It was the first time I had ever told anyone the exact truth,
so far as I understood it, and it did me no end of good, for it
straightened out the thing in my own mind. I blinked no detail.
He heard all about Scudder, and the milkman, and the note-book,
and my doings in Galloway. Presently he got very excited and walked
up and down the hearthrug.</p>

<p>"So you see," I concluded, "you have got here in your house the
man that is wanted for the Portland Place murder. Your duty is
to send your car for the police and give me up. I don’t think
I’ll get very far. There’ll be an accident, and I’ll have a knife
in my ribs an hour or so after arrest. Nevertheless, it’s your
duty, as a law-abiding citizen. Perhaps in a month’s time you’ll
be sorry, but you have no cause to think of that."</p>

<p>He was looking at me with bright steady eyes. "What was your
job in Rhodesia, Mr Hannay?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mining engineer," I said. "I’ve made my pile cleanly and I’ve
had a good time in the making of it."</p>

<p>"Not a profession that weakens the nerves, is it?"</p>

<p>I laughed. "Oh, as to that, my nerves are good enough." I took
down a hunting-knife from a stand on the wall, and did the old
Mashona trick of tossing it and catching it in my lips. That wants
a pretty steady heart.</p>

<p>He watched me with a smile. "I don’t want proofs. I may be an
ass on the platform, but I can size up a man. You’re no murderer
and you’re no fool, and I believe you are speaking the truth.
I’m going to back you up. Now, what can I do?"</p>

<p>"First, I want you to write a letter to your uncle. I’ve got
to get in touch with the Government people sometime before the
15th of June."</p>

<p>He pulled his moustache. "That won’t help you. This is Foreign
Office business, and my uncle would have nothing to do with it.
Besides, you’d never convince him. No, I’ll go one better. I’ll
write to the Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office. He’s my
godfather, and one of the best going. What do you want?"</p>

<p>He sat down at a table and wrote to my dictation. The gist of
it was that if a man called Twisdon (I thought I had better stick
to that name) turned up before June 15th he was to entreat him
kindly. He said Twisdon would prove his <em>bona fides</em> by
passing the word "Black Stone" and whistling "Annie Laurie".</p>

<p>"Good," said Sir Harry. "That’s the proper style. By the way,
you’ll find my godfather—his name’s Sir Walter Bullivant—down
at his country cottage for Whitsuntide. It’s close to Artinswell
on the Kennet. That’s done. Now, what’s the next thing?"</p>

<p>"You’re about my height. Lend me the oldest tweed suit you’ve
got. Anything will do, so long as the colour is the opposite of
the clothes I destroyed this afternoon. Then show me a map of
the neighbourhood and explain to me the lie of the land. Lastly,
if the police come seeking me, just show them the car in the glen.
If the other lot turn up, tell them I caught the south express
after your meeting."</p>

<p>He did, or promised to do, all these things. I shaved off the
remnants of my moustache, and got inside an ancient suit of what
I believe is called heather mixture. The map gave me some notion
of my whereabouts, and told me the two things I wanted to know—where
the main railway to the south could be joined, and what were the
wildest districts near at hand.</p>

<p>At two o’clock he wakened me from my slumbers in the smoking-room
armchair, and led me blinking into the dark starry night. An old
bicycle was found in a tool-shed and handed over to me.</p>

<p>"First turn to the right up by the long fir-wood," he enjoined.
"By daybreak you’ll be well into the hills. Then I should pitch
the machine into a bog and take to the moors on foot. You can
put in a week among the shepherds, and be as safe as if you were
in New Guinea."</p>

<p>I pedalled diligently up steep roads of hill gravel till the
skies grew pale with morning. As the mists cleared before the
sun, I found myself in a wide green world with glens falling on
every side and a far-away blue horizon. Here, at any rate, I could
get early news of my enemies.</p>
