<p><em>FOURTEEN</em></p>

<p>That afternoon we had a scene, and late that night another. The
memory of the former is a little blotted out. Things began to
move so quickly that, try as I will to arrange their sequence
in my mind, I cannot. I cannot even very distinctly remember what
she told me at that first explanation. I must have attacked her
fiercely&mdash;on the score of de Mersch, in the old vein; must have
told her that I would not in the interest of the name allow her
to see the man again. She told me things, too, rather abominable
things, about the way in which she had got Halderschrodt into
her power and was pressing him down. Halderschrodt was de Mersch's
banker-in-chief; his fall would mean de Mersch's, and so on. The
"so on" in this case meant a great deal more. Halderschrodt, apparently,
was the "somebody who was up to something" of the American paper&mdash;that
is to say the allied firms that Halderschrodt represented. I can't
remember the details. They were too huge and too unfamiliar, and
I was too agitated by my own share in the humanity of it. But,
in sum, it seemed that the fall of Halderschrodt would mean a
sort of incredibly vast Black Monday&mdash;a frightful thing in the
existing state of public confidence, but one which did not mean
much to me. I forget how she said she had been able to put the
screw on him. Halderschrodt, as you must remember, was the third
of his colossal name, a man without much genius and conscious
of the lack, obsessed with the idea of operating some enormous
coup, like the founder of his dynasty, something in which foresight
in international occurrence played a chief part. That idea was
his weakness, the defect of his mind, and she had played on that
weakness. I forget, I say, the details, if I ever heard them;
they concerned themselves with a dynastic revolution somewhere,
a revolution that was to cause a slump all over the world, and
that had been engineered in our Salon. And she had burked the
revolution&mdash;betrayed it, I suppose&mdash;and the consequences did not
ensue, and Halderschrodt and all the rest of them were left high
and dry.</p>

<p>The whole thing was a matter of under-currents that never came
to the surface, a matter of shifting sands from which only those
with the clearest heads could come forth.</p>

<p>"And we ... we have clear heads," she said. It was impossible
to listen to her without shuddering. For me, if he stood for anything,
Halderschrodt stood for stability; there was the tremendous name,
and there was the person I had just seen, the person on whom a
habit of mind approaching almost to the royal had conferred a
presence that had some of the divinity that hedges a king. It
seemed frightful merely to imagine his ignominious collapse; as
frightful as if she had pointed out a splendid-limbed man and
said: "That man will be dead in five minutes." That, indeed, was
what she said of Halderschrodt.... The man had saluted her, going
to his death; the austere inclination that I had seen had been
the salutation of such a man.</p>

<p>I was so moved by one thing and another that I hardly noticed
that Gurnard had come into the room. I had not seen him since
the night when he had dined with the Duc de Mersch at Churchill's,
but he seemed so part of the emotion, of the frame of mind, that
he slid noiselessly into the scene and hardly surprised me. I
was called out of the room&mdash;someone desired to see me, and I passed,
without any transition of feeling, into the presence of an entire
stranger&mdash;a man who remains a voice to me. He began to talk to
me about the state of my aunt's health. He said she was breaking
up; that he begged respectfully to urge that I would use my influence
to take her back to London to consult Sir James &mdash;I, perhaps,
living in the house and not having known my aunt for very long,
might not see; but he ... He was my aunt's solicitor. He was quite
right; my aunt <em>was</em> breaking up, she had declined visibly
in the few hours that I had been away from her. She had been doing
business with this man, had altered her will, had seen Mr. Gurnard;
and, in some way had received a shock that seemed to have deprived
her of all volition. She sat with her head leaning back, her eyes
closed, the lines of her face all seeming to run downward.</p>

<p>"It is obvious to me that arrangements ought to be made for your
return to England," the lawyer said, "whatever engagements Miss
Granger or Mr. Etchingham Granger or even Mr. Gurnard may have
made."</p>

<p>I wondered vaguely what the devil Mr. Gurnard could have to say
in the matter, and then Miss Granger herself came into the room.</p>

<p>"They want me," my aunt said in a low voice, "they have been
persuading me ... to go back ... to Etchingham, I think you said,
Meredith."</p>

<p>I became conscious that I wanted to return to England, wanted
it very much, wanted to be out of this; to get somewhere where
there was stability and things that one could understand. Everything
here seemed to be in a mist, with the ground trembling underfoot.</p>

<p>"Why ..." Miss Granger's verdict came, "we can go when you like.
To-morrow."</p>

<p>Things immediately began to shape themselves on these unexpected
lines, a sort of bustle of departure to be in the air. I was employed
to conduct the lawyer as far as the porter's lodge, a longish
traverse. He beguiled the way by excusing himself for hurrying
back to London.</p>

<p>"I might have been of use; in these hurried departures there
are generally things. But, you will understand, Mr. &mdash;Mr.
Etchingham; at a time like this I could hardly spare the hours
that it cost me to come over. You would be astonished what a deal
of extra work it gives and how far-spreading the evil is. People
seem to have gone mad. Even I have been astonished."</p>

<p>"I had no idea," I said.</p>

<p>"Of course not, of course not&mdash;no one had. But, unless I am much
mistaken&mdash;<em>much</em>&mdash;there will have to be an enquiry, and
people will be very lucky who have had nothing to do with it ..."</p>

<p>I gathered that things were in a bad way, over there as over
here; that there were scandals and a tremendous outcry for purification
in the highest places. I saw the man get into his fiacre and took
my way back across the court-yard rather slowly, pondering over
the part I was to fill in the emigration, wondering how far events
had conferred on me a partnership in the family affairs.</p>

<p>I found that my tacitly acknowledged function was that of supervising
nurse-tender, the sort of thing that made for personal tenderness
in the aridity of profuse hired help. I was expected to arrange
a rug just a <em>little</em> more comfortably than the lady's
maid who would travel in the compartment&mdash;to give the finishing
touches.</p>

<p>It was astonishing how well the thing was engineered; the removal,
I mean. It gave me an even better idea of the woman my aunt had
been than even the panic of her solicitor. The thing went as smoothly
as the disappearance of a caravan of gypsies, camped for the night
on a heath beside gorse bushes. We went to the ball that night
as if from a household that had its roots deep in the solid rock,
and in the morning we had disappeared.</p>

<p>The ball itself was a finishing touch&mdash;the finishing touch of
my sister's affairs and the end of my patience. I spent an interminable
night, one of those nights that never end and that remain quivering
and raw in the memory. I seemed to be in a blaze of light, watching,
through a shifting screen of shimmering dresses&mdash;her and the Duc
de Mersch. I don't know whether the thing was really noticeable,
but it seemed that everyone was&mdash;that everyone must be&mdash;remarking
it. I thought I caught women making smile-punctuated remarks behind
fans, men answering inaudibly with eyes discreetly on the ground.
It was a mixed assembly, somebody's liquidation of social obligations,
and there was a sprinkling of the kind of people who do make remarks.
It was not the noticeability for its own sake that I hated, but
the fact that their relations by their noticeability made me impossible,
whilst the notice itself confirmed my own fears. I hung, glowering
in corners, noticeable enough myself, I suppose.</p>

<p>The thing reached a crisis late in the evening. There was a kind
of winter-garden that one strolled in, a place of giant palms
stretching up into a darkness of intense shadow. I was prowling
about in the shadows of great metallic leaves, cursing under my
breath, in a fury of nervous irritation; quivering like a horse
martyrised by a stupidly merciless driver. I happened to stand
back for a moment in the narrowest of paths, with the touch of
spiky leaves on my hand and on my face. In front of me was the
glaring perspective of one of the longer alleys, and, stepping
into it, a great band of blue ribbon cutting across his chest,
came de Mersch with her upon his arm. De Mersch himself hardly
counted. He had a way of glowing, but he paled ineffectual fires
beside her m√¶nadic glow. There was something overpowering in the
sight of her, in the fire of her eyes, in the glow of her coils
of hair, in the poise of her head. She wore some kind of early
nineteenth-century dress, sweeping low from the waist with a tenderness
of fold that affected one with delicate pathos, that had a virgin
quality of almost poignant intensity. And beneath it she stepped
with the buoyancy&mdash;the long steps&mdash;of a triumphing Diana.</p>

<p>It was more than terrible for me to stand there longing with
a black, baffled longing, with some of the base quality of an
eavesdropper and all the baseness of the unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Then Gurnard loomed in the distance, moving insensibly down the
long, glaring corridor, a sinister figure, suggesting in the silence
of his oncoming the motionless flight of a vulture. Well within
my field of sight he overtook them and, with a lack of preliminary
greeting that suggested supreme intimacy, walked beside them.
I stood for some moments&mdash;for some minutes, and then hastened
after them. I was going to do something. After a time I found
de Mersch and Gurnard standing facing each other in one of the
doorways of the place &mdash;Gurnard, a small, dark, impassive
column; de Mersch, bulky, overwhelming, florid, standing with
his legs well apart and speaking vociferously with a good deal
of gesture. I approached them from the side, standing rather insistently
at his elbow.</p>

<p>"I want," I said, "I would be extremely glad if you would give
me a minute, monsieur." I was conscious that I spoke with a tremour
of the voice, a sort of throaty eagerness. I was unaware of what
course I was to pursue, but I was confident of calmness, of self-control
&mdash;I was equal to that. They had a pause of surprised silence.
Gurnard wheeled and fixed me critically with his eye-glass. I
took de Mersch a little apart, into a solitude of palm branches,
and began to speak before he had asked me my errand.</p>

<p>"You must understand that I would not interfere without a good
deal of provocation," I was saying, when he cut me short, speaking
in a thick, jovial voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, we will understand that, my good Granger, and then ..."</p>

<p>"It is about my sister," I said&mdash;"you&mdash;you go too far. I must
ask you, as a gentleman, to cease persecuting her."</p>

<p>He answered "The devil!" and then: "If I do not<hr>?"</p>

<p>It was evident in his voice, in his manner, that the man was
a little&mdash;well, <em>gris</em>. "If you do not," I said, "I shall
forbid her to see you and I shall ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" he interjected with the intonation of a reveller at
a farce. "We are at that&mdash;we are the excellent brother." He paused,
and then added: "Well, go to the devil, you and your forbidding."
He spoke with the greatest good humour.</p>

<p>"I am in earnest," I said; "very much in earnest. The thing has
gone too far, and even for your own sake, you had better ..."</p>

<p>He said "Ah, ah!" in the tone of his "Oh, oh!"</p>

<p>"She is no friend to you," I struggled on, "she is playing with
you for her own purposes; you will ..."</p>

<p>He swayed a little on his feet and said: "Bravo ... bravissimo.
If we can't forbid him, we will frighten him. Go on, my good fellow
..." and then, "Come, go on ..."</p>

<p>I looked at his great bulk of a body. It came into my head dimly
that I wanted him to strike me, to give me an excuse&mdash;anything
to end the scene violently, with a crash and exclamations of fury.</p>

<p>"You absolutely refuse to pay any attention?" I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, absolutely," he answered.</p>

<p>"You know that I can do something, that I can expose you." I
had a vague idea that I could, that the number of small things
that I knew to his discredit and the mass of my hatred could be
welded into a damning whole. He laughed a high-pitched, hysterical
laugh. The dawn was beginning to spread pallidly above us, gleaming
mournfully through the glass of the palm-house. People began to
pass, muffled up, on their way out of the place.</p>

<p>"You may go ..." he was beginning. But the expression of his
face altered. Miss Granger, muffled up like all the rest of the
world, was coming out of the inner door. "We have been having
a charming ..." he began to her. She touched me gently on the
arm.</p>

<p>"Come, Arthur," she said, and then to him, "You have heard the
news?"</p>

<p>He looked at her rather muzzily.</p>

<p>"Baron Halderschrodt has committed suicide," she said. "Come,
Arthur."</p>

<p>We passed on slowly, but de Mersch followed.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you aren't in <em>earnest</em>?" he said, catching at her
arm so that we swung round and faced him. There was a sort of
mad entreaty in his eyes, as if he hoped that by unsaying she
could remedy an irremediable disaster, and there was nothing left
of him but those panic-stricken, beseeching eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Sabran told me," she answered; "he had just come
from making the <em>constatation</em>. Besides, you can hear ..."</p>

<p>Half-sentences came to our ears from groups that passed us. A
very old man with a nose that almost touched his thick lips, was
saying to another of the same type:</p>

<p>"Shot himself ... through the left temple ... <em>Mon Dieu</em>!"</p>

<p>De Mersch walked slowly down the long corridor away from us.
There was an extraordinary stiffness in his gait, as if he were
trying to emulate the goose step of his days in the Prussian Guard.
My companion looked after him as though she wished to gauge the
extent of his despair.</p>

<p>"You would say '<em>Habet</em>,' wouldn't you?" she asked me.</p>

<p>I thought we had seen the last of him, but as in the twilight
of the dawn we waited for the lodge gates to open, a furious clatter
of hoofs came down the long street, and a carriage drew level
with ours. A moment after, de Mersch was knocking at our window.</p>

<p>"You will ... you will ..." he stuttered, "speak ... to Mr. Gurnard.
That is our only chance ... now." His voice came in mingled with
the cold air of the morning. I shivered. "You have so much power
... with him and...."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ..." she answered.</p>

<p>"The thing must go through," he said again, "or else ..." He
paused. The great gates in front of us swung noiselessly open,
one saw into the court-yard. The light was growing stronger. She
did not answer.</p>

<p>"I tell you," he asseverated insistently, "if the British Government
abandons my railway <em>all</em> our plans ..."</p>

<p>"Oh, the Government won't <em>abandon</em> it," she said, with
a little emphasis on the verb. He stepped back out of range of
the wheels, and we turned in and left him standing there.</p>

<hr>
<p>In the great room which was usually given up to the political
plotters stood a table covered with eatables and lit by a pair
of candles in tall silver sticks. I was conscious of a raging
hunger and of a fierce excitement that made the thought of sleep
part of a past of phantoms. I began to eat unconsciously, pacing
up and down the while. She was standing beside the table in the
glow of the transparent light. Pallid blue lines showed in the
long windows. It was very cold and hideously late; away in those
endless small hours when the pulse drags, when the clock-beat
drags, when time is effaced.</p>

<p>"You see?" she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I see," I answered&mdash;"and ... and now?"</p>

<p>"Now we are almost done with each other," she answered.</p>

<p>I felt a sudden mental falling away. I had never looked at things
in that way, had never really looked things in the face. I had
grown so used to the idea that she was to parcel out the remainder
of my life, had grown so used to the feeling that I was the integral
portion of her life ... "But <em>I&mdash;" I </em>said, "What is to
become of me?"</p>

<p>She stood looking down at the ground ... for a long time. At
last she said in a low monotone:</p>

<p>"Oh, you must try to forget."</p>

<p>A new idea struck me&mdash;luminously, overwhelming. I grew reckless.
"You&mdash;you are growing considerate," I taunted. "You are not so
sure, not so cold. I notice a change in you. Upon my soul ..."</p>

<p>Her eyes dilated suddenly, and as suddenly closed again. She
said nothing. I grew conscious of unbearable pain, the pain of
returning life. She was going away. I should be alone. The future
began to exist again, looming up like a vessel through thick mist,
silent, phantasmal, overwhelming&mdash;a hideous future of irremediable
remorse, of solitude, of craving.</p>

<p>"You are going back to work with Churchill," she said suddenly.</p>

<p>"How did you know?" I asked breathlessly. My despair of a sort
found vent in violent interjecting of an immaterial query.</p>

<p>"You leave your letters about," she said, "and.... It will be
best for you."</p>

<p>"It will not," I said bitterly. "It could never be the same.
I don't want to see Churchill. I want...."</p>

<p>"You want?" she asked, in a low monotone.</p>

<p>"You," I answered.</p>

<p>She spoke at last, very slowly:</p>

<p>"Oh, as for me, I am going to marry Gurnard."</p>

<p>I don't know just what I said then, but I remember that I found
myself repeating over and over again, the phrases running metrically
up and down my mind: "You couldn't marry Gurnard; you don't know
what he is. You couldn't marry Gurnard; you don't know what he
is." I don't suppose that I knew anything to the discredit of
Gurnard&mdash;but he struck me in that way at that moment; struck me
convincingly&mdash;more than any array of facts could have done.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;as for what he is&mdash;" she said, and paused. "<em>I</em> know...."
and then suddenly she began to speak very fast.</p>

<p>"Don't you see?&mdash;<em>can't</em> you see?&mdash;that I don't marry
Gurnard for what he is in that sense, but for what he is in the
other. It isn't a marriage in your sense at all. And ... and it
doesn't affect you ... don't you <em>see</em>? We have to have
done with one another, because ... because...."</p>

<p>I had an inspiration.</p>

<p>"I believe," I said, very slowly, "I believe ... you <em>do</em>
care...."</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>"You care," I repeated.</p>

<p>She spoke then with an energy that had something of a threat
in it. "Do you think I would? Do you think I could?... or dare?
Don't you understand?" She faltered&mdash;"but then...." she added,
and was silent for a long minute. I felt the throb of a thousand
pulses in my head, on my temples. "Oh, yes, I care," she said
slowly, "but that&mdash;that makes it all the worse. Why, yes, I care&mdash;yes,
yes. It hurts me to see you. I might.... It would draw me away.
I have my allotted course. And you &mdash;Don't you see, you would
influence me; you would be&mdash;you <em>are</em>&mdash;a disease&mdash;for me."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "I could &mdash;I would&mdash;do anything."</p>

<p>I had only the faintest of ideas of what I would do&mdash;for her
sake.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," she said, "you must not say that. You don't understand....
Even that would mean misery for you&mdash;and I &mdash;I could not
bear. Don't you see? Even now, before you have done your allotted
part, I am wanting&mdash;oh, wanting&mdash;to let you go.... But I must
not; I must not. You must go on ... and bear it for a little while
more&mdash;and then...."</p>

<p>There was a tension somewhere, a string somewhere that was stretched
tight and vibrating. I was tremulous with an excitement that overmastered
my powers of speech, that surpassed my understanding.</p>

<p>"Don't you see ..." she asked again, "you are the past&mdash;the passing.
We could never meet. You are ... for me ... only the portrait
of a man&mdash;of a man who has been dead&mdash;oh, a long time; and I,
for you, only a possibility ... a conception.... You work to bring
me on&mdash;to make me possible."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" I said. The idea was so difficult to grasp. "I will&mdash;there
must be a way&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, "there is no way&mdash;you must go back; must
try. There will be Churchill and what he stands for &mdash;He
won't die, he won't even care much for losing this game ... not
much.... And you will have to forget me. There is no other way&mdash;no
bridge. We can't meet, you and I...."</p>

<p>The words goaded me to fury. I began to pace furiously up and
down. I wanted to tell her that I would throw away everything
for her, would crush myself out, would be a lifeless tool, would
do anything. But I could tear no words out of the stone that seemed
to surround me.</p>

<p>"You may even tell him, if you like, what I and Gurnard are going
to do. It will make no difference; he will fall. But you would
like him to&mdash;to make a good fight for it, wouldn't you? That is
all I can do ... for your sake."</p>

<p>I began to speak&mdash;as if I had not spoken for years. The house
seemed to be coming to life; there were noises of opening doors,
of voices outside.</p>

<p>"I believe you care enough," I said "to give it all up for me.
I believe you do, and I want you." I continued to pace up and
down. The noises of returning day grew loud; frightfully loud.
It was as if I must hasten, must get said what I had to say, as
if I must raise my voice to make it heard amid the clamour of
a world awakening to life.</p>

<p>"I believe you do ... I believe you do...." I said again and
again, "and I want you." My voice rose higher and higher. She
stood motionless, an inscrutable white figure, like some silent
Greek statue, a harmony of falling folds of heavy drapery perfectly
motionless.</p>

<p>"I want you," I said&mdash;"I want you, I want you, I want you." It
was unbearable to myself.</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet," she said at last. "Be quiet! If you had wanted
me I have been here. It is too late. All these days; all these&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But ..." I said.</p>

<p>From without someone opened the great shutters of the windows,
and the light from the outside world burst in upon us.</p>
