<p>While Fred Linden and Terry Clark lay in that part of the cavern
where the floor was of rock, the blanket of Deerfoot was spread
on the earth. Consequently when the Winnebago brought down his
knife with such vicious spitefulness, it went through the folds
of the blanket and was buried to the hilt in the ground underneath.</p>

<p>You know that, despite the marvelous quiet with which the Winnebago
approached the cavern, he was heard by Deerfoot, who, pausing
only long enough to make sure that an enemy was approaching, whisked
outside. There he stood in the impenetrable shadow under the trees,
and saw the Winnebago at the moment he emerged into the faint
moonlight and stood upright.</p>

<p>The first look confirmed his suspicion that it was the Winnebago,
who had come back to avenge himself for the affair of the preceding
day. Deerfoot smiled to himself, for there was a tinge of absurdity
about the whole business that was sure to become still more so.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe paused a few seconds before darting out of the cavern,
until he could arrange his blanket, so that it would appear as
if it infolded his sleeping form, and then he quietly awaited
events.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that it looked like leaving Fred and Terry
in great peril to permit such a savage enemy to creep so close
to them while they were sound asleep; but Deerfoot knew that the
first thing that the Wolf would do would be to attempt his life,
precisely as he did attempt it. Before he could do any thing more,
the Shawanoe concluded to impress his presence upon the visitor.</p>

<p>At the moment, therefore, that the Winnebago stopped his advance
and slowly raised his knife, as he supposed over the breast of
Deerfoot, that gentleman, kneeling on one knee, brought his rifle
to bear upon the Winnebago, the dull light from the fire shining
along the barrel, whose muzzle was within a yard of the unsuspicious
Wolf.</p>

<p>The blanket through which the keen-pointed knife had been driven
was no more firmly transfixed for the moment than was the Wolf
when a slight hissing noise caused him to turn his head, and he
saw the dreaded Shawanoe in a kneeling position with his gun leveled
at him, the finger on the trigger, and the bright eye glancing
along the barrel.</p>

<p>The Winnebago was literally unable to move or speak, and Deerfoot,
motionless himself, held him thus for several seconds. Then with
the gun still pointed, he said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Dog of a Winnebago! Deerfoot has spared the life of the Wolf,
and he now seeks to strike him in the dark."</p>

<p>This address loosened the tongue of the terrified warrior, who,
seeing his captor raise his head from sighting along the barrel,
though he kept the weapon leveled, obeyed the beckoning motion
of Deerfoot, and crept noiselessly out of the cavern. On the alert
for any chance, he was ready to seize it, but the first object
on which his eye rested in the dim moonlight was the figure of
the young Shawanoe holding his gun in such a position, that, should
it be necessary, he could fire like a flash.</p>

<p>Deerfoot would not have hesitated to lay his gun aside, and,
drawing his knife, give the Winnebago the same chance with himself;
but the Wolf had left his weapon where he forced it through the
blanket into the ground, so that he had none except his tomahawk,
and he was not likely to attempt any thing with that.</p>

<p>Besides, while Deerfoot had not the least fear of his enemy,
he did not wish to fight with him. He did not engage in his many
desperate encounters through love of victory, but because it had
seemed to him that it was his duty, and there was no other way
out of the trouble.</p>

<p>It must be said, too, that at this hour the Shawanoe happened
to be in a mood which rendered such encounters more than usually
distasteful to him. After he had closed his Bible and lay on his
face, looking into the embers and meditating, the same thought
that had stirred him many a time before filled his mind again.</p>

<p>Why do men strive to kill each other?</p>

<p>It was a question which has puzzled many a wise man in the past
and has not yet been answered. Thousands of affectionate husbands
unlock the white arms of the loving little children from their
necks, kiss the heartbroken wife good-by, and then rush out to
try to murder one whom they have never seen, who has also just
torn himself loose from his family. There is something in the
thought that mystifies beyond all explanation.</p>

<p>The problem which directly interested Deerfoot was whether the
day would not come when the red men of every tribe could meet
the pale faces in friendship instead of hatred. Why should they
always be at war? Could he do a little to bring about that day
of universal peace? Was there not some work which the Great Spirit
had laid out for him by which he could help to soften the feeling
of the two peoples toward each other?</p>

<p>But Deerfoot had asked himself the same question many a time
before, and the only answer was that the most he could do was
to follow the light within him: that is, aid to remove a part
of the antagonism between the two races.</p>

<p>Alas, too, that while he was considering the question, his ear
caught the soft rustle that told him one of his own race was seeking
his life. Deerfoot was sorrowed more than angered. He wished that
the Winnebago had taken some other time to make his stealthy attack.</p>

<p>Joined to this emotion was that of another akin to sympathy for
the Winnebago in his complete discomfiture. He had come back to
regain his rifle, but not only had failed, but had lost his knife,
and now was standing at the mercy of a Shawanoe young enough to
be his son. The latter resolved that, though the Wolf had earned
death, he would not harm him, unless forced to do so in self-defense.</p>

<p>For half a minute the warriors, with ten feet separating them,
looked straight at each other in silence. Fred Linden and Terry
Clark slept soundly, for as yet there had been no noise sufficient
to awake a light sleeper.</p>

<p>"Why does the Wolf seek the life of Deerfoot?" asked the latter,
willing to relieve the embarrassment of the other.</p>

<p>"The Wolf sought the gun that had been stolen from him."</p>

<p>"But it was not hidden in the blanket, that he should drive his
knife through it."</p>

<p>"The Wolf believed it was," was the curt response.</p>

<p>"Does the Wolf strike with his knife at his own gun?" asked the
Shawanoe, without betraying any emotion.</p>

<p>"He would rather do so than that it should stay in the hands
of an enemy."</p>

<p>"It never would have been in the hands of an enemy had the Wolf
acted as a brave warrior; but he sought the life of the young
pale face who had never done him harm."</p>

<p>"Has not his people stolen the hunting grounds of the red man?"
demanded the Winnebago, who, seeing that some grace was to be
allowed him, burst into the argument that multitudes of his people
have used before and since. Before he could proceed further, Deerfoot
asked: "Are these the hunting grounds of the Winnebagos?"</p>

<p>"They are the hunting grounds of his race, though they may not
be of his totem; Deerfoot should join with his brother the Wolf
in driving the white men into the sea."</p>

<p>"There was a day when that might have been done," replied Deerfoot,
who felt that faint throb and thrill which sometimes came to him,
as if to tell him that his Indian nature was not yet entirely
dead within him; "once the pale faces were but a handful, and
the red men hunted over all the ground that lies between the great
waters. They could have swept the pale faces into the sea, but
they would not be brothers with themselves; they fought each other.
So the pale faces grew, and the day will never come when they
need fear the red men."</p>

<p>"The brave warrior does not ask what can be done, but does with
all his might that which he knows the Great Spirit wishes him
to do."</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit does not tell him to kill his pale face brother;
for they are all His children and He loves them. The Great Spirit
has spoken to Deerfoot and told him that all His children should
love one another."</p>

<p>"Does Deerfoot do so?"</p>

<p>"He does; he never strikes but when the Great Spirit tells him
to do so; if he was the Wolf and the Wolf was Deerfoot, he would
have slain the Shawanoe long ago."</p>

<p>The Winnebago would have denied this had he not seen that it
was idle to do so. What would he not have given at that moment
could he have exchanged places with the handsome and triumphant
young warrior?</p>

<p>"The <em>true</em> Great Spirit loves all His children, whether
they be pale or red or of the color of night; He smiles when they
meet each other as friends, and He will reward in the spirit land
those who do His will on the earth. Let the Wolf bury the words
of Deerfoot in his heart, for they are the words of truth, and
if they are heeded he will be happy &mdash;Go!"</p>

<p>The amazed Winnebago doubted for a moment that he had heard the
command aright; but the wave of the hand which accompanied it,
and the fact that it was in perfect consonance with the words
he had just heard, satisfied him there was no mistake about it.</p>

<p>"The Wolf thanks his brother for what he has done."</p>

<p>The heart of the Winnebago forced the words between his lips
as he turned his face away and walked down the bank of the stream
in the direction whence he came. He vanished the next instant
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not stir until every sound of the soft footsteps
had died out. Then he lowered the hammer of his gun, bent his
shoulders slightly forward, so as to walk freely, and entered
the cavern where his friends were still sleeping.</p>
