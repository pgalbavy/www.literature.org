<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a glorious morning in May. Spring had really come at last
with its warm, life-giving sunshine, and the air was heavy with
the smell of growing things. Overhead the blue sky was clear and
cloudless, underfoot the new grass made a thick carpet invitingly
cool and refreshing. The trees were sporting fresh garlands of
leaves, and in woods and gardens the bright-colored blossoms glowed
and blushed. How beautiful it all was!</p>

<p>Peace paused at Elizabeth's side in the open doorway to drink
in the rich fragrance of the lilacs, whose purple plumes nodded
so temptingly from the hedge across the way. For days it had been
part of her morning program to rush out of doors as soon as she
was dressed to sniff hungrily at the lilac-laden air, but never
before had they smelled so sweet nor looked so beautiful and feathery
as they did this morning, for now they had reached the height
of their perfection. Tomorrow some of their beauty would be gone;
they would be growing old.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elspeth, ain't they lovely?" she sighed. "Don't they make
you feel like heaven? Wouldn't you like a great, big bunch of
them under your nose always? I wonder why the folks who live there
don't give them away. I should if they b'longed to me. Think how
many people would be glad to get them. May I go over in the field
to play? I won't break one of Saint John's plants or touch a single
lilac, truly, if I can just play where I can smell their smell
as it comes fresh from the bush. We only get the wee, ragged edges
of it over here."</p>

<p>Elizabeth came out of her own revery at the sound of Peace's
gusty sigh of longing, and readily gave her consent, as this was
Saturday morning and school did not keep. So, like a bird trying
its wings after a long imprisonment, the brown-eyed maid with
arms flapping and curls bobbing, skipped happily across the road
to the field where she had helped the minister plant a little
vegetable garden, and which already was lined with irregular rows
of pale green shoots where beans and potatoes, turnips and cabbages,
had pushed their way up through the black earth.</p>

<p>Peace was even prouder of the small truck patch than the preacher
himself, if such a thing were possible, and it was a favorite
pastime of both these gardeners to walk back and forth between
the rows each day and count the tender sprouts which had appeared
during the night. So this morning from force of habit, Peace strolled
up and down the length of the garden, counting in a sing-song
fashion as she greedily filled nostrils and lungs with the sweet
scent of the lilac bushes just beyond, drawing nearer and nearer
the hedge with its delicate, dainty sprays.</p>

<p>Unconsciously her counting changed into the humming refrain of
the Gleaner's motto song, and she danced lightly down the last
row of crisp cornblades, joyously chanting words which fitted
into the happy music: "Oh, you pretty lilacs, growing by the wall!
How I'd like to have you for my very own. I would pick your blossoms,
lavender and white, and give them all to sick folks, shut in from
the light. &mdash;Why, that rhymed all of its own self!"</p>

<p>She paused abruptly beside the lilac bushes, her arms still uplifted
and fingers outstretched as if beckoning to the plumy sprays above
her Head. "Isn't it queer how such things will happen when if
I'd been trying to make poetry in my dairy I couldn't have thought
of those words for an hour? I guess it was the lilacs that did
it. Oh, you are so beautiful! You'd make anything rhyme, wouldn't
you? What is it that gives you your sweetness? I wish you could
tell me the secret. Oh, you lovely lilacs, growing up so high;
swinging in the sunshine&mdash;" Again her made-up words came to a
sudden end, and she stood motionless, her head cocked to one side,
listening intently to a brilliant trill of melody from the other
side of the hedge.</p>

<p>"There goes my bird again! Saint John says it must be a canary
which b'longs to the stone house that owns these lilacs, but I
don't b'lieve it would sing like that if it was shut up in a cage."</p>

<p>She held her breath again to harken to the music, then puckered
her lips and mocked its song. The feathered musician broke off
in the midst of his rhapsody, surprised at the strange echo of
his own notes. There was a moment of silence; then he began again,
and once more Peace mimicked the warbler. This time there was
a stir on the other side of the bushes, and the purple-tasseled
branches were cautiously parted where the foliage was thinnest,
but Peace was too much absorbed in watching the topmost boughs&mdash;for
the music seemed to come from overhead somewhere&mdash;to see the startled
eyes looking at her through the tangle of leaves and blossoms.
All unconscious of her hidden audience, she joyously trilled the
canary bird's chorus.</p>

<p>Then miracle of miracles&mdash;or so it seemed to Peace&mdash;there was
a whir of wings, and a bright-eyed, yellow-coated, saucy, little
bird perched on a twig just above her head. Peace gasped and was
silent.</p>

<p>The bird chirped a note of defiance and hopped to the branch
below. Peace advanced a cautious step; the canary did not retreat,
but tipped its dainty head sidewise and eyed the child curiously.
A small brown hand shot out unexpectedly, dexterously, and the
yellow songster found itself a helpless prisoner in the child's
tight grasp.</p>

<p>Peace was almost as surprised as the bird. She had not really
thought to capture the creature so easily, and to find it in her
hand sent a thrill of delight through her whole being. She snuggled
it close in her neck and crooned:</p>

<p>"You little darling! Saint John was right, you <em>are</em> a
canary! But I was right, too. You ain't caged. I'm mighty glad
I've caught you. I always did like pets. I wonder what you will
think of Muffet, grandma's canary? If I just had these lovely
lilacs now, little birdie, I'd be perfectly happy. But a bird
in the hand is worth&mdash;a whole bushel of blossoms. I guess I'll
take you home to Elspeth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't!" cried a distressed voice behind the purple
tassels. "That is my bird, Gypsy. I just let him loose to see
if it was really you mocking him. Bring him home, won't you? And
I'll give you all the lilacs you want."</p>

<p>Startled at the sound of a human voice almost at her elbow when
she could see no sign of the speaker, Peace let go her hold on
the frightened captive, and with a relieved chirp, it flew out
of sight among the thick branches. But she made no attempt to
follow its flight, she was too scared. "Are&mdash;are&mdash;was it a real
woman which did that talking?" chattered Peace, wetting her lips
with her tongue.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the voice, with just the tinge of a laugh in
it. "I live in the stone house this side of the lilac bushes.
I saw you through the leaves and heard what you said, but won't
you please bring my little Gypsy home? I'll give you all the flowers
you want. Go down to the road and come in through the front gate.
I am here in my chair."</p>

<p>"Your bird has gone home already," Peace answered, reassured
by this explanation. "But I'll come and get those lilacs you spoke
about."</p>

<p>She ran nimbly down the length of the lilac hedge, dodged out
of sight around the corner, and appeared the next moment at the
iron gate which shut out the street from the grand stone house
with its wide lawns, great oaks, smooth, flower-bordered walks,
and splashing fountain.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beau-ti-ful!" cried the child in delight, as the gate
swung shut behind her. "I've always wanted to know what this place
looked like, but the tall hedge all along the fence is too thick
to see through and one can get only a teenty peek through the
gate. There is your bird on top of its cage now. See, I didn't
keep him, though I'd like to. He is a splendid singer. I sh'd
think you'd be the happiest lady in the whole world with all these
lovely flowers and&mdash;are you a lady?"</p>

<p>For the first time since entering the great gate, Peace turned
her big, brown eyes full upon the occupant of the reclining chair
in the shade of the lilac bushes, and her lively chatter faltered,
for the face pillowed among the silken cushions seemed neither
a child's nor yet a woman's. The eyes, intensely blue and clear,
the broad, high forehead, the thin cheeks and colorless lips,
even the heavy braids of brown hair with their auburn lights,
did not seem to belong to a mere mortal. And yet she could not
be an angel, for even Peace's youthful, untrained mind swiftly
read the bitterness and rebellion which lurked in those deep,
wonderful eyes. It was as if some doomed soul were looking out
through the bars of a prison fortress, without a single ray of
hope to break the gloom, without a single thought to cheer or
comfort. And so Peace, in her childish ignorance, asked, "Are
you a lady?"</p>

<p>"A woman grown," the sweet voice answered, and a faint smile
of amusement flitted across the marble-white face.</p>

<p>"Your&mdash;your hair is in braids," stammered Peace, unable to put
her subtle feelings into words.</p>

<p>"It is more restful that way," the speaker sighed; then again
that fleeting smile lighted up the beautiful features, and holding
out her hand to the puzzled child, she said coaxingly, "Tell me
about yourself. Is it really you who whistles so divinely in the
garden each morning? I have heard it so often but never could
locate it before. Aunt Pen thought it must be another canary at
the parsonage. It always seemed to come from that direction."</p>

<p>"That's 'cause Saint John and I live there. He whistles, too,
though I do it the best."</p>

<p>"Saint John?" The flicker of amusement became a genuine smile.</p>

<p>"That's the new preacher of Hill Street Church. He used to be
our minister in Parker and he lets me call him by his front name
when we are alone, but it was so easy to forget and do it when
we weren't alone that I named him <em>Saint</em> John, 'cause
Faith says he is my pattern&mdash;no patron saint. I call Elizabeth
Saint Elspeth, too, for the same reason. She is his wife."</p>

<p>"But I thought you were their little girl."</p>

<p>"Mercy, no! They ain't old enough to have a little girl my age
yet. Glen is their only children. I'm just visiting."</p>

<p>"You have been with them ever since they came here, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Almost. They were a week ahead of me. They moved in from Parker
last March, the very week before our spring vacation from school,
and they begged grandpa so hard to let me come and help them settle
that he said I might. Then Allee got the scarlet fever, so I had
to stay for a time. Just as she was getting well so they 'xpected
to <em>fumergate</em> 'most any day, Cherry went to work and caught
it, and now Hope is in bed. There are two more yet to have it,
'nless you count me, and I ain't going to get it. I don't think
Gail and Faith will, either, 'cause they have been staying with
Frances Sherrar ever since the doctor decided he knew what ailed
Allee. Anyway, they had it when they were little."</p>

<p>"What quaint names!" murmured the lady, softly repeating them
one by one.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are, but as it ain't our fault, we've quit fretting
about 'em. Our grandfather was a minister, and he named us&mdash;all
but Gail and Allee. Papa named the oldest, and mamma named the
youngest. Grandpa fixed up all the rest."</p>

<p>The ludicrous look of resignation in the small round face was
too much for the questioner, and she burst into a rippling peal
of laughter, so hearty that a much older woman popped a surprised
face out of the door to see what was the matter. Peace caught
a glimpse of her as she vanished within doors once more, and demanded,
"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Pen."</p>

<p>"That's a quaint name, too. I'd as soon be called 'pencil',"
she retaliated.</p>

<p>"It isn't very common these days," smiled the woman. "The real
name is Penelope, but I shortened it to 'Pen.' Poor Aunt Pen,
she has a hard time of it."</p>

<p>"Why? I sh'd think it would be easy work living in such a beautiful
place as this."</p>

<p>"A beautiful place isn't everything in life," came the bitter
retort, and the rebellious look clouded the lovely eyes once more.</p>

<p>"No, it ain't," Peace acknowledged; "but it's a whole lot. Just
s'posing you had to live in a mite of an ugly house without nice
things to eat or wear and with no father or mother to take care
of you, and a mortgage you couldn't pay, and an old skinflint
of a man ready to slam you outdoors and gobble up the farm, furniture
and everything, the minute the mortgage was due. How'd you like
that?"</p>

<p>"Have you no father or mother?" The voice was very soft and sweet
again, and the blue eyes glowed tenderly.</p>

<p>Peace shook her head. "They are both inside the gates."</p>

<p>"Then who takes care of you?"</p>

<p>"Grandpa Campbell, what was adopted by my own grandpa when he
was a boy."</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, won't you, dear?"</p>

<p>So Peace related the pathetic story of the two souls who had
gone into the Great Beyond, leaving the helpless orphan band to
battle by themselves; of the struggle the little brown house had
witnessed; of the tramp who came begging his breakfast, and afterwards
proved to be the beloved President of the University; and of the
beautiful change which had come in their fortunes when he had
adopted the whole flock.</p>

<p>When she had finished her recital there were tears in the blue
eyes, and the white-faced lady murmured compassionately, "Poor
little sisters! There are so many orphans in this big world."</p>

<p>Something in her tone and the far-away expression of her eyes
impelled Peace to say with conviction, "You are an orphan, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, child."</p>

<p>"Since you were a little girl?"</p>

<p>"Since I was five years old."</p>

<p>"Oh, as little as Allee when mamma died! Wasn't there anyone
to take care of you? Did your Aunt Pen adopt you?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Pen has always lived with us. I don't remember any other
mother."</p>

<p>"And did you always live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I was born here. It wasn't part of the city then."</p>

<p>"But you don't look real old."</p>

<p>"I am not <em>real</em> old. I was twenty-four last November."</p>

<p>"And Gail was nineteen the same month! You're only four, five
years older than she is. That's not much&mdash;but there's a bigger
difference."</p>

<p>"How, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she looks 'sif she liked to live better'n you do."</p>

<p>The woman drew a long, shivering breath and closed her eyes as
if a spasm of pain had seized her; and Peace, frightened at the
death-like pallor of the face, quavered, "Oh, don't faint! What
is the matter? Are you sick? Or is it just a chill? Maybe you
better run around a bit until you get warm."</p>

<p>The deep, unfathomable blue eyes opened, and the voice said bitterly,
"I can <em>never</em> run again. I must lie in this chair all
the rest of my life with nothing to do but think, think, think!
Do you wonder now that I am not happy? Do you understand now why
Aunt Pen has a hard time? Do you see the reason for that tall,
thick hedge all around the yard?"</p>

<p>"No," Peace replied bluntly. "I can't see a mite of sense in
it! If I had to live in a chair all my days, I'd want it where
I could watch the world go by. I'd cut down all the hedges and
let the sun shine in. If I couldn't run about myself, I'd just
watch the folks that did have good feet. I'd wave my hands at
the children and give 'em flowers, and they'd come and talk to
me when I was tired of reading. I'd have a bird like you've got,
and I'd make a pet of it, too. I'd have more'n one; I'd have a
whole m'nagerie of dogs and cats and rabbits and squirrels and&mdash;and
ponies, maybe, and a monkey or two. And I'd teach them to do tricks,
and then I'd call all the poor little children who can't go to
the circus to see my animals perform. I'd have gardens of flowers
for the sick people and vegetables for those who haven't any place
to raise their own and no money to buy them. That's what Saint
John is going to do with all they don't use at the parsonage.
I'd make a park of my back yard and let dirty children play there
so's they would not get run over in the street; I'd&mdash;oh, there
are so many things I'd do to enjoy myself!"</p>

<p>Peace paused for breath, the well of her imagination run dry,
but her face was so radiant that instinctively her listener knew
these were not idle words, though she could not keep the hard
tone out of her voice as she answered, "Ah, that is easy enough
to say, but&mdash;wait until you are where I am now, and I think you
will find it lots harder to practice what you preach. You will
turn your face to the wall, say good-bye to those who you thought
were your friends, build a high fence around yourself and hide&mdash;<em>hide</em>
from the world and everything!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Peace protested, shuddering at the picture she had
drawn. "I should <em>die</em> if I couldn't see the sun and flowers
and kind faces of the folks I love. But&mdash;it&mdash;would be&mdash;awfully
hard <em>never</em> to walk again."</p>

<p>"Hard? It is <em>torture</em>!" She had forgotten that she was
talking to a mere child, one who could not understand what it
was to have dearest ambitions thwarted, one who could not even
know yet what it was to have ambitions. "I had dreamed of being
a great singer some day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, do you sing?" cried Peace, who was passionately fond of
music in whatever guise it came.</p>

<p>"Masters said I could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then please sing for me. I can only whistle, and then folks
say,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Whistling girls and crowing hens<br/>
Always come to some bad ends.'

</p>
</div>
<p>"I'd like awfully much to hear you sing."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't sing any more! That is all past now; but oh, how
I loved it! We were going to Europe, Aunt Pen and I, and when
we came back after months and years of study, I thought I should
be a &mdash;Jenny Lind, perhaps. I thought of it by day, I dreamed
of it by night. It was <em>everything</em> to me. And then&mdash;my
horse fell&mdash;and here I am."</p>

<p>"Was it long ago?" whispered Peace, strangely stirred by the
passionate words of the girl before her.</p>

<p>"Five years."</p>

<p>"And you've been here ever since?"</p>

<p>"Ever since."</p>

<p>Oh, the hopelessness of the words, the bitterness of the face!</p>

<p>Involuntarily Peace turned her eyes away, and as her glance fell
upon the delicate bloom of the lilac bushes beside her, she began
to hum under her breath, "Oh, you lovely lilacs, growing up so
high."</p>

<p>"Sing to me," commanded the lame girl imperiously.</p>

<p>"Sing? I can't sing! All I can do is whistle."</p>

<p>"But you were singing just now."</p>

<p>"I was humming."</p>

<p>"Don't quibble!" A faint smile smoothed away the hard lines about
the young mouth. "Please sing that little tune for me. I have
heard you so often in the garden and that seems quite a favorite
of yours, but I can never make out the words."</p>

<p>"That's 'cause the words ain't usu'ly alike."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Why, Allee and me have always fitted talking words into our
song music and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't understand, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"Why, we just sing things instead of talking them like other
folks would. They don't rhyme, but they fit into tunes which we
like, and our Gleaners' motto song is our favorite, so that's
the one we usu'ly hum, and that's how you hear it so much."</p>

<p>"Then sing the motto song. The tune is very pretty."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is pretty, but the reason we like it so well is 'cause
it sounds glad. We never can sing it when we're cross or bad.
It's made just for sunshine."</p>

<p>Softly she began to chant the words:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'In a world where sorrow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever will be known<br/>
Where are found the needy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sad and lone.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Peace was right in saying that she could not sing, and yet her
happy voice, warbling out those joyous words, made very sweet
music that bright May morning. The lines of weariness gradually
left the invalid's face, a feeling of rest stole over her, and
with a tired little sigh, she closed her eyes.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'When the days are gloomy,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sing some happy song,<br/>
Meet the world's repining<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With a courage strong;

</p>
<p>
"'Go with faith undaunted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro' the ills of life,<br/>
Scatter smiles and sunshine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er its toil and strife,'"

</p>
</div>
<p>piped Peace, staring at the waving plumes of lavender above her
head.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Sca-atter sunshine all along your wa-ay,<br/>
Cheer and bless and bri-ighten&mdash;'"

</p>
</div>
<p>The song ceased in the midst of the chorus.</p>

<p>The big blue eyes flashed open and the lame girl demanded in
surprise. "Why did you stop?"</p>

<p>"Oh," breathed Peace, a look of great relief passing over her
face, "I thought sure you'd gone to sleep and I wouldn't get my
lilacs after all."</p>

<p>"You little goosie! I don't go to sleep that easily. Sing the
chorus again for me, and then Hicks shall cut all the flowers
you can carry."</p>

<p>"He better begin now, then, 'cause the chorus ain't long and
it sounds 'sif Elspeth was calling me. I've been out of sight
from the parsonage quite a spell and likely she's getting anxious.
Besides, Glen may be awake and wanting me."</p>

<p>"Very well," she laughed. "Hicks shall begin right away. See,
there he comes with his basket and scissors. Now sing."</p>

<p>So Peace repeated the sprightly chorus with a vim, and was rewarded
with such a huge bouquet of the fragrant blossoms that she was
almost hidden from sight as she stood clasping them tightly in
her arms, and exclaiming in rapture, "All for me? Oh, dear Lilac
Lady, I didn't 'xpect that many! You better have Aunt Pen put
some of these in the house for you."</p>

<p>"No, I don't want them in my house!" exclaimed the girl fiercely.
"They are all for you&mdash;and Saint Elspeth."</p>

<p>"Oh, she'll love you for sending them. Can I bring her over to
see you? Her and Saint John?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't care to meet them. Saint John has already called,
but &mdash;I sent him away again."</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I s'pose&mdash;you won't care to have me call again either."</p>

<p>This beautiful garden seemed like the Promised Land to Peace's
childish eyes, and the thought of never being allowed to enter
it again was dreadful.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, <em>do</em> come again! You <em>must</em> come again!
Come every day. No, not every day, some days I couldn't see you
if you came. I will hang a white cloth on the lilac bushes&mdash;see,&mdash;on
the other side, where you can see it from the parsonage, and you
will come then, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if Elspeth doesn't need me and Glen is asleep. He likes
flowers, too, even if he is just a baby, and he never tears them
to pieces."</p>

<p>"I'll have Hicks cut you some tulips&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You better not today. I'll get them next time I come. These
are all I can carry now, and they are a lot too many for our little
parsonage. But I'm awful glad you gave me such a big bunch, 'cause
there are ever so many of the church people sick, and Elspeth
will be so pleased to have me <em>distribit</em> bouquets amongst
'em. Some of 'em it will be like slinging coals of fire at their
heads, too. There's old Deacon Hopper for one. He doesn't like
Saint John and calls him a meddlesome monkey of a minister. Now
he's sick, I'll take him a bunch of lilacs and tell him the meddlesome
monkey's minister has sent him some flowers and hopes he soon
gets onto his feet again.</p>

<p>"Mittie Cole is another that needs some fire on her head. She
pushed me into the gutter three times the day I tried to adopt
the runaway twins, and we'd have had a grand scrimmage if Saint
John hadn't happened along to stop it. But she's got lung fever
now, and there was days the doctor said she wouldn't live. I reckon
she doesn't feel much like fighting any more, but likely she'll
enjoy the smell of these lovely lilacs. She seemed awful glad
to see me the day I carried her some chicken broth.</p>

<p>"The Foster baby is sick, and Grandma Deane, and little Freddie
James, and Mrs. Hoover, and Dan'l Fielding. You see that's quite
a bunch, and it will take a big lot of flowers to go around. I'll
tell 'em all that you sent 'em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" There was real alarm in her voice. "Because I did
not send them. I gave them to you."</p>

<p>"But if you hadn't given them to me, I couldn't share 'em with
other folks, so it's really you who is to blame. You&mdash;you don't
care if I give some away, do you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, dear. You may give them all away if it will make
you any happier."</p>

<p>"Oh, it does! I just love to see sick faces smile when someone
brings in flowers to smell or nice things to eat. Miss Edith sometimes
takes us to the hospital with bouquets to <em>distribit</em>,
and my! how glad the patients are to get them. They say it is
almost as good as a breath of real, genuine air. I'm going with
Saint Elspeth tomorrow afternoon&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you must come over here and get some more lilacs. Hicks
will cut all you can carry."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you mean it? You darling Lilac Lady&mdash;that's what I mean
to call you always, 'cause you give away so many lilacs to make
other folks happy. I'll bring the biggest basket I can find. There
is Elspeth calling again. I must hurry home."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me your name yet. I forgot to ask it before,
but if I am to be your Lilac Lady, I must know what to call you,
too."</p>

<p>"Peace &mdash;Peace Greenfield. Good-bye. I'll be here tomorrow
just the minute dinner is over."</p>

<p>The blue eyes followed her longingly as she danced away through
the fresh clover and disappeared beyond the heavy gates. Then
the lame girl turned in her chair,&mdash;almost against her will, it
seemed&mdash;and looked up at the fragrant purple plumes nodding above
her head. "Peace," she murmured. "How odd! 'The peace which passeth
understanding.'"</p>
