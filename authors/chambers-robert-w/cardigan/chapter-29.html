<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>We entered Albany on the 22d of April; the town had heard the
news from Lexington ere we sighted the Albany hills, the express
having passed us as we crossed the New York line, tearing along
the river-bank at a breakneck gallop.</p>

<p>So, when we rode into Albany, the stolid, pippin-cheeked Dutchmen
had later news than had we, and I learned then, for the first
time, how my Lord Percy's troops had been hurled headlong through
Cambridge Farms into Charlestown, where they lay like panting,
slavering, senseless beasts under the cannon of the <em>Somerset</em>
and <em>Asia</em>. And all Massachusetts sat watching them, gun
in hand.</p>

<p>We lay at the house of Peter Weaver, my lawyer, Silver Heels
and I; Jack Mount and Cade Renard lay at the "Half Moon," where
poor Shemuel could procure medicine and such medical attendance
as he so sorely stood in need of.</p>

<p>With Peter Weaver I prepared to arrange my affairs as best I
might, it being impossible for me to undertake a voyage to Ireland
at this time, though my succession to the title and estates of
my late uncle, Sir Terence, made it most necessary.</p>

<p>For the first time in my life I now became passably acquainted
with my own affairs, though when we came to figure in pounds,
shillings, and pence, I yawned, yet made pretence of a wisdom
in mathematics which, God knows, is not in me.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, her round chin on my shoulder, listened attentively,
and asked some questions which caused the ponderous lawyer to
address himself to her rather than to me, seeing clearly that
either I cared nothing for my own affairs or else was stupid past
all belief.</p>

<p>Sir William's legacies to me and to Silver Heels were discussed
most seriously; and Mr. Weaver would have it that the law should
deal with my miserable kinsman, Sir John, for the fraud he had
wrought. Yet, it was exactly <em>that</em>; and, because he <em>was</em>
my kinsman, I could not drag him out to cringe for his infamy
before the rabble.</p>

<p>The land and the money left to us by Sir William we would now,
doubtless, receive, but it was only because Sir William had desired
it that we at length made up our minds to accept it at all.</p>

<p>This I made plain to Mr. Weaver, then relapsed into a dull inspection
of his horn spectacles as he discoursed of mortgages and bonds
and interests and liens with stupefying monotony.</p>

<p>"It is like the school-room, Micky," murmured Silver Heels, close
to my ear, and composed her countenance to listen to a fluent
peroration on percentage and investments in terms which were to
me as vain as tinkling cymbals.</p>

<p>"Then I am wealthy?" I interposed, again and again, yet could
draw from that fat badger, Weaver, neither a "yes" nor "no," nor
any plain speech fit for a gentleman's comprehension.</p>

<p>So when at length we quitted Mr. Weaver a sullen mood possessed
me and I felt at bay with all the learned people in the world,
as I had often felt, penned in the school-room.</p>

<p>"Am I?" I asked Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Rich or poor? Tell me in one word, dear heart, for whether or
not I possess a brass farthing in the world, I do not know, upon
my honour!"</p>

<p>"Poor innocent," she laughed; "poor unlearned and harassed boy!
Know, then, that you have means to purchase porridge and a butcher's
roast for Christmas."</p>

<p>"I be serious," said I, anxiously, "and I would know if I have
means to support a large family&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Silver Heels. What I could see of her face,&mdash;one
small ear,&mdash;was glowing in rich colour.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;" I ventured. But she plucked at my arm with lowered
eyes, nor would hear me to explain that I, newly wedded, viewed
the future with a hopeful gravity that befitted.</p>

<p>"As for a house," said I, "there is a pleasant place of springs
called Saratoga, dearly loved by Sir William."</p>

<p>"I know," said she, quickly; "it comes from 'asserat,' sparkling
waters."</p>

<p>"It comes from 'Soragh,' which means salt, and 'Oga,' a place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It does <em>not</em>, Micky!"</p>

<p>"It does!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"It does!"</p>

<p>"Oc-qui-o-nis! He is a bear!" said Silver Heels, to herself.</p>

<p>We stopped in the hallway, facing each other. Something in her
flushed, defiant face, her bright eyes, the poise of her youthful
body, brought back with a rush that day, a year ago, when I, sneaking
out of the house to avoid the school-room, met her in the hallway,
and was balked and flouted and thrust back to the thraldom of
the school. Here was the same tormentor&mdash;the same child with her
gray eyes full of pretty malice, the same beauty of brow and mouth
and hair was here, and something added&mdash;a maid's delicate mockery
which veiled the tenderness of womanhood; a sweetheart and a wedded
wife.</p>

<p>"I am thinking of a morning very, very long ago," I said, slowly.</p>

<p>"I, too," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Almost a year ago," I said.</p>

<p>"A year ago," said Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"You little wild-cat thing!" I whispered, tenderly, and took
her by the waist so that her face lay upturned on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"Stupid," she said, "I loved you that very day."</p>

<p>"What day?"</p>

<p>"The day we both are thinking on: when you met me in the hall
with your fish-rod like a guilty dunce&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You wore a skirt o' buckskin and tiny moccasins and stockings
with scarlet thrums; and you were a-nibbling a cone of maple-sugar,"
said I.</p>

<p>"And you strove to trip me up!"</p>

<p>"And you pushed me!"</p>

<p>"And you thrust Vix at me!"</p>

<p>"And you kicked my legs and ran up-stairs like a wild-cat thing."</p>

<p>There was a silence; she looked up into my face from my shoulder.</p>

<p>"This, for a belt of peace betwixt those two children who live
in memory," said I, and kissed her.</p>

<p>"Oonah! All is lost," she said; "he does with me as he will!"
and she rendered me my kiss, saying, "Bearer of belts, thy peace-belt
is returned."</p>

<p>So was perfect peace established, not only for the shadowy children
of that unforgotten past, but for us, and for all time betwixt
us; and our belts were offered and returned, and the sign was
the touching of her lips and mine.</p>

<p>For Shemuel's sake, and because we would not desert him, we continued
in Albany until near the end of April.</p>

<p>Taking counsel together, we had determined to build a mansion,
when the times permitted, midway on the road 'twixt Johnstown
and Fonda's Bush, our lands joining at that place. But I feared
much that the war which now flamed through Massachusetts Bay might
soon creep northward into our forest fastness and set the border
ablaze from the Ohio to Saint Sacrement. Much, too, I feared that
the men of the woods whose skin was red would league with the
men whose coats were red. All his later days Sir William had striven
to avert this awful pact; Dunmore played against him, Butler betrayed
him, Cresap was tricked, and Sir William lost. Now, into his high
place sneaked a pygmy, slow, uncertain, sullen, treacherous&mdash;his
own son, who would undo the last knot which bound the Indians
to a fair neutrality. Perhaps he himself would even lead them
on to the dreadful devastation all men dreaded; and, if he, men
must also count on the Butlers, father and son, to carry terror
through our forests and hunt to death without mercy all who stood
for freedom and the rights of man.</p>

<p>One of these I had held in my hand and released. Yet still that
old certainty haunted me, the belief that one day I was to meet
and kill him, not in honourable encounter, now, for he had lost
the right to ask such a death from me; but in the dark forest,
somewhere among the corridors of silent pines, I would slay him
as sachems slay ferocious beasts that track men through ghost-trails
down to hell.</p>

<p>Then should we be free at last of this fierce, misshapen soul,
we People of the Morning, Tierhansaga, and the shrinking forest
should straighten, and Oya should be Oyabanh, and the red witch-flower
should wither to a stalk, to a seed, and sprout a fair white blossom
for all time, Ahwehhah.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>That night, as I stood on the steps of Peter Weaver's red brick
house, turning to look once more into the coals of the setting
sun ere I entered the door, a hand twitched at my coat-skirt,
and, looking down, I saw below me on the pavement an Indian dressed
in the buckskins of a forest-runner.</p>

<p>"Peter!" I cried, for it was he, my dusky kinsman on the left
hand; then my eyes fell on his companion, a short, squat savage,
clad in red, and painted hideous with strange signs I could not
read.</p>

<p>"Red Jacket," said Peter, calmly.</p>

<p>I looked hard at Peter; he had grown big and swart and fat like
a bear-cub in November; Red Jacket raised his sullen eyes, then
dropped them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as I stood there, at a loss what next to say, came
a heavy man, richly clothed, flabby face bent on the ground. Nor
would he have discovered me, so immersed in brooding reverie was
he, had not Peter touched his elbow.</p>

<p>A bright flush stained his face; he looked up at me where I stood.
Then I descended the steps, shoving Peter from between us, and
Sir John Johnson, for it was he, moved back a pace and laid his
heavy hand on his sword-belt as I came close to him, looking into
his cold eyes.</p>

<p>"Liar!" I said; "liar! liar!" And that was all, for he gave ground,
and his hand fell limply from his dishonoured hilt.</p>

<p>So I left him, there in the darkening street, the Indians watching
him with steady, kindling eyes.</p>

<p>We started next day at dawn, Silver Heels riding Warlock in her
new kirtle and little French three-cornered hat with its gilt
fringe, to which she had a right, as she was now My Lady Cardigan,
if she chose.</p>

<p>I rode a bay mare, bought in Albany, yet a beauty, and doubtless
the only decent horseflesh in all that town of rusty rackers and
patroons' sorry hacks. Mount and the Weasel, leather-clad, and
gay with quilled moccasins and brilliant thrums, journeyed afoot,
on either side o' Shemuel, who bestrode a little docile ass.</p>

<p>His noddle, neatly mended and still bound up, he had surmounted
with a Quaker hat so large that it rested on his large flaring
ears; peddlers' panniers swung on either flank, crammed deep with
gewgaws; he let his bridle fall on the patient ass's neck, and,
thumbs in his armpits, joined lustily the chorus raised by Mount
and Renard:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Come, all ye Tryon County men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never be dismayed;<br/>
&nbsp;But trust in the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And He will be your aid!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Roaring the rude chorus, Jack Mount marched in the lead, his
swinging strides measured to our horses' steady pacing; beside
him trotted the little Weasel, his hand holding tightly to the
giant's arm; and sometimes he took three steps to Mount's one,
and sometimes he toddled, his little, leather-bound legs twinkling
like spokes in a wheel, but ever he chanted manfully as he marched:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"O trust in the Lord,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And He will be your aid!"

</p>
</div>
<p>And Shemuel's fervent whine from his lowly saddle rounded out
the old route-song.</p>

<p>An hour later I summoned Jack Mount, and he fell back to my stirrups,
resting his huge hand on my saddle as he walked beside me.</p>

<p>"Jack," I said, "is poor Cade cured o' fancy and his mad imaginings?"</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, for the time."</p>

<p>"For the time?"</p>

<p>"A year, two years, three, perhaps. This is not the first mad
flight o' fancy Cade has taken on his aged wings."</p>

<p>"You never told me that," I said, sharply.</p>

<p>"No, lad."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Do you spread abroad the sorry secrets of your kin, Mr. Cardigan?"</p>

<p>"He is not your kin!"</p>

<p>"He is more," said Mount, simply.</p>

<p>After a silence I asked him on what previous occasion the little
Weasel had gone moon-mad.</p>

<p>"On many&mdash;every third or fourth year since I first knew him,"
said Mount, soberly. "But never before did he leave me to follow
his poor mad phantoms&mdash;always the phantom of his wife, lad, in
divers guises. He saw her in a silvery bush o' moonlight nights,
and talked with her till my goose-flesh rose and crawled on me;
he saw her mirrored in cold, deep pools at dawn, looking up at
him from the golden-ribbed sands, and I have laid in the canoe
to watch the trouts' quick shadows moving on the bottom, and he
a-talking sweet to his dear wife as though she hid under the lily-pads
like a blossom."</p>

<p>He glanced up at me pitifully as he walked beside my stirrup;
I laid my hand on his leather-tufted shoulder.</p>

<p>"Sir, it is sad," he muttered; "a fair mind nobly wrecked. But
grief cannot deform the soul, Mr. Cardigan."</p>

<p>"He knows you now?"</p>

<p>"Ay, and knows that he has dwelt for months in madness."</p>

<p>"Does he know that it was me he loved so deeply in his madness?"
asked Silver Heels, gently.</p>

<p>"I think he does," whispered Mount.</p>

<p>Silver Heels turned her sorrowful eyes on poor Cade Renard.</p>

<p>Riding that afternoon near sunset, at the False Faces' Carrying-Place
upon the Mohawk, we spoke of Johnson Hall and the old life, sadly,
for never again could we hope to enter its beloved portals.</p>

<p>Naught that belonged to us remained in the Hall, save only the
memories none might rob us of.</p>

<p>"If only I might have Betty," said Silver Heels, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Betty? Did she not attend you to Boston with Sir John?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but she was slave to Sir John. I could not buy her; you
know how poor I awoke to find myself in Boston town."</p>

<p>"Would not that brute allow you Betty?" I asked, angrily.</p>

<p>"No; I think he feared her. Poor, blubbering Betty, how she wept
and roared her grief when Sir John bade her pack up, and called
her 'hussy.'"</p>

<p>That night we lay at Schenectady, where also was camped a body
of Sir William's Mohawks, a sullen, watchful band, daubed in hunting-paint,
yet their quivers hung heavy with triple-feathered war-arrows,
and their knives and hatchets and their rifles were over-bright
and clean to please me.</p>

<p>Some of them knew me, and came to talk with me over a birch-fire.
I gave them tobacco, and we tarried by the birch-fire till the
stars waned in the sky and the dawn-stillness fell on land and
river; but from them I could learn nothing, save that Sir John
and Colonel Guy had vowed to scalp their own neighbours should
they as much as cry, "God save our country!" Evil news, truly,
yet only set me firmer in my design to battle till the end for
the freedom that God had given and kings would take away.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, quitting the inn with Mount, came to warn me that
I must sleep if we set out at sunrise. Graciously she greeted
the Mohawks who had risen to withdraw; they all knew her, and
watched her like tame panthers with red coals in their eyes.</p>

<p>"But they are panthers yet; forget it not," muttered Jack Mount.</p>

<p>At sunrise we rode out into the blue hills. Homeless, yet nearing
home at last, my heart lifted like a singing bird. Dew on the
sweet-fern exhaling, dew on the ghost-flower, dew on the scented
brake!&mdash;and the whistle of feathered wings, and the endless ringing
chorus of the birds of Tryon! Hills of pure sapphire, streams
of gems, limpid necklaces festooned to drip diamonds from crags
into some frothing pool! Pendent pearls on vines starred white
with bloom; a dun deer at gaze, knee-deep in feathering willow-grass;
a hermit-bird his morning hymn, cloistered in the vaulted monastery
where the great organ stirs among the pines!</p>

<p>Hills! Hills of Tryon, unploughed, unharrowed, save by the galloping
deer; hills, sweet islands in the dark pine ocean, over whose
waste the wild hawk's mewing answers the cry of its high-wheeling
mate; hills of the morning, aromatic with spiced fern, and perfumed
of the gum of spruce and balsam; hills of Tryon; my hills! my
hills!</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>"The spring is with us," said Jack Mount, stooping to pluck a
frail flower.</p>

<p>"Ka-nah-wah-hawks, the cowslip!" murmured Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"Savour the wind; what is it?" I asked, sniffing.</p>

<p>"O-neh-tah, the pine!" she cried.</p>

<p>"O-ne-tah, the spruce!" I corrected.</p>

<p>"The pine, silly!"</p>

<p>"The spruce!"</p>

<p>"No, no, the pine!"</p>

<p>"So be it, sweet."</p>

<p>"No, I am wrong!"</p>

<p>And we laughed, and she stretched out her slender hand to me
from her saddle.</p>

<p>Then we galloped forward together, calling out greeting to our
old friends as we passed; and thus we saluted Jis-kah-kah, the
robin, and Kivi-yeh, the little owl, and we whistled at Koo-koo-e,
the quail, and mocked at old Kah-kah, the watchful crow.</p>

<p>Han-nah-wen, the butterfly, came flitting along the roadside,
ragged with his long winter's sleep.</p>

<p>"He should not have slept in his velvet robe for a night-shift,"
said Silver Heels; "he is a summer spendthrift, and Nah-wan-hon-tah,
the speckled trout, lies watching him under the water."</p>

<p>Which set me thinking of my feather-flies; and then the dear
old river flashed in sight.</p>

<p>"I see &mdash;I see&mdash;there, very far away on that hill&mdash;" whispered
Silver Heels.</p>

<p>"I see," I muttered, choking.</p>

<p>Presently the sunlight glimmered on a window of the distant Hall.</p>

<p>"We are on our own land now, dear heart," I said, choking back
the sob in my throat.</p>

<p>I called out to Jack Mount and unslung my woodaxe. He drew his
hatchet, and together we cut down a fair young maple, trimmed
it, and drove a heavy post into the soil.</p>

<p>"Here we will build one day," said I to Silver Heels. She smiled
faintly, but her eyes were fixed on the distant Hall.</p>

<p>I had leased, from my lawyer, Peter Weaver, a large stone mansion
in Johnstown, which stood next to the church where Sir William
lay; this until such time as I might return from the war and find
leisure to build on my own land the house which Silver Heels and
I had planned to stand on a hill, in full view of the river and
of the old Hall where our childhood had been passed.</p>

<p>It was night when we rode into Johnstown. I could discover no
changes in the darkness, save that a few new signs swung before
lighted shops, and every fifth house hung out a lanthorn and a
whole candle-light.</p>

<p>Our stone house was vast, damp, and scantily furnished, but Jack
Mount lighted a fire in the hallway, and Silver Heels went about
with a song on her lips, and Cade Renard sent servants from the
nearest inn with cloth and tableware, and meats smoking hot, not
forgetting a great bowl of punch and a cask of ale, which the
scullions rolled into the great hall and hoisted on the skids.</p>

<p>So we were merry, and silent, too, at moments, when our eyes
met in faint smiles or wistful sympathy.</p>

<p>Shemuel, with his peddling panniers, had strangely disappeared,
nor could we find him high or low when Mount and Cade had set
their own table by the fire and the room smelled sweet with steaming
toddy.</p>

<p>"Thrift! Thrift!" muttered Mount, rattling his toddy-stick impatiently;
"now who could have thought that little Jew would have cut away
to make up time in trade this night!"</p>

<p>But Shemuel had traded in another manner, for, ere Mount had
set his strong, white teeth in the breast-bone of a roasted fowl,
I heard Silver Heels cry out: "Betty! Betty! Oh dear, dear Betty!"
And the blubbering black woman came rolling in, scarlet turban
erect, ear-rings jingling.</p>

<p>"Mah li'l dove! Mah li'l pigeon-dove! Oh Gord, mah li'l Miss
Honey-bee!"</p>

<p>"You must keep her, lad," muttered Mount.</p>

<p>"I think Sir John will sell," I said, grimly.</p>

<p>And so he did, or would have, had not his new wife, poor Lady
Johnson, whom I had never seen, writing from the Hall, begged
me to accept Betty as a gift from her. And I, having no quarrel
with the unhappy lady, accepted Betty as a gift, permitting Lady
Johnson to secure from the incident what comfort she might.</p>

<p>All through the sweet May-tide, Jack Mount and Cade Renard sunned
themselves under the trees in our garden, or sprawled on the warm
porch like great, amiable wolf-hounds, dozing and dreaming of
mighty deeds.</p>

<p>Ale they had for the drawing, yet abused it not, respecting the
hospitality of the house and its young mistress, and none could
point the shameful finger at either to cry: "Fie! Pottle-pot!
Malt-worm! Painted-nose! Go swim!" At times, sitting together
on the grass, cheek by jowl, I heard them singing hymns; at times
strolling through the moon-drenched garden paths they lifted up
their souls in song:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The hunter has taken the trail to the East;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The little deer run! The little deer run!<br/>
Fear not, little deer, for he hunts the Red Beast;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are not for his gun! Ye are not for his gun!

</p>
<p>
"The hunter lies cold on the trail to the East;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His bosom is rent! His bosom is rent!<br/>
He died for his country, to slay the Red Beast;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To Heaven he went! To Heaven he went!"

</p>
</div>
<p>In the moonlight the doleful chant droned on, night after night,
under the dewy lilacs; and the great horned-owl answered, hooting
from the pines; and Silver Heels and I listened from the porch,
hand clasping hand in fearsome content. For out in the dark world
God was busy shaping the destiny of a people; even the black forest
knew it, and thrilled like a vast harp at the touch of the free
winds' fingers&mdash;unseen fingers, delicate, tentative, groping for
the key to a chord of splendid majesty. And when at last the chord
should be found and struck, resounding to the deep world's rock
foundation, a free people's voices should repeat, singing forever
and for all time throughout the earth:</p>

<p>"Amen!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, stillness, moonlight, and a "<em>Miserere</em>" from
the lips of two strange forest-runner folk, free-born and ready
when the Lord of all led forth His prophet to command.</p>

<p>On that night I heard a man in the street repeat a name, Washington.
And all that night I thought of it, and said it, under my breath.
But what it might portend I knew not then.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>May ended, smothered in flowers; and with the thickening leaves
of June came to us there in the North rumours of the times which
were to try men's souls. And again I heard, somewhere in the darkness
of the village streets, the name I heard before; and that night,
too, I lay awake, forming the word with silent lips, close to
my young wife's breast.</p>

<p>The full, yellow moon of June creamed all our garden now; Mount
and Renard sat a-squat upon the grass, chin on fist, to muse and
muse and wait&mdash;for what? The King of England did not know; but
all the world was waiting, too.</p>

<p>Then, one dim morning, while yet the primrose light tinted the
far hills, I awoke to see Silver Heels in her white night-robe,
leaning from the casement, calling out to me in a strange, frightened
voice: "Michael! Michael! They are coming over the hills&mdash;over
the hills, dear heart, to take you with them!"</p>

<p>At the window, sniffing the fresh dawn, I listened.</p>

<p>"Footfalls in the hills!" she said, trembling. "Out of the morning
men are coming! God make me brave! God make me brave!"</p>

<p>For a long time we stood silent; the village slept below us;
the stillness of the dawn remained unbroken, save by a golden-robin's
note, fluting from a spectral elm.</p>

<p>"It is not yet time," I said: "let us sleep on, dear heart."</p>

<p>But she would not, and I was fain to dress me in my leather,
lest the summons coming swift might find me all unready at the
call.</p>

<p>Then she roused Betty and the maid and servants, bidding them
call up Mount and Renard, for the hour was close upon us all.</p>

<p>"Dear love," I said, "this is a strange fear that takes you from
your pillows there, at dawn."</p>

<p>"Strange things befall a blindly loving heart," she said; "I
heard them in my dreams, and knew them, all marching with their
yellow moccasins and raccoon-caps and green thrums blowing in
the wind."</p>

<p>"Riflemen?"</p>

<p>"Ay, dear love."</p>

<p>"Foolish prophetess!"</p>

<p>"Too wise! Too wise!" she whispered, wearily, nestling within
my arms, a second only, then:</p>

<p>"Sir Michael!" roared Mount below my window; "Cresap is on the
hills with five hundred men of Maryland!"</p>

<p>Stunned, I stared at Silver Heels; her face was marble, glorified.</p>

<p>As the sun rose I left her, and, scarce knowing what I did, threw
my long rifle on my shoulder and ran out swiftly through the garden.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as though by magic summoned, the whole street was filled
with riflemen, marching silently and swiftly, with moccasined
feet, their raccoon caps pushed back, the green thrums tossing
on sleeve and thigh. On they came, rank on rank, like brown deer
herding through a rock run; and, on the hunting-shirts, lettered
in white across each breast, I read:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>LIBERTY OR DEATH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Mount and the Weasel came up, rifles shouldered, coon-skin caps
swinging in their hands. Mount shyly touched the hand that Silver
Heels held out; Cade Renard took the fingers, and, bending above
them with a flicker of his aged gallantly, pressed them with his
shrivelled lips.</p>

<p>"We will watch over your husband, my lady," he said, raising
his dim eyes to hers.</p>

<p>"Ay, we will bring him back, Lady Cardigan," muttered Jack Mount,
twisting his cap in his huge paws.</p>

<p>Silver Heels, holding them each by the hand, strove to speak,
but the voice in her white throat froze, and she only looked silently
from them to me with pitiful gray eyes.</p>

<p>"To kill the Red Beast," muttered Mount; "it is quickly done,
Lady Cardigan. Then your husband will return."</p>

<p>"To kill the Beast," repeated Renard; "the Red Beast with twin
heads. Ay, it can be done, my lady. Then he will return."</p>

<p>"I swear it!" cried Mount, flinging up his great arm. "He will
return."</p>

<p>"To doubt it is to doubt God's grace, child. He will return,"
said Cade Renard.</p>

<p>She looked at me, at Mount, at the Weasel, then at the torrent
of dusty riflemen steadily passing without a break.</p>

<p>"If he&mdash;he must go&mdash;" she began. Her voice failed; she caught
my hands and kissed them.</p>

<p>"For our honour&mdash;go!" she gasped. "Michael! Michael! Come back
to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Truly, dear heart&mdash;truly! truly!"</p>

<p>"Ho! Cardigan!" rang out a voice like a pistol-shot from the
passing ranks.</p>

<p>Through my tear-dimmed eyes I saw Cresap, sword shining in his
hand.</p>

<p>"We come," cried Mount, shaking his rifle towards the rising
sun; "death to the Red Beast!"</p>

<p>"Death to the Beast!" shouted Cresap, shaking his shining sword.</p>

<p>Half a thousand heavy rifles shook high; half a thousand deep
voices roared thunderously through the stony street:</p>

<p>"Liberty! Liberty or Death!"</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>

<p>And now that of a truth the Red Beast is slain, as all men know,
follow these mellow years through which our children move, watching
the world like a great witch-flower unfold. Content, I sit with
her I love, at dusk, tying my soft feather-flies just as I tied
them for Sir William in the golden time. The trout have nothing
changed, nor I, though kings already live as legends.</p>

<p>Bitter-sweet on porch and paling, woodbine and white-starred
clematis, and the deep hum of bees; and in the sunlit garden poppies,
red as the blood of martyrs. Then moonlight and my dear wife at
the door.</p>

<p>Betty, she hath cradled our tot, Felicity, to croon some soft
charm of Southern sorcery, whereby sleep settles like gray dusk-moths
on tired lids.</p>

<p>But for the boy, William, it serves not, and he defies us with
his wooden gun, declaiming that a man whose grandsire died with
Wolfe will not be taken off to bed at such an hour. And so my
sweetheart cradles him, unheeding my stern hint of rods a-pickle
for the wilful; and, in the moonlight, joining my fish-rod, I
hear her from the nursery, singing the song of blessed days departed,
yet with each dawn renewed:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"For courts are full of flattery,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As hath too oft been tried;<br/>
The city full of wantonness,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And both be full of Pride:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then care away,<br/>
And wend along with me!"

</p>
</div>
<p>"I know a trout," quoth Jack Mount, taking his cob-pipe from
his teeth, "a monstrous huge one, lad, hard by the thunder-stricken
hemlock where the Kennyetto turns upon itself. Shemuel did mark
the fish, sleeping at noon three days since."</p>

<p>"Bring Cade along," said I, opening the garden gate, and gathering
my rod and line lest the fly-hook catch in the rosebush; "and
fetch the gaff, Jack, when you return."</p>

<p>But when he came again into the moonlit garden he came alone,
swinging the bright steel gaff.</p>

<p>"Cade sleeps by the fire in the great hall," he said. "Truly,
lad, we age apace, and the sly beast, Death, follows us, sniffing,
as we go. Lord! Lord! How old we grow&mdash;how old, how old! All of
us, save Lady Cardigan and you! Years freshen her."</p>

<p>"The years are kind," I said.</p>

<p>So we descended through the dusk to the sweet water flowing under
the clustered stars.</p>
