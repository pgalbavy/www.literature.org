<p>Jack Carleton's triumph over the Indian youth was complete. In
a fair wrestling bout he had flung him to the ground with a force
that drove the breath from his body, and gave him a more vivid
idea of the white man's views of that athletic amusement than
he had ever entertained before. But what was to be the outcome
of this affair was more than the boy could guess. Physical prowess
always commands respect whether the spectators be civilized or
savage; but it does not insure against persecution.</p>

<p>"I have made them more revengeful than before," was the thought
of the youth, after he hurried back into Ogallah's lodge, and
sat panting from his exertion: "they hate me because I am of another
race and am in their hands. They are afraid of the chief and,
therefore, they will be more careful and I must be the same."</p>

<p>There could be no mistake as to the sentiments of the sachem
and his squaw. They were delighted with the ability shown by the
pale-faced youth who had evidently overthrown the young champion
of the village. Ogallah grinned and chattered with his wife who
grinned and chattered in turn. Then the former patted Jack on
the back and talked very fast. The boy could not doubt that he
was uttering the most high flown compliments and he did a great
deal of smiling and bowing in response. The squaw was more demonstrative,
for, after bustling about the half-expired fire for awhile, she
brought forward a piece of meat which she had taken extra pains
in cooking and placed it at his disposal. Jack was not suffering
from hunger, but he very gladly ate the food and nodded in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>The crowd around the entrance became so noisy that the chieftain
suddenly lost patience, and, springing to his feet, he dashed
the bison skin door aside and speedily scattered them.</p>

<p>As Jack sat on the lodge floor, rapidly recovering from his severe
exertion, he became conscious of a peculiar feeling which manifested
itself at intervals. When he moved, he was slightly dizzy and
his heart gave several throbs that were more rapid and spasmodic
than usual. He remained quiet, wondering what it could mean, but
feeling much inclined to lay it to the exciting scene through
which he had just passed. When he began to feel alarmed it passed
off.</p>

<p>But if Jack counted on finding all the hours dull and monotonous,
from being compelled to stay within the tepee or wigwam of the
Sauk chieftain, he was greatly mistaken. Shortly after eating
his supplementary breakfast, Ogallah went out, leaving the youth
alone with the squaw. This caused Jack some misgiving, for he
feared his enemies might take advantage of the warrior's absence
to punish him for his victory over the Indian youth. For some
minutes he was in much trepidation, and the feeling was not lessened
when he caught sight of several coppery faces peeping through
the door. However, they ventured on no greater liberties and after
a time went away.</p>

<p>All at once a great uproar rose through the village. Shouting,
whooping, screeching and all sorts of unimaginable noises rent
the air. The sound of hurrying feet was heard, and it was evident
that something of an extraordinary character was going on. Jack
looked inquiringly at the squaw, but, though she must have known
the explanation, she failed for obvious reasons to make it clear
to the captive.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ogallah came into the lodge. He uttered a few hurried
words to his wife and then beckoned Jack to follow him. The latter
had shoved his knife back in place, but did not venture to take
his rifle which stood at the other side of the lodge.</p>

<p>"I wonder what's up now," was the natural thought of the lad,
as he hastened after him; "have they erected a stake in the middle
of the village where I am to be roasted for the amusement of the
rest, or am I to be put to a test which I won't be able to stand?"</p>

<p>But fortunately the boy was mistaken in both his theories. The
hubbub had no reference to him whatever.</p>

<p>Beginning the night before, a party of bucks and squaws had been
employed until long after daylight in cooking the carcass of a
bear, that was plump, oily and in the best condition. It was not
very large, but where there was so little waste, it can be seen
there must have been considerable in the way of food.</p>

<p>The animal was now fairly roasted and the time for feasting had
come. Jack understood that much when he ventured outside the lodge
and saw the numbers gathering around the "festive board." Naturally
he clung close to his protector, but one of the singular features
attending his captivity among this offshoot of the Sauk tribe
of Indians, was the readiness with which they transferred their
attention from one object to another. No one showed any curiosity
in him when he appeared on the street&mdash;so to speak&mdash;but all pushed
their way toward the one point of interest.</p>

<p>The shouting and uproar ceased when fourteen warriors marched
forth in Indian file, and, arranging themselves around the brown
crisp mass of meat, made ready to fall to work, the others watching
them. They were all fine looking fellows, their faces painted
and their preparations complete for hostilities, with the exception
that their rifles were left aside, merely for convenience sake,
until the end of the festivities.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton knew he was looking upon a war feast, as they are
termed by the Indians, and which were more common among those
people at that time than they are to-day. The bear had been carefully
cooked expressly for them, and looked grotesquely tempting, as
the crisped, browned, and oily carcass dripped over the pile of
branches and green leaves to which the cooks had carried it.</p>

<p>The American Indian is ridiculously superstitious, and he has
as much terror of an odd number at a war feast, as we have of
being one of thirteen at an ordinary dinner party. Under no circumstances
would the Sauks have permitted such a defiance of fate itself.</p>

<p>When the fourteen warriors had ranged themselves around the table,
they stood for a minute or two, while the others held their breath
in expectancy. The tallest Indian, who was the leader of the little
company, suddenly whipped out his hunting knife and looked at
the others, who imitated him with military promptness. Then he
muttered some command, and immediately the whole number sprang
upon the waiting carcass, which was carved up in a twinkling.
Each cut himself an enormous slice, and, stepping back, began
eating with the voracity of a wolf, while the others looked admiringly
on. The spectators had held their peace so long that they broke
forth again, not so loud as before, but grunting, chattering,
and gesticulating like so many children, while Jack Carleton,
taking good care to keep close to Ogallah his protector, furtively
watched the scene.</p>

<p>The capacity of the red man for fasting and feasting is almost
incredible. He will go for days without a mouthful, and then,
when an abundance of food is presented, will gorge himself to
an extent that would be sure death to an ordinary human being,
after which he will smoke, blink, and doze for several days more,
just as the famous boa constrictors of Africa are accustomed to
do.</p>

<p>Such, however, is his habit only when driven by necessity. The
Sauks lived too far south of the frozen regions to suffer such
hardships, but one of the requirements of the war-feast was that
each one of the party should eat all that he had cut from the
carcass. To fail to do so was a sign of weakness sure to subject
him to ridicule.</p>

<p>So resolutely did the warriors address themselves to the task,
as it may be called, that they succeeded with the exception of
a single one. Two or three, however, found it all they could do,
and another mouthful of the coarse, oily meat, would have raised
a rebellion within their internal economy, which would have caused
general wreck and desolation.</p>

<p>The youthful warrior who failed was the one who was the most
eager at the first for the feast. He toiled like a hero, and all
went well until he reached the last half pound. The others, grinning
queerly through their grease and paint, watched him as did the
group on the outside of the circle, while he, fully alive to the
fact that he was the center of attention, went to work as if resolved
to do or die.</p>

<p>It took several vigorous swallows to keep down the installment
which had descended, while he held the last piece in his hand
and surveyed it with doubtful eye. It finally rested uneasily
on the stomach, and he looked more hopefully than ever at the
remaining portion, suspended on the point of his hunting knife.</p>

<p>Evidently he was not afraid of that, if what had preceded it
would only keep quiet. Finally he made a desperate resolve and
quickly crammed his mouth with the oleaginous stuff, upon which
he began chewing with savage voracity. Possibly, if he could have
got it masticated enough to force down his throat with only a
few seconds' delay, all would have been well, but suddenly there
was an upward heave of the chest, a sort of general earthquake;
the eyes closed, and the mouth opened with a gape so prodigious
that it seemed to extend from ear to ear, and threatened to bisect
his head. That which followed may be left to the imagination of
the reader.</p>

<p>General laughter and taunts greeted the failure, in which Ogallah
heartily joined; but the warrior took it in good part, and doubtless
felt better than did any of the others participating in the scene
of gluttony, inasmuch as his stomach was in its normal condition.</p>

<p>The war feast finished, the fourteen resumed the form of a circle,
stood motionless a few minutes, and, all at once, began dancing
in the most furious manner. The spectators joined, Ogallah as
before being among the most vigorous in the lead, and in a brief
while the strange scene was presented of warriors, squaws, and
children bounding about, swinging their arms and splitting their
throats in the wildest excitement.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it will do for me to be the only idle one,"
said Jack Carleton with a laugh and a quick thrill, "so here goes!"</p>

<p>And with a "loud whoop" he leaped high in air, and began shouting
in as discordant tones as those around him. In truth, there was
no more enthusiastic member of the company than young Carleton,
who jumped, yelled, and conducted himself so much like an irrestrainable
lunatic that a spectator would have supposed he was setting the
cue for the others.</p>

<p>Ogallah and several of the warriors glanced at the pale face
with some curiosity, and probably a few comments were made upon
the performance of the youth. Their precise tenor, as a matter
of course, can only be conjectured, but Jack was confident they
were of a complimentary character, for the heartiness which he
showed must have pleased them.</p>

<p>While going about in this hilarious fashion, there were many
collisions and overturnings. Once Jack bumped so violently against
some one that both turned their heads and glared at each other.
The offender was the Indian youth whom Jack had beaten so handsomely
in the wrestling bout. For an instant the dusky lad held his hand
on the knife in his girdle, and was on the point of rushing at
Jack; but the latter meaningly grasped the handle of his weapon,
and returned his glare with equal fierceness.</p>

<p>It was enough, and the revelry continued. Had the Sauks been
in possession of firewater, the excitement would have intensified,
until weapons would have been drawn and a general fight precipitated,
accompanied with loss of more than one life. Such is the outcome
of most of the similar feasts held among the red men all through
the west: but there was not a drop of intoxicating stuff within
reach of the village, and thus the murderous wind-up of the festival
was averted.</p>

<p>The dance lasted until many dropped from exhaustion. Jack Carleton
was compelled to cease from sheer weakness, and staggering to
one side, sat down on what he supposed was a log, but which proved
to be a very live Indian who was also in quest of rest. Being
extended on his face, he threw up his back, much after the manner
of a mustang when "bucking," and Jack was sent sprawling.</p>

<p>"It don't make any difference," muttered the boy with a laugh,
"for I'm so tired that I can rest in one place as well as another,
and I'll wait here till the show is over."</p>

<p>And wait he did for the conclusion, which came very speedily.</p>
