<p>Piracy in the West Indies&mdash;Its Cause &mdash;Means by Which It
Was Wiped Out &mdash;Piracy in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We hear little of pirates in these days, but for ten years or
more after the close of the War of 1812 the West Indies were infested
by them. Our Government saw that in self-defense they must be
wiped out, for they grew bolder with every month and made it unsafe
for our commerce in those waters.</p>

<p>Where did they come from and what gave rise to the ocean nuisances?
About the time named Spain was the mistress of most of the South
American countries. When she discovered America through Columbus,
and for a long period afterward, she was one of the greatest maritime
nations in the world. Like England at the present time, she had
colonies in all parts of the globe, and had she not been so cruel
and unwise in the treatment of her dependencies, would still have
retained a great deal of her former greatness and power; but she
is one of the few nations that never learn from experience, and
a short time after our second war with Great Britain her South
American colonies began revolting against her, and one by one
they gained their independence.</p>

<p>Among the most powerful of the rebelling provinces were Buenos
Ayres and Venezuela; and, taking lesson from the success of our
privateers, they sent out many swift sailing, well-armed vessels
to prey upon Spanish commerce. They did their work so effectively
that by and by they extended their attacks to the vessels of all
nations. Nothing being done for a time to check them, they grew
rapidly in numbers and audacity, until, as has been stated, the
West Indies swarmed with the pests. The men living along the coast
found buccaneering so profitable that they gave up their peaceful
pursuits and became free-booters of the sea. Like the Spaniards
themselves, they were ferocious, and generally murdered the crews
of the captured vessels and then divided the plunder among themselves.</p>

<p>Seeing that something must be done to check these intolerable
outrages, our Government gave the task, in 1819, to Oliver Hazard
Perry, the hero of Lake Erie. His work was more difficult than
would be supposed, for, in addition to destroying the pirates,
he had to avoid offending the countries named, with whom we wished
to maintain friendly relations. They sent out regular cruisers
that had the same right to prey upon Spanish commerce that our
privateers had to attack English ships when we were at war with
their country. Some of these cruisers secretly engaged in piracy;
many that flew the black flag, in the presence of those who could
not defend themselves, claimed to be authorized privateers at
other times and carried forged commissions. They were treacherous,
cruel and merciless to the last degree.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the task assigned to Captain
Perry required quick decision, courage and discretion. He possessed
all those qualities in a high degree, and, in the performance
of his duty, reached the mouth of the Orinoco in July, 1815, in
command of three powerful ships. The following extract from his
journal will give a vivid idea of the discomforts which he and
his men underwent in the performance of their work:</p>

<p>"The sun, as soon as it shows itself in the morning, strikes
almost through you. Mosquitoes, sand flies and gnats cover you,
and as the sun gets up higher it becomes entirely calm and the
rays pour down a heat that is insufferable. The fever that it
creates, together with the irritation caused by the insects, produces
a thirst which is insatiable, to quench which we drink water at
a temperature of eighty-two degrees. About four o'clock in the
afternoon a rain squall, accompanied by a little wind, generally
takes place. It might be supposed that this would cool the air,
but not so, for the steam which arises as soon as the sun comes
out makes the heat still more intolerable. At length night approaches
and we go close inshore and anchor. Myriads of mosquitoes and
gnats come off to the vessel and compel us to sit over strong
smoke created by burning oakum and tar, rather than endure their
terrible stings, until, wearied and exhausted, we go to bed to
endure new torments. Shut up in the berth of a small cabin, if
there is any air stirring, not a breath of it can reach us. The
mosquitoes, more persevering, follow us and annoy us the whole
night by their noise and bites until, almost mad with heat and
pain, we rise to go through the same trouble the next day."</p>

<p>Perry sailed three hundred miles up the Orinoco and was undaunted
by the fact that the dreaded yellow fever soon appeared among
his men. He was seized with the terrible disease and died on the
24th of August. He was buried with the highest civic and military
honors at Trinidad, many British officers who had fought against
him on Lake Erie showing their respect for his bravery and an
appreciation of his kindness to them when they were prisoners
of war. His remains were afterward removed to Newport, Rhode Island,
where a magnificent monument was erected to his memory.</p>

<p>The untimely death of this naval hero before he had time to complete
his work encouraged the West Indian pirates and they became more
audacious than before. In the autumn of 1821 several naval vessels
were sent thither by our Government. They did vigorous work, capturing
and destroying a number of piratical vessels, but there were too
many of them, and they were spread over too extended a space to
be wiped out by a few captures. In the following year a still
more powerful squadron went to the West Indies under the command
of Captain James Biddle, who did such valiant service in the War
of 1812. A good many buccaneers were destroyed, including several
leaders of the buccaneers whose atrocious deeds had long made
their names a terror. In one of these attacks Lieutenant William
H. Allen, of the schooner <em>Alligator</em>, was killed by a
musket ball. His gallantry in the fight between the <em>Argus</em>
and <em>Pelican</em> in the war with Great Britain sent a thrill
of admiration through the country and brought him well-merited
promotion.</p>

<p>You have not forgotten the wonderful cruise of Captain David
Porter in the <em>Essex</em>, when he entered the Pacific Ocean
and caused such havoc among the British shipping. He was appointed
commander of the West India forces and arrived off Porto Rico
in March, 1823. He was provided, in addition to his warships,
with a number of barges, furnished with twenty oars apiece, and
which were indispensable in following the pirates up the shallow
creeks and into the shoal waters where the vessels could not go.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>OUR FLEET IN THE BALTIC</em>.]</p>

<p>Captain Porter was discreet but impatient with injustice. When
one of his schooners was fired into by the Porto Rican authorities
he promptly demanded an explanation, which was given. The most
important incident of his service occurred in the autumn of 1824
and is known as the "Foxardo Affair."</p>

<p>In October of that year the storehouse of the American consul
at St. Thomas was broken into and robbed of much valuable property
which there was reason to believe had been carried to the small
port at the eastern end of Porto Rico known as Foxardo. Lieutenant
Platt, of the <em>Beagle</em>, anchored off the town and asked
the help of the authorities in capturing the criminals and recovering
the property. The officer was treated with the grossest discourtesy.
Having landed in civilian clothes, the authorities accused him
of being an impostor and ordered him to show his commission. The
Lieutenant produced it, whereupon they declared it a forgery and
arrested him on the charge of being a pirate. After he and a midshipman
who accompanied him had been insulted repeatedly they were allowed
to leave.</p>

<p>When Captain Porter learned of this outrage he entered the harbor
with several of his vessels and sent a letter to the alcalde or
governor, notifying him that he had one hour in which to send
an explanation of his action. While waiting for the return of
the flag of truce Captain Porter saw one of the shore batteries
getting ready to fire upon him. Instantly, he sent a detachment,
which captured the battery and spiked the guns. Then Captain Porter
landed, and, after spiking another battery, made his way to the
town. By and by the alcalde and captain of the port appeared and
made such profuse and humble apologies that the officer could
not refuse to accept them, and returned to his ship.</p>

<p>Such is a truthful account of the incident as it occurred. It
would seem that there was nothing in the course of the gallant
naval officer that deserved censure. One of his officers had been
insulted and he compelled the offenders to make a suitable apology.
Fearing with good reason a treacherous attack from the batteries
on shore, he spiked their guns. But when the news reached our
Government Captain Porter was ordered home, tried by court martial
and sentenced to be suspended from the service for six months.
Feeling himself unjustly treated, Captain Porter resigned and
entered the Mexican navy, where he remained until 1829. In that
year Andrew Jackson became President of the United States. He
had been through trying and stormy times himself and would never
submit to insult from any man or nation. He appointed Porter consul
general at Algiers. He afterward became minister to Turkey and
died March 28, 1843.</p>

<p>Captain Lewis Warrington succeeded Porter in the West Indies
and followed out his aggressive policy. The buccaneers were hunted
down without cessation and nest after nest broken up until, at
the close of 1825, piracy in those waters was practically suppressed.
For several years, however, a squadron was maintained there and
more than once its services were needed, but the work was completed
and since then no trouble in that quarter of the world of the
nature described has plagued either ourselves or any other nation.</p>

<p>Even in the Mediterranean our navy had similar work to do. While
little Greece was making so gallant a struggle for freedom against
Turkey a number of her vessels played the rôle of pirate and attacked
ships of other nations. Among others, an English brig had been
seized, but Lieutenant Lewis M. Goldsborough, after a furious
fight, recaptured the vessel. Lieutenant John A. Carr singled
out the Greek captain and in the fierce hand-to-hand conflict
killed him. Lieutenant Goldsborough&mdash;who afterward became rear-admiral&mdash;received
the thanks of several of the Mediterranean powers for his assistance
in ridding the waters of the pirates who, though few in number,
became exceedingly troublesome.</p>

<p>It was by such prompt, vigorous and brave measures that the American
navy compelled the respect not only of civilized but of barbarous
peoples in all parts of the world. This fact is proven by a remarkable
occurrence, not often mentioned in history, the particulars of
which are given in the next chapter.</p>
