<p>There were many things that did not please Grumpy Weasel--things that
almost any one else would have liked. For instance, there was music. The
Pleasant Valley Singing Society, to which most of the bird people
belonged, did not number Grumpy Weasel among its admirers. He never
cared to hear a bird sing--not even Jolly Robin's cousin the Hermit, who
was one of the most beautiful singers in the woods. And as for Buddy
Brown Thrasher, whom most people thought a brilliant performer, Grumpy
Weasel always groaned whenever he heard him singing in the topmost
branches of a tree.
</p>
<p>A bird-song--according to Grumpy Weasel--was of use in only one way: it
told you where the bird was. And that was a help, of course, if you were
trying to catch him.
</p><p>Nor did the musical Frog family's nightly concerts have much charm for
Grumpy, though he did admit that some of their songs were not so bad as
others.
</p><p>"I can stand it now and then," he said, "to hear a good, glum croaking,
provided there are plenty of discords."
</p><p>Naturally, knowing how he felt, Grumpy Weasel's neighbors never invited
him to listen to their concerts. On the contrary they usually asked him
please to go away, if he happened to come along. Certainly nobody could
sing his best, with such a listener.
</p><p>As a rule Grumpy Weasel was glad to go on about his business, though to
be sure he hated to oblige anybody. But one day he stopped and scolded
at the top of his voice when he came upon the Woodchuck brothers
whistling in the pasture.
</p><p>Their whistles quavered a bit when they noticed who was present. And
they moved a little nearer their front door, in order to dodge out of
sight if need be. Although Grumpy Weasel might follow them, there was a
back door they could rush out of. And since they knew their way about
their underground halls better than he did they did not worry greatly.
</p><p>"We're sorry--" said the biggest brother, who was called Billy
Woodchuck--"we're sorry you don't like our music. And we'd like to know
what's the matter with it; for we always strive to please."
</p><p>"It's not so much the way you whistle," Grumpy snarled, "though your
whistling is bad enough, it's so cheerful. What I find fault with
especially is the tune. It's insulting to me. And you can't deny it."
</p><p>Well, the Woodchuck brothers looked at one another in a puzzled fashion.
</p><p>"Never again let me hear you whistling, 'Pop! Goes the Weasel,'" Grumpy
warned them. That was the name of the Woodchuck brothers' favorite air,
and the one they could whistle best. And any one could see that they
were quite upset.
</p><p>"Why don't you like that tune?" Billy Woodchuck asked Grumpy Weasel
politely.
</p><p>"It's that word 'pop,'" Grumpy said. "It reminds me of a pop-gun. And a
pop-gun reminds me of a real gun. And that's something I don't want to
think about."
</p><p>Well, the Woodchuck brothers looked at one another again. But this time
they smiled.
</p><p>"You've misunderstood," Billy Woodchuck told Grumpy Weasel. "This is a
different kind of <u>pop</u>. It means that when you enter a hole you <u>pop</u>
into it in a jiffy, without taking all day to do it."
</p><p>For a wonder Grumpy Weasel was almost pleased.
</p><p>"That's true!" he cried. "I couldn't be slow if I wanted to be!" And he
actually asked the Woodchuck brothers to whistle "Pop! Goes the Weasel"
once more.
</p><p>But Grumpy Weasel never thought of thanking them.
