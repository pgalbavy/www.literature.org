<p>Enough has been already told for the reader to understand the
scheme which Jennie Whitney, with the help of her mother, attempted
to carry out for the benefit of the besieged cattlemen.</p>

<p>With her cloak around her shoulders and her saddle supported
on one arm, she passed quickly from the rear of her home to the
stables, only a short distance away. She had been on the alert
for the signal of Duke Vesey, and, seeing it not, was prepared
to encounter some one else.</p>

<p>In this she was not disappointed, for at the moment of catching
sight of the dark mass where the horses were sheltered the figure
of a man loomed into view as though he had risen from the ground.
She stopped short, and observed, dimly, the forms of two others
just behind him.</p>

<p>"Halloo!" exclaimed the nearest, "how is this?"</p>

<p>With peculiar emotions the young lady recognized the voice of
Larch Cadmus. She hoped this was a favourable omen, and was quick
to turn it to account.</p>

<p>"Larch, is that you?" she asked, peering forward as if uncertain
of his identity.</p>

<p>"I declare, it is Miss Jennie!" he exclaimed, coming forward;
"how is it you are alone?"</p>

<p>"Mother did not wish to come with me," replied the daughter,
trying to avoid the necessity of direct deceit. "She will probably
leave the house pretty soon."</p>

<p>The fellow was plainly embarrassed, despite the protecting gloom
which concealed his features. Jennie knew him to be one of her
most ardent admirers, though she had never liked him. Her hopes
were now based upon making use of his regard for her.</p>

<p>"You have come out, Jennie, I suppose," said he, offering his
hand, which she accepted, "so as not to be in the house when the&mdash;ah,
trouble begins."</p>

<p>"O, I know it will be dreadful; I want to go as far away as I
can&mdash;do you blame me, Larch?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all; and I hope, Jennie, you don't blame
me for all that your folks have suffered."</p>

<p>"Why, Larch, why should I blame you?" asked the young lady, coming
fearfully near a fiction in making the query, for she knew many
good reasons for censuring him in her heart. "But how soon do
you intend&mdash;that is, how soon do the rest of your folks intend
to attack the cowmen?"</p>

<p>"We&mdash;that is, they&mdash;expected to do so long ago, but there have
been all sorts of delays; it will come pretty soon now."</p>

<p>"Where are you to place mother and me?"</p>

<p>"Over the ridge, yonder; you will be out of danger; you need
fear nothing; why should you, for your mother will be with you
and your brother will be with us, so that he can take no part
in the fight."</p>

<p>He made no reference to Mont Sterry, and she was too wise to
let fall a hint of her anxiety concerning him.</p>

<p>"But, Larch, suppose, when you set fire to the house, as I heard
your folks intended, our people rush out and attack you?"</p>

<p>"Do they intend to do that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know; but you can see, if they do, the shooting
will be going on all around mother and me."</p>

<p>"You can pass farther out on the plain or take shelter in the
stable, among the horses."</p>

<p>"But that may be too late," interposed Jennie, in well-feigned
alarm.</p>

<p>"You can take refuge here now."</p>

<p>"I can't bear to stay in the stable, for the horses will become
terrified when the shooting begins; they may break loose and prove
more dangerous than the flying bullets."</p>

<p>There was sense in this objection, and the rustler saw it. He
was anxious to propitiate the young woman, whom he admired so
ardently.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what would you like to do?"</p>

<p>"Now, Larch, you won't laugh at me if I tell you," she replied,
in her most coquettish manner.</p>

<p>"Laugh at you!" he protested; "this is no time for laughing;
it was a shame that those people should turn your house into a
fort, when it could do them no good. Tell me what you want and
it shall be done, if it is in my power."</p>

<p>"Thanks! You are very kind, and I shall never forget this favour;
I want to mount one of the best horses in the stable and ride
out so far that I am sure to be beyond reach of danger."</p>

<p>The proposition staggered the rustler&mdash;so much so that it did
not occur to him, just then, that the daughter appeared a great
deal more anxious to look after her own safety than her mother's.</p>

<p>"You have a horse in the stable, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Jack is there, and he is a splendid fellow; he is the one
I want."</p>

<p>"But the saddle?"</p>

<p>"I have it with me; here it is; you and I will adjust it together."</p>

<p>And the impulsive miss placed the saddle in his grasp before
he knew it. She certainly was rushing things. It must be admitted,
too, that she showed fine discretion. There was but one way of
handling Mr. Larch Cadmus, and she was using that way.</p>

<p>He turned about and walked to the door of the stable.</p>

<p>"Jack is in the second stall," she said, pausing at the entrance,
"and his bridle is on the hook near his head."</p>

<p>The gloom was impenetrable, but a couple of matches gave Cadmus
all the light needed, and a minute later he brought forth the
fine animal, who whinnied with pleasure at recognizing his mistress,
despite the gloom.</p>

<p>Jennie gave what help she could in saddling and bridling him,
the other two men standing a little way off in silence. She kept
up an incessant chatter, repeating her thanks to Cadmus for his
kindness, and binding him more completely captive every minute.</p>

<p>But the rustler was inclined to be thoughtful, for before the
animal was ready he began to feel misgivings as to the prudence
of what he was doing. There was something odd, too, about the
young lady mounting her pony, riding alone out on the plain, and
leaving her mother behind. Then, too, she had emerged from the
rear instead of the front of the house, as he judged from her
line of approach.</p>

<p>Could there be any ulterior purpose in all this? If she would
only cease her chatting for a minute or two he might figure out
the problem, but the trouble was, nothing could stop her. In fact
he didn't wish her to stop, for that voice was the most musical
one to which he could listen, and he would have been glad had
it sounded for hours in his ears.</p>

<p>He managed to drift dangerously near the truth.</p>

<p>"Can it be that she intends to ride away for help?" he reflected.
"It has that look; but no, it is hardly that, for there isn't
any help within reach that I know of. She might find it in the
course of a day or two, but this affair will be over before daylight
&mdash;I beg pardon, what was it you said, Jennie?"</p>

<p>"Why, Larch, I'm tempted to pull your ears; you are a fine gallant;
here I have been standing full ten seconds, waiting for you to
help me on the horse, and you have paid me no attention."</p>

<p>"It <em>was</em> rude, my dear; I hope you will pardon me," he
replied, stepping quickly forward, "but I am very absent-minded
to-night."</p>

<p>"I will pardon you, of course, for you have been so good and
nice that it would be ungrateful for me to be impatient."</p>

<p>He took the Cinderella-like foot in his broad palm and cleverly
assisted her in the saddle. While he helped to adjust the reins,
her tongue rattled on harder than ever.</p>

<p>"How far, Larch, will it be necessary for me to ride so as to
be sure&mdash;mind you, sure&mdash;of being out of the way when this awful
business opens?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say a hundred yards or so will be enough&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mercy! do you think so? I ought to go two or three times as
far as that; you won't object, will you? and when the shooting
<em>does</em> begin, I can hurry Jack farther off."</p>

<p>"Do as you think best; but it seems to me, Jennie, that you are
forgetting your mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O, no; when Fred brings her out&mdash;maybe he has done so now&mdash;tell
her the direction I have gone and she will understand. Which is
the best course for me to take? I guess it don't make any difference,
so I will go this way."</p>

<p>Through all this apparently aimless chatter, Miss Jennie Whitney
was using her wits. She knew a long ride was before her, and everything
would be ruined if she lost her way. There was no moon or stars
to give guidance, and she therefore carefully took her bearings
while the chance was hers.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's all the same which course you follow, but I fear
I am doing wrong in allowing you to ride off&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, don't spoil everything by regretting the handsome way in
which you have indulged my whim; I think I will ride over the
ridge to the left&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Jennie, until I can speak to Inman; he may object&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can speak to him after I am gone; good-night, Larch, and
many thanks again for your kindness."</p>

<p>She rode off with her intelligent Jack on a walk until she was
clear of the camp, when she touched him into an easy gallop.</p>

<p>Larch Cadmus stood looking into the gloom where she had vanished,
almost before he comprehended her intention.</p>

<p>"Well, she's a puzzle!" he exclaimed to his two companions, who
came forward; "I don't know what to make of her. What do you suppose
she meant by that, boys?"</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to see," replied one of them, with a laugh;
"she's gone off after help."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked the startled Cadmus; "where can she
get it?"</p>

<p>"She may bring back their hands."</p>

<p>"There are only two of them," said Larch, much relieved, "and
they won't amount to anything in the rumpus. You don't imagine
that she knows of any larger force anywhere in the neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>"She can't know of any, for there ain't any," was the clincher
of the rustler; "or, if there is, she can't get it here in time
to do Asbury and the rest any good."</p>

<p>Cadmus was relieved by the words of his friend. Enough misgivings,
however, remained to make him say:</p>

<p>"There are so many moving about that her departure don't seem
to be noticed; I'll take it as a favour if you don't mention it
to any one, for now that she is gone I am sure I never should
have allowed it."</p>

<p>The couple gave the promise, though their belief was that nothing
serious would follow.</p>

<p>Leaving the two to keep watch at the stables, Cadmus sauntered
to where Inman was seated near the camp-fire, smoking a pipe.
A little inquiry disclosed that neither the leader nor any of
his companions had noticed the departure of the young lady.</p>

<p>It was some time after this that Duke Vesey brought the report
of Mrs. Whitney's illness as an explanation of her son's delay
in returning to the camp of the rustlers.</p>

<p>Exasperated, and suspecting a pretense, Inman consented to a
brief postponement of the attack.</p>

<p>The next startling occurrence was the capture of Monteith Sterry
while trying to steal through the lines. As we have shown, he
was identified the instant he was brought into the reflection
of the firelight, and such precautions were taken that escape
by him was out of the question.</p>

<p>When their impatience could stand it no longer, Vesey was sent
to Capt. Asbury with the message which he delivered. Instead of
his returning with a reply, Fred Whitney came back, bringing the
announcement that Vesey had entered the house without claiming
the protection of a truce, and after telling what he was directed
to tell about Monteith Sterry, Capt. Asbury had directed Whitney
to notify Capt. Inman that he would retain Vesey as a hostage,
guaranteeing that whatever harm was visited upon Sterry should
descend upon the head of Vesey.</p>

<p>This message, as may be supposed, caused consternation for some
minutes in the camp of the rustlers. The feeling was quickly succeeded
by exasperation. Had Inman and Cadmus been given the opportunity,
no doubt they could have made a good argument to prove that, inasmuch
as Vesey had passed back and forth several times after his first
announcement of a flag of truce, and its acceptance by the besieged
cowmen, it was not required by the law of nations that he should
proclaim the fact while continuing to act as messenger between
the hostiles.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the truth remained that he had entered the
house of the rancher with weapons in his hands and without any
claim of immunity from harm.</p>

<p>The question was such a nice one, capable of so many finely-drawn
theories, that it is useless to discuss it here. Whatever decision
we might reach, we could not feel assured we were right.</p>

<p>The hard fact confronted the rustlers that one of their principal
men was in the power of the cowmen and was held as a hostage for
the safety of the detested Monteith Sterry, who had been warned
that he would be shot on sight by any rustler who gained the chance.</p>

<p>The unexpected phase of the situation caused a long and angry
discussion between Capt. Ira Inman and his leaders, to which,
as may be supposed, Fred Whitney and Monteith Sterry paid close
attention.</p>
