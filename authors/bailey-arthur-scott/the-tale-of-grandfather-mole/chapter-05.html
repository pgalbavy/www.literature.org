<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>AFTER telling Jimmy Rabbit that he would meet him on the other side of
the duck-pond, Grandfather Mole waded into the water and started to swim
across.
</p>
<p>Why he did that, instead of walking around on the shore, Jimmy Rabbit
couldn't understand. He was so amazed that he stood still and stared at
Grandfather Mole.
</p><p>One thing was certain: Grandfather Mole could travel much faster through
the water than he could underground. His strong legs and his broad,
spade-like feet helped to make him a fine swimmer. And Jimmy Rabbit had
noticed for the first time that Grandfather Mole's hind feet were
webbed. It was no wonder that he felt quite at home in the duck-pond,
which was made for web-footed folk.
</p><p>Jimmy Rabbit was so interested in watching Grandfather Mole swim that he
didn't start to run around the pond until the swimmer had almost reached
the other side. Then Jimmy remembered suddenly that he had to meet
Grandfather Mole over there. So he raced along the edge of the duck-pond
at top speed. And since he was a very fast runner--for short
distances--he met Grandfather Mole just as the old chap was crawling up
the bank.
</p><p>"There!" Grandfather Mole exclaimed. "I almost beat you this time, young
man! If you're going to take a morning stroll with me you'll have to
step lively."
</p><p>Of course Jimmy Rabbit was too polite to explain that he had waited a
long time while Grandfather Mole was tunnelling his way from the garden
to the pond, and that he hadn't begun to run around the pond until
Grandfather Mole had swum almost across it. He merely smiled and replied
that he would do his best to keep up, for he shouldn't like to make
Grandfather Mole wait, especially since he had invited Grandfather Mole
to go walking with him.
</p><p>"You don't mind staying here in the sunshine, I hope, while my coat
dries?" Grandfather Mole inquired. "As soon as it's dry we'll start for
the meadow."
</p><p>Though Jimmy Rabbit was in a great hurry to reach the place where the
clover grew he said that he would be glad to wait with Grandfather Mole.
"The sun feels good on this cool morning," he observed. "And it's
cheerful, too."
</p><p>"Do you really think so?" Grandfather Mole asked him. And when Jimmy
Rabbit assured him that he did, Grandfather Mole muttered that it was
the strangest thing he ever heard of. As for him, he much preferred the
darkness of his cool, damp galleries under the ground. And the only
reason why he wanted his coat to dry was so that the dirt wouldn't stick
to it.
</p><p>It seemed to Jimmy Rabbit that Grandfather Mole's coat would never get
dry enough to suit the old gentleman. But at last he announced that he
was ready to stroll on. And when Jimmy Rabbit cried that he was ready,
too, Grandfather Mole said, "Then let's be on our way! And I'll meet
you----"
</p><p>"Where the clover grows!" Jimmy interrupted.
</p><p>Grandfather Mole had already buried his nose in the sand and was fast
digging himself out of sight. And Jimmy thought that if he must wait for
him again he would wait in a pleasant place.
</p><p>So Jimmy Rabbit hurried to the meadow. And as he lunched on luscious
clover-tops he reflected that Grandfather Mole had a queer notion of
taking a stroll with a friend. He made up his mind then and there that
he would never again invite Grandfather Mole to walk with him.
