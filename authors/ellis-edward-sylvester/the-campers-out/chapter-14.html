<p>Tom Wagstaff and Jim McGovern might well be puzzled at the sight
which greeted them while picking their way through the wood.</p>

<p>A strong light seemed to be shining through a screen. At first
it was stationary, its appearance preventing them from guessing
its nature. While they stood silent, wondering and frightened,
on the point of retreating, the shadow of a person glided in front
of the light. It was grotesque and gigantic, and flitted across
their field of vision, disappearing as quickly as it had come
to view. The next moment some one was seen holding a lamp in his
hand and peering out in the gloom.</p>

<p>Then the whole explanation broke upon them. They had come upon
a tent in the wood, the light shining through the canvas and producing
the effect which first puzzled them. The person inside passed
between them and the lamp, so that his shadow was flung on the
screen in front. Then he picked up the light, and pushing aside
the flap, peered out in the gloom.</p>

<p>As he did so the glare from the lamp fell upon his face and showed
his features so distinctly that both boys recognized him, and
uttered an exclamation of astonishment and delight.</p>

<p>"Bob Budd, as I live! Why, you’re the very fellow we’re looking
for!" called out Tom Wagstaff, as he and his companion hurried
forward and greeted their friend, whose amazement was equal to
theirs when he held the light above his head and recognized them.</p>

<p>"Where under the sun did you come from?" he asked, all three
walking into the tent after shaking hands, and seating themselves,
while the host set the light on a small stand at one side.</p>

<p>"I didn’t expect you for a week or two," added Bob, whose pleasure
could not be concealed.</p>

<p>"Well," replied Jim, with a laugh, "we set out to surprise you,
and I guess we succeeded."</p>

<p>"There’s no doubt of that," said Bob; "but tell me how you found
the way to this spot."</p>

<p>The visitors were not quite willing to give the whole truth,
and Tom ventured the explanation.</p>

<p>"We came most of the way in the cars," said he, "but got off
at a little station a few miles out to tramp across the country,
thinking we might pick up some game on the way. We didn’t make
out very well, and rode to Black Bear Swamp in the stage. There
we got out again and set out to find you."</p>

<p>"How did you know where to look?"</p>

<p>"The driver told us you had a camp out this way somewhere, and
we thought we might stumble over it."</p>

<p>This narrative was so brief in the way of details that the boys
ran some risk of having it overturned when the account of the
driver and his passenger should be heard, but fortunately for
them, Durrell and Lenman forebore any references to the unworthy
part played by the youths, and Bob Budd remained ignorant of the
real cause of the abrupt flight of his friends, and their taking
to the shelter of Black Bear Swamp.</p>

<p>"I’ve had the tent up for three days," added the host, who was
about the age of his guests, "and it’s so well stored with eatables
and drinkables that I come out every night to take a look at it,
so as to make sure no tramps or thieves are prowling around. I
was about to go home when you hailed me. Shall we go to the house
or stay here till morning?"</p>

<p>"I don’t see that this can be improved on," replied Tom, looking
admiringly about him; "we’re pretty well tuckered out, and I would
as lief stay here till morning anyway."</p>

<p>"Those are my sentiments," added Jim, much pleased with the survey.</p>

<p>"Then we’ll stay," said Bob; "I’m glad you’re suited. Where are
your trunks?"</p>

<p>"At the station at Piketon."</p>

<p>"I’ll send the checks over in the morning and have our man bring
them here. I have my own gun and some things to bring from the
house, and then we’ll be in shape for a good old time in the woods.
I guess, boys, a little refreshment won’t hurt us."</p>

<p>The liberality of Bob Budd’s Uncle Jim and Aunt Ruth, with whom
he lived (he having no parents or other near relatives), enabled
him to do about as he pleased, so far as his own pleasure and
self-indulgence were concerned. He quickly set a substantial lunch
before his guests, of which all partook. I am sorry to say that
strong drink formed a large part of the repast, all indulging
liberally, after which pipes and cigarettes were produced, and
they discussed their plans of enjoyment.</p>

<p>Wagstaff and McGovern did not hesitate to admit that they had
run away from home for the purpose of having this outing. The
fact that their parents were sure to be distressed over their
absence was a theme for jest instead of regret.</p>

<p>"They’ll learn to appreciate us when we go back," said Wagstaff,
with a laugh, as he puffed his villainous decoction of tobacco
and poison; "you see, if Jim and I went home now they would be
apt to scold; but they will be so glad at the end of a fortnight
that they’ll kill the fatted calf and make us welcome."</p>

<p>"A good idea," commented Bob, passing back the flask to McGovern;
"you see, my uncle and aunt love me so dearly that they don’t
object to anything I do, though now and then Aunt Ruth holds up
Dick Halliard as a model for me."</p>

<p>"We saw that lovely young man while we were in the stage," remarked
Wagstaff; "he went by us on his bicycle."</p>

<p>"Yes; he rides a wheel well, but it makes me mad to see him."</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"Well, he’s younger than me, and I used to go to school with
him; he’s one of those fellows who don’t like many things a wide-awake
chap like me does, and he has a way of telling you of it to your
face."</p>

<p>"That’s better than doing it behind your back," suggested Jim.</p>

<p>"He has no right to do it <em>at all</em>; what business is it
of his if I choose to smoke, take a drink now and then, and lay
out the other boys when they get impudent?"</p>

<p>"It’s nothing to him, of course; we’ll settle his hash for him
before we go back. I shouldn’t wonder," added Tom, with a wink,
"if he should find that bicycle of his missing some day."</p>

<p>"That would hit him harder than anything else," remarked Bob,
pleased with the remark; "I’ve thought of the same thing, but
haven’t had a good chance to spoil it. I say, boys, we’ll have
just the jolliest times you ever heard of."</p>

<p>"It won’t be <em>our</em> fault if we don’t," assented Jim, while
his companion nodded his head as an indorsement of the same views.</p>

<p>"Is there good hunting in these parts?"</p>

<p>"It, isn’t as good as up among the Adirondacks or out West in
the Rocky Mountains, but I think we can scare up some sport. I’ve
a good hunting dog, and as soon as we get things in shape we’ll
see what we can do. What sort of game do you prefer?"</p>

<p>"Anything will suit me—elephants, tigers, rhinoceroses, and the
like; or, if we can’t do better, I wouldn’t mind a bear or deer."</p>

<p>"I daresn’t promise much, but we’ll have the fun anyway, and
that’s what we all want more than anything else."</p>

<p>The boys kept up their conversation until the night was well
along, and all were in high spirits over the prospect. They smoked
and drank until, when they lay down in slumber, they were in that
plight that they did not waken till the sun was high in the heavens.</p>

<p>The day was so cloudy and overcast that, although it cleared
up before noon, they decided to defer their hunting excursion
until the following morning, or perhaps the one succeeding that.
Tom and Jim accompanied Bob to his uncle’s, where they were made
welcome by his relatives, though it must be said that neither
was specially pleased with their looks and conduct. They made
themselves at home from the first, and their conversation was
loud and coarse; but then they were friends of the petted nephew,
and <em>that</em> was all sufficient.</p>

<p>The trunks were brought from the railway station by Uncle Jim’s
coachman and taken to the camp of the Piketon Rangers. By that
time the news of the attempt to rob the stage had spread, and
caused great excitement in the town and neighborhood. Tom and
Jim, finding no reference to them in the accounts, deemed it best
to say nothing, since they might have found it hard to make it
appear that they had acted bravely at a time when such a fine
chance was offered to play the hero.</p>

<p>That afternoon the three fully established themselves in the
tent of Bob Budd. The day had cleared up beautifully, but it was
too late to start out on the great hunt they had fixed their hearts
on, and toward night they separated to take a stroll through the
surrounding country, with which they wished to become familiar.
They believed this could be done better if they should part company,
since each would be obliged to keep his senses about him, and
to watch his footsteps more closely than if he had a guide in
the person of Bob Budd, their friend and host.</p>
