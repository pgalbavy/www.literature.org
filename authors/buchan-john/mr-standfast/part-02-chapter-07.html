<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>This is the story which I heard later from Mary....</p>

<p>She was at Milan with the new Anglo-American hospital when she
got Blenkiron’s letter. Santa Chiara had always been the place
agreed upon, and this message mentioned specifically Santa Chiara,
and fixed a date for her presence there. She was a little puzzled
by it, for she had not yet had a word from Ivery, to whom she
had written twice by the roundabout address in France which Bommaerts
had given her. She did not believe that he would come to Italy
in the ordinary course of things, and she wondered at Blenkiron’s
certainty about the date.</p>

<p>The following morning came a letter from Ivery in which he ardently
pressed for a meeting. It was the first of several, full of strange
talk about some approaching crisis, in which the forebodings of
the prophet were mingled with the solicitude of a lover.</p>

<p>"The storm is about to break," he wrote, "and I cannot think
only of my own fate. I have something to tell you which vitally
concerns yourself. You say you are in Lombardy. The Chiavagno
valley is within easy reach, and at its head is the inn of Santa
Chiara, to which I come on the morning of March 19th. Meet me
there even if only for half an hour, I implore you. We have already
shared hopes and confidences, and I would now share with you a
knowledge which I alone in Europe possess. You have the heart
of a lion, my lady, worthy of what I can bring you."</p>

<p>Wake was summoned from the <em>Croce Rossa</em> unit with which
he was working at Vicenza, and the plan arranged by Blenkiron
was faithfully carried out. Four officers of the Alpini, in the
rough dress of peasants of the hills, met them in Chiavagno on
the morning of the 18th. It was arranged that the hostess of Santa
Chiara should go on a visit to her sister’s son, leaving the inn,
now in the shuttered quiet of wintertime, under the charge of
two ancient servants. The hour of Ivery’s coming on the 19th had
been fixed by him for noon, and that morning Mary would drive
up the valley, while Wake and the Alpini went inconspicuously
by other routes so as to be in station around the place before
midday.</p>

<p>But on the evening of the 18th at the Hotel of the Four Kings
in Chiavagno Mary received another message. It was from me and
told her that I was crossing the Staub at midnight and would be
at the inn before dawn. It begged her to meet me there, to meet
me alone without the others, because I had that to say to her
which must be said before Ivery’s coming. I have seen the letter.
It was written in a hand which I could not have distinguished
from my own scrawl. It was not exactly what I would myself have
written, but there were phrases in it which to Mary’s mind could
have come only from me. Oh, I admit it was cunningly done, especially
the love-making, which was just the kind of stammering thing which
I would have achieved if I had tried to put my feelings on paper.
Anyhow, Mary had no doubt of its genuineness. She slipped off
after dinner, hired a carriage with two broken-winded screws and
set off up the valley. She left a line for Wake telling him to
follow according to the plan—a line which he never got, for his
anxiety when he found she had gone drove him to immediate pursuit.</p>

<p>At about two in the morning of the 19th after a slow and icy
journey she arrived at the inn, knocked up the aged servants,
made herself a cup of chocolate out of her tea-basket and sat
down to wait on my coming.</p>

<p>She has described to me that time of waiting. A home-made candle
in a tall earthenware candlestick lit up the little <em>salle-à-manger</em>,
which was the one room in use. The world was very quiet, the snow
muffled the roads, and it was cold with the penetrating chill
of the small hours of a March night. Always, she has told me,
will the taste of chocolate and the smell of burning tallow bring
back to her that strange place and the flutter of the heart with
which she waited. For she was on the eve of the crisis of all
our labours, she was very young, and youth has a quick fancy which
will not be checked. Moreover, it was I who was coming, and save
for the scrawl of the night before, we had had no communication
for many weeks.... She tried to distract her mind by repeating
poetry, and the thing that came into her head was Keats’s "Nightingale",
an odd poem for the time and place.</p>

<p>There was a long wicker chair among the furnishings of the room,
and she lay down on it with her fur cloak muffled around her.
There were sounds of movement in the inn. The old woman who had
let her in, with the scent of intrigue of her kind, had brightened
when she heard that another guest was coming. Beautiful women
do not travel at midnight for nothing. She also was awake and
expectant.</p>

<p>Then quite suddenly came the sound of a car slowing down outside.
She sprang to her feet in a tremor of excitement. It was like
the Picardy château again—the dim room and a friend coming out
of the night. She heard the front door open and a step in the
little hall....</p>

<p>She was looking at Ivery.... He slipped his driving-coat off
as he entered, and bowed gravely. He was wearing a green hunting
suit which in the dusk seemed like khaki, and, as he was about
my own height, for a second she was misled. Then she saw his face
and her heart stopped.</p>

<p>"You!" she cried. She had sunk back again on the wicker chair.</p>

<p>"I have come as I promised," he said, "but a little earlier.
You will forgive me my eagerness to be with you."</p>

<p>She did not heed his words, for her mind was feverishly busy.
My letter had been a fraud and this man had discovered our plans.
She was alone with him, for it would be hours before her friends
came from Chiavagno. He had the game in his hands, and of all
our confederacy she alone remained to confront him. Mary’s courage
was pretty near perfect, and for the moment she did not think
of herself or her own fate. That came later. She was possessed
with poignant disappointment at our failure. All our efforts had
gone to the winds, and the enemy had won with contemptuous ease.
Her nervousness disappeared before the intense regret, and her
brain set coolly and busily to work.</p>

<p>It was a new Ivery who confronted her, a man with vigour and
purpose in every line of him and the quiet confidence of power.
He spoke with a serious courtesy.</p>

<p>"The time for make-believe is past," he was saying. "We have
fenced with each other. I have told you only half the truth, and
you have always kept me at arm’s length. But you knew in your
heart, my dearest lady, that there must be the full truth between
us some day, and that day has come. I have often told you that
I love you. I do not come now to repeat that declaration. I come
to ask you to entrust yourself to me, to join your fate to mine,
for I can promise you the happiness which you deserve."</p>

<p>He pulled up a chair and sat beside her. I cannot put down all
that he said, for Mary, once she grasped the drift of it, was
busy with her own thoughts and did not listen. But I gather from
her that he was very candid and seemed to grow as he spoke in
mental and moral stature. He told her who he was and what his
work had been. He claimed the same purpose as hers, a hatred of
war and a passion to rebuild the world into decency. But now he
drew a different moral. He was a German: it was through Germany
alone that peace and regeneration could come. His country was
purged from her faults, and the marvellous German discipline was
about to prove itself in the eye of gods and men. He told her
what he had told me in the room at the Pink Chalet, but with another
colouring. Germany was not vengeful or vainglorious, only patient
and merciful. God was about to give her the power to decide the
world’s fate, and it was for him and his kind to see that the
decision was beneficent. The greater task of his people was only
now beginning.</p>

<p>That was the gist of his talk. She appeared to listen, but her
mind was far away. She must delay him for two hours, three hours,
four hours. If not, she must keep beside him. She was the only
one of our company left in touch with the enemy....</p>

<p>"I go to Germany now," he was saying. "I want you to come with
me—to be my wife."</p>

<p>He waited for an answer, and got it in the form of a startled
question.</p>

<p>"To Germany? How?"</p>

<p>"It is easy," he said, smiling. "The car which is waiting outside
is the first stage of a system of travel which we have perfected."
Then he told her about the Underground Railway—not as he had told
it to me, to scare, but as a proof of power and forethought.</p>

<p>His manner was perfect. He was respectful, devoted, thoughtful
of all things. He was the suppliant, not the master. He offered
her power and pride, a dazzling career, for he had deserved well
of his country, the devotion of the faithful lover. He would take
her to his mother’s house, where she would be welcomed like a
princess. I have no doubt he was sincere, for he had many moods,
and the libertine whom he had revealed to me at the Pink Chalet
had given place to the honourable gentleman. He could play all
parts well because he could believe in himself in them all.</p>

<p>Then he spoke of danger, not so as to slight her courage, but
to emphasise his own thoughtfulness. The world in which she had
lived was crumbling, and he alone could offer a refuge. She felt
the steel gauntlet through the texture of the velvet glove.</p>

<p>All the while she had been furiously thinking, with her chin
in her hand in the old way.... She might refuse to go. He could
compel her, no doubt, for there was no help to be got from the
old servants. But it might be difficult to carry an unwilling
woman over the first stages of the Underground Railway. There
might be chances.... Supposing he accepted her refusal and left
her. Then indeed he would be gone for ever and our game would
have closed with a fiasco. The great antagonist of England would
go home rejoicing, taking his sheaves with him.</p>

<p>At this time she had no personal fear of him. So curious a thing
is the human heart that her main preoccupation was with our mission,
not with her own fate. To fail utterly seemed too bitter. Supposing
she went with him. They had still to get out of Italy and cross
Switzerland. If she were with him she would be an emissary of
the Allies in the enemy’s camp. She asked herself what could she
do, and told herself "Nothing." She felt like a small bird in
a very large trap, and her chief sensation was that of her own
powerlessness. But she had learned Blenkiron’s gospel and knew
that Heaven sends amazing chances to the bold. And, even as she
made her decision, she was aware of a dark shadow lurking at the
back of her mind, the shadow of the fear which she knew was awaiting
her. For she was going into the unknown with a man whom she hated,
a man who claimed to be her lover.</p>

<p>It was the bravest thing I have ever heard of, and I have lived
my life among brave men.</p>

<p>"I will come with you," she said. "But you mustn’t speak to me,
please. I am tired and troubled and I want peace to think."</p>

<p>As she rose weakness came over her and she swayed till his arm
caught her. "I wish I could let you rest for a little," he said
tenderly, "but time presses. The car runs smoothly and you can
sleep there."</p>

<p>He summoned one of the servants to whom he handed Mary. "We leave
in ten minutes," he said, and he went out to see to the car.</p>

<p>Mary’s first act in the bedroom to which she was taken was to
bathe her eyes and brush her hair. She felt dimly that she must
keep her head clear. Her second was to scribble a note to Wake,
telling him what had happened, and to give it to the servant with
a tip.</p>

<p>"The gentleman will come in the morning," she said. "You must
give it him at once, for it concerns the fate of your country."
The woman grinned and promised. It was not the first time she
had done errands for pretty ladies.</p>

<p>Ivery settled her in the great closed car with much solicitude,
and made her comfortable with rugs. Then he went back to the inn
for a second, and she saw a light move in the <em>salle-à-manger</em>.
He returned and spoke to the driver in German, taking his seat
beside him.</p>

<p>But first he handed Mary her note to Wake. "I think you left
this behind you," he said. He had not opened it.</p>

<p>Alone in the car Mary slept. She saw the figures of Ivery and
the chauffeur in the front seat dark against the headlights, and
then they dislimned into dreams. She had undergone a greater strain
than she knew, and was sunk in the heavy sleep of weary nerves.</p>

<p>When she woke it was daylight. They were still in Italy, as her
first glance told her, so they could not have taken the Staub
route. They seemed to be among the foothills, for there was little
snow, but now and then up tributary valleys she had glimpses of
the high peaks. She tried hard to think what it could mean, and
then remembered the Marjolana. Wake had laboured to instruct her
in the topography of the Alps, and she had grasped the fact of
the two open passes. But the Marjolana meant a big circuit, and
they would not be in Switzerland till the evening. They would
arrive in the dark, and pass out of it in the dark, and there
would be no chance of succour. She felt very lonely and very weak.</p>

<p>Throughout the morning her fear grew. The more hopeless her chance
of defeating Ivery became the more insistently the dark shadow
crept over her mind. She tried to steady herself by watching the
show from the windows. The car swung through little villages,
past vineyards and pine-woods and the blue of lakes, and over
the gorges of mountain streams. There seemed to be no trouble
about passports. The sentries at the controls waved a reassuring
hand when they were shown some card which the chauffeur held between
his teeth. In one place there was a longish halt, and she could
hear Ivery talking Italian with two officers of Bersaglieri, to
whom he gave cigars. They were fresh-faced, upstanding boys, and
for a second she had an idea of flinging open the door and appealing
to them to save her. But that would have been futile, for Ivery
was clearly amply certificated. She wondered what part he was
now playing.</p>

<p>The Marjolana route had been chosen for a purpose. In one town
Ivery met and talked to a civilian official, and more than once
the car slowed down and someone appeared from the wayside to speak
a word and vanish. She was assisting at the last gathering up
of the threads of a great plan, before the Wild Birds returned
to their nest. Mostly these conferences seemed to be in Italian,
but once or twice she gathered from the movement of the lips that
German was spoken and that this rough peasant or that black-hatted
bourgeois was not of Italian blood.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, soon after she awoke, Ivery had stopped
the car and offered her a well-provided luncheon basket. She could
eat nothing, and watched him breakfast off sandwiches beside the
driver. In the afternoon he asked her permission to sit with her.
The car drew up in a lonely place, and a tea-basket was produced
by the chauffeur. Ivery made tea, for she seemed too listless
to move, and she drank a cup with him. After that he remained
beside her.</p>

<p>"In half an hour we shall be out of Italy," he said. The car
was running up a long valley to the curious hollow between snowy
saddles which is the crest of the Marjolana. He showed her the
place on a road map. As the altitude increased and the air grew
colder he wrapped the rugs closer around her and apologised for
the absence of a foot-warmer. "In a little," he said, "we shall
be in the land where your slightest wish will be law."</p>

<p>She dozed again and so missed the frontier post. When she woke
the car was slipping down the long curves of the Weiss valley,
before it narrows to the gorge through which it debouches on Grünewald.</p>

<p>"We are in Switzerland now," she heard his voice say. It may
have been fancy, but it seemed to her that there was a new note
in it. He spoke to her with the assurance of possession. They
were outside the country of the Allies, and in a land where his
web was thickly spread.</p>

<p>"Where do we stop tonight?" she asked timidly.</p>

<p>"I fear we cannot stop. Tonight also you must put up with the
car. I have a little errand to do on the way, which will delay
us a few minutes, and then we press on. Tomorrow, my fairest one,
fatigue will be ended."</p>

<p>There was no mistake now about the note of possession in his
voice. Mary’s heart began to beat fast and wild. The trap had
closed down on her and she saw the folly of her courage. It had
delivered her bound and gagged into the hands of one whom she
loathed more deeply every moment, whose proximity was less welcome
than a snake’s. She had to bite hard on her lip to keep from screaming.</p>

<p>The weather had changed and it was snowing hard, the same storm
that had greeted us on the Col of the Swallows. The pace was slower
now, and Ivery grew restless. He looked frequently at his watch,
and snatched the speaking-tube to talk to the driver. Mary caught
the word "St Anton".</p>

<p>"Do we go by St Anton?" she found voice to ask.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said shortly.</p>

<p>The word gave her the faintest glimmering of hope, for she knew
that Peter and I had lived at St Anton. She tried to look out
of the blurred window, but could see nothing except that the twilight
was falling. She begged for the road-map, and saw that so far
as she could make out they were still in the broad Grünewald valley
and that to reach St Anton they had to cross the low pass from
the Staubthal. The snow was still drifting thick and the car crawled.</p>

<p>Then she felt the rise as they mounted to the pass. Here the
going was bad, very different from the dry frost in which I had
covered the same road the night before. Moreover, there seemed
to be curious obstacles. Some careless wood-cart had dropped logs
on the highway, and more than once both Ivery and the chauffeur
had to get out to shift them. In one place there had been a small
landslide which left little room to pass, and Mary had to descend
and cross on foot while the driver took the car over alone. Ivery’s
temper seemed to be souring. To the girl’s relief he resumed the
outside seat, where he was engaged in constant argument with the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>At the head of the pass stands an inn, the comfortable hostelry
of Herr Kronig, well known to all who clamber among the lesser
peaks of the Staubthal. There in the middle of the way stood a
man with a lantern.</p>

<p>"The road is blocked by a snowfall," he cried. "They are clearing
it now. It will be ready in half an hour’s time."</p>

<p>Ivery sprang from his seat and darted into the hotel. His business
was to speed up the clearing party, and Herr Kronig himself accompanied
him to the scene of the catastrophe. Mary sat still, for she had
suddenly become possessed of an idea. She drove it from her as
foolishness, but it kept returning. Why had those tree-trunks
been spilt on the road? Why had an easy pass after a moderate
snowfall been suddenly closed?</p>

<p>A man came out of the inn-yard and spoke to the chauffeur. It
seemed to be an offer of refreshment, for the latter left his
seat and disappeared inside. He was away for some time and returned
shivering and grumbling at the weather, with the collar of his
greatcoat turned up around his ears. A lantern had been hung in
the porch and as he passed Mary saw the man. She had been watching
the back of his head idly during the long drive, and had observed
that it was of the round bullet type, with no nape to the neck,
which is common in the Fatherland. Now she could not see his neck
for the coat collar, but she could have sworn that the head was
a different shape. The man seemed to suffer acutely from the cold,
for he buttoned the collar round his chin and pulled his cap far
over his brows.</p>

<p>Ivery came back, followed by a dragging line of men with spades
and lanterns. He flung himself into the front seat and nodded
to the driver to start. The man had his engine going already so
as to lose no time. He bumped over the rough debris of the snowfall
and then fairly let the car hum. Ivery was anxious for speed,
but he did not want his neck broken and he yelled out to take
care. The driver nodded and slowed down, but presently he had
got up speed again.</p>

<p>If Ivery was restless, Mary was worse. She seemed suddenly to
have come on the traces of her friends. In the St Anton valley
the snow had stopped and she let down the window for air, for
she was choking with suspense. The car rushed past the station,
down the hill by Peter’s cottage, through the village, and along
the lake shore to the Pink Chalet.</p>

<p>Ivery halted it at the gate. "See that you fill up with petrol,"
he told the man. "Bid Gustav get the Daimler and be ready to follow
in half in hour."</p>

<p>He spoke to Mary through the open window.</p>

<p>"I will keep you only a very little time. I think you had better
wait in the car, for it will be more comfortable than a dismantled
house. A servant will bring you food and more rugs for the night
journey."</p>

<p>Then he vanished up the dark avenue.</p>

<p>Mary’s first thought was to slip out and get back to the village
and there to find someone who knew me or could take her where
Peter lived. But the driver would prevent her, for he had been
left behind on guard. She looked anxiously at his back, for he
alone stood between her and liberty.</p>

<p>That gentleman seemed to be intent on his own business. As soon
as Ivery’s footsteps had grown faint, he had backed the car into
the entrance, and turned it so that it faced towards St Anton.
Then very slowly it began to move.</p>

<p>At the same moment a whistle was blown shrilly three times. The
door on the right had opened and someone who had been waiting
in the shadows climbed painfully in. Mary saw that it was a little
man and that he was a cripple. She reached a hand to help him,
and he fell on to the cushions beside her. The car was gathering
speed.</p>

<p>Before she realised what was happening the new-comer had taken
her hand and was patting it.</p>

<p>About two minutes later I was entering the gate of the Pink Chalet.</p>
