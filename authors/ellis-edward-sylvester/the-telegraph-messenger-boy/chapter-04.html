<p>At the end of a month Ben Mayberry was made a messenger boy of
the office under my charge. This cannot be called a very momentous
promotion, inasmuch as many of our telegraphists begin there;
but it doubled Ben's wages at once, and led to his appearance
in the attractive blue uniform which the boys of the Western Union
wear. In his case it seemed to add two inches to his stature at
once.</p>

<p>Ben was our best messenger from the first. He was acquainted
with the city of Damietta from one end to the other, and his superior
fleetness of foot enabled him to outstrip the others, while his
cheerful, intelligent manner added to his popularity with our
customers.</p>

<p>As he was so young, I determined to keep him messenger for a
longer time than was really necessary, affording him all the opportunity
he could ask in which to learn telegraphy. He picked it up rapidly,
and I was surprised when I found him reading messages over the
wires by sound. As everyone knows, it takes a skillful operator,
or rather one of experience, to do this, a proof that Ben was
applying himself to learning the business with all the power at
his command.</p>

<p>In more than one instance, those who knew the high estimation
in which the boy was held exerted themselves to put annoyances
and obstructions in his way. All manner of pretexts were made
for detaining him, and he showed no little originality and ingenuity
in outwitting his very attentive friends.</p>

<p>He continued to apply himself evenings, when not on duty at the
office, and his progress was excellent in every respect. The kind
principal showed great interest in him, and at the age of twelve
Ben Mayberry possessed what may be called a good elementary English
education.</p>

<p>Before, however, these two years had passed he could receive
and send messages in a very acceptable manner. His wages had been
advanced, and he now had his mother in comfortable quarters, dressed
tastefully himself, and was developing into a handsome youth,
whose brilliant work had already attracted the notice of the general
superintendent.</p>

<p>Ben had been an operator a little less than a year when he met
with a most extraordinary experience, which to-day is a theme
of never-ending wonder to those who were living in Damietta at
the time.</p>

<p>One evening a rough-bearded man entered the office, and stepping
to the counter, said to me:</p>

<p>"My name is Burkhill &mdash;G. R. Burkhill&mdash;and I am staying
at the hotel in Moorestown. I am expecting a very important dispatch
to-night, but I cannot wait for it. If it reaches this office
before ten o'clock, I wish to have it delivered to the hotel."</p>

<p>Moorestown lay directly across the river, and was reached by
the long, covered bridge which spanned the stream. It was beyond
our "jurisdiction," that is, outside the circle of free delivery,
which Mr. Burkhill understood, as he remarked that he would pay
well for the trouble.</p>

<p>I assured him that I would see that the telegram reached him
that night, if received before ten o'clock. Thanking me, he said
good-evening, passed out, mounted his horse, and galloped away
in the wintry darkness.</p>

<p>It was in the month of February, but the weather was mild for
that season, and there had been a plentiful fall of rain. Ben
was on duty until ten, and he was in the very act of rising from
his seat when he called out:</p>

<p>"Helloa! here comes the message for Mr. Burkhill."</p>

<p>It was quite brief and Ben wrote it out rapidly, took a hasty
impression, thrust it into the damp yellow envelope, and whistled
for a messenger boy. There was only one present, and he was a
pale, delicate lad, who had gone on duty that day after a week's
illness.</p>

<p>"Helloa, Tim; do you want to earn a half dollar extra?" asked
Ben, as the boy stood expectantly before him.</p>

<p>"I would like to, if it isn't too hard for me."</p>

<p>Ben looked sharply at him and saw that the boy was in too weak
a state to undertake the task. There was no other messenger within
call, and Mr. Burkhill was doubtless impatient for the message
whose delivery I had guaranteed.</p>

<p>"It won't do for you to cross the river to-night," said Ben decisively;
"the air is damp and raw, and I think it is going to rain again.
I'll do it for you, and whatever extra I collect from Mr. Burkhill
you shall have, Tim; now go home and go to bed."</p>

<p>And waving me a good-night, Ben hurried out of the door and vanished
down the street.</p>

<p>"It's just like him," I muttered, as I prepared to go home; for
except on special occasions we closed our office at ten, or shortly
after. "That isn't the first kindness he has done that boy, and
everyone in the office is bound by gratitude to him."</p>

<p>As I stepped out on the street I observed that the fine mist
was turning into rain, and another of those dismal nights, which
are often experienced in the Middle States during the latter part
of winter, was upon the city.</p>

<p>I did not feel sleepy after reaching home. My wife and two children
had retired and were sound asleep. There was no one astir but
myself, and drawing my chair to the fire, I began reading the
evening paper.</p>

<p>Fully an hour had passed in this manner and I was in the act
of rising from my chair, with the purpose of going to bed, when
a sharp ring of the bell startled me as though I had heard burglars
in the house. I felt instinctively that something serious had
happened as I hurried to the door.</p>

<p>"Did Ben Mayberry take a telegraphic message across the river
to-night?" asked the man, whom I recognized as a policeman.</p>

<p>"He started to do so," I answered tremblingly. "What's wrong."</p>

<p>"It's the last message he'll ever deliver; he has probably been
killed!"</p>
