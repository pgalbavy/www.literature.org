They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<BR>
     They pursued it with forks and hope;<BR>
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<BR>
     They charmed it with smiles and soap.
<P>
They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,<BR>
     And the Beaver, excited at last,<BR>
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,<BR>
     For the daylight was nearly past.
<P>
"There is Thingumbob shouting!" the Bellman said,<BR>
     "He is shouting like mad, only hark!<BR>
He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,<BR>
     He has certainly found a Snark!"
<P>
They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed<BR>
     "He was always a desperate wag!"<BR>
They beheld him--their Baker--their hero unnamed--<BR>
     On the top of a neighboring crag.
<P>
Erect and sublime, for one moment of time.<BR>
     In the next, that wild figure they saw<BR>
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,<BR>
     While they waited and listened in awe.
<P>
"It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,<BR>
     And seemed almost too good to be true.<BR>
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:<BR>
     Then the ominous words "It's a Boo-"
<P>
Then, silence.  Some fancied they heard in the air<BR>
     A weary and wandering sigh<BR>
Then sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare<BR>
     It was only a breeze that went by.
<P>
They hunted till darkness came on, but they found<BR>
     Not a button, or feather, or mark,<BR>
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground<BR>
     Where the Baker had met with the Snark.
<P>
In the midst of the word he was trying to say,<BR>
     In the midst of his laughter and glee,<BR>
He had softly and suddenly vanished away---<BR>
     For the Snark *was* a Boojum, you see.
