<p> The deep, interminable hoot of the steam-whistle had, in its
grave, vibrating note, something intolerable, which sent a slight
shudder down Mr. Van Wyk’s back. It was the early afternoon; the
Sofala was leaving Batu Beru for Pangu, the next place of call.
She swung in the stream, scantily attended by a few canoes, and,
gliding on the broad river, became lost to view from the Van Wyk
bungalow.</p>

<p>Its owner had not gone this time to see her off. Generally he
came down to the wharf, exchanged a few words with the bridge
while she cast off, and waved his hand to Captain Whalley at the
last moment. This day he did not even go as far as the balustrade
of the veranda. "He couldn’t see me if I did," he said to himself.
"I wonder whether he can make out the house at all." And this
thought somehow made him feel more alone than he had ever felt
for all these years. What was it? six or seven? Seven. A long
time.</p>

<p>He sat on the veranda with a closed book on his knee, and, as
it were, looked out upon his solitude, as if the fact of Captain
Whalley’s blindness had opened his eyes to his own. There were
many sorts of heartaches and troubles, and there was no place
where they could not find a man out. And he felt ashamed, as though
he had for six years behaved like a peevish boy.</p>

<p>His thought followed the Sofala on her way. On the spur of the
moment he had acted impulsively, turning to the thing most pressing.
And what else could he have done? Later on he should see. It seemed
necessary that he should come out into the world, for a time at
least. He had money&mdash;something could be arranged; he would grudge
no time, no trouble, no loss of his solitude. It weighed on him
now&mdash;and Captain Whalley appeared to him as he had sat shading
his eyes, as if, being deceived in the trust of his faith, he
were beyond all the good and evil that can be wrought by the hands
of men.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk’s thoughts followed the Sofala down the river, winding
about through the belt of the coast forest, between the buttressed
shafts of the big trees, through the mangrove strip, and over
the bar. The ship crossed it easily in broad daylight, piloted,
as it happened, by Mr. Sterne, who took the watch from four to
six, and then went below to hug himself with delight at the prospect
of being virtually employed by a rich man&mdash;like Mr. Van Wyk. He
could not see how any hitch could occur now. He did not seem able
to get over the feeling of being "fixed up at last." From six
to eight, in the course of duty, the Serang looked alone after
the ship. She had a clear road before her now till about three
in the morning, when she would close with the Pangu group. At
eight Mr. Sterne came out cheerily to take charge again till midnight.
At ten he was still chirruping and humming to himself on the bridge,
and about that time Mr. Van Wyk’s thought abandoned the Sofala.
Mr. Van Wyk had fallen asleep at last.</p>

<p>Massy, blocking the engine-room companion, jerked himself into
his tweed jacket surlily, while the second waited with a scowl.</p>

<p>"Oh. You came out? You sot! Well, what have you got to say for
yourself?"</p>

<p>He had been in charge of the engines till then. A somber fury
darkened his mind: a hot anger against the ship, against the facts
of life, against the men for their cheating, against himself too&mdash;because
of an inward tremor of his heart.</p>

<p>An incomprehensible growl answered him.</p>

<p>"What? Can’t you open your mouth now? You yelp out your infernal
rot loud enough when you are drunk. What do you mean by abusing
people in that way?&mdash;you old useless boozer, you!"</p>

<p>"Can’t help it. Don’t remember anything about it. You shouldn’t
listen."</p>

<p>"You dare to tell me! What do you mean by going on a drunk like
this!"</p>

<p>"Don’t ask me. Sick of the dam’ boilers&mdash;you would be. Sick of
life."</p>

<p>"I wish you were dead, then. You’ve made me sick of you. Don’t
you remember the uproar you made last night? You miserable old
soaker!"</p>

<p>"No; I don’t. Don’t want to. Drink is drink."</p>

<p>"I wonder what prevents me from kicking you out. What do you
want here?"</p>

<p>"Relieve you. You’ve been long enough down there, George."</p>

<p>"Don’t you George me&mdash;you tippling old rascal, you! If I were
to die to-morrow you would starve. Remember that. Say Mr. Massy."</p>

<p>"Mr. Massy," repeated the other stolidly.</p>

<p>Disheveled, with dull blood-shot eyes, a snuffy, grimy shirt,
greasy trowsers, naked feet thrust into ragged slippers, he bolted
in head down directly Massy had made way for him.</p>

<p>The chief engineer looked around. The deck was empty as far as
the taffrail. All the native passengers had left in Batu Beru
this time, and no others had joined. The dial of the patent log
tinkled periodically in the dark at the end of the ship. It was
a dead calm, and, under the clouded sky, through the still air
that seemed to cling warm, with a seaweed smell, to her slim hull,
on a sea of somber gray and unwrinkled, the ship moved on an even
keel, as if floating detached in empty space. But Mr. Massy slapped
his forehead, tottered a little, caught hold of a belaying-pin
at the foot of the mast.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad," he muttered, walking across the deck unsteadily.
A shovel was scraping loose coal down below&mdash;a fire-door clanged.
Sterne on the bridge began whistling a new tune.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, sitting on the couch, awake and fully dressed,
heard the door of his cabin open. He did not move in the least,
waiting to recognize the voice, with an appalling strain of prudence.</p>

<p>A bulkhead lamp blazed on the white paint, the crimson plush,
the brown varnish of mahogany tops. The white wood packing-case
under the bed-place had remained unopened for three years now,
as though Captain Whalley had felt that, after the Fair Maid was
gone, there could be no abiding-place on earth for his affections.
His hands rested on his knees; his handsome head with big eyebrows
presented a rigid profile to the doorway. The expected voice spoke
out at last.</p>

<p>"Once more, then. What am I to call you?"</p>

<p>Ha! Massy. Again. The weariness of it crushed his heart&mdash;and
the pain of shame was almost more than he could bear without crying
out.</p>

<p>"Well. Is it to be ‘partner’ still?"</p>

<p>"You don’t know what you ask."</p>

<p>"I know what I want . . ."</p>

<p>Massy stepped in and closed the door.</p>

<p>". . . And I am going to have a try for it with you once more."</p>

<p>His whine was half persuasive, half menacing.</p>

<p>"For it’s no manner of use to tell me that you are poor. You
don’t spend anything on yourself, that’s true enough; but there’s
another name for that. You think you are going to have what you
want out of me for three years, and then cast me off without hearing
what I think of you. You think I would have submitted to your
airs if I had known you had only a beggarly five hundred pounds
in the world. You ought to have told me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Captain Whalley, bowing his head. "And yet it
has saved you." . . . Massy laughed scornfully. . . . "I have
told you often enough since."</p>

<p>"And I don’t believe you now. When I think how I let you lord
it over my ship! Do you remember how you used to bullyrag me about
my coat and <em>your</em> bridge? It was in his way. <em>His</em>
bridge! ‘And I won’t be a party to this&mdash;and I couldn’t think
of doing that.’ Honest man! And now it all comes out. ‘I am poor,
and I can’t. I have only this five hundred in the world.’"</p>

<p>He contemplated the immobility of Captain Whalley, that seemed
to present an inconquerable obstacle in his path. His face took
a mournful cast.</p>

<p>"You are a hard man."</p>

<p>"Enough," said Captain Whalley, turning upon him. "You shall
get nothing from me, because I have nothing of mine to give away
now."</p>

<p>"Tell that to the marines!"</p>

<p>Mr. Massy, going out, looked back once; then the door closed,
and Captain Whalley, alone, sat as still as before. He had nothing
of his own&mdash;even his past of honor, of truth, of just pride, was
gone. All his spotless life had fallen into the abyss. He had
said his last good-by to it. But what belonged to <em>her</em>,
that he meant to save. Only a little money. He would take it to
her in his own hands&mdash;this last gift of a man that had lasted
too long. And an immense and fierce impulse, the very passion
of paternity, flamed up with all the unquenched vigor of his worthless
life in a desire to see her face.</p>

<p>Just across the deck Massy had gone straight to his cabin, struck
a light, and hunted up the note of the dreamed number whose figures
had flamed up also with the fierceness of another passion. He
must contrive somehow not to miss a drawing. That number meant
something. But what expedient could he contrive to keep himself
going?</p>

<p>"Wretched miser!" he mumbled.</p>

<p>If Mr. Sterne could at no time have told him anything new about
his partner, he could have told Mr. Sterne that another use could
be made of a man’s affliction than just to kick him out, and thus
defer the term of a difficult payment for a year. To keep the
secret of the affliction and induce him to stay was a better move.
If without means, he would be anxious to remain; and that settled
the question of refunding him his share. He did not know exactly
how much Captain Whalley was disabled; but if it so happened that
he put the ship ashore somewhere for good and all, it was not
the owner’s fault&mdash;was it? He was not obliged to know that there
was anything wrong. But probably nobody would raise such a point,
and the ship was fully insured. He had had enough self-restraint
to pay up the premiums. But this was not all. He could not believe
Captain Whalley to be so confoundedly destitute as not to have
some more money put away somewhere. If he, Massy, could get hold
of it, that would pay for the boilers, and everything went on
as before. And if she got lost in the end, so much the better.
He hated her: he loathed the troubles that took his mind off the
chances of fortune. He wished her at the bottom of the sea, and
the insurance money in his pocket. And as, baffled, he left Captain
Whalley’s cabin, he enveloped in the same hatred the ship with
the worn-out boilers and the man with the dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>And our conduct after all is so much a matter of outside suggestion,
that had it not been for his Jack’s drunken gabble he would have
there and then had it out with this miserable man, who would neither
help, nor stay, nor yet lose the ship. The old fraud! He longed
to kick him out. But he restrained himself. Time enough for that&mdash;when
he liked. There was a fearful new thought put into his head. Wasn’t
he up to it after all? How that beast Jack had raved! "Find a
safe trick to get rid of her." Well, Jack was not so far wrong.
A very clever trick had occurred to him. Aye! But what of the
risk?</p>

<p>A feeling of pride&mdash;the pride of superiority to common prejudices&mdash;crept
into his breast, made his heart beat fast, his mouth turn dry.
Not everybody would dare; but he was Massy, and he was up to it!</p>

<p>Six bells were struck on deck. Eleven! He drank a glass of water,
and sat down for ten minutes or so to calm himself. Then he got
out of his chest a small bull’s-eye lantern of his own and lit
it.</p>

<p>Almost opposite his berth, across the narrow passage under the
bridge, there was, in the iron deck-structure covering the stokehold
fiddle and the boiler-space, a storeroom with iron sides, iron
roof, iron-plated floor, too, on account of the heat below. All
sorts of rubbish was shot there: it had a mound of scrap-iron
in a corner; rows of empty oil-cans; sacks of cotton-waste, with
a heap of charcoal, a deck-forge, fragments of an old hencoop,
winch-covers all in rags, remnants of lamps, and a brown felt
hat, discarded by a man dead now (of a fever on the Brazil coast),
who had been once mate of the Sofala, had remained for years jammed
forcibly behind a length of burst copper pipe, flung at some time
or other out of the engine-room. A complete and imperious blackness
pervaded that Capharnaum of forgotten things. A small shaft of
light from Mr. Massy’s bull’s-eye fell slanting right through
it.</p>

<p>His coat was unbuttoned; he shot the bolt of the door (there
was no other opening), and, squatting before the scrap-heap, began
to pack his pockets with pieces of iron. He packed them carefully,
as if the rusty nuts, the broken bolts, the links of cargo chain,
had been so much gold he had that one chance to carry away. He
packed his side-pockets till they bulged, the breast pocket, the
pockets inside. He turned over the pieces. Some he rejected. A
small mist of powdered rust began to rise about his busy hands.
Mr. Massy knew something of the scientific basis of his clever
trick. If you want to deflect the magnetic needle of a ship’s
compass, soft iron is the best; likewise many small pieces in
the pockets of a jacket would have more effect than a few large
ones, because in that way you obtain a greater amount of surface
for weight in your iron, and it’s surface that tells.</p>

<p>He slipped out swiftly&mdash;two strides sufficed&mdash;and in his cabin
he perceived that his hands were all red&mdash;red with rust. It disconcerted
him, as though he had found them covered with blood: he looked
himself over hastily. Why, his trowsers too! He had been rubbing
his rusty palms on his legs.</p>

<p>He tore off the waistband button in his haste, brushed his coat,
washed his hands. Then the air of guilt left him, and he sat down
to wait.</p>

<p>He sat bolt upright and weighted with iron in his chair. He had
a hard, lumpy bulk against each hip, felt the scrappy iron in
his pockets touch his ribs at every breath, the downward drag
of all these pounds hanging upon his shoulders. He looked very
dull too, sitting idle there, and his yellow face, with motionless
black eyes, had something passive and sad in its quietness.</p>

<p>When he heard eight bells struck above his head, he rose and
made ready to go out. His movements seemed aimless, his lower
lip had dropped a little, his eyes roamed about the cabin, and
the tremendous tension of his will had robbed them of every vestige
of intelligence.</p>

<p>With the last stroke of the bell the Serang appeared noiselessly
on the bridge to relieve the mate. Sterne overflowed with good
nature, since he had nothing more to desire.</p>

<p>"Got your eyes well open yet, Serang? It’s middling dark; I’ll
wait till you get your sight properly."</p>

<p>The old Malay murmured, looked up with his worn eyes, sidled
away into the light of the binnacle, and, crossing his hands behind
his back, fixed his eyes on the compass-card.</p>

<p>"You’ll have to keep a good look-out ahead for land, about half-past
three. It’s fairly clear, though. You have looked in on the captain
as you came along&mdash;eh? He knows the time? Well, then, I am off."</p>

<p>At the foot of the ladder he stood aside for the captain. He
watched him go up with an even, certain tread, and remained thoughtful
for a moment. "It’s funny," he said to himself, "but you can never
tell whether that man has seen you or not. He might have heard
me breathe this time."</p>

<p>He was a wonderful man when all was said and done. They said
he had had a name in his day. Mr. Sterne could well believe it;
and he concluded serenely that Captain Whalley must be able to
see people more or less &mdash;as himself just now, for instance&mdash;but
not being certain of anybody, had to keep up that unnoticing silence
of manner for fear of giving himself away. Mr. Sterne was a shrewd
guesser.</p>

<p>This necessity of every moment brought home to Captain Whalley’s
heart the humiliation of his falsehood. He had drifted into it
from paternal love, from incredulity, from boundless trust in
divine justice meted out to men’s feelings on this earth. He would
give his poor Ivy the benefit of another month’s work; perhaps
the affliction was only temporary. Surely God would not rob his
child of his power to help, and cast him naked into a night without
end. He had caught at every hope; and when the evidence of his
misfortune was stronger than hope, he tried not to believe the
manifest thing.</p>

<p>In vain. In the steadily darkening universe a sinister clearness
fell upon his ideas. In the illuminating moments of suffering
he saw life, men, all things, the whole earth with all her burden
of created nature, as he had never seen them before.</p>

<p>Sometimes he was seized with a sudden vertigo and an overwhelming
terror; and then the image of his daughter appeared. Her, too,
he had never seen so clearly before. Was it possible that he should
ever be unable to do anything whatever for her? Nothing. And not
see her any more? Never.</p>

<p>Why? The punishment was too great for a little presumption, for
a little pride. And at last he came to cling to his deception
with a fierce determination to carry it out to the end, to save
her money intact, and behold her once more with his own eyes.
Afterwards&mdash;what? The idea of suicide was revolting to the vigor
of his manhood. He had prayed for death till the prayers had stuck
in his throat. All the days of his life he had prayed for daily
bread, and not to be led into temptation, in a childlike humility
of spirit. Did words mean anything? Whence did the gift of speech
come? The violent beating of his heart reverberated in his head&mdash;seemed
to shake his brain to pieces.</p>

<p>He sat down heavily in the deck-chair to keep the pretense of
his watch. The night was dark. All the nights were dark now.</p>

<p>"Serang," he said, half aloud.</p>

<p>"Ada, Tuan. I am here."</p>

<p>"There are clouds on the sky?"</p>

<p>"There are, Tuan."</p>

<p>"Let her be steered straight. North."</p>

<p>"She is going north, Tuan."</p>

<p>The Serang stepped back. Captain Whalley recognized Massy’s footfalls
on the bridge.</p>

<p>The engineer walked over to port and returned, passing behind
the chair several times. Captain Whalley detected an unusual character
as of prudent care in this prowling. The near presence of that
man brought with it always a recrudescence of moral suffering
for Captain Whalley. It was not remorse. After all, he had done
nothing but good to the poor devil. There was also a sense of
danger&mdash;the necessity of a greater care.</p>

<p>Massy stopped and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"So you still say you must go?"</p>

<p>"I must indeed."</p>

<p>"And you couldn’t at least leave the money for a term of years?"</p>

<p>"Impossible."</p>

<p>"Can’t trust it with me without your care, eh?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley remained silent. Massy sighed deeply over the
back of the chair.</p>

<p>"It would just do to save me," he said in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"I’ve saved you once."</p>

<p>The chief engineer took off his coat with careful movements,
and proceeded to feel for the brass hook screwed into the wooden
stanchion. For this purpose he placed himself right in front of
the binnacle, thus hiding completely the compass-card from the
quartermaster at the wheel. "Tuan!" the lascar at last murmured
softly, meaning to let the white man know that he could not see
to steer.</p>

<p>Mr. Massy had accomplished his purpose. The coat was hanging
from the nail, within six inches of the binnacle. And directly
he had stepped aside the quartermaster, a middle-aged, pock-marked,
Sumatra Malay, almost as dark as a negro, perceived with amazement
that in that short time, in this smooth water, with no wind at
all, the ship had gone swinging far out of her course. He had
never known her get away like this before. With a slight grunt
of astonishment he turned the wheel hastily to bring her head
back north, which was the course. The grinding of the steering-chains,
the chiding murmurs of the Serang, who had come over to the wheel,
made a slight stir, which attracted Captain Whalley’s anxious
attention. He said, "Take better care." Then everything settled
to the usual quiet on the bridge. Mr. Massy had disappeared.</p>

<p>But the iron in the pockets of the coat had done its work; and
the Sofala, heading north by the compass, made untrue by this
simple device, was no longer making a safe course for Pangu Bay.</p>

<p>The hiss of water parted by her stem, the throb of her engines,
all the sounds of her faithful and laborious life, went on uninterrupted
in the great calm of the sea joining on all sides the motionless
layer of cloud over the sky. A gentle stillness as vast as the
world seemed to wait upon her path, enveloping her lovingly in
a supreme caress. Mr. Massy thought there could be no better night
for an arranged shipwreck.</p>

<p>Run up high and dry on one of the reefs east of Pangu&mdash;wait for
daylight&mdash;hole in the bottom&mdash;out boats &mdash;Pangu Bay same
evening. That’s about it. As soon as she touched he would hasten
on the bridge, get hold of the coat (nobody would notice in the
dark), and shake it upside-down over the side, or even fling it
into the sea. A detail. Who could guess? Coat been seen hanging
there from that hook hundreds of times. Nevertheless, when he
sat down on the lower step of the bridge-ladder his knees knocked
together a little. The waiting part was the worst of it. At times
he would begin to pant quickly, as though he had been running,
and then breathe largely, swelling with the intimate sense of
a mastered fate. Now and then he would hear the shuffle of the
Serang’s bare feet up there: quiet, low voices would exchange
a few words, and lapse almost at once into silence. . . .</p>

<p>"Tell me directly you see any land, Serang."</p>

<p>"Yes, Tuan. Not yet."</p>

<p>"No, not yet," Captain Whalley would agree.</p>

<p>The ship had been the best friend of his decline. He had sent
all the money he had made by and in the Sofala to his daughter.
His thought lingered on the name. How often he and his wife had
talked over the cot of the child in the big stern-cabin of the
Condor; she would grow up, she would marry, she would love them,
they would live near her and look at her happiness&mdash;it would go
on without end. Well, his wife was dead, to the child he had given
all he had to give; he wished he could come near her, see her,
see her face once, live in the sound of her voice, that could
make the darkness of the living grave ready for him supportable.
He had been starved of love too long. He imagined her tenderness.</p>

<p>The Serang had been peering forward, and now and then glancing
at the chair. He fidgeted restlessly, and suddenly burst out close
to Captain Whalley&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tuan, do you see anything of the land?"</p>

<p>The alarmed voice brought Captain Whalley to his feet at once.
He! See! And at the question, the curse of his blindness seemed
to fall on him with a hundredfold force.</p>

<p>"What’s the time?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Half-past three, Tuan."</p>

<p>"We are close. You <em>must</em> see. Look, I say. Look."</p>

<p>Mr. Massy, awakened by the sudden sound of talking from a short
doze on the lowest step, wondered why he was there. Ah! A faintness
came over him. It is one thing to sow the seed of an accident
and another to see the monstrous fruit hanging over your head
ready to fall in the sound of agitated voices.</p>

<p>"There’s no danger," he muttered thickly.</p>

<p>The horror of incertitude had seized upon Captain Whalley, the
miserable mistrust of men, of things&mdash;of the very earth. He had
steered that very course thirty-six times by the same compass&mdash;if
anything was certain in this world it was its absolute, unerring
correctness. Then what had happened? Did the Serang lie? Why lie?
Why? Was he going blind too?</p>

<p>"Is there a mist? Look low on the water. Low down, I say."</p>

<p>"Tuan, there’s no mist. See for yourself."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley steadied the trembling of his limbs by an effort.
Should he stop the engines at once and give himself away. A gust
of irresolution swayed all sorts of bizarre notions in his mind.
The unusual had come, and he was not fit to deal with it. In this
passage of inexpressible anguish he saw her face&mdash;the face of
a young girl&mdash;with an amazing strength of illusion. No, he must
not give himself away after having gone so far for her sake. "You
steered the course? You made it? Speak the truth."</p>

<p>"Ya, Tuan. On the course now. Look."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley strode to the binnacle, which to him made such
a dim spot of light in an infinity of shapeless shadow. By bending
his face right down to the glass he had been able before . . .</p>

<p>Having to stoop so low, he put out, instinctively, his arm to
where he knew there was a stanchion to steady himself against.
His hand closed on something that was not wood but cloth. The
slight pull adding to the weight, the loop broke, and Mr. Massy’s
coat falling, struck the deck heavily with a dull thump, accompanied
by a lot of clicks.</p>

<p>"What’s this?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley fell on his knees, with groping hands extended
in a frank gesture of blindness. They trembled, these hands feeling
for the truth. He saw it. Iron near the compass. Wrong course.
Wreck her! His ship. Oh no. Not that.</p>

<p>"Jump and stop her!" he roared out in a voice not his own.</p>

<p>He ran himself&mdash;hands forward, a blind man, and while the clanging
of the gong echoed still all over the ship, she seemed to butt
full tilt into the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>It was low water along the north side of the strait. Mr. Massy
had not reckoned on that. Instead of running aground for half
her length, the Sofala butted the sheer ridge of a stone reef
which would have been awash at high water. This made the shock
absolutely terrific. Everybody in the ship that was standing was
thrown down headlong: the shaken rigging made a great rattling
to the very trucks. All the lights went out: several chain-guys,
snapping, clattered against the funnel: there were crashes, pings
of parted wire-rope, splintering sounds, loud cracks, the masthead
lamp flew over the bows, and all the doors about the deck began
to bang heavily. Then, after having hit, she rebounded, hit the
second time the very same spot like a battering-ram. This completed
the havoc: the funnel, with all the guys gone, fell over with
a hollow sound of thunder, smashing the wheel to bits, crushing
the frame of the awnings, breaking the lockers, filling the bridge
with a mass of splinters, sticks, and broken wood. Captain Whalley
picked himself up and stood knee-deep in wreckage, torn, bleeding,
knowing the nature of the danger he had escaped mostly by the
sound, and holding Mr. Massy’s coat in his arms.</p>

<p>By this time Sterne (he had been flung out of his bunk) had set
the engines astern. They worked for a few turns, then a voice
bawled out, "Get out of the damned engine-room, Jack!"&mdash;and they
stopped; but the ship had gone clear of the reef and lay still,
with a heavy cloud of steam issuing from the broken deckpipes,
and vanishing in wispy shapes into the night. Notwithstanding
the suddenness of the disaster there was no shouting, as if the
very violence of the shock had half-stunned the shadowy lot of
people swaying here and there about her decks. The voice of the
Serang pronounced distinctly above the confused murmurs&mdash;</p>

<p>"Eight fathom." He had heaved the lead.</p>

<p>Mr. Sterne cried out next in a strained pitch&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where the devil has she got to? Where are we?"</p>

<p>Captain Whalley replied in a calm bass&mdash;</p>

<p>"Amongst the reefs to the eastward."</p>

<p>"You know it, sir? Then she will never get out again."</p>

<p>"She will be sunk in five minutes. Boats, Sterne. Even one will
save you all in this calm."</p>

<p>The Chinaman stokers went in a disorderly rush for the port boats.
Nobody tried to check them. The Malays, after a moment of confusion,
became quiet, and Mr. Sterne showed a good countenance. Captain
Whalley had not moved. His thoughts were darker than this night
in which he had lost his first ship.</p>

<p>"He made me lose a ship."</p>

<p>Another tall figure standing before him amongst the litter of
the smash on the bridge whispered insanely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say nothing of it."</p>

<p>Massy stumbled closer. Captain Whalley heard the chattering of
his teeth.</p>

<p>"I have the coat."</p>

<p>"Throw it down and come along," urged the chattering voice. "B-b-b-b-boat!"</p>

<p>"You will get fifteen years for this."</p>

<p>Mr. Massy had lost his voice. His speech was a mere dry rustling
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Have mercy!"</p>

<p>"Had you any when you made me lose my ship? Mr. Massy, you shall
get fifteen years for this!"</p>

<p>"I wanted money! Money! My own money! I will give you some money.
Take half of it. You love money yourself."</p>

<p>"There’s a justice . . ."</p>

<p>Massy made an awful effort, and in a strange, half choked utterance&mdash;</p>

<p>"You blind devil! It’s you that drove me to it."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, hugging the coat to his breast, made no sound.
The light had ebbed for ever from the world&mdash;let everything go.
But this man should not escape scot-free.</p>

<p>Sterne’s voice commanded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lower away!"</p>

<p>The blocks rattled.</p>

<p>"Now then," he cried, "over with you. This way. You, Jack, here.
Mr. Massy! Mr. Massy! Captain! Quick, sir! Let’s get&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall go to prison for trying to cheat the insurance, but
you’ll get exposed; you, honest man, who has been cheating me.
You are poor. Aren’t you? You’ve nothing but the five hundred
pounds. Well, you have nothing at all now. The ship’s lost, and
the insurance won’t be paid."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley did not move. True! Ivy’s money! Gone in this
wreck. Again he had a flash of insight. He was indeed at the end
of his tether.</p>

<p>Urgent voices cried out together alongside. Massy did not seem
able to tear himself away from the bridge. He chattered and hissed
despairingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Give it up to me! Give it up!"</p>

<p>"No," said Captain Whalley; "I could not give it up. You had
better go. Don’t wait, man, if you want to live. She’s settling
down by the head fast. No; I shall keep it, but I shall stay on
board."</p>

<p>Massy did not seem to understand; but the love of life, awakened
suddenly, drove him away from the bridge.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley laid the coat down, and stumbled amongst the
heaps of wreckage to the side.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Massy in with you?" he called out into the night.</p>

<p>Sterne from the boat shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; we’ve got him. Come along, sir. It’s madness to stay longer."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley felt along the rail carefully, and, without a
word, cast off the painter. They were expecting him still down
there. They were waiting, till a voice suddenly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are adrift! Shove off!"</p>

<p>"Captain Whalley! Leap! . . . pull up a little . . . leap! You
can swim."</p>

<p>In that old heart, in that vigorous body, there was, that nothing
should be wanting, a horror of death that apparently could not
be overcome by the horror of blindness. But after all, for Ivy
he had carried his point, walking in his darkness to the very
verge of a crime. God had not listened to his prayers. The light
had finished ebbing out of the world; not a glimmer. It was a
dark waste; but it was unseemly that a Whalley who had gone so
far to carry a point should continue to live. He must pay the
price.</p>

<p>"Leap as far as you can, sir; we will pick you up."</p>

<p>They did not hear him answer. But their shouting seemed to remind
him of something. He groped his way back, and sought for Mr. Massy’s
coat. He could swim indeed; people sucked down by the whirlpool
of a sinking ship do come up sometimes to the surface, and it
was unseemly that a Whalley, who had made up his mind to die,
should be beguiled by chance into a struggle. He would put all
these pieces of iron into his own pockets.</p>

<p>They, looking from the boat, saw the Sofala, a black mass upon
a black sea, lying still at an appalling cant. No sound came from
her. Then, with a great bizarre shuffling noise, as if the boilers
had broken through the bulkheads, and with a faint muffled detonation,
where the ship had been there appeared for a moment something
standing upright and narrow, like a rock out of the sea. Then
that too disappeared.</p>

<p>When the Sofala failed to come back to Batu Beru at the proper
time, Mr. Van Wyk understood at once that he would never see her
any more. But he did not know what had happened till some months
afterwards, when, in a native craft lent him by his Sultan, he
had made his way to the Sofala’s port of registry, where already
her existence and the official inquiry into her loss was beginning
to be forgotten.</p>

<p>It had not been a very remarkable or interesting case, except
for the fact that the captain had gone down with his sinking ship.
It was the only life lost; and Mr. Van Wyk would not have been
able to learn any details had it not been for Sterne, whom he
met one day on the quay near the bridge over the creek, almost
on the very spot where Captain Whalley, to preserve his daughter’s
five hundred pounds intact, had turned to get a sampan which would
take him on board the Sofala.</p>

<p>From afar Mr. Van Wyk saw Sterne blink straight at him and raise
his hand to his hat. They drew into the shade of a building (it
was a bank), and the mate related how the boat with the crew got
into Pangu Bay about six hours after the accident, and how they
had lived for a fortnight in a state of destitution before they
found an opportunity to get away from that beastly place. The
inquiry had exonerated everybody from all blame. The loss of the
ship was put down to an unusual set of the current. Indeed, it
could not have been anything else: there was no other way to account
for the ship being set seven miles to the eastward of her position
during the middle watch.</p>

<p>"A piece of bad luck for me, sir."</p>

<p>Sterne passed his tongue on his lips, and glanced aside. "I lost
the advantage of being employed by you, sir. I can never be sorry
enough. But here it is: one man’s poison, another man’s meat.
This could not have been handier for Mr. Massy if he had arranged
that shipwreck himself. The most timely total loss I’ve ever heard
of."</p>

<p>"What became of that Massy?" asked Mr. Van Wyk.</p>

<p>"He, sir? Ha! ha! He would keep on telling me that he meant to
buy another ship; but as soon as he had the money in his pocket
he cleared out for Manilla by mail-boat early in the morning.
I gave him chase right aboard, and he told me then he was going
to make his fortune dead sure in Manilla. I could go to the devil
for all he cared. And yet he as good as promised to give me the
command if I didn’t talk too much."</p>

<p>"You never said anything . . ." Mr. Van Wyk began.</p>

<p>"Not I, sir. Why should I? I mean to get on, but the dead aren’t
in my way," said Sterne. His eyelids were beating rapidly, then
drooped for an instant. "Besides, sir, it would have been an awkward
business. You made me hold my tongue just a bit too long."</p>

<p>"Do you know how it was that Captain Whalley remained on board?
Did he really refuse to leave? Come now! Or was it perhaps an
accidental . . .?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" Sterne interrupted with energy. "I tell you I yelled
for him to leap overboard. He simply <em>must</em> have cast off
the painter of the boat himself. We all yelled to him&mdash;that is,
Jack and I. He wouldn’t even answer us. The ship was as silent
as a grave to the last. Then the boilers fetched away, and down
she went. Accident! Not it! The game was up, sir, I tell you."</p>

<p>This was all that Sterne had to say.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk had been of course made the guest of the club for
a fortnight, and it was there that he met the lawyer in whose
office had been signed the agreement between Massy and Captain
Whalley.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary old man," he said. "He came into my office from
nowhere in particular as you may say, with his five hundred pounds
to place, and that engineer fellow following him anxiously. And
now he is gone out a little inexplicably, just as he came. I could
never understand him quite. There was no mystery at all about
that Massy, eh? I wonder whether Whalley refused to leave the
ship. It would have been foolish. He was blameless, as the court
found."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk had known him well, he said, and he could not believe
in suicide. Such an act would not have been in character with
what he knew of the man.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion, too," the lawyer agreed. The general theory
was that the captain had remained too long on board trying to
save something of importance. Perhaps the chart which would clear
him, or else something of value in his cabin. The painter of the
boat had come adrift of itself it was supposed. However, strange
to say, some little time before that voyage poor Whalley had called
in his office and had left with him a sealed envelope addressed
to his daughter, to be forwarded to her in case of his death.
Still it was nothing very unusual, especially in a man of his
age. Mr. Van Wyk shook his head. Captain Whalley looked good for
a hundred years.</p>

<p>"Perfectly true," assented the lawyer. "The old fellow looked
as though he had come into the world full-grown and with that
long beard. I could never, somehow, imagine him either younger
or older&mdash;don’t you know. There was a sense of physical power
about that man too. And perhaps that was the secret of that something
peculiar in his person which struck everybody who came in contact
with him. He looked indestructible by any ordinary means that
put an end to the rest of us. His deliberate, stately courtesy
of manner was full of significance. It was as though he were certain
of having plenty of time for everything. Yes, there was something
indestructible about him; and the way he talked sometimes you
might have thought he believed it himself. When he called on me
last with that letter he wanted me to take charge of, he was not
depressed at all. Perhaps a shade more deliberate in his talk
and manner. Not depressed in the least. Had he a presentiment,
I wonder? Perhaps! Still it seems a miserable end for such a striking
figure."</p>

<p>"Oh yes! It was a miserable end," Mr. Van Wyk said, with so much
fervor that the lawyer looked up at him curiously; and afterwards,
after parting with him, he remarked to an acquaintance&mdash;</p>

<p>"Queer person that Dutch tobacco-planter from Batu Beru. Know
anything of him?"</p>

<p>"Heaps of money," answered the bank manager. "I hear he’s going
home by the next mail to form a company to take over his estates.
Another tobacco district thrown open. He’s wise, I think. These
good times won’t last for ever."</p>

<p>In the southern hemisphere Captain Whalley’s daughter had no
presentiment of evil when she opened the envelope addressed to
her in the lawyer’s handwriting. She had received it in the afternoon;
all the boarders had gone out, her boys were at school, her husband
sat upstairs in his big arm-chair with a book, thin-faced, wrapped
up in rugs to the waist. The house was still, and the grayness
of a cloudy day lay against the panes of three lofty windows.</p>

<p>In a shabby dining-room, where a faint cold smell of dishes lingered
all the year round, sitting at the end of a long table surrounded
by many chairs pushed in with their backs close against the edge
of the perpetually laid table-cloth, she read the opening sentence:
"Most profound regret&mdash;painful duty&mdash;your father is no more&mdash;in
accordance with his instructions&mdash;fatal casualty&mdash;consolation&mdash;no
blame attached to his memory. . . ."</p>

<p>Her face was thin, her temples a little sunk under the smooth
bands of black hair, her lips remained resolutely compressed,
while her dark eyes grew larger, till at last, with a low cry,
she stood up, and instantly stooped to pick up another envelope
which had slipped off her knees on to the floor.</p>

<p>She tore it open, snatched out the inclosure. . . .</p>

<p>"My dearest child," it said, "I am writing this while I am able
yet to write legibly. I am trying hard to save for you all the
money that is left; I have only kept it to serve you better. It
is yours. It shall not be lost: it shall not be touched. There’s
five hundred pounds. Of what I have earned I have kept nothing
back till now. For the future, if I live, I must keep back some&mdash;a
little&mdash;to bring me to you. I must come to you. I must see you
once more.</p>

<p>"It is hard to believe that you will ever look on these lines.
God seems to have forgotten me. I want to see you&mdash;and yet death
would be a greater favor. If you ever read these words, I charge
you to begin by thanking a God merciful at last, for I shall be
dead then, and it will be well. My dear, I am at the end of my
tether."</p>

<p>The next paragraph began with the words: "My sight is going .
. ."</p>

<p>She read no more that day. The hand holding up the paper to her
eyes fell slowly, and her slender figure in a plain black dress
walked rigidly to the window. Her eyes were dry: no cry of sorrow
or whisper of thanks went up to heaven from her lips. Life had
been too hard, for all the efforts of his love. It had silenced
her emotions. But for the first time in all these years its sting
had departed, the carking care of poverty, the meanness of a hard
struggle for bread. Even the image of her husband and of her children
seemed to glide away from her into the gray twilight; it was her
father’s face alone that she saw, as though he had come to see
her, always quiet and big, as she had seen him last, but with
something more august and tender in his aspect.</p>

<p>She slipped his folded letter between the two buttons of her
plain black bodice, and leaning her forehead against a window-pane
remained there till dusk, perfectly motionless, giving him all
the time she could spare. Gone! Was it possible? My God, was it
possible! The blow had come softened by the spaces of the earth,
by the years of absence. There had been whole days when she had
not thought of him at all&mdash;had no time. But she had loved him,
she felt she had loved him, after all.</p>
