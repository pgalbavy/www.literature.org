<p>As soon as Abdulla and his companions had left the enclosure,
Aissa approached Willems and stood by his side. He took no notice
of her expectant attitude till she touched him gently, when he
turned furiously upon her and, tearing off her face-veil, trampled
upon it as though it had been a mortal enemy. She looked at him
with the faint smile of patient curiosity, with the puzzled interest
of ignorance watching the running of a complicated piece of machinery.
After he had exhausted his rage, he stood again severe and unbending
looking down at the fire, but the touch of her fingers at the
nape of his neck effaced instantly the hard lines round his mouth;
his eyes wavered uneasily; his lips trembled slightly. Starting
with the unresisting rapidity of a particle of iron&mdash;which, quiescent
one moment, leaps in the next to a powerful magnet&mdash;he moved forward,
caught her in his arms and pressed her violently to his breast.
He released her as suddenly, and she stumbled a little, stepped
back, breathed quickly through her parted lips, and said in a
tone of pleased reproof&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Fool-man! And if you had killed me in your strong arms what
would you have done?"</p>

<p>"You want to live . . . and to run away from me again," he said
gently. "Tell me&mdash;do you?"</p>

<p>She moved towards him with very short steps, her head a little
on one side, hands on hips, with a slight balancing of her body:
an approach more tantalizing than an escape. He looked on, eager&mdash;charmed.
She spoke jestingly.</p>

<p>"What am I to say to a man who has been away three days from
me? Three!"  she repeated, holding up playfully three fingers
before Willems’ eyes. He snatched at the hand, but she was on
her guard and whisked it behind her back.</p>

<p>"No!" she said. "I cannot be caught. But I will come. I am coming
myself because I like. Do not move. Do not touch me with your
mighty hands, O child!"</p>

<p>As she spoke she made a step nearer, then another. Willems did
not stir. Pressing against him she stood on tiptoe to look into
his eyes, and her own seemed to grow bigger, glistening and tender,
appealing and promising. With that look she drew the man’s soul
away from him through his immobile pupils, and from Willems’ features
the spark of reason vanished under her gaze and was replaced by
an appearance of physical well-being, an ecstasy of the senses
which had taken possession of his rigid body; an ecstasy that
drove out regrets, hesitation and doubt, and proclaimed its terrible
work by an appalling aspect of idiotic beatitude. He never stirred
a limb, hardly breathed, but stood in stiff immobility, absorbing
the delight of her close contact by every pore.</p>

<p>"Closer! Closer!" he murmured.</p>

<p>Slowly she raised her arms, put them over his shoulders, and
clasping her hands at the back of his neck, swung off the full
length of her arms. Her head fell back, the eyelids dropped slightly,
and her thick hair hung straight down: a mass of ebony touched
by the red gleams of the fire. He stood unyielding under the strain,
as solid and motionless as one of the big trees of the surrounding
forests; and his eyes looked at the modelling of her chin, at
the outline of her neck, at the swelling lines of her bosom, with
the famished and concentrated expression of a starving man looking
at food. She drew herself up to him and rubbed her head against
his cheek slowly and gently. He sighed. She, with her hands still
on his shoulders, glanced up at the placid stars and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The night is half gone. We shall finish it by this fire. By
this fire you shall tell me all: your words and Syed Abdulla’s
words; and listening to you I shall forget the three days&mdash;because
I am good. Tell me&mdash;am I good?"</p>

<p>He said "Yes" dreamily, and she ran off towards the big house.</p>

<p>When she came back, balancing a roll of fine mats on her head,
he had replenished the fire and was ready to help her in arranging
a couch on the side of it nearest to the hut. She sank down with
a quick but gracefully controlled movement, and he threw himself
full length with impatient haste, as if he wished to forestall
somebody. She took his head on her knees, and when he felt her
hands touching his face, her fingers playing with his hair, he
had an expression of being taken possession of; he experienced
a sense of peace, of rest, of happiness, and of soothing delight.
His hands strayed upwards about her neck, and he drew her down
so as to have her face above his. Then he whispered&mdash;"I wish I
could die like this&mdash;now!" She looked at him with her big sombre
eyes, in which there was no responsive light. His thought was
so remote from her understanding that she let the words pass by
unnoticed, like the breath of the wind, like the flight of a cloud.
Woman though she was, she could not comprehend, in her simplicity,
the tremendous compliment of that speech, that whisper of deadly
happiness, so sincere, so spontaneous, coming so straight from
the heart&mdash;like every corruption. It was the voice of madness,
of a delirious peace, of happiness that is infamous, cowardly,
and so exquisite that the debased mind refuses to contemplate
its termination: for to the victims of such happiness the moment
of its ceasing is the beginning afresh of that torture which is
its price.</p>

<p>With her brows slightly knitted in the determined preoccupation
of her own desires, she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now tell me all. All the words spoken between you and Syed Abdulla."</p>

<p>Tell what? What words? Her voice recalled back the consciousness
that had departed under her touch, and he became aware of the
passing minutes every one of which was like a reproach; of those
minutes that falling, slow, reluctant, irresistible into the past,
marked his footsteps on the way to perdition. Not that he had
any conviction about it, any notion of the possible ending on
that painful road. It was an indistinct feeling, a threat of suffering
like the confused warning of coming disease, an inarticulate monition
of evil made up of fear and pleasure, of resignation and of revolt.
He was ashamed of his state of mind. After all, what was he afraid
of? Were those scruples? Why that hesitation to think, to speak
of what he intended doing? Scruples were for imbeciles. His clear
duty was to make himself happy. Did he ever take an oath of fidelity
to Lingard? No. Well then&mdash;he would not let any interest of that
old fool stand between Willems and Willems’ happiness. Happiness?
Was he not, perchance, on a false track? Happiness meant money.
Much money. At least he had always thought so till he had experienced
those new sensations which . . .</p>

<p>Aissa’s question, repeated impatiently, interrupted his musings,
and looking up at her face shining above him in the dim light
of the fire he stretched his limbs luxuriously and obedient to
her desire, he spoke slowly and hardly above his breath. She,
with her head close to his lips, listened absorbed, interested,
in attentive immobility. The many noises of the great courtyard
were hushed up gradually by the sleep that stilled all voices
and closed all eyes. Then somebody droned out a song with a nasal
drawl at the end of every verse. He stirred. She put her hand
suddenly on his lips and sat upright. There was a feeble coughing,
a rustle of leaves, and then a complete silence took possession
of the land; a silence cold, mournful, profound; more like death
than peace; more hard to bear than the fiercest tumult. As soon
as she removed her hand he hastened to speak, so insupportable
to him was that stillness perfect and absolute in which his thoughts
seemed to ring with the loudness of shouts.</p>

<p>"Who was there making that noise?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do not know. He is gone now," she answered, hastily. "Tell
me, you will not return to your people; not without me. Not with
me. Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"I have promised already. I have no people of my own. Have I
not told you, that you are everybody to me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said, slowly, "but I like to hear you say that
again&mdash;every day, and every night, whenever I ask; and never to
be angry because I ask. I am afraid of white women who are shameless
and have fierce eyes." She scanned his features close for a moment
and added:</p>

<p>"Are they very beautiful? They must be."</p>

<p>"I do not know," he whispered, thoughtfully. "And if I ever did
know, looking at you I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Forgotten! And for three days and two nights you have forgotten
me also! Why? Why were you angry with me when I spoke at first
of Tuan Abdulla, in the days when we lived beside the brook? You
remembered somebody then. Somebody in the land whence you come.
Your tongue is false. You are white indeed, and your heart is
full of deception. I know it. And yet I cannot help believing
you when you talk of your love for me. But I am afraid!"</p>

<p>He felt flattered and annoyed by her vehemence, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I am with you now. I did come back. And it was you that
went away."</p>

<p>"When you have helped Abdulla against the Rajah Laut, who is
the first of white men, I shall not be afraid any more," she whispered.</p>

<p>"You must believe what I say when I tell you that there never
was another woman; that there is nothing for me to regret, and
nothing but my enemies to remember."</p>

<p>"Where do you come from?" she said, impulsive and inconsequent,
in a passionate whisper. "What is that land beyond the great sea
from which you come? A land of lies and of evil from which nothing
but misfortune ever comes to us&mdash;who are not white. Did you not
at first ask me to go there with you? That is why I went away."</p>

<p>"I shall never ask you again."</p>

<p>"And there is no woman waiting for you there?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Willems, firmly.</p>

<p>She bent over him. Her lips hovered above his face and her long
hair brushed his cheeks.</p>

<p>"You taught me the love of your people which is of the Devil,"
she murmured, and bending still lower, she said faintly, "Like
this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, like this!" he answered very low, in a voice that trembled
slightly with eagerness; and she pressed suddenly her lips to
his while he closed his eyes in an ecstasy of delight.</p>

<p>There was a long interval of silence. She stroked his head with
gentle touches, and he lay dreamily, perfectly happy but for the
annoyance of an indistinct vision of a well-known figure; a man
going away from him and diminishing in a long perspective of fantastic
trees, whose every leaf was an eye looking after that man, who
walked away growing smaller, but never getting out of sight for
all his steady progress. He felt a desire to see him vanish, a
hurried impatience of his disappearance, and he watched for it
with a careful and irksome effort. There was something familiar
about that figure. Why! Himself! He gave a sudden start and opened
his eyes, quivering with the emotion of that quick return from
so far, of finding himself back by the fire with the rapidity
of a flash of lightning. It had been half a dream; he had slumbered
in her arms for a few seconds. Only the beginning of a dream&mdash;nothing
more. But it was some time before he recovered from the shock
of seeing himself go away so deliberately, so definitely, so unguardedly;
and going away&mdash;where? Now, if he had not woke up in time he would
never have come back again from there; from whatever place he
was going to. He felt indignant. It was like an evasion, like
a prisoner breaking his parole&mdash;that thing slinking off stealthily
while he slept. He was very indignant, and was also astonished
at the absurdity of his own emotions.</p>

<p>She felt him tremble, and murmuring tender words, pressed his
head to her breast. Again he felt very peaceful with a peace that
was as complete as the silence round them. He muttered&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are tired, Aissa."</p>

<p>She answered so low that it was like a sigh shaped into faint
words.</p>

<p>"I shall watch your sleep, O child!"</p>

<p>He lay very quiet, and listened to the beating of her heart.
That sound, light, rapid, persistent, and steady; her very life
beating against his cheek, gave him a clear perception of secure
ownership, strengthened his belief in his possession of that human
being, was like an assurance of the vague felicity of the future.
There were no regrets, no doubts, no hesitation now. Had there
ever been? All that seemed far away, ages ago&mdash;as unreal and pale
as the fading memory of some delirium. All the anguish, suffering,
strife of the past days; the humiliation and anger of his downfall;
all that was an infamous nightmare, a thing born in sleep to be
forgotten and leave no trace&mdash;and true life was this: this dreamy
immobility with his head against her heart that beat so steadily.</p>

<p>He was broad awake now, with that tingling wakefulness of the
tired body which succeeds to the few refreshing seconds of irresistible
sleep, and his wide-open eyes looked absently at the doorway of
Omar’s hut. The reed walls glistened in the light of the fire,
the smoke of which, thin and blue, drifted slanting in a succession
of rings and spirals across the doorway, whose empty blackness
seemed to him impenetrable and enigmatical like a curtain hiding
vast spaces full of unexpected surprises. This was only his fancy,
but it was absorbing enough to make him accept the sudden appearance
of a head, coming out of the gloom, as part of his idle fantasy
or as the beginning of another short dream, of another vagary
of his overtired brain. A face with drooping eyelids, old, thin,
and yellow, above the scattered white of a long beard that touched
the earth. A head without a body, only a foot above the ground,
turning slightly from side to side on the edge of the circle of
light as if to catch the radiating heat of the fire on either
cheek in succession. He watched it in passive amazement, growing
distinct, as if coming nearer to him, and the confused outlines
of a body crawling on all fours came out, creeping inch by inch
towards the fire, with a silent and all but imperceptible movement.
He was astounded at the appearance of that blind head dragging
that crippled body behind, without a sound, without a change in
the composure of the sightless face, which was plain one second,
blurred the next in the play of the light that drew it to itself
steadily. A mute face with a kriss between its lips. This was
no dream. Omar’s face. But why? What was he after?</p>

<p>He was too indolent in the happy languor of the moment to answer
the question. It darted through his brain and passed out, leaving
him free to listen again to the beating of her heart; to that
precious and delicate sound which filled the quiet immensity of
the night. Glancing upwards he saw the motionless head of the
woman looking down at him in a tender gleam of liquid white between
the long eyelashes, whose shadow rested on the soft curve of her
cheek; and under the caress of that look, the uneasy wonder and
the obscure fear of that apparition, crouching and creeping in
turns towards the fire that was its guide, were lost&mdash;were drowned
in the quietude of all his senses, as pain is drowned in the flood
of drowsy serenity that follows upon a dose of opium.</p>

<p>He altered the position of his head by ever so little, and now
could see easily that apparition which he had seen a minute before
and had nearly forgotten already. It had moved closer, gliding
and noiseless like the shadow of some nightmare, and now it was
there, very near, motionless and still as if listening; one hand
and one knee advanced; the neck stretched out and the head turned
full towards the fire. He could see the emaciated face, the skin
shiny over the prominent bones, the black shadows of the hollow
temples and sunken cheeks, and the two patches of blackness over
the eyes, over those eyes that were dead and could not see. What
was the impulse which drove out this blind cripple into the night
to creep and crawl towards that fire? He looked at him, fascinated,
but the face, with its shifting lights and shadows, let out nothing,
closed and impenetrable like a walled door.</p>

<p>Omar raised himself to a kneeling posture and sank on his heels,
with his hands hanging down before him. Willems, looking out of
his dreamy numbness, could see plainly the kriss between the thin
lips, a bar across the face; the handle on one side where the
polished wood caught a red gleam from the fire and the thin line
of the blade running to a dull black point on the other. He felt
an inward shock, which left his body passive in Aissa’s embrace,
but filled his breast with a tumult of powerless fear; and he
perceived suddenly that it was his own death that was groping
towards him; that it was the hate of himself and the hate of her
love for him which drove this helpless wreck of a once brilliant
and resolute pirate, to attempt a desperate deed that would be
the glorious and supreme consolation of an unhappy old age. And
while he looked, paralyzed with dread, at the father who had resumed
his cautious advance&mdash;blind like fate, persistent like destiny&mdash;he
listened with greedy eagerness to the heart of the daughter beating
light, rapid, and steady against his head.</p>

<p>He was in the grip of horrible fear; of a fear whose cold hand
robs its victim of all will and of all power; of all wish to escape,
to resist, or to move; which destroys hope and despair alike,
and holds the empty and useless carcass as if in a vise under
the coming stroke. It was not the fear of death&mdash;he had faced
danger before&mdash;it was not even the fear of that particular form
of death. It was not the fear of the end, for he knew that the
end would not come then. A movement, a leap, a shout would save
him from the feeble hand of the blind old man, from that hand
that even now was, with cautious sweeps along the ground, feeling
for his body in the darkness. It was the unreasoning fear of this
glimpse into the unknown things, into those motives, impulses,
desires he had ignored, but that had lived in the breasts of despised
men, close by his side, and were revealed to him for a second,
to be hidden again behind the black mists of doubt and deception.
It was not death that frightened him: it was the horror of bewildered
life where he could understand nothing and nobody round him; where
he could guide, control, comprehend nothing and no one&mdash;not even
himself.</p>

<p>He felt a touch on his side. That contact, lighter than the caress
of a mother’s hand on the cheek of a sleeping child, had for him
the force of a crushing blow. Omar had crept close, and now, kneeling
above him, held the kriss in one hand while the other skimmed
over his jacket up towards his breast in gentle touches; but the
blind face, still turned to the heat of the fire, was set and
immovable in its aspect of stony indifference to things it could
not hope to see. With an effort Willems took his eyes off the
deathlike mask and turned them up to Aissa’s head. She sat motionless
as if she had been part of the sleeping earth, then suddenly he
saw her big sombre eyes open out wide in a piercing stare and
felt the convulsive pressure of her hands pinning his arms along
his body. A second dragged itself out, slow and bitter, like a
day of mourning; a second full of regret and grief for that faith
in her which took its flight from the shattered ruins of his trust.
She was holding him! She too! He felt her heart give a great leap,
his head slipped down on her knees, he closed his eyes and there
was nothing. Nothing! It was as if she had died; as though her
heart had leaped out into the night, abandoning him, defenceless
and alone, in an empty world.</p>

<p>His head struck the ground heavily as she flung him aside in
her sudden rush. He lay as if stunned, face up and, daring not
move, did not see the struggle, but heard the piercing shriek
of mad fear, her low angry words; another shriek dying out in
a moan. When he got up at last he looked at Aissa kneeling over
her father, he saw her bent back in the effort of holding him
down, Omar’s contorted limbs, a hand thrown up above her head
and her quick movement grasping the wrist. He made an impulsive
step forward, but she turned a wild face to him and called out
over her shoulder&mdash;</p>

<p>"Keep back! Do not come near! Do not. . . ."</p>

<p>And he stopped short, his arms hanging lifelessly by his side,
as if those words had changed him into stone. She was afraid of
his possible violence, but in the unsettling of all his convictions
he was struck with the frightful thought that she preferred to
kill her father all by herself; and the last stage of their struggle,
at which he looked as though a red fog had filled his eyes, loomed
up with an unnatural ferocity, with a sinister meaning; like something
monstrous and depraved, forcing its complicity upon him under
the cover of that awful night. He was horrified and grateful;
drawn irresistibly to her&mdash;and ready to run away. He could not
move at first&mdash;then he did not want to stir. He wanted to see
what would happen. He saw her lift, with a tremendous effort,
the apparently lifeless body into the hut, and remained standing,
after they disappeared, with the vivid image in his eyes of that
head swaying on her shoulder, the lower jaw hanging down, collapsed,
passive, meaningless, like the head of a corpse.</p>

<p>Then after a while he heard her voice speaking inside, harshly,
with an agitated abruptness of tone; and in answer there were
groans and broken murmurs of exhaustion. She spoke louder. He
heard her saying violently&mdash;"No! No! Never!"</p>

<p>And again a plaintive murmur of entreaty as of some one begging
for a supreme favour, with a last breath. Then she said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Never! I would sooner strike it into my own heart."</p>

<p>She came out, stood panting for a short moment in the doorway,
and then stepped into the firelight. Behind her, through the darkness
came the sound of words calling the vengeance of heaven on her
head, rising higher, shrill, strained, repeating the curse over
and over again&mdash;till the voice cracked in a passionate shriek
that died out into hoarse muttering ending with a deep and prolonged
sigh. She stood facing Willems, one hand behind her back, the
other raised in a gesture compelling attention, and she listened
in that attitude till all was still inside the hut. Then she made
another step forward and her hand dropped slowly.</p>

<p>"Nothing but misfortune," she whispered, absently, to herself.
"Nothing but misfortune to us who are not white." The anger and
excitement died out of her face, and she looked straight at Willems
with an intense and mournful gaze.</p>

<p>He recovered his senses and his power of speech with a sudden
start.</p>

<p>"Aissa," he exclaimed, and the words broke out through his lips
with hurried nervousness. "Aissa! How can I live here? Trust me.
Believe in me. Let us go away from here. Go very far away! Very
far; you and I!"</p>

<p>He did not stop to ask himself whether he could escape, and how,
and where. He was carried away by the flood of hate, disgust,
and contempt of a white man for that blood which is not his blood,
for that race which is not his race; for the brown skins; for
the hearts false like the sea, blacker than night. This feeling
of repulsion overmastered his reason in a clear conviction of
the impossibility for him to live with her people. He urged her
passionately to fly with him because out of all that abhorred
crowd he wanted this one woman, but wanted her away from them,
away from that race of slaves and cut-throats from which she sprang.
He wanted her for himself&mdash;far from everybody, in some safe and
dumb solitude. And as he spoke his anger and contempt rose, his
hate became almost fear; and his desire of her grew immense, burning,
illogical and merciless; crying to him through all his senses;
louder than his hate, stronger than his fear, deeper than his
contempt&mdash;irresistible and certain like death itself.</p>

<p>Standing at a little distance, just within the light&mdash;but on
the threshold of that darkness from which she had come&mdash;she listened,
one hand still behind her back, the other arm stretched out with
the hand half open as if to catch the fleeting words that rang
around her, passionate, menacing, imploring, but all tinged with
the anguish of his suffering, all hurried by the impatience that
gnawed his breast. And while she listened she felt a slowing down
of her heart-beats as the meaning of his appeal grew clearer before
her indignant eyes, as she saw with rage and pain the edifice
of her love, her own work, crumble slowly to pieces, destroyed
by that man’s fears, by that man’s falseness. Her memory recalled
the days by the brook when she had listened to other words&mdash;to
other thoughts&mdash;to promises and to pleadings for other things,
which came from that man’s lips at the bidding of her look or
her smile, at the nod of her head, at the whisper of her lips.
Was there then in his heart something else than her image, other
desires than the desires of her love, other fears than the fear
of losing her? How could that be? Had she grown ugly or old in
a moment? She was appalled, surprised and angry with the anger
of unexpected humiliation; and her eyes looked fixedly, sombre
and steady, at that man born in the land of violence and of evil
wherefrom nothing but misfortune comes to those who are not white.
Instead of thinking of her caresses, instead of forgetting all
the world in her embrace, he was thinking yet of his people; of
that people that steals every land, masters every sea, that knows
no mercy and no truth&mdash;knows nothing but its own strength. O man
of strong arm and of false heart! Go with him to a far country,
be lost in the throng of cold eyes and false hearts&mdash;lose him
there! Never! He was mad&mdash;mad with fear; but he should not escape
her! She would keep him here a slave and a master; here where
he was alone with her; where he must live for her&mdash;or die. She
had a right to his love which was of her making, to the love that
was in him now, while he spoke those words without sense. She
must put between him and other white men a barrier of hate. He
must not only stay, but he must also keep his promise to Abdulla,
the fulfilment of which would make her safe.</p>

<p>"Aissa, let us go! With you by my side I would attack them with
my naked hands. Or no! Tomorrow we shall be outside, on board
Abdulla’s ship. You shall come with me and then I could . . .
If the ship went ashore by some chance, then we could steal a
canoe and escape in the confusion. . . . You are not afraid of
the sea . . . of the sea that would give me freedom . . ."</p>

<p>He was approaching her gradually with extended arms, while he
pleaded ardently in incoherent words that ran over and tripped
each other in the extreme eagerness of his speech. She stepped
back, keeping her distance, her eyes on his face, watching on
it the play of his doubts and of his hopes with a piercing gaze,
that seemed to search out the innermost recesses of his thought;
and it was as if she had drawn slowly the darkness round her,
wrapping herself in its undulating folds that made her indistinct
and vague. He followed her step by step till at last they both
stopped, facing each other under the big tree of the enclosure.
The solitary exile of the forests, great, motionless and solemn
in his abandonment, left alone by the life of ages that had been
pushed away from him by those pigmies that crept at his foot,
towered high and straight above their heads. He seemed to look
on, dispassionate and imposing, in his lonely greatness, spreading
his branches wide in a gesture of lofty protection, as if to hide
them in the sombre shelter of innumerable leaves; as if moved
by the disdainful compassion of the strong, by the scornful pity
of an aged giant, to screen this struggle of two human hearts
from the cold scrutiny of glittering stars.</p>

<p>The last cry of his appeal to her mercy rose loud, vibrated under
the sombre canopy, darted among the boughs startling the white
birds that slept wing to wing&mdash;and died without an echo, strangled
in the dense mass of unstirring leaves. He could not see her face,
but he heard her sighs and the distracted murmur of indistinct
words. Then, as he listened holding his breath, she exclaimed
suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Have you heard him? He has cursed me because I love you. You
brought me suffering and strife&mdash;and his curse. And now you want
to take me far away where I would lose you, lose my life; because
your love is my life now. What else is there? Do not move," she
cried violently, as he stirred a little&mdash;"do not speak! Take this!
Sleep in peace!"</p>

<p>He saw a shadowy movement of her arm. Something whizzed past
and struck the ground behind him, close to the fire. Instinctively
he turned round to look at it. A kriss without its sheath lay
by the embers; a sinuous dark object, looking like something that
had been alive and was now crushed, dead and very inoffensive;
a black wavy outline very distinct and still in the dull red glow.
Without thinking he moved to pick it up, stooping with the sad
and humble movement of a beggar gathering the alms flung into
the dust of the roadside. Was this the answer to his pleading,
to the hot and living words that came from his heart? Was this
the answer thrown at him like an insult, that thing made of wood
and iron, insignificant and venomous, fragile and deadly? He held
it by the blade and looked at the handle stupidly for a moment
before he let it fall again at his feet; and when he turned round
he faced only the night:&mdash;the night immense, profound and quiet;
a sea of darkness in which she had disappeared without leaving
a trace.</p>

<p>He moved forward with uncertain steps, putting out both his hands
before him with the anguish of a man blinded suddenly.</p>

<p>"Aissa!" he cried&mdash;"come to me at once."</p>

<p>He peered and listened, but saw nothing, heard nothing. After
a while the solid blackness seemed to wave before his eyes like
a curtain disclosing movements but hiding forms, and he heard
light and hurried footsteps, then the short clatter of the gate
leading to Lakamba’s private enclosure. He sprang forward and
brought up against the rough timber in time to hear the words,
"Quick! Quick!" and the sound of the wooden bar dropped on the
other side, securing the gate. With his arms thrown up, the palms
against the paling, he slid down in a heap on the ground.</p>

<p>"Aissa," he said, pleadingly, pressing his lips to a chink between
the stakes. "Aissa, do you hear me? Come back! I will do what
you want, give you all you desire&mdash;if I have to set the whole
Sambir on fire and put that fire out with blood. Only come back.
Now! At once! Are you there? Do you hear me? Aissa!"</p>

<p>On the other side there were startled whispers of feminine voices;
a frightened little laugh suddenly interrupted; some woman’s admiring
murmur&mdash;"This is brave talk!" Then after a short silence Aissa
cried&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sleep in peace&mdash;for the time of your going is near. Now I am
afraid of you. Afraid of your fear. When you return with Tuan
Abdulla you shall be great. You will find me here. And there will
be nothing but love. Nothing else!&mdash;Always! &mdash;Till we die!"</p>

<p>He listened to the shuffle of footsteps going away, and staggered
to his feet, mute with the excess of his passionate anger against
that being so savage and so charming; loathing her, himself, everybody
he had ever known; the earth, the sky, the very air he drew into
his oppressed chest; loathing it because it made him live, loathing
her because she made him suffer. But he could not leave that gate
through which she had passed. He wandered a little way off, then
swerved round, came back and fell down again by the stockade only
to rise suddenly in another attempt to break away from the spell
that held him, that brought him back there, dumb, obedient and
furious. And under the immobilized gesture of lofty protection
in the branches outspread wide above his head, under the high
branches where white birds slept wing to wing in the shelter of
countless leaves, he tossed like a grain of dust in a whirlwind&mdash;sinking
and rising&mdash;round and round&mdash;always near that gate. All through
the languid stillness of that night he fought with the impalpable;
he fought with the shadows, with the darkness, with the silence.
He fought without a sound, striking futile blows, dashing from
side to side; obstinate, hopeless, and always beaten back; like
a man bewitched within the invisible sweep of a magic circle.</p>
