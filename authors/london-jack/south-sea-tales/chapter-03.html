<P>
He weighed one hundred and ten pounds. His hair was kinky and negroid, and he
was black. He was peculiarly black. He was neither blue-black nor
purple-black, but plum-black. His name was Mauki, and he was the son of a
chief. He had three tambos.  Tambo is Melanesian for taboo, and is first
cousin to that Polynesian word. Mauki's three tambos were as follows: First,
he must never shake hands with a woman, nor have a woman's hand touch him or
any of his personal belongings; secondly, he must never eat clams nor any food
from a fire in which clams had been cooked; thirdly, he must never touch a
crocodile, nor travel in a canoe that carried any part of a crocodile even if
as large as a tooth.
<P>
Of a different black were his teeeth, which were deep black, or, perhaps
better, LAMP-black. They had been made so in a single night, by his mother,
who had compressed about them a powdered mineral which was dug from the
landslide back of Port Adams.  Port Adams is a salt-water village on Malaita,
and Malaita is the most savage island in the Solomons--so savage that no
traders or planters have yet gained a foothold on it; while, from the time of
the earliest bï¿½che-de-mer fishers and sandalwood traders down to the latest
labor recruiters equipped with automatic rifles and gasolene engines, scores
of white adventurers have been passed out by tomahawks and soft-nosed Snider
bullets. So Malaita remains today, in the twentieth century, the stamping
ground of the labor recruiters, who farm its coasts for laborers who engage
and contract themselves to toil on the plantations of the neighboring and more
civilized islands for a wage of thirty dollars a year. The natives of those
neighboring and more civilized islands have themselves become too civilized to
work on plantations.
<P>
Mauki's ears were pierced, not in one place, nor two places, but in a couple
of dozen places. In one of the smaller holes he carried a clay pipe. The
larger holes were too large for such use. The bowl of the pipe would have
fallen through. In fact, in the largest hole in each ear he habitually wore
round wooden plugs that were an even four inches in diameter. Roughly
speaking, the circumference of said holes was twelve and one-half inches.
Mauki was catholic in his tastes. In the various smaller holes he carried such
things as empty rifle cartridges, horseshoe nails, copper screws, pieces of
string, braids of sennit, strips of green leaf, and, in the cool of the day,
scarlet hibiscus flowers. From which it will be seen that pockets were not
necessary to his well-being. Besides, pockets were impossible, for his only
wearing apparel consisted of a piece of calico several inches wide. A pocket
knife he wore in his hair, the blade snapped down on a kinky lock. His most
prized possession was the handle of a china cup, which he suspended from a
ring of turtle-shell, which, in turn, was passed through the
partition-cartilage of his nose.
<P>
But in spite of embellishments, Mauki had a nice face. It was really a pretty
face, viewed by any standard, and for a Melanesian it was a remarkably
good-looking face. Its one fault was its lack of strength. It was softly
effeminate, almost girlish. The features were small, regular, and delicate.
The chin was weak, and the mouth was weak. There was no strength nor character
in the jaws, forehead, and nose. In the eyes only could be caught any hint of
the unknown quantities that were so large a part of his make-up and that other
persons could not understand. These unknown quantities were pluck,
pertinacity, fearlessness, imagination, and cunning; and when they found
expression in some consistent and striking action, those about him were
astounded.
<P>
Mauki's father was chief over the village at Port Adams, and thus, by birth a
salt-water man, Mauki was half amphibian. He knew the way of the fishes and
oysters, and the reef was an open book to him. Canoes, also, he knew. He
learned to swim when he was a year old. At seven years he could hold his
breath a full minute and swim straight down to bottom through thirty feet of
water. And at seven years he was stolen by the bushmen, who cannot even swim
and who are afraid of salt water. Thereafter Mauki saw the sea only from a
distance, through rifts in the jungle and from open spaces on the high
mountain sides. He became the slave of old Fanfoa, head chief over a score of
scattered bush-villages on the range-lips of Malaita, the smoke of which, on
calm mornings, is about the only evidence the seafaring white men have of the
teeming interior population. For the whites do not penetrate Malaita. They
tried it once, in the days when the search was on for gold, but they always
left their heads behind to grin from the smoky rafters of the bushmen's huts.
<P>
When Mauki was a young man of seventeen, Fanfoa got out of tobacco. He got
dreadfully out of tobacco. It was hard times in all his villages. He had been
guilty of a mistake. Suo was a harbor so small that a large schooner could not
swing at anchor in it. It was surrounded by mangroves that overhung the deep
water. It was a trap, and into the trap sailed two white men in a small ketch.
They were after recruits, and they possessed much tobacco and trade goods, to
say nothing of three rifles and plenty of ammunition. Now there were no
salt-water men living at Suo, and it was there that the bushmen could come
down to the sea. The ketch did a splendid traffic. It signed on twenty
recruits the first day. Even old Fanfoa signed on. And that same day the score
of new recruits chopped off the two white men's head, killed the boat's crew,
and burned the ketch.  Thereafter, and for three months, there was tobacco and
trade goods in plenty and to spare in all the bush villages. Then came the
man-of-war that threw shells for miles into the hills, frightening the people
out of their villages and into the deeper bush. Next the man-of-war sent
landing parties ashore. The villages were all burned, along with the tobacco
and trade stuff.
<P>
The cocoanuts and bananas were chopped down, the taro gardens uprooted, and
the pigs and chickens killed.
<P>
It taught Fanfoa a lesson, but in the meantime he was out of tobacco. Also,
his young men were too frightened to sign on with the recruiting vessels. That
was why Fanfoa ordered his slave, Mauki, to be carried down and signed on for
half a case of tobacco advance, along with knives, axes, calico, and beads,
which he would pay for with his toil on the plantations. Mauki was sorely
frightened when they brought him on board the schooner. He was a lamb led to
the slaughter. White men were ferocious creatures. They had to be, or else
they would not make a practice of venturing along the Malaita coast and into
all harbors, two on a schooner, when each schooner carried from fifteen to
twenty blacks as boat's crew, and often as high as sixty or seventy black
recruits. In addition to this, there was always the danger of the shore
population, the sudden attack and the cutting off of the schooner and all
hands. Truly, white men must be terrible. Besides, they were possessed of such
devil-devils--rifles that shot very rapidly many times, things of iron and
brass that made the schooners go when there was no wind, and boxes that talked
and laughed just as men talked and laughed.
<P>
Ay, and he had heard of one white man whose particular devil-devil was so
powerful that he could take out all his teeth and put them back at will.
<P>
Down into the cabin they took Mauki. On deck, the one white man kept guard
with two revolvers in his belt. In the cabin the other white man sat with a
book before him, in which he inscribed strange marks and lines. He looked at
Mauki as though he had been a pig or a fowl, glanced under the hollows of his
arms, and wrote in the book. Then he held out the writing stick and Mauki just
barely touched it with his hand, in so doing pledging himself to toil for
three years on the plantations of the Moongleam Soap Company. It was not
explained to him that the will of the ferocious white men would be used to
enforce the pledge, and that, behind all, for the same use, was all the power
and all the warships of Great Britain.
<P>
Other blacks there were on board, from unheard-of far places, and when the
white man spoke to them, they tore the long feather from Mauki's hair, cut
that same hair short, and wrapped about his waist a lava-lava of bright yellow
calico.
<P>
After many days on the schooner, and after beholding more land and islands
than he had ever dreamed of, he was landed on New Georgia, and put to work in
the field clearing jungle and cutting cane grass. For the first time he knew
what work was. Even as a slave to Fanfoa he had not worked like this. And he
did not like work. It was up at dawn and in at dark, on two meals a day. And
the food was tiresome. For weeks at a time they were given nothing but sweet
potatoes to eat, and for weeks at a time it would be nothing but rice. He cut
out the cocoanut from the shells day after day; and for long days and weeks he
fed the fires that smoked the copra, till his eyes got sore and he was set to
felling trees. He was a good axe-man, and later he was put in the
bridge-building gang. Once, he was punished by being put in the road-building
gang. At times he served as boat's crew in the whale boats, when they brought
in copra from distant beaches or when the white men went out to dynamite fish.
<P>
Among other things he learned beche-de-mer English, with which he could talk
with all white men, and with all recruits who otherwise would have talked in a
thousand different dialects.  Also, he learned certain things about the white
men, principally that they kept their word. If they told a boy he was going to
receive a stick of tobacco, he got it. If they told a boy they would knock
seven bells out of him if he did a certain thing, when he did that thing,
seven bells invariably were knocked out of him. Mauki did not know what seven
bells were, but they occurred in beche-de-mer, and he imagined them to be the
blood and teeth that sometimes accompanied the process of knocking out seven
bells. One other thing he learned: no boy was struck or punished unless he did
wrong. Even when the white men were drunk, as they were frequently, they never
struck unless a rule had been broken.
<P>
Mauki did not like the plantation. He hated work, and he was the son of a
chief. Furthermore, it was ten years since he had been stolen from Port Adams
by Fanfoa, and he was homesick. He was even homesick for the slavery under
Fanfoa. So he ran away. He struck back into the bush, with the idea of working
southward to the beach and stealing a canoe in which to go home to Port Adams.
<P>
But the fever got him, and he was captured and brought back more dead than
alive.
<P>
A second time he ran away, in the company of two Malaita boys.  They got down
the coast twenty miles, and were hidden in the hut of a Malaita freeman, who
dwelt in that village. But in the dead of night two white men came, who were
not afraid of all the village people and who knocked seven bells out of the
three runaways, tied them like pigs, and tossed them into the whale boat. But
the man in whose house they had hidden--seven times seven bells must have been
knocked out of him from the way the hair, skin, and teeth flew, and he was
discouraged for the rest of his natural life from harboring runaway laborers.
<P>
For a year Mauki toiled on. Then he was made a house-boy, and had good food
and easy times, with light work in keeping the house clean and serving the
white men with whiskey and beer at all hours of the day and most hours of the
night. He liked it, but he liked Port Adams more. He had two years longer to
serve, but two years were too long for him in the throes of homesickness. He
had grown wiser with his year of service, and, being now a house-boy, he had
opportunity. He had the cleaning of the rifles, and he knew where the key to
the store room was hung. He planned to escape, and one night ten Malaita boys
and one boy from San Cristoval sneaked from the barracks and dragged one of
the whale boats down to the beach. It was Mauki who supplied the key that
opened the padlock on the boat, and it was Mauki who equipped the boat with a
dozen Winchesters, an immense amount of ammunition, a case of dynamite with
detonators and fuse, and ten cases of tobacco.
<P>
The northwest monsoon was blowing, and they fled south in the night time,
hiding by day on detached and uninhabited islets, or dragging their whale boat
into the bush on the large islands. Thus they gained Guadalcanar, skirted
halfway along it, and crossed the Indispensable Straits to Florida Island. It
was here that they killed the San Cristoval boy, saving his head and cooking
and eating the rest of him. The Malaita coast was only twenty miles away, but
the last night a strong current and baffling winds prevented them from gaining
across. Daylight found them still several miles from their goal. But daylight
brought a cutter, in which were two white men, who were not afraid of eleven
Malaita men armed with twelve rifles. Mauki and his companions were carried
back to Tulagi, where lived the great white master of all the white men. And
the great white master held a court, after which, one by one, the runaways
were tied up and given twenty lashes each, and sentenced to a fine of fifteen
dollars. They were sent back to New Georgia, where the white men knocked seven
bells out of them all around and put them to work.  But Mauki was no longer
house-boy. He was put in the road-making gang. The fine of fifteen dollars had
been paid by the white men from whom he had run away, and he was told that he
would have to work it out, which meant six months' additional toil. Further,
his share of the stolen tobacco earned him another year of toil.
<P>
Port Adams was now three years and a half away, so he stole a canoe one night,
hid on the islets in Manning Straits, passed through the Straits, and began
working along the eastern coast of Ysabel, only to be captured, two-thirds of
the way along, by the white men on Meringe Lagoon. After a week, he escaped
from them and took to the bush. There were no bush natives on Ysabel, only
salt-water men, who were all Christians. The white men put up a reward of
five-hundred sticks of tobacco, and every time Mauki ventured down to the sea
to steal a canoe he was chased by the salt-water men. Four months of this
passed, when, the reward having been raised to a thousand sticks, he was
caught and sent back to New Georgia and the road-building gang. Now a thousand
sticks are worth fifty dollars, and Mauki had to pay the reward himself, which
required a year and eight months' labor. So Port Adams was now five years
away.
<P>
His homesickness was greater than ever, and it did not appeal to him to settle
down and be good, work out his four years, and go home. The next time, he was
caught in the very act of running away. His case was brought before Mr.
Haveby, the island manager of the Moongleam Soap Company, who adjudged him an
incorrigible.  The Company had plantations on the Santa Cruz Islands, hundreds
of miles across the sea, and there it sent its Solomon Islands' incorrigibles.
And there Mauki was sent, though he never arrived. The schooner stopped at
Santa Anna, and in the night Mauki swam ashore, where he stole two rifles and
a case of tobacco from the trader and got away in a canoe to Cristoval.
Malaita was now to the north, fifty or sixty miles away. But when he attempted
the passage, he was caught by a light gale and driven back to Santa Anna,
where the trader clapped him in irons and held him against the return of the
schooner from Santa Cruz.  The two rifles the trader recovered, but the case
of tobacco was charged up to Mauki at the rate of another year. The sum of
years he now owed the Company was six.
<P>
On the way back to New Georgia, the schooner dropped anchor in Marau Sound,
which lies at the southeastern extremity of Guadalcanar. Mauki swam ashore
with handcuffs on his wrists and got away to the bush. The schooner went on,
but the Moongleam trader ashore offered a thousand sticks, and to him Mauki
was brought by the bushmen with a year and eight months tacked on to his
account. Again, and before the schooner called in, he got away, this time in a
whale boat accompanied by a case of the trader's tobacco. But a northwest gale
wrecked him upon Ugi, where the Christian natives stole his tobacco and turned
him over to the Moongleam trader who resided there. The tobacco the natives
stole meant another year for him, and the tale was now eight years and a half.
<P>
"We'll send him to Lord Howe," said Mr. Haveby. "Bunster is there, and we'll
let them settle it between them. It will be a case, I imagine, of Mauki
getting Bunster, or Bunster getting Mauki, and good riddance in either event."
<P>
If one leaves Meringe Lagoon, on Ysabel, and steers a course due north,
magnetic, at the end of one hundred and fifty miles he will lift the pounded
coral beaches of Lord Howe above the sea.  Lord Howe is a ring of land some
one hundred and fifty miles in circumference, several hundred yards wide at
its widest, and towering in places to a height of ten feet above sea level. 
Inside this ring of sand is a mighty lagoon studded with coral patches. Lord
Howe belongs to the Solomons neither geographically nor ethnologically. It is
an atoll, while the Solomons are high islands; and its people and language are
Polynesian, while the inhabitants of the Solomons are Melanesian.
<P>
Lord Howe has been populated by the westward Polynesian drift which continues
to this day, big outrigger canoes being washed upon its beaches by the
southeast trade. That there has been a slight Melanesian drift in the period
of the northwest monsoon, is also evident.
<P>
Nobody ever comes to Lord Howe, or Ontong-Java as it is sometimes called.
Thomas Cook & Son do not sell tickets to it, and tourists do not dream of its
existence. Not even a white missionary has landed on its shore. Its five
thousand natives are as peaceable as they are primitive. Yet they were not
always peaceable. The Sailing Directions speak of them as hostile and
treacherous. But the men who compile the Sailing Directions have never heard
of the change that was worked in the hearts of the inhabitants, who, not many
years ago, cut off a big bark and killed all hands with the exception of the
second mate. The survivor carried the news to his brothers. The captains of
three trading schooners returned with him to Lord Howe. They sailed their
vessels right into the lagoon and proceeded to preach the white man's gospel
that only white men shall kill white men and that the lesser breeds must keep
hands off. The schooners sailed up and down the lagoon, harrying and
destroying. There was no escape from the narrow sand-circle, no bush to which
to flee.  The men were shot down at sight, and there was no avoiding being
sighted. The villages were burned, the canoes smashed, the chickens and pigs
killed, and the precious cocoanut trees chopped down. For a month this
continued, when the schooner sailed away; but the fear of the white man had
been seared into the souls of the islanders and never again were they rash
enough to harm one.
<P>
Max Bunster was the one white man on Lord Howe, trading in the pay of the
ubiquitous Moongleam Soap Company. And the Company billeted him on Lord Howe,
because, next to getting rid of him, it was the most out-of-the-way place to
be found. That the Company did not get rid of him was due to the difficulty of
finding another man to take his place. He was a strapping big German, with
something wrong in his brain. Semi-madness would be a charitable statement of
his condition. He was a bully and a coward, and a thrice-bigger savage than
any savage on the island.
<P>
Being a coward, his brutality was of the cowardly order. When he first went
into the Company's employ, he was stationed on Savo.  When a consumptive
colonial was sent to take his place, he beat him up with his fists and sent
him off a wreck in the schooner that brought him.
<P>
Mr. Haveby next selected a young Yorkshire giant to relieve Bunster. The
Yorkshire man had a reputation as a bruiser and preferred fighting to eating.
But Bunster wouldn't fight. He was a regular little lamb--for ten days, at the
end of which time the Yorkshire man was prostrated by a combined attack of
dysentery and fever. Then Bunster went for him, among other things getting him
down and jumping on him a score or so of times. Afraid of what would happen
when his victim recovered. Bunster fled away in a cutter to Guvutu, where he
signalized himself by beating up a young Englishman already crippled by a Boer
bullet through both hips.
<P>
Then it was that Mr. Haveby sent Bunster to Lord Howe, the falling-off place.
He celebrated his landing by mopping up half a case of gin and by thrashing
the elderly and wheezy mate of the schooner which had brought him. When the
schooner departed, he called the kanakas down to the beach and challenged them
to throw him in a wrestling bout, promising a case of tobacco to the one who
succeeded. Three kanakas he threw, but was promptly thrown by a fourth, who,
instead of receiving the tobacco, got a bullet through his lungs.
<P>
And so began Bunster's reign on Lord Howe. Three thousand people lived in the
principal village; but it was deserted, even in broad day, when he passed
through. Men, women, and children fled before him. Even the dogs and pigs got
out of the way, while the king was not above hiding under a mat. The two prime
ministers lived in terror of Bunster, who never discussed any moot subject,
but struck out with his fists instead.
<P>
And to Lord Howe came Mauki, to toil for Bunster for eight long years and a
half. There was no escaping from Lord Howe. For better or worse, Bunster and
he were tied together. Bunster weighed two hundred pounds. Mauki weighed one
hundred and ten.  Bunster was a degenerate brute. But Mauki was a primitive
savage. While both had wills and ways of their own.
<P>
Mauki had no idea of the sort of master he was to work for. He had had no
warnings, and he had concluded as a matter of course that Bunster would be
like other white men, a drinker of much whiskey, a ruler and a lawgiver who
always kept his word and who never struck a boy undeserved. Bunster had the
advantage. He knew all about Mauki, and gloated over the coming into
possession of him. The last cook was suffering from a broken arm and a
dislocated shoulder, so Bunster made Mauki cook and general house-boy.
<P>
And Mauki soon learned that there were white men and white men.  On the very
day the schooner departed he was ordered to buy a chicken from Samisee, the
native Tongan missionary. But Samisee had sailed across the lagoon and would
not be back for three days. Mauki returned with the information. He climbed
the steep stairway (the house stood on piles twelve feet above the sand), and
entered the living room to report. The trader demanded the chicken. Mauki
opened his mouth to explain the missionary's absence. But Bunster did not care
for explanations. He struck out with his fist. The blow caught Mauki on the
mouth and lifted him into the air. Clear through the doorway he flew, across
the narrow veranda, breaking the top railing, and down to the ground.
<P>
His lips were a contused, shapeless mass, and his mouth was full of blood and
broken teeth.
<P>
"That'll teach you that back talk don't go with me," the trader shouted,
purple with rage, peering down at him over the broken railing.
<P>
Mauki had never met a white man like this, and he resolved to walk small and
never offend. He saw the boat boys knocked about, and one of them put in irons
for three days with nothing to eat for the crime of breaking a rowlock while
pulling. Then, too, he heard the gossip of the village and learned why Bunster
had taken a third wife--by force, as was well known. The first and second
wives lay in the graveyard, under the white coral sand, with slabs of coral
rock at head and feet. They had died, it was said, from beatings he had given
them. The third wife was certainly ill-used, as Mauki could see for himself.
<P>
But there was no way by which to avoid offending the white man who seemed
offended with life. When Mauki kept silent, he was struck and called a sullen
brute. When he spoke, he was struck for giving back talk. When he was grave,
Bunster accused him of plotting and gave him a thrashing in advance; and when
he strove to be cheerful and to smile, he was charged with sneering at his
lord and master and given a taste of stick. Bunster was a devil.
<P>
The village would have done for him, had it not remembered the lesson of the
three schooners. It might have done for him anyway, if there had been a bush
to which to flee. As it was, the murder of the white men, of any white man,
would bring a man-of-war that would kill the offenders and chop down the
precious cocoanut trees. Then there were the boat boys, with minds fully made
up to drown him by accident at the first opportunity to capsize the cutter.
Only Bunster saw to it that the boat did not capsize.
<P>
Mauki was of a different breed, and escape being impossible while Bunster
lived, he was resolved to get the white man. The trouble was that he could
never find a chance. Bunster was always on guard. Day and night his revolvers
were ready to hand. He permitted nobody to pass behind his back, as Mauki
learned after having been knocked down several times. Bunster knew that he had
more to fear from the good-natured, even sweet-faced, Malaita boy than from
the entire population of Lord Howe; and it gave added zest to the programme of
torment he was carrying out. And Mauki walked small, accepted his punishments,
and waited.
<P>
All other white men had respected his tambos, but not so Bunster.
<P>
Mauki's weekly allowance of tobacco was two sticks. Bunster passed them to his
woman and ordered Mauki to receive them from her hand. But this could not be,
and Mauki went without his tobacco. In the same way he was made to miss many a
meal, and to go hungry many a day. He was ordered to make chowder out of the
big clams that grew in the lagoon. This he could not do, for clams were tambo.
Six times in succession he refused to touch the clams, and six times he was
knocked senseless. Bunster knew that the boy would die first, but called his
refusal mutiny, and would have killed him had there been another cook to take
his place.
<P>
One of the trader's favorite tricks was to catch Mauki's kinky locks and bat
his head against the wall. Another trick was to catch Mauki unawares and
thrust the live end of a cigar against his flesh. This Bunster called
vaccination, and Mauki was vaccinated a number of times a week. Once, in a
rage, Bunster ripped the cup handle from Mauki's nose, tearing the hole clear
out of the cartilage.
<P>
"Oh, what a mug!" was his comment, when he surveyed the damage he had wrought.
<P>
The skin of a shark is like sandpaper, but the skin of a ray fish is like a
rasp. In the South Seas the natives use it as a wood file in smoothing down
canoes and paddles. Bunster had a mitten made of ray fish skin. The first time
he tried it on Mauki, with one sweep of the hand it fetched the skin off his
back from neck to armpit. Bunster was delighted. He gave his wife a taste of
the mitten, and tried it out thoroughly on the boat boys. The prime ministers
came in for a stroke each, and they had to grin and take it for a joke.
<P>
"Laugh, damn you, laugh!" was the cue he gave.
<P>
Mauki came in for the largest share of the mitten. Never a day passed without
a caress from it. There were times when the loss of so much cuticle kept him
awake at night, and often the half-healed surface was raked raw afresh by the
facetious Mr. Bunster. Mauki continued his patient wait, secure in the
knowledge that sooner or later his time would come. And he knew just what he
was going to do, down to the smallest detail, when the time did come.
<P>
One morning Bunster got up in a mood for knocking seven bells out of the
universe. He began on Mauki, and wound up on Mauki, in the interval knocking
down his wife and hammering all the boat boys. At breakfast he called the
coffee slops and threw the scalding contents of the cup into Mauki's face. By
ten o'clock Bunster was shivering with ague, and half an hour later he was
burning with fever. It was no ordinary attack. It quickly became pernicious,
and developed into black-water fever. The days passed, and he grew weaker and
weaker, never leaving his bed.  Mauki waited and watched, the while his skin
grew intact once more. He ordered the boys to beach the cutter, scrub her
bottom, and give her a general overhauling. They thought the order emanated
from Bunster, and they obeyed. But Bunster at the time was lying unconscious
and giving no orders. This was Mauki's chance, but still he waited.
<P>
When the worst was past, and Bunster lay convalescent and conscious, but weak
as a baby, Mauki packed his few trinkets, including the china cup handle, into
his trade box. Then he went over to the village and interviewed the king and
his two prime ministers.
<P>
"This fella Bunster, him good fella you like too much?" he asked.
<P>
They explained in one voice that they liked the trader not at all. The
ministers poured forth a recital of all the indignities and wrongs that had
been heaped upon them. The king broke down and wept. Mauki interrupted rudely.
<P>
"You savve me--me big fella marster my country. You no like m this fella white
marster. Me no like m. Plenty good you put hundred cocoanut, two hundred
cocoanut, three hundred cocoanut along cutter. Him finish, you go sleep m good
fella. Altogether kanaka sleep m good fella. Bime by big fella noise along
house, you no savve hear m that fella noise. You altogether sleep strong fella
too much."
<P>
In like manner Mauki interviewed the boat boys. Then he ordered Bunster's wife
to return to her family house. Had she refused, he would have been in a
quandary, for his tambo would not have permitted him to lay hands on her.
<P>
The house deserted, he entered the sleeping room, where the trader lay in a
doze. Mauki first removed the revolvers, then placed the ray fish mitten on
his hand. Bunster's first warning was a stroke of the mitten that removed the
skin the full length of his nose.
<P>
"Good fella, eh?" Mauki grinned, between two strokes, one of which swept the
forehead bare and the other of which cleaned off one side of his face. "Laugh,
damn you, laugh."
<P>
Mauki did his work throughly, and the kanakas, hiding in their houses, heard
the "big fella noise" that Bunster made and continued to make for an hour or
more.
<P>
When Mauki was done, he carried the boat compass and all the rifles and
ammunition down to the cutter, which he proceeded to ballast with cases of
tobacco. It was while engaged in this that a hideous, skinless thing came out
of the house and ran screaming down the beach till it fell in the sand and
mowed and gibbered under the scorching sun. Mauki looked toward it and
hesitated.  Then he went over and removed the head, which he wrapped in a mat
and stowed in the stern locker of the cutter.
<P>
So soundly did the kanakas sleep through that long hot day that they did not
see the cutter run out through the passage and head south, close-hauled on the
southeast trade. Nor was the cutter ever sighted on that long tack to the
shores of Ysabel, and during the tedious head-beat from there to Malaita. He
landed at Port Adams with a wealth of rifles and tobacco such as no one man
had ever possessed before. But he did not stop there. He had taken a white
man's head, and only the bush could shelter him.  So back he went to the bush
villages, where he shot old Fanfoa and half a dozen of the chief men, and made
himself the chief over all the villages. When his father died, Mauki's brother
ruled in Port Adams, and joined together, salt-water men and bushmen, the
resulting combination was the strongest of the ten score fighting tribes of
Malaita.
<P>
More than his fear of the British government was Mauki's fear of the
all-powerful Moongleam Soap Company; and one day a message came up to him in
the bush, reminding him that he owed the Company eight and one-half years of
labor. He sent back a favorable answer, and then appeared the inevitable white
man, the captain of the schooner, the only white man during Mauki's reign, who
ventured the bush and came out alive. This man not only came out, but he
brought with him seven hundred and fifty dollars in gold sovereigns--the money
price of eight years and a half of labor plus the cost price of certain rifles
and cases of tobacco.
<P>
Mauki no longer weighs one hundred and ten pounds. His stomach is three times
its former girth, and he has four wives. He has many other things--rifles and
revolvers, the handle of a china cup, and an excellent collection of bushmen's
heads. But more precious than the entire collection is another head, perfectly
dried and cured, with sandy hair and a yellowish beard, which is kept wrapped
in the finest of fibre lava-lavas. When Mauki goes to war with villages beyond
his realm, he invariably gets out this head, and alone in his grass palace,
contemplates it long and solemnly. At such times the hush of death falls on
the village, and not even a pickaninny dares make a noise. The head is
esteemed the most powerful devil-devil on Malaita, and to the possession of it
is ascribed all of Mauki's greatness.
