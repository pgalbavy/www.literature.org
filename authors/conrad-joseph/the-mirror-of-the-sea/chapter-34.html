<p> These towns of the Antipodes, not so great then as they are
now, took an interest in the shipping, the running links with
"home," whose numbers confirmed the sense of their growing importance. 
They made it part and parcel of their daily interests.  This was
especially the case in Sydney, where, from the heart of the fair
city, down the vista of important streets, could be seen the wool-clippers
lying at the Circular Quay—no walled prison-house of a dock that,
but the integral part of one of the finest, most beautiful, vast,
and safe bays the sun ever shone upon.  Now great steam-liners
lie at these berths, always reserved for the sea aristocracy—grand
and imposing enough ships, but here to-day and gone next week;
whereas the general cargo, emigrant, and passenger clippers of
my time, rigged with heavy spars, and built on fine lines, used
to remain for months together waiting for their load of wool. 
Their names attained the dignity of household words.  On Sundays
and holidays the citizens trooped down, on visiting bent, and
the lonely officer on duty solaced himself by playing the cicerone—especially
to the citizenesses with engaging manners and a well-developed
sense of the fun that may be got out of the inspection of a ship’s
cabins and state-rooms.  The tinkle of more or less untuned cottage
pianos floated out of open stern-ports till the gas-lamps began
to twinkle in the streets, and the ship’s night-watchman, coming
sleepily on duty after his unsatisfactory day slumbers, hauled
down the flags and fastened a lighted lantern at the break of
the gangway.  The night closed rapidly upon the silent ships with
their crews on shore.  Up a short, steep ascent by the King’s
Head pub., patronized by the cooks and stewards of the fleet,
the voice of a man crying "Hot saveloys!" at the end of George
Street, where the cheap eating-houses (sixpence a meal) were kept
by Chinamen (Sun-kum-on’s was not bad), is heard at regular intervals. 
I have listened for hours to this most pertinacious pedlar (I
wonder whether he is dead or has made a fortune), while sitting
on the rail of the old <em>Duke of S—</em> (she’s dead, poor thing!
a violent death on the coast of New Zealand), fascinated by the
monotony, the regularity, the abruptness of the recurring cry,
and so exasperated at the absurd spell, that I wished the fellow
would choke himself to death with a mouthful of his own infamous
wares.</p>

<p>A stupid job, and fit only for an old man, my comrades used to
tell me, to be the night-watchman of a captive (though honoured)
ship.  And generally the oldest of the able seamen in a ship’s
crew does get it. But sometimes neither the oldest nor any other
fairly steady seaman is forthcoming.  Ships’ crews had the trick
of melting away swiftly in those days.  So, probably on account
of my youth, innocence, and pensive habits (which made me sometimes
dilatory in my work about the rigging), I was suddenly nominated,
in our chief mate Mr. B—’s most sardonic tones, to that enviable
situation.  I do not regret the experience.  The night humours
of the town descended from the street to the waterside in the
still watches of the night: larrikins rushing down in bands to
settle some quarrel by a stand-up fight, away from the police,
in an indistinct ring half hidden by piles of cargo, with the
sounds of blows, a groan now and then, the stamping of feet, and
the cry of "Time!" rising suddenly above the sinister and excited
murmurs; night-prowlers, pursued or pursuing, with a stifled shriek
followed by a profound silence, or slinking stealthily alongside
like ghosts, and addressing me from the quay below in mysterious
tones with incomprehensible propositions.  The cabmen, too, who
twice a week, on the night when the <em>A.S.N. </em>Company’s
passenger-boat was due to arrive, used to range a battalion of
blazing lamps opposite the ship, were very amusing in their way. 
They got down from their perches and told each other impolite
stories in racy language, every word of which reached me distinctly
over the bulwarks as I sat smoking on the main-hatch.  On one
occasion I had an hour or so of a most intellectual conversation
with a person whom I could not see distinctly, a gentleman from
England, he said, with a cultivated voice, I on deck and he on
the quay sitting on the case of a piano (landed out of our hold
that very afternoon), and smoking a cigar which smelt very good. 
We touched, in our discourse, upon science, politics, natural
history, and operatic singers.  Then, after remarking abruptly,
"You seem to be rather intelligent, my man," he informed me pointedly
that his name was Mr. Senior, and walked off—to his hotel, I suppose. 
Shadows!  Shadows!  I think I saw a white whisker as he turned
under the lamp-post.  It is a shock to think that in the natural
course of nature he must be dead by now.  There was nothing to
object to in his intelligence but a little dogmatism maybe.  And
his name was Senior!  Mr. Senior!</p>

<p>The position had its drawbacks, however.  One wintry, blustering,
dark night in July, as I stood sleepily out of the rain under
the break of the poop something resembling an ostrich dashed up
the gangway.  I say ostrich because the creature, though it ran
on two legs, appeared to help its progress by working a pair of
short wings; it was a man, however, only his coat, ripped up the
back and flapping in two halves above his shoulders, gave him
that weird and fowl-like appearance.  At least, I suppose it was
his coat, for it was impossible to make him out distinctly.  How
he managed to come so straight upon me, at speed and without a
stumble over a strange deck, I cannot imagine.  He must have been
able to see in the dark better than any cat.  He overwhelmed me
with panting entreaties to let him take shelter till morning in
our forecastle.  Following my strict orders, I refused his request,
mildly at first, in a sterner tone as he insisted with growing
impudence.</p>

<p>"For God’s sake let me, matey!  Some of ’em are after me—and
I’ve got hold of a ticker here."</p>

<p>"You clear out of this!" I said.</p>

<p>"Don’t be hard on a chap, old man!" he whined pitifully.</p>

<p>"Now then, get ashore at once.  Do you hear?"</p>

<p>Silence.  He appeared to cringe, mute, as if words had failed
him through grief; then—bang! came a concussion and a great flash
of light in which he vanished, leaving me prone on my back with
the most abominable black eye that anybody ever got in the faithful
discharge of duty.  Shadows! Shadows!  I hope he escaped the enemies
he was fleeing from to live and flourish to this day.  But his
fist was uncommonly hard and his aim miraculously true in the
dark.</p>

<p>There were other experiences, less painful and more funny for
the most part, with one amongst them of a dramatic complexion;
but the greatest experience of them all was Mr. B—, our chief
mate himself.</p>

<p>He used to go ashore every night to foregather in some hotel’s
parlour with his crony, the mate of the barque <em>Cicero</em>,
lying on the other side of the Circular Quay.  Late at night I
would hear from afar their stumbling footsteps and their voices
raised in endless argument.  The mate of the <em>Cicero</em> was
seeing his friend on board.  They would continue their senseless
and muddled discourse in tones of profound friendship for half
an hour or so at the shore end of our gangway, and then I would
hear Mr. B— insisting that he must see the other on board his
ship.  And away they would go, their voices, still conversing
with excessive amity, being heard moving all round the harbour. 
It happened more than once that they would thus perambulate three
or four times the distance, each seeing the other on board his
ship out of pure and disinterested affection.  Then, through sheer
weariness, or perhaps in a moment of forgetfulness, they would
manage to part from each other somehow, and by-and-by the planks
of our long gangway would bend and creak under the weight of Mr.
B— coming on board for good at last.</p>

<p>On the rail his burly form would stop and stand swaying.</p>

<p>"Watchman!"</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>A pause.</p>

<p>He waited for a moment of steadiness before negotiating the three
steps of the inside ladder from rail to deck; and the watchman,
taught by experience, would forbear offering help which would
be received as an insult at that particular stage of the mate’s
return.  But many times I trembled for his neck.  He was a heavy
man.</p>

<p>Then with a rush and a thump it would be done.  He never had
to pick himself up; but it took him a minute or so to pull himself
together after the descent.</p>

<p>"Watchman!"</p>

<p>"Sir."</p>

<p>"Captain aboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>"Dog aboard?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Pause.</p>

<p>Our dog was a gaunt and unpleasant beast, more like a wolf in
poor health than a dog, and I never noticed Mr. B— at any other
time show the slightest interest in the doings of the animal. 
But that question never failed.</p>

<p>"Let’s have your arm to steady me along."</p>

<p>I was always prepared for that request.  He leaned on me heavily
till near enough the cabin-door to catch hold of the handle. 
Then he would let go my arm at once.</p>

<p>"That’ll do.  I can manage now."</p>

<p>And he could manage.  He could manage to find his way into his
berth, light his lamp, get into his bed—ay, and get out of it
when I called him at half-past five, the first man on deck, lifting
the cup of morning coffee to his lips with a steady hand, ready
for duty as though he had virtuously slept ten solid hours—a better
chief officer than many a man who had never tasted grog in his
life.  He could manage all that, but could never manage to get
on in life.</p>

<p>Only once he failed to seize the cabin-door handle at the first
grab.  He waited a little, tried again, and again failed.  His
weight was growing heavier on my arm.  He sighed slowly.</p>

<p>"D—n that handle!"</p>

<p>Without letting go his hold of me he turned about, his face lit
up bright as day by the full moon.</p>

<p>"I wish she were out at sea," he growled savagely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>I felt the need to say something, because he hung on to me as
if lost, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>"Ports are no good—ships rot, men go to the devil!"</p>

<p>I kept still, and after a while he repeated with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I wish she were at sea out of this."</p>

<p>"So do I, sir," I ventured.</p>

<p>Holding my shoulder, he turned upon me.</p>

<p>"You!  What’s that to you where she is?  You don’t—drink."</p>

<p>And even on that night he "managed it" at last.  He got hold
of the handle.  But he did not manage to light his lamp (I don’t
think he even tried), though in the morning as usual he was the
first on deck, bull-necked, curly-headed, watching the hands turn-to
with his sardonic expression and unflinching gaze.</p>

<p>I met him ten years afterwards, casually, unexpectedly, in the
street, on coming out of my consignee office.  I was not likely
to have forgotten him with his "I can manage now."  He recognised
me at once, remembered my name, and in what ship I had served
under his orders.  He looked me over from head to foot.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am commanding a little barque," I said, "loading here for
Mauritius." Then, thoughtlessly, I added: "And what are you doing,
Mr. B-?"</p>

<p>"I," he said, looking at me unflinchingly, with his old sardonic
grin—"I am looking for something to do."</p>

<p>I felt I would rather have bitten out my tongue.  His jet-black,
curly hair had turned iron-gray; he was scrupulously neat as ever,
but frightfully threadbare.  His shiny boots were worn down at
heel.  But he forgave me, and we drove off together in a hansom
to dine on board my ship.  He went over her conscientiously, praised
her heartily, congratulated me on my command with absolute sincerity. 
At dinner, as I offered him wine and beer he shook his head, and
as I sat looking at him interrogatively, muttered in an undertone:</p>

<p>"I’ve given up all that."</p>

<p>After dinner we came again on deck.  It seemed as though he could
not tear himself away from the ship.  We were fitting some new
lower rigging, and he hung about, approving, suggesting, giving
me advice in his old manner.  Twice he addressed me as "My boy,"
and corrected himself quickly to "Captain."  My mate was about
to leave me (to get married), but I concealed the fact from Mr.
B—.  I was afraid he would ask me to give him the berth in some
ghastly jocular hint that I could not refuse to take. I was afraid. 
It would have been impossible.  I could not have given orders
to Mr. B—, and I am sure he would not have taken them from me
very long.  He could not have managed that, though he had managed
to break himself from drink—too late.</p>

<p>He said good-bye at last.  As I watched his burly, bull-necked
figure walk away up the street, I wondered with a sinking heart
whether he had much more than the price of a night’s lodging in
his pocket.  And I understood that if that very minute I were
to call out after him, he would not even turn his head.  He, too,
is no more than a shadow, but I seem to hear his words spoken
on the moonlit deck of the old <em>Duke</em> —:</p>

<p>"Ports are no good—ships rot, men go to the devil!"</p>
