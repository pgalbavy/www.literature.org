<p>A week later I had a visit from old Mercer. He came to my house
in the evening just after the closing of the store. First of all,
he paid out to me the gold I had lost from my ship at Accomac,
with all the gravity in the world, as if it had been an ordinary
merchant's bargain. Then he produced some papers, and putting
on big horn spectacles, proceeded to instruct me in them. They
were lists, fuller than those I had already got, of men up and
down the country whom Lawrence trusted. Some I had met, many I
knew of, but two or three gave me a start. There was a planter
in Henricus who had treated me like dirt, and some names from
Essex county that I did not expect. Especially there were several
in James Town itself&mdash;one a lawyer body I had thought the obedient
serf of the London merchants, one the schoolmaster, and another
a drunken skipper of a river boat. But what struck me most was
the name of Colonel Beverley.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of all these?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Sure as death," he said. "I'm not saying that they're all friends
of yours, Mr. Garvald. Ye've trampled on a good wheen toes since
you came to these parts. But they're all men to ride the ford
with, if that should come which we ken of."</p>

<p>Some of the men on the list were poor settlers, and it was our
business to equip them with horse and gun. That was to be my special
duty&mdash;that and the establishing of means by which they could be
summoned quickly. With the first Mercer could help me, for he
had his hand on all the lines of the smuggling business, and there
were a dozen ports on the coast where he could land arms. Horses
were an easy matter, requiring only the doling out of money. But
the summoning business was to be my particular care. I could go
about the country in my ordinary way of trade without exciting
suspicion, and my house was to be the rendezvous of every man
on the list who wanted news or guidance.</p>

<p>"Can ye trust your men?" Mercer asked, and I replied that Faulkner
was as staunch as cold steel, and that he had picked the others.</p>

<p>"Well, let's see your accommodation," and the old fellow hopped
to his feet, and was out of doors before I could get the lantern.</p>

<p>Mercer on a matter of this sort was a different being from the
decayed landlord of the water-side tavern. His spectacled eyes
peered everywhere, and his shrewd sense judged instantly of a
thing's value. He approved of the tobacco-shed as a store for
arms, for he could reach it from the river by a little-used road
through the woods. It was easy so to arrange, the contents that
a passing visitor could guess nothing, and no one ever penetrated
to its recesses but Faulkner and myself. I summoned Faulkner to
the conference, and told him his duties, which, he undertook with
sober interest. He was a dry stick from Fife, who spoke seldom
and wrought mightily.</p>

<p>Faulkner attended to Mercer's consignments, and I took once more
to the road. I had to arrange that arms from the coast or the
river-sides could be sent inland, and for this purpose I had a
regiment of pack horses that delivered my own stores as well.
I had to visit all the men on the list whom I did not know, and
a weary job it was. I repeated again my toil of the first year,
and in the hot Virginian summer rode the length and breadth of
the land. My own business prospered hugely, and I bought on credit
such a stock of tobacco as made me write my uncle for a fourth
ship at the harvest sailing. It seemed a strange thing, I remember,
to be bargaining for stuff which might never be delivered, for
by the autumn the dominion might be at death grips.</p>

<p>In those weeks I discovered what kind of force Lawrence leaned
on. He who only knew James Town and the rich planters knew little
of the true Virginia. There were old men who had long memories
of Indian fights, and men in their prime who had risen with Bacon,
and young men who had their eyes turned to the unknown West. There
were new-comers from Scotland and North Ireland, and a stout band
of French Protestants, most of them gently born, who had sought
freedom for their faith beyond the sway of King Louis. You cannot
picture a hardier or more spirited race than the fellows I thus
recruited. The forest settler who swung an axe all day for his
livelihood could have felled the ordinary fine gentleman with
one blow of his fist. And they could shoot too, with their rusty
matchlocks or clumsy snaphances. In some few the motive was fear,
for they had seen or heard of the tender mercies of the savages.
But in most, I think, it was a love of bold adventure, and especially
the craving to push the white man's province beyond the narrow
borders of the Tidewater. If you say that this was something more
than defence, I claim that the only way to protect a country is
to make sure of its environs. What hope is there of peace if your
frontier is the rim of an unknown forest?</p>

<p>My hardest task was to establish some method of sending news
to the outland dwellers. For this purpose I had to consort with
queer folk. Shalah, who had become my second shadow, found here
and there little Indian camps, from which he chose young men as
messengers. In one place I would get a settler with a canoe, in
another a woodman with a fast horse; and in a third some lad who
prided himself on his legs. The rare country taverns were a help,
for most of their owners were in the secret. The Tidewater is
a flat forest region, so we could not light beacons as in a hilly
land. But by the aid of Shalah's woodcraft I concocted a set of
marks on trees and dwellings which would speak a language to any
initiate traveller. The Indians, too, had their own silent tongue,
by which they could send messages over many leagues in a short
space. I never learned the trick of it, though I tried hard with
Shalah as interpreter; for that you must have been suckled in
a wigwam.</p>

<p>When I got back to James Town, Faulkner would report on his visitors,
and he seems to have had many. Rough fellows would ride up at
the darkening, bringing a line from Mercer, or more often an agreed
password, and he had to satisfy their wants and remember their
news. So far I had had no word from Lawrence, though Mercer reported
that Ringan was still sending arms. That tobacco-shed of mine
would have made a brave explosion if some one had kindled it,
and, indeed, the thing more than once was near happening through
a negro's foolishness. I spent all my evenings, when at home,
in making a map of the country. I had got a rough chart from the
Surveyor-General, and filled up such parts as I knew, and over
all I spread a network of lines which meant my ways of sending
news. For instance, to get to a man in Essex county, the word
would be passed by Middle Plantation to York Ferry. Thence in
an Indian's canoe it would be carried to Aird's store on the Mattaponey,
from which a woodman would take it across the swamps to a clump
of hemlocks. There he would make certain marks, and a long-legged
lad from the Rappahannock, riding by daily to school, would carry
the tidings to the man I wanted. And so forth over the habitable
dominion. I calculated that there were not more than a dozen of
Lawrence's men who within three days could not get the summons
and within five be at the proper rendezvous.</p>

<p>One evening I was surprised by a visit from Colonel Beverley.
He came openly on a fine bay horse with two mounted negroes as
attendants. I had parted from him dryly, and had been surprised
to find that he was one of us; but when I had talked with him
a little, it appeared that he had had a big share in planning
the whole business. We mentioned no names, but I gathered that
he knew Lawrence, and was at least aware of Ringan. He warned
me, I remember, to be on my guard against some of the young bloods,
who might visit me to make mischief. "It's not that they know
anything of our affairs," he said, "but that they have got a prejudice
against yourself, Mr. Garvald. They are foolish, hot-headed lads,
very puffed up by their pride of gentrice, and I do not like the
notion of their playing pranks in that tobacco-shed."</p>

<p>I asked him a question which had long puzzled me, why the natural
defence of a country should be kept so secret. "The Governor,
at any rate," I said, "would approve, and we are not asking the
burgesses for a single guinea."</p>

<p>"Yes, but the Governor would play a wild hand," was the answer.
"He would never permit the thing to go on quietly, but would want
to ride at the head of the men, and the whole fat would be in
the fire. You must know. Mr. Garvald, that politics run high in
our Virginia. There are scores of men who would see in our enterprise
a second attempt like Bacon's, and, though they might approve
of our aims, would never hear of one of Bacon's folk serving with
us. I was never a Bacon's man, for I was with Berkeley in Accomac
and at the taking of James Town, but I know the quality of the
rough fellows that Bacon led, and I want them all for this adventure.
Besides, who can deny that there is more in our plans than a defence
against Indians? There are many who feel with me that Virginia
can never grow to the fullness of a nation so long as she is cooped
up in the Tidewater. New-comers arrive by every ship from England,
and press on into the wilderness. But there can be no conquest
of the wilderness till we have broken the Indian menace, and pushed
our frontier up to the hills&mdash;ay, and beyond them. But tell that
to the ordinary planter, and he will assign you to the devil.
He fears these new-comers, who are simple fellows that do not
respect his grandeur. He fears that some day they may control
the assembly by their votes. He wants the Tidewater to be his
castle, with porters and guards to hound away strangers. Man alive,
if you had tried to put reason into some of their heads, you would
despair of human nature. Let them get a hint of our preparations,
and there will be petitions to Council and a howling about treason,
and in a week you will be in gaol, Mr. Garvald. So we must move
cannily, as you Scots say."</p>

<p>That conversation made me wary, and I got Faulkner to keep a
special guard on the place when I was absent. At the worst, he
could summon Mercer, who would bring a rough crew from the water-side
to his aid. Then once more I disappeared into the woods.</p>

<p>In these days a new Shalah revealed himself. I think he had been
watching me closely for the past months, and slowly I had won
his approval. He showed it by beginning to talk as he loped by
my side in our forest wanderings. The man was like no Indian I
have ever seen. He was a Senecan, and so should have been on the
side of the Long House; but it was plain that he was an outcast
from his tribe, and, indeed, from the whole Indian brotherhood.
I could not fathom him, for he seemed among savages to be held
in deep respect, and yet here he was, the ally of the white man
against his race. His lean, supple figure, his passionless face,
and his high, masterful air had a singular nobility in them. To
me he was never the servant, scarcely even the companion, for
he seemed like a being from another world, who had a knowledge
of things hid from human ken. In woodcraft he was a master beyond
all thought of rivalry. Often, when time did not press, he would
lead me, clumsy as I was, so that I could almost touch the muzzle
of a crouching deer, or lay a hand on a yellow panther, before
it slipped like a live streak of light into the gloom. He was
an eery fellow, too. Once I found him on a high river bank at
sunset watching the red glow behind the blue shadowy forest.</p>

<p>"There is blood in the West," he said, pointing like a prophet
with his long arm, "There is blood in the hills which is flowing
to the waters. At the Moon of Stags it will flow, and by the Moon
of Wildfowl it will have stained the sea."</p>

<p>He had always the hills at the back of his head. Once, when we
caught a glimpse of them from a place far up the James River,
he stood like a statue gazing at the thin line which hung like
a cloud in the west. I am upland bred, and to me, too, the sight
was a comfort as I stood beside him.</p>

<p>"The <em>Manitou</em> in the hills is calling," he said abruptly.
"I wait a little, but not long. You too will follow, brother,
to where the hawks wheel and the streams fall in vapour. There
we shall find death or love, I know not which, but it will be
a great finding. The gods have written it on my heart."</p>

<p>Then he turned and strode away, and I did not dare to question
him. There was that about him which stirred my prosaic soul into
a wild poetry, till for the moment I saw with his eyes, and heard
strange voices in the trees.</p>

<p>Apart from these uncanny moods he was the most faithful helper
in my task. Without him I must have been a mere child. I could
not read the lore of the forest; I could not have found my way
as he found it through pathless places. From him, too, I learned
that we were not to make our preparations unwatched.</p>

<p>Once, as we were coming from the Rappahannock to the York, he
darted suddenly into the undergrowth below the chestnuts. My eye
could see no clue on the path, and, suspecting nothing, I waited
on him to return. Presently he came, and beckoned me to follow.
Thirty yards into the coppice we found a man lying dead, with
a sharp stake holding him to the ground, and a raw, red mass where
had been once his head.</p>

<p>"That was your messenger, brother," he whispered, "the one who
was to carry word from the Mattaponey to the north. See, he has
been dead for two suns."</p>

<p>He was one of the tame Algonquins who dwelt by Aird's store.</p>

<p>"Who did it?" I asked, with a very sick stomach.</p>

<p>"A Cherokee. Some cunning one, and he left a sign to guide us."</p>

<p>He showed me a fir-cone he had picked up from the path, with
the sharp end cut short and a thorn stuck in the middle.</p>

<p>The thing disquieted me horribly, for we had heard no word yet
of any movement from the West. And yet it seemed that our enemy's
scouts had come far down into the Tidewater, and knew enough to
single out for death a man we had enrolled for service. Shalah
slipped off without a word, and I was left to continue my journey
alone. I will not pretend that I liked the business. I saw an
Indian in every patch of shadow, and looked pretty often to my
pistols before I reached the security of Aird's house.</p>

<p>Four days later Shalah appeared at James Town. "They were three,"
he said simply. "They came from the hills a moon ago, and have
been making bad trouble on the Rappahannock. I found them at the
place above the beaver traps of the Ooniche. They return no more
to their people."</p>

<p>After that we sent out warnings, and kept a close eye on the
different lodges of the Algonquins. But nothing happened till
weeks later, when the tragedy on the Rapidan fell on us like a
thunderclap.</p>

<p>All this time I had been too busy to go near the town or the
horse-racings and holiday meetings where I might have seen Elspeth.
But I do not think she was ever many minutes out of my mind. Indeed,
I was almost afraid of a meeting, lest it should shatter the bright
picture which comforted my solitude. But one evening in June as
I jogged home from Middle Plantation through the groves of walnuts,
I came suddenly at the turn of the road on a party. Doctor James
Blair, mounted on a stout Flanders cob, held the middle of the
path, and at his side rode the girl, while two servants followed
with travelling valises. I was upon them before I could rein up,
and the Doctor cried a hearty good-day. So I took my place by
Elspeth, and, with my heart beating wildly, accompanied them through
the leafy avenues and by the green melon-beds in the clearings
till we came out on the prospect of the river.</p>

<p>The Doctor had a kindness for me, and was eager to talk of his
doings. He was almost as great a moss-trooper as myself, and,
with Elspeth for company, had visited near every settlement in
the dominion. Education and Christian privileges were his care,
and he deplored the backward state of the land. I remember that
even then he was full of his scheme for a Virginian college to
be established at Middle Plantation, and he wrote weekly letters
to his English friends soliciting countenance and funds. Of the
happy issue of these hopes, and the great college which now stands
at Williamsburg, there is no need to remind this generation.</p>

<p>But in that hour I thought little of education. The Doctor boomed
away in his deep voice, and I gave him heedless answers. My eyes
were ever wandering to the slim figure at my side. She wore a
broad hat of straw, I remember, and her skirt and kirtle were
of green, the fairies' colour. I think she was wearied with the
sun, for she spoke little; but her eyes when they met mine were
kind. That day I was not ashamed of my plain clothes or my homely
face, for they suited well with the road. My great boots of untanned
buckskin were red with dust, I was bronzed like an Indian, and
the sun had taken the colour out of my old blue coat. But I smacked
of travel and enterprise, which to an honest heart are dearer
than brocade. Also I had a notion that my very homeliness revived
in her the memories of our common motherland. I had nothing to
say, having acquired the woodland habit of silence, and perhaps
it was well. My clumsy tongue would have only broken the spell
which the sunlit forests had woven around us.</p>

<p>As we reached my house a cavalier rode up with a bow and a splendid
sweep of his hat. 'Twas my acquaintance, Mr. Grey, come to greet
the travellers. Elspeth gave me her hand at parting, and I had
from the cavalier the finest glance of hate and jealousy which
ever comforted the heart of a backward lover.</p>
