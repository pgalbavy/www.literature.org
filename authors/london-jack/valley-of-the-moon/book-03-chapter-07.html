<P>
They left Carme1 River and Carmel Valley behind, and with a
rising sun went south across the hills between the mountains and
the sea. The road was badly washed and gullied and showed little
sign of travel.
<P>
"It peters out altogether farther down," Billy said. "From there
on it's only horse trails. But I don't see much signs of timber,
an' this soil's none so good. It's only used for pasture--no
farmin' to speak of."
<P>
The hills were bare and grassy. Only the canyons were wooded,
while the higher and more distant hills were furry with
chaparral. Once they saw a coyote slide into the brush, and
once Billy wished for a gun when a large wildcat stared at
them malignantly and declined to run until routed by a clod of
earth that burst about its ears like shrapnel.
<P>
Several miles along Saxon complained of thirst. Where the road
dipped nearly at sea level to cross a small gulch Billy looked
for water. The bed of the gulch was damp with hill-drip, and he
left her to rest while he sought a spring.
<P>
"Say," he hailed a few minutes afterward. "Come on down. You just
gotta see this. It'll 'most take your breath away."
<P>
Saxon followed the faint path that led steeply down through the
thicket. Midway along, where a barbed wire fence was strung high
across the mouth of the gulch and weighted down with big rocks,
she caught her first glimpse of the tiny beach. Only from the sea
could one guess its existence, so completely was it tucked away
on three precipitous sides by the land, and screened by the
thicket. Furthermore, the beach was the head of a narrow rock
cove, a quarter of a mile long, up which pent way the sea roared
and was subdued at the last to a gentle pulse of surf. Beyond the
mouth many detached rocks, meeting the full force of the
breakers, spouted foam and spray high in the air. The knees of
these rocks, seen between the surges, were black with mussels. On
their tops sprawled huge sea-lions tawny-wet and roaring in the
sun, while overhead, uttering shrill cries, darted and wheeled a
multitude of sea birds.
<P>
The last of the descent, from the barbed wire fence, was a
sliding fall of a dozen feet, and Saxon arrived on the soft dry
sand in a sitting posture.
<P>
"Oh, I tell you it's just great," Billy bubbled. "Look at it for
a camping spot. In among the trees there is the prettiest spring
you ever saw. An' look at all the good firewood, an'. .." He
gazed about and seaward with eyes that saw what no rush of words
could compass. "... An', an' everything. We could live here.
Look at the mussels out there. An' I bet you we could catch fish.
What d'ye say we stop a few days?--It's vacation anyway--an' I
could go back to Carmel for hooks an' lines."
<P>
Saxon, keenly appraising his glowing face, realized that he was
indeed being won from the city.
<P>
"An' there ain't no wind here," he was recommending. "Not a
breath. An' look how wild it is. Just as if we was a thousand
miles from anywhere."
<P>
The wind, which had been fresh and raw across the bare hills,
gained no entrance to the cove; and the beach was warm and balmy,
the air sweetly pungent with the thicket odors. Here and there,
in the midst of the thicket, severe small oak trees and other
small trees of which Saxon did not know the names. Her enthusiasm
now vied with Billy's, and, hand in hand, they started to
explore.
<P>
"Here's where we can play real Robinson Crusoe, " Billy
cried, as they crossed the hard sand from highwater mark to the
edge of the water. "Come on, Robinson. Let's stop over. Of
course, I'm your Man Friday, an' what you say goes."
<P>
"But what shall we do with Man Saturday!" She pointed in mock
consternation to a fresh footprint in the sand. "He may be a
savage cannibal, you know."
<P>
"No chance. It's not a bare foot but a tennis shoe."
<P>
"But a savage could get a tennis shoe from a drowned or eaten
sailor, couldn't hey" she contended.
<P>
"But sailors don't wear tennis shoes," was Billy's prompt
refutation.
<P>
"You know too much for Man Friday," she chided; "but, just the
same; if you'll fetch the packs we'll make camp. Besides, it
mightn't have been a sailor that was eaten. It might have been a
passenger."
<P>
By the end of an hour a snug camp was completed. The blankets
were spread, a supply of firewood was chopped from the seasoned
driftwood, and over a fire the coffee pot had begun to sing.
Saxon called to Billy, who was improvising a table from a
wave-washed plank. She pointed seaward. On the far point of
rocks, naked except for swimming trunks, stood a man. He was
gazing toward them, and they could see his long mop of dark hair
blown by the wind. As he started to climb the rocks landward
Billy eaUed Saxon's attention to the fact that the stranger wore
tennis shoes. In a few minutes he dropped down from the rock to
the beach and walked up to them.
<P>
"Gosh!" Billy whispered to Saxon. "He's lean enough, but look at
his muscles. Everybody down here seems to go in for physical
culture."
<P>
As the newcomer approached, Saxon glimpsed sufflcient of his face
to be reminded of the old pioneers and of a certain type of face
seen frequently among the old soldiers: Young though he was--not
more than thirty, she decided--this man had the same long and
narrow face, with the high cheekbones, high and slender forehead,
and nose high, lean, and almost beaked. The lips were thin and
sensitive; but the eyes were different from any she had ever seen
in pioneer or veteran or any man. They were so dark a gray that
they seemed brown, and there were a farness and alertness of
vision in them as of bright questing through profounds of space.
In a misty way Saxon felt that she had seen him before.
<P>
"Hello," he greeted. "You ought to be comfortable here." He threw
down a partly filled sack. "Mussels. All I could get. The tide's
not low enough yet."
<P>
Saxon heard Billy muffle an ejaculation, and saw painted on his
face the extremest astonishment.
<P>
"Well, honest to God, it does me proud to meet you," he blurted
out. "Shake hands. I always said if I laid eyes on you I'd
shake.--Say!"
<P>
But Billy's feelings mastered him, and, beginning with a choking
giggle, he roared into helpless mirth.
<P>
The stranger looked at him curiously across their clasped hands,
and glanced inquiringly to Saxon.
<P>
"You gotta excuse me," Billy gurgled, pumping the other's hand up
and down. "But I just gotta laugh. Why, honest to God, I've woke
up nights an' laughed an' gone to sleep again. Don't you
recognize 'm, Saxon? He's the same identical dude say, friend,
you're some punkins at a hundred yards dash, ain't you7"
<P>
And then, in a sudden rush, Saxon placed him. He it was who had
stood with Roy Blanchard alongside the automobile on the day she
had wandered, sick and unwitting, into strange neighborhoods. Nor
had that day been the first time she had seen him.
<P>
"Remember the Bricklayers' Picnic at Weasel Park7" Billy was
asking. "An' the foot race? Why, I'd know that nose of yours
anywhere among a million. You was the guy that stuck your cane
between Timothy McManus's legs an' started the grandest
roughhouse Weasel Park or any other park ever seen."
<P>
The visitor now commenced to laugh. He stood on one leg as he
laughed harder, then stood on the other leg. Finally he sat down
on a log of driftwood.
<P>
"And you were there," he managed to gasp to Billy at last. "You
saw it. You saw it." He turned to Saxon. "--And you?"
<P>
She nodded.
<P>
"Say," Billy began again, as their laughter eased down, "what I
wants know is what'd you wanta do it for. Say, what'd you wants
do it for? I've been askin' that to myeelf ever since."
<P>
"So have I," was the answer.
<P>
"You didn't know Timothy McManus, did you7"
<P>
"No; I'd never seen him before, and I've never seen him since."
<P>
"But what'd you wanta do it for?" Billy persisted.
<P>
The young man laughed, then controlled himself.
<P>
"To save my life, I don't know. I have one friend, a most
intelligent chap that writes sober, scientific books, and he's
always aching to throw an egg into an electric fan to see what
will happen.  Perhaps that's the way it was with me, except that
there was no aching. When I saw those legs flying past, I merely
stuck my stick in between. I didn't know I was going to do it. I
just did it. Timothy McManus was no more surprised than I was."
<P>
"Did they catch you?" Billy asked.
<P>
"Do I look as if they did? I was never so scared in my life.
Timothy McManus himself couldn't have caught me that day. But
what happened afterward? I heard they had a fearful roughhouse,
but I couldn't stop to see."
<P>
It was not until a quarter of an hour had passed, during which
Billy described the fight, that introductions took place. Mark
Hall was their visitor's name, and he lived in a bungalow among
the Carmel pines.
<P>
"But how did you ever find your way to Bierce's Cove?" he was
curious to know. "Nobody ever dreams of it from the road."
<P>
"So that's its name?" Saxon said.
<P>
"It's the name we gave it. One of our crowd camped here one
summer, and we named it after him. I'll take a cup of that
coffee, if you don't mind."--This to Saxon. "And then I'll show
your husband around. We're pretty proud of this cove. Nobody ever
comes here but ourselves."
<P>
"You didn't get all that muscle from bein' chased by McManus,"
Billy observed over the coffee.
<P>
"Massage under tension," was the cryptic reply.
<P>
"Yes," Billy said, pondering vacantly. "Do you eat it with a
spoon?"
<P>
Hall laughed.
<P>
"I'll show you. Take any muscle you want, tense it, then
manipulate it with your fingers, so, and so."
<P>
"An' that done all that'" Billy asked skeptically.
<P>
"All that!" the other scorned proudly. "For one muscle you see,
there's five tucked away but under command. Touch your finger to
any part of me and see."
<P>
Billy complied, touching the right breast.
<P>
"You know something about anatomy, picking a muscleless spot,"
scolded Hall.
<P>
Billy grinned triumphantly, then, to his amazement, saw a muscle
grow up under his finger. He prodded it, and found it hard and
honest.
<P>
"Massage under tension!" Hall exulted. "Go on--anywhere you
want."
<P>
And anywhere and everywhere Billy touched, muscles large and
small rose up, quivered, and sank down, till the whole body was a
ripple of willed quick.
<P>
"Never saw anything like it," Billy marveled at the end; "an'
I've seen some few good men stripped in my time. Why, you're all
living silk."
<P>
"Massage under tension did it, my friend. The doctors gave me up.
My friends called me the sick rat, and the mangy poet, and all
that. Then I quit the city, came down to Carmel, and went in for
the open air--and massage under tension."
<P>
"Jim Hazard didn't get his muscles that way," Billy challenged.
<P>
"Certainly not, the lucky skunk; he was born with them. Mine's
made. That's the difference. I'm a work of art. He's a cave bear.
Come along. I'll show you around now. You'd better get your
clothes off. Keep on only your shoes and pants, unless you've got
a pair of trunks."
<P>
"My mother was a poet," Saxon said, while Billy was getting
himself ready in the thicket. She had noted Hall's reference to
himself.
<P>
He seemed incurious, and she ventured further.
<P>
"Some of it was printed."
<P>
"What was her name?" he asked idly.
<P>
"Dayelle Wiley Brown. She wrote: 'The Viking's Quest';
'Days of Gold'; 'Constancy'; 'The Caballero'; 'Graves at
Little Meadow'; and a lot more. Ten of them are in 'The
Story of the Files.'"
<P>
"I've the book at home," he remarked, for the first time showing
real interest. "She was a pioneer, of course--before my time.
I'll look her up when I get back to the house. My people were
pioneers. They came by Panama, in the Fifties, from Long Island.
My father was a doctor, but he went into business in San
Francisco and robbed his fellow men out of enough to keep me and
the rest of a large family going ever since.--Say, where are you
and your husband bound?"
<P>
When Saxon had told him of their attempt to get away from Oakland
and of their quest for land, he sympathized with the first and
shook his head over the second.
<P>
"It's beautiful down beyond the Sur," he told her. "I've been all
over those redwood canyons, and the place is alive with game. The
government land is there, too. But you'd be foolish to settle.
It's too remote. And it isn't good farming land, except in
patches in the canyons. I know a Mexican there who is wild to
sell his five hundred acres for fifteen hundred dollars. Three
dollars an acre! And what does that mean? That it isn't worth
more. That it isn't worth so much; because he can find no takers.
Land, you know, is worth what they buy and sell it for."
<P>
Billy, emerging from the thicket, only in shoes and in pants
rolled to the knees, put an end to the conversation; and Saxon
watched the two men, physically so dissimilar, climb the rocks
and start out the south side of the cove. At first her eyes
followed them lazily, but soon she grew interested and
worried. Hall was leading Billy up what seemed a perpendicular
wall in order to gain the backbone of the rock. Billy went
slowly, displaying extreme caution; but twice she saw him slip,
the weather-eaten stone crumbling away in his hand and rattling
beneath him into the cove. When Hall reached the top, a hundred
feet above the sea, she saw him stand upright and sway easily on
the knife-edge which she knew fell away as abruptly on the other
side. Billy, once on top, contented himself with crouching on
hands and knees. The leader went on, upright, walking as easily
as on a level floor. Billy abandoned the hands and knees
position, but crouched closely and often helped himself with his
hands.
<P>
The knife-edge backbone was deeply serrated, and into one of the
notches both men disappeared. Saxon could not keep down her
anxiety, and climbed out on the north side of the cove, which was
less rugged and far less difficult to travel. Even so, the
unaccustomed height, the crumbling surface, and the fierce
buffets of the wind tried her nerve. Soon she was opposite the
men. They had leaped a narrow chasm and were scaling another
tooth. Already Billy was going more nimbly, but his leader often
paused and waited for him. The way grew severer, and several
times the clefts they essayed extended down to the ocean level
and spouted spray from the growling breakers that burst through.
At other times, standing erect, they would fall forward across
deep and narrow clefts until their palms met the opposing side;
then, clinging with their fingers, their bodies would be drawn
across and up.
<P>
Near the end, Hall and Billy went out of sight over the south
side of the backbone, and when Saxon saw them again they were
rounding the extreme point of rock and coming back on the cove
side. Here the way seemed barred. A wide fissure, with hopelessly
vertical sides, yawned skywards from a foam-white vortex where
the mad waters shot their level a dozen feet upward and dropped
it as abruptly to the black depths of battered rock and
writhing weed.
<P>
Clinging precariously, the men descended their side till the
spray was flying about them. Here they paused. Saxon could see
Hall pointing down across the fissure and imagined he was showing
some curious thing to Billy. She was not prepared for what
followed. The surf-level sucked and sank away, and across and
down Hall jumped to a narrow foothold where the wash had roared
yards deep the moment before. Without pause, as the returning sea
rushed up, he was around the sharp corner and clawing upward hand
and foot to escape being caught. Billy was now left alone. He
could not even see Hall, much less be further advised by him, and
so tensely did Saxon watch, that the pain in her finger-tips,
crushed to the rock by which she held, warned her to relax. Billy
waited his chance, twice made tentative preparations to leap and
sank back, then leaped across and down to the momentarily exposed
foothold, doubled the corner, and as he clawed up to join Hall
was washed to the waist but not torn away.
<P>
Saxon did not breathe easily till they rejoined her at the fire.
One glance at Billy told her that he was exceedingly disgusted
with himself.
<P>
"You'll do, for a beginner," Hall cried, slapping him jovially on
the bare shoulder. "That climb is a stunt of mine. Many's the
brave lad that's started with me and broken down before we were
half way out. I've had a dozen balk at that big jump. Only the
athletes make it."
<P>
"I ain't ashamed of admittin' I was scairt," Billy growled.
"You're a regular goat, an' you sure got my goat half a dozen
times. But I'm mad now. It's mostly trainin', an' I'm goin' to
camp right here an' train till I can challenge you to a race out
an' around an' back to the beach."
<P>
"Done," said Hall, putting out his hand in ratification. "And
some time, when we get together in San Francisco, I'll lead you
up against Bierce--the one this cove is named after. His favorite
stunt, when he isn't collecting rattlesnakes, is to wait for a
forty-mile-an-hour breeze, and then get up and walk on the
parapet of a skyscraper--on the lee side, mind you, so that if he
blows off there's nothing to fetch him up but the street. He
sprang that on me once."
<P>
"Did you do it!" Billy asked eagerly.
<P>
"I wouldn't have if I hadn't been on. I'd been practicing it
secretly for a week. And I got twenty dollars out of him on the
bet."
<P>
The tide was now low enough for mussel gathering and Saxon
accompanied the men out the north wall. Hall had several sacks to
fill. A rig was coming for him in the afternoon, he explained, to
cart the mussels back to Carmel. When the sacks were full they
ventured further among the rock crevices and were rewarded with
three abalones, among the shells of which Saxon found one coveted
blister-pearl. Hall initiated them into the mysteries of pounding
and preparing the abalone meat for cooking.
<P>
By this time it seemed to Saxon that they had known him a long
time. It reminded her of the old times when Bert had been with
them, singing his songs or ranting about the last of the
Mohicans.
<P>
"Now, listen; I'm going to teach you something," Hall commanded,
a large round rock poised in his hand above the abalone meat.
"You must never, never pound abalone without singing this song.
Nor must you sing this song at any other time. It would be the
rankest sacrilege. Abalone is the food of the gods. Its
preparation is a religious function. Now listen, and follow, and
remember that it is a very solemn occasion."
<P>
The stone came down with a thump on the white meat, and
thereafter arose and fell in a sort of tom-tom accompaniment to
the poet's song:
<P>
"Oh! some folks boast of quail on toast,
Because they think it's tony;
But I'm content to owe my rent
And live on abalone.
<P>
"Oh! Mission Point's a friendly joint
Where every crab's a crony,
And true and kind you'll ever find
The clinging abalone.
<P>
"He wanders free beside the sea
Where 'er the coast is stony;
He flaps his wings and madly sings--
The plaintive abalone.
<P>
"Some stick to biz, some flirt with Liz
Down on the sands of Coney;
But we, by hell, stay in Carmel,
And whang the abalone."
<P>
He paused with his mouth open and stone upraised. There was a
rattle of wheels and a voice calling from above where the sacks
of mussels had been carried. He brought the stone down with a
final thump and stood up.
<P>
"There's a thousand more verses like those," he said. "Sorry I
hadn't time to teach you them." He held out his hand, palm
downward. "And now, children, bless you, you are now members of
the clan of Abalone Eaters, and I solemnly enjoin you, never, no
matter what the circumstances, pound abalone meat without
chanting the sacred words I have revealed unto you."
<P>
"But we can't remember the words from only one hearing," Saxon
expostulated.
<P>
"That shall be attended to. Next Sunday the Tribe of Abalone
Eaters will descend upon you here in Bierce's Cove, and you will
be able to see the rites, the writers and writeresses, down even
to the Iron Man with the basilisk eyes, vulgarly known as the
King of the Sacerdotal Lizards."
<P>
"Will Jim Hazard come?" Billy called, as Hall disappeared into
the thicket.
<P>
"He will certainly come. Is he not the Cave-Bear Pot-Walloper and
Gridironer, the most fearsome, and, next to me, the most exalted,
of all the Abalone Eaters?"
<P>
Saxon and Billy could only look at each other till they heard the
wheels rattle away.
<P>
"Well, I'll be doggoned," Billy let out. "He's some boy, that.
Nothing stuck up about him. Just like Jim Hazard, comes along and
makes himself at home, you're as good as he is an' he's as good
as you, an' we're all friends together, just like that, right off
the bat."
<P>
"He's old stock, too," Saxon said. "He told me while you were
undressing. His folks came by Panama before the railroad was
built, and from what he said I guess he's got plenty of money."
<P>
"He sure don't act like it."
<P>
"And isn't he full of fun!" Saxon cried.
<P>
"A regular josher. An' HIM!--a POET!"
<P>
"Oh, I don't know, Billy. I've heard that plenty of poets are
odd."
<P>
"That's right, come to think of it. There's Joaquin Miller, lives
out in the hills back of Fruitvale. He's certainly odd. It's
right near his place where I proposed to you. Just the same I
thought poets wore whiskers and eyeglasses, an' never tripped up
foot-racers at Sunday picnics, nor run around with as few clothes
on as the law allows, gatherin' mussels an' climbin' like goats."
<P>
That night, under the blankets, Saxon lay awake, looking at the
stars, pleasuring in the balmy thicket-scents, and listening to
the dull rumble of the outer surf and the whispering ripples on
the sheltered beach a few feet away. Billy stirred, and she knew
he was not yet asleep.
<P>
"Glad you left Oakland, Billy?" she snuggled.
<P>
"Huh!" came his answer. "Is a clam happy?"
