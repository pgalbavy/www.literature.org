<p>“That’s the time I scared a dog!” said Blackie to herself, laughing.
For she had not hurt him, and she had stopped him from biting her,
which was a good thing. I suppose it would be nicer if dogs and cats
were more friendly, but they never seem to be that way――at least not
very often.
</p><p>Then Blackie saw something strange. Up on the stoop was what seemed to
be a little baby girl, lying down. The dog ran up to the baby and began
barking at her.
</p><p>“My goodness!” said Blackie. “He’ll bite the child, that dog will. That
must not be! I’ll stop him. I’m not afraid of him.”
</p><p>Up the stoop ran Blackie. The dog was barking so hard at the baby that
he did not see nor hear Blackie. She went close up behind him, and
cried, in cat and dog language:
</p><p>“Here, you let that little baby alone, if you please!”
</p><p>“What’s that? Are you talking to me?” asked the dog, as he began to
turn around, not knowing who was speaking to him.
</p><p>“Yes, I am,” answered Blackie. “Go on, now! Run away, and let the child
alone!”
</p><p>“I will not!” said the dog, and then he turned all the way around and
saw the big black cat. Up went Blackie’s back again, her tail grew as
large around as a big brush, and how she hissed! “_Zizz!_”
</p><p>“Oh, yow! Oh, wow!” howled the dog. “It’s that cat again! She’s after
me!”
</p><p>Away he ran, down off the stoop, and Blackie could not help laughing at
him, for she had not hurt him at all.
</p><p>“I guess I made him let that baby alone,” thought Blackie. “Don’t be
afraid, little one,” said Blackie, though she knew, of course, that no
child could understand cat-talk.
</p><p>And then, to her surprise, Blackie saw that it was not a live baby at
all, but a large doll, such as Mabel used to play with.
</p><p>“Well did you ever!” exclaimed Blackie. “I thought it was a real child!
It looks so natural. What will that dog think of me, taking a doll for
a baby? He must be laughing at me.”
</p><p>But the dog was too frightened then to laugh, though later on, when
Blackie had gone, the dog came out from under the stoop where he had
gone to hide and as he looked at the doll, which lay where the little
girl-mother had dropped it, that dog said:
</p><p>“Huh! That cat thought she was smart, driving me away because I was
barking at a doll! I wouldn’t hurt it!”
</p><p>As Blackie stood on the stoop, looking at the doll, the door opened and
a little girl came out.
</p><p>“Oh, you nice, big, black cat!” exclaimed the little girl. “Did you
come up on the stoop to look at my dollie?”
</p><p>Of course Blackie could not tell <u>why</u> she had come up on the stoop,
for the cat could not speak girl-language. But Blackie mewed, and
rubbed up against the little girl’s legs, purring, for the little girl
was almost like Mabel, and quite as nice.
</p><p>“Oh, I just love you, Pussy,” said the little girl. “I’m going to get
you a saucer of milk.” And she did, still leaving her doll on the
stoop. But the doll did not seem to mind.
</p><p>“There you are, nice, black cat,” the little girl said, as she came out
with the milk. “I guess you are thirsty.”
</p><p>And Blackie was. She drank up all the milk, and wished there was more.
She felt much better after that. The little girl watched the cat
drinking the milk and said:
</p><p>“I’m going in and ask my mother if I can keep you for my own, black
pussy. You’re alive, and I like you better than my doll, though she is
nice too.”
</p><p>Into the house hurried the little girl, leaving her doll on the stoop
with Blackie. But the black cat, though she liked the little girl, did
not want to stay and live in that house.
</p><p>“I want to go on to my <u>own</u> home,” thought Blackie. “I want Mabel and
Arthur. Besides, if I lived here that dog and I would be always having
trouble, I’m afraid. He is not like Don. I’m going to travel on.”
</p><p>And while the little girl was in the house, asking her mother if she
could keep the cat, Blackie ran down the stoop, laughing in her own
way, as she looked at the doll, and thought how she had mistaken it for
a baby.
</p><p>The dog came out from under the stoop where he had run to get away from
Blackie and he was up beside the doll again when the little girl came
out once more.
</p><p>“Oh, where is that nice black cat?” asked the little girl, looking all
around. “Where is he, Fido? Mother said I might keep her, but she is
gone. Do you know where she is?”
</p><p>“Bow wow!” barked Fido. “I’m glad she is gone. I don’t like her, for
she scared me. I’m glad she isn’t going to live here.”
</p><p>Of course the little girl did not know that her dog Fido said that, but
he really did. She was sorry, the little girl was, that the cat had
gone away. But it was best in the end, for I suppose Blackie and the
dog would not have gotten along well together.
</p><p>Down the street trotted the black cat, feeling not so hungry now. But
she was still far from home, and she did not know when she would find
the place where she used to live so very happily.
</p><p>“I’ll never run away again,” Blackie said. “I’ve had enough of it.
I have had adventures, it is true, and I am a good deal better
fence-jumper than I used to be, but I have had a hard time of it. I
will have many things to tell Speckle when I see him. And I wish I
could see him right now, for then I would be home.”
</p><p>The next day when Blackie was traveling through a woods, and hoping
that on the other side of it she might find the city where her house
was, she saw a funny animal hopping along over the dried leaves. The
animal looked like a cat, for it had fur, only it was white instead of
black. And the animal had pink eyes and a pink nose.
</p><p>“How do you do?” asked Blackie politely, for she saw that the animal
was not going to hurt her.
</p><p>“I am pretty well,” answered the white animal. “How are you and what is
your name?”
</p><p>“Well, I’ve seen the time I felt better,” answered Blackie, and she
told her name, and mentioned that she was a cat.
</p><p>“Oh, a cat; eh?” exclaimed the white animal. “Well, I’m a rabbit, and
my name is Flop Ear. They call me that because one ear flops or falls
over, see.”
</p><p>Flop Ear stood up on his hind legs, as easily as Dido, the dancing
bear, could have done, and while one of his ears stood up straight the
other one sort of leaned over, or flopped.
</p><p>“Oh, I see how it is,” spoke Blackie, laughing, for Flop Ear was a
funny little rabbit. “Do you live here in these woods?”
</p><p>“Yes, with my father and mother, and some brothers and sisters and also
Lady Munch.”
</p><p>“Lady Munch?” exclaimed Blackie. “Who is she?”
</p><p>“She is my grandmother,” answered Flop Ear. “And we all like her very
much. But excuse me, I must hurry on.”
</p><p>“Where are you going?” asked Blackie.
</p><p>“Over in the field to get some carrots for dinner. Do you like carrots?”
</p><p>“I never ate any,” Blackie answered. “I’m a cat, you know.”
</p><p>“That’s so, I forgot about that,” spoke Flop Ear. “I was told never to
play with cats or dogs, as they might bite me.”
</p><p>“I’d never bite you,” said Blackie. “I think you are very nice, and
your fur is like mine. I’ll go along with you and help you get the
carrots, if you want me to, though I don’t eat them.”
</p><p>“What do you eat?” asked Flop Ear, as he hopped along beside Blackie.
</p><p>“Oh, meat and milk, and fish, when I can get them.”
</p><p>“Why can’t you get them now?” the white rabbit wanted to know.
</p><p>“Because I am a lost cat,” answered Blackie. “I ran away from home, you
see, to have adventures, and to learn to become a good fence-jumper,
but it is not so easy to get things to eat when you are lost.”
</p><p>“I am sorry for you,” said the white rabbit. “I never was lost and I am
never going to run away from home.”
</p><p>“You do not need to learn to jump,” Blackie told Flop Ear, “for you are
a good jumper now.”
</p><p>“Yes, all rabbits are good jumpers,” spoke Flop Ear, “but I never tried
to jump over a fence. And I am never, never going to leave my home.”
</p><p>“No, don’t,” advised Blackie.
</p><p>But you just wait and read, in the next book after this, what happened
to Flop Ear.
</p><p>Soon Blackie and Flop Ear came to the field where the carrots grew. The
white rabbit nibbled one, and told the cat to taste. Blackie did, but
said:
</p><p>“Oh, I don’t like carrots. They might be good if cooked in milk, but I
do not like them raw.”
</p><p>“That’s queer,” replied Flop Ear. “They are best raw, _I_ think.”
</p><p>The rabbit and the cat talked together a little longer, and then
Blackie said she thought she had better travel on, and try to find her
home.
</p><p>“For I am tired of being a lost cat,” sighed Blackie.
</p><p>That night Blackie slept in a field under a pile of hay. There were
some little mice who had made a nest there too, but Blackie did not
touch them, though she liked to eat mice.
</p><p>But for her supper that night Blackie had found a piece of meat in
front of a butcher shop, and as she had eaten that she was not hungry.
So she let the little mice alone, and I guess they were happy about
that.
</p><p>But oh! how lonesome Blackie was for her own home! She thought about it
very often that night as she cuddled down in the hay.
</p><p>“If I don’t find my home before Winter I don’t know what I shall do,”
thought Blackie. “It isn’t so bad sleeping out in Summer, but in the
Winter it is going to be dreadful! I simply must find my home.”
</p><p>For two days more Blackie traveled on. She came out of the woods, she
left the fields, and then she found herself in a city. She walked
through the streets. Sometimes boys would chase her, or throw stones at
her, and sometimes dogs would run after her. Once or twice Blackie had
to go up a tree to get away.
</p><p>And then, one day, Blackie found herself on a street that she seemed
to know. She looked up at the houses, hardly believing it at first,
and then she saw that she was really right on the street where she had
lived.
</p><p>“Oh, why! I do believe I’m back in my own city again!” said the
delighted Blackie to herself. “Yes, I know these houses, and there is
the one I live in! Oh, how glad I am!”
</p><p>Blackie ran up the front steps. But, somehow or other the house did
not seem to be the same as when Blackie had lived there. The stoop was
covered with dust, and it was never that way as long as Blackie could
remember, for Mabel used to sweep it off every morning.
</p><p>“This is queer,” said Blackie. “I’ll go around to the back.”
</p><p>The back door was closed, and so were the windows. Blackie ran all the
way around the house, mewing. No one came out to let her in.
</p><p>Blackie looked up at all the windows. They were closed down, and the
shades were drawn.
</p><p>“Why――why the family must have moved away!” thought Blackie, and she
was very sad. “Oh, dear! After my long journey, and my many adventures,
to get home and find the house locked up and the family gone! Oh, isn’t
it too bad! What shall I do?”
</p><p>Blackie was very sad. She felt all tired out and lonesome. She would
have cried real tears had she been a little girl or boy, I guess. But,
being only a cat, she could do nothing but mew.
