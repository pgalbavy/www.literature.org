<p>The task which Jack Carleton took upon himself, when he parted
company with Otto Relstaub on the clearing, was of the simplest
nature, and one which he was confident could be accomplished without
trouble; it was to reach by a circuitous course a point directly
opposite to his friend, and on a line with the horse, so that
if the latter fled from one, he could be secured by the other.</p>

<p>The experience of the young Kentuckian averted some mistakes
into which others might have fallen.  One of the hardest things
for a hunter to do, while tramping the forest, is to keep his
bearings. There are few who have shouldered a gun that have not
learned this fact, and, without a compass, landmarks, the bark
of trees, or some other artificial aid, it may be set down as
impossible for any one to escape bewilderment.  If his wanderings
are extended he will find himself traveling in a circle, and instances
are known in which a person has followed his own trail for hours,
without suspecting the grotesque truth.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton therefore took every precaution against going astray.
He had in fact but one landmark, so to speak, and that was the
moon, then well up in the sky.  He located the luminary with such
exactness, that he knew it would be directly over his right shoulder
when he arrived at a point precisely opposite his friend, and,
as he hoped, in a straight line with the colt between them.</p>

<p>"That means good luck," said he to himself, with a smile; "I
always like to see the moon over my right shoulder, though it
can't mean anything after all, as mother has told me many a time. 
She said that she and father, a few nights before he was killed
by the Shawanoes, watched the new moon, which shone through the
window, over his right shoulder and on my bare head.  Father was
in good spirits, for he believed in signs, and I think mother,
though she chided him, had a sly belief in them, too; but," added
the boy with a sigh, "she shudders now at the mere mention of
such a thing."</p>

<p>While Jack was indulging in this sad reminiscence, he was carefully
picking his way among the trees, making sure that he did not get
the points of the compass confused.  There was no call for haste,
and it may be said he felt every step of the way.</p>

<p>"Otto is an odd fellow," he muttered, allowing his fancy to stray
whither it chose, "and I hope he won't become bewildered.  He
is so anxious to get the colt, that he will run into trouble if
there's any into which he can run.  He is shrewd, brave, and somewhat
stupid, and it is never certain what he will do or say.  Let me
see."</p>

<p>He stood still, and, peeping at the moon, as beat he could through
the foliage overhead, studied its position in the heavens, with
particular reference to his own.</p>

<p>"I haven't reached the right spot yet; it must be a hundred yards
further."</p>

<p>His aim was to halt some twenty or thirty rods beyond the clearing.
Then, when assured he had gone far enough, he would walk directly
toward Otto, the two keeping the horse between them.</p>

<p>"I do so hope we will get him," muttered Jack, beginning to feel
a misgiving now that the decisive moment was at hand, "for if
we fail it will end the business.  If he goes home without the
colt, his father will beat him, and more than likely will drive
him into the woods and forbid him to come back till he brings
the horse with him. He is such a hard-hearted, miserly old fellow,
that he will accept no excuse from Otto, and his mother doesn't
seem to be much better."</p>

<p>After a time Jack reached the point where he found the moonlight
streaming over his right shoulder.  Of course, he could have secured
that lucky omen at any time, but it resulted now from the systematic
course he had followed, and he was sure no mistake had been made.</p>

<p>He had no more than formed the conclusion that everything was
as it should be, when he was surprised to hear the neigh of a
horse within bowshot of where he stood.  As it came from the direction
of the clearing, no doubt remained that it was the animal for
which he was hunting.</p>

<p>"It looks as if it is to be my fortune after all to recover the
colt," thought the pleased lad.  "It will be a surprise to Otto,
but I hope we shall not have to wait any longer, for we have lost
a good deal of time."</p>

<p>He moved through the wood, stepping softly, so as not to frighten
the animal, which probably had had enough of liberty to be unwilling
to go back to bondage.</p>

<p>A brief distance was passed, when the young Kentuckian caught
sight of the stray steed.  In an opening, less than a tenth of
an acre, where there was an abundance of grass, stood the identical
colt which ran away the day before.  Saddle and bridle were still
in place, though even the moonlight was sufficient to show they
had suffered much from the journey of the horse.  The latter,
evidently was suspicious that something was amiss.  He was cropping
the grass, when the sound of Jack's footsteps alarmed him.  He
stood with his head up, the grass dripping like water from his
mouth, while he listened for the cause of alarm.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was well aware of the difficulty that faced him
when on the very threshold of success.  Though he was close to
the animal, he was not yet secured.</p>

<p>"Ah!  If Deerfoot was here," sighed the boy, "then there would
be no doubt of the result, for he would dart forward and catch
him.  If the horse wanted to run away, he would let him do it,
and then the Shawanoe would chase him down, just as easily as
he would me or Otto; but it is going to be hard work for me."</p>

<p>It was difficult to decide on the best course of procedure. 
The sagacious creature would not only be quick to recognize Jack,
but equally quick to understand his purpose in approaching him. 
It was too much to expect him to submit quietly to recapture.</p>

<p>Jack softly plucked a handful of grass, and, stepping out from
the cover of the woods began moving gently toward the colt.  The
latter turned his head and uttered a sniff of inquiry, at the
same time showing an inclination to whirl about and gallop off. 
The boy stood still and, holding out the grass, deftly manipulated
it so that a part dropped loosely to the ground: this insured
its notice by his victim.  Jack also addressed him in his most
soothing tones.  He called him all the pet names at his command,
and, as the steed still held his ground, the youth resumed his
stealthy advance.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton's heart throbbed with hope.  The animal threw his
head higher, snuffed louder, and manifestly was hesitating whether
to permit a closer approach before fleeing, or whether to turn
his face at once from temptation.</p>

<p>"A few steps more and he is mine," was the thought of Jack, who
repeated the pet names with greater ardor, interspersing them
with a variation of cluckings and chirpings that would have charmed
a prattling baby.  He increased his pace, for he was almost within
reach, while the beast snorted with excitement.</p>

<p>All at once Jack dropped the gun in his other hand, and made
a desperate plunge, meaning to grasp the forelock of the horse. 
It may be said that he succeeded, for he felt the coarse, cool
hair as it was swept through his fingers by the flirt of the animal's
head. Jack missed success, by what may be truly said to have been
a hair's breadth.</p>

<p>"Whoa! confound you!"</p>

<p>This command was uttered in a very different tone from that in
which he had been addressing the colt a minute before.  There
was nothing soothing in it, and the animal showed his contempt
by whirling about, kicking up his heels and dashing into the woods.</p>

<p>Jack snatched his gun from the ground and bounded after him at
the imminent risk of breaking his neck.  He was too far from Otto
and his captor to attract attention, but the noise may have reached
the ears of the Indian.  The angered pursuer did not coax or order
the colt, for what he had done in that line was sufficient to
show the effort was thrown away.</p>

<p>He listened: the animal was still going at a rate which showed
he believed the danger was at his heels.  The sound he made, while
galloping over the leaves and through the bushes, grew fainter
and fainter until it died out altogether.</p>

<p>"I suppose he will keep it up for several hours.  If he faces
toward the settlement, he will reach it to-morrow, but if he veers
to the right or left, Otto may as well give up the job."</p>

<p>Jack was keenly disappointed, for he had been confident of success,
and now he was forced to admit there was scarcely a hope of ever
seeing the colt again.</p>

<p>"It's a bad go," he said, turning about and moving toward the
clearing, where he had left his friend; "we'll keep up the hunt
to-morrow, but if he isn't caught before sundown, I shall insist
that we go home.  Mother's anxious to see me," he added, in a
softer voice, "but no more than I am to see her.  It has been
weeks since we parted, and if anything should happen to her while
I am loitering by the way, I can never forgive myself."</p>

<p>He did not reflect that he was exposed to tenfold more harm than
his parent.  He reproached himself that he had tarried in Coatesville
until Otto came for him.  He was ready and waiting several days,
during which he could have made the journey on foot, without the
guidance of his friend.</p>

<p>However, it was too late now for regrets, and he tried to take
matters philosophically.</p>

<p>The young Kentuckian made certain he was steadily pursuing the
right course, and, when he thought he had advanced far enough,
he emitted the whistle agreed upon.  Of course no reply came back,
for, as the reader knows, the young Teuton for whom the signal
was meant was not in a situation to make suitable answer.  In
fact it did not reach his ears at all.</p>

<p>Without losing any more minutes, Jack Carleton pushed forward,
until he was brought to a stand-still by catching the unmistakable
glimmer of a light a short distance ahead among the trees.</p>
