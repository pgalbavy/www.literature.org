<p><em>THE </em>person referred to in the preceding chapter as the
Frontier Angel, had received that appellation from the scouts
and rangers who had known her for several years. We say had known
her, but beyond the mere fact of her existence, nothing was known.
Who she was or where she had come from was a mystery to all. She
was ever painted and dressed in the fantastic costume of an Indian,
but many supposed her to be a white person, and gave as a reason
that her language was precisely the same as that used by themselves.
She discarded entirely the extravagant, high-flown figures so
much in vogue among the North American Indians, and which often
renders their meaning unintelligible to ordinary persons. She
was always alone, and rarely if ever seen in the daytime. The
whole object of her life seemed to be that of befriending the
settlers. More than once her timely warning had saved scores of
whites from the fury of the savages. Sometimes she would make
her appearance among the settlements in the Sciota Valley, and
after giving full intelligence of the movements of their enemies,
would take her departure; and the next that would be heard of
her, would be that she had performed a similar office for the
villages further east. She became known to all the rangers, nearly
all of whom regarded her not as either a white person or an Indian,
but as a spirit&mdash;an angel; and it was thus that she had gained
the name that we have mentioned. These hardy, but superstitious
beings, reverenced her as something far above them, whose touch
would be instant death. Lewis Whetzel, the most famous of the
four celebrated brothers, was the one who, to his dying day, carried
out the very letter of the vow he had made, never to let any treaty,
flag of truce, or any imaginable pretense, screen an Indian from
his vengeance. This terrible resolution he had made for the inhuman
butchery of his parents when a mere boy by the savages. The case
is familiar to all, of his having associated with Veach Dickerson,
and killed an Indian in the face of the proclamation issued by
General Harmar, that all hostilities should cease for a few days
in order to negotiate with them. The reward offered by Harmar
for his apprehension, his capture, and subsequent escape to the
woods again, could not induce him to abate one tittle of his unceasing
hostility. It is said that this terrible Lew Whetzel once encountered
the Frontier Angel in the forest, and, for the first and only
time in his life, broke his vow. In relating the incident afterward,
he said that he felt as if he raised his rifle, one look from
her eyes would have struck him dead.</p>

<p>It was thus that the mysterious Frontier Angel was regarded by
those who held communication with her; it was no wonder that Dingle
felt some trepidation, and he hastened down, unbarred the massive
gate, and saw her standing beside him.</p>

<p>"What news have you to-night?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have much news; but why have you remained at home so long?"</p>

<p>"I've no reason, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"Then hasten to the woods again, for there is much for you to
see."</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me the fuss?"</p>

<p>"I know not it all, but the Shawnees and Wyandots are making
great preparations for taking the war-path."</p>

<p>"Is their idee to come hyerabouts?"</p>

<p>"I cannot tell; it may be, and it may be not."</p>

<p>"Whar' am they kickin' up this muss?"</p>

<p>"At Piqua."</p>

<p>"Yas; wal, I'll pay them a visit. Anything more?"</p>

<p>"That is all. I will now depart."</p>

<p>Dingle unbarred the gate, allowed her to pass out, and after
securing it, made his way back to the block-house again. As he
passed out on the platform, Jenkins demanded:</p>

<p>"Who is that you was talking with?"</p>

<p>"A gal that comes down to see me once in a while."</p>

<p>"An Injin?"</p>

<p>"A half-breed&mdash;splendid critter."</p>

<p>"Jerusalem! she looked purty. What in the name of all that's
human made she shoot that arrer at me?"</p>

<p>"To kill yer, in course."</p>

<p>"To kill me! What did she want to kill me for? I'm sure I never
done her any harm."</p>

<p>"She thought you'd jist come out to show yerself and try and
cut me out. It made her all-fired mad."</p>

<p>"Did you tell her about it."</p>

<p>"Yas; but I can't tell you what she said. I'm goin' in to sleep
now. Don't whistle so loud, nor slap your hoofs down so, nor git
to talkin' how mean Dick Dingle is, or he might come out and make
you shut up."</p>

<p>With these words, the ranger opened the door of the block-house
and entered, leaving Jenkins completely dumbfounded at what he
had said.</p>

<p>"By George! how did he know what I said? I'll bet that infernal
Injin gal is down there yet, and waiting for a chance to shoot.
I'll kill her, if she tries it, just as sure as I live. She'll
wish she never knowed anything of Pete Jenkins."</p>

<p>But no attempt was made upon the sentinel's life, and when the
morning dawned, the forest and river wore their usual appearance.</p>

<p>In the morning. Dingle imparted the message of the Frontier Angel
to the commander of the post, and offered to visit the Piqua village
and ascertain the meaning of their movements.</p>

<p>"If she says there is mischief afoot, you may depend that there
is. Yes, Dingle, you had better go. Take who you please, find
out what you can, and get back as soon as possible."</p>

<p>The visit of this strange being was only a night or two after
the interview between Abbot and Peterson, so that the latter had
not yet started upon his hunt after the renegade McGable. Upon
consulting with Dingle, it was argued between them that, as there
was no need of hurrying in such a matter, they would defer their
expedition until after their return from Piqua. The safety of
the settlement was paramount to all other considerations. Besides,
it was very probable that the renegade was in the village named,
and they were just as likely to accomplish the object of both
their journeys at the same time. The two rangers held a long consultation,
and the conclusion they came to took all by surprise. It was that
Peterson should visit the Shawnee town in Paint Creek valley,
while Dingle, in company with the redoubtable Jenkins, would reconnoiter
Piqua. There was wisdom in this plan certainly, but many thought
it singular that the two should separate, when they had never
been known to do such a thing before when in service.</p>

<p>The Shawnees were the great enemy of the whites, and to them
may be traced nearly all of the long and bloody wars on the frontier.
They were a vindictive, revengeful, "restless people, delighting
in wars." Their very name, as has been remarked, was a word of
terror or of execration to the early settlers among the canebrakes
of Kentucky or upon the rich bottoms of Ohio.</p>

<p>When this country was discovered, the Shawnees occupied the southern
part of Georgia and Florida. Here they, at last, became so obnoxious
to the other Indians by their continual murders and robberies,
that a combination of the most powerful tribes&mdash;the Choctaws,
Cherokees, and Creeks, was effected, and perpetual, unceasing
war was declared against them. Finding the country too hot to
hold them, the Shawnees emigrated north, settling on the Ohio
and its tributaries. The Wyandots welcomed them, and they increased
to a mighty and powerful nation, retaining their characteristic
traits. From the commencement of the old French war, in 1755,
down to the final struggle between Tecumseh and the whites, nearly
sixty years after, they were continually engaged in some murderous
foray, interrupted only by a dozen years of quiet, succeeding
the treaty of Wayne.</p>

<p>Like all large Indian nations, the Shawnees were subdivided into
tribes, and these subdivided into families. The names of but four
of these tribes are now known: The Piqua, Kiskapocoke, Chillicothe,
and Mequachake. Piqua, in the Indian tongue, means a <em>man rising
from the ashes</em>, and there is a tradition among them, that
it was thus this division originated.</p>

<p>They had a large village at the head of Massie's Creek, a short
distance north of where Xenia now stands, and another named Piqua,
on Mad River, a few miles below Springfield. Their principal headquarters
were in the valley of Paint creek and Sciota river.</p>

<p>The simple preparations of the scouts were made, and it was agreed
they should start in a few hours upon their perilous journey.</p>
