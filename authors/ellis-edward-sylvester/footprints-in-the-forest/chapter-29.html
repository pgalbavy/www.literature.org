<p>That which Otto had called a cave proved really no cave at all.
Up the winding ascent the fugitives sped, until opposite a lip
or shelf, which projected from the rocks on their left. It extended
forward three or four feet, rudely sloping away like the forepiece
of a cap, but the concavity below was less than half that depth.
Jack expected to find a retreat ten or fifteen feet deep. As it
was, there was barely room to screen themselves from the flying
bullets, and had the rain been driven from the opposite direction
when Otto first sought refuge there it would have given no protection
at all.</p>

<p>Jack was half disposed to continue his flight over the ridge,
but fearful of the greater peril to which they would be exposed,
and alarmed by the knowledge that their enemies were almost on
their heels, he darted to the left, and stood with his back against
the rocky wall, grasping his loaded and cocked rifle, ready to
fire on appearance of the pursuers. Otto did the same, and, taking
a position beside him, began reloading his weapon.</p>

<p>The hostiles did not stop, but hastened up the rough gorge, and
in a twinkling the foremost dashed into sight. Quick as Jack was
in bringing his gun to his shoulder, some one else anticipated
him. The red man bounded high in air, with the inevitable death
shriek, and went over backward, his body pierced clean through
with an arrow driven with resistless force from the bow of Deerfoot,
the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>This checked the rush of the other two, who found, what they
ought to have known before, that the "Evil One" was on hand. They
turned and ran at break-neck speed down the slope, vanishing with
a swiftness that rendered it almost impossible for Deerfoot to
bring down either of them had he been so disposed. Rapid as was
their charge up the slope, their descent was a great deal more
rapid.</p>

<p>Directly behind the arrow came Deerfoot, landing in the presence
of the youths with such suddenness that Jack half raised his gun
under the belief that he was an enemy.</p>

<p>Otto was so startled that he spilled the powder he was pouring
into the barrel of his rifle, and the young Shawanoe smiled and
said:</p>

<p>"My brother is not glad to see Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"I ishn't! you shust waits till I gots dis gun loaded."</p>

<p>Working rapidly, he soon had the charge rammed home and the weapon
primed for action. Then, leaning it against the wall, he impulsively
threw his arms around the neck of the Shawanoe and kissed him
on the cheek.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was horrified, supposing the young warrior would
be offended, but he smiled in a way which showed he was pleased
with the honest fellow, who was not ashamed to show the affection
he felt.</p>

<p>During the brief moments spent in pleasant interchange, Deerfoot
was never quiet. His eyes were continually flitting hither and
thither, and he glanced right and left, as though expecting some
person or the occurrence of some event. The fact was, that, although
the Indians who made the rash attack had fled, the Shawanoe was
by no means satisfied. He reflected, that while only the four
warriors had been seen, it was more than likely that others were
within call.</p>

<p>There was no good reason for tarrying on the slope, and, as soon
as Otto had finished loading his gun, Deerfoot signified they
were to leave. For a brief spell nothing was to be feared from
the panic-smitten Indians, but the Shawanoe glanced furtively
down the gorge before leaving the partial shelter of the excavation
in the rocks. Then they moved hastily to the top of the ridge,
where a stop was made until all could take a survey of the surrounding
country. This was an important matter, and Deerfoot did it in
his usual thorough fashion, his eyes taking in the whole horizon.</p>

<p>The elevation of the ridge, and the sparse vegetation on the
crest, gave the Shawanoe the best kind of an observatory, and
he gained an extensive knowledge of the vast expanse of surrounding
country.</p>

<p>Looking toward the south-east, the three saw a somewhat similar
ridge, though less in extent. It seemed more than ten miles distant,
and the attention with which Deerfoot regarded it showed that
he was meditating some scheme in connection with it. It took him
but a minute or two to form a conclusion. Then he scrutinized
the territory in the opposite direction. Toward that point he
was looking for enemies: it was there the Pawnee party was in
camp or hunting back and forth.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was able to trace the river, on the other shore of which
had been kindled the camp-fire of the Pawnees, but he could discover
nothing of the warriors themselves. More than likely some of them
identified the little party on the slope, and took good care to
keep themselves out of sight.</p>

<p>Both Jack and Otto wondered at the absence of Hay-uta, the Sauk.
He had been absent much longer than Deerfoot, and the report of
guns and shouts of the Pawnees must have told him the same story
which brought the Shawanoe in such haste to the spot.</p>

<p>Once more Deerfoot faced the distant ridge in the south-east
Pointing toward it, he said:</p>

<p>"Let my brothers make haste thither, and wait for the coming
of Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked Jack; "why don't you go with us?"</p>

<p>"The Pawnees are on our trail; they will follow fast; my brothers
must make haste while Hay-uta and Deerfoot tarry."</p>

<p>A few words made clear the plan of Deerfoot. The Pawnees, like
all their race, were extremely revengeful in their disposition,
and they would never consent that the four intruders should be
allowed to go back without punishment. They had slain several
of their warriors, without receiving any injury in return. What
though the Evil One, in the guise of a young Shawanoe, had charge
of the little party, neither he nor they were invulnerable, and
the well-aimed bullet must be more effective than the arrow of
the matchless archer Deerfoot.</p>

<p>An additional incentive to pursuit lay in the fact that the Pawnees
had learned of the trick that Otto Relstaub played on them. His
presence in his own flesh and blood was evidence that could not
be disputed. These and other considerations, which it is not necessary
to give in detail, convinced Deerfoot that a sharp pursuit would
be made by the hostiles. Such a pursuit would be pushed at a pace
which neither of the pale-faced youths could equal; they were
certain to be overtaken unless skillful strategy was employed.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, therefore, directed the boys to make for the ridge
which he pointed out in the south-east. He told them to use all
haste and reach it at the earliest possible moment. It was probable
they could not do so before dark, but he impressed upon them the
duty of making no halt until their arrival there. If darkness
overtook them while several miles away in the woods, they must
push on. Both, and especially the young Kentuckian, had had enough
experience to know how to maintain a straight course when the
sun was not shining.</p>

<p>Deerfoot expected to join them before daylight, but in the event
of his failing to do so, they were forbidden to wait for him.
At the earliest dawn, they were to press their flight, and keep
it up to the utmost limit until nightfall. If by that time no
further molestation resulted, they might consider all danger ended,
so far as that particular party of Pawnees was concerned.</p>

<p>Deerfoot instructed the two friends to resort to every expedient
to hide their trail. When they reached a stream, they were never
to cross it by a direct line, but, if possible, wade a considerable
distance before stepping out on the other bank. If they should
find their path crossed by any thing in the nature of a river,
they were to make a raft and float a long distance with the current,
before resting their feet again on dry land.</p>

<p>It followed, as a matter of course, that all this strategy designed
to throw the hostiles off the trail, ought to be equally effective
against Sauk and Shawanoe; but the latter made necessary provisions
against going astray. He had a clear understanding with Jack as
to the distance he was to follow a small stream before leaving
it on the other side, and, in case a river was reached, it was
agreed that the youths were to drift downward a half mile. Then,
when they emerged, a sign was to be left in the shape of a broken
limb, dipping in the current. Such evidence would be detected
at once by the Shawanoe from the opposite side of the bank&mdash;that
is, if he had the daylight to assist him, and he could easily
arrange <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>The sagacity of Deerfoot enabled him to provide against almost
every contingency, and the time which he took in making such provision
was but a fraction of that which I have consumed in the telling.
Within three minutes after he directed them what they were to
do, they were traveling down the slope, with their faces toward
the distant ridge, and their feet carrying them rapidly in that
direction.</p>

<p>Each of the boys understood the scheme of Deerfoot, and lost
no time in speculating over its final issue. In fact the rule
of invariable success seemed to apply so forcibly to every thing
which he undertook that I am warranted in saying that neither
felt any fear when he left the ridge and plunged into the forest
stretching so many miles beyond.</p>

<p>"You have never seen Hay-uta," said Jack, after they had walked
some ways, the Kentuckian taking the lead.</p>

<p>"No," replied Otto, walking faster than was his custom.</p>

<p>"He is a Sauk, and one of the five who went off with you when
we parted from each other."</p>

<p>"Den I dinks I seen him," was the natural remark of the grinning
German.</p>

<p>"Of course you have seen him very often, as he has seen you,
but you never heard his name Hay-uta, and won't recognize him
from any description I give you."</p>

<p>"Why not?" queried his companion.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," replied Jack with a laugh, "that all negro
babies and all Indian warriors look so much alike that no one
can describe the difference. I have seen a great many Sauks, but
it was hard work to tell them apart when they were a little ways
off. Some of them were so hideous that they could be identified
by their appearance, as others could by the scars on their features
or the particular style they had of painting their faces."</p>

<p>Otto naturally wanted to know how it was that a Sauk had come
to be the ally of a Shawanoe, and why, when Hay-uta was any thing
but a friend of Otto, he should travel so far and run into so
much danger for the sake of rescuing him.</p>

<p>You and I know the explanation, and so it is not required that
I should repeat the story of Hay-uta's encounter with Deerfoot
in the depths of the wilderness, when the Shawanoe vanquished
the warrior, overcoming not only his physical prowess but his
hatred, and how the words fitly spoken at that time had proven
to be seed sowed on good ground which was already springing up
and bearing fruit.</p>

<p>The boys became so interested in the subject that they involuntarily
slackened their gait, while they discussed the incident and recalled
the gentle reproofs which Deerfoot had given them more than once.
It is at such times that we feel the prickings of conscience,
and both Otto and Jack asked themselves the question: If this
American Indian, born and nursed as a heathen, was so quick to
grasp the Word, what excuse shall we offer in the last day when
God shall demand of us why, with a hundred fold more light, we
persisted in rejecting him?</p>
