<p>Chatterer, still running for his life and without the least hope,
suddenly saw a last chance to escape from Shadow the Weasel. That
is, he saw something that might offer him a chance. He couldn't
be sure until he had tried, and even then he might escape from
one danger only to run right into another equally great. What
Chatterer saw was a big brown bunch near the top of a tall chestnut-tree,
and he headed for that tree as fast as ever he could go. What
was that big brown bunch? Why it was Redtail the Hawk, who was
dozing there with his head drawn down between his shoulders dreaming.</p>

<p>Now old Redtail is one of Chatterer's deadliest enemies. He is
quite as fond of Red Squirrel as is Shadow the Weasel, though
he doesn't often try to catch one, because there are other things
to eat much easier to get. Chatterer had had more than one narrow
escape from old Redtail and was very much afraid of him, yet here
he was running up the very tree in which Redtail was sitting.
You see, a very daring idea had come into his head. He had seen
at once that Redtail was dozing and hadn't seen him at all. He
knew that Redtail would just as soon have Shadow the Weasel for
dinner as himself, and a very daring plan had popped into his
head.</p>

<p>"I may as well be caught by Redtail as Shadow," he thought, as
he ran up the tree, "but if my plan works out right, I won't be
caught by either. Anyway, it is my very last chance."</p>

<p>Up the tree he scrambled, and after him went Shadow the Weasel.
Shadow had been so intent on catching Chatterer that he had not
noticed old Redtail, which was just as Chatterer had hoped. Up,
up he scrambled, straight past old Redtail, but as he passed,
he pulled one of Redtail's long tail feathers, and then ran on
to the top of the tree, and with the last bit of strength he had
left, leaped to a neighboring spruce-tree where, hidden by the
thick branches, he stopped to rest and see what would happen.</p>

<p>Of course, when he felt his tail pulled, old Redtail was wide
awake in a flash; and of course he looked down to see who had
dared to pull his tail. There just below him was Shadow the Weasel,
who had just that minute discovered who was sitting there. Old
Redtail hissed sharply, and the feathers on the top of his head
stood up in a way they do when he is angry. And he was angry&mdash;very
angry.</p>

<p>Shadow the Weasel stopped short. Then, like a flash, he dodged
around to the other side of the tree. He had no thought of Chatterer
now. Things were changed all in an instant, quite changed. Instead
of the hunter, he was now the hunted. Old Redtail circled in the
air just overhead, and every time he caught sight of Shadow, he
swooped at him with great, cruel claws spread to clutch him. Shadow
dodged around the trunk of the tree. He was more angry than frightened,
for his sharp eyes had spied a little hollow in a branch of the
chestnut-tree, and he knew that once inside of that, he would
have nothing to fear. But he was angry clear through to think
that he should be cheated out of that dinner he had been so sure
of only a few minutes before. So he screeched angrily at old Redtail
and then, watching his chance, scampered out to the hollow and
whisked inside, just in the nick of time.</p>

<p>Chatterer, watching from the spruce-tree, gave a great sigh of
relief. He saw Redtail the Hawk post himself on the top of a tall
tree where he could keep watch of that hollow in which Shadow
had disappeared, and he knew that it would be a long time before
Shadow would dare poke even his nose outside. Then, as soon as
he was rested, Chatterer stole softly, oh, so softly, away through
the tree-tops until he was sure that Redtail could not see him.
Then he hurried. He wanted to get just as far away from Shadow
the Weasel as he could.</p>
