<p>In Lecture V we found reason to think that the ultimate constituents*
of the world do not have the characteristics of either mind or
matter as ordinarily understood: they are not solid persistent
objects moving through space, nor are they fragments of "consciousness."
But we found two ways of grouping particulars, one into "things"
or "pieces of matter," the other into series of "perspectives,"
each series being what may be called a "biography." Before we
can define either sensations or images, it is necessary to consider
this twofold classification in somewhat greater detail, and to
derive from it a definition of perception. It should be said that,
in so far as the classification assumes the whole world of physics
(including its unperceived portions), it contains hypothetical
elements. But we will not linger on the grounds for admitting
these, which belong to the philosophy of physics rather than of
psychology.</p>

* When I speak of "ultimate constituents," I do not mean<br/>
necessarily such as are theoretically incapable of analysis,<br/>
but only such as, at present, we can see no means of<br/>
analysing. I speak of such constituents as "particulars," or<br/>
as "<em>RELATIVE </em>particulars" when I wish to emphasize the fact<br/>
that they may be themselves complex.

</p>
</div>
<p>The physical classification of particulars collects together
all those that are aspects of one "thing." Given any one particular,
it is found often (we do not say always) that there are a number
of other particulars differing from this one in gradually increasing
degrees. Those (or some of those) that differ from it only very
slightly will be found to differ approximately according to certain
laws which may be called, in a generalized sense, the laws of
"perspective"; they include the ordinary laws of perspective as
a special case. This approximation grows more and more nearly
exact as the difference grows less; in technical language, the
laws of perspective account for the differences to the first order
of small quantities, and other laws are only required to account
for second-order differences. That is to say, as the difference
diminishes, the part of the difference which is not according
to the laws of perspective diminishes much more rapidly, and bears
to the total difference a ratio which tends towards zero as both
are made smaller and smaller. By this means we can theoretically
collect together a number of particulars which may be defined
as the "aspects" or "appearances" of one thing at one time. If
the laws of perspective were sufficiently known, the connection
between different aspects would be expressed in differential equations.</p>

<p>This gives us, so far, only those particulars which constitute
one thing at one time. This set of particulars may be called a
"momentary thing." To define that series of "momentary things"
that constitute the successive states of one thing is a problem
involving the laws of dynamics. These give the laws governing
the changes of aspects from one time to a slightly later time,
with the same sort of differential approximation to exactness
as we obtained for spatially neighbouring aspects through the
laws of perspective. Thus a momentary thing is a set of particulars,
while a thing (which may be identified with the whole history
of the thing) is a series of such sets of particulars. The particulars
in one set are collected together by the laws of perspective;
the successive sets are collected together by the laws of dynamics.
This is the view of the world which is appropriate to traditional
physics.</p>

<p>The definition of a "momentary thing" involves problems concerning
time, since the particulars constituting a momentary thing will
not be all simultaneous, but will travel outward from the thing
with the velocity of light (in case the thing is in vacuo). There
are complications connected with relativity, but for our present
purpose they are not vital, and I shall ignore them.</p>

<p>Instead of first collecting together all the particulars constituting
a momentary thing, and then forming the series of successive sets,
we might have first collected together a series of successive
aspects related by the laws of dynamics, and then have formed
the set of such series related by the laws of perspective. To
illustrate by the case of an actor on the stage: our first plan
was to collect together all the aspects which he presents to different
spectators at one time, and then to form the series of such sets.
Our second plan is first to collect together all the aspects which
he presents successively to a given spectator, and then to do
the same thing for the other spectators, thus forming a set of
series instead of a series of sets. The first plan tells us what
he does; the second the impressions he produces. This second way
of classifying particulars is one which obviously has more relevance
to psychology than the other. It is partly by this second method
of classification that we obtain definitions of one "experience"
or "biography" or "person." This method of classification is also
essential to the definition of sensations and images, as I shall
endeavour to prove later on. But we must first amplify the definition
of perspectives and biographies.</p>

<p>In our illustration of the actor, we spoke, for the moment, as
though each spectator's mind were wholly occupied by the one actor.
If this were the case, it might be possible to define the biography
of one spectator as a series of successive aspects of the actor
related according to the laws of dynamics. But in fact this is
not the case. We are at all times during our waking life receiving
a variety of impressions, which are aspects of a variety of things.
We have to consider what binds together two simultaneous sensations
in one person, or, more generally, any two occurrences which forte
part of one experience. We might say, adhering to the standpoint
of physics, that two aspects of different things belong to the
same perspective when they are in the same place. But this would
not really help us, since a "place" has not yet been defined.
Can we define what is meant by saying that two aspects are "in
the same place," without introducing anything beyond the laws
of perspective and dynamics?</p>

<p>I do not feel sure whether it is possible to frame such a definition
or not; accordingly I shall not assume that it is possible, but
shall seek other characteristics by which a perspective or biography
may be defined.</p>

<p>When (for example) we see one man and hear another speaking at
the same time, what we see and what we hear have a relation which
we can perceive, which makes the two together form, in some sense,
one experience. It is when this relation exists that two occurrences
become associated. Semon's "engram" is formed by all that we experience
at one time. He speaks of two parts of this total as having the
relation of "Nebeneinander" (M. 118; <em>M.E. 33 </em>ff.), which
is reminiscent of Herbart's "Zusammen." I think the relation may
be called simply "simultaneity." It might be said that at any
moment all sorts of things that are not part of my experience
are happening in the world, and that therefore the relation we
are seeking to define cannot be merely simultaneity. This, however,
would be an error&mdash;the sort of error that the theory of relativity
avoids. There is not one universal time, except by an elaborate
construction; there are only local times, each of which may be
taken to be the time within one biography. Accordingly, if I am
(say) hearing a sound, the only occurrences that are, in any simple
sense, simultaneous with my sensation are events in my private
world, i.e. in my biography. We may therefore define the "perspective"
to which the sensation in question belongs as the set of particulars
that are simultaneous with this sensation. And similarly we may
define the "biography" to which the sensation belongs as the set
of particulars that are earlier or later than, or simultaneous
with, the given sensation. Moreover, the very same definitions
can be applied to particulars which are not sensations. They are
actually required for the theory of relativity, if we are to give
a philosophical explanation of what is meant by "local time" in
that theory The relations of simultaneity and succession are known
to us in our own experience; they may be analysable, but that
does not affect their suitability for defining perspectives and
biographies. Such time-relations as can be constructed between
events in different biographies are of a different kind: they
are not experienced, and are merely logical, being designed to
afford convenient ways of stating the correlations between different
biographies.</p>

<p>It is not only by time-relations that the parts of one biography
are collected together in the case of living beings. In this case
there are the mnemic phenomena which constitute the unity of one
"experience," and transform mere occurrences into "experiences."
I have already dwelt upon the importance of mnemic phenomena for
psychology, and shall not enlarge upon them now, beyond observing
that they are what transforms a biography (in our technical sense)
into a life. It is they that give the continuity of a "person"
or a "mind." But there is no reason to suppose that mnemic phenomena
are associated with biographies except in the case of animals
and plants.</p>

<p>Our two-fold classification of particulars gives rise to the
dualism of body and biography in regard to everything in the universe,
and not only in regard to living things. This arises as follows.
Every particular of the sort considered by physics is a member
of two groups (1) The group of particulars constituting the other
aspects of the same physical object; (2) The group of particulars
that have direct time-relations to the given particular.</p>

<p>Each of these is associated with a place. When I look at a star,
my sensation is (1) A member of the group of particulars which
is the star, and which is associated with the place where the
star is; (2) A member of the group of particulars which is my
biography, and which is associated with the place where I am.*</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*I have explained elsewhere the manner in which space is<br/>
constructed on this theory, and in which the position of a<br/>
perspective is brought into relation with the position of a<br/>
physical object ("Our Knowledge of the External World,"<br/>
Lecture <em>III, </em>pp. 90, 91).

</p>
</div>
<p>The result is that every particular of the kind relevant to physics
is associated with <em>TWO </em>places; e.g. my sensation of the
star is associated with the place where I am and with the place
where the star is. This dualism has nothing to do with any "mind"
that I may be supposed to possess; it exists in exactly the same
sense if I am replaced by a photographic plate. We may call the
two places the active and passive places respectively.* Thus in
the case of a perception or photograph of a star, the active place
is the place where the star is, while the passive place is the
place where the percipient or photographic plate is.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
* I use these as mere names; I do not want to introduce any<br/>
notion of "activity."

</p>
</div>
<p>We can thus, without departing from physics, collect together
all the particulars actively at a given place, or all the particulars
passively at a given place. In our own case, the one group is
our body (or our brain), while the other is our mind, in so far
as it consists of perceptions. In the case of the photographic
plate, the first group is the plate as dealt with by physics,
the second the aspect of the heavens which it photographs. (For
the sake of schematic simplicity, I am ignoring various complications
connected with time, which require some tedious but perfectly
feasible elaborations.) Thus what may be called subjectivity in
the point of view is not a distinctive peculiarity of mind: it
is present just as much in the photographic plate. And the photographic
plate has its biography as well as its "matter." But this biography
is an affair of physics, and has none of the peculiar characteristics
by which "mental" phenomena are distinguished, with the sole exception
of subjectivity.</p>

<p>Adhering, for the moment, to the standpoint of physics, we may
define a "perception" of an object as the appearance of the object
from a place where there is a brain (or, in lower animals, some
suitable nervous structure), with sense-organs and nerves forming
part of the intervening medium. Such appearances of objects are
distinguished from appearances in other places by certain peculiarities,
namely:</p>

<p>(1) They give rise to mnemic phenomena;</p>

<p>(2) They are themselves affected by mnemic phenomena.</p>

<p>That is to say, they may be remembered and associated or influence
our habits, or give rise to images, etc., and they are themselves
different from what they would have been if our past experience
had been different&mdash;for example, the effect of a spoken sentence
upon the hearer depends upon whether the hearer knows the language
or not, which is a question of past experience. It is these two
characteristics, both connected with mnemic phenomena, that distinguish
perceptions from the appearances of objects in places where there
is no living being.</p>

<p>Theoretically, though often not practically, we can, in our perception
of an object, separate the part which is due to past experience
from the part which proceeds without mnemic influences out of
the character of the object. We may define as "sensation" that
part which proceeds in this way, while the remainder, which is
a mnemic phenomenon, will have to be added to the sensation to
make up what is called the "perception." According to this definition,
the sensation is a theoretical core in the actual experience;
the actual experience is the perception. It is obvious that there
are grave difficulties in carrying out these definitions, but
we will not linger over them. We have to pass, as soon as we can,
from the physical standpoint, which we have been hitherto adopting,
to the standpoint of psychology, in which we make more use of
introspection in the first of the three senses discussed in the
preceding lecture.</p>

<p>But before making the transition, there are two points which
must be made clear. First: Everything outside my own personal
biography is outside my experience; therefore if anything can
be known by me outside my biography, it can only be known in one
of two ways:</p>

<p>(1) By inference from things within my biography, or</p>

<p>(2) By some a priori principle independent of experience.</p>

<p>I do not myself believe that anything approaching certainty is
to be attained by either of these methods, and therefore whatever
lies outside my personal biography must be regarded, theoretically,
as hypothesis. The theoretical argument for adopting the hypothesis
is that it simplifies the statement of the laws according to which
events happen in our experience. But there is no very good ground
for supposing that a simple law is more likely to be true than
a complicated law, though there is good ground for assuming a
simple law in scientific practice, as a working hypothesis, if
it explains the facts as well as another which is less simple.
Belief in the existence of things outside my own biography exists
antecedently to evidence, and can only be destroyed, if at all,
by a long course of philosophic doubt. For purposes of science,
it is justified practically by the simplification which it introduces
into the laws of physics. But from the standpoint of theoretical
logic it must be regarded as a prejudice, not as a well-grounded
theory. With this proviso, I propose to continue yielding to the
prejudice.</p>

<p>The second point concerns the relating of our point of view to
that which regards sensations as caused by stimuli external to
the nervous system (or at least to the brain), and distinguishes
images as "centrally excited," i.e. due to causes in the brain
which cannot be traced back to anything affecting the sense-organs.
It is clear that, if our analysis of physical objects has been
valid, this way of defining sensations needs reinterpretation.
It is also clear that we must be able to find such a new interpretation
if our theory is to be admissible.</p>

<p>To make the matter clear, we will take the simplest possible
illustration. Consider a certain star, and suppose for the moment
that its size is negligible. That is to say, we will regard it
as, for practical purposes, a luminous point. Let us further suppose
that it exists only for a very brief time, say a second. Then,
according to physics, what happens is that a spherical wave of
light travels outward from the star through space, just as, when
you drop a stone into a stagnant pond, ripples travel outward
from the place where the stone hit the water. The wave of light
travels with a certain very nearly constant velocity, roughly
300,000 kilometres per second. This velocity may be ascertained
by sending a flash of light to a mirror, and observing how long
it takes before the reflected flash reaches you, just as the velocity
of sound may be ascertained by means of an echo.</p>

<p>What it is that happens when a wave of light reaches a given
place we cannot tell, except in the sole case when the place in
question is a brain connected with an eye which is turned in the
right direction. In this one very special case we know what happens:
we have the sensation called "seeing the star." In all other cases,
though we know (more or less hypothetically) some of the correlations
and abstract properties of the appearance of the star, we do not
know the appearance itself. Now you may, for the sake of illustration,
compare the different appearances of the star to the conjugation
of a Greek verb, except that the number of its parts is really
infinite, and not only apparently so to the despairing schoolboy.
In vacuo, the parts are regular, and can be derived from the (imaginary)
root according to the laws of grammar, i.e. of perspective. The
star being situated in empty space, it may be defined, for purposes
of physics, as consisting of all those appearances which it presents
in vacuo, together with those which, according to the laws of
perspective, it would present elsewhere if its appearances elsewhere
were regular. This is merely the adaptation of the definition
of matter which I gave in an earlier lecture. The appearance of
a star at a certain place, if it is regular, does not require
any cause or explanation beyond the existence of the star. Every
regular appearance is an actual member of the system which is
the star, and its causation is entirely internal to that system.
We may express this by saying that a regular appearance is due
to the star alone, and is actually part of the star, in the sense
in which a man is part of the human race.</p>

<p>But presently the light of the star reaches our atmosphere. It
begins to be refracted, and dimmed by mist, and its velocity is
slightly diminished. At last it reaches a human eye, where a complicated
process takes place, ending in a sensation which gives us our
grounds for believing in all that has gone before. Now, the irregular
appearances of the star are not, strictly speaking, members of
the system which is the star, according to our definition of matter.
The irregular appearances, however, are not merely irregular:
they proceed according to laws which can be stated in terms of
the matter through which the light has passed on its way. The
sources of an irregular appearance are therefore twofold:</p>

<p>(1) The object which is appearing irregularly;</p>

<p>2) The intervening medium.</p>

<p>It should be observed that, while the conception of a regular
appearance is perfectly precise, the conception of an irregular
appearance is one capable of any degree of vagueness. When the
distorting influence of the medium is sufficiently great, the
resulting particular can no longer be regarded as an appearance
of an object, but must be treated on its own account. This happens
especially when the particular in question cannot be traced back
to one object, but is a blend of two or more. This case is normal
in perception: we see as one what the microscope or telescope
reveals to be many different objects. The notion of perception
is therefore not a precise one: we perceive things more or less,
but always with a very considerable amount of vagueness and confusion.</p>

<p>In considering irregular appearances, there are certain very
natural mistakes which must be avoided. In order that a particular
may count as an irregular appearance of a certain object, it is
not necessary that it should bear any resemblance to the regular
appearances as regard its intrinsic qualities. All that is necessary
is that it should be derivable from the regular appearances by
the laws which express the distorting influence of the medium.
When it is so derivable, the particular in question may be regarded
as caused by the regular appearances, and therefore by the object
itself, together with the modifications resulting from the medium.
In other cases, the particular in question may, in the same sense,
be regarded as caused by several objects together with the medium;
in this case, it may be called a confused appearance of several
objects. If it happens to be in a brain, it may be called a confused
perception of these objects. All actual perception is confused
to a greater or less extent.</p>

<p>We can now interpret in terms of our theory the distinction between
those mental occurrences which are said to have an external stimulus,
and those which are said to be "centrally excited," i.e. to have
no stimulus external to the brain. When a mental occurrence can
be regarded as an appearance of an object external to the brain,
however irregular, or even as a confused appearance of several
such objects, then we may regard it as having for its stimulus
the object or objects in question, or their appearances at the
sense-organ concerned. When, on the other hand, a mental occurrence
has not sufficient connection with objects external to the brain
to be regarded as an appearance of such objects, then its physical
causation (if any) will have to be sought in the brain. In the
former case it can be called a perception; in the latter it cannot
be so called. But the distinction is one of degree, not of kind.
Until this is realized, no satisfactory theory of perception,
sensation, or imagination is possible.</p>
