<p>On the outside of the cavern the boys halted. After the shock
both were comparatively calm. Their faces were pale, and they
compressed their lips with resolution. Some time during the preceding
few hours thieves had entered their home and carried away one
hundred thousand dollars in gold dust and nuggets, and the youths
were determined to regain the property, no matter what danger
had to be confronted.</p>

<p>But the common sense of the boys told them the surest way to
defeat their resolve was to rush off blindly, with not one chance
in a thousand of taking the right course.</p>

<p>"Roswell, that gold weighs so much that no one and no two men
could carry it off, unless they made several journeys."</p>

<p>"Or there were more of them; they would hardly dare return after
one visit."</p>

<p>"Why not? Hardman (for I know he is at the bottom of the business)
and the other rogue have been watching us for several days. They
knew that when we left here in the morning we would not come back
till night, and they had all the time they needed and much more."</p>

<p>"But if there were only two, they would have to keep doubling
their journey, and I don't believe they would do that. Perhaps
they used the donkey."</p>

<p>"Let's find out."</p>

<p>The burro was accustomed to graze over an area several acres
in extent and enclosed by walls of rocks. Since the first-mentioned
brook ran alongside, the indolent creature could be counted upon
to remain where the pasture was succulent and abundant. The place
was not far off, and the boys hurried thither.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the suggestive fact became apparent&mdash;the
donkey was gone.</p>

<p>"And he helped take the gold!" was the exclamation of Frank.
"They loaded part of it on his back and carried the rest. I don't
believe they are far off."</p>

<p>It was certain the thieves had not gone in the direction of the
diggings, and it was improbable that they would attempt to reach
Dawson City, at least, for an indefinite time, for they must have
known that Jeff Graham and Tim McCabe had gone thither, and that
there they were likely to be seen and recognized. At any rate,
it would be hard for them to get away through the town for a considerable
period, during which the grim old miner would make things warm
for them.</p>

<p>The conclusion of the boys, therefore, after briefly debating
the problem, was that the men had turned into the mountains. These
stretched away for many miles, and contained hundreds of places
where they would be safe from pursuit by a regiment of men.</p>

<p>"But if they took the burro," said Roswell, "as it seems certain
they did, they must have followed some kind of a path along which
we can pursue them."</p>

<p>"Provided we can find it."</p>

<p>They were too much stirred to remain idle. Frank led the way
to the corner of the enclosure which was bisected by the brook.
There the moistened ground was so spongy that it would disclose
any footprint. The marks made by the hoofs of the burro were everywhere,
and while examining what seemed to be the freshest, Roswell uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked his cousin, hurrying to his side.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?" asked the other in turn, pointing to the ground.</p>

<p>There were the distinct impressions of a pair of heavy shoes.
The burro had been loaded at the brook, or his new masters had
allowed him to drink before starting into the mountains.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE TELL-TALE FOOTPRINTS</em>.]</p>

<p>The boys took several minutes to study the impressions, which
appeared in a number of places. The inspection brought an interesting
truth to light. One set of imprints was large, and the right shoe
or boot had a broken patch on the sole, which showed when the
ground was more yielding than usual. The others were noticeably
smaller, and the toes pointed almost straight forward, like those
of an American Indian. A minute examination of the soil failed
to bring any other peculiarity to light. The conclusion, therefore,
was that only two men were concerned in the robbery.</p>

<p>The problem now assumed a phase which demanded brain work, and
the youths met it with a skill that did them credit. The question
was:</p>

<p>"If the burro was loaded with the gold at this point, or if he
was brought hither, which amounts to the same thing, where did
he and the thieves leave the enclosure?"</p>

<p>Neither of the boys had ever felt enough interest in the animal
to make an inspection of his pasturage ground, and therefore knew
nothing about it, but scrutinizing the boundaries, they fixed
upon two gaps or openings on the farther side, both leading deeper
into the mountains, one of which they believed had been used.</p>

<p>"Let's try the nearest," said Roswell, leading the way across
the comparatively level space.</p>

<p>There the ground was higher, fairly dry and gravelly. A close
scrutiny failed to reveal any signs of disturbance, and forced
them to conclude that some other outlet had been taken. They made
haste to the second.</p>

<p>This was drier and more gravelly than the other. While the soil
seemed to have been disturbed, they could not make sure whether
or not it was by the hoofs of an animal, but Frank caught sight
of something on a projecting point of a rock, just in front. Stepping
forward, he plucked it off, and held it up in the light. It consisted
of a dozen dark, coarse hairs.</p>

<p>"That's where the burro scraped against the rock," he said. "We
are on their path."</p>

<p>In their eagerness they would have kept beside each other had
not the passage been so narrow. Often they came to places where
one would have declared it impossible for a mule or donkey to
make his way, but there could be no question that the property
of Jeff Graham had done it. Frequently he slipped, and must have
come near falling, but he managed to keep forward with his precious
load.</p>

<p>Less than two hundred yards distant the pursuers came to a depression
of the soil where it was damp, and the footprints of the donkey
and the two men were as distinct as if made in putty. There could
be no question that the boys were on the trail of the despoilers.</p>

<p>As they advanced, Frank, who was in advance; frequently turned
his head and spoke in guarded tones over his shoulder to his cousin.</p>

<p>"They are pushing into the mountains," said he, "but there's
no saying how far they are ahead of us."</p>

<p>"No; if they made the start early in the morning, it would give
them a big advantage."</p>

<p>"I believe that is what they did, knowing there was no danger
of our returning until night."</p>

<p>"That knowledge may have made them slow. Anyhow, they are not
travelling as fast as we, and we must overtake them before long."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Frank asked:</p>

<p>"Do you believe they have thought of being followed?"</p>

<p>"They must know there is danger of it. They will fight to keep
that gold, and if they get the first sight of us will shoot."</p>

<p>"They may have revolvers, but I don't believe either has a rifle.
We will keep a lookout that we don't run into them before we know
it and give them the advantage."</p>

<p>This dread handicapped the boys to some extent. The trail was
not distinctly marked, often winding and precipitous, and compelling
them to halt and examine the ground and consult as to their course.</p>

<p>While thus engaged, they awoke to the fact that they had gone
astray and were not following the trail at all.</p>
