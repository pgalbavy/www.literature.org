<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> The knowledge was too disturbing, really. There was "something
wrong"  with a vengeance, and the moral certitude of it was at
first simply frightful to contemplate. Sterne had been looking
aft in a mood so idle, that for once he was thinking no harm of
anyone. His captain on the bridge presented himself naturally
to his sight. How insignificant, how casual was the thought that
had started the train of discovery&mdash;like an accidental spark that
suffices to ignite the charge of a tremendous mine!</p>

<p>Caught under by the breeze, the awnings of the foredeck bellied
upwards and collapsed slowly, and above their heavy flapping the
gray stuff of Captain Whalley’s roomy coat fluttered incessantly
around his arms and trunk. He faced the wind in full light, with
his great silvery beard blown forcibly against his chest; the
eyebrows overhung heavily the shadows whence his glance appeared
to be staring ahead piercingly. Sterne could just detect the twin
gleam of the whites shifting under the shaggy arches of the brow.
At short range these eyes, for all the man’s affable manner, seemed
to look you through and through. Sterne never could defend himself
from that feeling when he had occasion to speak with his captain.
He did not like it. What a big heavy man he appeared up there,
with that little shrimp of a Serang in close attendance&mdash;as was
usual in this extraordinary steamer! Confounded absurd custom
that. He resented it. Surely the old fellow could have looked
after his ship without that loafing native at his elbow. Sterne
wriggled his shoulders with disgust. What was it? Indolence or
what?</p>

<p>That old skipper must have been growing lazy for years. They
all grew lazy out East here (Sterne was very conscious of his
own unimpaired activity); they got slack all over. But he towered
very erect on the bridge; and quite low by his side, as you see
a small child looking over the edge of a table, the battered soft
hat and the brown face of the Serang peeped over the white canvas
screen of the rail.</p>

<p>No doubt the Malay was standing back, nearer to the wheel; but
the great disparity of size in close association amused Sterne
like the observation of a bizarre fact in nature. They were as
queer fish out of the sea as any in it.</p>

<p>He saw Captain Whalley turn his head quickly to speak to his
Serang; the wind whipped the whole white mass of the beard sideways.
He would be directing the chap to look at the compass for him,
or what not. Of course. Too much trouble to step over and see
for himself. Sterne’s scorn for that bodily indolence which overtakes
white men in the East increased on reflection. Some of them would
be utterly lost if they hadn’t all these natives at their beck
and call; they grew perfectly shameless about it too. He was not
of that sort, thank God! It wasn’t in him to make himself dependent
for his work on any shriveled-up little Malay like that. As if
one could ever trust a silly native for anything in the world!
But that fine old man thought differently, it seems. There they
were together, never far apart; a pair of them, recalling to the
mind an old whale attended by a little pilot-fish.</p>

<p>The fancifulness of the comparison made him smile. A whale with
an inseparable pilot-fish! That’s what the old man looked like;
for it could not be said he looked like a shark, though Mr. Massy
had called him that very name. But Mr. Massy did not mind what
he said in his savage fits. Sterne smiled to himself&mdash;and gradually
the ideas evoked by the sound, by the imagined shape of the word
pilot-fish; the ideas of aid, of guidance needed and received,
came uppermost in his mind: the word pilot awakened the idea of
trust, of dependence, the idea of welcome, clear-eyed help brought
to the seaman groping for the land in the dark: groping blindly
in fogs: feeling their way in the thick weather of the gales that,
filling the air with a salt mist blown up from the sea, contract
the range of sight on all sides to a shrunken horizon that seems
within reach of the hand.</p>

<p>A pilot sees better than a stranger, because his local knowledge,
like a sharper vision, completes the shapes of things hurriedly
glimpsed; penetrates the veils of mist spread over the land by
the storms of the sea; defines with certitude the outlines of
a coast lying under the pall of fog, the forms of landmarks half
buried in a starless night as in a shallow grave. He recognizes
because he already knows. It is not to his far-reaching eye but
to his more extensive knowledge that the pilot looks for certitude;
for this certitude of the ship’s position on which may depend
a man’s good fame and the peace of his conscience, the justification
of the trust deposited in his hands, with his own life too, which
is seldom wholly his to throw away, and the humble lives of others
rooted in distant affections, perhaps, and made as weighty as
the lives of kings by the burden of the awaiting mystery. The
pilot’s knowledge brings relief and certitude to the commander
of a ship; the Serang, however, in his fanciful suggestion of
a pilot-fish attending a whale, could not in any way be credited
with a superior knowledge. Why should he have it? These two men
had come on that run together&mdash;the white and the brown&mdash;on the
same day: and of course a white man would learn more in a week
than the best native would in a month. He was made to stick to
the skipper as though he were of some use&mdash;as the pilot-fish,
they say, is to the whale. But how&mdash;it was very marked&mdash;how? A
pilot-fish&mdash;a pilot&mdash;a . . . But if not superior knowledge then
. . .</p>

<p>Sterne’s discovery was made. It was repugnant to his imagination,
shocking to his ideas of honesty, shocking to his conception of
mankind. This enormity affected one’s outlook on what was possible
in this world: it was as if for instance the sun had turned blue,
throwing a new and sinister light on men and nature. Really in
the first moment he had felt sickish, as though he had got a blow
below the belt: for a second the very color of the sea seemed
changed&mdash;appeared queer to his wandering eye; and he had a passing,
unsteady sensation in all his limbs as though the earth had started
turning the other way.</p>

<p>A very natural incredulity succeeding this sense of upheaval
brought a measure of relief. He had gasped; it was over. But afterwards
during all that day sudden paroxysms of wonder would come over
him in the midst of his occupations. He would stop and shake his
head. The revolt of his incredulity had passed away almost as
quick as the first emotion of discovery, and for the next twenty-four
hours he had no sleep. That would never do. At meal-times (he
took the foot of the table set up for the white men on the bridge)
he could not help losing himself in a fascinated contemplation
of Captain Whalley opposite. He watched the deliberate upward
movements of the arm; the old man put his food to his lips as
though he never expected to find any taste in his daily bread,
as though he did not know anything about it. He fed himself like
a somnambulist. "It’s an awful sight," thought Sterne; and he
watched the long period of mournful, silent immobility, with a
big brown hand lying loosely closed by the side of the plate,
till he noticed the two engineers to the right and left looking
at him in astonishment. He would close his mouth in a hurry then,
and lowering his eyes, wink rapidly at his plate. It was awful
to see the old chap sitting there; it was even awful to think
that with three words he could blow him up sky-high. All he had
to do was to raise his voice and pronounce a single short sentence,
and yet that simple act seemed as impossible to attempt as moving
the sun out of its place in the sky. The old chap could eat in
his terrific mechanical way; but Sterne, from mental excitement,
could not&mdash;not that evening, at any rate.</p>

<p>He had had ample time since to get accustomed to the strain of
the meal-hours. He would never have believed it. But then use
is everything; only the very potency of his success prevented
anything resembling elation. He felt like a man who, in his legitimate
search for a loaded gun to help him on his way through the world,
chances to come upon a torpedo&mdash;upon a live torpedo with a shattering
charge in its head and a pressure of many atmospheres in its tail.
It is the sort of weapon to make its possessor careworn and nervous.
He had no mind to be blown up himself; and he could not get rid
of the notion that the explosion was bound to damage him too in
some way.</p>

<p>This vague apprehension had restrained him at first. He was able
now to eat and sleep with that fearful weapon by his side, with
the conviction of its power always in mind. It had not been arrived
at by any reflective process; but once the idea had entered his
head, the conviction had followed overwhelmingly in a multitude
of observed little facts to which before he had given only a languid
attention. The abrupt and faltering intonations of the deep voice;
the taciturnity put on like an armor; the deliberate, as if guarded,
movements; the long immobilities, as if the man he watched had
been afraid to disturb the very air: every familiar gesture, every
word uttered in his hearing, every sigh overheard, had acquired
a special significance, a confirmatory import.</p>

<p>Every day that passed over the Sofala appeared to Sterne simply
crammed full with proofs&mdash;with incontrovertible proofs. At night,
when off duty, he would steal out of his cabin in pyjamas (for
more proofs) and stand a full hour, perhaps, on his bare feet
below the bridge, as absolutely motionless as the awning stanchion
in its deck socket near by. On the stretches of easy navigation
it is not usual for a coasting captain to remain on deck all the
time of his watch. The Serang keeps it for him as a matter of
custom; in open water, on a straight course, he is usually trusted
to look after the ship by himself. But this old man seemed incapable
of remaining quietly down below. No doubt he could not sleep.
And no wonder. This was also a proof. Suddenly in the silence
of the ship panting upon the still, dark sea, Sterne would hear
a low voice above him exclaiming nervously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Serang!"</p>

<p>"Tuan!"</p>

<p>"You are watching the compass well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am watching, Tuan."</p>

<p>"The ship is making her course?"</p>

<p>"She is, Tuan. Very straight."</p>

<p>"It is well; and remember, Serang, that the order is that you
are to mind the helmsmen and keep a lookout with care, the same
as if I were not on deck."</p>

<p>Then, when the Serang had made his answer, the low tones on the
bridge would cease, and everything round Sterne seemed to become
more still and more profoundly silent. Slightly chilled and with
his back aching a little from long immobility, he would steal
away to his room on the port side of the deck. He had long since
parted with the last vestige of incredulity; of the original emotions,
set into a tumult by the discovery, some trace of the first awe
alone remained. Not the awe of the man himself&mdash;he could blow
him up sky-high with six words&mdash;rather it was an awestruck indignation
at the reckless perversity of avarice (what else could it be?),
at the mad and somber resolution that for the sake of a few dollars
more seemed to set at naught the common rule of conscience and
pretended to struggle against the very decree of Providence.</p>

<p>You could not find another man like this one in the whole round
world&mdash;thank God. There was something devilishly dauntless in
the character of such a deception which made you pause.</p>

<p>Other considerations occurring to his prudence had kept him tongue-tied
from day to day. It seemed to him now that it would yet have been
easier to speak out in the first hour of discovery. He almost
regretted not having made a row at once. But then the very monstrosity
of the disclosure . . . Why! He could hardly face it himself,
let alone pointing it out to somebody else. Moreover, with a desperado
of that sort one never knew. The object was not to get him out
(that was as well as done already), but to step into his place.
Bizarre as the thought seemed he might have shown fight. A fellow
up to working such a fraud would have enough cheek for anything;
a fellow that, as it were, stood up against God Almighty Himself.
He was a horrid marvel&mdash;that’s what he was: he was perfectly capable
of brazening out the affair scandalously till he got him (Sterne)
kicked out of the ship and everlastingly damaged his prospects
in this part of the East. Yet if you want to get on something
must be risked. At times Sterne thought he had been unduly timid
of taking action in the past; and what was worse, it had come
to this, that in the present he did not seem to know what action
to take.</p>

<p>Massy’s savage moroseness was too disconcerting. It was an incalculable
factor of the situation. You could not tell what there was behind
that insulting ferocity. How could one trust such a temper; it
did not put Sterne in bodily fear for himself, but it frightened
him exceedingly as to his prospects.</p>

<p>Though of course inclined to credit himself with exceptional
powers of observation, he had by now lived too long with his discovery.
He had gone on looking at nothing else, till at last one day it
occurred to him that the thing was so obvious that no one could
miss seeing it. There were four white men in all on board the
Sofala. Jack, the second engineer, was too dull to notice anything
that took place out of his engine-room. Remained Massy&mdash;the owner&mdash;the
interested person&mdash;nearly going mad with worry. Sterne had heard
and seen more than enough on board to know what ailed him; but
his exasperation seemed to make him deaf to cautious overtures.
If he had only known it, there was the very thing he wanted. But
how could you bargain with a man of that sort? It was like going
into a tiger’s den with a piece of raw meat in your hand. He was
as likely as not to rend you for your pains. In fact, he was always
threatening to do that very thing; and the urgency of the case,
combined with the impossibility of handling it with safety, made
Sterne in his watches below toss and mutter open-eyed in his bunk,
for hours, as though he had been burning with fever.</p>

<p>Occurrences like the crossing of the bar just now were extremely
alarming to his prospects. He did not want to be left behind by
some swift catastrophe. Massy being on the bridge, the old man
had to brace himself up and make a show, he supposed. But it was
getting very bad with him, very bad indeed, now. Even Massy had
been emboldened to find fault this time; Sterne, listening at
the foot of the ladder, had heard the other’s whimpering and artless
denunciations. Luckily the beast was very stupid and could not
see the why of all this. However, small blame to him; it took
a clever man to hit upon the cause. Nevertheless, it was high
time to do something. The old man’s game could not be kept up
for many days more.</p>

<p>"I may yet lose my life at this fooling&mdash;let alone my chance,"
Sterne mumbled angrily to himself, after the stooping back of
the chief engineer had disappeared round the corner of the skylight.
Yes, no doubt&mdash;he thought; but to blurt out his knowledge would
not advance his prospects. On the contrary, it would blast them
utterly as likely as not. He dreaded another failure. He had a
vague consciousness of not being much liked by his fellows in
this part of the world; inexplicably enough, for he had done nothing
to them. Envy, he supposed. People were always down on a clever
chap who made no bones about his determination to get on. To do
your duty and count on the gratitude of that brute Massy would
be sheer folly. He was a bad lot. Unmanly! A vicious man! Bad!
Bad! A brute! A brute without a spark of anything human about
him; without so much as simple curiosity even, or else surely
he would have responded in some way to all these hints he had
been given. . . . Such insensibility was almost mysterious. Massy’s
state of exasperation seemed to Sterne to have made him stupid
beyond the ordinary silliness of shipowners.</p>

<p>Sterne, meditating on the embarrassments of that stupidity, forgot
himself completely. His stony, unwinking stare was fixed on the
planks of the deck.</p>

<p>The slight quiver agitating the whole fabric of the ship was
more perceptible in the silent river, shaded and still like a
forest path. The Sofala, gliding with an even motion, had passed
beyond the coast-belt of mud and mangroves. The shores rose higher,
in firm sloping banks, and the forest of big trees came down to
the brink. Where the earth had been crumbled by the floods it
showed a steep brown cut, denuding a mass of roots intertwined
as if wrestling underground; and in the air, the interlaced boughs,
bound and loaded with creepers, carried on the struggle for life,
mingled their foliage in one solid wall of leaves, with here and
there the shape of an enormous dark pillar soaring, or a ragged
opening, as if torn by the flight of a cannonball, disclosing
the impenetrable gloom within, the secular inviolable shade of
the virgin forest. The thump of the engines reverberated regularly
like the strokes of a metronome beating the measure of the vast
silence, the shadow of the western wall had fallen across the
river, and the smoke pouring backwards from the funnel eddied
down behind the ship, spread a thin dusky veil over the somber
water, which, checked by the flood-tide, seemed to lie stagnant
in the whole straight length of the reaches.</p>

<p>Sterne’s body, as if rooted on the spot, trembled slightly from
top to toe with the internal vibration of the ship; from under
his feet came sometimes a sudden clang of iron, the noisy burst
of a shout below; to the right the leaves of the tree-tops caught
the rays of the low sun, and seemed to shine with a golden green
light of their own shimmering around the highest boughs which
stood out black against a smooth blue sky that seemed to droop
over the bed of the river like the roof of a tent. The passengers
for Batu Beru, kneeling on the planks, were engaged in rolling
their bedding of mats busily; they tied up bundles, they snapped
the locks of wooden chests. A pockmarked peddler of small wares
threw his head back to drain into his throat the last drops out
of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets.
Knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in
low tones; the followers of a small Rajah from down the coast,
broad-faced, simple young fellows in white drawers and round white
cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze
shoulders, squatted on their hams on the hatch, chewing betel
with bright red mouths as if they had been tasting blood. Their
spears, lying piled up together within the circle of their bare
toes, resembled a casual bundle of dry bamboos; a thin, livid
Chinaman, with a bulky package wrapped up in leaves already thrust
under his arm, gazed ahead eagerly; a wandering Kling rubbed his
teeth with a bit of wood, pouring over the side a bright stream
of water out of his lips; the fat Rajah dozed in a shabby deck-chair,&mdash;and
at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves reappeared running
parallel along the banks, with their impenetrable solidity fading
at the top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs
growing free, of young delicate branches shooting from the topmost
limbs of hoary trunks, of feathery heads of climbers like delicate
silver sprays standing up without a quiver. There was not a sign
of a clearing anywhere; not a trace of human habitation, except
when in one place, on the bare end of a low point under an isolated
group of slender tree-ferns, the jagged, tangled remnants of an
old hut on piles appeared with that peculiar aspect of ruined
bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club. Farther on,
half hidden under the drooping bushes, a canoe containing a man
and a woman, together with a dozen green cocoanuts in a heap,
rocked helplessly after the Sofala had passed, like a navigating
contrivance of venturesome insects, of traveling ants; while two
glassy folds of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer
across the whole width of the river ran with her up stream smoothly,
fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth
against the miry foot of each bank.</p>

<p>"I must," thought Sterne, "bring that brute Massy to his bearings.
It’s getting too absurd in the end. Here’s the old man up there
buried in his chair&mdash;he may just as well be in his grave for all
the use he’ll ever be in the world&mdash;and the Serang’s in charge.
Because that’s what he is. In charge. In the place that’s mine
by rights. I must bring that savage brute to his bearings. I’ll
do it at once, too . . ."</p>

<p>When the mate made an abrupt start, a little brown half-naked
boy, with large black eyes, and the string of a written charm
round his neck, became panic-struck at once. He dropped the banana
he had been munching, and ran to the knee of a grave dark Arab
in flowing robes, sitting like a Biblical figure, incongruously,
on a yellow tin trunk corded with a rope of twisted rattan. The
father, unmoved, put out his hand to pat the little shaven poll
protectingly.</p>
