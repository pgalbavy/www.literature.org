<p>This book has grown out of an attempt to harmonize two different
tendencies, one in psychology, the other in physics, with both
of which I find myself in sympathy, although at first sight they
might seem inconsistent. On the one hand, many psychologists,
especially those of the behaviourist school, tend to adopt what
is essentially a materialistic position, as a matter of method
if not of metaphysics. They make psychology increasingly dependent
on physiology and external observation, and tend to think of matter
as something much more solid and indubitable than mind. Meanwhile
the physicists, especially Einstein and other exponents of the
theory of relativity, have been making "matter" less and less
material. Their world consists of "events," from which "matter"
is derived by a logical construction. Whoever reads, for example,
Professor Eddington's "Space, Time and Gravitation" (Cambridge
University Press, 1920), will see that an old-fashioned materialism
can receive no support from modern physics. I think that what
has permanent value in the outlook of the behaviourists is the
feeling that physics is the most fundamental science at present
in existence. But this position cannot be called materialistic,
if, as seems to be the case, physics does not assume the existence
of matter.</p>

<p>The view that seems to me to reconcile the materialistic tendency
of psychology with the anti-materialistic tendency of physics
is the view of William James and the American new realists, according
to which the "stuff" of the world is neither mental nor material,
but a "neutral stuff," out of which both are constructed. I have
endeavoured in this work to develop this view in some detail as
regards the phenomena with which psychology is concerned.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Professor John B. Watson and to Dr. T. P.
Nunn for reading my <em>MSS. </em>at an early stage and helping
me with many valuable suggestions; also to Mr. A. Wohlgemuth for
much very useful information as regards important literature.
I have also to acknowledge the help of the editor of this Library
of Philosophy, Professor Muirhead, for several suggestions by
which I have profited.</p>

<p>The work has been given in the form of lectures both in London
and Peking, and one lecture, that on Desire, has been published
in the Athenaeum.</p>

<p>There are a few allusions to China in this book, all of which
were written before I had been in China, and are not intended
to be taken by the reader as geographically accurate. I have used
"China" merely as a synonym for "a distant country," when I wanted
illustrations of unfamiliar things.</p>
