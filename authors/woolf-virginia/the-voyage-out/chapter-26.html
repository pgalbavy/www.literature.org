<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>For two or three hours longer the moon poured its light through
the empty air. Unbroken by clouds it fell straightly, and lay
almost like a chill white frost over the sea and the earth. During
these hours the silence was not broken, and the only movement
was caused by the movement of trees and branches which stirred
slightly, and then the shadows that lay across the white spaces
of the land moved too. In this profound silence one sound only
was audible, the sound of a slight but continuous breathing which
never ceased, although it never rose and never fell. It continued
after the birds had begun to flutter from branch to branch, and
could be heard behind the first thin notes of their voices. It
continued all through the hours when the east whitened, and grew
red, and a faint blue tinged the sky, but when the sun rose it
ceased, and gave place to other sounds.</p>

<p>The first sounds that were heard were little inarticulate cries,
the cries, it seemed, of children or of the very poor, of people
who were very weak or in pain. But when the sun was above the
horizon, the air which had been thin and pale grew every moment
richer and warmer, and the sounds of life became bolder and more
full of courage and authority. By degrees the smoke began to ascend
in wavering breaths over the houses, and these slowly thickened,
until they were as round and straight as columns, and instead
of striking upon pale white blinds, the sun shone upon dark windows,
beyond which there was depth and space.</p>

<p>The sun had been up for many hours, and the great dome of air
was warmed through and glittering with thin gold threads of sunlight,
before any one moved in the hotel. White and massive it stood
in the early light, half asleep with its blinds down.</p>

<p>At about half-past nine Miss Allan came very slowly into the
hall, and walked very slowly to the table where the morning papers
were laid, but she did not put out her hand to take one; she stood
still, thinking, with her head a little sunk upon her shoulders.
She looked curiously old, and from the way in which she stood,
a little hunched together and very massive, you could see what
she would be like when she was really old, how she would sit day
after day in her chair looking placidly in front of her. Other
people began to come into the room, and to pass her, but she did
not speak to any of them or even look at them, and at last, as
if it were necessary to do something, she sat down in a chair,
and looked quietly and fixedly in front of her. She felt very
old this morning, and useless too, as if her life had been a failure,
as if it had been hard and laborious to no purpose. She did not
want to go on living, and yet she knew that she would. She was
so strong that she would live to be a very old woman. She would
probably live to be eighty, and as she was now fifty, that left
thirty years more for her to live. She turned her hands over and
over in her lap and looked at them curiously; her old hands, that
had done so much work for her. There did not seem to be much point
in it all; one went on, of course one went on. . . . She looked
up to see Mrs. Thornbury standing beside her, with lines drawn
upon her forehead, and her lips parted as if she were about to
ask a question.</p>

<p>Miss Allan anticipated her.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "She died this morning, very early, about three
o'clock."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury made a little exclamation, drew her lips together,
and the tears rose in her eyes. Through them she looked at the
hall which was now laid with great breadths of sunlight, and at
the careless, casual groups of people who were standing beside
the solid arm-chairs and tables. They looked to her unreal, or
as people look who remain unconscious that some great explosion
is about to take place beside them. But there was no explosion,
and they went on standing by the chairs and the tables. Mrs. Thornbury
no longer saw them, but, penetrating through them as though they
were without substance, she saw the house, the people in the house,
the room, the bed in the room, and the figure of the dead lying
still in the dark beneath the sheets. She could almost see the
dead. She could almost hear the voices of the mourners.</p>

<p>"They expected it?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>Miss Allan could only shake her head.</p>

<p>"I know nothing," she replied, "except what Mrs. Flushing's maid
told me. She died early this morning."</p>

<p>The two women looked at each other with a quiet significant gaze,
and then, feeling oddly dazed, and seeking she did not know exactly
what, Mrs. Thornbury went slowly upstairs and walked quietly along
the passages, touching the wall with her fingers as if to guide
herself. Housemaids were passing briskly from room to room, but
Mrs. Thornbury avoided them; she hardly saw them; they seemed
to her to be in another world. She did not even look up directly
when Evelyn stopped her. It was evident that Evelyn had been lately
in tears, and when she looked at Mrs. Thornbury she began to cry
again. Together they drew into the hollow of a window, and stood
there in silence. Broken words formed themselves at last among
Evelyn's sobs. "It was wicked," she sobbed, "it was cruel&mdash;they
were so happy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury patted her on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"It seems hard&mdash;very hard," she said. She paused and looked out
over the slope of the hill at the Ambroses' villa; the windows
were blazing in the sun, and she thought how the soul of the dead
had passed from those windows. Something had passed from the world.
It seemed to her strangely empty.</p>

<p>"And yet the older one grows," she continued, her eyes regaining
more than their usual brightness, "the more certain one becomes
that there is a reason. How could one go on if there were no reason?"
she asked.</p>

<p>She asked the question of some one, but she did not ask it of
Evelyn. Evelyn's sobs were becoming quieter. "There must be a
reason," she said. "It can't only be an accident. For it was an
accident&mdash;it need never have happened."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"But we must not let ourselves think of that," she added, "and
let us hope that they don't either. Whatever they had done it
might have been the same. These terrible illnesses&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no reason &mdash;I don't believe there's any reason
at all!" Evelyn broke out, pulling the blind down and letting
it fly back with a little snap.</p>

<p>"Why should these things happen? Why should people suffer? I
honestly believe," she went on, lowering her voice slightly, "that
Rachel's in Heaven, but Terence. . . ."</p>

<p>"What's the good of it all?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury shook her head slightly but made no reply, and
pressing Evelyn's hand she went on down the passage. Impelled
by a strong desire to hear something, although she did not know
exactly what there was to hear, she was making her way to the
Flushings' room. As she opened their door she felt that she had
interrupted some argument between husband and wife. Mrs. Flushing
was sitting with her back to the light, and Mr. Flushing was standing
near her, arguing and trying to persuade her of something.</p>

<p>"Ah, here is Mrs. Thornbury," he began with some relief in his
voice. "You have heard, of course. My wife feels that she was
in some way responsible. She urged poor Miss Vinrace to come on
the expedition. I'm sure you will agree with me that it is most
unreasonable to feel that. We don't even know&mdash;in fact I think
it most unlikely&mdash;that she caught her illness there. These diseases
&mdash;Besides, she was set on going. She would have gone whether
you asked her or not, Alice."</p>

<p>"Don't, Wilfrid," said Mrs. Flushing, neither moving nor taking
her eyes off the spot on the floor upon which they rested. "What's
the use of talking? What's the use&mdash;?" She ceased.</p>

<p>"I was coming to ask you," said Mrs. Thornbury, addressing Wilfrid,
for it was useless to speak to his wife. "Is there anything you
think that one could do? Has the father arrived? Could one go
and see?"</p>

<p>The strongest wish in her being at this moment was to be able
to do something for the unhappy people&mdash;to see them&mdash;to assure
them&mdash;to help them. It was dreadful to be so far away from them.
But Mr. Flushing shook his head; he did not think that now&mdash;later
perhaps one might be able to help. Here Mrs. Flushing rose stiffly,
turned her back to them, and walked to the dressing-room opposite.
As she walked, they could see her breast slowly rise and slowly
fall. But her grief was silent. She shut the door behind her.</p>

<p>When she was alone by herself she clenched her fists together,
and began beating the back of a chair with them. She was like
a wounded animal. She hated death; she was furious, outraged,
indignant with death, as if it were a living creature. She refused
to relinquish her friends to death. She would not submit to dark
and nothingness. She began to pace up and down, clenching her
hands, and making no attempt to stop the quick tears which raced
down her cheeks. She sat still at last, but she did not submit.
She looked stubborn and strong when she had ceased to cry.</p>

<p>In the next room, meanwhile, Wilfrid was talking to Mrs. Thornbury
with greater freedom now that his wife was not sitting there.</p>

<p>"That's the worst of these places," he said. "People will behave
as though they were in England, and they're not. I've no doubt
myself that Miss Vinrace caught the infection up at the villa
itself. She probably ran risks a dozen times a day that might
have given her the illness. It's absurd to say she caught it with
us."</p>

<p>If he had not been sincerely sorry for them he would have been
annoyed. "Pepper tells me," he continued, "that he left the house
because he thought them so careless. He says they never washed
their vegetables properly. Poor people! It's a fearful price to
pay. But it's only what I've seen over and over again&mdash;people
seem to forget that these things happen, and then they do happen,
and they're surprised."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thornbury agreed with him that they had been very careless,
and that there was no reason whatever to think that she had caught
the fever on the expedition; and after talking about other things
for a short time, she left him and went sadly along the passage
to her own room. There must be some reason why such things happen,
she thought to herself, as she shut the door. Only at first it
was not easy to understand what it was. It seemed so strange&mdash;so
unbelievable. Why, only three weeks ago&mdash;only a fortnight ago,
she had seen Rachel; when she shut her eyes she could almost see
her now, the quiet, shy girl who was going to be married. She
thought of all that she would have missed had she died at Rachel's
age, the children, the married life, the unimaginable depths and
miracles that seemed to her, as she looked back, to have lain
about her, day after day, and year after year. The stunned feeling,
which had been making it difficult for her to think, gradually
gave way to a feeling of the opposite nature; she thought very
quickly and very clearly, and, looking back over all her experiences,
tried to fit them into a kind of order. There was undoubtedly
much suffering, much struggling, but, on the whole, surely there
was a balance of happiness&mdash;surely order did prevail. Nor were
the deaths of young people really the saddest things in life&mdash;they
were saved so much; they kept so much. The dead&mdash;she called to
mind those who had died early, accidentally&mdash;were beautiful; she
often dreamt of the dead. And in time Terence himself would come
to feel &mdash;She got up and began to wander restlessly about
the room.</p>

<p>For an old woman of her age she was very restless, and for one
of her clear, quick mind she was unusually perplexed. She could
not settle to anything, so that she was relieved when the door
opened. She went up to her husband, took him in her arms, and
kissed him with unusual intensity, and then as they sat down together
she began to pat him and question him as if he were a baby, an
old, tired, querulous baby. She did not tell him about Miss Vinrace's
death, for that would only disturb him, and he was put out already.
She tried to discover why he was uneasy. Politics again? What
were those horrid people doing? She spent the whole morning in
discussing politics with her husband, and by degrees she became
deeply interested in what they were saying. But every now and
then what she was saying seemed to her oddly empty of meaning.</p>

<p>At luncheon it was remarked by several people that the visitors
at the hotel were beginning to leave; there were fewer every day.
There were only forty people at luncheon, instead of the sixty
that there had been. So old Mrs. Paley computed, gazing about
her with her faded eyes, as she took her seat at her own table
in the window. Her party generally consisted of Mr. Perrott as
well as Arthur and Susan, and to-day Evelyn was lunching with
them also.</p>

<p>She was unusually subdued. Having noticed that her eyes were
red, and guessing the reason, the others took pains to keep up
an elaborate conversation between themselves. She suffered it
to go on for a few minutes, leaning both elbows on the table,
and leaving her soup untouched, when she exclaimed suddenly, "I
don't know how you feel, but I can simply think of nothing else!"</p>

<p>The gentlemen murmured sympathetically, and looked grave.</p>

<p>Susan replied, "Yes&mdash;isn't it perfectly awful? When you think
what a nice girl she was&mdash;only just engaged, and this need never
have happened&mdash;it seems too tragic." She looked at Arthur as though
he might be able to help her with something more suitable.</p>

<p>"Hard lines," said Arthur briefly. "But it was a foolish thing
to do&mdash;to go up that river." He shook his head. "They should have
known better. You can't expect Englishwomen to stand roughing
it as the natives do who've been acclimatised. I'd half a mind
to warn them at tea that day when it was being discussed. But
it's no good saying these sort of things&mdash;it only puts people's
backs up&mdash;it never makes any difference."</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Paley, hitherto contented with her soup, here intimated,
by raising one hand to her ear, that she wished to know what was
being said.</p>

<p>"You heard, Aunt Emma, that poor Miss Vinrace has died of the
fever," Susan informed her gently. She could not speak of death
loudly or even in her usual voice, so that Mrs. Paley did not
catch a word. Arthur came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"Miss Vinrace is dead," he said very distinctly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paley merely bent a little towards him and asked, "Eh?"</p>

<p>"Miss Vinrace is dead," he repeated. It was only by stiffening
all the muscles round his mouth that he could prevent himself
from bursting into laughter, and forced himself to repeat for
the third time, "Miss Vinrace. . . . She's dead."</p>

<p>Let alone the difficulty of hearing the exact words, facts that
were outside her daily experience took some time to reach Mrs.
Paley's consciousness. A weight seemed to rest upon her brain,
impeding, though not damaging its action. She sat vague-eyed for
at least a minute before she realised what Arthur meant.</p>

<p>"Dead?" she said vaguely. "Miss Vinrace dead? Dear me . . . that's
very sad. But I don't at the moment remember which she was. We
seem to have made so many new acquaintances here." She looked
at Susan for help. "A tall dark girl, who just missed being handsome,
with a high colour?"</p>

<p>"No," Susan interposed. "She was&mdash;" then she gave it up in despair.
There was no use in explaining that Mrs. Paley was thinking of
the wrong person.</p>

<p>"She ought not to have died," Mrs. Paley continued. "She looked
so strong. But people will drink the water. I can never make out
why. It seems such a simple thing to tell them to put a bottle
of Seltzer water in your bedroom. That's all the precaution I've
ever taken, and I've been in every part of the world, I may say
&mdash;Italy a dozen times over. . . . But young people always
think they know better, and then they pay the penalty. Poor thing
&mdash;I am very sorry for her." But the difficulty of peering
into a dish of potatoes and helping herself engrossed her attention.</p>

<p>Arthur and Susan both secretly hoped that the subject was now
disposed of, for there seemed to them something unpleasant in
this discussion. But Evelyn was not ready to let it drop. Why
would people never talk about the things that mattered?</p>

<p>"I don't believe you care a bit!" she said, turning savagely
upon Mr. Perrott, who had sat all this time in silence.</p>

<p>"I? Oh, yes, I do," he answered awkwardly, but with obvious sincerity.
Evelyn's questions made him too feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"It seems so inexplicable," Evelyn continued. "Death, I mean.
Why should she be dead, and not you or I? It was only a fortnight
ago that she was here with the rest of us. What d'you believe?"
she demanded of Mr. Perrott. "D'you believe that things go on,
that she's still somewhere&mdash;or d'you think it's simply a game&mdash;we
crumble up to nothing when we die? I'm positive Rachel's not dead."</p>

<p>Mr. Perrott would have said almost anything that Evelyn wanted
him to say, but to assert that he believed in the immortality
of the soul was not in his power. He sat silent, more deeply wrinkled
than usual, crumbling his bread.</p>

<p>Lest Evelyn should next ask him what he believed, Arthur, after
making a pause equivalent to a full stop, started a completely
different topic.</p>

<p>"Supposing," he said, "a man were to write and tell you that
he wanted five pounds because he had known your grandfather, what
would you do? It was this way. My grandfather&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Invented a stove," said Evelyn. "I know all about that. We had
one in the conservatory to keep the plants warm."</p>

<p>"Didn't know I was so famous," said Arthur. "Well," he continued,
determined at all costs to spin his story out at length, "the
old chap, being about the second best inventor of his day, and
a capable lawyer too, died, as they always do, without making
a will. Now Fielding, his clerk, with how much justice I don't
know, always claimed that he meant to do something for him. The
poor old boy's come down in the world through trying inventions
on his own account, lives in Penge over a tobacconist's shop.
I've been to see him there. The question is&mdash;must I stump up or
not? What does the abstract spirit of justice require, Perrott?
Remember, I didn't benefit under my grandfather's will, and I've
no way of testing the truth of the story."</p>

<p>"I don't know much about the abstract spirit of justice," said
Susan, smiling complacently at the others, "but I'm certain of
one thing&mdash;he'll get his five pounds!"</p>

<p>As Mr. Perrott proceeded to deliver an opinion, and Evelyn insisted
that he was much too stingy, like all lawyers, thinking of the
letter and not of the spirit, while Mrs. Paley required to be
kept informed between the courses as to what they were all saying,
the luncheon passed with no interval of silence, and Arthur congratulated
himself upon the tact with which the discussion had been smoothed
over.</p>

<p>As they left the room it happened that Mrs. Paley's wheeled chair
ran into the Elliots, who were coming through the door, as she
was going out. Brought thus to a standstill for a moment, Arthur
and Susan congratulated Hughling Elliot upon his convalescence,&mdash;he
was down, cadaverous enough, for the first time,&mdash;and Mr. Perrott
took occasion to say a few words in private to Evelyn.</p>

<p>"Would there be any chance of seeing you this afternoon, about
three-thirty say? I shall be in the garden, by the fountain."</p>

<p>The block dissolved before Evelyn answered. But as she left them
in the hall, she looked at him brightly and said, "Half-past three,
did you say? That'll suit me."</p>

<p>She ran upstairs with the feeling of spiritual exaltation and
quickened life which the prospect of an emotional scene always
aroused in her. That Mr. Perrott was again about to propose to
her, she had no doubt, and she was aware that on this occasion
she ought to be prepared with a definite answer, for she was going
away in three days' time. But she could not bring her mind to
bear upon the question. To come to a decision was very difficult
to her, because she had a natural dislike of anything final and
done with; she liked to go on and on&mdash;always on and on. She was
leaving, and, therefore, she occupied herself in laying her clothes
out side by side upon the bed. She observed that some were very
shabby. She took the photograph of her father and mother, and,
before she laid it away in her box, she held it for a minute in
her hand. Rachel had looked at it. Suddenly the keen feeling of
some one's personality, which things that they have owned or handled
sometimes preserves, overcame her; she felt Rachel in the room
with her; it was as if she were on a ship at sea, and the life
of the day was as unreal as the land in the distance. But by degrees
the feeling of Rachel's presence passed away, and she could no
longer realise her, for she had scarcely known her. But this momentary
sensation left her depressed and fatigued. What had she done with
her life? What future was there before her? What was make-believe,
and what was real? Were these proposals and intimacies and adventures
real, or was the contentment which she had seen on the faces of
Susan and Rachel more real than anything she had ever felt?</p>

<p>She made herself ready to go downstairs, absentmindedly, but
her fingers were so well trained that they did the work of preparing
her almost of their own accord. When she was actually on the way
downstairs, the blood began to circle through her body of its
own accord too, for her mind felt very dull.</p>

<p>Mr. Perrott was waiting for her. Indeed, he had gone straight
into the garden after luncheon, and had been walking up and down
the path for more than half an hour, in a state of acute suspense.</p>

<p>"I'm late as usual!" she exclaimed, as she caught sight of him.
"Well, you must forgive me; I had to pack up. . . . My word! It
looks stormy! And that's a new steamer in the bay, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She looked at the bay, in which a steamer was just dropping anchor,
the smoke still hanging about it, while a swift black shudder
ran through the waves. "One's quite forgotten what rain looks
like," she added.</p>

<p>But Mr. Perrott paid no attention to the steamer or to the weather.</p>

<p>"Miss Murgatroyd," he began with his usual formality, "I asked
you to come here from a very selfish motive, I fear. I do not
think you need to be assured once more of my feelings; but, as
you are leaving so soon, I felt that I could not let you go without
asking you to tell me&mdash;have I any reason to hope that you will
ever come to care for me?"</p>

<p>He was very pale, and seemed unable to say any more.</p>

<p>The little gush of vitality which had come into Evelyn as she
ran downstairs had left her, and she felt herself impotent. There
was nothing for her to say; she felt nothing. Now that he was
actually asking her, in his elderly gentle words, to marry him,
she felt less for him than she had ever felt before.</p>

<p>"Let's sit down and talk it over," she said rather unsteadily.</p>

<p>Mr. Perrott followed her to a curved green seat under a tree.
They looked at the fountain in front of them, which had long ceased
to play. Evelyn kept looking at the fountain instead of thinking
of what she was saying; the fountain without any water seemed
to be the type of her own being.</p>

<p>"Of course I care for you," she began, rushing her words out
in a hurry; "I should be a brute if I didn't. I think you're quite
one of the nicest people I've ever known, and one of the finest
too. But I wish . . . I wish you didn't care for me in that way.
Are you sure you do?" For the moment she honestly desired that
he should say no.</p>

<p>"Quite sure," said Mr. Perrott.</p>

<p>"You see, I'm not as simple as most women," Evelyn continued.
"I think I want more. I don't know exactly what I feel."</p>

<p>He sat by her, watching her and refraining from speech.</p>

<p>"I sometimes think I haven't got it in me to care very much for
one person only. Some one else would make you a better wife. I
can imagine you very happy with some one else."</p>

<p>"If you think that there is any chance that you will come to
care for me, I am quite content to wait," said Mr. Perrott.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;there's no hurry, is there?" said Evelyn. "Suppose I thought
it over and wrote and told you when I get back? I'm going to Moscow;
I'll write from Moscow."</p>

<p>But Mr. Perrott persisted.</p>

<p>"You cannot give me any kind of idea. I do not ask for a date
. . . that would be most unreasonable." He paused, looking down
at the gravel path.</p>

<p>As she did not immediately answer, he went on.</p>

<p>"I know very well that I am not&mdash;that I have not much to offer
you either in myself or in my circumstances. And I forget; it
cannot seem the miracle to you that it does to me. Until I met
you I had gone on in my own quiet way&mdash;we are both very quiet
people, my sister and <em>I&mdash;</em>quite content with my lot. My
friendship with Arthur was the most important thing in my life.
Now that I know you, all that has changed. You seem to put such
a spirit into everything. Life seems to hold so many possibilities
that I had never dreamt of."</p>

<p>"That's splendid!" Evelyn exclaimed, grasping his hand. "Now
you'll go back and start all kinds of things and make a great
name in the world; and we'll go on being friends, whatever happens
. . . we'll be great friends, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Evelyn!" he moaned suddenly, and took her in his arms, and kissed
her. She did not resent it, although it made little impression
on her.</p>

<p>As she sat upright again, she said, "I never see why one shouldn't
go on being friends&mdash;though some people do. And friendships do
make a difference, don't they? They are the kind of things that
matter in one's life?"</p>

<p>He looked at her with a bewildered expression as if he did not
really understand what she was saying. With a considerable effort
he collected himself, stood up, and said, "Now I think I have
told you what I feel, and I will only add that I can wait as long
as ever you wish."</p>

<p>Left alone, Evelyn walked up and down the path. What did matter
than? What was the meaning of it all?</p>
