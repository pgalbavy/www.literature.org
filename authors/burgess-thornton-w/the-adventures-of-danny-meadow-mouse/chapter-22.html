<p><em>DANNY </em>is so used to narrow escapes that he doesn’t waste
any time thinking about them. He didn’t this time. "He who tries
to look two ways at once is pretty sure to see nothing," says
Danny, and he knew that if he thought too much about the things
that had already happened, he couldn’t keep a sharp watch for
the things that might happen.</p>

<p>Nothing more happened as he hurried along his private little
path to the edge of a great patch of grass so short that he couldn’t
hide under it. He had got to cross this, and all the way he would
be in plain sight of any one who happened to be near. Very cautiously
he peeped out and looked this way and looked that way, not forgetting
to look up in the sky. He could see no one anywhere. Drawing a
long breath, Danny started across the open place as fast as his
short legs could take him.</p>

<p>[Illustration: With another frightened squeak, Danny dived into
the opening just in time. <em>Page 107.</em>]</p>

<p>Now all the time, Redtail the Hawk had been sitting in a tree
some distance away, sitting so still that he looked like a part
of the tree itself. That is why Danny hadn’t seen him. But Redtail
saw Danny the instant he started across the open place, for Redtail’s
eyes are very keen, and he can see a great distance. With a satisfied
chuckle, he spread his broad wings and started after Danny.</p>

<p>Just about half-way to the safety of the long grass on the other
side, Danny gave a hurried look behind him, and his heart seemed
to jump right into his mouth, for there was Redtail with his cruel
claws already set to seize him! Danny gave a frightened squeak,
for he thought that surely this time he would be caught. But he
didn’t mean to give up without trying to escape. Three jumps ahead
of him was a queer looking thing. He didn’t know what it was,
but if there was a hole in it he might yet fool Redtail.</p>

<p>One jump! Would he be able to reach it? Two jumps! There <em>was</em>
a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened squeak, Danny
dived into the opening just in time. And what do you think he
was in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown’s boy had once used
to carry bait in when he went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He
had dropped it there on his way home.</p>

<p>Redtail screamed with rage and disappointment as he struck the
old can with his great claws. He had been sure, very sure of Danny
Meadow Mouse this time! He tried to pick the can up, but he couldn’t
get hold of it. It just rolled away from him every time, try as
he would. Finally, in disgust, he gave up and flew back to the
tree from which he had first seen Danny.</p>

<p>Of course Danny had been terribly frightened when the can rolled,
and by the noise the claws of Redtail made when they struck his
queer hiding-place. But he wisely decided that the best thing
he could do was to stay there for a while. And it was very fortunate
that he did so, as he was very soon to find out.</p>
