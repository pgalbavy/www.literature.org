<p><em>I WAS </em>passing through the waiting-room of the <em>Morning
Journal</em> on a certain evening last year when my attention
was drawn to a man seated in a corner. He was dressed in black
and his appearance was that of the deepest dejection. In fact
upon his face I read the most melancholy despair.</p>

<p>He was not weeping, his eyes were dry and almost expressionless
and received the impression of exterior objects like motionless
ice. He had placed upon his knees a small oaken chest, ornamented
with ironwork. His hands were crossed over this object and hung
down, accentuating his dejected appearance.</p>

<p>An attendant told me that he had been awaiting my arrival there
three long hours without a movement, without so much as a sigh.
I went towards him, and announcing myself, I invited him to enter
my office. I showed him a seat, but instead of taking it he came
straight to my writing-desk and placed the little oaken chest
on it. "Sir, this chest belongs to you," said he, and his voice
seemed far away and indistinct. "My friend, M. Théophraste Longuet,
commissioned me to bring it to you. Take it, sir, and believe
me, your servant." As he spoke the man bowed and made a motion
toward the door. I stopped him, however, and said: "Why, do not
go, I cannot receive this box without a knowledge of its contents."
He replied: "Sir, I do not know what it contains, it is locked
and its key is lost. You might have to break it open to find out
the contents." I replied: "Then at least I would like to know
to whom I am indebted for bringing it to me."</p>

<p>"My friend, M. Théophraste Longuet, called me Adolphe," replied
the man, in a voice so melancholy that it seemed to grow more
faint and indistinct with each syllable.</p>

<p>"Well, if M. Longuet had brought me the chest himself, he would
most certainly have told me what it contains; I expect that M.
Longuet, himself."</p>

<p>"I also, sir," said the man, "but M. Théophraste Longuet is dead,
and I am his sole executor."</p>

<p>By this time he had edged his way to the door, and having said
these words, he opened the door and departed. I was taken back
by this sudden move and stood staring at the door, then at the
chest. Collecting myself I hastily followed the man, but could
find no trace of him... he had disappeared.</p>

<p>Opening the chest I found it contained a bundle of papers, which
at first I regarded with indifference, but which I presently began
to examine with greater interest. The deeper I penetrated the
more mysterious they appeared to be and the more unexpected were
the adventures revealed. In fact, so strange did they seem that
I at first could not believe my intelligence, and if the proof
had not been in front of me I never would have been convinced
of their reality.</p>

<p>It was some time before I could bring myself to realize my position
regarding these papers. M. Théophraste Longuet had made me heir
to this chest and to the mysteries lying therein. In fact, the
secrets of his life.</p>

<p>These papers were written in the form of memoirs and were voluminous.
They related with the minutest detail, all the incidents of an
exceptionally dramatic existence. M. Théophraste Longuet had by
the discovery of a document two centuries old acquired the proof
that Louis Dominique Cartouche, the most cunning criminal in the
annals of French crime, and he, Théophraste, were one and the
same person. This was indeed a most startling discovery and valuable,
for it also put me on the track of the treasures of the famous
Cartouche.</p>

<p>He had frequently confided in me facts about his peculiar life,
but an untimely death, certain terrible events related in these
documents, had prevented him from telling me all. We had been
great friends. I had written for a journal he had called his "favorite
organ." He had chosen me as his companion and confidant from among
many other journalists, not because of any superiority of intellect,
but rather, as he used to say, "because a reliable level-headed
friend is worth twenty acquaintances, and he found me reliable."
There was much significance in this word, "level-headed," as you
will learn as you read this narrative.</p>

<p>Having thoroughly examined the papers, I immediately took them
to my manager, who was a keen business man. He did not hesitate
for a moment to find the "Treasures of Cartouche" a valuable piece
for his paper, and it is now a matter of common knowledge how
curiously the sum of twenty-five thousand francs, divided into
seven sums, were hidden in and around Paris, and how the author
of these lines in the history of the chest which appeared in print
in the month of October, in the year 1903, * touched lightly upon
the story found therein.</p>

<p>* This date is very important, for it established the fact that
my authentic history of Cartouche had appeared before Mr. Frank
Brentano’s book, and that one two books the day after that of
Mr. Maurice Bernard.</p>

<p>I have believed it my duty toward the public, and also to the
memory of Théophraste Longuet, to publish in volume the authentic
history of the reincarnation of Cartouche, written exclusively
from the documents found in the little oaken chest, a plain narrative,
unembellished by all that which I, poor journalist, had added
for the chance reader of my journal.</p>

<p>The reader will find more than a mere treasure. The documents
are of the greatest literary value, inasmuch as they contain proof
of things hitherto only dreamt of. It is certain that many people
imagining themselves of superior intellect will doubt and possibly
scoff at many of these mysteries.</p>

<p>The oaken chest contained the secret of the tomb; it also contained
the history of the Talpa people written by no less an authority
than M. Milfroid, Commissioner of Police, who remained for three
weeks with M. Théophraste Longuet in the subterranean home of
those monsters. This last infernal comedy would most certainly
have met with incredulity had not it been vented by one of the
most honest and intellectual of Police Commissioners. M. Milfroid
was a most noble and accomplished character, and he could place
music, painting, sculptors among his accomplishments.</p>

<p>Now before closing this preface I must warn my readers that they
will find many strange things in the narrative, weird and almost
supernatural. And I would say that unless he is possessed with
great level-headedness, he must not read the secrets of the Life
of Théophraste Longuet.</p>
