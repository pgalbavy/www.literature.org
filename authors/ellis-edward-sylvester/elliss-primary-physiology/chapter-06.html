<p>Few boys and girls take proper care of their teeth. All of us
admire a set of strong, sound, even, white teeth, and those who
do not have such, will tell how sorry they are because in youth
they were so careless that their teeth were ruined.</p>

<p>The teeth should be carefully cleaned each morning before breakfast.
This is best done with a good brush, Castile soap, and lukewarm
water. Use none of the numerous tooth-powders sold, and never
pick your teeth with a metallic substance. Quill, wooden, or ivory
tooth-picks only should be employed.</p>

<p>When the brush does not remove the stains from the teeth, the
soft end of a small stick, covered with powdered charcoal will
answer, though it should not be used often.</p>

<em>INJURIES TO THE TEETH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Very hot or cold food, or water, sweetmeats and acids injure
the teeth. Children sometimes like to show the strength of their
teeth by cracking hickory-nuts and other hard substances. This
should never be done, as the nuts and substances may prove stronger
than the teeth. The teeth are made of a soft kind of bone, covered
with enamel. The bone part of the teeth soon decays if the enamel
is broken.</p>

<p>
<em>TWO SETS OF TEETH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The first set of teeth, twenty in number, gradually become loose
after a child is five or six years old, and the second set, thirty-two
in number, crowds after them. The second are the teeth which are
meant to last all our life-time, and they should be guarded, therefore,
with the utmost care.</p>

<p>Sometimes the second teeth crowd so closely that the first become
wedged in place. The old tooth should be removed, just as soon
as the second can be discovered pushing after it. If this is not
done, the mouth will be filled with crooked and unsightly teeth.</p>

<p>[Illustration:</p>

<p>  <em>THE PRINCIPAL TEETH</em>.]</p>

<p>The mother or father of any boy or girl will readily draw a loose
tooth, by means of a looped thread. Often, however, a brave child
will pull his own teeth, without help. Be on the watch and clear
the way for the second teeth. If you don't you will be sorry all
your life.</p>

<p>Some children have poorer teeth than others, and the utmost care
will not save them from decay. When the first speck appears, go
to the dentist. Dentistry has made such improvements during the
last few years, that the poorest teeth can be made to last a long
time.</p>

<p>  What is said of boys and girls?</p>

<p>  When and how often should the teeth be cleaned? What should
be used   for that purpose? What is said of tooth-powders and
tooth-picks?</p>

<p>  How may stains be removed from the teeth?</p>

<p>  What substances injure the teeth? What about cracking nuts
and other   hard substances with the teeth?</p>

<p>  How many teeth has a child? A man? When do the second teeth
begin to   appear? How long is it intended they should last?</p>

<p>  What sometimes takes place? What should be done? What will
follow if   this advice is not heeded?</p>

<p>  How are loose teeth generally pulled? Have you ever known of
a boy   or girl pulling his or her own teeth? What must you watch
for and   do? Is there any need of such care?</p>

<p>  What is said of some children? When should you go to the dentist?</p>
