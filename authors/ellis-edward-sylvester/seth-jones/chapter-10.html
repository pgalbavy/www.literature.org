<p>So sudden, so unexpected, so astounding was the crash of Seth’s
tomahawk through the head of the doomed savage, that, for a moment
after, not an Indian moved or spoke. The head was nearly cleft
in twain (for an arm fired by consuming passion had driven it),
and the brains were spattered over numbers of those seated around.
Seth himself stood a second, as if to satisfy himself that the
work was complete, when he turned, walked to his seat, sat down,
coolly folded his arms, and <em>commenced whistling</em>!</p>

<p>A second after, nearly every savage drew a deep breath, as if
a load had been removed from his heart; then each looked at his
neighbor, and in the scowling, ridged brows, the glittering eyes,
the distorted visages, the strained breathing through the set
teeth, could be read the fearful intention. Every face but that
of the chieftain’s, was livid with fury. He alone sat perfectly
unagitated. Three Indians arose, and, grasping their knives, stood
before him waiting for the expected words.</p>

<p>"Touch him not," said he, with a shake of the head; "him, no
right here."</p>

<p>As the chief spoke, he tapped his forehead significantly with
his finger, meaning that the prisoner was demented. The others
believed the same, still it was hard to quell the pent-up fire
which was scorching their breasts. But his word was law inviolate,
and without a murmur, they seated themselves upon the ground again.</p>

<p>Seth, although his eye appeared vacant and unmeaning, had noted
all these movements with the keenness of the eagle. He knew that
a word or sign from the chief would be sufficient to hack him
into a thousand pieces. When he stood before his inhuman tormentor,
with the keen tomahawk in his hand, the certainty of instant death
or prolonged torture would not have prevented him taking the savage
vengeance he did. Now that it was over, he was himself again.
His natural feelings came back, and with it the natural desire
for life. The words of the chief convinced him that he was regarded
as either insane or idiotic, and consequently as not deserving
death. Still, although saved for the present, he ever stood in
imminent peril. The fallen savage had living friends, who would
seize the first opportunity to avenge his death. At any rate,
let matters stand as they might, Seth felt that he was in hot
quarters, and the safest course was to get out of them as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>It was perhaps ten minutes after the horrid deed, that the savages
commenced bestirring themselves. Several arose and carried their
comrade to one side, while the others commenced preparations for
taking up the day’s march. At this moment, the runners who had
pursued Graham to the water’s edge, returned, and the tragical
occurrence was soon made known to them. A perfect battery of deadly
gleaming eyes was opened upon Seth, but he stood it unflinchingly.
The Indians would have relished well the idea of venting their
baffled vengeance upon the helpless captive in their hands; but
the commanding presence of their chief restrained the slightest
demonstration, and they contented themselves with meaning looks.</p>

<p>One thing did not escape Seth’s notice from the first, and it
was an occasion of wonder and speculation to him. Nothing could
be seen of Ina. In fact, the appearance of things was such as
to lead one to believe that the savages knew nothing of her. Could
it be that he and Graham had been mistaken in the party? Could
some other tribe have made off with her? Or, had they separated,
and taken her in an other direction? As he ruminated upon these
questions, he became convinced that the last suggested the certain
answer. They could not have mistaken the party, as they had never
lost sight of the trail since taking it; and, moreover, he had
noticed several slight occurrences, since his advent among them,
that satisfied him, beyond a doubt, of the identity of the party
with the one which had descended upon the home of the woodman.
From the caution which the aggressors evidenced in their flight,
together with the haste in which it had been conducted; it was
plain they had some fears of pursuit; and to guard their treasure,
a number had left them at a favorable point, intending to join
the main body where pursuit was not to be expected, or where the
pursuers had been sufficiently misled to warrant it. As he reflected,
Seth was satisfied that this was the only and the true explanation
of her non-appearance at this time.</p>

<p>The preparations were soon completed, and the Indians commenced
moving forward. If Seth had entertained any doubts of their intentions
relating to him, they were soon dispelled by his experience. It
was not at all likely that he would be reserved as a prisoner,
unless they intended to put him to some use. Accordingly, he found
himself loaded down with an enormous burden, consisting mostly
of food, in the shape of deer’s meat, which the savages had brought
with them. They buried their fallen comrade, without the ceremony
and mourning which might be expected. The North American Indian
rarely gives way to his emotions, except upon such occasions as
the burial of one of their number, a "war dance," or something
similar, when the whole nest of devilish passions is allowed free
vent. They indulged in no such ceremonies&mdash;if ceremonies they
may be called&mdash;at this time. A comparatively shallow grave was
dug, and into this the fallen one was placed in an upright position,
his face turned toward the east. His rifle, knives, and all his
clothing were buried with him.</p>

<p>The day was a suffocating one in August, and Seth’s sufferings
were truly great. He was naturally lithe, wiry, and capable of
enduring prolonged exertion; but, unfortunately for him, the savages
had become aware of this and had loaded him accordingly. Most
of the journey was through the forest, where the arching tree-tops,
shut out the withering rays of the sun. Had they encountered any
such open plains, as the one passed over, near their encampment,
Seth would have never lived to survive it. As it was, his load
nearly made him insensible to pain. A consuming thirst was ever
tormenting him, although he found abundant means to slake it in
the numberless rills which gurgled through the wilderness.</p>

<p>"How Yankee like it?" grinned a savage, by his side, stooping
and peering fiendishly into his face.</p>

<p>"First rate; goes nice. Say, you, s’posen you try it?"</p>

<p>"Ugh! walk faster," and a whack accompanied the word.</p>

<p>"Now, I cac’late I’m going to walk just about as fast as I darned
please, and if you ain’t a mind to wait, you can heave ahead.
Fact, by gracious."</p>

<p>And Seth did not increase his steps in the least. Toward noon,
he found he should be obliged to have a short rest or give out
entirely. He knew it would be useless to ask, and consequently
he determined to take it without asking. So, unloosing the cords
which bound the pack to his back, he let it fall to the ground,
and, seating himself upon it, again went to whistling!</p>

<p>"Go faster, Yankee&mdash;you no keep up," exclaimed one, giving him
a stunning blow.</p>

<p>"See here, you, p’raps you don’t know who it mought be you insulted
in that way. I’m Seth Jones, from New Hampshire, and consequently
you’ll be keerful of tetching me."</p>

<p>The savage addressed, was upon the point of striking him insolently
to the earth, when the chieftain interfered.</p>

<p>"No touch pale face&mdash;him tired&mdash;rest a little."</p>

<p>Some unaccountable whim had possessed the savage, as this mercy
was entirely unexpected by Seth, and he knew not how to account
for it, unless it might be he was reserving him for some horrible
torture.</p>

<p>The resting spell was but a breathing moment, however, and just
as Seth had begun to really enjoy it, the chieftain gave orders
for the replacement of the load. Seth felt disposed to tamper
awhile, for the sake of prolonging his enjoyment, but, on second
thought, concluded it the better plan not to cross the chief who
had been so lenient to him thus far. So, with a considerable number
of original remarks, and much disputation about the placing of
the burden, he shouldered it at last and trudged forward.</p>

<p>Seth was right in his conjectures about Ina. Toward the latter
part of the day, the three Indians who had been pursued by our
other friends, rejoined the main party, bearing her with them.
She noticed her companion in captivity at once, but no communication
passed between them. A look of melancholy relief escaped her as
she became assured that her parents were still safe, and that
only she and her new friend were left to the sufferings and horrors
of captivity. But there was enough in this to damp even such a
young and hopeful spirit as was hers. Not death alone, but a fate
from the sensuous captors, far worse than death itself, was to
be apprehended. In the future, there was but one Hand that could
sustain and safely deliver them, and to that One she looked for
deliverance.</p>
