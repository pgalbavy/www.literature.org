<p>Good fortune attended the daring attempt of Brinton Kingsland. 
By a providential occurrence, most of the hostiles were on the
side of the supply camp, in the direction of the ridge from whose
crest the signal smoke was ascending, when the youth, dexterously
guiding his pony through the waggons that surrounded him, quickly
cleared himself of all obstacles.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, old boy, do your best!  Never was there greater need
of it."</p>

<p>The intelligent creature thrust his nose forward, and was off
like a shot.  He knew what was wanted, and nobly responded to
the call upon his fleetness.  The teamsters forgot all about the
Indians, and fixed their gaze upon the youth.</p>

<p>He was fully a hundred yards from camp before the Sioux comprehended
what was done.  Then, when they saw the messenger dashing over
the plain, fully a dozen of the best mounted were after him in
a flash, discharging several of their guns at the moment of starting.</p>

<p>Brinton was seen to thunder up the incline of the first swell,
sitting firmly in his saddle, and instantly disappeared over the
crest.  A minute later, the foremost two of the pursuers skimmed
up the same incline, just as the lad shot into sight on the summit
of the next elevation, instantly whisking out of view over that,
while his superb horse continued his arrowy flight toward Wounded
Knee. Then the excited and hopeful teamsters could see no more,
and all but the foremost two of the pursuers gave up the chase
and came straggling back to join their comrades in the attack
on the camp. They knew that the result of that flight of the messenger
would be to bring help, and, if anything was to be accomplished,
it must be before it could arrive.</p>

<p>And so the attack on the camp was begun at once, and with a fierceness
that speedily brought a crisis.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brinton Kingsland was going with undiminished speed
over the prairie, skimming up the inclines and down the slopes
at a break-neck pace, with every nerve of his splendid steed strained
to the highest.  The rider heard the dull report of the rifles
that were fired at him, but the distance was too great to cause
alarm, and he did not even hear the singing of the bullets, so
wide went they of the mark; but the glance cast over his shoulder
showed that he had only two pursuers to fear.</p>

<p>It was easy to compare their speed with his, and less than a
half-mile was passed, when all doubt vanished.  They had been
thrown a hundred paces to the rear and were losing ground every
minute.</p>

<p>At the instant of shooting up one of the slopes and disappearing
over the crest, Brinton snatched off his cap and swung it over
his head, with a joyous shout.</p>

<p>"Hurrah, Jack! they're not in it with you; you can take it more
easily now."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the speed of the pony was maintained for a brief
while, until it became certain that his two pursuers had given
up the attempt to overtake him, and had gone to wreak their fury
on the imperilled teamsters before help could reach them.  Then
Brinton made Jack drop to a pace which he could continue for hours
without fatigue.  The youth knew the course to follow to reach
the camp at Wounded Knee Creek, and he calculated that he could
readily cover the ground in the course of an hour or so.</p>

<p>He was too sensible, however, to imagine that an open and uninterrupted
course lay before him.  At that time, as the reader well knows,
the country in the neighbourhood of the Bad Lands, the reservations
and the space between, was overrun with hostiles, as eager as
so many jungle tigers to slay settlers, small squads of soldiers,
and all white people whom it was safe to attack.  He was liable
to encounter some of these bands at any moment, and only by continual
vigilance could he avoid running into the cunningly laid traps
which proved fatal to scores of others.</p>

<p>Now that the burst of excitement was over, and he was riding
at a less killing pace, his thoughts went back to the loved ones
from whom he had been so strangely separated.  His heart became
as lead as he reflected that they could hardly have escaped, considering
the condition of his father, from the environing perils which
covered miles of territory in every direction.</p>

<p>"If I only knew where they were, if alive, I would guide this
escort from Wounded Knee to their help&#11834;"</p>

<p>What was that?  Surely he heard the report of guns from some
point in advance.  Jack pricked his ears and increased his pace.</p>

<p>"It can have but one meaning," muttered Brinton, with a throbbing
heart; "someone is in peril: can it be <em>they</em>?"</p>

<p>He reined up his pony and stood still on the crest of the first
elevation he reached, after the ominous sounds fell on his ears.</p>

<p>At that moment he descried coming over another ridge, a furlong
away, a troop of thirty or forty cavalry, riding at a gallop toward
him.</p>

<p>"That's the escort from Wounded Knee," was his instant conclusion;
"I was right when I told Captain Wadsworth that Nick Jackson said
the escort was on the way, though I wasn't certain of it."</p>

<p>But evidently the firing had not come from the cavalry.  It was
from some point between, and, instead of being directly in front,
as it first seemed, was off to the right, where he observed a
depression, with several dismounted Indians crouching around it.</p>

<p>"Great heavens! it's father fighting them off," he gasped; "he
is in that hollow and they have attacked him!"</p>

<p>He struck his heels against the ribs of Jack, fiercely jerked
the bridle-rein, and shouted to him to run at his best straight
for the spot.</p>

<p>But the approaching cavalry had descried the same thing, and
were nearer the hollow than was the youth.  They turned the heads
of the horses and struck off at full speed.</p>

<p>The assailing Indians, too, had discovered their danger and were
seen skurrying for their ponies, waiting near.  The obedient animals
turned until their masters sprang upon their backs, when they
dashed off at full speed, with a single exception.  One of them,
forgetful of his danger or determined upon revenge, even at the
cost of his life, was observed to have something in his arms as
he held his ground.</p>

<p>"It is Edith that he is about to slay; maybe he has already killed
her!  O heaven!" the brother groaned, "is it too late to save
her?"</p>

<p>Jack was tearing over the ground at a killing pace, but he could
not reach them in time.  He could carry his rider there in time
to shoot down the Indian, but not soon enough to prevent his burying
his knife in the innocent heart.</p>

<p>But there was a wonderful sharpshooter among the cavalry.  He
saw the awful peril, and throwing his horse on his haunches, brought
his gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>During the instant it was at a level, Hugh Kingsland dashed out
of the hollow, bare-headed, and, with hair streaming, ran toward
the Indian and his little girl.  One pace behind him sped his
wife; she was seen to make quick, earnest gestures to the approaching
horsemen, and they thought it an appeal to them not to lose a
second if they would save her child.</p>

<p>At that instant the sharpshooter pressed the trigger of his weapon;
the Indian dropped the little one, threw up his arms in an aimless
way, staggered back and sank to the ground.</p>

<p>The next minute the troop thundered up, Brinton almost among
them.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt, my darling Edith?" he called, leaping out of the
saddle, catching her in his arms, pressing her to his heart and
kissing her; "speak! did he hurt you?"</p>

<p>The child was bewildered by the great confusion, and, without
answering her brother, looked him affrightedly in the face.</p>

<p>"Why, Brint, is that you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; heaven be praised, you are not harmed!  Oh, how can
I be thankful enough?  And you, father and mother! what a blessed
sight!"</p>

<p>The mother gave him one grateful glance and then knelt by the
fallen Indian, just as Edith, slipping from the grasp of her brother,
ran to the prostrate figure and bent over it, asking in a voice
of inexpressible tenderness&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Wolf Ear?"</p>

<p>The young Ogalalla lay on his back, but at the moment the child
spoke he managed, by a great effort, to raise his head and rest
it on his hand.  He had not spoken, but now, fixing his dark eyes
on Edith, said in a faint voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Wolf Ear is hurt!"</p>

<p>The troopers sat silent on their horses, looking down on the
strange scene.  Hugh Kingsland, with no trace of his illness,
stood back a few paces with folded arms, gazing at the moving
sight and trying in vain to restrain his emotions.  His wife placed
her arm under the head of the Ogalalla, and, resting it on her
knee, smoothed the black hair from his forehead, murmuring words
of sympathy; Edith covered her face with her hands, and sobbed
with a breaking heart.</p>

<p>Brinton was affected at the sight of his former friend, but he
could not help saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mother, we can all pity him, but he was our enemy; and had he
not been shot at that moment Edith would not be living now."</p>

<p>"You are wrong, my son," she replied gently.  "Wolf Ear came
forward to save Edith."</p>

<p>"What are you saying?"</p>

<p>"He was with the party that attacked us; he did what he could
to restrain them; he could not do so, and he ran forward to join
and help us defend ourselves against them.  Edith saw him first
and hurried out to meet him; he caught her up, and, when his companions
would have harmed her, he would not let them touch her.  He shouted
to us to have no fear, that he was our friend.  At that moment
the soldiers came in sight and the other Indians made off.  Wolf
Ear knew we were saved, and so he stood still, with Edith's arms
around his neck.  I saw one of the soldiers aiming at them with
his gun; husband and I ran out to shield him.  I shouted and motioned
to the soldier not to shoot, but he did not understand me, and&mdash;this
is the sad result of the dreadful mistake."</p>

<p>Wolf Ear fixed his eyes upon the wondering Brinton, who, walking
forward and stooping down, asked in a choking voice&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is all this true, Wolf Ear?"</p>

<p>"The words of your mother are true."</p>

<p>"But what meant your course toward me yesterday?  I cannot reconcile
that with what I have just heard."</p>

<p>"We parted friends, though I told you I was the enemy of the
rest of your race.  From the time we separated I have done all
I could to find your people and save them before it was too late. 
Until now, I have not met you."</p>

<p>"You forget; we met in the gorge last night, and only this morning,
when you sought the life of Nick Jackson, I chased you over the
ridge in the effort to make you prisoner."</p>

<p>A smile overspread the dark face, and the head swayed a single
time to one side.</p>

<p>"Brinton, you are mistaken; the Ogalalla whom you met, as you
say, in the gully, and whom you sought to make prisoner, was not
<em>I&mdash;</em>he was my twin brother, Young Bear; our mother can
hardly tell us apart, and I taught him to speak English as well
as I."</p>

<p>"Oh, what have I done!" wailed Brinton, breaking down utterly,
and covering his face with his hands.  "I never dreamed of this;
can you forgive this dreadful mistake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wolf Ear faintly, "I forgive you; I forgive the soldier
who shot me, for he did it to save <em>her</em> life."</p>

<p>He wearily closed his eyes, but opened them again when he felt
the chubby arms of Edith clasped round his neck, and her lips
pressed against his.</p>

<p>"Oh, Wolf Ear!" she sobbed, in tones that brought tears to more
than one eye among the bronzed troopers, "do not die!  I love
you, next to Brint and papa and mamma&#11834;"</p>

<p>Among the silent troopers touched by the scene was the sharpshooter
who had brought Wolf Ear low.  He was a brave, rugged soldier,
but, like most men, had a tender heart.  He had not spoken for
some minutes, and his eyes were moist as he swung his foot from
his stirrup and over the haunch of his horse to the ground.</p>

<p>"Jim Budworth don't often make a miss," he said in a broken voice,
"and I didn't miss this fellow; but then I didn't aim to kill
him, and I don't believe I did.  I know a little about surgery
myself&mdash;so let me take a look at Wolf Ear, as you call him."</p>

<p>Wondering at the words of the sharpshooter, and hardly daring
to hope he was right, all watched him as he made what may be called
a medical examination of the sufferer.  The bullet had struck
him in the side, and evidently had inflicted the wound intended.</p>

<p>"Injins are tough," remarked Budworth, "and this one is as tough
as the rest.  He isn't going to die.  Here, Wolf Ear, try this."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the trooper held a flask of spirits to the lips
of the young Indian and forced him to swallow some of it.  It
produced an immediate effect; and, to the astonishment of everyone,
Wolf Ear assumed a sitting position and looked round with a smile.</p>

<p>"I feel better&mdash;much better, thank you," he said, with a grateful
look at Budworth.</p>

<p>"Of course you do.  It was a narrow chance for you, no mistake;
but all you want is careful nursing, and I reckon Mrs. Kingsland
here will be glad to give it you."</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," said the delighted woman; "there is nothing
that I will not do for Wolf Ear.  Can it be possible that he is
going to get well after all?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is; I know all about Injins."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad!" exclaimed the happy Edith, throwing her arms
again about his neck.</p>

<p>"Easy now, easy now," said Budworth; "don't go to rolling and
tumbling him about until he gets a little stronger.  After that
you can handle him as you choose."</p>

<p>Wolf Ear rallied with amazing quickness, and showed all the heroism
of his race, when he was helped upon his horse and the party moved
back to the supply camp, where the teamsters had succeeded in
driving off the hostiles.</p>

<p>The Indian was given an easy, comfortable couch in one of the
waggons, and some hours later the party arrived at Wounded Knee.
There the sufferer received the best of medical attention, and
was soon able to move about with scarcely any pain or trouble. 
His recovery was rapid; and to-day only a slight scar remains
to tell how nearly he met death in his efforts to save his friends
from the warriors of his own race.</p>

<p>And within the following few weeks the threatening cloud that
had overspread the Western sky, behind which the blood-red lightning
gleamed and played, dissolved, and gave place to the sweet sunshine
of peace, which, let us pray, may continue for ever.</p>
