<p>The reader has long since penetrated the cause of the panic into
which Simon Kenton was thrown&mdash;a panic as wild, as unreasonable
and uncontrollable as that of the single Shawanoe, some time before,
when he plunged into the forest and fled as if from the pursuit
of the evil one himself.</p>

<p>There were no more superstitious men living than the daring pioneers
and scouts of the West. Never hesitating to meet death, and courageously
facing peril before which most people would have cowered, they
demanded that that death and that peril should present themselves
in tangible form. In other words, they shrank at receiving no
blows, provided the opportunity was given them of striking effective
blows in return.</p>

<p>In trailing an enemy, when the "crossing of the ways" was reached,
that is, where it was impossible to decide from evidence the right
path to take, the question was often decided by a flirt of a hunting-knife;
whichever course the implement indicated when it fell, was accepted
as the finger of Providence, and was followed with as much unflinching
vigor as though the possibility of an error did not exist. In
many other respects was this belief in signs and the awe of the
supernatural shown.</p>

<p>The brief, terrified glance of Kenton revealed to him an Ohio
flatboat moving up the river against the current&mdash;something which
in all his varied experience he had never seen. The same glance
showed a yawning white spread across the craft, as if it were
the upturned wing of some monster swimming on its side in the
water.</p>

<p>Without pausing to reflect that this appearance was the key to
the whole mystery, the brave man gave way to terror, and, throwing
discretion to the winds, dashed into the enclosure among his friends
with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Boys, we're lost! We're lost! There's a ghost coming up the
river!"</p>

<p>His words and manner threw the others into consternation. While
it is certain that some would have shown more coolness, yet nothing
is more contagious than fear, and the panic of one considered
the clearest-headed and most daring of the rangers caused the
rest for a brief while to bid good-by to their senses.</p>

<p>Forgetful of the Shawanoes near at hand, and thinking of nothing
but the new and dreadful peril, the men and women made haste to
gather about the tall figure that advanced almost to the middle
of the inclosure before checking himself.</p>

<p>"What is it, Kenton? For heaven's sake, tell us!"</p>

<p>"Where is it? What does it look like?"</p>

<p>"Keep your head, Simon," counselled Boone, in the babel of exclamations,
"and tell us what it is the ghost of."</p>

<p>"You remember t'other flatboat," said Kenton, partially recovering
his self-mastery, "the one the MacDougalls was on, and they was
all killed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, of course," replied several.</p>

<p>"Wal, the ghost of that flatboat is coming up the river; it's
right off shore; it'll be among us in a few minutes; we had better
take to the woods."</p>

<p>And, incredible as it may seem, the intrepid scout would have
led the absurd stampede, had not his elder and cooler friend laid
his hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Simon, you ain't yourself; don't forget the varmints are all
around us."</p>

<p>"Dan'l," returned Kenton, sharply, "did you ever see a ghost?"</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>"Wal, if you want to see one, walk down to the edge of the river
and there it is! As for me, I want to git away afore it comes
any closer; but I forgot 'bout the varmints; I'll wait till you
folks have a look at it, and then we'll all run."</p>

<p>Evidently, the ranger was rallying from his panic.</p>

<p>Among the group that gathered around him were several who were
quick to recover from their own fright, and to see that the true
course was to investigate the cause of the latter's state of mind.</p>

<p>"Wait here till I take a look for myself," said George Ashbridge,
touching the elbow of his father; "there's something in this that
I don't understand; I will be gone but a few minutes; it's the
strangest condition of affairs I ever knew."</p>

<p>He whisked off in the obscurity and quickly reached the river
side.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Missionary Finley gave proof of his sagacity. Having
decided to use the flatboat and its sail as a possible weapon,
he had risen to his feet, and with hands grasping the bow oar
was figuring as to how he could discover the proper point at which
to work the boat to land.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to emit a signal which would be recognized
either by Boone or Kenton, if it reached their ears, when across
the brief, intervening space he heard the threshing and the terrified
exclamations of his old friend.</p>

<p>"Here we are, Jethro! This is the place! Now, work with a will!"</p>

<p>Both bent their strong arms to the task, and the water was churned
at each end of the craft by the broad blades that swept deep and
powerful like the arms of a propeller. The bulky boat responded
and began approaching the bank, no more than a couple of rods
distant.</p>

<p>In this hurly-burly of affright and excitement, the missionary
compressed his lips to keep back the tugging smile. He had caught
the first words uttered by Kenton, identified his voice, and understood
the cause of his alarm.</p>

<p>"If it please Heaven to deliver us all from peril," was the thought
of Finley, "I shall not forget this affair, and I will make sure
that Simon is not allowed to forget it."</p>

<p>It was only a minute or two later that George Ashbridge hurried
to the margin of the water. The sweep of the long oars and the
sight of the flatboat itself, with the spread of sail above it,
all so near that they were recognized at the first glance, told
the whole amazing story to the young man, though, as yet, he could
not comprehend how it had all come about.</p>

<p>One of the figures toiling at the sweeps was Jethro Juggens;
he could form no suspicion as to the identity of the other.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Jethro?" called Ashbridge, in a guarded undertone.</p>

<p>"It am," was the proud response; "keep out ob de way, Marse George,
or dis boat will run ober you. We's comin' like thunder."</p>

<p>"There! that will do," said the missionary, as the boat struck
sideways, almost abreast of where the youth was standing; "we
couldn't have made a better landing. Good evening, my friend;
I am sure we are welcome."</p>

<p>With these cheery words the man, with his rifle in his left hand,
stepped across the gunwale upon the hard earth and extended his
right to young Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"My name is Finley &mdash;James B. Finley; I am a missionary
for Ohio and Kentucky, and joined your young friend hero to see
whether I can be of any help to you and those with you."</p>

<p>"And an angel could not be more welcome," was the fervent response
of the youth, returning the warm pressure of the good man.</p>

<p>"There seems to be trouble here," said he, with grave concern.</p>

<p>"We are in sore straits, indeed; we have been resting for a good
while, afraid to go on, for there is an ambuscade of the Indians
just beyond, into which they are waiting for us to enter."</p>

<p>"I presume the Shawanoes are in charge of The Panther."</p>

<p>"So Daniel Boone tells us."</p>

<p>"I feared as much; I'm glad that Boone is with you."</p>

<p>"And so is Kenton."</p>

<p>"Yes; I recognized his voice; he seems to be a little disturbed
by the appearance of our craft."</p>

<p>"I never knew it was possible for a man like him to become so
frightened. He seems to have lost his wits."</p>

<p>"They will soon return to him; he's a noble fellow."</p>

<p>"Jes' let me know what you want done," remarked Jethro Juggens,
who had placed the anchor so as to hold the flatboat motionless;
"don't forget dat I fixed up dis yer contrivance."</p>

<p>"Yes, all the credit belongs to him. He will explain when there
is time; we have not a minute to spare now; it looks as if the
appearance of the boat has given the red men, as well as the others,
a scare."</p>

<p>"No doubt of that, and Kenton's performance has had a good deal
to do with it, for he upset our people completely."</p>

<p>"We must take instant advantage of this diversion, which is providential;
let us go to your friends at once."</p>

<p>The missionary set off with young Ashbridge at his side and Jethro
Juggens immediately behind them. A few brief, hurried steps took
them to the group, whose members were beginning to regain a part
at least of their senses.</p>

<p>It was no occasion for Mr. Finley to indulge in any pleasantry
at the expense of his old friend, Simon Kenton, however appropriate
it might be at another time. His words were grave, quick and prompt,
as were becoming. He hurriedly shook hands with Boone, Kenton
and the rangers, to all of whom he was well known and by them
held in high esteem. He greeted the others warmly in turn, using
his tongue while doing so.</p>

<p>"The appearance of the flatboat is so strange that it gave you
all a good scare, and no wonder that it did so. It has produced
the same effect upon The Panther's party, else they would not
have allowed us to land or permitted this passing back and forth;
but like you they will soon recover from it; one must use this
opportunity, so providentially placed in our way."</p>

<p>"That's the right kind of talk," remarked Kenton, who was already
humiliated at the part he had played a short time before.</p>

<p>"From what Jethro told me, you have little, if any, luggage with
you."</p>

<p>"Only what we can carry in our hands," replied Mr. Altman.</p>

<p>"So far as I can judge, you are all gathered in this spot&mdash;a
thing you would not be permitted to do but for the fright of the
Indians. Follow me then; I will lead the way."</p>

<p>Less time than would be supposed was occupied in this broken
conversation. As stated, the words of the missionary were quickly
uttered, and he showed his promptness by wheeling about and moving
down the gentle incline toward the river. It seemed strange for
him to take the lead of a party of rangers, among whom were Daniel
Boone and Simon Kenton, but his leadership was only for the moment,
and could have been assumed by Jethro Juggens himself, for it
signified an advance only to the flatboat itself.</p>

<p>Boone, with several quick strides, placed himself beside the
preacher.</p>

<p>"Have a care," he continued. "I don't understand what makes the
varmints so quiet."</p>

<p>"Because they are scared, as all of you were by the flatboat
and its sail."</p>

<p>"The only one of us skeered was Simon," corrected the great pioneer,
"and then he skeered us by the way he carried on."</p>

<p>"Well, any one of you would have been just as much frightened
as he, and I suspect the rumpus he created had something to do
with the panic of the Shawanoes; but you are right; it will not
last long, and it may be over already."</p>

<p>The habit of caution to which all the rangers were trained asserted
itself. Grasping their rifles firmly, they involuntarily assumed
a crouching pose and stepped lightly forward, as if afraid the
slightest footfall would betray them. They glanced to the right
and left, and more than once fancied they discerned shadowy forms
stealing here and there in the gloom.</p>

<p>It was natural, perhaps, that a different and somewhat peculiar
feeling should influence the two families of settlers. They felt
as if they would ignore the existence of enemies in their immediate
neighborhood; they would forget that any danger of that nature
ever threatened them at all, and devote their utmost energies
to hurrying forward to the flatboat. They held their gaze in that
direction, and tried to pierce the gloom and see nothing but the
single object upon which their hope was fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbridge and his wife clasped a hand of Mabel between them.
Mr. Altman and his wife clung to each other, while George Ashbridge
had fallen slightly to the rear with Agnes, while the rangers
seemed to straggle irregularly forward, as they had done when
pushing through the woods, but, in truth, they were advancing
in accordance with a well-defined idea of the best course to follow
at this time.</p>

<p>Finley, Kenton and Boone held their places at the head, and the
fugitives speedily reached the river side, where the unpleasant
fact became apparent that the wind, which had been blowing so
long and steadily, had dropped to a degree that it could no longer
be of any help to them.</p>
