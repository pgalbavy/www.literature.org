<p>Before the faintest streak of light appeared in the eastern horizon,
Captain Bergen was awake and in the rigging, with the binocular
glasses in his hand.</p>

<p>The most careful computation showed they were in latitude about
19 south and longitude 140 west. They had passed to the eastward
of the Mendina Archipelago, catching a glimpse of one of the islands,
where the mate proposed they should touch and obtain some supplies.
But the captain was too eager to push ahead, and Grebbens had
told him that one peculiarity about the little island which was
their destination was that it contained fresh water, with some
tropical fruit, while there could be no difficulty in catching
all the fish they wished.</p>

<p>Since the island was altogether uninhabited, and very rarely
visited, it would have been a good thing for the party could the
suggestion of the mate have been carried out. But it was the conviction
of Captain Bergen that they would not spend more than two weeks
at the fishery&mdash;if such it might be called&mdash;and, under the circumstances,
it cannot be said he was imprudent. Steadying himself with one
arm about the mast, the captain stood firmly in his elevated position,
and, as the sun came slowly up and the golden radiance spread
over the sky and sea, he swept the arch of the horizon to the
south, east and west, straining his keen vision for the first
sight of the eagerly-wished-for land.</p>

<p>"Water, water," he murmured, despondingly. "Water everywhere,
and no sight of the haven! Hello!"</p>

<p>His heart gave a great bound, for, just in the edge of the horizon&mdash;at
the very point where ocean and sky met&mdash;he saw a dark substance,
like a fleecy vapor, no bigger than a man's hand.</p>

<p>"It may be a cloud," said the captain to himself, as he carefully
scrutinized it, "and it may be land; and, by the great horn spoon,
it is land! Land ho!"</p>

<p>"Where away?" called back Storms, from below, quite confident
what the answer would be.</p>

<p>"Two points on the weather-bow."</p>

<p>The mate headed toward the point indicated, and then silence
reigned for awhile on board, excepting in the case of Inez, who
bounded up on deck, and was here, there and everywhere.</p>

<p>The captain was left to himself, for Abe Storms knew he would
come down and report as soon as he had anything definite; and,
in the nature of things, he could know nothing positive for a
considerable time to come.</p>

<p>As the <em>Coral</em> sped forward&mdash;sometimes on the long, sloping
crest of an immense swell, and then again in the valley between&mdash;the
captain saw and thought of nothing else but the little island
ahead, which was slowly rising out of the ocean. He had discovered
that it was circular in shape, quite small, and fringed with vegetation.
This corresponded, in a general way, with the description given
by the sailor in the hospital; but there are hundreds of other
islands in the South Seas to which the same description will apply,
and it was not impossible that the <em>Coral</em> was many a long
league astray.</p>

<p>"When I was on the island, ten years ago," said Grebbens, "I
found remains of a ship that had been wrecked there but a short
time before. There was a portion of the mast, which we managed
to erect by scooping a deep hole in the beach and then packing
the sand about the base. On the top of this we kept our signal
of distress flying, in the hope of catching the notice of some
passing vessel, as was the case after a long while. It was my
jacket which fluttered from the top of that mast, and the old
garment has been blown away long ago; but I don't know any reason
why the pole itself shouldn't be standing, and if it is, you will
find it on the right of the entrance to the lagoon."</p>

<p>The island, it will be understood, was an atoll&mdash;that is, a circular
fringe of coral, with a lagoon of the sea inside which was entered
through a comparatively narrow passage from the ocean. The atoll
to which the old sailor referred was extensive enough to furnish
fresh water and fruit, while at the entrance, and in other places,
there was a sufficient depth of sand to afford secure "anchorage"
for the pole which they erected. Peering through the spy-glass,
Captain Bergen could see the white line where the sea beat against
the coral shores and was rolled back again in foam. And while
he was gazing, his practiced eye detected a gap in the line of
breakers&mdash;that is, a spot where the white foam did not show itself.
This must necessarily be the opening through which the ocean flowed
into the lagoon within the island. Since it met with no opposition,
it swept inward with a smooth, grand sweep, which proved that
the water was deep and without any obstruction.</p>

<p>"Suppose he deceived me?"</p>

<p>Captain Bergen asked himself the question while he was scanning
the island.</p>

<p>It was the first time the thought suggested that maybe the sailor,
dying in the Boston hospital, had told him an untruth, and such
a shuddering, overwhelming feeling of disappointment came over
the poor fellow at that moment that he grew dizzy and sick at
heart, and came nigh losing his balance.</p>

<p>"No, it cannot be," he repeated, rallying himself, with a great
effort. "I have a better opinion of human nature than that."</p>

<p>His glasses were still pointed in the direction of the island,
and he was peering with an intensity that was painful at the spot
where the dark break in the foamy breakers showed the entrance
to the atoll, when he detected a black, needle-like column which
rose from the beach at one side of the entrance. It was so thin
that he could not make sure it was not some trick of his straining
vision, and in doubt as to its reality, he relieved his aching
eye by removing the glass for a moment and looking down on the
deck beneath him.</p>

<p>He saw Redvignez and Brazzier standing at the bow, also gazing
toward the island, which was plainly visible from the deck. They
occasionally spoke, but their tones were so low that no word could
be distinguished by any ears excepting those for which they were
intended. Mr. Storms was at his post, and as Pomp and Inez were
invisible, the conclusion was inevitable that they were in the
cabin, whence issued the appetizing odor of cooking fish, and
where no doubt the young lady was receiving the attention which
she expected as her right.</p>

<p>At this instant a peculiar experience came to the captain of
the yacht <em>Coral</em>. A slight flaw in the breeze, which was
bearing the vessel forward, caused the sails to flap, and must
have made a sort of funnel of one of them for the moment; or rather,
as may be said, it made a temporary whispering gallery of the
deck and rigging of the craft. And being such, it bore the following
ominous words to Captain Bergen, uttered, as they were, by Hyde
Brazzier in a most guarded undertone:</p>

<p>"We shall be the two richest men in America!"</p>

<p>Captain Bergen was in that state of intense nervous sensibility
in which his perceptions were unnaturally acute, and he felt,
on the instant the words struck his ear, that they had a frightful
meaning.</p>

<p>The two continued their cautious conference, but the sail favored
acoustics no longer, and the listener did not catch another syllable.</p>

<p>"They mean to kill Abe and me," he said to himself, "and run
away with the pearls. If they had determined to be honest men,
and we had secured any particular amount of wealth, they would
have been rewarded liberally. Forewarned is forearmed."</p>

<p>Captain Bergen was a brave man, and there was no fear of his
displaying any shrinking in the crisis which was evidently close
at hand.</p>

<p>Once more he raised the glass to his eye and gazed toward the
inlet of the atoll. During the few minutes that he had spent in
looking down upon the deck and listening, the schooner had made
good speed, and the island was less than a half mile distant.
When the instrument was pointed toward the place, he saw clearly
and unmistakably the figure of the mast standing beside the inlet,
where it had been placed years before by Grebbens and his companions.</p>

<p>This, then, was Pearl Island, as the New Englanders had named
it; and here it was that the bed of pearl oysters of fabulous
richness was to be found.</p>

<p>Something like a feeling of depression came over the captain
when he realized that the land of promise had risen on his vision
at last. For days, weeks and months this had been the one absorbing
theme of his mind. He had dreamed of it until he was almost, if
not quite, a monomaniac, and he had built air-castles until the
whole sky of his vision was filled with gorgeous structures. And
it should be added, in justice to both Bergen and Storms, that
these structures were creditable to the builders; for, realizing
in the fullest sense that about all they could extract personally
from riches was their own board and lodging, they had perfected
a number of colossal schemes for benefiting humanity; indeed,
charity was the foundation-stone of all these castles. And now,
after these long months of waiting, he seemed to see the wealth
lying within his grasp, and something like a reaction came to
him.</p>

<p>"Is it worth all this?" he asked himself. "Is the gain likely
to pay for the peril in which we have placed ourselves?"</p>

<p>Still further, the ominous words which he had overheard impressed
him vividly with the impending danger in which he and his mate
were placed. He saw now that in taking Brazzier and Redvignez
he had taken two mutineers aboard, and two who, in all probability,
had won the giant African, Pomp, over to their side.</p>

<p>What was to be the outcome of all this?</p>
