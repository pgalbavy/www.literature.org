<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When Frisky Squirrel saw Freddie Weasel disappear in the hole in the
bank he became greatly excited. He forgot all about going home. And
though he had begun to feel somewhat sleepy, he was wide awake again
in no time. He sat right down, a little way from the hole, and he
never once took his eyes off it.
</p>
<p>Frisky hoped that perhaps he would hear Freddie snoring in there, if
he waited long enough. But no such thing happened. There seemed to be
but one way to discover whether Freddie was asleep, and <u>that</u> was to
creep into the hole himself and find out.
</p><p>Now, Frisky Squirrel was no coward, as you know. But he did not like
the idea of crawling into that narrow, dark place. He knew that
Freddie Weasel's teeth were very sharp. And he knew that Freddie was
quick to use them, too.
</p><p>Frisky was trying hard to think of some good way to catch Freddie
asleep, when who should come strolling along but Henry Skunk! Frisky
always supposed that he was called "Henry" because he was so fond of
<u>hens</u>--for he visited Farmer Green's hen-house oftener than any other
of the forest-people--but whether <u>that</u> was why he was so named I
should really not want to say.
</p><p>"Well, well! You're out pretty late," Henry Skunk called, as soon as
he saw Frisky.
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel held a paw to his mouth, so Henry Skunk would not talk
too loudly.
</p><p>"What's going on?" Henry Skunk asked, with growing interest. "You
haven't seen a hen around here, have you?"
</p><p>Frisky shook his head.
</p><p>"It's Freddie Weasel--" he explained, pointing at the hole. "He's in
there; and I'm trying to catch him asleep."
</p><p>Henry Skunk came nearer.
</p><p>"Why don't you go inside?" he asked.
</p><p>Frisky shook his head again.
</p><p>"I don't see very well in the dark," he said, "and I'd rather not."
</p><p>Henry nodded.
</p><p>"I can see first rate at night," he told Frisky. "I'll find out for
you if Freddie Weasel is asleep. And if he is, I'll come right back
and tell you, and then you can go in with me and see for yourself."
</p><p>"Good!" said Frisky. "That's very kind of you, I'm sure."
</p><p>So Henry Skunk walked up to the hole. It was entirely too small for
him to enter.
</p><p>"I'll have to make it bigger," he remarked.
</p><p>"Won't Freddie hear you?" Frisky Squirrel inquired.
</p><p>"I'll be very quiet about it," Henry Skunk replied. "So if he's asleep
I hardly think I'll disturb him." And at that Henry set to work.
</p><p>Now, in order to dig, he had to stick his head into the hole. But he
knew he could see Freddie Weasel if Freddie tried to bite his nose; so
Henry was not afraid. How he did make the dirt fly! Frisky wished that
he could dig like that. He thought it must be great fun. And he
watched Henry so closely that he never saw that slim, sneaking form
that crept up behind him. And when Frisky felt something jump right on
top of him, and when a terrible, sharp pain seized his shoulder, he
was scared half out of his wits.
</p><p>It was Freddie Weasel! He had left his home through another hole,
which Frisky knew nothing about.
</p><p>Frisky Squirrel called for help. He shouted Henry Skunk's name again
and again, as he rolled over and over on the ground, trying to shake
Freddie off his back.
</p><p>But how could Henry Skunk hear him, with his head buried inside the
hole? <u>He</u> didn't know what was happening. And if Frisky and Freddie
hadn't rolled right upon him he probably would never have looked
around until it was too late.
</p><p>But when Henry felt that rolling, tumbling, fighting pair bump against
him he drew his head out of the hole in a hurry. And as soon as he saw
what was happening he sunk his own sharp teeth deep into Freddie
Weasel's back.
</p><p>Freddie let go of Frisky Squirrel at once. And he gave Henry Skunk's
nose such a savage nip that Henry just had to squeal--it hurt him so.
In order to squeal, of course he had to open his mouth. And when he
opened his mouth he had to let go of Freddie Weasel.
</p><p>That was exactly what Freddie Weasel wanted. He sprang up and dashed
into the bushes. He was not afraid of Frisky Squirrel. But Henry Skunk
was altogether too big. Freddie did not enjoy fighting <u>him</u>.
</p><p>Well! Frisky, with his aching shoulder, and Henry Skunk, with his sore
nose, went off together. They didn't say a word to each other, until
they reached the hickory tree where Frisky lived. And then all they
said was "Good-night!"
</p><p>Frisky never spied on anybody again. He had learned that it is better
not to meddle in other people's private affairs. So, after all,
perhaps it was a good thing that he tried, just once, to catch Freddie
Weasel asleep.
