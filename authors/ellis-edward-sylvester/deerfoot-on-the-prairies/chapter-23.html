<p><em>DEERFOOT, </em>Mul-tal-la and the Shelton boys were encamped
in the heart of the Rockies. The Blackfeet visitors had departed
two days before and were well on their way to their own villages.
The air was keen and bracing, and the sun that had been obscured
now shone from a brilliant sky.</p>

<p>The halt was made at noon to give the horses a needed rest, for
they had done considerable hard climbing. Even the peerless Whirlwind
showed the effects of the unusual task. It being understood that
the pause was to be for several hours, a general break-up of the
company followed. The Blackfoot and the Shawanoe strolled off
by themselves, and George and Victor Shelton took another direction,
with a caution not to wander too far and to return before sunset.</p>

<p>The boys soon found themselves in a region where progress was
difficult. They were not following any trail, and were forced
at times to clamber over boulders and other obstructions, or to
flank them; to descend into deep depressions and to climb ridges
at whose summits they were obliged to sit down for a breathing
spell. Such hard work made them thirsty, and when they came to
one of the numerous tumbling brooks, whose waters were as clear
as crystal and as cold as the snow and ice from which they sprang,
they refreshed themselves with a deep draught and sat down for
a rest.</p>

<p>"Whew!" sighed Victor, removing his cap and mopping his moist
forehead; "there isn’t as much fun in this as I thought. I wouldn’t
mind the walking and climbing if a fellow didn’t get tired."</p>

<p>"And if you didn’t get tired you wouldn’t enjoy a rest like this.</p>

<p>"Do you remember," he continued, "how Simon Kenton used to say
at our house that no man could know what a good night’s sleep
is unless he sat up one or two nights beforehand. I suppose there’s
something in that, though we don’t have to try it on ourselves.
I know that water doesn’t taste one-half so good unless you are
as thirsty as you can be. It seems to me, Victor, that it’s time
we bagged some game.</p>

<p>"We haven’t bagged much," George added; "Mul-tal-la got an elk
yesterday; Deerfoot brought down an antelope; I shot a turkey,
and you came pretty near hitting a buffalo that was several yards
off."</p>

<p>"Came pretty near hitting him!" repeated Victor, with fine scorn.
"I hit him fairly, and you know it, but these buffaloes have hard
heads, like some persons I know."</p>

<p>"Then you shouldn’t aim at their heads. Other people don’t, and
it’s time you learned better."</p>

<p>"I don’t know any relative of mine that is too old to learn a
good many things," replied Victor, without a spark of ill-nature.</p>

<p>"That sounds as if you mean <em>me</em>. I’ll own up that Deerfoot
and I are liable to make mistakes now and then, but I don’t quite
think either of us would run from a wounded antelope and keep
up a yelling that could be heard a mile off."</p>

<p>"It is sometimes a wise thing to run; you see it tempts your
game to follow and brings him within range."</p>

<p>"Where is the need of that when he must have been in range at
the time you wounded him?"</p>

<p>"But couldn’t he turn and make off in another direction and get
beyond reach before you could load again? I tell you, George,
there was science in what I did. I advise you to try the same
trick when you have a chance, and then"——</p>

<p>A peculiar hog-like grunt caused both to look behind them. The
sight that met their gaze was enough to terrify a veteran hunter.
Hardly a hundred feet away stood the most gigantic grizzly bear
of which they had ever dreamed. They had listened spellbound to
the story of Mul-tal-la, but believed that the panic he underwent
at the time of his encounter with one of those western terrors
caused him to exaggerate his account, though it must have been
a fearful brute that could have wrought the havoc he did. [Illustration:
A Western Monarch.]</p>

<p>This bear had his hind feet on the ground and his front ones
on a boulder, so that his massive back sloped downward from his
head, and he was looking at the boys as if speculating as to what
species they belonged. His size was tremendous. To the lads he
seemed to be three or four times the bulk of any of his kind they
had met in the forests of Ohio or Kentucky. It is not improbable
that the estimate of the brothers was right. You know that the
grizzly bear (which the early explorers referred to as a white
bear) is now, as he has been from time immemorial, the monarch
of the western wilds. So prodigious are his size and strength
that he is absolutely without fear.</p>

<p>And he is justified in this self-confidence. One stroke of that
mighty paw, whose claws are often six inches in length, will break
the back of a horse or tear a man to shreds, and enveloping his
victim in those beam-like front legs, he will crush him to pulp
without putting forth more than a tithe of his power. A score
of bullets have been pumped into that immense carcass without
causing any apparent harm. The Rocky Mountain grizzly saves the
hunter the trouble of attacking him. It is the bear himself who
starts things moving and keeps them going at a lively rate. The
advice of the most experienced ranger of the wilds is that if
a man is alone and without an inaccessible perch from which to
shoot, he should not disturb the grizzly. This advice is equally
good for two persons, and would not be inappropriate for three
in most circumstances.</p>

<p>It may be doubted whether the entire West at the time of which
I am writing contained a more colossal grizzly bear than the one
upon which George and Victor Shelton gazed when they turned their
heads. His bulk was so immense that they recognized him on the
instant as the dreaded brute of which they had heard more than
one terrifying story.</p>

<p>Why he did not advance upon the lads at once is not easy to explain.
It probably was because the whim did not come to him, or he may
have looked upon the couple as too insignificant for notice. It
is not unlikely that curiosity had something to do with it, for
no doubt they were the first examples of the Caucasian race that
he had seen, though he must have met Indians and may have crushed
an indefinite number to death.</p>

<p>The strange spectacle was presented for the next few minutes
of the boys staring at the monster, while he stared back at them,
no one moving or making any sound. George and Victor were literally
paralyzed for the time and unable to stir or speak.</p>

<p>Victor was the first to rally. Forgetting the warnings of Deerfoot
and Mul-tal-la, he sprang to his feet, faced wholly around, and
brought his gun to his shoulder.</p>

<p>"What a splendid shot!" he exclaimed. "See me tumble him over!"</p>

<p>But George remembered the words of their dusky friends, and,
knowing the fatal folly of what Victor was about to do, protested.</p>

<p>"Don’t you do it! He’ll kill us both!"</p>

<p>In his fright Victor was cool. He took deliberate aim, and while
the words were in the mouth of his brother pressed the trigger.
The report and act threw George into an irrestrainable panic,
and bounding to his feet he dashed off at the utmost speed. Across
gullies, over and around rocks, threshing through undergrowth,
he sped, not daring to look around and hardly conscious of what
he was doing. He forgot the peril of Victor in his panic until
he had run several hundred yards, when, realizing what he was
doing, he abruptly stopped and looked back.</p>

<p>He had gone so far that he saw neither the bear nor Victor, and
he began picking his way to the spot, shivering with dread, and
expecting each moment to come upon the mangled remains of his
brother.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Victor had a remarkable experience. Had he not been
so impulsive by nature, and had he been given a few moments for
reflection, he would have let the brute alone; but, as I have
shown, he fired straight at him. More than that, he hit him. In
accordance with the almost invariable rule in such circumstances
the grizzly should have swept down upon him like a cyclone. Instead
of that he slowly swung his front around, dropped to his natural
posture on the ground, and began lumbering away.</p>

<p>Incredible as it may seem, he probably was not aware that he
had served as a target for an American youth. He must have been
conscious of the landing of the bullet somewhere about his anatomy,
but the matter was too trifling to disturb him. The annoyance
from mosquitoes was more serious, especially when they attacked
his eyes. In Alaska these pests often blind the bears by their
persistent assaults, and the miserable brutes wander aimlessly
around until they starve to death.</p>

<p>Even Victor Shelton was puzzled by the action of the grizzly.
It would not have been so strange to him had the quadruped rolled
over and died, for that would have indicated that a lucky shot
had been made; but that he should turn and make off was more than
the youth could understand. He would have believed the bear had
been frightened had he not recalled the accounts of Mul-tal-la,
which showed the impossibility of such a thing.</p>

<p>In one respect Victor displayed wisdom. Without stirring from
the spot he carefully reloaded his gun, keeping a lookout all
the time for the return of the monster. He had caught sight of
the mountainous, shaggy bulk as it swung through the undergrowth,
which was trampled down as if it were so much grass, and then
disappeared. Would he come back?</p>

<p>While the lad was debating the question he heard the sound of
some one approaching from the other direction. Turning, his eyes
met those of his white-faced brother, who seemed to find it hard
to believe that he saw Victor alive and unharmed.</p>

<p>"Where’s the bear?" gasped George, when he could master his emotions.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t you wait and see me shoot him?" asked Victor loftily.</p>

<p>"It can’t be you killed him."</p>

<p>"He may live a few minutes longer, but I guess he’s gone off
to die by himself. You know wild animals don’t like to have spectators
when they give their last kick."</p>

<p>"It can’t be," said George as if to himself; "you couldn’t have
hit him."</p>

<p>"Then what made him leave so suddenly? Tell me <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"I don’t know; I never saw one of them before; but why didn’t
he attack us? This bear is a bigger one than Mul-tal-la ever met,
and it couldn’t be he was afraid of us."</p>

<p>"Not of <em>us</em>—of course not, for only one of us held his
ground, and I don’t think his name is George Shelton, but he saw
<em>I</em> was here; he took one good squint at me, and things
looked so squally he decided to leave."</p>

<p>The complacency and self-pride of Victor were warranted, provided
they rested upon a sure basis; <em>that</em> would soon be known.
Few living woodmen have ever driven off a grizzly bear by a single
shot, and it seems beyond the range of possibility for the feat
to be performed by a boy.</p>

<p>Victor peered in all directions, and seeing nothing of the monster,
turned and proceeded to "rub it in" with his brother.</p>

<p>"Let me see, George, you were saying something a little while
ago about a fellow that you saw run away from the charge of an
antelope."</p>

<p>George knew what was coming and rallied to "repel boarders."</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw a great hulking youngster do that very thing. You
will find it hard to believe anyone could show such cowardice,
but Mul-tal-la was with me, and he’ll tell you it is true."</p>

<p>"Do you think that the chap, who no doubt was trying to lure
the antelope to his destruction, made better time than <em>you</em>
did when you deserted me at sight of this big bear?"</p>

<p>"There may not have been much difference in the speed of the
two, but you see the case is different. One boy ran from an animal
that is as harmless as a rabbit, while the other fled from a beast
that would have sent a half-dozen veterans flying, even though
they had loaded rifles in their hands."</p>

<p>"But I stood my ground."</p>

<p>"Because you didn’t know any better. You were too scared to run."</p>

<p>"But not too scared to shoot and hit the game. Folks generally
say that the fellow who runs away is frightened and not the one
who keeps his place and sends a bullet right into the face of
the danger. What do <em>you</em> think of it, George?"</p>

<p>"I have already told you what I think. Let us leave the question
to Mul-tal-la and Deerfoot to settle when we go back to camp."</p>

<p>But Victor, unaware that the Shawanoe had heard the story long
before from the Blackfoot, was unwilling to have it brought to
his knowledge. He knew he cut a sorry figure when fleeing from
the frantic antelope, and he did not like to hear references to
it. He would prefer to appear ridiculous in the eyes of any person
in the world rather than in those of the young Shawanoe. He saw
his chance and used it.</p>

<p>"I’ll agree to say nothing about this if you don’t talk about
antelopes when Deerfoot is around. Are you willing?"</p>

<p>Before George Shelton could refuse or give assent the conversation
was broken in upon in the most startling manner.</p>
