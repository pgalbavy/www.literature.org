<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A pink and blue June morning found me at Bradgate looking from
the Griffin Hotel over a smooth sea to the lightship on the Cock
sands which seemed the size of a bell-buoy. A couple of miles
farther south and much nearer the shore a small destroyer was
anchored. Scaife, MacGillivray’s man, who had been in the Navy,
knew the boat, and told me her name and her commander’s, so I
sent off a wire to Sir Walter.</p>

<p>After breakfast Scaife got from a house-agent a key for the gates
of the staircases on the Ruff. I walked with him along the sands,
and sat down in a nook of the cliffs while he investigated the
half-dozen of them. I didn’t want to be seen, but the place at
this hour was quite deserted, and all the time I was on that beach
I saw nothing but the seagulls.</p>

<p>It took him more than an hour to do the job, and when I saw him
coming towards me, conning a bit of paper, I can tell you my heart
was in my mouth. Everything depended, you see, on my guess proving
right.</p>

<p>He read aloud the number of steps in the different stairs. "Thirty-four,
thirty-five, thirty-nine, forty-two, forty-seven," and "twenty-one’
where the cliffs grew lower. I almost got up and shouted.</p>

<p>We hurried back to the town and sent a wire to MacGillivray.
I wanted half a dozen men, and I directed them to divide themselves
among different specified hotels. Then Scaife set out to prospect
the house at the head of the thirty-nine steps.</p>

<p>He came back with news that both puzzled and reassured me. The
house was called Trafalgar Lodge, and belonged to an old gentleman
called Appleton—a retired stockbroker, the house-agent said. Mr
Appleton was there a good deal in the summer time, and was in
residence now—had been for the better part of a week. Scaife could
pick up very little information about him, except that he was
a decent old fellow, who paid his bills regularly, and was always
good for a fiver for a local charity. Then Scaife seemed to have
penetrated to the back door of the house, pretending he was an
agent for sewing-machines. Only three servants were kept, a cook,
a parlour-maid, and a housemaid, and they were just the sort that
you would find in a respectable middle-class household. The cook
was not the gossiping kind, and had pretty soon shut the door
in his face, but Scaife said he was positive she knew nothing.
Next door there was a new house building which would give good
cover for observation, and the villa on the other side was to
let, and its garden was rough and shrubby.</p>

<p>I borrowed Scaife’s telescope, and before lunch went for a walk
along the Ruff. I kept well behind the rows of villas, and found
a good observation point on the edge of the golf-course. There
I had a view of the line of turf along the cliff top, with seats
placed at intervals, and the little square plots, railed in and
planted with bushes, whence the staircases descended to the beach.
I saw Trafalgar Lodge very plainly, a red-brick villa with a veranda,
a tennis lawn behind, and in front the ordinary seaside flower-garden
full of marguerites and scraggy geraniums. There was a flagstaff
from which an enormous Union Jack hung limply in the still air.</p>

<p>Presently I observed someone leave the house and saunter along
the cliff. When I got my glasses on him I saw it was an old man,
wearing white flannel trousers, a blue serge jacket, and a straw
hat. He carried field-glasses and a newspaper, and sat down on
one of the iron seats and began to read. Sometimes he would lay
down the paper and turn his glasses on the sea. He looked for
a long time at the destroyer. I watched him for half an hour,
till he got up and went back to the house for his luncheon, when
I returned to the hotel for mine.</p>

<p>I wasn’t feeling very confident. This decent common-place dwelling
was not what I had expected. The man might be the bald archaeologist
of that horrible moorland farm, or he might not. He was exactly
the kind of satisfied old bird you will find in every suburb and
every holiday place. If you wanted a type of the perfectly harmless
person you would probably pitch on that.</p>

<p>But after lunch, as I sat in the hotel porch, I perked up, for
I saw the thing I had hoped for and had dreaded to miss. A yacht
came up from the south and dropped anchor pretty well opposite
the Ruff. She seemed about a hundred and fifty tons, and I saw
she belonged to the Squadron from the white ensign. So Scaife
and I went down to the harbour and hired a boatman for an afternoon’s
fishing.</p>

<p>I spent a warm and peaceful afternoon. We caught between us about
twenty pounds of cod and lythe, and out in that dancing blue sea
I took a cheerier view of things. Above the white cliffs of the
Ruff I saw the green and red of the villas, and especially the
great flagstaff of Trafalgar Lodge. About four o’clock, when we
had fished enough, I made the boatman row us round the yacht,
which lay like a delicate white bird, ready at a moment to flee.
Scaife said she must be a fast boat for her build, and that she
was pretty heavily engined.</p>

<p>Her name was the <em>Ariadne</em>, as I discovered from the cap
of one of the men who was polishing brasswork. I spoke to him,
and got an answer in the soft dialect of Essex. Another hand that
came along passed me the time of day in an unmistakable English
tongue. Our boatman had an argument with one of them about the
weather, and for a few minutes we lay on our oars close to the
starboard bow.</p>

<p>Then the men suddenly disregarded us and bent their heads to
their work as an officer came along the deck. He was a pleasant,
clean-looking young fellow, and he put a question to us about
our fishing in very good English. But there could be no doubt
about him. His close-cropped head and the cut of his collar and
tie never came out of England.</p>

<p>That did something to reassure me, but as we rowed back to Bradgate
my obstinate doubts would not be dismissed. The thing that worried
me was the reflection that my enemies knew that I had got my knowledge
from Scudder, and it was Scudder who had given me the clue to
this place. If they knew that Scudder had this clue, would they
not be certain to change their plans? Too much depended on their
success for them to take any risks. The whole question was how
much they understood about Scudder’s knowledge. I had talked confidently
last night about Germans always sticking to a scheme, but if they
had any suspicions that I was on their track they would be fools
not to cover it. I wondered if the man last night had seen that
I recognized him. Somehow I did not think he had, and to that
I had clung. But the whole business had never seemed so difficult
as that afternoon when by all calculations I should have been
rejoicing in assured success.</p>

<p>In the hotel I met the commander of the destroyer, to whom Scaife
introduced me, and with whom I had a few words. Then I thought
I would put in an hour or two watching Trafalgar Lodge.</p>

<p>I found a place farther up the hill, in the garden of an empty
house. From there I had a full view of the court, on which two
figures were having a game of tennis. One was the old man, whom
I had already seen; the other was a younger fellow, wearing some
club colours in the scarf round his middle. They played with tremendous
zest, like two city gents who wanted hard exercise to open their
pores. You couldn’t conceive a more innocent spectacle. They shouted
and laughed and stopped for drinks, when a maid brought out two
tankards on a salver. I rubbed my eyes and asked myself if I was
not the most immortal fool on earth. Mystery and darkness had
hung about the men who hunted me over the Scotch moor in aeroplane
and motor-car, and notably about that infernal antiquarian. It
was easy enough to connect those folk with the knife that pinned
Scudder to the floor, and with fell designs on the world’s peace.
But here were two guileless citizens taking their innocuous exercise,
and soon about to go indoors to a humdrum dinner, where they would
talk of market prices and the last cricket scores and the gossip
of their native Surbiton. I had been making a net to catch vultures
and falcons, and lo and behold! two plump thrushes had blundered
into it.</p>

<p>Presently a third figure arrived, a young man on a bicycle, with
a bag of golf-clubs slung on his back. He strolled round to the
tennis lawn and was welcomed riotously by the players. Evidently
they were chaffing him, and their chaff sounded horribly English.
Then the plump man, mopping his brow with a silk handkerchief,
announced that he must have a tub. I heard his very words—"I’ve
got into a proper lather," he said. "This will bring down my weight
and my handicap, Bob. I’ll take you on tomorrow and give you a
stroke a hole." You couldn’t find anything much more English than
that.</p>

<p>They all went into the house, and left me feeling a precious
idiot. I had been barking up the wrong tree this time. These men
might be acting; but if they were, where was their audience? They
didn’t know I was sitting thirty yards off in a rhododendron.
It was simply impossible to believe that these three hearty fellows
were anything but what they seemed—three ordinary, game-playing,
suburban Englishmen, wearisome, if you like, but sordidly innocent.</p>

<p>And yet there were three of them; and one was old, and one was
plump, and one was lean and dark; and their house chimed in with
Scudder’s notes; and half a mile off was lying a steam yacht with
at least one German officer. I thought of Karolides lying dead
and all Europe trembling on the edge of earthquake, and the men
I had left behind me in London who were waiting anxiously for
the events of the next hours. There was no doubt that hell was
afoot somewhere. The Black Stone had won, and if it survived this
June night would bank its winnings.</p>

<p>There seemed only one thing to do—go forward as if I had no doubts,
and if I was going to make a fool of myself to do it handsomely.
Never in my life have I faced a job with greater disinclination.
I would rather in my then mind have walked into a den of anarchists,
each with his Browning handy, or faced a charging lion with a
popgun, than enter that happy home of three cheerful Englishmen
and tell them that their game was up. How they would laugh at
me!</p>

<p>But suddenly I remembered a thing I once heard in Rhodesia from
old Peter Pienaar. I have quoted Peter already in this narrative.
He was the best scout I ever knew, and before he had turned respectable
he had been pretty often on the windy side of the law, when he
had been wanted badly by the authorities. Peter once discussed
with me the question of disguises, and he had a theory which struck
me at the time. He said, barring absolute certainties like fingerprints,
mere physical traits were very little use for identification if
the fugitive really knew his business. He laughed at things like
dyed hair and false beards and such childish follies. The only
thing that mattered was what Peter called "atmosphere".</p>

<p>If a man could get into perfectly different surroundings from
those in which he had been first observed, and—this is the important
part—really play up to these surroundings and behave as if he
had never been out of them, he would puzzle the cleverest detectives
on earth. And he used to tell a story of how he once borrowed
a black coat and went to church and shared the same hymn-book
with the man that was looking for him. If that man had seen him
in decent company before he would have recognized him; but he
had only seen him snuffing the lights in a public-house with a
revolver.</p>

<p>The recollection of Peter’s talk gave me the first real comfort
that I had had that day. Peter had been a wise old bird, and these
fellows I was after were about the pick of the aviary. What if
they were playing Peter’s game? A fool tries to look different:
a clever man looks the same and is different.</p>

<p>Again, there was that other maxim of Peter’s which had helped
me when I had been a roadman. "If you are playing a part, you
will never keep it up unless you convince yourself that you are
<em>it</em>." That would explain the game of tennis. Those chaps
didn’t need to act, they just turned a handle and passed into
another life, which came as naturally to them as the first. It
sounds a platitude, but Peter used to say that it was the big
secret of all the famous criminals.</p>

<p>It was now getting on for eight o’clock, and I went back and
saw Scaife to give him his instructions. I arranged with him how
to place his men, and then I went for a walk, for I didn’t feel
up to any dinner. I went round the deserted golf-course, and then
to a point on the cliffs farther north beyond the line of the
villas.</p>

<p>On the little trim newly-made roads I met people in flannels
coming back from tennis and the beach, and a coastguard from the
wireless station, and donkeys and pierrots padding homewards.
Out at sea in the blue dusk I saw lights appear on the <em>Ariadne</em>
and on the destroyer away to the south, and beyond the Cock sands
the bigger lights of steamers making for the Thames. The whole
scene was so peaceful and ordinary that I got more dashed in spirits
every second. It took all my resolution to stroll towards Trafalgar
Lodge about half-past nine.</p>

<p>On the way I got a piece of solid comfort from the sight of a
greyhound that was swinging along at a nursemaid’s heels. He reminded
me of a dog I used to have in Rhodesia, and of the time when I
took him hunting with me in the Pali hills. We were after rhebok,
the dun kind, and I recollected how we had followed one beast,
and both he and I had clean lost it. A greyhound works by sight,
and my eyes are good enough, but that buck simply leaked out of
the landscape. Afterwards I found out how it managed it. Against
the grey rock of the kopjes it showed no more than a crow against
a thundercloud. It didn’t need to run away; all it had to do was
to stand still and melt into the background.</p>

<p>Suddenly as these memories chased across my brain I thought of
my present case and applied the moral. The Black Stone didn’t
need to bolt. They were quietly absorbed into the landscape. I
was on the right track, and I jammed that down in my mind and
vowed never to forget it. The last word was with Peter Pienaar.</p>

<p>Scaife’s men would be posted now, but there was no sign of a
soul. The house stood as open as a market-place for anybody to
observe. A three-foot railing separated it from the cliff road;
the windows on the ground-floor were all open, and shaded lights
and the low sound of voices revealed where the occupants were
finishing dinner. Everything was as public and above-board as
a charity bazaar. Feeling the greatest fool on earth, I opened
the gate and rang the bell.</p>

<p>A man of my sort, who has travelled about the world in rough
places, gets on perfectly well with two classes, what you may
call the upper and the lower. He understands them and they understand
him. I was at home with herds and tramps and roadmen, and I was
sufficiently at my ease with people like Sir Walter and the men
I had met the night before. I can’t explain why, but it is a fact.
But what fellows like me don’t understand is the great comfortable,
satisfied middle-class world, the folk that live in villas and
suburbs. He doesn’t know how they look at things, he doesn’t understand
their conventions, and he is as shy of them as of a black mamba.
When a trim parlour-maid opened the door, I could hardly find
my voice.</p>

<p>I asked for Mr Appleton, and was ushered in. My plan had been
to walk straight into the dining-room, and by a sudden appearance
wake in the men that start of recognition which would confirm
my theory. But when I found myself in that neat hall the place
mastered me. There were the golf-clubs and tennis-rackets, the
straw hats and caps, the rows of gloves, the sheaf of walking-sticks,
which you will find in ten thousand British homes. A stack of
neatly folded coats and waterproofs covered the top of an old
oak chest; there was a grandfather clock ticking; and some polished
brass warming-pans on the walls, and a barometer, and a print
of Chiltern winning the St Leger. The place was as orthodox as
an Anglican church. When the maid asked me for my name I gave
it automatically, and was shown into the smoking-room, on the
right side of the hall.</p>

<p>That room was even worse. I hadn’t time to examine it, but I
could see some framed group photographs above the mantelpiece,
and I could have sworn they were English public school or college.
I had only one glance, for I managed to pull myself together and
go after the maid. But I was too late. She had already entered
the dining-room and given my name to her master, and I had missed
the chance of seeing how the three took it.</p>

<p>When I walked into the room the old man at the head of the table
had risen and turned round to meet me. He was in evening dress—a
short coat and black tie, as was the other, whom I called in my
own mind the plump one. The third, the dark fellow, wore a blue
serge suit and a soft white collar, and the colours of some club
or school.</p>

<p>The old man’s manner was perfect. "Mr Hannay?" he said hesitatingly.
"Did you wish to see me? One moment, you fellows, and I’ll rejoin
you. We had better go to the smoking-room."</p>

<p>Though I hadn’t an ounce of confidence in me, I forced myself
to play the game. I pulled up a chair and sat down on it.</p>

<p>"I think we have met before," I said, "and I guess you know my
business."</p>

<p>The light in the room was dim, but so far as I could see their
faces, they played the part of mystification very well.</p>

<p>"Maybe, maybe," said the old man. "I haven’t a very good memory,
but I’m afraid you must tell me your errand, sir, for I really
don’t know it."</p>

<p>"Well, then," I said, and all the time I seemed to myself to
be talking pure foolishness—"I have come to tell you that the
game’s up. I have a warrant for the arrest of you three gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Arrest," said the old man, and he looked really shocked. "Arrest!
Good God, what for?"</p>

<p>"For the murder of Franklin Scudder in London on the 23rd day
of last month."</p>

<p>"I never heard the name before," said the old man in a dazed
voice.</p>

<p>One of the others spoke up. "That was the Portland Place murder.
I read about it. Good heavens, you must be mad, sir! Where do
you come from?"</p>

<p>"Scotland Yard," I said.</p>

<p>After that for a minute there was utter silence. The old man
was staring at his plate and fumbling with a nut, the very model
of innocent bewilderment.</p>

<p>Then the plump one spoke up. He stammered a little, like a man
picking his words.</p>

<p>"Don’t get flustered, uncle," he said. "It is all a ridiculous
mistake; but these things happen sometimes, and we can easily
set it right. It won’t be hard to prove our innocence. I can show
that I was out of the country on the 23rd of May, and Bob was
in a nursing home. You were in London, but you can explain what
you were doing."</p>

<p>"Right, Percy! Of course that’s easy enough. The 23rd! That was
the day after Agatha’s wedding. Let me see. What was I doing?
I came up in the morning from Woking, and lunched at the club
with Charlie Symons. Then—oh yes, I dined with the Fishmongers.
I remember, for the punch didn’t agree with me, and I was seedy
next morning. Hang it all, there’s the cigar-box I brought back
from the dinner." He pointed to an object on the table, and laughed
nervously.</p>

<p>"I think, sir," said the young man, addressing me respectfully,
"you will see you are mistaken. We want to assist the law like
all Englishmen, and we don’t want Scotland Yard to be making fools
of themselves. That’s so, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, Bob." The old fellow seemed to be recovering his
voice. "Certainly, we’ll do anything in our power to assist the
authorities. But—but this is a bit too much. I can’t get over
it."</p>

<p>"How Nellie will chuckle," said the plump man. "She always said
that you would die of boredom because nothing ever happened to
you. And now you’ve got it thick and strong," and he began to
laugh very pleasantly.</p>

<p>"By Jove, yes. Just think of it! What a story to tell at the
club. Really, Mr Hannay, I suppose I should be angry, to show
my innocence, but it’s too funny! I almost forgive you the fright
you gave me! You looked so glum, I thought I might have been walking
in my sleep and killing people."</p>

<p>It couldn’t be acting, it was too confoundedly genuine. My heart
went into my boots, and my first impulse was to apologize and
clear out. But I told myself I must see it through, even though
I was to be the laughing-stock of Britain. The light from the
dinner-table candlesticks was not very good, and to cover my confusion
I got up, walked to the door and switched on the electric light.
The sudden glare made them blink, and I stood scanning the three
faces.</p>

<p>Well, I made nothing of it. One was old and bald, one was stout,
one was dark and thin. There was nothing in their appearance to
prevent them being the three who had hunted me in Scotland, but
there was nothing to identify them. I simply can’t explain why
I who, as a roadman, had looked into two pairs of eyes, and as
Ned Ainslie into another pair, why I, who have a good memory and
reasonable powers of observation, could find no satisfaction.
They seemed exactly what they professed to be, and I could not
have sworn to one of them.</p>

<p>There in that pleasant dining-room, with etchings on the walls,
and a picture of an old lady in a bib above the mantelpiece, I
could see nothing to connect them with the moorland desperadoes.
There was a silver cigarette-box beside me, and I saw that it
had been won by Percival Appleton, Esq., of the St Bede’s Club,
in a golf tournament. I had to keep a firm hold of Peter Pienaar
to prevent myself bolting out of that house.</p>

<p>"Well," said the old man politely, "are you reassured by your
scrutiny, sir?"</p>

<p>I couldn’t find a word.</p>

<p>"I hope you’ll find it consistent with your duty to drop this
ridiculous business. I make no complaint, but you’ll see how annoying
it must be to respectable people."</p>

<p>I shook my head.</p>

<p>"O Lord," said the young man. "This is a bit too thick!"</p>

<p>"Do you propose to march us off to the police station?" asked
the plump one. "That might be the best way out of it, but I suppose
you won’t be content with the local branch. I have the right to
ask to see your warrant, but I don’t wish to cast any aspersions
upon you. You are only doing your duty. But you’ll admit it’s
horribly awkward. What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>There was nothing to do except to call in my men and have them
arrested, or to confess my blunder and clear out. I felt mesmerized
by the whole place, by the air of obvious innocence—not innocence
merely, but frank honest bewilderment and concern in the three
faces.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peter Pienaar," I groaned inwardly, and for a moment I was
very near damning myself for a fool and asking their pardon.</p>

<p>"Meantime I vote we have a game of bridge," said the plump one.
"It will give Mr Hannay time to think over things, and you know
we have been wanting a fourth player. Do you play, sir?"</p>

<p>I accepted as if it had been an ordinary invitation at the club.
The whole business had mesmerized me. We went into the smoking-room
where a card-table was set out, and I was offered things to smoke
and drink. I took my place at the table in a kind of dream. The
window was open and the moon was flooding the cliffs and sea with
a great tide of yellow light. There was moonshine, too, in my
head. The three had recovered their composure, and were talking
easily—just the kind of slangy talk you will hear in any golf
club-house. I must have cut a rum figure, sitting there knitting
my brows with my eyes wandering.</p>

<p>My partner was the young dark one. I play a fair hand at bridge,
but I must have been rank bad that night. They saw that they had
got me puzzled, and that put them more than ever at their ease.
I kept looking at their faces, but they conveyed nothing to me.
It was not that they looked different; they <em>were</em> different.
I clung desperately to the words of Peter Pienaar.</p>

<p>Then something awoke me.</p>

<p>The old man laid down his hand to light a cigar. He didn’t pick
it up at once, but sat back for a moment in his chair, with his
fingers tapping on his knees.</p>

<p>It was the movement I remembered when I had stood before him
in the moorland farm, with the pistols of his servants behind
me.</p>

<p>A little thing, lasting only a second, and the odds were a thousand
to one that I might have had my eyes on my cards at the time and
missed it. But I didn’t, and, in a flash, the air seemed to clear.
Some shadow lifted from my brain, and I was looking at the three
men with full and absolute recognition.</p>

<p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck ten o’clock.</p>

<p>The three faces seemed to change before my eyes and reveal their
secrets. The young one was the murderer. Now I saw cruelty and
ruthlessness, where before I had only seen good-humour. His knife,
I made certain, had skewered Scudder to the floor. His kind had
put the bullet in Karolides.</p>

<p>The plump man’s features seemed to dislimn, and form again, as
I looked at them. He hadn’t a face, only a hundred masks that
he could assume when he pleased. That chap must have been a superb
actor. Perhaps he had been Lord Alloa of the night before; perhaps
not; it didn’t matter. I wondered if he was the fellow who had
first tracked Scudder, and left his card on him. Scudder had said
he lisped, and I could imagine how the adoption of a lisp might
add terror.</p>

<p>But the old man was the pick of the lot. He was sheer brain,
icy, cool, calculating, as ruthless as a steam hammer. Now that
my eyes were opened I wondered where I had seen the benevolence.
His jaw was like chilled steel, and his eyes had the inhuman luminosity
of a bird’s. I went on playing, and every second a greater hate
welled up in my heart. It almost choked me, and I couldn’t answer
when my partner spoke. Only a little longer could I endure their
company.</p>

<p>"Whew! Bob! Look at the time," said the old man. "You’d better
think about catching your train. Bob’s got to go to town tonight,"
he added, turning to me. The voice rang now as false as hell.
I looked at the clock, and it was nearly half-past ten.</p>

<p>"I am afraid he must put off his journey," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, damn," said the young man. "I thought you had dropped that
rot. I’ve simply got to go. You can have my address, and I’ll
give any security you like."</p>

<p>"No," I said, "you must stay."</p>

<p>At that I think they must have realized that the game was desperate.
Their only chance had been to convince me that I was playing the
fool, and that had failed. But the old man spoke again.</p>

<p>"I’ll go bail for my nephew. That ought to content you, Mr Hannay."
Was it fancy, or did I detect some halt in the smoothness of that
voice?</p>

<p>There must have been, for as I glanced at him, his eyelids fell
in that hawk-like hood which fear had stamped on my memory.</p>

<p>I blew my whistle.</p>

<p>In an instant the lights were out. A pair of strong arms gripped
me round the waist, covering the pockets in which a man might
be expected to carry a pistol.</p>

<p>"<em>Schnell, Franz,</em>’ cried a voice, "<em>das Boot, das
Boot!</em>" As it spoke I saw two of my fellows emerge on the
moonlit lawn.</p>

<p>The young dark man leapt for the window, was through it, and
over the low fence before a hand could touch him. I grappled the
old chap, and the room seemed to fill with figures. I saw the
plump one collared, but my eyes were all for the out-of-doors,
where Franz sped on over the road towards the railed entrance
to the beach stairs. One man followed him, but he had no chance.
The gate of the stairs locked behind the fugitive, and I stood
staring, with my hands on the old boy’s throat, for such a time
as a man might take to descend those steps to the sea.</p>

<p>Suddenly my prisoner broke from me and flung himself on the wall.
There was a click as if a lever had been pulled. Then came a low
rumbling far, far below the ground, and through the window I saw
a cloud of chalky dust pouring out of the shaft of the stairway.</p>

<p>Someone switched on the light.</p>

<p>The old man was looking at me with blazing eyes.</p>

<p>"He is safe," he cried. "You cannot follow in time.... He is
gone.... He has triumphed.... <em>Der Schwarze Stein ist in der
Siegeskrone.</em>"</p>

<p>There was more in those eyes than any common triumph. They had
been hooded like a bird of prey, and now they flamed with a hawk’s
pride. A white fanatic heat burned in them, and I realized for
the first time the terrible thing I had been up against. This
man was more than a spy; in his foul way he had been a patriot.</p>

<p>As the handcuffs clinked on his wrists I said my last word to
him.</p>

<p>"I hope Franz will bear his triumph well. I ought to tell you
that the <em>Ariadne</em> for the last hour has been in our hands."</p>
