<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The following evening—it was the 20th day of March—I started
for France after the dark fell. I drove Ivery’s big closed car,
and within sat its owner, bound and gagged, as others had sat
before him on the same errand. Geordie Hamilton and Amos were
his companions. From what Blenkiron had himself discovered and
from the papers seized in the Pink Chalet I had full details of
the road and its mysterious stages. It was like the journey of
a mad dream. In a back street of a little town I would exchange
passwords with a nameless figure and be given instructions. At
a wayside inn at an appointed hour a voice speaking a thick German
would advise that this bridge or that railway crossing had been
cleared. At a hamlet among pine woods an unknown man would clamber
up beside me and take me past a sentry-post. Smooth as clockwork
was the machine, till in the dawn of a spring morning I found
myself dropping into a broad valley through little orchards just
beginning to blossom, and I knew that I was in France. After that,
Blenkiron’s own arrangements began, and soon I was drinking coffee
with a young lieutenant of Chasseurs, and had taken the gag from
Ivery’s mouth. The bluecoats looked curiously at the man in the
green ulster whose face was the colour of clay and who lit cigarette
from cigarette with a shaky hand.</p>

<p>The lieutenant rang up a General of Division who knew all about
us. At his headquarters I explained my purpose, and he telegraphed
to an Army Headquarters for a permission which was granted. It
was not for nothing that in January I had seen certain great personages
in Paris, and that Blenkiron had wired ahead of me to prepare
the way. Here I handed over Ivery and his guard, for I wanted
them to proceed to Amiens under French supervision, well knowing
that the men of that great army are not used to let slip what
they once hold.</p>

<p>It was a morning of clear spring sunlight when we breakfasted
in that little red-roofed town among vineyards with a shining
river looping at our feet. The General of Division was an Algerian
veteran with a brush of grizzled hair, whose eye kept wandering
to a map on the wall where pins and stretched thread made a spider’s
web.</p>

<p>"Any news from the north?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he said. "But the attack comes soon. It will be against
our army in Champagne." With a lean finger he pointed out the
enemy dispositions.</p>

<p>"Why not against the British?" I asked. With a knife and fork
I made a right angle and put a salt dish in the centre. "That
is the German concentration. They can so mass that we do not know
which side of the angle they will strike till the blow falls."</p>

<p>"It is true," he replied. "But consider. For the enemy to attack
towards the Somme would be to fight over many miles of an old
battle-ground where all is still desert and every yard of which
you British know. In Champagne at a bound he might enter unbroken
country. It is a long and difficult road to Amiens, but not so
long to Chilons. Such is the view of Pétain. Does it convince
you?"</p>

<p>"The reasoning is good. Nevertheless he will strike at Amiens,
and I think he will begin today."</p>

<p>He laughed and shrugged his shoulders. "<em>Nous verrons</em>.
You are obstinate, my general, like all your excellent countrymen."</p>

<p>But as I left his headquarters an aide-de-camp handed him a message
on a pink slip. He read it, and turned to me with a grave face.</p>

<p>"You have a <em>flair</em>, my friend. I am glad we did not wager.
This morning at dawn there is great fighting around St Quentin.
Be comforted, for they will not pass. Your <em>Maréchal</em> will
hold them."</p>

<p>That was the first news I had of the battle.</p>

<p>At Dijon according to plan I met the others. I only just caught
the Paris train, and Blenkiron’s great wrists lugged me into the
carriage when it was well in motion. There sat Peter, a docile
figure in a carefully patched old <em>R.F.C. </em>uniform. Wake
was reading a pile of French papers, and in a corner Mary, with
her feet up on the seat, was sound asleep.</p>

<p>We did not talk much, for the life of the past days had been
so hectic that we had no wish to recall it. Blenkiron’s face wore
an air of satisfaction, and as he looked out at the sunny spring
landscape he hummed his only tune. Even Wake had lost his restlessness.
He had on a pair of big tortoiseshell reading glasses, and when
he looked up from his newspaper and caught my eye he smiled. Mary
slept like a child, delicately flushed, her breath scarcely stirring
the collar of the greatcoat which was folded across her throat.
I remember looking with a kind of awe at the curve of her young
face and the long lashes that lay so softly on her cheek, and
wondering how I had borne the anxiety of the last months. Wake
raised his head from his reading, glanced at Mary and then at
me, and his eyes were kind, almost affectionate. He seemed to
have won peace of mind among the hills.</p>

<p>Only Peter was out of the picture. He was a strange, disconsolate
figure, as he shifted about to ease his leg, or gazed incuriously
from the window. He had shaved his beard again, but it did not
make him younger, for his face was too lined and his eyes too
old to change. When I spoke to him he looked towards Mary and
held up a warning finger.</p>

<p>"I go back to England," he whispered. "Your little <em>mysie</em>
is going to take care of me till I am settled. We spoke of it
yesterday at my cottage. I will find a lodging and be patient
till the war is over. And you, Dick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I rejoin my division. Thank God, this job is over. I have
an easy <em>trund</em> now and can turn my attention to straight-forward
soldiering. I don’t mind telling you that I’ll be glad to think
that you and Mary and Blenkiron are safe at home. What about you,
Wake?"</p>

<p>"I go back to my Labour battalion," he said cheerfully. "Like
you, I have an easier mind."</p>

<p>I shook my head. "We’ll see about that. I don’t like such sinful
waste. We’ve had a bit of campaigning together and I know your
quality."</p>

<p>"The battalion’s quite good enough for me," and he relapsed into
a day-old <em>Journal</em>.</p>

<p>Mary had suddenly woke, and was sitting upright with her fists
in her eyes like a small child. Her hand flew to her hair, and
her eyes ran over us as if to see that we were all there. As she
counted the four of us she seemed relieved.</p>

<p>"I reckon you feel refreshed, Miss Mary," said Blenkiron. "It’s
good to think that now we can sleep in peace, all of us. Pretty
soon you’ll be in England and spring will be beginning, and please
God it’ll be the start of a better world. Our work’s over, anyhow."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the girl gravely. "I don’t think there’s any
discharge in this war. Dick, have you news of the battle? This
was the day."</p>

<p>"It’s begun," I said, and told them the little I had learned
from the French General. "I’ve made a reputation as a prophet,
for he thought the attack was coming in Champagne. It’s St Quentin
right enough, but I don’t know what has happened. We’ll hear in
Paris."</p>

<p>Mary had woke with a startled air as if she remembered her old
instinct that our work would not be finished without a sacrifice,
and that sacrifice the best of us. The notion kept recurring to
me with an uneasy insistence. But soon she appeared to forget
her anxiety. That afternoon as we journeyed through the pleasant
land of France she was in holiday mood, and she forced all our
spirits up to her level. It was calm, bright weather, the long
curves of ploughland were beginning to quicken into green, the
catkins made a blue mist on the willows by the watercourses, and
in the orchards by the red-roofed hamlets the blossom was breaking.
In such a scene it was hard to keep the mind sober and grey, and
the pall of war slid from us. Mary cosseted and fussed over Peter
like an elder sister over a delicate little boy. She made him
stretch his bad leg full length on the seat, and when she made
tea for the party of us it was a protesting Peter who had the
last sugar biscuit. Indeed, we were almost a merry company, for
Blenkiron told stories of old hunting and engineering days in
the West, and Peter and I were driven to cap them, and Mary asked
provocative questions, and Wake listened with amused interest.
It was well that we had the carriage to ourselves, for no queerer
rigs were ever assembled. Mary, as always, was neat and workmanlike
in her dress; Blenkiron was magnificent in a suit of russet tweed
with a pale-blue shirt and collar, and well-polished brown shoes;
but Peter and Wake were in uniforms which had seen far better
days, and I wore still the boots and the shapeless and ragged
clothes of Joseph Zimmer, the porter from Arosa.</p>

<p>We appeared to forget the war, but we didn’t, for it was in the
background of all our minds. Somewhere in the north there was
raging a desperate fight, and its issue was the true test of our
success or failure. Mary showed it by bidding me ask for news
at every stopping-place. I asked gendarmes and <em>permissionnaires</em>,
but I learned nothing. Nobody had ever heard of the battle. The
upshot was that for the last hour we all fell silent, and when
we reached Paris about seven o’clock my first errand was to the
bookstall.</p>

<p>I bought a batch of evening papers, which we tried to read in
the taxis that carried us to our hotel. Sure enough there was
the announcement in big headlines. The enemy had attacked in great
strength from south of Arras to the Oise; but everywhere he had
been repulsed and held in our battle-zone. The leading articles
were confident, the notes by the various military critics were
almost braggart. At last the German had been driven to an offensive,
and the Allies would have the opportunity they had longed for
of proving their superior fighting strength. It was, said one
and all, the opening of the last phase of the war.</p>

<p>I confess that as I read my heart sank. If the civilians were
so over-confident, might not the generals have fallen into the
same trap? Blenkiron alone was unperturbed. Mary said nothing,
but she sat with her chin in her hands, which with her was a sure
sign of deep preoccupation.</p>

<p>Next morning the papers could tell us little more. The main attack
had been on both sides of St Quentin, and though the British had
given ground it was only the outposts line that had gone. The
mist had favoured the enemy, and his bombardment had been terrific,
especially the gas shells. Every journal added the old old comment—that
he had paid heavily for his temerity, with losses far exceeding
those of the defence.</p>

<p>Wake appeared at breakfast in his private’s uniform. He wanted
to get his railway warrant and be off at once, but when I heard
that Amiens was his destination I ordered him to stay and travel
with me in the afternoon. I was in uniform myself now and had
taken charge of the outfit. I arranged that Blenkiron, Mary, and
Peter should go on to Boulogne and sleep the night there, while
Wake and I would be dropped at Amiens to await instructions.</p>

<p>I spent a busy morning. Once again I visited with Blenkiron the
little cabinet in the Boulevard St Germain, and told in every
detail our work of the past two months. Once again I sat in the
low building beside the Invalides and talked to staff officers.
But some of the men I had seen on the first visit were not there.
The chiefs of the French Army had gone north.</p>

<p>We arranged for the handling of the Wild Birds, now safely in
France, and sanction was given to the course I had proposed to
adopt with Ivery. He and his guard were on their way to Amiens,
and I would meet them there on the morrow. The great men were
very complimentary to us, so complimentary that my knowledge of
grammatical French ebbed away and I could only stutter in reply.
That telegram sent by Blenkiron on the night of the 18th, from
the information given me in the Pink Chalet, had done wonders
in clearing up the situation.</p>

<p>But when I asked them about the battle they could tell me little.
It was a very serious attack in tremendous force, but the British
line was strong and the reserves were believed to be sufficient.
Pétain and Foch had gone north to consult with Haig. The situation
in Champagne was still obscure, but some French reserves were
already moving thence to the Somme sector. One thing they did
show me, the British dispositions. As I looked at the plan I saw
that my old division was in the thick of the fighting.</p>

<p>"Where do you go now?" I was asked.</p>

<p>"To Amiens, and then, please God, to the battle front," I said.</p>

<p>"Good fortune to you. You do not give body or mind much rest,
my general."</p>

<p>After that I went to the <em>Mission Anglaise</em>, but they
had nothing beyond Haig’s <em>communiqué</em> and a telephone
message from <em>G.H.Q. </em>that the critical sector was likely
to be that between St Quentin and the Oise. The northern pillar
of our defence, south of Arras, which they had been nervous about,
had stood like a rock. That pleased me, for my old battalion of
the Lennox Highlanders was there.</p>

<p>Crossing the Place de la Concorde, we fell in with a British
staff officer of my acquaintance, who was just starting to motor
back to <em>G.H.Q. </em>from Paris leave. He had a longer face
than the people at the Invalides.</p>

<p>"I don’t like it, I tell you," he said. "It’s this mist that
worries me. I went down the whole line from Arras to the Oise
ten days ago. It was beautifully sited, the cleverest thing you
ever saw. The outpost line was mostly a chain of blobs—redoubts,
you know, with machine-guns—so arranged as to bring flanking fire
to bear on the advancing enemy. But mist would play the devil
with that scheme, for the enemy would be past the place for flanking
fire before we knew it... Oh, I know we had good warning, and
had the battle-zone manned in time, but the outpost line was meant
to hold out long enough to get everything behind in apple-pie
order, and I can’t see but how big chunks of it must have gone
in the first rush.... Mind you, we’ve banked everything on that
battle-zone. It’s damned good, but if it’s gone—" He flung up
his hands.</p>

<p>"Have we good reserves?" I asked.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Have we positions prepared behind the battle-zone?"</p>

<p>"I didn’t notice any," he said dryly, and was off before I could
get more out of him.</p>

<p>"You look rattled, Dick," said Blenkiron as we walked to the
hotel.</p>

<p>"I seem to have got the needle. It’s silly, but I feel worse
about this show than I’ve ever felt since the war started. Look
at this city here. The papers take it easily, and the people are
walking about as if nothing was happening. Even the soldiers aren’t
worried. You may call me a fool to take it so hard, but I’ve a
sense in my bones that we’re in for the bloodiest and darkest
fight of our lives, and that soon Paris will be hearing the Boche
guns as she did in 1914."</p>

<p>"You’re a cheerful old Jeremiah. Well, I’m glad Miss Mary’s going
to be in England soon. Seems to me she’s right and that this game
of ours isn’t quite played out yet. I’m envying you some, for
there’s a place waiting for you in the fighting line."</p>

<p>"You’ve got to get home and keep people’s heads straight there.
That’s the weak link in our chain and there’s a mighty lot of
work before you."</p>

<p>"Maybe," he said abstractedly, with his eye on the top of the
Vendome column.</p>

<p>The train that afternoon was packed with officers recalled from
leave, and it took all the combined purchase of Blenkiron and
myself to get a carriage reserved for our little party. At the
last moment I opened the door to admit a warm and agitated captain
of the <em>R.F.C. </em>in whom I recognised my friend and benefactor,
Archie Roylance.</p>

<p>"Just when I was gettin’ nice and clean and comfy a wire comes
tellin’ me to bundle back, all along of a new battle. It’s a cruel
war, Sir." The afflicted young man mopped his forehead, grinned
cheerfully at Blenkiron, glanced critically at Peter, then caught
sight of Mary and grew at once acutely conscious of his appearance.
He smoothed his hair, adjusted his tie and became desperately
sedate.</p>

<p>I introduced him to Peter and he promptly forgot Mary’s existence.
If Peter had had any vanity in him it would have been flattered
by the frank interest and admiration in the boy’s eyes. "I’m tremendously
glad to see you safe back, sir. I’ve always hoped I might have
a chance of meeting you. We want you badly now on the front. Lensch
is gettin’ a bit uppish."</p>

<p>Then his eye fell on Peter’s withered leg and he saw that he
had blundered. He blushed scarlet and looked his apologies. But
they weren’t needed, for it cheered Peter to meet someone who
talked of the possibility of his fighting again. Soon the two
were deep in technicalities, the appalling technicalities of the
airman. It was no good listening to their talk, for you could
make nothing of it, but it was bracing up Peter like wine. Archie
gave him a minute description of Lensch’s latest doings and his
new methods. He, too, had heard the rumour that Peter had mentioned
to me at St Anton, of a new Boche plane, with mighty engines and
stumpy wings cunningly cambered, which was a devil to climb; but
no specimens had yet appeared over the line. They talked of Bali,
and Rhys Davids, and Bishop, and McCudden, and all the heroes
who had won their spurs since the Somme, and of the new British
makes, most of which Peter had never seen and had to have explained
to him.</p>

<p>Outside a haze had drawn over the meadows with the twilight.
I pointed it out to Blenkiron.</p>

<p>"There’s the fog that’s doing us. This March weather is just
like October, mist morning and evening. I wish to Heaven we could
have some good old drenching spring rain."</p>

<p>Archie was discoursing of the Shark-Gladas machine.</p>

<p>"I’ve always stuck to it, for it’s a marvel in its way, but it
has my heart fairly broke. The General here knows its little tricks.
Don’t you, sir? Whenever things get really excitin’, the engine’s
apt to quit work and take a rest."</p>

<p>"The whole make should be publicly burned," I said, with gloomy
recollections.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t go so far, sir. The old Gladas has surprisin’ merits.
On her day there’s nothing like her for pace and climbing-power,
and she steers as sweet as a racin’ cutter. The trouble about
her is she’s too complicated. She’s like some breeds of car—you
want to be a mechanical genius to understand her.... If they’d
only get her a little simpler and safer, there wouldn’t be her
match in the field. I’m about the only man that has patience with
her and knows her merits, but she’s often been nearly the death
of me. All the same, if I were in for a big fight against some
fellow like Lensch, where it was neck or nothing, I’m hanged if
I wouldn’t pick the Gladas."</p>

<p>Archie laughed apologetically. "The subject is banned for me
in our mess. I’m the old thing’s only champion, and she’s like
a mare I used to hunt that loved me so much she was always tryin’
to chew the arm off me. But I wish I could get her a fair trial
from one of the big pilots. I’m only in the second class myself
after all."</p>

<p>We were running north of St Just when above the rattle of the
train rose a curious dull sound. It came from the east, and was
like the low growl of a veld thunderstorm, or a steady roll of
muffled drums.</p>

<p>"Hark to the guns!" cried Archie. "My aunt, there’s a tidy bombardment
goin’ on somewhere."</p>

<p>I had been listening on and off to guns for three years. I had
been present at the big preparations before Loos and the Somme
and Arras, and I had come to accept the racket of artillery as
something natural and inevitable like rain or sunshine. But this
sound chilled me with its eeriness, I don’t know why. Perhaps
it was its unexpectedness, for I was sure that the guns had not
been heard in this area since before the Marne. The noise must
be travelling down the Oise valley, and I judged there was big
fighting somewhere about Chauny or La Fere. That meant that the
enemy was pressing hard on a huge front, for here was clearly
a great effort on his extreme left wing. Unless it was our counter-attack.
But somehow I didn’t think so.</p>

<p>I let down the window and stuck my head into the night. The fog
had crept to the edge of the track, a gossamer mist through which
houses and trees and cattle could be seen dim in the moonlight.
The noise continued—not a mutter, but a steady rumbling flow as
solid as the blare of a trumpet. Presently, as we drew nearer
Amiens, we left it behind us, for in all the Somme valley there
is some curious configuration which blankets sound. The countryfolk
call it the "Silent Land", and during the first phase of the Somme
battle a man in Amiens could not hear the guns twenty miles off
at Albert.</p>

<p>As I sat down again I found that the company had fallen silent,
even the garrulous Archie. Mary’s eyes met mine, and in the indifferent
light of the French railway-carriage I could see excitement in
them—I knew it was excitement, not fear. She had never heard the
noise of a great barrage before. Blenkiron was restless, and Peter
was sunk in his own thoughts. I was growing very depressed, for
in a little I would have to part from my best friends and the
girl I loved. But with the depression was mixed an odd expectation,
which was almost pleasant. The guns had brought back my profession
to me, I was moving towards their thunder, and God only knew the
end of it. The happy dream I had dreamed of the Cotswolds and
a home with Mary beside me seemed suddenly to have fallen away
to an infinite distance. I felt once again that I was on the razor-edge
of life.</p>

<p>The last part of the journey I was casting back to rake up my
knowledge of the countryside. I saw again the stricken belt from
Serre to Combles where we had fought in the summer of ’17. I had
not been present in the advance of the following spring, but I
had been at Cambrai and I knew all the down country from Lagnicourt
to St Quentin. I shut my eyes and tried to picture it, and to
see the roads running up to the line, and wondered just at what
points the big pressure had come. They had told me in Paris that
the British were as far south as the Oise, so the bombardment
we had heard must be directed to our address. With Passchendaele
and Cambrai in my mind, and some notion of the difficulties we
had always had in getting drafts, I was puzzled to think where
we could have found the troops to man the new front. We must be
unholily thin on that long line. And against that awesome bombardment!
And the masses and the new tactics that Ivery had bragged of!</p>

<p>When we ran into the dingy cavern which is Amiens station I seemed
to note a new excitement. I felt it in the air rather than deduced
it from any special incident, except that the platform was very
crowded with civilians, most of them with an extra amount of baggage.
I wondered if the place had been bombed the night before.</p>

<p>"We won’t say goodbye yet," I told the others. "The train doesn’t
leave for half an hour. I’m off to try and get news."</p>

<p>Accompanied by Archie, I hunted out an <em>R.T.O. </em>of my
acquaintance. To my questions he responded cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, we’re doing famously, sir. I heard this afternoon from a
man in Operations that <em>G.H.Q. </em>was perfectly satisfied.
We’ve killed a lot of Huns and only lost a few kilometres of ground....
You’re going to your division? Well, it’s up Peronne way, or was
last night. Cheyne and Dunthorpe came back from leave and tried
to steal a car to get up to it.... Oh, I’m having the deuce of
a time. These blighted civilians have got the wind up, and a lot
are trying to clear out. The idiots say the Huns will be in Amiens
in a week. What’s the phrase? ‘<em>Pourvu que les civils tiennent.</em>’
"Fraid I must push on, Sir."</p>

<p>I sent Archie back with these scraps of news and was about to
make a rush for the house of one of the Press officers, who would,
I thought, be in the way of knowing things, when at the station
entrance I ran across Laidlaw. He had been <em>B.G.G.S. </em>in
the corps to which my old brigade belonged, and was now on the
staff of some army. He was striding towards a car when I grabbed
his arm, and he turned on me a very sick face.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, Hannay! Where did you spring from? The news, you
say?" He sank his voice, and drew me into a quiet corner. "The
news is hellish."</p>

<p>"They told me we were holding," I observed.</p>

<p>"Holding be damned! The Boche is clean through on a broad front.
He broke us today at Maissemy and Essigny. Yes, the battle-zone.
He’s flinging in division after division like the blows of a hammer.
What else could you expect?" And he clutched my arm fiercely.
"How in God’s name could eleven divisions hold a front of forty
miles? And against four to one in numbers? It isn’t war, it’s
naked lunacy."</p>

<p>I knew the worst now, and it didn’t shock me, for I had known
it was coming. Laidlaw’s nerves were pretty bad, for his face
was pale and his eyes bright like a man with a fever.</p>

<p>"Reserves!" and he laughed bitterly. "We have three infantry
divisions and two cavalry. They’re into the mill long ago. The
French are coming up on our right, but they’ve the devil of a
way to go. That’s what I’m down here about. And we’re getting
help from Horne and Plumer. But all that takes days, and meantime
we’re walking back like we did at Mons. And at this time of day,
too.... Oh, yes, the whole line’s retreating. Parts of it were
pretty comfortable, but they had to get back or be put in the
bag. I wish to Heaven I knew where our right divisions have got
to. For all I know they’re at Compiegne by now. The Boche was
over the canal this morning, and by this time most likely he’s
across the Somme."</p>

<p>At that I exclaimed. "D’you mean to tell me we’re going to lose
Peronne?"</p>

<p>"Peronne!" he cried. "We’ll be lucky not to lose Amiens!... And
on the top of it all I’ve got some kind of blasted fever. I’ll
be raving in an hour."</p>

<p>He was rushing off, but I held him.</p>

<p>"What about my old lot?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, damned good, but they’re shot all to bits. Every division
did well. It’s a marvel they weren’t all scuppered, and it’ll
be a flaming miracle if they find a line they can stand on. Westwater’s
got a leg smashed. He was brought down this evening, and you’ll
find him in the hospital. Fraser’s killed and Lefroy’s a prisoner—at
least, that was my last news. I don’t know who’s got the brigades,
but Masterton’s carrying on with the division.... You’d better
get up the line as fast as you can and take over from him. See
the Army Commander. He’ll be in Amiens tomorrow morning for a
pow-wow."</p>

<p>Laidlaw lay wearily back in his car and disappeared into the
night, while I hurried to the train.</p>

<p>The others had descended to the platform and were grouped round
Archie, who was discoursing optimistic nonsense. I got them into
the carriage and shut the door.</p>

<p>"It’s pretty bad," I said. "The front’s pierced in several places
and we’re back to the Upper Somme. I’m afraid it isn’t going to
stop there. I’m off up the line as soon as I can get my orders.
Wake, you’ll come with me, for every man will be wanted. Blenkiron,
you’ll see Mary and Peter safe to England. We’re just in time,
for tomorrow it mightn’t be easy to get out of Amiens."</p>

<p>I can see yet the anxious faces in that ill-lit compartment.
We said goodbye after the British style without much to-do. I
remember that old Peter gripped my hand as if he would never release
it, and that Mary’s face had grown very pale. If I delayed another
second I should have howled, for Mary’s lips were trembling and
Peter had eyes like a wounded stag. "God bless you," I said hoarsely,
and as I went off I heard Peter’s voice, a little cracked, saying
"God bless you, my old friend."</p>

<p>I spent some weary hours looking for Westwater. He was not in
the big clearing station, but I ran him to earth at last in the
new hospital which had just been got going in the Ursuline convent.
He was the most sterling little man, in ordinary life rather dry
and dogmatic, with a trick of taking you up sharply which didn’t
make him popular. Now he was lying very stiff and quiet in the
hospital bed, and his blue eyes were solemn and pathetic like
a sick dog’s.</p>

<p>"There’s nothing much wrong with me," he said, in reply to my
question. "A shell dropped beside me and damaged my foot. They
say they’ll have to cut it off.... I’ve an easier mind now you’re
here, Hannay. Of course you’ll take over from Masterton. He’s
a good man but not quite up to his job. Poor Fraser—you’ve heard
about Fraser. He was done in at the very start. Yes, a shell.
And Lefroy. If he’s alive and not too badly smashed the Hun has
got a troublesome prisoner."</p>

<p>He was too sick to talk, but he wouldn’t let me go.</p>

<p>"The division was all right. Don’t you believe anyone who says
we didn’t fight like heroes. Our outpost line held up the Hun
for six hours, and only about a dozen men came back. We could
have stuck it out in the battle-zone if both flanks hadn’t been
turned. They got through Crabbe’s left and came down the Verey
ravine, and a big wave rushed Shropshire Wood.... We fought it
out yard by yard and didn’t budge till we saw the Plessis dump
blazing in our rear. Then it was about time to go.... We haven’t
many battalion commanders left. Watson, Endicot, Crawshay...."
He stammered out a list of gallant fellows who had gone.</p>

<p>"Get back double quick, Hannay. They want you. I’m not happy
about Masterton. He’s too young for the job." And then a nurse
drove me out, and I left him speaking in the strange forced voice
of great weakness.</p>

<p>At the foot of the staircase stood Mary.</p>

<p>"I saw you go in," she said, "so I waited for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear," I cried, "you should have been in Boulogne by
now. What madness brought you here?"</p>

<p>"They know me here and they’ve taken me on. You couldn’t expect
me to stay behind. You said yourself everybody was wanted, and
I’m in a Service like you. Please don’t be angry, Dick."</p>

<p>I wasn’t angry, I wasn’t even extra anxious. The whole thing
seemed to have been planned by fate since the creation of the
world. The game we had been engaged in wasn’t finished and it
was right that we should play it out together. With that feeling
came a conviction, too, of ultimate victory. Somehow or sometime
we should get to the end of our pilgrimage. But I remembered Mary’s
forebodings about the sacrifice required. <em>The best of us</em>.
That ruled me out, but what about her?</p>

<p>I caught her to my arms. "Goodbye, my very dearest. Don’t worry
about me, for mine’s a soft job and I can look after my skin.
But oh! take care of yourself, for you are all the world to me."</p>

<p>She kissed me gravely like a wise child.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid for you," she said. "You are going to stand
in the breach, and I know—I know you will win. Remember that there
is someone here whose heart is so full of pride of her man that
it hasn’t room for fear."</p>

<p>As I went out of the convent door I felt that once again I had
been given my orders.</p>

<p>It did not surprise me that, when I sought out my room on an
upper floor of the Hôtel de France, I found Blenkiron in the corridor.
He was in the best of spirits.</p>

<p>"You can’t keep me out of the show, Dick," he said, "so you needn’t
start arguing. Why, this is the one original chance of a lifetime
for John S. Blenkiron. Our little fight at Erzerum was only a
side-show, but this is a real high-class Armageddon. I guess I’ll
find a way to make myself useful."</p>

<p>I had no doubt he would, and I was glad he had stayed behind.
But I felt it was hard on Peter to have the job of returning to
England alone at such a time, like useless flotsam washed up by
a flood.</p>

<p>"You needn’t worry," said Blenkiron. "Peter’s not making England
this trip. To the best of my knowledge he has beat it out of this
township by the eastern postern. He had some talk with Sir Archibald
Roylance, and presently other gentlemen of the Royal Flying Corps
appeared, and the upshot was that Sir Archibald hitched on to
Peter’s grip and departed without saying farewell. My notion is
that he’s gone to have a few words with his old friends at some
flying station. Or he might have the idea of going back to England
by aeroplane, and so having one last flutter before he folds his
wings. Anyhow, Peter looked a mighty happy man. The last I saw
he was smoking his pipe with a batch of young lads in a Flying
Corps waggon and heading straight for Germany."</p>
