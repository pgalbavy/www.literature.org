<p><em>ALL </em>Danny Meadow Mouse could think about was his short
tail. He was so ashamed of it that whenever any one passed, he
crawled out of sight so that they should not see how short his
tail is. Instead of playing in the sunshine as he used to do,
he sat and sulked. Pretty soon his friends began to pass without
stopping. Finally one day old Mr. Toad sat down in front of Danny
and began to ask questions.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter?" asked old Mr. Toad.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Danny Meadow Mouse.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Got plenty to eat and drink, haven’t you?" continued
Mr. Toad. <em>Page 6.</em>]</p>

<p>"I don’t suppose that there really is anything the matter, but
what do you think is the matter?" said old Mr. Toad.</p>

<p>Danny fidgeted, and old Mr. Toad looked up at jolly, round, red
Mr. Sun and winked. "Sun is just as bright as ever, isn’t it?"
he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Danny.</p>

<p>"Got plenty to eat and drink, haven’t you?" continued Mr. Toad.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Danny.</p>

<p>"Seems to me that that is a pretty good looking suit of clothes
you’re wearing," said Mr. Toad, eyeing Danny critically. "Sunny
weather, plenty to eat and drink, and good clothes—must be you
don’t know when you’re well off, Danny Meadow Mouse."</p>

<p>Danny hung his head. Finally he looked up and caught a kindly
twinkle in old Mr. Toad’s eyes. "Mr. Toad, how can I get a long
tail like my cousin Whitefoot of the Green Forest?" he asked.</p>

<p>"So that’s what’s the matter! Ha! ha! ha! Danny Meadow Mouse,
I’m ashamed of you! I certainly am ashamed of you!" said Mr. Toad.
"What good would a long tail do you? Tell me that."</p>

<p>For a minute Danny didn’t know just what to say. "I—I—I’d look
so much better if I had a long tail," he ventured.</p>

<p>Old Mr. Toad just laughed. "You never saw a Meadow Mouse with
a long tail, did you? Of course not. What a sight it would be!
Why, everybody on the Green Meadows would laugh themselves sick
at the sight! You see you need to be slim and trim and handsome
to carry a long tail well. And then what a nuisance it would be!
You would always have to be thinking of your tail and taking care
to keep it out of harm’s way. Look at me. I’m homely. Some folks
call me ugly to look at. But no one tries to catch me as Farmer
Brown’s boy does Billy Mink because of his fine coat; and no one
wants to put me in a cage because of a fine voice. I am satisfied
to be just as I am, and if you’ll take my advice, Danny Meadow
Mouse, you’ll be satisfied to be just as you are."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," said Danny Meadow Mouse after a little.
"I’ll try."</p>
