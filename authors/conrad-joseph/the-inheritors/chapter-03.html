<p><em>THREE</em></p>

<p>To encourage me, I suppose, Callan gave me the proof-sheets of
his next to read in bed. The thing was so bad that it nearly sickened
me of him and his jobs. I tried to read the stuff; to read it
conscientiously, to read myself to sleep with it. I was under
obligations to old Cal and I wanted to do him justice, but the
thing was impossible. I fathomed a sort of a plot. It dealt in
fratricide with a touch of adultery; a Great Moral Purpose loomed
in the background. It would have been a dully readable novel but
for that; as it was, it was intolerable. It was amazing that Cal
himself could put out such stuff; that he should have the impudence.
He was not a fool, not by any means a fool. It revolted me more
than a little.</p>

<p>I came to it out of a different plane of thought. I may not have
been able to write then&mdash;or I may; but I did know enough to recognise
the flagrantly, the indecently bad, and, upon my soul, the idea
that I, too, must cynically offer this sort of stuff if I was
ever to sell my tens of thousands very nearly sent me back to
my solitude. Callan had begun very much as I was beginning now;
he had even, I believe, had ideals in his youth and had starved
a little. It was rather trying to think that perhaps I was really
no more than another Callan, that, when at last I came to review
my life, I should have much such a record to look back upon. It
disgusted me a little, and when I put out the light the horrors
settled down upon me.</p>

<p>I woke in a shivering frame of mind, ashamed to meet Callan's
eye. It was as if he must be aware of my over-night thoughts,
as if he must think me a fool who quarrelled with my victuals.
He gave no signs of any such knowledge&mdash;was dignified, cordial;
discussed his breakfast with gusto, opened his letters, and so
on. An an√¶mic amanuensis was taking notes for appropriate replies.
How could I tell him that I would not do the work, that I was
too proud and all the rest of it? He would have thought me a fool,
would have stiffened into hostility, I should have lost my last
chance. And, in the broad light of day, I was loath to do that.</p>

<p>He began to talk about indifferent things; we glided out on to
a current of mediocre conversation. The psychical moment, if there
were any such, disappeared.</p>

<p>Someone bearing my name had written to express an intention of
offering personal worship that afternoon. The prospect seemed
to please the great Cal. He was used to such things; he found
them pay, I suppose. We began desultorily to discuss the possibility
of the writer's being a relation of mine; I doubted. I had no
relations that I knew of; there was a phenomenal old aunt who
had inherited the acres and respectability of the Etchingham Grangers,
but she was not the kind of person to worship a novelist. I, the
poor last of the family, was without the pale, simply because
I, too, was a novelist. I explained these things to Callan and
he commented on them, found it strange how small or how large,
I forget which, the world was. Since his own apotheosis shoals
of Callans had claimed relationship.</p>

<p>I ate my breakfast. Afterward, we set about the hatching of that
article&mdash;the thought of it sickens me even now. You will find
it in the volume along with the others; you may see how I lugged
in Callan's surroundings, his writing-room, his dining-room, the
romantic arbour in which he found it easy to write love-scenes,
the clipped trees like peacocks and the trees clipped like bears,
and all the rest of the background for appropriate attitudes.
He was satisfied with any arrangements of words that suggested
a gentle awe on the part of the writer.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said once or twice, "that's just the touch, just
the touch&mdash;very nice. But don't you think...." We lunched after
some time.</p>

<p>I was so happy. Quite pathetically happy. It had come so easy
to me. I had doubted my ability to do the sort of thing; but it
had written itself, as money spends itself, and I was going to
earn money like that. The whole of my past seemed a mistake&mdash;a
childishness. I had kept out of this sort of thing because I had
thought it below me; I had kept out of it and had starved my body
and warped my mind. Perhaps I had even damaged my work by this
isolation. To understand life one must live&mdash;and I had only brooded.
But, by Jove, I would try to live now.</p>

<p>Callan had retired for his accustomed siesta and I was smoking
pipe after pipe over a confoundedly bad French novel that I had
found in the book-shelves. I must have been dozing. A voice from
behind my back announced:</p>

<p>"Miss Etchingham Granger!" and added&mdash;"Mr. Callan will be down
directly." I laid down my pipe, wondered whether I ought to have
been smoking when Cal expected visitors, and rose to my feet.</p>

<p>"You!" I said, sharply. She answered, "You see." She was smiling.
She had been so much in my thoughts that I was hardly surprised&mdash;the
thing had even an air of pleasant inevitability about it.</p>

<p>"You must be a cousin of mine," I said, "the name&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, call it sister," she answered.</p>

<p>I was feeling inclined for farce, if blessed chance would throw
it in my way. You see, I was going to live at last, and life for
me meant irresponsibility.</p>

<p>"Ah!" I said, ironically, "you are going to be a sister to me,
as they say." She might have come the bogy over me last night
in the moonlight, but now ... There was a spice of danger about
it, too, just a touch lurking somewhere. Besides, she was good-looking
and well set up, and I couldn't see what could touch me. Even
if it did, even if I got into a mess, I had no relatives, not
even a friend, to be worried about me. I stood quite alone, and
I half relished the idea of getting into a mess&mdash;it would be part
of life, too. I was going to have a little money, and she excited
my curiosity. I was tingling to know what she was really at.</p>

<p>"And one might ask," I said, "what you are doing in this&mdash;in
this...." I was at a loss for a word to describe the room&mdash;the
smugness parading as professional Bohemianism.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am about my own business," she said, "I told you last
night&mdash;have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>"Last night you were to inherit the earth," I reminded her, "and
one doesn't start in a place like this. Now I should have gone&mdash;well
&mdash;I should have gone to some politician's house&mdash;a cabinet
minister's&mdash;say to Gurnard's. He's the coming man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," she answered, "he's the coming man."</p>

<p>You will remember that, in those days, Gurnard was only the dark
horse of the ministry. I knew little enough of these things, despised
politics generally; they simply didn't interest me. Gurnard I
disliked platonically; perhaps because his face was a little enigmatic&mdash;a
little repulsive. The country, then, was in the position of having
no Opposition and a Cabinet with two distinct strains in it&mdash;the
Churchill and the Gurnard&mdash;and Gurnard was the dark horse.</p>

<p>"Oh, you should join your flats," I said, pleasantly. "If he's
the coming man, where do you come in?... Unless he, too, is a
Dimensionist."</p>

<p>"Oh, both&mdash;both," she answered. I admired the tranquillity with
which she converted my points into her own. And I was very happy&mdash;it
struck me as a pleasant sort of fooling....</p>

<p>"I suppose you will let me know some day who you are?" I said.</p>

<p>"I have told you several times," she answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, you won't frighten me to-day," I asserted, "not here, you
know, and anyhow, why should you want to?"</p>

<p>"I have told you," she said again.</p>

<p>"You've told me you were my sister," I said; "but my sister died
years and years ago. Still, if it suits you, if you want to be
somebody's sister ..."</p>

<p>"It suits me," she answered&mdash;"I want to be placed, you see."</p>

<p>I knew that my name was good enough to place anyone. We had been
the Grangers of Etchingham since&mdash;oh, since the flood. And if
the girl wanted to be my sister and a Granger, why the devil shouldn't
she, so long as she would let me continue on this footing? I hadn't
talked to a woman&mdash;not to a well set-up one&mdash;for ages and ages.
It was as if I had come back from one of the places to which younger
sons exile themselves, and for all I knew it might be the correct
thing for girls to elect brothers nowadays in one set or another.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell me some more," I said, "one likes to know about one's
sister. You and the Right Honourable Charles Gurnard are Dimensionists,
and who are the others of your set?"</p>

<p>"There is only one," she answered. And would you believe it!&mdash;it
seems he was Fox, the editor of my new paper.</p>

<p>"You select your characters with charming indiscriminateness,"
I said. "Fox is only a sort of toad, you know&mdash;he won't get far."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll go far," she answered, "but he won't get there. Fox
is fighting against us."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you don't dwell in amity?" I said. "You fight for your
own hands."</p>

<p>"We fight for our own hands," she answered, "I shall throw Gurnard
over when he's pulled the chestnuts out of the fire."</p>

<p>I was beginning to get a little tired of this. You see, for me,
the scene was a veiled flirtation and I wanted to get on. But
I had to listen to her fantastic scheme of things. It was really
a duel between Fox, the Journal-founder, and Gurnard, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer. Fox, with Churchill, the Foreign Minister, and
his supporters, for pieces, played what he called "the Old Morality
business" against Gurnard, who passed for a cynically immoral
politician.</p>

<p>I grew more impatient. I wanted to get out of this stage into
something more personal. I thought she invented this sort of stuff
to keep me from getting at her errand at Callan's. But I didn't
want to know her errand; I wanted to make love to her. As for
Fox and Gurnard and Churchill, the Foreign Minister, who really
was a sympathetic character and did stand for political probity,
she might be uttering allegorical truths, but I was not interested
in them. I wanted to start some topic that would lead away from
this Dimensionist farce.</p>

<p>"My dear sister," I began.... Callan always moved about like
a confounded eavesdropper, wore carpet slippers, and stepped round
the corners of screens. I expect he got copy like that.</p>

<p>"So, she's your sister?" he said suddenly, from behind me. "Strange
that you shouldn't recognise the handwriting...."</p>

<p>"Oh, we don't correspond," I said light-heartedly, "we are <em>so</em>
different." I wanted to take a rise out of the creeping animal
that he was. He confronted her blandly.</p>

<p>"You must be the little girl that I remember," he said. He had
known my parents ages ago. That, indeed, was how I came to know
him; I wouldn't have chosen him for a friend. "I thought Granger
said you were dead ... but one gets confused...."</p>

<p>"Oh, we see very little of each other," she answered. "Arthur
might have said I was dead&mdash;he's capable of anything, you know."
She spoke with an assumption of sisterly indifference that was
absolutely striking. I began to think she must be an actress of
genius, she did it so well. She <em>was</em> the sister who had
remained within the pale; I, the rapscallion of a brother whose
vagaries were trying to his relations. That was the note she struck,
and she maintained it. I didn't know what the deuce she was driving
at, and I didn't care. These scenes with a touch of madness appealed
to me. I was going to live, and here, apparently, was a woman
ready to my hand. Besides, she was making a fool of Callan, and
that pleased me. His patronising manners had irritated me.</p>

<p>I assisted rather silently. They began to talk of mutual acquaintances&mdash;as
one talks. They both seemed to know everyone in this world. She
gave herself the airs of being quite in the inner ring; alleged
familiarity with quite impossible persons, with my portentous
aunt, with Cabinet Ministers&mdash;that sort of people. They talked
about them&mdash;she, as if she lived among them; he, as if he tried
very hard to live up to them.</p>

<p>She affected reverence for his person, plied him with compliments
that he swallowed raw&mdash;horribly raw. It made me shudder a little;
it was tragic to see the little great man confronted with that
woman. It shocked me to think that, really, I must appear much
like him&mdash;must have looked like that yesterday. He was a little
uneasy, I thought, made little confidences as if in spite of himself;
little confidences about the <em>Hour</em>, the new paper for
which I was engaged. It seemed to be run by a small gang with
quite a number of assorted axes to grind. There was some foreign
financier&mdash;a person of position whom she knew (a noble man in
the <em>best</em> sense, Callan said); there was some politician
(she knew him too, and he was equally excellent, so Callan said),
Mr. Churchill himself, an artist or so, an actor or so&mdash;and Callan.
They all wanted a little backing, so it seemed. Callan, of course,
put it in another way. The Great&mdash;Moral &mdash;Purpose turned
up, I don't know why. He could not think he was taking me in and
she obviously knew more about the people concerned than he did.
But there it was, looming large, and quite as farcical as all
the rest of it. The foreign financier&mdash;they called him the Duc
de Mersch&mdash;was by way of being a philanthropist on megalomaniac
lines. For some international reason he had been allowed to possess
himself of the pleasant land of Greenland. There was gold in it
and train-oil in it and other things that paid&mdash;but the Duc de
Mersch was not thinking of that. He was first and foremost a State
Founder, or at least he was that after being titular ruler of
some little spot of a Teutonic grand-duchy. No one of the great
powers would let any other of the great powers possess the country,
so it had been handed over to the Duc de Mersch, who had at heart,
said Cal, the glorious vision of founding a model state&mdash;<em>the</em>
model state, in which washed and broadclothed Esquimaux would
live, side by side, regenerated lives, enfranchised equals of
choicely selected younger sons of whatever occidental race. It
was that sort of thing. I was even a little overpowered, in spite
of the fact that Callan was its trumpeter; there was something
fine about the conception and Churchill's acquiescence seemed
to guarantee an honesty in its execution.</p>

<p>The Duc de Mersch wanted money, and he wanted to run a railway
across Greenland. His idea was that the British public should
supply the money and the British Government back the railway,
as they did in the case of a less philanthropic Suez Canal. In
return he offered an eligible harbour and a strip of coast at
one end of the line; the British public was to be repaid in casks
of train-oil and gold and with the consciousness of having aided
in letting the light in upon a dark spot of the earth. So the
Duc de Mersch started the <em>Hour</em>. The <em>Hour</em> was
to extol the Duc de Mersch's moral purpose; to pat the Government's
back; influence public opinion; and generally advance the cause
of the System for the Regeneration of the Arctic Regions.</p>

<p>I tell the story rather flippantly, because I heard it from Callan,
and because it was impossible to take him seriously. Besides,
I was not very much interested in the thing itself. But it did
interest me to see how deftly she pumped him&mdash;squeezed him dry.</p>

<p>I was even a little alarmed for poor old Cal. After all, the
man had done me a service; had got me a job. As for her, she struck
me as a potentially dangerous person. One couldn't tell, she might
be some adventuress, or if not that, a speculator who would damage
Cal's little schemes. I put it to her plainly afterward; and quarrelled
with her as well as I could. I drove her down to the station.
Callan must have been distinctly impressed or he would never have
had out his trap for her.</p>

<p>"You know," I said to her, "I won't have you play tricks with
Callan&mdash;not while you're using my name. It's very much at your
service as far as I'm concerned&mdash;but, confound it, if you're going
to injure him I shall have to show you up&mdash;to tell him."</p>

<p>"You couldn't, you know," she said, perfectly calmly, "you've
let yourself in for it. He wouldn't feel pleased with you for
letting it go as far as it has. You'd lose your job, and you're
going to live, you know&mdash;you're going to live...."</p>

<p>I was taken aback by this veiled threat in the midst of the pleasantry.
It wasn't fair play&mdash;not at all fair play. I recovered some of
my old alarm, remembered that she really was a dangerous person;
that ...</p>

<p>"But I sha'n't hurt Callan," she said, suddenly, "you may make
your mind easy."</p>

<p>"You really won't?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Really not," she answered. It relieved me to believe her. I
did not want to quarrel with her. You see, she fascinated me,
she seemed to act as a stimulant, to set me tingling somehow&mdash;and
to baffle me.... And there was truth in what she said. I had let
myself in for it, and I didn't want to lose Callan's job by telling
him I had made a fool of him.</p>

<p>"I don't care about anything else," I said. She smiled.</p>
