<p>Dain was not long in crossing the river after leaving Almayer. 
He landed at the water-gate of the stockade enclosing the group
of houses which composed the residence of the Rajah of Sambir. 
Evidently somebody was expected there, for the gate was open,
and men with torches were ready to precede the visitor up the
inclined plane of planks leading to the largest house where Lakamba
actually resided, and where all the business of state was invariably
transacted.  The other buildings within the enclosure served only
to accommodate the numerous household and the wives of the ruler.</p>

<p>Lakamba's own house was a strong structure of solid planks, raised
on high piles, with a verandah of split bamboos surrounding it
on all sides; the whole was covered in by an immensely high-pitched
roof of palm-leaves, resting on beams blackened by the smoke of
many torches.</p>

<p>The building stood parallel to the river, one of its long sides
facing the water-gate of the stockade.  There was a door in the
short side looking up the river, and the inclined plank-way led
straight from the gate to that door.  By the uncertain light of
smoky torches, Dain noticed the vague outlines of a group of armed
men in the dark shadows to his right.  From that group Babalatchi
stepped forward to open the door, and Dain entered the audience
chamber of the Rajah's residence.  About onethird of the house
was curtained off, by heavy stuff of European manufacture, for
that purpose; close to the curtain there was a big armchair of
some black wood, much carved, and before it a rough deal table.
Otherwise the room was only furnished with mats in great profusion. 
To the left of the entrance stood a rude arm-rack, with three
rifles with fixed bayonets in it.  By the wall, in the shadow,
the body-guard of Lakamba&mdash;all friends or relations&mdash;slept in
a confused heap of brown arms, legs, and multi-coloured garments,
from whence issued an occasional snore or a subdued groan of some
uneasy sleeper.  An European lamp with a green shade standing
on the table made all this indistinctly visible to Dain.</p>

<p>"You are welcome to your rest here," said Babalatchi, looking
at Dain interrogatively.</p>

<p>"I must speak to the Rajah at once," answered Dain.</p>

<p>Babalatchi made a gesture of assent, and, turning to the brass
gong suspended under the arm-rack, struck two sharp blows.</p>

<p>The ear-splitting din woke up the guard.  The snores ceased;
outstretched legs were drawn in; the whole heap moved, and slowly
resolved itself into individual forms, with much yawning and rubbing
of sleepy eyes; behind the curtains there was a burst of feminine
chatter; then the bass voice of Lakamba was heard.</p>

<p>"Is that the Arab trader?"</p>

<p>"No, Tuan," answered Babalatchi; "Dain has returned at last. 
He is here for an important talk, bitcharra&mdash;if you mercifully
consent."</p>

<p>Evidently Lakamba's mercy went so far&mdash;for in a short while he
came out from behind the curtain&mdash;but it did not go to the length
of inducing him to make an extensive toilet.  A short red sarong
tightened hastily round his hips was his only garment.  The merciful
ruler of Sambir looked sleepy and rather sulky.  He sat in the
arm-chair, his knees well apart, his elbows on the arm-rests,
his chin on his breast, breathing heavily and waiting malevolently
for Dain to open the important talk.</p>

<p>But Dain did not seem anxious to begin.  He directed his gaze
towards Babalatchi, squatting comfortably at the feet of his master,
and remained silent with a slightly bent head as if in attentive
expectation of coming words of wisdom.</p>

<p>Babalatchi coughed discreetly, and, leaning forward, pushed over
a few mats for Dain to sit upon, then lifting up his squeaky voice
he assured him with eager volubility of everybody's delight at
this long-looked-for return.  His heart had hungered for the sight
of Dain's face, and his ears were withering for the want of the
refreshing sound of his voice. Everybody's hearts and ears were
in the same sad predicament, according to Babalatchi, as he indicated
with a sweeping gesture the other bank of the river where the
settlement slumbered peacefully, unconscious of the great joy
awaiting it on the morrow when Dain's presence amongst them would
be disclosed.  "For"&mdash;went on Babalatchi&mdash;"what is the joy of
a poor man if not the open hand of a generous trader or of a great&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he checked himself abruptly with a calculated embarrassment
of manner, and his roving eye sought the floor, while an apologetic
smile dwelt for a moment on his misshapen lips.  Once or twice
during this opening speech an amused expression flitted across
Dain's face, soon to give way, however, to an appearance of grave
concern.  On Lakamba's brow a heavy frown had settled, and his
lips moved angrily as he listened to his Prime Minister's oratory. 
In the silence that fell upon the room when Babalatchi ceased
speaking arose a chorus of varied snores from the corner where
the body-guard had resumed their interrupted slumbers, but the
distant rumble of thunder filling then Nina's heart with apprehension
for the safety of her lover passed unheeded by those three men
intent each on their own purposes, for life or death.</p>

<p>After a short silence, Babalatchi, discarding now the flowers
of polite eloquence, spoke again, but in short and hurried sentences
and in a low voice.  They had been very uneasy.  Why did Dain
remain so long absent? The men dwelling on the lower reaches of
the river heard the reports of big guns and saw a fire-ship of
the Dutch amongst the islands of the estuary.  So they were anxious. 
Rumours of a disaster had reached Abdulla a few days ago, and
since then they had been waiting for Dain's return under the apprehension
of some misfortune.  For days they had closed their eyes in fear,
and woke up alarmed, and walked abroad trembling, like men before
an enemy.  And all on account of Dain.  Would he not allay their
fears for his safety, not for themselves?  They were quiet and
faithful, and devoted to the great Rajah in Batavia&mdash;may his fate
lead him ever to victory for the joy and profit of his servants!
"And here," went on Babalatchi, "Lakamba my master was getting
thin in his anxiety for the trader he had taken under his protection;
and so was Abdulla, for what would wicked men not say if perchance&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be silent, fool!" growled Lakamba, angrily.</p>

<p>Babalatchi subsided into silence with a satisfied smile, while
Dain, who had been watching him as if fascinated, turned with
a sigh of relief towards the ruler of Sambir.  Lakamba did not
move, and, without raising his head, looked at Dain from under
his eyebrows, breathing audibly, with pouted lips, in an air of
general discontent.</p>

<p>"Speak!  O Dain!" he said at last.  "We have heard many rumours. 
Many nights in succession has my friend Reshid come here with
bad tidings. News travels fast along the coast.  But they may
be untrue; there are more lies in men's mouths in these days than
when I was young, but I am not easier to deceive now."</p>

<p>"All my words are true," said Dain, carelessly.  "If you want
to know what befell my brig, then learn that it is in the hands
of the Dutch. Believe me, Rajah," he went on, with sudden energy,
"the Orang Blanda have good friends in Sambir, or else how did
they know I was coming thence?"</p>

<p>Lakamba gave Dain a short and hostile glance.  Babalatchi rose
quietly, and, going to the arm-rack, struck the gong violently.</p>

<p>Outside the door there was a shuffle of bare feet; inside, the
guard woke up and sat staring in sleepy surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, you faithful friend of the white Rajah," went on Dain,
scornfully, turning to Babalatchi, who had returned to his place,
"I have escaped, and I am here to gladden your heart.  When I
saw the Dutch ship I ran the brig inside the reefs and put her
ashore.  They did not dare to follow with the ship, so they sent
the boats.  We took to ours and tried to get away, but the ship
dropped fireballs at us, and killed many of my men. But I am left,
O Babalatchi!  The Dutch are coming here.  They are seeking for
me.  They are coming to ask their faithful friend Lakamba and
his slave Babalatchi.  Rejoice!"</p>

<p>But neither of his hearers appeared to be in a joyful mood. 
Lakamba had put one leg over his knee, and went on gently scratching
it with a meditative air, while Babalatchi, sitting cross-legged,
seemed suddenly to become smaller and very limp, staring straight
before him vacantly. The guard evinced some interest in the proceedings,
stretching themselves full length on the mats to be nearer the
speaker.  One of them got up and now stood leaning against the
arm-rack, playing absently with the fringes of his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>Dain waited till the crash of thunder had died away in distant
mutterings before he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Are you dumb, O ruler of Sambir, or is the son of a great Rajah
unworthy of your notice?  I am come here to seek refuge and to
warn you, and want to know what you intend doing."</p>

<p>"You came here because of the white man's daughter," retorted
Lakamba, quickly.  "Your refuge was with your father, the Rajah
of Bali, the Son of Heaven, the 'Anak Agong' himself.  What am
I to protect great princes? Only yesterday I planted rice in a
burnt clearing; to-day you say I hold your life in my hand."</p>

<p>Babalatchi glanced at his master.  "No man can escape his fate,"
he murmured piously.  "When love enters a man's heart he is like
a child&mdash;without any understanding.  Be merciful, Lakamba," he
added, twitching the corner of the Rajah's sarong warningly.</p>

<p>Lakamba snatched away the skirt of the sarong angrily.  Under
the dawning comprehension of intolerable embarrassments caused
by Dain's return to Sambir he began to lose such composure as
he had been, till then, able to maintain; and now he raised his
voice loudly above the whistling of the wind and the patter of
rain on the roof in the hard squall passing over the house.</p>

<p>"You came here first as a trader with sweet words and great promises,
asking me to look the other way while you worked your will on
the white man there.  And I did.  What do you want now?  When
I was young I fought. Now I am old, and want peace.  It is easier
for me to have you killed than to fight the Dutch.  It is better
for me."</p>

<p>The squall had now passed, and, in the short stillness of the
lull in the storm, Lakamba repeated softly, as if to himself,
"Much easier.  Much better."</p>

<p>Dain did not seem greatly discomposed by the Rajah's threatening
words. While Lakamba was speaking he had glanced once rapidly
over his shoulder, just to make sure that there was nobody behind
him, and, tranquillised in that respect, he had extracted a siri-box
out of the folds of his waistcloth, and was wrapping carefully
the little bit of betel-nut and a small pinch of lime in the green
leaf tendered him politely by the watchful Babalatchi.  He accepted
this as a peace-offering from the silent statesman&mdash;a kind of
mute protest against his master's undiplomatic violence, and as
an omen of a possible understanding to be arrived at yet.  Otherwise
Dain was not uneasy.  Although recognising the justice of Lakamba's
surmise that he had come back to Sambir only for the sake of the
white man's daughter, yet he was not conscious of any childish
lack of understanding, as suggested by Babalatchi.  In fact, Dain
knew very well that Lakamba was too deeply implicated in the gunpowder
smuggling to care for an investigation the Dutch authorities into
that matter.  When sent off by his father, the independent Rajah
of Bali, at the time when the hostilities between Dutch and Malays
threatened to spread from Sumatra over the whole archipelago,
Dain had found all the big traders deaf to his guarded proposals,
and above the temptation of the great prices he was ready to give
for gunpowder.  He went to Sambir as a last and almost hopeless
resort, having heard in Macassar of the white man there, and of
the regular steamer trading from Singapore&mdash;allured also by the
fact that there was no Dutch resident on the river, which would
make things easier, no doubt.  His hopes got nearly wrecked against
the stubborn loyalty of Lakamba arising from well-understood self-interest;
but at last the young man's generosity, his persuasive enthusiasm,
the prestige of his father's great name, overpowered the prudent
hesitation of the ruler of Sambir.  Lakamba would have nothing
to do himself with any illegal traffic.  He also objected to the
Arabs being made use of in that matter; but he suggested Almayer,
saying that he was a weak man easily persuaded, and that his friend,
the English captain of the steamer, could be made very useful&mdash;very
likely even would join in the business, smuggling the powder in
the steamer without Abdulla's knowledge.  There again Dain met
in Almayer with unexpected resistance; Lakamba had to send Babalatchi
over with the solemn promise that his eyes would be shut in friendship
for the white man, Dain paying for the promise and the friendship
in good silver guilders of the hated Orang Blanda.  Almayer, at
last consenting, said the powder would be obtained, but Dain must
trust him with dollars to send to Singapore in payment for it. 
He would induce Ford to buy and smuggle it in the steamer on board
the brig.  He did not want any money for himself out of the transaction,
but Dain must help him in his great enterprise after sending off
the brig.  Almayer had explained to Dain that he could not trust
Lakamba alone in that matter; he would be afraid of losing his
treasure and his life through the cupidity of the Rajah; yet the
Rajah had to be told, and insisted on taking a share in that operation,
or else his eyes would remain shut no longer.  To this Almayer
had to submit.  Had Dain not seen Nina he would have probably
refused to engage himself and his men in the projected expedition
to Gunong Mas&mdash;the mountain of gold.  As it was he intended to
return with half of his men as soon as the brig was clear of the
reefs, but the persistent chase given him by the Dutch frigate
had forced him to run south and ultimately to wreck and destroy
his vessel in order to preserve his liberty or perhaps even his
life.  Yes, he had come back to Sambir for Nina, although aware
that the Dutch would look for him there, but he had also calculated
his chances of safety in Lakamba's hands.  For all his ferocious
talk, the merciful ruler would not kill him, for he had long ago
been impressed with the notion that Dain possessed the secret
of the white man's treasure; neither would he give him up to the
Dutch, for fear of some fatal disclosure of complicity in the
treasonable trade.  So Dain felt tolerably secure as he sat meditating
quietly his answer to the Rajah's bloodthirsty speech.  Yes, he
would point out to him the aspect of his position should he &mdash;Dain&mdash;fall
into the hands of the Dutch and should he speak the truth.  He
would have nothing more to lose then, and he would speak the truth. 
And if he did return to Sambir, disturbing thereby Lakamba's peace
of mind, what then? He came to look after his property.  Did he
not pour a stream of silver into Mrs. Almayer's greedy lap?  He
had paid, for the girl, a price worthy of a great prince, although
unworthy of that delightfully maddening creature for whom his
untamed soul longed in an intensity of desire far more tormenting
than the sharpest pain.  He wanted his happiness.  He had the
right to be in Sambir.</p>

<p>He rose, and, approaching the table, leaned both his elbows on
it; Lakamba responsively edged his seat a little closer, while
Babalatchi scrambled to his feet and thrust his inquisitive head
between his master's and Dain's.  They interchanged their ideas
rapidly, speaking in whispers into each other's faces, very close
now, Dain suggesting, Lakamba contradicting, Babalatchi conciliating
and anxious in his vivid apprehension of coming difficulties. 
He spoke most, whispering earnestly, turning his head slowly from
side to side so as to bring his solitary eye to bear upon each
of his interlocutors in turn.  Why should there be strife? said
he.  Let Tuan Dain, whom he loved only less than his master, go
trustfully into hiding.  There were many places for that. Bulangi's
house away in the clearing was best.</p>

<p>Bulangi was a safe man.  In the network of crooked channels no
white man could find his way.  White men were strong, but very
foolish.  It was undesirable to fight them, but deception was
easy.  They were like silly women&mdash;they did not know the use of
reason, and he was a match for any of them&mdash;went on Babalatchi,
with all the confidence of deficient experience.  Probably the
Dutch would seek Almayer.  Maybe they would take away their countryman
if they were suspicious of him.  That would be good.  After the
Dutch went away Lakamba and Dain would get the treasure without
any trouble, and there would be one person less to share it. 
Did he not speak wisdom?  Will Tuan Dain go to Bulangi's house
till the danger is over, go at once?</p>

<p>Dain accepted this suggestion of going into hiding with a certain
sense of conferring a favour upon Lakamba and the anxious statesman,
but he met the proposal of going at once with a decided no, looking
Babalatchi meaningly in the eye.  The statesman sighed as a man
accepting the inevitable would do, and pointed silently towards
the other bank of the river.  Dain bent his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am going there," he said.</p>

<p>"Before the day comes?" asked Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"I am going there now," answered Dain, decisively.  "The Orang
Blanda will not be here before to-morrow night, perhaps, and I
must tell Almayer of our arrangements."</p>

<p>"No, Tuan.  No; say nothing," protested Babalatchi.  "I will
go over myself at sunrise and let him know."</p>

<p>"I will see," said Dain, preparing to go.</p>

<p>The thunderstorm was recommencing outside, the heavy clouds hanging
low overhead now.</p>

<p>There was a constant rumble of distant thunder punctuated by
the nearer sharp crashes, and in the continuous play of blue lightning
the woods and the river showed fitfully, with all the elusive
distinctness of detail characteristic of such a scene.  Outside
the door of the Rajah's house Dain and Babalatchi stood on the
shaking verandah as if dazed and stunned by the violence of the
storm.  They stood there amongst the cowering forms of the Rajah's
slaves and retainers seeking shelter from the rain, and Dain called
aloud to his boatmen, who responded with an unanimous "Ada!  Tuan!"
while they looked uneasily at the river.</p>

<p>"This is a great flood!" shouted Babalatchi into Dain's ear. 
"The river is very angry.  Look!  Look at the drifting logs! 
Can you go?"</p>

<p>Dain glanced doubtfully on the livid expanse of seething water
bounded far away on the other side by the narrow black line of
the forests. Suddenly, in a vivid white flash, the low point of
land with the bending trees on it and Almayer's house, leaped
into view, flickered and disappeared.  Dain pushed Babalatchi
aside and ran down to the water-gate followed by his shivering
boatmen.</p>

<p>Babalatchi backed slowly in and closed the door, then turned
round and looked silently upon Lakamba.  The Rajah sat still,
glaring stonily upon the table, and Babalatchi gazed curiously
at the perplexed mood of the man he had served so many years through
good and evil fortune.  No doubt the one-eyed statesman felt within
his savage and much sophisticated breast the unwonted feelings
of sympathy with, and perhaps even pity for, the man he called
his master.  From the safe position of a confidential adviser,
he could, in the dim vista of past years, see himself&mdash;a casual
cut-throat&mdash;finding shelter under that man's roof in the modest
rice-clearing of early beginnings.  Then came a long period of
unbroken success, of wise counsels, and deep plottings resolutely
carried out by the fearless Lakamba, till the whole east coast
from Poulo Laut to Tanjong Batu listened to Babalatchi's wisdom
speaking through the mouth of the ruler of Sambir.  In those long
years how many dangers escaped, how many enemies bravely faced,
how many white men successfully circumvented!  And now he looked
upon the result of so many years of patient toil: the fearless
Lakamba cowed by the shadow of an impending trouble.  The ruler
was growing old, and Babalatchi, aware of an uneasy feeling at
the pit of his stomach, put both his hands there with a suddenly
vivid and sad perception of the fact that he himself was growing
old too; that the time of reckless daring was past for both of
them, and that they had to seek refuge in prudent cunning.  They
wanted peace; they were disposed to reform; they were ready even
to retrench, so as to have the wherewithal to bribe the evil days
away, if bribed away they could be.  Babalatchi sighed for the
second time that night as he squatted again at his master's feet
and tendered him his betel-nut box in mute sympathy.  And they
sat there in close yet silent communion of betel-nut chewers,
moving their jaws slowly, expectorating decorously into the widemouthed
brass vessel they passed to one another, and listening to the
awful din of the battling elements outside.</p>

<p>"There is a very great flood," remarked Babalatchi, sadly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lakamba.  "Did Dain go?"</p>

<p>"He went, Tuan.  He ran down to the river like a man possessed
of the Sheitan himself."</p>

<p>There was another long pause.</p>

<p>"He may get drowned," suggested Lakamba at last, with some show
of interest.</p>

<p>"The floating logs are many," answered Babalatchi, "but he is
a good swimmer," he added languidly.</p>

<p>"He ought to live," said Lakamba; "he knows where the treasure
is."</p>

<p>Babalatchi assented with an ill-humoured grunt.  His want of
success in penetrating the white man's secret as to the locality
where the gold was to be found was a sore point with the statesman
of Sambir, as the only conspicuous failure in an otherwise brilliant
career.</p>

<p>A great peace had now succeeded the turmoil of the storm.  Only
the little belated clouds, which hurried past overhead to catch
up the main body flashing silently in the distance, sent down
short showers that pattered softly with a soothing hiss over the
palm-leaf roof.</p>

<p>Lakamba roused himself from his apathy with an appearance of
having grasped the situation at last.</p>

<p>"Babalatchi," he called briskly, giving him a slight kick.</p>

<p>"Ada Tuan!  I am listening."</p>

<p>"If the Orang Blanda come here, Babalatchi, and take Almayer
to Batavia to punish him for smuggling gunpowder, what will he
do, you think?"</p>

<p>"I do not know, Tuan."</p>

<p>"You are a fool," commented Lakamba, exultingly.  "He will tell
them where the treasure is, so as to find mercy.  He will."</p>

<p>Babalatchi looked up at his master and nodded his head with by
no means a joyful surprise.  He had not thought of this; there
was a new complication.</p>

<p>"Almayer must die," said Lakamba, decisively, "to make our secret
safe. He must die quietly, Babalatchi.  You must do it."</p>

<p>Babalatchi assented, and rose wearily to his feet.  "To-morrow?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; before the Dutch come.  He drinks much coffee," answered
Lakamba, with seeming irrelevancy.</p>

<p>Babalatchi stretched himself yawning, but Lakamba, in the flattering
consciousness of a knotty problem solved by his own unaided intellectual
efforts, grew suddenly very wakeful.</p>

<p>"Babalatchi," he said to the exhausted statesman, "fetch the
box of music the white captain gave me.  I cannot sleep."</p>

<p>At this order a deep shade of melancholy settled upon Babalatchi's
features.  He went reluctantly behind the curtain and soon reappeared
carrying in his arms a small hand-organ, which he put down on
the table with an air of deep dejection.  Lakamba settled himself
comfortably in his arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Turn, Babalatchi, turn," he murmured, with closed eyes.</p>

<p>Babalatchi's hand grasped the handle with the energy of despair,
and as he turned, the deep gloom on his countenance changed into
an expression of hopeless resignation.  Through the open shutter
the notes of Verdi's music floated out on the great silence over
the river and forest.  Lakamba listened with closed eyes and a
delighted smile; Babalatchi turned, at times dozing off and swaying
over, then catching himself up in a great fright with a few quick
turns of the handle.  Nature slept in an exhausted repose after
the fierce turmoil, while under the unsteady hand of the statesman
of Sambir the Trovatore fitfully wept, wailed, and bade good-bye
to his Leonore again and again in a mournful round of tearful
and endless iteration.</p>
