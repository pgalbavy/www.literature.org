<p>"Good day, my friends!" was the greeting of the detective as
he closed the door behind him, strode forward and saluted Mike,
who, after his exclamation, rose from his chair and, open mouth
and staring eyes, limply clasped the hand that was offered him.</p>

<p>"I wasn't looking for you, Mike, but I was searching for Hor
&mdash;I beg pardon, Orestes Noxon. I hope I see you well, barring
the slight injury to the leg inflicted by Mr. Gerald Buxton last
night."</p>

<p>And what did the officer do but shake hands with Noxon, who kept
his seat as if in a daze? Mike, who was watching the couple, instantly
noted a significant fact. Beyond question the two were acquaintances.
The face of the young man flushed scarlet and he said faintly:</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Calvert, you have got me at last."</p>

<p>"Yes; and a right merry chase you have led me. You won't get
away this time."</p>

<p>"I suppose not."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mike," said the caller, drawing up a chair for himself.
"I have something I would like very much to say to thee, Orestes."</p>

<p>At this moment Aunt Maggie swung through the door again. She
had seen the man enter and wished to know what it meant. Calvert
sprang to his feet and bowed.</p>

<p>"I have found a couple of good friends of mine, who I am sure
are greatly indebted to you for your hospitality. One cannot fail
to tell by your looks that you have a wonderfully kind heart&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Arrah, now," replied Mrs. McCaffry, pushing away the hair in
front of her face with her fat hand, "but ye are the worst blarney
of thim all. I'll have nothing to do wid ye till dinner time,
whin I'll stuff ye all so full of roast pig and praties that ye'll
be obleeged to kaap quiet regarding dacent folks."</p>

<p>She knew the three wished to talk over private matters, and made
sure they were left alone for the next hour or two.</p>

<p>"Mr. Calvert," said Noxon, "Mike here has proved himself a true
friend to me&mdash;so you may talk freely before him. He doesn't know
my right name and says he doesn't care to know. So we will let
that pass. What caused you to look here for me?"</p>

<p>"Warner Hagan met me in Wiscasset yesterday to give what help
he could in running Kit Woodford and his gang to earth. Early
this morning we heard of the attempted robbery of the Beartown
post office. We hired a launch and got there as soon as we could.
Nobody in Beartown suspects our business. It did not take us long
to pick up all that was known. We learned that one of the three
got peppered with bird shot, and managed to limp off in the woods.
Of course I recognized the three young gentlemen who were accepting
the hospitality of Mrs. Friestone, the postmistress. They required
no immediate attention and were sure to turn up all right in the
end.</p>

<p>"I left Hagan in Beartown to look into matters further while
I set out to hunt for the fellow who had limped off in the woods,
after turning the tables so cleverly on Mr. Buxton. Without any
reason that I could explain I formed the suspicion that this member
of the gang was you, Noxon (I believe that is your travelling
name). It was represented that he was hurt much worse than I am
glad to say was the fact. I inquired at each house along the road
between here and Beartown and hit it at last.</p>

<p>"Now," added the visitor as if seated with his intimate friends,
"since you tell me to talk freely in Mike's presence, I shall
do so. Are you ready, Noxon, to go to your home with me?"</p>

<p>"Begging yer pardin, Mr. Calvert, I beg to say that has been
sittled. The dearest hope of Noxy's heart is to return to his
parents."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" asked the detective of the young man.</p>

<p>"I would give my right hand," he solemnly replied, holding it
up, "if I could go back three months in my life and have things
as they were."</p>

<p>"You can't do that as regards time, but it will bring sunshine
and happiness to your loved ones when the wandering boy comes
to their waiting arms. All being true, we have got to travel the
'rocky road to Dublin.' You have committed a serious crime against
the United States laws, and if convicted nothing can save you
from a long term in prison."</p>

<p>"Then what hope is there for me?"</p>

<p>"You haven't been convicted yet, but I won't deny that you are
in serious danger of it."</p>

<p>"How shall I escape?"</p>

<p>"I thought that over while on the road from Beartown. This, I
believe, is your third essay as a burglar. Am I right?"</p>

<p>Noxon nodded.</p>

<p>"Once would be enough to send you to Atlanta, but let that go
for the present. Are you willing to turn state's evidence?"</p>

<p>Noxon moved uneasily in his seat. The proposition was distasteful.</p>

<p>"You needn't feel any compunctions. Kit Woodford and that cub
who calls himself Graff Miller have handed out the double cross
many a time, and stand ready to do it again if it promises the
slightest advantage to them. They have run off in the hope of
taking care of their own hides, without caring the snap of a finger
what became of you."</p>

<p>"There is no mistake about <em>that</em>, Mr. Calvert?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't deceive you for an instant. Their own actions prove
it. They have done the same thing before, and to-day they did
not give you a thought, when danger threatened them."</p>

<p>"I shall do whatever you wish."</p>

<p>"Good! You may not know that, although I am a Pinkerton detective,
I am under promise to my lifelong friend to do all I can to save
you from yourself."</p>

<p>"Does father know I am in this business, Mr. Calvert?"</p>

<p>"He doesn't dream of such a thing. The shock would kill him.
Therefore, I shall strain every nerve to keep him from ever learning
the truth. I have a plan in mind, but before trying it you must
answer a few questions."</p>

<p>"I am ready."</p>

<p>"In the first place, where do this gang with whom you have been
associated have their headquarters?"</p>

<p>"I can guide you to the exact spot."</p>

<p>"It is not that little patch of ground in the cove at the southern
end of Barter Island?"</p>

<p>"No; the character of the islet forbids. Miller ran the launch
in there one night when he thought some one was watching, to throw
him off the scent. Have you a pencil and bit of paper anywhere
about you?"</p>

<p>Calvert produced the articles from an inner coat pocket and handed
them to Noxon. Placing the paper on the table in the middle of
the room, he spent several minutes in drawing a diagram. He was
apt at the work and did it with no little skill. By and by he
handed paper and pencil to the owner with the remark:</p>

<p>"That will answer your question."</p>

<p>"It is a production of art," said the detective admiringly. "No
professional artist could beat it."</p>

<p>Noxon had not only drawn a perfect representation of the neighborhood
which he had in mind, but lettered it so that no mistake was possible.
It pictured a part of the eastern shore of Westport Island, opposite
Barter, and only a short distance north of the inlet where the
<em>Water Witch</em> had been visited some nights before. Noxon
leaned forward and placed the tip of his finger on the different
points.</p>

<p>"Right there is one of a hundred similar coves among the waters
of southern Maine. It is smaller than the others, and a little
way back is an island, which resembles except in size those that
you see in every part of these waters. You know they rise above
the surface like vast bouquets, with trees growing down to the
edge of the river or sea. It is not so with that bit of earth
you first asked about, but it is so with the islet in that cove
which I show on that piece of paper."</p>

<p>"What about this one?"</p>

<p>"It is what you may call the headquarters of the Woodford gang
of post office robbers. And, yet, it seems hardly right to call
it that, for it is sort of hiding place to which they flee when
things begin to grow warm."</p>

<p>"You have been there?"</p>

<p>"Several times. I will go again with you."</p>

<p>"No need; I can't go wrong with such directions. Why, Mike himself
can understand it."</p>

<p>He gravely held up the drawing before the Irish youth, who squinted
one eye and carefully scrutinized it.</p>

<p>"I must say I don't make sure whither it's a picter of yersilf,
Mr. Calvert, or a view of an automobile trying to climb a tree."</p>

<p>"What did I tell you, Orestes? Isn't he bright?"</p>

<p>"An unnicessary question," said Mike loftily; "as Auntie McCaffry
would answer if ye asked her which was the handsomest and cutest
and smartest one among her three guests."</p>

<p>"Noxon," said Calvert, with a smile over the repartee of the
Irish lad, "do either Kit Woodford or Graff Miller know your right
name?"</p>

<p>"They never asked me and it was never given in their presence."</p>

<p>"You said as much before. Do they know where you came from?"</p>

<p>"They haven't the slightest knowledge. I am as unknown to them
as regards my real identity as if I never existed."</p>

<p>"That will help my plan, which, I may say to you and Mike, is
simply this: get you out of this neighborhood to your home. There,
of course, you will assume your true identity and no one need
ever be the wiser."</p>

<p>"What of the testimony of Woodford and Miller when they are released
from jail?"</p>

<p>"You and they will be so much older that neither will recognize
the other. Have no fear on that score. The thing is to run you
out of the State of Maine. The hunt for these post office robbers
has become so hot that it isn't going to be an easy job, but I
believe I can work it. There's some sort of a mix-up of motor
boats, which as yet I can't get the hang of, but when I do I shall
try my plan. Mike, how was it you were here with Noxon when I
called? Can you tell me anything about your launch or the <em>Water
Witch</em>?"</p>

<p>Thereupon the Irish youth related his story, and when it was
finished the detective smiled.</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken that is going to help us a big lot."</p>
