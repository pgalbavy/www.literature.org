<p>Mr. Barbecue-Smith was gone. The motor had whirled him away to
the station; a faint smell of burning oil commemorated his recent
departure. A considerable detachment had come into the courtyard
to speed him on his way; and now they were walking back, round
the side of the house, towards the terrace and the garden. They
walked in silence; nobody had yet ventured to comment on the departed
guest.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Anne at last, turning with raised inquiring eyebrows
to Denis.</p>

<p>"Well?" It was time for someone to begin.</p>

<p>Denis declined the invitation; he passed it on to Mr Scogan.
"Well?" he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan did not respond; he only repeated the question, "Well?"</p>

<p>It was left for Henry Wimbush to make a pronouncement. "A very
agreeable adjunct to the week-end," he said. His tone was obituary.</p>

<p>They had descended, without paying much attention where they
were going, the steep yew-walk that went down, under the flank
of the terrace, to the pool. The house towered above them, immensely
tall, with the whole height of the built-up terrace added to its
own seventy feet of brick façade. The perpendicular lines of the
three towers soared up, uninterrupted, enhancing the impression
of height until it became overwhelming. They paused at the edge
of the pool to look back.</p>

<p>"The man who built this house knew his business," said Denis.
"He was an architect."</p>

<p>"Was he?" said Henry Wimbush reflectively. "I doubt it. The builder
of this house was Sir Ferdinando Lapith, who flourished during
the reign of Elizabeth. He inherited the estate from his father,
to whom it had been granted at the time of the dissolution of
the monasteries; for Crome was originally a cloister of monks
and this swimming-pool their fish-pond. Sir Ferdinando was not
content merely to adapt the old monastic buildings to his own
purposes; but using them as a stone quarry for his barns and byres
and outhouses, he built for himself a grand new house of brick&mdash;the
house you see now."</p>

<p>He waved his hand in the direction of the house and was silent,
severe, imposing, almost menacing, Crome loomed down on them.</p>

<p>"The great thing about Crome," said Mr. Scogan, seizing the opportunity
to speak, "is the fact that it’s so unmistakably and aggressively
a work of art. It makes no compromise with nature, but affronts
it and rebels against it. It has no likeness to Shelley’s tower,
in the ‘Epipsychidion,’ which, if I remember rightly&mdash;"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"‘Seems not now a work of human art,

</p>
<p>
But as it were titanic, in the heart

</p>
<p>
Of earth having assumed its form and grown

</p>
<p>
Out of the mountain, from the living stone,

</p>
<p>
Lifting itself in caverns light and high.’

</p>

<p>"No, no, there isn’t any nonsense of that sort about Crome. That
the hovels of the peasantry should look as though they had grown
out of the earth, to which their inmates are attached, is right,
no doubt, and suitable. But the house of an intelligent, civilised,
and sophisticated man should never seem to have sprouted from
the clods. It should rather be an expression of his grand unnatural
remoteness from the cloddish life. Since the days of William Morris
that’s a fact which we in England have been unable to comprehend.
Civilised and sophisticated men have solemnly played at being
peasants. Hence quaintness, arts and crafts, cottage architecture,
and all the rest of it. In the suburbs of our cities you may see,
reduplicated in endless rows, studiedly quaint imitations and
adaptations of the village hovel. Poverty, ignorance, and a limited
range of materials produced the hovel, which possesses undoubtedly,
in suitable surroundings, its own ‘as it were titanic’ charm.
We now employ our wealth, our technical knowledge, our rich variety
of materials for the purpose of building millions of imitation
hovels in totally unsuitable surroundings. Could imbecility go
further?"</p>

<p>Henry Wimbush took up the thread of his interrupted discourse.
"All that you say, my dear Scogan," he began, "is certainly very
just, very true. But whether Sir Ferdinando shared your views
about architecture or if, indeed, he had any views about architecture
at all, I very much doubt. In building this house, Sir Ferdinando
was, as a matter of fact, preoccupied by only one thought&mdash;the
proper placing of his privies. Sanitation was the one great interest
of his life. In 1573 he even published, on this subject, a little
book&mdash;now extremely scarce&mdash;called, ‘Certaine Priuy Counsels’
by ‘One of Her Maiestie’s Most Honourable Priuy Counsels, <em>F.L.
</em>Knight’, in which the whole matter is treated with great
learning and elegance. His guiding principle in arranging the
sanitation of a house was to secure that the greatest possible
distance should separate the privy from the sewage arrangements.
Hence it followed inevitably that the privies were to be placed
at the top of the house, being connected by vertical shafts with
pits or channels in the ground. It must not be thought that Sir
Ferdinando was moved only by material and merely sanitary considerations;
for the placing of his privies in an exalted position he had also
certain excellent spiritual reasons. For, he argues in the third
chapter of his ‘Priuy Counsels’, the necessities of nature are
so base and brutish that in obeying them we are apt to forget
that we are the noblest creatures of the universe. To counteract
these degrading effects he advised that the privy should be in
every house the room nearest to heaven, that it should be well
provided with windows commanding an extensive and noble prospect,
and that the walls of the chamber should be lined with bookshelves
containing all the ripest products of human wisdom, such as the
Proverbs of Solomon, Boethius’s ‘Consolations of Philosophy’,
the apophthegms of Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius, the ‘Enchiridion’
of Erasmus, and all other works, ancient or modern, which testify
to the nobility of the human soul. In Crome he was able to put
his theories into practice. At the top of each of the three projecting
towers he placed a privy. From these a shaft went down the whole
height of the house, that is to say, more than seventy feet, through
the cellars, and into a series of conduits provided with flowing
water tunnelled in the ground on a level with the base of the
raised terrace. These conduits emptied themselves into the stream
several hundred yards below the fish-pond. The total depth of
the shafts from the top of the towers to their subterranean conduits
was a hundred and two feet. The eighteenth century, with its passion
for modernisation, swept away these monuments of sanitary ingenuity.
Were it not for tradition and the explicit account of them left
by Sir Ferdinando, we should be unaware that these noble privies
had ever existed. We should even suppose that Sir Ferdinando built
his house after this strange and splendid model for merely aesthetic
reasons."</p>

<p>The contemplation of the glories of the past always evoked in
Henry Wimbush a certain enthusiasm. Under the grey bowler his
face worked and glowed as he spoke. The thought of these vanished
privies moved him profoundly. He ceased to speak; the light gradually
died out of his face, and it became once more the replica of the
grave, polite hat which shaded it. There was a long silence; the
same gently melancholy thoughts seemed to possess the mind of
each of them. Permanence, transience &mdash;Sir Ferdinando and
his privies were gone, Crome still stood. How brightly the sun
shone and how inevitable was death! The ways of God were strange;
the ways of man were stranger still...</p>

<p>"It does one’s heart good," exclaimed Mr. Scogan at last, "to
hear of these fantastic English aristocrats. To have a theory
about privies and to build an immense and splendid house in order
to put it into practise&mdash;it’s magnificent, beautiful! I like to
think of them all: the eccentric milords rolling across Europe
in ponderous carriages, bound on extraordinary errands. One is
going to Venice to buy La Bianchi’s larynx; he won’t get it till
she’s dead, of course, but no matter; he’s prepared to wait; he
has a collection, pickled in glass bottles, of the throats of
famous opera singers. And the instruments of renowned virtuosi&mdash;he
goes in for them too; he will try to bribe Paganini to part with
his little Guarnerio, but he has small hope of success. Paganini
won’t sell his fiddle; but perhaps he might sacrifice one of his
guitars. Others are bound on crusades&mdash;one to die miserably among
the savage Greeks, another, in his white top hat, to lead Italians
against their oppressors. Others have no business at all; they
are just giving their oddity a continental airing. At home they
cultivate themselves at leisure and with greater elaboration.
Beckford builds towers, Portland digs holes in the ground, Cavendish,
the millionaire, lives in a stable, eats nothing but mutton, and
amuses himself&mdash;oh, solely for his private delectation&mdash;by anticipating
the electrical discoveries of half a century. Glorious eccentrics!
Every age is enlivened by their presence. Some day, my dear Denis,"
said Mr Scogan, turning a beady bright regard in his direction&mdash;"some
day you must become their biographer&mdash;‘The Lives of Queer Men.’
What a subject! I should like to undertake it myself."</p>

<p>Mr. Scogan paused, looked up once more at the towering house,
then murmured the word "Eccentricity," two or three times.</p>

<p>"Eccentricity...It’s the justification of all aristocracies.
It justifies leisured classes and inherited wealth and privilege
and endowments and all the other injustices of that sort. If you’re
to do anything reasonable in this world, you must have a class
of people who are secure, safe from public opinion, safe from
poverty, leisured, not compelled to waste their time in the imbecile
routines that go by the name of Honest Work. You must have a class
of which the members can think and, within the obvious limits,
do what they please. You must have a class in which people who
have eccentricities can indulge them and in which eccentricity
in general will be tolerated and understood. That’s the important
thing about an aristocracy. Not only is it eccentric itself&mdash;often
grandiosely so; it also tolerates and even encourages eccentricity
in others. The eccentricities of the artist and the new-fangled
thinker don’t inspire it with that fear, loathing, and disgust
which the burgesses instinctively feel towards them. It is a sort
of Red Indian Reservation planted in the midst of a vast horde
of Poor Whites&mdash;colonials at that. Within its boundaries wild
men disport themselves&mdash;often, it must be admitted, a little grossly,
a little too flamboyantly; and when kindred spirits are born outside
the pale it offers them some sort of refuge from the hatred which
the Poor Whites, en bons bourgeois, lavish on anything that is
wild or out of the ordinary. After the social revolution there
will be no Reservations; the Redskins will be drowned in the great
sea of Poor Whites. What then? Will they suffer you to go on writing
villanelles, my good Denis? Will you, unhappy Henry, be allowed
to live in this house of the splendid privies, to continue your
quiet delving in the mines of futile knowledge? Will Anne..."</p>

<p>"And you," said Anne, interrupting him, "will you be allowed
to go on talking?"</p>

<p>"You may rest assured," Mr. Scogan replied, "that I shall not.
I shall have some Honest Work to do."</p>
