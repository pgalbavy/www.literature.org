<p>One night Fatty Coon was strolling along the road that wound through the
valley. He was in no hurry, for he had just left Farmer Green's apple
orchard, where he had bolted all the apples he could possibly eat. The
night was dark and though it was not very late, all the country people
seemed to be in bed. There were no farmers driving along the road. Fatty
had it all to himself. And so he walked slowly homewards. It was then
that the terrible monster almost caught him.
</p>
<p>This is how it all happened. There was a br-br-br-r-r-r in the air.
Fatty really should have heard it long before he did. But he had eaten
so many apples that he had begun to feel sleepy; and his ears were not
so sharp as they should have been. And when at last Fatty heard that
br-r-r-r it was quite loud. He was startled. And he stopped right in the
middle of the road to listen. Fatty had never heard such a sound before.
</p><p>The strange animal was on him before he knew it. Its glaring eyes
blinded him. And if it had not screamed at him Fatty would never have
escaped. It was the terrible screech of the monster which finally made
Fatty jump. It was a frightful cry--like six wildcats all wailing
together. And Fatty leaped to one side of the road just before the
monster reached him.
</p><p>The great creature went past Fatty like the wind and tore on up the
hill. He seemed to be running so fast that he could not stop. Fatty
could hear him panting as he climbed the sharp rise of the road.
</p><p>Fatty Coon hurried away. He wanted to get home before the monster could
stop and come back to look for him.
</p><p>When Fatty told his mother about his narrow escape Mrs. Coon became much
excited. She felt sure that Fatty was not mistaken, for had she not
heard that strange cry herself?
</p><p>There it was again! Woo-ooo-ooo-oo-o! It began low, rose to a shriek,
and then died away again.
</p><p>Mrs. Coon and Fatty climbed to the very top of their old poplar and
gazed down the valley.
</p><p>"Look, Mother!" Fatty cried. "He's stopped at Farmer Green's! You can
see his eyes from here!"
</p><p>Mrs. Coon looked. Sure enough! It was just as Fatty said. And that
horrid call echoed across the valley once more.
</p><p>Farmer Green stuck his head out of his chamber-window, to see what the
man in the automobile wanted.
</p><p>"Where's the nearest village, please?" the stranger asked. And after
Farmer Green had told him the man drove his car on again.
</p><p>From their tree-top Fatty and his mother watched the monster dash down
the valley. They knew he had gone, because they could see the gleam of
those awful eyes.
</p><p>"Do you suppose he ate up Farmer Green and his family?" Fatty asked in a
frightened voice.
</p><p>"I hope so," she said. "Then perhaps there'll be no more traps in the
woods."
</p><p>"But who would plant the corn?" Fatty asked.
</p><p>Mrs. Coon did not appear to hear his question.
