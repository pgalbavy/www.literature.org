<p>Ramsey was not quite athlete enough for any of the 'varsity teams;
neither was he an antagonist safely encountered, whether in play
or in earnest, and during the next few days he taught Fred Mitchell
to be cautious. The chaffer learned that his own agility could
not save him from Ramsey, and so found it wiser to contain an
effervescence which sometimes threatened to burst him. Ramsey
as a victim was a continuous temptation, he was so good-natured
and yet so furious.</p>

<p>After Commencement, when the roommates had gone home, Mr. Mitchell's
caution extended over the long sunshiny months of summer vacation;
he broke it but once and then in well-advised safety, for the
occasion was semi-public. The two were out for a stroll on a July
Sunday afternoon; and up and down the street young couples lolled
along, young families and baby carriages straggled to and from
the houses of older relatives, and the rest of the world of that
growing city was rocking and fanning itself on its front veranda.</p>

<p>"Here's a right pretty place, isn't it, Ramsey? don't you think?"
Fred remarked innocently, as they were passing a lawn of short-clipped,
bright green grass before a genial-looking house, fresh in white
paint and cool in green-and-white awnings. A broad veranda, well
populated just now, crossed the front of the house; fine trees
helped the awnings to give comfort against the sun; and Fred's
remark was warranted. Nevertheless, he fell under the suspicion
of his companion, who had begun to evince some nervousness before
Fred spoke.</p>

<p>"What place do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The Yocum place," said Mr. Mitchell. "I hear the old gentleman's
mighty prosperous these days. They keep things up to the mark,
don't they, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>"I don't know whether they do or whether they don't," Ramsey
returned shortly.</p>

<p>Fred appeared to muse regretfully. "It looks kind of <em>empty</em>
now, though," he said, "with only Mr. and Mrs. Yocum and their
three married daughters, and eight or nine children on the front
porch!"</p>

<p>"You wait till I get you where they can't see us!" Ramsey warned
him, fiercely.</p>

<p>"You can't do it!" said Fred, manifesting triumph. "We'll both
stop right here in plain sight of the whole Yocum family connection
till you promise not to touch me."</p>

<p>And he halted, leaning back implacably against the Yocum's iron
fence. Ramsey was scandalized.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he said, hoarsely. "Don't stop <em>here</em>!"</p>

<p>"I will, and if you go on alone I'll yell at you. You got to
stand right here with all of 'em lookin' at you until&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I promise! My heavens, come <em>on</em>!"</p>

<p>Fred consented to end the moment of agony; and for the rest of
the summer found it impossible to persuade Ramsey to pass that
house in his company. "I won't do it!" Ramsey told him. "Your
word of honour means nothin' to me; you're liable to do anything
that comes into your head, and I'm gettin' old enough to not get
a reputation for bein' seen with people that act the idiot on
the public streets. No, sir; we'll walk around the block&mdash;at least,
we will if you're goin' with <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>And to Fred's delight, though he concealed it, they would make
this detour.</p>

<p>The evening after their return to the university both were busy
with their trunks and various orderings and disorderings of their
apartment, but Fred several times expressed surprise that his
roommate should be content to remain at home; and finally Ramsey
comprehended the implications. Mrs. Meigs's chandelier immediately
jingled with the shock of another crash upon the floor above.</p>

<p>"You let me up!" Fred commanded thickly, his voice muffled by
the pile of flannels, sweaters, underwear, and raincoats wherein
his head was being forced to burrow. "You let me up, darn you!
<em>I</em> didn't say anything." And upon his release he complained
that the attack was unprovoked. "I didn't say anything on earth
to even hint you might want to go out and look around to see if
anybody in particular had got back to college yet. I didn't even
mention the <em>name</em> of Dora Yo&mdash; Keep off o' me! My goodness,
but you are sensitive!"</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, neither of them saw Dora until the first
meeting of the Lumen, whither they went as sophomores to take
their pleasure in the agony of freshmen debaters. Ramsey was now
able to attend the Lumen, not with complacence but at least without
shuddering over the recollection of his own spectacular first
appearance there. He had made subsequent appearances, far from
brilliant yet not disgraceful, and as a spectator, at least, he
usually felt rather at his ease in the place. It cannot be asserted,
however, that he appeared entirely at his ease this evening after
he had read the "Programme" chalked upon the large easel blackboard
beside the chairman's desk. Three "Freshmen Debates" were announced,
and a "Sophomore Oration," this last being followed by the name,
"D. Yocum, '18." Ramsey made immediate and conspicuous efforts
to avoid sitting next to his roommate, but was not so adroit as
to be successful. However, Fred was merciful: the fluctuations
of his friend's complexion were an inspiration more to pity than
to badinage.</p>

<p>The three debates all concerned the "Causes of the War in Europe,"
and honours appeared to rest with a small and stout, stolidly
"pro-German"  girl debater, who had brought with her and translated
at sight absa-loot proofs (so she called them), printed in German,
that Germany had been attacked by Belgium at the low instigation
of the envious English. Everybody knew it wasn't true; but she
made an impression and established herself as a debater, especially
as her opponent was quite confounded by her introduction of printed
matter.</p>

<p>When the debates and the verdicts were concluded, the orator
appeared, and Fred's compassion extended itself so far that he
even refrained from looking inquisitively at the boy in the seat
next to his; but he made one side wager, mentally&mdash;that if Ramsey
had consented to be thoroughly confidential just then, he would
have confessed to feeling kind o' funny.</p>

<p>Dora was charmingly dressed, and she was pale; but those notable
eyelashes of hers were all the more notable against her pallor.
And as she spoke with fire, it was natural that her colour should
come back quite flamingly and that her eyes should flash in shelter
of the lashes. "The Christian Spirit and Internationalism" was
her subject, yet she showed no meek sample of a Christian Spirit
herself when she came to attacking war-makers generally, as well
as all those "half-developed tribesmen," and "victims of herd
instinct" who believed that war might ever be justified under
any circumstances of atrocity. She was eloquent truly, and a picture
of grace and girlish dignity, even when she was most vigorous.
Nothing could have been more militant than her denunciation of
militancy.</p>

<p>"She's an actual wonder," Fred said, when the two had got back
to Mrs. Meigs's, afterward. "Don't you look at me like that: I'm
talkin' about her as a public character, and there's nothin' personal
about it. You let me alone."</p>

<p>Ramsey was not clear as to his duty. "Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If any person makes a public speech," Fred protested, "I got
a perfect right to discuss 'em, no matter what you think of 'em"&mdash;and
he added hastily&mdash;"or <em>don't</em> think of 'em!"</p>

<p>"Look here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Fred exclaimed. "You aren't expecting to interfere
with me if I say anything about that little fat Werder girl that
argued for Germany, are you? Or any of the other speakers? I got
a right to talk about 'em just as public speakers, haven't I?
Well, what I say is: Dora Yocum as an orator is just an actual
perfect wonder. Got any objections?"</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"All right then." Fred settled himself upon the window seat with
a pipe, and proceeded, "There's something about her, when she
stands there, she stands so straight and knows just what she's
up to, and everything, why, there's something about her makes
the cold chills go down your spine&mdash;I mean <em>my</em> spine,
not yours particularly! You sit down &mdash;I mean <em>anybody's</em>
spine, doggone it!" And as Ramsey increased the manifestations
of his suspicions, lifting a tennis racket over the prostrate
figure, "Oh, murder," Fred said, resignedly. "All right, we'll
change the subject. That fat little Werder cutie made out a pretty
good case for Germany, didn't she?"</p>

<p>Ramsey tossed the racket away, disposed himself in an easy chair
with his feet upon the table, and presently chuckled. "You remember
the time I had the fuss with Wesley Bender, back in the ole school
days?"</p>

<p>"Yep."</p>

<p>"All the flubdub this Werder girl got off to-night puts me in
mind of the way I talked that day. I can remember it as well as
anything! Wesley kept yelpin' that whoever mentioned a lady's
name in a public place was a pup, and of course I didn't want
to hit him for that; a boy's got a reg'lar instinct for tryin'
to make out he's on the right side in a scrap, and he'll always
try to do something, or say something, or he'll get the other
boy to say someting to make it look as if the other boy was in
the wrong and began the trouble. So I told poor ole Wes that my
father spoke my mother's name in a public place whenever he wanted
to, and I dared him to say my father was a pup. And all so on.
A boy startin' up a scrap, why, half the time he'll drag his father
and mother if there's any chance to do it. He'll fix up some way
so he can say, 'Well, that's just the same as if you called my
father and mother a fool,' or something like that. Then, afterward,
he can claim he was scrappin' because he had to defend his father
and mother, and of course he'll more than half believe it himself.</p>

<p>"Well, you take a Government&mdash;it's only just some <em>men</em>,
the way I see it, and if they're goin' to start some big trouble
like this war, why, of course they'll play just about the same
ole boy trick, because it's instinct to do it, just the same for
a man as it is for a boy&mdash;or else the principle's just the same,
or something. Well, anyhow, if you want to know who started a
scrap and worked it up, you got to forget all the <em>talk</em>
there is about it, and all what each side <em>says</em>, and just
look at two things: Who was fixed for it first, or thought they
were, and who hit first? When you get the answer to those two
questions everything's settled about all this being 'attacked'
business. Both sides, just the same as boys, they'll both claim
they <em>had</em> to fight; but if you want to know which one
<em>did</em> have to, why forget all the arguing and don't take
your eye off just what <em>happened</em>. As near as I can make
out, this war began with Germany and Austria startin' in to wipe
out two little countries; Austria began shootin' up Serbia, and
Germany began shootin' up Belgium. I don't need to notice any
more than that, myself&mdash;all the Werder girls in the country can
debate their heads off, they can't change what happened and they
can't excuse it, either."</p>

<p>He was silent, appearing to feel that he had concluded conclusively,
and the young gentleman on the window seat, after staring at him
for several moments of genuine thoughtfulness, was gracious enough
to observe, "Well, ole Ram, you may be a little slow in class,
but when you think things out with yourself you do show signs
of something pretty near like real horse-sense sometimes. Why
don't you ever say anything like that to&mdash;to some of your pacifist
friends?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Who you talkin' about? Whose 'pacifist friends'?"</p>

<p>"See here!" Fred exclaimed, as Ramsey seemed about to rise. "You
keep sitting just where you are, and don't look at me out of the
side of your eye like that&mdash;pretendin' you're a bad horse. I'm
<em>really</em> serious now, and you listen to me. I don't think
argufying and debating like that little Fraulein Werder's does
much harm. She's a right nifty young rolypoly, by the way, though
you didn't notice, of course."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I?" Ramsey demanded, sharply. "Why didn't I notice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing. But, as I was saying, I don't think that sort of
talk does much harm: everybody knows it goes on among the pro-Germans,
and it's all hot air, anyhow. But I think Linski's sort of talk
does do harm, prob'ly among people that don't know much; and what's
more, I think Dora Yocum's does some, too. Well, you hit Linski
in the snoot, so what are you&mdash; Sit still! My lord! You don't
think I'm askin' you to go and hit Dora, do you? I mean: Aren't
you ever goin' to talk to her about it and tell her what's what?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you go on to bed!"</p>

<p>"No, I'm in earnest," Fred urged. "Honestly, aren't you ever
goin' to?"</p>

<p>"How could I do anything like that?" Ramsey demanded explosively.
"I never see her&mdash;to speak to, that is. I prob'ly won't happen
to have another talk with her, or anything, all the time we're
in college."</p>

<p>"No," Fred admitted, "I suppose not. Of course, if you did, then
you would give her quite a talking-to, just the way you did the
other time, wouldn't you?" But upon that, another resumption of
physical violence put an end to the conversation.</p>
