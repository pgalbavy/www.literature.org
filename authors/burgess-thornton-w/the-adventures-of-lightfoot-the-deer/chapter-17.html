<p>When Reddy Fox arrived at the pond of Paddy the Beaver, the hunter
who was hiding there saw him instantly. So did Lightfoot. But
no one else did. He approached in that cautious, careful way that
he always uses when he is hunting. The instant he reached a place
where he could see all over Paddy's pond, he stopped as suddenly
as if he had been turned to stone. He stopped with one foot lifted
in the act of taking a step. He had seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack.</p>

<p>Now you know there is nothing Reddy Fox likes better for a dinner
than a Duck. The instant he saw Mr. and Mrs. Quack, a gleam of
longing crept into his eyes and his mouth began to water. He stood
motionless until both Mr. and Mrs. Quack had their heads under
water as they searched for food in the mud in the bottom of the
pond. Then like a red flash he bounded out of sight behind the
dam of Paddy the Beaver.</p>

<p>Presently the hunter saw Reddy's black nose at the end of the
dam as Reddy peeped around it to watch Mr. and Mrs. Quack. The
latter were slowly moving along in that direction as they fed.
Reddy was quick to see this. If he remained right where he was,
and Mr. and Mrs. Quack kept on feeding in that direction, the
chances were that he would have a dinner of fat Duck. All he need
do was to be patient and wait. So, with his eyes fixed fast on
Mr. and Mrs. Quack, Reddy Fox crouched behind Paddy's dam and
waited.</p>

<p>Watching Reddy and the Ducks, the hunter almost forgot Lightfoot
the Deer. Mr. and Mrs. Quack were getting very near to where Reddy
was waiting for them. The hunter was tempted to get up and frighten
those Ducks. He didn't want Reddy Fox to have them, because he
hoped some day to get them himself.</p>

<p>"I suppose," thought he, "I was foolish not to shoot them when
I had the chance. They are too far away now, and it looks very
much as if that red rascal will get one of them. I believe I'll
spoil that red scamp's plans by frightening them away. I don't
believe that Deer will be back here to-day anyway, so I may as
well save those Ducks."</p>

<p>But the hunter did nothing of the kind. You see, just as he was
getting ready to step out from his hiding-place, Sammy Jay arrived.
He perched in a tree close to the end of Paddy's dam and at once
he spied Reddy Fox. It didn't take him a second to discover what
Reddy was hiding there for. "Thief, thief, thief!" screamed Sammy,
and then looked down at Reddy with a mischievous look in his sharp
eyes. There is nothing Sammy Jay delights in more than in upsetting
the plans of Reddy Fox. At the sound of Sammy's voice, Mr. and
Mrs. Quack swam hurriedly towards the middle of the pond. They
knew exactly what that warning meant. Reddy Fox looked up at Sammy
Jay and snarled angrily. Then, knowing it was useless to hide
longer, he bounded away through the Green Forest to hunt elsewhere.</p>
