It's what you do for others,<br/>
Not what they do for you,<br/>
That makes you feel so happy<br/>
All through and through and through.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</div>
<p>Reddy Fox ran all the way home from the Big River just as fast
as he could go. In his mouth he carried the fish he had found
and from which he had taken just two bites. You remember he had
had a battle with himself over that fish, and now he was running
away from himself. That sounds funny, doesn't it? But it was true.
Yes, Sir, Reddy Fox was running away from himself. He was afraid
that if he didn't get home to Old Granny Fox with that fish very
soon, he would eat every last bit of it himself. So he was running
his very hardest so as to get there before this could happen.
So really he was running away from himself, from his selfish self.</p>

<p>Old Granny Fox was on the doorstep watching for him, and he saw
just how her hungry old eyes brightened when she saw him and what
he had.</p>

<p>"I've brought you something to eat, Granny," he panted, as he
laid the fish at her feet. He was quite out of breath with running.
"It isn't much, but it is something. It is all I could find for
you."</p>

<p>Granny looked at the fish and then she looked sharply at Reddy,
and into those keen yellow eyes of hers crept a soft, tender look,
such a look as you would never have believed they could have held.</p>

<p>"What have <em>YOU </em>had to eat?" asked Granny softly.</p>

<p>Reddy turned his head that Granny might not see his face. "Oh,
I've had something," said he, trying to speak lightly. It was
true; he had had two bites from that fish.</p>

<p>Now you know just how shrewd and smart and wise Granny Fox is.
Reddy didn't fool her just the least little bit. She took two
small bites from the fish.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, "we'll divide it," and she bit in two parts
what remained. In a twinkling she had gulped down the smallest
part, for you know she was very, very hungry. "That is your share,"
said she, as she pushed what remained over to Reddy.</p>

<p>Reddy tried to refuse it. "I brought it all for you," said he.
"I know you did, Reddy," replied Granny, and it seemed to Reddy
that he never had known her voice to sound so gentle. "You brought
it to me when all you had had was the two little bites you had
taken from it. You can't fool me, Reddy Fox. There wasn't one
good meal for either of us in that fish, but there was enough
to give us both a little hope and keep us from starving. Now you
mind what I say and eat your share." Granny said this last very
sternly.</p>

<p>Reddy looked at Granny, and then he bolted down that little piece
of fish without another word.</p>

<p>"That's better," said Granny. "We will feel better, both of us.
Now that I've something in my stomach, I feel two years younger.
Before you came, I didn't feel as if I should ever be able to
go on another hunt. If you hadn't brought something, I &mdash;I'm
afraid I couldn't have lasted much longer. By another day you
probably wouldn't have had old Granny to think of. You may not
know it, but I know that you saved my life, Reddy. I had reached
a point where I just had to have a little food. You know there
are times when a very little food is of more good than a lot of
food could be later. This was one of those times."</p>

<p>Never in all his life had Reddy Fox felt so truly happy. He was
still hungry,&mdash;very, very hungry. But he gave it no thought. He
had saved Granny Fox, good old Granny who had taught him all he
knew. And he knew that Granny knew how he had had to fight with
himself to do it. Reddy was happy through and through with the
great happiness that comes from having done something for some
one else.</p>

<p>"It was nothing," he muttered.</p>

<p>"It was a very great deal," replied Granny. And then she changed
the subject. "How would you like to eat a dinner of Bowser the
Hound's?" she asked.</p>
