<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Benny Badger began to lose patience with the deer mouse. He was one of
the most timid persons Benny had ever seen. And Benny was on the point
of telling him that he hadn't even the courage of a prairie dog.
</p>
<p>But suddenly a new idea flashed into his head. He thought he knew what
was troubling Mr. Deer Mouse.
</p><p>"When I asked you to join me at breakfast I didn't mean what you thought
I did," Benny announced. "You thought--didn't you?--that I meant to
breakfast on <u>you</u>."
</p><p>Mr. Deer Mouse admitted faintly that he had had some such notion.
</p><p>"How ridiculous!" Benny Badger cried. "Why, you're so quick that I could
chase you all day--and all night, too--without catching you. You're too
spry for me. So we might as well put such an idea out of our minds."
</p><p>Benny Badger sighed as he spoke. And he couldn't help noticing, once
more, how very, very plump Mr. Deer Mouse was.
</p><p>"What I meant by your joining me at a good meal was simply this," he
continued: "If you'll only stay with me, and follow me quietly wherever
I go, there's a good chance that you'll have a bone to gnaw before a
great while."
</p><p>All that seemed very pleasant to the deer mouse.
</p><p>"Thank you ever so much!" he murmured. "I'll be glad to accept your
invitation, so long as we aren't going to breakfast inside your new
home."
</p><p>So they set out. And for a time Mr. Deer Mouse followed Benny Badger all
around the neighborhood.
</p><p>Though Benny kept a sharp watch on all sides, he couldn't see
anything--or anybody--that promised a meal. And he decided at last that
he would have to make a change of some sort in his plans.
</p><p>So he sat down and beckoned to Mr. Deer Mouse to move nearer.
</p><p>"You go ahead of me, and I'll follow you," he said. "You're smaller than
I am, and perhaps you won't frighten the game the way I do."
</p><p>Mr. Deer Mouse did not seem to care for the suggestion.
</p><p>"You might make a mistake," he objected. "If I went ahead of you, you
might think that I was the game. And there might be a terrible
accident."
</p><p>Benny Badger sniffed.
</p><p>"Nonsense!" he cried. "If I did make such a mistake, I promise you that
I wouldn't let it happen more than once."
</p><p>But the deer mouse proved to be a stubborn chap. He declined flatly to
do as Benny wanted.
</p><p>"Very well!" said Benny Badger gruffly. "I'm sorry that you don't care
to make things as pleasant as possible for a newcomer. Where I used to
live, people couldn't do enough for me."
</p><p>"I believe you," Mr. Deer Mouse retorted. "In fact, I've heard that a
man even set a trap for you, right in your own doorway."
</p><p>Of course, that news came to Benny Badger as a great surprise. He had
had no idea that Mr. Deer Mouse knew anything about him.
</p><p>"Somebody has been gossiping!" Benny Badger growled angrily. "Who told
you that?"
</p><p>"Goodness me! Everybody has heard about it," Mr. Deer Mouse replied.
"Don't you know that news travels fast over the plains?"
</p><p>"Does it travel as fast as I do?" Benny Badger asked him suddenly.
</p><p>Before the words were out of his mouth he leaped at Mr. Deer Mouse. And
for one as heavy as he was, Benny leaped with surprising swiftness.
</p><p>But quick as he was, he was too slow to catch Mr. Deer Mouse napping.
That nimble fellow seemed to melt away right beneath Benny Badger's
paws.
</p><p>For one moment Benny was sure he had him. And the next moment he was
sure he hadn't.
</p><p>He couldn't see his small neighbor anywhere. In fact, it was a whole
week before Benny Badger set his eyes on him again. And to Benny's
amazement, Mr. Deer Mouse was just as polite as ever. He asked Benny how
he liked his new home, and if he had found the people in the
neighborhood as pleasant as he had expected.
</p><p>"My house is a fine one," Benny told him. "And I dare say the
neighborhood is as good as I could expect. Certainly there's a plenty of
Gophers and Prairie Dogs here."
</p><p>"I suppose"--said Mr. Deer Mouse--"I suppose some of them join you at
breakfast every morning."
</p><p>Benny Badger looked at him sharply. He was all ready to get angry. But
Mr. Deer Mouse was so polite, and seemed so respectful, that Benny was
ashamed to lose his temper.
</p><p>He actually winked at Mr. Deer Mouse. And he felt more cheerful than he
had since the rancher spoke ill of him.
</p><p>"I'm glad I moved," he told Mr. Deer Mouse. "This is a fine place. I'm
going to live here the rest of my life."
</p><p>And he did.

</p><p><u>Drawings by HARRY L. SMITH</u>
</p><p>These little books for little people tell of the adventures of the
four-footed creatures of our American woods and fields in an amusing way
which delights small two-footed human beings; and at the same time, in
the shortcomings of Cuffy Bear and his neighbors, children are quick to
recognize their own faults and to take home the obvious lessons.

<p>Tuck-Me-In Tales
</p><p>(Trademark Registered)
</p><p>By ARTHUR SCOTT BAILEY
</p><p><u>Wrappers and illustrations in color.</u>
</p><p><u>Drawings by HARRY L. SMITH</u>
</p><p>The stories of Jolly Robin, Old Mr. Crow and the other birds are as
unusual as they are delightful, since this is almost the first time
these feathered friends of the kiddies have appeared in print. These
bird stories, like the Sleepy-Time animal stories, are based upon actual
natural history facts, but while the youngster eagerly listens to them,
a moral foundation, of deeper importance than that in natural history,
is being laid.
