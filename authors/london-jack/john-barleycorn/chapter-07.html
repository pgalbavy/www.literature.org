I was barely turned fifteen, and working long hours in a cannery. 
Month in and month out, the shortest day I ever worked was ten
hours.  When to ten hours of actual work at a machine is added the
noon hour; the walking to work and walking home from work; the
getting up in the morning, dressing, and eating; the eating at
night, undressing, and going to bed, there remains no more than
the nine hours out of the twenty-four required by a healthy
youngster for sleep.  Out of those nine hours, after I was in bed
and ere my eyes drowsed shut, I managed to steal a little time for
reading.
<P>
But many a night I did not knock off work until midnight.  On
occasion I worked eighteen and twenty hours on a stretch.  Once I
worked at my machine for thirty-six consecutive hours.  And there
were weeks on end when I never knocked off work earlier than
eleven o'clock, got home and in bed at half after midnight, and
was called at half-past five to dress, eat, walk to work, and be
at my machine at seven o'clock whistle blow.
<P>
No moments here to be stolen for my beloved books.  And what had
John Barleycorn to do with such strenuous, Stoic toil of a lad
just turned fifteen? He had everything to do with it.  Let me show
you.  I asked myself if this were the meaning of life--to be a
work-beast? I knew of no horse in the city of Oakland that worked
the hours I worked.  If this were living, I was entirely
unenamoured of it.  I remembered my skiff, lying idle and
accumulating barnacles at the boat-wharf; I remembered the wind
that blew every day on the bay, the sunrises and sunsets I never
saw; the bite of the salt air in my nostrils, the bite of the salt
water on my flesh when I plunged overside; I remembered all the
beauty and the wonder and the sense-delights of the world denied
me.  There was only one way to escape my deadening toil.  I must
get out and away on the water.  I must earn my bread on the water. 
And the way of the water led inevitably to John Barleycorn.  I did
not know this.  And when I did learn it, I was courageous enough
not to retreat back to my bestial life at the machine.
<P>
I wanted to be where the winds of adventure blew.  And the winds
of adventure blew the oyster pirate sloops up and down San
Francisco Bay, from raided oyster-beds and fights at night on
shoal and flat, to markets in the morning against city wharves,
where peddlers and saloon-keepers came down to buy.  Every raid on
an oyster-bed was a felony.  The penalty was State imprisonment,
the stripes and the lockstep.  And what of that? The men in
stripes worked a shorter day than I at my machine.  And there was
vastly more romance in being an oyster pirate or a convict than in
being a machine slave.  And behind it all, behind all of me with
youth abubble, whispered Romance, Adventure.
<P>
So I interviewed my Mammy Jennie, my old nurse at whose black
breast I had suckled.  She was more prosperous than my folks.  She
was nursing sick people at a good weekly wage.  Would she lend her
"white child" the money?  WOULD SHE?  What she had was mine.
<P>
Then I sought out French Frank, the oyster pirate, who wanted to
sell, I had heard, his sloop, the Razzle Dazzle.  I found him
lying at anchor on the Alameda side of the estuary near the
Webster Street bridge, with visitors aboard, whom he was
entertaining with afternoon wine.  He came on deck to talk
business.  He was willing to sell.  But it was Sunday.  Besides,
he had guests.  On the morrow he would make out the bill of sale
and I could enter into possession. And in the meantime I must come
below and meet his friends.  They were two sisters, Mamie and
Tess; a Mrs. Hadley, who chaperoned them; "Whisky" Bob, a youthful
oyster pirate of sixteen; and "Spider" Healey, a black-whiskered
wharf-rat of twenty.  Mamie, who was Spider's niece, was called
the Queen of the Oyster Pirates, and, on occasion, presided at
their revels.  French Frank was in love with her, though I did not
know it at the time; and she steadfastly refused to marry him.
<P>
French Frank poured a tumbler of red wine from a big demijohn to
drink to our transaction.  I remembered the red wine of the
Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly.  Whisky and beer were not
quite so repulsive.  But the Queen of the Oyster Pirates was
looking at me, a part-emptied glass in her own hand.  I had my
pride.  If I was only fifteen, at least I could not show myself
any less a man than she.  Besides, there were her sister, and Mrs.
Hadley, and the young oyster pirate, and the whiskered wharf-rat,
all with glasses in their hands.  Was I a milk-and-water sop? No;
a thousand times no, and a thousand glasses no.  I downed the
tumblerful like a man.
<P>
French Frank was elated by the sale, which I had bound with a
twenty-dollar goldpiece.  He poured more wine.  I had learned my
strong head and stomach, and I was certain I could drink with them
in a temperate way and not poison myself for a week to come.  I
could stand as much as they; and besides, they had already been
drinking for some time.
<P>
We got to singing.  Spider sang "The Boston Burglar" and "Black
Lulu." The Queen sang "Then I Wisht I Were a Little Bird." And her
sister Tess sang "Oh, Treat My Daughter Kindily." The fun grew
fast and furious.  I found myself able to miss drinks without
being noticed or called to account.  Also, standing in the
companionway, head and shoulders out and glass in hand, I could
fling the wine overboard.
<P>
I reasoned something like this: It is a queerness of these people
that they like this vile-tasting wine.  Well, let them.  I cannot
quarrel with their tastes.  My manhood, according to their queer
notions, must compel me to appear to like this wine.  Very well. 
I shall so appear.  But I shall drink no more than is unavoidable.
<P>
And the Queen began to make love to me, the latest recruit to the
oyster pirate fleet, and no mere hand, but a master and owner. 
She went upon deck to take the air, and took me with her.  She
knew, of course, but I never dreamed, how French Frank was raging
down below.  Then Tess joined us, sitting on the cabin; and
Spider, and Bob; and at the last, Mrs. Hadley and French Frank. 
And we sat there, glasses in hand, and sang, while the big
demijohn went around; and I was the only strictly sober one.
<P>
And I enjoyed it as no one of them was able to enjoy it.  Here, in
this atmosphere of bohemianism, I could not but contrast the scene
with my scene of the day before, sitting at my machine, in the
stifling, shut-in air, repeating, endlessly repeating, at top
speed, my series of mechanical motions.  And here I sat now, glass
in hand, in warm-glowing camaraderie, with the oyster pirates,
adventurers who refused to be slaves to petty routine, who flouted
restrictions and the law, who carried their lives and their
liberty in their hands.  And it was through John Barleycorn that I
came to join this glorious company of free souls, unashamed and
unafraid.
<P>
And the afternoon seabreeze blew its tang into my lungs, and
curled the waves in mid-channel.  Before it came the scow
schooners, wing-and-wing, blowing their horns for the drawbridges
to open.  Red-stacked tugs tore by, rocking the Razzle Dazzle in
the waves of their wake.  A sugar barque towed from the "boneyard"
to sea.  The sun-wash was on the crisping water, and life was big. 
And Spider sang:
<P>
<P>
    "Oh, it's Lulu, black Lulu, my darling,
       Oh, it's where have you been so long?
          Been layin' in jail,
          A-waitin' for bail,
     Till my bully comes rollin' along."
<P>
<P>
There it was, the smack and slap of the spirit of revolt, of
adventure, of romance, of the things forbidden and done defiantly
and grandly.  And I knew that on the morrow I would not go back to
my machine at the cannery.  To-morrow I would be an oyster pirate,
as free a freebooter as the century and the waters of San
Francisco Bay would permit.  Spider had already agreed to sail
with me as my crew of one, and, also, as cook while I did the deck
work.  We would outfit our grub and water in the morning, hoist
the big mainsail (which was a bigger piece of canvas than any I
had ever sailed under), and beat our way out the estuary on the
first of the seabreeze and the last of the ebb.  Then we would
slack sheets, and on the first of the flood run down the bay to
the Asparagus Islands, where we would anchor miles off shore.  And
at last my dream would be realised: I would sleep upon the water. 
And next morning I would wake upon the water; and thereafter all
my days and nights would be on the water.
<P>
And the Queen asked me to row her ashore in my skiff, when at
sunset French Frank prepared to take his guests ashore.  Nor did I
catch the significance of his abrupt change of plan when he turned
the task of rowing his skiff over to Whisky Bob, himself remaining
on board the sloop.  Nor did I understand Spider's grinning side-
remark to me: "Gee! There's nothin' slow about YOU." How could it
possibly enter my boy's head that a grizzled man of fifty should
be jealous of me?
