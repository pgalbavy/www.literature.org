<p>Deerfoot threw himself over the side of the canoe into the river,
holding fast to the gunwale with one hand and keeping the boat
between him and the Indians on shore.  With the arm which was
free, he swam toward the Louisiana side, towing the craft after
him.</p>

<p>While it seemed absolutely necessary that something of the kind
should be done, yet the reader will perceive that the course of
the Shawanoe was extremely perilous, not only for himself, but
for his friends whom he was so anxious to benefit.  His removal
from the canoe caused it to ride higher, and thereby exposed them
to the bullets that were continually skipping about it.  Deerfoot
himself was forced to keep his shoulders at such an elevation
that he was liable to be perforated by some flying missiles, but
he increased the distance between himself and enemies with greater
speed than would be supposed.</p>

<p>"I dinks dis ish good style," said Otto to Jack, who moved his
head so as to see what he was doing.  The sagacious German had
gathered the three paddles so they were added to that side of
the craft which served as a partial shield against the shots from
the shore.  The implements were so arranged that the lad felt
safe against harm, unless the boat should turn half way round
before he could accommodate himself to the changed condition of
things.</p>

<p>"It is a good idea," said Jack, admiringly, as he hastened to
avail himself of the defense; "I don't believe one of their bullets
can pierce our shield."</p>

<p>Something cold made itself felt through the clothing of the young
Kentuckian, where his hip pressed the bottom of the canoe.  Groping
with his hand he found it was water, which he saw bubbling through
a bullet-hole that was forced below the surface by the vigor of
Deerfoot's arm.  The opposite side of the boat was lifted correspondingly
high, so that the sunlight shone through.</p>

<p>It will be understood that the conditions prevented the Shawanoe
from towing the boat directly across the Mississippi.  The swift
current rendered a diagonal course necessary, and even that could
not be pushed with enough power to prevent the party drifting
down stream.</p>

<p>The red men kept up a desultory fire, but it was less frequent
and manifestly less hopeful than at first.  They could not but
see that the craft was steadily passing beyond range, and the
chances of inflicting injury grew less every moment.  Soon the
firing ceased altogether.</p>

<p>A moment later, the dripping form of Deerfoot flipped over the
gunwale again, diffusing moisture in every direction.  Without
a word, he seized the paddle and plied it with his old-time skill
and vigor.  He looked keenly toward Kentucky, but saw nothing
of his enemies: they must have concluded to withdraw and bestow
their attention elsewhere.</p>

<p>But, convinced that they were still watching the course of the
canoe, he again rose to his feet, and, circling the paddle over
his head, gave utterance to a number of tantalizing whoops.  His
enemies had been outwitted with such cleverness that the youth
could not deny himself the pleasure of expressing his exultation
in that characteristic fashion.</p>

<p>When Jack Carleton discovered the water bubbling through the
bullet-hole in the side of the canoe, as though it was a tiny
spring that had just burst forth, he was afraid it would sink
the craft. He inserted the end of his finger to check, in some
measure, the flow; but Deerfoot, observing the act, shook his
head to signify it was unnecessary.</p>

<p>"My brothers shall reach land," he said.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt we shall, since you are using the paddle again,
but a little while ago it looked as though the land we were going
to reach was at the bottom of the river.  Deerfoot," added Jack,
with a smile, "they have punctured this boat pretty thoroughly. 
I cannot understand how it was we all escaped when the bullets
seemed to be everywhere."</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit turned aside the bullets," said the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"No he didn't," was the sturdy response of Jack; "I acknowledge
His mercies, which have followed us all the days of our lives,
but that is not the way He works.  You know as well as do I, that
if yon get in the way of a Shawanoe or Miami rifle, you will be
hit unless yon are very quick to get out of the way again; but
for all that," the Kentuckian hastened to add, noticing a reproving
expression on the countenance of his dusky friend, "my heart overflows
with gratitude because we have been saved, when there seemed not
the first ray of hope for us.  The bullets came near, but none
touched us."</p>

<p>"I dinks different," was the unexpected remark of Otto, who,
assuming the sitting position, took off his cap, and, after fumbling
awhile through his shock of yellow hair, actually found a ball,
which he held up between his fingers.</p>

<p>"Vot don't you dinks ob him, eh?" he asked, triumphantly.</p>

<p>The amazed Jack took the object and examined it.  No need was
there of doing so; it was a rifle ball beyond question.</p>

<p>"How in the name of all that's wonderful did that get into your
hair?" asked his friend.</p>

<p>"I 'spose he was shot dere, and my head was too hard for it to
pass through, so he stops, don't it?"</p>

<p>The canoe was so close to shore that Deerfoot stopped paddling
for the moment and extended his band for the missile.  He simply
held it up, glanced at it, and then tossed it back to Otto with
the remark:</p>

<p>"The head of my brother is thick like the rock, but the ball
was not fired from a gun."</p>

<p>With a bewildered expression, as though some forgotten fact was
beginning to dawn upon him, Otto laid his cap in his lap and began
searching through his hair with both hands.  A moment later, his
face beamed with one of his most expansive smiles, and he showed
two more rifle-bullets that had been fished from the capillary
depths.</p>

<p>"Yaw, I forgots him; I puts dem pullets in mine hat yesterday
and I dinks dey was lost; dat is looky, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything particularly lucky about it," said Jack,
who suspected that much of the lad's stupidity was assumed.  A
healthy youngster never fails to have the organ of mirth well
forward in development, and the promptings of Otto's innate love
of fun seemed to have little regard for time, place or circumstances.</p>

<p>The American Indian is probably the most melancholy of the five
races of men; but even he is not lacking in the element of mirth
which it is maintained is often displayed by dumb animals.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot heard the explanation of Otto, he did not smile,
but with a grave expression of countenance gave his entire attention
to the paddle in his hand.  The German sat with his back toward
the front of the canoe, the other two facing him, the Shawanoe
being at the rear.  The shore was only a few rods away, the Mississippi
being much less agitated at the side than in the middle.</p>

<p>Without any display of effort, the warrior used the long paddle
with all the power he could put forth.  Very soon the craft attained
a speed greater than either of the pale faces suspected.</p>

<p>"No," repeated Jack Carleton, "I can't see where there is any
special luck in finding the bullets in your hair; I shouldn't
be surprised if they had been there for a week.  You must use
a very coarse-toothed comb."</p>

<p>"My brother uses no comb at all," suggested Deerfoot, in a solemn
voice, from the rear of the boat, which was speeding like an arrow
over the water.</p>

<p>"Now you have struck the truth," laughed Jack.</p>

<p>Otto rose to a stooping position, steadying himself as best he
could, and extended his hand to shake that of the Shawanoe, as
proof that he indorsed his remark.  He placed a hand on the shoulder
of the Kentuckian to steady himself, for he knew that it is a
difficult matter for one to keep his balance in such a delicate
structure as an Indian canoe.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot ish not such a pig fool as he don't look to be, somedimes
I dinks he knows more nodins dan nopody; den van he h'ists sail
in his canoe and sails off mitout saying nodings to nopody, den
I don't dinks."</p>

<p>Otto Relstaub had reached that point in his remark, when the
bow of the canoe arrived in Louisiana.  It struck the shore with
a violence that started the seams through the entire structure. 
The author of all this of course kept his seat, for he had braced
himself for the shook.  At the same time he caught the shoulder
of Jack Carleton, as if to hold him quiet, but it was all pretense
on his part.  There was no "grip" to his fingers, and Jack immediately
plunged forward, his head bumping the bottom of the boat with
a crash.</p>

<p>As for Otto Relstaub, the consequences took away his breath. 
As he was trying to stand on his feet, he had a great deal more
of falling to do it than his friend.  He did it most thoroughly,
sitting down with such emphasis that the side of the canoe gave
way, and he continued the act on dry land, being stopped by a
small sapling in his path.</p>

<p>Otto whirled over on his face, and scrambling to his feet, stared
around to learn the extent of the calamity.  He gathered up his
gun and hat, and then, stooping, passed his hands over the bark
and attentively examined it.</p>

<p>"I dinks it ish split a good deal mit my head," he remarked,
with a grave countenance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jack Carleton had regained his upright position and
shaken himself together.  When he saw Otto in an inverted position,
he broke into hearty laughter, hastened, no doubt, by the fact
that Deerfoot was shaking from head to foot with mirth.  His black
eyes glistened with tears, caused by his amusement over the performance
of the German.  He was laughing all over, though he gave out not
the slightest sound.</p>

<p>As for Jack Carleton, he chuckled and gurgled with a noise like
that of water running out of a bottle, while the main victim of
all this merriment was as solemn as an owl.  After rubbing and
adjusting himself, as may be said, he turned slowly about and
gazed inquiringly at his friends in the boat, as if puzzled to
understand the cause of their emotions.</p>

<p>"Vot ish dot you seem to laugh mit?" he demanded, in an injured
voice; "I see nodings."</p>

<p>When the others had somewhat recovered from their mirth, Otto
began laughing with scarcely less heartiness than they showed. 
The absurd occurrence seemed slow to impress itself upon his consciousness.</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not allow himself to remain idle many minutes. 
The fractured front of the craft being immovably fixed in the
bank, he leaned his head over the side and washed the paint from
his face. He disliked to disfigure himself in that fashion, though
he always carried the stuff with him, to be used in such an emergency
as has been described.</p>

<p>The blanket stolen from him had been carried away by one of the
warriors, so that Deerfoot held only the rifle and ammunition
in the way of a reprisal; but they were more than sufficient to
replace the property he had lost, and he had no cause for complaint.</p>

<p>Stepping on solid land again, with the water dripping from his
clothing, the handsome warrior stood erect, and looked at Kentucky
across the "Father of Waters."  Instead of the villages and towns
which now grace the locality, he saw only the lonely woods stretching
north and south until lost to view.</p>

<p>But he knew enemies were there, and the keen vision of the youth
was searching for them.  They must have become discouraged over
what had taken place, for not the first sign of the red men could
be discerned. They seemed to have "folded their tents," and stolen
off as silently as the Arabs.</p>

<p>But far down the Mississippi, a canoe put out from the Kentucky
side and approached the opposite bank.  It kept out of sight until
Deerfoot the Shawanoe had withdrawn, and then it advanced with
the care and stealth of the trained Indian on the war-path.</p>

<p>The craft was full of Miamis and Shawanoes, armed to the teeth,
and impelled by the greatest incentive that can inflame the passions
of the American Indian&mdash;revenge.</p>
