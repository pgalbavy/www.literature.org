<p>"<em>SLOW </em>down," said Detective Calvert as the launch drew
near the southern end of Barter Island. Captain Alvin did as requested
and all eyes were fixed upon the inlet.</p>

<p>"If that boat should happen to come out while we are in sight,"
added Calvert, "pass up the river, as if you had no interest in
it."</p>

<p>"But if it should happen to be there?" said Alvin, repeating
the question he had asked before.</p>

<p>"We can't know until we have turned in, and then it would not
do to withdraw, for that would be the most suspicious course of
all. You have as much right to go thither as anyone. Act as if
you were merely looking in out of curiosity; make a circuit of
the islet and then come back and go on up the Sheepscot toward
Wiscasset."</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Mike Murphy asked a question whose
point the others were quick to perceive.</p>

<p>"If the spalpeens are there, will ye let 'em have a sight of
yersilf?"</p>

<p>"No; I shall drop down and hide, for if they noted that you had
me for a passenger they might smell a rat, but would think nothing
of seeing you three, for they know you travel together."</p>

<p>As the launch drew near the opening, Alvin slackened her speed
still more until she was not going faster than five or six miles
an hour. There was an abundance of sea room and he curved into
the passage with his usual skill. The four peered intently forward
and had to wait only a minute or two when the boat had progressed
far enough to give them a full view of the crescent-like cove,
which extended backward for several hundred yards and had an expansion
of perhaps four hundred feet. In the very middle was the islet,
in the form of an irregular oval, containing altogether barely
an acre. As has been said, it was made up of clay and sand with
not a tree or shrub growing, and only a few scattered leaves of
grass, but there was no sign of life on or about it.</p>

<p>Alvin sheered the boat close to the shore, and continued slowly
moving. A glance downward into the crystal current showed that
the depth was fully twenty feet, so that it was safe for the largest
craft to moor against the bank.</p>

<p>"Here's where the <em>Water Witch</em> lay," said Alvin. "Do
you wish to land, Mr. Calvert?"</p>

<p>He was standing up and scrutinizing the little plot as they glided
along the shore, but discovered nothing of interest.</p>

<p>"No; there's no call to stop; we may as well go back."</p>

<p>"Do ye obsarve that six-masted schooner wid its nose poked under
the bushes in the hope of escaping notice?"</p>

<p>As Mike Murphy asked the question he pointed to the southern
shore of the inlet, where all saw the little rowboat in which
Detective Calvert had visited the spot and which had been used
later for a similar purpose by Alvin and Chester. It was drawn
up so far under the overhanging limbs that only the stern was
in sight. It seemed to be exactly where it had been placed by
the boys after they were through with it.</p>

<p>It was on the tip of Alvin's tongue to refer to the incident
and to ask something in the way of explanation from their companion.
Instead of doing so, the latter surprised both by saying:</p>

<p>"That must belong to somebody who lives in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>The remark sounded strange to our young friends and both remained
silent waiting for him to say more, but he did not. He sat down
again, facing the Sheepscot, and lighted one of his big black
cigars. He crossed his legs like a man of leisure who was not
concerned by what had occurred or was likely to occur.</p>

<p>The incident impressed Alvin and Chester unfavorably. Mike, not
having been with them at the time, knew nothing of it. To each
of the former youths came the disquieting questions:</p>

<p>"Does he believe we did not know him that night? Does he think
neither of us suspected what he did? <em>Is he what he pretends
to be?</em>"</p>

<p>These queries opened a field of speculation that was endless,
and the farther they plunged into it the more mystified they became.
Alvin would never stoop to ask favors of this man. He was trying
to aid him in carrying out a good purpose, and he must "be on
the level," or the Captain would have nothing to do with him or
his plans.</p>

<p>"The first proof I get that he is playing double," muttered Alvin,
"I'll order him off the boat and never let him set foot on it
again, and, if he belongs to that gang of post office robbers,
I'll do everything I can to have him punished."</p>

<p>One of the most discomforting frames of mind into which any person
can fall is to see things which make him distrust the loyalty
of one upon whom he has depended. It might be Alvin Landon was
mistaken and Stockham Calvert was in reality a Pinkerton detective
whose sole aim was to bring these criminals to justice; but, as
I have shown, the full truth was still to be learned.</p>

<p>And Chester Haynes' feelings were the same as those of his chum.
He glanced at the man who was puffing his perfecto, and wondered
who he really was and what was to be the end of this curious adventure
upon which he and Alvin had entered.</p>

<p>It was a brief run out to the Sheepscot, and the <em>Deerfoot</em>
headed up the river again toward Wiscasset. A steam launch was
seen off to the left and a catboat skimmed in the same direction
with our friends. Both were well over toward Westport, the left-hand
bank, and slight attention was given them.</p>

<p>The <em>Deerfoot</em> had not reached the upper end of Barter
Island when Alvin from his place as steerer called out:</p>

<p>"That looks like the boat we are hunting for."</p>

<p>Running closer in to the right shore than the <em>Deerfoot</em>,
a second boat was visible whose similarity of appearance caused
astonishment. The bows of the two being pointed toward each other,
the view was incomplete at first, but since the speed of each
was all of ten miles an hour, they rapidly came opposite. Alvin
sheered to the left, so as to make an interval of a hundred yards
between them. Chester had caught up the binoculars and kept watch
upon the launch, his companions doing what they could without
the aid of any instrument.</p>

<p>"It's the <em>Water Witch</em>!" said Chester excitedly.</p>

<p>A minute before he did so, Detective Calvert quietly slipped
from his seat to the floor, removed his hat and cautiously peered
over the taffrail. But he did not cease smoking his huge cigar,
and it struck Alvin when he looked around that his head was high
enough to be in plain sight of anyone watching from the other
craft.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy caught the stir of the moment.</p>

<p>"How many passengers do ye obsarve on the same frigate? It seems
to me there be only two."</p>

<p>"That is all that are visible," replied Chester, holding the
glass still leveled.</p>

<p>"Thin they must be them two that we had the shindy wid the ither
night!"</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly; in fact I recognize the one you pointed out at
Boothbay."</p>

<p>"And the ither must be the ither one."</p>

<p>"There is every reason to believe so."</p>

<p>"Thin-&mdash;I say, Captain," said the agitated Mike, turning
to Alvin, "would ye be kind enough to run up alongside that ship?"</p>

<p>"Why do you wish me to do that?"</p>

<p>"I wish&mdash;that is &mdash;I wud like to shake hands wid that gintleman
and ask him how his folks was whin he last heerd from them. Just
a wee bit of friendly converse betwaan two gintlemen&mdash;that's all.
Come now, Cap, be obliging," continued Mike, in a wheedling tone
which did not deceive his superior officer.</p>

<p>"I faal a sort of liking for the young gintleman and should be
much pleased if ye would give me a chance to have a few frindly
words wid him &mdash;I say, Cap, ye're losing vallyble time, fur
we're passing each ither fast."</p>

<p>"No, Mike&mdash;not to-day; I have no objection to your having a little
'conversation' with Mr. Noxon or his companion, but this isn't
the right way to go about it."</p>

<p>"I hope ye didn't suspict that I had any intintion of saying
harsh wurruds to them, Cap!" protested the Irish youth, in grieved
tones.</p>

<p>"Not words particularly, but there would be enough rough acts
to make things lively. Chester, let me have the glasses, while
you take the wheel for a few minutes."</p>

<p>They hastily exchanged places, and steadying his position, Alvin
pointed the instrument at the receding launch. Detective Calvert
still knelt on the floor and peeped over the side of the boat.
He did not ask for the binoculars nor did the owner offer them
to him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Alvin slipped down beside his friend in front and passed
him the instrument, as he resumed the wheel. While doing so, he
whispered in a voice so low that no one else could hear what he
said:</p>

<p>"Look just behind the fellow who is steering. He's Noxon, I'm
sure! Study closely and let me know whether you see anything suspicious."</p>

<p>Wondering to what he referred, Chester complied. While doing
his best to learn what his friend meant the latter whispered again:</p>

<p>"If you see anything, be careful to let no one besides me know
what it is."</p>

<p>Chester nodded, with the glasses to his eyes. The opportunity
for scrutiny was rapidly diminishing. Chester held the binoculars
level but a minute when he lowered them again. The commonest courtesy
compelled him to offer them to the detective.</p>

<p>"Maybe you can discover something," remarked the youth as he
passed them over. The posture of the man gave him the best chance
he could ask, and he carefully studied the receding boat until
it was so far off that it was useless to continue.</p>

<p>"Did you notice anything special?" asked Chester.</p>

<p>"I saw nothing but those two young men, with whom as I learn
from the Captain he had an affray some nights ago."</p>

<p>Chester leaned over and whispered to Alvin:</p>

<p>"I saw it plainly."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"A man crouching down among the seats as Calvert did and peering
over like him."</p>
