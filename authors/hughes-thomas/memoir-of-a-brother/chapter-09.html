<p>On his return from his Italian tour my brother at once commenced
practice in the Ecclesiastical Courts, and took a small house
in Bell Yard, Doctors’ Commons, where he went to reside, and which
he describes to his mother as follows:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>April 1851.</em>—I am in excellent health and spirits. I have a<br/>
funny little house here: there are three floors and two rooms<br/>
on each: then there is a ground-floor, the front room of which<br/>
I use as an office, and the back room as a bath room, for I<br/>
stick diligently to the cold-water system. A kitchen below<br/>
completes my establishment. I have a housekeeper, who sits<br/>
downstairs in the kitchen and sleeps in the top story; she is<br/>
miraculously clean and tidy, and cooks very well, although I<br/>
never dine at home. She is also a wonderful gossip."

</p>
</div>
<p>Here he practised for a few years regularly, and with very fair
success, but his professional career was destined to be short
and broken, and need not detain us. It is his home life with which
we are concerned, and it was the pressure of what he looked upon
as a higher home duty which decided him, after a struggle, to
abandon his profession. He was married in the autumn of 1852,
and, in the course of a few years, the health of his wife’s mother
by adoption made it desirable that they should be always with
her, and that she should spend the winter months abroad. When
it became clear that this was necessary, he accepted it, and made
the best of it; though I find abundant traces in his correspondence
of the effort which it required to do so. Thus he writes from
Pau, the place fixed upon for their foreign winter residence,
"I always found that changing one’s residence and plans gave one
a fit of the blues for a time, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter."
And again; "The business of life is to be bored in all directions.
You must not imagine, however, that I am ill, or out of spirits.
I have no right to be either, and won’t be, please God." But the
necessary want of regular employment, the sinking into what is
called "an idle man," and abandoning all active part in "the struggle
for existence," was no small trial to one who held that the "full
employment of all powers, physical, mental, and spiritual, is
the true secret of happiness, so that no time may be left for
morbid self-analysis." You are all perhaps too young to understand
this, and probably, when you think about such matters at all,
imagine that the happiest life must be one in which you would
only have to amuse yourselves. It may, I hope, shake any such
belief to find that the period in my brother’s life in which he
was thus thrown on his own resources, and had the most complete
liberty to follow his own fancies, was just that in which you
may find traces of <em>ennui</em>, and a tendency to be dissatisfied
with the daily task of getting through time.</p>

<p>He took the best course of getting rid of the blues, however,
by throwing himself heartily into such occupations as were to
be had at Pau. The chief of these was a Pen and Pencil Club, to
which most of the English and American residents belonged, and
of which he became the secretary. Besides the ordinary meetings,
for which he wrote a number of <em>vers de société</em>, on the
current topics and doings of the place, the Club indulged in private
theatricals. On these occasions he was stage manager, and frequently
author; most of the charades and short pieces, which you have
seen, and acted in, at Offley, were originally written by him
for the Pen and Pencil Club at Pau. "It was a mild literary society,"
an old friend writes to me, "which he carried almost entirely
on his own shoulders, and made a success." Then he set to work
for the first time to cultivate in earnest his talent for music,
and took to playing the violoncello, communicating intelligence
of his own progress, and of musical doings at Pau generally, to
his sister, whom he looked upon as his guide and instructress.
These were not always devoid of incident, as for instance the
following:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>PAU, VILLA SALUSBURY</em>.

</p>
<p>
"We have an opera here this season. The <em>prima donna</em> and the<br/>
tenor are good; the rest so-so. The orchestra and chorus bad;<br/>
the basso execrable: when he doesn’t bellow like a bull, he<br/>
neighs like a horse; however, he does his best. I don’t know<br/>
how you feel, but to me a mediocre opera is an unmitigated<br/>
bore. I would rather by half hear a good French play. There<br/>
was a scene at the opera the other night. The conductor of<br/>
the orchestra is the <em>amant</em> of the contralto. Just before<br/>
the opera began, the conductor in a jealous fit tried to<br/>
strangle the contralto: whereupon the basso profundo knocked<br/>
the conductor down: whereupon the conductor ran off towards the<br/>
river to drown himself: whereupon he was knocked down again<br/>
to save his life: whereupon he threatened to cut everybody’s<br/>
throat: whereupon he was locked up in prison, and there<br/>
remains. So there is no conductor, and the contralto can’t sing<br/>
from the throttling."

</p>
</div>
<p>The violoncello soon grew to be a resource, and I believe he
played really well, though he used to groan to me as to the impossibility
of adapting adult fingers to the work, and to mourn over the barbarism
of our school days, when no one ever thought of music as a possible
study for boys. Soon, however, other objects of deeper interest
began to gather round him. His eldest boy was born in 1853, his
second in 1855, during their summer in England.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

"The young one," he writes to his sister, "is like his<br/>
mamma, they say, and is going to be dark, which will be a<br/>
good contrast to Herbert, who is a regular Saxon. I want his<br/>
(Herbert’s) yellow hair to grow long that it may be done into<br/>
a pigtail; I think it would look quaint and create a sensation<br/>
among the Cockneys, but I’m afraid I shan’t get my own way.<br/>
To return to the new arrival, you will be happy to hear that<br/>
he inherits your talent for music; he is always meandering<br/>
with his hands as if he was playing the violoncello; it is a<br/>
positive fact, I assure you, and makes me laugh to bursting<br/>
point. A—— must have been more struck with my performances than<br/>
I had credited. I feel quite flattered to possess an infant<br/>
phenomenon who played (or would have played) the violoncello,<br/>
if we had let him, from his birth. In the meantime that<br/>
instrument has been somewhat neglected by me. A——, the baby,<br/>
and the partridges (what a conjunction), divide my allegiance.<br/>
However, my music mania is as strong as ever, in spite of<br/>
the rather excruciating tones which all beginners draw from<br/>
the instrument: they tell me that the sounds resemble the<br/>
bellowings of a bereaved cow; luckily the house is a large one."

</p>
</div>
<p>He took to farming also, as another outlet for superfluous energy,
but without much greater success than generally falls to the lot
of amateurs. Indeed, his long winter absences from England kept
him from gaining anything more than a superficial knowledge of
agriculture, such as is disclosed in the following note to his
mother, in answer to inquiries as to crops and prospects:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Farming is better certainly this year than the last, but we<br/>
farmers always grumble, as you know, and I don’t like to say<br/>
anything until the new wheat is threshed. You ought to sow your<br/>
tares and rye immediately, and they will do very well after<br/>
potatoes; they ought to be well manured. If you mean by ‘rye’<br/>
Italian rye-grass, I don’t exactly know when it is best to sow<br/>
it; in the spring I believe, but I have never had any yet, and<br/>
you must ask about it. One thing I know, that it ought to have<br/>
liquid manure, to be put on directly after cutting; this will<br/>
give you a fresh crop in a little more than a month."

</p>
</div>
<p>When the Volunteer movement began, he threw himself into it at
once; for no man was more impatient of, or humiliated by, the
periodical panics which used to seize the country. He helped to
raise a corps in his own neighbourhood, of which he became captain,
and went to one of the first classes for Volunteers at the School
of Musketry, to make himself competent to teach his men. As to
the result he writes:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>UNDERCLIFF, <em>1860</em></em>.

</p>
<p>
"Our schooling at Hythe terminated on Friday last, on which<br/>
day 100 lunatics were let loose upon society. I say lunatics,<br/>
because all of us just now have but one idea, and talk,<br/>
think, and dream of nothing but the rifle (call it Miss<br/>
Enfield) morning, noon, and night. Colonel Welsford, the chief<br/>
instructor, is a charming man and a delightful lecturer, and<br/>
withal a greater lunatic than any of us—just the right man in<br/>
the right place. I shot fairly, but did not distinguish myself<br/>
as Harry did."

</p>
</div>
<p>I spoke of his "<em>vers de société</em>" just now, and in this
connection will here give you a specimen of them. The expenses
of the corps of course considerably exceeded the Government grant,
and the deficiency had to be met somehow. My brother started a
theatrical performance in the Town Hall, Hitchin, as a method
at once of making both ends meet, and of interesting the townspeople
in the corps. The last piece of the entertainment was one of his
own. The characters were played chiefly by members of his own
family. He himself acted the part of a pompous magistrate, and
at the close spoke the following</p>

<em>EPILOGUE</em>.

<p>
"Silence in Court! what’s this unseemly rumpus?<br/>
Attention to the parting words of Bumpus.<br/>
Tired of disguise, of borrowed rank and station,<br/>
Thus in a trice I work my transformation.<br/>
His wig and nose removed, the beak appears<br/>
A simple officer of Volunteers,<br/>
Who to himself restored, and sick of mumming,<br/>
Begs leave to thank you each and all for coming,<br/>
Spite of cross roads, dark lanes, tenacious clay,<br/>
And benches not too soft, to hear our play.<br/>
Next, to those friends my warmest thanks are due<br/>
Who give their aid to-night, but chief to you<br/>
Who for my sake, and only for to-day,<br/>
O’ercome your natural shyness of display.<br/>
Now comes the hardest portion of my task,<br/>
A most momentous question ’tis to ask.<br/>
I pause for your reply with bated breath—<br/>
I humbly hope you’ve not been bored to death?<br/>
Thanks for the signal which success assures;<br/>
Welcome to all, but most to amateurs.<br/>
Thanks, gentle friends, your welcome cheers proclaim<br/>
We have not altogether missed our aim.<br/>
Not ours your hearts to thrill, your tears to move,<br/>
With Hamlet’s madness, Desdemona’s love.<br/>
We dare not bid in high heroic strain<br/>
Wolsey or Richelieu rise and breathe again.<br/>
We walk in humbler paths, and cannot hope<br/>
(To quote the spirit-stirring verse of Pope)<br/>
‘To wake the soul with tender strokes of Art,<br/>
To raise the genius and to mend the heart;<br/>
To make mankind in conscious virtue bold,<br/>
Live o’er each scene and be what they behold.’<br/>
No—with deep reverence for these nobler views,<br/>
We seek not to instruct you, but amuse;<br/>
To make you wiser, better, we don’t claim—<br/>
To make you laugh, our only end and aim.<br/>
And as the test of everything, men say,<br/>
Is just this simple question—does it pay?<br/>
Well, then (I speak for self and comrades present),<br/>
This acting pays us well; we find it pleasant.<br/>
If at the same time it amuses you,<br/>
We reap a double gain vouchsafed to few,<br/>
To please ourselves and please our neighbours too.<br/>
Besides, to-night in more material sense,<br/>
It pays us well in shillings, pounds, and pence.<br/>
Your dollars flush our regimental till,<br/>
But in more sterling coin we’re richer still:<br/>
Yes, doubly, trebly, rich in your goodwill.<br/>
And so farewell! but stop, before we part,<br/>
We’ll sing one song and sing it from the heart.<br/>
Just one song more: you guess the song I mean:<br/>
Our brave time-honoured hymn, ‘God save the Queen.’"

<p>He continued also to act as mentor to his younger brothers, two
of whom went in due course to Cambridge, and, to his great delight,
pulled in their college racing boat (Trinity Hall), which was
then at the head of the river. He often visited them at Cambridge,
and, whenever he could manage it, would spend some part of the
vacation with them, joining them in all their amusements, and
helping them in their studies. You may judge of the sort of terms
they were on, by this extract from a letter to his mother in August
1856:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"We shall be very happy to join you in Scotland. I want to<br/>
know whether <em>good</em> fishing tackle is procurable at Stirling,<br/>
or in the neighbourhood of Callender. At Edinbro’ and Glasgow<br/>
I know it can be obtained, and much cheaper than in London.<br/>
Perhaps Harry can inform me, if he is not too much occupied in<br/>
discovering the value of χ, which I believe is the great object<br/>
of mathematics (I speak it not profanely). Tell Harry and<br/>
Arthur I expect to find them both without breeches.

</p>
<p>
‘Those swelling calves were never meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To shun the public eye,’

</p>
<p>
as Dr. Watts remarks, or would have remarked if he had written<br/>
on the subject."

</p>
</div>
<p>Such occupations as these, with magistrate’s work, and field
sports taken in moderation, served to fill up his time, and would
have satisfied most men situated as he was. But he could never
in all these years get the notion quite out of his head (though
it wore off later) that he was not doing his fair share of work
in the world, and was a useless kind of personage, for whom no
one was much the better but his wife and children, and whom nobody
but they would miss. This feeling showed itself in his immense
respect for those who were working in regular professions, and
in the most conscientious scrupulousness about taking up their
time. Often he has come to my chambers, and, after hurrying through
some piece of family business, has insisted on going away directly,
though I might not have seen him for a month, and was eager to
talk on fifty subjects. The sight of open papers was enough for
him; and he had not practised long enough to get the familiarity
which breeds contempt, and to know how gladly the busiest lawyer
puts aside an Abstract, or Interrogatories in Chancery, for the
chance of a pleasant half-hour’s gossip.</p>

<p>I think, however, that I can show you clearly enough, in a very
few words, what his real work in the world was during these years,
and how perfectly unconscious he was that he was doing it faithfully.
In 1857, your grandfather had a dangerous attack of illness, from
which he never recovered. George was with him and nursed him during
the crisis. As soon as he was well enough to use a pen, he wrote
as follows to Lady Salusbury:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Amongst other things it occurs to me how much I have had to<br/>
thank God for through life, and how my family have always drawn<br/>
together in the way I wished them. And here I should be doing<br/>
injustice to George, if I did not in my own mind trace much<br/>
of this happy result to his quiet and imperceptible influence<br/>
as an elder brother, in many ways of which my wife and I were<br/>
not exactly cognizant at the time. Perhaps I am thinking<br/>
more about him just now as he was in his natural place as my<br/>
right-hand man when I was taken unwell; and when I say truly,<br/>
that neither his mother or I ever had even an unkind word or<br/>
disrespectful look from him since he was born, and that his<br/>
constant study through life, as far as we are concerned, has<br/>
been to spare us rather than give us trouble, and throw his<br/>
own personal interests over much more than we chose to allow<br/>
him, it is especially for the purpose of giving dear A—— (her<br/>
adopted daughter) a precedent to quote with her own lips in<br/>
the training of her own boys which I know will be particularly<br/>
acceptable to herself. It is the last theme on which he would<br/>
like to expatiate, but that such was my deliberate and true<br/>
opinion, will be, I doubt not, one of these days, a source of<br/>
satisfaction to them both, and to the children."

</p>
</div>
<p>Your grandfather died shortly afterwards, and a year later George
wrote to his mother:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I feel that we have great cause for gratitude and rejoicing<br/>
<em>as a family</em>; I mean for the way in which we hang together,<br/>
and the utter absence of any subject of discord or disagreement<br/>
between any of our members. I think we may well be happy, even<br/>
while thinking of what happened this time last year, as I have<br/>
done very frequently of late."

</p>
</div>
<p>He would have been impatient, almost angry, if anyone had told
him that the "hanging together," at which he rejoiced, was mainly
his own doing.</p>

<p>In the village, too, he was beginning to find occupation of the
most useful kind. Thus he opened a village reading-room for the
labourers, which was furnished with books and papers, and lighted
and warmed, every evening from seven to nine. "Hitherto it is
a great success," he writes in 1868: "we have fifty members who
subscribe 2_d.<em> a week, and we give them a cup of coffee and
a biscuit for 1_d.</em> Some of them drink five or six cups a
night. Whether coffee will continue to beat beer I don’t know,
but at present it keeps them from the public-house, and saves
their wages for their wives. Some of them are very fond of reading,
and the rest play draughts and dominoes." Then there were frequent
"laundry entertainments,"—penny readings, or theatrical performances
in the big laundry,—of which his sister writes: "The boys and
Mr. Phillips and I used to make the music, but the great hits
of the evening were always George’s. He used to recite ‘The One-horse
Chay,’ or some Ingoldsby Legend, or ‘The Old Woman of Berkeley,’
or sing a comic song, and the people liked his performances better
than anything. Like all very reserved people, he acted wonderfully
well, and always knew how every part should be done, so he used
to coach us all when a play was being got up. But he would never
criticise unless asked: he always thought that people knew as
well as he did how to do their parts, but they did not. He was
always so droll on these occasions. When a performance was proposed
by the boys, he used to say it was too much trouble, and that
he wanted to be left quiet. But they always got their way, and
when it was inevitable he would learn his entire part while we
others were mastering a page. I was always whip, because I could
not stand doing anything by halves, and used to drive everyone
mercilessly till the scenes began to go smoothly. He would sometimes
rehearse his part almost under his breath, gabbling it off with
the book in his hand, and then I would remonstrate, and he would
go through it splendidly, as well as on the day of performance."</p>

<p>But the reform which he had most at heart he never lived to carry
out. The industry of straw-plaiting, which prevails in the neighbourhood,
while it enables the women and girls to earn high wages, makes
them bad housewives, all their cooking and cleaning being neglected,
while they run in and out of neighbours’ houses, gossiping and
plaiting. In the hope of curing this evil he looked forward to
fitting up a large barn in the village as a sort of general meeting-place.
Here, when he had made the roof air-tight, and laid down a good
floor, there was to be a stove for cooking and baking, and appliances
for instruction in other household work. Under his wife and sister
there were to be "cooking classes, sewing classes, and singing
classes; and, in the evenings, entertainments for the poor people,
a piano and night classes, sometimes theatricals, and often concerts,
and when the boys wanted to dance they were to have their dances
there. He used to think that constant meetings in the barn would
humanize us all, and be a very pleasant thing for making rich
and poor meet on equal terms." It is perhaps vain to dwell upon
such things, but I cannot help hoping that some day those of you
who have the opportunity of realizing such plans may remember
to what purposes the big barn was once destined. Of one other
part of his village work, his Sunday evening classes for the big
boys, I shall have to speak presently.</p>

<p>But you must not suppose from anything in this chapter that he
ever lost his interest in politics, or public affairs. He was
always a keen politician, retaining, however, all his early beliefs.
"You have all got far beyond me," he writes to his sister; "and
my dear mother turning Radical in her old age is delightful."
Perhaps the most ardent politician amongst us all is the best
witness to call on this subject. "I don’t think anything was more
remarkable about George than his politics. He, who was so good
an old Tory in many ways, showed that he believed in a universal
principle and duty underlying all the political opinions about
the best means of carrying out reforms. I think it is very rare,
when people are discussing politics, to find this constant recognition
of something beyond party nostrums. But (as in his father) I have
always detected it in George; and, when I have got very hot whilst
propounding Radicalism against all the rest here, have always
found sympathy from him at the bottom; and I have always felt
at last how much more truly liberal he was at heart than we Radicals,
because we are always wanting to force on our opinions our own
way, whilst in him I always recognized a divine sort of justice
and patience, which used to make me feel very conceited, and wanting
in faith. He was born with aristocratic instincts, being by nature
intensely sensitive and refined, with a loathing of anything blatant
and in bad taste, and with an intense love of justice; and the
unwise, violent, foolish way in which many men like —— expound
their doctrines disgusted him beyond measure, though he would
always recognize the real truth that lay at the bottom of Radicalism."</p>

<p>But he shall speak for himself on one great event, which you
are all old enough to remember, the late war between France and
Germany. Almost the first incident of the war—the despatch of
the then Emperor, speaking of the Prince Imperial’s "baptism of
fire"—roused his indignation so strongly that it found vent in
the following lines:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

"<em>OFFLEY, <em>1871</em></em>.

"I think that the high and mighty tone assumed by Herr Gustave<br/>
Solling (German superhuman excellence, Handel, Beethoven,<br/>
Minnesingers, &amp;c.) the worst possible vehicle for the defence<br/>
of the German terms of peace. When a man talks ‘buncombe,’ it<br/>
shows that he has an uneasy feeling that his case is a weak<br/>
one. The cynical line is the right one for the Germans; why not<br/>
say, in the words of Wordsworth,—

</p>
<p>
‘And why? Because the good old rule<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sufficeth them; the simple plan,<br/>
That they should take who have the power,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they should keep who can.’

</p>
<p>
But pray don’t say this to our cousin, and thank her for her<br/>
translation. You know what I think about the matter; I would<br/>
have gone to war with the French to stop the war; and I would<br/>
have gone to war with the Germans to stop the peace. There’s an<br/>
Irish view of it, from a sincere war-hater."

</p>
</div>
<p>The person who knew him best once wrote of your grandfather’s
politics: "Men of all parties speak of him as belonging to their
clique. This proves to me, if I had required the proof to strengthen
the conviction, that there is a point on the plain of politics
at which the moderate Tory, the sensible Whig, and the right-minded
Radical, in other words all true patriots, meet; like the vanishing
point in a picture to which all true and correct lines tend. And
thus it is with him: he has reached that point, and there he foregathers
with all of all parties, who, throwing aside party prejudice,
act and think for the good of their fellow-creatures."</p>

<p>The description, I cannot but think, applied equally well to
my brother, though he continued nominally a Tory to the end, and,
as you will all recollect, lived as quiet, methodical a country
life as if he had no interests in the world beyond crops, field
sports, and petty sessions. But that it must have required a considerable
effort on his part to do this comes out in much of his most intimate
correspondence. For instance, only a month or two before his death
he writes to his sister:—"Thanks, many, for your letter, and Mrs.
S——’s. Hers is delightful, and I so fully understand her feeling.
I always feel uncomfortable in point-device places, where the
footman is always brushing your hat, and will insist upon putting
out your clothes, and turning your socks ready to put on, and,
if you say half a word, will even put them on for you. How I hate
being ‘valeted!’ I should like to black my own boots, like Mr.
——, but then he is (or was) a master of foxhounds, and, being
of course on that account a king of men, can do as he pleases,
in spite of Mrs. Grundy. I am also a gypsey (is that rightly spelt?
That word, and some others, are stumbling-blocks to me; I am afraid
all my spelling is an affair of memory), a Bohemian at heart.
I sometimes feel an almost irresistible desire to doff my breeches
and paint myself blue. I should also like (I would limit myself
to one month per annum) to go with a carpet-bag to the nearest
station, and to rough it in all sorts of outlandish places—but
then A—— can’t rough it, and there are the brats, and lots of
other impediments. The very act of wandering anywhere delights
me. I think we spoil half the enjoyment of life by being too particular;
how terrible dinner-parties are becoming! But enough of my sermon.
In spite of my secret longings I shall continue to do as my neighbours,
and it would be wicked in my case to be discontented. They threatened
to nominate me Chairman of the Board of Guardians here, but finding
that the Vice-chairman was standing (and thinking him better qualified),
I declined any contest, and was not put up. I am sorry for it,
for the office, although troublesome, is capable of being made
useful, and I think I should have liked it in time;" and then
comes a sentence which may serve to explain to some of you your
feelings towards him—"I cannot forgive —— for putting ——" (one
of his nephews) "on a bolting horse. If you do mount a boy, you
ought to give him the cleverest and quietest horse in your stable,
and no sportsman would do otherwise."</p>

<p>There is one more trait in his character which I must not omit
here, as I wish to give you as perfect a knowledge of him as I
have myself. I have already told you how very scrupulous he was
with regard to money matters. He had, indeed, a horror of debt
which made him morbidly sensitive on the subject; and he recognized
the fact, and treated himself for it as he would have done for
a fit of bile, or any other physical disorder. On more than one
occasion, when some unlooked for expenditure seemed likely to
bring on a more than usually severe attack, he cured himself by
some piece of unwonted extravagance, such as buying a diamond
ornament for his wife, or making a handsome present to some poor
relation. The remedy answered perfectly in his case; but I am
bound to add that it is one which I cannot recommend as a specific
without the warning, that, before using it, you-must satisfy yourselves,
as he always did, that there were no reasonable grounds for uneasiness.</p>

<p>But if he sometimes worried himself about money, he kept his
anxiety to himself, and was constantly doing the most liberal
acts in the most thoughtful manner. Of the many instances I could
give of this, I select one, which an old friend has communicated
to me with permission to mention it. I give it in his own words:—"There
is one little incident connected with his personal relations to
me which I shall always remember with feelings of gratitude and
pleasure. When the Suez Canal was opened I had an offer of a free
passage out and home in a P. and O. steamer, and I was rather
exercised in my mind by not feeling it prudent to accept, as I
knew that living in Egypt for a fortnight at that time would be
very expensive, and I knew that I could not afford it. I happened
to be writing to him about that time, and mentioned this in my
letter. By return of post he sent me a cheque for £50, begging
me to accept it as a loan, to be paid when I had as much to spare,
or never if I preferred it. I did not take advantage of his generous
kindness, and I declare I almost regret now that I did not, as
I believe I should have given him sincere pleasure in so doing."</p>
