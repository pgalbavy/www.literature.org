<p>The aim of the warrior was better than before, and though it
was not fatal, it came startlingly near being so. The bullet nipped
the ear of the pony, and cut through the coat of Warren Starr;
grazing his shoulder in the passage.</p>

<p>There could be no question that the red man was in dead earnest,
and that when he discharged his rifle he meant to kill.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed there was any holding back on the part
of the youth; he was equally resolved that, if the chance were
given, he would do his best to bring his antagonist from the back
of his horse.</p>

<p>The Sioux resumed his circling course, gradually drawing nearer
the young man, who continued as alert as at the first; ready to
take advantage of any opening that presented itself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the red man wheeled his pony in the opposite direction,
doubling on his own course. This compelled him to swing over to
the other side in order to continue his use of the animal as a
shield. He executed the movement with wonderful deftness, but
a singular condition was against him.</p>

<p>Young Starr had just formed the decision that the best, if indeed
not the only thing he could do, was to shoot the steed of his
foe. This was easy, and with the Indian dismounted he would be
at a great disadvantage, though likely still to use the body of
his animal as a guard against the marksmanship of his enemy; but
the latter counted on the flurry giving him his opportunity.</p>

<p>Thus it happened that at the moment the Winchester was at Warren's
shoulder, and his eye was ranging along the barrel, he caught
a glimpse of the dusky body in the act of whisking over that of
the pony. The glimpse was only momentary, but under the peculiar
conditions it was just what was needed. The youth fired, and with
such accuracy that the warrior lunged over his steed, and sprawled
in the snow on the other side.</p>

<p>The released animal threw up his head with a snort, and trotted
toward the ridge as if he, too, had felt the sting of the bullet
and was hastening away from a possible repetition.</p>

<p>The sight of the Indian on the ground told the youth of the success
of his shot, but it did not lead him to do anything rash, as would
have been natural in the flush of triumph. The Sioux was not yet
killed, and was still capable of mischief.</p>

<p>Warren rode rapidly a few yards toward him, and then brought
Jack to an abrupt halt. He had seen something suspicious in the
actions of his enemy.</p>

<p>"Is he shamming?" was the question he asked himself, as he leaned
forward, carefully keeping the head and neck of Jack in front
of his body, and on the alert against a treacherous shot.</p>

<p>The Sioux seemed to have fallen on his side, with his face turned
partly away from the youth. With surprising quickness he shifted
his position so as to confront the horseman, and still lay prostrate
in the snow, as if unable to rise.</p>

<p>There might be a sinister meaning to this. The pretence of being
mortally disabled was an old one with his people, as many a white
man has learned when too late. If he were trying the artifice
in the present instance, he did it skilfully.</p>

<p>Under the belief that he was powerless to inflict further harm,
nothing was more natural than that the youth should ride forward
with the purpose of giving him his quietus, disregarding his own
safety until a bullet through the body should apprise him of his
fatal oversight. It was this fear that checked Warren in the very
nick of time.</p>

<p>The one great obstacle in the way of the Sioux successfully playing
this ruse was that he was in open view, where no movement on his
part could be concealed. Were it in the wood, with rocks and trees
at his command, the chances would have been far better for him.</p>

<p>Warren Starr kept his eye fixed on him. It would have been easy,
while seated on his own pony, to drive a ball through the miscreant,
who was fully exposed to his fire, but it might be after all that
he was badly wounded and unable to defend himself. If such were
the case he could not commit the cruelty of firing at him again,
even though the Sioux would have eagerly seized such a chance
against a foe.</p>

<p>It was for the purpose of learning the truth in the matter that
Warren watched him with the utmost closeness, holding his own
weapon ready to use the instant the other made a hostile demonstration.</p>

<p>The action or rather inaction of the other Sioux at the base
of the ridge was suggestive, and increased the suspicion of the
young rancher. They were in a direct line with the one on the
ground, so that Warren readily saw them without withdrawing his
attention from his immediate antagonist.</p>

<p>Instead of rushing out to the help of the latter they remained
where they were, and continued the role of spectators. This looked
as if they did not believe the fellow was in need of assistance,
and they were simply waiting with confidence in the result of
the piece of treacherous cunning.</p>

<p>The warrior with his left hand drew his rifle round to the front.
The weapon was a magazine one like Warren's, and it was one, therefore,
of which it would not do to lose sight.</p>

<p>The gun being in position for use, the owner, apparently with
difficulty, raised the upper part of his body, so that it was
supported on the left elbow. Then he essayed to call the right
hand into play, but appeared to find a difficulty in doing so.</p>

<p>Up to this moment Warren Starr had been trying to learn in what
manner the fellow was wounded. The motion of his lower limbs showed
no weakness, though it might have been there without appearing,
so long as he held his prone position and did not call them into
use.</p>

<p>The action now indicated that his right arm was the one that
had suffered, since it fumbled awkwardly and refused to give the
needed help when called upon.</p>

<p>Still all this might be pretence, intended to deceive the youth
into uncovering himself. Warren did not lose sight of that probability.</p>

<p>The action of the Sioux was precisely what it would have been
had he, knowing that he was confronted by a merciless enemy, done
his utmost, while badly wounded in the right arm, to bring his
weapon to bear upon him. There was no hesitation or trouble with
the left arm, but it was the other which, from appearances, refused
to answer the call upon it.</p>

<p>It was seen to move aimlessly about, but still was unable to
help in aiming, and the hand could not manipulate the trigger&mdash;an
impotence which, if actual, was fatal.</p>

<p>But who can trust an Indian? Knowing that his slightest action
could not escape the keen eyes of the youthful horseman a short
distance away, was he not likely to direct every movement with
the purpose of deceiving him?</p>

<p>The truth must show itself soon; but be it what it might, Warren
Starr had the comforting belief that he was master of the situation.
He was unharmed, with his ready Winchester in such position that
he could use it like a flash. As yet the Sioux had not brought
himself to the point of aiming, and Warren was watching him so
closely that he could anticipate his firing. He was resolved that
the instant he attempted to shoot he would let fly, and end the
singular prairie duel.</p>

<p>It has taken considerable time to make all this clear, but the
incidents from the fall of the Sioux to the close occupied but
a few minutes.</p>

<p>Young Starr spoke in a low voice to his pony, who began moving
slowly toward the prostrate Indian, the rider holding his weapon
ready as before. Jack took short and very deliberate steps, for
he did not like the appearance of things. A man lying on the ground
is always a disquieting object to a horse, and this one had already
felt the sting of the Indian's anger when the bullet clipped a
tiny speck out of his ear. Warren Starr was resolved to learn
the truth, and he did so before Jack had advanced a dozen steps.</p>
