<p>When the rancher entered the current with the two ponies, the
interest of the wife, who remained behind with little Dot, was
centred wholly in his effort to ford the stream. She stood on
the very margin of the water, where, though unable to see the
form of the rider or either of the animals, she could hear the
sound made by them in passing through the current.</p>

<p>In this position, the pack-pony remained a few steps behind her
and about half-way to the open plain. The child, who had been
somewhat disturbed by the shifting about of herself, had fallen
asleep again and rested motionless in her arms, with her form
nestling in the protecting blanket.</p>

<p>Everything was silent except the slight noise caused by the animals
in the water. In this position, with her nerves strung to the
highest point, and her faculties absorbed in the single one of
hearing, she caught a suspicious sound immediately behind her.
It was as if Jerry was moving from the spot where he had been
left.</p>

<p>Fearful of his going astray, her lips parted to speak, when,
fortunately, she held her peace. It might be that some person
was the cause of his action.</p>

<p>With the purpose of learning the truth, she stole through the
timber toward the spot where he was standing a few minutes before.
She was so close behind him, and moved so much faster, that she
reached the open plain almost on his heels. Despite the gloom,
she could make out his figure; and her feelings may be imagined
when she distinguished the form of a Sioux warrior leading him.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the thief paused as soon as the open prairie
was reached and lightly vaulted upon his back, beside the load
already resting there. Then he hammered his heels against his
ribs and the lazy beast rose to a jogging trot, immediately disappearing
in the snow and darkness.</p>

<p>The wife, as may be supposed, was dumfounded and uncertain what
to do, if indeed she could do anything. At the moment when it
looked as if all danger was past, one of their enemies had unexpectedly
stolen their pack-pony.</p>

<p>Where were the rest? Why did they content themselves with this
simple act, when they might have done a thousandfold worse? How
soon would the rest be on the spot? Was there no hope now of escape
for the miserable fugitives?</p>

<p>These and similar thoughts were passing through her mind, when
she heard her husband calling to her in a cautious voice. Not
daring to reply, through fear of attracting the attention of their
enemies, she threaded her way through the timber, and reached
his side at the moment his heart was filled with despair at the
belief that something frightful had taken place.</p>

<p>The joy of the rancher, on clasping his beloved wife once more
in his arms, caused him to forget everything else for the moment,
but she quickly made known the startling incident that had occurred.</p>

<p>"Heavens!" he muttered, "they have traced us after all, but where
are the rest?"</p>

<p>"They must be near," she replied, laying her hand on his arm.
"Listen!"</p>

<p>They did so, but heard nothing more.</p>

<p>"We must cross at once," he whispered.</p>

<p>No time was lost in following the prudent suggestion. The wife
was helped upon the back of the mare, Dot still remaining asleep,
and the husband, mounted on Dick, placed himself in front.</p>

<p>"There is only one place, and that lasts but for a few steps,
where you will have to raise your foot to protect it from the
water," he said, as they were about to enter the stream.</p>

<p>"I will remember," she nervously replied; "don't wait."</p>

<p>Once again the faithful pony entered the water, the mare so close
behind that husband and wife could have touched each other, and
the fording of the current began.</p>

<p>The rancher did not forget that it was impossible in the darkness
to follow precisely his own course. Having emerged at a different
point from where he entered, he was in reality following a different
course, which might be the same as if it were a half mile farther
up or down stream.</p>

<p>This proved to be the case, though the disappointment was of
an agreeable nature, for the ponies struck a shallower part than
that which was first forded. At no portion did the water do more
than barely touch the bodies of the animals, and then only for
a few steps. Once the mare slipped on a smooth stone, and came
within a hair of unseating her rider, but the latter's skill enabled
her to retain her seat, and a few minutes later the two came out
on the other side, without a drop of moisture on their garments.</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven!" was the fervent ejaculation of the husband as
the fact was accomplished. "It is better than I expected."</p>

<p>"But don't forget that they may have done the same thing, and
perhaps are awaiting us near at hand."</p>

<p>"You may be right, Molly, and we cannot be too careful."</p>

<p>The words were barely uttered when the splashing of water behind
them left no doubt that the Sioux were again on their trail.</p>

<p>"Quick!" whispered the husband; "dismount; you can't ride the
mare among the trees; she will follow, and don't fail to keep
close behind Dick."</p>

<p>It was important, above all things, to leave the spot before
the red men landed. Otherwise, they would hear the horses and
locate them without difficulty.</p>

<p>A disappointment awaited our friends. It will be remembered that
the fringe of timber on the other side was quite narrow, and they
naturally supposed it corresponded on the farther shore. But after
threading their way for double the distance, they were surprised
to find no evidence of the open plain beyond.</p>

<p>The rancher dared not continue farther while there was reason
to fear their pursuers were near. The brushing of the branches
against the bodies of the animals and the noise of their hoofs
could be detected in the silence, and was sure to betray the fugitives
to any Sioux within a hundred yards.</p>

<p>The wife understood why the halt was made. Her husband stole
back and placed himself by her side.</p>

<p>"You must be wearied with carrying Dot so long," he said sympathizingly.</p>

<p>"It is quite a trial," she replied, in the same guarded voice,
"but there is no help for it, and I beg you to give the matter
no thought."</p>

<p>"Let me take her a while."</p>

<p>"No, that will not do; you must hold your gun ready for instant
use, and you could not do so with her in your arms. It is not
so hard when we are sitting on the mare, for it is easy to arrange
it so that she supports most of her weight."</p>

<p>"You are a good, brave woman, Molly, and deserve to be saved."</p>

<p>"Sh!" she admonished; "I hear something."</p>

<p>He knew she was right, for he caught the sound at the same moment.
Someone was stealing through the wood near them. It was a person,
beyond question, for a horse would have made more noise, and the
sounds of his hoofs would have been more distinct than anything
else. That which, fell upon their ears was the occasional crackling
of a twig, and the brushing aside of the obtruding limbs. No matter
with what care an Indian warrior threaded his way through the
timber in this dense gloom, he could not avoid such slight evidences
of his movements&mdash;so slight, indeed, that but for the oppressive
stillness and the strained hearing of the husband and wife they
would not have detected them.</p>

<p>Confident that the red man could not trace them in the gloom,
even though so dangerously near, the dread now was that the ponies
would betray them. Those watchful animals often prove the most
valuable allies of the fleeing fugitive, for they possess the
power of discovering impending danger before it can become known
to their masters. But when they make such discovery they are apt
to announce it by a stamp of the hoof or with a sniffing of the
nostrils, which, while serving the master well, has the disadvantage
also of apprising the enemy that his approach has become known.</p>

<p>Stealing from his position beside his wife, the rancher stepped
to the mare and passed his hand reassuringly over her mouth, doing
the same with his own pony. This action was meant as a command
for them to hold their peace, though whether it was understood
to the extent that it would be obeyed, remains to be seen.</p>
