<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>This was Miss Jane Baxter. She opened her eyes upon the new-born
day, and her first thoughts were of Mr. Parcher. That is, he was
already in her mind when she awoke, a circumstance to be accounted
for on the ground that his conversation, during her quiet convalescence
in his library, had so fascinated her that in all likelihood she
had been dreaming of him. Then, too, Jane and Mr. Parcher had
a bond in common, though Mr. Parcher did not know it. Not without
result had William repeated Miss Pratt's inquiry in Jane's hearing:
"Who IS that curious child?" Jane had preserved her sang-froid,
but the words remained with her, for she was one of those who
ponder and retain in silence.</p>

<p>She thought almost exclusively of Mr. Parcher until breakfast-time,
and resumed her thinking of him at intervals during the morning.
Then, in the afternoon, a series of quiet events not unconnected
with William's passion caused her to think of Mr. Parcher more
poignantly than ever; nor was her mind diverted to a different
channel by another confidential conversation with her mother.
Who can say, then, that it was not by design that she came face
to face with Mr. Parcher on the public highway at about five o'clock
that afternoon? Everything urges the belief that she deliberately
set herself in his path.</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher was walking home from his office, and he walked slowly,
gulping from time to time, as he thought of the inevitable evening
before him. His was not a rugged constitution, and for the last
fortnight or so he had feared that it was giving way altogether.
Each evening he felt that he was growing weaker, and sometimes
he thought piteously that he might go away for a while. He did
not much care where, though what appealed to him most, curiously
enough, was not the thought of the country, with the flowers and
little birds; no, what allured him was the idea that perhaps he
could find lodgment for a time in an Old People's Home, where
the minimum age for inmates was about eighty.</p>

<p>Walking more and more slowly, as he approached the dwelling he
had once thought of as home, he became aware of a little girl
in a checkered dress approaching him at a gait varied by the indifferent
behavior of a barrel-hoop which she was disciplining with a stick
held in her right hand. When the hoop behaved well, she came ahead
rapidly; when it affected to be intoxicated, which was most often
its whim, she zigzagged with it, and gained little ground. But
all the while, and without reference to what went on concerning
the hoop, she slowly and continuously fed herself (with her left
hand) small, solemnly relished bites of a slice of bread-and-butter
covered with apple sauce and powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher looked upon her, and he shivered slightly; for he
knew her to be Willie Baxter's sister.</p>

<p>Unaware of the emotion she produced in him, Jane checked her
hoop and halted.</p>

<p>"G'd afternoon, Mister Parcher," she said, gravely.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," he returned, without much spirit.</p>

<p>Jane looked up at him trustfully and with a strange, unconscious
fondness. "You goin' home now, Mr. Parcher?" she asked, turning
to walk at his side. She had suspended the hoop over her left
arm and transferred the bread-and-butter and apple sauce and sugar
to her right, so that she could eat even more conveniently than
before.</p>

<p>"I suppose so," he murmured.</p>

<p>"My brother Willie's been at your house all afternoon," she remarked.</p>

<p>He repeated, "I suppose so," but in a tone which combined the
vocal tokens of misery and of hopeless animosity.</p>

<p>"He just went home," said Jane. "I was 'cross the street from
your house, but I guess he didn't see me. He kept lookin' back
at your house. Miss Pratt was on the porch."</p>

<p>"I suppose so." This time it was a moan.</p>

<p>Jane proceeded to give him some information. "My brother Willie
isn't comin' back to your house to-night, but he doesn't know
it yet."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Mr. Parcher.</p>

<p>"Willie isn't goin' to spend any more evenings at your house
at all,"  said Jane, thoughtfully. "He isn't, but he doesn't know
it yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher gazed fixedly at the wonderful child, and something
like a ray of sunshine flickered over his seamed and harried face.
"Are you <em>SURE </em>he isn't?" he said. "What makes you think
so?"</p>

<p>"I know he isn't," said demure Jane. "It's on account of somep'm
I told mamma."</p>

<p>And upon this a gentle glow began to radiate throughout Mr. Parcher.
A new feeling budded within his bosom; he was warmly attracted
to Jane. She was evidently a child to be cherished, and particularly
to be encouraged in the line of conduct she seemed to have adopted.
He wished the Bullitt and Watson families each had a little girl
like this. Still, if what she said of William proved true, much
had been gained and life might be tolerable, after all.</p>

<p>"He'll come in the afternoons, I guess," said Jane. "But you
aren't home then, Mr. Parcher, except late like you were that
day of the Sunday-school class. It was on account of what you
said that day. I told mamma."</p>

<p>"Told your mamma what?"</p>

<p>"What you said."</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher's perplexity continued. "What about?"</p>

<p>"About Willie. <em>YOU </em>know!" Jane smiled fraternally.</p>

<p>"No, I don't."</p>

<p>"It was when I was layin' in the liberry, that day of the Sunday-school
class," Jane told him. "You an' Mrs. Parcher was talkin' in there
about Miss Pratt an' Willie an' everything."</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" Mr. Parcher, summoning his memory, had placed
the occasion and Jane together. "Did you <em>HEAR </em>all that?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Jane nodded. "I told mamma all what you said."</p>

<p>"Murder!"</p>

<p>"Well," said Jane, "I guess it's good I did, because look&mdash;that's
the very reason mamma did somep'm so's he can't come any more
except in daytime. I guess she thought Willie oughtn't to behave
so's't you said so many things about him like that; so to-day
she did somep'm, an' now he can't come any more to behave that
loving way of Miss Pratt that you said you would be in the lunatic
asylum if he didn't quit. But he hasn't found it out yet."</p>

<p>"Found what out, please?" asked Mr. Parcher, feeling more affection
for Jane every moment.</p>

<p>"He hasn't found out he can't come back to your house to-night;
an' he can't come back to-morrow night, nor day-after-to-morrow
night, nor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is it because your mamma is going to tell him he can't?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Parcher. Mamma says he's too old&mdash;an' she said she didn't
like to, anyway. She just <em>DID </em>somep'm."</p>

<p>"What? What did she do?"</p>

<p>"It's a secret," said Jane. "I could tell you the first part
of it&mdash;up to where the secret begins, I expect."</p>

<p>"Do!" Mr. Parcher urged.</p>

<p>"Well, it's about somep'm Willie's been <em>WEARIN'," </em>Jane
began, moving closer to him as they slowly walked onward. "I can't
tell you what they were, because that's the secret&mdash;but he had
'em on him every evening when he came to see Miss Pratt, but they
belong to papa, an' papa doesn't know a word about it. Well, one
evening papa wanted to put 'em on, because he had a right to,
Mr. Parcher, an' Willie didn't have any right to at all, but mamma
couldn't find 'em; an' she rummidged an' rummidged 'most all next
day an' pretty near every day since then an' never did find 'em,
until don't you believe I saw Willie inside of 'em only last night!
He was startin' over to your house to see Miss Pratt in 'em! So
I told mamma, an' she said it 'd haf to be a secret, so that's
why I can't tell you what they were. Well, an' then this afternoon,
early, I was with her, an' she said, long as I had told her the
secret in the first place, I could come in Willie's room with
her, an' we both were already in there anyway, 'cause I was kind
of thinkin' maybe she'd go in there to look for 'em, Mr. Parcher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I see," he said, admiringly. "I see."</p>

<p>"Well, they were under Willie's window-seat, all folded up; an'
mamma said she wondered what she better do, an' she was worried
because she didn't like to have Willie behave so's you an' Mrs.
Parcher thought that way about him. So she said the&mdash;the secret&mdash;what
Willie wears, you know, but they're really papa's an' aren't Willie's
any more'n they're <em>MINE&mdash;</em>well, she said the secret was
gettin' a little teeny bit too tight for papa, but she guessed
they &mdash;I mean the secret&mdash;she said she guessed it was already
pretty loose for Willie; so she wrapped it up, an' I went with
her, an' we took 'em to a tailor, an' she told him to make 'em
bigger, for a surprise for papa, 'cause then they'll fit him again,
Mr. Parcher. She said he must make 'em a whole lot bigger. She
said he must let 'em way, <em>WAY </em>out! So I guess Willie
would look too funny in 'em after they're fixed; an' anyway, Mr.
Parcher, the secret won't be home from the tailor's for two weeks,
an' maybe by that time Miss Pratt'll be gone."</p>

<p>They had reached Mr. Parcher's gate; he halted and looked down
fondly upon this child who seemed to have read his soul. "Do you
honestly think so?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, Mr. Parcher," said Jane, "mamma said&mdash;well, she
said she's sure Willie wouldn't come here in the evening any more
when <em>YOU'</em>re at home, Mr. Parcher&mdash;'cause after he'd been
wearin' the secret every night this way he wouldn't like to come
and not have the secret on. Mamma said the reason he would feel
like that was because he was seventeen years old. An' she isn't
goin' to tell him anything about it, Mr. Parcher. She said that's
the best way."</p>

<p>Her new friend nodded and seemed to agree. "I suppose that's
what you meant when you said he wasn't coming back but didn't
know it yet?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Parcher."</p>

<p>He rested an elbow upon the gate-post, gazing down with ever-increasing
esteem. "Of course I know your last name," he said, "but I'm afraid
I've forgotten your other one."</p>

<p>"It's Jane."</p>

<p>"Jane," said Mr. Parcher, "I should like to do something for
you."</p>

<p>Jane looked down, and with eyes modestly lowered she swallowed
the last fragment of the bread-and-butter and apple sauce and
sugar which had been the constantly evanescent companion of their
little walk together. She was not mercenary; she had sought no
reward.</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I must run home," she said. And with one lift
of her eyes to his and a shy laugh&mdash;laughter being a rare thing
for Jane&mdash;she scampered quickly to the corner and was gone.</p>

<p>But though she cared for no reward, the extraordinary restlessness
of William, that evening, after dinner, must at least have been
of great interest to her. He ascended to his own room directly
from the table, but about twenty minutes later came down to the
library, where Jane was sitting (her privilege until half after
seven) with her father and mother. William looked from one to
the other of his parents and seemed about to speak, but did not
do so. Instead, he departed for the upper floor again and presently
could be heard moving about energetically in various parts of
the house, a remote thump finally indicating that he was doing
something with a trunk in the attic.</p>

<p>After that he came down to the library again and once more seemed
about to speak, but did not. Then he went up-stairs again, and
came down again, and he was still repeating this process when
Jane's time-limit was reached and she repaired conscientiously
to her little bed. Her mother came to hear her prayers and to
turn out the light; and&mdash;when Mrs. Baxter had passed out into
the hall, after that, Jane heard her speaking to William, who
was now conducting what seemed to be excavations on a serious
scale in his own room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Willie, perhaps I didn't tell you, but&mdash;you remember I'd
been missing papa's evening clothes and looking everywhere for
days and days?"</p>

<p>"Ye&mdash;es," huskily from William.</p>

<p>"Well, I found them! And where do you suppose I'd put them? I
found them under your window-seat. Can you think of anything more
absurd than putting them there and then forgetting it? I took
them to the tailor's to have them let out. They were getting too
tight for papa, but they'll be all right for him when the tailor
sends them back."</p>

<p>What the stricken William gathered from this it is impossible
to state with accuracy; probably he mixed some perplexity with
his emotions. Certainly he was perplexed the following evening
at dinner.</p>

<p>Jane did not appear at the table. "Poor child! she's sick in
bed," Mrs. Baxter explained to her husband. "I was out, this afternoon,
and she ate nearly <em>ALL </em>of a five-pound box of candy."</p>

<p>Both the sad-eyed William and his father were dumfounded. "Where
on earth did she get a five-pound box of candy?" Mr. Baxter demanded.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Jane has begun her first affair," said Mrs. Baxter.
"A gentleman sent it to her."</p>

<p>"What gentleman?" gasped William.</p>

<p>And in his mother's eyes, as they slowly came to rest on his
in reply, he was aware of an inscrutability strongly remindful
of that inscrutable look of Jane's.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parcher," she said, gently.</p>
