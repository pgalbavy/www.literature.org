<p>Peter scarcely looked up from his breakfast.</p>

<p>"I’m willing, Dick," he said. "But you mustn’t ask me to be friends
with Stumm. He makes my stomach cold, that one."</p>

<p>For the first time he had stopped calling me "Cornelis". The
day of make-believe was over for all of us.</p>

<p>"Not to be friends with him," I said, "but to bust him and all
his kind."</p>

<p>"Then I’m ready," said Peter cheerfully. "What is it?"</p>

<p>I spread out the maps on the divan. There was no light in the
place but Blenkiron’s electric torch, for Hussin had put out the
lantern. Peter got his nose into the things at once, for his intelligence
work in the Boer War had made him handy with maps. It didn’t want
much telling from me to explain to him the importance of the one
I had looted.</p>

<p>"That news is worth many a million pounds," said he, wrinkling
his brows, and scratching delicately the tip of his left ear.
It was a way he had when he was startled.</p>

<p>"How can we get it to our friends?"</p>

<p>Peter cogitated. "There is but one way. A man must take it. Once,
I remember, when we fought the Matabele it was necessary to find
out whether the chief Makapan was living. Some said he had died,
others that he’d gone over the Portuguese border, but I believed
he lived. No native could tell us, and since his kraal was well
defended no runner could get through. So it was necessary to send
a man."</p>

<p>Peter lifted up his head and laughed. "The man found the chief
Makapan. He was very much alive, and made good shooting with a
shot-gun. But the man brought the chief Makapan out of his kraal
and handed him over to the Mounted Police. You remember Captain
Arcoll, Dick—Jim Arcoll? Well, Jim laughed so much that he broke
open a wound in his head, and had to have a doctor."</p>

<p>"You were that man, Peter," I said.</p>

<p>"<em>Ja</em>. I was the man. There are more ways of getting into
kraals than there are ways of keeping people out."</p>

<p>"Will you take this chance?"</p>

<p>"For certain, Dick. I am getting stiff with doing nothing, and
if I sit in houses much longer I shall grow old. A man bet me
five pounds on the ship that I could not get through a trench-line,
and if there had been a trench-line handy I would have taken him
on. I will be very happy, Dick, but I do not say I will succeed.
It is new country to me, and I will be hurried, and hurry makes
bad stalking."</p>

<p>I showed him what I thought the likeliest place—in the spurs
of the Palantuken mountains. Peter’s way of doing things was all
his own. He scraped earth and plaster out of a corner and sat
down to make a little model of the landscape on the table, following
the contours of the map. He did it extraordinarily neatly, for,
like all great hunters, he was as deft as a weaver bird. He puzzled
over it for a long time, and conned the map till he must have
got it by heart. Then he took his field-glasses—a very good single
Zeiss which was part of the spoils from Rasta’s motor-car—and
announced that he was going to follow my example and get on to
the house-top. Presently his legs disappeared through the trap,
and Blenkiron and I were left to our reflections.</p>

<p>Peter must have found something uncommon interesting, for he
stayed on the roof the better part of the day. It was a dull job
for us, since there was no light, and Blenkiron had not even the
consolation of a game of Patience. But for all that he was in
good spirits, for he had had no dyspepsia since we left Constantinople,
and announced that he believed he was at last getting even with
his darned duodenum. As for me I was pretty restless, for I could
not imagine what was detaining Sandy. It was clear that our presence
must have been kept secret from Hilda von Einem, for she was a
pal of Stumm’s, and he must by now have blown the gaff on Peter
and me. How long could this secrecy last, I asked myself. We had
now no sort of protection in the whole outfit. Rasta and the Turks
wanted our blood: so did Stumm and the Germans; and once the lady
found we were deceiving her she would want it most of all. Our
only hope was Sandy, and he gave no sign of his existence. I began
to fear that with him, too, things had miscarried.</p>

<p>And yet I wasn’t really depressed, only impatient. I could never
again get back to the beastly stagnation of that Constantinople
week. The guns kept me cheerful. There was the devil of a bombardment
all day, and the thought that our Allies were thundering there
half a dozen miles off gave me a perfectly groundless hope. If
they burst through the defence Hilda von Einem and her prophet
and all our enemies would be overwhelmed in the deluge. And that
blessed chance depended very much on old Peter, now brooding like
a pigeon on the house-tops.</p>

<p>It was not till the late afternoon that Hussin appeared again.
He took no notice of Peter’s absence, but lit a lantern and set
it on the table. Then he went to the door and waited. Presently
a light step fell on the stairs, and Hussin drew back to let someone
enter. He promptly departed and I heard the key turn in the lock
behind him.</p>

<p>Sandy stood there, but a new Sandy who made Blenkiron and me
jump to our feet. The pelts and skin-cap had gone, and he wore
instead a long linen tunic clasped at the waist by a broad girdle.
A strange green turban adorned his head, and as he pushed it back
I saw that his hair had been shaved. He looked like some acolyte—a
weary acolyte, for there was no spring in his walk or nerve in
his carriage. He dropped numbly on the divan and laid his head
in his hands. The lantern showed his haggard eyes with dark lines
beneath them.</p>

<p>"Good God, old man, have you been sick?" I cried.</p>

<p>"Not sick," he said hoarsely. "My body is right enough, but the
last few days I have been living in hell."</p>

<p>Blenkiron nodded sympathetically. That was how he himself would
have described the company of the lady.</p>

<p>I marched across to him and gripped both his wrists.</p>

<p>"Look at me," I said, "straight in the eyes."</p>

<p>His eyes were like a sleep-walker’s, unwinking, unseeing. "Great
heavens, man, you’ve been drugged!" I said.</p>

<p>"Drugged," he cried, with a weary laugh. "Yes, I have been drugged,
but not by any physic. No one has been doctoring my food. But
you can’t go through hell without getting your eyes red-hot."</p>

<p>I kept my grip on his wrists. "Take your time, old chap, and
tell us about it. Blenkiron and I are here, and old Peter’s on
the roof not far off. We’ll look after you."</p>

<p>"It does me good to hear your voice, Dick," he said. "It reminds
me of clean, honest things."</p>

<p>"They’ll come back, never fear. We’re at the last lap now. One
more spurt and it’s over. You’ve got to tell me what the new snag
is. Is it that woman?"</p>

<p>He shivered like a frightened colt. "Woman!" he cried. "Does
a woman drag a man through the nether-pit? She’s a she-devil.
Oh, it isn’t madness that’s wrong with her. She’s as sane as you
and as cool as Blenkiron. Her life is an infernal game of chess,
and she plays with souls for pawns. She is evil—evil—evil." And
once more he buried his head in his hands.</p>

<p>It was Blenkiron who brought sense into this hectic atmosphere.
His slow, beloved drawl was an antiseptic against nerves.</p>

<p>"Say, boy," he said, "I feel just like you about the lady. But
our job is not to investigate her character. Her Maker will do
that good and sure some day. We’ve got to figure how to circumvent
her, and for that you’ve got to tell us what exactly’s been occurring
since we parted company."</p>

<p>Sandy pulled himself together with a great effort.</p>

<p>"Greenmantle died that night I saw you. We buried him secretly
by her order in the garden of the villa. Then came the trouble
about his successor ... The four Ministers would be no party to
a swindle. They were honest men, and vowed that their task now
was to make a tomb for their master and pray for the rest of their
days at his shrine. They were as immovable as a granite hill and
she knew it.... Then they, too, died."</p>

<p>"Murdered?" I gasped.</p>

<p>"Murdered ... all four in one morning. I do not know how, but
I helped to bury them. Oh, she had Germans and Kurds to do her
foul work, but their hands were clean compared to hers. Pity me,
Dick, for I have seen honesty and virtue put to the shambles and
have abetted the deed when it was done. It will haunt me to my
dying day."</p>

<p>I did not stop to console him, for my mind was on fire with his
news.</p>

<p>"Then the prophet is gone, and the humbug is over," I cried.</p>

<p>"The prophet still lives. She has found a successor."</p>

<p>He stood up in his linen tunic.</p>

<p>"Why do I wear these clothes? Because I am Greenmantle. I am
the <em>Kaába-i-hurriyeh</em> for all Islam. In three days’ time
I will reveal myself to my people and wear on my breast the green
ephod of the prophet."</p>

<p>He broke off with an hysterical laugh. "Only you see, I won’t.
I will cut my throat first."</p>

<p>"Cheer up!" said Blenkiron soothingly. "We’ll find some prettier
way than that."</p>

<p>"There is no way," he said; "no way but death. We’re done for,
all of us. Hussin got you out of Stumm’s clutches, but you’re
in danger every moment. At the best you have three days, and then
you, too, will be dead."</p>

<p>I had no words to reply. This change in the bold and unshakeable
Sandy took my breath away.</p>

<p>"She made me her accomplice," he went on. "I should have killed
her on the graves of those innocent men. But instead I did all
she asked and joined in her game ... She was very candid, you
know ... She cares no more than Enver for the faith of Islam.
She can laugh at it. But she has her own dreams, and they consume
her as a saint is consumed by his devotion. She has told me them,
and if the day in the garden was hell, the days since have been
the innermost fires of Tophet. I think—it is horrible to say it—that
she has got some kind of crazy liking for me. When we have reclaimed
the East I am to be by her side when she rides on her milk-white
horse into Jerusalem ... And there have been moments—only moments,
I swear to God—when I have been fired myself by her madness ..."</p>

<p>Sandy’s figure seemed to shrink and his voice grew shrill and
wild. It was too much for Blenkiron. He indulged in a torrent
of blasphemy such as I believe had never before passed his lips.</p>

<p>"I’m blessed if I’ll listen to this God-darned stuff. It isn’t
delicate. You get busy, Major, and pump some sense into your afflicted
friend."</p>

<p>I was beginning to see what had happened. Sandy was a man of
genius—as much as anybody I ever struck—but he had the defects
of such high-strung, fanciful souls. He would take more than mortal
risks, and you couldn’t scare him by any ordinary terror. But
let his old conscience get cross-eyed, let him find himself in
some situation which in his eyes involved his honour, and he might
go stark crazy. The woman, who roused in me and Blenkiron only
hatred, could catch his imagination and stir in him—for the moment
only—an unwilling response. And then came bitter and morbid repentance,
and the last desperation.</p>

<p>It was no time to mince matters. "Sandy, you old fool," I cried,
"be thankful you have friends to keep you from playing the fool.
You saved my life at Loos, and I’m jolly well going to get you
through this show. I’m bossing the outfit now, and for all your
confounded prophetic manners, you’ve got to take your orders from
me. You aren’t going to reveal yourself to your people, and still
less are you going to cut your throat. Greenmantle will avenge
the murder of his ministers, and make that bedlamite woman sorry
she was born. We’re going to get clear away, and inside of a week
we’ll be having tea with the Grand Duke Nicholas."</p>

<p>I wasn’t bluffing. Puzzled as I was about ways and means I had
still the blind belief that we should win out. And as I spoke
two legs dangled through the trap and a dusty and blinking Peter
descended in our midst.</p>

<p>I took the maps from him and spread them on the table.</p>

<p>"First, you must know that we’ve had an almighty piece of luck.
Last night Hussin took us for a walk over the roofs of Erzerum,
and by the blessing of Providence I got into Stumm’s room, and
bagged his staff map ... Look there ... d’you see his notes? That’s
the danger-point of the whole defence. Once the Russians get that
fort, Kara Gubek, they’ve turned the main position. And it can
be got; Stumm knows it can; for these two adjacent hills are not
held ... It looks a mad enterprise on paper, but Stumm knows that
it is possible enough. The question is: Will the Russians guess
that? I say no, not unless someone tells them. Therefore, by hook
or by crook, we’ve got to get that information through to them."</p>

<p>Sandy’s interest in ordinary things was beginning to flicker
up again. He studied the map and began to measure distances.</p>

<p>"Peter’s going to have a try for it. He thinks there’s a sporting
chance of his getting through the lines. If he does—if he gets
this map to the Grand Duke’s staff—then Stumm’s goose is cooked.
In three days the Cossacks will be in the streets of Erzerum."</p>

<p>"What are the chances?" Sandy asked.</p>

<p>I glanced at Peter. "We’re hard-bitten fellows and can face the
truth. I think the chances against success are about five to one."</p>

<p>"Two to one," said Peter modestly. "Not worse than that. I don’t
think you’re fair to me, Dick, my old friend."</p>

<p>I looked at that lean, tight figure and the gentle, resolute
face, and I changed my mind. "I’m hanged if I think there are
any odds," I said. "With anybody else it would want a miracle,
but with Peter I believe the chances are level."</p>

<p>"Two to one," Peter persisted. "If it was evens I wouldn’t be
interested."</p>

<p>"Let me go," Sandy cried. "I talk the lingo, and can pass as
a Turk, and I’m a million times likelier to get through. For God’s
sake, Dick, let me go."</p>

<p>"Not you. You’re wanted here. If you disappear the whole show’s
busted too soon, and the three of us left behind will be strung
up before morning ... No, my son. You’re going to escape, but
it will be in company with Blenkiron and me. We’ve got to blow
the whole Greenmantle business so high that the bits of it will
never come to earth again ... First, tell me how many of your
fellows will stick by you? I mean the Companions."</p>

<p>"The whole half-dozen. They are very worried already about what
has happened. She made me sound them in her presence, and they
were quite ready to accept me as Greenmantle’s successor. But
they have their suspicions about what happened at the villa, and
they’ve no love for the woman ... They’d follow me through hell
if I bade them, but they would rather it was my own show."</p>

<p>"That’s all right," I cried. "It is the one thing I’ve been doubtful
about. Now observe this map. Erzerum isn’t invested by a long
chalk. The Russians are round it in a broad half-moon. That means
that all the west, south-west, and north-west is open and undefended
by trench lines. There are flanks far away to the north and south
in the hills which can be turned, and once we get round a flank
there’s nothing between us and our friends ... I’ve figured out
our road," and I traced it on the map. "If we can make that big
circuit to the west and get over that pass unobserved we’re bound
to strike a Russian column the next day. It’ll be a rough road,
but I fancy we’ve all ridden as bad in our time. But one thing
we must have, and that’s horses. Can we and your six ruffians
slip off in the darkness on the best beasts in this township?
If you can manage that, we’ll do the trick."</p>

<p>Sandy sat down and pondered. Thank heaven, he was thinking now
of action and not of his own conscience.</p>

<p>"It must be done," he said at last, "but it won’t be easy. Hussin’s
a great fellow, but as you know well, Dick, horses right up at
the battle-front are not easy to come by. Tomorrow I’ve got some
kind of infernal fast to observe, and the next day that woman
will be coaching me for my part. We’ll have to give Hussin time
... I wish to heaven it could be tonight." He was silent again
for a bit, and then he said: "I believe the best time would be
the third night, the eve of the Revelation. She’s bound to leave
me alone that night."</p>

<p>"Right-o," I said. "It won’t be much fun sitting waiting in this
cold sepulchre; but we must keep our heads and risk nothing by
being in a hurry. Besides, if Peter wins through, the Turk will
be a busy man by the day after tomorrow."</p>

<p>The key turned in the door and Hussin stole in like a shade.
It was the signal for Sandy to leave.</p>

<p>"You fellows have given me a new lease of life," he said. "I’ve
got a plan now, and I can set my teeth and stick it out."</p>

<p>He went up to Peter and gripped his hand. "Good luck. You’re
the bravest man I’ve ever met, and I’ve seen a few." Then he turned
abruptly and went out, followed by an exhortation from Blenkiron
to "Get busy about the quadrupeds."</p>

<p>Then we set about equipping Peter for his crusade. It was a simple
job, for we were not rich in properties. His get-up, with his
thick fur-collared greatcoat, was not unlike the ordinary Turkish
officer seen in a dim light. But Peter had no intention of passing
for a Turk, or indeed of giving anybody the chance of seeing him,
and he was more concerned to fit in with the landscape. So he
stripped off the greatcoat and pulled a grey sweater of mine over
his jacket, and put on his head a woollen helmet of the same colour.
He had no need of the map for he had long since got his route
by heart, and what was once fixed in that mind stuck like wax;
but I made him take Stumm’s plan and paper, hidden below his shirt.
The big difficulty, I saw, would be getting to the Russians without
getting shot, assuming he passed the Turkish trenches. He could
only hope that he would strike someone with a smattering of English
or German. Twice he ascended to the roof and came back cheerful,
for there was promise of wild weather.</p>

<p>Hussin brought in our supper, and Peter made up a parcel of food.
Blenkiron and I had both small flasks of brandy and I gave him
mine.</p>

<p>Then he held out his hand quite simply, like a good child who
is going off to bed. It was too much for Blenkiron. With large
tears rolling down his face he announced that, if we all came
through, he was going to fit him into the softest berth that money
could buy. I don’t think he was understood, for old Peter’s eyes
had now the faraway absorption of the hunter who has found game.
He was thinking only of his job.</p>

<p>Two legs and a pair of very shabby boots vanished through the
trap, and suddenly I felt utterly lonely and desperately sad.
The guns were beginning to roar again in the east, and in the
intervals came the whistle of the rising storm.</p>
