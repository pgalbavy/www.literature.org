<P>
Between four and five in the afternoon--when the women of the
Western regions are in their carriages, and the men are at their
clubs--London presents few places more conveniently adapted for
purposes of private talk than the solitary garden inclosure of a
square.
<P>
On the day when Richard Turlington paid his visit to Muswell
Hill, two ladies (with a secret between them) unlocked the gate
of the railed garden in Berkeley Square. They shut the gate after
entering the inclosure, but carefully forbore to lock it as well,
and carefully restricted their walk to the westward side of the
garden. One of them was Natalie Graybrooke. The other was Mrs.
Sancroft's eldest daughter. A certain temporary interest
attached, in the estimation of society, to this young lady. She
had sold well in the marriage market. In other words, she had
recently been raised to the position of Lord Winwood's second
wife; his lordship conferring on the bride not only the honors of
the peerage, but the additional distinction of being stepmother
to his three single daughters, all older than herself. In person,
Lady Winwood was little and fair. In character, she was dashing
and resolute--a complete contrast to Natalie, and (on that very
account) Natalie's bosom friend.
<P>
"My dear, one ambitious marriage in the family is quite enough! I
have made up my mind that _you_ shall marry the man you love.
Don't tell me your courage is failing you--the excuse is
contemptible; I decline to receive it. Natalie! the men have a
phrase which exactly describes your character. You want
back-bone!"
<P>
The bonnet of the lady who expressed herself in these peremptory
terms barely reached the height of Natalie's shoulder. Natalie
might have blown the little airy, light-haired, unsubstantial
creature over the railings of the garden if she had taken a good
long breath and stooped low enough. But who ever met with a tall
woman who had a will of her own? Natalie's languid brown eyes
looked softly down in submissive attention from an elevation of
five feet seven. Lady Winwood's brisk blue eyes looked brightly
up in despotic command from an elevation of four feet eleven (in
her shoes).
<P>
"You are trifling with Mr. Linzie, my dear. Mr. Linzie is a nice
fellow. I like him. I won't have that."
<P>
"Louisa!"
<P>
"Mr. Turlington has nothing to recommend him. He is not a
well-bred old gentleman of exalted rank. He is only an odious
brute who happens to have made money. You shall _not_ marry Mr.
Turlington. And you _shall_ marry Launcelot Linzie."
<P>
"Will you let me speak, Louisa?"
<P>
"I will let you answer--nothing more. Didn't you come crying to
me this morning? Didn't you say, 'Louisa, they have pronounced
sentence on me! I am to be married in the first week of the New
Year. Help me out of it, for Heaven's sake!' You said all that,
and more. And what did I do when I heard your story?"
<P>
"Oh, you were so kind--"
<P>
"Kind doesn't half express it. I have committed crimes on your
account. I have deceived my husband and my mother. For your sake
I got mamma to ask Mr. Linzie to lunch (as _my_ friend!). For
your sake I have banished my unoffending husband, not an hour
since, to his club. You wretched girl, who arranged a private
conference in the library? Who sent Mr. Linzie off to consult his
friend in the Temple on the law of clandestine marriage? Who
suggested your telegraphing home, and stopping here for the
night? Who made an appointment to meet your young man privately
in this detestable place in ten minutes' time? I did! I did! I
did! All in your interests. All to prevent you from doing what I
have done--marrying to please your family instead of to please
yourself. (I don't complain, mind, of Lord Winwood, or of his
daughters. _He_ is charming; his daughters I shall tame in course
of time. You are different. And Mr. Turlington, as I observed
before, is a brute.) Very well. Now what do you owe me on your
side? You owe it to me at least to know your own mind. You don't
know it. You coolly inform me that you daren't run the risk after
all, and that you  can't
 face the consequences on second thoughts. I'll tell you what!
You don't deserve that nice fellow, who worships the very ground
you tread on. You are a bread-and-butter miss. I don't believe
you are fond of him!"
<P>
"Not fond of him!" Natalie stopped, and clasped her hands in
despair of finding language strong enough for the occasion. At
the same moment the sound of a closing gate caught her ear. She
looked round. Launce had kept his appointment before his time.
Launce was in the garden, rapidly approaching them.
<P>
"Now for the Law of Clandestine Marriage!" said Lady Winwood.
"Mr. Linzie, we will take it sitting." She led the way to one of
the benches in the garden, and placed Launce between Natalie and
herself. "Well, Chief Conspirator, have you got the License? No?
Does it cost too much? Can I lend you the money?"
<P>
"It costs perjury, Lady Winwood, in my case," said Launce.
"Natalie is not of age. I can only get a License by taking my
oath that I marry her with her father's consent." He turned
piteously to Natalie. "I couldn't very well do that," he said, in
the tone of a man who feels bound to make an apology, "could I?"
Natalie shuddered; Lady Winwood shrugged her shoulders.
<P>
"In your place a woman wouldn't have hesitated," her ladyship
remarked. "But men are so selfish. Well! I suppose there is some
other way?"
<P>
"Yes, there is another way," said Launce. "But there is a horrid
condition attached to it--"
<P>
"Something worse than perjury, Mr. Linzie? Murder?"
<P>
"I'll tell you directly, Lady Winwood. The marriage comes first.
The condition follows. There is only one chance for us. We must
be married by banns."
<P>
"Banns!" cried Natalie. "Why, banns are publicly proclaimed in
church!"
<P>
"They needn't be proclaimed in _your_ church, you goose," said
Lady Winwood. "And, even if they were, nobody would be the wiser.
You may trust implicitly, my dear, in the elocution of an English
clergyman!"
<P>
"That's just what my friend said," cried Launce. "'Take a lodging
near a large parish church, in a remote part of London'-- (this
is my friend's advice)--'go to the clerk, tell him you want to be
married by banns, and say you belong to that parish. As for the
lady, in your place I should simplify it. I should say she
belonged to the parish too. Give an address, and have some one
there to answer questions. How is the clerk to know? He isn't
likely to be over-anxious about it--his fee is eighteen- pence.
The clerk makes his profit out of you, after you are married. The
same rule applies to the parson. He will have your names supplied
to him on a strip of paper, with dozens of other names; and he
will read them out all together in one inarticulate jumble in
church. You will stand at the altar when your time comes, with
Brown and Jones, Nokes and Styles, Jack and Gill. All that you
will have to do is, to take care that your young lady doesn't
fall to Jack, and you to Gill, by mistake--and there you are,
married by banns.' My friend's opinion, stated in his own words."
<P>
Natalie sighed, and wrung her hands in her lap. "We shall never
get through it," she said, despondingly.
<P>
Lady Winwood took a more cheerful view.
<P>
"I see nothing very formidable as yet, my dear. But we have still
to hear the end of it. You mentioned a condition just now, Mr.
Linzie.
<P>
"I am coming to the condition, Lady Winwood. You naturally
suppose, as I did, that I put Natalie into a cab, and run away
with her from the church door?"
<P>
"Certainly. And I throw an old shoe after you for luck, and go
home again."
<P>
Launce shook his head ominously.
<P>
"Natalie must go home again as well as you!"
<P>
Lady Winwood started. "Is that the condition you mentioned just
now?" she asked.
<P>
"That is the condition. I may marry her without anything serious
coming of it. But, if I run away with her afterward, and if you
are there, aiding and abetting me, we are guilty of Abduction,
and we may stand, side by side, at the bar of the Old Bailey to
answer for it!"
<P>
Natalie sprang to her feet in horror. Lady Winwood held up one
finger warningly, signing to her to let Launce go on.
<P>
"Natalie is not yet sixteen years old," Launce proceeded. "She
must go straight back to her father's house from the church, and
I must wait to run away with her till her next birthday. When
she's turned sixteen, she's ripe for elopement--not an hour
before. There is the law of Abduction! Despotism in a free
country--that's what I call it!"
<P>
Natalie sat down again, with an air of relief.
<P>
"It's a very comforting law, I think," she said. "It doesn't
force one to take the dreadful step of running away from home all
at once. It gives one time to consider, and plan, and make up
one's mind. I can tell you this, Launce, if I am to be persuaded
into marrying you, the law of Abduction is the only thing that
will induce me to do it. You ought to thank the law, instead of
abusing it."
<P>
Launce listened--without conviction.
<P>
"It's a pleasant prospect," he said, "to part at the church door,
and to treat my own wife on the footing of a young lady who is
engaged to marry another gentleman."
<P>
"Is it any pleasanter for _me_," retorted Natalie, "to have
Richard Turlington courting me, when I am all the time your wife?
I shall never be able to do it. I wish I was dead!"
<P>
"Come! come!" interposed Lady Winwood. "It's time to be serious.
Natalie's birthday, Mr. Linzie, is next Christmas-day. She will
be sixteen--"
<P>
"At seven in the morning," said Launce; "I got that out of Sir
Joseph. At one minute past seven, Greenwich mean time, we may be
off together. I got _that_ out of the lawyer."
<P>
"And it isn't an eternity to wait from now till Christmas-day.
You get that, by way of completing the list of your acquisitions,
out of _me_. In the mean time, can you, or can you not, manage to
meet the difficulties in the way of the marriage?"
<P>
"I have settled everything," Launce answered, confidently. "There
is not a single difficulty left."
<P>
He turned to Natalie, listening to him in amazement, and
explained himself. It had struck him that he might appeal--with
his purse in his hand, of course--to the interest felt in his
affairs by the late stewardess of the yacht. That excellent woman
had volunteered to do all that she could to help him. Her husband
had obtained situations for his wife and himself on board another
yacht--and they were both eager to assist in any conspiracy in
which their late merciless master was destined to play the part
of victim. When on shore, they lived in a populous London parish,
far away from the fashionable district of Berkeley Square, and
further yet from the respectable suburb of Muswell Hill. A room
in the house could be nominally engaged for Natalie, in the
assumed character of the stewardess's niece--the stewardess
undertaking to answer any purely formal questions which might be
put by the church authorities, and to be present at the marriage
ceremony. As for Launce, he would actually, as well as nominally,
live in the district close by; and the steward, if needful, would
answer for _him_. Natalie might call at her parochial residence
occasionally, under the wing of Lady Winwood; gaining leave of
absence from Muswell Hill, on the plea of paying one of her
customary visits at her aunt's house. The conspiracy, in brief,
was arranged in all its details. Nothing was now wanting but the
consent of the young lady; obtaining which, Launce would go to
the parish church and give the necessary notice of a marriage by
banns on the next day. There was the plot. What did the ladies
think of it?
<P>
Lady Winwood thought it perfect.
<P>
Natalie was not so easily satisfied.
<P>
"My father has always been so kind to me!" she said. "The one
thing I can't get over, Launce, is distressing papa. If he had
been hard on me--as some fathers are--I shouldn't mind." She
suddenly brightened, as if she saw her position in a new light.
"Why should you hurry me?" she asked. "I am going to dine at my
aunt's to-day, and you are coming in the evening. Give me time!
Wait till to-night."
<P>
Launce instantly entered his protest against wasting a moment
longer. Lady Winwood opened her lips to support him. They were
both silenced at the same moment by the appearance of one of Mrs.
Sancroft's servants,
 opening the gate of the square.
<P>
Lady Winwood went forward to meet the man. A suspicion crossed
her mind that he might be bringing bad news.
<P>
"What do you want?" she asked.
<P>
"I beg your pardon, my lady--the housekeeper said you were
walking here with Miss Graybrooke. A telegram for Miss
Graybrooke."
<P>
Lady Winwood took the telegram from the man's hand; dismissed
him, and went back with it to Natalie. Natalie opened it
nervously. She read the message--and instantly changed. Her
cheeks flushed deep; her eyes flashed with indignation. "Even
papa can be hard on me, it seems, when Richard asks him!" she
exclaimed. She handed the telegram to Launce. Her eyes suddenly
filled with tears. "_You_ love me," she said, gently--and
stopped. "Marry me!" she added, with a sudden burst of
resolution. "I'll risk it!"
<P>
As she spoke those words, Lady Winwood read the telegram. It ran
thus:
<P>
"Sir Joseph Graybrooke, Muswell Hill. To Miss Natalie Graybrooke;
Berkeley Square. Come back immediately. You are engaged to dine
here with Richard Turlington."
<P>
Lady Winwood folded up the telegram with a malicious smile. "Well
done, Sir Joseph!" thought her ladyship. "We might never have
persuaded Natalie--but for You!"
