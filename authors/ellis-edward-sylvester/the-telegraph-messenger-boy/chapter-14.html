<p>Rutherford Richmond recognized Ben Mayberry at the same instant
that the latter identified him. But neither gave any evidence
of the fact that could be understood by other parties.</p>

<p>Ben took his position with Dolly by his side, and they were without
doubt the handsomest couple on the floor that evening. Their mutual
interest was so marked that everyone present noticed it, and it
caused comment without end.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe he sweeps out the office for a telegraph company.
He manages to save up enough money in the course of a year to
buy a decent suit of clothes."</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry was sitting down at the end of one of the dances,
when he overheard these words, which he knew referred to him.
Dolly had excused herself for a few minutes, and he was alone,
sniffing at a fragrant bouquet which he was protecting from all
damage for her benefit.</p>

<p>He knew, further, that the remark was intended for his ears,
but he affected not to know it, while he furtively glanced behind
him. There stood Master Rutherford Richmond, with three or four
lads. They were all jealous of Ben, and were discussing his merits
for his own especial benefit.</p>

<p>"I understand he gets fifty cents a week for his work," observed
another, making sure his voice was elevated enough to be heard
half across the room, "which is a big sum for him."</p>

<p>"I don't understand why Miss Jennie" (referring to Jennie Grandin,
who gave the party) "allows such cattle here," struck in a third,
in the same off-hand manner.</p>

<p>Rutherford Richmond took upon himself to give the reason.</p>

<p>"It was all on account of Dolly. You know she is kind-hearted,
and I understand this booby went to her and begged that she would
give him a chance to see how a party of high-toned people looked.
She couldn't very well refuse, and now she is trotting him around
for the rest of us to laugh at."</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry's cheeks burned, for none of these words escaped
him. He would have given a good deal to have been outside alone
for a few minutes with Master Rutherford Richmond. But he could
not call him to account under the circumstances, and he still
sniffed at the bouquet in his hand, and affected to be very much
interested in the action of a couple of misses on the opposite
side of the room.</p>

<p>"If Miss Jennie permits anything of this kind again," volunteered
Rutherford, "it will cause trouble. A good many will want to know,
before they allow their children to come, whether they are liable
to meet the telegraph office boy and the great ball player here;
if there's danger they will stay at home."</p>

<p>"I think the scum of society should be kept in its place," observed
another, scarcely less bitter than young Richmond in his jealousy
of the lad who claimed so much of the attention of the little
belle of the evening.</p>

<p>This kind of talk was going on when, to Ben's great relief, Dolly
came tripping to him. He added gall to the cup of the envious
youths by rising, giving her his arm, and then glancing triumphantly
back at them, as he escorted her to the dining room.</p>

<p>They knew the meaning of the glance, and they were fierce enough
to assault him had they dared to do so.</p>

<p>The party came to an end before midnight. Ben Mayberry had saluted
his friends, and was in the hall preparatory to going home, when
someone slyly pulled his arm. Turning, he saw that it was Ned
Deering, a little fellow whose father was the leading physician
in Damietta. Ned was a great admirer of Ben, and he now seized
the occasion to say:</p>

<p>"Look out, Ben, when you get down by the bridge over the creek;
they're going for you."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean?"</p>

<p>"That Rutherford Richmond and another fellow mean to hide in
Carter's Alley, and when you come along will pounce down on you.
They wanted me to go with 'em, but I begged off without letting
'em know I meant to tell you."</p>

<p>"Where are they?" asked Ben, glancing furtively about him.</p>

<p>"They slipped out ahead, and are hurrying down there. You had
better take another way home. They are awful mad, and will knock
the stuffing out of you."</p>

<p>Ben Mayberry smiled over the earnest words and manner of the
boy, and thanked him for his information.</p>

<p>"Don't let 'em know I told you," added the timid fellow, as Ben
moved out the door; "for if they find out that it was me that
was the cause of your going the other way home, why, they'd punch
my head for me. That Richmond, they say, is a reg'lar fighter&mdash;has
science, and can lay out anybody of his size."</p>

<p>"They will never know you said anything to me, Ned, for I shall
take the usual way, and will be slow, so as to give them plenty
of time to get there ahead of me."</p>

<p>The little fellow looked wonderingly at Ben as he walked away,
unable to comprehend how anyone should step into a yawning chasm
after being warned of his peril.</p>
