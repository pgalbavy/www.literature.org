<p>It was no surprise to Simon Kenton to learn that his old enemy,
The Panther, was at the head of the formidable war party that
were plotting with so much success against the pioneers. He had
suspected the truth before he learned it from Boone.</p>

<p>The fact removed the last vestige of suspicion any one might
have held as to the motive of the chieftain in failing to accept
the challenge of Kenton to mortal combat. Wa-on-mon had made haste
to hunt up the war party of Shawanoes that he must have known
were in the vicinity, well aware that with them at his beck and
call he could strike a thousandfold more effective blow than by
the simple overthrow of Kenton, accompanied by the disablement
of himself.</p>

<p>The ferocious leader was perilously near success, and it looked
as if nothing could extricate the fugitives from destruction.</p>

<p>The reader need not be reminded that it was the presence and
care of the four females that was a mortal handicap to the brave
men who had set out to conduct them to the block-house up the
river. Had they been already there, the pioneers and rangers would
have given the Shawanoes a hot fight, and driven them off with
the loss of more than one of their bravest leaders.</p>

<p>From what has been already made known, it will be seen that it
was not a hard thing for a friend or enemy to enter the rough
inclosure which had been dignified with the name of fort. The
discovery of the Shawanoe's presence was in the nature of an accident;
but for Agnes Altman he might have wandered almost at will among
the men on guard, and, having learned all he had set out to learn,
stole away without detection.</p>

<p>Kenton and Boone reversed the method when they appeared on the
scene. They had but to make themselves known (an easy matter,
since they were expected) to receive a welcome. At the same time
they avoided detection by the Indians, who were hovering on all
sides.</p>

<p>It has been shown that, in a certain sense, one part of the fortification
was open, since nothing in the nature of a defence interposed
between it and the river. The presumption was, that in this direction
one would have a fair chance of stealing away undiscovered.</p>

<p>The fact, however, that such an opening presented itself was
proof that it was under close surveillance. Possibly, in the gloom,
some of the most skilful of the rangers, by swimming under water
a long way, might elude the vigilance of the Shawanoes, but the
attempt would be fatal to any one of the females, and to more
than one of the men.</p>

<p>Kenton, Boone and Hastings held what might be considered a council
of war, since the fate to all concerned depended upon the result
of the conference.</p>

<p>"There seems but the one chance," remarked Boone, after each
had expressed his views, "and that's a powerful slim one."</p>

<p>"So must every chance be," commented Kenton.</p>

<p>"From what we've learned to-night any one of us three can sneak
out of this place and off in the woods. If that's so, what's to
hinder two or three doing it, by treading on each other's heels?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'," was the prompt response of Hastings.</p>

<p>"'Spose, then, that I try it to the right and Simon to the left;
'spose that each of us takes two persons with him and that they
are females?"</p>

<p>"And if you should get through the lines with 'em?" asked Hastings.</p>

<p>"That's all we want; once clear of the varmints, and with the
better part of the night afore us, the road to the block-house
will be so clear that sun-up will find us all there."</p>

<p>Kenton did not like this plan, and said so.</p>

<p>"It won't work," he asserted, with quiet emphasis. "You and me,
Dan'l, might get through the lines, 'cause we've both done it
this very night, but we couldn't take a woman or gal with us."</p>

<p>Boone held unlimited faith in the woodcraft of his friend, and
meant to leave the decision of the question with him. Kenton condemned
the scheme from the first; therefore it was abandoned.</p>

<p>"I've nothing more to offer," said the elder pioneer, disappointed
by the emphatic veto of the other; "there seems but one thing
left for us&mdash;to stay here and fight it out with the varmints to-morrow.
We can drop some of 'em, and mebbe The Panther will be among 'em,
but there won't be one of us left to rej'ice over his going under."</p>

<p>Kenton held his peace for several minutes. His companions knew
he was thinking intently and that something, desperate though
it might be, would come from it. Neither Boone nor Hastings could
offer the first suggestion; they could only wait for their athletic
companion to counsel or to act.</p>

<p>Without a word, Kenton rose to his feet.</p>

<p>The others did the same, even though their erect position offered
a tempting target to any prowling enemies who might succeed in
entering the inclosure.</p>

<p>"Dan'l, take my gun," said the younger ranger, impressively;
"if I never come back, keep it in remembrance of the many times
you and Sime Kenton have been on the trail together."</p>

<p>"I'll do it, Simon," replied Boone, accepting the weapon.</p>

<p>"But," interposed Hastings, with a nervousness he could not conceal,
"can't me and Boone be of help to you?"</p>

<p>"Not the least; I must go it alone this time."</p>

<p>"But let us know what you're going to try to do."</p>

<p>"When you and me were talking awhile ago, Hastings, you remember
I said there warn't no chance of stealing any canoe in these parts
belonging to the varmints; you remember that?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"All the same I'm going after the canoe I seed crossing the Ohio
just as it was getting dark. I don't b'leve I'll get it, or if
I do that I can make any use of it."</p>

<p>Boone was impelled to interpose, for understanding the hopeless
character of the attempt, it distressed him unspeakably to have
his brave friend sacrifice himself. The elder, however, held his
peace. He knew that Kenton had weighed all the chances, and the
time for protest had passed.</p>

<p>"Stay right where you are," said the younger, moving as coolly
and deliberately as though making ready to retire for the night.
"It ain't likely the varmints will try to disturb you afore morning,
but you know better than to trust 'em. If I ain't back afore daylight
you'll never see me ag'in, and God help you all."</p>

<p>He wrung the hand of each in turn, and facing toward the river
and assuming a crouching posture, vanished as silently as a shadow
in the gloom, not another word falling from the lips of the two
whom he had left behind, until considerable time had elapsed.</p>

<p>Having stripped for the fray, as may be said, by leaving his
cumbersome rifle behind, Kenton approached the edge of the river
with the utmost circumspection. Suspecting, as he did, that the
Shawanoes had left this point open for the very purpose of inviting
such an attempt as he had in view, he was too wise to neglect
every precaution to keep it secret. If by any remote possibility
he should succeed in his daring purpose, it could only be by keeping
his enemies in ignorance of his movements, at least up to the
point of decisive action on his part.</p>

<p>He therefore availed himself of every screen that could be used
to hide his body, and advanced for several rods, more after the
fashion of a serpent gliding over the ground than of a man stealing
forward on his hands and knees. More than a quarter of an hour
was consumed in passing this slight distance. Patience is a cardinal
virtue with men of his profession, a moment's undue haste often
undoing the work of hours. When at last he was able to reach out
his hand and dip it in the cool waters, he was quite certain that
none of the Shawanoes suspected what he had accomplished.</p>

<p>At this crisis several conditions united to help the intrepid
scout. The wind still blowing strongly up the river rustled the
vegetation, and whipped the surface of the river into wavelets
that veiled other sounds, and helped to conceal any disturbance
of the water. A glance at the sky showed the moon hidden by clouds,
but the keen survey of Kenton told him that they would soon float
past the face of the orb, leaving it to shine with greater strength
than before. There was not a moment, therefore, to spare.</p>

<p>He was still flat on the ground, not daring to raise his head
more than a few inches. With the same indescribable movement he
glided from the land into the water, sinking quietly and heavily
below the surface as though he were an iron statue.</p>

<p>Close to the shore the depth was shallow, but he secured enough
freedom of movement to work his way quickly into deep water, where
he was at home. Swimming with prodigious power and skill, wholly
beneath the surface, he turned on his back and allowed his nose
to rise just high enough to give him one deep inhalation, when
he sank again.</p>

<p>With the water crinkled and disturbed by the strong wind, the
keenest-eyed Indian, peering out from the undergrowth along shore,
would have discovered nothing upon which to hinge the faintest
suspicion.</p>

<p>After another long swim, without the power to breathe, Kenton
allowed his head to come up and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>As he anticipated, the moon was just emerging from the mass of
drifting clouds, and the increasing light, spreading over forest
and river, considerably extended his area of vision. Confident
that his departure was unknown to any of the lurking Shawanoe
scouts, he scrutinized his surroundings with more confidence than
he would have felt had it been otherwise.</p>

<p>He could trace the dark outline of the shore he had just left,
or rather the mass of trees and branches were clearly stamped
against the background of sky. Above and below rippled the river
in the dim moonlight, while a wall of indistinct blackness masked
the Ohio shore.</p>

<p>Somewhere along the bank, which he had left but a brief while
before, nestled the canoe he had set out to find and bring to
a point where it could be used to help deliver the pioneers from
their perilous environment, and, without giving another thought
to the impossibility of success, he grimly resolved to do his
utmost, no matter if certain death was to be the result.</p>

<p>Prudence required him to wait until the moon was obscured. Masses
of vapor were continually passing in front of it, and he had to
wait only a few minutes when the gloom permitted the attempt.</p>

<p>With the same cool promptness he swam toward shore, until the
distance he had in mind was passed. Then carefully measuring the
space, he sank below the surface again. The precaution seemed
unnecessary, but such trifles sometimes decide the question of
life and death. Not the slightest misgiving remained, when he
noiselessly raised his head beneath the overhanging branches,
that his departure and return were suspected by a single Shawanoe.</p>

<p>And yet he was only on the threshold of his enterprise. The real
work now confronted him.</p>

<p>Having come in to shore at a point considerably above where he
had left it, Kenton hoped the canoe for which he was searching
was below him. He therefore decided to continue his hunt in that
direction.</p>

<p>With the advantage gained, he required but a short time to do
this, the result being a mistake on his part. He saw nothing of
the craft.</p>

<p>He was about to turn again when he looked out upon the river,
where the moon was shining with unobscured light.</p>

<p>He gave a start, and peered through the parted bushes a second
time, and, as he did so, he received the greatest shock of his
life. Never before or after that eventful night did he go through
so astounding an experience.</p>

<p>So terrified indeed was the brave ranger by what he saw, that,
forgetful of the Shawanoes, the imperiled fugitives, and everything
except his own panic, he dashed through the intervening space,
and, bursting into the inclosure where he had left his friends,
called in a husky undertone:</p>

<p>"Boys, we're lost! we're lost! There's a ghost coming up the
river!"</p>
