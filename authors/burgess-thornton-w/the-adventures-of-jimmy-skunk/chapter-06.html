<p>All the time that Jimmy Skunk was punishing Reddy Fox for rolling
him down hill in a barrel, and while Reddy was sneaking away to
the Green Forest to get out of sight, Peter Rabbit was lying low
in the old house of Johnny Chuck, right near the place where Jimmy
Skunk's wild ride had come to an end. It had been a great relief
to Peter when he had seen Jimmy Skunk get to his feet, and he
knew that Jimmy hadn't been hurt in that wild ride. Lying flat
in the doorway of Johnny Chuck's old house, Peter could see all
that went on without being seen himself, and he could hear all
that was said.</p>

<p>He chuckled as he saw Reddy Fox come up and his eyes were popping
right out with excitement as he waited for what would happen next.
He felt sure that Reddy Fox was in for something unpleasant, and
he was glad. Of course, that wasn't a bit nice of Peter. Right
down in his heart Peter knew it, but he had been chased so often
by Reddy and given so many dreadful frights, that he felt now
that he was getting even. So he chuckled as he waited for what
was to happen. Suddenly that chuckle broke right off in the middle,
and Peter cried "Ouch!" He had felt a pain as if a hot needle
had been thrust into him. It made him almost jump out of the doorway.
But he remembered in time that it would never, never do for him
to show himself outside, for right away Reddy Fox and Jimmy Skunk
would suspect that he had had something to do with that wild ride
of Jimmy's in the barrel. So it would not do to show himself now.
No, indeed!</p>

<p>All he could do was to kick and squirm and twist his head around
to see what was happening. It didn't take long to find out. Even
as he looked, he felt another sharp pain which brought another
"Ouch!" from him and made him kick harder than ever. Two very
angry little insects were just getting ready to sting him again,
and more were coming. They were Yellow Jackets, which you know
belong to the wasp family and carry very sharp little lances in
their tails. The fact is, this old house of Johnny Chuck's had
been deserted so long the Yellow Jackets had decided that as no
one else was using it, they would, and they had begun to build
their home just inside the hall.</p>

<p>Poor Peter! What could he do? He didn't dare go out, and he simply
couldn't stay where he was. Whatever he did must be done quickly,
for it looked to him as if a regular army of Yellow Jackets was
coming, and those little lances they carried were about the most
painful things he knew of. By this time he had lost all interest
in what was going on outside. There was quite enough going on
inside; too much, in fact. He remembered that Johnny Chuck digs
his house deep down in the ground. He looked down the long hall.
It was dark down there. Perhaps if he went down there, these angry
little warriors wouldn't follow him. It was worth trying, anyway.</p>

<p>So Peter scrambled to his feet and scurried down the long hall,
and as he ran, he cried "Ouch! Ouch! Oh! Ohoo!" Those sharp little
lances were very busy, and there was no way of fighting back.
At the end of the long hall was a snug little room, very dark
but cool and comfortable. It was just as he had hoped; the Yellow
Jackets did not follow him down there. They had driven him away
from their home, which was right near the entrance, and they were
satisfied.</p>

<p>But what a fix he was in! What a dreadful fix! He ached and smarted
all over. My goodness, how he did smart! And to get out he would
have to go right past the Yellow Jacket home again.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I wish I had never thought of such a joke," moaned
Peter, trying in vain to find a comfortable position. "I guess
I am served just right."</p>

<p>I rather think he was, don't you?</p>
