<p>Our friends journeyed forward until broad daylight, when they
found themselves fairly among the high range of hills which in
this portion of California comes down almost to the edge of the
sea. The scenery was bleak and rugged, and the country was barren
and showed very few signs of vegetation, so that for all practical
purposes they were little better than if in the sandy desert of
the south-eastern portion of the State.</p>

<p>They observed, too, a disagreeable change in the climate. The
moist winds of the Pacific being cooled by these mountains caused
the air to become chilly and foggy and all felt the need of additional
clothing.</p>

<p>They had now concluded to pass through these hills to the Salinas
Valley and then follow this northward until they reached the more
settled portion of California, or come upon a party of miners
or hunters, in whose company they could feel safe against the
treacherous Indians, and who might perhaps afford them their much-needed
weapons and more abundant food.</p>

<p>The latter question assumed the first importance with them. They
saw no fruits, and very few animals. The discharge of their rifle
was dangerous, as it could be heard at a great distance, and if
there is any creature that is extraordinarily inquisitive it is
the American aborigine.</p>

<p>Several times they heard the faint report of guns in the distance,
but for some days saw no human beings except themselves. At night,
when they lay down to rest, Terror kept a more faithful watch
over them than either of their number could do. They generally
found some secure place among the rocks where they could slumber
in safety.</p>

<p>On the third day after the shipwreck they crossed the dividing
ridge and had a view of Salinas or San Buenaventura Valley. It
was comparatively narrow, looking straighter than it really was,
from the towering Coast Range that rose in vast massive ridges,
several of the peaks piercing the clouds and reaching far up into
the snow line. This was indeed an impassable barrier to their
further progress beyond the valley, had they wished to make the
attempt; for among those wild regions, where at midsummer the
snow is whirled in blinding eddies, and the storm howls through
gorges and canyons, and the lost traveler gropes blindly for a
secure foothold along the mountain paths&mdash;it would have been fatal
for them to venture without a sure guide.</p>

<p>The Salinas Valley looked like a garden to them, and was indeed
a promised land. There was fruit in abundance, and every prospect
of meeting some of their own people. The Buenaventura, years ago,
was a fabled river, and the geographies made it a huge stream,
taking every course except the true one. They found it a river
inferior in breadth and length to the Hudson, but vastly more
interesting from its primeval character and the wild scenery along
its banks.</p>

<p>On the eastern slope of the mountains they discerned a great
variety of trees, among them the <em>Palo Colorado</em> or Lambertine
fir, some of them a dozen feet in diameter, although they did
not attain any remarkable height. These were not the colossal
pines so famous the world over. There were quite a number of beech,
sycamore, oak, spruce, and maple, and other trees whose particular
names they were unable to tell.</p>

<p>There was a noticeable change in the climate also. The air had
parted with a great deal of its moisture, and although very warm,
it had a dryness about it that made it more grateful and pleasant
than the coolness along the coast.</p>

<p>When fairly in the Salinas Valley, and along the river, they
found the vegetation remarkably luxuriant. Oats grew wild in many
places, and the plants partook greatly of a tropical character.
Grapes were very abundant, although it was too early in the season
to find them ripe; yet they gathered a few berries that were very
pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>The first day among the hills was spent like the first one on
shore&mdash;without food, although they had so gormandized themselves
on the preceding evening that they were able to stand this privation
much better.</p>

<p>On the second morning among the hills, just as they had risen
and resumed their journey, Terror gave notice of something unusual
in his characteristic manner&mdash;by halting and uttering a low whine.
At that moment they were making their way around a huge mass of
rocks, in a path that seemed to have been worn by the feet of
wild animals. Tim paused, cocked his rifle and held it ready for
instant use, while the boys looked around for some covert into
which to retreat, if danger threatened.</p>

<p>While they stood in anxious suspense, an animal about the size
of Terror walked leisurely into view, and catching sight of the
strangers raised its head with a look of alarm, then uttered a
shrill <em>baa-aa</em> after the manner of affrighted sheep, and
turned to flee. But he was too valuable a prize to be let run
away in this manner, and ere he could turn round, or the Newfoundland
could reach him, Tim had sent a bullet through his head that tumbled
him over and over as if he had been hit by a cannon-ball.</p>

<p>Hurrying up to him, they found they had been fortunate enough
to secure a good large mountain sheep, a species of animal that
run wild in California, and at certain seasons of the year are
in prime condition. This was found only tolerable, but he was
fully appreciated by our friends. Tim O'Rooney had managed to
conceal a second knife about his person when bargaining with the
Indian&mdash;one made on the liberal ideas that was displayed in the
construction of his watch, and far more useful than the ornamental
trifles that the boys carried.</p>

<p>With the help of this and the anatomical knowledge he possessed,
he was not long in dressing the sheep, and everything was made
ready for cooking him. The sticks were placed together, the choice
steaks were suspended on cross pieces, and the leaves heaped up,
only awaiting ignition.</p>

<p>"I declare!" exclaimed Howard, "how are we going to kindle it?"</p>

<p>Every face looked blank, for the thought had never entered their
minds until that moment.</p>

<p>"Haven't yees a match about you?" he asked, turning to the boys.</p>

<p>Naturally enough the two searched every pocket, and having finished
searched them over again, even turning them wrong side out, and
then turning them in and turning them wrong side out again; but
all in vain, there was not a lucifer in the party.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" exclaimed Elwood, "we are all as hungry as we can
be, and we shall have to remain so for the want of fire."</p>

<p>"If we wait a while we'll not need the match."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It isn't very hard to git hungry enough to ate the same without
waiting for the benefit of cooking."</p>

<p>"I can't do that," added Elwood, with an expression of disgust.</p>

<p>"Nor can I," added Howard.</p>

<p>"I've done it, and found it tasted good," said Tim, "and so would
yez&mdash;but howld on! One of yez whack me over the head!"</p>

<p>"For what?" they demanded in amazement.</p>

<p>"For being an owld fool, and be the same towken it's yourselves
that is the same."</p>

<p>"We do not understand you," they said, in some perplexity.</p>

<p>"Yez are talking about fire when we has it here at hand."</p>

<p>They looked inquiringly around, but did not understand the allusion
until he began loading the gun, when a new light broke upon them,
and they smiled knowingly at each other.</p>

<p>Tim put in a good wadding composed of dry leaves, and placing
the muzzle of his gun among the leaves that they had gathered
for ignition, he discharged it. The intense flame of fire that
streamed forth for an instant communicated itself to the kindlings,
and this being quickly and vigorously blown by all three, almost
immediately spread into a blaze, the wood gathered heat speedily,
and in a few minutes the juicy steaks of the mountain sheep were
steaming and ready for the voracious mouths of the four gathered
around.</p>
