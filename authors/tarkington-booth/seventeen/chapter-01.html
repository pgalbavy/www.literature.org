<p>William Sylvanus Baxter paused for a moment of thought in front
of the drug-store at the corner of Washington Street and Central
Avenue. He had an internal question to settle before he entered
the store: he wished to allow the young man at the soda-fountain
no excuse for saying, "Well, make up your mind what it's goin'
to be, can't you?" Rudeness of this kind, especially in the presence
of girls and women, was hard to bear, and though William Sylvanus
Baxter had borne it upon occasion, he had reached an age when
he found it intolerable. Therefore, to avoid offering opportunity
for anything of the kind, he decided upon chocolate and strawberry,
mixed, before approaching the fountain. Once there, however, and
a large glass of these flavors and diluted ice-cream proving merely
provocative, he said, languidly&mdash;an affectation, for he could
have disposed of half a dozen with gusto: "Well, now I'm here,
I might as well go one more. Fill 'er up again. Same."</p>

<p>Emerging to the street, penniless, he bent a fascinated and dramatic
gaze upon his reflection in the drug-store window, and then, as
he turned his back upon the alluring image, his expression altered
to one of lofty and uncondescending amusement. That was his glance
at the passing public. From the heights, he seemed to bestow upon
the world a mysterious derision&mdash;for William Sylvanus Baxter was
seventeen long years of age, and had learned to present the appearance
of one who possesses inside information about life and knows all
strangers and most acquaintances to be of inferior caste, costume,
and intelligence.</p>

<p>He lingered upon the corner awhile, not pressed for time. Indeed,
he found many hours of these summer months heavy upon his hands,
for he had no important occupation, unless some intermittent dalliance
with a work on geometry (anticipatory of the distant autumn) might
be thought important, which is doubtful, since he usually went
to sleep on the shady side porch at his home, with the book in
his hand. So, having nothing to call him elsewhere, he lounged
before the drug-store in the early afternoon sunshine, watching
the passing to and fro of the lower orders and bourgeoisie of
the middle-sized midland city which claimed him (so to speak)
for a native son.</p>

<p>Apparently quite unembarrassed by his presence, they went about
their business, and the only people who looked at him with any
attention were pedestrians of color. It is true that when the
gaze of these fell upon him it was instantly arrested, for no
colored person could have passed him without a little pang of
pleasure and of longing. Indeed, the tropical violence of William
Sylvanus Baxter's tie and the strange brilliancy of his hat might
have made it positively unsafe for him to walk at night through
the negro quarter of the town. And though no man could have sworn
to the color of that hat, whether it was blue or green, yet its
color was a saner thing than its shape, which was blurred, tortured,
and raffish; it might have been the miniature model of a volcano
that had blown off its cone and misbehaved disastrously on its
lower slopes as well. He had the air of wearing it as a matter
of course and with careless ease, but that was only an air&mdash;it
was the apple of his eye.</p>

<p>For the rest, his costume was neutral, subordinate, and even
a little neglected in the matter of a detail or two: one pointed
flap of his soft collar was held down by a button, but the other
showed a frayed thread where the button once had been; his low
patent-leather shoes were of a luster not solicitously cherished,
and there could be no doubt that he needed to get his hair cut,
while something might have been done, too, about the individualized
hirsute prophecies which had made independent appearances, here
and there, upon his chin. He examined these from time to time
by the sense of touch, passing his hand across his face and allowing
his finger-tips a slight tapping motion wherever they detected
a prophecy.</p>

<p>Thus he fell into a pleasant musing and seemed to forget the
crowded street.</p>
