<p>The need of a large sum of money in a great hurry is the root of many
noble ambitions, in whose branches roost strange companies of birds,
pecking away for dollars that grow--or do not--on bushes. And it was in
such a quest that Miss Patricia Adair of Adairville, Kentucky, lit upon
a limb of life beside Mr. Godfrey Vandeford of Broadway, New York. Their
joint endeavors made a great adventure.
</p>
<p>"There's nothing to it, Pop; either pony girls will have to grow four
legs to cut new capers, somebody will have to write a play entitled
'When Courtship Was in Flower,' requiring flowered skirts ten yards wide
with a punch in each furbelow, or we go out of the theatrical business,"
said Mr. Vandeford, as he shuffled a faint, violet-tinted letter out of
a pile of advertising posters emblazoned with dancing girls and men,
several personal bills, two from a theatrical storage house and one from
an electrical expert, leaned back in his chair, and prepared to open the
violet communication. "We dropped twenty thousand cool on 'Miss Cut-up,'
and those sixteen pairs of legs cost us fifteen hundred a week. We might
be in danger of starving right here on Broadway, if we hadn't picked a
sure-fire hit in 'The Rosie Posie Girl.'"
</p><p>"Ain't it the truth," answered Mr. Adolph Meyers, as he glanced up from
his typewriter with a twinkle in his big black eyes that were like gems
in a round, very sedate, even sad, Hebrew face. "Bare legs and 'cut-ups'
is already old now, Mr. Vandeford. It is that we must have now a play
with a punch."
</p><p>"The law won't let us take anything more off the chorus, so we'll have
to swing back and put a lot on. Costumes that cost a million will be the
next drag, mark me, Pop," Mr. Godfrey Vandeford declaimed with a gloomy
brow, as he still further delayed exploring the violet missive.
</p><p>"A hundred thousand it will take for costuming 'The Rosie Posie Girl,'"
agreed Pop dolefully, from above the letter he was slowly pecking out of
the machine.
</p><p>"For furnishing chiffon belts, you mean, not costumes, if we go by
Corbett's clothes ideas," growled the pessimistic, prospective producer
of the possible next season's hit in the girl-show line.
</p><p>"You have it right," answered Pop, sympathetically.
</p><p>"If I hadn't promised to let old Denny in on my Violet Hawtry show for
the fall I'd be tempted to throw back everything, even 'The Rosie Posie
Girl' and go gunning for potatoes or onions up on a Connecticut farm;
but the show bug has bit Denny hard and I'll have to be the one to
shear him and not leave it to any of the others. I'll be more merciful
to his millions; but asking him to put up half of a cool hundred and
fifty thousand is a bit raw. Wish I had a nice little glad play with an
under twenty cast for him to cut his teeth on instead of the 'Rosie
Posie.'"
</p><p>"It's six plays on the shelf now for reading," reminded Mr. Meyers,
eagerly, for to him fell the task of weeding all plays sent into the
office of Godfrey Vandeford, Theatrical Producer, and his optimistic
soul suffered when he discovered a gem and found himself unable to get
Mr. Vandeford to read so much as the first act unless he caught him in
just such a mood as the one in which he now labored. "Now, I want that
you take just a peep, Mr. Vandeford, at that new Hinkle comedy for which
I have written already five times to delay--"
</p><p>"Can't do it now, Pop! Don't you see that I have got to read this purple
letter and that is all the business I can attend to for this morning?"
answered Mr. Vandeford, as he pushed a slim paper cutter along the top
edge of the purple missive.
</p><p>"But, Mr. Vandeford, it is that I have--"
</p><p>"Express. Sign here!" was the interruption that put an end to Mr.
Meyers's immediate supplication. The parcel that he deposited upon his
chief's desk with forceful meekness was a play manuscript.
</p><p>"Great guns, Pops; I'm seeing purple!" exclaimed Mr. Vandeford, as he
let the violet letter fall upon the violet wrappings in which the
express intrusion was incased. "Exact match! This looks like some sort
of a hunch. Open it, Pops, and run through the layout while I tackle the
violet letter and see if anything happens." And with great interest both
grown men plunged into the excitement of the chase of the hunch.
</p><p>Mr. Vandeford's letter contained the following, delivered in bold words
and script:
</p><p><strong>HIGHCLIFF.</strong>
</p><p>     <u>My dear Van:</u>
</p><pre>
     This is to remind you that it is now July fifth, and my contract
     sets September twenty-third as the last date for my opening on
     Broadway in a new play under your management. "The Rosie Posie
     Girl" will be a huge undertaking and worthy of my every effort, but
     I do not feel that you are up to producing it properly. I regret
     your losses in "Miss Cut-up," but I did my best with a vehicle that
     was not worthy of my ability. The success of "Dear Geraldine" was
     entirely due to the comedy bits I wrote in to suit myself, and I
     had to be costumer and producer and the whole show. In justice to
     myself I feel that I ought to pass under the management of a more
     forceful person than yourself. And anyway I don't think you would
     be able to get a theater to open on Broadway in September. Remember
     that over a hundred good shows died on the road waiting to get into
     Broadway last winter, and _I_ won't play anywhere else. Now Weiner
     wants to buy "The Rosie Posie Girl" from you and open his New
     Carnival Theatre with me in it on October first. You must sell it
     to him. He will make you a good offer. You can't use it without me,
     and I want him to produce it. Please see him immediately. You know
     that you owe your reputation as a producer to me, and don't be
     selfish. I'll expect you up on the evening train to talk over the
     final arrangements. I'll meet you in the runabout and we can go
     out to the Beach Inn for dinner. Bring me some brandied marrons, a
     large bottle of rose oil and a stick of lip rouge from Celeste's.
                                           Hurriedly,
                                           VIOLET.
     July fifth.
     P. S. Of course you are to go on loving me just as usual. I
     couldn't do without that. How much money have I in the
     Knickerbocker Trust?</pre>
<p>After Godfrey Vandeford had read the last violent purple line on violet,
he dropped the letter on his desk and looked out of his office window
with serious eyes that gazed without seeing, down the long canyon of
Broadway, up and down which rushed traffic composed of green cars shaped
like torpedoes, honking, darting motors, skulking trucks and jostling,
tangled people. Flamboyant signs, waving flags, and gilt-lettered window
panes made a Persian glow in a belt space up from the seething sidewalks
to the sky line, and above it all the roar and din rose to high heaven.
But Godfrey Vandeford was blind to it all and deaf, as he sat and
brooded above the furious landscape. His blue eyes, set deep back under
their black, gray-splashed brows, failed to take in the lurid spectacle,
and his narrow, lean face was flushed under the bronze it had acquired
for keeps from the suns of many climes. His lean, powerful body seemed
fairly crouched in thought. Once he shifted one leg across the other,
and as he settled back in his chair he tossed the violet letter over to
Mr. Meyers without seeming to know that he did so. Then he plunged back
into his absorption without seeing his henchman read rapidly through the
missive, look at him once with a gem-like keenness, and again begin to
read the purple-covered manuscript.
</p><p>"And we picked her out of a vaudeville gutter over beyond Weehawken just
five years ago, Pop," Mr. Vandeford finally interrupted the flip of the
manuscript pages to say, with a deep musing in his flexible, sympathetic
voice.
</p><p>"You taught her to eat with the knife and the fork," growled Mr. Meyers
from behind his violet barricade as he ripped over another page.
"Mick!"
</p><p>"Oh, not as bad as that, Pop," laughed Mr. Vandeford, with a glance of
affection at the young Hebrew delving in the corner for a jewel for him.
"She's just--oh, well, they are all children--and have to be spanked.
She wants to sell me out to Weiner after I've spent five nice, good
years in building her into a little twinkle star, but I don't think it
will be good for her to let her do it. I'll have to use the slipper on
her, I'm afraid. I believe in hunches and I believe I'll just use that
purple manuscript you're chewing to let her set her teeth in. She needs
one good failure to tone her up. What's the name of the effusion in
ribbons?"
</p><p>"The Renunciation of Rosalind," murmured Mr. Meyers, as he bent once
more to the pages which he had been reading with eagerness when
interrupted by his chief.
</p><p>"We could call it 'The Purple Slipper.' About what will the cast
figure?"
</p><p>"Three thousand per week if you use Gerald Height at five hundred as per
contract with him. But, Mr. Vandeford, sir, I would say for a play this
is--"
</p><p>"That's not much money to waste on a purple hunch. A nice, judicious,
little second-hand staging out of the warehouse and a few weeks' road
try-out for the failure will cost about ten thousand. I'll let Denny
have five thousand worth of fun mussing around with it to cut his eye
teeth, and then we'll clap Violet into 'The Rosie Posie Girl,' weeping
with gratitude to have her face saved after being slapped first. Get the
parts out to-morrow and you and Chambers begin to cast it. I'll see
actors here from three to five Friday. I'll open it September tenth. Now
I've got to go and chase those confounded marrons. The last I took were
put up in maraschino and were not welcomed. I'll be in the office--"
</p><p>"And about the author, Mr. Vandeford, and the contracts?" questioned Mr.
Meyers, with both dismay and energy in his voice.
</p><p>"Oh, I forgot about the author. She won't amount to much. A woman, I
judge, from the ribbons. Offer the usual five, rising to seven and a
half royalties, and explain carefully that you mean five per cent. on
the box office receipts under five thousand, and seven and a half on all
over that. Also go into the moving picture rights and second companies
with your usual honesty, but offer her only a two hundred and fifty
advance to cover a two years' option. She won't know that it ought to be
five hundred for six months, and what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
Besides, it will all be over for her and her play before October."
</p><p>"She says in the letter which was pinned to the first page of the play,
that the article about you in the 'Times Magazine' made her know that
you were the one producer to whom she could trust her play," said Mr.
Meyers, reading from a neat little cream-white note in his hand.
</p><p>"Sweet child!" murmured Mr. Vandeford, as he took up his hat and stick.
"Don't encourage her in any way in your letter, Pop. We don't want her
rushing to the scene of action when we butcher her child. Pay the two
thousand to Hilliard for the option on 'The Rosie Posie Girl' until
January first, and tell him I am going to produce it in November. 'Phone
me at Highcliff to-morrow if you want me. I'll be clearing the deck for
the--spanking."
</p><p>"I wish you good luck," said Mr. Meyers feelingly.
</p><p>"What do you judge that play is about from reading the first act, and
what is the author's name? I might have to produce a little concrete
information in the fracas," the eminent producer paused to inquire just
as he was closing the door.
</p><p>"It is written by a Miss Patricia Adair of Adairville, Kentucky, and it
has in plenty of ruffles and romance that is in a past time of a
Colonial Governor and his wife alone at home with him in Washington."
</p><p>"That sounds about right for the weapon of castigation for Violet
Hawtry, <u>née</u> Murphy. I have always believed in hunches, and that
accord in color was meant to mean something. Better send me a copy
special in the morning. If Mr. Farraday calls me before I get him tell
him the Astor at one to-day. What did I say? Marrons, lip stick, and--"
</p><p>"Rose oil," prompted Mr. Meyers, with just the trace of a sneer in his
voice.
</p><p>"Right O! Rose oil it is. By!" And the door closed on Mr. Vandeford's
graceful figure in its gray London tweeds.
</p><p>Thus a great adventure was undertaken in all levity. And with his
chief's complete departure a change came into the mien of Mr. Adolph
Meyers. He told the stenographer in the outer office to engage two girls
to copy a play that afternoon and evening, to keep him from being
interrupted until six, and to muffle the telephone unless in cases of
emergency. Then he seated himself in Mr. Vandeford's deep chair, put his
feet on the desk, lit a fat, black cigar and plunged into "The Purple
Slipper," <u>née</u> "The Renunciation of Rosalind." For two hours he read
with the deepest absorption, only pausing to make an occasional note on
a pad at his elbow. Then after he had laid down the manuscript with its
purple wrappings and ribbons, he sat for a half hour in a trance, out of
which he came to seat himself at the typewriter to indite a portentous
letter, which he put in an envelope, sealed and directed to:
</p><p><strong>MISS PATRICIA ADAIR,</strong>
</p><p>                                           Adairville, Kentucky.
</p><p>The contents were:
</p><p>     <u>My dear Madam:</u>
</p><pre>
     I have carefully read your play entitled "The Renunciation of
     Rosalind," and have decided to make you the following offer for the
     production rights. I will give you two hundred and fifty dollars
     for all rights of production, including moving picture rights and
     supplementary road companies to extend over a period of two years
     from the date of signing the contract, and will agree to pay you in
     addition five per cent. of all box receipts up to five thousand per
     week and seven and a half on all exceeding that sum. If you agree
     to this proposition, I will send you a formal contract covering all
     points in legal terms. Please let me know at your earliest
     convenience your decision about the matter, as I now intend to
     produce it in September with Violet Hawtry in the title rôle.
     Believe me, my dear Madam,
                                      Very truly,
                                           GODFREY VANDEFORD.</pre>
<p>The above epistle from a strange outer world found Miss Patricia Adair,
attired in a faded gingham frock, planting snap beans in her ancestral
garden. It was delivered to her by her brother, Mr. Roger Adair, from
the hip pocket of his khaki trousers, upon which were large smudges of
the agricultural profession. His blue gingham shirt was open at the
throat across a strong bronze throat, and his eyes were as blue as his
shirt and laughed out across big brown freckles that matched his
chestnut hair.
</p><p>"Here's a letter I brought over from the post-office, Pat, along with a
sack of meal and fifty cents' worth of sugar. Mr. Bates said Miss Elvira
Henderson stopped in and told him to send it to you by the first person
coming your way," he said as he threw the reins of the filly, whose
chestnut coat matched his hair exactly, over the gate post, and
proceeded to take from the pommel of the saddle the two bundles of
groceries mentioned. "Mr. Bates sent you this bunch of tomato plants and
head lettuce to set out along the back border of your rose beds, and
I'll spade it all up for you right now if--"
</p><p>"Oh, Roger, listen, listen!" exclaimed Patricia, as she sprang to her
feet from her knees upon which she had rested as she read the letter he
had handed her. "My play, my play, it's sold!" And as she sparkled at
him over the letter of Mr. Adolph Meyers held clasped to her gingham
bosom, wild roses bloomed in her cheeks and tears sparkled in her gray
eyes back of their thick black lashes.
</p><p>"What play?" demanded Roger, stolid with astonishment.
</p><p>"The one I wrote last month and the month before, when Mr. Covington
said that the mortgage must be paid--or give up Rosemeade. I knew it
would kill Grandfather to move him away from the house he was born in,
and I couldn't think of anything that would get money quick but coal oil
wells and gold mines and plays. It costs money to dig up oil and gold,
but it is easy to write a play."
</p><p>"Oh, is it?" Roger questioned, with a twinkle in his eyes above the
freckles. In his arms he still held the meal and the sugar, and his
interest was an inspiration to Patricia to pour out the whole story in a
torrent of tumbling words.
</p><p>"You know those love letters I have of our great grandmother's that she
wrote to her husband while he was in Washington consulting the President
about the first constitutional convention, the ones about the Indian
raid and the battle at Shawnee. You remember the day I read them to you
up in the apple tree in the orchard years ago, don't you?"
</p><p>"Yes, I remember the day," answered Roger, with another twinkle turned
inward at the memory of his seventeen-year-old scorn of Patricia's
eleven-year-old sentimentality.
</p><p>"Well, those letters are the play," announced Patricia triumphantly. "I
read a lot of Shakespeare and other old English dramas I found in
Grandfather's library to see exactly how to make one. It ends when he
comes back expecting to find her killed and she is dancing at a dinner
she has given her lover as a bet that he would come back by that night.
It's wonderful!" As she thus laid bare the skeleton of her play child,
Patricia took from doubting Roger the sack of sugar.
</p><p>"Shoo, that's not a play," hooted Roger, with a decided return of his
seventeen-year-old scorn in his thirtieth summer.
</p><p>"Read that," answered Patricia with dignity, as she handed him Mr.
Godfrey Vandeford's letter, written and signed by Mr. Adolph Meyers.
</p><p>"Whew--uh, Pat, two hundred and fifty dollars!" Roger exclaimed, as his
manner dissolved quickly from affectionate derision into respectful awe.
</p><p>"Oh, that's just a trifle for a beginning; those royalties may be worth
several hundred thousand. In the 'Times Magazine' article that I read
about Godfrey Vandeford and his plays, it said he had paid the author of
'Dear Geraldine' more than a hundred thousand dollars in royalties. That
is what made me write the play."
</p><p>"Say, let me take it sitting down," said Roger as he sank upon the grass
beside a rose bed that had a row of spring onions growing odoriferously
defiant under the very shower of its petals, and laid the sack of
precious meal tenderly across his knees. "Now go on and tell me."
</p><p>"You see, Roger, I had to do something to get the money to keep the
house for Grandfather. You know we couldn't get any more mortgage money,
because it had closed up or something, and--"
</p><p>"Did Covington tell you he was going to foreclose after I--that is,
right away?" demanded Roger fiercely, with a snap in the blue eyes above
the freckles.
</p><p>"No," said Patricia, as she settled herself on the grass beside Roger,
with the valuable sugar balanced tenderly upon her knee. "He told me
that he would let it stand just as it was for three months until October
first, but after that we would have to--to tell--Grandfather and move,"
a quiver came into Patricia's soft voice that had in it the patrician,
slurring softness that can only come from the throat of a grand dame
sprung from the race which has dominated blue-grass pastures. "Doctor
Healy says it won't be long but--but now he'll--he'll die in his own
home that Grandmother built where he fought off the Indians. Her play
has saved us."
</p><p>"I had fixed it to run until I make my crops," said Roger, with a choke
in his voice that was a rich masculine accompaniment to Patricia's.
</p><p>"The play will have been running six weeks by that time, and I can pay
most of it off. A hundred thousand a year is almost ten thousand a month
and--"
</p><p>"But all plays don't succeed, Pat, honey, and--"
</p><p>"The 'Times Magazine' said that Godfrey Vandeford had never had a
failure, and didn't you read that he wants to star Violet Hawtry in it?
She was 'Dear Geraldine.' How could it fail?" Patricia was positively
haughty toward Roger's timorousness.
</p><p>"That's so," admitted Roger, convinced. "And we can easy get by on the
two fifty until October, especially with the garden I am going to raise.
I'm no Godfrey Vandeford, but I'm a first-class producer--of potatoes
and onions and cabbage and turnip greens and corn. In these war times a
potato producer ranks with any old producer."
</p><p>"But I won't be able to leave all of the two hundred and fifty to use
this summer. I'll have to take some of it with me."
</p><p>"With you where?" demanded Roger.
</p><p>"To New York. Do you suppose even Mr. Godfrey Vandeford would undertake
to produce a play without the author there to help him?" Patricia's
scorn of Roger's lack of sound reasoning about theatrical matters was
hurled at him pitilessly.
</p><p>"Of course not," admitted Roger hurriedly. "You can take the whole two
hundred and fifty and I'll look after the Major and Jeff."
</p><p>"I don't know what I'd do without you, Roger," said Patricia, as she
cuddled her cheek for an instant against his strong, warm shoulder under
the gingham shirt. "I'm afraid of New York. I know you'll take care of
Grandfather; but who'll look after little me--I don't know what I'll do
all by myself. Maybe I won't have to--"
</p><p>"Certainly you'll have to go," Roger interrupted with comforting
assurance. "Go to the Young Women's Christian Association, and if
anything happens to you telegraph me and I'll come get you."
</p><p>"I hadn't thought of the Y. W. C. A. Of course I'll be all right there.
I'll get Miss Elvira to write a special letter to the secretary about
me," exclaimed Patricia with the joy lights back in the great, gray
eyes. "And it's so cheap there that I can leave a lot of the money at
home. I'll only be gone about six weeks."
</p><p>"No, I think you had better take all the two fifty with you," said
Roger. "You know you have to spend money to make money and you mustn't
be short. I'll look after the Major and Jeff. Don't you worry, dear."
</p><p>"Will you let me buy you a big silo and a tractor plow when I get all
the money? You are the greatest farmer in the world and you only need a
little machinery to prove it." Again the young playwright rose to her
knees and with letter and sugar in her embrace she entreated to be
allowed to spend the money that was to be hers from "The Renunciation of
Rosalind," which she did not know was being cast in New York as "The
Purple Slipper."
</p><p>"Certainly I'll let you help me, Pat. Hasn't what's yours and mine
always been ours since we set our first hen together?" laughed Roger, as
he rose to his feet and dragged Patricia to hers beside him. "Come on
and let's break it to the Major. You may need me to stand by if it hits
him on the bias," and they both laughed with a tinge of uneasiness as
they went down the long walk of the garden which on both sides was
sprouting and leaving and perfuming in a medley of flowers and
vegetables.
</p><p>As they walked slowly along Roger cast an eye of great satisfaction over
the long lines of rapidly maturing peas and beans and heavy-leaved
potatoes, and in his mind calculated that a year's food for the small
family at Rosemeade was being produced right at their door under his
skilful hoe which he wielded at off times when he could leave the negro
hands to their work out on Rosemeade, their ancestral five hundred acres
of blue-grass meadows and loamy fields. Roger had for the summer quit
his slowly growing law practice in Adairville, enlisted as a doughty
Captain in the Army of the Furrows and was as proud of his khaki and
gingham uniform with their loam smudges as of his diploma from the
University of Virginia which hung in the wide old hall, the top one in a
succession of five given from father to son of the house of Adair. The
whole county was farming under the direction of Roger, and he had been
obliged often to work Patricia's garden by moonlight.
</p><p>"I'm almost afraid to tell Grandfather," Patricia interrupted his food
calculations to say as they came around the corner of the wide-roofed
old brick house with its traceries of vines that massed at the eaves to
give nesting for many doves, and beheld the Major seated in his arm
chair on the porch which was guarded and supported by round, white
pillars around which a rose vine festooned itself. A faded, plaid wool
rug was across the Major's knees in spite of the fact that the evening
was so warm, and about his shoulders was a wide, gray knitted scarf. A
bent, white-haired old negro stood beside him filling his pipe for him
and serving as a target for the words issuing from beneath his waxed
white mustache that gave the impression of crossed white swords.
</p><p>"War! What do they know about war, Jeff? We killed our first Yankee
before we were seventeen, and now they fight behind guns located six
miles away by squinting through double-decker opera glasses. War, I say
in these days--"
</p><p>"Yes, sir," assented Jeff, in soothing interruption of what he
considered debilitating heat in the Major's words. "We whipped them
Yankees in no time but they jest didn't find it out in time to stop
killing us 'fore it all ended. Now, I'm going to help you to your room
and make you comfortable for I--"
</p><p>"I see Patricia and Roger approaching and I'll wait to talk to them for
a few minutes, Jeff," answered the Major with a slight note of entreaty
in his voice.
</p><p>"Jess a little while, then, jess a little while," consented the old
black comrade nurse as he shuffled into the house and back to his
kitchen to complete his preparation of the simple evening meal for his
little household. As he crisped his bacon, scrambled his eggs and
browned his muffins he muttered to himself:
</p><p>"He's gitting weaker every day--help him Lord, and me to keep care of
him."
</p><p>Just as he was turning the fluffy yellow scramble into a hot, old silver
dish he paused and listened to the musketry of the Major's deep voice
which was huge even in weakness, then he shook his head and began to
hustle the food together to be able to use the announcement of the meal
as an interruption to the harmful excitement, whose scattering words he
was at a loss to understand.
</p><p>"Impossible! Impossible that my granddaughter should barter and trade in
the theatrical world, a world into which no lady should ever set foot.
No! Do not argue, Patricia! Roger and I understand, and it is not
needful that you should," were the words of the assault and
counter-charge that so puzzled old Jeff over his skillet and baker.
</p><p>"I'm not going to act in the play, Grandfather. I wrote it and I'm going
to show them how I want it acted and then come right home," soothed
Patricia, looking to Roger for help and reinforcement.
</p><p>"She'll stay at the Young Women's Christian Association, Major, and
she'll be perfectly safe. I am going to write to Dennis Farraday, who
graduated with me at the University, and ask him to look after her if
she needs anything."
</p><p>"Ah, that puts another face on the matter," said the Major, with a
degree of mollification coming into his keen, old face and weakly
booming voice. "Of course, the Adairs have always been geniuses of one
kind or another, and it is not surprising that my granddaughter should
have produced a great American Drama. If she has the interest and
protection of a gentleman who is a friend of her brother's, and a safe
retreat in a woman's organization I will have to permit her to
superintend the placing of her great work before an appreciative public.
Of course, she will not be thrown with any of the theatrical world
socially, and in a few weeks she will return to her own home, leaving
that world better for having had a brief glimpse of her. You may go,
Patricia. Jefferson!" Fatigue showed very decidedly in the Major's weak
call to the old negro, who came immediately and rolled his chair away
with an indignant cast of his eyes at the two young people.
</p><p>"Wh-eugh, that was a battle, and if I hadn't thought of old Denny to
bring up as a support to the Young Women's Christian Association I think
it would have sure gone the other way." And Roger laughed with the
twinkle above the freckles as he leaned against the rose vine around the
pillar and fanned himself with his hat.
</p><p>"<u>Is</u> there any Denny?" questioned Patricia weakly, from the top step
upon which she had sunk when the Major was wheeled away.
</p><p>"Certainly, and he's a jolly good fellow," answered Roger. "I had a
letter from him year before last. I'll write him all about everything
and he'll look after you for me. I'd trust Denny to do his best for me
if I hadn't seen him for fifty years. I lived with him our Junior and
Senior years and I know him. But I must go. I have to go back to the
grocery again to get a plow point."
</p><p>"Please don't go until after supper," pleaded Patricia. "I want to think
out loud to you. It has just struck me that I will have to have some
clothes. What will I do about it? I can't go to New York in a gingham
dress."
</p><p>"In such a crisis as that I think Miss Elvira will be a better target
for your thoughts than I can be. I'll stop and tell her the news and
send her over," teased Roger with his engaging twinkle.
</p><p>"I can't think to anybody like I can to you," said Patricia, as she came
and stood beside him.
</p><p>"I really have to go, honey child, to see about the ploughing in my
South meadow, but I'll come back to be in the finish of the dimity
confab," answered Roger, as he patted Patricia on the shoulder and went
rapidly away.
</p><p>And a dimity confab was a good name for the conference that was held in
the July moonlight on the front porch of Rosemeade for several silvered
hours that night. Miss Elvira Henderson, modiste, who was the guide,
philosopher and friend, in the matter of costuming as well as in all
other matters, of the feminine population of Hillcrest, had hurried down
the street to the Rosemeade gate as soon as she had consumed her
spinster baked apple and toast supper, and on her way had collected
pretty Mamie Lou Whitson and progressive Jenny Kinkaid, who formed a
thrilled chorus to her interested and joyful conversation with
Patricia.
</p><p>"The eyes of the world will be on you, Patricia, and nothing short of a
silk tailor suit will be suitable for you to wear to sustain yourself in
such a position," declared Miss Elvira, with a positive degree of
finality in her voice.
</p><p>"And you'll have to have at least three evening dresses, Pat, for that
same article about Mr. Godfrey Vandeford said that Broadway only woke up
at night. And you know it said he was the best known man on Broadway. Of
course, he'll take you to lots of Cafes and dances, and midnight frolics
and--and things," bubbled Mamie Lou very unwisely.
</p><p>"Patricia is to stay at The Young Women's Christian Association, and I
am sure they will expect her to be in bed before any midnight
foolishness," said Miss Elvira, with a severe glance at the frivolous
Mamie Lou. "I shall, of course, make her an evening dress or two, one
especially to wear when the multitude calls her before the curtain to
express their admiration of and enthusiasm over her play, but I shall
trust Patricia not to let them lead her into any undue frivolity. The
theatres all close at eleven o'clock."
</p><p>"The article said that was the time that Broadway woke up, and--" Jenny
began, as she hid behind Mamie Lou as if expecting a volley from Miss
Elvira. But Miss Elvira was too much absorbed to notice her in any way.
Miss Elvira was also in the throes of conceptive genius.
</p><p>"The last 'Woman's Review' had a colored plate of a suit that I can see
on you, Patricia," she mused under her breath. "It was queer blue,
with--"
</p><p>"In that big trunk of your great grandmother's up in the garret there's
a blue silk that she wore in Washington that is that curious new blue
color, Pat, and a lot more of--" Mamie Lou was saying with great
executive ability when Miss Elvira seized on her idea and made it her
own with the avidity of real genius.
</p><p>"We'll make over all of old Madam Adair's dresses for you, Patricia,"
she decreed.
</p><p>"They've always been kept kind of sacred and--" Patricia began to
remonstrate with uncertainty in her voice.
</p><p>"And rightly so--but at the presentation of her play it is proper for
them to emerge," Miss Elvira further decreed. "Get a lamp and let's go
look at them and decide to-night," she further commanded.
</p><p>And from the result of that resurrection in the garret of Rosemeade,
Adairville, Kentucky, later Broadway, even Fifth Avenue, New York, got a
decided and unwonted thrill.
</p><p>"The clothes are all right, Roger. Miss Elvira is going to make me a lot
out of great-grandmother's clothes she wore in Washington to dance with
Lafayette," Patricia confided to Roger as they stood under the rose vine
in the moonlight at the late hour of ten-thirty that evening after she
had helped him transplant a lot of sturdy tomato vines.
</p><p>"Little old New York will sit up and take notice when it sees you in
party dimity, Pat," he said as he smiled down into the eager, gray eyes
that were raised to his, beaming through their long black lashes.
</p><p>"Oh, I hope I'll make friends, Roger," Patricia answered the warmth in
his voice as she clung to the warmth and strength of his arm as if in
foreboding.
</p><p>"Of course New York will love you, Pat. Hasn't everybody always loved
you?" he asked tenderly as he put his work-worn hand over hers on his
arm.
</p><p>"Yes," answered Patricia, with her head suddenly held high. "If anybody
don't like me, I'll make them."
</p><p>At about the same hour that this challenge to his world was flung from
the lips of the beautiful and talented Miss Patricia Adair upon the
moonlit and mockingbird trilled air of the Bluegrass State Mr. Godfrey
Vandeford was engaged in about the twenty-fifth round of the spanking of
Miss Violet Hawtry in the State of New York, and he was having a hard
time accomplishing his purpose.
</p><p>"It's just like your selfishness to try to put me into a piffling play
by some unknown author with every risk to be run, when Weiner wants to
buy your contract and put me into 'The Rosie Posie Girl,' which is a
play by Hilliard that gives me scope for all of my ability. He is
willing to give you a fifth interest in it and that's all you deserve.
I'll show you whether or not you can sacrifice my career,
you ----! ----! ----! you!" And with which tirade the beautiful Violet
stormed up and down the veranda of Highcliff in front of the supine
figure of her manager, which was clad in immaculate white flannel, suede
and linen, with a blue silk scarf knotted at the base of his lean,
bronze throat, which matched the blue of his keen eyes under their
gray-sprinkled brows, as the only bit of color in his irreproachable
costuming.
</p><p>"You've read neither play, my dear Violet. You may like 'The Purple
Slipper.' In which case you get the same salary and I get all the
profits instead of the one-fifth our friend Weiner is offering me for
letting you act in my other play," he answered his star's outburst in an
easy, mollifying drawl.
</p><p>"Everybody knows that a Hilliard play is a <u>play</u>, and I'm not going to
try out a new playwright just to put money in your pockets. Why should
I?" demanded the star virago, in a fury that made her snapping Irish
blue eyes, tall, strapping, curved body, and pale tawny hair combine
into a good semblance of the jungle queen on a prey quest.
</p><p>"No reason except your contract entered into in all lawfulness,"
answered Mr. Godfrey Vandeford. "You know what the Courts are, and if
you like I'll meet you there and fight it out instead of by these
sounding sea waves in this delicious moonlight. Come here and kiss me
and do let our lawyers settle it all for us." As he spoke he rose lazily
and attempted to take the taut young cat into a pair of listlessly
desirous arms.
</p><p>"Not on your life you big loafer, you, just because you put one over me
when I was a starved stage door drab don't think I am that same kind or
that sort of thing goes with me now." She spit the words at him as she
half yielded to his nonchalant embrace and half repulsed it.
</p><p>"Be accurate, Violet, my dear: did I demand your heart until I had
managed you and my own affairs to the point where you could buy
Highcliff or any other trifles you wanted? There are other ladies to
love in the world besides you, aren't there? There are other gentlemen
besides me and you've had five years--and a wide hunting grounds. I've
got you under only one contract--business and not--pleasure."
</p><p>"God, I don't know whether I love or hate you most," were the words of
the conciliating purr that he got as she turned to put herself back
under his caressing.
</p><p>"Hate, I wager," he laughed softly, as he drew away from her and seated
himself on the railing of the veranda which hung out over the old ocean
so that its hungry waves seemed to be leaping up to engulf him. The gray
peaks and gable of the Hawtry cottage massed themselves back of him and
in the silvering moonlight he looked like a white eagle perched on an
eyrie.
</p><p>"Don't make me play that play; give me over to Weiner," the star of many
such an encounter as well of "Dear Geraldine" coaxed, as she followed
him and put bare, white, glistening arms around his neck and attempted
to draw his head down against a bosom that still tossed with the storm
of anger that she had put out of voice and face. "You know how last year
nobody could get a theatre for love or money, and the producers who
owned theatres put on all the plays and coined money. It will be worse
next year. You have no theatre and Weiner has three. He offers to let us
open the New Carnival. It'll be a sure thing; while your play will have
to take its chance for a New York theatre and maybe get none. Please,
Godfrey!"
</p><p>"Well, you see I had agreed to let Dennis Farraday in on this play, and
it would sell him out to Weiner too," answered Mr. Vandeford, as he very
gently but determinedly took the white arms from around his neck and
refused the pillow of the storming breast.
</p><p>"Dennis Farraday?" Violet asked, and Mr. Vandeford shot a quick glance
of question at her as he felt the tautening of the muscles in the white
arms that he had in his grasp of untangling. "You are not going to trim
him, are you?"
</p><p>"No, not if you make a hit in 'The Purple Slipper,' answered Mr.
Vandeford, as he gave her another appraising glance while he lit a
cigarette.
</p><p>"Has he read the play?"
</p><p>"He's putting his money on Hawtry in a play of Vandeford's selecting and
producing," was the slap administered with the soft drawl. And as he
slapped he watched the reaction.
</p><p>"What did you do with that copy of the play that fellow Dolph sent out
this morning?" was what he got with an entire change of purpose in the
beautiful, stormy face that had calmed in an instant.
</p><p>"It's in your room on the table by your bed," answered Mr. Vandeford, as
he rose, stretched, yawned and in other ways indicated his desire for
sleep in the primitive manner that a man uses in the bosom of his
family.
</p><p>"I'm going to read it if you don't mind," the Violet said with a smile
of pleasure instead of the frown of anger which had so lately rested on
her fair face. Mr. Vandeford laughed inwardly; she was about as
transparent as a very young kitten in its eagerness for a saucer of
cream.
</p><p>"Good girl," answered Godfrey, as together they entered the dark house.
Together they climbed the steps, and with a kiss executed by the Violet
he left her to turn into the door of her room while he went on to his
just beyond.
</p><p>Out of her sight the lazy, care-free manner left his lithe body, and in
an instant every muscle stiffened to action. The smoulder of anger in
his eyes blazed. He looked at his watch.
</p><p>"Thirty-five minutes to catch that eleven-fifteen train to town. Never
again. I'm done!" he murmured and looked about him at his belongings
strewn around his room. "I'll send Dolph out to pack to-morrow. A jump
into tweeds and a sprint down the beach will make it."
</p><p>And after vigorously suiting his actions to his words for twenty minutes
he was running swiftly down the beach well ahead of the time of the
eleven-fifteen train. Just as the headlight cast a red ray down the long
track he stepped on the platform and in ten seconds more he was being
whirled away from the moonlight and sands and white arms, having
accomplished his purpose of the spanking, cut forever chains that
galled, and was well content with himself and the world.
</p><p>Back at Highcliff the beautiful Violet had been undergoing the rites of
retirement, assisted by her very well-skilled maid, deep in an exciting
dream of conquest. As she let her soft, perfumed, silken garments be
taken from her one at a time until her pearly body was exposed to the
brisk sea air, for which tonic Susette had thrown wide both broad
windows, she was weighing in her shrewd little gutter-gamin mind the
advantages of the road to the right against the turn to the left. The
Hilliard "Rosie Posie Girl" in the fall produced by Weiner with all his
trained staff, command of a big new theatre and three others, and
following road prestige appealed strongly to her cupidity, which had
been well trained in getting dimes from tight pockets in cheap cafes and
ten, twenty and thirty theatres, but she had seen a grouping of Dennis
Farraday's name in the paper a few days ago with the names of some young
New York multimillionaires in a National Commission, and she knew that
he and his "pile" were worthy of the effort of her charms. Also she had
seen big, broad, breezy, gallant Dennis himself at luncheon with Mr.
Vandeford in the Astor not ten days before, and her designs had been
decidedly set in his direction. To her thinking, big, broad, breezy,
gallant men were always easy. As Susette enveloped her rosiness from the
sea air in a soft white cloud of chiffon and embroidery, removed the
rose mules from her feet, helped her in between the fragrant linen
sheets that were as soft as rich silk, threw over her a rose-colored
puff of silk and lace and down, turned on her reading lamp, upon whose
shade wanton fauns and nymphs sported, piled her pillows high and left
her, the scales were about going down on the side in which was placed
"The Purple Slipper," Mr. Dennis Farraday--and Miss Patricia Adair, who
at that time was the unknown quantity which Fate often throws in any
balance.
</p><p>With a luxurious sigh and flexing of her long, supple body the Violet
picked up the business-like copy of the Violet manuscript which Mr.
Adolph Meyers had sent her instead of the beribboned, purple
"Renunciation of Rosalind," and began to read the first page when the
telephone beside her bed rang with a soft tinkle. She picked up the
ivory receiver and into it murmured a softly tentative:
</p><p>"Yes?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, Mr. Farraday! How are you?"
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes, this is Violet Hawtry."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Deliciously well, thank you."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Yes, he's here, but the gay young thing has gone to bed hours ago."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Most interesting for me, but I have to submit."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"Oh, lovely. Do come. I'll adore having him routed out for you. Of
course we'll go with you. I had forgot that Simone was to dance at the
Beach Inn to-night."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"No indeed, I have not undressed at all. I was going to study a part
to-night."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>"I'm sure Godfrey can be dressed in half an hour, and it will take even
your Surreness that time to get here. Take the beach road; it's fine.
Good-by then. In half an hour."
</p><p>  . . . . . .
</p><p>With which ending and beginning the Violet hung up the ivory receiver
and rang for Susette. The summons was answered by Mrs. Aline Hawtry,
<u>née</u> Maggie Murphy the first, an embarrassing but in a manner cherished
relict of the Hawtry past life in Weehawken.
</p><p>"Sure, and the little Frinchy is a-bed, Mag! What be ye wanting? The
night is after sneaking out the back door of the morning." Mrs. Hawtry,
once Murphy, was a big bonny edition of the Violet grown into a cabbage
rose and her voice was also of the same rich texture.
</p><p>"Rout out Godfrey, Ma, and then stir up Susette with a hot stick. Mr.
Dennis Farraday is coming down to take us over to see Simone dance at
the Beach Inn. I want him to see me instead of Simone. Hurry!"
</p><p>"The poor dear boy, after a hard day in the cruel hot city. Alack!"
moaned Mrs. Maggie as she billowed across to Mr. Vandeford's door and
knocked. Then she paused and knocked again. From neither knock did she
receive an answer as the moment was just about the one in which he had
boarded the New York bound train a half mile up the beach down which Mr.
Dennis Farraday was racing.
</p><p>When a search of the unresponsive room had convinced the Violet of his
flight, for a moment her eyes were stormy, then her face cleared with a
smile of delight, and as she padded back to her room and the waiting
Susette, to herself she purred:
</p><p>"Nobody can beat my luck."
