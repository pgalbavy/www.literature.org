<P>
For two days Tarzan of the Apes had been hunting leisurely
to the north, and swinging in a wide circle, he had re-
turned to within a short distance of the clearing where he
had left Bertha Kircher and the young lieutenant. He had spent
the night in a large tree that overhung the river only a short
distance from the clearing, and now in the early morning
hours he was crouching at the water's edge waiting for an
opportunity to capture Pisah, the fish, thinking that he would
take it back with him to the hut where the girl could cook it
for herself and her companion.
<P>
Motionless as a bronze statue was the wily ape-man, for
well he knew how wary is Pisah, the fish. The slightest move-
ment would frighten him away and only by infinite patience
might he be captured at all. Tarzan depended upon his own
quickness and the suddenness of his attack, for he had no
bait or hook. His knowledge of the ways of the denizens of
the water told him where to wait for Pisah. It might be a
minute or it might be an hour before the fish would swim into
the little pool above which he crouched, but sooner or later
one would come. That the ape-man knew, so with the pa-
tience of the beast of prey he waited for his quarry.
<P>
At last there was a glint of shiny scales. Pisah was coming.
In a moment he would be within reach and then with the
swiftness of light two strong, brown hands would plunge into
the pool and seize him, but, just at the moment that the fish
was about to come within reach, there was a great crashing in
the underbrush behind the ape-man. Instantly Pisah was
gone and Tarzan, growling, had wheeled about to face what-
ever creature might be menacing him. The moment that he
turned he saw that the author of the disturbance was Zu-tag.
<P>
"What does Zu-tag want?" asked the ape-man.
<P>
"Zu-tag comes to the water to drink," replied the ape.
<P>
"Where is the tribe?" asked Tarzan.
<P>
"They are hunting for pisangs and scimatines farther back
in the forest," replied Zu-tag.
<P>
"And the Tarmangani she and bull --" asked Tarzan, "are
they safe?"
<P>
"They have gone away," replied Zu-tag. "Kudu has come
out of his lair twice since they left."
<P>
"Did the tribe chase them away?" asked Tarzan.
<P>
"No," replied the ape. "We did not see them go. We do
not know why they left."
<P>
Tarzan swung quickly through the trees toward the clearing.
The hut and boma were as he had left them, but there was no
sign of either the man or the woman. Crossing the clearing, he
entered the boma and then the hut. Both were empty, and his
trained nostrils told him that they had been gone for at
least two days. As he was about to leave the hut he saw a
paper pinned upon the wall with a sliver of wood and taking
it down, he read:
<P>
<P>
After what you told me about Miss Kircher, and knowing
that you dislike her, I feel that it is not fair to her and to
you
that we should impose longer upon you. I know that our
presence is keeping you from continuing your journey to the
west coast, and so I have decided that it is better for us to
try and reach the white settlements immediately without im-
posing further upon you. We both thank you for your kind-
ness and protection. If there was any way that I might repay
the obligation I feel, I should be only too glad to do so.
<P>
<P>
It was signed by Lieutenant Harold Percy Smith-Oldwick.
<P>
Tarzan shrugged his shoulders, crumpled the note in his
hand and tossed it aside. He felt a certain sense of relief
from responsibility and was glad that they had taken the
matter out of his hands. They were gone and would for-
get, but somehow he could not forget. He walked out across
the boma and into the clearing. He felt uneasy and restless.
Once he started toward the north in response to a sudden
determination to continue his way to the west coast. He
would follow the winding river toward the north a few miles
where its course turned to the west and then on toward its
source across a wooded plateau and up into the foothills and
the mountains. Upon the other side of the range he would
search for a stream running downward toward the west coast,
and thus following the rivers he would be sure of game and
water in plenty.
<P>
But he did not go far. A dozen steps, perhaps, and he came
to a sudden stop. "He is an Englishman," he muttered, "and
the other is a woman. They can never reach the settlements
without my help. I could not kill her with my own hands
when I tried, and if I let them go on alone, I will have killed
her just as surely as though I had run my knife into her heart.
No," and again he  shook his head. "Tarzan of the Apes is a
fool and a weak, old woman," and he turned back toward the
south.
<P>
Manu, the monkey, had seen the two Tarmangani pass two
days before. Chattering and scolding, he told Tarzan all about
it. They had gone in the direction of the village of the
Gomangani, that much had Manu seen with his own eyes, so
the ape-man swung on through the jungle in a southerly direc-
tion and though with no concentrated effort to follow the spoor
of those he trailed, he passed numerous evidences that they
had gone this way -- faint suggestions of their scent spoor
clung lightly to leaf or branch or bole that one or the other
had touched, or in the earth of the trail their feet had trod,
and where the way wound through the gloomy depth of dank
forest, the impress of their shoes still showed occasionally in
the damp mass of decaying vegetation that floored the way.
<P>
An inexplicable urge spurred Tarzan to increasing, speed.
The same still, small voice that chided him for having neg-
lected them seemed constantly whispering that they were in
dire need of him now. Tarzan's conscience was troubling him,
which accounted for the fact that he compared himself to a
weak, old woman, for the ape-man, reared in savagery and
inured to hardships and cruelty, disliked to admit any of the
gentler traits that in reality were his birthright.
<P>
The trail made a detour to the east of the village of the
Wamabos, and then returned to the wide elephant path nearer
to the river, where it continued in a southerly direction for
several miles. At last there came to the ears of the ape-man
a peculiar whirring, throbbing sound. For an instant he
paused, listening intently, "An aeroplane!" he muttered, and
hastened forward at greatly increased speed.
<P>
When Tarzan of the Apes finally reached the edge of the
meadowland where Smith-Oldwick's plane had landed, he
took in the entire scene in one quick glance and grasped the
situation, although he could scarce give credence to the things
he saw. Bound and helpless, the English officer lay upon the
ground at one side of the meadow, while around him stood
a number of the black deserters from the German command.
Tarzan had seen these men before and knew who they were.
Coming toward him down the meadow was an aeroplane
piloted by the black Usanga and in the seat behind the pilot
was the white girl, Bertha Kircher. How it befell that the
ignorant savage could operate the plane, Tarzan could not
guess nor had he time in which to speculate upon the subject.
His knowledge of Usanga, together with the position of the
white man, told him that the black sergeant was attempting
to carry off the white girl. Why he should be doing this when
he had her in his power and had also captured and secured
the only creature in the jungle who might wish to defend her
in so far as the black could know, Tarzan could not guess, for
he knew nothing of Usanga's twenty-four dream wives nor of
the black's fear of the horrid temper of Naratu, his present
mate. He did not know, then, that Usanga had determined
to fly away with the white girl never to return, and to put so
great a distance between himself and Naratu that the latter
never could find him again; but it was this very thing that
was in the black's mind although not even his own warriors
guessed it. He had told them that he would take the captive
to a sultan of the north and there obtain a great price for her
and that when he returned they should have some of the spoils.
<P>
These things Tarzan did not know. All he knew was what
he saw -- a Negro attempting to fly away with a white girl.
Already the machine was slowly leaving the ground. In a
moment more it would rise swiftly out of reach. At first Tar-
zan thought of fitting an arrow to his bow and slaying Usanga,
but as quickly he abandoned the idea because he knew that
the moment the pilot was slain the machine, running wild,
would dash the girl to death among the trees.
<P>
There was but one way in which he might hope to succor
her -- a way which if it failed must send him to instant death
and yet he did not hesitate in an attempt to put it into execu-
tion.
<P>
Usanga did not see him, being too intent upon the unac-
customed duties of a pilot, but the blacks across the meadow
saw him and they ran forward with loud and savage cries
and menacing rifles to intercept him. They saw a giant white
man leap from the branches of a tree to the turf and race
rapidly toward the plane. They saw him take a long grass
rope from about his shoulders as he ran. They saw the noose
swinging in an undulating circle above his head. They saw
the white girl in the machine glance down and discover him.
<P>
Twenty feet above the running ape-man soared the huge
plane. The open noose shot up to meet it, and the girl, half
guessing the ape-man's intentions, reached out and caught
the noose and, bracing herself, clung tightly to it with both
hands. Simultaneously Tarzan was dragged from his feet
and the plane lurched sideways in response to the new strain.
Usanga clutched wildly at the control and the machine shot
upward at a steep angle. Dangling at the end of the rope the
ape-man swung pendulum-like in space. The Englishman,
lying bound upon the ground, had been a witness of all these
happenings. His heart stood still as he saw Tarzan's body
hurtling through the air toward the tree tops among which it
seemed he must inevitably crash; but the plane was rising
rapidly, so that the beast-man cleared the top-most branches.
Then slowly, hand over hand, he climbed toward the fuselage.
The girl, clinging desperately to the noose, strained every
muscle to hold the great weight dangling at the lower end of
the rope.
<P>
Usanga, all unconscious of what was going on behind him,
drove the plane higher and higher into the air.
<P>
Tarzan glanced downward. Below him the tree tops and
the river passed rapidly to the rear and only a slender grass
rope and the muscles of a frail girl stood between him and the
death yawning there thousands of feet below.
<P>
It seemed to Bertha Kircher that the fingers of her hands
were dead. The numbness was running up her arms to her
elbows. How much longer she could cling to the straining
strands she could not guess. It seemed to her that those
lifeless fingers must relax at any instant and then, when she
had about given up hope, she saw a strong brown hand reach
up and grasp the side of the fuselage. Instantly the weight
upon the rope was removed and a moment later Tarzan of
the Apes raised his body above the side and threw a leg over
the edge. He glanced forward at Usanga and then, placing
his mouth close to the girl's ear he cried: "Have you ever
piloted a plane?" The girl nodded a quick affirmative.
<P>
"Have you the courage to climb up there beside the black
and seize the control while I take care of him?"
<P>
The girl looked toward Usanga and shuddered. "Yes," she
replied, "but my feet are bound."
<P>
Tarzan drew his hunting knife from its sheath and reaching
down, severed the thongs that bound her ankles. Then the
girl unsnapped the strap that held her to her seat. With one
hand Tarzan grasped the girl's arm and steadied her as the
two crawled slowly across the few feet which intervened be-
tween the two seats. A single slight tip of the plane would
have cast them both into eternity. Tarzan realized that only
through a miracle of chance could they reach Usanga and
effect the change in pilots and yet he knew that that chance
must be taken, for in the brief moments since he had first seen
the plane, he had realized that the black was almost without
experience as a pilot and that death surely awaited them in
any event should the black sergeant remain at the control.
<P>
The first intimation Usanga had that all was not well with
him was when the girl slipped suddenly to his side and
grasped the control and at the same instant steel-like fingers
seized his throat. A brown hand shot down with a keen
blade and severed the strap about his waist and giant muscles
lifted him bodily from his seat. Usanga clawed the air and
shrieked but he was helpless as a babe. Far below the
watchers in the meadow could see the aeroplane careening
in the sky, for with the change of control it had taken a sudden
dive. They saw it right itself and, turning in a short circle,
return in their direction, but it was so far above them and
the light of the sun so strong that they could see nothing of
what was going on within the fuselage; but presently Lieuten-
ant Smith-Oldwick gave a gasp of dismay as he saw a human
body plunge downward from the plane. Turning and twisting
in mid-air it fell with ever-increasing velocity and the English-
man held his breath as the thing hurtled toward them.
<P>
With a muffled thud it flattened upon the turf near the
center of the meadow, and when at last the Englishman could
gain the courage to again turn his eyes upon it, he breathed
a fervent prayer of thanks, for the shapeless mass that lay
upon the blood-stained turf was covered with an ebon hide.
Usanga had reaped his reward.
<P>
Again and again the plane circled above the meadow. The
blacks, at first dismayed at the death of their leader, were
now worked to a frenzy of rage and a determination to be
avenged. The girl and the ape-man saw them gather in a
knot about the body of their fallen chief. They saw as they
circled above the meadow the black fists shaken at them, and
the rifles brandishing a menace toward them. Tarzan still
clung to the fuselage directly behind the pilot's seat. His
face was close beside Bertha Kircher's, and at the top of his
voice, above the noise of propeller, engine and exhaust, he
screamed a few words of instruction into her ear.
<P>
As the girl grasped the significance of his words she paled,
but her lips set in a hard line and her eyes shone with a sud-
den fire of  determination as she dropped the plane to within
a few feet of the ground and at the opposite end of the
meadow from the blacks and then at full speed bore down
upon the savages. So quickly the plane came that Usanga's
men had no time to escape it after they realized its menace.
It touched the ground just as it struck among them and mowed
through them, a veritable juggernaut of destruction. When
it came to rest at the edge of the forest the ape-man leaped
quickly to the ground and ran toward the young lieutenant,
and as he went he glanced at the spot where the warriors had
stood, ready to defend himself if necessary, but there was
none there to oppose him. Dead and dying they lay strewn
for fifty feet along the turf.
<P>
By the time Tarzan had freed the Englishman the girl
joined them. She tried to voice her thanks to the ape-man
but he silenced her with a gesture.
<P>
"You saved yourself," he insisted, "for had you been unable
to pilot the plane, I could not have helped you, and now," he
said, "you two have the means of returning to the settlements.
The day is still young. You can easily cover the distance in a
few hours if you have sufficient petrol." He looked inquir-
ingly toward the aviator.
<P>
Smith-Oldwick nodded his head affirmatively. "I have
plenty," he replied.
<P>
"Then go at once," said the ape-man. "Neither of you
belong in the jungle." A slight smile touched his lips as he
spoke.
<P>
The girl and the Englishman smiled too. "This jungle is
no place for us at least," said Smith-Oldwick, "and it is no
place for any other white man. Why don't you come back
to civilization with us?"
<P>
Tarzan shook his head. "I prefer the jungle," he said.
<P>
The aviator dug his toe into the ground and still looking
down, blurted something which he evidently hated to say.
"If it is a matter of living, old top," he said, "er -- money, er
--
you know --"
<P>
Tarzan laughed. "No" he said. "I know what you are
trying to say. It is not that. I was born in the jungle. I have
lived all my life in the jungle, and I shall die in the jungle.
I do not wish to live or die elsewhere."
<P>
The others shook their heads. They could not understand
him.
<P>
"Go," said the ape-man. "The quicker you go, the quicker
you will reach safety."
<P>
They walked to the plane together. Smith-Oldwick pressed
the ape-man's hand and clambered into the pilot's seat.
"Good-bye," said the girl as she extended her hand to Tarzan.
"Before I go won't you tell me you don't hate me any
more?" Tarzan's face clouded. Without a word he picked
her up and lifted her to her place behind the Englishman. An
expression of pain crossed Bertha Kircher's face. The motor
started and a moment later the two were being borne rapidly
toward the east.
<P>
In the center of the meadow stood the ape-man watching
them. "It is too bad that she is a German and a spy," he said,
"for she is very hard to hate."
