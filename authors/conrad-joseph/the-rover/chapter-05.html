<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>As Peyrol and the lieutenant had surmised from the report of
the gun, the English ship which the evening before was lying in
Hyères Roads had got under way after dark. The light airs had
taken her as far as the Petite Passe in the early part of the
night, and then had abandoned her to the breathless moonlight
in which, bereft of all motion, she looked more like a white monument
of stone dwarfed by the darkling masses of land on either hand
than a fabric famed for its swiftness in attack or in flight.</p>

<p>Her captain was a man of about forty, with clean-shaven, full
cheeks and mobile thin lips which he had a trick of compressing
mysteriously before he spoke and sometimes also at the end of
his speeches. He was alert in his movements and nocturnal in his
habits.</p>

<p>Directly he found that the calm had taken complete possession
of the night and was going to last for hours Captain Vincent assumed
his favourite attitude of leaning over the rail. It was then some
time after midnight and in the pervading stillness the moon, riding
on a speckless sky, seemed to pour her enchantment on an uninhabited
planet. Captain Vincent did not mind the moon very much. Of course
it made his ship visible from both shores of the Petite Passe.
But after nearly a year of constant service in command of the
extreme lookout ship of Admiral Nelson’s blockading fleet he knew
the emplacement of almost every gun of the shore defences. Where
the breeze had left him he was safe from the biggest gun of the
few that were mounted on Porquerolles. On the Giens side of the
pass he knew for certain there was not even a popgun mounted anywhere.
His long familiarity with that part of the coast had imbued him
with the belief that he knew the habits of its population thoroughly.
The gleams of light in their houses went out very early, and Captain
Vincent felt convinced that they were all in their beds, including
the gunners of the batteries who belonged to the local militia.
Their interest in the movements of <em>H.M.’</em>s twenty-two
gun sloop <em>Amelia</em> had grown stale by custom. She never
interfered with their private affairs, and allowed the small coasting
craft to go to and fro unmolested. They would have wondered if
she had been more than two days away. Captain Vincent used to
say grimly that the Hyères Roadstead had become like a second
home to him.</p>

<p>For an hour or so Captain Vincent mused a bit on his real home,
on matters of service and other unrelated things, then getting
into motion in a very wide-awake manner, he superintended himself
the dispatch of that boat the existence of which had been acutely
surmised by Lieutenant Réal and was a matter of no doubt whatever
to old Peyrol. As to her mission, it had nothing to do with catching
fish for the captain’s breakfast. It was the captain’s own gig,
a very fast pulling boat. She was already alongside with her crew
in her when the officer, who was going in charge, was beckoned
to by the captain. He had a cutlass at his side and a brace of
pistols in his belt, and there was a business-like air about him
that showed he had been on such service before.</p>

<p>"This calm will last a good many hours," said the captain. "In
this tideless sea you are certain to find the ship very much where
she is now, but closer in shore. The attraction of the land&mdash;you
know."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The land does attract."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, she may be allowed to put her side against any of
these rocks. There would be no more danger than alongside a quay
with a sea like this. Just look at the water in the pass, Mr.
Bolt. Like the floor of a ballroom. Pull close along shore when
you return. I’ll expect you back at dawn."</p>

<p>Captain Vincent paused suddenly. A doubt crossed his mind as
to the wisdom of this nocturnal expedition. The hammer-head of
the peninsula with its sea-face invisible from both sides of the
coast was an ideal spot for a secret landing. Its lonely character
appealed to his imagination, which in the first instance had been
stimulated by a chance remark of Mr. Bolt himself.</p>

<p>The fact was that the week before, when the Amelia was cruising
off the peninsula, Bolt, looking at the coast, mentioned that
he knew that part of it well; he had actually been ashore there
a good many years ago, while serving with Lord Howe’s fleet. He
described the nature of the path, the aspect of a little village
on the reverse slope, and had much to say about a certain farmhouse
where he had been more than once, and had even stayed for twenty-four
hours at a time on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>This had aroused Captain Vincent’s curiosity. He sent for Bolt
and had a long conversation with him. He listened with great interest
to Bolt’s story, how one day a man was seen from the deck of the
ship in which Bolt was serving then, waving a white sheet or tablecloth
amongst the rocks at the water’s edge. It might have been a trap;
but, as the man seemed alone and the shore was within range of
the ship’s guns, a boat was sent to take him off.</p>

<p>"And that, sir," Bolt pursued impressively, "was, I verily believe,
the very first communication that Lord Howe had from the royalists
in Toulon." Afterwards Bolt described to Captain Vincent the meetings
of the Toulon royalists with the officers of the fleet. From the
back of the farm he, Bolt himself, had often watched for hours
the entrance of the Toulon harbour on the lookout for the boat
bringing over the royalist emissaries. Then he would make an agreed
signal to the advanced squadron and some English officers would
land on their side and meet the Frenchmen at the farmhouse. It
was as simple as that. The people of the farmhouse, husband and
wife, were well-to-do, good class altogether, and staunch royalists.
He had got to know them well.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent wondered whether the same people were still living
there. Bolt could see no reason why they shouldn’t be. It wasn’t
more than ten years ago, and they were by no means an old couple.
As far as he could make out, the farm was their own property.
He, Bolt, knew only very few French words at that time. It was
much later, after he had been made a prisoner and kept inland
in France till the Peace of Amiens, that he had picked up a smattering
of the lingo. His captivity had done away with his feeble chance
of promotion, he could not help remarking. Bolt was a master’s
mate still.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent, in common with a good many officers of all ranks
in Lord Nelson’s fleet, had his misgivings about the system of
distant blockade from which the Admiral apparently would not depart.
Yet one could not blame Lord Nelson. Everybody in the fleet understood
that what was in his mind was the destruction of the enemy; and
if the enemy was closely blockaded he would never come out to
be destroyed. On the other hand it was clear that as things were
conducted the French had too many chances left them to slip out
unobserved and vanish from all human knowledge for months. Those
possibilities were a constant worry to Captain Vincent, who had
thrown himself with the ardour of passion into the special duty
with which he was entrusted. Oh, for a pair of eyes fastened night
and day on the entrance of the harbour of Toulon! Oh, for the
power to look at the very state of French ships and into the very
secrets of French minds!</p>

<p>But he said nothing of this to Bolt. He only observed that the
character of the French Government was changed and that the minds
of the royalist people in the farmhouse might have changed too,
since they had got back the exercise of their religion. Bolt’s
answer was that he had had a lot to do with royalists, in his
time, on board Lord Howe’s fleet, both before and after Toulon
was evacuated. All sorts, men and women, barbers and noblemen,
sailors and tradesmen; almost every kind of royalist one could
think of; and his opinion was that a royalist never changed. As
to the place itself, he only wished the captain had seen it. It
was the sort of spot that nothing could change. He made bold to
say that it would be just the same a hundred years hence.</p>

<p>The earnestness of his officer caused Captain Vincent to look
hard at him. He was a man of about his own age, but while Vincent
was a comparatively young captain, Bolt was an old master’s mate.
Each understood the other perfectly. Captain Vincent fidgeted
for a while and then observed abstractedly that he was not a man
to put a noose round a dog’s neck, let alone a good seaman’s.</p>

<p>This cryptic pronouncement caused no wonder to appear in Bolt’s
attentive gaze. He only became a little thoughtful before he said
in the same abstracted tone that an officer in uniform was not
likely to be hanged for a spy. The service was risky, of course.
It was necessary, for its success, that, assuming the same people
were there, it should be undertaken by a man well known to the
inhabitants. Then he added that he was certain of being recognized.
And while he enlarged on the extremely good terms he had been
on with the owners of the farm, especially the farmer’s wife,
a comely motherly woman, who had been very kind to him, and had
all her wits about her, Captain Vincent, looking at the master’s
mate’s bushy whiskers, thought that these in themselves were enough
to ensure recognition. This impression was so strong that he had
asked point-blank: "You haven’t altered the growth of the hair
on your face, Mr. Bolt, since then?"</p>

<p>There was just a touch of indignation in Bolt’s negative reply;
for he was proud of his whiskers. He declared he was ready to
take the most desperate chances for the service of his king and
his country.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent added: "For the sake of Lord Nelson, too." One
understood well what his Lordship wished to bring about by that
blockade at sixty leagues off. He was talking to a sailor, and
there was no need to say any more. Did Bolt think that he could
persuade those people to conceal him in their house on that lonely
shore end of the peninsula for some considerable time? Bolt thought
it was the easiest thing in the world. He would simply go up there
and renew the old acquaintance, but he did not mean to do that
in a reckless manner. It would have to be done at night, when
of course there would be no one about. He would land just where
he used to before, wrapped up in a Mediterranean sailor’s cloak&mdash;he
had one of his own&mdash;over his uniform, and simply go straight to
the door, at which he would knock. Ten to one the farmer himself
would come down to open it. He knew enough French by now, he hoped,
to persuade those people to conceal him in some room having a
view in the right direction; and there he would stick day after
day on the watch, taking a little exercise in the middle of the
night, ready to live on mere bread and water if necessary, so
as not to arouse suspicion amongst the farmhands. And who knows
if, with the farmer’s help, he could not get some news of what
was going on actually within the port. Then from time to time
he could go down in the dead of night, signal to the ship and
make his report. Bolt expressed the hope that the <em>Amelia</em>
would remain as much as possible in sight of the coast. It would
cheer him up to see her about. Captain Vincent naturally assented.
He pointed out to Bolt, however, that his post would become most
important exactly when the ship had been chased away or driven
by the weather off her station, as could very easily happen. "You
would be then the eyes of Lord Nelson’s fleet, Mr. Bolt&mdash;think
of that. The actual eyes of Lord Nelson’s fleet!"</p>

<p>After dispatching his officer, Captain Vincent spent the night
on deck. The break of day came at last, much paler than the moonlight
which it replaced. And still no boat. And again Captain Vincent
asked himself if he had not acted indiscreetly. Impenetrable,
and looking as fresh as if he had just come up on deck, he argued
the point with himself till the rising sun clearing the ridge
on Porquerolles Island flashed its level rays upon his ship with
her dew-darkened sails and dripping rigging. He roused himself
then to tell his first lieutenant to get the boats out to tow
the ship away from the shore. The report of the gun he ordered
to be fired expressed simply his irritation. The <em>Amelia</em>,
pointing towards the middle of the Passe, was moving at a snail’s
pace behind her string of boats. Minutes passed. And then suddenly
Captain Vincent perceived his boat pulling back in shore according
to orders. When nearly abreast of the ship, she darted away, making
for her side. Mr. Bolt clambered on board, alone, ordering the
gig to go ahead and help with the towing. Captain Vincent, standing
apart on the quarter-deck, received him with a grimly questioning
look.</p>

<p>Mr. Bolt’s first words were to the effect that he believed the
confounded spot to be bewitched. Then he glanced at the group
of officers on the other side of the quarter-deck. Captain Vincent
led the way to his cabin. There he turned and looked at his officer,
who, with an air of distraction, mumbled: "There are night-walkers
there."</p>

<p>"Come, Bolt, what the devil have you seen? Did you get near the
house at all?"</p>

<p>"I got within twenty yards of the door, sir," said Bolt. And
encouraged by the captain’s much less ferocious&mdash;"Well?" began
his tale. He did not pull up to the path which he knew, but to
a little bit of beach on which he told his men to haul up the
boat and wait for him. The beach was concealed by a thick growth
of bushes on the landward side and by some rocks from the sea.
Then he went to what he called the ravine, still avoiding the
path, so that as a matter of fact he made his way up on his hands
and knees mostly, very carefully and slowly amongst the loose
stones, till by holding on to a bush he brought his eyes on a
level with the piece of flat ground in front of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>The familiar aspect of the buildings, totally unchanged from
the time when he had played his part in what appeared as a most
successful operation at the beginning of the war, inspired Bolt
with great confidence in the success of his present enterprise,
vague as it was, but the great charm of which lay, no doubt, in
mental associations with his younger years. Nothing seemed easier
than to stride across the forty yards of open ground and rouse
the farmer whom he remembered so well, the well-to-do man, a grave,
sagacious royalist in his humble way; certainly, in Bolt’s view,
no traitor to his country, and preserving so well his dignity
in ambiguous circumstances. To Bolt’s simple vision neither that
man nor his wife could have changed.</p>

<p>In this view of Arlette’s parents Bolt was influenced by the
consciousness of there having been no change in himself. He was
the same Jack Bolt, and everything around him was the same as
if he had left the spot only yesterday. Already he saw himself
in the kitchen which he knew so well, seated by the light of a
single candle before a glass of wine and talking his best French
to that worthy farmer of sound principles. The whole thing was
as well as done. He imagined himself a secret inmate of that building,
closely confined indeed, but sustained by the possible great results
of his watchfulness, in many ways more comfortable than on board
the <em>Amelia</em> and with the glorious consciousness that he
was, in Captain Vincent’s phrase, the actual physical eyes of
the Fleet.</p>

<p>He didn’t, of course, talk of his private feelings to Captain
Vincent. All those thoughts and emotions were compressed in the
space of not much more than a minute or two while, holding on
with one hand to his bush and having got a good foothold for one
of his feet, he indulged in that pleasant anticipatory sense of
success. In the old days the farmer’s wife used to be a light
sleeper. The farmhands which, he remembered, lived in the village
or were distributed in stables and outhouses, did not give him
any concern. He wouldn’t need to knock heavily. He pictured to
himself the farmer’s wife sitting up in bed, listening, then rousing
her husband, who, as likely as not, would take the gun standing
against the dresser downstairs and come to the door.</p>

<p>And then everything would be all right.... But perhaps ... yes!
It was just as likely the farmer would simply open the window
and hold a parley. That really was most likely. Naturally. In
his place Bolt felt he would do that very thing. Yes, that was
what a man in a lonely house, in the middle of the night, would
do most naturally. And he imagined himself whispering mysteriously
his answers up the wall to the obvious questions&mdash;"Ami"&mdash;"Bolt"&mdash;"Ouvrez-moi"&mdash;"vive
le roi"&mdash;or things of that sort. And in sequence to those vivid
images it occurred to Bolt that the best thing he could do would
be to throw small stones against the window shutter, the sort
of sound most likely to rouse a light sleeper. He wasn’t quite
sure which window on the floor above the ground floor was that
of those people’s bedroom, but there were anyhow only three of
them. In a moment he would have sprung up from his foothold on
to the level if, raising his eyes for another look at the front
of the house, he had not perceived that one of the windows was
already open. How he could have failed to notice that before,
he couldn’t explain.</p>

<p>He confessed to Captain Vincent in the course of his narrative
that "this open window, sir, checked me dead. In fact, sir, it
shook my confidence, for you know, sir, that no native of these
parts would dream of sleeping with his window open. It struck
me that there was something wrong there; and I remained where
I was."</p>

<p>That fascination of repose, of secretive friendliness, which
houses present at night, was gone. By the power of an open window,
a black square in the moon-lighted wall, the farmhouse took on
the aspect of a man-trap. Bolt assured Captain Vincent that the
window would not have stopped him; he would have gone on all the
same, though with an uncertain mind. But while he was thinking
it out there glided without a sound before his irresolute eyes
from somewhere a white vision&mdash;a woman. He could see her black
hair flowing down her back. A woman whom anybody would have been
excused for taking for a ghost. "I won’t say that she froze my
blood, sir, but she made me cold all over for a moment. Lots of
people have seen ghosts, at least they say so, and I have an open
mind about that. She was a weird thing to look at in the moonlight.
She did not act like a sleep-walker either. If she had not come
out of a grave, then she had jumped out of bed. But when she stole
back and hid herself round the corner of the house I knew she
was not a ghost. She could not have seen me. There she stood in
the black shadow watching for something&mdash;or waiting for somebody,"
added Bolt in a grim tone. "She looked crazy," he conceded charitably.</p>

<p>One thing was clear to him: there had been changes in that farmhouse
since his time. Bolt resented them, as if that time had been only
last week. The woman concealed round the corner remained in his
full view, watchful, as if only waiting for him to show himself
in the open, to run off screeching and rouse all the countryside.
Bolt came quickly to the conclusion that he must withdraw from
the slope. On lowering himself from his first position he had
the misfortune to dislodge a stone. This circumstance precipitated
his retreat. In a very few minutes he found himself by the shore.
He paused to listen. Above him, up the ravine and all round amongst
the rocks, everything was perfectly still. He walked along in
the direction of his boat. There was nothing for it but to get
away quietly and perhaps....</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Bolt, I fear we shall have to give up our plan," interrupted
Captain Vincent at that point. Bolt’s assent came reluctantly,
and then he braced himself to confess that this was not the worst.
Before the astonished face of Captain Vincent he hastened to blurt
it out. He was very sorry, he could in no way account for it,
but&mdash;he had lost a man.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent seemed unable to believe his ears. "What do you
say? Lost a man out of my boat’s crew!" He was profoundly shocked.
Bolt was correspondingly distressed. He narrated that, shortly
after he had left them, the seamen had heard, or imagined they
had heard, some faint and peculiar noises somewhere within the
cove. The coxswain sent one of the men, the oldest of the boat’s
crew, along the shore to ascertain whether their boat hauled on
the beach could be seen from the other side of the cove. The man&mdash;it
was Symons&mdash;departed crawling on his hands and knees to make the
circuit and, well&mdash;he had not returned. This was really the reason
why the boat was so late in getting back to the ship. Of course
Bolt did not like to give up the man. It was inconceivable that
Symons should have deserted. He had left his cutlass behind and
was completely unarmed, but had he been suddenly pounced upon
he surely would have been able to let out a yell that could have
been heard all over the cove. But till daybreak a profound stillness,
in which it seemed a whisper could have been heard for miles,
had reigned over the coast. It was as if Symons had been spirited
away by some supernatural means, without a scuffle, without a
cry. For it was inconceivable that he should have ventured inland
and got captured there. It was equally inconceivable that there
should have been on that particular night men ready to pounce
upon Symons and knock him on the head so neatly as not to let
him give a groan even.</p>

<p>Captain Vincent said: "All this is very fantastical, Mr. Bolt,"
and compressed his lips firmly for a moment before he continued:
"But not much more than your woman. I suppose you did see something
real...."</p>

<p>"I tell you, sir, she stood there in full moonlight for ten minutes
within a stone’s throw of me," protested Bolt with a sort of desperation.
"She seemed to have jumped out of bed only to look at the house.
If she had a petticoat over her night-shift, that was all. Her
back was to me. When she moved away I could not make out her face
properly. Then she went to stand in the shadow of the house."</p>

<p>"On the watch," suggested Captain Vincent.</p>

<p>"Looked like it, sir," confessed Bolt.</p>

<p>"So there must have been somebody about," concluded Captain Vincent
with assurance.</p>

<p>Bolt murmured a reluctant, "Must have been." He had expected
to get into enormous trouble over this affair and was much relieved
by the captain’s quiet attitude. "I hope, sir, you approve of
my conduct in not attempting to look for Symons at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You acted prudently by not advancing inland," said the
captain.</p>

<p>"I was afraid of spoiling our chances to carry out your plan,
sir, by disclosing our presence on shore. And that could not have
been avoided. Moreover, we were only five in all and not properly
armed."</p>

<p>"The plan has gone down before your night-walker, Mr. Bolt,"
Captain Vincent declared dryly. "But we must try to find out what
has become of our man if it can be done without risking too much."</p>

<p>"By landing a large party this very next night we could surround
the house," Bolt suggested. "If we find friends there, well and
good. If enemies, then we could carry off some of them on board
for exchange perhaps. I am almost sorry I did not go back and
kidnap that wench&mdash;whoever she was," he added recklessly. "Ah!
if it had only been a man!"</p>

<p>"No doubt there was a man not very far off," said Captain Vincent
equably. "That will do, Mr. Bolt. You had better go and get some
rest now."</p>

<p>Bolt was glad to obey, for he was tired and hungry after his
dismal failure. What vexed him most was its absurdity. Captain
Vincent, though he too had passed a sleepless night, felt too
restless to remain below. He followed his officer on deck.</p>
