<p>Observing the monotonously proper behavior of the sun, man had
an absurd idea and invented Time. Becoming still more absurd,
man said, "So much shall be a day; such and such shall be a week.
All weeks shall be the same length." Yet every baby knows better!
How long for Johnnie Watson, for Joe Bullitt, for Wallace Banks&mdash;how
long for William Sylvanus Baxter was the last week of Miss Pratt?
No one can answer. How long was that week for Mr. Parcher? Again
the mind is staggered.</p>

<p>Many people, of course, considered it to be a week of average
size. Among these was Jane.</p>

<p>Throughout seven days which brought some tense moments to the
Baxter household, Jane remained calm; and she was still calm upon
the eighth morning as she stood in the front yard of her own place
of residence, gazing steadily across the street. The object of
her grave attention was an ample brick house, newly painted white
after repairs and enlargements so inspiring to Jane's faculty
for suggesting better ways of doing things, that the workmen had
learned to address her, with a slight bitterness, as "Madam President."</p>

<p>Throughout the process of repair, and until the very last of
the painting, Jane had considered this house to be as much her
property as anybody's; for children regard as ownerless all vacant
houses and all houses in course of construction or radical alteration.
Nothing short of furniture&mdash;intimate furniture in considerable
quantity&mdash;hints that the public is not expected. However, such
a hint, or warning, was conveyed to Jane this morning, for two
"express wagons" were standing at the curb with their backs impolitely
toward the brick house; and powerful-voiced men went surging to
and fro under fat arm-chairs, mahogany tables, disarticulated
bedsteads, and baskets of china and glassware; while a harassed
lady appeared in the outer doorway, from time to time, with gestures
of lamentation and entreaty. Upon the sidewalk, between the wagons
and the gate, was a broad wet spot, vaguely circular, with a partial
circumference of broken glass and extinct goldfish.</p>

<p>Jane was forced to conclude that the brick house did belong to
somebody, after all. Wherefore, she remained in her own yard,
a steadfast spectator, taking nourishment into her system at regular
intervals. This was beautifully automatic: in each hand she held
a slice of bread, freely plastered over with butter, apple sauce,
and powdered sugar; and when she had taken somewhat from the right
hand, that hand slowly descended with its burden, while, simultaneously,
the left began to rise, reaching the level of her mouth precisely
at the moment when a little wave passed down her neck, indicating
that the route was clear. Then, having made delivery, the left
hand sank, while the right began to rise again. And, so well had
custom trained Jane's members, never once did she glance toward
either of these faithful hands or the food that it supported;
her gaze was all the while free to remain upon the house across
the way and the great doings before it.</p>

<p>After a while, something made her wide eyes grow wider almost
to their utmost. Nay, the event was of that importance her mechanical
hands ceased to move and stopped stock-still, the right half-way
up, the left half-way down, as if because of sudden motor trouble
within Jane. Her mouth was equally affected, remaining open at
a visible crisis in the performance of its duty. These were the
tokens of her agitation upon beholding the removal of a dolls'
house from one of the wagons. This dolls' house was at least five
feet high, of proportionate breadth and depths the customary absence
of a facade disclosing an interior of four luxurious floors, with
stairways, fireplaces, and wall-paper. Here was a mansion wherein
doll-duchesses, no less, must dwell.</p>

<p>Straightway, a little girl ran out of the open doorway of the
brick house and, with a self-importance concentrated to the point
of shrewishness, began to give orders concerning the disposal
of her personal property, which included (as she made clear) not
only the dolls' mansion, but also three dolls' trunks and a packing-case
of fair size. She was a thin little girl, perhaps half a year
younger than Jane; and she was as soiled, particularly in respect
to hands, brow, chin, and the knees of white stockings, as could
be expected of any busybodyish person of nine or ten whose mother
is house-moving. But she was gifted&mdash;if we choose to put the matter
in the hopeful, sweeter way&mdash;she was gifted with an unusually
loud and shrill voice, and she made herself heard over the strong-voiced
men to such emphatic effect that one of the latter, with the dolls'
mansion upon his back, paused in the gateway to acquaint her with
his opinion that of all the bossy little girls he had ever seen,
heard, or heard of, she was the bossiest.</p>

<p>"<em>THE </em>worst!" he added.</p>

<p>The little girl across the street was of course instantly aware
of Jane, though she pretended not to be; and from the first her
self-importance was in large part assumed for the benefit of the
observer. After a momentary silence, due to her failure to think
of any proper response to the workman who so pointedly criticized
her, she resumed the peremptory direction of her affairs. She
ran in and out of the house, her brow dark with frowns, her shoulders
elevated; and by every means at her disposal she urged her audience
to behold the frightful responsibilities of one who must keep
a thousand things in her head at once, and yet be ready for decisive
action at any instant.</p>

<p>There may have been one weakness in this strong performance:
the artistic sincerity of it was a little discredited by the increasing
frequency with which the artist took note of her effect. During
each of her most impressive moments, she flashed, from the far
corner of her eye, two questions at Jane: "How about <em>THAT
</em>one? Are you still watching Me?"</p>

<p>Then, apparently in the very midst of her cares, she suddenly
and without warning ceased to boss, walked out into the street,
halted, and stared frankly at Jane.</p>

<p>Jane had begun her automatic feeding again. She continued it,
meanwhile seriously returning the stare of the new neighbor. For
several minutes this mutual calm and inoffensive gaze was protracted;
then Jane, after swallowing the last morsel of her supplies, turned
her head away and looked at a tree. The little girl, into whose
eyes some wistfulness had crept, also turned her head and looked
at a tree. After a while, she advanced to the curb on Jane's side
of the street, and, swinging her right foot, allowed it to kick
the curbstone repeatedly.</p>

<p>Jane came out to the sidewalk and began to kick one of the fence-pickets.</p>

<p>"You see that ole fatty?" asked the little girl, pointing to
one of the workmen, thus sufficiently identified.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's the one broke the goldfish," said the little girl. There
was a pause during which she continued to scuff the curbstone
with her shoe, Jane likewise scuffing the fence-picket. "I'm goin'
to have papa get him arrested," added the stranger.</p>

<p>"My papa got two men arrested once," Jane said, calmly. "Two
or three."</p>

<p>The little girl's eyes, wandering upward, took note of Jane's
papa's house, and of a fierce young gentleman framed in an open
window up-stairs. He was seated, wore ink upon his forehead, and
tapped his teeth with a red penholder.</p>

<p>"Who is that?" she asked.</p>

<p>"It's Willie."</p>

<p>"Is it your papa?"</p>

<p>"<em>NO-O-O-O!" </em>Jane exclaimed. "It's <em>WILLIE</em>!"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the little girl, apparently satisfied.</p>

<p>Each now scuffed less energetically with her shoe; feet slowed
down; so did conversation, and, for a time, Jane and the stranger
wrapped themselves in stillness, though there may have been some
silent communing between them. Then the new neighbor placed her
feet far apart and leaned backward upon nothing, curving her front
outward and her remarkably flexible spine inward until a profile
view of her was grandly semicircular.</p>

<p>Jane watched her attentively, but without comment. However, no
one could have doubted that the processes of acquaintance were
progressing favorably.</p>

<p>"Let's go in our yard," said Jane.</p>

<p>The little girl straightened herself with a slight gasp, and
accepted the invitation. Side by side, the two passed through
the open gate, walked gravely forth upon the lawn, and halted,
as by common consent. Jane thereupon placed her feet wide apart
and leaned backward upon nothing, attempting the feat in contortion
just performed by the stranger.</p>

<p>"Look," she said. "Look at ME!"</p>

<p>But she lacked the other's genius, lost her balance, and fell.
Born persistent, she immediately got to her feet and made fresh
efforts.</p>

<p>"No! Look at ME!" the little girl cried, becoming semicircular
again. "This is the way. I call it 'puttin' your stummick out
o' joint.' You haven't got yours out far enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," said Jane, gasping.</p>

<p>"Well, to do it right, you must <em>WALK </em>that way. As soon
as you get your stummick out o' joint, you must begin an' walk.
Look! Like this." And the little girl, having achieved a state
of such convexity that her braided hair almost touched the ground
behind her, walked successfully in that singular attitude.</p>

<p>"I'm walkin'," Jane protested, her face not quite upside down.
"Look! I'M walkin' that way, too. My stummick&mdash;"</p>

<p>There came an outraged shout from above, and a fierce countenance,
stained with ink, protruded from the window.</p>

<p>"Jane!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Stop that! Stop putting your stomach out in front of you like
that! It's disgraceful!"</p>

<p>Both young ladies, looking rather oppressed, resumed the perpendicular.
"Why doesn't he like it?" the stranger asked in a tone of pure
wonder.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jane. "He doesn't like much of anything.
He's seventeen years old."</p>

<p>After that, the two stared moodily at the ground for a little
while, chastened by the severe presence above; then Jane brightened.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> know!" she exclaimed, cozily. "Let's play callers.
Right here by this bush 'll be my house. You come to call on me,
an' we'll talk about our chuldren. You be Mrs. Smith an' I'm Mrs.
Jones." And in the character of a hospitable matron she advanced
graciously toward the new neighbor. "Why, my dear Mrs. <em>SMITH,
</em>come right IN! I <em>THOUGHT </em>you'd call this morning.
I want to tell you about my lovely little daughter. She's only
ten years old, an' says the brightest <em>THINGS! </em>You really
must&mdash;"</p>

<p>But here Jane interrupted herself abruptly, and, hopping behind
the residential bush, peeped over it, not at Mrs. Smith, but at
a boy of ten or eleven who was passing along the sidewalk. Her
expression was gravely interested, somewhat complacent; and Mrs.
Smith was not so lacking in perception that she failed to understand
how completely&mdash;for the time being, at least&mdash;calling was suspended.</p>

<p>The boy whistled briskly, "My country, 'tis of thee," and though
his knowledge of the air failed him when he finished the second
line, he was not disheartened, but began at the beginning again,
continuing repeatedly after this fashion to offset monotony by
patriotism. He whistled loudly; he walked with ostentatious intent
to be at some heavy affair in the distance; his ears were red.
He looked neither to the right nor to the left.</p>

<p>That is, he looked neither to the right nor to the left until
he had passed the Baxters' fence. But when he had gone as far
as the upper corner of the fence beyond, he turned his head and
looked back, without any expression&mdash;except that of a whistler&mdash;at
Jane. And thus, still whistling "My country, 'tis of thee," and
with blank pink face over his shoulder, he proceeded until he
was out of sight.</p>

<p>"Who was that boy?" the new neighbor then inquired.</p>

<p>"It's Freddie," said Jane, placidly. "He's in our Sunday-school.
He's in love of me."</p>

<p>"<em>JANE</em>!"</p>

<p>Again the outraged and ink-stained countenance glared down from
the window.</p>

<p>"What you want?" Jane asked.</p>

<p>"What you <em>MEAN </em>talking about such things?" William demanded.
"In all my life I never heard anything as disgusting! Shame on
you!"</p>

<p>The little girl from across the street looked upward thoughtfully.
"He's mad," she remarked, and, regardless of Jane's previous information,
"It IS your papa, isn't it?" she insisted.</p>

<p>"No!" said Jane, testily. "I told you five times it's my brother
Willie."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the little girl, and, grasping the fact that William's
position was, in dignity and authority, negligible, compared with
that which she had persisted in imagining, she felt it safe to
tint her upward gaze with disfavor. "He acts kind of crazy," she
murmured.</p>

<p>"He's in love of Miss Pratt," said Jane. "She's goin' away to-day.
She said she'd go before, but to-day she IS! Mr. Parcher, where
she visits, he's almost dead, she's stayed so long. She's awful,
I think."</p>

<p>William, to whom all was audible, shouted, hoarsely, "I'll see
to <em>YOU!"  </em>and disappeared from the window.</p>

<p>"Will he come down here?" the little girl asked, taking a step
toward the gate.</p>

<p>"No. He's just gone to call mamma. All she'll do' ll be to tell
us to go play somewheres else. Then we can go talk to Genesis."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Genesis. He's puttin' a load of coal in the cellar window with
a shovel. He's nice."</p>

<p>"What's he put the coal in the window for?"</p>

<p>"He's a colored man," said Jane.</p>

<p>"Shall we go talk to him now?"</p>

<p>"No," Jane said, thoughtfully. "Let's be playin' callers when
mamma comes to tell us to go 'way. What was your name?"</p>

<p>"Rannie."</p>

<p>"No, it wasn't."</p>

<p>"It is too, Rannie," the little girl insisted. "My whole name's
Mary Randolph Kirsted, but my short name's Rannie."</p>

<p>Jane laughed. "What a funny name!" she said. "I didn't mean your
real name; I meant your callers' name. One of us was Mrs. Jones,
and one was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want to be Mrs. Jones," said Rannie.</p>

<p>"Oh, my <em>DEAR </em>Mrs. Jones," Jane began at once, "I want
to tell you about my lovely chuldren. I have two, one only seven
years old, and the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jane!" called Mrs. Baxter from William's window.</p>

<p>"Yes'm?"</p>

<p>"You must go somewhere else to play. Willie's trying to work
at his studies up here, and he says you've disturbed him very
much."</p>

<p>"Yes'm."</p>

<p>The obedient Jane and her friend turned to go, and as they went,
Miss Mary Randolph Kirsted allowed her uplifted eyes to linger
with increased disfavor upon William, who appeared beside Mrs.
Baxter at the window.</p>

<p>"I tell you what let's do," Rannie suggested in a lowered voice.
"He got so fresh with us, an' made your mother come, an' all,
let's&mdash;let's&mdash;"</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>"Let's what?" Jane urged her, in an eager whisper.</p>

<p>"Let's think up somep'n he won't like&mdash;an' DO it!"</p>

<p>They disappeared round a corner of the house, their heads close
together.</p>
