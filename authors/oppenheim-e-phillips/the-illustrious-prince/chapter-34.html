<P>
It was curious how the Prince's sudden departure seemed to affect
almost every member of the little house party. At first it had
been arranged that the Duke, Mr. Haviland, Sir Edward Bransome,
and the Prince should leave in the former's car, the Prince's
following later with the luggage. Then the Duchess, whose eyes
had filled with tears more than once after her whispered
conversation with her husband, announced that she, too, must go
to town. Lady Grace insisted upon accompanying her, and Penelope
reminded them that she was already dressed for travelling and
that, in any case, she meant to be one of the party. Before ten
o'clock they were all on their way to London.
<P>
The Prince sat side by side with Lady Grace, the other two
occupants of the car being the Duke himself and Mr. Haviland. No
one seemed in the least inclined for conversation. The Duke and
Mr. Haviland exchanged a few remarks, but Lady Grace, leaning
back in her seat, her features completely obscured by a thick
veil, declined to talk to any one. The Prince seemed to be the
only one who made any pretence at enjoying the beauty of the
spring morning, who seemed even to be aware of the warm west
wind, the occasional perfume of the hedgeside violets, and the
bluebells which stretched like a carpet in and out of the belts
of wood. Lady Grace's eyes, from beneath her veil, scarcely once
left his face. Perhaps, she thought, these things were merely
allegorical to him. Perhaps his eyes, fixed so steadfastly upon
the distant horizon, were not, as it seemed, following the
graceful outline of that grove of dark green pine trees, but were
indeed searching back into the corners of his life, measuring up
the good and evil of it, asking the eternal question--was it
worth while?
<P>
In the other car, too, silence reigned. Somerfield was the only
one who struggled against the general air of depression.
<P>
"After all," he remarked to Bransome, "I don't see what we're all
so blue about. If  Scotland Yard are right, and the Prince is
really the guilty person they imagine him, I cannot see what
sympathy he deserves. Of course, they look upon this sort of
thing more lightly in his own country, but, after all, he was no
fool. He knew his risks."
<P>
Penelope spoke for the first time since they had left Devenham.
<P>
"If you begin to talk like that, Charlie," she said, "I shall ask
the Duchess to stop the car and put you down here in the road."
<P>
Somerfield laughed, not altogether pleasantly.
<P>
"Seven miles from any railway station," he remarked.
<P>
Penelope shrugged her shoulders.
<P>
"I should not care in the least what happened to you, today or at
any other time," she declared.
<P>
After that, Somerfield held his peace, and a somewhat strained
silence followed. Soon they reached the outskirts of London. Long
before midday they slackened speed, after crossing Battersea
Bridge, and the two cars drew alongside. They had arranged to
separate here, but, curiously enough, no one seemed to care to
start the leave taking.
<P>
"You see the time!" the Prince exclaimed. "It is barely eleven
o'clock. I want you all, if you will, to come with me for ten
minutes only to my house. Tomorrow it will be dismantled. Today I
want you each to choose a keepsake from amongst my treasures.
There are so many ornaments over here, engravings and bronzes
which are called Japanese and which are really only imitations. I
want you to have something, if you will, to remember me by, all
of you, something which is really the handicraft of my country
people."
<P>
The Duke looked for a moment doubtful.
<P>
"It wants an hour to midday," the Prince said, softly. "There is
time."
<P>
They reached St. James' Square in a few minutes. There were no
signs of disturbance. The door flew open at their approach. The
same solemn-faced, quietly moving butler admitted them. The
Prince led the way into the room upon the ground floor which he
called his library.
<P>
"It is a fancy of mine," he said, smiling, "to say goodbye to you
all here. You see that there is nothing in this room which is not
really the product of Japan. Here I feel, indeed, as though I had
crossed the seas and were back under the shadow of my own
mountains. Here I feel, indeed, your host, especially as I am
going to distribute my treasures."
<P>
He took a picture from the wall and turned with it to the Duke.
<P>
"Duke," he said, "this engraving is a rude thing, but the hand
which guided the steel has been withered for two hundred years,
and no other example remains of its cunning. Mr. Haviland," he
added, stepping to his writing table, "this lacquered shrine,
with its pagoda roof, has been attributed to Kobo-Daishi, and has
stood upon the writing table of seven emperors. Sir Edward, this
sword, notwithstanding its strange shape and gilded chasing, was
wielded with marvellous effect, if history tells the truth, a
hundred and thirty years ago by my great-grandfather when he
fought his way to the throne. Sir Charles, you are to go into
Parliament. Some day you will become a diplomat. Some day,
perhaps, you will understand our language. Just now I am afraid,"
he concluded, "this will seem to you but a bundle of purple
velvet and vellum, but it is really a manuscript of great
curiosity which comes from the oldest monastery in Asia, the
Monastery of Koya-San."
<P>
He turned to the Duchess.
<P>
"Duchess," he said, "you see that my tapestries have already
gone. They left yesterday for Devenham Castle. I hope that you
will find a place there where you may hang them. They are a
little older than your French ones, and time, as you may
remember, has been kind to them. It may interest you to know that
they were executed some thirteen hundred and fifty years ago, and
are of a design which, alas, we borrowed from the Chinese."
<P>
The Prince paused for a moment. All were trying to express their
thanks, but no one was wholly successful. He waved their words
gently aside.
<P>
"Lady Grace," he said, turning to the statuette of Buddha in a
corner of the room and taking from its neck a string of strange
blue stones, "I will not ask you to wear these, for they have
adorned the necks of idols for many centuries, but if you will
keep them for my sake, they may remind you sometimes of the color
of our skies."
<P>
Once more he went to his writing table. From it he lifted, almost
reverently, a small bronze figure,--the figure of a woman,
strongly built, almost squat, without grace, whose eyes and head
and arms reached upwards.
<P>
"Miss Penelope," he said, "to you I make my one worthless
offering. This statuette has no grace, no shapeliness, according
to the canons of your wonderful Western art. Yet for five
generations of my family it has been the symbol of our lives. We
are not idol worshippers in Japan, yet one by one the men of my
race have bent their knee before this figure and have left their
homes to fight for the thing which she represents. She is not
beautiful, she does not stand for the joys and the great gifts of
life, but she represents the country which to us stands side by
side with our God, our parents, and our Emperor. Nothing in life
has been dearer to me than this, Miss Penelope. To no other
person would I part with it."
<P>
She took it with a sudden hysterical sob, which seemed to ring
out like a strange note upon the unnatural stillness of the room.
And then there came a thing which happened before its time. The
door was opened. Inspector Jacks came in. With him were Dr.
Spencer Whiles and the man who a few days ago had been discharged
from St. Thomas' Hospital. Of the very distinguished company who
were gathered there, Inspector Jacks took little notice. His eyes
lit upon the form of the Prince, and he drew a sigh of relief.
The door was closed behind him, and he saw no way by which he
could be cheated of his victory. He took a step forward, and the
Prince advanced courteously, as though to meet him. The others,
for those few seconds, seemed as though they had lost the power
of speech or movement. Then before a word could be uttered by
either the Inspector or the Prince, the door was opened from the
outside, and a man came running in,--a man dressed in a shabby
blue serge suit, dark and thin. He ran past the Inspector and his
companions, and he fell on his knees before his master.
<P>
"I confess!" he cried. "It was I who climbed on to the railway
car! It was I who stabbed the American man in the tunnel and
robbed him of his papers! The others are innocent. Marki, who
brought the car for me, knew nothing. Those who saw me return to
this house knew nothing. No man was my confidant. I alone am
guilty! I thought they could not discover the truth, but they
have hunted me down. He is there--the doctor who bandaged my
knee. I told him that it was a bicycle accident. Listen! It was I
who killed the young American Vanderpole. I followed him from the
Savoy Hotel. I dressed myself in the likeness of my master, and I
entered his taxi as a pleasant jest. Then I strangled him and I
robbed him too! He saw me--that man!" Soto cried, pointing to the
youth who stood at the Inspector's left hand. "He was on his
bicycle. He skidded and fell through watching me. I told my
master that I was in trouble, and he has tried to shield me, but
he did not know the truth. If he had, he would have given me over
as I give myself now. What I did I did because I love Japan and
because I hate America!"
<P>
His speech ended in a fit of breathlessness. He lay there,
gasping. The doctor bent forward, looking at him first in
perplexity and afterwards in amazement. Then very slowly, and
with the remnants of doubt still in his tone, he answered
Inspector Jacks' unspoken question.
<P>
"He is the image of the man who came to me that night," he
declared. "He is wearing the same clothes, too."
<P>
"What do you say?" the Inspector whispered hoarsely to the youth
on his other side. "Don't hurry. Look at him carefully."
<P>
The young man hesitated.
<P>
"He is the same height and figure as the man I saw enter the
taxi," he said. "I believe that it is he."
<P>
Inspector Jacks stepped forward, but the Prince held out his
hand.
<P>
"Wait!" he ordered, and his voice was sterner than any there had
ever heard him use. There was a fire in his eyes from which the
man at his feet appeared to shrink.
<P>
"Soto," the Prince said, and he spoke in his own language, so
that no person in that room understood him save the one whom he
addressed,--"why have you done this?"
<P>
The man lay there, resting now upon his side, and supporting
himself by the palm of his right hand. His upturned face seemed
to have in it all the passionate pleading of a dumb animal.
<P>
"Illustrious Prince," he answered, speaking also in his own
tongue, "I did it for Japan! Who are you to blame me, who have
offered his own life so freely? I have no weight in the world.
For you the future is big. You will go back to Japan, you will
sit at the right hand of the emperor. You will tell him of the
follies and the wisdom of these strange countries. You will guide
him in difficulties. Your hand will be upon his as he writes
across the sheets of time, for the glory of the Motherland.
Banzai, illustrious Prince! I, too, am of the immortals!"
<P>
He suddenly collapsed. The doctor bent over him, but the Prince
shook his head slowly.
<P>
"It is useless," he said. "The man has confessed his crime. He
has told me the whole truth. He has taken poison."
<P>
Lady Grace began to cry softly. The air of the room seemed heavy
with pent-up emotions. The Prince moved slowly toward the door
and threw it open. He turned towards them all.
<P>
"Will you leave me?" he asked. "I wish to be alone."
<P>
His eyes were like the eyes of a blind man.
<P>
One by one they left the room, Inspector Jacks amongst them. The
only person who spoke, even in the hall, was the Inspector.
<P>
"It was the Prince who brought the doctor here," he muttered. "He
must have known! At least he must have known!"
<P>
Mr. Haviland touched him on the arm.
<P>
"Inspector Jacks!" he whispered.
<P>
Inspector Jacks saluted.
<P>
"The murderer is dead," he continued, speaking still under his
breath. "Silence is a wonderful gift, Mr. Jacks. Sometimes its
reward is greater even than the reward of action."
<P>
They passed from the house, and once more its air of deep silence
was unbroken. The Prince stood in the middle of that strange
room, whose furnishings and atmosphere seemed, indeed, so
marvellously reminiscent of some far distant land. He looked down
upon the now lifeless figure, raised the still, white fingers in
his for a moment, and laid them reverently down. Then his head
went upward, and his eyes seemed to be seeking the heavens.
<P>
"So do the great die," he murmured. "Already the Gods of our
fathers are calling you Soto the Faithful. Banzai!"
