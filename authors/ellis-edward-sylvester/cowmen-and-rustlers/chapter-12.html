<p>Mont Sterry had wisdom enough to turn to the fullest account
the remarkable advantage gained through the sagacity of his mare.</p>

<p>His pursuers, in their haste to head him off, had dashed across
the arroya at a point only a short distance above where he entered
and their leader emerged from it. They were sure to discover the
truth in a short time.</p>

<p>Waiting, therefore, only until they had passed beyond, he rode
his horse a few rods along the depression, and then left it on
the same side by which he had ridden into it.</p>

<p>Unconsciously he fell into an error of which he was not dreaming.
In the short distance passed, the arroya made a sweeping curve,
and he had repeatedly changed his own course since leaving the
Whitney ranch. Thus it was almost inevitable that he should get
the points of the compass mixed, and that he should follow a route
widely different from the one intended.</p>

<p>Had he paused long enough to note the position of the full moon
in the heavens, or the towering Big Horn Mountains, he would have
gained an approximate idea of where he was; but, despite his experience
in the West, he galloped forward at an easy canter, with never
a suspicion of the blunder he was making.</p>

<p>He was on the alert for rustlers, and kept glancing to the right
and left, and to the front and rear. As has been shown, he had
little fear of being overtaken in a chase where he was given an
equal chance with his pursuers, but his narrow escape rendered
him more apprehensive than usual.</p>

<p>"I thought of staying with Weber and Hankinson to-night," he
mused, "but I think it hardly prudent. The rustlers may pay them
a visit, and my presence will only make matters worse; and yet
those fellows don't want to start up a band of regulators who
will shoot them down without mercy, and that's just what will
take place if they carry their outrages too far."</p>

<p>"My death won't bring the regulators into existence," he grimly
reflected, "for one man, more or less, doesn't count; but there
is much bitter feeling in the country."</p>

<p>Once he thought he caught the sounds of horses' feet on the prairie,
and checked his mare to listen, but she gave no evidence of suspicion&mdash;a
thing she was sure to do, if the cause existed.</p>

<p>Sterry was so well satisfied by this fact that he did not dismount
to test the matter as before. He rode on, however, and held her
down to a walk.</p>

<p>His eventless course had continued some minutes before a thought
came to him of the direction he was following, with the possibility
that he was wrong.</p>

<p>"I wonder if we are on the right track, Queenie?" he said, addressing
his animal, as was his custom when they were alone. "It would
be strange if we didn't drift away from our bearings. Hello! that
can't be Dick Hawkridge's ranch; we haven't gone far enough for
that; but what the mischief can it be, unless a fire that some
one has started in the open?"</p>

<p>The starlike twinkle of a point of light suddenly shone out directly
in advance. It puzzled him by appearing only for a moment, when
it vanished as quickly as it entered his field of vision.</p>

<p>This fact suggested that it was within some dwelling and had
been extinguished, or was shut from sight by being moved past
a window or open door to another point in the interior.</p>

<p>"We are so near, Queenie, we may as well go farther," he added,
not unmindful of his danger from those who were making such a
hot search for him. He kept his horse on a walk, maintaining a
keen watch between the dainty ears that were already pricked up
as if she knew something was likely to happen quite soon.</p>

<p>Advancing in this deliberate fashion, the outline of one of those
long, low wooden structures so common in the West was gradually
defied in the moonlight, and he knew he was approaching the home
of some ranchman.</p>

<p>But whose? was the question that perplexed him. He recalled that
some of his travelling had been done at a high rate of speed,
but the distance between the Whitney and Hawkridge ranches was
fully a dozen miles, and he was sure that that space had not been
covered by him since bidding his friends good-by earlier in the
evening, especially as he had not followed a direct course.</p>

<p>"Can it be?" he exclaimed, with a sudden suspicion. "Yes, by
gracious! What a blunder!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was caused by the sight of a young man, with
one arm in a sling, who came forward to welcome him.</p>

<p>He had returned to the Whitney home, which he supposed was miles
away, and this was his old friend Fred, who came smilingly forward
and said, as he recognized him:</p>

<p>"I am glad, indeed, to see you, Mont; we heard the sound of the
firing and feared that something had happened to you."</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, thank you, and nothing to Queenie&mdash;but that
reminds me," he added, slipping out of the saddle; "she acted
once as though she had been hit, though it wasn't bad enough to
show itself in her gait."</p>

<p>The two made a hasty examination but discovered nothing; proof
that, as her owner said, the wound, if any, was too slight to
trouble her.</p>

<p>"Fred, what do you think of my coming back to you in this fashion?"
abruptly asked Sterry, with a laugh, looking around in his friend's
face.</p>

<p>"The most sensible thing you could have done; it redeems your
foolishness in leaving us as you did."</p>

<p>"But my return was involuntary."</p>

<p>"How was that?"</p>

<p>"I thought I was miles distant, and had no idea of my location
until I caught the outlines of your house; I assure you I contemplated
no such performance as this."</p>

<p>"Well, you're here, so what's the use of talking unless you mean
to mount your mare and try it again."</p>

<p>"Hardly that; I have too much mercy on her."</p>

<p>The couple walked past the dwelling to the rude but roomy shelter
at the rear where the horses were sometimes placed when not in
use, or when the severity of the weather made the protection necessary.
There the saddle, bridle and trappings were removed from the mare,
and she was made comfortable. Then the two returned to their seats
at the front of the building, to smoke and chat a few minutes
before retiring for the night.</p>
