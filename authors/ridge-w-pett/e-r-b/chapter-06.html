<p>THE particular blend of trouble which Willow Walk was occupied in brewing
proved highly attractive to Erb, and one that gave to all the men
concerned a taste of the joys that must have come in the French
Revolution.  A few impetuous young spirits who had been brooding on
grievances since the days when they were van boys were responsible.  Erb
recognised that here was the first opportunity of justifying his
appointment.  Warned, however, by the example of other organisers within
memory, who had sometimes in similar experiments shown a tendency to
excess, Erb took care.  He wrote letters to the General Manager, letters
for which he received a printed form of acknowledgment and no other, he
wrote to the Directors, and received a brief reply to the effect that
they could not recognise Mr. Herbert Barnes in the matter, and that the
grievances of the staff concerned only the staff and themselves; the men
were bitterly annoyed at this, but Erb, because he had anticipated the
reply, showed no concern.  He worked from dawn near to dawn again,
sending letters to members of Parliament, going round to the depots of
other railways, attending meetings, and in many ways devoting himself to
the work of what he called directing public opinion.  In point of fact,
he had first to create it.  For a good fortnight he gave up everything to
devote himself to this one object, gave up everything but his lessons in
Camberwell.  One of the halfpenny evening papers said, amongst other
things, “Mr. Herbert Barnes made an impassioned but logical and
excellently delivered speech.”  Erb knew the deplorable looking man with
a silk hat of the early seventies who had reported this, but that did not
prevent him from being highly gratified on seeing the words in print;
Louisa spent eighteenpence on a well-bound manuscript book, and in it
commenced to paste these notices.  The point at issue being that the men
demanded better payment of overtime, Erb found here a subject that lent
itself to oratorical argument; the story of the man who was so seldom at
home that one Sunday his little girl asked the other parent, “Mother,
who’s this strange man?” never failed to prove effective, and Erb felt
justified in leaving out the fact that the carman in question was one
accustomed, when his work finished at night, to go straight from the
stables to a house in Old Kent Road, where he usually remained until the
potman cried “Time! gentlemen, time!”
</p>
<p>The men had sent in their ultimatum to the head office, and had held
their last meeting.  The Directors had remained adamant on the question
of receiving Erb as spokesman, and the men, not having an orator of equal
power in their ranks, and fearful of being worsted in a private
interview, had insisted either that Erb should accompany the deputation
or that there should be no deputation at all, but only a strike on the
following Monday morning.  (The advanced party protested against the idea
of giving this formal notice of an unlikely event but Erb insisted and
the moderates supported him.  “If we can get what we want,” argued the
moderates, “by showing a certain amount of what you may call bluff, by
all means let us stop at that.”)
</p><p>It gave Erb a sensation of power to find that not one of these uniformed
men in their brass-bound caps was strong-minded enough or sufficiently
clear of intellect to carry out any big scheme by himself; they could
only keep of one mind by shoring each other up, and he felt that he
himself was the one steady, upright person who prevented them all from
slipping.  He not only kept them together, but he guided them.  A
suggestion from him on some minor point of detail, and they followed as a
ship obeys the helm; if any began a remark with doubting preface of “Ah,
but—” the others hushed them down and begged them to have some sense.
Erb had made all his plans for the possible stop of work; the other
stations and depots were willing to contribute something infinitesimal
every week with much the same spirit that they would have paid to see a
wrestling match.  All the same, Erb showed more confidence than he felt,
and when he left the men, declining their invitation to drink success to
the movement (clear to them that Fortune was a goddess only to be
appeased and gained over by the pouring out of libations of mild and
bitter), he took cheerfulness from his face, and walked, his collar up,
along Bermondsey New Road to call for his young sister at her workshop.
The sellers on the kerb appealed to him in vain, a shrill-voiced little
girl thrust groundsel in his face, and he took no notice.  Gay bunches of
flowers were flourished in front of his eyes, and he waved them aside.
If the men went weak at the knees at the last moment it would be
deplorable, but it would be an incident for which he could not blame
himself; if he himself were to make some blunder in the conduct of the
negotiations it would be fatal to his career, and all other secretaries
of all other organisations would whisper about it complacently.
</p><p>“Anxious times, my girl,” said Erb to Louisa.  “Anxious times.  We’ll
have a tram-ride down to Greenwich and back, and blow dull care away.”
</p><p>“I’ve just finished,” said Louisa in a whisper.  “I’ll pop on me hat,
Erb, and be with you in ’alf a moment.”
</p><p>“What’s become of your voice?”
</p><p>“Mislaid it somewhere,” said his young sister lightly.  “Can’t think for
the life of me where I put it last.”
</p><p>“This work’s beginning to affect your chest,” said Erb.
</p><p>“Funny thing,” remarked Louisa, with great good temper, halfway up the
wooden stairs of the workshop, “but my medical man ordered me carriage
exercise.  Shan’t be two ticks.”
</p><p>When Louisa returned, stabbing her hat in one or two places before
gaining what seemed to be a satisfactory hold, she was accompanied by
giggling young women who had been sent by the rest as a commission to
ascertain whether it was Louisa’s own brother or some other girl’s
brother who had called for her; Louisa’s own statement appearing too
absurd to have any relationship to truth.  Moreover, presuming it were
Louisa’s young man who had called for her, it was something of a breach
of etiquette, as understood by the girls of the workshop, for one young
couple to go out alone, the minimum number for such an expedition being
four, in which case they talked not so much to their immediate companion
as to the other half of the square party, with whom they communicated by
shouting.  Having ascertained, to their surprise, that Louisa had spoken
the exact and literal truth, they saw the brother and sister off from the
doorway, warning Louisa to wrap up her neck, and begging Erb to smile and
think of something pleasant.
</p><p>“Never mind their chaff,” said Louisa, in her deep whisper.  “I’d a jolly
sight rather be going out a bit of an excursion with you than I would
with—well, <u>you</u> know.”
</p><p>“Wish you hadn’t lost your voice,” said Erb, with concern.  “I don’t like
the sound of it, at all.”
</p><p>“There’s some girls in our place never get it back, and after about four
or five years of it—Don’t cross over here.”
</p><p>“Why not?”
</p><p>“He makes my ’ead ache,” said Louisa promptly.  “I’ve only been going out
with him for a fortnight, and I know all what he’s going to say as though
I’d read it in a printed book.  He talks about the weather first, then
about his aunt’s rheumatics, then about the day he had at Brighton when
he was a kid, then about where he thinks of spendin’ his ’oliday next
year, then about how much his ’oliday cost him last year—”  A mild gust
of wind came and struck Louisa on the mouth; she stopped to cough,
holding her hand the while flat on her blouse.
</p><p>“Keep your mouth shut, youngster,” advised Erb kindly, “until you’ve got
used to the fresh air.”
</p><p>Because both brother and sister felt that in sailing down to New Cross
Gate on the top of a tram, and then along by a line less straight and
decided to Greenwich they were escaping from worry, they enjoyed the
evening’s trip.  Going through Hatcham, Louisa declared that one might be
in the country, and thereupon, in her own way, declared that they were in
the country, that she and her brother had been left a bit of money, which
enabled her to give up work at the factory and wear a fresh set of cuffs
and collars every day: this sudden stroke of good fortune also permitted
Erb to give up his agitating rigmarole (the phrase was Louisa’s own, and
Erb accepted it without protest), and they had both settled down
somewhere near Epping Forest; Erb, as lord of the manor, with the vicar
of the parish church for slave, and Louisa as the generous Lady
Bountiful, giving blankets and home-made jam to all those willing to
subscribe to Conservative principles.  They had a stroll up the hill to
Greenwich Park, Lady Louisa forced to go slowly on account of some
aristocratic paucity of breath, and Sir Herbert, her brother, playing
imaginary games of golf with a stick and some pebbles, and going round
the links in eighty-two.  At the Chalet near the Blackheath side of the
park they had tea, Louisa’s insistence on addressing her brother by a
full title astonishing the demure people at other wooden tables, puzzling
them greatly, and causing, after departure, acrimonious debate between
husbands and wives, some deciding that Erb and Louisa were really
superior people and others making reference to escapes from Colney Hatch.
Louisa, delighted with the game of fooling people, darted down the hill,
with Erb following at a sedate trot; she stopped three parts of the way
down, and Erb found her leaning against a tree panting with tears in her
eyes.  These tears she brushed away, declaring that something had come to
her mind that had made her laugh exhaustedly, and the two went on more
sedately through the open way at the side of the tall iron gates, happier
in each other’s company than in the company of anyone else, and showing
this in the defiant way with which some people hide real emotions.
</p><p>“<u>You’re</u> a bright companion,” said Louisa satirically, as the tram
turned with a jerk at the foot of Blackheath Hill.  “You ’aven’t made me
laugh for quite five minutes.”
</p><p>“I’ve been thinking, White Face.”
</p><p>“My face isn’t white,” protested his sister, leaning back to get a
reflection of herself in a draper’s window.  “I’ve got quite a colour.
Besides, why don’t you give up thinking for a bit?  You’re always at it.
I wonder your brain—or whatever you like to call it—stands the tax you
put on it.”
</p><p>“You’d be a rare old nagger,” said Erb, hooking the tarpaulin covering
carefully and affectionately around his sister, “if ever anybody had the
misfortune to marry you.  It’d be jor, jor, jor, from morning, noon, till
night.”
</p><p>“And if ever you was silly enough to get engaged, Erb.  That’s Deptford
Station down there,” said Louisa, as the tram stopped for a moment’s
rest.  “I used to know a boy who’s ticket collector now.  He got so
confused the other day when I come down here to go to a lecture that he
forgot to take my ticket.”  She laughed out of sheer exultation at the
terrifying powers of her sex.  “Take my advice, Erb, don’t you never get
married, even if you are asked to.  Not even if it was young Lady
Frances.”
</p><p>“Young idiot,” said Erb.  “Think I ever bother my head about such
matters?  I’ve got much more important work in life.  This business that
I’ve got on now—”
</p><p>“Our girls are always asking about you,” said Louisa musingly.  “It’s
all, ‘Is he engaged?’ ‘Does he walk out with anybody?’  ‘Is he a woman
’ater?’ and all such rot.”
</p><p>Erb looked down at the traffic that was speeding at the side of the
leisurely tram and gave himself up for a while to the luxury of feeling
that he had been the subject of this discussion.  He thought of his young
elocution teacher, and wondered whether he had any right to accept this
position of a misogynist when he knew so well that it was made by adverse
circumstances and the existence of a good-looking youth with an
unreliable chin and his hair in waves.  The driver below whistled
aggrievedly at a high load of hops that was coolly occupying the tram
lines; the load of hops seemed to be asleep, and the tram driver had to
pull up and whistle again.  In a side road banners were stretched across
with the word “Welcome,” signifying thus that a church bazaar was being
held, where articles could be bought at quite six times the amount of
their real value.  A landau, drawn by a pair of conceited greys, came out
of the side street, with a few children following and crying,
“Ipipooray!” the proud horses snorted indignantly to find that they were
checked by a bucolic waggon and a plebeian tram.  A young woman with a
scarlet parasol in the landau looked out over the door rather anxiously.
</p><p>“It’s her ladyship,” cried Louisa, clutching Erb’s arm.
</p><p>“Good shot,” agreed Erb.
</p><p>“If only she’d look up and recognise us,” said Louisa.  The other people
on the tram began to take an interest in the encounter, and Louisa’s head
already trembled with pride.
</p><p>“She wouldn’t recognise us.”
</p><p>“Go on with you,” contradicted his sister.
</p><p>Louisa was afflicted with a sudden cough of such eccentric timbre that
some might have declared it to be forced.  People on the pavement looked
up at her surprisedly, and Lady Frances just then closing her scarlet
parasol, for the use of which, indeed, the evening gave but little
reason, also glanced upwards.  Erb took off his hat and jerked a bow, and
Louisa noticed that the closed scarlet parasol was being waved
invitingly.  She unhooked the tarpaulin cover at once, and, despite Erb’s
protestation that they had paid fares to the Elephant, hurried him down
the steps.  To Louisa’s great delight, the tram, with its absorbedly
interested passengers, did not move until the two had reached the open
landau, and Lady Frances’s neatly-gloved hand had offered itself in the
most friendly way.  Louisa declared later that she would have given all
that she had in the Post Office Savings Bank to have heard the comments
of the passengers.
</p><p>“This,” said Lady Frances pleasantly, “is the long arm of coincidence.
Step in both of you, please, and let me take you home to your place.”
</p><p>“If you don’t mind excusing us—” began Erb.
</p><p>(“Oh you—you man,” said his sister to herself.  “I can’t call you
anything else.”)
</p><p>“Please, <u>please</u>,” begged Lady Frances.  They stepped in.  By a great
piece of good luck,’ Erb remembered that amongst the recipes and axioms
and words of advice on the back page of an evening paper he had a night
or two previously read that gentlemen should always ride with their backs
to the horses, and he took his seat opposite to Lady Frances: that young
woman, with a touch on Louisa’s arm, directed the short girl to be seated
at her side.
</p><p>“Bricklayers’ Arms Station, Old Kent Road,” said Lady Frances.  Mr.
Danks, in livery, and his hair prematurely whitened, had jumped down to
close the door.  Mr. Danks touched his hat, and, without emotion, resumed
his seat at the side of the coachman.  “You are keeping well, I hope?”
To Louisa.
</p><p>“I <u>have</u> been feeling a bit chippy,” said Erb’s sister, trying to loll
back in the seat, but fearful of losing her foothold.
</p><p>“So sorry,” said Lady Frances.  “And you?”
</p><p>“Thank you,” said Erb, “middlin’.  Can’t say more than that.  Been
somewhat occupied of late with various matters.”
</p><p>“I know, I know,” she remarked briskly.  “It is that that makes it
providential I should have met you.  My uncle is a director on one of the
railways, and he was talking about you only last night at dinner.”
</p><p>“Very kind of the gentleman.  What name, may I ask?”  Lady Frances gave
the information, gave also an address, and Erb nodded.  “Me and him are
somewhat in opposite camps at the present time.”
</p><p>“My uncle was anxious to meet you,” said young Lady Frances, in her
agreeable way.
</p><p>“Just at this moment I scarcely think—”
</p><p>“Under a flag of truce,” she suggested.  “I was going to write to you,
but this will save me from troubling you with a note.”
</p><p>“No trouble.”
</p><p>“I’ve been opening a bazaar down here,” went on Lady Frances with a
determined air of vivacity.  “The oddest thing.  Do you ever go to
bazaars?”
</p><p>“Can’t say,” said Erb cautiously, “that I make a practice of frequenting
them.”
</p><p>“Then let me tell you about this.  When you open a bazaar you have first
to fill your purse with gold, empty it, and then—”
</p><p>Louisa sat, bolt upright, her feet just touching the floor of the
carriage, and feeling, as she afterwards intimated, disinclined to call
the Prince of Wales her brother.  Her ears listened to Lady Frances’s
conversation, and she made incoherent replies when an opinion was
demanded, but her eyes were alert on one side of the carriage or the
other, sparkling with anxiety to encounter someone whom she knew.  Nearly
everybody turned to look at them, but it was not until they reached the
Dun Cow at the corner of Rotherhithe New Road (the hour being now eight
o’clock), at a moment when Louisa had begun to tell herself regretfully
no one would believe her account of this gratifying and epoch-making
event, that into Old Kent Road, chasing each other, came two girls
belonging to her factory.  The foremost dodged behind a piano-organ that
made a fruitless effort to make its insistent jangle heard above the roar
and the murmur of traffic; seeing her pursuer stand transfixed, with a
cheerful scream of vengeance half finished, she turned her head.  At the
sight of Louisa bowing with a genteel air of half recognition the first
girl staggered back and sat down helplessly on the handles of the
piano-organ, jerking that instrument of music and causing the Italian
lady with open bodice to remonstrate in the true accents of Clerkenwell.
When near to Bricklayers’ Arms Station Louisa saw again her current young
man morbid with the thought of a wasted evening, but still waiting
hopefully for his <u>fiancée</u>, now three hours behind time; the young
gentleman’s eyesight being dimmed with resentfulness, it became necessary
for her to wave a handkerchief that might, she knew, have been cleaner,
and thus engage his attention.  At the very last possible moment he
signalled astonished acknowledgment.
</p><p>For Erb, on the other hand, the journey had something less of exultation.
From the moment of starting from St. James’s Road, Hatcham, the fear
possessed him that he might be seen by some member of his society, who
would thereupon communicate facts to colleagues.  Thus would his
character for independence find itself bruised: thus would the jealousy
of the men be aroused; thus would the Spanswick party be able to whisper
round the damaging report that Erb had been nobbled by the capitalists.
Wherefore Erb, anxious for none of these eventualities, tipped his hat
well over his forehead, and, leaning forward, with his face down,
listened to Lady Frances’s conversation.  The carriage had a scent of
refinement; the young woman opposite in her perfect costume was something
to be worshipped respectfully, and he scarce wondered when, at one point
of the journey up the straight Old Kent Road, he heard one loafer say to
another, “Where’s there an election on to-day?”  Lady Frances, having
completed her account of the bazaar, had information of great importance
to communicate, and this she gave in a confidential undertone that was
pleasant and flattering.
</p><p>“From what my uncle says, it appears there is a strike threatening,
and—you know all about it perhaps?”
</p><p>“Heard rumours,” said Erb guardedly.
</p><p>“He is anxious that you should call upon him at the earliest possible
moment to discuss the affair privately, but he is most anxious that it
should not appear that he has sought the meeting.  You quite see, don’t
you?  It’s a question of <u>amour propre</u>.”
</p><p>“Ho!” said Erb darkly.
</p><p>“And I should be so glad,” she went on, with the excitement of a young
diplomatist, “if I could bring you two together.  It would be doing so
much good.”
</p><p>“To him?”
</p><p>“I could drive you on now,” she suggested hesitatingly, “and we should
catch my uncle just after his dinner; an excellent time.”
</p><p>“I think,” said Erb stolidly, “that we’d better let events work out their
natural course.”
</p><p>“You’re wrong, quite wrong, believe me.  Events left alone work out very
clumsily at times.”  Lady Frances touched him lightly on the knee.
“Please do me this very small favour.”
</p><p>“Since you put it like that then, I don’t mind going up to see him
to-night.  Not that anything will come from it, mind you.  Don’t let’s
delude ourselves into thinking <u>that</u>.”
</p><p>“This,” cried Lady Frances, clapping her hands, “is excellent.  This is
just what I like to be doing.”  Erb, still watching fearfully for
acquaintances, glanced at her excited young face, with respectful
admiration.  “Now, I shall drive you straight on—”
</p><p>“If you don’t mind,” said Erb, “no; we’ll hop out at the corner of Page’s
Walk.”
</p><p>“And not drive up to the dwellings?” asked Louisa disappointed.
</p><p>“And <u>not</u> drive up to the dwellings,” said Erb firmly.  “I’ll get on
somehow to see your uncle to-night.”
</p><p>“You won’t break your word?”
</p><p>“I should break a lot of other things before I did that.”
</p><p>Thus it was.  Lady Frances shook hands; Erb stepped out, looking narrowly
through the open gateway of the goods station, and offering assistance to
Louisa absently.  As he did so, he saw William Henry, his old van boy,
marching out of the gates in a violently new suit of corduroys, and with
the responsible air of one controlling all the railways in the world.
</p><p>“Get better soon,” said Lady Frances to Louisa.  “Mr. Barnes, to-night.”
Mr. Danks, down from his seat and closing the door (Erb and his sister
standing on the pavement, Erb wondering whether he ought to give the
footman threepence for himself, and Louisa coming down slowly from heaven
to earth), Mr. Danks received the order, “Home, please.”
</p><p>Erb went half an hour later by tram to Westminster Bridge and walked
across.  He perceived the necessity for extreme caution; reading and
natural wisdom told him that many important schemes had been ruined by
the interference of woman.  He looked at the lights that starred the
borders of the wide river, saw the Terrace where a member of Parliament
walked up and down, following the red glow of a cigar, and he knew that
if he were ever to get there it would only be by leaping successfully
over many obstacles similar to the one which at present confronted him;
to allow himself to be distracted from the straight road of progress
would be to court disaster.
</p><p>“Boy,” said the porter at the Mansions, “show No. 124A.”  In a lift that
darted to the skies Erb was conveyed and ordered to wait in a corridor
whilst Boy, who wore as many buttons as could be crowded on his tight
jacket, went and hunted for Lady Frances’s uncle and presently ran him to
earth in the smoking room, bringing him out triumphantly to the corridor.
Erb found himself greeted with considerable heartiness, invited to come
into the smoking room that looked down at a height suggesting vertigo at
St. James’s Park, taken to a corner, and furnished with a big cigar.  Men
in evening dress, with the self-confidence that comes after an adequate
meal, were telling each other what they would do were they Prime
Minister, and Erb was surprised to hear the drastic measures proposed for
stamping out opposition; some of these seemed to be scarcely within the
limits of reason.  And what had Erb to say?  A plain man, said Lady
Frances’s uncle of himself (which, in one respect at any rate, was a
statement bearing the indelible stamp of truth), always of opinion that
it was well to plunge <u>in medias res</u>.  On Erb replying that at present
he had no remark to offer, the purple-faced Director seemed taken aback,
and diverted the conversation for a time to Trichinopolies and how best
to keep them, a subject on which Erb was unable to speak with any
pretence of authority.
</p><p>“A little whiskey?” suggested the Director, with his thumb on the
electric bell, “just to keep one alive.”
</p><p>Lady Frances’s uncle sighed on receiving Erb’s reply, and proceeded to
relate a long and not very interesting anecdote concerning an attempt
that had once been made to swindle him by an hotel proprietor at Cairo,
and the courageous way in which he had resisted the overcharge.  On Erb
looking at his silver watch, the colour of the Director’s face, from
sheer anxiety deepened, and he waved into the discussion with a “Pall
Mall Gazette” a silent friend who had been sitting in a low easy chair,
with hands clasped over his capacious dress waistcoat, gazing at the room
with the fixed stare of repletion.  The silent friend craned himself into
an upright position and lumbered across the room to the window.  The
Director, thus usefully reinforced, proceeded to open the affair of the
impending strike, and, having done this, urged that there never was a
difficulty yet that had not a way out, and demanded that Erb should show
this way out instantly.  Erb suggested that the Director’s colleagues
should receive him and the men, listen to their arguments, and concede
their requests, or some of them.  Director, appealing for the support of
the silent man, but receiving none, replied explosively, “That be hanged
for a tale!”  On which Erb remarked that he had some distance to go, and
if the Director would excuse him—  Director said, fervently, “For
goodness gracious’ sake, let us sit down, and let us thresh this matter
out.”  Giving up now his original idea of an exit, he remarked that a
golden bridge must be built.  Why should not Erb simply stand aside, and
let the men alone seek consultation with the Directors?  Erb declared
that he would do this like one o’clock (intimating thus prompt and
definite action), providing there was good likelihood of the men’s
requests being complied with.  Director, looking at silent friend, and
trying to catch that gentleman’s lack lustre eye, inquired how on earth
he could pledge his colleagues.  Erb, now interested in the game,
suggested that Lady Frances’s uncle probably had some idea of the
feelings entertained by his fellow directors, and the host, giving up all
efforts to get help from his silent friend, admitted that there was
something in this.  Pressed by Erb to speak as man to man, Director gave
the limits of concession that had been decided upon—limits which would
not, however, come within sight unless the men came alone, and quite
alone, to plead their cause.  Erb thought for a few moments, the glare of
the silent friend now directed upon him, and then said that he would take
Director’s word as the word of a gentleman; the men should send a
deputation the following day in their luncheon hour, and he (Erb) would
stand aside to watch the result.  Director offered a hand, and Erb,
instinctively rubbing his palm on his trousers, took it, and the silent
friend thereupon suddenly burst into speech (which was the last thing of
which one would have thought him capable) saying huskily, and with
pompous modesty, that he was very pleased to think that any poor efforts
of his should have brought about such a happy agreement; that it was not
the first time, and probably would not be the last, that he had presided
over a meeting of reconciliation, and that his methods were always—if he
might say so—tact, impartiality, and a desire to hear both sides.
</p><p>“Quite glad to have met you,” said the Director, also gratified in having
accomplished something that would give him the halo of notoriety at
to-morrow’s Board meeting.  “You’ll go far.  Your head is screwed on the
right way, my man.  Not a liqueur?”
</p><p>“I take partic’lar care it ain’t screwed in any other fashion,” said Erb.
</p><p>“Good-bye,” said the Director.
</p><p>“Be good,” said Erb.
