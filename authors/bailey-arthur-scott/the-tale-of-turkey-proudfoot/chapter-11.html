<p>Soon after Henrietta Hen shrieked for the rooster he came hurrying
around a corner of the barn. When he saw Turkey Proudfoot towering above
Henrietta and her new brood of chicks in the middle of the farmyard he
stopped short. To tell the truth, the rooster was afraid of Turkey
Proudfoot and usually took pains to keep out of his way.
</p>
<p>"Go back!" Turkey Proudfoot called to him. "You're not needed here.
There's been a little difficulty; but I can settle it myself."
</p><p>"Oh, very well!" the rooster replied. "I'm glad there's no great
trouble. When I heard Henrietta calling me I thought she was in danger."
He turned, then, to slink away behind the barn.
</p><p>"Don't desert me!" Henrietta Hen besought him. "Help! Help!"
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot waved a wing at the rooster.
</p><p>"Don't pay any attention to her!" he said. "She's excited. I'll have her
calmed down in no time."
</p><p>"Of course I'm excited!" Henrietta Hen cried. "Don't let him deceive
you, Mr. Rooster! He's been threatening me!"
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot bade her, in an undertone, to be quiet.
</p><p>"Go along about your business," he told the rooster. "She's mistaken. I
haven't said I'd harm her."
</p><p>"No! But he's talking about eating one of my chicks! And that's worse,"
Henrietta screamed. "If you're as brave as I always supposed, Mr.
Rooster, you'll defend my family."
</p><p>Although the rooster was terribly frightened, and wanted to run away, he
simply couldn't desert Henrietta Hen.
</p><p>"She's a nuisance," he muttered as he marched across the farmyard. "I
don't see why she wanted to bring her chicks out here where Turkey
Proudfoot would see them. She's landed me in a scrape. There won't be
much left of me when that old gobbler gets through with me."
</p><p>Nevertheless the rooster put on a bold front. Drawing himself up to look
his tallest, he glared at Turkey Proudfoot and said shrilly, "What do
you mean by annoying this lady?"
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot gulped. He wondered what had come over his neighbors.
The rooster had always acted afraid of him. Though small, the rooster
was strongly built. And he had a sharp bill and sharp spurs, too. Turkey
Proudfoot noted these details carefully.
</p><p>"I won't have to fight him," he thought. "I'll behave so fiercely that
the rooster will be glad to run off. And then I'll run after him so
folks will think I am chasing him."
</p><p>Turkey Proudfoot then began to bluster. He gobbled loudly, without
saying anything at all. He even made a few quick passes at the rooster
with his bill.
</p><p>To his dismay, the rooster merely dodged. He didn't turn tail and run,
as Turkey Proudfoot had hoped he would.
</p><p>"I'll have to try something else," Turkey Proudfoot said to himself. So
he flapped his wings and jumped up and down and around the rooster.
</p><p>The rooster was very ill at ease. But he didn't let Turkey Proudfoot
know that. He kept turning about, so that he faced Turkey Proudfoot all
the time. And he said to Henrietta Hen: "Gather your chicks and get them
out of the way. There's going to be trouble here."
</p><p>Henrietta Hen obeyed him without a word. And she had no sooner shooed
her youngsters into the chicken house than Turkey Proudfoot gave a loud
laugh--a somewhat forced, yet loud laugh.
</p><p>"You're just the sort of bird I like," he told the rooster. "I've been
testing you to see if you were brave. I'm delighted to find that you
are. And I suggest that you and I stand by each other and run things in
this yard to suit ourselves. When folks don't do as I tell them to, you
and I will attend to them."
</p><p>"Agreed!" cried the rooster. He was greatly flattered. "We'll make the
neighbors step lively." And off he went, to find Henrietta Hen and tell
her how he and Turkey Proudfoot were going to help each other.
</p><p>"You're even sillier than I supposed," she informed the rooster, to his
great astonishment. He had expected nothing but praise from her.
</p><p>He left her hurriedly. And he felt quite glum.
</p><p>"She's just like the whole Hen family," he grumbled. "You never can tell
what they're going to do or what they're going to say. They may squawk
and cross the road; they may cross the road and not squawk; they may
squawk and not cross the road; they may not cross the road and not
squawk. I don't believe they know themselves what they are going to do
next."
