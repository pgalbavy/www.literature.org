<p>During the time occupied in the scrutiny of the surroundings,
Jack Carleton forgot all about the river for which they had set
out to watch for the returning Pawnees. Though the Sauk most likely
kept it in mind, yet he was so occupied that he gave it no attention.
Now, that he was relieved, however, he advanced the few yards
required, and took a survey of the river as it swept past.</p>

<p>It so happened that he was just in time, for the canoe which
had caused such a stir earlier in the day was returning. It was
two hundred yards up stream, and was loaded to its utmost capacity
with Indian warriors. There were fully a dozen, and the craft
was sunk to its gunwales&mdash;so much so indeed that the two who were
handling the paddles were forced to use care to escape swamping.</p>

<p>The Sauk thought that probably other Indians were swimming alongside
or behind the craft, but a brief study of the water convinced
him that such was not the case: all the Pawnees who were coming
over to push the campaign were in the boat. It would seem that
a dozen brave and well armed warriors were sufficient to combat
the force on the other side.</p>

<p>Hay-uta stood watching the river with such quietness that Jack,
who was still sitting on the prostrate tree, never suspected he
had discovered any thing, until he turned about and signified
by signs that the craft and its occupants had landed some distance
above.</p>

<p>I need not say that all this time the lad was longing for the
return of Deerfoot, the Shawanoe. If any one could penetrate the
mystery which shut them in at every step, he was the one to do
it. None could have attained a point nearer perfection than he,
so far as woodcraft was concerned.</p>

<p>"But what can we do?" was the question which presented itself
to the youth; "if the faintest footprints showed on the ground,
the Sauk would have discovered them, and if they ain't there,
Deerfoot can tell no more than we know."</p>

<p>"I wonder what in the name of all that's sensible he meant by
crossing the river, and leaving his bow and arrows in my charge.
If I owned such an arrangement the first thing I would do would
be to fling it into the river. Whatever plan he had in mind when
he swam over, must have been a blunder which is likely to upset
every thing."</p>

<p>The knowledge that the Pawnees had landed on the same shore where
were the Sauk and Jack Carleton required attention on their part,
for if their enemies decided to search for the marauders who,
after slaying Red Wolf, had run off with their canoe, it would
not do for the parties to remain idle.</p>

<p>In making their way to the spot where they were now resting,
our friends had taken much pains to hide their footprints, and
it would be a hard matter for the Pawnees to trace them. In fact,
Hay-uta felt little fear of it.</p>

<p>While he and Jack busied themselves in the manner described,
Deerfoot had not been idle. He swam the river, as you have been
told, and reached the other shore, without awakening suspicion
on the part of the Pawnees. After emerging from the water, he
set about locating the war party, for the first step in his scheme
required that to be done. His expectation was that the company
were gathered near some point not far removed from the camp-fire
of the night before.</p>

<p>A scout through the woods, however, showed he was mistaken. He
found what seemed to be half the party grouped around a new fire,
where there was evidence that most of the previous night had been
spent. Breakfast was over, and a number were smoking pipes. The
experienced eye of the Shawanoe told him there was no purpose
just then of moving away. The Pawnee villages were still far to
the north-west, but the warriors were in the comfortable condition
of those travelers who are at liberty to spend as much time as
they choose on the road. It mattered little to them whether they
were a week early or a month late.</p>

<p>Had any one observed the countenance of the young Shawanoe while
he was studying the group around the camp-fire, he would have
seen that he was deeply interested in one warrior, who was standing
with arms folded, and leaning lazily against a tree, smoking a
long-stemmed pipe. It was his old acquaintance Lone Bear, and
it was clear that, whatever the plan of the Shawanoe, it assigned
a prominent place in it to that individual.</p>

<p>Without affecting any secrecy in the matter, I may as well say
that the scheme of Deerfoot was as simple as difficult. He could
converse readily with the Pawnee, Lone Bear; the latter knew the
fate of Otto Relstaub; he had lied when asked for information;
Deerfoot resolved to compel him, if possible, to tell the truth.</p>

<p>The project at first seems absurd, for it may well be asked by
what possible means could Deerfoot hope to extract reliable information
from the rogue. It would never do to venture among the war party
for that purpose, for the previous experience of the Shawanoe
showed how he was hated, and the situation had not improved since
then.</p>

<p>Deerfoot hoped to separate Lone Bear from the rest of the company,
so as to have him alone to "operate" upon; but that would require
strategy more delicate and skillful than that by which the hunter
detaches a choice bull from a herd of bison, until he has him
where he wants him.</p>

<p>Enough has been told to show in what terror the Shawanoe was
held by Lone Bear, who believed he was under the special patronage
of the Evil One. Should he encounter the dreaded warrior alone
in the woods, more than likely he would succumb without a blow.</p>

<p>But the Pawnee was among his own people, and it looked as if
he meant to stay there for an indefinite time to come. As nothing
could be done so long as he had company, the one and all important
problem which faced Deerfoot at the beginning, was how he was
to draw the warrior away to a safe point in the wood.</p>

<p>There really was no means of doing so. Deerfoot could conjure
up no strategy which, when launched against a party of Indians,
would produce the desired effect upon a single member, leaving
the others unaware of what was going on. He had asked the Great
Spirit to open the way, and he was prepared to wait, with the
stoical patience of his race, for the "moving of the waters".</p>

<p>Lone Bear smoked his pipe with the placid enjoyment of an ancient
Hollander, while the Shawanoe surveyed his painted and sodden
features with peculiar interest. Red Wolf and several warriors,
with whom he had become familiar, were missing, but the presence
of one party caused surprise. The redskin who had held Jack Carleton
prisoner for a short time the evening before was among the group,
also smoking his pipe with as much pleasure as Lone Bear himself.
He did not seem to attract any attention, and was as much at home
as any of them.</p>

<p>His case was a singular one, but Deerfoot concluded that he had
had some quarrel with the members of the company. He had probably
killed his antagonist, and had fled without stopping to catch
up his gun. After his experience on the other side of the stream,
he had opened negotiations at long range with the company, and,
finding them ready to receive him, had passed over and joined
them.</p>

<p>Suddenly Lone Bear stood upright, like a man who recalls a forgotten
engagement. He took his pipe from his mouth and stared around
in the woods, as if looking for some one. Deerfoot's heart fluttered
with the hope that he meant to start off alone.</p>

<p>At this moment, the battle on the other side of the river opened.
The whoops, report of a gun and cries caused much excitement among
the Pawnees. All of them sprang to their feet and looked toward
the river (too far off to be seen), as if they expected to learn
by observation the meaning of the hubbub.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe frowned with impatience, for, as has been stated,
it looked as if the imprudence of his friends across the stream
would destroy the purpose which had brought him to the vicinity
of the Pawnee camp. The probabilities indicated great danger,
so far as Hay-uta and Jack were concerned, and Deerfoot was on
the point of rejoining them, when he decided to wait. Whatever
their peril, the end was likely to come before he could reach
them.</p>

<p>The sound of the turmoil borne to the war party in camp soon
ceased, and a long silence followed. Two of them walked toward
the river, and a third sauntered in another direction&mdash;all apparently
in pursuit of information. Deerfoot's eyes sparkled. Ah, if that
third man had only been Lone Bear!</p>

<p>The warrior on whom the young Indian had his attention fixed,
however, seemed to be partial to his former attitude, and, still
puffing his pipe, he leaned once more against the tree, as if
lost in meditation.</p>

<p>By and by the red men from the other side came over in the canoe,
and, as may be supposed, they had a stirring story to tell. Deerfoot
watched them from his concealment, but heard nothing from which
he could gain any information.</p>

<p>Among the dozen selected to make the return in the canoe was
Lone Bear. Suspecting their intention, Deerfoot kept his eye on
them until the craft left the shore.</p>

<p>It was then he "grasped the situation". The Sauk and his young
companion had taken care of themselves in spite of the large party
of enemies; they had stirred the wrath of the Pawnees to that
point that they had secured re-enforcements to go back and crush
the daring foes.</p>

<p>All this proved that it would not do for Deerfoot to linger after
the departure of the party, especially as the one in which he
was particularly interested was in the canoe.</p>

<p>The boat, laden so deeply with painted valor, reached the shore
only a few minutes in advance of the Shawanoe, who, with his usual
skill, avoided detection by friend or foe. The point where he
landed was above that which the canoe touched, for he tried to
approach as nearly as he could the spot where he had left his
two friends. He quickly learned they were not there, and then
moved down the stream parallel to its course, keeping near enough
to observe it all the way.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that this took him close to the Pawnees, who
were also searching for Hay-uta and Jack Carleton. In one sense,
the larger body was between two fires, but in no danger. The shape
of affairs was singular. The Pawnees were hunting for the Sauk
and his companion, while Deerfoot, their friend, was also looking
for them, but doing it in the wake of their enemies. The difficulty
of Deerfoot was increased by the fact that whatever signal he
sent to his friends, would have to be thrown over the heads of
their enemies.</p>

<p>But the Shawanoe addressed himself to the task with his usual
coolness and confidence. When he caught sight of the warriors,
moving along the bank of the river in no particular order, he
fell in, and "joined the procession," as may be said. It is not
to be supposed that the Pawnees had struck at once the trail of
those who took so much pains to keep out of their way, but the
loose manner in which they were following them indicated that
they suspected, rather than knew, the course taken by the fugitives.</p>

<p>When this had continued some minutes, the Shawanoe appeared to
feel the necessity of reaching some understanding with his friends,
despite the great risk incurred. He therefore emitted the soft,
bird-like signal, which he knew would be recognized if it reached
them.</p>

<p>Indeed, there could be no mistake in that respect. The trouble
lay in the fact that it would also be heard by enemies, who, if
they did not know, would be quite sure to suspect its purport.</p>
