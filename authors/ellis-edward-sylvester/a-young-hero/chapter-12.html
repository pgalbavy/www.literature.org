<p>When Fred Sheldon saw Bud Heyland standing before him in the
path, his impulse was to whirl about and run, for he knew too
well what to expect from the bully; but the latter, reading his
thoughts called out:</p>

<p>"Hold on, Freddy, I won't hurt you, though you deserve a good
horsewhipping on account of the mean way you cheated me out of
the reward for capturing the lion; but I have a little business
with you."</p>

<p>Wondering what all this could mean Fred stood still while the
red-faced young man approached, though our hero wished as fervently
that he was somewhere else as he did when he found himself face
to face with the lion in the lane.</p>

<p>"Jake sent me," added Bud in his most persuasive manner, and
with a strong effort to win the confidence of the boy, who was
somewhat reassured by the last words.</p>

<p>"What does Mr. Kincade want?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"Why, he told me to hurry after you and say that he had made
a mistake in paying you that money."</p>

<p>"I guess he didn't make any mistake," replied the surprised boy.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did; it's twenty dollars short."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't, for Squire Jones and I counted it over twice."</p>

<p>"That don't make any difference; I tell you there was a mistake
and he sent me to correct it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you come over to Squire Jones' office, then, and
fix it?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know you was there."</p>

<p>Fred knew this was untrue, for Bud sat on the porch and watched
him as he walked across the street with the squire.</p>

<p>"Well, if you are so sure of it, then you can give me the twenty
dollars and it will be all right."</p>

<p>"I want you to take out the money and count it here before me."</p>

<p>"I sha'n't do it."</p>

<p>"I guess you will; you've got to."</p>

<p>"But I can't."</p>

<p>"What's the reason you can't?"</p>

<p>"I haven't got the money with me."</p>

<p>"You haven't!" exclaimed Bud, in dismay. "Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Locked up in Squire Jones' safe."</p>

<p>The bully was thunderstruck, and gave expression to some exclamations
too forcible to be recorded.</p>

<p>It was evident that he was unprepared for such news, and he seemed
to be eager to apply his cruel whip to the little fellow toward
whom he felt such unreasonable hatred.</p>

<p>"I've got a settlement to make with you, any way," he said, advancing
threateningly toward him.</p>

<p>"What have I done," asked Fred, backing away from him, "that
you should take every chance you can get, Bud, to hurt me?"</p>

<p>"What have you done?" repeated the bully, "you've done a good
deal, as you know well enough."</p>

<p>But at this juncture, when poor Fred thought there was no escape
for him, Bud Heyland, very curiously, changed his mind.</p>

<p>"I'll let you off this time," said he, "but it won't do for you
to try any more of your tricks. When I come to think, it was ten
dollars that the money was short. Here is a twenty-dollar bill.
I want you to get it changed and give me the ten dollars to-morrow."</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon was bewildered by this unexpected turn to the interview,
but he took the bill mechanically, and promised to do as he was
told.</p>

<p>"There's another thing I want to say to you," added Bud, stopping
as he was on the point of moving away: "You must not answer any
questions that may be asked you about the bill."</p>

<p>The wondering expression of the lad showed that he failed to
take in the full meaning of this warning, and Bud added, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Don't tell anybody I gave it to you. Say you found it in the
road if they want to know where you got it; that's all. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>Fred began to comprehend, and he resolved on the instant that
he would not tell a falsehood to save himself from a score of
whippings at the hands of this evil boy, who would not have given
the caution had he not possessed good reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>Bud Heyland repeated the last warning, word for word, as first
uttered, and then, striding by the affrighted Fred, continued
in the direction of Tottenville, while the younger boy was glad
enough to go homeward.</p>

<p>The sun had not set yet when he reached the house where he was
born, and he hurried through with his work and set out for the
old brick dwelling, which had been the scene of so many stirring
incidents within the last few days.</p>

<p>He was anxious to see his mother, who had been away several days.
He felt that she ought to know of his great good fortune, that
she might rejoice with him.</p>

<p>"If she doesn't get there by to-morrow or next day I'll have
to go after her," he said to himself, "for I'll burst if I have
to hold this news much longer. And won't she be glad? It's hard
work for us to get along on our pension, and I can see she has
to deny herself a good many things so that I can go to school.
I thought I would be happy when I got the money, and so I am,
but it is more on her account than on my own&mdash;halloo!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if the lane leading to the old brick mansion was
destined to play a very important part in the history of the lad,
for he had reached the very spot where he met the lion the night
before, when a man suddenly stepped out from behind one of the
trees and stood for a moment, with the setting sun shining full
on his back, his figure looking as if it were stamped in ink against
the flaming horizon beyond.</p>

<p>As Fred stared at him, he held up his right hand and crooked
his finger for him to approach, just as he did when sitting on
the porch of the village hotel, for it was Cyrus Sutton.</p>

<p>The boy was not pleased, by any means, to meet him in such a
place, for he had felt suspicious of him ever since he saw him
sitting in such familiar converse with Bud Heyland and Jacob Kincade.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, our hero walked boldly toward him, and with a faint
"Good-evening, sir," waited to hear what he had to say.</p>

<p>"Your name is Frederick Sheldon, I believe?"</p>

<p>Fred nodded to signify that he was correct in his surmise.</p>

<p>"You met Bud Heyland in the woods over yonder, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; how could you know it?"</p>

<p>"I saw him going in that direction, and I saw you come out the
path; what more natural than that I should conclude you had met?
He gave you a twenty-dollar bill to get changed, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"He did, sir," was the answer of the amazed boy, who wondered
how it was this person could have learned so much, unless he got
the news from Bud Heyland himself.</p>

<p>"Let me see the money."</p>

<p>Fred did not like this peremptory way of being addressed by a
person whom he had never seen until that afternoon, but he drew
the bill from his pocket.</p>

<p>As he did so he brought several other articles with it, among
them his new knife, which dropped to the ground. He quickly picked
them up, and shoved them hurriedly out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton did not seem to notice this trifling mishap, but his
eyes were bent on the crumpled bill which was handed to him.</p>

<p>As soon as he got it in his hands he turned his back toward the
setting sun, and placing himself in the line of some of the horizontal
rays which found their way between the trees he carefully studied
the paper.</p>

<p>He stood full a minute without moving, and then merely said,
"Ahem!" as though he were clearing his throat. Then he carefully
doubled up the piece of national currency, and opening his pocket-book
placed it in it.</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep that?" asked Fred. "It isn't yours."</p>

<p>"He wanted you to get it changed, didn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but he didn't want me to give it away."</p>

<p>"Of course not, of course not; excuse me, but I only wanted to
change the bill for you. Here you are."</p>

<p>Thereupon he handed four five-dollar bills to Fred, who accepted
them gladly enough, though still wondering at the peculiar actions
of the man.</p>

<p>"One word," he added. "Bud told you not to answer any questions
when you got the bill changed. I haven't asked you any, but he
will have some to ask himself, which he will be very anxious you
should answer. Take my advice, and don't let him know a single
thing."</p>

<p>"I won't," said Fred, giving his promise before he thought.</p>

<p>"Very well, don't forget it; he will be on the lookout for you
to-morrow, and when you see him, hand him his ten dollars and
keep the rest for yourself, and then end the interview. Good evening,
my son."</p>

<p>"Good evening," and Fred was moving on, when Mr. Cyrus Sutton
said:</p>

<p>"Hold on a minute," at the same time crooking his forefinger
in a way peculiar to himself; "I understand you were in the house
there the other night, when it was robbed by a tramp."</p>

<p>"I was, sir; the whole village knows that."</p>

<p>"You were lucky enough to get away while it was going on, though
you were deceived by the man whom you met here in the lane."</p>

<p>The lad assured him he was correct, as he seemed to be in every
supposition which he made.</p>

<p>"Do you think you would know either of those men if you met them
again?"</p>

<p>The question was a startling one, not from the words themselves,
but from the peculiar manner in which it was asked.</p>

<p>Cyrus Sutton bent forward, thrusting his face almost in that
of the boy and dropping his voice to a deep guttural bass as he
fixed his eyes on those of Fred.</p>

<p>The latter looked up and said:</p>

<p>"The voice of the man I met in the lane sounded just like yours.
Are you the man?"</p>

<p>It surely was a stranger question than that to which the lad
had made answer, and Sutton, throwing back his head, laughed as
if he would sink to the earth from excess of mirth.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the greatest joke of the season. Am I the other
tramp that led you on such a wild-goose chase? Well, I should
say not."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Fred Sheldon felt absolutely sure that this was
the man he accused him of being.</p>

<p>Mr. Sutton, with a few jesting remarks, bade the boy good-evening,
and the latter hastened on to the brick mansion, where he busied
himself for a half hour in doing up a few chores that Michael,
the hired man, had left for him.</p>

<p>When these were finished, he went into the house, with a good
appetite for his supper, which was awaiting him.</p>

<p>The old ladies were greatly pleased to learn he had been paid
such a large sum for capturing the lion, and they did not regret
the fright they had suffered, since it resulted in such substantial
good for their favorite.</p>

<p>"Now, if you could only find our silverware," said Aunt Annie,
"what a nice sum you would earn!"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't I? I'd just roll in wealth, and I'd make mother so
happy she'd feel miserable."</p>

<p>"But I'm afraid we shall never see the silver again," observed
Miss Lizzie, with a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Wasn't there some money taken, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes; several hundred dollars. But we don't mind that, for we
can get along without it; but the silverware, you know, has been
in the family for more than two centuries."</p>

<p>"You haven't owned it all that time, have you?"</p>

<p>"My goodness! How old do you suppose we are?" asked the amused
old lady.</p>

<p>"I never thought, but it would be a good thing to get the money,
too, wouldn't it? Has Archie Jackson been here to-day?"</p>

<p>"Yes. He says that the officer he sent for doesn't come, and
so he's going to be a detective himself."</p>

<p>"A detective," repeated Fred to himself. "That's a man, I believe,
that goes prying around after thieves and bad people, and is pretty
smart in making himself look like other folks."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Aunt Lizzie, "he went all over the house again, and
climbed out on top of the porch, and was crawling around there,
'looking for signs,' as he called them. I don't know how he made
out, but he must have been careless, for he slipped off and came
down on his head and shoulders, and when we ran out to help him
up, said some awful bad words, and went limping down the lane."</p>

<p>"He don't know how to climb," said Fred, as he disposed of his
usual supply of gingerbread; "it takes a boy like me to climb,
a man is always sure to get in trouble."</p>

<p>"Archibald seems to be very unfortunate," said Aunt Annie mildly,
and with a meek smile on her face, "for just before he fell off
the roof of the porch, he came bumping all the way down-stairs
and said the bad man had put oil on them, so as to make him slip
to the bottom. I am quite anxious about him, but I hope no bones
were broken."</p>

<p>"I saw that his hand was swelled up too," said the sister, "and
when I inquired about it he said he caught it in the crack of
the door, playing with his little boy, though I don't see how
that could make such a hurt as his was. But there has been some
one else here."</p>

<p>"Who was that?" asked Fred, excitedly.</p>

<p>"A very nice, gentlemanly person, though he wasn't dressed in
very fine clothes. His name was&mdash;let me see, circus-circum&mdash;no&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Cyrus Sutton?"</p>

<p>"That's it&mdash;yes, that's his name."</p>

<p>"What was he after?" demanded Fred, indignantly.</p>

<p>"He said he was staying in the village a little while, and, having
heard about our loss, he came out to make inquiries."</p>

<p>"I would like to know what business he had to do that," said
the boy, who was sure the old ladies were altogether too credulous
and kind to strangers who presented themselves at their doors.</p>

<p>"Why, Frederick, it was a great favor for him to show such an
interest in our affairs."</p>

<p>"Yes; so it was in them other two chaps, I s'pose; this ain't
the first time Mr. Cyrus Sutton has been in your house."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Frederick?"</p>

<p>"I mean this," answered Fred, wheeling his chair about and slapping
his hand several times upon the table, by way of emphasis, "that
Mr. Cyrus Sutton, as he calls himself, is the man I met in the
lane the other night, and who climbed into the window and helped
the other fellow carry off your plate and money; there!"</p>

<p>The ladies raised their hands in protesting amazement.</p>

<p>"Impossible! You must be mistaken!"</p>

<p>"I know it, and I told him so, too!"</p>

<p>"You did! Didn't he kill you?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," laughed Fred. "I don't feel very dead,
anyway; but though he had on whiskers the other night as the other
one did, I knew his voice."</p>

<p>Young Sheldon did not think it best to say anything about the
suspicion he had formed against Bud Heyland, for that was coming
so near home that it would doubtless cause immediate trouble.</p>

<p>Nor did he tell how he was sure, only a short time before, that
Jacob Kincade was the partner of Bud in the theft, but that the
latter, who handed him the two hundred dollars, was relieved from
all suspicion, at least so far as the lad himself was concerned.</p>

<p>"Have you told Archibald of this?" asked Aunt Lizzie, when Fred
had repeated his declaration several times.</p>

<p>"What's the use of telling him? He would start in such a hurry
to arrest him that he would tumble over something and break his
neck. Then, he'd get the reward, too, and I wouldn't have any
of it."</p>

<p>"We will see that you have justice," said Miss Lizzie, assuringly;
"you deserve it for what you have already done."</p>

<p>"I don't want it, and I won't have it until I can earn it, that's
certain. I must go to school to-morrow, and I brought over two
of my books to study my lessons. I had mother's permission to
stay home to go to the circus, but I was out to-day, and I s'pose
Mr. McCurtis will give me a good whipping for it to-morrow. Anyway,
I'll wear my trousers down, instead of rolling 'em up, till I
learn how the land lies."</p>

<p>This seemed a prudent conclusion, and as the ladies were anxious
that their favorite should keep up with his classes they busied
themselves with their household duties while the lad applied himself
with might and main to his mental work.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour he had mastered it, and asked the
ladies if there was anything he could do for them.</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell Michael," said Aunt Annie, "before he went
home, that we want some groceries from the store, and I would
like him to give the order before coming here in the morning."</p>

<p>"I'll take the order to him if you will write it out."</p>

<p>Thanking him for his courtesy, the order was prepared, and, tucking
it in his pocket, Fred Sheldon started down the road on a trot
to the home of Michael Heyland, the hired man.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether Bud is there?" he said to himself, as he approached
the humble house. "I don't s'pose he'll bother me, but he'll want
to know about that money as soon as he sees me."</p>

<p>Without any hesitation the lad knocked at the door and was bidden
to enter. As he did so he saw that Mrs. Heyland was the only one
at home.</p>

<p>"Michael has gone to the village," said the lady of the house,
in explanation; "but I'm expecting him home in the course of an
hour or so, and perhaps you had better wait."</p>

<p>"I guess there isn't any need of it. Aunt Annie wants him to
take an order to the store to-morrow morning before he comes up
to the house, and I can leave it with you."</p>

<p>"Is it writ out?"</p>

<p>"Yes; here it is," said Fred, laying the piece of folded paper
on the stand beside the Bible and a copy of the Tottenville <em>Weekly
Illuminator</em>.</p>

<p>The lad had no particular excuse for staying longer, but he was
anxious to ask several questions before going back, and he was
in doubt as to how he should go about it.</p>

<p>But when he was invited to sit down he did so, and asked, in
the most natural manner:</p>

<p>"Where is Bud?"</p>

<p>"He's down to the village, too."</p>

<p>"When will he be home?"</p>

<p>"That's a hard question to answer, and I don't think Bud himself
could tell you if he tried. You know he's been traveling so long
with the circus and has so many friends in the village that they
are all glad to see him and won't let him come home. Bud was always
a good boy, and I don't wonder that everybody thinks so much of
him."</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon indulged in a little smile for his own amusement,
but he took care that the doting mother did not notice it.</p>

<p>"Michael was always hard on Bud, but he sees how great his mistake
was, and when he rode by on the big wagon, cracking his whip,
he felt as proud of him as I did."</p>

<p>"Is Bud going to be home long?"</p>

<p>"He got leave of absence for a few days, because the boy isn't
feeling very well. They've worked him too hard altogether. You
observed how pale-looking he is?"</p>

<p>Fred could not say that he had noticed any alarming paleness
about the young man, but he did not deny the assertion of the
mother.</p>

<p>"Does Bud like it with the circus?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and they just dote on him. Bud tells me that Colonel
Bandman, the owner of the circus and menagerie, has told him that
if he keeps on doing so well he's going to take him in as partner
next year."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Heyland, why do you call him Bud?"</p>

<p>"He was such a sweet baby that we nick-named him 'Birdy,' and
it has stuck by him since. When he went to school he was called
Budman, that being a cunning fancy of the darling boy, but his
right name is Nathaniel Higgens, though most people don't know
it."</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon had got the information he was seeking.</p>
