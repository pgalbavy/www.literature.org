<p>Not for an instant. He had decided on his course while leaping
down into the opening which had admitted the imperilled bruin
into safety. The moment he landed he flung his gun away, snatched
off his hat, doffed his coat, seemingly with the same movement,
and leaped with might and main into the terrible current.</p>

<p>The narrow width at this portion caused him to strike within
arm's length of his friend. The left arm of the powerful young
Irishman griped the collar of the sinking youth, and he gave him
a shake fierce enough almost to dislocate his neck.</p>

<p>"Wake up, Whart, ye spalpeen! What's the matter wid ye?"</p>

<p>They were now so close to the falls that the voice of Larry was
indistinct, but the violent shaking did just what was needed.
The half-drowned youth was roused, and stared about him in a bewildered
way. He gasped and began struggling.</p>

<p>"Take it aisy, me boy," added Larry, who could not avoid talking
even in that appalling moment; "ye nadn't try to swim over the
falls, for the water is kind enough to save ye the trouble."</p>

<p>The knowledge that his friend was alive, when he feared he was
not, was enough to send a thrill of pleasure through him, even
though the awakening, as may be said, was on the brink of death
itself.</p>

<p>Young Edwards was still too bewildered to comprehend matters.
His struggling continued, but it was instinctive and naturally
without the least result. His companion retained his grasp on
his collar until he saw that nothing could be gained by it. Then
he let go and gave more attention to himself.</p>

<p>By this time they were on the brink of the falls. The torrent
moved with a calm, swift, hurrying impressiveness that was the
more appalling because of its contrast with the churning hades
of waters below. It was as if the volume, gathering itself for
the plunge, ran forward with eager speed and dived off the rocks
into the boiling cauldron.</p>

<p>Larry Murphy was too wise to make any resistance. He drew in
his breath, cast one look at the white face of his friend, uttered
a prayer for both, and then over they went.</p>

<p>Neither of the youths were ever able to tell clearly what followed
during the few moments, though their experiences must have been
quite similar. Larry Murphy probably kept better track of events
than his companion, because he had not suffered the temporary
daze undergone by him a brief while before.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that on the very brink of the falls he was thrown
bodily outward and downward by some fearful power independent
of the resistless current. The descent, of necessity, was short,
but it appeared to be tenfold its actual length. Then he went
down, down, down, as though he would never stop, until he fancied
that he was driven to the bottom of a watery cavern of immeasurable
depths.</p>

<p>He instinctively held his breath until he felt that the distended
blood-vessels must burst. He was whirled about and tossed hither
and thither amid spray and foam and more sold water, like an egg-shell
in a maelstrom. Then, when he could hold his breath no longer,
he made one spasmodic inhalation. He was almost strangled, but
a part of that which he drew in was air. The next breath was all
air, and then he was swimming in the comparatively smooth water
below the falls.</p>

<p>As soon as he could clear his eyes and look about him, he saw
that he was borne along by the swift current, which was double
the width of the stream above. Instead of the rocky bluffs which
rendered it almost unapproachable in that portion, the banks were
comparatively low and lined with large trees, some of which leaned
out over the water, with their limbs almost touching it.</p>

<p>The most pleasing sight that greeted Larry was that of his friend
in the act of lifting himself upon dry land, with the help of
one of the overhanging limbs. He had escaped and was himself again.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" he called, in a cheery voice, looking around
at Larry, who was swimming hard toward the same point, but would
be unable to strike it until he passed a few rods below.</p>

<p>"I'm not sure, but I think I be; I'll report whin I sets fut
on dry land."</p>

<p>"If you are bruised or hurt, I'll swim out to your help."</p>

<p>"Stay where ye be till I asks ye to do the same."</p>

<p>Wharton moved along the bank, so as to keep pace with his friend.
When the shore was reached he extended his hand and helped him
out, and, as may be supposed, the two greeted each other with
warmth and gratitude.</p>

<p>Wharton explained what a woful mistake he made in his eagerness
to get a shot at the bear, but Larry did not refer to the blunder
he committed when he shot at a fallen tree instead of the brute.</p>

<p>"I wonder where that cratur is?" said he, looking around as if
he expected to see the animal at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Safe beyond any harm from us," replied Wharton; "he had enough
sense to get out of the water before going over the falls."</p>

<p>"And it's yersilf that would have done the same, but for the
whack ye got from trying to bust the rocks apart by jumping against
them."</p>

<p>"That was the stupidest thing I ever did in my life. If I had
taken ten seconds more I could have made the leap as easy as you
can jump over your hat."</p>

<p>"Ye are mighty good at leaping and running, but I wouldn't want
to see ye try that again."</p>

<p>"Which reminds me, Larry, that it's best to go back and get our
guns before some one else finds them for us."</p>

<p>The clothing of the youths was drenched, but they cared nothing
for that, for it was the summer time, and the weather was seasonable.
So far as Larry Murphy could tell, he had received no injury whatever.
His companion suffered somewhat from his collision with the rocks,
but that was of a nature that it must soon pass away, and was
only felt at intervals.</p>

<p>While the couple are making their way to the point above the
falls, where the elder had left his gun and part of his clothing,
we will give a few sentences of explanation.</p>

<p>Brigham Edwards and his family dwelt in one of the small frontier
settlements of Kentucky. His family consisted of his wife, his
only son Wharton, aged seventeen, and the Irish youth, a year
older. They had lived originally in Western Pennsylvania, where
Larry was left to the care and kindness of the well-to-do settler,
who had been one of the best friends his Irish laboring man ever
knew. The mother of Larry died in his infancy, so that he was
an orphan, without any near relatives.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards was among the prominent members of the frontier town,
where he had lived for nearly three years, when the incident just
described occurred. The parents took it into their heads a short
time before to make a visit to some old friends that had settled
in a larger town about a hundred miles farther east. In order
to do so, they mounted their ponies and followed a well-marked
trail, crossing several streams and mountainous sections, and
incurring considerable danger from the Indians, who, in those
days, were nearly always hostile.</p>

<p>About half way between the two settlements stood a block-house,
which was a favorite meeting-place for Boone, Kenton, McClelland,
Wells, and the frontier rangers whose names are linked with the
early history of the great West. It was agreed between the parents
and the boys that they should meet on the return of the former
at this post, and make the rest of the journey together.</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards fixed on the 10th of August as the day he would be
at the block-house. The boys were to arrive no later than that
date, and no sooner than a day before. The parents agreed to wait
twenty-four hours for them if necessary, and then, in case they
did not show up, they were to continue their journey homeward.</p>

<p>The trail was so plain and the route so well known that it was
easy to make accurate calculations, and to figure the time within
a very few hours when the respective parties would reach the block-house.
This figuring, as in these later days, was based on the supposition
that no accident befell any one concerned.</p>

<p>Wharton and Larry had walked about two-thirds of the distance
between their home and the block-house, when they had their flurry
with the huge bear, which certainly did not suffer as much as
they. It was early in the afternoon of the mild summer day, and
they were in the depths of the vast Kentucky wilderness through
which prowled the wild beasts and equally wild red men.</p>

<p>The lads soon reached the spot where Larry had flung his coat
and coonskin cap. The former was picked up, and a short distance
off he found his rifle unharmed. The cap, however, was still missing,
after the two had spent some little time hunting for it.</p>

<p>"Whart," said Larry, stopping short and staring hard at him,
"I know what's become of that fine hat of me own."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The bear sneaked back here and stole it; he's got the laugh
on us so far, but I'll niver be satisfied till we mate again and
adjoost accounts."</p>

<p>"More likely you flung it into the water in your excitement,
and it went over the falls with us."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I think of the same?" asked Larry, with a relieved
expression on his freckled face. "I don't mind its absince, for
I'd rather be widout a hat than to wear one, but the sun harms
me complexion."</p>

<p>"Come on," laughed Wharton, laboriously climbing his way to the
higher bluffs, whither his companion followed him; "I feel a little
uneasy about leaving my rifle so long."</p>

<p>"How are ye going to get to the same?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you."</p>

<p>It will be understood that they had left the water below the
falls on the side from which they had entered it, so that the
weapon lay on the bluffs just across where the owner had flung
it. The athletic youth intended to repeat the leap he made a short
time before, despite the protests of Larry, who had no wish to
make a second descent of the falls in his effort to help his friend.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, go ahead," he said, "if ye find any fun in the same;
we've got a half day to spare, and I s'pose we may as well spend
it in turning flip-flaps off the rocks and over the falls as in
any other way."</p>

<p>"No fear of that," calmly answered his friend, who, having reached
the place, now prepared to make the leap.</p>

<p>The preparations were simple. There was a run of a couple of
rods, all that he needed. Taking a number of short, quick steps,
young Edwards bounded from the edge of the bluff for the opposite
one, whose elevation was about the same.</p>

<p>He formed a striking picture, with his fine athletic form crouching
in mid-air, or sustained for an instant over the rushing torrent
into which he was precipitated on his first effort. His feet were
partly gathered under him, and his bent elbows were close at his
sides in the approved attitude. Larry, who knew the marvellous
powers of his young friend in running or leaping, never felt any
misgiving as to the result, though he pretended to be alarmed.</p>

<p>He saw him alight more than a foot beyond the edge with the grace
of an antelope, taking only a couple of steps forward from the
momentum of his new leap.</p>

<p>"That's aisy," he muttered, "that is, for him as finds it aisy
to do; I'm sure I could make the leap if they'd move the bluffs
about half the distance nearer to this side than the same is at
this moment."</p>

<p>Larry was indulging in these characteristic expressions, when
he thought his friend was acting as though not fully satisfied
with things. He walked a few steps, as if about to lift his gun
from the ground, but abruptly halted, straightened up, and looked
about him in a puzzled way.</p>

<p>At this point the two were so far above the falls that they could
easily understand each other's words without elevating their voices
to an unusual extent. The Irishman's waggery was irrepressible.</p>

<p>"I say, Whart, the bear tuk it the same as me cap; he's going
off with both his arms full."</p>

<p>Young Edwards must have heard the badinage, but he gave no evidence
of it. He stood looking at the ground, but not across the stream,
where his friend was watching him.</p>

<p>"I say, what's the matter?" called Larry, beginning to feel uneasy
at the peculiar action of his friend.</p>

<p>In answer, the younger lad turned about and looked hard at him.
His face was pale, as if he were laboring under great excitement;
beyond question he had made some alarming discovery. Glancing
to the right and left, young Edwards now came to the edge of the
bluff, and making a funnel of one of his hands called out:</p>

<p>"Run, Larry, as quick as you can! don't wait a minute."</p>

<p>"What is it, owld felly?"</p>

<p>"Indians!" was the startling reply; "the woods are full of them."</p>

<p>"Why, then, don't ye run yersilf?" demanded the astounded Larry;
"leap back here, and we'll keep each ither company."</p>

<p>"Run, run!" called his companion, frantically gesticulating and
motioning him away. "They've got my gun, and if they see you,
Larry, you're lost!"</p>

<p>The impetuosity of the youth literally forced the Irish lad away
from the stream and among the trees. He retreated a few yards,
puzzled beyond expression.</p>

<p>"What the mischief can I do?" he asked himself; "I can't jump
more'n half way across the stream, and that won't do me any good.
What does Whart maan by sinding me away while he stays and won't
jump? By the powers! I have it!" he exclaimed, striking his thigh
and stopping short. "It's a maan thrick of his to git me out of
the way, where I won't be harmed, while he rolls up his slaaves
and fights a whole tribe of Injins. That thrick won't work! Larry
Murphy must be counted in."</p>
