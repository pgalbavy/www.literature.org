<p>The Princess Mistchenka came leisurely and gracefully downstairs
a little before eight that evening, much pleased with her hair,
complexion, and gown.</p>

<p>She found Neeland alone in the music-room, standing in the attitude
of the conventional Englishman with his back to the fireless grate
and his hands clasped loosely behind him, waiting to be led out
and fed.</p>

<p>The direct glance of undisguised admiration with which he greeted
the Princess Naïa confirmed the impression she herself had received
from her mirror, and brought an additional dash of colour into
her delicate brunette face.</p>

<p>"Is there any doubt that you are quite the prettiest <em>objet
d'art</em> in Paris?" he enquired anxiously, taking her hand;
and her dark eyes were very friendly as he saluted her finger-tips
with the reverent and slightly exaggerated appreciation of a connoisseur
in sculpture.</p>

<p>"You hopeless Irishman," she laughed. "It's fortunate for women
that you're never serious, even with yourself."</p>

<p>"Princess Naïa," he remonstrated, "can nothing short of kissing
you convince you of my sincerity and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Impudence?" she interrupted smilingly. "Oh, yes, I'm convinced,
James, that, lacking other material, you'd make love to a hitching
post."</p>

<p>His hurt expression and protesting gesture appealed to the universe
against misinterpretation, but the Princess Mistchenka laughed
again unfeelingly, and seated herself at the piano.</p>

<p>"Some day," she said, striking a lively chord or two, "I hope
you'll catch it, young man. You're altogether too free and easy
with your feminine friends.... What do you think of Rue Carew?"</p>

<p>"An astounding and enchanting transformation. I haven't yet recovered
my breath."</p>

<p>"When you do, you'll talk nonsense to the child, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Princess! Have I ever&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You talk little else, dear friend, when God sends a pretty fool
to listen!" She looked up at him from the keyboard over which
her hands were nervously wandering. "I ought to know," she said;
"<em>I</em> also have listened." She laughed carelessly, but her
glance lingered for an instant on his face, and her mirth did
not sound quite spontaneous to either of them.</p>

<p>Two years ago there had been an April evening after the opera,
when, in taking leave of her in her little <em>salon</em>, her
hand had perhaps retained his a fraction of a second longer than
she quite intended; and he had, inadvertently, kissed her.</p>

<p>He had thought of it as a charming and agreeable incident; what
the Princess Naïa Mistchenka thought of it she never volunteered.
But she so managed that he never again was presented with a similar
opportunity.</p>

<p>Perhaps they both were thinking of this rather ancient episode
now, for his face was touched with a mischievously reminiscent
smile, and she had lowered her head a trifle over the keyboard
where her slim, ivory-tinted hands still idly searched after elusive
harmonies in the subdued light of the single lamp.</p>

<p>"There's a man dining with us," she remarked, "who has the same
irresponsible and casual views on life and manners which you entertain.
No doubt you'll get along very well together."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"A Captain Sengoun, one of our attachés. It's likely you'll find
a congenial soul in this same Cossack whom we all call Alak."
She added maliciously: "His only logic is the impulse of the moment,
and he is known as Prince Erlik among his familiars. Erlik was
the Devil, you know&#11834;"</p>

<p>He was announced at that moment, and came marching in&mdash;a dark,
handsome, wiry young man with winning black eyes and a little
black moustache just shadowing his short upper lip&mdash;and a head
shaped to contain the devil himself&mdash;the most reckless looking
head, Neeland thought, that he ever had beheld in all his life.</p>

<p>But the young fellow's frank smile was utterly irresistible,
and his straight manner of facing one, and of looking directly
into the eyes of the person he addressed in his almost too perfect
English, won any listener immediately.</p>

<p>He bowed formally over Princess Naïa's hand, turned squarely
on Neeland when he was named to the American, and exchanged a
firm clasp with him. Then, to the Princess:</p>

<p>"I am late? No? Fancy, Princess&mdash;that great booby, Izzet Bey,
must stop me at the club, and I exceedingly pressed to dress and
entirely out of humour with all Turks. '<em>Eh bien, mon vieux!</em>'
said he in his mincing manner of a nervous pelican, 'they're warming
up the Balkan boilers with Austrian pine. But I hear they're full
of snow.' And I said to him: 'Snow boils very nicely if the fire
is sufficiently persistent!' And I think Izzet Bey will find it
so!"&mdash;with a quick laugh of explanation to Neeland: "He meant
Russian snow, you see; and that boils beautifully if they keep
on stoking the boiler with Austrian fuel."</p>

<p>The Princess shrugged:</p>

<p>"What schoolboy repartée! Why did you answer him at all, Alak?"</p>

<p>"Well," explained the attaché, "as I was due here at eight I
hadn't time to take him by the nose, had I?"</p>

<p>Rue Carew entered and went to the Princess to make amends:</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry to be late!"&mdash;turned to smile at Neeland, then
offered her hand to the Russian. "How do you do, Prince Erlik?"
she said with the careless and gay cordiality of old acquaintance.
"I heard you say something about Colonel Izzet Bey's nose as I
came in."</p>

<p>Captain Sengoun bowed over her slender white hand:</p>

<p>"The Mohammedan nose of Izzet Bey is an admirable bit of Oriental
architecture, Miss Carew. Why should it surprise you to hear me
extol its bizarre beauty?"</p>

<p>"Anyway," said the girl, "I'm contented that you left devilry
for revelry." And, Marotte announcing dinner, she took the arm
of Captain Sengoun as the Princess took Neeland's.</p>

</div>
<p>Like all Russians and some Cossacks, Prince Alak ate and drank
as though it were the most delightful experience in life; and
he did it with a whole-souled heartiness and satisfaction that
was flattering to any hostess and almost fascinating to anybody
observing him.</p>

<p>His teeth were even and very white; his appetite splendid: when
he did his goblet the honour of noticing it at all, it was to
drain it; when he resumed knife and fork he used them as gaily,
as gracefully, and as thoroughly as he used his sabre on various
occasions.</p>

<p>He had taken an instant liking to Neeland, who seemed entirely
inclined to return it; and he talked a great deal to the American
but with a nice division of attention for the two ladies on either
side.</p>

<p>"You know, Alak," said the Princess, "you need not torture yourself
by trying to converse with discretion; because Mr. Neeland knows
about many matters which concern us all."</p>

<p>"Ah! That is delightful! And indeed I was already quite assured
of Mr. Neeland's intelligent sympathy in the present state of
European affairs."</p>

<p>"He's done a little more than express sympathy," remarked the
Princess; and she gave a humorous outline of Neeland's part in
the affair of the olive-wood box.</p>

<p>"Fancy!" exclaimed Captain Sengoun. "That impudent <em>canaille</em>!
Yes; I heard at the Embassy what happened to that accursed box
this morning. Of course it is a misfortune, but as for me, personally,
I don't care&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't happen to concern you personally, Prince Erlik,"
said Princess Naïa dryly.</p>

<p>"No," he admitted, unabashed by the snub, "it does not touch
me. Cavalry cannot operate on the Gallipoli Peninsula. Therefore,
God be thanked, I shall be elsewhere when the snow boils."</p>

<p>Rue tuned to Neeland:</p>

<p>"His one idea of diplomacy and war is a thousand Kuban Cossacks
at full speed."</p>

<p>"And that is an excellent idea, is it not, Kazatchka?" he said,
smiling impudently at the Princess, who only laughed at the familiarity.</p>

<p>"I hope," added Captain Sengoun, "that I may live to gallop through
a few miles of diplomacy at full speed before they consign me
to the Opolchina." Turning to Neeland, "The reserve&mdash;the old man's
home, you know. God forbid!" And he drained his goblet and looked
defiantly at Rue Carew.</p>

<p>"A Cossack is a Cossack," said the Princess, "be he Terek or
Kuban, Don or Astrachan, and they all know as much about diplomacy
as Prince Erlik&mdash;or Izzet Bey's nose.... James, you are unusually
silent, dear friend. Are you regretting those papers?"</p>

<p>"It's a pity," he said. But he had not been thinking of the lost
papers; Rue Carew's beauty preoccupied him. The girl was in black,
which made her skin dazzling, and reddened the chestnut colour
of her hair.</p>

<p>Her superb young figure revealed an unsuspected loveliness where
the snowy symmetry of neck and shoulders and arms was delicately
accented by the filmy black of her gown.</p>

<p>He had never seen such a beautiful girl; she seemed more wonderful,
more strange, more aloof than ever. And this was what preoccupied
and entirely engaged his mind, and troubled it, so that his smile
had a tendency to become indefinite and his conversation mechanical
at times.</p>

<p>Captain Sengoun drained one more of numerous goblets; gazed sentimentally
at the Princess, then with equal sentiment at Rue Carew.</p>

<p>"As for me," he said, with a carelessly happy gesture toward
the infinite, "plans are plans, and if they're stolen, <em>tant
pis</em>! But there are always Tartars in Tartary and Turks in
Turkey. And, while there are, there's hope for a poor devil of
a Cossack who wants to say a prayer in St. Sophia before he's
gathered to his ancestors."</p>

<p>"Have any measures been taken at your Embassy to trace the plans?"
asked Neeland of the Princess.</p>

<p>"Of course," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Plans," remarked Sengoun, "are not worth the <em>tcherkeske</em>
of an honest Caucasian! A Khirgize pony knows more than any diplomat;
and my <em>magaika</em> is better than both!"</p>

<p>"All the same," said Rue Carew, "with those stolen plans in your
Embassy, Prince Erlik, you might even gallop a <em>sotnia</em>
of your Cossacks to the top of Achi-Baba."</p>

<p>"By heaven! I'd like to try!" he exclaimed, his black eyes ablaze.</p>

<p>"There are <em>dongas</em>," observed the Princess dryly.</p>

<p>"I know it. There are <em>dongas</em> every twenty yards; and
Turkish gorse that would stop a charging bull! My answer is, mount!
trot! gallop! and hurrah for Achi-Baba!"</p>

<p>"Very picturesque, Alak. But wouldn't it be nicer to be able
to come back again and tell us all about it?"</p>

<p>"As for that," he said with his full-throated, engaging laugh,
"no need to worry, Princess, for the newspapers would tell the
story. What is this Gallipoli country, anyway, that makes our
Chancellery wag its respected head and frown and whisper in corners
and take little notes on its newly laundered cuffs?</p>

<p>"I know the European and Asiatic shores with their forts &mdash;Kilid
Bahr, Chimilik, Kum Kale, Dardanos. I know what those Germans
have been about with their barbed wire and mobile mortar batteries.
What do we want of their plans, then&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Nothing, Prince Erlik!" said Rue, laughing. "It suffices that
you be appointed adviser in general to his majesty the Czar."</p>

<p>Sengoun laughed with all his might.</p>

<p>"And an excellent thing that would be, Miss Carew. What we need
in Russia," he added with a bow to the Princess, "are, first of
all, more Kazatchkee, then myself to execute any commands with
which my incomparable Princess might deign to honour me."</p>

<p>"Then I command you to go and smoke cigarettes in the music-room
and play some of your Cossack songs on the piano for Mr. Neeland
until Miss Carew and I rejoin you," said the Princess, rising.</p>

<p>At the door there was a moment of ceremony; then Sengoun, passing
his arm through Neeland's with boyish confidence that his quickly
given friendship was welcome, sauntered off to the music-room
where presently he was playing the piano and singing some of the
entrancing songs of his own people in a voice that, cultivated,
might have made a fortune for him:</p>

<p>  "We are but horsemen,   And God is great.   We hunt on hill
and fen   The fierce Kerait,   Naiman and Eighur,   Tartar and
Khiounnou,   Leopard and Tiger   Flee at our view-halloo;   We
are but horsemen   Cleansing the hill and fen   Where wild men
hide-  Wild beasts abide,   Mongol and Baïaghod,   Turkoman, Taïdjigod,  
Each in his den.   The skies are blue,   The plains are wide,  
Over the fens the horsemen ride!"</p>

<p>Still echoing the wild air, and playing with both hands in spite
of the lighted cigarette between his fingers, he glanced over
his shoulder at Neeland:</p>

<p>"A very old, old song," he explained, "made in the days of the
great invasion when all the world was fighting anybody who would
fight back. I made it into English. It's quite nice, I think."</p>

<p>His naïve pleasure in his own translation amused Neeland immensely,
and he said that he considered it a fine piece of verse.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Sengoun, "but you ought to hear a love song I made
out of odd fragments I picked up here and there. I call it '<em>Samarcand</em>';
or rather '<em>Samarcand Mahfouzeh</em>,' which means, 'Samarcand
the Well Guarded':</p>

<p>  "'Outside my guarded door   Whose voice repeats my name?'  
'The voice thou hast heard before   Under the white moon's flame!  
And thy name is my song; and my song is ever the same!'</p>

<p>  "'How many warriors, dead,   Have sung the song you sing?  
Some by an arrow were sped;   Some by a dagger's sting.'   'Like
a bird in the night is my song&mdash;a bird on the wing!'</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Ahmed and Yucouf bled!<br/>
A dead king blocks my door!'<br/>
'If thy halls and walls be red,<br/>
Shall Samarcand ask more?<br/>
Or my song shall cleanse thy house or my heart's blood<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foul thy floor!'

</p>
</div>
<p>  "'Now hast thou conquered me!   Humbly thy captive, I.   My
soul escapes to thee;   My body here must lie;   Ride!&mdash;with thy
song, and my soul in thy arms; and let me die.'"</p>

<p>Sengoun, still playing, flung over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"A Tartar song from the Turcoman. I borrowed it and put new clothes
on it. Nice, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Enchanting!" replied Neeland, laughing in spite of himself.</p>

<p>Rue Carew, with her snowy shoulders and red-gold hair, came drifting
in, consigning them to their seats with a gesture, and giving
them to understand that she had come to hear the singing.</p>

<p>So Sengoun continued his sketchy, haphazard recital, waving his
cigarette now and then for emphasis, and conversing frequently
over his shoulder while Rue Carew leaned on the piano and gravely
watched his nimble fingers alternately punish and caress the keyboard.</p>

<p>After a little while the Princess Mistchenka came in saying that
she had letters to write. They conversed, however, for nearly
an hour before she rose, and Captain Sengoun gracefully accepted
his <em>congé</em>.</p>

<p>"I'll walk with you, if you like," suggested Neeland.</p>

<p>"With pleasure, my dear fellow! The night is beautiful, and I
am just beginning to wake up."</p>

<p>"Ask Marotte to give you a key, then," suggested the Princess,
going. At the foot of the stairs, however, she paused to exchange
a few words with Captain Sengoun in a low voice; and Neeland,
returning with his latchkey, went over to where Rue stood by the
lamplit table absently looking over an evening paper.</p>

<p>As he came up beside her, the girl lifted her beautiful, golden-grey
eyes.</p>

<p>"Are you going out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought I'd walk a bit with Captain Sengoun."</p>

<p>"It's rather a long distance to the Russian Embassy. Besides&#11834;"
She hesitated, and he waited. She glanced absently over the paper
for a moment, then, not raising her eyes: "I'm &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>the
theft of that box today&mdash;perhaps my nerves have suffered a little&mdash;but
do you think it quite prudent for you to go out alone at night?"</p>

<p>"Why, I am going out with Captain Sengoun!" he said, surprised
at her troubled face.</p>

<p>"But you will have to return alone."</p>

<p>He laughed, but they both had flushed a little.</p>

<p>Had it been any other woman in the world, he had not hesitated
gaily to challenge the shy and charming solicitude expressed in
his behalf&mdash;make of it his capital, his argument to force that
pretty duel to which one day, all youth is destined.</p>

<p>He found himself now without a word to say, nor daring to entertain
any assumption concerning the words she had uttered.</p>

<p>Dumb, awkward, afraid, he became conscious that something in
this young girl had silenced within him any inclination to gay
effrontery, any talent for casual gallantry. Her lifted eyes,
with their clear, half shy regard, had killed all fluency of tongue
in him&mdash;slain utterly that light good-humour with which he had
encountered women heretofore.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought myself in any danger whatever. Is there any
reason for me to expect further trouble?"</p>

<p>Rue raised her troubled eyes:</p>

<p>"Has it occurred to you that <em>they</em> might think you capable
of redrawing parts of the stolen plans from memory?"</p>

<p>"It had never occurred to me," he admitted, surprised. "But I
believe I could remember a little about one or two of the more
general maps."</p>

<p>"The Princess means to ask you, tomorrow, to draw for her what
you can remember. And that made me think about you now&mdash;whether
the <em>others</em> might not suspect you capable of remembering
enough to do them harm.... And so&mdash;do you think it prudent to
go out tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, quite sincerely, "it is all right. You see
I know Paris very well."</p>

<p>She did not look convinced, but Sengoun came up and she bade
them both good night and went away with the Princess Mistchenka.</p>

<p>As, arm in arm, the two young men sauntered around the corner
of the rue Soleil d'Or, two men who had been sitting on a marble
bench beside the sun-dial fountain rose and strolled after them.</p>
