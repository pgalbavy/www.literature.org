<p>Mrs. Baxter was troubled. During the afternoon she glanced often
from the open window of the room where she had gone to sew, but
the peaceful neighborhood continued to be peaceful, and no sound
of the harassed footsteps of William echoed from the pavement.
However, she saw Genesis arrive (in his weekday costume) to do
some weeding, and Jane immediately skip forth for mingled purposes
of observation and conversation.</p>

<p>"What DO they say?" thought Mrs. Baxter, observing that both
Jane and Genesis were unusually animated. But for once that perplexity
was to be dispersed. After an exciting half-hour Jane came flying
to her mother, breathless.</p>

<p>"Mamma," she cried, "I know where Willie is! Genesis told me,
'cause he saw him, an' he talked to him while he was doin' it."</p>

<p>"Doing what? Where?"</p>

<p>"Mamma, listen! What you think Willie's doin'? I bet you can't
g&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jane!" Mrs Baxter spoke sharply. "Tell me what Genesis said,
at once."</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Willie's sittin' in a lumber-yard that Genesis comes
by on his way from over on the avynoo where all the colored people
live&mdash;an' he's countin' knot-holes in shingles."</p>

<p>"He is <em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Genesis knows all about it, because he was thinkin' of
doin' it himself, only he says it would be too slow. This is the
way it is, mamma. Listen, mamma, because this is just exackly
the way it is. Well, this lumber-yard man got into some sort of
a fuss because he bought millions an' millions of shingles, mamma,
that had too many knots in, an' the man don't want to pay for
'em, or else the store where he bought 'em won't take 'em back,
an' they got to prove how many shingles are bad shingles, or somep'm,
an' anyway, mamma, that's what Willie's doin'. Every time he comes
to a bad shingle, mamma, he puts it somewheres else, or somep'm
like that, mamma, an' every time he's put a thousand bad shingles
in this other place they give him six cents. He gets the six cents
to keep, mamma&mdash;an' that's what he's been doin' all day!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but that's nothing, mamma&mdash;just you wait till you hear the
rest. <em>THAT </em>part of it isn't anything a <em>TALL, </em>mamma!
You wouldn't hardly notice that part of it if you knew the other
part of it, mamma. Why, that isn't <em>ANYTHING!" </em>Jane made
demonstrations of scorn for the insignificant information already
imparted.</p>

<p>"Jane!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm?"</p>

<p>"I want to know everything Genesis told you," said her mother,
"and I want you to tell it as quickly as you can."</p>

<p>"Well, I AM tellin' it, mamma!" Jane protested. "I'm just <em>BEGINNING
</em>to tell it. I can't tell it unless there's a beginning, can
I? How could there be <em>ANYTHING </em>unless you had to begin
it, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Try your best to go on, Jane!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Well, Genesis says &mdash;Mamma!" Jane interrupted herself
with a little outcry. "Oh! I bet <em>THAT'S </em>what he had those
two market-baskets for! Yes, sir! That's just what he did! An'
then he needed the rest o' the money an' you an' papa wouldn't
give him any, an' so he began countin' shingles to-day 'cause
to-night's the night of the party an' he just <em>HASS </em>to
have it!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter, who had risen to her feet, recalled the episode
of the baskets and sank into a chair. "How did Genesis know Willie
wanted forty dollars, and if Willie's pawned something how did
Genesis know <em>THAT? </em>Did Willie tell Gen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no, mamma, Willie didn't want forty dollars&mdash;only fourteen!"</p>

<p>"But he couldn't get even the cheapest readymade dress-suit for
fourteen dollars."</p>

<p>"Mamma, you're gettin' it all mixed up!" Jane cried. "Listen,
mamma! Genesis knows all about a second-hand store over on the
avynoo; an' it keeps 'most everything, an' Genesis says it's the
nicest store! It keeps waiter suits all the way up to nineteen
dollars and ninety-nine cents. Well, an' Genesis wants to get
one of those suits, so he goes in there all the time, an' talks
to the man an' bargains an' bargains with him, 'cause Genesis
says this man is the bargainest man in the wide worl', mamma!
That's what Genesis says. Well, an' so this man's name is One-eye
Beljus, mamma. That's his name, an' Genesis says so. Well, an'
so this man that Genesis told me about, that keeps the store &mdash;I
mean One-eye Beljus, mamma&mdash;well, One-eye Beljus had Willie's
name written down in a book, an' he knew Genesis worked for fam'lies
that have boys like Willie in 'em, an' this morning One-eye Beljus
showed Genesis Willie's name written down in this book, an' One-eye
Beljus asked Genesis if he knew anybody by that name an' all about
him. Well, an' so at first Genesis pretended he was tryin' to
remember, because he wanted to find out what Willie went there
for. Genesis didn't tell any stories, mamma; he just pretended
he couldn't remember, an' so, well, One-eye Beljus kept talkin'
an' pretty soon Genesis found out all about it. One-eye Beljus
said Willie came in there an' tried on the coat of one of those
waiter suits&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh no!" gasped Mrs. Baxter.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, an' One-eye Beljus said it was the only one that would
fit Willie, an' One-eye Beljus told Willie that suit was worth
fourteen dollars, an' Willie said he didn't have any money, but
he'd like to trade something else for it. Well, an' so One-eye
Beljus said this was an awful fine suit an' the only one he had
that had b'longed to a white gentleman. Well, an' so they bargained,
an' bargained, an' bargained, an' <em>BARGAINED! </em>An' then,
well, an' so at last Willie said he'd go an' get everything that
b'longed to him, an' One-eye Beljus could pick out enough to make
fourteen dollars' worth, an' then Willie could have the suit.
Well, an' so Willie came home an' put everything he had that b'longed
to him into those two baskets, mamma&mdash;that's just what he did,
'cause Genesis says he told One-eye Beljus it was everything that
b'longed to him, an' that would take two baskets, mamma. Well,
then, an' so he told One-eye Beljus to pick out fourteen dollars'
worth, an' One-eye Beljus ast Willie if he didn't have a watch.
Well, Willie took out his watch an' One-eye Beljus said it was
an awful bad watch, but he would put it in for a dollar; an' he
said, 'I'll put your necktie pin in for forty cents more,' so
Willie took it out of his necktie an' then One-eye Beljus said
it would take all the things in the baskets to make I forget how
much, mamma, an' the watch would be a dollar more, an' the pin
forty cents, an' that would leave just three dollars an' sixty
cents more for Willie to pay before he could get the suit."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter's face had become suffused with high color, but she
wished to know all that Genesis had said, and, mastering her feelings
with an effort, she told Jane to proceed&mdash;a command obeyed after
Jane had taken several long breaths.</p>

<p>"Well, an' so the worst part of it is, Genesis says, it's because
that suit is haunted."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm," said Jane, solemnly; "Genesis says it's haunted. Genesis
says everybody over on the avynoo knows all about that suit, an'
he says that's why One-eye Beljus never could sell it before.
Genesis says One-eye Beljus tried to sell it to a colored man
for three dollars, but the man said he wouldn't put in on for
three hunderd dollars, an' Genesis says HE wouldn't, either, because
it belonged to a Dago waiter that&mdash;that&mdash;" Jane's voice sank to
a whisper of unctuous horror. She was having a wonderful time!
"Mamma, this Dago waiter, he lived over on the avynoo, an' he
took a case-knife he'd sharpened &mdash;AN' HE <em>CUT A LADY'S
HEAD OFF WITH IT</em>!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter screamed faintly.</p>

<p>"An' he got hung, mamma! If you don't believe it, you can ask
One-eye Beljus &mdash;I guess HE knows! An' you can ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!"</p>

<p>"An' he sold this suit to One-eye Beljus when he was in jail,
mamma. He sold it to him before he got hung, mamma."</p>

<p>"Hush, Jane!"</p>

<p>But Jane couldn't hush now. "An' he had that suit on when he
cut the lady's head off, mamma, an' that's why it's haunted. They
cleaned it all up excep' a few little spots of bl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>JANE!" </em>shouted her mother. "You must not talk about
such things, and Genesis mustn't tell, you stories of that sort!"</p>

<p>"Well, how could he help it, if he told me about Willie?" Jane
urged, reasonably.</p>

<p>"Never mind! Did that crazy ch &mdash;Did Willie <em>LEAVE </em>the
baskets in that dreadful place?"</p>

<p>"Yes'm&mdash;an' his watch an' pin," Jane informed her, impressively.
"An' One-eye Beljus wanted to know if Genesis knew Willie, because
One-eye Beljus wanted to know if Genesis thought Willie could
get the three dollars an; sixty cents, an' One-eye Beljus wanted
to know if Genesis thought he could get anything more out of him
besides that. He told Genesis he hadn't told Willie he <em>COULD
</em>have the suit, after all; he just told him he <em>THOUGHT
</em>he could, but he wouldn't say for certain till he brought
him the three dollars an' sixty cents. So Willie left all his
things there, an' his watch an&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That will do!" Mrs. Baxter's voice was sharper than it had ever
been in Jane's recollection. "I don't need to hear any more&mdash;and
I don't <em>WANT </em>to hear any more!"</p>

<p>Jane was justly aggrieved. "But, mamma, it isn't MY fault!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter's lips parted to speak, but she checked herself.
"Fault?"  she said, gravely. "I wonder whose fault it really is!"</p>

<p>And with that she went hurriedly into William's room and made
a brief inspection of his clothes-closet and dressing-table. Then,
as Jane watched her in awed silence, she strode to the window,
and called, loudly:</p>

<p>"Genesis!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm?" came the voice from below.</p>

<p>"Go to that lumber-yard where Mr. William is at work and bring
him here to me at once. If he declines to come, tell him&mdash;" Her
voice broke oddly; she choked, but Jane could not decide with
what emotion. "Tell him&mdash;tell him I ordered you to use force if
necessary! Hurry!"</p>

<p>"<em>YES'M</em>!"</p>

<p>Jane ran to the window in time to see Genesis departing seriously
through the back gate.</p>

<p>"Mamma&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me now, Jane," Mrs. Baxter said, crisply. "I want
you to go down in the yard, and when Willie comes tell him I'm
waiting for him here in his own room. And don't come with him,
Jane. Run!"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma." Jane was pleased with this appointment; she anxiously
desired to be the first to see how Willie "looked."</p>

<p>... He looked flurried and flustered and breathless, and there
were blisters upon the reddened palms of his hands. "What on earth's
the matter, mother?" he asked, as he stood panting before her.
"Genesis said something was wrong, and he said you told him to
hit me if I wouldn't come."</p>

<p>"Oh NO!" she cried. "I only meant I thought perhaps you wouldn't
obey any ordinary message&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, well, it doesn't matter, but please hurry and say what
you want to, because I got to get back and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Baxter said, quietly, "you're not going back to count
any more shingles, Willie. How much have you earned?"</p>

<p>He swallowed, but spoke bravely. "Thirty-six cents. But I've
been getting lots faster the last two hours and there's a good
deal of time before six o'clock. Mother&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," she said. "You're going over to that horrible place where
you've left your clothes and your watch and all those other things
in the two baskets, and you're going to bring them home at once."</p>

<p>"Mother!" he cried, aghast. "Who told you?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. You don't want your father to find out, do
you? Then get those things back here as quickly as you can. They'll
have to be fumigated after being in that den."</p>

<p>"They've never been out of the baskets," he protested, hotly,
"except just to be looked at. They're MY things, mother, and I
had a right to do what I needed to with 'em, didn't I?" His utterance
became difficult. "You and father just <em>CAN'T </em>understand&mdash;and
you won't do anything to help me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Willie, you can go to the party," she said, gently. "You didn't
need those frightful clothes at all."</p>

<p>"I do!" he cried. "I <em>GOT </em>to have 'em! I <em>CAN'T </em>go
in my day clo'es! There's a reason you wouldn't understand why
I can't. I just <em>CAN'T</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "you can go to the party."</p>

<p>"I can't, either! Not unless you give me three dollars and twenty-four
cents, or unless I can get back to the lumber-yard and earn the
rest before&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No!" And the warm color that had rushed over Mrs. Baxter during
Jane's sensational recital returned with a vengeance. Her eyes
flashed. "If you'd rather I sent a policeman for those baskets,
I'll send one. I should prefer to do it&mdash;much! And to have that
rascal arrested. If you don't want me to send a policeman you
can go for them yourself, but you must start within ten minutes,
because if you don't I'll telephone headquarters. Ten minutes,
Willie, and I mean it!"</p>

<p>He cried out, protesting. She would make him a thing of scorn
forever and soil his honor, if she sent a policeman. Mr. Beljus
was a fair and honest tradesman, he explained, passionately, and
had not made the approaches in this matter. Also, the garments
in question, though not entirely new, nor of the highest mode,
were of good material and in splendid condition. Unmistakably
they were evening clothes, and such a bargain at fourteen dollars
that William would guarantee to sell them for twenty after he
had worn them this one evening. Mr. Beljus himself had said that
he would not even think of letting them go at fourteen to anybody
else, and as for the two poor baskets of worn and useless articles
offered in exchange, and a bent scarfpin and a worn-out old silver
watch that had belonged to great-uncle Ben&mdash;why, the ten dollars
and forty cents allowed upon them was beyond all ordinary liberality;
it was almost charity. There was only one place in town where
evening clothes were rented, and the suspicious persons in charge
had insisted that William obtain from his father a guarantee to
insure the return of the garments in perfect condition. So that
was hopeless. And wasn't it better, also, to wear clothes which
had known only one previous occupant (as was the case with Mr.
Beljus's offering) than to hire what chance hundreds had hired?
Finally, there was only one thing to be considered and this was
the fact that William <em>HAD </em>to have those clothes!</p>

<p>"Six minutes," said Mrs. Baxter, glancing implacably at her watch.
"When it's ten I'll telephone."</p>

<p>And the end of it was, of course, victory for the woman&mdash;victory
both moral and physical. Three-quarters of an hour later she was
unburdening the contents of the two baskets and putting the things
back in place, illuminating these actions with an expression of
strong distaste&mdash;in spite of broken assurances that Mr. Beljus
had not more than touched any of the articles offered to him for
valuation.</p>

<p>... At dinner, which was unusually early that evening, Mrs. Baxter
did not often glance toward her son; she kept her eyes from that
white face and spent most of her time in urging upon Mr. Baxter
that he should be prompt in dressing for a card-club meeting which
he and she were to attend that evening. These admonitions of hers
were continued so pressingly that Mr. Baxter, after protesting
that there was no use in being a whole hour too early, groaningly
went to dress without even reading his paper.</p>

<p>William had retired to his own room, where he lay upon his bed
in the darkness. He heard the evening noises of the house faintly
through the closed door: voices and the clatter of metal and china
from the far-away kitchen, Jane's laugh in the hall, the opening
and closing of the doors. Then his father seemed to be in distress
about something. William heard him complaining to Mrs. Baxter,
and though the words were indistinct, the tone was vigorously
plaintive. Mrs. Baxter laughed and appeared to make light of his
troubles, whatever they were&mdash;and presently their footsteps were
audible from the stairway; the front door closed emphatically,
and they were gone.</p>

<p>Everything was quiet now. The open window showed as a greenish
oblong set in black, and William knew that in a little while there
would come through the stillness of that window the distant sound
of violins. That was a moment he dreaded with a dread that ached.
And as he lay on his dreary bed he thought of brightly lighted
rooms where other boys were dressing eagerly faces and hair shining,
hearts beating high&mdash;boys who would possess this last evening
and the "last waltz together," the last smile and the last sigh.</p>

<p>It did not once enter his mind that he could go to the dance
in his "best suit," or that possibly the other young people at
the party would be too busy with their own affairs to notice particularly
what he wore. It was the unquestionable and granite fact, to his
mind, that the whole derisive World would know the truth about
his earlier appearances in his father's clothes. And that was
a form of ruin not to be faced. In the protective darkness and
seclusion of William's bedroom, it is possible that smarting eyes
relieved themselves by blinking rather energetically; it is even
possible that there was a minute damp spot upon the pillow. Seventeen
cannot always manage the little boy yet alive under all the coverings.</p>

<p>Now arrived that moment he had most painfully anticipated, and
dance-music drifted on the night;&mdash;but there came a tapping upon
his door and a soft voice spoke.</p>

<p>"Will-ee?"</p>

<p>With a sharp exclamation William swung his legs over the edge
of the bed and sat up. Of all things he desired not, he desired
no conversation with, or on the part of, Jane. But he had forgotten
to lock his door&mdash;the handle turned, and a dim little figure marched
in.</p>

<p>"Willie, Adelia's goin' to put me to bed."</p>

<p>"You g'way from here," he said, huskily. "I haven't got time
to talk to you. I'm busy."</p>

<p>"Well, you can wait a minute, can't you?" she asked, reasonably.
"I haf to tell you a joke on mamma."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear any jokes!"</p>

<p>"Well, I <em>HAF </em>to tell you this one 'cause she told me
to! Oh!" Jane clapped her hand over her mouth and jumped up and
down, offering a fantastic silhouette against the light of the
Open door. "Oh, oh, OH!"</p>

<p>"What's matter?"</p>

<p>"She said I mustn't, <em>MUSTN'T </em>tell that she told me to
tell! My goodness! I forgot that! Mamma took me off alone right
after dinner, an' she told me to tell you this joke on her a little
after she an' papa had left the house, but she said, 'Above all
<em>THINGS,' </em>she said, '<em>DON'T </em>let Willie know <em>I</em>
said to tell him.' That's just what she said, an' here that's
the very first thing I had to go an' do!"</p>

<p>"Well, what of it?"</p>

<p>Jane quieted down. The pangs of her remorse were lost in her
love of sensationalism, and her voice sank to the thrilling whisper
which it was one of her greatest pleasures to use. "Did you hear
what a fuss papa was makin' when he was dressin' for the card-party?"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't care if&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He had to go in his reg'lar clo'es!" whispered Jane, triumphantly.
"An' this is the joke on mamma: you know that tailor that let
papa's dress-suit 'way, 'way out; well, Mamma thinks that tailor
must think she's crazy, or somep'm 'cause she took papa's dress-suit
to him last Monday to get it pressed for this card-party, an she
guesses he must of understood her to tell him to do lots besides
just pressin' it. Anyway, he went an' altered it, an' he took
it 'way, 'way IN again; an' this afternoon when it came back it
was even tighter 'n what it was in the first place, an' papa couldn't
<em>BEGIN </em>to get into it! Well, an' so it's all pressed an'
ev'ything, an' she stopped on the way out, an' whispered to me
that she'd got so upset over the joke on her that she couldn't
remember where she put it when she took it out o' papa's room
after he gave up tryin' to get inside of it. An' that," cried
Jane&mdash;"that's the funniest thing of all! Why, it's layin' right
on her bed this very minute!"</p>

<p>In one bound William leaped through the open door. Two seconds
sufficed for his passage through the hall to his mother's bedroom&mdash;and
there, neatly spread upon the lace coverlet and brighter than
coronation robes, fairer than Joseph's holy coat, It lay!</p>
