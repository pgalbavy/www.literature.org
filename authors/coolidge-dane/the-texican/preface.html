<p>    "Oh, out from old Missouri<br/>
      I set me forth to roam<br/>
    Indicted by a jury<br/>
      For toling hawgs from home.
</p><p>    "With faithful Buck and Crowder<br/>
      I crossed the Western plains<br/>
    Then turned them loose in the Cow-Country<br/>
      And waited for my gains.
</p><p>    "And now I'm called a Cattle King<br/>
      With herds on many a streamâ€”<br/>
    And all from the natural increase<br/>
    Of that faithful old ox-team."<br/>
