<p><strong>Author's Note</strong></p>

<p>The tremendous event of the 4th. of June, whose consequences affected
the relations of the two great Western nations even more profoundly
than did the war, has called forth, during the last fifty years, a
constant efflorescence of books, memoirs and scientific studies of
truthful reports and fabulous narratives. Eye-witnesses have related
their impressions; journalists have collected their articles into
volumes; scientists have published the results of their researches;
novelists have imagined unknown tragedies; and poets have lifted up
their voices. There is no detail of that tragic day but has been
brought to light; and this is true likewise of the days which went
before and of those which came after and of all the reactions, moral
or social, economic or political, by which it made itself felt,
throughout the twentieth century, in the destinies of the world.
</p>

<p>There was nothing lacking but Simon Dubosc's own story. And it was
strange that we should have known only by reports, usually fantastic,
the part played by the man who, first by chance and then by his
indomitable courage and later still by his clear-sighted enthusiasm,
was thrust into the very heart of the adventure.
</p>

<p>To-day, when the nations are gathered about the statue over-looking
the arena in which the hero fought, does it not seem permissible to
add to the legend the embellishment of a reality which will not
misrepresent it? And, if it is found that this reality trenches too
closely upon the man's private life, need we object?
</p>

<p>It was in Simon Dubosc that the western spirit first became conscious
of itself and it is the whole man that belongs to history.
