<p>You have not forgotten what I told you about the mountain range,
which shuts in Wyoming Valley on the east. It is a thousand feet
in height, abounding with ravines, clefts, rocks, boulders and
the most rugged kind of places.</p>

<p>The fugitives who fled from the Susquehanna to escape the Indians
had to make their way over these mountains, and then find their
way through sixty miles of trackless woods to the Delaware River.
A great many succeeded in doing so, but the deaths and sufferings
in the vast stretch of forest gave it the dreadful name of "The
Shades of Death," by which it is often referred to even to this
day.</p>

<p>Omas swam at the rear of the small canoe, as I told you, with
Mrs. Ripley and her two children seated inside and balancing themselves
with great care to prevent the heavily loaded craft from sinking
or overturning.</p>

<p>More than one Seneca or Oneida Indian, or perhaps a Tory, that
had chased some terrified fugitives to the edge of the river,
halted and made ready to fire upon the canoe, whose occupants
were seen to be three white persons.</p>

<p>When they looked again, however, they observed the head and shoulders
of an Indian warrior, who was plainly propelling the craft in
front of him. That was enough to satisfy them.</p>

<p>On the way over, Linna, the little Indian girl, amused herself
by diving under the canoe, sometimes appearing on one side and
then on the other, sometimes in front and then at the rear. She
even ventured to impose upon her father by splashing water in
his painted face. She did little of that, and he paid no attention
to it.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet set when the grim warrior and his child emerged
on the eastern shore, their garments dripping, but caring nothing
for that. The boat was drawn far enough up the bank to prevent
its being swept away by the current, and then all stood side by
side, and as if by a common impulse, looked back at the shore
they had left.</p>

<p>The smoke from the burning Fort Wintermoot still rested on the
calm surface of the river, and filtered among the green vegetation
near the scene of the battle. Other buildings had been fired,
and mingled their vapor with it.</p>

<p>Here and there, every minute or two, sounded the sharp crack
of a rifle. This too often meant that some fugitive had been run
down by his cruel pursuer, who listened to no pleadings for mercy.
A good many had taken refuge on Monacacy Island, from which the
reports of guns continually came.</p>

<p>I have not the space here to tell you of the wonderful escapes
at Wyoming, the particulars of which I have given in another work.</p>

<p>One boy, who was with several men near Fort Jenkins before the
battle, saw all the men shot down or captured; but he hid himself
among some willows and was not noticed.</p>

<p>If you ever visit the scene of the battle, you will notice a
broad, flat stone, called Queen Esther's Rock, a half dozen miles
below Wilkesbarre. Queen Esther was an old, cruel, half breed
woman who came with the Indians. She is sometimes known as Katharine
Montour. A son of hers was killed in the conflict, and she was
so angered that she had sixteen captives placed around the rock,
and meant to slay them all, while the warriors prevented them
from escaping.</p>

<p>Nevertheless two of the young men jumped up and started on a
run for the river. The guards dashed after them. One caught his
toe, and rolled headlong down the bank into some bushes. Instead
of springing up again, as he first started to do, he lay still,
and though the Indians almost stepped upon him, he was not discovered,
and got off without harm.</p>

<p>The other reached the river, took a running leap and dived, and
swam under water as far as he could. When he came up to breathe,
the waiting red men fired at him again and again. He was wounded,
but not badly, and, reaching the other side, caught a stray horse,
made a bridle from a hickory withe, and soon joined his friend.</p>

<p>Another fugitive, after running until he was so tired out he
could hardly stand, and hearing the Indians near, backed into
a hollow log and awaited his fate. He had been in the hollow but
a few minutes when a spider spun its web across the entrance.
A few minutes later, two warriors sat down on the log. They noticed
how good a hiding place it would be for the white man, and one
of them leaned over to peep in. As he did so, he saw the spider
web. He was sure that it would not be there if the man was inside,
and did not search further. When the warriors left, the man crawled
out and got safely away.</p>

<p>You know that the home of the Ripleys was on the eastern shore,
which they left that same morning. They had crossed over in a
large flatboat with a number of other families, so that now they
were near their own home again. Omas had guided the canoe, too,
so they landed not far from the little structure.</p>

<p>"Omas," said the mother, "I understand you wish us to go to the
Delaware."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, "Iroquois won't hurt you there&mdash;must go."</p>

<p>"We haven't a particle of food with us; Ben has his gun and may
have a chance to shoot some game on the way&mdash;more than likely,
he will have no chance at all; it will take us several days to
reach Stroudsburg, which, I believe, is the nearest point. Don't
you think it best that we should stop at the house and get what
food we can?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we do dat; come 'long; not great time."</p>

<p>There could be no safer guide than the Delaware, when his race
were such complete masters of the situation; though there was
risk that a patriot hiding somewhere in the neighborhood might
take a shot at him, under the belief that he meant harm to the
captives.</p>

<p>The humble log structure was found just as it was left that morning.
If any of the marauding bands of Indians paid it a visit, they
did not linger after seeing it was tenantless.</p>

<p>There was a whole loaf of bread and part of another left beside
some cooked chicken, and a number of live ones were scratching
the ground outside, as if they had no concern in what was going
on.</p>

<p>"The weather is warm now," remarked the prudent housewife, "but
a cold storm may set in before we reach shelter."</p>

<p>With which she folded a blanket from her bed and laid it over
her arm.</p>

<p>"It will come handy to sleep on," added Ben, who did the same
with a second, despite the weight of his rifle, which (as they
were made in those days) was a good load of itself for a strong
boy.</p>

<p>Omas showed some impatience, though his companions did not understand
the cause. His actions, indeed, were curious. They supposed he
meant to conduct them all or a greater part of the way to Stroudsburg,
though at times he appeared to be hesitating over it, or over
some other scheme he had in mind.</p>

<p>Ben Ripley had rambled among the rugged scenery, on the eastern
shore of the river, having gone with his father many times when
he was on hunting excursions; but he was not as familiar with
the ins and outs of the mountains as the Delaware, whose village
was a good many miles away.</p>

<p>None of the party had eaten anything of account since the early
morning meal, before they crossed the Susquehanna. The dangers,
excitement, and suspense of the hours drove away the thought of
food. Young as was Linna, she had already learned not to ask for
it when either of her parents chose not to offer it to her. Doubtless
she was hungry, but if so, no one else knew it. Alice had been
given bread when at Forty Fort, and she now suggested that some
more would not come amiss.</p>

<p>"We all need it," said Ben; "why not take our last meal in our
old home? You have no objection Omas?"</p>

<p>"Eat here," was his reply.</p>

<p>The guns were leaned against the walls, the blankets put aside
and all gathered round the board. The Delaware had done the same
before when visiting the family, and acquired the civilized form
of eating, while Linna picked it up during the brief time spent
with her friends.</p>

<p>The meal lasted but a few minutes, when they once more gathered
up their luggage, as it may be called, left the house, and with
Omas in the lead, struck into the mountains on the long tramp
to the Delaware.</p>

<p>The sun went down while they were picking their way through the
rough section. The Ripleys expected to do much hard travelling,
but their guide's knowledge of every turn enabled him to pick
out paths which none ever suspected. Sometimes the climbing was
abrupt, but all, even to Alice, were accustomed to that kind of
work, and they kept up a steady gait, which must have placed many
miles to the rear if continued long.</p>

<p>Omas continued at the head. Directly behind him walked his child,
the path most of the time being so narrow that they were obliged
to travel in Indian file. Then came Alice and her mother, while
Ben considered himself the rearguard. When the space allowed,
Alice took the hand of her parent, but Linna never presumed to
speak to or interfere with her grim, silent parent.</p>

<p>Darkness closed around them before they had gone a couple of
miles. During all this time the tramp continued in silence, probably
not a dozen words being spoken. Each of the three elder was using
eyes and ears to the utmost.</p>

<p>The sharp crack of a rifle broke the silence, not more than a
hundred yards to the right of them. Everyone started except Omas,
who acted as if he did not hear the report. He made no change
in his pace, and so far as the others could see in the gloom,
did not turn his head. They concluded, therefore, that no cause
for alarm existed.</p>

<p>Fairly through the mountain spur and among the deep woods, the
journey was pushed until the night was well along. Suddenly, Omas
made a short turn to the right and stopping in a hollow, where
there were several large boulders, he said&mdash;"We stay here all
night."</p>

<p>The words were a surprise, for it was expected he would travel
for a long time. He, Mrs. Ripley and Linna could have done so
without inconvenience, but Alice was tired out. Her relatives
were pretty well burdened already, though either would have carried
her had it been necessary; but the party had gained so good a
start that there seemed little risk in making a long stop.</p>

<p>Omas reached down one hand and laid it on the bare head of Alice,
saying in a voice of strange gentleness&mdash;"Little girl tired&mdash;she
can rest."</p>

<p>And then all knew he had ceased walking because of her. Had she
not been a member of the party, he would have kept the rest on
their feet until the sun appeared above the forest.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm tired, Omas," said the little one wearily, holding
the hand of the Delaware in both her own; "I'm glad you stopped."</p>

<p>The gloom was so deep, for there was no moon until very late
(and if there had been, its rays could not have pierced the dense
foliage), that they could hardly see each other's figures. Omas
hastily gathered some leaves and dead twigs, which were heaped
together against one of the boulders. Then he produced his flint
and steel&mdash;for he had learned the trick long before of the whites&mdash;and
by and by a shower of sparks was flying from the swift, sharp
blows of the metal against the hard stone. A minute later one
of the sparks "caught," and under his nursing a fire was speedily
under way.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged, Mrs. Ripley spread the blankets on
the ground and Alice stretched her tired little body upon one
of them.</p>

<p>"Mamma, I guess God will excuse me for not saying my prayers,"
she murmured, as she closed her eyes and sank into slumber.</p>

<p>Linna was tired, too, but she kept her feet and looked at her
father for his permission, before presuming to lie down.</p>

<p>"Come, Linna, here is your place beside Alice," said the mother
kindly.</p>

<p>Again she turned to her father, who was standing by the fire,
looking off in the gloom, as if he suspected something wrong.</p>

<p>He gave the permission in their native tongue and she cuddled
down beside her friend without further waiting.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Ben, "you had better lie down with them."</p>

<p>"Not yet," she replied, with a significant look at he Delaware,
whose back was toward them.</p>

<p>"What about him?" asked the surprised lad in a low voice.</p>

<p>"He is meditating something evil: he wants to leave us.</p>

<p>"What evil is there in that, if he thinks we have gone far enough
to be safe?"</p>

<p>"You have forgotten that he fought with the Iroquois today; he
wants to go back to Wyoming and join them in their work."</p>

<p>"If that is so, how can we hinder him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that we can; but I shall try it."</p>

<p>Ben busied himself gathering more wood, so that the fire cast
a glow several yards from where it burned against the boulder.</p>

<p>When he had collected enough to last a long while, he came back
and sat down by his mother. All this time the Delaware remained
motionless, with his face away from them. He was debating some
troublous question in his mind. They watched him closely.</p>

<p>He turned about abruptly, and said&mdash;"Omas must go&mdash;he say 'goodnight'
to his friends."</p>
