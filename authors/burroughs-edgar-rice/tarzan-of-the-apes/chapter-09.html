Tarzan of the Apes lived on in his wild, jungle existence
with little change for several years, only that he grew
stronger and wiser, and learned from his books more and
more of the strange worlds which lay somewhere outside his
primeval forest.
<P>
To him life was never monotonous or stale.  There was always
Pisah, the fish, to be caught in the many streams and the
little lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep
one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one
spent upon the ground.
<P>
Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them,
but though they never quite reached him with those cruel,
sharp claws of theirs, yet there were times when one could
scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his
smooth hide.
<P>
Quick was Sabor, the lioness, and quick were Numa and
Sheeta, but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning.
<P>
With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends.  How?  Ask not.
But this is known to the denizens of the jungle, that on
many moonlight nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the
elephant, walked together, and where the way was clear Tarzan
rode, perched high upon Tantor's mighty back.
<P>
Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his
father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of his parents
and the skeleton of Kala's baby.  At eighteen he read
fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and
varied volumes on the shelves.
<P>
Also could he write, with printed letters, rapidly and plainly,
but script he had not mastered, for though there were several
copy books among his treasure, there was so little written
English in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this
other form of writing, though he could read it, laboriously.
<P>
Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who
could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his
native language.  Never had he seen a human being other
than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was
watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of
the interior.
<P>
High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the
fourth.  It was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous
snakes.  Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet
invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its
frontier.
<P>
But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his
father delving into the mysteries of a new book, the ancient
security of his jungle was broken forever.
<P>
At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in
single file, over the brow of a low hill.
<P>
In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender
wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires, and long
bows and poisoned arrows.  On their backs were oval shields,
in their noses huge rings, while from the kinky wool of their
heads protruded tufts of gay feathers.
<P>
Across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of
color, and on each breast three concentric circles.  Their
yellow teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great
protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial
brutishness of their appearance.
<P>
Following them were several hundred women and children,
the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking
pots, household utensils and ivory.  In the rear were a
hundred warriors, similar in all respects to the advance guard.
<P>
That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than
whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was
evidenced by the formation of the column; and such was the
fact, for they were fleeing from the white man's soldiers who
had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had
turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white
officer and a small detachment of his black troops.
<P>
For many days they had gorged themselves on meat, but
eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon
their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades.
<P>
That night the black soldiers of the white man had had
meat a-plenty, and this little remnant of a once powerful
tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the
unknown, and freedom.
<P>
But that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness
to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to
many of the wild denizens of their new home.
<P>
For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through
the heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally,
early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the
banks of a small river, which seemed less thickly overgrown
than any ground they had yet encountered.
<P>
Here they set to work to build a new village, and in a
month a great clearing had been made, huts and palisades
erected, plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had
taken up their old life in their new home.  Here there were no
white men, no soldiers, nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered
for cruel and thankless taskmasters.
<P>
Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into
the territory surrounding their new village.  Several had
already fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so
infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats, and with lions
and leopards, the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves
far from the safety of their palisades.
<P>
But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga,
wandered far into the dense mazes to the west.  Warily he
stepped, his slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield
firmly grasped in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body.
<P>
At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield
many slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the thick, dark,
tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick.
<P>
Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father's
village, but still headed westward, and climbing into the fork
of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself
for sleep.
<P>
Three miles to the west slept the tribe of Kerchak.
<P>
Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving
through the jungle in search of food.  Tarzan, as was his
custom, prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so
that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by
the time he reached the beach.
<P>
The apes scattered by ones, and twos, and threes in all
directions, but ever within sound of a signal of alarm.
<P>
Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the
east, and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and
logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi, when the faintest
shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention.
<P>
For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down
this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a
strange and fearful creature.
<P>
It was Kulonga.
<P>
Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly back
along the trail.  She did not run; but, after the manner of her
kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to escape.
<P>
Close after her came Kulonga.  Here was meat.  He could
make a killing and feast well this day.  On he hurried, his
spear poised for the throw.
<P>
At a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again
upon another straight stretch.  His spear hand went far back
the muscles rolled, lightning-like, beneath the sleek hide.  Out
shot the arm, and the spear sped toward Kala.
<P>
A poor cast.  It but grazed her side.
<P>
With a cry of rage and pain the she-ape turned upon her
tormentor.  In an instant the trees were crashing beneath the
weight of her hurrying fellows, swinging rapidly toward the
scene of trouble in answer to Kala's scream.
<P>
As she charged, Kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an
arrow with almost unthinkable quickness.  Drawing the shaft
far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart
of the great anthropoid.
<P>
With a horrid scream Kala plunged forward upon her face
before the astonished members of her tribe.
<P>
Roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward Kulonga,
but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a
frightened antelope.
<P>
He knew something of the ferocity of these wild, hairy
men, and his one desire was to put as many miles between
himself and them as he possibly could.
<P>
They followed him, racing through the trees, for a long
distance, but finally one by one they abandoned the chase
and returned to the scene of the tragedy.
<P>
None of them had ever seen a man before, other than Tarzan,
and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of
creature it might be that had invaded their jungle.
<P>
On the far beach by the little cabin Tarzan heard the faint
echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was
seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the
direction of the sound.
<P>
When he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering
about the dead body of his slain mother.
<P>
Tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded.  He roared out
his hideous challenge time and again.  He beat upon his great
chest with his clenched fists, and then he fell upon the body
of Kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart.
<P>
To lose the only creature in all his world who ever had
manifested love and affection for him was the greatest
tragedy he had ever known.
<P>
What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape!  To Tarzan
she had been kind, she had been beautiful.
<P>
Upon her he had lavished, unknown to himself, all the
reverence and respect and love that a normal English boy
feels for his own mother.  He had never known another, and
so to Kala was given, though mutely, all that would have
belonged to the fair and lovely Lady Alice had she lived.
<P>
After the first outburst of grief Tarzan controlled himself,
and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed
the killing of Kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary
could convey.
<P>
It was enough, however, for his needs.  It told him of a
strange, hairless, black ape with feathers growing upon its
head, who launched death from a slender branch, and then ran,
with the fleetness of Bara, the deer, toward the rising sun.
<P>
Tarzan waited no longer, but leaping into the branches of the
trees sped rapidly through the forest.  He knew the windings
of the elephant trail along which Kala's murderer had
flown, and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept
the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous
detours of the trail.
<P>
At his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire, and
across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope.  In an
hour he struck the trail again, and coming to earth examined
the soil minutely.
<P>
In the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found
footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made,
but much larger than his.  His heart beat fast.  Could it be
that he was trailing a MAN--one of his own race?
<P>
There were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions.
So his quarry had already passed on his return along the
trail.  As he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of
earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to
the bottom of its shallow depression--ah, the trail was very
fresh, his prey must have but scarcely passed.
<P>
Tarzan swung himself to the trees once more, and with
swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail.
<P>
He had covered barely a mile when he came upon the
black warrior standing in a little open space.  In his hand
was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death
dealing arrows.
<P>
Opposite him across the little clearing stood Horta, the
boar, with lowered head and foam flecked tucks, ready to
charge.
<P>
Tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath
him--so like him in form and yet so different in face
and color.  His books had portrayed the NEGRO, but how
different had been the dull, dead print to this sleek thing of
ebony, pulsing with life.
<P>
As the man stood there with taut drawn bow Tarzan recognized him
not so much the NEGRO as the ARCHER of his picture book--
<P>
              A stands for Archer
<P>
<P>
How wonderful!  Tarzan almost betrayed his presence in
the deep excitement of his discovery.
<P>
But things were commencing to happen below him.  The sinewy
black arm had drawn the shaft far back; Horta, the
boar, was charging, and then the black released the little
poisoned arrow, and Tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of
thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar.
<P>
Scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere Kulonga had fitted
another to it, but Horta, the boar, was upon him so quickly
that he had no time to discharge it.  With a bound the black
leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with
incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in Horta's back.
<P>
Then Kulonga sprang into a near-by tree.
<P>
Horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more; a dozen steps
he took, then he staggered and fell upon his side.  For a
moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively, then
he lay still.
<P>
Kulonga came down from his tree.
<P>
With a knife that hung at his side he cut several large
pieces from the boar's body, and in the center of the trail he
built a fire, cooking and eating as much as he wanted.  The
rest he left where it had fallen.
<P>
Tarzan was an interested spectator.  His desire to kill
burned fiercely in his wild breast, but his desire to learn
was even greater.  He would follow this savage creature for a
while and know from whence he came.  He could kill him at
his leisure later, when the bow and deadly arrows were laid
aside.
<P>
When Kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond
a near turning of the path, Tarzan dropped quietly to
the ground.  With his knife he severed many strips of meat
from Horta's carcass, but he did not cook them.
<P>
He had seen fire, but only when Ara, the lightning, had
destroyed some great tree.  That any creature of the jungle
could produce the red-and-yellow fangs which devoured
wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised Tarzan greatly,
and why the black warrior had ruined his delicious repast by
plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him.
Possibly Ara was a friend with whom the Archer was sharing his food.
<P>
But, be that as it may, Tarzan would not ruin good meat in
any such foolish manner, so he gobbled down a great quantity
of the raw flesh, burying the balance of the carcass beside
the trail where he could find it upon his return.
<P>
And then Lord Greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon
his naked thighs and took up the trail of Kulonga, the son of
Mbonga, the king; while in far-off London another Lord
Greystoke, the younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's
father, sent back his chops to the club's CHEF because they
were underdone, and when he had finished his repast he
dipped his finger-ends into a silver bowl of scented water
and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask.
<P>
All day Tarzan followed Kulonga, hovering above him in
the trees like some malign spirit.  Twice more he saw him
hurl his arrows of destruction--once at Dango, the hyena,
and again at Manu, the monkey.  In each instance the animal
died almost instantly, for Kulonga's poison was very fresh
and very deadly.
<P>
Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying
as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his
quarry.  He knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could
not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle, who
were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner
as they fought with their jungle neighbors, yet as often
recovered as not.
<P>
No, there was something mysterious connected with these
tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere
scratch.  He must look into the matter.
<P>
That night Kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree
and far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes.
<P>
When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows
had disappeared.  The black warrior was furious and
frightened, but more frightened than furious.  He searched
the ground below the tree, and he searched the tree above the
ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of
the nocturnal marauder.
<P>
Kulonga was panic-stricken.  His spear he had hurled at
Kala and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and arrows
were gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife.
His only hope lay in reaching the village of Mbonga as
quickly as his legs would carry him.
<P>
That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took
the trail at a rapid trot.
<P>
From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards
away emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in his wake.
<P>
Kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the
top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been
removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch
half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up.
Thus Tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches.
<P>
As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed on him
until he traveled almost over the black's head.  His rope he
now held coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for
the kill.
<P>
The moment was delayed only because Tarzan was anxious to
ascertain the black warrior's destination, and presently he
was rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great
clearing, at one end of which lay many strange lairs.
<P>
Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery.
The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred
yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village.
<P>
Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but
Tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and
action when an emergency confronted him that there was not
even room for the shadow of a thought between.
<P>
So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the
jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from
the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of
the fields of Mbonga, and ere the king's son had taken a half
dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about
his neck.
<P>
So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that
Kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe.  Hand
over hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him
hanging by his neck in mid-air; then Tarzan climbed to a
larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into
the sheltering verdure of the tree.
<P>
Here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch, and
then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into Kulonga's
heart.  Kala was avenged.
<P>
Tarzan examined the black minutely, for he had never
seen any other human being.  The knife with its sheath and
belt caught his eye; he appropriated them.  A copper anklet
also took his fancy, and this he transferred to his own leg.
<P>
He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead
and breast.  He marveled at the sharp filed teeth.
He investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress,
and then he prepared to get down to business, for Tarzan
of the Apes was hungry, and here was meat; meat of the kill,
which jungle ethics permitted him to eat.
<P>
How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man
with the heart and head and body of an English gentleman,
and the training of a wild beast?
<P>
Tublat, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he
had killed in a fair fight, and yet never had the thought of
eating Tublat's flesh entered his head.  It could have been as
revolting to him as is cannibalism to us.
<P>
But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly
as Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer?  Was he not simply
another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed
upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger?
<P>
Suddenly, a strange doubt stayed his hand.  Had not his
books taught him that he was a man?  And was not The
Archer a man, also?
<P>
Did men eat men?  Alas, he did not know.  Why, then, this
hesitancy!  Once more he essayed the effort, but a qualm of
nausea overwhelmed him.  He did not understand.
<P>
All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this
black man, and thus hereditary instinct, ages old, usurped the
functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing
a worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant.
<P>
Quickly he lowered Kulonga's body to the ground, removed
the noose, and took to the trees again.
