<p>Jack Carleton was in the middle of a pleasant dream of home and
friends, when a light touch on his shoulder caused him to open
his eyes and look up with a quick, inquiring glance.</p>

<p>"Helloa! Deerfoot, is that you?" he exclaimed, springing to his
feet and grasping the hand of his old friend, on whose handsome
features lingered the shadowy smile which told of the pleasure
he felt in finding his beloved friend after such a long search.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is glad to take the hand of his brother and press it;
he has hunted a good while for him and his heart was sad that
he did not find him."</p>

<p>"How, in the name of conscience, did you ever find me at all?"
demanded Jack, who slapped him on his back, pinched his arm, and
treated him with a familiarity which few dared show toward him.</p>

<p>"I've had a very curious time, I can tell you, old fellow&mdash;helloa!
where did that gun come from, and that tomahawk?" exclaimed the
wondering youth, catching sight of the weapons.</p>

<p>"'Twill be well if my brother does not stay here," replied the
young Shawanoe, who, while he felt no particular fear of the Sauk
whom he had flung into the ravine, saw the possibility of his
procuring friends and coming back to revenge himself. Prudence
suggested that the two should secure themselves against such peril.
Deerfoot, therefore, picked up the tomahawk, shoved it into the
girdle around his waist, grasped the rifle in his right hand,
and strode forward with his free, easy, swinging gait. As there
was no call for special caution, he told the story of his encounter
with the young Sauk who had raised his tomahawk to brain his sleeping
friend. Deerfoot's first intention was to drive an arrow through
his body, but he chose the method already described of frustrating
his purpose.</p>

<p>To make his story complete, it was necessary for the young Shawanoe
to begin with his visit to Jack's mother, and to describe the
mental agony of the good parent over the unaccountable absence
of her boy. Then he told of his meeting with the Sauk warrior,
Hay-uta, who made such a determined effort to take his life. From
him he learned that a white youth was a captive in the village,
and he concluded, as a matter of course, that there were to be
found both Jack and Otto, though no reference was made to the
latter. The sagacious Shawanoe, however, discovered an important
fact or two which I did not refer to in telling the incident.
The first was that Hay-uta was one of the five Sauks who separated
from the other five directly after the capture of the boys. With
his company was Otto Relstaub, the Dutch youth, while Jack Carleton
was with the other. Hay-uta and his friends were on their way
to the village, and were almost within sight of it, when Hay-uta
felt such dissatisfaction over their failure to bring back any
scalps or plunder, that he drew off and declared he would not
go home until he secured some prize of that nature. His encounter
with Deerfoot followed. When he left the latter he went straight
to his village. Deerfoot could have trailed him without trouble,
but, inasmuch as the Sauk had departed in that manner, and the
Shawanoe knew where his village lay, he purposely avoided his
trail, and followed a course that diverged so far to the right
that he first reached the village passed by Jack in his canoe.
His arrival, as sometimes happens in this life, was in the very
nick of time. From the red men, who showed a friendly disposition
toward him, he learned that not only had a pale face youth passed
down the stream in a canoe, but a young warrior aflame with passion
was close behind him.</p>

<p>The wise Deerfoot was quick to grasp the situation, and he set
out hot-footed after the aforesaid flaming young warrior, and
followed him with such celerity that he came in sight of him long
before the Sauk arrived at the camp-fire. Little did the furious
young Sauk dream, while panting with anticipated revenge, and
aglow with exultation, that one of his own race was close upon
his heels, ready to launch his deadly arrow at any moment, and
only waiting to decide in what manner the Sauk should be "eliminated"
from the whole business.</p>

<p>Seated around the camp fire late that night, the two friends
talked over the past. Jack gave full particulars of what befell
him since his capture by the Indians, up to the hour when Deerfoot
joined him. The young Shawanoe listened with great interest to
the story, for it will be admitted that in many respects it was
an extraordinary narrative. He told Jack that the people with
whom he had passed more than a week were Sauks, under the leadership
of the chieftain whose lodge had sheltered the prisoner during
his captivity. The Sauks were a brave, warlike people, and this
offshoot, which had located in that portion of Upper Louisiana,
was among the most daring and vindictive of the tribe. Their leniency
toward Jack was remarkable, and could only be accounted for on
the supposition that Ogallah took a fancy to the youth and meant
to adopt him into his family. It was not at all unlikely that
Jack's suspicion that they were "training" him to figure in a
scene of torture was correct. His escape, therefore, could not
have been more opportune.</p>

<p>Let not the reader accuse the two of indifference, because so
little has been recorded in their conversation, concerning Otto
Relstaub, the companion of both in more than one scene of peril,
and held by them in strongest friendship. They had talked more
of him than of any one else, though Jack's heart was oppressed
by a great sorrow when he thought of his mother and her grief
over his continued absence. Jack had asked Deerfoot over and over
again as to his belief concerning their absent friend, but the
Shawanoe, for a long time, evaded a direct answer.</p>

<p>"I can tell you what <em>I</em> think," said Jack with a compression
of his lips and a shake of his head: "Otto is dead."</p>

<p>"How did my brother meet his death?" calmly asked Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"Those five warriors started by another route to the village
and they meant to take him there as they took me. After Hay-uta,
as I believe you call your friend, left, they made up their minds
that it wasn't of any use to bother with poor Otto, and so they
tomahawked or shot him."</p>

<p>Having given his theory, Jack Carleton turned toward the young
Shawanoe for his comment, but he sat looking intently in the fire
and remained silent. Resolved that he should say something on
the painful subject, Jack touched his arm.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, do you think I am right?"</p>

<p>The Indian looked in his face and still mute, nodded his head
to signify he agreed with him.</p>

<p>"Poor Otto," added Jack with a sigh, "I wonder how his father
and mother will feel when they learn that their boy will never
come back."</p>

<p>"They will mourn because the horse was not found," was the characteristic
remark of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"You are right," exclaimed Jack, with a flash of the eye; "if
old Jacob Relstaub could get his horse, I believe he and his wife
would go on and smoke their pipes with as much piggish enjoyment
as before, caring nothing for their only child. How different
my mother!" he added in a softer voice: "she would give her life
to save mine, as I would give mine to keep trouble from her. I
say, Deerfoot, Otto and I were a couple of fools to start out
to hunt a horse that had been lost so many days before and of
which we hadn't the slightest trace&mdash;don't you think so?"</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe once more turned and looked in his face with
a mournful expression, and nodded his head with more emphasis
than before.</p>

<p>"I knew you would agree with me," assented Jack, "though, to
tell the truth, I had very little hope myself that we would ever
get sight of the animal, but old Jacob Relstaub really drove Otto
out of his house and compelled him to go off on the wild goose
hunt. I couldn't let him go alone and, with mother's consent,
I kept him company."</p>

<p>"My brother pleased the Great Spirit, and Deerfoot will pray
that he shall ever act so that the Great Spirit will smile on
him."</p>

<p>"I shall most certainly try to do so," said Jack with a resolute
shake of his head: "He has shown me a hundred-fold more mercies
than I deserve and I mean to prove that I have some gratitude
in me."</p>

<p>The conversation went on in this fashion until the evening was
far along, when Jack lay down near the fire, intending to sleep
for the rest of the night. Deerfoot assured him there was no danger
and as was his custom, the young Shawanoe brought forth his Bible
to spend an hour or so in studying its pages. Before he had fixed
upon the portion, Jack Carleton came to the sitting position and,
with some excitement in his manner, said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, I forgot to tell you something: I don't know how it
came to slip my mind."</p>

<p>The Indian looked in his face and quietly awaited his explanation.</p>

<p>"One of those Sauks that belonged to Otto's party came into the
lodge of Ogallah when I was there, and I think he tried to tell
me something about Otto, but I couldn't understand his words or
gestures."</p>

<p>"Let my brother show Deerfoot what the movements were," said
the other, manifesting much interest.</p>

<p>They were so impressed on Jack Carleton that, springing to his
feet, he placed himself in front of Deerfoot and reproduced most
of the gestures, the words, of course, being gone. The Shawanoe
fixed his eyes on his friend, and scrutinized every motion with
eager eyes. Suddenly he sprang up with more feeling than he had
shown in a long time. And well might he do so, for he had translated
the sign language, as given to him by Jack Carleton, and it told
a far different story than the one which both had adopted some
time before.</p>

<p>"Otto is alive," was the startling declaration of Deerfoot.</p>

<p>"He is!" exclaimed the amazed Jack, "I should like to know who
told you that."</p>

<p>"That was what the Sauk warrior said to my brother; that was
what he tried to tell him, but my brother did not understand his
words."</p>

<p>"Are you really sure Otto is alive?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot cannot be sure of that which his eyes do not behold;
but such were the words of Hay-uta the Sauk; they did not kill
Otto."</p>

<p>"Then where <em>is</em> he?"</p>

<p>"He is a long ways off; we will hasten to the settlement that
the heart of the mother of my brother shall be lightened. Then
Deerfoot will lead his brother on the hunt for him who is so many
miles away toward the setting sun."</p>

<p>Within the following three days, Jack Carleton arrived home and
was clasped in the arms of his mother, who rejoiced over his return
as though it had been a very rising from the dead. Deerfoot had
conducted him swiftly through the forest and not a hair of the
head of either was harmed.</p>

<p>The limits of this work having been reached, it will be impossible
in these pages to give an account of what befell Otto Relstaub,
after his capture by the little band of Sauk Indians; but all
that, as well as the eventful hunt for him by Deerfoot the Shawanoe
and young Jack Carleton, shall be fully told in "Footprints in
the Forest," which will form <em>Number Three of the Log Cabin
Series</em>.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
