<p>"Well, what next?" inquired Brent blankly.
</p>
<p>"We might manage to seize and make a hostage of Lute Brown--and even
the telegraph operator," began Halloway, somewhat haltingly.  "But
their disappearance would prove a sort of warning and they may not be
the leading spirits.  Did you gather from that telegram where they mean
to hold her up?"
</p><p>"No--nor even to whom the message went.  He'd begun sending when I got
in."
</p><p>"Of course we couldn't prove that the operator understood the portent
of the message but I know the fellow--his name is Wicks, and I think
he's a bad egg."
</p><p>"Where does the bank cashier live?" inquired Brent.
</p><p>"Three miles out along Deephole Branch--and he has no telephone,"
growled the Titan.  Suddenly through the baffled perplexity of his eyes
broke the light of dawning idea, and he spoke with a greater certitude.
</p><p>"If these high-binders have used the wire once they may do it again,"
he exclaimed.  "At all events that's the point to watch at present."
</p><p>"I suppose you mean I must loaf around there and eavesdrop--for
anything that may come over."  Brent's tone was unenthusiastic.  "It's
logical enough too--but if the girl's started out alone, time is
precious."
</p><p>Halloway had straightened out of his doleful uncertainty.  Plans were
swiftly taking shape in his mind.
</p><p>"No.  You've been there once.  If you went back it's just possible that
into the fellow's dull mind might steal a ghost of suspicion.  I'm
ready to take my turn now, though I hate the damned inactivity.  I am a
presumed illiterate.  I struggle over the printed page--and with me
loafing in his office he would chat away over his wire undisturbed."
</p><p>"And what shall I be doing?"
</p><p>"There'll be enough to keep you busy, I should say.  Get in touch with
any of the bank employes you can locate.  Try to learn whether or not
Alexander has actually started.  Have Lute watched and see with whom he
talks.  Get together a dozen men we can trust at a pinch.  Have them
ready, if necessary, to take the saddle on a moment's notice.  It may
come down to a race over the trail."
</p><p>Brent's face fell.
</p><p>"With my limited acquaintance," he objected, "how in God's name am I to
pick such men?"
</p><p>"No man who looked into the dog-like eyes of young Bud Sellers,"
asserted Halloway, "could doubt that he'd give his life for that girl.
He can also keep his mouth tight.  Tell him the whole story and take
his orders.  I'm off now to sit on my shoulder blades in the telegraph
office."
</p><p>About the post office loitered a small crowd drawn together by the
instinct for companionship and to that gathering place Brent turned
first in search of Bud.
</p><p>It proved a happy choice and when he had, with a seeming of casualness,
led his man into a quieter spot he demanded, "What has become of
Alexander?"
</p><p>He thought that the young mountaineer stiffened a bit and that his face
became mask-like.  But this may have been the jealous tendency of a
hopeless passion, and when Brent swiftly narrated all that he and
Halloway had learned, the secretiveness of guise fell away from the
listening face and the body trembled as if stricken with a chill, but a
chill of rage and indignation which had no kinship with timorousness.
</p><p>"Hit looks like hit would hev been safer an' handier fer Alexander jest
ter ride on back home with ther same crowd thet come down-river with
her--they're all got ter make ther same journey," was his first
comment, but after a moment he shook his head.  "Howsomever, I reckon
thet they don't aim ter hasten back so damn fast.  They hain't been in
a town fer a long spell an' they seeks ter tarry--an' quite several of
'em air fellers I mistrusts anyhow."
</p><p>"Can't you pick out enough dependable men for an immediate start if
need be?"
</p><p>Bud laughed shortly.  "Did ye 'low, atter hearin' what ye jest narrated
that I'd be liable ter stand hitched fer long?  I'll pick 'em out all
right--an' speedily."
</p><p>Into his suddenly narrowing eye shot a menacing gleam.  "An' ef them
fellers undertakes ter harm her, afore God, thar's goin' ter be some
shovelin' of grave-yard dirt, too."
</p><p>Brent sought out the bank president who lived in town and put his terse
question as to whether Alexander had withdrawn from the safe, her
package of money.
</p><p>"She hadn't been there again up to the time of my leaving," the banker
replied, "but, I came away before closing."
</p><p>The telegraph office in the railway station was a dingy place of
cobwebbed murk.  It was also the express office, and in helter-skelter
disarray lay a litter of uncalled-for plow-shares and such articles as
go from the end of the rails into that hinterland where lies an
isolated world of crag and loneliness.
</p><p>Except for the operator--who was also ticket-agent and general
factotum--it was now empty and dull of light with its smeared window
glasses between its interior and the dispirited grayness of the outer
skies.  The dust-covered papers and miscellany which cumbered the table
long undisturbed, spoke of an idle office and of hours unedged with
interest.
</p><p>As Halloway's great bulk shadowed the door, Wicks glanced up, and
nodded with a somewhat surly unwelcome.
</p><p>"Did ye want anything," he asked shortly.
</p><p>"No, just loafin' 'round," drawled the visitor as he settled indolently
into a chair which creaked its complaint under his weight.
</p><p>For a short while the two kept up a perfunctory semblance of
conversation, but between these interchanges of comment, lengthening
intervals elapsed.
</p><p>Wicks sat inertly gazing at those familiar stains on the wall which
long familiarity had made hateful to him.  His expression was moody and
only occasionally did he turn to glance at his unbidden guest.
</p><p>Halloway's head had fallen forward on his chest and soon his heavy
breathing became that of a man who is napping.
</p><p>Finally the other opened his key and sounded the call for Viper, a
hamlet ten miles away, though in practical effect it was more distant
since the road between twisted painfully over ridge and through gorge.
It was on an infrequently used freight spur but it boasted
communication with the world by wire--and it was important now because
it was a town through which Alexander must pass on her way from Coal
City to the mouth of Shoulder-blade Creek.
</p><p>The metallic voice of the telegraph key subsided, and shortly came the
response.  Halloway still breathed heavily on--a sleeping giant whose
ears were very much awake.  This was no official message paying toll,
but a private conversation between operators bent on whiling away dull
moments.  Moreover it was evidently the continuation of talk previously
commenced so that to the eavesdropper it was like a continued story of
which he had missed the opening chapters.
</p><p>"Upward of four thousand dollars," tapped out Wicks.  "That's big
money, but the more men that split it the less each feller gets, so
they don't want too many from Viper."
</p><p>Halloway realized at once that this lantern-jawed operator had a swift
and sure sending finger, and when the answer came it was, in contrast,
labored and ragged.  It was as if two men talked, one in rapid and
clear-clipped syllables--the other in a stutter.
</p><p>Said Viper, "There might be neck-stretching too if too many tongues
make talk.  Jess will have the boys ready at the place soon in the
morning.  They will wait for orders there."
</p><p>"At the place!"  Halloway in his counterfeited sleep cursed to himself.
If instead of those indefinite words the point had been named he would
have gained something tangible.  He knew now however beyond a doubt
that both operators were conspirators and he had gleaned one comforting
assurance--the plans contemplated no joining of forces until to-morrow.
Those at the far end were still uninstructed.  If it came to a race
to-night that gave a better chance.
</p><p>Then Viper cut off and Wicks, with a sigh of boredom, settled back in
his chair once more and gave himself over to silence.
</p><p>Finally Halloway stirred out of his slumber and stretched himself.
</p><p>"I reckon," he admitted shamefacedly, "I must hev fell asleep.  That
damn fire broke up my rest last night."  With which comment he
slouched, still sleepily, out of the place, rubbing his eyes as he
went, with ham-like fists.
</p><p>At the rafts he found Bud Sellers, and a round dozen men of Bud's
selection.  Looking them over, Halloway privately approved.  There was
not an eye in the number that was not hawk-clear; or a figure that was
not nail-hard.  These were fellows cut to a pattern of action, but even
in their excellent average, one stood out with an individualism which
immediately struck the observer.
</p><p>He was introduced as Jerry O'Keefe, but Halloway would not have needed
the name, once he had seen the lazy challenging twinkle in the
gray-blue eyes, to spot him as a man of Irish blood.  O'Keefe had need
to look up to meet the glance of the giant, but that was for him
unusual.  Into most eyes he looked down, for when he stood in his socks
he was six feet two inches of hard-bitten sinew and man-flesh.
</p><p>"Where's Brent?" asked Halloway, and Bud Sellers, whose manner had
fallen into the stillness of one chafing against delay, replied
tersely, "He hain't come back yit."
</p><p>Soon, though, he arrived, and by now the west was reddening toward
sunset.
</p><p>In a situation calling for absolute parsimony in the economy of time it
would have meant moments salvaged for the trio of men, who must act as
commanders of the rest, to have gone at once into a discussion of the
results of their several investigations.  Yet that was impossible,
since for Halloway to tell his story to both would mean revealing his
knowledge of telegraphy.  So while he and Brent talked first alone, Bud
Sellers stood apart, and into that fertile soil of mountain suspicion
crept a vague questioning as to why full confidence was denied him--a
suspicion which was later to bear fruit.
</p><p>When he had been told all, save of Halloway's eavesdropping, he made
his own report.
</p><p>"Myself, I hain't found out much, save thet I've got ther men ready,
an' thet I seed Lute Brown talkin' with Jase Mallows a spell back."
</p><p>It was arranged that half of the force should proceed at top speed to
Crabapple post office and mobilize there; that Halloway himself should
push through to Viper and eavesdrop on the telegraph key, and that the
others should loaf about Coal City watching the suspects and gleaning
what information they could.  The men of the last named contingent were
to play hounds on the heels of the plotters and seek to follow them
without being discovered.
</p><p>While the three were still in council at one end of the raft, Bud came
suddenly to his feet and his jaw dropped in amazement.  There striding
down the bank to the boom, with a face as freshly pink as a wild rose,
was Alexander herself, with her pack on her back.
</p><p>She saw the gathering of men, some with faces that were unfamiliar to
her, and halted to inspect them.  Into her eyes came something like a
smoulder as though in resentment of unwarranted trespassing, then
seeing Bud and Halloway and Brent she came aboard and demanded curtly,
"What be all these men doin' hyar?"
</p><p>For an instant no one responded to her question.  The reaction of
unexpected relief from driving anxiety left them wordless.  Finally
Brent laughed nervously.
</p><p>"It would appear that they are here for no reason whatsoever," he said,
"though a few minutes ago we thought it a matter of life and death."
Her nonplussed expression was sufficiently full of interrogation to cue
a fuller explanation and Brent embarked upon the summarized recital of
what they had discovered.
</p><p>Alexander's eyes widened into amazement, and she caught one lip between
her white teeth.  She stood very straight and indignant, and the men
acknowledged to themselves that she had never seemed so beautiful
before, nor so militant.
</p><p>"So they aimed ter lay-way me," she murmured incredulously and Halloway
made prompt answer.  "Yes, and ye mighty nigh walked right into th'ar
dead-fall.  Don't ye see now how plum reckless yore plan is?  Whar was
ye at anyhow?"
</p><p>The girl impatiently tossed her head.  "I fared out a leetle way ter
see how ther roads looked," she said.  "I wanted ter mek sure that I
could get a daybreak start in the morning.  I hain't nobody's sugar ner
salt that I kain't stir abroad without meltin', be I?"
</p><p>"We saw that your pack was gone too--and we 'lowed----" began Halloway,
but she interrupted him with a curt explanation.  "Thet shack war
leakin' like a sieve.  I didn't aim ter hev all my belongin's mildewed
an' rusted--so I left 'em at ther store."
</p><p>"This crowd kin see ye through without mishap, I reckon.  We've done
planned hit all out."  That contribution came from the giant who seemed
to have become general spokesman but the young woman stood silent and
absorbed; a delicate pucker between her brows, and the violet pools of
her eyes cloud-riffled.  At last she announced firmly, "I'm beholden
ter all of ye but I've got ter study this matter out by myself.  I'll
come back hyar in a little spell an' tell ye what decision I've done
reached."
</p><p>"As for getting a daybreak start," Brent observed as she turned away,
"You can't get into the bank until it opens."
</p><p>Once more she had overlooked the unfamiliar complications of financial
usage.
</p><p>Jerry O'Keefe had been lounging with the other recruits of Bud's
gathering, looking river-ward until the sound of voices, whose words he
could not distinguish, brought him lazily around.  As he stood when the
first view of Alexander broke on his vision, so he remained--immovable.
The low and bantering laughter of his companions for his rapt
statuesqueness, fell on deaf ears.  His lips parted and his eyes held
as under hypnotism.
</p><p>Jerry stared with a craned neck at Alexander McGivins until slowly his
body came round to an easier posture, but upon his steady and unmoving
fixity of eye, the rest of him moved as upon an axis.  Into the
gray-blue irises came a live kindling and with seeming unconsciousness
of those about him, he said solemnly, "Afore God, I aims ter wed with
thet gal!"
</p>
<p>Alexander had strolled outward along a bluff, leaving the town at her
back, because she wanted to think without interruption.  In her home
over yonder across the broken ridges her father might be lying, anxiety
ridden--or he might be already dead.  An obsession of haste spurred her
with the roweling of suspense and with the companionship of her
troubled thoughts she walked on and on.
</p><p>When at length she turned she had decided certain matters, and in the
growing dusk she met a man who smilingly accosted her and halted in her
path.  It was Jase Mallows and she confronted him with a high head and,
in remembrance of his swaggering impertinence, spoke imperiously.
</p><p>"I don't want ter hev no speech with ye, Jase, now ner never, but I
owes ye wages fer ther wuck ye done on them rafts.  Come ter ther bank
termorrer at openin' time and I'll pay ye off."
</p><p>The mountaineer's face fell into a scowl of resentment.  To be rebuffed
was galling enough.  To be relegated to a servile status was
unendurable, yet he refashioned his expression at once into a smile.
</p><p>"Thar hain't no tormentin' haste, Alexander," he assured her evenly.
"Any time'll do--any time at all, but I'm leavin' town ternight."
</p><p>"Suit yerself," she answered with calculated curtness and would have
gone on but he fell into step with her and dropped his voice into so
earnest a <u>timbre</u> that despite her dislike for him she listened.
</p><p>"Alexander--hit hain't none of my business--an' I knows ye're mad at me
but yore paw an' me dwells neighbors--an' I'm goin' ter forewarn ye
about somethin'."
</p><p>"Alright," the voice was frigid.  "Go ahead.  Everybody's forewarnin'
me right now."
</p><p>"I've done heered thet this Brent party air a mighty slick customer.
Don't give him no undue lee-way ter fleece ye.  Ther man Halloway,
thet's hangin' around him's a pretty desperate sort too, by ther repute
folks gives him.  When ye settled up accounts with thet outfit, ye
kain't skeercely be too heedful.  I'd either make 'em give me cash
money--or else hev a lawyer 'round ter see thet everythin's alright."
</p><p>"My paw," declared the girl indignantly, "he's got full trust in Mr.
Brent an' so hev I."  She dismissed him with a glance under which his
own bravado wilted and he made no further effort to walk at her side.
But in the gathering dusk, the wet desolation about her seemed to creep
into Alexander's heart.  With so many charges of foul play floating
about, of whom could she feel certain?  Then the answer came.  There
was, perhaps, only one.  So long as he remained sober, Bud Sellers
would remain dependable.  From the bank overlooking the boom she called
his name and when he had leaped to respond, she led him out of hearing.
</p><p>"Bud," she said tensely.  "Ye knows how heavy-hearted with dread I be
about my paw.  Ye knows thet when I left him I wasn't no ways sure I'd
ever lay eyes on his livin' face ergin.  I ain't sure now."  Her voice
threatened to break and to control it she pitched it into a harder
tone.  "Ye knows, too, who's fault thet air."
</p><p>He answered very low and very miserably.  "Yes, I knows full well--an'
I've done been in torment--ever since."
</p><p>"Ef he's still alive an' gits well----" she went on, "thar won't be no
grudge atween us.  Ye says ye seeks ter make amends.  Ye knows what hit
means ter him whether I gits thet money back safe or not."
</p><p>"Yes, I knows thet too."
</p><p>Alexander laughed a little bitterly.  "I've jest been forewarned thet I
kain't trust nuther Brent ner Halloway.  I hain't sayin' I believes
hit; I reckon hit's sheer slander--but----"  All unconsciously a note
of pathos crept into her voice, the pathos of one who must fight alone
against unseen forces.  "But, how am I goin' ter tell, fer dead sure,
who I kin trust?"
</p><p>Sellers remembered that all he knew of the robbery plot was
hearsay--that his informants had excluded him from a part of their
consultations.  An ugly possibility took vague shape in his mind, but
his answer was brief.
</p><p>"Ye kin trust me 'twell hell freezes."
</p><p>Alexander nodded.  "Ye're ther one man I ought ter hev a blood-hatred
erginst--an' yit, so long es ye stays sober, I knows what ye says air
true."
</p><p>Suddenly she laid both her hands on his shoulders and under her touch a
tremor raced through his arteries.  The mountains seemed to grow
unsteady.  "Ye're ther only man hyar I kin plum, teetotally depend on.
When the bank opens termorrer, I wants ye ter be thar.  I don't want ye
ter go with me on ther trip back home.  I hain't goin' ter suffer
nobody ter do that--but thar's a thing I may need ye ter do."
</p><p>"Es God's lookin' down on us, ef a man kin do hit----" he swore in an
emotion-shaken voice, "hit'll be done."
</p><p>Later that evening Alexander announced her decision and from it she
refused to depart.  As soon as she could transact business at the bank
the next day she would set out on a hired mule, with the money in her
saddle-bags.  She would tolerate no escort, because one person could
travel secretly where several could not.  However when she had
progressed a certain distance she would turn the mule back.  The only
reason for its use, at all, would be to make it appear that she was
going by the route which the robbers assumed.
</p><p>Then, depending upon a woodcraft which she trusted, she would swing out
at a circle on foot, holding to the laurel thickets and pass, not
through but around and above the Gap, which seemed the logical place
for a holdup.  She consented that her assembled body-guard should, if
they insisted, push on and mobilize at Viper, where if suspicious
circumstances warranted, they might be near enough to take emergency
action.  If she came through safely to Perry Center, she would be
secure in the house of a kinsman and from there on would have little to
fear.
</p><p>At ten o'clock the next morning Alexander came out of the bank,
followed by Bud Sellers, who carried his own saddle-bags over his arm,
as if he too contemplated a journey.  Brent, in order to avoid the
appearance of too close a participation in her affairs, did not
accompany her--nor was Halloway anywhere in evidence.
</p><p>As the girl went out to where her hired mule stood hitched, various
observers along the ragged street noted that her rifle was strapped
under the saddle skirt in such a way that it could not be speedily
loosened.  They also watched as, with no pretense of concealment, she
stuffed into her saddle-hags a parcel done up in heavy brown paper, and
made conspicuous by the bank's red sealing wax.  Then, still scornful
of evasion, she mounted and rode away as straight-shouldered and
militant a figure as Jeanne d'Arc herself.
</p><p>Bud Sellers, looking after her from the door of the bank, was gloomy of
countenance beyond his wont.
