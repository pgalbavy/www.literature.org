DR SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>
     11 October,  Evening.--Jonathan  Harker has asked me to
note this, as he says he is hardly equal to the task, and he
wants an exact record kept.
<P>
     I  think  that  none of  us were surprised when we were
asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset.
We have of late come to  understand that  sunrise and sunset
are to her times of peculiar freedom.  When her old self can
be  manifest  without  any controlling force subduing or restraining  her,  or  inciting  her to  action.  This mood or
condition begins  some  half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and  lasts  till  either the sun is high, or
whilst  the  clouds are  still aglow with the rays streaming
above  the  horizon.  At first there  is a  sort of negative
condition, as  if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom  quickly follows.  When,  however, the  freedom
ceases the change back or  relapse  comes quickly, preceeded
only by a spell of warning silence.
<P>
     Tonight, when we met, she was somewhat constrained, and
bore all the signs of an internal struggle.  I put  it  down
myself  to  her  making  a  violent  effort at  the earliest
instant she could do so.
<P>
     A very few minutes,  however, gave her complete control
of herself.  Then,  motioning  her husband to sit beside her
on the sofa where she was  half reclining, she made the rest
of us bring chairs up close.
<P>
     Taking her husband's  hand in hers, she began,  "We are
all here together in  freedom, for perhaps the last time!  I
know that you will always be with me to the end."   This was
to her husband  whose  hand had,  as we could see, tightened
upon her.  "In the  morning we go out upon our task, and God
alone  knows  what may be in store  for  any of us.  You are
going to be so good to me to take me with you.  I know  that
all that brave earnest men can  do  for  a  poor weak woman,
whose soul perhaps is lost, no, no, not yet, but is  at  any
rate at stake, you will do.  But you must remember that I am
not as you are.  There is a poison in my blood, in my  soul,
which may destroy me, which must destroy me, unless some relief comes to us.  Oh, my friends, you know as well as I do,
that my soul is at stake. And though I know there is one way
out for me, you must not and I must not take it!" She looked
appealingly to us all in turn, beginning and ending with her
husband.
<P>
     "What is that way?" asked Van Helsing in a hoarse voice.
"What is that way, which we must not, may not, take?"
<P>
     "That I may die now, either by my own hand  or  that of
another, before the greater evil is entirely wrought.  I know,
and you know, that were I once dead you could and  would set
free my immortal spirit, even as you did my poor Lucy's.  Were
death, or the fear of death, the only thing that stood in the
way I would not shrink to die here now,  amidst the  friends
who love me.  But death is not all. I cannot believe that to
die in such a case, when there is hope before us and a bitter
task to be done, is God's will.  Therefore, I on my part, give
up here the certainty of  eternal  rest, and go out into the
dark where may be the blackest things  that the world or the
nether world holds!"
<P>
     We were all silent, for we knew instinctively that this
was only a prelude.  The faces  of  the others were set, and
Harker's grew ashen grey.  Perhaps, he  guessed  better than
any of us what was coming.
<P>
     She continued, "This is what I can give into the hotchpot."  I could not but note the  quaint legal  phrase  which
she used in such a place,  and with  all seriousness.  "What
will  each  of  you  give?  Your lives I know,"  she went on
quickly, "that is easy for brave men.  Your lives are God's,
and you can give them back to Him, but what will you give to
me?"  She looked again questionly, but this time avoided her
husband's face.  Quincey seemed to understand, he nodded, and
her face lit up. "Then I shall tell you plainly what I want,
for there must be no doubtful matter  in this connection between us now.  You must promise me, one and all, even you, my
beloved husband, that should the time come, you will kill me."
<P>
     "What  is  that time?"  The voice was Quincey's, but it
was low and strained.
<P>
     "When you shall  be convinced that I am so changed that
it is better  that  I  die  that I may live.  When I am thus
dead in the flesh, then you will,  without a moment's delay,
drive a stake  through me  and  cut off my head, or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest!"
<P>
     Quincey was the first to rise after the pause. He knelt
down  before her and  taking  her hand in his said solemnly,
"I'm only a rough fellow, who hasn't, perhaps,  lived  as  a
man should to win such a distinction, but I  swear to you by
all that I hold sacred and dear that, should the  time  ever
come, I shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us.
And I promise you, too, that  I  shall make all certain, for
if I am only doubtful I shall take it that the time has come!"
<P>
     "My true friend!"  was all she could say amid her fastfalling tears, as bending over, she kissed his hand.
<P>
     "I swear the same, my dear Madam Mina!"said Van Helsing.
"And I!" said Lord Godalming, each of them in turn  kneeling
to her to take the oath.  I followed, myself.
<P>
     Then her  husband  turned  to  her  wan-eyed and with a
greenish pallor which  subdued the  snowy whiteness  of  his
hair, and asked,  "And must I, too, make such a promise, oh,
my wife?"
<P>
     "You too, my  dearest,"she said, with infinite yearning
of pity in her voice  and  eyes.  "You must not shrink.  You
are nearest and dearest and  all the world to me.  Our souls
are knit into one, for all life and  all time.  Think, dear,
that there have been times when brave men have  killed their
wives and their womenkind, to keep  them from  falling  into
the hands of the enemy.  Their hands  did not falter any the
more because  those  that  they loved implored them  to slay
them.  It is men's duty towards  those whom  they  love,  in
such times of sore trial!  And oh,  my dear, if  it is to be
that I must meet death at any hand, let it be at the hand of
him that loves me best.  Dr. Van Helsing, I have not forgotten your mercy in poor Lucy's case to  him who loved."   She
stopped with a flying blush, and changed her phrase, "to him
who had best  right to give  her  peace.  If that time shall
come again, I look  to you to make  it  a happy memory of my
husband's life that it was his loving hand which set me free
from the awful thrall upon me."
<P>
     "Again I swear!" came the Professor's resonant voice.
<P>
     Mrs. Harker smiled, positively smiled, as with a sigh of
relief she leaned back and said,  "And now one word of warning, a warning which you must never forget.  This time, if it
ever come,  may  come quickly  and unexpectedly, and in such
case you must lose no time in using your opportunity.  At such
a time I myself might be . . . nay!  If the time  ever come,
shall be, leagued with your enemy against you.
<P>
     "One more request,"  she became very solemn as she said
this, "it is  not  vital and necessary like the other, but I
want you to do one thing for me, if you will."
<P>
     We all acquiesced, but no one spoke.  There was no need
to speak.
<P>
     "I want you to read the Burial Service." She was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband.  Taking his hand in
hers, she held it over her heart, and continued.  "You  must
read it over me some day.  Whatever may be  the issue of all
this fearful state of things, it will be  a sweet thought to
all or some of us. You, my dearest, will I hope read it, for
then it  will  be  in  your voice in my memory forever, come
what may!"
<P>
     "But  oh,  my dear one," he pleaded, "death is afar off
from you."
<P>
     "Nay,"  she  said,  holding  up  a warning hand.  "I am
deeper  in death at  this  moment than  if  the weight of an
earthly grave lay heavy upon me!"
<P>
     "Oh, my wife, must I read it?"he said, before he began.
<P>
     "It would comfort me, my husband!"  was  all  she said,
and he began to read when she had got the book ready.
<P>
     How can I, how could anyone, tell of that strange scene,
its solemnity, its gloom,its sadness, its horror, and withal,
its sweetness.  Even  a  sceptic, who  can see nothing but a
travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional, would
have been melted to the heart had he seen that  little group
of loving and devoted  friends kneeling  round that stricken
and sorrowing lady.  Or heard the tender passion of her husband's voice, as in tones so broken and emotional that often
he  had  to  pause, he read the simple and beautiful service
from the Burial  of  the  Dead.   I  cannot  go  on  .  .  .
words  .  .  .  and v-voices  .  .  .  f-fail m-me!
<P>
     She  was  right  in  her  instinct.  Strange as it was,
bizarre as  it may  hereafter seem  even to  us who felt its
potent influence at the time, it comforted us much.  And the
silence, which showed Mrs. Harker's  coming relapse from her
freedom  of soul, did not seem so full of despair to any  of
us as we had dreaded.
<P>

<P>
       JONATHAN HARKER'S JOURNAL
<P>

<P>
     15 October,  Varna.--We left Charing Cross on the morning of the  12th, got to Paris  the same night, and took the
places secured for  us in the  Orient  Express.  We traveled
night  and  day,  arriving here at about five o'clock.  Lord
Godalming went to  the  Consulate to see if any telegram had
arrived for him, whilst the rest of us came on to this hotel,
"the Odessus."  The journey may have had  incidents. I  was,
however, too eager to get on, to  care for them.  Until  the
Czarina Catherine comes into port there will be no  interest
for me in anything in the wide  world.  Thank God!  Mina  is
well, and looks to be getting stronger.  Her color is coming
back.  She sleeps a great deal.  Throughout the  journey she
slept nearly all the time.  Before sunrise and sunset,  however, she is very wakeful and alert.  And it  has  become  a
habit for Van Helsing to hypnotize her  at  such  times.  At
first, some effort was needed, and he had to make many passes.
But now, she seems to yield at once, as  if  by  habit,  and
scarcely any action is  needed.  He  seems to have  power at
these particular moments to simply will,  and  her  thoughts
obey him.  He always asks her what she can see and hear.
<P>
     She answers to the first,  "Nothing, all is dark."
<P>
     And to the second,"I can hear the waves lapping against
the ship, and the water rushing by.  Canvas and cordage strain
and masts and yards creak.  The wind is high  .  .  .  I can
hear it in the shrouds, and the bow throws back the foam."
<P>
     It is  evident  that the  Czarina Catherine is still at
sea, hastening on her way to Varna.  Lord Godalming has just
returned. He had four telegrams, one each day since we started, and all to the same effect.  That the Czarina Catherine had
not been reported to Lloyd's from anywhere.  He had arranged
before leaving  London  that his agent should send him every
day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported.  He was
to have a message even if she were not  reported, so that he
might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other
end of the wire.
<P>
     We  had  dinner and went to bed early.  Tomorrow we are
to see the Vice Consul, and to arrange, if we can, about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives.  Van  Helsing
says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset.  The Count, even if he takes  the form of a
bat, cannot cross the running water of his own volition, and
so cannot leave the ship.  As he dare not  change  to  man's
form without  suspicion, which he evidently wishes to avoid,
he must remain in the box.  If, then, we  can  come on board
after sunrise, he is at our mercy, for  we  can open the box
and  make  sure  of him, as we did of poor Lucy,  before  he
wakes.  What mercy he shall get from us  all  will not count
for much.  We think that we shall not have much trouble with
officials or the seamen.  Thank  God!  This is  the  country
where bribery can do anything, and we are well supplied with
money.  We have only to make sure  that the ship cannot come
into port  between  sunset  and  sunrise  without  our being
warned, and we shall be safe.  Judge Moneybag will settle this
case, I think!
<P>

<P>
     16 October.--Mina's  report  still  the  same.  Lapping
waves and rushing water, darkness and favoring winds. We are
evidently in good time, and when we hear of the Czarina Catherine we shall be ready.  As she must  pass the Dardanelles
we are sure to have some report.
<P>

<P>
     17 October.--Everything  is  pretty  well fixed  now, I
think, to welcome the Count on his return from his tour. Godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box  sent
aboard might contain something stolen from a friend  of his,
and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk.
The owner gave him a paper telling the Captain  to  give him
every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship,
and also a similar authorization to his agent at  Varna.  We
have seen the agent, who was much impressed with Godalming's
kindly manner to him, and we are all satisfied that whatever
he can do to aid our wishes will be done.
<P>
     We have already  arranged what to do in case we get the
box open.  If  the  Count  is  there, Van Helsing and Seward
will cut off his head at once and  drive a stake through his
heart.  Morris  and  Godalming and I shall prevent interference, even  if  we  have to use the arms which we shall have
ready.  The  Professor  says  that  if  we  can so treat the
Count's body, it will soon  after  fall into dust.  In  such
case  there  would  be  no evidence  against us, in case any
suspicion of murder were aroused.  But  even if it were not,
we should stand or fall by  our act, and  perhaps  some  day
this very script may be  evidence to come between some of us
and a rope.  For myself, I  should  take the chance only too
thankfully if it were to come.  We mean  to  leave no  stone
unturned to carry out  our  intent.  We  have arranged  with
certain officials  that the instant the Czarina Catherine is
seen, we are to be informed by a special messenger.
<P>

<P>
     24 October.--A  whole week of waiting.  Daily telegrams
to Godalming, but  only the same story.  "Not yet reported."
Mina's morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried. Lapping waves, rushing water, and creaking masts.
<P>

<P>
         TELEGRAM, OCTOBER 24TH
 RUFUS SMITH, LLOYD'S, LONDON, TO LORD GODALMING, CARE OF

"Czarina Catherine reported this morning from Dardanelles."
<P>

DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     25 October.--How  I  miss  my  phonograph!  To  write a
diary with a pen is irksome to me!  But  Van Helsing says  I
must. We were all wild with excitement yesterday when Godalming got his telegram from Lloyd's. I know now what men feel
in battle when the call to action is heard.  Mrs.Harker, alone
of our party, did not show any signs of emotion.  After all, it
is not strange that she did not, for we took special care not
to let her know anything about it, and we  all  tried not to
show any excitement when we were in her presence.  In old days
she would, I am sure, have noticed, no  matter  how we might
have tried to conceal it.  But in  this way  she  is greatly
changed during the past three weeks. The lethargy grows upon
her, and though she seems  strong  and  well, and is getting
back some of her color, Van Helsing and I are not satisfied.
We talk of her often.  We have  not, however, said a word to
the others.  It would break  poor  Harker's heart, certainly
his nerve, if he knew  that we  had  even a suspicion on the
subject.  Van Helsing examines, he tells  me, her teeth very
carefully, whilst she is  in the  hypnotic condition, for he
says that so long as  they  do not begin to sharpen there is
no active danger of a change in her.  If this  change should
come, it would be necessary to take steps! We both know what
those steps  would  have to be, though we do not mention our
thoughts to each other.  We should neither of us shrink from
the task, awful though it be to contemplate. "Euthanasia" is
an excellent and a comforting word! I am grateful to whoever
invented it.
<P>
     It is only about 24 hours' sail from the Dardanelles to
here, at the rate the Czarina Catherine has come from London.
She should therefore arrive some time in the morning, but as
she cannot possibly get  in before noon, we are all about to
retire  early.  We shall get  up at one o'clock, so as to be
ready.
<P>

<P>
     25 October,  Noon.--No  news yet of the ship's arrival.
Mrs. Harker's hypnotic report  this  morning was the same as
usual, so it is possible that we may get news at any moment.
We men are all in a fever of excitement, except Harker,  who
is calm.  His hands are cold as ice, and an hour ago I found
him whetting the edge of the great Ghoorka  knife  which  he
now always carries with him.  It will be a bad lookout for the
Count if the edge of that "Kukri" ever  touches  his throat,
driven by that stern, ice-cold hand!
<P>
     Van Helsing  and  I  were  a  little alarmed about Mrs.
Harker today.  About noon she got into  a  sort  of lethargy
which we did not  like.  Although we  kept  silence  to  the
others,  we were neither of us happy about it.  She had been
restless all  the morning, so  that we were at first glad to
know that she  was  sleeping.  When,  however,  her  husband
mentioned casually that  she was sleeping so soundly that he
could not wake her, we went to her room to see for ourselves.
She was breathing naturally and looked so well and  peaceful
that  we  agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else.  Poor girl, she has so much to forget that it is
no wonder that sleep, if it brings oblivion to her, does her
good.
<P>

<P>
     Later.--Our  opinion  was  justified, for  when after a
refreshing sleep of  some  hours she  woke  up,  she  seemed
brighter  and  better than she had been for days.  At sunset
she made the usual  hypnotic  report.  Wherever he may be in
the Black Sea, the Count is hurrying to his destination.  To
his doom, I trust!
<P>

<P>

<P>
     26 October.--Another day  and no tidings of the Czarina
Catherine.  She ought to be  here by now.  That she is still
journeying somewhere is apparent, for Mrs. Harker's hypnotic
report at sunrise was  still the  same.  It is possible that
the vessel may be lying  by, at times, for fog.  Some of the
steamers which came  in last evening reported patches of fog
both to north and  south  of the port.  We must continue our
watching, as the ship may now be signalled any moment.
<P>

<P>
     27 October, Noon.--Most  strange.  No  news  yet of the
ship we wait for.  Mrs. Harker reported last night  and this
morning as usual.  "Lapping waves and rushing water," though
she added that "the waves were very  faint."  The  telegrams
from London have been  the same,  "no further  report."  Van
Helsing is  terribly  anxious, and told  me just now that he
fears the Count is escaping us.
<P>
     He added significantly,  "I  did not like that lethargy
of  Madam  Mina's.  Souls and memories can do strange things
during  trance."  I was  about  to as k him more, but Harker
just then came in, and he held up a warning  hand.  We  must
try tonight at sunset to make  her speak  more fully when in
her hypnotic state.
<P>

    28 October.--Telegram. Rufus  Smith, London, to Lord
    Godalming, care H. B. M. Vice Consul, Varna
    "Czarina  Catherine  reported entering Galatz at one
    o'clock today."
<P>

 DR. SEWARD'S DIARY
<P>

<P>
     28 October.--When  the  telegram  came  announcing  the
arrival in Galatz I do not think it was such a shock  to any
of us as might  have been expected.  True,  we did  not know
whence, or how, or when, the bolt would come. But I think we
all expected that something strange would happen. The day of
arrival at Varna made us individually  satisfied that things
would not be just as we had expected.  We only waited to learn
where the change would occur. None the less, however, it was
a surprise.  I suppose that nature works on  such  a hopeful
basis that we believe against ourselves that things  will be
as they ought to be, not as we should know that they will be.
Transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels, even if it be a
will-o'-the-wisp to man.  Van Helsing  raised  his hand over
his head for a moment, as though  in  remonstrance  with the
Almighty.  But he said not a word, and in a few seconds stood
up with his face sternly set.
<P>
     Lord  Godalming grew very pale, and sat breathing heavily.  I was  myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one
after another.  Quincey  Morris tightened his belt with that
quick  movement which I knew  so well.  In our old wandering
days it  meant "action."  Mrs. Harker grew ghastly white, so
that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn, but she folded
her hands  meekly  and looked up  in prayer.  Harker smiled,
actually smiled, the dark, bitter smile of one who is without
hope, but at the  same time his action belied his words, for
his hands instinctively  sought the  hilt of the great Kukri
knife and rested there.
<P>
     "When does  the  next train start for Galatz?" said Van
Helsing to us generally.
<P>
     "At 6:30  tomorrow morning!"   We  all started, for the
answer came from Mrs. Harker.
<P>
     "How on earth do you know?" said Art.
<P>
     "You forget,  or  perhaps you do not know, though Jonathan does  and  so does Dr. Van Helsing, that I am the train
fiend.  At home in  Exeter I always used to make up the time
tables, so  as  to be helpful  to my husband.  I found it so
useful sometimes, that  I  always  make  a study of the time
tables now.  I  knew  that  if  anything were  to take us to
Castle Dracula  we should  go  by Galatz,  or  at  any  rate
through  Bucharest,  so  I learned the times very carefully.
Unhappily there are  not  many  to  learn, as the only train
tomorrow leaves as I say."
<P>
     "Wonderful woman!" murmured the Professor.
<P>
     "Can't we get a special?" asked Lord Godalming.
<P>
     Van Helsing shook his head,  "I fear not.  This land is
very different from yours or mine.  Even if  we did  have  a
special, it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular
train.  Moreover, we have something to prepare.  We must think.
Now let us organize.  You, friend Arthur, go to the train and
get the tickets and arrange that all  be  ready for us to go
in the morning.  Do you, friend Jonathan, go to the agent of
the ship and get from him  letters  to  the agent in Galatz,
with authority to make  a search  of the ship just as it was
here.  Quincey Morris, you  see the Vice Consul, and get his
aid with his fellow in  Galatz and all he can do to make our
way smooth, so that  no times  be lost when over the Danube.
John will stay with Madam Mina and me, and we shall consult.
For so if time be  long you may be delayed.  And it will not
matter when  the sun set, since I am here with Madam to make
report."
<P>
     "And I,"  said  Mrs. Harker brightly, and more like her
old self than she  had  been for many a long day, "shall try
to be of use in all ways, and shall think and write  for you
as  I  used to  do.  Something  is  shifting from me in some
strange way, and I feel freer than I have been of late!"
<P>
     The  three  younger men looked happier at the moment as
they seemed  to realize  the significance of her words.  But
Van Helsing and  I, turning  to each other, met each a grave
and troubled glance.  We said nothing at the time, however.
<P>
     When the three men had gone out to their tasks Van Helsing asked Mrs.  Harker to look up the copy of the diaries and
find him the part of Harker's journal at the Castle.  She went
away to get it.
<P>
     When  the  door  was  shut upon her he said to me,  "We
mean the same!  Speak out!"
<P>
     "Here is some change.  It is a hope that makes me sick,
for it may deceive us."
<P>
     "Quite so.  Do  you  know  why  I  asked her to get the
manuscript?"
<P>
     "No!"  said  I, "unless it was to get an opportunity of
seeing me alone."
<P>
     "You are in  part right, friend John, but only in part.
I want  to  tell you  something.  And  oh,  my  friend, I am
taking a great, a terrible, risk. But I believe it is right.
In the moment when Madam Mina said those  words that  arrest
both our understanding, an inspiration came to  me.  In  the
trance of three days ago the  Count  sent her his  spirit to
read her mind.  Or more like he took her to see  him  in his
earth box in the ship with water rushing, just as it go free
at rise and set of sun.  He learn then that we are here, for
she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see ears
to hear than he, shut as he is, in  his  coffin box.  Now he
make his most effort to escape us.  At present he want her not.
<P>
     "He  is  sure with his so great knowledge that she will
come at his  call.  But he  cut her off, take her, as he can
do, out of his own power, that so  she come not to him.  Ah!
There I have hope that our man brains  that have been of man
so long and that have not lost the grace  of  God, will come
higher than his child-brain that lie in his tomb for centuries, that grow not yet to our stature, and that do only work
selfish and therefore small.  Here comes Madam  Mina.  Not a
word to her of her trance!  She knows  it not, and  it would
overwhelm her and  make  despair just when  we want all  her
hope, all her courage, when most we want all her great brain
which is trained like man's brain, but is of sweet woman and
have a special power which the Count give her,  and which he
may not take away altogether, though he think not so.  Hush!
Let me speak, and you shall learn.  Oh,  John, my friend, we
are in awful straits.  I fear, as I never feared before.  We
can only trust the good God. Silence!  Here she comes!"
<P>
      I thought  that  the Professor was going to break down
and have hysterics, just as he had when Lucy died, but with a
great  effort he  controlled  himself  and  was  at  perfect
nervous poise when Mrs. Harker tripped into the room, bright
and  happy looking and, in the doing of work, seemingly forgetful of her misery. As she came in, she handed a number of
sheets of typewriting to Van Helsing.  He  looked  over them
gravely, his face brightening up as he read.
<P>
     Then holding the pages between his finger and thumb  he
said,  "Friend John, to you with so much experience already,
and you too, dear Madam Mina, that  are  young,  here  is  a
lesson.  Do not fear ever to think.  A half thought has been
buzzing often in my brain, but I fear to let him  loose  his
wings.  Here now, with more  knowledge, I go back  to  where
that half thought come from and I  find that  he be no  half
thought at all.  That be a whole thought, though so young that
he is not yet strong to use his little wings.  Nay, like the
`Ugly Duck' of my friend Hans Andersen, he be no duck thought
at all, but a big swan thought that sail nobly on big wings,
when the time come for him to try them. See I read here what
Jonathan have written.
<P>
     "That  other of his race who, in a later age, again and
again, brought  his  forces over The Great River into Turkey
Land, who when he was  beaten  back, came  again, and again,
and again, though he had to come alone from the bloody field
where his troops were being slaughtered, since  he knew that
he alone could ultimately triumph.
<P>
     "What does this tell us?   Not  much?  No!  The Count's
child thought see nothing, therefore he speak so free.  Your
man thought see nothing.  My  man  thought see nothing, till
just now.  No!  But there comes  another  word from some one
who speak without thought because she, too, know not what it
mean, what it might mean.  Just as there  are elements which
rest, yet when in nature's course they move on their way and
they touch,  the  pouf!  And  there  comes a flash of light,
heaven wide, that blind and kill and destroy some.  But that
show up all earth below for leagues and  leagues.  Is it not
so?  Well, I shall  explain.  To begin, hav e you ever study
the philosophy  of  crime?  `Yes' and `No.'  You, John, yes,
for it  is  a  study of  insanity.  You, no, Madam Mina, for
crime touch you not, not but  once.  Still, your mind  works
true, and argues not a particulari ad universale.  There  is
this peculiarity in criminals.  It is  so  constant, in  all
countries and at all times, that even police,  who  know not
much from philosophy, come to know  it empirically, that  it
is.  That is to be empiric.  The criminal always work at one
crime, that is the true criminal who  seems  predestinate to
crime, and who will of none other.  This criminal has not full
man brain.  He is clever and cunning and resourceful, but he
be not of man stature as to brain.  He be of  child brain in
much.  Now this criminal of ours is pre-destinate  to  crime
also.  He, too, have child brain, and it  is of the child to
do what he have done.  The little bird, the little fish, the
little animal learn not by principle,  but empirically.  And
when he learn to do, then there is to him the ground to start
from to do more.  `Dos pou sto,' said  Archimedes.  `Give me
a fulcrum, and I shall move the world!'  To  do once, is the
fulcrum whereby child brain become  man brain.  And until he
have the purpose to do more, he continue to do the same again
every time, just as he have done before!  Oh, my dear, I see
that your  eyes  are  opened, and  that to you the lightning
flash show all the leagues,"for Mrs.  Harker began to clap her
hands and her eyes sparkled.
<P>
     He went on,  "Now you shall speak.  Tell us two dry men
of science what you see with those so bright eyes."  He took
her hand and held it whilst he spoke.  His  finger and thumb
closed  on her pulse, as I thought instinctively  and unconsciously, as she spoke.
<P>
     "The  Count is a criminal and of criminal type.  Nordau
and Lombroso would so classify him, and qua  criminal he  is
of an imperfectly formed mind.  Thus, in a difficulty he has
to seek  resource in habit.  His past is a clue, and the one
page of it  that we  know, and that from his own lips, tells
that once before, when in what Mr. Morris would call a`tight
place,' he went back to his own country from the land he had
tried to invade, and thence, without losing purpose, prepared
himself for a new effort.  He came again better equipped for
his work, and won. So he came to London to invade a new land.
He was beaten, and when all hope of success was lost, and his
existence in danger, he fled back over  the sea to his home.
Just as formerly  he  had fled  back  over the  Danube  from
Turkey Land."
<P>
     "Good, good!  Oh, you so clever lady!" said Van Helsing,
enthusiastically, as he stooped and kissed her hand.  A moment
later he said to me, as calmly as though we had  been having
a sick room consultation,  "Seventy-two only, and in all this
excitement.  I have hope."
<P>
     Turning  to  her again, he  said with keen expectation,
"But go on.  Go on!  There is more  to tell if you will.  Be
not afraid.  John and I know.  I  do in any case, and  shall
tell you if you are right.  Speak, without fear!"
<P>
     "I will try to.  But you will forgive me if I seem  too
egotistical."
<P>
     "Nay!  Fear  not, you must be egotist, for it is of you
that we think."
<P>
     "Then, as  he is  criminal  he is selfish.   And as his
intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness, he
confines himself to one purpose. That purpose is remorseless.
As he fled back over the Danube, leaving his forces to be cut
to pieces, so now he is intent on being safe, careless of all.
So his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night.
I felt it!  Oh, I felt it!  Thank God,  for His great mercy!
My soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour. And
all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he
may have used my knowledge for his ends."
<P>
     The Professor stood up,  "He has so used your mind, and
by it  he  has left us  here  in Varna, whilst the ship that
carried  him  rushed through  enveloping  fog up  to Galatz,
where, doubtless, he had made preparation for escaping  from
us.  But his child mind only saw so far.  And it may be that
as ever is in God's Providence, the very thing that the evil
doer most reckoned on for his selfish good, turns  out to be
his chiefest harm.  The hunter is taken in his own snare, as
the great Psalmist says.  For now that  he think he is  free
from every trace of us all, and  that he has escaped us with
so many  hours  to  him, then  his  selfish child brain will
whisper him to sleep.  He think, too, that as he cut himself
off from knowing your mind, there can be no knowledge of him
to you.  There is where he fail!  That  terrible  baptism of
blood which  he  give  you makes  you  free  to go to him in
spirit, as you have as yet done in  your times  of  freedom,
when the sun rise and set.  At such times you go by my volition  and  not  by  his.  And this power to  good of you and
others, you have won from your suffering at his hands.  This
is now all more precious that he know  it not, and  to guard
himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of  our
where. We, however, are not selfish, and we believe that God
is with us through all this blackness, and these  many  dark
hours.  We shall follow him, and we shall not flinch.  Even if
we peril ourselves that  we become like  him.  Friend  John,
this has been a great hour, and it have done much to advance
us on our way. You must be scribe and write him all down, so
that when the others return from their work you can give  it
to them, then they shall know as we do."
<P>
     And so I  have written it  whilst we wait their return,
and Mrs. Harker has  written  with  the typewriter all since
she brought the MS to us.
