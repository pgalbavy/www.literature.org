<p>It was a heavy disappointment to Maggie that she was not allowed to go
with her father in the gig when he went to fetch Tom home from the
academy; but the morning was too wet, Mrs. Tulliver said, for a little
girl to go out in her best bonnet. Maggie took the opposite view very
strongly, and it was a direct consequence of this difference of
opinion that when her mother was in the act of brushing out the
reluctant black crop Maggie suddenly rushed from under her hands and
dipped her head in a basin of water standing near, in the vindictive
determination that there should be no more chance of curls that day.</p>

<p>&quot;Maggie, Maggie!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Tulliver, sitting stout and helpless
with the brushes on her lap, &quot;what is to become of you if you're so
naughty? I'll tell your aunt Glegg and your aunt Pullet when they come
next week, and they'll never love you any more. Oh dear, oh dear! look
at your clean pinafore, wet from top to bottom. Folks 'ull think it's
a judgment on me as I've got such a child, - they'll think I've done
summat wicked.&quot;</p>

<p>Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie was already out of
hearing, making her way toward the great attic that run under the old
high-pitched roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran,
like a Skye terrier escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie's
favorite retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here
she fretted out all her ill humors, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten
floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with
cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her
misfortunes. This was the trunk of a large wooden doll, which once
stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was
now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three
nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie's
nine years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been
suggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old
Bible. The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than
usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But
immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many
nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt
when she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make
believe to poultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg
would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly
humiliated, so as to beg her niece's pardon. Since then she had driven
no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and
beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys
that made two square pillars supporting the roof. That was what she
did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a
passion that expelled every other form of consciousness, - even the
memory of the grievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were
getting quieter, and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of
sunshine, falling through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten
shelves, made her throw away the Fetish and run to the window. The sun
was really breaking out; the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again;
the granary doors were open; and there was Yap, the queer
white-and-brown terrier, with one ear turned back, trotting about and
sniffing vaguely, as if he were in search of a companion. It was
irresistible. Maggie tossed her hair back and ran downstairs, seized
her bonnet without putting it on, peeped, and then dashed along the
passage lest she should encounter her mother, and was quickly out in
the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and singing as she whirled,
&quot;Yap, Yap, Tom's coming home!&quot; while Yap danced and barked round her,
as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for
it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hegh, hegh, Miss! you'll make yourself giddy, an' tumble down i' the
dirt,&quot; said Luke, the head miller, a tall, broad-shouldered man of
forty, black-eyed and black-haired, subdued by a general mealiness,
like an auricula.</p>

<p>Maggie paused in her whirling and said, staggering a little, &quot;Oh no,
it doesn't make me giddy, Luke; may I go into the mill with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Maggie loved to linger in the great spaces of the mill, and often came
out with her black hair powdered to a soft whiteness that made her
dark eyes flash out with new fire. The resolute din, the unresting
motion of the great stones, giving her a dim, delicious awe as at the
presence of an uncontrollable force; the meal forever pouring,
pouring; the fine white powder softening all surfaces, and making the
very spidernets look like a faery lace-work; the sweet, pure scent of
the meal, - all helped to make Maggie feel that the mill was a little
world apart from her outside every-day life. The spiders were
especially a subject of speculation with her. She wondered if they had
any relatives outside the mill, for in that case there must be a
painful difficulty in their family intercourse, - a fat and floury
spider, accustomed to take his fly well dusted with meal, must suffer
a little at a cousin's table where the fly was <span style="text-decoration: underline">au naturel</span>, and the
lady spiders must be mutually shocked at each other's appearance. But
the part of the mill she liked best was the topmost story, - the
corn-hutch, where there were the great heaps of grain, which she could
sit on and slide down continually. She was in the habit of taking this
recreation as she conversed with Luke, to whom she was very
communicative, wishing him to think well of her understanding, as her
father did.</p>

<p>Perhaps she felt it necessary to recover her position with him on the
present occasion for, as she sat sliding on the heap of grain near
which he was busying himself, she said, at that shrill pitch which was
requisite in mill-society, - </p>

<p>&quot;I think you never read any book but the Bible, did you, Luke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, Miss, an' not much o' that,&quot; said Luke, with great frankness.
&quot;I'm no reader, I aren't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if I lent you one of my books, Luke? I've not got any <span style="text-decoration: underline">very</span>
pretty books that would be easy for you to read; but there's 'Pug's
Tour of Europe,' - that would tell you all about the different sorts of
people in the world, and if you didn't understand the reading, the
pictures would help you; they show the looks and ways of the people,
and what they do. There are the Dutchmen, very fat, and smoking, you
know, and one sitting on a barrel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, Miss, I'n no opinion o' Dutchmen. There ben't much good i'
knowin' about <span style="text-decoration: underline">them</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they're our fellow-creatures, Luke; we ought to know about our
fellow-creatures.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not much o' fellow-creaturs, I think, Miss; all I know - my old
master, as war a knowin' man, used to say, says he, 'If e'er I sow my
wheat wi'out brinin', I'm a Dutchman,' says he; an' that war as much
as to say as a Dutchman war a fool, or next door. Nay, nay, I aren't
goin' to bother mysen about Dutchmen. There's fools enoo, an' rogues
enoo, wi'out lookin' i' books for 'em.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, well,&quot; said Maggie, rather foiled by Luke's unexpectedly decided
views about Dutchmen, &quot;perhaps you would like 'Animated Nature'
better; that's not Dutchmen, you know, but elephants and kangaroos,
and the civet-cat, and the sunfish, and a bird sitting on its tail, - I
forget its name. There are countries full of those creatures, instead
of horses and cows, you know. Shouldn't you like to know about them,
Luke?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nay, Miss, I'n got to keep count o' the flour an' corn; I can't do
wi' knowin' so many things besides my work. That's what brings folks
to the gallows, - knowin' everything but what they'n got to get their
bread by. An' they're mostly lies, I think, what's printed i' the
books: them printed sheets are, anyhow, as the men cry i' the
streets.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, you're like my brother Tom, Luke,&quot; said Maggie, wishing to turn
the conversation agreeably; &quot;Tom's not fond of reading. I love Tom so
dearly, Luke, - better than anybody else in the world. When he grows up
I shall keep his house, and we shall always live together. I can tell
him everything he doesn't know. But I think Tom's clever, for all he
doesn't like books; he makes beautiful whipcord and rabbit-pens.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Luke, &quot;but he'll be fine an' vexed, as the rabbits are all
dead.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dead!&quot; screamed Maggie, jumping up from her sliding seat on the corn.
&quot;Oh dear, Luke! What! the lop-eared one, and the spotted doe that Tom
spent all his money to buy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As dead as moles,&quot; said Luke, fetching his comparison from the
unmistakable corpses nailed to the stable wall.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, Luke,&quot; said Maggie, in a piteous tone, while the big tears
rolled down her cheek; &quot;Tom told me to take care of 'em, and I forgot.
What <span style="text-decoration: underline">shall</span> I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you see, Miss, they were in that far tool-house, an' it was
nobody's business to see to 'em. I reckon Master Tom told Harry to
feed 'em, but there's no countin' on Harry; <span style="text-decoration: underline">he's</span> an offal creatur as
iver come about the primises, he is. He remembers nothing but his own
inside - an' I wish it'ud gripe him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Luke, Tom told me to be sure and remember the rabbits every day;
but how could I, when they didn't come into my head, you know? Oh, he
will be so angry with me, I know he will, and so sorry about his
rabbits, and so am I sorry. Oh, what <span style="text-decoration: underline">shall</span> I do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you fret, Miss,&quot; said Luke, soothingly; &quot;they're nash things,
them lop-eared rabbits; they'd happen ha' died, if they'd been fed.
Things out o' natur niver thrive: God A'mighty doesn't like 'em. He
made the rabbits' ears to lie back, an' it's nothin' but contrairiness
to make 'em hing down like a mastiff dog's. Master Tom 'ull know
better nor buy such things another time. Don't you fret, Miss. Will
you come along home wi' me, and see my wife? I'm a-goin' this minute.&quot;</p>

<p>The invitation offered an agreeable distraction to Maggie's grief, and
her tears gradually subsided as she trotted along by Luke's side to
his pleasant cottage, which stood with its apple and pear trees, and
with the added dignity of a lean-to pigsty, at the other end of the
Mill fields. Mrs. Moggs, Luke's wife, was a decidely agreeable
acquaintance. She exhibited her hospitality in bread and treacle, and
possessed various works of art. Maggie actually forgot that she had
any special cause of sadness this morning, as she stood on a chair to
look at a remarkable series of pictures representing the Prodigal Son
in the costume of Sir Charles Grandison, except that, as might have
been expected from his defective moral character, he had not, like
that accomplished hero, the taste and strength of mind to dispense
with a wig. But the indefinable weight the dead rabbits had left on
her mind caused her to feel more than usual pity for the career of
this weak young man, particularly when she looked at the picture where
he leaned against a tree with a flaccid appearance, his knee-breeches
unbuttoned and his wig awry, while the swine apparently of some
foreign breed, seemed to insult him by their good spirits over their
feast of husks.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm very glad his father took him back again, aren't you, Luke?&quot; she
said. &quot;For he was very sorry, you know, and wouldn't do wrong again.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, Miss,&quot; said Luke, &quot;he'd be no great shakes, I doubt, let's
feyther do what he would for him.&quot;</p>

<p>That was a painful thought to Maggie, and she wished much that the
subsequent history of the young man had not been left a blank.</p>
