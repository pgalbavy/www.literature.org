<p><em>ALTHOUGH </em>George and Victor Shelton parted for the time
from Deerfoot with regret, it cannot be said that either felt
any misgiving. There could be no doubt of the Shawanoe’s ability
to track them all the way to the Pacific if necessary, for the
trail would be plain except when they took to the water, which
was not likely to be for a long time to come. Moreover, Mul-tal-la
had said that little was to be feared from the Indians of the
country through which they must make their way. Had the boys been
alone danger might threaten, for most of the hunters and trappers
who penetrated those vast solitudes looked upon and treated the
red men as their enemies, and naturally were thus looked upon
and treated in their turn.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot and his companion met with no trouble of this nature
on their eastward journey. They were always able to make clear
their meaning by signs, and the fact that the two belonged to
the same race with the different tribes was a sufficient passport.
It seemed reasonable, therefore, to believe that the presence
of Mul-tal-la gave all the protection that could be needed.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot took Deerfoot’s place as leader, the brothers riding
a little to the rear, with Zigzag plodding in his usual indifferent
fashion. Just now the chief concern of the boys was as to how
they were to obtain a meal, for the thought of going to sleep
without food was intolerable.</p>

<p>To the left, in the direction of the foothills, they descried
a half-dozen elk browsing; but the game were as timid as antelopes,
without their fatal defect of overwhelming curiosity, and they
made off long before our friends could get within range. Several
miles to the eastward a dark undulating mass which covered hundreds
of acres showed where another vast herd of bison were moving southward.
Victor was disposed to ask Mul-tal-la to change their course so
as to get a shot at one of the animals, but his brother urged
him to wait in the hope of a better chance to bring down something
edible.</p>

<p>An hour later this chance presented itself. Three graceful antelopes
came in sight as the horsemen rode over an elevation. They were
cropping the grass on the slope of a hill nearly a half-mile distant.
George brought his glass to his eye and saw that the alert creatures
had already caught sight of them. They were standing with heads
erect and staring at the strangers, ready to dash off like the
wind on the first demonstration or further move toward them.</p>

<p>"There’s our supper!" exclaimed Victor, as the three halted,
for the Blackfoot was also interested in the sight. "I know they
aren’t the best food in the world, but I’m too hungry to be particular.
Mul-tal-la, how are we to manage it?"</p>

<p>"I will let my brother shoot one of them," replied the Blackfoot,
who, as you know, had caught Deerfoot’s manner of speech.</p>

<p>"That suits me. George, you don’t mind. It will be your turn
next time."</p>

<p>"I’m satisfied," returned his brother; "but you must remember
and not let your impatience run away with you. Keep cool or we
shall have to go without supper."</p>

<p>"Don’t fear for me," remarked the ardent Victor, who slipped
out of the saddle and set off without delay; "I know what’s at
stake."</p>

<p>Had he gone directly toward the antelopes they would have been
off on the instant. Instead, he went back over the ridge just
crossed, thus interposing that screen between him and the animals.
By following this he could approach within a fourth of a mile
of the game, and from that moment the utmost caution and skill
would be necessary. His brother and the Blackfoot withdrew so
as to occupy a position on the crest of the elevation, where they
could observe the actions of Victor from the beginning and at
the same time keep an eye upon the antelopes themselves.</p>

<p>The latter fixed their attention upon the point where the horsemen
had first come into view, hesitating whether to break away in
swift flight or to wait until they could gratify their resistless
curiosity. George Shelton and Mul-tal-la had dismounted, and lying
down in the grass, took care not to show themselves, through fear
of alarming the game, for, if the antelopes should make off, slight
chance of securing a meal would remain.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Victor was stealing along the ridge until, as he judged,
he had reached a point nearly opposite the animals, who were a
furlong distant. Then he crept up the elevation, whose crest fortunately
was crowned with the same exuberant growth of grass that grew
in the valley beyond.</p>

<p>So painstaking was he that his friends lost sight of him and
did not know when he was at the crest of the elevation until the
antelopes showed by their excitement that they had detected him.
They had resumed cropping the grass, when all three abruptly raised
their heads and dashed off at the height of their astonishing
speed. A moment later Victor was seen running down the slope until
a little beyond the base, when he dropped on his face.</p>

<p>Immediately after, while his body was screened from sight, he
raised the ramrod of his rifle, with his cap on the upper end.
The lower point was pushed down into the earth so that unaided
it supported the headgear. He had improved on the method of the
Blackfoot.</p>

<p>At first it looked as if this artifice had come too late, for
the antelopes continued running. When first seen they were in
a valley-like depression with a width of a third of a mile. They
made a pretty picture as they skimmed up the opposite slope with
their bodies showing in relief against the green background.</p>

<p>The cap, however, on top of the ramrod was so conspicuous that
they were not long in discovering it. The three stopped, turned
sideways and stood a few minutes gazing intently at the strange
object. Then all three broke into a gentle trot toward it, keeping
side by side most of the way. One of the trio had more sense or
possibly more timidity than his companions, for he abruptly stopped
and refused to go any farther. Strangely enough, the others showed
no hesitation until within a hundred yards of where the boy, stretched
out in the grass, was waiting for the moment when he could make
his aim sure.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they ain’t twins like me and George," was the whimsical
fancy of the lad, as he watched the similarity of action on the
part of the two antelopes. They had halted at precisely the same
second, and now moved forward again, both stepping high and advancing
with a curious hesitation which indicated the mental struggle
between fear and curiosity.</p>

<p>One turned to the left and ran nimbly in a circle of several
rods diameter, coming around and facing the ramrod and cap again,
as if hypnotized. At the same moment the other described a similar
circle to the right, returning like his companion, so that the
two stood side by side, with heads raised, and stepped off again,
as if keeping time with the signals of some one who had trained
them to the performance.</p>

<p>Victor was impatient, but he had too much prudence to throw away
the opportunity that he knew would come to him in a few minutes.
When both animals were nigh enough for him to be sure of his aim
he still hesitated, with gun pointed, hammer raised and finger
on the trigger. He was wondering how much nearer they would approach.
Surely, when they caught sight of him in the grass, their curiosity
would vanish, and they would dash off in the very extremity of
terror. He lay low and waited.</p>

<p>His plan was to hold his fire until the discovery should burst
upon the antelopes and they wheeled to flee. This turning would
give him his best chance, and he intended to shoot at the crisis
of the change of direction.</p>

<p>One of the creatures paused, as if he had observed something
that warned him to halt. His companion took three steps more and
then halted, with head high in air and one foot lifted and poised
like a pointer dog.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Victor Shelton bore hard on the
trigger, for he dared wait no longer, though he had decided a
moment before to fire as the animals wheeled.</p>

<p>To his dismay the hammer of his rifle did not descend. He pressed
harder, but the iron claw which grasped the flint remained immovable.
Then the truth flashed upon him. In his excitement he had only
half-cocked his gun. There should have been three clicks when
he drew back the hammer, but there were only two. In that position
it would not obey the trigger, no matter how hard the pressure.
It must be drawn to a full cock.</p>

<p>Without shifting his posture, he raised his thumb from the trigger
guard, so that it passed over the hammer, and then pulled it back
as far as it would go. It was at full cock, but in reaching that
point it emitted a single click.</p>

<p>Faint as was the sound, it was heard by the two antelopes fully
fifty yards away, and they whirled to dash off. At the instant
that their sides were toward him, Victor discharged his gun and
sent the bullet straight and true. One antelope kept on running,
his head flung back, while he sped across the valley like a swallow
on the wing. The one that had been smitten flirted back again
and then came on a full run straight for the spot in the grass
from which the fatal missile had been fired, as if determined
to slay his foe before his own strength failed him.</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar!" exclaimed the scared Victor; "I didn’t know an
antelope was that sort of beast. I’ve got to get out of here mighty
quick!"</p>

<p>There was no time to reload his weapon. Never did he leap to
his feet and make off at greater speed than when he saw the antelope
bearing down upon him, and it may be added that never did he run
so fast as in going up the slope and down the other side, and
then in a line for his companions.</p>

<p>At such critical moments a boy does not consider his duty done
unless he does all he can in the way of yelling. The shouts that
Victor Shelton sent resounding over the surrounding country must
have reached several miles. He did not look behind him, for that
would have interfered to a fractional extent with his speed, but
ran with might and main, marking each leap by a tremendous outcry.</p>

<p>He expected with every breath to feel the antelope’s razor-like
hoofs carve their way downward into his shoulders. That several
minutes passed without such carving he accepted as proof that
he was making as good time as his furious pursuer. If this was
gratifying it was also surprising, for Victor had never been noted
for his fleetness of foot, and he knew something of the fleetness
of the antelope. He concluded that there was no telling what a
boy of his age can accomplish in the way of running until the
actual necessity for it arises.</p>

<p>All this time Victor did not forget to yell. But after awhile
the expenditure of so much breath began to affect his strength.
So he closed his mouth and gave his whole attention to getting
over the ground in the best possible time.</p>

<p>Because of this cessation of his outcries he became aware that
his brother was also shouting. Listening carefully, Victor was
finally able to catch his words:</p>

<p>"What are you running for?"</p>

<p>"That’s a pretty question!" he reflected, "when he can see for
himself that the antelope is determined to have my life!"</p>

<p>It occurred to the fugitive to look around and see how far he
was leaving his fearful enemy behind. He was not in sight. He
had not even come over the ridge, but had fallen before taking
more than a dozen steps in the direction of the lad. This spurt
was a blind, aimless flight, its direction being involuntary.
The antelope would not have dared to attack the boy any more than
it would have dared to assail a grizzly bear.</p>
