How easy 't is to just forget<br/>
Until, alas, it is too late.<br/>
The most methodical of folks<br/>
Sometimes forget to shut the gate.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

<p>Farmer Brown's Boy is not usually the forgetful kind. He is pretty
good about not forgetting. But Farmer Brown's boy isn't perfect
by any means. He does forget sometimes, and he is careless sometimes.
He would be a funny kind of boy otherwise. But take it day in
and day out, he is pretty thoughtful and careful.</p>

<p>The care of the hens is one of Farmer Brown's boy's duties. It
is one of those duties which most of the time is a pleasure. He
likes the biddies, and he likes to take care of them. Every morning
one of the first things he does is to feed them and open the henhouse
so that they can run in the henyard if they want to. Every night
he goes out just before dark, collects the eggs and locks the
henhouse so that no harm can come to the biddies while they are
asleep on their roosts. After the big snowstorm he had shovelled
a place in the henyard where the hens could come out and exercise
and get a sun-bath when they wanted to, and in the very warmest
part of the clay they would do this. Always in the daytime he
took the greatest care to see that the henyard gate was fastened,
for no one knew better than he how bold Granny and Reddy Fox can
be when they are very hungry, and in winter they are very apt
to be very hungry most of the time. So he didn't intend to give
them a chance to slip into that henyard while the biddies were
out, or to give the biddies a chance to stray outside where they
might be still more easily caught.</p>

<p>But at night he sometimes left that gate open, as Granny Fox
had found out. You see, he thought it didn't matter because the
hens were locked in their warm house and so were safe, anyway.</p>

<p>It was just at dusk of the afternoon of the day when Granny and
Reddy Fox had talked over a plan to get one of those fat hens
that Farmer Brown's boy collected the eggs and saw to it that
the biddies had gone to roost for the night. He had just started
to close the little sliding door across the hole through which
the hens went in and out in the daytime when Bowser the Hound
began to make a great racket, as if terribly excited about something.</p>

<p>Farmer Brown's boy gave the little sliding door a hasty push,
picked up his basket of eggs, locked the henhouse door and hurried
out through the gate without stopping to close it. You see, he
was in a hurry to find out what Bowser was making such a fuss
about. Bowser was yelping and whining and tugging at his chain,
and it was plain to see that he was terribly eager to be set free.</p>

<p>"What is it, Bowser, old boy? Did you see something?" asked Farmer
Brown's boy as he patted Bowser on the head. "I can't let you
go, you know, because you probably would go off hunting all night
and come home in the morning all tired out and with sore feet.
Whatever it was, I guess you've scared it out of a year's growth,
old fellow, so we'll let it go at that."</p>

<p>Bowser still tugged at his chain and whined, but after a little
he quieted down. His master looked around behind the barn to see
if he could see what had so stirred up Bowser, but nothing was
to be seen, and he returned, patted Bowser once more, and went
into the house, never once giving that open henyard gate another
thought.</p>

<p>Half an hour later old Granny Fox joined Reddy Fox, who was waiting
on the doorstep of their home. "It is all right, Reddy; that gate
is open,"  said she.</p>

<p>"How did you do it, Granny?" asked Reddy eagerly.</p>

<p>"Easily enough," replied Granny. "I let Bowser get a glimpse
of me just as his master was locking up the henhouse. Bowser made
a great fuss, and of course, Farmer Brown's boy hurried out to
see what it was all about. He was in too much of a hurry to close
that gate, and afterwards he forgot all about it or else he thought
it didn't matter. Of course, I didn't let him get so much as a
glimpse of me."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Reddy.</p>
