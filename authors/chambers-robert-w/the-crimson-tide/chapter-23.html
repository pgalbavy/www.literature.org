<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In the strange, springlike weather which prevailed during the
last days of January, Vanya was buried under skies as fleecy blue
as April's, and Marya Lanois went back to the studio apartment
where she and Vanya had lived together. And here, alone, in the
first month of the new year, she picked up again the ravelled
threads of life, undecided whether to untangle them or to cut
them short and move on once more to further misadventure; or to
Vanya; or somewhere&mdash;or perhaps nowhere. So, pending some decision,
she left her pistol loaded.</p>

<p>Afternoon sunshine poured into the studio between antique silken
curtains, now drawn wide to the outer day for the first time since
these two young people had established for themselves a habitation.</p>

<p>And what, heretofore, even the lighted mosque-lamps had scarcely
half revealed, now lay exposed to outer air and daylight, gilded
by the sun&mdash;cabinets and chests of ancient lacquer; deep-toned
carpets in which slumbered jewelled fires of Asia; carved gods
from the East, crusted with soft gold; and tapestries of silk
shot with amethyst and saffron, centred by dragons and guarded
by the burning pearl.</p>

<p>Over all these, and the great mosque lantern drooping from above,
the false-spring sunshine fell; and through every open window
flowed soft, deceptive winds, fluttering the leaves of music on
the piano, stirring the clustered sheafs of growing jonquils and
narcissus, so that they swayed in their Chinese bowls.</p>

<p>Marya, in black, arranged her tiger-ruddy hair before an ancient
grotesquerie set with a reflecting glass in which, on some days,
one could see the form of the Lord Buddha, though none could ever
tell from whence the image came.</p>

<p>Where Vanya had left his music opened on the piano rack, the
sacred pages now stirred slightly as the soft wind blew; and scented
bells of Frisia swayed and bowed around a bowl where gold-fish
glowed.</p>

<p>Marya, at the piano, reading at sight from his inked manuscript,
came presently to the end of what was scored there&mdash;merely the
first sketch for a little spring song.</p>

<p>Some day she would finish it as part of a new debt&mdash;new obligations
she had now assumed in the slowly increasing light of new beliefs.</p>

<p>As she laid Vanya's last manuscript aside, under it she discovered
one of her own&mdash;a cynical, ribald, pencilled parody which she
remembered she had scribbled there in an access of malicious perversity.</p>

<p>As though curious to sound the obscurer depths of what she had
been when this jeering cynicism expressed her mood, she began
to read from her score and words, playing and intoning:</p>

"<em>CROQUE-MITAINE</em>.

</p>
<p>
"Parfaît qu'on attend La Marée Rouge,<br/>
&nbsp;La chose est positive.<br/>
&nbsp;On n'sait pas quand el' bouge,<br/>
&nbsp;Mais on sait qu'el' arrive.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;La Marée Rouge arrivera<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Et tout le monde en crèvera!

</p>
<p>
"Croque'morts, sacristains et abbés,<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mort aux saligaudes chic!

</p>
<p>
"La Marée Rouge montera<br/>
&nbsp;Et la bourgeoisie en crèvera!"

</p>
</div>
<p>The vicious irony of the atrocious parody&mdash;words and music&mdash;died
out in the sunny silence: for a few moments the girl sat staring
at the scored page; then she leaned forward, and, taking the manuscript
in both hands, tore it into pieces.</p>

<p>She was still occupied in destroying the unclean thing when a
servant appeared, and in subdued voice announced Palla and Ilse.</p>

<p>They came in as Marya swept the tattered scraps of paper into
an incense-bowl, dropped a lighted match upon them, and set the
ancient bronze vessel on the sill of the open window.</p>

<p>"Some of my vileness I am burning," she said, coming forward
and kissing Ilse on both cheeks.</p>

<p>Then, looking Palla steadily in the eyes, she bent forward and
touched her lips with her own.</p>

<p>"Nechevo," she said; "the thing that dwelt within me for a time
has continued on its way to hell, I hope."</p>

<p>She took the pale girl by both hands: "Do you understand?"</p>

<p>And Palla kissed her.</p>

<p>When they were seated: "What religious order would be likely
to accept me?" she asked serenely. And answered her own question:
"None would tolerate me&mdash;no order with its rigid systems of inquiry
and its merciless investigations.... And yet &mdash;I wonder....
Perhaps, as a lay-sister in some missionary order&mdash;where few care
to serve&mdash;where life resembles death as one twin the other....
I don't know: I wonder, Palla."</p>

<p>Palla asked her in a low voice if she had seen the afternoon
paper. Marya did not reply at once; but presently over her face
a hot rose-glow spread and deepened. Then, after a silence:</p>

<p>"The paper mentioned me as Vanya's wife. Is that what you mean?
Yes; I told them that.... It made no difference, for they would
have discovered it anyway. And I scarcely know why I made Vanya
lie about it to you all;&mdash;why I wished people to think otherwise....
Because I have been married to Vanya since the beginning.... And
I can not explain why I have not told you."</p>

<p>She touched a rosebud in the vase that stood beside her, broke
the stem absently, and sat examining it in silence. And, after
a few moments:</p>

<p>"As a child I was too imaginative.... We do not change&mdash;we women.
Married, unmarried, too wise, or too innocent, we remain what
we were when our mothers bore us.... Whatever we do, we never
change within: we remain, in our souls, what we first were. And
unaltered we die.... In morgue or prison or Potter's Field, where
lies a dead female thing in a tattered skirt, there, hidden somewhere
under rag and skin and bone, lies a dead girl-child."</p>

<p>She laid the unopened rosebud on Palla's knees; her preoccupied
gaze wandered around that silent, sunlit place.</p>

<p>"I could have taken my pistol," she said softly, "and I could
have killed a few among those whose doctrines at last slew Vanya....
Or I could have killed myself."</p>

<p>She turned and her remote gaze came back to fix itself on Palla.</p>

<p>"But, somehow, I think that Vanya would grieve.... And he has
grieved enough. Do you think so, Palla?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ilse said thoughtfully: "There is always enough death on earth.
And to live honestly, and love undauntedly, and serve humanity
with a clean heart is the most certain way to help the slaying
of that thing which murdered Vanya."</p>

<p>Palla gazed at Marya, profoundly preoccupied by the astounding
revelation that she had been Vanya's legal wife; and in her brown
eyes the stunned wonder of it still remained, nor could she seem
to think of anything except of that amazing fact.</p>

<p>When they stood up to take leave of Marya, the rosebud dropped
from Palla's lap, and Marya picked it up and offered it again.</p>

<p>"It should open," she said, her strange smile glimmering. "Cold
water and a little salt, my Palla&mdash;that is all rosebuds need&mdash;that
is all we women need&mdash;a little water to cool and freshen us; a
little salt for all the doubtful worldly knowledge we imbibe."</p>

<p>She took Palla's hands and bent her lips to them, then lifted
her tawny head:</p>

<p>"What do words matter? <em>Slava, slava</em>, under the moon!
Words are but symbols of needs&mdash;your need and Ilse's and mine&mdash;and
Jack's and Vanya's&mdash;and the master-word differs as differ our
several needs. And if I say Christ and Buddha and I are one, let
me so believe, if that be my need. Or if, from some high minarette,
I lift my voice proclaiming the unity of God!&mdash;or if I confess
the Trinity!&mdash;or if, for me, the god-fire smoulders only within
my own accepted soul&mdash;what does it matter? Slava, slava&mdash;the word
and the need spell Love&mdash;whatever the deed, Palla&mdash;my Palla!&mdash;whatever
the deed, and despite it."</p>

<p>As they came, together, to Palla's house and entered the empty
drawing-room, Ilse said:</p>

<p>"In mysticism there seems to be no reasoning&mdash;nothing definite
save only an occult and overwhelming restlessness.... Marya may
take the veil ... or nurse lepers ... or she may become a famous
courtesan.... I do not mean it cruelly. But, in the mystic, the
spiritual, the intellectual and the physical seem to be interchangeable,
and become gradually indistinguishable."</p>

<p>"That is a frightful analysis," murmured Palla. A little shiver
passed over her and she laid the rosebud against her lips.</p>

<p>Ilse said: "Marya is right: love is the world's overwhelming
need. The way to love is to serve; and if we serve we must renounce
something."</p>

<p>They locked arms and began to pace the empty room.</p>

<p>"What should I renounce?" asked Palla faintly.</p>

<p>Ilse smiled that wise, wholesome smile of hers:</p>

<p>"Suppose you renounce your own omniscience, darling," she suggested.</p>

<p>"I do not think myself omniscient," retorted the girl, colouring.</p>

<p>"No? Well, darling, from where then do you derive your authority
to cancel the credentials of the Most High?"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"On what authority except your own omniscience do you so confidently
preach the non-existence of omnipotence?"</p>

<p>Palla turned her flushed face in sensitive astonishment under
the gentle mockery.</p>

<p>Ilse said: "Love has many names; and so has God. And all are
good. If, to you, God means that little flame within you, then
that is good. And so, to others, according to their needs....
And it is the same with love.... So, if for the man you love,
love can be written only as a phrase&mdash;if the word love be only
one element in a trinity of which the other two are Law and Wedlock&mdash;does
it really matter, darling?"</p>

<p>"You mean I &mdash;I am to renounce my&mdash;creed?"</p>

<p>Ilse shook her head: "Who cares? The years develop and change
everything&mdash;even creeds. Do you think your lover would care whether,
at twenty-odd, you worship the flaming godhead itself, or whether
you guard in spirit that lost spark from it which has become entangled
with your soul?&mdash;whether you really do believe the man-made law
that licenses your mating; or whether you reject it as a silly
superstition? To a business man, convention is merely a safe procedure
which, ignored, causes disaster&mdash;he knows that whenever he ignores
it&mdash;as when he drives a car bearing no license; and the police
stop him."</p>

<p>"I never expected to hear this from you, Ilse."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You are unmarried."</p>

<p>"No, Palla."</p>

<p>The girl stared at her: "Did you <em>marry</em> Jack?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes. In the hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ilse!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"He asked me."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" her mouth quivered and she bent her head and placed her
hand on Ilse's arm for guidance, because the starting tears were
blinding her now. And at last she found her voice: "I meant I
am so thankful&mdash;darling&mdash;it's been a&mdash;a nightmare&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It would have been one to me if I had refused him. Except that
Jack wished it, I did not care.... But I have lately learned&mdash;some
things."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you consented because he wished it?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Is not that our law?"</p>

<p>"Do you so construe the Law of Love and Service? Does it permit
us to seek protection under false pretences; to say yes when we
mean no; to kneel before a God we do not believe in; to accept
immunity under a law we do not believe in?"</p>

<p>"If all this concerned only one's self, then, no! Or, if the
man believed as we do, no! But even then&mdash;" she shook her head
slowly, "unless <em>all</em> agree, it is unfair."</p>

<p>"Unfair?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is unfair if you have a baby. Isn't it, darling? Isn't
it unfair and tyrannical?"</p>

<p>"You mean that a child should not arbitrarily be placed by its
parents at what it might later consider a disadvantage?"</p>

<p>"Of course I mean just that. Do you know, Palla, what Jack once
said of us? He said&mdash;rather brutally, I thought&mdash;that you and
I were immaturely un-moral and pitiably unbaked; and that the
best thing for both of us was to marry and have a few children
before we tried to do any more independent thinking."</p>

<p>Palla's reply was: "He was such a dear!" But what she said did
not seem absurd to either of them.</p>

<p>Ilse added: "You know yourself, darling, what a relief it was
to you to learn that I had married Jack. I think you even said
something like, 'Thank God,' when you were choking back the tears."</p>

<p>Palla flushed brightly: "I meant&mdash;" but her voice ended in a
sob. Then, all of a sudden, she broke down&mdash;went all to pieces
there in the dim and empty little drawing-room&mdash;down on her knees,
clinging to Ilse's skirts....</p>

<p>She wished to go to her room alone; and so Ilse, watching her
climb the stairs as though they led to some dread calvary, opened
the front door and went her lonely way, drawing the mourning veil
around her face and throat.</p>
