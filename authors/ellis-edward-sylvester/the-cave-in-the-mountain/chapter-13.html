<p>Leaving his mustang in charge of Fred, the Irishman turned to
the right, and followed the stream into the rocks. The course
was so winding that he speedily disappeared from sight. The boy,
who was compelled to sit still and await his return, at perhaps
the most dangerous portion of the road, felt anything but comfortable
over the erratic proceeding of his friend. But, fortunately, the
latter had been gone but a short time when he reappeared, hurrying
forward as if somebody was at his heels.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he remarked, as he sprang into the saddle,
took up the reins, and started on. "I think the Apaches are there,
though I can't be sartin; but I found out what I wanted to l'arn."</p>

<p>Then he explained that he followed up the stream to the place
where it came from beneath the rocks, which formed a part of the
wall of the cave, where a curious fact attracted his attention.
In its passage beneath the stone the tunnel widened and flattened,
so that, where it shot forth to the sunlight again, its width
was some twenty feet, and its depth only a few inches. The appearance
it presented was very much like that of the gates of a mill-pond
when they have been slightly raised to allow a discharge of water
beneath. Through the passage-way thus afforded no living person
could have forced his way; and, had Mickey O'Rooney attempted
it, nothing in the world could have saved him from drowning. The
Irishman himself realized it, and was thankful enough that he
had refrained from making the desperate attempt.</p>

<p>The two continued their sweeping gallop for several hours, during
which they did not catch a glimpse of Indians, but they were alarmed
by hearing the reports of guns at no great distance on the right.
The firing was irregular, sometimes several shots being heard
together, and then they were more of a dropping character. This
showed that a fight of some kind was going on, but as to its precise
nature they could only conjecture. It might be that a party of
Comanches and Apaches, or Kiowas, or hunters were enjoying a hot
time, but the two friends were glad to get out of the neighborhood
as speedily as possible. At noon they enjoyed the satisfaction
of knowing that they had made good and substantial progress on
the way home. There was an abundance of grass and water, and when
the sun was overhead they went into camp.</p>

<p>"I'm as hungry as a panther that has been fasting for a month,"
said Mickey, as he dismounted; "and I haven't got a mouthful of
food lift. There ain't any use of a chap starving to death to
accommodate anybody else, and I don't mane to do the same."</p>

<p>Fred Munson's hunger was scarcely less than his, but the boy
would have been willing to have undergone still more, rather than
incur the risk that was now inevitable. But Mickey saw nothing
to be gained by such a course and contended that they should give
their attention to the wants of their bodies, before they were
weakened by fasting and fatigue.</p>

<p>Mickey promised not to be absent long, and then started in search
of provender. Game was abundant in that part of the world, and
he was confident that much time would not be required to bring
down some toothsome dainty.</p>

<p>"He has an uncomfortable way of running off and leaving a fellow
alone," muttered Fred, as he watched the vanishing figure of his
friend. "I haven't anything but my revolver, and only two shots
left in that, and it seems to me that this is about the worst
place we could stop."</p>

<p>The point where they camped was in the pass, which, at that point,
widened considerably. The right wall curved far inward in a semi-circular
shape, the opposite remaining the same, the gorge looking as if
an immense slice had been scooped out of its northern boundary.
The rocks on every hand ranged from a dozen to a hundred feet
in height, with numerous openings, through which a horseman could
easily pick his way. The tops were covered with vegetation, the
greater portion of which was vigorous and dense.</p>

<p>Fred found himself standing in an immense amphitheatre, as one
can imagine how the gladiators of Rome stood in the Coliseum,
when an audience of over a hundred thousand were seated and looking
down upon them. He could not but note the helpless situation a
party of men would be in if caught where he was.</p>

<p>"If a company of United States Cavalry should camp here, and
the Indians opened on them from the rocks above, they would have
to stand and be shot down, one after another, or else run the
gauntlet and be picked off in the same way."</p>

<p>The appearance of the ground showed that the spot was a favorite
camping-site of the Indians. Fred, for a time, suspected that
it was the place where Lone Wolf and his band had spent the first
night out from New Boston; but an examination showed that it did
not correspond in many points. The remains of charred wood, of
bleaching bones and ashes proved that many a camp-fire had been
kindled. And, in all probability, every one of them had warmed
the shins and toasted the food of the red cut-throats of that
section.</p>

<p>The two mustangs were tethered near one side of the space where
there was grass and water, and the lad set about it to select
a proper place in which to build their camp-fire. There was no
trouble in determining this; but, when he started to gather wood,
he was surprised to discover that there was much less than he
supposed. The former tenants of the place had cleared it up pretty
thoroughly.</p>

<p>"There is plenty of wood over yonder," he said to himself, looking
in the direction taken by Mickey O'Rooney; "and where there is
so much growing there must be some upon the ground. I'll go over
and gather some, and have the fire all ready when he comes back."</p>

<p>It was quite a walk from where he stood to the side of the semicircular
widening of the pass, and as he went over it he was surprised
to find it greater than it appeared. When he picked his way between
the rocks, and began clambering among the trees and vegetation,
he concluded that he was fully two hundred yards from where the
mustangs were grazing.</p>

<p>However, he did not allow himself to lose any time in speculation
and wonderment, but set to work at once to gather wood with which
to kindle a fire in readiness for the return of Mickey. There
was enough around him to afford all he needed and he was engaged
in leisurely collecting an armful when he was startled by the
rattling of the leaves behind him.</p>

<p>The wood was dropped on the instant, and the alarmed lad wheeled
about to face his new danger. Instead of two or three Indians,
as he had anticipated, he saw an enormous grizzly bear, about
a dozen feet in the rear, coming directly toward him, with very
little doubt of his purpose.</p>

<p>Fred had no thought of anything of this character, and for a
time he was paralyzed with terror, unable to speak or stir. These
precious seconds were improved by the huge animal, which continued
lumbering heavily forward toward the boy. Bruin had his jaws apart
and his red tongue lolling out, while a guttural grunt was occasionally
heard, as if the beast was anticipating the crunching of the tender
flesh and bones of the lad.</p>

<p>Before the latter was within reach, however, he had recovered
his usual activity, and, with a bound and a yell of terror, Fred
started in the direction of the clearing, where he had left the
mustangs, and where he had intended to kindle the camp-fire. But
the enormous, bulky creature, although swinging along in his awkward
fashion, still made good speed, and gained so rapidly upon the
boy that he almost abandoned hope of escape.</p>

<p>At this critical moment Fred thought of his revolver, and he
whipped it out in a twinkling. Whirling about, he took quick aim
and discharged both barrels almost in the face of the brute. Then,
flinging the pistol against his leather nose, he turned back and
continued his flight at the utmost bent of his speed. Both bullets
struck the brute and wounded him, but not fatally, nor, indeed,
enough to check his advance.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>WHIRLING ABOUT HE TOOK QUICK AIM</em>.]</p>

<p>The grizzly bear, as found in his native wilds, is killed with
extreme difficulty, and the only thing that seemed to affect the
monster in the present instance was the flash of the pistol in
his eyes. He paused, and, rearing on his hind legs, snorted, snuffed,
and pawed his nose as if the bullets were splinters which he was
seeking to displace. Then, with an angry growl, he dropped on
all fours and resumed his pursuit of the author of his confusion
and hurts. The wounds incensed the brute, and he plunged along
at a faster rate than before, gaining so rapidly that there could
be no doubt as to the result.</p>

<p>Being without any weapon at all, there seemed but one hope for
Fred, and that was to reach his mustang in time to mount and avail
himself of his speed. For a hundred feet or so he ran down a rapid
slope, between the trees and rocks, until he reached the camping
site, where he had a run of a couple of hundred yards across a
comparatively level plain to reach the point where his animal
was awaiting him.</p>

<p>In going down this wooded slope, the smaller size of the boy
gave him considerable advantage. Yet, so well did the grizzly
succeed that he reached the spot less than twenty feet in his
rear, and, heading directly for him, at once proceeded to decrease
the distance still further. This placed the question of escape
by superior speed upon the part of the lad as among the impossibilities,
and it began to look very much as if his race were run.</p>

<p>At this juncture, as if all the fates had combined against him,
Fred, while glancing backward over his shoulder, stumbled and
fell. He sprang up as hastily as possible, but the loss of ground
was irreparable. As he looked back he saw that the colossal beast
was so close that it seemed that one sweep of his paw would smite
the terrified fugitive from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>It was a critical moment indeed, and the crack of the rifle from
the wood, which the pursuer and pursued had just left, was not
a breath of time too soon. Aimed by one who knew the vulnerable
points of such a creature, and by someone whose skill was unsurpassed,
the leaden messenger crashed its way through bone and muscle to
the seat of life. The brute, which was ready to fall upon and
devour the young fugitive, pitched heavily forward and rolled
upon the ground in the throes of death.</p>

<p>Fred did not realize his delivery until he had gone some distance
further and looked back and saw the black mass motionless upon
the ground. After some hesitation, he then turned and walked distrustfully
back to where it lay.</p>

<p>He found the beast stone-dead, a rill of blood from beneath the
fore-leg showing where some one's bullet had done the business.
The lad recalled the sound of the gun which had reached his ear.</p>

<p>"That was the best shot for me that Mickey ever made," he muttered,
looking around for his friend.</p>

<p>But he was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>"Mickey must always have his fun," added Fred after failing to
detect him. "Instead of coming out at once and letting me know
how he came to do it, he fires the lucky shot, and then waits
to see how I will act. My gracious! he is a bouncer!"</p>

<p>This last remark was excited by the carcass, which he kicked,
and which shook like a mountainous mass of jelly; and as he passed
around it he gained a fair idea of the immense proportions of
the bear, in whose grasp he would have been as helpless as in
that of a royal Bengal tiger.</p>

<p>"Whew! but he came mighty close to me! When I fell down I expected
to feel his paws on me before I could get up. In a few seconds
more it would have been all up with me."</p>

<p>Several minutes passed, and nothing was seen of the Irishman,
whereupon the lad concluded he might as well go back and gather
the wood, which would be needed at the camp-fire.</p>

<p>"I wonder if there's any more of them," he muttered, as he began
picking his way among the rocks. "If there are, why Mickey must
look out for me."</p>

<p>He found the sticks just as he had thrown them down and he proceeded
to regather them, keeping a careful watch for another dangerous
visitor. All remained quiet, however, and, making his way down
the wooded slope into the open area, he looked back and found
that he was still alone. So it continued until he returned to
where the two mustangs were tethered. There he carefully adjusted
the sticks and prepared everything, after which he began to feel
some impatience at the non-appearance of his friend.</p>

<p>"He must see more fun in that kind of thing than I do. There's
no telling what has become of those six Apaches we left down in
the cave. I feel sure that they've got above ground again. It
won't take long for them to find their mustangs, or some other
horses, and they may be a mile away, and there may be other parties
close by. Halloa!"</p>

<p>Fred thought that he had no matches about his person; but he
was making a sort of aimless hunt when he found a solitary lucifer
at the bottom of his pocket. This he carefully struck against
the rock behind him, and in a few minutes the camp-fire was started
and burning merrily.</p>

<p>As he sat down to wait he looked toward the point where the Irishman
had vanished from sight. There he was, bearing on his shoulders
some choice sections of a young antelope he had shot, although
Fred recalled that he had not heard the report of his gun, except
when the grizzly was shot. As Mickey came along over the same
path taken by the boy, he was forced to make a detour around the
carcass of the bear. He paused to survey it, his whole manner
betraying great astonishment, as if he had never beheld anything
of the kind. He walked around the body several times, punched
it with his foot, and finally, grasping his twenty pounds of meat
in his right hand, approached the camp-fire.</p>

<p>Here he at once began the preparations for broiling it. The antelope
had been of goodly size and he had cut out the most luscious portions,
so as to avoid carrying back any waste material. He had a great
deal more than both could eat, it is true, but it was a commendable
custom with the Irishman to lay in a stock against emergencies
that were likely to arise.</p>

<p>While thus employed, it would have been impossible for Mickey
to hold his tongue.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but it was queer, was the same, the way I came to
cotch this gintleman. I hunted him a little ways, when he made
a big jump, and I thought had got a long ways off, but when I
came to folly him, I found he had cornered himself among the rocks,
where there was no show of getting out, except by coming back
on me. The minute I showed mesilf, he made a rush for me arms,
just as all the purty gals in Tipperary used to do when I came
along the street. An antelope can't do much, but I don't care
about their coming down on me in that style, and so I pulled up
and let drive. He was right on me when I pulled trigger, and he
made one big jump that carried him clear over my head, and landed
him stone dead on the other side."</p>

<p>"That was a good shot, but not as good as when you brought down
the grizzly bear at my heels."</p>

<p>Mickey O'Rooney was particularly busy just then with his culinary
operations, and he stared at the lad with an expression of comical
amazement that made the young fellow laugh.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, why don't ye talk sinse?" added Mickey, impatiently.
"I've heard Soot Simpson say that if ye only put your shot in
the right spot, ye don't want but one of 'em to trip the biggest
grizzly that ever navigated. I was going to obsarve that ye had
been mighty lucky to send in your two pistol-shots just where
they settled the business, though I s'pose the haythen was so
close on ye whin ye fired that ye almost shoved the weapon into
his carcass."</p>

<p>"I shot him, Mickey, before I fairly started to run, but he didn't
mind it any more than if I spit in his face. It was your own shot
that did the business."</p>

<p>"Me own shot!" repeated Mickey, still staring with an astonished
expression. "I never fired any shot at the baste, and never saw
him till a few minutes ago, when I was coming this way."</p>

<p>It was Fred Munson's turn to be astonished, and he asked, in
his amazed, wondering way:</p>

<p>"Who, then, fired the shot that killed him? I didn't."</p>

<p>"I thought ye did the same, for it was not mesilf."</p>

<p>The lad was more puzzled than ever. He saw that Mickey was in
earnest, and was telling him the truth, and each, in fact, understood
that <em>he</em> had been under a misapprehension as to who had
slain the grizzly bear.</p>

<p>"The beast was right on me," continued Fred, "and I didn't think
there was any chance for me, when I heard the crack of a rifle
from the bushes, and, looking back, saw that the bear was down
on the ground, making his last kick."</p>

<p>Mickey let the meat scorch, while he stopped to scratch his head,
as was his custom when he was in a mental fog.</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but that is queer, as me mither used to obsarve when
she found she had not been desaved by belaving what we childer
told her. There was somebody who was kind enough to knock over
the grizzly at the most convanient season for ye, and then he
doesn't choose to send over his card wid his post-office address
on."</p>

<p>"Who do you think it was, Mickey?"</p>

<p>"It must have been some red spalpeen that took pity on ye. Who
knows but it was Lone Wolf himself?"</p>

<p>Both looked about them in a scared, inquiring way, but could
see nothing of their unknown friend or enemy, as the case might
be.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Mickey, that it makes me feel as if we ought to
get out of here."</p>

<p>"Ye're right, and we'll just swally some of this stuff, and then
we'll 'light out."</p>

<p>He tossed the lad a goodly-sized piece of meat, which, if anything,
was overdone. Both ate more rapidly than was consistent with hygiene,
their eyes continually wandering over the rocks and heights around
them, in quest of their seemingly ever-present enemies, the Apaches.
It required but a few moments for them to, complete their dinner.
Mickey, in accordance with his custom, carefully folded up what
was left, and, taking a drink from the stream which ran near at
hand, they sprang upon the backs of their mustangs, and headed
westward in the direction of New Boston, provided such a settlement
was still in existence by the grace of Lone Wolf, leader of the
Apaches.</p>

<p>"Now," said Mickey, whose spirits seemed to rise when he found
himself astride of his trusty mustang again, "if we don't have
any bad luck, we ought to be out of the mountains by dark."</p>

<p>"And after that?"</p>

<p>"Then a good long ride across the prairie, and we'll be back
again wid the folks."</p>

<p>"How glad I am that father isn't there, that he staid at Fort
Aubray, for when he comes along in a few weeks, he won't know
anything about this trouble till I tell him the whole story myself,
and then it will be too late for him to worry."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm glad it's so, for it saams if I had a spalpeen of a
son off wid Lone Wolf, among the mountains, I'd feel as bad as
if he'd gone in swimming where the water was over his head. And
then it will be so nice to sit down and tell the ould gintleman
about it, and have him lambaste ye 'cause you wasn't more respictful
to Lone Wolf. All them things are cheerful, and make the occasion
very plisant. Begorrah, I should like to know where that old redskin
is, for Soot Simpson tells me that he is the greatest redskin
down in this part of the world. He's the spalpeen that robbed
a government train and made himself a big blanket out of the new
greenbaeks that he stole. Soot says that there isn't room on his
lodge-pole for half the scalps that he has taken. Bad luck to
the spalpeen, he will peel the topknot from the head of a lovely
woman, or swaat child, such as I used to be, as quick as he would
from the crown of a man of my size. He's an old riprobate, is
the same, and Soot says he can niver die resigned and at pace
with all mankind till he shoots him."</p>

<p>"I'll be very glad to keep out of his way, if he'll keep out
of mine. I wonder why he didn't kill me when he had the chance,
instead of keeping me so long."</p>

<p>"I s'pose he meant to carry ye up where his little spalpeens
live, and turn ye over to them for their amusement."</p>

<p>"How could I amuse them?"</p>

<p>"There be a good many ways. They might have stuck little wooden
pegs in your hide, then set fire to 'em, and then walked ye round
for fireworks; or they might fill your ears with powder, and tech
it off, and then watched the iligant exprission of your countenance.
Or they might lave set ye to running up and down between two rows
of 'em, about eight or ten miles long, while aich stood with a
big shillalah in his hand, and banged ye over the head with it
as ye passed. There be a good many ways, according to what Soot
told me, but that's enough to show ye that Lone Wolf and his folks
wouldn't have been at a loss to find delightful ways of giving
the little childher the innocent sport they must have."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think they would, if that's the kind of fun they
like," replied the horrified boy. "I've thanked the Lord hundreds
of times that He helped me get out of Lone Wolf's clutches, and
my dread is that he may catch us before we can get out of the
mountain. I don't believe we could find as good a chance as I
did the other night."</p>

<p>"Ye're right; that thing couldn't happen ag'in. Lightning doesn't
strike twice in the same place; but we've got good horses, and
if he don't pin us up in the pass, I think our chance is as good
as could be asked."</p>

<p>"That's what troubles me," said Fred, who was galloping at his
side, and who kept continually glancing from the tops of the rocks
upon the right to the tops upon the left. "You know there are
Indians all over, and I wonder that some of them haven't seen
us already. S'pose they do, and they're behind us, they can signal
to somebody ahead, and the first thing we know, they've got us
shut in on both sides."</p>

<p>"That thing may happen," replied Mickey, who did not appear as
apprehensive as his young friend; "but I have the best of hope
that the same won't. I don't think Lone Wolf knows we're anywhere
around here, and before he can find out, I also hope we shall
be beyond his raich."</p>
