<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>After the first few days of his arrival at Shotover time had
threatened to hang heavily on Mortimer's mottled hands. After
the second day afield he recognised that his shooting career was
practically over; he had become too bulky during the last year
to endure the physical exertion; his habits, too, had at length
made traitors of his eyes; a half hour's snipe-shooting in the
sun, and the veins in his neck swelled ominously. Panting, eyes
inflamed, fat arms wobbly, he had scored miss after miss, and
laboured onward, sullenly persistent to the end. But it was the
end. That cup day finished him; he recognised that he was done
for. And, following the Law of Pleasure, which finishes us before
we are finished with it, he did not experience any particular
sense of deprivation in the prospect. Only the wholesome dread
caging. But Mortimer, not yet done with self-indulgence in more
convenient forms, cast about him within his new limits for occupation
between those hours consecrated to the rites of the table and
the card-room.</p>

<p>He drove four, but found that it numbed his arms, and that the
sea air made him sleepy. Motor-cars agreed with him only when
driving with a pretty woman. Forced through ennui to fish off
the rocks, he soon tired of the sea-perch and rock-cod and the
malodours of periwinkle and clam.</p>

<p>Then he frankly took to Major Belwether's sunny side of the gun-room,
with illustrated papers and apples and decanter. But Major Belwether,
always as careful of his digestion as of his financial secrets,
blandly dodged the pressing invitations to rum and confidence,
until Mortimer sulkily took up his headquarters in the reading-room,
on the chance of his wife's moving elsewhere. Which she did, unobtrusively
carrying Captain Voucher with her in a sudden zeal for billiard
practice on rainy mornings now too frequent along the coast.</p>

<p>Mortimer possessed that mysterious talent, so common among the
financially insolvent, for living lavishly on an invisible income.
But, plan as he would, he had never been able to increase that
income through confidential gossip with men like Quarrier or Belwether,
or even Ferrall. What information his pretty wife might have extracted
he did not know; her income had never visibly increased above
the vanishing point, although, like himself, she denied herself
nothing. One short, lively interview with her had been enough
to drive all partnership ideas out of his head. If he wanted to
learn anything financially advantageous to himself he must do
it without her aid; and as he was perpetually in hopes of the
friendly hint that never came, he still moused about when opportunity
offered; and this also helped to kill time.</p>

<p>Besides, he was always studying women. Years before, Grace Ferrall
had snapped her slim fingers in his face; and here, at Shotover,
the field was limited. Mrs. Vendenning had left; Agatha Caithness
was still a pale and reticent puzzle; Rena, Katharyn, and Eileen
tormented him; Marion Page, coolly au fait, yawned in his face.
There remained Sylvia, who, knowing nothing about his species,
met him half-way with the sweet and sensitive deference due a
somewhat battered and infirm gentleman of forty-eight&mdash;until a
sleek aside from Major Belwether spoiled everything, as usual,
for her, leaving her painfully conscious and perplexed between
doubt and disgust.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the wealthy master of Black Fells, Beverly Plank,
had found encouragement enough at Shotover to venture on tentative
informality. There was no doubt that ultimately he must be counted
on in New York; but nobody except him was impatiently cordial
for the event; and so, at the little house party, he slipped and
slid from every attempt at closer quarters, until, rolling smoothly
enough, he landed without much discomfort somewhere between Mr.
and Mrs. Leroy Mortimer. And it was not a question as to "which
would be good to him," observed Major Belwether, with his misleading
and benevolent mirth; "it was, which would be goodest quickest!"</p>

<p>And Mrs. Mortimer, abandoning Captain Voucher by the same token,
displayed certain warning notices perfectly comprehensive to her
husband. And at first he was inclined to recognise defeat.</p>

<p>But the general insuccess which had so faithfully attended him
recently had aroused the long-dormant desire for a general review
of the situation with his wife&mdash;perhaps even the furtive hope
of some conjugal arrangement tending toward an exchange of views
concerning possible alliance.</p>

<p>The evening previous, to his intense disgust, host, hostess,
and guests had retired early, in view of the point-shooting at
dawn. For not only was there to be no point-shooting for him,
but he had risen from the card-table heavily hit; and besides,
for the first time his apples and port had disagreed with him.</p>

<p>As he had not risen until mid-day he was not sleepy. Books were
an aversion equalled only by distaste for his own company. Irritated,
bored, he had perforce sulkily entered the elevator and passed
to his room, where there was nothing on earth for him to do except
to thumb over last week's sporting periodicals and smoke himself
stupid.</p>

<p>But it required more than that to ensnare the goddess of slumber.
He walked about the room, haunted of slow thoughts; he stood at
the rain-smeared pane, fat fingers resting on the glass. The richly
flavoured cigar grew distasteful; and if he could not smoke, what,
in pity's name, was he to do?</p>

<p>Involuntarily his distended eyes wandered to his wife's locked
and bolted door; then he thought of Beverly Plank, and his own
failure to fasten himself upon that anxiously over-cordial individual
with his houses and his villas and his yachts and his investments!</p>

<p>He stepped to the switch and extinguished the lights in his room.
Under the door, along the sill, a glimmer came from his wife's
bed-chamber. He listened; the maid was still there; so he sat
down in the darkness to wait; and by-and-by he heard the outer
bedroom door close, and the subdued rustle of the departing maid.</p>

<p>Then, turning on his lights, he moved ponderously and jauntily
to his wife's door and knocked discreetly.</p>

<p>Leila Mortimer came to the door and opened it; her hair was coiled
for the night, her pretty figure outlined under a cascade of clinging
lace.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"Are you point-shooting to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to chat with you."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. I'm driving to Wenniston, after breakfast, with Beverly
Plank, and I need sleep."</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you," he repeated doggedly.</p>

<p>She regarded him for a moment in silence, then, with an assenting
gesture, turned away into her room; and he followed, heavily apprehensive
but resolved.</p>

<p>She had seated herself among a pile of cushions, one knee crossed
over the other, her slim white foot half concealed by the silken
toe of her slipper. And as he pulled a chair forward for himself,
her pretty black eyes, which slanted a little, took his measure
and divined trouble.</p>

<p>"Leila," he said, "why can't we have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A cigarette?" she interrupted, indicating her dainty case on
the table.</p>

<p>He took one, savagely aware of defiance somewhere. She lighted
her own from a candle and settled back, studying the sequence
of blue smoke-rings jetting upward to the ceiling.</p>

<p>"About this man Plank," he began, louder than he had intended
through sheer self-mistrust; and his wife made a quick, disdainful
sign of caution, which subdued his voice instantly. "Why can't
we take him up&mdash;together, Leila?" he ended lamely, furious at
his own uneasiness in a matter which might concern him vitally.</p>

<p>"I see no necessity of your taking him up," observed his wife
serenely. "I can do what may be useful to him in town."</p>

<p>"So can I. There are clubs where he ought to be seen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can manage such matters much better."</p>

<p>"You can't manage everything," he insisted sullenly. "There are
chances of various sorts&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Investments?" asked Mrs. Mortimer, with bright malice.</p>

<p>"See here, Leila, you have your own way too much. I say little;
I make damned few observations; but I could, if I cared to. …
It becomes you to be civil at least. I want to talk over this
Plank matter with you; I want you to listen, too."</p>

<p>A shade of faint disgust passed over her face. "I am listening,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I can see several ways in which the man can be of
use to me. … I discovered him before you did, anyway. And what
I want to do is to have a frank, honourable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<em>A&mdash;</em>what?"</p>

<p>" &mdash;An honourable understanding with you, I said," he repeated,
reddening.</p>

<p>"Oh!" She snapped her cigarette into the grate. "Oh! I see. And
what then?"</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, you and I can arrange to stand behind him this winter in
town, can't we?"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;damn it!&mdash;the beggar can show his gratitude, can't he?"</p>

<p>"How?" she asked listlessly.</p>

<p>"By making good. How else?" he retorted savagely. "He can't welch
because there's little to climb for beyond us; and even if he
climbs, he can't ignore us. I can do as many things for him in
my way as you can in yours. What is the use of being a pig, Leila?
Anything he does for me isn't going to cancel his obligations
to you."</p>

<p>"I know him better than you do," she observed, bending her head
and pleating the lace on her knee. "There is Dutch blood in him."</p>

<p>"Not good Hollander, but common Dutch," sneered Mortimer. "And
you mean he'll squeeze a dollar till the eagle screams-don't you?"</p>

<p>She sat silent, pleating her lace with steady fingers.</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right, too," laughed Mortimer easily; "let
the Audubon Society worry over the eagle. It's a perfectly plain
business proposition; we can do for him in a couple of winters
what he can't do for himself in ten. Figure it out for yourself,
Leila," he said, waving a mottled fat hand at her.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>have," she said under her breath.</p>

<p>"Then, is it settled?</p>

<p>"Settled&mdash;how?"</p>

<p>"That we form ourselves into a benevolent society of two in behalf
of Plank?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I don't want to, Roy," she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>She did not say why not, seated there nervously pleating the
fragile stuff clinging to her knee.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he repeated menacingly. Her unexpectedly quiescent
attitude had emboldened him to a bullying tone&mdash;something he had
not lately ventured on.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to his: "<em>I&mdash;</em>rather like him," she
said quietly.</p>

<p>"Then, by God! he'll pay for that!" he burst out, mask off, every
inflamed feature shockingly congested.</p>

<p>"Roy! You dare not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dare not!"</p>

<p>The palpitating silence lengthened; slowly the blood left the
swollen veins. Heavy pendulous lip hanging, he stared at her from
distended eyes, realising that he had forgotten himself. She was
right. He dared not. And she held the whip-hand as usual.</p>

<p>For every suspicion he could entertain, she had evidence of a
certainty to match it; for every chance that he might have to
prove anything, she had twenty proven facts. And he knew it. Why
they had, during all these years, made any outward pretence of
conjugal unity they alone knew. The modus vivendi suited them
better than divorce: that was apparent, or had been until recently.
Recently Leila Mortimer had changed&mdash;become subdued and softened
to a degree that had perplexed her husband. Her attitude toward
him lacked a little of the bitterness and contempt she usually
reserved for him in private; she had become more prudent, almost
cautious at times.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you one thing," he said with a sudden snarl: "You'd
better be careful there is no gossip about you and Plank."</p>

<p>She reddened under the insult.</p>

<p>"Now we'll see," he continued venomously, "how far you can go
alone."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," she asked calmly, "that I am afraid of a divorce
court?"</p>

<p>The question so frankly astonished him that he sat agape, unable
to reply. For years he had very naturally supposed her to be afraid
of it&mdash;afraid of not being qualified to obtain it. Indeed, he
had taken that for granted as the very corner-stone of their mutual
toleration. Had he been an ass to do so? A vague alarm took possession
of him; for, with that understanding, he had not been at all careful
of his own behaviour, neither had he been at any particular pains
to conceal his doings from her. His alarm increased. What had
he against her, after all, except ancient suspicions, now so confused
and indefinite that memory itself outlawed the case, if it ever
really existed. What had she against him? Facts&mdash;unless she was
more stupid than any of her sex he had ever encountered. And now,
this defiance, this increasing prudence, this subtle change in
her, began to make him anxious for the permanency of the small
income she had allowed him during all these years&mdash;doled out to
him, as he believed, though her dormant fear of him.</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" he said harshly.</p>

<p>"I believe I mentioned divorce."</p>

<p>"Well, cut it out! D'ye see? Cut it, I say. You'd stand as much
chance before a referee as a snowball in hell."</p>

<p>"There's no telling," she said coolly, "until one tries."</p>

<p>He glared at her, then burst into a laugh. "Rot!" he said thickly.
"Talk sense, Leila! And keep this hard-headed Dutchman for yourself,
if you feel that way about it. I don't want to butt in. I only
thought&mdash;for old times' sake&mdash;perhaps you'd&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good night," she managed to say, her disgust almost strangling
her.</p>

<p>And he went, furtively, heavy-footed, perplexed, inwardly cursing
his blunder in stirring up a sleeping lioness whom he had so long
mistaken for a dozing cat.</p>

<p>For hours he sat in his room, or paced the four walls, doubtful,
chagrined, furious by turns. Once he drew out a memorandum-book
and stood under a lighted sconce, studying the figures. His losses
at Shotover staggered him, but he had looked to his wife heretofore
in such emergencies.</p>

<p>Certainly the time had come for him to do something. But what?&mdash;if
his wife was going to strike such attitudes in the very face of
decency? Certainly a husband in these days was without honour
in his own household.</p>

<p>His uneasiness had produced a raging thirst. He punched an electric
button with his fleshy thumb, and prowled around, waiting. Nobody
came; he punched again, and looked at his watch. It astonished
him to find the hour was three o'clock in the morning. That discovery,
however, only appeared to increase his thirst. He opened the hall
door, prepared to descend into the depths of the house and raid
a sideboard; and as he thrust his heavy head out into the lighted
corridor his eyes fell upon two figures standing at the open door
of a bedroom. One was Siward; that was plain. Who was the girl
he had kissed? One of the maids? Somebody's wife? Who?</p>

<p>Every dull pulse began to hammer in Mortimer's head. In his excitement
he stepped half-way into the corridor, then skipped nimbly back,
closing his door without a sound.</p>

<p>"Sylvia Landis, by all that's holy!" he breathed to himself,
and sat down rather suddenly on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>After a while he rose and crept to the door, opened it, glued
his eyes to the crack, in time to catch a glimpse of Siward entering
his own corridor alone.</p>

<p>And that night, Mortimer, lying awake in bed, busy with schemes,
became conscious of a definite idea. It took shape and matured
so suddenly that it actually shocked his moral sense. Then it
scared him.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but that is blackmail!" he whispered aloud. "A man can't
do that sort of thing. What the devil ever put it into my head?
… And there are men I know&mdash;women, too&mdash;scoundrelly blackguards,
who'd use that information somehow; and make it pay, too. The
scoundrels!"</p>

<p>He squirmed down among the bedclothes with a sudden shiver; but
the night had turned warm.</p>

<p>"Scoundrels!" he said, with milder emphasis. "Blackmailers! Contemptible
pups!"</p>

<p>He fell asleep an hour later, muttering something incoherent
about scoundrels and blackmail.</p>

<p>And meanwhile, in the darkened house, from all round came the
noise of knocking on doors, sounds of people stirring&mdash;a low voice
here and there, lights breaking out from transoms, the thud of
rubber-shod heels, the rattle of cartridges from the echoing gun-room.
For the guests at Shotover were awaking, lest the wet sky, whitening
behind the east, ring with the whimpering wedges of wild-fowl
rushing seaward over empty blinds.</p>

<p>The unusual stillness of the house in the late morning sunshine
was pleasant to Miss Landis. She had risen very late, unconscious
of the stir and movement before dawn; and it was only when a maid
told her, as she came from her bath, that she remembered the projected
point-shooting, and concluded, with an odd, happy sense of relief,
that she was almost alone in the house.</p>

<p>A little later, glancing from her bedroom window for a fulfilment
of the promise of the sun which a glimpse of blue sky heralded,
she saw Leila Mortimer settling herself in the forward seat of
a Mercedes, and Beverly Plank climbing in beside her; and she
watched Plank steer the big machine across the wet lawn, while
the machinist swung himself into the tonneau; and away they rolled,
faster, faster, rushing out into the misty hinterland, where the
long streak of distant forest already began to brighten, edged
with the first rays of watery sunshine.</p>

<p>So she had the big house to herself&mdash;every bit of it and with
it freedom from obligation, from comment, from demand or exaction;
freedom from restraint; liberty to roam about, to read, to dream,
to idle, to remember! Ah, that was what she needed&mdash;a quiet interval
in this hurrying youth of hers to catch her breath once more,
and stand still, and look back a day or two and remember.</p>

<p>So, to breakfast all alone was delicious; to stroll, unhurried,
to the sideboard and leisurely choose among the fresh cool fruits;
to loiter over cream-jug and cereal; to saunter out into the freshness
of the world and breathe it, and feel the sun warming cheek and
throat, and the little breezes from a sunlit sea stirring the
bright strands of her hair.</p>

<p>In the increasing brilliancy of the sunshine she stretched out
her hands, warming them daintily as she might twist them before
the fire on the hearth. And here, at the fragrant hearth of the
world, she stood, sweet and fresh as the morning itself, untroubled
gaze intensely blue with the tint of the purple sea, sensitive
lips scarcely parting in the dreaming smile that made her eyes
more wonderful.</p>

<p>As the warmth grew on land and water, penetrating her body, a
faintly delicious glow responded in her heart,&mdash;nothing at first
wistful in the serene sense of well-being, stretching her rounded
arms skyward in the unaccustomed luxury of a liberty which had
become the naively unconscious licence of a child. The poise of
sheer health stretched her to tiptoe; then the graceful tension
relaxed, and her smooth fingers uncurled, tightened, and fell
limp as her arms fell and her superb young figure straightened,
confronting the sea.</p>

<p>Out over the rain-wet, odorous grass she picked her way, skirts
swung high above the delicate contour of ankle and limb, following
a little descending path she knew full of rocky angles, swept
by pendant sprays of blackberry, and then down under the jutting
rock, south through thickets of wild cherry along the crags, until,
before her the way opened downward again where a tiny crescent
beach glimmered white hot in the sun.</p>

<p>From his bedroom window Mortimer peeped forth, following her
progress with a leer.</p>

<p>As she descended, noticing the rifts of bronzing seaweed piled
along the tide mark, her foot dislodged a tiny triangle of rock,
which rolled clattering and ringing below; and as she sprang lightly
to the sand, a man, lying full length and motionless as the heaped
seaweed, raised himself on one arm, turning his sun-dazzled eyes
on her.</p>

<p>The dull shock of surprise halted her as Siward rose to his feet,
still dazed, the sand running from his brown shooting-clothes
over his tightly strapped puttees.</p>

<p>"Have you the faintest idea that I supposed you were here?" she
asked briefly. Then, frank in her disappointment, she looked up
at the cliffs overhead, where her line of retreat lay.</p>

<p>"Why did you not go with the others?" she added, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know. I will, if you wish." He had coloured
slowly, the frank disappointment in her face penetrating his surprise;
and now he turned around, instinctively, also looking for the
path of retreat.</p>

<p>"Wait," she said, aware of her own crude attitude and confused
by it; "wait a moment, Mr. Siward. I don't mean to drive you away."</p>

<p>"It's self-exile," he said quietly; "quite voluntary, I assure
you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward!"</p>

<p>And, as he looked up coolly, "Have you nothing more friendly
to say to me? Is your friendship for me so limited that my first
caprice oversteps the bounds? Must I always be in dread of wounding
you when I give you the privilege of knowing me better than anybody
ever knew me&mdash;of seeing me as I am, with all my faults, my failings,
my impulses, my real self? … I don't know why the pleasure of
being alone to-day should have meant exclusion for you, too. It
was the unwelcome shock of seeing anybody&mdash;a selfish enjoyment
of myself&mdash;that surprised me into rudeness. That is all. … Can
you not understand?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I meant no criticism&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Mr. Siward!" as he moved slowly toward the path. "You
force me to say other things, which you have no right to hear.
… After last night"&mdash;the vivid tint grew in her face&mdash;"after such
a night, is it not&mdash;natural&mdash;for a girl to creep off somewhere
by herself and try to think a little?"</p>

<p>He had turned full on her; the answering colour crept to his
forehead.</p>

<p>"Is that why?" he asked slowly.</p>

<p>"Is it not a reason?"</p>

<p>"It was my reason&mdash;for being here."</p>

<p>She bit her bright lip. This trend to the conversation was ominous,
and she had meant to do her drifting alone in still sun-dreams,
fearing no witness, no testimony, no judgment save her own self
in court with herself.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I suppose you cannot go&mdash;now," she reflected innocently.</p>

<p>"Indeed I can, and must."</p>

<p>"And leave me here to dig in the sand with my heels? Merci!"</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I certainly do, Mr. Siward. I don't want to dream, now; I don't
care to reflect. I did, but here you come blundering into my private
world and upset my calculations and change my intentions! It's
a shame, especially as you've been lying here doing what I wished
to do for goodness knows how long!"</p>

<p>"I'm going," he said, looking at her curiously.</p>

<p>"Then you are very selfish, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"We will call it that," he said with an odd laugh.</p>

<p>"Very well." She seated herself on the sand and calmly shook
out her skirts.</p>

<p>"About what time would you like to be called?" he asked smilingly.</p>

<p>"Thank you, I shall do no sun-dreaming."</p>

<p>"Please. It is good for you."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't good at all. And I am grateful to you for waking
me," she retorted with a sudden gay malice that subdued him. And
she, delicate nose in the air, laughingly watching him, went on
with her punishment: "You see what you've done, don't you?&mdash;saved
me from an entire morning wasted in sentimental reverie over what
might have been. Now you can appreciate it, can't you?&mdash;your wisdom
in appearing in the flesh to save a silly girl the effort of evoking
you in the spirit! Ah, Mr. Siward, I am vastly obliged to you!
Pray sit here beside me in the flesh, for fear that in your absence
I might commit the folly that tempted me here."</p>

<p>His low running laughter accompanying her voice had stimulated
her to a gay audacity, which for the instant extinguished in her
the little fear of him she had been barely conscious of.</p>

<p>"Do you know," he said, "that you also aroused me from my sun-dreams?"</p>

<p>"Did I? And can't you resume them?"</p>

<p>"You save me the necessity."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is a second-hand compliment," she said disdainfully&mdash;"a
weak plagiarism on what I conveyed very wittily. You were probably
really asleep, and dreaming of bird-murder."</p>

<p>He waited for her to finish, then, amused eyes searching, he
roamed about until high on a little drifted sand dune he found
a place for himself; and while she watched him indignantly, he
curled up in the sunshine, and, dropping his head on the hot sand,
calmly closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Upon&mdash;my word!" she breathed aloud.</p>

<p>He unclosed his eyes. "Now you may dream; you can't avoid it,"
he observed lazily, and closed his eyes; and neither taunts nor
jeers nor questions, nor fragments of shells flung with intent
to hit, stirred him from his immobility.</p>

<p>She tired of the attempt presently, and sat silent, elbows on
her thighs, hands propping her chin. Thoughts, vague as the fitful
breeze, arose, lingered, and, like the breeze, faded, dissolved
into calm, through which, cadenced by the far beat of the ebb
tide, her heart echoed, beating the steady intervals of time.</p>

<p>She had not meant to dream, but as she sat there, the fine-spun
golden threads flying from the whirling loom of dreams floated
about her, settling over her, entangling her in unseen meshes,
so that she stirred, groping amid the netted brightness, drawn
onward along dim paths and through corridors of thought where,
always beyond, vague splendours seemed to beckon.</p>

<p>Now lost, now restless, conscious of the perils of the shining
path she followed, the rhythm of an ocean soothing her to false
security, she dreamed on awake, unconscious of the tinted sea
and sky which stained her eyes to hues ineffable. A long while
afterward a small cloud floated across the sun; and, in the sudden
shadow on the world, doubt sounded its tiny voice, and her ears
listened, and the enchantment faded and died away.</p>

<p>Turning, she looked across the sand at the man lying there; her
eyes considered him&mdash;how long she did not know, she did not heed&mdash;until,
stirring, he looked up; and she paled a trifle and closed her
eyes, stunned by the sudden clamour of pulse and heart.</p>

<p>When he rose and walked over, she looked up gravely, pouring
the last handful of white sand through her stretched fingers.</p>

<p>"Did you dream?" he asked lightly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you dream true?"</p>

<p>"Nothing of my dream can happen," she said. "You know that, …
don't you?"</p>

<p>"I know that we love … and that we dare not ignore it."</p>

<p>She suffered his arm about her, his eyes looking deeply into
hers&mdash;a close, sweet caress, a union of lips, and her dimmed eyes'
response.</p>

<p>"Stephen," she faltered, "how can you make it so hard for me?
How can you force me to this shame!"</p>

<p>"Shame?" he repeated vaguely.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;this treachery to myself&mdash;when I cannot hope to be more
to you&mdash;when I dare not love you too much!"</p>

<p>"You must dare, Sylvia!"</p>

<p>"No, no, no! I know myself, I tell you. I cannot give up what
is offered&mdash;for you!&mdash;dearly, dearly as I do love you!" She turned
and caught his hands in hers, flushed, trembling, unstrung. "I
cannot &mdash;I simply cannot! How can you love me and listen
to such wickedness? How can you still care for such a girl as
I am&mdash;worse than mercenary, because I have a heart&mdash;or had, until
you took it! Keep it; it is the only part of me not all ignoble."</p>

<p>"I will keep it&mdash;in trust," he said, "until you give yourself
with it."</p>

<p>But she only shook her head wearily, withdrawing her hands from
his, and for a time they sat silent, eyes apart.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;"There is another reason," she said wistfully.</p>

<p>He looked up at her, hesitated, and&mdash;"My habits?" he asked simply.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I have them in check."</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;certain?"</p>

<p>"I think I may be&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"Yet," she said timidly, "you lost one fight&mdash;since you knew
me."</p>

<p>The dull red mantling his face wrung her heart. She turned impulsively
and laid both hands on his shoulders. "That chance I would take,
with all its uncertainty, all the dread inheritance you have come
into. I love you enough for that; and if it turned out that&mdash;that
you could not stem the tide, even with me to face it with you;
and if the pity of it, the grief of it, killed me, I would take
that chance&mdash;if you loved me through it all. … But there is something
else. Hush; let me have my say while I find the words&mdash;something
else you do not understand. … Turn your face a little; please
don't look at me. This is what you do not know&mdash;that, in three
generations, every woman of my race has&mdash;gone wrong. … Every one!
and I am beginning&mdash;with such a marriage! … deliberately, selfishly,
shamelessly, perfectly conscious of the frivolous, erratic blood
in me, aware of the race record behind me.</p>

<p>"Once, when I knew nothing&mdash;before <em>I&mdash;I </em>met you &mdash;I
believed such a marriage would not only permit me mental tranquillity,
but safely anchor me in the harbour of convention, leaving me
free to become what I am fashioned to become&mdash;autocrat and arbiter
in my own world. And now! and now! I don't know&mdash;truly I don't
know what I may become. Your love forces my hand. I am displaying
all the shallowness, falseness, pettiness, all the mean, and cruel
and callous character which must be truly my real self. … Only
I shall not marry you! You are not to run the risk of what I might
prove to be when I remember in bitterness all I have renounced.
If I married you I should remember, unreconciled, what you cost
me. Better for you and for me that I marry him, and let him bear
with me when I remember that he cost me you!"</p>

<p>She bent over, almost double, closing her eyes with small clenched
hands; and he saw the ring shimmering in the sunshine, and her
hair, heavily, densely gold, and the white nape of her neck, and
the tiny close-set ears, and the curved softness of cheek and
chin; every smooth, childlike contour and mould&mdash;rounded arms,
slim, flowing lines of body and limb&mdash;all valued at many millions
by her as her own appraiser.</p>

<p>Suddenly, deep within him, something seemed to fail, die out&mdash;perhaps
a tiny newly lighted flame of unaccustomed purity, the dawning
flicker of aspiration to better things. Whatever it was, material,
spiritual, was gone now, and where it had glimmered for a night,
the old accustomed twilit doubt crept in&mdash;the same dull acquiescence&mdash;the
same uncertainty of self, the familiar lack of will, of incentive,
the congenial tendency to drift; and with it came weariness&mdash;perhaps
reaction from the recent skirmishes with that master-vice.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said in a dull voice, "you are right."</p>

<p>"No, I am wrong&mdash;wrong!" she said, lifting her lovely face and
heavy eyes. "But I have chosen my path. … And you will forget."</p>

<p>"I hope so," he said simply.</p>

<p>"If you hope so, you will."</p>

<p>He nodded, unconvinced, watching a flock of sand-pipers whirling
into the cove like a gray snow-squall and fearlessly settling
on the beach.</p>

<p>After a while, with a long breath: "Then it is settled," she
concluded.</p>

<p>If she expected corroboration from him she received none; and
perhaps she was not awaiting it. She sat very still, her eyes
lost in thought.</p>

<p>And Mortimer, peeping down at them over the thicket above, yawned
impatiently and glanced about him for the most convenient avenue
of self-effacement when the time arrived.</p>
