<p>MRS. LADYBUG was determined to know the truth about Mr. P. Bug, the
newcomer. And as soon as she had fully recovered from the rude blow that
Peppery Polly Bumblebee dealt her, she set out for Farmer Green's garden
and the potato patch.
</p>
<p>For some time Mrs. Ladybug flew back and forth above the potato vines.
It was not an easy matter to find so small a person as Mr. Bug in so big
a field. But she discovered him at last. And she was somewhat surprised
to see him still in his elegant yellow coat, with the black stripes.
For Mrs. Ladybug had expected him to be hard at work, in overalls.
</p><p>To be sure, Mr. P. Bug did appear to be busy about something or other.
He was so busy that he scarcely so much as glanced at Mrs. Ladybug when
she spoke to him, mumbling "Good morning!" in answer to her greeting,
but not taking the trouble to doff his cap.
</p><p>"He's at work anyhow," thought Mrs. Ladybug. "He's helping Farmer
Green." Then she alighted on the potato vine where Mr. Bug was clinging.
</p><p>"Don't you remember me?" she asked.
</p><p>He shook his head. His mouth seemed to be full of something--Mrs.
Ladybug wasn't sure what.
</p><p>"Don't you recall speaking to me one time?" she persisted.
</p><p>After swallowing, he answered.
</p><p>"I can't say I do!"
</p><p>"I'm the person that told you how to get to this potato patch," Mrs.
Ladybug explained. "When you met me in the orchard, on your way from
Colorado, you stopped and asked me to direct you to Farmer Green's
potato patch."
</p><p>For a moment or two Mr. Bug seemed puzzled--especially when Mrs. Ladybug
mentioned Colorado. But by the time Mrs. Ladybug had finished speaking,
he nodded.
</p><p>"So I did!" he exclaimed. "I had forgotten all about that. Though now
that you speak of it, I do remember meeting a very talkative dame
dressed in a polka dot. Possibly I spoke to you about my settling in the
potato patch for the summer?"
</p><p>"No!" said Mrs. Ladybug. "But I thought I'd find you here. You seemed in
a great hurry to reach this place."
</p><p>"So I was!" said Mr. P. Bug. "And I'm glad I came. This is the finest
potato patch in the whole valley--so I have been told."
</p><p>"You must have seen a good many others on your journey from Colorado,"
Mrs. Ladybug ventured. "It's a long way from there to here, I suppose."
</p><p>"I suppose it is," Mr. P. Bug murmured. He seemed to be a bit impatient,
as if he were in haste to return to his work and didn't care to talk any
longer.
</p><p>"I suppose you were weeks on the road," Mrs. Ladybug went on. "Are you
going back to Colorado after you've finished helping Farmer Green with
the potato crop?"
</p><p>"Colorado!" he blurted. "I don't know where that place is. I've never
been there in all my life."
