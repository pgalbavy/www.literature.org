<p>Clematis frowned and sneezed as the infinitesimal particles of
sachet powder settled in the lining of his nose. He became serious,
and was conscious of a growing feeling of dislike; he began to
be upset over the whole matter. But his conscience compelled him
to persist in his attempt to solve the mystery; and also he remembered
that one should be courteous, no matter what some other thing
chooses to be. Hence he sought to place his nose in contact with
Flopit's, for he had perceived on the front of the mysterious
stranger a buttony something which might possibly be a nose.</p>

<p>Flopit evaded the contact. He felt that he had endured about
enough from this Apache, and that it was nearly time to destroy
him. Having no experience of battle, save with bedroom slippers
and lace handkerchiefs, Flopit had little doubt of his powers
as a warrior. Betrayed by his majestic self-importance, he had
not the remotest idea that he was small. Usually he saw the world
from a window, or from the seat of an automobile, or over his
mistress's arm. He looked down on all dogs, thought them ruffianly,
despised them; and it is the miraculous truth that not only was
he unaware that he was small, but he did not even know that he
was a dog, himself. He did not think about himself in that way.</p>

<p>From these various ignorances of his sprang his astonishing,
his incredible, valor. Clematis, with head lowered close to Flopit's,
perceived something peering at him from beneath the tangled curtain
of cottony, violet-scented stuff which seemed to be the upper
part of Flopit's face. It was Flopit's eye, a red-rimmed eye and
sore&mdash;and so demoniacally malignant that Clematis, indescribably
startled, would have withdrawn his own countenance at once&mdash;but
it was too late. With a fearful oath Flopit sprang upward and
annexed himself to the under lip of the horrified Clematis.</p>

<p>Horror gave place to indignation instantly; and as Miss Parcher
and her guest turned, screaming, Clematis's self-command went
all to pieces.</p>

<p>Miss Parcher became faint and leaned against the hedge along
which they had been passing, but her visitor continued to scream,
while Mr. Watson endeavored to kick Clematis without ruining Flopit&mdash;a
difficult matter.</p>

<p>Flopit was baresark from the first, and the mystery is where
he learned the dog-cursing that he did. In spite of the David-and-Goliath
difference in size it would be less than justice to deny that
a very fair dog-fight took place. It was so animated, in truth,
that the one expert in such matters who was present found himself
warmly interested. Genesis relieved himself of the burden of the
wash-tub upon his back, dropped the handle of that other in which
he had a half-interest, and watched the combat; his mouth, like
his eyes, wide open in simple pleasure.</p>

<p>He was not destined to enjoy the spectacle to the uttermost;
a furious young person struck him a frantic, though harmless,
blow with a pink parasol.</p>

<p>"You stop them!" she screamed. "You make that horrible dog stop,
or I'll have you arrested!"</p>

<p>Genesis rushed forward.</p>

<p>"You <em>CLEM!" </em>he shouted.</p>

<p>And instantly Clematis was but a whitish and brownish streak
along the hedge. He ran like a dog in a moving picture when they
speed the film, and he shot from sight, once more, round the corner,
while Flopit, still cursing, was seized and squeezed in his mistress's
embrace.</p>

<p>But she was not satisfied. "Where's that laundryman with the
tin thing on his head?" she demanded. "He ought to be arrested
for having such a dog. It's <em>HIS </em>dog, isn't it? Where
is he?"</p>

<p>Genesis turned and looked round about the horizon, mystified.
William Sylvanus Baxter and the clothes-boiler had disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>"If he owns that dog," asserted the still furious owner of Flopit,
"I <em>WILL </em>have him arrested. Where is he? Where is that
laundryman?"</p>

<p>"Why, he," Genesis began slowly, "HE ain' no laundrym&mdash;" He came
to an uncertain pause. If she chose to assume, with quick feminine
intuition, that the dog was William's and that William was a laundryman,
it was not Genesis's place to enlighten her. "'Tic'larly," he
reflected, "since she talk so free about gittin' people 'rested!"
He became aware that William had squirmed through the hedge and
now lay prostrate on the other side of it, but this, likewise,
was something within neither his duty nor his inclination to reveal.</p>

<p>"Thishere laundryman," said Genesis, resuming&mdash;"thishere laundryman
what own the dog, I reckon he mus' hopped on 'at street-car what
went by."</p>

<p>"Well, he <em>OUGHT </em>to be arrested!" she said, and, pressing
her cheek to Flopit's, she changed her tone. "Izzum's ickle heart
a-beatin' so floppity! Um's own mumsy make ums all right, um's
p'eshus Flopit!"</p>

<p>Then with the consoling Miss Parcher's arm about her, and Mr.
Watson even more dazzled with love than when he had first met
her, some three hours past, she made her way between the tubs,
and passed on down the street. Not till the three (and Flopit)
were out of sight did William come forth from the hedge.</p>

<p>"Hi yah!" exclaimed Genesis. "'At lady go'n a 'rest ev'y man
what own a dog, 'f she had her way!"</p>

<p>But William spoke no word.</p>

<p>In silence, then, they resumed their burdens and their journey.
Clematis was waiting for them at the corner ahead.</p>
