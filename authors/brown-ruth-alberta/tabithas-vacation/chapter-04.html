<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Tabitha retired late that night, weary but triumphant, congratulating
herself that Billiard was conquered; but she had reckoned without
her host.  Two little heathen such as Williard and Theodore McKittrick
are not to be converted in one day, nor are they apt to be forced
into reforming.  Brought up with utter disregard for other people's
rights, by a mother who bore them no particular love, but who
surrounded them with every luxury money could buy simply because
she found it less trouble to indulge than to deny them, it is
scarcely to be wondered at that they had no idea of honor or obedience.</p>

<p>Their father, Dennis McKittrick, had been more successful than
his brothers in his struggle for wealth.  After amassing a comfortable
fortune, he had not lived to enjoy it, and before his oldest son
had seen his sixth birthday, the father was laid to rest in the
shadow of a resplendent monument in an Eastern cemetery; and the
rearing of the two boys was left wholly to their fashion-plate
mother, whose only gods were dress and personal pleasure.  Tabitha
had heard many stories of the selfish, heartless woman, who found
her motherhood a burden rather than a blessing, but she did not
understand the difficulties one must contend with in attempting
to reform such lawless youths, and being little more than a child
herself, it was only natural that she should make mistakes.</p>

<p>But she did not at once realize this fact, for Billiard, completely
surprised by the unusual treatment accorded him, was a model of
obedience and politeness for the next two days, and Tabitha was
deceived into thinking his reformation was genuine and lasting;
while in reality, the young scapegrace was merely studying the
unique situation and plotting how to "get even" with the girl
who already had mastered him twice.  A coward at heart, he knew
he could not come out openly and fight her, so he slyly planned
little annoyances to hinder her work and try her patience.  Yet
so adroitly did he manoeuvre that Tabitha was some time in finding
out the real culprit.</p>

<p>"My brefus food ain't nice," wailed Janie, the third morning
of her cousins' stay.</p>

<p>"Nor mine, either," protested Rosslyn, tasting his critically,
and wrinkling his nose in disgust.</p>

<p>"You've salted it something fierce," said Billiard, winking solemnly
at Toady while Tabitha was busy sampling her dish of porridge.</p>

<p>"It's so salt that sugar doesn't sweeten it," added Susie, making
a wry face at the first mouthful and taking a hasty swallow of
water.</p>

<p>Tabitha's mystified face quickly cleared.  Seizing the sugar-bowl,
she cautiously tasted its contents, and turning toward Inez, said
accusingly, "You filled it with salt instead of sugar!"</p>

<p>"Then someone put the salt cup in the sugar barrel," cried Inez
indignantly, "'cause I just poured one cupful into the sugar-bowl."</p>

<p>"Well, be more careful the next time," admonished the black-eyed
girl, retreating to the pantry for a fresh supply of sweetening;
and Billiard, elated at the success of his first attempt, determined
to try again.</p>

<p>"What in the world did you put in that salad dressing, Glory?"
cried Tabitha, snatching up her glass of water with eager hands.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" demanded the second cook, whose
turn it was to wait upon the table that day.</p>

<p>"You used ginger 'stead of mustard," scolded Toady, who had a
particular aversion for red hair, and took little pains to conceal
it.</p>

<p>Gloriana had her suspicions as to how such an accident could
have happened, but a hurried visit to the pantry disclosed the
spice cans in their proper places, all correctly labelled; so
she reluctantly admitted her mistake, but decided to keep her
eyes open.</p>

<p>"There's soap in my glass of water," complained Irene at the
next meal.</p>

<p>"Soap!" echoed Mercedes.  "I washed those glasses myself, and
never used a bit of soap on them!  That's the way mamma told us
to wash them."</p>

<p>But the fact still remained that not only was Irene's glass soapy,
but more than half the dishes on the table tasted of Fels Naptha. 
Tabitha looked concerned, but Billiard and Toady were so innocent
appearing that she never suspected them of having had a hand in
the affair.</p>

<p>The next time it was Tabitha's biscuits.  When they appeared
on the table they were as thin as wafers and as hard as bricks. 
In some way she had substituted corn starch for baking powder;
but as another hurried visit to the pantry showed both articles
where they belonged on their respective shelves, she concluded
that carelessness on her part had caused the trouble, and let
the matter drop.</p>

<p>Then the house began to be infested with all sorts of obnoxious
insects and reptiles.  Mercedes found two huge grasshoppers in
the soup one day; a long, wriggling centipede fell out of the
cook-book as Tabitha turned its pages in search of a favorite
recipe; a scorpion dropped off the cake plate which Gloriana was
in the act of passing, so frightening the girl that she dashed
cake, dish and all onto the floor, and promptly had hysterics. 
Horned toads, ugly lizards, and worms of every description made
their appearance by the dozen, until even Tabitha grew alarmed;
but still she did not suspect the cause of such an invasion, as
the two brothers were apparently as docile and obedient as their
gentler cousins.</p>

<p>Even when they found a dead rattler coiled up in the middle of
the kitchen floor, Tabitha attributed it to Carrie's dog, General,
who still spent much of his time at the McKittrick cottage.  Nor
did she notice that the reptile was coiled in a most impossible
manner, with its head propped up by two tiny wires.  She merely
hustled the thing out of doors, hacked it into pieces with the
axe, and buried the remnants under a pile of rocks to make sure
no harm came of them.  It never occurred to her to wonder how
General, who was not allowed in the house, could have dragged
the snake inside without someone seeing or hearing him, for he
was proud of his snake-killing accomplishment and always made
a big commotion when he succeeded in trapping one.  So the culprits
enjoyed the girls' scare, and retired to the water-tank behind
the assayer's office to hatch up some new scheme.</p>

<p>Only Gloriana, whose cordial dislike for boys, caused by her
unhappy experiences in Manchester, made her suspicious of all
that species of humanity, seemed aware of what was going on, but
she could not catch them red-handed.  And knowing that she suspected
them, the brothers made life miserable for her in a hundred ways. 
They hid her crutch in the most out-of-way places, adroitly misplaced
her cooking utensils, or whatever article she was about to use,
causing her many a long and annoying search when she was in a
hurry.  They stopped the clock or set it ahead with aggravating
frequency; and discovering that the plucky girl grimly bore their
tormenting in silence, they grew bolder, jumping out at her from
unexpected corners, tweaking her long braids, tripping her up,
and calling her "Carrots," or "Red-top," when Tabitha was out
of hearing, for they still entertained a wholesome fear of that
strong-armed, hot-tempered little housekeeper, who demanded instant
obedience from her charges, and was able to enforce her authority
by main strength if necessary.</p>

<p>Also, they felt a certain boyish admiration for the tall, lithe
girl who bore such a record for bravery, though not for the world
would they have admitted the fact, even to each other; and they
could not resist plaguing her on the sly whenever a chance presented
itself.  But to tease her openly was out of the question; so Gloriana
received a double share of tormenting, which she bore with such
uncomplaining fortitude that the boys forgot to be cautious, and
one afternoon while Tabitha was in town on an errand, Mercedes
came upon them as they were limping about the kitchen in an exaggerated
fashion chanting with tuneless voices,</p>

<p>  "Baa-baa, black sheep, have you any wool?   Yes, sir, yes,
sir, three bags full;   One for the master, one for the dame,  
And one for the 'gory head' who limps awful lame."</p>

<p>Tears were standing in the tired gray eyes, but Gloriana, with
her back resolutely turned toward her tormentors, scrubbed her
pan of vegetables more vigorously, and tried not to hear the taunting
words, though she knew from the sound of their steps that the
boys were circling nearer and ever nearer, and would soon jerk
off her hair-ribbon or poke her in the back.</p>

<p>"Cowards!" exploded Mercedes wrathfully.  "You'd never dare do
that if Tabitha was here!  I'm going to tell her just how mean
you are!"</p>

<p>"Tattletale, tattletale!" jeered Billiard, taking a rapid survey
of the yard as he limped past the door, to see if the other housekeeper
had by any chance returned from the post-office.</p>

<p>"You wait and see what you get when Tabby finds out what you
have been doing," threatened the girl; and the little name slipping
inadvertently from her tongue gave the boys another inspiration.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Tabby Catt, Tabby Catt," they began in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unison, "where have you been?<br/>
I've been to Silver Bow to buy me a bean.<br/>
Tabby Catt, Tabby Catt, what saw you there?<br/>
I saw 'Gory Hanner' with her fearful red hair."

</p>
</div>
<p>So intent were they upon rendering their new song, that neither
boy heard the screen open and close softly behind him, but Mercedes
caught a glimpse of the set, white face and flashing eyes through
the doorway, and held her breath in mingled fear and expectation.</p>

<p>"Billy goat, Billy goat, where have you been?" a low, ominous
voice interrupted; and the two tormentors came to an abrupt halt
in the middle of the floor, paralyzed at the unexpected appearance
of the black-haired girl.</p>

<p>"A-chewing the whiskers, that grow under my chin," the voice
calmly finished, and seizing the pan of dirty water from which
Gloriana had just rescued the last potato, Tabitha dashed its
contents over the astonished duet.  Then realizing that once more
she had let go of her fiery temper, she fled from the house up
the trail to a great boulder on the summit of the mountain, and
threw herself face down in an abandon of shame, remorse and despair.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, why can't I be good?" she sobbed.  "Just when I think
I can hold onto myself and be ladylike no matter how mad I get,
something comes up to show me that I'm mistaken.  I'm just as
hateful as Billiard!  Oh, dear!  And I thought he was being so
good, and all the while he was doing mean things behind my back. 
I make a miserable fizzle of everything I undertake.  What would
Mrs. McKittrick say if she could have seen me a few minutes ago? 
Now I've lost all the hold I had on the boys.  They can't respect
anyone who doesn't control her temper any better than I.</p>

<p>"How I wish I had never offered to take care of the tribe of
McKittrick!  No, that isn't so, either, for then the mother couldn't
have gone inside with Mr. McKittrick, and perhaps the operation
would have killed him.  I'm glad he had his chance, bad boys or
no bad boys! But oh, I am so thankful that Miss Davis will soon
be home.  I will never play housekeeper again, never!  But now,&mdash;how
can I make it right with Billiard and Toady?  What a world this
is to live in!  Always stepping on someone's toes and then having
to beg pardon.  The trouble of it is I &mdash;I don't believe
I am very sorry that I doused the boys.  I am sorry I got so mad
and did such a hateful thing, of course, but they deserved more
than they got.  And yet they aren't to blame, either, after the
bringing up they have had.  I suppose&mdash;it's up to me&mdash;to do the
apologizing act&mdash;myself&mdash;this trip."</p>

<p>Drying her eyes and taking a firm grip on herself, she descended
from her refuge and sought out the boys in their room.</p>

<p>"Come in," Billiard called gruffly in response to her knock,
though inwardly he was quaking with fear lest it might be the
sheriff or Uncle Hogan, whose authority he had never but once
dared to defy.  So he was visibly relieved when he saw Tabitha
standing alone on the threshold, but waited uncertainly for her
to state her errand.</p>

<p>She was as anxious as they to have the ordeal over with, and
plunged into the middle of her carefully framed speech, saying
briefly, "I came to ask your pardon for my rudeness of a few minutes
ago.  I forgot myself.  It was wrong of me to speak and act as
I did, no matter how great the provocation."</p>

<p>Her wandering gaze suddenly fell upon Billiard's face, just in
time to see him wink wickedly at Toady, and her good resolutions
abruptly took wing.  "But you deserved every bit you got," she
finished fiercely, "and the next time I'll <em>souse you in the
rain barrel</em>!"</p>

<p>Slamming the door in their surprised faces, she marched majestically
away to the kitchen, and furiously began beating up a cake, so
chagrined over this new defeat of her plans that she could not
keep the tears from her eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a meek voice at her elbow spoke hesitatingly, "Say,
Tabitha, we've apologized to Gory Anne &mdash;Gloriana, I mean. 
Will you&mdash;excuse&mdash;me for what we said about you, too?"</p>

<p>Toady's big, beseeching, brown eyes met hers unflinchingly&mdash;he
certainly knew how to look angelic when occasion demanded it&mdash;and
Tabitha relented.</p>

<p>"Yes, Toady, I'll excuse <em>you</em>," she said with meaning
emphasis, which was not lost on the older brother, keeping well
in the background.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I'm ready to be excused, too," Billiard gulped at length,
shuffling forward a few steps, but not raising his eyes from the
floor.</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered coldly.  "But don't you dare bother
Gloriana again.  I won't stand for it!"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," Billiard responded meekly; and the two boys made
good their escape, feeling very virtuous indeed.</p>
