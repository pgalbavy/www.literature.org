When Doctor Walker had departed, the Admiral packed
all his possessions back into his sea chest with the
exception of one little brass-bound desk.  This he
unlocked, and took from it a dozen or so blue sheets of
paper all mottled over with stamps and seals, with very
large V.  R.'s printed upon the heads of them.  He tied
these carefully into a small bundle, and placing them in
the inner pocket of his coat, he seized his stick and
hat.
<P>
"Oh, John, don't do this rash thing," cried Mrs.
Denver, laying her hands upon his sleeve.  "I have seen
so little of you, John.  Only three years since you left
the service.  Don't leave me again.  I know it is weak of
me, but I cannot bear it."
<P>
"There's my own brave lass," said he, smoothing down
the grey-shot hair.  "We've lived in honor together,
mother, and please God in honor we'll die.  No matter how
debts are made, they have got to be met, and what the boy
owes we owe.  He has not the money, and how is he to find
it?  He can't find it.  What then?  It becomes my
business, and there's only one way for it."
<P>
"But it may not be so very bad, John.  Had we not
best wait until after he sees these people to-morrow?"
<P>
"They may give him little time, lass.  But I'll have
a care that I don't go so far that I can't put back
again.  Now, mother, there's no use holding me.  It's got
to be done, and there's no sense in shirking it."  He
detached her fingers from his sleeve, pushed her gently
back into an arm-chair, and hurried from the house.
<P>
In less than half an hour the Admiral was whirled
into Victoria Station and found himself amid a dense
bustling throng, who jostled and pushed in the crowded
terminus.  His errand, which had seemed feasible enough
in his own room, began now to present difficulties in the
carrying out, and he puzzled over how he should take the
first steps.  Amid the stream of business men, each
hurrying on his definite way, the old seaman in his grey
tweed suit and black soft hat strode slowly along, his
head sunk and his brow wrinkled in perplexity.  Suddenly
an idea occurred to him.  He walked back to the railway
stall and bought a daily paper.  This he turned and
turned until a certain column met his eye, when he
smoothed it out, and carrying it over to a seat,
proceeded to read it at his leisure.
<P>
And, indeed, as a man read that column, it
seemed strange to him that there should still remain
any one in this world of ours who should be in straits
for want of money.  Here were whole lines of gentlemen
who were burdened with a surplus in their incomes, and
who were loudly calling to the poor and needy to come and
take it off their hands.  Here was the guileless person
who was not a professional moneylender, but who would be
glad to correspond, etc.  Here too was the accommodating
individual who advanced sums from ten to ten thousand
pounds without expense, security, or delay.  "The money
actually paid over within a few hours," ran this
fascinating advertisement, conjuring up a vision of swift
messengers rushing with bags of gold to the aid of the
poor struggler.  A third gentleman did all business by
personal application, advanced money on anything or
nothing; the lightest and airiest promise was enough to
content him according to his circular, and finally he
never asked for more than five per cent.  This struck the
Admiral as far the most promising, and his wrinkles
relaxed, and his frown softened away as he gazed at it. 
He folded up the paper rose from the seat, and found
himself face to face with Charles Westmacott.
<P>
"Hullo, Admiral!"
<P>
"Hullo, Westmacott!" Charles had always been a
favorite of the seaman's.  "What are you doing here?"
<P>
"Oh, I have been doing a little business for my aunt. 
But I have never seen you in London before."
<P>
"I hate the place.  It smothers me.  There's not a
breath of clean air on this side of Greenwich.  But maybe
you know your way about pretty well in the City?"
<P>
"Well, I know something about it.  You see I've never
lived very far from it, and I do a good deal of my aunt's
business."
<P>
"Maybe you know Bread Street?"
<P>
"It is out of Cheapside."
<P>
"Well then, how do you steer for it from here?  You
make me out a course and I'll keep to it."
<P>
"Why, Admiral, I have nothing to do.  I'll take you
there with pleasure."
<P>
"Will you, though?  Well, I'd take it very kindly if
you would.  I have business there.  Smith and Hanbury,
financial agents, Bread Street."
<P>
The pair made their way to the river-side, and so
down the Thames to St. Paul's landing--a mode of travel
which was much more to the Admiral's taste than 'bus or
cab.  On the way, he told his companion his mission and
the causes which had led to it.  Charles Westmacott knew
little enough of City life and the ways of business, but
at least he had more experience in both than the Admiral,
and he made up his mind not to leave him until the
matter was settled.
<P>
"These are the people," said the Admiral, twisting
round his paper, and pointing to the advertisement which
had seemed to him the most promising.  "It sounds honest
and above-board, does it not?  The personal interview
looks as if there were no trickery, and then no one could
object to five per cent."
<P>
"No, it seems fair enough."
<P>
"It is not pleasant to have to go hat in hand
borrowing money, but there are times, as you may find
before you are my age, Westmacott, when a man must stow
away his pride.  But here's their number, and their plate
is on the corner of the door."
<P>
A narrow entrance was flanked on either side by a row
of brasses, ranging upwards from the shipbrokers and the
solicitors who occupied the ground floors, through a long
succession of West Indian agents, architects, surveyors,
and brokers, to the firm of which they were in quest.  A
winding stone stair, well carpeted and railed at first
but growing shabbier with every landing, brought them
past innumerable doors until, at last, just under the
ground-glass roofing, the names of Smith and Hanbury were
to be seen painted in large white letters across a panel,
with a laconic invitation to push beneath it.  Following
out the suggestion, the Admiral and his companion
found themselves in a dingy apartment, ill lit from a
couple of glazed windows.  An ink-stained table, littered
with pens, papers, and almanacs, an American cloth sofa,
three chairs of varying patterns, and a much-worn carpet,
constituted all the furniture, save only a very large and
obtrusive porcelain spittoon, and a gaudily framed and
very somber picture which hung above the fireplace. 
Sitting in front of this picture, and staring gloomily at
it, as being the only thing which he could stare at, was
a small sallow-faced boy with a large head, who in the
intervals of his art studies munched sedately at an
apple.
<P>
"Is Mr. Smith or Mr. Hanbury in?" asked the Admiral.
<P>
"There ain't no such people," said the small boy.
<P>
"But you have the names on the door."
<P>
"Ah, that is the name of the firm, you see.  It's
only a name.  It's Mr. Reuben Metaxa that you wants."
<P>
"Well then, is he in?"
<P>
"No, he's not."
<P>
"When will he be back?"
<P>
"Can't tell, I'm sure.  He's gone to lunch. 
Sometimes he takes one hour, and sometimes two.  It'll be
two to-day, I 'spect, for he said he was hungry afore he
went."
<P>
"Then I suppose that we had better call again, " said
the Admiral.
<P>
"Not a bit," cried Charles.  "I know how to manage
these little imps.  See here, you young varmint, here's
a shilling for you.  Run off and fetch your master.  If
you don't bring him here in five minutes I'll clump you
on the side of the head when you get back.  Shoo!  Scat!" 
He charged at the youth, who bolted from the room and
clattered madly down-stairs.
<P>
"He'll fetch him," said Charles.  "Let us make
ourselves at home.  This sofa does not feel over and
above safe.  It was not meant for fifteen-stone men. 
But this doesn't look quite the sort of place where one
would expect to pick up money."
<P>
"Just what I was thinking," said the Admiral, looking
ruefully about him.
<P>
"Ah, well!  I have heard that the best furnished
offices generally belong to the poorest firms.   Let us
hope it's the opposite here.  They can't spend much on
the management anyhow.  That pumpkin-headed boy was the
staff, I suppose.  Ha, by Jove, that's his voice, and
he's got our man, I think!"
<P>
As he spoke the youth appeared in the doorway with a
small, brown, dried-up little chip of a man at his heels. 
He was clean-shaven and blue-chinned, with bristling
black hair, and keen brown eyes which shone out very
brightly from between pouched under-lids and drooping
upper ones.  He advanced, glancing keenly from one
to the other of his visitors, and slowly rubbing together
his thin, blue-veined hands.  The small boy closed the
door behind him, and discreetly vanished.
<P>
"I am Mr. Reuben Metaxa," said the moneylender.  "Was
it about an advance you wished to see me?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"For you, I presume?" turning to Charles Westmacott.
<P>
"No, for this gentleman."
<P>
The moneylender looked surprised.  "How much did you
desire?"
<P>
"I thought of five thousand pounds," said the
Admiral.
<P>
"And on what security?"
<P>
"I am a retired admiral of the British navy.  You
will find my name in the Navy List.  There is my card. 
I have here my pension papers.  I get L850 a year.  I
thought that perhaps if you were to hold these papers it
would be security enough that I should pay you.  You
could draw my pension, and repay yourselves at the rate,
say, of L500 a year, taking your five per cent interest
as well."
<P>
"What interest?"
<P>
"Five per cent per annum.
<P>
Mr. Metaxa laughed.  "Per annum!" he said.  "Five per
cent a month."
<P>
"A month!  That would be sixty per cent a year."
<P>
"Precisely."
<P>
"But that is monstrous."
<P>
"I don't ask gentlemen to come to me.  They come of
their own free will.  Those are my terms, and they can
take it or leave it."
<P>
"Then I shall leave it."  The Admiral rose angrily
from his chair.
<P>
"But one moment, sir.  Just sit down and we shall
chat the matter over.  Yours is a rather unusual case and
we may find some other way of doing what you wish.  Of
course the security which you offer is no security at
all, and no sane man would advance five thousand pennies
on it."
<P>
"No security?  Why not, sir?"
<P>
"You might die to-morrow.  You are not a young man. 
What age are you?"
<P>
"Sixty-three."
<P>
Mr. Metaxa turned over a long column of figures. 
"Here is an actuary's table," said he.  "At your time of
life the average expectancy of life is only a few years
even in a well-preserved man."
<P>
"Do you mean to insinuate that I am not a
well-preserved man?"
<P>
"Well, Admiral, it is a trying life at sea.  Sailors
in their younger days are gay dogs, and take it out of
themselves.  Then when they grow older thy are still hard
at it, and have no chance of rest or peace.  I do not
think a sailor's life a good one."
<P>
"I'll tell you what, sir," said the Admiral hotly. 
"If you have two pairs of gloves I'll undertake to knock
you out under three rounds.  Or I'll race you from here
to St. Paul's, and my friend here will see fair.  I'll
let you see whether I am an old man or not."
<P>
"This is beside the question," said the moneylender
with a deprecatory shrug.  "The point is that if you died
to-morrow where would be the security then?"
<P>
"I could insure my life, and make the policy over to
you."
<P>
"Your premiums for such a sum, if any office would
have you, which I very much doubt, would come to close on
five hundred a year.  That would hardly suit your book."
<P>
"Well, sir, what do you intend to propose?" asked the
Admiral.
<P>
"I might, to accommodate you, work it in another way. 
I should send for a medical man, and have an opinion upon
your life.  Then I might see what could be done."
<P>
"That is quite fair.  I have no objection to that."
<P>
"There is a very clever doctor in the street here. 
Proudie is his name.  John, go and fetch Doctor Proudie." 
The youth was dispatched upon his errand, while Mr.
Metaxa sat at his desk, trimming his nails, and shooting
out little comments upon the weather.  Presently feet
were heard upon the stairs, the moneylender hurried
out, there was a sound of whispering, and he returned
with a large, fat, greasy-looking man, clad in a much
worn frock-coat, and a very dilapidated top hat.
<P>
"Doctor Proudie, gentlemen," said Mr. Metaxa.
<P>
The doctor bowed, smiled, whipped off his hat, and
produced his stethoscope from its interior with the air
of a conjurer upon the stage.  "Which of these gentlemen
am I to examine?" he asked, blinking from one to the
other of them.  "Ah, it is you!  Only your waistcoat! 
You need not undo your collar.  Thank you!  A full
breath!  Thank you!  Ninety-nine!  Thank you!  Now hold
your breath for a moment.  Oh, dear, dear, what is this
I hear?"
<P>
"What is it then?" asked the Admiral coolly.
<P>
"Tut! tut!  This is a great pity.  Have you had
rheumatic fever?"
<P>
"Never."
<P>
"You have had some serious illness?"
<P>
"Never."
<P>
"Ah, you are an admiral.  You have been abroad,
tropics, malaria, ague--I know."
<P>
"I have never had a day's illness."
<P>
"Not to your knowledge; but you have inhaled
unhealthy air, and it has left its effect.  You have an
organic murmur--slight but distinct."
<P>
"Is it dangerous?"
<P>
"It might at anytime become so.  You should not take
violent exercise."
<P>
"Oh, indeed.  It would hurt me to run a half mile?"
<P>
"It would be very dangerous."
<P>
"And a mile?"
<P>
"Would be almost certainly fatal."
<P>
"Then there is nothing else the matter?"
<P>
"No.  But if the heart is weak, then everything is
weak, and the life is not a sound one."
<P>
"You see, Admiral," remarked Mr. Metaxa, as the
doctor secreted his stethoscope once more in his hat, "my
remarks were not entirely uncalled for.  I am sorry that
the doctor's opinion is not more favorable, but this is
a matter of business, and certain obvious precautions
must be taken."
<P>
"Of course.  Then the matter is at an end."
<P>
"Well, we might even now do business.  I am most
anxious to be of use to you.  How long do you think,
doctor, that this gentleman will in all probability
live?"
<P>
"Well, well, it's rather a delicate question to
answer," said Dr. Proudie, with a show of embarrassment.
<P>
"Not a bit, sir.  Out with it!  I have faced death
too often to flinch from it now, though I saw it as near
me as you are."
<P>
"Well, well, we must go by averages of course.  Shall
we say two years?  I should think that you have a full
two years before you."
<P>
"In two years your pension would bring you in L1,600. 
Now I will do my very best for you, Admiral!  I will
advance you L2,000, and you can make over to me your
pension for your life.  It is pure speculation on my
part.  If you die to-morrow I lose my money.  If the
doctor's prophecy is correct I shall still be out of
pocket.  If you live a little longer, then I may see my
money again.  It is the very best I can do for you."
<P>
"Then you wish to buy my pension?"
<P>
"Yes, for two thousand down."
<P>
"And if I live for twenty years?"
<P>
"Oh, in that case of course my speculation would be
more successful.  But you have heard the doctor's
opinion."
<P>
"Would you advance the money instantly?"
<P>
"You should have a thousand at once.  The other
thousand I should expect you to take in furniture."
<P>
"In furniture?"
<P>
"Yes, Admiral.  We shall do you a beautiful houseful
at that sum.  It is the custom of my clients to take half
in furniture."
<P>
The Admiral sat in dire perplexity.  He had come out
to get money, and to go back without any, to be powerless
to help when his boy needed every shilling to save him
from disaster, that would be very bitter to him.  On the
other hand, it was so much that he surrendered, and
so little that he received.  Little, and yet
something.  Would it not be better than going back
empty-handed?  He saw the yellow backed cheque-book upon
the table.  The moneylender opened it and dipped his pen
into the ink.
<P>
"Shall I fill it up?" said he.
<P>
"I think, Admiral," remarked Westmacott, "that we had
better have a little walk and some luncheon before we
settle this matter."
<P>
"Oh, we may as well do it at once.  It would be
absurd to postpone it now," Metaxa spoke with some heat,
and his eyes glinted angrily from between his narrow lids
at the imperturbable Charles.  The Admiral was simple in
money matters, but he had seen much of men and had
learned to read them.  He saw that venomous glance, and
saw too that intense eagerness was peeping out from
beneath the careless air which the agent had assumed.
<P>
"You're quite right, Westmacott," said he.  "We'll
have a little walk before we settle it."
<P>
"But I may not be here this afternoon."
<P>
"Then we must choose another day."
<P>
"But why not settle it now?"
<P>
"Because I prefer not," said the Admiral shortly.
<P>
"Very well.  But remember that my offer is only for
to-day.  It is off unless you take it at once."
<P>
"Let it be off, then.
<P>
"There's my fee," cried the doctor.
<P>
"How much?"
<P>
"A guinea."
<P>
The Admiral threw a pound and a shilling upon the
table.  "Come, Westmacott," said he, and they walked
together from the room.
<P>
"I don't like it," said Charles, when they found
themselves in the street once more; "I don't profess to
be a very sharp chap, but this is a trifle too thin. 
What did he want to go out and speak to the doctor for? 
And how very convenient this tale of a weak heart was! 
I believe they are a couple of rogues, and in league with
each other."
<P>
"A shark and a pilot fish," said the Admiral.
<P>
"I'll tell you what I propose, sir.  There's a lawyer
named McAdam who does my aunt's business.  He is a very
honest fellow, and lives at the other side of Poultry. 
We'll go over to him together and have his opinion about
the whole matter."
<P>
"How far is it to his place?"
<P>
"Oh, a mile at least.  We can have a cab."
<P>
"A mile?  Then we shall see if there is any truth in
what that swab of a doctor said.  Come, my boy, and clap
on all sail, and see who can stay the longest."
<P>
Then the sober denizens of the heart of business
London saw a singular sight as they returned from their
luncheons.  Down the roadway, dodging among cabs and
carts, ran a weather-stained elderly man, with wide
flapping black hat, and homely suit of tweeds.  With
elbows braced back, hands clenched near his armpits, and
chest protruded, he scudded along, while close at his
heels lumbered a large-limbed, heavy, yellow mustached
young man, who seemed to feel the exercise a good deal
more than his senior.  On they dashed, helter-skelter,
until they pulled up panting at the office where the
lawyer of the Westmacotts was to be found.
<P>
"There now!" cried the Admiral in triumph.  "What
d'ye think of that?  Nothing wrong in the engine-room,
eh?"
<P>
"You seem fit enough, sir.
<P>
"Blessed if I believe the swab was a certificated
doctor at all.  He was flying false colors, or I am
mistaken."
<P>
"They keep the directories and registers in this
eating-house," said Westmacott.  "We'll go and look him
out."
<P>
They did so, but the medical rolls contained no such
name as that of Dr. Proudie, of Bread Street.
<P>
"Pretty villainy this!" cried the Admiral, thumping
his chest.  "A dummy doctor and a vamped up disease. 
Well, we've tried the rogues, Westmacott!  Let us see
what we can do with your honest man."
