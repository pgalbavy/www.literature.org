&quot;Why do you keep smiling to yourself, Phebe?&quot; asked Rose, as
they were working together one morning, for Dr. Alec considered
house-work the best sort of gymnastics for girls; so Rose took
lessons of Phebe in sweeping, dusting and bed-making.</p>

<p>&quot;I was thinking about a nice little secret I know, and couldn't help
smiling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I know it, sometime?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guess you will.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I like it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, won't you, though!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Will it happen soon?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sometime this week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know what it is! The boys are going to have fireworks on the
fourth, and have got some surprise for me. Haven't they?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's telling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I can wait; only tell me one thing is uncle in it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course he is; there's never any fun without him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then it's all right, and sure to be nice.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose went out on the balcony to shake the rugs, and, having given
them a vigorous beating, hung them on the balustrade to air, while
she took a look at her plants. Several tall vases and jars stood
there, and a month of June sun and rain had worked wonders with
the seeds and slips she had planted. Morning-glories and
nasturtiums ran all over the bars, making haste to bloom. Scarlet
beans and honeysuckles were climbing up from below to meet
their pretty neighbours, and the woodbine was hanging its green
festoons wherever it could cling.</p>

<p>The waters of the bay were dancing in the sunshine, a fresh wind
stirred the chestnut-trees with a pleasant sound, and the garden
below was full of roses, butterflies and bees. A great chirping and
twittering went on among the birds, busy with their summer
house-keeping, and, far away, the white-winged gulls were dipping
and diving in the sea, where ships, like larger birds, went sailing to
and fro.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Phebe, it's such a lovely day, I do wish your fine secret was
going to happen right away! I feel just like having a good time;
don't you?&quot; said Rose, waving her arms as if she was going to fly.</p>

<p>&quot;I often feel that way, but I have to wait for my good times, and
don't stop working to wish for 'em. There, now you can finish as
soon as the dust settles; I must go do my stairs,&quot; and Phebe trudged
away with the broom, singing as she went.</p>

<p>Rose leaned where she was, and fell to thinking how many good
times she had had lately, for the gardening had prospered finely,
and she was learning to swim and row, and there were drives and
walks, and quiet hours of reading and talk with Uncle Alec, and,
best of all, the old pain and ennui seldom troubled her now. She
could work and play all day, sleep sweetly all night, and enjoy life
with the zest of a healthy, happy child. She was far from being as
strong and hearty as Phebe, but she was getting on; the once pale
cheeks had colour in them now, the hands were growing plump
and brown, and the belt was not much too loose. No one talked to
her about her health, and she forgot that she had &quot;no constitution.&quot;
She took no medicine but Dr. Alec's three great remedies, and they
seemed to suit her excellently. Aunt Plenty said it was the pills;
but, as no second batch had ever followed the first, I think the old
lady was mistaken.</p>

<p>Rose looked worthy of her name as she stood smiling to herself
over a happier secret than any Phebe had a secret which she did
not know herself till she found out, some years later, the magic of
good health.</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;'Look only,' said the brownie,<br />
 'At the pretty gown of blue,<br />
 At the kerchief pinned about her head,<br />
 And at her little shoe,&quot;'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>said a voice from below, as a great cabbage-rose came flying
against her cheek.</p>

<p>&quot;What is the princess dreaming about up there in her
hanging-garden?&quot; added Dr. Alec as she flung back a
morning-glory.</p>

<p>&quot;I was wishing I could do something pleasant this fine day;
something very new and interesting, for the wind makes me feel
frisky and gay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose we take a pull over to the Island? I intended to go this
afternoon; but if you feel more like it now, we can be off at once.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do! I do! I'll come in fifteen minutes, uncle. I must just scrabble
my room to rights, for Phebe has got a great deal to do.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose caught up the rugs and vanished as she spoke, while Dr. Alec
went in, saying to himself, with an indulgent smile</p>

<p>&quot;It may upset things a trifle, but half a child's pleasure consists in
having their fun when they want it.&quot;</p>

<p>Never did duster flap more briskly than the one Rose used that
day, and never was a room &quot;scrabbled&quot; to rights in such haste as
hers. Tables and chairs flew into their places as if alive; curtains
shook as if a gale was blowing; china rattled and small articles
tumbled about as if a young earthquake was playing with them.
The boating suit went on in a twinkling, and Rose was off with a
hop and a skip, little dreaming how many hours it would be before
she saw her pretty room again.</p>

<p>Uncle Alec was putting a large basket into the boat when she
arrived, and before they were off Phebe came running down with a
queer, knobby bundle done up in a water-proof.</p>

<p>&quot;We can't eat half that luncheon, and I know we shall not need so
many wraps. I wouldn't lumber the boat up so,&quot; said Rose, who
still had secret scares when on the water.</p>

<p>&quot;Couldn't you make a smaller parcel, Phebe?&quot; asked Dr. Alec,
eyeing the bundle suspiciously.</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir, not in such a hurry,&quot; and Phebe laughed as she gave a
particularly large knob a good poke.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it will do for ballast. Don't forget the note to Mrs. Jessie, I
beg of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. I'll send it right off,&quot; and Phebe ran up the bank as if she
had wings to her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;We'll take a look at the lighthouse first, for you have not been
there yet, and it is worth seeing. By the time we have done that it
will be pretty warm, and we will have lunch under the trees on the
Island.&quot;</p>

<p>Rose was ready for anything, and enjoyed her visit to the
lighthouse on the Point very much, especially climbing up the
narrow stairs and going inside the great lantern. They made a long
stay, for Dr. Alec seemed in no hurry to go, and kept looking
through his spy-glass as if he expected to discover something
remarkable on sea or land. It was past twelve before they reached
the Island, and Rose was ready for her lunch long before she got it.</p>

<p>&quot;Now this is lovely! I do wish the boys were here. Won't it be nice
to have them with us all their vacation? Why, it begins to-day,
doesn't it? Oh, I wish I'd remembered it sooner, and perhaps they
would have come with us,&quot; she said, as they lay luxuriously eating
sandwiches under the old apple-tree.</p>

<p>&quot;So we might. Next time we won't be in such a hurry. I expect the
lads will take our heads off when they find us out,&quot; answered Dr.
Alec, placidly drinking cold tea.</p>

<p>&quot;Uncle, I smell a frying sort of a smell,&quot; Rose said, pausing
suddenly as she was putting away the remains of the lunch half an
hour later.</p>

<p>&quot;So do I; it is fish, I think.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment they both sat with their noses in the air, sniffing like
hounds; then Dr. Alec sprang up, saying with great decision</p>

<p>&quot;Now, this won't do! No one is permitted on this island without
asking leave. I must see who dares to fry fish on my private
property.&quot;</p>

<p>Taking the basket on one arm and the bundle on the other, he
strode away towards the traitorous smell, looking as fierce as a
lion, while Rose marched behind under her umbrella.</p>

<p>&quot;We are Robinson Crusoe and his man Friday going to see if the
savages have come,&quot; she said presently, for her fancy was full of
the dear old stories that all children love so well.</p>

<p>&quot;And there they are! Two tents and two boats, as I live! These
rascals mean to enjoy themselves, that's evident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There ought to be more boats and no tents. I wonder where the
prisoners are?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are traces of them,&quot; and Dr. Alec pointed to the heads and
tails of fishes strewn on the grass.</p>

<p>&quot;And there are more,&quot; said Rose, laughing, as she pointed to a
scarlet heap of what looked like lobsters.</p>

<p>&quot;The savages are probably eating their victims now; don't you hear
the knives rattle in that tent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We ought to creep up and peep; Crusoe was cautious, you know,
and Friday scared out of his wits,&quot; added Rose, still keeping up the
joke.</p>

<p>&quot;But this Crusoe is going to pounce upon them, regardless of
consequences. If I am killed and eaten, you seize the basket and
run for the boat; there are provisions enough for your voyage
home.&quot;</p>

<p>With that Uncle Alec slipped round to the front of the tent and,
casting in the big bundle like a bomb-shell, roared out, in a voice
of thunder</p>

<p>&quot;Pirates, surrender!&quot;</p>

<p>A crash, a shout, a laugh, and out came the savages, brandishing
knives and forks, chicken bones, and tin mugs, and all fell upon
the intruder, pommelling him unmercifully as they cried</p>

<p>&quot;You came too soon! We are not half ready! You've spoilt it all!
Where is Rose?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here I am,&quot; answered a half-stifled voice, and Rose was
discovered sitting on the pile of red flannel bathing clothes, which
she had mistaken for lobsters, and where she had fallen in a fit of
merriment when she discovered that the cannibals were her merry
cousins.</p>

<p>&quot;You good-for-nothing boys! You are always bursting out upon me
in some ridiculous way, and I always get taken in because I'm not
used to such pranks. Uncle is as bad as the rest, and it's great fun,&quot;
she said, as the lads came round her, half scolding, half
welcoming, and wholly enjoying the double surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;You were not to come till afternoon, and mamma was to be here
to receive you. Everything is in a mess now, except your tent; we
got that in order the first thing, and you can sit there and see us
work,&quot; said Archie, doing the honours as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;Rose felt it in her bones, as Dolly says, that something was in the
wind, and wanted to be off at once. So I let her come, and should
have kept her away an hour longer if your fish had not betrayed
you,&quot; explained Uncle Alec, subsiding from a ferocious Crusoe
into his good-natured self again.</p>

<p>&quot;As this seat is rather damp, I think I'll rise,&quot; said Rose, as the
excitement lessened a little.</p>

<p>Several fishy hands helped her up, and Charlie said, as he scattered
the scarlet garments over the grass with an oar</p>

<p>&quot;We had a jolly good swim before dinner, and I told the Brats to
spread these to dry. Hope you brought your things, Rose, for you
belong to the Lobsters, you know, and we can have no end of fun
teaching you to dive and float and tread water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't bring anything - &quot; began Rose, but was interrupted by the
Brats (otherwise Will and Geordie), who appeared bearing the big
bundle, so much demoralised by its fall that a red flannel tunic
trailed out at one end and a little blue dressing-gown at the other,
while the knobs proved to be a toilet-case, rubbers, and a silver
mug.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that sly Phebe! This was the secret, and she bundled up those
things after I went down to the boat,&quot; cried Rose, with sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Guess something is smashed inside, for a bit of glass fell out,&quot;
observed Will, as they deposited the bundle at her feet.</p>

<p>&quot;Catch a girl going anywhere without a looking-glass. We haven't
got one among the whole lot of us,&quot; added Mac, with masculine
scorn.</p>

<p>&quot;Dandy has; I caught him touching up his wig behind the trees
after our swim,&quot; cut in Geordie, wagging a derisive finger at Steve,
who promptly silenced him by a smart rap on the head with the
drum-stick he had just polished off.</p>

<p>&quot;Come, come, you lazy lubbers, fall to work, or we shall not be
ready for mamma. Take Rose's things to her tent, and tell her all
about it, Prince. Mac and Steve, you cut away and bring up the rest
of the straw; and you small chaps, clear off the table, if you have
stuffed all you can. Please, uncle, I'd like your advice about the
boundary lines and the best place for the kitchen.&quot;</p>

<p>Everyone obeyed the chief, and Rose was escorted to her tent by
Charlie, who devoted himself to her service. She was charmed
with her quarters, and still more so with the programme which he
unfolded before her as they worked.</p>

<p>&quot;We always camp out somewhere in vacation, and this year we
thought we'd try the Island. It is handy, and our fireworks will
show off well from here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we stay over the Fourth? Three whole days! Oh, me! what a
frolic it will be!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bless your heart, we often camp for a week, we big fellows; but
this year the small chaps wanted to come, so we let them. We have
great larks, as you'll see; for we have a cave and play Captain
Kidd, and have shipwrecks, and races, and all sorts of games. Arch
and I are rather past that kind of thing now, but we do it to please
the children,&quot; added Charlie, with a sudden recollection of his
sixteen years.</p>

<p>&quot;I had no idea boys had such good times. Their plays never seemed
a bit interesting before. But I suppose that was because I never
knew any boys very well, or perhaps you are unusually nice ones,&quot;
observed Rose, with an artless air of appreciation that was very
flattering.</p>

<p>&quot;We are a pretty clever set, I fancy; but we have a good many
advantages, you see. There are a tribe of us, to begin with; then our
family has been here for ages, and we have plenty of 'spondulics,'
so we can rather lord it over the other fellows, and do as we like.
There, ma'am, you can hang your smashed glass on that nail and
do up your back hair as fine as you please. You can have a blue
blanket or a red one, and a straw pillow or an air cushion for your
head, whichever you like. You can trim up to any extent, and be as
free and easy as squaws in a wigwam, for this corner is set apart
for you ladies and we never cross the line uncle is drawing until
we ask leave. Anything more I can do for you, cousin?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you. I think I'll leave the rest till auntie comes, and go
and help you somewhere else, if I may.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, indeed, come on and see to the kitchen. Can you cook?&quot;
asked Charlie, as he led the way to the rocky nook where Archie
was putting up a sail-cloth awning.</p>

<p>&quot;I can make tea and toast bread.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we'll shew you how to fry fish, and make chowder. Now
you just set these pots and pans round tastefully, and sort of tidy up
a bit, for Aunt Jessie insists on doing some of the work, and I want
it to be decent here.&quot;</p>

<p>By four o'clock the camp was in order, and the weary workers
settled down on Lookout Rock to watch for Mrs. Jessie and Jamie,
who was never far from mamma's apron string. They looked like a
flock of blue-birds, all being in sailor rig, with blue ribbon enough
flying from the seven hats to have set up a milliner. Very tuneful
blue-birds they were, too, for all the lads sang, and the echo of
their happy voices reached Mrs. Jessie long before she saw them.</p>

<p>The moment the boat hove in sight up went the Island flag, and the
blue-jackets cheered lustily, as they did on every possible
occasion, like true young Americans. This welcome was answered
by the flapping of a handkerchief and the shrill &quot;Rah! Rah! Rah!&quot;
of the one small tar who stood in the stern waving his hat
manfully, while a maternal hand clutched him firmly in the rear.</p>

<p>Cleopatra landing from her golden galley never received a heartier
greeting than &quot;Little Mum&quot; as she was borne to her tent by the
young folk, for love of whom she smilingly resigned herself to
three days of discomfort; while Jamie immediately attached
himself to Rose, assuring her of his protection from the manifold
perils which might assail them.</p>

<p>Taught by long experience that boys are always hungry, Aunt
Jessie soon proposed supper, and proceeded to get it, enveloped in
an immense apron, with an old hat of Archie's stuck atop of her
cap. Rose helped, and tried to be as handy as Phebe, though the
peculiar style of table she had to set made it no easy task. It was
accomplished at last, and a very happy party lay about under the
trees, eating and drinking out of anyone's plate and cup, and quite
untroubled by the frequent appearance of ants and spiders in places
which these interesting insects are not expected to adorn.</p>

<p>&quot;I never thought I should like to wash dishes, but I do,&quot; said Rose,
as she sat in a boat after supper lazily rinsing plates in the sea, and
rocking luxuriously as she wiped them.</p>

<p>&quot;Mum is mighty particular; we just give 'em a scrub with sand, and
dust 'em off with a bit of paper. It's much the best way, I think,&quot;
replied Geordie, who reposed in another boat alongside.</p>

<p>&quot;How Phebe would like this! I wonder uncle did not have her
come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I believe he tried to, but Dolly was as cross as two sticks, and said
she couldn't spare her. I'm sorry, for we all like the Phebe bird, and
she'd chirp like a good one out here, wouldn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She ought to have a holiday like the rest of us. It's too bad to leave
her out.&quot;</p>

<p>This thought came back to Rose several times that evening, for
Phebe would have added much to the little concert they had in the
moonlight, would have enjoyed the stories told, been quick at
guessing the conundrums, and laughed with all her heart at the fun.
The merry going to bed would have been the best of all, for Rose
wanted someone to cuddle under the blue blanket with her, there
to whisper and giggle and tell secrets, as girls delight to do.</p>

<p>Long after the rest were asleep, Rose lay wide awake, excited by
the novelty of all about her, and a thought that had come into her
mind. Far away she heard a city clock strike twelve; a large star
like a mild eye peeped in at the opening of the tent, and the soft
plash of the waves seemed calling her to come out. Aunt Jessie lay
fast asleep, with Jamie rolled up like a kitten at her feet, and
neither stirred as Rose in her wrapper crept out to see how the
world looked at midnight.</p>

<p>She found it very lovely, and sat down on a cracker keg to enjoy it
with a heart full of the innocent sentiment of her years.
Fortunately, Dr. Alec saw her before she had time to catch cold,
for coming out to tie back the door-flap of his tent for more air, he
beheld the small figure perched in the moonlight. Having no fear
of ghosts, he quietly approached, and, seeing that she was wide
awake, said, with a hand on her shining hair</p>

<p>&quot;What is my girl doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Having a good time,&quot; answered Rose, not at all startled.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder what she was thinking about with such a sober look.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The story you told of the brave sailor who gave up his place on
the raft to the woman, and the last drop of water to the poor baby.
People who make sacrifices are very much loved and admired,
aren't they?&quot; she asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>&quot;If the sacrifice is a true one. But many of the bravest never are
known, and get no praise. That does not lessen their beauty, though
perhaps it makes them harder, for we all like sympathy,&quot; and Dr.
Alec sighed a patient sort of sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose you have made a great many? Would you mind telling
me one of them?&quot; asked Rose, arrested by the sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;My last was to give up smoking,&quot; was the very unromantic answer
to her pensive question.</p>

<p>&quot;Why did you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bad example for the boys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was very good of you, uncle! Was it hard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm ashamed to say it was. But as a wise old fellow once said, 'It is
necessary to do right; it is not necessary to be happy.' &quot;</p>

<p>Rose pondered over the saying as if it pleased her, and then said,
with a clear, bright look</p>

<p>&quot;A real sacrifice is giving up something you want or enjoy very
much, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doing it one's own self because one loves another person very
much and wants her to be happy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And doing it pleasantly, and being glad about it, and not minding
the praise if it doesn't come?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, dear, that is the true spirit of self-sacrifice; you seem to
understand it, and I dare say you will have many chances in your
life to try the real thing. I hope they won't be very hard ones.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think they will,&quot; began Rose, and there stopped short.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, make one now, and go to sleep, or my girl will be ill
to-morrow, and then the aunts will say camping out was bad for
her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go good night!&quot; and throwing him a kiss, the little ghost
vanished, leaving Uncle Alec to pace the shore and think about
some of the unsuspected sacrifices that had made him what he
was.</p>
