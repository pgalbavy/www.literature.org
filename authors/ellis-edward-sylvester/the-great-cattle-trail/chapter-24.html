<p>Meanwhile Avon Burnet and Gleeson continued riding northward
at an easy gallop, their eyes and ears on the alert for sounds
of their friends or enemies.</p>

<p>"Do you remember this spot?" asked the elder, drawing his mustang
down to a walk, after going some distance.</p>

<p>The youth looked keenly round in the gloom, but saw only the
level plain, similar to that over which they had ridden since
leaving the cabin. A dark object on the ground caused him to force
his pony toward it.</p>

<p>"That must be one of our cattle," he said inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It's what is left of him; that's the steer that the Comanche
brought down when he took a shot at you."</p>

<p>"Ah, this is the place where you joined me?"</p>

<p>"Percisely."</p>

<p>"But where is <em>he</em>&mdash;that is, his body?"</p>

<p>"They've took it off; you know how hard the Comanches try to
carry away their dead and wounded."</p>

<p>"I saw a proof of that while hunting for Thunderbolt, but I didn't
think they would be able to find this one."</p>

<p>"They must have heard the shot and his cry, and though we made
things hum about them, they took time to look into it and bear
the body away."</p>

<p>"I wonder now whether that could have been Wygwind," said Avon,
referring to the notorious leader of whom we have spoken.</p>

<p>"No," was the decisive reply of Ballyhoo.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"He is a powerful brave Injin, but plenty of his warriors can
outrun him. This one was too good on his feet to be him."</p>

<p>The couple gave their horses rein again, and they broke into
a gallop which carried them swiftly toward their destination.
The glimmer of the camp-fire was discerned when they rode to the
top of the next moderate elevation.</p>

<p>"Hark!" exclaimed Ballyhoo, abruptly checking his pony.</p>

<p>His companion did the same, for he had caught the sound, which
was that made by many hoofs.</p>

<p>"The confounded beasts are still at it," added the elder, allowing
his steed to resume his walk.</p>

<p>"The boys may be driving them back to camp."</p>

<p>"No; it doesn't sound right."</p>

<p>"Do you imagine the Comanches are taking any hand in this?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't strike me so, but there's no saying what those varmints
will do; they're so fond of stealing that they'll run great risks."</p>

<p>However, since the couple were able to locate the running animals,
they felt it their duty to bear a hand in helping to bring them
back to camp. There was danger that if they were not speedily
brought under control, the start could not be made on time.</p>

<p>"Come on, Baby," called Gleeson, wheeling his animal to the right,
and sending him off at a dead run.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt knew what was expected of him, and without waiting
for orders, stretched away in the same direction, with the old
thrill stirring his rider at the prospect of exciting work at
hand.</p>

<p>It was not long before they caught sight of the frightened animals,
going as if a legion of wolves were at their heels. They were
running from camp, and, unless their course could be changed,
would be far from it before daylight.</p>

<p>In fact their presence so comparatively near proved that they
were either another part of the main herd, or if the ones first
stampeded, had broken off again, after being well on their way
to their regular pasturing grounds.</p>

<p>"Look out! they may be Comanches!" called Ballyhoo to his youthful
companion. "No, they are not either."</p>

<p>The last remark was caused by the sight of two of their friends
riding like mad, shouting and swinging their whips, which they
had brought from camp. They were Madstone and Rickety, who were
doing all they knew how to check the animals that seemingly would
not be checked or turned aside.</p>

<p>It looked as if Ballyhoo and Avon must be trampled to death,
for they were directly in front of the rushing herd, but they
swung their arms, holding each his rifle aloft, and shouted loud
enough to be heard miles distant.</p>

<p>The mustangs were a little nervous, but were used to such experiences,
and they did not catch the contagion. They held their ground,
though it was manifest they would have preferred to be somewhere
else.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when the terrified beasts were almost upon them, they
swerved to one side. The change of direction was slight, but it
was important as a beginning. The cowboys were quick to take advantage
of it, and redoubled their shoutings and gesticulations. The cattle
trended further and further from the course they had been following,
and ere long were headed toward the camp.</p>

<p>They were now on the run and the four men kept them there, determined
that they should not get away again.</p>

<p>Madstone explained that they were the ones that took fright earlier
in the evening, and were on a dead run, when Ballyhoo shot down
the Comanche that was pursuing Avon Burnet. The cattle had drifted
a considerable way, but they were soon brought under control and
headed in the right direction.</p>

<p>All was going well, when off they went again at a more frantic
rate than before. The cowboys were at loss to understand what
caused the new outbreak, when, to their amazement, three Comanches
appeared in their front.</p>

<p>The dusky scamps did their best to run them off, but it was evident
they were afraid of the Texans, who made a dash for them, whereupon
they disappeared.</p>

<p>But they had turned the cattle in a new direction, and the Texans
had all their work to do over again. There was little prospect
of success, until Ballyhoo and Avon added their efforts, when
matters assumed a better shape.</p>

<p>But the trouble was by no means over. If these animals should
plunge into the main herd at the rate they were now going, they
were sure to spread the panic, with the probability that the whole
two thousand would soon be on the run, and the difficulty of the
ranchmen intensified ten-fold.</p>

<p>Accordingly, as the ground was approached, the four horsemen
resorted to the well-known practice of what may be called rounding-up.
They galloped back and forth, on the outer edge of the herd, and
here and there, circumnavigating them continually and as fast
as the fleetness of their mustangs would permit.</p>

<p>By this means they finally succeeded in turning the heads of
the cattle toward each other, and they were crowded into a compact
mass, whose members were obliged to stand still, since they were
huddled in one heap, with the yelling cowboys careering back and
forth, around the circumference.</p>

<p>This was not accomplished a moment too soon, for they were close
upon the main herd, which showed a restlessness that might have
broken forth into another stampede, but for the skill of the other
cowboys who had them in charge.</p>

<p>When the reunion of the Texans took place near the camp-fire,
and there was a general talk over the incidents of the evening,
the arrangements were made for the night. All had been so actively
engaged that rest would have been acceptable, but there was not
one who would have murmured, had he been ordered to take his position
and hold it for hours.</p>

<p>Indeed Avon Burnet volunteered to do his part in looking after
the cattle that it was necessary to keep under watch through the
darkness.</p>

<p>"No," replied Ballyhoo, "I've fixed it. You and me will take
a hand to-morrow night, when we're likely to find it a blamed
sight more unpleasant than now."</p>

<p>"And why so?"</p>

<p>"That storm that we've been talking about is holding off, as
though it finds it hard to make up its mind to come, but it will
be here within twenty hours or less."</p>

<p>"I am glad of it," remarked the youth, thinking of his friends
in the distant cabin, which had escaped burning by such a narrow
chance.</p>

<p>It was now past midnight, and those who were to be off duty did
not squander the precious hours; but, crawling into the covered
wagon, bundled themselves up and slept the sleep which waits on
rugged health.</p>

<p>At the earliest streakings of light the camp was astir. The man
who served the party as cook had no light task on his hands. He
generally carried a lot of wood in the wagon with him, for the
reason that it was not always easy to obtain, and, by doing this,
he was sure of always having enough dry fuel to burn readily when
wanted.</p>

<p>Those Texans were satisfied at times to go without anything at
all in the way of food, or to snatch a bite by checking their
mustangs long enough to allow them to receive it, when they were
off again; but whenever the opportunity for a "square meal" presented
itself, they proved themselves full hands.</p>

<p>Gleeson, who acted as master during the absence of Captain Shirril,
mounted his horse and rode out to inspect the herd. He was relieved
to find them all in place. Most of them were lying down, drowsily
chewing their cuds, but a few had risen and were cropping the
grass, which grew quite abundantly in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>While employed in this duty, Ballyhoo cast frequent looks in
the direction of Captain Shirril's home. He expected to see their
leader before it was light, but the sun was already showing in
the horizon and he was not in sight.</p>

<p>The Texan galloped to the top of the adjoining elevation, from
which he could see the low flat building in the distance. Shading
his eyes with his hand, he peered long and earnestly, but without
catching sight of a horseman galloping toward him.</p>

<p>"It's very odd," thought Gleeson, "that he doesn't show up; something
must have taken place. I wonder if those varmints have come back
after Baby and I left last night."</p>

<p>It seemed impossible that anything like this should have occurred,
but it was beyond his power to explain the non-appearance of the
"boss" on any other theory. He was prompt and energetic, and was
more likely to be ahead than behind the time he set for his own
appearance at a particular place.</p>

<p>Without giving expression to his fears, he joined the group at
the wagon and partook of his breakfast, washing down his food
with a cup of delicious steaming coffee. He avoided Avon for a
time, because he plainly saw the young man was disturbed; but,
when the meal was finished, the remarks became general over the
absence of Captain Shirril.</p>

<p>"I've just come from the top of the swell," said Madstone, who
had been there since Ballyhoo, "and can't see anything of him.
I 'spose he has overslept himself, because of the flurry last
night."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe it is nothing worse," said Avon, walking
thoughtfully out to where his mustang stood saddled and bridled.</p>

<p>"Why, what else could it be, Baby?" asked Ballyhoo, repressing
his own uneasiness.</p>

<p>"That's just what I want to find out; I tell you, I don't think
we ought to stay here, when it's pretty sure something is wrong
at the house; if the Comanches are going to keep this up, it will
never do to leave the women alone; I shall have to go back and
stay with them."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it's that, but we shall soon know."</p>

<p>He sprang into the saddle, and the two rode to the elevation
which has already been referred to several times.</p>

<p>"I will wait here," said the elder, checking his animals, "while
you ride on to the cabin."</p>

<p>Avon looked inquiringly at him.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it best you should go with me?"</p>

<p>"No; I will keep you under my eye all the way; if you see anything
out of gear, you need only to signal, and I will fetch two or
three of the boys with me."</p>

<p>It struck the youth as strange that Ballyhoo should stop after
starting for the dwelling. The young man had made up his mind
there was something wrong there, and it seemed to him like a waste
of time for his friend to hold back.</p>

<p>However, he said nothing further in the way of protest, but,
speaking briskly to Thunderbolt, sent him off at headlong speed
toward the cabin.</p>

<p>"I am afraid this knocks all my plans to smithereens," he said
to himself; "for if there is the least danger of the Comanches
putting in their appearance again, it would never do for me to
leave home. It is bad enough for uncle to go, but there is no
help in his case, while there is in mine."</p>

<p>As he drew near the dwelling his feelings intensified, and all
other thoughts went from him.</p>

<p>"I don't see a sign of a living person," he added, slowing the
gait of his steed; "suppose the Comanches made a descent upon
them in the night and managed to secure entrance&mdash;well, by gracious!"</p>
