<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>One of the singular facts connected with the <em>crotalus</em>
species is the ease with which it is killed. The writer once ended
the career of a huge specimen with a single blow of a whip-lash.
The first impact of Fred Greenwood's rifle-barrel upon the hideous
reptile coiled in the scrub bushes inflicted a fatal wound, though
the serpent continued blindly striking for a minute or two longer,
and responded viciously to the attack of the scared and angry
Jack Dudley, who struck it several times after it had ceased to
struggle and all danger was past. A person's first impulse, after
being bitten by a snake, is to kill it, after which he looks after
the wound he may have received.</p>

<p>But Fred had heard the dreadful exclamation of his comrade and
caught him by his arm as he was about to bring down his last blow
upon the reptile.</p>

<p>"O Jack, are you sure he bit you?" he asked in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>"Yes; I felt the sting in my left ankle, like the prick of a
needle."</p>

<p>Dropping upon the ground, he hastily unfastened and turned down
his legging. There, sure enough, was a tiny red spot, with a single
drop of blood oozing from it.</p>

<p>"The rattlesnake has two fangs," said Fred; "but there is only
one wound here."</p>

<p>"It wasn't a direct blow, I suppose," said the white-faced Jack,
who had good reason to be terrified over the occurrence, for the
rattlesnake, although ranking below the cobra in the virulence
of its venom, is the most deadly serpent in America, and the veteran
hunter fears it more than the most savage of wild animals.</p>

<p>Fred stooped down and examined the wound closely. A thrilling
suspicion was becoming certainty in his mind.</p>

<p>"When did you feel that bite?" he asked.</p>

<p>"At the moment I landed on my feet. What a dreadful poison it
is! I can feel it all through my body; and don't you see that
my ankle has begun to swell?"</p>

<p>Fred continued to study the wound, pressing his finger around
it and bending close to the limb. Had the hurt been caused by
the fang of a serpent he would have tried to suck out the venom.
Suddenly he looked up with glowing face.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack, my dear fellow, don't be frightened; you haven't
been bitten at all."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"At the moment you landed on your feet I was beating the life
out of the snake, and he was giving his whole attention to me.
He did not try to bite you till you turned about and began striking
at him."</p>

<p>"But what made that wound?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>"I suspect the cause."</p>

<p>He drew up the legging and examined the part that covered the
spot in the ankle which had received the blow.</p>

<p>"There! I knew it! That's what did it!"</p>

<p>He had plucked out a small, needle-pointed thorn. The bushes
abounded with similar prongs, one of which had been torn off and
pierced the legging of Jack when he was crashing through the tops
of the bushes.</p>

<p>"Sure there isn't any mistake about that?" asked the youth, feeling
as if a mountain were lifted from his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There can't be."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!"</p>

<p>With one bound the happy fellow came to his feet, and throwing
his arms about his comrade, hugged him into temporary breathlessness.</p>

<p>"Thank the Lord! Richard's himself again! The V. W. W. are born
to good fortune."</p>

<p>And joining hands, the two danced with delight. Many in the situation
of Fred Greenwood would have laughed at Jack and "guyed" him over
his blunder, but the incident was too dreadful and the terror
of his friend too intense for Fred to wish to amuse himself at
his expense. However, he could not help indulging just a trifle.
Suddenly pausing in his antics he looked down at the feet of Jack.</p>

<p>"I suppose in a few minutes your ankle will be so swelled that
the buckles will fly off the legging. By this time, too, you must
feel the poison in your head."</p>

<p>By way of answer, Jack, who, like Fred, had laid aside his Winchester
and venison, seized his friend and tried to lay him on his back.
They had had many a wrestling bout at home and there was little
difference in their skill. Fred was always ready for a test, and
he responded with such vigor that before Jack suspected he received
an unquestioned fall, since both shoulders and hips were on the
ground at the same time, with his conqueror holding him motionless.</p>

<p>"It was hardly fair," remarked Fred, allowing him to rise to
his feet.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Jack, also coming up.</p>

<p>"The venom of the rattlesnake so weakened you that you are not
yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll show you whether I am or not!"</p>

<p>At it they went again, and this time Jack was the victor, after
which they brushed off their clothing and agreed to leave the
deciding bout for a more convenient season. Night was rapidly
closing in.</p>

<p>"That exercise has added to my appetite," remarked Jack, as they
gathered up their belongings and moved off.</p>

<p>"It would have done the same for me, if the thing were possible."</p>

<p>Mindful of the danger of going astray, they carefully studied
the landmarks, so far as they could see them. Their main reliance
was the lofty peak that was visible for so great a distance, but
with that help they saw it growing dark, while they were in a
region totally strange to them.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" said Fred, as they came to a halt; "in the face
of all that Hank told us, we have lost our way!"</p>

<p>"It has that look," replied Jack, removing his hat and drawing
his handkerchief across his moist forehead; "but I don't see that
it is such a serious thing, after all. We can spend the night
here as well as anywhere."</p>

<p>"What will Hank think, when he goes to camp to meet us?"</p>

<p>"I reckon he'll not be disappointed; besides, we can't be far
from the place, and can look it up to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it will hurt us to build a fire among these
rocks and spend the night; but the air is pretty cool and we shall
miss our blankets."</p>

<p>"Old hunters like ourselves must become used to such things,"
complacently observed Jack, who began preparations at the same
moment for carrying out his own proposal. It was no trouble to
find enough brush and wood to serve them, and they had brought
such a goodly supply of matches from the ranch in their rubber
safes that they soon had a vigorous fire going, over which they
broiled their venison.</p>

<p>The meal of itself would not have been enjoyable at their home,
for it was too "new," lacking a certain tenderness that forms
one of its chief attractions. Besides, it was unavoidably scorched
in the preparation; but the mixed pepper and salt sprinkled over
it improved the flavor. But the great thing was their insatiate
appetites, for it is a homely truth that there is no sauce like
hunger. So it came about that they not only made a nourishing
meal, but had enough left to serve them in the morning.</p>

<p>It was fully dark when the repast was finished. The fire had
been started against the face of a boulder, and only a small quantity
of wood remained&mdash;not sufficient to last half through the night.
With the going down of the sun the air became colder. It seemed
at times as if a breath of wind from the snowy peaks reached them,
and it caused an involuntary shiver. The prospect of remaining
where they were through the dismal hours of darkness was anything
but cheering.</p>

<p>"Jack," suddenly said Fred in a guarded undertone, "there's some
wild animal near us."</p>

<p>"How can you know that?"</p>

<p>"I heard him moving about."</p>

<p>"In what direction?"</p>

<p>"Just beyond the ridge there. Hark! Didn't you hear it?"</p>

<p>"You are right," whispered Jack; "let's find out what it is."</p>

<p>Gun in hand, they moved stealthily up the slight ridge near by.
It was only a few feet in height. Their experience had taught
them that danger was likely to break upon them at any time, and
they did not mean to be caught unprepared. Neither spoke as they
cautiously climbed the ridge, like a couple of Indian scouts on
the alert for the first appearance of peril.</p>

<p>But they reached the crest of the slight elevation without having
heard anything more of that which had alarmed them. The next moment,
however, both caught the dim outlines of a large animal moving
slowly from them. Before they were certain of its identity the
creature neighed, as if frightened by the stealthy approach of
the youths.</p>

<p>"It's a horse!" exclaimed Fred, who, suspecting the whole truth,
moved over the ridge and called, in a coaxing voice:</p>

<p>"Dick! Come here, Dick!"</p>

<p>The animal stopped, looked inquiringly around, and then came
forward with a pleased whinny. He was Fred's pony, and, brief
as their acquaintance had been, recognized his voice. Fred stroked
his nose and patted his neck, and the horse showed his pleasure
at receiving the endearments.</p>

<p>When the youths made their halt and cooked their supper they
were on the edge of the grassy plateau for which they were hunting,
and whose features they would have been quick to recognize were
the sun shining. Soon after, Jack's pony came out of the gloom
as if to claim attention, and he received it.</p>

<p>"We are more fortunate than I dared hope," said Jack; "here we
are at home, after all. I wonder whether Hank is ahead of us?"</p>

<p>This was unlikely, since, if he had reached the spot fixed upon
as their headquarters, he would have kindled a fire, whereas it
was dark in every direction. The partial cavern was on the other
side of the plateau, and the boys walked rapidly to it, the route
being clear, now that they had located themselves.</p>

<p>They appreciated the wisdom of Hank, who had made them help gather
enough firewood to last through the night. He said (what proved
to be the fact) that they were not likely to return till late,
when it would be hard to collect the right kind of fuel.</p>

<p>In a brief while a second fire was under way. It was started
in front of the cavern, which was of so slight extent that it
received and held much of the warmth. Seated within the opening,
with their heavy blankets wrapped about them, the boys were thoroughly
comfortable. They had met with enough stirring adventure and had
had sufficient rough experience to make the rest highly acceptable.
They naturally wondered when nine o'clock passed without bringing
Hank Hazletine.</p>

<p>"Maybe he has lost his way in the canyon," suggested Fred, giving
expression to a fancy which was not serious.</p>

<p>"You mean that he has forgotten where the stairs lead up to the
top?"</p>

<p>"I guess that's what I mean, though I never thought of it before.
If that is the fact, he may have to pick his way for two or three
hundred miles to the mouth of the canyon and then walk back to
us."</p>

<p>"That will delay his arrival."</p>

<p>"Yes. He can hardly be expected before morning."</p>

<p>"Let me see," said Jack, becoming more serious; "Hank warned
us that no matter where we went into camp, we must keep one person
on duty as sentinel."</p>

<p>"Suppose we are separated, and there is only one of us in camp?"</p>

<p>"Then, I presume, he must sit up and watch over himself. But
what's the use of one of us keeping guard here?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"We are in this cavern-like arrangement, where no one can come
upon us from the rear, while the fire will ward off danger from
the front."</p>

<p>"Suppose that danger comes in the form of an Indian; what would
he care for half a dozen fires?"</p>

<p>"But there are no unfriendly Indians in these parts."</p>

<p>"You are thinking of Motoza. We have agreed that he is friendly,
but sometimes I suspect we are making a mistake about him."</p>

<p>The boys would have been glad to convince themselves that it
was safe to dispense with guard duty, for a night of undisturbed
rest was exceedingly tempting, but no one who starts out with
the set purpose of deceiving himself can do so. The result of
it all was that the two decided that they must stand guard between
them until the sun rose.</p>

<p>On such occasions the sentinel whose turn comes first has the
preferable task, since every one will admit that it is easier
to keep awake before midnight than afterward. The division was
made more equitable by arranging that Jack Dudley should serve
until two o'clock, and Fred Greenwood for the remainder of the
morning. Before the hour of ten the younger lay down on the flinty
floor, with his heavy blanket gathered around him, and sank into
slumber. They had matched pennies for the first turn, else the
elder would not have claimed it.</p>

<p>Jack found his duty similar in many respects to that of his first
night on the prairie, but the surroundings and circumstances were
in wide contrast. In the former instance they had the companionship
of the cowman and veteran hunter, while now they could not know
whether he was within a half-dozen miles of them. Jack, however,
did not believe that anything in the nature of danger impended,
and that to a great extent he was taking upon himself an unnecessary
hardship.</p>

<p>So far as he could judge, the only possible thing to fear was
wild animals. There were always some of them prowling through
this region, but at that season of the year the wolves and other
brutes were not pressed by hunger, and no matter how fierce the
creature, he would not attempt to pass the mouth of the cavern
so long as the fire was burning. Jack flung a number of sticks
on the blaze and then passed outside, where he was beyond the
circle of light. Standing thus, in the gloom of the night, he
felt that the experience of that hour was worth the journey across
the continent.</p>

<p>There was an impressive grandeur in the solitude that he had
never felt before. On every side towered the immense peaks of
one of the loftiest spurs of the grandest mountain chain of America.
The crests resembled piles of blackness, with the stars gleaming
behind them, while he, an insignificant atom, stood with gun by
his side in one of the tiny hollows, as if to guard against attack
from the sleeping monsters.</p>

<p>As is always the case, the stillness of the vast solitude seemed
unlike silence, for a low, deep murmur was ever brooding in the
air, varied now and then by the soft voice of some waterfall,
borne across the vasty depths by an eddy in the gentle wind. Once
the bark of a wolf sounded so sharp and clear that the youth started
and looked to one side, expecting to see the animal steal forward
from the gloom, but a moment's reflection told him the brute was
a mile or more distant. Then, some time later, a mournful, wailing
cry rose and fell from some remote point. He suspected that that,
too, came from the throat of a wolf, but he was not sure.</p>

<p>Just a touch of homesickness came over Jack Dudley, and he felt
lonely for the first time since leaving home. As he looked up
at the clear sky he wondered whether his father and mother were
well and asleep; whether they were dreaming of him; whether they
missed him from that loved home and longed for the day when he
should return to them.</p>

<p>"Suppose something happens that will prevent my ever seeing them?"
he said to himself, while the tears filled his eyes. "I thought
when I believed that rattlesnake had bitten me to-day that death
was sure; and I was near it, though I was unharmed. We are in
more danger here than I expected; but we are in danger every hour,
no matter where we are. I hope nothing will befall Fred or me."</p>

<p>And standing alone in the midst of that wild, rugged scene, he
silently lifted his heart to the only One who could protect and
save them from the hundreds of perils that beset them.</p>

<p>His eye was fixed on the stupendous mountain beyond the plateau,
at whose base wound the canyon, when he observed a growing light
on its crest. The twinkling stars beyond grew dimmer, and the
white blanket of snow that had lain there for centuries rapidly
came out in bolder relief, until it sparkled and gleamed much
as he had seen it do when the sun was shining. Then a curved yellow
rim emerged from behind the mountain, its climbing of the sky
so rapid that the progress was readily noted. In a brief while
the whole form of the round full moon appeared clear of the peak,
and its silvery rays began filling the gorges and chasms below.</p>

<p>The scene was picturesque and beautiful beyond description. As
the moon climbed higher, the lower peaks, one after the other,
leaped into view, while the hollows between became blacker and
more awesome from contrast. Most of these were so deep that the
illumination made them appear stronger by the contrast. As the
orb ascended it seemed to shrink in size and to climb more slowly;
but the shifting of the wonderful panorama, progressing as it
did in complete silence, was impressive to the last degree.</p>

<p>It was as if the angels of the sky were noiselessly casting their
fleecy veils of light over and into the awful depths below, and
driving away the crouching monster of blackness that was thus
roused from his slumber and forced to flee. Grand as was the scene,
it was soothing in its effect upon the awed lad, who, leaning
against the rock behind him, the stock of his rifle resting at
his feet, surveyed it all with feelings that drew him nearer to
heaven, and gave him a more vivid knowledge of the greatness and
majesty of the Author of all that he saw and felt.</p>

<p>Standing thus, with his emotions stirred to their profoundest
depths, Jack Dudley took no note of the passage of time. Midnight
came and passed, and still he held his post, wondering, admiring
and worshipping, as must puny man when brought face to face with
such exhibitions of Omnipotence.</p>

<p>It was an unromantic ending to this experience that, forgetful
of the consequences of what he did, he finally became sensible
of the irksomeness of his standing position, and sat down, with
his back to the rock, that he might enjoy it all without fatigue
of body.</p>

<p>Need it be said what followed? He had not been seated ten minutes
when his senses left him and he became as unconscious as Fred
Greenwood, asleep in the cavern, on the other side of the smouldering
fire. The hours passed until the light of the moon paled before
the rosy hues of the rising sun, and still the boys slumbered
and knew naught of what was passing around them.</p>
