<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was a glorious morning in early June; the dew still hung heavy
on each grass blade and leaf, making rainbow tapestries that defy
description, as the waking sunbeams stole into the heart of each
round drop and nestled there; the fresh, cool air was sweet with
the breath of a thousand flowers; a beautiful bird chorus filled
the earth with riotous melody as the happy-hearted songsters flitted
from tree to tree saying, "Good morning," to their neighbors.
Through a mass of rosy clouds in the east, the sun struggled up
over the hilltop and smiled down on the sleeping village of Parker
as if trying to coax the dreamers to arise and behold the beauties
of the dawning day. In the barn-yards of the little farms scattered
around about the town roosters were crowing, hens were clucking,
cattle lowing, and horses stamping and neighing, eager for their
breakfast.</p>

<p>Old Towzer, from his bed on the porch of the little brown house,
almost bidden by tall maples and wide-spreading elms, stretched
and yawned, perked up his ears, listened intently, then rose stiffly,
shook his heavy coat and leisurely descending the steps, circled
around the place to see whether anyone was yet astir. The door
slammed at the green house on the farm adjoining, from the little
red cottage across the fields came the sound of a busy ax, and
down by the creek some early riser whistled merrily as he went
about his morning work. All this old Towzer heard, and strolling
back to his place on the porch, he looked up at the chamber window
above him and barked sharply. The drawn curtain flew up with a
flirt, a small, tousled head appeared behind the screen, and a
childish voice in a loud whisper commanded, "Keep still, you old
Towzer! It isn't time to wake Gail yet. We've got to get those
flowers and she wouldn't let us if she knew."</p>

<p>A second small face joined the first at the window, followed
by still another, all blinking sleepily, but eager with excitement.
"Oh, Peace," whispered the oldest of the trio, in an awestruck
voice, "isn't it a beau&mdash;ti&mdash;ful day? I've a notion to call&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you dast!" quickly interposed the first speaker. "You
know Gail never'd let us go. Just see how wet everything is!"</p>

<p>"Did it rain?" asked the third child, the youngest of them all,
critically examining the trees and porch-roof, and then lifting
her great, blue eyes to the bluer sky above as if expecting to
see her answer there.</p>

<p>"No, goosie, it's just dew, but it must have been awful heavy.
Get your clothes on, Allee, or Gail will wake before we are started.
Aren't you ready, Cherry?"</p>

<p>"'Most," came the muffled reply from the corner where a struggling
tangle of clothes, hands and feet proclaimed that Cherry was hurrying.</p>

<p>"Then come on; we will have to fly. I'll button your dress when
we get outside, Allee. Never mind your other shoe, Cherry; you
can put it on downstairs. Have you got your basket?" Giving her
directions in sharp, imperative whispers, Peace led the way into
the hall, leaped onto the banisters, boy-fashion, and slid quickly,
quietly to the floor below, where she waited in a fever of impatience
for her less daring sisters to creep backward down the creaking
stairs. "Skip that one, it squeaks like fury&mdash;oh, Allee, what
a racket! There, I knew you'd do it! Gail's awake. Sh! Girls!"</p>

<p>They held their breath, huddled close in the darkest corner of
the hall, and waited.</p>

<p>"Peace!" again came the call from above.</p>

<p>A happy inspiration seized the small culprit, and she snored
vigorously. Cherry and Allee clapped both hands over their mouths
to stifle their giggles, but Gail was evidently satisfied, for
she did not repeat her summons; and after another moment of hushed
waiting, the half-dressed, dishevelled trio tiptoed down the hall,
cautiously unlocked the kitchen door and slipped out into the
sweet freshness of the early day.</p>

<p>There was a quick scampering of little feet down the walk, a
subdued click of the gate, and the three children, holding hands,
raced madly along the dusty road until a thick hedge of sumac
and hazel bushes hid them from the little brown house. Then Peace
slackened her gait somewhat, but did not cease running, and kept
looking behind her as if still fearing pursuit or discovery.</p>

<p>"Oh, Peace," gasped Allee at last, stumbling blindly over sticks
and stones as her older sisters dragged her along between them,
"my dress is coming off, and my breath is all in chunks. Do we
have to run the <em>whole</em> way?"</p>

<p>Peace looked back at the small, perspiring figure, saw the plump
shoulders from which the unbuttoned dress had slipped, caught
a glimpse of flying shoestrings, rumpled stockings and naked legs,
as the little feet were jerked unceremoniously over humps and
hollows of the rough road-way, and stopped so abruptly that her
companions were thrown headlong into the dust, creating such a
commotion that a weary slumberer on the opposite side of the thicket
was rudely startled out of his nap, thinking some great catastrophe
had overtaken him. As he sat up and rubbed his eyes, looking around
him in bewilderment for the cause of his sudden awakening, he
heard an angry voice sputter shrilly, "Well, Peace Greenfield,
I must say&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't stop to say it now," interrupted another childish voice.
"I never meant to dump you over like that. You shouldn't have
been running so fast. S'posing you had been a train and tumbled
into the ditch! Reckon all your passengers would have got a good
jolt. I stopped so's we could finish dressing. Cherry, where is
your other shoe? You have run all the way down the road with only
one on. Just look at your stockings!"</p>

<p>"Where's yours? You haven't any stockings at all," retorted the
first voice, still sharp with indignation.</p>

<p>"In my pocket. I was afraid Gail would hear as 'fore we got gone.
There, Allee, your dress is done. Fasten up your shoes while I
put on my stockings. We'll have to hurry like mischief, 'cause
I don't think Gail will go back to sleep again."</p>

<p>There was a subdued rustling for a moment or two beyond the dense
hedge, and then the listening man heard the sound of hurrying
footsteps in the road, and the children vanished without his having
caught a glimpse of them. But he was now thoroughly awake, and
as soon as the steps died away in the distance, he rose from his
bed among the leaves, shook out his gray blankets, rolled and
strapped them into a bundle, threw them under the overhanging
shrubbery, and slowly made way through the trees to a wide, sparkling
creek, whose tumbling waters made sweet music in the woods.</p>

<p>"What a glorious scene this is," he murmured aloud, gazing in
rapt admiration at the wooded hills, the singing stream, the bright
flowers. "Why can't we be content to live in such places instead
of building great, smoky, sooty cities? You little creek, you
sang me to sleep last night. Wish I could take you back home with
me. What a pretty flower! Little bird, you will split your throat
if you try to pour out all your melody at once. Better give us
a little at a time. Of course you are happy! Who wouldn't be on
such a wonderful day? Oh, what sentiments for a tramp! Campbell,
have you forgotten what you are?"</p>

<p>He was near the road now, and suddenly a baby voice piped shrilly,
"Yes, here is the bridge and there is the sun. Oh, just look at
the sun! It's way up high now. Ain't it big and fiery?"</p>

<p>"S'posing it was a frying-pan," spoke up a second voice, which
the startled tramp recognized as belonging to Peace; "and we could
have all the buckwheat cakes it would cook. My! wouldn't that
be nice?"</p>

<p>They came slowly into view through the shrubbery,&mdash;three queer,
dripping little figures, with hair flying, dresses wet and rumpled,
shoes soaked and muddy, but literally loaded down with masses
of late columbine and sweet wood violets. And they made a pretty
picture with their bright, rosy faces and excited, sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>The tramp, in the shadow of the trees, caught his breath sharply,
then laughed to himself at Peace's supposition and Cherry's horrified
exclamation, "Why, Peace Greenfield, what ever put such a crazy
idea into your head?&mdash;supposing the sun was a frying pan?"</p>

<p>"I bet it would make a good one, and I'll bet the cakes would
be dandy, too! Um&mdash;m&mdash;m! I can smell 'em now. I am starving hungry,
and it does take so long for the girls to cook pancakes in our
little frying pan. Hurry up! It must be breakfast time already.
I wish I had wings to fly home with. S'posing we were birds, we
would be there in a jiffy."</p>

<p>"Let's play we were," suggested Allee. "That will make the way
seem shorter."</p>

<p>"All right," the sisters assented; and with their great bouquets
flapping wildly in the wind, the trio sped swiftly out of sight
up the road, leaving the tramp again to his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Pancakes! Makes me hungry, too. Guess I better wash and be moving
on in search of a breakfast. I wonder if those youngsters live
near here."</p>

<p>He knelt beside the clear stream and ducked his head again and
again in the cool water, finally drying his face on a clean handkerchief,
and running his fingers through his bushy gray hair in place of
a comb. His toilet done, he set out briskly down road the children
had taken, whistling under his breath, and keeping a careful lookout
for farmhouses on the way.</p>

<p>At the first place he approached, the watchful housewife had
loosed a vicious-looking bulldog, and the tramp wisely passed
by without stopping. The next house was deserted, the door of
the third place was slammed in his face before he could even make
known his wants, and he was beginning to wonder if he must go
breakfastless when a shrill, childish treble rang out clearly
on the still morning air:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'The Campbells are comin' Oho, Oho,<br/>
The Campbells are comin', Oho, Oho.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>So sudden was the discordant burst of song, and so close by,
that the tramp stopped in his tracks and stared in the direction
of the voice.</p>

<p>"Well, of all things! That announcement quite took my breath
away!" he ejaculated, hurrying forward once more. "The voice sounds
like 'S'posing Peace.' I wonder if it can be she."</p>

<p>It was, indeed. Another rod and he found himself in front of
a gate, on the high post of which was perched a diminutive, bare-legged
girl in a soiled, damp frock, superintending the drying of three
pair of mud-covered shoes arranged in a row on the picket fence,
while she issued orders to the two sisters sitting in the middle
of the gravel walk busily sorting flowers.</p>

<p>"As true as you live, I don't believe these shoes will ever be
dry by school time. S'posing we have to go barefooted, and this
the last day of the term! Cherry, you've got too many columbines
in that horn. They look pinched. Put some in Allee's boat."</p>

<p>"Allee's boat?"</p>

<p>"Well, she is fixing it for Miss Truesdale, even if she ain't
a sure-enough scholar yet. Don't make such little, stingy bunches
of violets. We picked plenty. I can't coax your toes to shine,
Cherry. I'm scared that the blacking won't do any good. You shouldn't
have worn your best ones."</p>

<p>"I haven't any others. My old pair is all worn out, and &mdash;Why,
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cherry had caught sight of the shabby figure at the gate, but
before she could finish her sentence, Peace, following the direction
of her eyes, wheeled about on her perch, surveyed the man with
big, almost somber, brown eyes, and poured forth an avalanche
of questions: "Are you a tramp? Do you want some work, or are
you just begging? Can you chop wood? Do you know how to hoe? Are
you hungry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss, I'm hungry," the tramp managed to stammer. "Could
you give me a bite to eat?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you will work for it," was the firm reply. "We don't
b'lieve in feeding beggars, but we are always glad to help the
deserving poor."</p>

<p>The man's shrewd, deep-set eyes twinkled with amusement at her
grown-up tone and manner, but he answered with seeming meekness,
"I will be only too glad to do anything I can for a breakfast&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's wood to be chopped. Gail ain't strong enough to do such
work, and our man is lazy. Reckon we'll let him go as soon as
the garden is in shape. There's a heap of vines to be trained
up on strings 'round the porches, and there are all the flower
beds to be weeded, this grass needs cutting, and the roof of the
hen house has to be fixed so's it won't leak, the hoop has come
off the rain-barrel, the back step is broken, and&mdash;oh, yes, there
are three screens that we can't get on the windows, and Mike never
finds time for them."</p>

<p>Peace stopped for breath, and the tramp took advantage of the
pause to say, "Which one of those jobs will you have me do?"</p>

<p>"Which one?" echoed the child in round-eyed amazement. "Why,
all of them, of course! You don't expect us to give you breakfast
unless you do something to earn it, do you, after I've told you
we never feed beggars?"</p>

<p>"No, miss. I am willing to work. But you better find out what
your ma wants me to do first, so I can begin."</p>

<p>"Mamma's a ninvalid," Peace responded promptly. "But I will ask
Gail. She will know, and, besides, she is cook here."</p>

<p>She leaped nimbly to the ground and disappeared within doors,
where some sort of an argument evidently waged warm and furious
for a time, judging from the sound of voices heard in the garden.
Finally Peace put in appearance again; not the jaunty, self-reliant
young lady who had interviewed the tramp a few moments before,
but a very sober-faced, dejected-looking child, who twisted her
dress into knots with nervous fingers, and at length stammered
in embarrassed tones, "Gail says you can have some breakfast if
you will split a little wood for her first, but she says it is
a nimposition to expect you to do all I said you should. I don't
see why. There's a heap of work around here to be done and no
one but Mike to do it. There! Faith told me not to say anything
about not having any men on the place. Mike is only a boy, you
know, and he doesn't b'long here. We haven't got any&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield!" The voice was sharp with exasperation, and
Peace retired hastily indoors once more, calling back over her
shoulder, "You'll find the ax by the woodpile, if Mike hasn't
got it in the meadow, or it isn't in the shed or the barn. I'll
come out and tell you when to quit. Yes, Faith I <em>am</em> hurrying!
Be sure you cut a lot, 'cause&mdash;" The voice trailed away into indistinctness,
and the tramp, with a smile on his lips, went to hunt up the missing
ax; and soon sharp, ringing blows told the occupants of the house
that he was hard at work.</p>

<p>Rapidly the huge pile of heavy knots diminished in size, and
just as rapidly the heap of split stove-wood grew, while the perspiration
rolled in great beads down the worker's crimson face. At last
he paused a moment to rest his back and wipe the moisture from
his hot forehead, and as he drew his handkerchief down from his
eyes he saw Peace standing before him, holding a platter in her
extended arms while she surveyed the result of his labor with
approving eyes.</p>

<p>"You've done splendid!" she breathed, enthusiastically. "The
last tramp who cut wood for us piled it up so it looked like there
was an awful lot, but after he was gone we found he had heaped
it around a big hole in the middle and there wasn't hardly any
split. Faith said she bet you would do the same way, but I watched
you from the window, while Cherry and me were washing the dishes,
and you never tried to hide a hole in the middle at all. Here
is your breakfast. Gail cooked it, else you wouldn't have got
much. It is Faith's turn to get the meals today, but she is baking
a cake for the minister's reception tonight, and is crosser'n
two sticks, so Gail fixed it.</p>

<p>"You see, we were all through breakfast when you got here, or
you might have had more. I don't know, though, &mdash;Faith says
if she had her way about it, she'd send every single tramp who
comes here marching down the street with the enemy in pursuit.
That means Towzer, but he wouldn't bite anyone. Faith is cross
every time she makes a cake. You might have eaten in the kitchen
if it hadn't been for that. She sends us all out-doors when she
is baking, so's we won't make her cakes fall. She does make fine
things, though! Um! but they are good! Never mind, the kitchen
is hot anyway, but it's nice and cool out here under this maple.
This is my maple. Papa built that bench for me and Allee before
he went to heaven. You can sit on the ground and play the seat
was your table, or you can sit in the seat and hold this platter
in your lap. Which'll you do?"</p>

<p>The tramp smiled broadly, relieved the small maid of her heavy
load, and dropped wearily onto the wide bench, saying gratefully,
"This will do nicely, thank you. What a fine breakfast you have
brought me! Gail must be a good cook. Is she your sister?" As
he spoke, he picked up an egg and carefully broke it on the edge
of his plate.</p>

<p>"Yes, Gail's the oldest of us &mdash;Oh, Mr. Tramp, just see
what you have done! I was afraid Gail hadn't given you breakfast
enough and that you might get hungry before noon, so when she
wasn't looking I put on a whole lot of extra toast and four eggs
and some matches to cook them with, and you've gone and smashed
a <em>raw</em> egg all over everything!"</p>

<p>He stared in dismay at the broken yolk streaming over his creamed
potatoes, and then, seeing the consternation in the big, brown
eyes of his small hostess, he laughed heartily and said, "Never
mind, little girl! I'm hungry enough for even raw eggs this morning.
Doctors often make their patients eat such things. Here goes!"</p>

<p>Peace watched him in silence a moment and then observed, "You
don't look like any tramps we ever had here before. They always
shovel in their food with their knives, but you use your fork.
You can work, too. Why don't you get a job somewhere and earn
some money instead of loafing around begging for your meals?"</p>

<p>The man paused, with his fork half way to his mouth, surprised
at the child's keen observations. Then he answered, lightly, "I
do sometimes, but a feller can't work all the time, can he?"</p>

<p>"Well, most folks have to, though I never could see why they
all can't have vacations like we do at school. This is our last
day until next fall."</p>

<p>"Is that what you and the kids gathered the flowers for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and for the minister's reception tonight. We went early
this morning 'fore the rest of the folks were up; and mercy, but
didn't Faith scold when we got back! She said we ought all of
us to be whipped and sent to bed. Faith is real ugly when she's
making cakes. We did get awfully wet, &mdash;I had no notion it
would be so bad. But we got the flowers anyway. We made some baskets
yesterday out of birch bark and moss. Here comes Allee with them
now. She doesn't go to school yet, but sometimes she visits with
Cherry and me, and today is one of the times. Ain't the baskets
pretty?"</p>

<p>"Scrumptious!" was the admiring answer, as the man clumsily lifted
one of the dainty boats filled with dog-tooth violets and drank
in its perfume with the delight of a child. "What wouldn't city
people give for these little nosegays from the woods! They would
go like hot cakes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked mystified Peace, failing to understand
what connection her beloved flowers could have with hot cakes.</p>

<p>"Why, in big cities, at almost any of the important business
corners, you will see little boys and girls selling sweet peas
and daisies and&mdash;yes, they sometimes sell cowslips and wood violets,
but only in bunches&mdash;never in such cunning little baskets. Why,
tucked down in that damp moss, your flowers will keep fresh for
hours; while a bunch from a city flower-seller's stock withers
as soon as it is taken out of water."</p>

<p>"Would folks in Martindale buy them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! They are a breath from the woods, and lots of people
would be glad to get them. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace Greenfield, it's time to start! Do you want to be late
the last day of school?"</p>

<p>"That's Cherry. I must go. I wish I could stop and talk some
more. When you finish your breakfast, just take the dishes around
to the kitchen steps, and&mdash;if you have time and want to do it&mdash;you
might weed those flower gardens in the front yard and the onion
patch behind the shed. If you don't, I'll have to, and you 'member
I gave you some extra lunch that you wouldn't have got if it hadn't
been for me&mdash;and a few matches. Promise you won't light a fire
till you get a long way from our house, will you? Gail won't give
tramps matches for fear they will set the buildings on fire. And
say, the lawn-mower is right beside the front porch, if you should
happen to want to cut the grass&mdash;just the little piece fenced
in, you know. The rest is for hay. And the ball of twine for stringing
up Hope's vines is stuck in the hole of the porch railing nearest
the door&mdash;you can find it easy enough. The rain barrel is behind
the house, and&mdash;yes, yes, Cherry, I am coming this very minute!
I hope you have liked your nice breakfast, and will come some
other time and split more wood for us. Good-bye, Mr. Tramp, I've
<em>got</em> to go."</p>
