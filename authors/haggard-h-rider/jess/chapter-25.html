<p>John, it will be remembered, left Mooifontein for Pretoria towards the
end of December, and with him went all the life and light of the place.
</p><p>“Dear me, Bessie,” said old Silas Croft on the evening after he had
started, “the house seems very dull without John”--a remark in which
Bessie, who was weeping secretly in the corner, heartily concurred.
</p><p>Then, a few days afterwards, came the news of the investment of
Pretoria, but no news of John. They ascertained that he had passed
Standerton in safety, but beyond that nothing could be heard of him. Day
after day passed, but without tidings, and at last, one evening, Bessie
broke into a passion of hysterical tears.
</p><p>“What did you send him for?” she asked of her uncle. “It was
ridiculous--I knew that it was ridiculous. He could not help Jess or
bring her back; the most that could happen was that they would be both
shut up together. Now he is dead--I know that those Boers have shot
him--and it is all your fault! And if he is dead I will never speak to
you again.”
</p><p>The old man retreated, somewhat dismayed at this outburst, which was not
at all in Bessie’s style.
</p><p>“Ah, well,” he said to himself, “that is the way of women; they turn
into tigers about a man!”
</p><p>There may have been truth in this reflection, but a tiger is not a
pleasant domestic pet, as poor old Silas discovered during the next two
months. The more Bessie thought about the matter the more incensed she
grew because he had sent her lover away. Indeed, in a little while she
quite forgot that she had herself acquiesced in his going. In short, her
temper gave way completely under the strain, so that at last her uncle
scarcely dared to mention John’s name.
</p><p>Meanwhile, things had been going as ill without as within. First of
all--that was the day after John’s departure--two or three loyal
Boers and an English store-keeper from Lake Chrissie, in New Scotland,
outspanned on the place and implored Silas Croft to fly for his life
into Natal while there was yet time. They said that the Boers would
certainly shoot any Englishman who might be sufficiently defenceless.
But the old man would not listen.
</p><p>“I am an Englishman--<u>civis Romanus sum</u>,” he said in his sturdy
fashion, “and I do not believe that they will touch me, who have lived
among them for twenty years. At any rate, I am not going to run away and
leave my place at the mercy of a pack of thieves. If they shoot me they
will have to reckon with England for the deed, so I expect that they
will leave me alone. Bessie can go if she likes, but I shall stop here
and see the row through, and there’s an end of it.”
</p><p>Whereon, Bessie having flatly declined to budge an inch, the loyalists
departed in a hurry, metaphorically wringing their hands at such an
exhibition of ill-placed confidence and insular pride. This little scene
occurred at dinner-time, and after dinner old Silas proceeded to hurl
defiance at his foes in another fashion. Going to a cupboard in his
bedroom, he extracted an exceedingly large Union Jack, and promptly
advanced with it to an open spot between two of the orange-trees in
front of the house, where in such a position that it could be seen for
miles around a flagstaff was planted, formed of a very tall young blue
gum. Upon this flagstaff it was Silas’s habit to hoist the large Union
Jack on the Queen’s birthday, Christmas Day, and other State occasions.
</p><p>“Now, Jantje,” he said, when he had bent on the bunting, “run her up,
and I’ll cheer!” and accordingly, as the broad flag floated out on the
breeze, he took off his hat and waved it, and gave such a “hip, hip,
hoorah!” in his stentorian tones that Bessie ran out from the house to
see what was the matter. Nor was he satisfied with this, but, having
obtained a ladder, he placed it against the post and sent Jantje up
it, instructing him to fasten the rope on which the flag was bent at a
height of about fifteen feet from the ground, so that nobody should get
at it to haul it down.
</p><p>“There,” he said, “I’ve nailed my colours to the mast. That will show
these gentry that an Englishman lives here.
</p><pre>
     “Confound their politics,
     Frustrate their knavish tricks,
     God save the Queen.”</pre>
<p>“Amen,” said Bessie, but she had her doubts about the wisdom of that
Union Jack, which, whenever the wind blew, streamed out, a visible
defiance not calculated to soothe the breasts of excited patriots.
</p><p>Indeed, two days after that, a patrol of three Boers, spying the ensign
whilst yet a long way off, galloped up in hot haste to see what it
meant. Silas saw them coming, and, taking his rifle in his hand, went
and stood beneath the flag, for which he had an almost superstitious
veneration, feeling sure that they would not dare to meddle either with
him or it.
</p><p>“What is the meaning of this, <u>Oom</u> Silas?” asked the leader of the
three men, with all of whom he was perfectly acquainted.
</p><p>“It means that an Englishman lives here, Jan,” was the answer.
</p><p>“Haul the dirty rag down!” said the man.
</p><p>“I will see you damned first!” replied old Silas.
</p><p>Thereon the Boer dismounted and made for the flagstaff, only to find
“Uncle Croft’s” rifle in a direct line with his chest.
</p><p>“You will have to shoot me first, Jan,” he said, and thereon, after some
consultation, they left him and went away.
</p><p>In truth, his British nationality notwithstanding, Silas Croft was
very popular with the Boers, most of whom had known him since they were
children, and to whose <u>Volksraad</u> he had twice been elected. It was to
this personal popularity he owed the fact that he was not turned out of
his house, and forced to choose between serving against his countrymen
or being imprisoned and otherwise maltreated at the very commencement of
the rebellion.
</p><p>For a fortnight or more after this flag episode nothing of any
importance happened, and then came the tidings of the crushing defeat
at Laing’s Nek. At first, Silas Croft would not believe it. “No
general could have been so mad,” he said; but soon the report was amply
confirmed from native sources.
</p><p>Another week passed, and with it came the news of the British defeat
at Ingogo. The first they heard of it was on the morning of February 8,
when Jantje brought a Kafir up to the verandah at breakfast-time. This
Kafir said that he had been watching the fight from a mountain; that
the English were completely hemmed in and fighting well, but that “their
arms were tired,” and they would all be killed at night-time. The
Boers, he said, were not suffering at all--the English could not “shoot
straight.” After hearing this they passed a sufficiently miserable day
and evening. About twelve o’clock that night, however, a native spy
despatched by Mr. Croft returned with the report that the English
general had won safely back to camp, having suffered heavily and
abandoned his wounded, many of whom had died in the rain, for the night
after the battle was wet.
</p><p>Then came another long pause, during which no reliable news reached
them, though the air was thick with rumours, and old Silas was made
happy by hearing that large reinforcements were on their way from
England.
</p><p>“Ah, Bessie, my dear, they will soon sing another song now,” he said
in great glee; “and what’s more, it’s about time they did. I can’t
understand what the soldiers have been about--I can’t indeed.”
</p><p>And so the time wore heavily along till at last there came a dreadful
day, which Bessie will never forget so long as she lives. It was the
20th of February--just a week before the final disaster at Majuba Hill.
Bessie was standing idly on the verandah, looking down the long avenue
of blue gums, where the shadows formed a dark network to catch the
wandering rays of light. The place looked very peaceful, and certainly
no one could have known from its appearance that a bloody war was being
waged within a few miles. The Kafirs came and went about their work as
usual, or made pretence to; but now and then a close observer might see
them stop, look towards the Drakensberg, and then say a few words to
their neighbour about the wonderful thing which had come to pass, that
the Boers were beating the great white people, who came out of the sea
and shook the earth with their tread. Whereon the neighbour would take
the opportunity to relax from toil, squat down, have a pinch of snuff,
and relate in what particular collection of rocks on the hillside he and
his wives slept the last night--for when the Boers are out on commando
the Kafirs will not sleep in their huts for fear of being surprised and
shot down. Then the pair would spend half an hour or so in speculating
on what would be their fate when the Boer had eaten up the Englishman
and taken back the country, and finally come to the conclusion that they
had better emigrate to Natal.
</p><p>Bessie, on the verandah, noted all this going on, every now and again
catching snatches of the lazy rascals’ talk, which chimed in but too
sadly with her own thoughts. Turning from them impatiently, she began
to watch the hens marching solemnly about the drive, followed by their
broods. This picture, also, had a sanguinary background, for under an
orange-tree two rival cocks were fighting furiously. They always did
this about once a week, nor did they cease from troubling till each
retired, temporarily blinded, to the shade of a separate orange-tree,
where they spent the rest of the week in recovering, only to emerge when
the cure was effected and fight their battle over again. Meanwhile, a
third cock, young in years but old in wisdom, who steadily refused to
retaliate when attacked, looked after the hens in dispute. To-day the
fray was particularly ferocious, and, fearing that the combatants would
have no eyes left at all if she did not interfere, Bessie called to the
old Boer hound who was lying in the sun on the verandah.
</p><p>“Hi, Stomp, Stomp--hunt them, Stomp!”
</p><p>Up jumped Stomp and made a prodigious show of furiously attacking the
embattled cocks; it was an operation to which he was used, and which
afforded him constant amusement. Suddenly, however, as he dashed towards
the trees, the dog stopped midway, his simulated wrath ceased, and
instead of it, an expression of real disgust grew upon his honest face.
Then the hair along his backbone stood up like the quills upon the
fretful porcupine, and he growled.
</p><p>“A strange Kafir, I expect,” said Bessie to herself.
</p><p>Stomp hated strange Kafirs. She had scarcely uttered the words
before they were justified by the appearance of a native. He was a
villainous-looking fellow, with one eye, and nothing on but a ragged
pair of trousers fastened round the middle with a greasy leather strap.
In his wool, however, were stuck several small distended bladders such
as are generally worn by medicine-men and witch-doctors. With his left
hand he held a long stick, cleft at one end, and in the cleft was a
letter.
</p><p>“Come here, Stomp,” said Bessie, and as she spoke a wild hope shot
across her heart like a meteor across the night: perhaps the letter was
from John.
</p><p>The dog obeyed her unwillingly enough, for evidently he did not like
that Kafir; and when he saw that Stomp was well out of the way the
Kafir himself followed. He was an insolent fellow, and took no notice of
Bessie before squatting himself down upon the drive in front of her.
</p><p>“What is it?” said Bessie in Dutch, her lips trembling as she spoke.
</p><p>“A letter,” answered the man.
</p><p>“Give it to me.”
</p><p>“No, missie, not till I have looked at you to see if it is right. Light
yellow hair that curls--<u>one</u>,” checking it on his fingers, “yes, that
is right; large blue eyes--<u>two</u>, that is right; big and tall, and fair
as a star--yes, the letter is for you, take it,” and he poked the long
stick almost into her face.
</p><p>“Where is it from?” asked Bessie, with sudden suspicion and recoiling a
step.
</p><p>“Wakkerstroom last.”
</p><p>“Who is it from?”
</p><p>“Read it, and you will see.”
</p><p>Bessie took the letter, which was wrapped in a piece of old newspaper,
from the cleft of the stick and turned it over and over doubtfully. Most
of us have a mistrust of strange-looking letters, and this letter was
unusually strange. To begin it, with had no address whatever on the
dirty envelope, which seemed curious. In the second place, that envelope
was sealed, apparently with a threepenny bit.
</p><p>“Are you sure it is for me?” asked Bessie.
</p><p>“Yah, yah--sure, sure,” answered the native, with a rude laugh. “There
are not many such white girls in the Transvaal. I have made no
mistake. I have ‘smelt you out.’” And he began to go through his
catalogue--“Yellow hair that curls,” &amp;c.--again.
</p><p>Then Bessie opened the letter. Inside was an ordinary sheet of paper
written over in a bold, firm, yet slightly unpractised writing that she
knew well enough, and the sight of which filled her with a presentiment
of evil. It was Frank Muller’s.
</p><p>She turned sick and cold, but could not choose but read as follows:
</p>
<p>“Camp, near Pretoria. 15 February.
</p><p>“Dear Miss Bessie,--I am sorry to have to write to you, but though we
have quarrelled lately, and also your good uncle, I think it my duty to
do so, and send this to your hand by a special runner. Yesterday was
a sortie made by the poor folk in Pretoria, who are now as thin with
hunger as the high veldt oxen just before spring. Our arms were again
victorious; the redcoats ran away and left their ambulance in our hands,
carrying with them many dead and wounded. Among the dead was the Captain
Niel----”
</p>
<p>Here Bessie uttered a sort of choking cry, and let the letter fall
over the verandah, to one of the posts of which she clung with both her
hands.
</p><p>The ill-favoured native below grinned, and, picking the paper up, handed
it to her.
</p><p>She took it, feeling that she must know all, and read on like one reads
in some ghastly dream:
</p><p>“who has been staying on your uncle’s farm. I did not see him killed
myself, but Jan Vanzyl shot him, and Roi Dirk Oosthuizen, and Carolus, a
Hottentot, saw them pick him up and carry him away. They say that he was
quite dead. For this I fear you will be sorry, as I am, but it is
the chance of war, and he died fighting bravely. Make my obedient
compliments to your uncle. We parted in anger, but I hope in the new
circumstances that have arisen in the land to show him that I, for one,
bear no anger.--Believe me, dear Miss Bessie, your humble and devoted
servant,
</p><p>“Frank Muller.”
</p>
<p>Bessie thrust the letter into the pocket of her dress, then again she
caught hold of the verandah post, and supported herself by it, while the
light of the sun appeared to fade visibly out of the day before her eyes
and to replace itself by a cold blackness in which there was no break.
He was dead!--her lover was dead! The glow had gone from her life as it
seemed to be going from the day, and she was left desolate. She had
no knowledge of how long she stood thus, staring with wide eyes at the
sunshine she could not see. She had lost her count of time; things were
phantasmagorical and unreal; all that she could realise was this one
overpowering, crushing fact--John was dead!
</p><p>“Missie,” said the ill-favoured messenger below, fixing his one eye upon
her poor sorrow-stricken face, and yawning.
</p><p>There was no answer.
</p><p>“Missie,” he said again, “is there any answer? I must be going. I want
to get back in time to see the Boers take Pretoria.”
</p><p>Bessie looked at him vaguely. “Yours is a message that needs no answer,”
 she said. “What is, is.”
</p><p>The brute laughed. “No, I can’t take a letter to the Captain,” he said;
“I saw Jan Vanzyl shoot him. He fell <u>so</u>,” and suddenly he collapsed
all in a heap on the path, in imitation of a man struck dead by a
bullet. “I can’t take <u>him</u> a message, missie,” he went on, rising, “but
one day you will be able to go and look for him yourself. I did not mean
that; what I meant was that I could take a letter to Frank Muller. A
live Boer is better than a dead Englishman; and Frank Muller will make
a fine husband for any girl. If you shut your eyes you won’t know the
difference.”
</p><p>“Go!” said Bessie, in a choked voice, and pointing her hands towards the
avenue.
</p><p>Such was the suppressed energy in her tone that the man sprang to his
feet, and while he rose, interpreting her gesture as an encouragement to
action, the old dog, Stomp, who had been watching him all the time, and
occasionally giving utterance to a low growl of animosity, flew straight
at his throat from the verandah. The dog, which was a heavy one, struck
the man full in the chest and knocked him backwards. Down came dog and
man on the drive together, and then ensued a terrible scene, the man
cursing and shrieking and striking out at the dog, and the dog worrying
the man in a fashion that he was not liable to forget for the remainder
of his life.
</p><p>Bessie, whose energy seemed again to be exhausted, took absolutely
no notice of the fray, and it was at this juncture that her old uncle
arrived upon the scene, together with two Kafirs--the same whom Bessie
had seen idling.
</p><p>“Hullo! hullo!” he halloed in his stentorian tones, “what is all this
about? Get off, you brute!” and what between his voice and the blows
of the Kafirs the dog was persuaded to let go his hold of the man, who
staggered to his feet, severely mauled, and bleeding from half a dozen
bites.
</p><p>For a moment he did not say anything, but picked up his sticks. Then,
however, having first made sure that the dog was being held by the
Kafirs, he turned, his face streaming with blood, his one eye blazing
with fury, and, shaking both his clenched fists at poor Bessie, broke
into a scream of cursing.
</p><p>“You shall pay for this--Frank Muller shall make you pay for it. I am
his servant. I----”
</p><p>“Get out of this, however you are,” thundered old Silas, “or by Heaven
I will let the dog on you again!” and he pointed to Stomp, who was
struggling wildly with the two Kafirs.
</p><p>The man paused and looked at the dog, then, with a final shake of the
fist, he departed at a run down the avenue, turning once only to look if
the dog were coming.
</p><p>With empty eyes Bessie watched him go, taking no more notice of him
than she had of the noise of the fighting. Then, as though struck by a
thought, she turned and went into the sitting-room.
</p><p>“What is all this, Bessie?” said her uncle, following her. “What does
the man mean about Frank Muller?”
</p><p>“It means, uncle dear,” she said at last, in a voice that was something
between a sob and a laugh, “that I am a widow before I am married. John
is dead!”
</p><p>“Dead! dead!” said the old man, putting his hand to his forehead and
turning round in a dazed sort of fashion, “John dead!”
</p><p>“Read the letter,” said Bessie, handing him Frank Muller’s missive.
</p><p>The old man took and read it. His hand shook so much that he was a long
while in mastering its contents.
</p><p>“Good God!” he said at last, “what a blow! My poor Bessie,” and he
drew her into his arms and kissed her. Suddenly a thought struck him.
“Perhaps it is all one of Frank Muller’s lies,” he said, “or perhaps he
made a mistake.”
</p><p>But Bessie did not answer. For the time, at any rate, hope had left her.
