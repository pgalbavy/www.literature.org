<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Theophrastus stood on the table and gazed sheepishly round the
empty tent. His fine ardour was extinguished.</p>

<p>But I take up the narrative in the words of his memoirs:</p>

<p>"I found myself on the table," he writes, "in the middle of the
broken crockery, and all the company fled. My guests' rough fashion
of taking leave of me had confused me a little. I wished to get
down, but by a singular phenomenon, I found as much difficulty
in getting down from the table as I had displayed address in mounting
it. I went down on my hands and knees; and by dint of the most
careful precautions reached the ground safely. I called Marceline,
who did not answer; and presently I found her trembling in our
bedroom. I shut the door carefully and set about explaining matters.
Her appealing eyes, full of tears, demanded an explanation; and
I felt it my duty as a husband to hide from her no longer my great
and amazing trouble of mind.</p>

<p>"'My dear Marceline,' I said, 'you must be entirely at a loss
to understand what happened this evening; but never mind, I don't
understand it myself. Still, by putting our heads together, reinforced
by our love for one another, I do not despair of arriving at the
correct explanation of it.'</p>

<p>"Then I coaxed her to go to bed; and when at last her head rested
peacefully on the pillow, I told her my story. I gave her a complete
account of my visit to the cellars of the Conciergerie, concealing
nothing, and describing exactly the extraordinary feelings which
troubled me and the unknown force which appeared to control me.
At first she said nothing; in fact she seemed to shrink away from
me as if she were frightened of me; but when I came to the document
in the wall which revealed the existence of the treasures, at
once she asked to see it.</p>

<p>"I took it from my pocket-book, and showed it to her by the light
of the moon, which was at its full. Like myself, like all who
had already seen it, she recognised my handwriting; and crossed
herself for all the world as if she suspected something diabolical
in it.</p>

<p>"However the sight of the document seemed to relieve her; and
at once she said that it was most fortunate that we had at hand
an expert in Spiritualism, that Adolphe would be of the greatest
service to us in this difficult matter. We had the paper on the
bed before us in the moonlight; and in the presence of this unshakable
witness, she was presently compelled to admit that I was a reincarnated
soul dating from two hundred years before.</p>

<p>"Then, as I was once more asking who I could have been, she annoyed
me for the first time since our marriage.</p>

<p>"'Poor Theophrastus, you couldn't have been up to much,' she
said.</p>

<p>"'And why not?' I said sharply, for I was nettled.</p>

<p>"'Because, dear, this evening you sang a song in slang; and the
ladies whose names you mentioned certainly couldn't have belonged
to the Aristocracy. When one associates with the Slapper, the
Lock, and Manon of Versailles, one can't be up to much.'</p>

<p>"She said this in a tone of contempt which I put down to jealousy.</p>

<p>"'But I also spoke of La Mar√©chale de Boufflers,' I said again
rather sharply. 'And you ought to know that in the time of the
Regent all the ladies of the Court had some queer nickname. It's
my belief, on the contrary, that I was a man of quality&mdash;what
do you say to a favourite of the Regent?'</p>

<p>"I spoke rather huffily; and she gave me a kiss, and admitted
that there was a good deal in what I said.</p>

<p>"The next morning she repeated her suggestion that we should
take Adolphe into our confidence. She declared that his wide experience
in these matters and his profound knowledge of metaphysics could
not but be of the greatest help to a man who had buried treasures
two hundred years ago and wished to recover them.</p>

<p>"'You'll see, dear, that he's the man who'll tell you what your
name was,' she said.</p>

<p>"I yielded to her persuasion; and as we sat in the garden after
lunch, I explained to him the inner meaning of the strange occurrence
of the evening before. I took him back from the song to the document,
from the document to the Conciergerie, watching the effect of
the astonishing revelation on the expression of his face. It was
clear that he was utterly astounded; and it appeared to me very
odd that a professed Spiritualist should be so flabbergasted at
finding himself face to face with a retired man of business, sound
in mind and body, who claimed to have existed two hundred years
before. He said that my behaviour at yesterday's dinner and the
incomprehensible phrases to which I had given utterance at the
Conciergerie were indeed calculated to prepare him for such a
confidence, but as a matter of fact he had not been expecting
anything of the kind, and was entirely nonplussed. He would like
to have actually in his hand the proofs of such a phenomenon.</p>

<p>"I took out my document and handed it to him. He could not deny
its authenticity; he recognised the handwriting. Indeed that recognition
drew a sharp explanation from him; and I asked him the reason
of it. He answered that my handwriting on a document two hundred
years old explained a heap of things.</p>

<p>"'What things?' I said.</p>

<p>"He confessed loyally that till that moment he had never understood
my handwriting and that it had always been impossible for him
to see any connection between it and my character.</p>

<p>"'Is that so?' I said. 'And what is your conception of my character,
Adolphe?'</p>

<p>"'Well, you won't be angry, if I'm frank with you?' he said,
hesitating.</p>

<p>"'Of course not,' I said.</p>

<p>"On this assurance he described my character: it was that of
a worthy business man, an honest merchant, an excellent husband,
but of a man incapable of displaying any firmness, strength of
mind, or energy. He went on to say that my timidity was excessive,
and that my kindness of heart, to which he was fully alive, was
always apt to degenerate into sheer feebleness.</p>

<p>"It was not a flattering portrait; and it made me blush for myself.</p>

<p>"'And now,' said I, hiding my mortification, 'you've told me
what you think of my character: what do you think of my handwriting?'</p>

<p>"'It's the exact opposite of your character,' he said quickly.
'It expresses every sentiment utterly opposed to your nature as
I know it. In fact, I can't think of a more direct antithesis
than your character and your handwriting. It must be, then, that
you haven't the handwriting which goes with your actual character,
but the handwriting of the Other.'</p>

<p>"I might have been angry, if Signor Petito had not told me much
the same thing; as it was, I exclaimed, 'Oh, this is very interesting!
The Other, then, was a man of energy?'</p>

<p>"I thought to myself that the Other must have been some great
leader. Then Adolphe went on; and as long as I live I shall never
forget his words, so painful did I find them:</p>

<p>"'Everything shows, these thin strokes, the way they are joined
to one another, their manner of rising, mounting, topping one
another, energy, strength of will, pigheadedness, harshness, ardour,
activity, ambition... for evil.'</p>

<p>"I was dismayed; but in a flash of genius I cried:</p>

<p>"'What is evil? What is good? If Attila had known how to write,
he might have had the handwriting of Napoleon!'</p>

<p>"'Attila was called "the flail of God,"' he said.</p>

<p>"'And Napoleon was the flail of men,' I retorted on the instant.</p>

<p>"I was hard put to it to restrain my anger; but I asserted that
<em>Theophrastus Longuet could only be an honest man before this
life, during this life, and after this life</em>.</p>

<p>"My dear wife agreed with me, warmly. Adolphe saw that he had
gone too far, and apologised."</p>
