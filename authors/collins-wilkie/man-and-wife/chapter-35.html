<P>
THE promise of the weather-glass was fulfilled. The sun shone on
Blanche's marriage.
<P>
At nine in the morning the first of the proceedings of the day
began. It was essentially of a clandestine nature. The bride and
bridegroom evaded the restraints of lawful authority, and
presumed to meet together privately, before they were married, in
the conservatory at Ham Farm.
<P>
"You have read my letter, Arnold?"
<P>
"I have come here to answer it, Blanche. But why not have told
me? Why write?"
<P>
"Because I put off telling you so long; and because I didn't know
how you might take it; and for fifty other reasons. Never mind!
I've made my confession. I haven't a single secret now which is
not your secret too. There's time to say No, Arnold, if you think
I ought to have no room in my heart for any body but you. My
uncle tells me I am obstinate and wrong in refusing to give Anne
up. If you agree with him, say the word, dear, before you make me
your wife."
<P>
"Shall I tell you what I said to Sir Patrick last night?"
<P>
"About _this?_"
<P>
"Yes. The confession (as you call it) which you make in your
pretty note, is the very thing that Sir Patrick spoke to me about
in the dining-room before I went away. He told me your heart was
set on finding Miss Silvester. And he asked me what I meant to do
about it when we were married."
<P>
"And you said--?"
<P>
Arnold repeated his answer to Sir Patrick, with fervid
embellishments of the original language, suitable to the
emergency. Blanche's delight expressed itself in the form of two
unblushing outrages on propriety, committed in close succession.
She threw her arms round Arnold's neck; and she actually kissed
him three hours before the consent of State and Church sanctioned
her in taking that proceeding. Let us shudder--but let us not
blame her. These are the consequences of free institutions
<P>
"Now," said Arnold, "it's my turn to take to pen and ink. I have
a letter to write before we are married as well as you. Only
there's this difference between us--I want you to help me."
<P>
"Who are you going to write to?"
<P>
"To my lawyer in Edinburgh. There will be no time unless I do it
now. We start for Switzerland this afternoon--don't we?'
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Very well. I want to relieve your mind, my darling before we go.
Wouldn't you like to know--while we are away--that the right
people are on the look-out for Miss Silvester? Sir Patrick has
told me of the last place that she has been traced to--and my
lawyer will set the right people at work. Come and help me to put
it in the proper language, and the whole thing will be in train."
<P>
"Oh, Arnold! can I ever love you enough to reward you for this!"
<P>
"We shall see, Blanche--in Switzerland."
<P>
They audaciously penetrated, arm in arm, into Sir Patrick's own
study--entirely at their disposal, as they well knew, at that
hour of the morning. With Sir Patrick's pens and Sir Patrick's
paper they produced a letter of instructions, deliberately
reopening the investigation which Sir Patrick's superior wisdom
had closed. Neither pains nor money were to be spared by the
lawyer in at once taking measures (beginning at Glasgow) to find
Anne. The report of the result was to be addressed to Arnold,
under cover to Sir Patrick at Ham Farm. By the time the letter
was completed the morning had advanced to ten o'clock. Blanche
left Arnold to array herself in her bridal splendor--after
another outrage on propriety, and more consequences of free
institutions.
<P>
The next proceedings were of a public and avowable nature, and
strictly followed the customary precedents on such occasions.
<P>
Village nymphs strewed flowers on the path to the church door
(and sent in the bill the same day). Village swains rang the
joy-bells (and got drunk on their money the same evening). There
was the proper and awful pause while the bridegroom was kept
waiting at the church. There was the proper and pitiless staring
of all the female spectators when the bride was led to the altar.
There was the clergyman's preliminary look at the license--which
meant official caution. And there was the clerk's preliminary
look at the bridegroom--which meant official fees. All the women
appeared to be in their natural element; and all the men appeared
to be out of it.
<P>
Then the service began--rightly-considered, the most terrible,
surely, of all mortal ceremonies--the service which binds two
human beings, who know next to nothing of each other's natures,
to risk the tremendous experiment of living together till death
parts them--the service which says, in effect if not in words,
Take your leap in the dark: we sanctify, but we don't insure, it!
<P>
The ceremony went on, without the slightest obstacle to mar its
effect. There were no unforeseen interruptions. There were no
ominous mistakes.
<P>
The last words were spoken, and the book was closed. They signed
their names on the register;  the husband was congratulated; the
wife was embraced. They went back aga in to the house, with more
flowers strewn at their feet. The wedding-breakfast was hurried;
the wedding-speeches were curtailed: there was no time to be
wasted, if the young couple were to catch the tidal train.
<P>
In an hour more the carriage had whirled them away to the
station, and the guests had given them the farewell cheer from
the steps of the house. Young, happy, fondly attached to each
other, raised securely above all the sordid cares of life, what a
golden future was theirs! Married with the sanction of the Family
and the blessing of the Church--who could suppose that the time
was coming, nevertheless, when the blighting question would fall
on them, in the spring-time of their love: Are you Man and Wife?
