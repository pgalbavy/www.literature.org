<p>Instead of a puzzled accountant Jerry found in the bare upper room the
rosy-faced, white-haired man who had given him credentials when he
first arrived in the hills, and who kept the store over on Big Ivy.
</p>
<p>"I come over hyar on my way ter Knoxville ter lay me in a stock of
winter goods," volunteered the storekeeper, "an' I 'lowed I'd tarry an'
hev speech with ye afore I fared any further on." As he spoke he tilted
back his chair, and thrust his hands deep into his pockets.
</p><p>Henderson lifted his brows in interrogation and the storekeeper
proceeded with deliberate emphasis.
</p><p>"Somebody, I hain't found out jest who--aims ter hev ye lay-wayed on
yore trip acrost ther mounting. I felt obleeged ter warn ye."
</p><p>"Have me way-laid," repeated Jerry blankly, "what for?"
</p><p>Uncle Israel shook his silvery poll. "I hain't hardly got ther power
ter answer thet," he said, "but thar's right-smart loose talk goin'
round. Some folks laments thet ye 'lowed ter teach profitable farmin'
an' ye hain't done nothin'. They 'lows ye must hev some crooked projeck
afoot. This much is all I jedgmatic'lly knows, Joe Campbell was over
ter Hook Brewer's blind tiger, on Skinflint, last week. Some fellers
got ter drinkin' an' talkin' aimless-like an' yore name come up.
Somebody 'lowed thet yore tarryin' hyar warn't a-goin' ter be tolerated
no longer, an' thet he knowed of a plan ter git ye es ye crossed ther
mounting whilst Lone Stacy an' Bear Cat was both away. Joe, bein' a
kinsman of mine an' Lone's, told me. Thet's all I knows, but ef I was
you I wouldn't disregard hit."
</p><p>"What would you advise, Uncle Israel?"
</p><p>"Does ye plumb pi'ntedly <u>hev</u> ter go over thar? Ye couldn't jest
linger hyar in town twell ther night train pulls out an' go away on
hit?"
</p><p>Henderson shook his head with a sharp snap of decisiveness. "No, I'm
not ready to be scared away just yet by enemies that threaten me from
ambush. I mean to cross the mountain."
</p><p>For a moment the old storekeeper chewed reflectively on the stem of his
pipe, then he nodded his approval and went on:
</p><p>"No, I didn't hardly 'low ye'd submit ter ther likes of thet without no
debate." He lifted a package wrapped in newspaper which lay at his
elbow on the table. "This hyar's one of them new-fangled automatic
pistols and a box of ca'tridges ter fit hit. I reckon ye'd better slip
hit inter yore pocket.... When I started over hyar, I borrowed a mule
from Lone Stacy's house ... hit's at ther liv'ry-stable now an' ye kin
call fer hit an' ride hit back."
</p><p>"I usually go on foot," interrupted Henderson, but Uncle Israel raised
a hand, commanding attention.
</p><p>"I knows thet, but this time hit'll profit ye ter ride ther mule. He's
got calked irons on his feet an' every man knows his tracks in ther
mud.... They won't sca'cely aim ter lay-way yer till ye gits a good
ways out from town, whar ther timber's more la'rely an' wild-like....
Word'll go on ahead of ye by them leetle deestrick telephone boxes thet
ye're comin' mule-back an' they'll 'low ye don't suspicion nothin'.
They will be a-watchin' fer ther mule then ... an' ef ye starts out
within ther hour's time ye kin make hit ter the head of Leetle Ivy by
nightfall."
</p><p>The adviser paused a moment, then went succinctly on.
</p><p>"Hit's from thar on thet ye'll be in peril.... Now when ye reaches some
rocky p'int whar hit won't leave no shoe-track, git down offen ther
critter an' hit him a severe whack.... Thet mule will go straight on
home jest as stiddy es ef ye war still ridin' him ... whilst <u>you</u>
turns inter ther la'rel on foot an' takes a hike straight across ther
roughs. Hit's ther roads they'll be watchin' an' <u>you</u> won't be on no
road."
</p><p>Jerry Henderson rose briskly from his chair. "Uncle Israel," he said
feelingly, "I reckon I don't have to say I'm obliged to you. The
quicker the start I get now, the better."
</p><p>The old man settled back again with leisurely calm. "Go right on yore
way, son, an' I'll tarry hyar a spell so nairy person won't connect my
goin'-out with your'n."
</p><p>As he passed the cashier's grating Henderson nodded to Black Tom
Carmichael.
</p><p>"Does ye aim ter start acrost ther mounting?" politely inquired the
chief lieutenant of Kinnard Towers, and Jerry smiled.
</p><p>"Yes, I'm going to the livery stable right now to get Lone Stacy's
mule."
</p><p>"I wishes ye a gay journey then," the henchman assured him, using the
stereotyped phrase of well-wishing, to the wayfarer.
</p><p>Gorgeous was the flaunting color of autumn as Henderson left the edges
of the ragged town behind him. He drank in the spicy air that swept
across the pines, and the beauty was so compelling that for a time his
danger affected him only as an intoxicating sort of stimulant under
whose beguiling he reared air-castles. It would be, he told himself,
smiling with fantastic pleasure, a delectable way to salvage the hard
practicalities of life if he could have a home here, presided over by
Blossom, and outside an arena of achievement. In the market-places of
modern activity, he could then win his worldly triumphs and return here
as to a quiet haven. One phase would supply the plaudits of CÃ¦sar--and
one the tranquil philosophy of Plato.
</p><p>But with evening came the bite of frost. The same crests that had been
brilliantly colorful began to close in, brooding and sinister, and the
reality of his danger could no longer be disavowed.
</p><p>Twilight brought the death of all color save the lingering lemon of the
afterglow, and now he had come to the head of Little Ivy, where Uncle
Israel had said travel would become precarious. Here he should abandon
his mule and cut across the tangles, but a little way ahead lay a disk
of pallid light in the general choke of the shadows--a place where the
creek had spread itself into a shallow pool across the road. The hills
and woods were already merged into a gray-blue silhouette, but the
water down there still caught and clung to a remnant of the afterglow
and dimly showed back the inverted counterparts of trees which were
themselves lost to the eye.
</p><p>He might as well cross that water dry-shod, he reflected, and dismount
just beyond.
</p><p>But, suddenly, he dragged hard at the bit and crouched low in his
saddle. He had seen a reflection which belonged neither to fence nor
roadside sapling. Inverted in the dim and oblong mirror of the pool he
made out the shoulders and head of a man with a rifle thrust forward.
That up-side-down figure was so ready of poise that only one conclusion
was feasible. The human being who stood so mirrored did not realize
that he was close enough to the water's line to be himself revealed,
but he was watching for another figure to be betrayed by the same
agency. Henderson slid quietly from his saddle and jabbed the mule's
flank with the muzzle of his pistol. At his back was a thicket into
which he melted as his mount splashed into the water, and he held with
his eyes to the inverted shadow. He saw the rifle rise and bark with a
spurt of flame; heard his beast plunge blunderingly on and then caught
an oath of astonished dismay from beyond the pool, as two inverted
shadows stood where there had been one. "Damn me ef I hain't done shot
acrost an empty saddle!"
</p><p>"Mebby they got him further back," suggested the second voice as Jerry
Henderson crouched in his hiding place. "Mebby Joe tuck up his stand at
ther t'other crossin'."
</p><p>Jerry Henderson smiled grimly to himself. "That was shaving it pretty
thin," he mused. "After all it was only a shadow that saved me."
</p><p>As he lay there unmoving, he heard one of his would-be assassins rattle
off through the dry weed stalks after the lunging mule. The second
splashed through the shallow water and passed almost in arm's length,
but to neither did it occur that the intended victim had left the
saddle at just that point. Ten minutes later, with dead silence about
him, Jerry retreated into the woods and spent the night under a ledge
of shielding rock.
</p><p>He had lived too long in the easy security of cities to pit his
woodcraft against an unknown number of pursuers whose eyes and ears
were more than a match for his own in the dark. Had he known every foot
of the way, night travel would have been safer, but, imperfectly
familiar with the blind trails he meant to move only when he could
gauge his course and pursue it cautiously step by step.
</p><p>From sunrise to dark on the following day he went at the rate of a
half-mile an hour through thickets that lacerated his face and tore the
skin from his hands and wrists. Often he lay crouched close to the
ground, listening.
</p><p>He had no food and dared not show his face at any house, and since he
must avoid well-defined paths, he multiplied the distance so that when
he arrived on the familiar ground of his own neighborhood, his hunger
had become an acute pain and his weariness amounted to exhaustion.
Incidentally, he had slipped once and wrenched his ankle. Within a
radius of two miles were two houses only, Lone Stacy's and Brother
Fulkerson's. The Stacy place would presumably be watched, but Brother
Fulkerson would not deny him food and shelter.
</p><p>Painfully, yard by yard, he crept down the mountainside to the rear of
the preacher's abode. Then on a tour of reconnaissance he cautiously
circled it. There were no visible signs of picketing and through one
unshuttered window came a grateful glow of lamplight.
</p><p>He dared neither knock on the door nor scratch on the pane, but he
remembered the signal that had been Bear Cat Stacy's. He had heard the
boy give it, and now he cautiously repeated, three times, the softly
quavering call of the barn-owl.
</p><p>It was a moonless night, but the stars were frostily clear and as the
refugee crouched, dissolved in shadow, against the mortised logs of the
cabin's corner, the door opened and Blossom stood, slim and straight,
against the yellow background of the lamp-lit door.
</p><p>She might have seemed, to one passing, interested only in the
star-filled skies and the starkly etched peaks, but in a low voice of
extreme guardedness she demanded, "Bear Cat, where air ye?"
</p><p>Henderson remembered that Turner, too, was "hiding out" and that this
girl had the ingrained self-repression of a people inured to the perils
of ambuscade. Without leaving the cancellation of the shadowed wall he
spoke with a caution that equaled her own.
</p><p>"Don't seem to hear me ... just keep looking straight ahead.... It's
not Bear Cat.... It's Henderson ... and they are after me.... So far
I've escaped ... but I reckon they're following." He had seen the
impulsive start with which she heard his announcement and the instant
recovery with which she relaxed her attitude into one of less tell-tale
significance. "Thank God," breathed the pursued man, "for that
self-control!"
</p><p>He detected a heart-wrenching anxiety in her voice, which belied the
picture she made of unruffled simplicity as she commanded in a tense
whisper, "Go on, I'm hearkenin'."
</p><p>"Go back into the house," he directed evenly. "Close the window
shutters ... then open the back door...."
</p><p>She did not obey with the haste of excitement. She was too wise for
that, but paused unhurriedly, humming an ancient ballade, as though the
stresses of life had no meaning for her, before she drew back and
closed the door.
</p><p>Reappearing, at the window, she repeated the same convincing assumption
of untroubled indolence as she drew in the heavy shutters; but a moment
later she stood shaken and blanched of cheek at the rear door. "Come in
hastily," she pleaded. "Air ye hurted?"
</p><p>Slipping through the aperture, Henderson smiled at her. His heart had
leaped wildly as he read the terror of her eyes: a terror for his
danger.
</p><p>"I'm not hurt," he assured her, "except for a twisted ankle, but it's a
miracle of luck. Where's your father?"
</p><p>No actress trained and finished in her art could have carried off with
greater perfection a semblance of tranquillity than had Blossom while
his safety hung in the balance. Now, with that need ended, she leaned
back against the support of the wall with her hands gropingly spread;
weak of knee and limp almost to collapse. Her amber eyes were
preternaturally wide and her words came with gasping difficulty. She
had forgotten her striving after exemplary grammar.
</p><p>"He hain't hyar--he won't be back afore to-morrow noon. Thar hain't
nobody hyar but me."
</p><p>"Oh!" The monosyllable slipped from the man's lips with bitter
disappointment. He knew the rigid tenets of mountain usage--an
unwritten law.
</p><p>A stranger may share a one-roomed shack with men, women and children,
but the traveler who is received into a cabin in the absence of its men
compromises the honor of its women.
</p><p>"Oh," he repeated dejectedly, "I was seekin' shelter for the night. I'm
famishin' an' weary. Kin ye give me a snack to eat. Blossom, afore I
fares forth again?"
</p><p>It was with entire unconsciousness that he had slipped back into the
rough vernacular of his childhood. At that moment he was a man who had
rubbed elbows with death and he had reverted to type as instinctively
as though he had never known any other life.
</p><p>"Afore ye fares forth!" In Blossom's eyes blazed the same Valkyrie fire
that had been in them as she barred his path to Bear Cat Stacy's still.
"Ye hain't a-goin ter fare forth, ter be murdered! I aims ter hide ye
out right hyar!"
</p><p>Civilization just then seemed far away; the primal very near--and, in
that mood, the hot currents of long-denied love for this woman who was
defying her own laws to offer him sanctuary, mounted to supremacy. Such
a love appeared as logical as a little while ago it had seemed
illogical. Eagle blood should mate with eagle blood.
</p><p>"But, little gal," Jerry protested, "ye're alone hyar. I kain't hardly
tarry. Ef hit became known----"
</p><p>"Thet's jest ther reason," she flashed back at him, "thet nobody won't
suspicion ye <u>air</u> hyar an' ef ye're in peril hit don't make no differ
ter me what folks says nohow. I aims ter safeguard ye from harm."
</p><p>His eyes, darkly ringed by fatigue and hunger, held an even deeper
avidity. He looked at the high-chinned and resolute face crowned with
masses of hair which lamp-light and hearth-glow kindled into an aura
and deep into amber eyes that were candid with their confession of
love. Slowly Jerry Henderson put his question--a question already
answered.
</p><p>"I reckon ye knows what this means, Blossom. Why air ye willin' ter
venture hit?"
</p><p>Still leaning tremulously against the chinked wall, she answered with
the thrill of feeling and purpose in her voice.
</p><p>"I hain't askin' what hit means. I hain't keerin' what hit means. All I
knows it thet ye're in peril--an' thet's enough."
</p><p>Jerry caught her in his arms, crushed her to him, felt her lips against
his lips; her arms clinging softly about his neck, and at last he
spoke--no longer with restraint.
</p><p>"Until to-night I've always fought against love and I thought I was
stronger than <u>it</u> was, but I reckon that was just because I've never
really come face-to-face with its full power, before. Now I'm going out
again."
</p><p>"No! No! I won't suffer hit," she protested with fervent vehemence.
"Ye're a-goin' ter stay right hyar. Ye b'longs ter me now an' I aims
ter keep ye--unharmed!"
</p><p>Abruptly they fell silent, warned by some premonitory sense and, as
they stood listening, a clamor of knocking sounded at the door.
</p><p>Thrusting him into her bedroom and screening him behind a mass of
clothing that hung in a small corner closet unenclosed, but deeply
shadowed, she braced herself once more into seeming tranquillity and
went to the front of the house. Then she threw wide the door.
</p><p>"We wants ter hev speech with Brother Fulkerson," came the unrecognized
voice of a stranger whose hat brim shielded his face in the darkness.
</p><p>"He hain't hyar an' he won't be back afore midday ter-morrow,"
responded the girl with ingenuous composure. "I kain't hardly invite ye
in--because I'm hyar all alone," she added with a disarming gravity.
"Will ye leave any message?"
</p><p>Out there among the shadows she heard the murmurs of a whispered
consultation, and despite a palpitation of fear she bravely held the
picture.
</p><p>Then, partly because her manner carried conviction against suspicion,
and partly because to enter would be to reveal identities, the voice
shouted back: "No, thank ye, ma'am. I reckon we'll fare on."
