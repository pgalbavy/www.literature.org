<p>‘He heard me out with his head on one side, and I had another
glimpse through a rent in the mist in which he moved and had his
being. The dim candle spluttered within the ball of glass, and
that was all I had to see him by; at his back was the dark night
with the clear stars, whose distant glitter disposed in retreating
planes lured the eye into the depths of a greater darkness; and
yet a mysterious light seemed to show me his boyish head, as if
in that moment the youth within him had, for a moment, glowed
and expired. "You are an awful good sort to listen like this,"
he said. "It does me good. You don’t know what it is to me. You
don’t" . . . words seemed to fail him. It was a distinct glimpse.
He was a youngster of the sort you like to see about you; of the
sort you like to imagine yourself to have been; of the sort whose
appearance claims the fellowship of these illusions you had thought
gone out, extinct, cold, and which, as if rekindled at the approach
of another flame, give a flutter deep, deep down somewhere, give
a flutter of light . . . of heat! . . . Yes; I had a glimpse of
him then . . . and it was not the last of that kind. . . . "You
don’t know what it is for a fellow in my position to be believed&mdash;make
a clean breast of it to an elder man. It is so difficult&mdash;so awfully
unfair&mdash;so hard to understand."</p>

<p>‘The mists were closing again. I don’t know how old I appeared
to him&mdash;and how much wise. Not half as old as I felt just then;
not half as uselessly wise as I knew myself to be. Surely in no
other craft as in that of the sea do the hearts of those already
launched to sink or swim go out so much to the youth on the brink,
looking with shining eyes upon that glitter of the vast surface
which is only a reflection of his own glances full of fire. There
is such magnificent vagueness in the expectations that had driven
each of us to sea, such a glorious indefiniteness, such a beautiful
greed of adventures that are their own and only reward. What we
get&mdash;well, we won’t talk of that; but can one of us restrain a
smile? In no other kind of life is the illusion more wide of reality&mdash;in
no other is the beginning <em>all</em> illusion&mdash;the disenchantment
more swift&mdash;the subjugation more complete. Hadn’t we all commenced
with the same desire, ended with the same knowledge, carried the
memory of the same cherished glamour through the sordid days of
imprecation? What wonder that when some heavy prod gets home the
bond is found to be close; that besides the fellowship of the
craft there is felt the strength of a wider feeling&mdash;the feeling
that binds a man to a child. He was there before me, believing
that age and wisdom can find a remedy against the pain of truth,
giving me a glimpse of himself as a young fellow in a scrape that
is the very devil of a scrape, the sort of scrape greybeards wag
at solemnly while they hide a smile. And he had been deliberating
upon death&mdash;confound him! He had found that to meditate about
because he thought he had saved his life, while all its glamour
had gone with the ship in the night. What more natural! It was
tragic enough and funny enough in all conscience to call aloud
for compassion, and in what was I better than the rest of us to
refuse him my pity? And even as I looked at him the mists rolled
into the rent, and his voice spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>‘"I was so lost, you know. It was the sort of thing one does
not expect to happen to one. It was not like a fight, for instance."</p>

<p>‘"It was not," I admitted. He appeared changed, as if he had
suddenly matured.</p>

<p>‘"One couldn’t be sure," he muttered.</p>

<p>‘"Ah! You were not sure," I said, and was placated by the sound
of a faint sigh that passed between us like the flight of a bird
in the night.</p>

<p>‘"Well, I wasn’t," he said courageously. "It was something like
that wretched story they made up. It was not a lie&mdash;but it wasn’t
truth all the same. It was something. . . . One knows a downright
lie. There was not the thickness of a sheet of paper between the
right and the wrong of this affair."</p>

<p>‘"How much more did you want?" I asked; but I think I spoke so
low that he did not catch what I said. He had advanced his argument
as though life had been a network of paths separated by chasms.
His voice sounded reasonable.</p>

<p>‘"Suppose I had not &mdash;I mean to say, suppose I had stuck
to the ship? Well. How much longer? Say a minute&mdash;half a minute.
Come. In thirty seconds, as it seemed certain then, I would have
been overboard; and do you think I would not have laid hold of
the first thing that came in my way&mdash;oar, life-buoy, grating&mdash;anything?
Wouldn’t you?"</p>

<p>‘"And be saved," I interjected.</p>

<p>‘"I would have meant to be," he retorted. "And that’s more than
I meant when I" . . . he shivered as if about to swallow some
nauseous drug . . . "jumped," he pronounced with a convulsive
effort, whose stress, as if propagated by the waves of the air,
made my body stir a little in the chair. He fixed me with lowering
eyes. "Don’t you believe me?" he cried. "I swear! . . . Confound
it! You got me here to talk, and . . . You must! . . . You said
you would believe." "Of course I do,"  I protested, in a matter-of-fact
tone which produced a calming effect. "Forgive me," he said. "Of
course I wouldn’t have talked to you about all this if you had
not been a gentleman. I ought to have known . . . I am &mdash;I
am&mdash;a gentleman too . . ." "Yes, yes," I said hastily. He was
looking me squarely in the face, and withdrew his gaze slowly.
"Now you understand why I didn’t after all . . . didn’t go out
in that way. I wasn’t going to be frightened at what I had done.
And, anyhow, if I had stuck to the ship I would have done my best
to be saved. Men have been known to float for hours&mdash;in the open
sea&mdash;and be picked up not much the worse for it. I might have
lasted it out better than many others. There’s nothing the matter
with my heart." He withdrew his right fist from his pocket, and
the blow he struck on his chest resounded like a muffled detonation
in the night.</p>

<p>‘"No," I said. He meditated, with his legs slightly apart and
his chin sunk. "A hair’s-breadth," he muttered. "Not the breadth
of a hair between this and that. And at the time . . ."</p>

<p>‘"It is difficult to see a hair at midnight," I put in, a little
viciously I fear. Don’t you see what I mean by the solidarity
of the craft? I was aggrieved against him, as though he had cheated
me&mdash;me!&mdash;of a splendid opportunity to keep up the illusion of
my beginnings, as though he had robbed our common life of the
last spark of its glamour. "And so you cleared out&mdash;at once."</p>

<p>‘"Jumped," he corrected me incisively. "Jumped&mdash;mind!" he repeated,
and I wondered at the evident but obscure intention. "Well, yes!
Perhaps I could not see then. But I had plenty of time and any
amount of light in that boat. And I could think, too. Nobody would
know, of course, but this did not make it any easier for me. You’ve
got to believe that, too. I did not want all this talk. . . .
No . . . Yes . . . I won’t lie . . . I wanted it: it is the very
thing I wanted&mdash;there. Do you think you or anybody could have
made me if I . . . I am &mdash;I am not afraid to tell. And I
wasn’t afraid to think either. I looked it in the face. I wasn’t
going to run away. At first&mdash;at night, if it hadn’t been for those
fellows I might have . . . No! by heavens! I was not going to
give them that satisfaction. They had done enough. They made up
a story, and believed it for all I know. But I knew the truth,
and I would live it down&mdash;alone, with myself. I wasn’t going to
give in to such a beastly unfair thing. What did it prove after
all? I was confoundedly cut up. Sick of life&mdash;to tell you the
truth; but what would have been the good to shirk it&mdash;in&mdash;in&mdash;that
way? That was not the way. I believe &mdash;I believe it would
have&mdash;it would have ended&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>‘He had been walking up and down, but with the last word he turned
short at me.</p>

<p>‘"What do <em>you</em> believe?" he asked with violence. A pause
ensued, and suddenly I felt myself overcome by a profound and
hopeless fatigue, as though his voice had startled me out of a
dream of wandering through empty spaces whose immensity had harassed
my soul and exhausted my body.</p>

<p>’". . . Would have ended nothing," he muttered over me obstinately,
after a little while. "No! the proper thing was to face it out&mdash;alone
for myself&mdash;wait for another chance&mdash;find out . . ."’</p>
