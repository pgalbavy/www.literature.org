<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p><em>HERBERT </em>noticed, as he went forward, that the fire was
sinking so low as to show that it had not been looked after for
some time. Backed against a bowlder near the spring, it was well
protected from the wind, but had been fanned into a blaze that
must have diffused a good deal of warmth in all directions.</p>

<p>The first mild surprise came to the youth when, on coming close
to the smouldering camp fire, he failed to see Nick. He expected
to find him resting comfortably near at hand, swathed in one of
the thick blankets capable of shutting out every kind of cold
except that of a norther, which will force its way through almost
anything.</p>

<p>Stepping forward into the light of the fire, Herbert looked inquiringly
around in the gloom, and called the name of his friend, repeating
it several times with increasing loudness, but with no more result
than in the first instance. Then the youth started out to investigate
for himself.</p>

<p>The discovery that followed was startling. Not only Nick Ribsam,
but his horse, the two pack animals and the pony belonging to
Herbert, were missing! They were nowhere in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>The youth was knocked almost breathless. He came back beside
the smouldering fire and tried to reason connectedly over the
situation.</p>

<p>"This is ahead of everything yet," he said to himself; "it begins
to look as if all actions are tinged with mystery. Nick and I
couldn’t understand why Strubell and Lattin should act as they
did this afternoon, but I am not half as much mystified over that
as over this. Nick and all the horses gone. What can it mean?"</p>

<p>"All that is left me, besides my weapon," he added with grim
feeling, "is my field glass, but I don’t need that to see what
a fix I’m in, and yet I am more worried about Nick than myself——"</p>

<p>He thought he heard a footfall from the direction of the fork
of the trails. Grasping his Winchester he moved silently back
in the gloom, where he could not be seen by any lurking Indian
or white enemy.</p>

<p>"It is Nick returning," was his thought, as he recognized the
hoofs of an animal.</p>

<p>The next minute his own pony, saddled and bridled, as when he
last saw him, walked forward in the firelight and uttered a faint
whinny of pleasure at sight of his master.</p>

<p>"Heaven bless you!" was the grateful exclamation of Herbert as
he met him and patted his neck; "I feared you were gone for good;
but, Jill, how I wish you could talk that you might tell me all
about Nick and the other horses."</p>

<p>To say the least, the pony had behaved himself in a singular
fashion. I have told how he was driven along by the norther until
he passed beyond the fork in the trails, Nick Ribsam catching
the faint footfalls as he applied his ear to the ground, which
told him the beast was receding.</p>

<p>No doubt there crept into the brain of this sagacious animal
a conviction that he was not doing precisely the right thing in
wandering away from the spot where his master had left him, and
where, of course, he expected to find him on his return.</p>

<p>In addition, the norther, that had brought about this breach
of confidence, subsided to that extent that it was no hardship
to face it. This subsidence, however, did not reach a degree that
suited Jill until he had drifted off for a considerable while.
Then he began edging backward, and, possibly because he divined
the intentions of Herbert, he followed the main trail until he
joined his master at the camp fire.</p>

<p>Among the many extraordinary incidents which attended the tour
of Nick and Herbert through the Southwest, probably there was
none more remarkable than the action of the pony Jill and the
consequences flowing therefrom. He drifted away from the scene
of several singular events and remained absent until they were
finished. Then he came back, and had he been a little later or
earlier, the whole face of history might have been changed—that
is, so far as it related to the youths I have named.</p>

<p>Having regained his pony, Herbert was as much perplexed as ever.
It was an invaluable piece of good fortune thus securing his horse,
for a person on the plains without a good steed is in the situation
of the sailor without boat or ship on the ocean; but he was totally
at a loss how to proceed.</p>

<p>The most obvious course was to stay where he was until morning,
or until some kind of knowledge came to him. The Texans had promised
to join him and Nick by daylight and probably before, and it would
not require them long to decide upon the best line to follow.
If Nick had set out along the lower trail to search for him, he
must have learned of his mistake before this; and, though it was
curious that the friends had not met, the younger ought to return
to his own camp fire whither he had summoned Herbert hours before.</p>

<p>The disquieting factor in the situation was the absence of the
animals, and the return of his own; for Herbert could not be expected
to know all about the action of Jill in his encounter with the
norther.</p>

<p>He soon became satisfied that a long wait was before him. Accordingly,
the saddle and bridle were removed from the pony, that he might
be free to crop the grass within reach, while his owner spent
considerable time in gathering wood with which to keep the fire
going. There was only a small supply of fuel on hand, and this
work was necessary, therefore, on his part.</p>

<p>The weather had moderated to the extent that it was much the
same as before the norther swept through the hills. The blaze
was not needed, except for its aid in dispelling the oppressive
gloom.</p>

<p>Herbert was seated near the fire, and had just looked at his
watch and seen that it was past eleven o’clock, when he was alarmed
by several discharges of rifles. They were dull, but loud enough
to prevent any mistake as to their nature. The direction, too,
was easily recognized as being from the other side of the ridge.</p>

<p>"Nick and I were right," he said, listening with a rapidly beating
heart; "Strubell and Lattin are having a fight with the horse
thieves—there they go again!"</p>

<p>Two reports in rapid succession were heard, and then came a third
and fourth, followed after an interval of several minutes by other
dropping shots. These were noticed, now and then, during the next
hour, after which, so far as Herbert could judge, everything remained
still.</p>

<p>Beyond question, he was right in his belief that a lively scrimmage
had taken place between Bell Rickard, Jim-John the half-breed,
and their companion on one side, and the Texans on the other.
As to the result, no one could tell who was not present, until
some one of the participants was seen.</p>

<p>Though much disturbed by his fear that the cowboys had suffered,
a certain pleasure came to Herbert at this proof of the genuine
hostility between his friends and the rogues. It will be remembered
that he had had troublesome misgivings in this respect. He felt
there had been reason to doubt the honesty of Strubell and Lattin,
and that, despite appearances, an understanding existed between
them and the criminals who were following them so persistently.</p>

<p>The reports of the firearms disproved all this and showed beyond
question that the Texans were good men, ready to defend their
property and the youths with them, no matter how great the risks
to themselves.</p>

<p>Herbert had decided to stay where he was until morning or some
news of his friends reached him, and wait he did through the almost
endless night. Toward daylight, he fell into a dreamful sleep,
which lasted until the sun was above the horizon. Then he started
up and stared around, a minute or two passing before he could
recall all the incidents of the preceding night.</p>

<p>His horse had risen from the ground and was cropping the grass;
the fire had smouldered to ashes, and the clear morning was as
balmy and pleasant as its predecessor. Neither Nick nor the Texans
were in sight; but, determined to find out something for himself,
he hurriedly saddled and bridled his pony and galloped down the
trail.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>He reined up, and raised his field-glass
to his eye.</em>"   Page 149.]</p>

<p>"They promised to be here before this," he said, referring to
Strubell and Lattin; "and they would have kept their word, if
they had the power to do so. One, and perhaps both, have been
killed, or so badly wounded that they cannot leave the battle
ground."</p>

<p>At the forks, the plain was so open to the westward that he reined
up and raised his field glass to his eye. He had detected moving
bodies in the distance, and the first view through the telescope
showed them with great clearness.</p>

<p>A small party of horsemen were moving northward, their animals
on a walk. While studying them closely, Herbert’s attention was
drawn to one in particular. He was riding on the extreme right,
so that he was the nearest to him and was in plain sight.</p>

<p>A brief study of this figure left no doubt of the astounding
fact that he was no other than the missing Nick Ribsam himself!</p>
