<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It was mid-afternoon when they began to pass through that series
of suburbs which the city has flung like a single tentacle northward
for a hundred miles along the eastern banks of the Hudson.</p>

<p>A smooth road of bluestone with a surface like velvet, rarely
broken by badly paved or badly worn sections, ran straight south.
Past mansions standing amid spacious lawns all ablaze with late
summer and early autumn flowers they sped; past parks, long stretches
of walls, high fences of wrought iron through which brief glimpses
of woodlands and splendid gardens caught Rue's eye. And, every
now and then, slowing down to traverse some village square and
emerging from the further limits, the great river flashed into
view, sometimes glassy still under high headlands or along towering
parapets of mountains, sometimes ruffled and silvery where it
widened into bay or inland sea, with a glimmer of distant villages
on the further shore.</p>

<p>Over the western bank a blinding sun hung in a sky without a
cloud&mdash;a sky of undiluted azure; but farther south, and as the
sun declined, traces of vapours from the huge but still distant
city stained the heavens. Gradually the increasing haze changed
from palest lavender and lemon-gold to violet and rose with smouldering
undertones of fire. Beneath it the river caught the stains in
deeper tones, flowing in sombre washes of flame or spreading wide
under pastel tints of turquoise set with purple.</p>

<p>Now, as the sun hung lower, the smoke of every river boat, every
locomotive speeding along the shores below, lay almost motionless
above the water, tinged with the delicate enchantment of declining
day.</p>

<p>And into this magic veil Rue was passing already through the
calm of a late August afternoon, through tree-embowered villages
and towns, the names of which she did not know&mdash;swiftly, inexorably
passing into the iris-grey obscurity where already the silvery
points of arc-lights stretched away into intricate geometrical
designs&mdash;faint traceries as yet sparkling with subdued lustre
under the sunset heavens.</p>

<p>Vast shadowy shapes towered up ahead&mdash;outlying public buildings,
private institutions, industrial plants, bridges of iron and steel,
the ponderous bowed spans of which crossed wildernesses of railroad
tracks or craft-crowded waters.</p>

<p>Two enormous arched viaducts of granite stretched away through
sparkling semi-obscurity &mdash;High Bridge and Washington Bridge.
Then it became an increasing confusion of phantom masses against
a fading sky&mdash;bridges, towers, skyscrapers, viaducts, boulevards,
a wilderness of streets outlined by the growing brilliancy of
electric lamps.</p>

<p>Brandes, deftly steering through the swarming maze of twilight
avenues, turned east across the island, then swung south along
the curved parapets and spreading gardens of Riverside Drive.</p>

<p>Perhaps Brandes was tired; he had become uncommunicative, inclined
to silence. He did point out to her the squat, truncated mass
where the great General slept; called her attention to the river
below, where three grey battleships lay. A bugle call from the
decks came faintly to her ears.</p>

<p>If Rue was tired she did not know it as the car swept her steadily
deeper amid the city's wonders.</p>

<p>On her left, beyond the trees, the great dwellings and apartments
of the Drive were already glimmering with light in every window;
to the right, under the foliage of this endless necklace of parks
and circles, a summer-clad throng strolled and idled along the
river wall; and past them moved an unbroken column of automobiles,
taxicabs, and omnibuses.</p>

<p>At Seventy-second Street they turned to the east across the park,
then into Fifth Avenue south once more. She saw the name of the
celebrated avenue on the street corner, turned to glance excitedly
at Brandes; but his preoccupied face was expressionless, almost
forbidding, so she turned again in quest of other delightful discoveries.
But there was nothing to identify for her the houses, churches,
hotels, shops, on this endless and bewildering avenue of grey
stone; as they swung west into Forty-second Street, she caught
sight of the great marble mass of the Library, but had no idea
what it was.</p>

<p>Into this dusky cañon, aflame with light, they rolled, where
street lamps, the lamps of vehicles, and electric signs dazzled
her unaccustomed eyes so that she saw nothing except a fiery vista
filled with the rush and roar of traffic.</p>

<p>When they stopped, the chauffeur dropped from the rumble and
came around to where a tall head porter in blue and silver uniform
was opening the tonneau door.</p>

<p>Brandes said to his chauffeur:</p>

<p>"Here are the checks. Our trunks are at the Grand Central. Get
them aboard, then come back here for us at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>The chauffeur lifted his hand to his cap, and looked stealthily
between his fingers at Brandes.</p>

<p>"Ten o'clock," he repeated; "very good, sir."</p>

<p>Rue instinctively sought Brandes' arm as they entered the crowded
lobby, then remembered, blushed, and withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>Brandes had started toward the desk with the intention of registering
and securing a room for the few hours before going aboard the
steamer; but something halted him&mdash;some instinct of caution. No,
he would not register. He sent their luggage to the parcels room,
found a maid who took Rue away, then went on through into the
bar, where he took a stiff whisky and soda, a thing he seldom
did.</p>

<p>In the toilet he washed and had himself brushed. Then, emerging,
he took another drink <em>en passant</em>, conscious of an odd,
dull sense of apprehension for which he could not account.</p>

<p>At the desk they told him there was no telephone message for
him. He sauntered over to the news stand, stared at the display
of periodicals, but had not sufficient interest to buy even an
evening paper.</p>

<p>So he idled about the marble-columned lobby, now crowded with
a typical early-autumn throng in quest of dinner and the various
nocturnal amusements which the city offers at all times to the
frequenters of its thousand temples.</p>

<p>Rue came out of the ladies' dressing room, and he went to her
and guided her into the dining-room on the left, where an orchestra
was playing. In her blue, provincial travelling gown the slender
girl looked oddly out of place amid lace and jewels and the delicate
tints of frail evening gowns, but her cheeks were bright with
colour and her grey eyes brilliant, and the lights touched her
thick chestnut hair with a ruddy glory, so that more than one
man turned to watch her pass, and the idly contemptuous indifference
of more than one woman ended at her neck and chin.</p>

<p>What Rue ate she never afterward remembered. It was all merely
a succession of delicious sensations for the palate, for the eye,
for the ear when the excellent orchestra was playing some gay
overture from one of the newer musical comedies or comic operas.</p>

<p>Brandes at times seemed to shake off a growing depression and
rouse himself to talk to her, even jest with her. He smoked cigarettes
occasionally during dinner, a thing he seldom did, and, when coffee
was served, he lighted one of his large cigars.</p>

<p>Rue, excited under an almost childishly timid manner, leaned
on the table with both elbows and linked fingers, listening, watching
everything with an almost breathless intelligence which strove
to comprehend.</p>

<p>People left; others arrived; the music continued. Several times
people passing caught Brandes' eye, and bowed and smiled. He either
acknowledged such salutes with a slight and almost surly nod,
or ignored them altogether.</p>

<p>One of his short, heavy arms lay carelessly along the back of
his chair, where he was sitting sideways looking at the people
in the lobby&mdash;watching with that same odd sensation of foreboding
of which he had been conscious from the first moment he had entered
the city line.</p>

<p>What reason for apprehension he had he could not understand.
Only an hour lay between him and the seclusion of the big liner;
a few hours and he and this girl beside him would be at sea.</p>

<p>Once he excused himself, went out to the desk, and made an inquiry.
But there was no telephone or telegraph message for him; and he
came back chewing his cigar.</p>

<p>Finally his uneasiness drew him to his feet again:</p>

<p>"Rue," he said, "I'm going out to telephone to Mr. Stull. It
may take some little time. You don't mind waiting, do you?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>"Don't you want another ice or something?"</p>

<p>She confessed that she did.</p>

<p>So he ordered it and went away.</p>

<p>As she sat leisurely tasting her ice and watching with unflagging
interest the people around her, she noticed that the dining-room
was already three-quarters empty. People were leaving for café,
theatre, or dance; few remained.</p>

<p>Of these few, two young men in evening dress now arose and walked
toward the lobby, one ahead of the other. One went out; the other,
in the act of going, glanced casually at her as he passed, hesitated,
halted, then, half smiling, half inquiringly, came toward her.</p>

<p>"Jim Neeland!" she exclaimed impulsively. " &mdash;I mean <em>Mr.</em>
Neeland&#11834;" a riot of colour flooding her face. But her eager
hand remained outstretched. He took it, pressed it lightly, ceremoniously,
and, still standing, continued to smile down at her.</p>

<p>Amid all this strange, infernal glitter; amid a city of six million
strangers, suddenly to encounter a familiar face&mdash;to see somebody&mdash;anybody&mdash;from
Gayfield&mdash;seemed a miracle too delightful to be true.</p>

<p>"You are Rue Carew," he said. "I was not certain for a moment.
You know we met only once before."</p>

<p>Rue, conscious of the startled intimacy of her first greeting,
blushed with the memory. But Neeland was a tactful young man;
he said easily, with his very engaging smile:</p>

<p>"It was nice of you to remember me so frankly and warmly. You
have no idea how pleasant it was to hear a Gayfield voice greet
me as 'Jim.'"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>didn't intend to&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Please intend it in future, Rue. You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And will you ever forget that magnificent winter night when
we drove to Brookhollow after the party?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;remembered it."</p>

<p>"So have <em>I.... </em>Are you waiting for somebody? Of course
you are," he added, laughing. "But may I sit down for a moment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish you would."</p>

<p>So he seated himself, lighted a cigarette, glanced up at her
and smiled.</p>

<p>"When did you come to New York?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Tonight."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't that a bit of luck to run into you like this! Have
you come here to study art?"</p>

<p>"No.... Yes, I think, later, I am to study art here."</p>

<p>"At the League?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Better go to the League," he said. "Begin there anyway. Do you
know where it is?"</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>He called a waiter, borrowed pencil and pad, and wrote down the
address of the Art Students' League. He had begun to fold the
paper when a second thought seemed to strike him, and he added
his own address.</p>

<p>"In case I can do anything for you in any way," he explained.</p>

<p>Rue thanked him, opened her reticule, and placed the folded paper
there beside her purse.</p>

<p>"I do hope I shall see you soon again," he said, looking gaily,
almost mischievously into her grey eyes. "This certainly resembles
fate. Don't you think so, Rue&mdash;this reunion of ours?"</p>

<p>"Fate?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. I should even call it romantic. Don't you think our meeting
this way resembles something very much like romance?"</p>

<p>She felt herself flushing, tried to smile:</p>

<p>"It couldn't resemble anything," she explained with quaint honesty,
"because I am sailing for Europe tomorrow morning; I am going
on board in less than an hour. And also&mdash;also, I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Also?"&mdash;he prompted her, amused, yet oddly touched by her childishly
literal reply.</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;married."</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he said.</p>

<p>"This morning," she added, tasting her ice.</p>

<p>"And you're sailing for Europe on your honeymoon!" he exclaimed.
"Well, upon my word! And what is your ship?"</p>

<p>"The <em>Lusitania</em>."</p>

<p>"Really! I have a friend who is sailing on her&mdash;a most charming
woman. I sent flowers to her only an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Did you?" asked Rue, interested.</p>

<p>"Yes. She is a widow&mdash;the Princess Mistchenka&mdash;a delightful and
pretty woman. I am going to send a note to the steamer tonight
saying that&mdash;that my very <em>particular</em> friend, Ruhannah
Carew, is on board, and won't she ask you to tea. You'd love her,
Rue. She's a regular woman."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;oh, dear!&mdash;a Princess!"</p>

<p>"You won't even notice it," he said reassuringly. "She's a corker;
she's an artist, too. I couldn't begin to tell you how nice she
has been to me. By the way, Rue, whom did you marry?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Brandes."</p>

<p>"Brandes? I don't remember&mdash;was he from up-state?"</p>

<p>"No; New York &mdash;I think&#11834;"</p>

<p>As she bent forward to taste her ice again he noticed for the
first time the childlike loveliness of her throat and profile;
looked at her with increasing interest, realising that she had
grown into a most engaging creature since he had seen her.</p>

<p>Looking up, and beyond him toward the door, she said:</p>

<p>"I think your friend is waiting for you. Had you forgotten him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's so!" he exclaimed. Then rising and offering his hand:
"I wish you happiness, Rue. You have my address. When you return,
won't you let me know where you are? Won't you let me know your
husband?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Please do. You see you and I have a common bond in art, another
in our birthplace. Gayfield folk are your own people and mine.
Don't forget me, Rue."</p>

<p>"No, I won't."</p>

<p>So he took his leave gracefully and went away through the enthralling,
glittering unreality of it all leaving a young girl thrilled,
excited, and deeply impressed with his ease and bearing amid awe-inspiring
scenes in which she, too, desired most ardently to find herself
at ease.</p>

<p>Also she thought of his friend, the Princess Mistchenka. And
again, as before, the name seemed to evoke within her mind a recollection
of having heard it before, very long ago.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Neeland would remember to write, and if
he did she wondered whether a real princess would actually condescend
to invite her to take tea.</p>
