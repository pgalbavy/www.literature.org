<p>Though his brave companion had fallen almost at his side, Brinton
Kingsland had reached the camp of the supply train without receiving
so much as a scratch.  He mourned him, for he was a worthy man;
but he was heart-broken at his failure to gain tidings of his
loved parents and little sister.  He did not know what to do,
and could only fear the worst.</p>

<p>When he had told his story to his new friends, none of them were
able to offer any encouragement or hope.</p>

<p>The supply train consisted of a dozen waggons, in charge of sixteen
teamsters.  As a matter of course, all were armed, and had come
thus far without trouble.</p>

<p>They were making ready to resume their journey to Wounded Knee
when the affray already described took place.  This caused an
hour's delay, and now, when about to start again, the signs of
danger became so threatening, they held back for consultation.</p>

<p>The Indians whom they had driven from the prostrate form of Scout
Jackson reappeared on the crest of the hill over which they had
skurried, and it was noticed that their number was increased to
fully a dozen.</p>

<p>While the teamsters were watching them another band came into
sight, in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>To the dismay of the spectators, this party was more numerous
than the first.  Not only that, but both bands advanced at a slow
trot, and met at a point a couple of hundred yards distant, and
in a place over which the train would have to pass if it pushed
on toward the camp at Wounded Knee.</p>

<p>"Boys," said Captain Wadsworth, who was in charge of the train,
"there's going to be a fight."</p>

<p>"We ought to be able to keep them off," replied one of his men.</p>

<p>"So we shall if no more appear; but the Sioux are as thick as
berries, and by-and-by we shall have a hundred or more of them
popping away at us.  We may as well get ready for what's certain
to come."</p>

<p>"Jackson said something to me," observed Brinton, "about an escort
having been sent out from Wounded Knee to bring you in."</p>

<p>"They can't come any too soon," responded the captain, who fully
comprehended the peril; "but I'm afraid they will be too late. 
Those Indians don't let the grass grow under their feet."</p>

<p>The leader did not content himself with talking, but began to
prepare for the attack, which might come at any moment.  The waggons
were drawn up in a circle, in the middle of which were placed
the horses. Bags of grain, boxes and bundles, were piled on the
ground underneath the waggons.  These served as an additional
protection for the animals, and screened the men, when kneeling
behind and firing at their assailants.</p>

<p>The hostiles were quick to detect what was going on, and did
not allow the work to be completed without interference.  They
began circling back and forth, riding entirely around the camp
and discharging their guns at it.  The exhibition of horsemanship
was a fine one; but they kept at such a distance that their shots
did little damage.  In some way, one got through the entrenchments,
as they might be called, and slightly wounded a horse in the shoulder.
He made more fuss than if it had gone through his head, rearing,
snorting, and plunging, and throwing the rest into a panic, which
would have ended in a stampede, had they not been guarded with
unusual care.</p>

<p>The teamsters did not accept these unwelcome attentions meekly,
but fired at their circling assailants; the cause named, however,
prevented much success.  It looked as if one or two of the shots
inflicted damage, but not to the extent of disabling any pony
or his rider.</p>

<p>Standing at the rear of one of the waggons, where he could see
everything that was going on, Captain Wadsworth watched the exciting
incidents.  At his elbow was Brinton Kingsland, who did not think
it worth while to try his hand with his Winchester, though the
others were continually cracking around him.</p>

<p>"What is to be feared," said the captain, "is that the hostiles
will soon increase to such an extent that they will overwhelm
us."</p>

<p>"How many do you think are out there now?" inquired Brinton.</p>

<p>"I should say between twenty and thirty&mdash;that is, there were
a few minutes ago, but there are five or six less now."</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of that?"</p>

<p>The leader turned his bronzed face toward the youth and smiled
significantly.</p>

<p>"Don't you catch on?  They have sent after reinforcements: a
slight number now means a big number pretty soon."</p>

<p>"Have you noticed those bucks on the top of the ridge yonder?"</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth looked in the direction named.  Three Indians
had dismounted, and were standing close together, or rather two
of them were, while the third seemed to be stooping and busy with
something on the ground.</p>

<p>"How long have they been there?" asked the leader.</p>

<p>"They rode up the slope within the last five minutes.  They were
off their ponies before they stopped.  I can't guess what they
are doing."</p>

<p>"I don't know; but we shall soon learn."</p>

<p>Although the cracking of rifles continued, and the teamsters,
kneeling behind the fortifications, were doing their utmost to
pick off some of the dusky riders, who in turn sent in their dropping
shots, Captain Wadsworth gave them little heed.  The position
of himself and Brinton was exposed, and, had their assailants
come closer, they would not have dared to maintain it; but with
the combatants so widely separated, it cannot be said they were
in much real danger.</p>

<p>The three Indians in whom our friends were so much interested
just then were beyond and apart from the others.  Their horses
were cropping the few blades of withered grass that had survived
the winter's tempests; but not one was a dozen yards from his
master, all of whom were so grouped together that their movements
could not be identified.</p>

<p>Rather curiously there was not a spy-glass among the teamsters. 
Such an article would have been valuable just then; but they had
to depend upon their unaided vision.</p>

<p>The captain and Brinton, however, agreed that two of the bucks
were bent over and busy with something on the ground, while the
third, standing on the crest of the ridge, appeared to be awaiting
the action of his companions before carrying out some plan he
had in mind.</p>

<p>"Look!" whispered the youth; "isn't that smoke?"</p>

<p>The captain was silent a moment before answering&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes; the Indian is like the Chinaman: he can start a fire where
you and I couldn't kindle a spark.  I believe they will make a
bundle of water-soaked leaves crackle and burn like tinder wood. 
Those fellows have got some of the dried grass together and have
managed to touch it off.  You understand what <em>that</em> means,
of course?"</p>

<p>"I cannot say that I do."</p>

<p>"It is a signal fire."</p>

<p>"Kindled for what purpose?"</p>

<p>"To call all the other hostiles in sight here, to take a hand
in the fun of massacring us and plundering our train.  Such a
signal can be seen a long way and will do all that is intended. 
Look at it now!"</p>

<p>From between the two, who now rose from their stooping posture,
a thin finger of vapour arose, going straight upward as if it
were a shadowy arrow aimed at the clouds.</p>

<p>"One of the bucks is waving his blanket," observed Brinton; "he
must mean something by that.  I suppose he is fanning the blaze
to keep it from going out."</p>

<p>"No; look at that thin line of smoke; don't you see something
peculiar?"</p>

<p>"Ah!  I notice it now."</p>

<p>The vapour showed a striking change of appearance; instead of
climbing in a straight line, it now waved gracefully from side
to side.  It was something which never can occur unless with the
help of some person.</p>

<p>"That is the signal," said Captain Wadsworth; "it can be seen
for miles in all directions, and every Indian eye that catches
sight of it will read its meaning as plainly as our soldiers do
the looking-glass signals.  It's a bad thing for us."</p>

<p>The captain was an old campaigner, and knew what he was talking
about; his impressive manner was not lost upon Brinton Kingsland.</p>

<p>"How far are we from Wounded Knee?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Anywhere from a dozen to twenty miles; it depends on the course
we take&mdash;that is," he added, with a shake of his head, "whether
we ever take any course at all."</p>

<p>"I cannot recall just what Jackson said about an escort from
that camp, but I think he told me such an escort had been sent."</p>

<p>The captain shook his head.</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken; for, if that were the case, why did he
ride out here alone?  Was it not more likely that he came to learn
whether we needed protection? and if that is so, they will wait
for his return and report before sending out the escort which
is the only thing that can save us."</p>

<p>This view was so reasonable that Brinton could not combat it.</p>

<p>"I see one chance," ventured the youth, after a moment's silence,
during which he watched the actions of the signal corps on the
ridge.</p>

<p>The officer turned wonderingly toward him.</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to hear what it is."</p>

<p>"If a messenger can get through to Wounded Knee with word of
your extremity, they will send you help without delay."</p>

<p>"True; but how can such a thing succeed?  If it were night it
might be done; but in what possible way can a horseman dash through
the lines when the bucks would see him start, and they have us
surrounded?"</p>

<p>"It will be taking big risks, but I would like to try it."</p>

<p>Captain Wadsworth, who had been leaning against the hind wheel
of one of the waggons, with his arms folded, abruptly straightened
up and stared at the youth, as if uncertain whether he had heard
him aright; then he repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> would like to try it, did you say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; and I believe I can get through."</p>

<p>The officer looked off toward the ridge and shook his head.</p>

<p>"Don't think of such a thing; we must stay here and fight it
out, and trust to Providence to open the way, if any is to be
opened."</p>

<p>But Brinton was in earnest, and his eagerness was increased by
the discouraging manner of the captain.</p>

<p>"I understand your feelings, and I am not blind to what is in
the path of the one who attempts to do what I have proposed; but,
captain, bear two things in mind: there isn't a fleeter horse
in the whole West than my Jack.  When I gave him rein he pulled
away from those Indians as though their animals were walking. 
So all I have to secure is a fair start."</p>

<p>"Exactly," replied the leader with a grim smile, "and therein
you sum up the whole business.  All that you need to succeed is
to succeed. But what is the other point you wish me to hold in
mind?"</p>

<p>"The fair start can be secured."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Pretend to ride out against the hostiles.  They will gather
in front of the threatened point; I will be on the watch, and,
when the way opens, will scoot for Wounded Knee."</p>

<p>Brinton saw that Captain Wadsworth was interested.  Once more
he came to the erect position, and looking kindly in his face,
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your plan has something in it."</p>

<p>The heart of the youth leaped with hope.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it; but there's not a minute to lose."</p>

<p>This was self-evident, and the captain, having made up his mind,
passed among his men and hurriedly explained what he had decided
to do.  It was for eight or ten of them to mount their horses
and move cautiously toward the ridge, as if with the intention
of attacking the little signal party there and stamping out their
tiny fire.  This would cause a concentration (or, more properly,
it was hoped that it would) of the hostiles on that side of the
camp, of which Brinton Kingsland would take advantage by dashing
out on the other side and riding at full speed to Wounded Knee.</p>

<p>It was the only thing that offered hope, and, therefore, was
eagerly accepted by all.  The firing was so scattered that no
fear was felt in moving about within the circle of waggons, for,
as we have shown, Captain Wadsworth and Brinton had been exposed
all the time without harm.  The Sioux kept so far away that it
was evident they were waiting for the arrival of reinforcements
before making a real attack.</p>

<p>The preparations on the part of the teamsters had hardly begun
when Brinton, who had led his pony forth and stood ready to leap
into the saddle, called out&mdash;</p>

<p>"You needn't do it!  Here's my chance!"</p>

<p>The majority of the Indians were near the ridge at that moment,
but some of them were quite a distance off, and, in fact, alarmingly
close to the opposite side of the camp.  The impatient youth was
confident that he could dash through the opening before they could
stop him.</p>

<p>"It won't do!" protested Captain Wadsworth; "don't try it! wait
till we get them nearer the ridge they will cut you off&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I'm off!  Good-bye!"</p>

<p>Brinton Kingsland was in the saddle, and shot out from among
the waggons like a thunderbolt.</p>
