<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the night that Ben Mayberry started across the bridge to deliver
the cipher message to Mr. Burkhill in Moorestown, he had reached
the center span before he felt he was in personal danger. The
few lamps which twinkled at long distances from each other were
barely enough for him to see where he was going, and they did
little more than make the darkness visible.</p>

<p>By the faint light he observed a carriage and single horse approaching.
The animal lifted his feet high, walked slowly, and snuffed the
air as he turned his head from side to side, like an intelligent
creature which feels he is approaching danger. The rattling of
the narrow planks under his hoofs and the carriage wheels could
be heard above the roar and sweep of the angry river beneath.</p>

<p>Suddenly the bridge trembled under a blow received from a gigantic
piece of ice, which went grinding and splashing with such violence
that its course could be followed by the bulging upward of the
planks between Ben and the horse.</p>

<p>"My gracious! this won't do," exclaimed the boy, more alarmed
for the vehicle and its occupants than for himself.</p>

<p>He ran forward to grasp the bridle of the horse with the purpose
of turning him back, when he saw that he had stopped of his own
accord, and was snorting with terror. Ben reached up to seize
the bit, when he was made dizzy by the abrupt lifting of the planking
underneath, and was thrown violently forward on his face.</p>

<p>The brave boy knew what it meant, and kept his senses about him.
It was utterly dark, and he was in the icy water with a terrified
horse struggling fiercely, and in danger of beating out the boy's
brains with his hoofs, while the shriek of the agonized mother
rose above the horrid din:</p>

<p>"Save my child&mdash;save my child!"</p>

<p>Fortunately for Ben Mayberry the bridge broke up in a very unusual
manner. Instead of the roof coming down upon him, it seemed to
fall apart, as did the narrow planking. Thus his movements were
not interfered with by the structure, and realizing what a desperate
struggle for life was before him, he drew off his cumbersome overcoat
with great deftness, and then swam as only a strong swimmer can
do in the very extremity of peril.</p>

<p>He heard nothing more of the horse, which had doubtless perished
after a struggle as brief as it was fierce; but, unable to see
anything at all, Ben struck out toward the point whence came the
cry of the mother, and which was close at hand.</p>

<p>He had scarcely made three strokes when he came in violent collision
with a huge block of ice in his path. Without attempting to go
around it, he grasped the edge, and, by a determined effort, drew
himself upon it. Fragments of the bridge were all around, and
he felt some of the timber upon the support.</p>

<p>While crawling carefully toward the other side, he shouted:</p>

<p>"Helloa! where are you? Answer, and I'll help you."</p>

<p>A faint cry made itself heard amid the rushing waters and the
impenetrable darkness. It was just ahead, and the next instant
Ben had reached the other side of the ice raft, where, steadying
himself with one hand, he groped about with the other, uttering
encouraging words as he did so.</p>

<p>Suddenly he caught hold of a delicate arm, and with another cheery
shout, he began drawing with all his strength.</p>

<p>It was a hard task, under the circumstances, but he quickly succeeded,
and was not a little amazed to find that instead of a lady he
had helped out a small girl.</p>

<p>But it was the cry of a mother that had reached his ears, and
he did his utmost (which unfortunately was little) to help her.
He called again and again, but there was no answer. He asked of
the child the whereabouts of her parents, but the little one was
almost senseless with bewilderment, cold, and terror, and could
give no intelligible answer.</p>

<p>"She must be drowned," was the sorrowful conclusion of Ben, who
was forced to cease his efforts; and I may as well add at this
point, that he was right; the mother's body being carried out
to sea, where it was never found.</p>

<p>For the time, Ben and the little girl were safe, but it will
be seen that their condition was pitiable. It was a wintry night,
the water was of an arctic temperature, and their clothing was
saturated. The icy floor on which they were supported would have
added to their terrible discomfort, had he not been able to gather
together several of the planks within reach, with which he made
a partition between them and the freezing surface.</p>

<p>Ben shouted at the top of his voice, but he was so far below
the place where the bridge had stood that no one heard him, and
he finally gave it up, knowing that even if he made himself known
to friends, they would be powerless to help him so long as the
darkness lasted.</p>

<p>The child, so far as he could judge, was no more than nine or
ten years old, but she was richly clad, as he learned from the
abundance of furs, silks, and velvet. She had luxuriant hair,
which streamed about her shoulders, and he was sure she must be
very beautiful.</p>

<p>She was alive, but faint and suffering. She did not wish to talk
and Ben did not urge her, although he was curious to know her
identity.</p>

<p>"I will learn all in the morning," he said to himself; "that
is, if we are spared until then."</p>

<p>He was too excited and terrified to fall asleep, even had his
discomfort not been too great to permit it, and he found he needed
his wits about him.</p>

<p>Now and then the cake of ice which supported them was crowded
by others, until it seemed on the point of being overturned, in
which event another terrible struggle would be necessary to save
himself and the little girl.</p>

<p>Then again, there seemed to be eddies and whirlpools in the current,
which threatened to dislodge them or to break up the miniature
iceberg into fragments, as the bridge itself was destroyed.</p>
