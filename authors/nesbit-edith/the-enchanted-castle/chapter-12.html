<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>IT would be interesting, no doubt, to describe the feelings of
Lord Yalding as he followed Mabel and Jimmy through his ancestral
halls, but I have no means of knowing at all what he felt. Yet
one must suppose that he felt something: bewilderment, perhaps,
mixed with a faint wonder, and a desire to pinch himself to see
if he were dreaming. Or he may have pondered the rival questions,
"Am I mad?" "Are they mad?" without being at all able to decide
which he ought to try to answer, let alone deciding what, in either
case, the answer ought to be. You see, the children did seem to
believe in the odd stories they told&mdash;and the wish <em>had</em>
come true, and the ghost <em>had</em> appeared. He must have thought&mdash;but
all this is vain; I don't <em>really</em> know what he thought
any more than you do.</p>

<p>Nor can I give you any clue to the thoughts and feelings of Mademoiselle.
I only know that she was very happy, but any one would have known
that if they had seen her face. Perhaps this is as good a moment
as any to explain that when her guardian had put her in a convent
so that she should not sacrifice her fortune by marrying a poor
lord, her guardian had secured that fortune (to himself) by going
off with it to South America. Then, having no money left, Mademoiselle
had to work for it. So she went out as governess, and took the
situation she did take because it was near Lord Yalding's home.
She wanted to see him, even though she thought he had forsaken
her and did not love her any more. And now she had seen him. I
daresay she thought about some of these things as she went along
through his house, her hand held in his. But of course I can't
be sure.</p>

<p>Jimmy's thoughts, of course, I can read like any old book. He
thought, "Now he'll <em>have</em> to believe me." That Lord Yalding
should believe him had become, quite unreasonably, the most important
thing in the world to Jimmy. He wished that Gerald and Kathleen
were there to share his triumph, but they were helping Mabel's
aunt to cover the grand furniture up, and so were out of what
followed. Not that they missed much, for when Mabel proudly said,
"Now you'll see," and the others came close round her in the little
panelled room, there was a pause, and then&mdash;nothing happened at
all!</p>

<p>"There's a secret spring here somewhere," said Mabel, fumbling
with fingers that had suddenly grown hot and damp.</p>

<p>"Where?" said Lord Yalding.</p>

<p>"<em>Here</em>," said Mabel impatiently, "only I can't find it."</p>

<p>And she couldn't. She found the spring of the secret panel under
the window all right, but that seemed to every one dull compared
with the jewels that every one had pictured and two at least had
seen. But the spring that made the oak panelling slide away and
displayed jewels plainly to any eye worth a king's ransom&mdash;this
could not be found. More, it was simply not there. There could
be no doubt of that. Every inch of the panelling was felt by careful
fingers. The earnest protests of Mabel and Jimmy died away presently
in a silence made painful by the hotness of one's ears, the discomfort
of not liking to meet any one's eyes, and the resentful feeling
that the spring was not behaving in at all a sportsmanlike way,
and that, in a word, this was not cricket.</p>

<p>"You see!" said Lord Yalding severely. "Now you've had your joke,
if you call it a joke, and I've had enough of the whole silly
business. Give me the ring&mdash;it's mine, I suppose, since you say
you found it somewhere here&mdash;and don't let's hear another word
about all this rubbish of magic and enchantment."</p>

<p>"Gerald's got the ring," said Mabel miserably.</p>

<p>"Then go and fetch him," said Lord Yalding&mdash;"both of you."</p>

<p>The melancholy pair retired, and Lord Yalding spent the time
of their absence in explaining to Mademoiselle how very unimportant
jewels were compared with other things.</p>

<p>The four children came back together.</p>

<p>"We've had enough of this ring business," said Lord Yalding.
"Give it to me, and we'll say no more about it."</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I can't get it off," said Gerald. "It&mdash;it always did
have a will of its own."</p>

<p>"I'll soon get it off," said Lord Yalding. But he didn't. "We'll
try soap," he said firmly. Four out of his five hearers knew just
exactly how much use soap would be.</p>

<p>"They won't believe about the jewels," wailed Mabel, suddenly
dissolved in tears, "and I can't find the spring. I've felt all
over&mdash;we all have&mdash;it was just here, and<hr>"</p>

<p>Her fingers felt it just as she spoke; and as she ceased to speak
the carved panels slid away, and the blue velvet shelves laden
with jewels were disclosed to the unbelieving eyes of Lord Yalding
and the lady who was to be his wife.</p>

<p>"Jove!" said Lord Yalding.</p>

<p>"<em>Miséricorde!</em>" said the lady.</p>

<p>"But why <em>now</em>?" gasped Mabel. "Why not before?"</p>

<p>"I expect it's magic," said Gerald. "There's no real spring here,
and it couldn't act because the ring wasn't here. You know Phœbus
told us the ring was the heart of all the magic."</p>

<p>"Shut it up and take the ring away and see."</p>

<p>They did, and Gerald was (as usual, he himself pointed out) proved
to be right. When the ring was away there was no spring; when
the ring was in the room there (as Mabel urged) was the spring
all right enough.</p>

<p>"So you see," said Mabel to Lord Yalding.</p>

<p>"I see that the spring's very artfully concealed," said that
dense peer. "I think it was very clever indeed of you to find
it. And if those jewels are real<hr>"</p>

<p>"Of course they're real," said Mabel indignantly.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway," said Lord Yalding, "thank you all very much.
I think it's clearing up. I'll send the wagonette home with you
after lunch. And if you don't mind, I'll have the ring."</p>

<p>Half an hour of soap and water produced no effect whatever, except
to make the finger of Gerald very red and very sore. Then Lord
Yalding said something very impatient indeed, and then Gerald
suddenly became angry and said: "Well, I'm sure I wish it would
come off," and of course instantly, "slick as butter," as he later
pointed out, off it came.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Lord Yalding.</p>

<p>"And I believe now he thinks I kept it on on purpose," said Gerald
afterwards when, at ease on the leads at home, they talked the
whole thing out over a tin of preserved pineapple and a bottle
of gingerbeer apiece. "There's no pleasing some people. He wasn't
in such a fiery hurry to order that wagonette after he found that
Mademoiselle meant to go when we did. But I liked him better when
he was a humble bailiff. Take him for all in all, he does not
look as if we should like him again."</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what's the matter with him," said Kathleen,
leaning back against the tiled roof; "it's really the magic&mdash;it's
like sickening with measles. Don't you remember how cross Mabel
was at first about the invisibleness?"</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"It's partly that," said Gerald, trying to be fair, "and partly
it's the being in love. It always makes people like idiots&mdash;a
chap at school told me. His sister was like that&mdash;quite rotten,
you know. And she used to be quite a decent sort before she was
engaged."</p>

<p>At tea and at supper Mademoiselle was radiant&mdash;as attractive
as a lady on a Christmas card, as merry as a marmoset, and as
kind as you would always be yourself if you could take the trouble.
At breakfast, an equal radiance, kindness, attraction, merriment.
Then Lord Yalding came to see her. The meeting took place in the
drawing-room: the children with deep discreetness remained shut
in the schoolroom till Gerald, going up to his room for a pencil,
surprised Eliza with her ear glued to the drawing-room key-hole.</p>

<p>After that Gerald sat on the top stair with a book. He could
not hear any of the conversation in the drawing-room, but he could
command a view of the door, and in this way be certain that no
one else heard any of it. Thus it was that when the drawing-room
door opened Gerald was in a position to see Lord Yalding come
out. "Our young hero," as he said later, "coughed with infinite
tact to show that he was there," but Lord Yalding did not seem
to notice. He walked in a blind sort of way to the hat-stand,
fumbled clumsily with the umbrellas and mackintoshes, found his
straw hat and looked at it gloomily, crammed it on his head and
went out, banging the door behind him in the most reckless way.</p>

<p>He left the drawing-room door open, and Gerald, though he had
purposely put himself in a position where one could hear nothing
from the drawing-room when the door was shut, could hear something
quite plainly now that the door was open. That something, he noticed
with deep distress and disgust, was the sound of sobs and sniffs.
Mademoiselle was quite certainly crying.</p>

<p>"Jimminy!" he remarked to himself, "they haven't lost much time.
Fancy their beginning to quarrel <em>already</em>! I hope I'll
never have to be anybody's lover."</p>

<p>But this was no time to brood on the terrors of his own future.
Eliza might at any time occur. She would not for a moment hesitate
to go through that open door, and push herself into the very secret
sacred heart of Mademoiselle's grief. It seemed to Gerald better
that he should be the one to do this. So he went softly down the
worn green Dutch carpet of the stairs and into the drawing-room,
shutting the door softly and securely behind him.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>"It is all over," Mademoiselle was saying, her face buried in
the beady arum-lilies on a red ground worked for a cushion cover
by a former pupil: "he will not marry me!"</p>

<p>Do not ask me how Gerald had gained the lady's confidence. He
had, as I think I said almost at the beginning, very pretty ways
with grown-ups, when he chose. Anyway, he was holding her hand,
almost as affectionately as if she had been his mother with a
headache, and saying "Don't!" and "Don't cry!" and "It'll be all
right, you see if it isn't" in the most comforting way you can
imagine, varying the treatment with gentle thumps on the back
and entreaties to her to tell him all about it.</p>

<p>This wasn't mere curiosity, as you might think. The entreaties
were prompted by Gerald's growing certainty that whatever was
the matter was somehow the fault of that ring. And in this Gerald
was ("once more," as he told himself) right.</p>

<p>The tale, as told by Mademoiselle, was certainly an unusual one.
Lord Yalding, last night after dinner, had walked in the park
"to think of<hr>"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Gerald; "and he had the ring on. And he saw<hr>"</p>

<p>"He saw the monuments become alive," sobbed Mademoiselle: "his
brain was troubled by the ridiculous accounts of fairies that
you tell him. He sees Apollon and Aphrodité alive on their marble.
He remembers him of your story. He wish himself a statue. Then
he becomes mad&mdash;imagines to himself that your story of the island
is true, plunges in the lake, swims among the beasts of the Ark
of Noé, feeds with gods on an island. At dawn the madness become
less. He think the Panthéon vanish. But him, no&mdash;he thinks himself
statue, hiding from gardeners in his garden till nine less a quarter.
Then he thinks to wish himself no more a statue and perceives
that he is flesh and blood. A bad dream, but he has lost the head
with the tales you tell. He say it is no dream but he is fool&mdash;mad&mdash;how
you say? And a mad man must not marry. There is no hope. I am
at despair! And the life is vain!"</p>

<p>"There <em>is</em>," said Gerald earnestly. "I assure you there
is&mdash;hope, I mean. And life's as right as rain really. And there's
nothing to despair about. He's <em>not</em> mad, and it's <em>not</em>
a dream. It's magic. It really and truly is."</p>

<p>"The magic exists not," Mademoiselle moaned; "it is that he is
mad. It is the joy to re-see me after so many days. Oh, la-la-la-la-la!"</p>

<p>"Did he talk to the gods?" Gerald asked gently.</p>

<p>"It is there the most mad of all his ideas. He say that Mercure
give him rendezvous at some temple to-morrow when the moon raise
herself."</p>

<p>"Right," cried Gerald, "righto! Dear nice, kind, pretty Mademoiselle
Rapunzel, don't be a silly little duffer"&mdash;he lost himself for
a moment among the consoling endearments he was accustomed to
offer to Kathleen in moments of grief and emotion, but hastily
added: "I mean, do not be a lady who weeps causelessly. To-morrow
he will go to that temple. I will go. Thou shalt go&mdash;he will go.
We will go&mdash;you will go&mdash;let 'em all go! And, you see, it's going
to be absolutely all right. He'll see he isn't mad, and you'll
understand all about everything. Take my handkerchief, its quite
a clean one as it happens; I haven't even unfolded it. Oh! do
stop crying, there's a dear, darling, long-lost lover."</p>

<p>This flood of eloquence was not without effect. She took his
handkerchief, sobbed, half smiled, dabbed at her eyes, and said:
"Oh, naughty! Is it some trick you play him, like the ghost?"</p>

<p>"I can't explain," said Gerald, "but I give you my word of honour&mdash;you
know what an Englishman's word of honour is, don't you? even if
you <em>are</em> French&mdash;that everything is going to be exactly
what you wish. I've never told you a lie. Believe me!"</p>

<p>"It is curious," said she, drying her eyes, "but I do." And once
again, so suddenly that he could not have resisted, she kissed
him. I think, however, that in this her hour of sorrow he would
have thought it mean to resist.</p>

<p>"It pleases her and it doesn't hurt me&mdash;much," would have been
his thought.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>And now it is near moonrise. The French governess, half-doubting,
half hoping, but wholly longing to be near Lord Yalding even if
he be as mad as a March hare, and the four children&mdash;they have
collected Mabel by an urgent letter-card posted the day before&mdash;are
going over the dewy grass. The moon has not yet risen, but her
light is in the sky mixed with the pink and purple of the sunset.
The west is heavy with ink-clouds and rich colour, but the east,
where the moon rises, is clear as a rock-pool.</p>

<p>They go across the lawn and through the beech-wood and come at
last, through a tangle of underwood and bramble, to a little level
tableland that rises out of the flat hill-top&mdash;one tableland out
of another. Here is the ring of vast rugged stones, one pierced
with a curious round hole, worn smooth at its edges. In the middle
of the circle is a great flat stone, alone, desolate, full of
meaning&mdash;a stone that is covered thick with the memory of old
faiths and creeds long since forgotten. Something dark moves in
the circle. The French girl breaks from the children, goes to
it, clings to its arm. It is Lord Yalding, and he is telling her
to go.</p>

<p>"Never of the life!" she cries. "If you are mad I am mad too,
for I believe the tale these children tell. And I am here to be
with thee and see with thee&mdash;whatever the rising moon shall show
us."</p>

<p>The children, holding hands by the flat stone, more moved by
the magic in the girl's voice than by any magic of enchanted rings,
listen, trying not to listen.</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid?" Lord Yalding is saying.</p>

<p>"Afraid? With you?" she laughs. He put his arm round her. The
children hear her sigh.</p>

<p>"Are you afraid," he says, "my darling?"</p>

<p>Gerald goes across the wide turf ring expressly to say:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You can't be afraid if you are wearing the ring. And I'm sorry,
but we can hear every word you say."</p>

<p>She laughs again. "It makes nothing," she says; "you know already
if we love each other."</p>

<p>Then he puts the ring on her finger, and they stand together.
The white of his flannel coat sleeve marks no line on the white
of her dress; they stand as though cut out of one block of marble.</p>

<p>Then a faint greyness touches the top of that round hole, creeps
up the side. Then the hole is a disc of light&mdash;a moonbeam strikes
straight through it across the grey green of the circle that the
stones mark, and as the moon rises the moonbeam slants downward.
The children have drawn back till they stand close to the lovers.
The moonbeam slants more and more; now it touches the far end
of the stone, now it draws nearer and nearer to the middle of
it, now at last it touches the very heart and centre of that central
stone. And then it is as though a spring were touched, a fountain
of light released. Everything changes. Or, rather, everything
is revealed. There are no more secrets. The plan of the world
seems plain, like an easy sum that one writes in big figures on
a child's slate. One wonders how one can ever have wondered about
anything. Space is not; every place that one has seen or dreamed
of is here. Time is not; into this instant is crowded all that
one has ever done or dreamed of doing. It is a moment, and it
is eternity. It is the centre of the universe and it is the universe
itself. The eternal light rests on and illuminates the eternal
heart of things.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>None of the six human beings who saw that moon-rising were ever
able to think about it as having anything to do with time. Only
for one instant could that moonray have rested full on the centre
of that stone. And yet there was time for many happenings.</p>

<p>From that height one could see far out over the quiet park and
sleeping gardens, and through the grey green of them shapes moved,
approaching.</p>

<p>The great beasts came first, strange forms that were when the
world was new&mdash;gigantic lizards with wings&mdash;dragons they lived
as in men's memories&mdash;mammoths, strange vast birds, they crawled
up the hill and ranged themselves outside the circle. Then, not
from the garden but from very far away, came the stone gods of
Egypt and Assyria&mdash;bull-bodied, bird-winged, hawk-headed, cat-headed,
all in stone, and all alive and alert; strange, grotesque figures
from the towers of cathedrals&mdash;figures of angels with folded wings,
figures of beasts with wings wide spread; sphinxes; uncouth idols
from Southern palm-fringed islands; and, last of all, the beautiful
marble shapes of the gods and goddesses who had held their festival
on the lake-island, and bidden Lord Yalding and the children to
this meeting.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken. Each stone shape came gladly and quietly
into the circle of light and understanding, as children, tired
with a long ramble, creep quietly through the open door into the
firelit welcome of home.</p>

<p>The children had thought to ask many questions. And it had been
promised that the questions should be answered. Yet now no one
spoke a word, because all had come into the circle of the real
magic where all things are understood without speech.</p>

<p>Afterwards none of them could ever remember at all what had happened.
But they never forgot that they had been somewhere where everything
was easy and beautiful. And people who can remember even that
much are never quite the same again. And when they came to talk
of it next day they found that to each some little part of that
night's great enlightenment was left.</p>

<p>All the stone creatures drew closer round the stone&mdash;the light
where the moonbeam struck it seemed to break away in spray such
as water makes when it falls from a height. All the crowd was
bathed in whiteness. A deep hush lay over the vast assembly.</p>

<p>Then a wave of intention swept over the mighty crowd. All the
faces, bird, beast, Greek statue, Babylonian monster, human child
and human lover, turned upward, the radiant light illumined them
and one word broke from all.</p>

<p>"The light!" they cried, and the sound of their voice was like
the sound of a great wave; "the light! the light<hr>"</p>

<p>And then the light was not any more, and, soft as floating thistle-down,
sleep was laid on the eyes of all but the immortals.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>The grass was chill and dewy and the clouds had veiled the moon.
The lovers and the children were standing together, all clinging
close, not for fear, but for love.</p>

<p>"I want," said the French girl softly, "to go to the cave on
the island."</p>

<p>Very quietly through the gentle brooding night they went down
to the boat-house, loosed the clanking chain, and dipped oars
among the drowned stars and lilies. They came to the island, and
found the steps.</p>

<p>"I brought candles," said Gerald, "in case."</p>

<p>So, lighted by Gerald's candles, they went down into the Hall
of Psyche! and there glowed the light spread from her statue,
and all was as the children had seen it before.</p>

<p>It is the Hall of Granted Wishes.</p>

<p>"The ring," said Lord Yalding.</p>

<p>"The ring," said his lover, "is the magic ring given long ago
to a mortal, and it is what you say it is. It was given to your
ancestor by a lady of my house that he might build her a garden
and a house like her own palace and garden in her own land. So
that this place is built partly by his love and partly by that
magic. She never lived to see it; that was the price of the magic."</p>

<p>It must have been English that she spoke, for otherwise how could
the children have understood her? Yet the words were not like
Mademoiselle's way of speaking.</p>

<p>"Except from children," her voice went on, "the ring exacts a
payment. You paid for me, when I came by your wish, by this terror
of madness that you have since known. Only one wish is free."</p>

<p>"And that wish is<hr>?"</p>

<p>"The last," she said. "Shall I wish?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;wish," they said, all of them.</p>

<p>"I wish, then," said Lord Yalding's lover, "that all the magic
this ring has wrought may be undone, and that the ring itself
may be no more and no less than a charm to bind thee and me together
for evermore."</p>

<p>She ceased. And as she ceased the enchanted light died away,
the windows of granted wishes went out, like magic-lantern pictures.
Gerald's candle faintly lighted a rudely arched cave, and where
Psyche's statue had been was a stone with something carved on
it.</p>

<p>Gerald held the light low.</p>

<p>"It is her grave," the girl said.</p>

<p>= = = = =</p>

<p>Next day no one could remember anything at all exactly. But a
good many things were changed. There was no ring but the plain
gold ring that Mademoiselle found clasped in her hand when she
woke in her own bed in the morning. More than half the jewels
in the panelled room were gone, and those that remained had no
panelling to cover them; they just lay bare on the velvet-covered
shelves. There was no passage at the back of the Temple of Flora.
Quite a lot of the secret passages and hidden rooms had disappeared.
And there were not nearly so many statues in the garden as everyone
had supposed. And large pieces of the castle were missing and
had to be replaced at great expense. From which we may conclude
that Lord Yalding's ancestor had used the ring a good deal to
help him in his building.</p>

<p>However, the jewels that were left were quite enough to pay for
everything.</p>

<p>The suddenness with which all the ring-magic was undone was such
a shock to everyone concerned that they now almost doubt that
any magic ever happened.</p>

<p>But it is certain that Lord Yalding married the French governess
and that a plain gold ring was used in the ceremony, and this,
if you come to think of it, could be no other than the magic ring,
turned, by that last wish, into a charm to keep him and his wife
together for ever.</p>

<p>Also, if all this story is nonsense and a make-up&mdash;if Gerald
and Jimmy and Kathleen and Mabel have merely imposed on my trusting
nature by a pack of unlikely inventions, how do you account for
the paragraph which appeared in the evening papers the day after
the magic of the moon-rising?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF A WELL-KNOWN<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CITY MAN</em>,"

</p>
</div>
<p>it said, and then went on to say how a gentleman, well known
and much respected in financial circles, had vanished, leaving
no trace.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Mr. U. W. Ugli," the papers continued, "had<br/>
remained late, working at his office as was his<br/>
occasional habit. The office door was found<br/>
locked, and on its being broken open the clothes<br/>
of the unfortunate gentleman were found in a heap<br/>
on the floor, together with an umbrella, a walking<br/>
stick, a golf club, and, curiously enough, a<br/>
feather brush, such as housemaids use for dusting.<br/>
Of his body, however, there was no trace. The<br/>
police are stated to have a clue."

</p>
</div>
<p>If they have, they have kept it to themselves. But I do not think
they can have a clue, because, of course, that respected gentleman
was the Ugly-Wugly who became real when, in search of a really
good hotel, he got into the Hall of Granted Wishes. And if none
of this story ever happened, how is it that those four children
are such friends with Lord and Lady Yalding, and stay at The Towers
almost every holidays?</p>

<p>It is all very well for all of them to pretend that the whole
of this story is my own invention: facts are facts, and you can't
explain them away.</p>
