<p>Dick Morris, stretched out full length upon the top of Hurricane
Hill, peering down in the impenetrable gloom, understood all that
had passed. There was no mistaking that yell of Tom Hardynge;
he had heard it many a time before in the heat of conflict, and
it generally meant something.</p>

<p>"Go it, old chap!" he shouted, swinging his hat over his head,
as he saw the whole thing in his imagination. "Them 'ere pistol-barks
show there's been some bitin' done. Business is business."</p>

<p>He noted, too, the sounds of the mustang's hoofs growing fainter
and fainter, until the strained ears could detect them no longer.
Tom Hardynge had safely passed through the Apache lines. It was
a daring and desperate feat indeed, but it had succeeded to perfection.
Nothing now remained to hinder his flight direct to Fort Havens.</p>

<p>"I rather think somebody's mad," exulted Dick, who was fully
as proud over the exploit of his comrade as was Tom himself. "There
ain't much doubt but what there'll be lively times here before
long. They know there's only two of us, counting in the little
chap, and they'll make a rush. Let 'em do it. If they can get
up by that corner where the other fellow dropped they're welcome,
that's all."</p>

<p>And with this conclusion he left the top of the hill and picked
his way down the path, until he reached the spot where he had
parted from his comrade. Here he stooped down with the purpose
of picking up the body of the warrior and flinging it down upon
the heads of those below. To his astonishment, it was gone!</p>

<p>He searched around for several minutes, venturing to descend
some distance, but it was missing.</p>

<p>"I don't think he could have got up and walked away," said the
hunter, as he scratched his head over the occurrence. "No, it
couldn't have been that, for Tom don't strike any such blows any
more than I do."</p>

<p>It followed, then, as a matter of course, that after the discovery
of the trick, some brother Apache had stolen his way up the path
and removed the body, a proceeding which Dick Morris hardly suspected
until he was really compelled to believe it.</p>

<p>"If I'd only knowed he was coming," he growled, "how I would
have lammed him; but he's come and gone, and there ain't any use
in cryin' over it."</p>

<p>He waited and listened carefully, and once or twice a slight
rattling of the gravel caused him to suspect that some of the
redskins were attempting to steal upon him; but if such were the
case, they must have contented themselves by not approaching within
striking distance.</p>

<p>Finally the night wore away, and the dull light of morning began
stealing over the prairie. As soon as objects could be distinguished,
he returned to his position upon the top of the rock and made
his observations.</p>

<p>Little, if any, change was discernible in the disposition of
the besieging Indians. Their horses were gathered at some distance,
where the grass was quite rank. The warriors had assumed all the
indolent attitudes which are seen in a body of men that have more
time at their disposal than they know what to do with. They had
shifted their position so far back that they were beyond good
rifle range; for although a hunter like Dick Morris could have
picked off a redskin nine times out of ten, yet he could not "pick
his man." Lone Wolf had attired himself precisely as were the
rest of his warriors, and at the distance it was impossible to
distinguish him from them, so the scout wisely concluded to hold
his fire until he could be certain of his target.</p>

<p>As soon as it was fairly light, Dick naturally turned his eyes
off toward the southwest, in the direction of the hills, whither
his comrade had fled during the night.</p>

<p>"He is gone," he muttered, when he had made certain that no object
was to be seen. "I might have knowed that before I looked, 'cause
the hoss knows how to travel, and Tom's made him do his purtiest."</p>

<p>"Hello! what's the news?"</p>

<p>The query came from Ned Chadmund, who had aroused himself from
slumber, and was standing at his side.</p>

<p>"Where is Tom?"</p>

<p>"About fifty miles off yonder, goin' like a streak of greased
lightnin' for Fort Havens."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>Whereupon Dick Morris explained. Of course the lad was astounded
to think that all this had taken place while he was dreaming of
home and friends, and he hardly knew whether to rejoice or to
be alarmed at the shape matters had just then taken. True, Tom
Hardynge was speeding away on his fleet-footed mustang for Fort
Havens, but it would take a long time to reach there and return.
There was something startling in the thought that a man and a
boy were all that were left to oppose the advance of the force
of the Apaches from below. What was to prevent their swarming
upward and overwhelming them? Nothing, it may be said, but the
strong arm of Dick Morris. He might have been a Hercules, and
still unable to stem the tide, but for the vast advantage given
him by nature in constructing Hurricane Hill. He could be approached
by the enemy only in single file. Dick, however, was of the opinion
that something of the kind would be attempted, for the Apaches
could not but know the errand of him who had so nicely outwitted
them.</p>

<p>"Ain't there some way of blocking up the way?" asked Ned, as
they discussed the plan.</p>

<p>"I've been thinkin' it over, and there is," returned Morris,
crossing his legs, and scratching his head in his thoughtful way.
"Three years ago, me and Kit Carson had to scoot up here to get
out of the reach of something like two hundred Comanches, under
that prime devil Valo-Velasquiz. They shot Kit's horse, and mine
dropped dead just as we reached the bottom of the hill, so we
couldn't do anythin' more in the way of hoss-flesh.</p>

<p>"Them Comanches hated Kit and me like pison; they knowed us both,
and they went for us in a way that made us dance around lively;
but it was no go, and we tumbled 'em back like tenpins, but they
kept things so hot that me and Kit tipped over a big rock in the
path. Of course they could climb that easy enough, but it gave
us so much more chance that they didn't try it often, and they
fell back and tried the Apache dodge&mdash;waiting until hunger and
thirst made us come down."</p>

<p>"How was it you got out of the trouble?"</p>

<p>"It was in a mighty queer way&mdash;a mighty queer way. On the next
day arter the brush we had with 'em, a bigger party than ever
came up, and we calc'lated things were goin' to be redhot. But
as soon as the two parties jined, some kind of a rumpus took place.
We could see 'em talkin' in the most excited way, and a high old
quarrel was under way. Kit Carson knowed all about Injins, but
he couldn't make out what all this meant. We was in hope they'd
git into a wrangle themselves, and swaller each other, and I can
tell you they came mighty nigh it.</p>

<p>"Just as it begun to look as if it was goin' that way, one of
their chiefs walked forward, swingin' a dirty rag on the end of
his ramrod as a flag of truce. Kit looked at him very closely,
and then exclaimed that it was Quizto, a great rival of Valo-Velasquiz.
They were always at swords points, and whichever happened to have
the strongest party at his back when they met, outranked the other.
The beauty of it all was that Quizto was a friend all his life
to Kit Carson&mdash;a regular redskin friend, who was ready to scalp
all his brothers and sisters if they tried to harm him&mdash;and when
he came to learn that Kit was treed, he swore that he'd burn at
the stake any Injun that laid a straw in his way.</p>

<p>"This made a time, and, as I's tellin' you, the biggest kind
of a fight. At one time it only lacked a word to set it a-goin';
but Quizto's braves stood by him, every one, and the others had
to knock under.</p>

<p>"When Quizto come forward with his flag of truce, he called out
to Kit and told him that he was at liberty to go wherever he chose
without harm; but as Valo-Velasquiz would be so disappointed,
he thought Carson would turn over his friend, who wasn't of much
account, that they might have the pleasure of torturing him to
death. That was lovely for me, and you ought to have heard Kit
laugh. He told Quizto that he couldn't do that&mdash;both would go
or stay together. That made another wrangle, but the friendship
of the chief to Carson saved the lives of us both. He wouldn't
consent that the guide should run the least risk, and they told
us to come down and clear out. We expected a big fight, for Valo-Velasquiz
had some ugly men with him, and he was a regular devil himself;
but when we got to the bottom, there was two mustangs awaitin',
and we straddled 'em, and warn't long in leavin' those parts.
Old Valo-Velasquiz and a dozen of his warriors tried to sneak
along after us, but we was as well mounted as they, and we rode
into Santa Fe without tradin' rifle shots with any of 'em. That
was a strange thing, but," added the scout, significantly, "I
don't think you've got any Quizto among them skunks down there."</p>
