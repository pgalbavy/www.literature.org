<p>All that evening the clouds gathered, until they closed entirely
over the blue of the sky. They seemed to narrow the space between
earth and heaven, so that there was no room for the air to move
in freely; and the waves, too, lay flat, and yet rigid, as if
they were restrained. The leaves on the bushes and trees in the
garden hung closely together, and the feeling of pressure and
restraint was increased by the short chirping sounds which came
from birds and insects.</p>

<p>So strange were the lights and the silence that the busy hum
of voices which usually filled the dining-room at meal times had
distinct gaps in it, and during these silences the clatter of
the knives upon plates became audible. The first roll of thunder
and the first heavy drop striking the pane caused a little stir.</p>

<p>"It's coming!" was said simultaneously in many different languages.</p>

<p>There was then a profound silence, as if the thunder had withdrawn
into itself. People had just begun to eat again, when a gust of
cold air came through the open windows, lifting tablecloths and
skirts, a light flashed, and was instantly followed by a clap
of thunder right over the hotel. The rain swished with it, and
immediately there were all those sounds of windows being shut
and doors slamming violently which accompany a storm.</p>

<p>The room grew suddenly several degrees darker, for the wind seemed
to be driving waves of darkness across the earth. No one attempted
to eat for a time, but sat looking out at the garden, with their
forks in the air. The flashes now came frequently, lighting up
faces as if they were going to be photographed, surprising them
in tense and unnatural expressions. The clap followed close and
violently upon them. Several women half rose from their chairs
and then sat down again, but dinner was continued uneasily with
eyes upon the garden. The bushes outside were ruffled and whitened,
and the wind pressed upon them so that they seemed to stoop to
the ground. The waiters had to press dishes upon the diners' notice;
and the diners had to draw the attention of waiters, for they
were all absorbed in looking at the storm. As the thunder showed
no signs of withdrawing, but seemed massed right overhead, while
the lightning aimed straight at the garden every time, an uneasy
gloom replaced the first excitement.</p>

<p>Finishing the meal very quickly, people congregated in the hall,
where they felt more secure than in any other place because they
could retreat far from the windows, and although they heard the
thunder, they could not see anything. A little boy was carried
away sobbing in the arms of his mother.</p>

<p>While the storm continued, no one seemed inclined to sit down,
but they collected in little groups under the central skylight,
where they stood in a yellow atmosphere, looking upwards. Now
and again their faces became white, as the lightning flashed,
and finally a terrific crash came, making the panes of the skylight
lift at the joints.</p>

<p>"Ah!" several voices exclaimed at the same moment.</p>

<p>"Something struck," said a man's voice.</p>

<p>The rain rushed down. The rain seemed now to extinguish the lightning
and the thunder, and the hall became almost dark.</p>

<p>After a minute or two, when nothing was heard but the rattle
of water upon the glass, there was a perceptible slackening of
the sound, and then the atmosphere became lighter.</p>

<p>"It's over," said another voice.</p>

<p>At a touch, all the electric lights were turned on, and revealed
a crowd of people all standing, all looking with rather strained
faces up at the skylight, but when they saw each other in the
artificial light they turned at once and began to move away. For
some minutes the rain continued to rattle upon the skylight, and
the thunder gave another shake or two; but it was evident from
the clearing of the darkness and the light drumming of the rain
upon the roof, that the great confused ocean of air was travelling
away from them, and passing high over head with its clouds and
its rods of fire, out to sea. The building, which had seemed so
small in the tumult of the storm, now became as square and spacious
as usual.</p>

<p>As the storm drew away, the people in the hall of the hotel sat
down; and with a comfortable sense of relief, began to tell each
other stories about great storms, and produced in many cases their
occupations for the evening. The chess-board was brought out,
and Mr. Elliot, who wore a stock instead of a collar as a sign
of convalescence, but was otherwise much as usual, challenged
Mr. Pepper to a final contest. Round them gathered a group of
ladies with pieces of needlework, or in default of needlework,
with novels, to superintend the game, much as if they were in
charge of two small boys playing marbles. Every now and then they
looked at the board and made some encouraging remark to the gentlemen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paley just round the corner had her cards arranged in long
ladders before her, with Susan sitting near to sympathise but
not to correct, and the merchants and the miscellaneous people
who had never been discovered to possess names were stretched
in their arm-chairs with their newspapers on their knees. The
conversation in these circumstances was very gentle, fragmentary,
and intermittent, but the room was full of the indescribable stir
of life. Every now and then the moth, which was now grey of wing
and shiny of thorax, whizzed over their heads, and hit the lamps
with a thud.</p>

<p>A young woman put down her needlework and exclaimed, "Poor creature!
it would be kinder to kill it." But nobody seemed disposed to
rouse himself in order to kill the moth. They watched it dash
from lamp to lamp, because they were comfortable, and had nothing
to do.</p>

<p>On the sofa, beside the chess-players, Mrs. Elliot was imparting
a new stitch in knitting to Mrs. Thornbury, so that their heads
came very near together, and were only to be distinguished by
the old lace cap which Mrs. Thornbury wore in the evening. Mrs.
Elliot was an expert at knitting, and disclaimed a compliment
to that effect with evident pride.</p>

<p>"I suppose we're all proud of something," she said, "and I'm
proud of my knitting. I think things like that run in families.
We all knit well. I had an uncle who knitted his own socks to
the day of his death&mdash;and he did it better than any of his daughters,
dear old gentleman. Now I wonder that you, Miss Allan, who use
your eyes so much, don't take up knitting in the evenings. You'd
find it such a relief, I should say&mdash;such a rest to the eyes&mdash;and
the bazaars are so glad of things." Her voice dropped into the
smooth half-conscious tone of the expert knitter; the words came
gently one after another. "As much as I do I can always dispose
of, which is a comfort, for then I feel that I am not wasting
my time&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Allan, being thus addressed, shut her novel and observed
the others placidly for a time. At last she said, "It is surely
not natural to leave your wife because she happens to be in love
with you. But that&mdash;as far as I can make out&mdash;is what the gentleman
in my story does."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, that doesn't sound good&mdash;no, that doesn't sound at
all natural," murmured the knitters in their absorbed voices.</p>

<p>"Still, it's the kind of book people call very clever," Miss
Allan added.</p>

<p>"<em>Maternity</em>&mdash;by Michael Jessop &mdash;I presume," Mr.
Elliot put in, for he could never resist the temptation of talking
while he played chess.</p>

<p>"D'you know," said Mrs. Elliot, after a moment, "I don't think
people <em>do</em> write good novels now&mdash;not as good as they
used to, anyhow."</p>

<p>No one took the trouble to agree with her or to disagree with
her. Arthur Venning who was strolling about, sometimes looking
at the game, sometimes reading a page of a magazine, looked at
Miss Allan, who was half asleep, and said humorously, "A penny
for your thoughts, Miss Allan."</p>

<p>The others looked up. They were glad that he had not spoken to
them. But Miss Allan replied without any hesitation, "I was thinking
of my imaginary uncle. Hasn't every one got an imaginary uncle?"
she continued. "I have one&mdash;a most delightful old gentleman. He's
always giving me things. Sometimes it's a gold watch; sometimes
it's a carriage and pair; sometimes it's a beautiful little cottage
in the New Forest; sometimes it's a ticket to the place I most
want to see."</p>

<p>She set them all thinking vaguely of the things they wanted.
Mrs. Elliot knew exactly what she wanted; she wanted a child;
and the usual little pucker deepened on her brow.</p>

<p>"We're such lucky people," she said, looking at her husband.
"We really have no wants." She was apt to say this, partly in
order to convince herself, and partly in order to convince other
people. But she was prevented from wondering how far she carried
conviction by the entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Flushing, who came
through the hall and stopped by the chess-board. Mrs. Flushing
looked wilder than ever. A great strand of black hair looped down
across her brow, her cheeks were whipped a dark blood red, and
drops of rain made wet marks upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. Flushing explained that they had been on the roof watching
the storm.</p>

<p>"It was a wonderful sight," he said. "The lightning went right
out over the sea, and lit up the waves and the ships far away.
You can't think how wonderful the mountains looked too, with the
lights on them, and the great masses of shadow. It's all over
now."</p>

<p>He slid down into a chair, becoming interested in the final struggle
of the game.</p>

<p>"And you go back to-morrow?" said Mrs. Thornbury, looking at
Mrs. Flushing.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"And indeed one is not sorry to go back," said Mrs. Elliot, assuming
an air of mournful anxiety, "after all this illness."</p>

<p>"Are you afraid of dyin'?" Mrs. Flushing demanded scornfully.</p>

<p>"I think we are all afraid of that," said Mrs. Elliot with dignity.</p>

<p>"I suppose we're all cowards when it comes to the point," said
Mrs. Flushing, rubbing her cheek against the back of the chair.
"I'm sure I am."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it!" said Mr. Flushing, turning round, for Mr.
Pepper took a very long time to consider his move. "It's not cowardly
to wish to live, Alice. It's the very reverse of cowardly. Personally,
I'd like to go on for a hundred years&mdash;granted, of course, that
I had the full use of my faculties. Think of all the things that
are bound to happen!" "That is what I feel," Mrs. Thornbury rejoined.
"The changes, the improvements, the inventions&mdash;and beauty. D'you
know I feel sometimes that I couldn't bear to die and cease to
see beautiful things about me?"</p>

<p>"It would certainly be very dull to die before they have discovered
whether there is life in Mars," Miss Allan added.</p>

<p>"Do you really believe there's life in Mars?" asked Mrs. Flushing,
turning to her for the first time with keen interest. "Who tells
you that? Some one who knows? D'you know a man called&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Thornbury laid down her knitting, and a look of extreme
solicitude came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"There is Mr. Hirst," she said quietly.</p>

<p>St. John had just come through the swing door. He was rather
blown about by the wind, and his cheeks looked terribly pale,
unshorn, and cavernous. After taking off his coat he was going
to pass straight through the hall and up to his room, but he could
not ignore the presence of so many people he knew, especially
as Mrs. Thornbury rose and went up to him, holding out her hand.
But the shock of the warm lamp-lit room, together with the sight
of so many cheerful human beings sitting together at their ease,
after the dark walk in the rain, and the long days of strain and
horror, overcame him completely. He looked at Mrs. Thornbury and
could not speak.</p>

<p>Every one was silent. Mr. Pepper's hand stayed upon his Knight.
Mrs. Thornbury somehow moved him to a chair, sat herself beside
him, and with tears in her own eyes said gently, "You have done
everything for your friend."</p>

<p>Her action set them all talking again as if they had never stopped,
and Mr. Pepper finished the move with his Knight.</p>

<p>"There was nothing to be done," said St. John. He spoke very
slowly. "It seems impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew his hand across his eyes as if some dream came between
him and the others and prevented him from seeing where he was.</p>

<p>"And that poor fellow," said Mrs. Thornbury, the tears falling
again down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Impossible," St. John repeated.</p>

<p>"Did he have the consolation of knowing&mdash;?" Mrs. Thornbury began
very tentatively.</p>

<p>But St. John made no reply. He lay back in his chair, half-seeing
the others, half-hearing what they said. He was terribly tired,
and the light and warmth, the movements of the hands, and the
soft communicative voices soothed him; they gave him a strange
sense of quiet and relief. As he sat there, motionless, this feeling
of relief became a feeling of profound happiness. Without any
sense of disloyalty to Terence and Rachel he ceased to think about
either of them. The movements and the voices seemed to draw together
from different parts of the room, and to combine themselves into
a pattern before his eyes; he was content to sit silently watching
the pattern build itself up, looking at what he hardly saw.</p>

<p>The game was really a good one, and Mr. Pepper and Mr. Elliot
were becoming more and more set upon the struggle. Mrs. Thornbury,
seeing that St. John did not wish to talk, resumed her knitting.</p>

<p>"Lightning again!" Mrs. Flushing suddenly exclaimed. A yellow
light flashed across the blue window, and for a second they saw
the green trees outside. She strode to the door, pushed it open,
and stood half out in the open air.</p>

<p>But the light was only the reflection of the storm which was
over. The rain had ceased, the heavy clouds were blown away, and
the air was thin and clear, although vapourish mists were being
driven swiftly across the moon. The sky was once more a deep and
solemn blue, and the shape of the earth was visible at the bottom
of the air, enormous, dark, and solid, rising into the tapering
mass of the mountain, and pricked here and there on the slopes
by the tiny lights of villas. The driving air, the drone of the
trees, and the flashing light which now and again spread a broad
illumination over the earth filled Mrs. Flushing with exultation.
Her breasts rose and fell.</p>

<p>"Splendid! Splendid!" she muttered to herself. Then she turned
back into the hall and exclaimed in a peremptory voice, "Come
outside and see, Wilfrid; it's wonderful."</p>

<p>Some half-stirred; some rose; some dropped their balls of wool
and began to stoop to look for them.</p>

<p>"To bed&mdash;to bed," said Miss Allan.</p>

<p>"It was the move with your Queen that gave it away, Pepper,"
exclaimed Mr. Elliot triumphantly, sweeping the pieces together
and standing up. He had won the game.</p>

<p>"What? Pepper beaten at last? I congratulate you!" said Arthur
Venning, who was wheeling old Mrs. Paley to bed.</p>

<p>All these voices sounded gratefully in St. John's ears as he
lay half-asleep, and yet vividly conscious of everything around
him. Across his eyes passed a procession of objects, black and
indistinct, the figures of people picking up their books, their
cards, their balls of wool, their work-baskets, and passing him
one after another on their way to bed.</p>
