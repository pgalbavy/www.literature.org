<p>All through the lesson Thea had felt that Harsanyi was restless and
abstracted. Before the hour was over, he pushed back his chair and said
resolutely, “I am not in the mood, Miss Kronborg. I have something on my
mind, and I must talk to you. When do you intend to go home?”
</p><p>Thea turned to him in surprise. “The first of June, about. Mr. Larsen
will not need me after that, and I have not much money ahead. I shall
work hard this summer, though.”
</p><p>“And to-day is the first of May; May-day.” Harsanyi leaned forward, his
elbows on his knees, his hands locked between them. “Yes, I must talk to
you about something. I have asked Madison Bowers to let me bring you to
him on Thursday, at your usual lesson-time. He is the best vocal teacher
in Chicago, and it is time you began to work seriously with your voice.”
</p><p>Thea's brow wrinkled. “You mean take lessons of Bowers?”
</p><p>Harsanyi nodded, without lifting his head.
</p><p>“But I can't, Mr. Harsanyi. I haven't got the time, and, besides--” she
blushed and drew her shoulders up stiffly--“besides, I can't afford to
pay two teachers.” Thea felt that she had blurted this out in the worst
possible way, and she turned back to the keyboard to hide her chagrin.
</p><p>“I know that. I don't mean that you shall pay two teachers. After you go
to Bowers you will not need me. I need scarcely tell you that I shan't
be happy at losing you.”
</p><p>Thea turned to him, hurt and angry. “But I don't want to go to Bowers. I
don't want to leave you. What's the matter? Don't I work hard enough?
I'm sure you teach people that don't try half as hard.”
</p><p>Harsanyi rose to his feet. “Don't misunderstand me, Miss Kronborg. You
interest me more than any pupil I have. I have been thinking for months
about what you ought to do, since that night when you first sang for
me.” He walked over to the window, turned, and came toward her again. “I
believe that your voice is worth all that you can put into it. I have
not come to this decision rashly. I have studied you, and I have become
more and more convinced, against my own desires. I cannot make a singer
of you, so it was my business to find a man who could. I have even
consulted Theodore Thomas about it.”
</p><p>“But suppose I don't want to be a singer? I want to study with you.
What's the matter? Do you really think I've no talent? Can't I be a
pianist?”
</p><p>Harsanyi paced up and down the long rug in front of her. “My girl, you
are very talented. You could be a pianist, a good one. But the early
training of a pianist, such a pianist as you would want to be, must be
something tremendous. He must have had no other life than music. At your
age he must be the master of his instrument. Nothing can ever take the
place of that first training. You know very well that your technique is
good, but it is not remarkable. It will never overtake your
intelligence. You have a fine power of work, but you are not by nature a
student. You are not by nature, I think, a pianist. You would never find
yourself. In the effort to do so, I'm afraid your playing would become
warped, eccentric.” He threw back his head and looked at his pupil
intently with that one eye which sometimes seemed to see deeper than any
two eyes, as if its singleness gave it privileges. “Oh, I have watched
you very carefully, Miss Kronborg. Because you had had so little and had
yet done so much for yourself, I had a great wish to help you. I believe
that the strongest need of your nature is to find yourself, to emerge AS
yourself. Until I heard you sing I wondered how you were to do this, but
it has grown clearer to me every day.”
</p><p>Thea looked away toward the window with hard, narrow eyes. “You mean I
can be a singer because I haven't brains enough to be a pianist.”
</p><p>“You have brains enough and talent enough. But to do what you will want
to do, it takes more than these--it takes vocation. Now, I think you
have vocation, but for the voice, not for the piano. If you knew,”--he
stopped and sighed,--“if you knew how fortunate I sometimes think you.
With the voice the way is so much shorter, the rewards are more easily
won. In your voice I think Nature herself did for you what it would take
you many years to do at the piano. Perhaps you were not born in the
wrong place after all. Let us talk frankly now. We have never done so
before, and I have respected your reticence. What you want more than
anything else in the world is to be an artist; is that true?”
</p><p>She turned her face away from him and looked down at the keyboard. Her
answer came in a thickened voice. “Yes, I suppose so.”
</p><p>“When did you first feel that you wanted to be an artist?”
</p><p>“I don't know. There was always--something.”
</p><p>“Did you never think that you were going to sing?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“How long ago was that?”
</p><p>“Always, until I came to you. It was you who made me want to play
piano.” Her voice trembled. “Before, I tried to think I did, but I was
pretending.”
</p><p>Harsanyi reached out and caught the hand that was hanging at her side.
He pressed it as if to give her something. “Can't you see, my dear girl,
that was only because I happened to be the first artist you have ever
known? If I had been a trombone player, it would have been the same; you
would have wanted to play trombone. But all the while you have been
working with such good-will, something has been struggling against me.
See, here we were, you and I and this instrument,”--he tapped the
piano,--“three good friends, working so hard. But all the while there
was something fighting us: your gift, and the woman you were meant to
be. When you find your way to that gift and to that woman, you will be
at peace. In the beginning it was an artist that you wanted to be; well,
you may be an artist, always.”
</p><p>Thea drew a long breath. Her hands fell in her lap. “So I'm just where I
began. No teacher, nothing done. No money.”
</p><p>Harsanyi turned away. “Feel no apprehension about the money, Miss
Kronborg. Come back in the fall and we shall manage that. I shall even
go to Mr. Thomas if necessary. This year will not be lost. If you but
knew what an advantage this winter's study, all your study of the piano,
will give you over most singers. Perhaps things have come out better for
you than if we had planned them knowingly.”
</p><p>“You mean they have IF I can sing.”
</p><p>Thea spoke with a heavy irony, so heavy, indeed, that it was coarse. It
grated upon Harsanyi because he felt that it was not sincere, an awkward
affectation.
</p><p>He wheeled toward her. “Miss Kronborg, answer me this. YOU KNOW THAT YOU
CAN SING, do you not? You have always known it. While we worked here
together you sometimes said to yourself, 'I have something you know
nothing about; I could surprise you.' Is that also true?”
</p><p>Thea nodded and hung her head.
</p><p>“Why were you not frank with me? Did I not deserve it?”
</p><p>She shuddered. Her bent shoulders trembled. “I don't know,” she
muttered. “I didn't mean to be like that. I couldn't. I can't. It's
different.”
</p><p>“You mean it is very personal?” he asked kindly.
</p><p>She nodded. “Not at church or funerals, or with people like Mr. Larsen.
But with you it was--personal. I'm not like you and Mrs. Harsanyi. I
come of rough people. I'm rough. But I'm independent, too. It was--all I
had. There is no use my talking, Mr. Harsanyi. I can't tell you.”
</p><p>“You needn't tell me. I know. Every artist knows.” Harsanyi stood
looking at his pupil's back, bent as if she were pushing something, at
her lowered head. “You can sing for those people because with them you
do not commit yourself. But the reality, one cannot uncover THAT until
one is sure. One can fail one's self, but one must not live to see that
fail; better never reveal it. Let me help you to make yourself sure of
it. That I can do better than Bowers.”
</p><p>Thea lifted her face and threw out her hands.
</p><p>Harsanyi shook his head and smiled. “Oh, promise nothing! You will have
much to do. There will not be voice only, but French, German, Italian.
You will have work enough. But sometimes you will need to be understood;
what you never show to any one will need companionship. And then you
must come to me.” He peered into her face with that searching, intimate
glance. “You know what I mean, the thing in you that has no business
with what is little, that will have to do only with beauty and power.”
</p><p>Thea threw out her hands fiercely, as if to push him away. She made a
sound in her throat, but it was not articulate. Harsanyi took one of her
hands and kissed it lightly upon the back. His salute was one of
greeting, not of farewell, and it was for some one he had never seen.
</p><p>When Mrs. Harsanyi came in at six o'clock, she found her husband sitting
listlessly by the window. “Tired?” she asked.
</p><p>“A little. I've just got through a difficulty. I've sent Miss Kronborg
away; turned her over to Bowers, for voice.”
</p><p>“Sent Miss Kronborg away? Andor, what is the matter with you?”
</p><p>“It's nothing rash. I've known for a long while I ought to do it. She is
made for a singer, not a pianist.”
</p><p>Mrs. Harsanyi sat down on the piano chair. She spoke a little bitterly:
“How can you be sure of that? She was, at least, the best you had. I
thought you meant to have her play at your students' recital next fall.
I am sure she would have made an impression. I could have dressed her so
that she would have been very striking. She had so much individuality.”
</p><p>Harsanyi bent forward, looking at the floor. “Yes, I know. I shall miss
her, of course.”
</p><p>Mrs. Harsanyi looked at her husband's fine head against the gray window.
She had never felt deeper tenderness for him than she did at that
moment. Her heart ached for him. “You will never get on, Andor,” she
said mournfully.
</p><p>Harsanyi sat motionless. “No, I shall never get on,” he repeated
quietly. Suddenly he sprang up with that light movement she knew so
well, and stood in the window, with folded arms. “But some day I shall
be able to look her in the face and laugh because I did what I could for
her. I believe in her. She will do nothing common. She is uncommon, in a
common, common world. That is what I get out of it. It means more to me
than if she played at my concert and brought me a dozen pupils. All this
drudgery will kill me if once in a while I cannot hope something, for
somebody! If I cannot sometimes see a bird fly and wave my hand to it.”
</p><p>His tone was angry and injured. Mrs. Harsanyi understood that this was
one of the times when his wife was a part of the drudgery, of the
“common, common world.”
</p><p>He had let something he cared for go, and he felt bitterly about
whatever was left. The mood would pass, and he would be sorry. She knew
him. It wounded her, of course, but that hurt was not new. It was as old
as her love for him. She went out and left him alone.
