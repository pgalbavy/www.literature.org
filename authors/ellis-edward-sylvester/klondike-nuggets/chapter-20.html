<p>The error occurred in this way: The trail that the boys had been
assiduously following was so faintly marked that the wonder was
they did not go astray sooner. In many places, there was little
choice as to the route, because it was so broken and crossed that
one was as distinct as the other. Nevertheless, Frank pressed
on with scarcely any hesitation, until he again reached a depression
where the soft ground failed to show the slightest impression
of shoe or hoof.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" he exclaimed, stopping short and looking at his
companion; "how far can we have gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"We can find out only by returning," replied Roswell, wheeling
about and leading the way back.</p>

<p>They walked more hurriedly than before, as a person naturally
does who feels that time is precious, and he has wasted a good
deal of it.</p>

<p>The search might have been continued for a long time but for
a surprising and unexpected aid that came to them. They had halted
at one of the broken places, in doubt whither to turn, and searching
for some sign to guide them, when Roswell called out:</p>

<p>"That beats anything I ever saw!"</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stooped and picked up something from the ground.
Inspecting it for a moment, he held it up for Frank to see. It
was a large nugget of pure gold.</p>

<p>"These mountains must be full of the metal," said Frank, "when
we find it lying loose like that."</p>

<p>"Not so fast," remarked his companion, who had taken the nugget
again, and was turning it over and examining it minutely. "Do
you remember that?"</p>

<p>On one of the faces of the gold something had been scratched
with the point of a knife. While the work was inartistic, it was
easy to make out the letters "F. M."</p>

<p>"I think I remember that," said Frank; "it is one of the nuggets
I found yesterday, and marked it with my initials. Those folks
must have dropped it."</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of it. What amazing carelessness for
a couple of men to drop a chunk of gold worth several hundred
dollars and not miss it!</p>

<p>It must have been that the mouth of the canvas bag containing
the nuggets had become opened in some way to the extent of allowing
a single one to fall out.</p>

<p>"I wonder how many more have been lost," mused Frank, as he put
the specimen in his pocket.</p>

<p>At any rate, it served to show the right course to follow, and
the boys pressed on, looking more for nuggets than for their enemies.
The mishap must have been discovered by the men in time to prevent
its repetition, for nothing of the kind again met the eyes of
the youths, who once more gave their attention to hunting for
the lawless men that had despoiled them of so much property.</p>

<p>The trail steadily ascended, so broken and rough that it was
a source of constant wonderment how the burro was able to keep
his feet. He must have had some experience in mountain climbing
before, in order to play the chamois so well.</p>

<p>The boys fancied they could feel the change of temperature on
account of the increased elevation. They knew they were a good
many feet above the starting-point, though at no time were they
able to obtain a satisfactory view of the country they were leaving
behind. They seemed to be continually passing in and out among
the rocks and bowlders, which circumscribed their field of vision.
Considerable pine and hemlock grew on all sides, but as yet they
encountered no snow. There was plenty of it farther up and beyond,
and it would not take them long to reach the region where eternal
winter reigned.</p>

<p>A short way along the new course, and they paused before another
break; but although the ground was dry and hard, it was easy to
follow the course of the burro, whose hoofs told the story; and
though nothing served to indicate that the men were still with
him, the fact of the three being in company might be set down
as self-evident.</p>

<p>It would not be dark until nearly 10 o'clock, so the pursuers
still had a goodly number of hours before them.</p>

<p>A peculiar fact annoyed the boys more than would be supposed.
The trail was continually winding in and out, its turns so numerous
that rarely or never were they able to see more than a few rods
in advance. In places the winding was incessant. The uncertainty
as to how far they were behind the donkey and the men made the
lads fear that at each turn as they approached it, they would
come upon the party, who, perhaps, might be expecting them, and
would thus take them unprepared. The dread of something like this
often checked the boys and seriously retarded their progress.</p>

<p>"We may as well understand one thing," said Frank, as they halted
again; "you have heard Jeff tell about getting the drop on a man,
Roswell?"</p>

<p>"Yes; everybody knows what that means."</p>

<p>"Well, neither Mr. Hardman, nor his friend, nor both of them
will ever get the drop on us."</p>

<p>The flashing eyes and determined expression left no doubt of
the lad's earnestness.</p>

<p>"Is that because you carry a Winchester and they have only their
revolvers?"</p>

<p>"It would make no difference if both of them had rifles."</p>

<p>Roswell was thoughtful.</p>

<p>"It is very well, Frank, to be brave, but there's nothing gained
by butting your head against a stone wall. Suppose, now, that,
in passing the next bend in this path, you should see Hardman
waiting for you with his gun aimed, and he should call out to
you to surrender, what would you do?"</p>

<p>"Let fly at him as quickly as I could raise my gun to a level."</p>

<p>"And he would shoot before you could do that."</p>

<p>"I'll take the chances," was the rash response.</p>

<p>"I hope you will not have to take any chances like that&mdash;"</p>

<p>They were talking as usual in low tones, and no one more than
a few feet away could have caught the murmur of their voices,
but while Roswell was uttering his words, and before he could
complete his sentence, the two heard a sound, so faint that neither
could guess its nature.</p>

<p>As nearly as they were able to judge, it was as if some person,
in walking, had struck his foot against an obstruction. It came
from a point in front, and apparently just beyond the first bend
in the trail, over which they were making their way.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>WATCHING AT THE TURN IN THE TRAIL</em>.]</p>

<p>"We are nearer to them than we suspected," whispered Roswell.</p>

<p>"And they don't know it, or they wouldn't have betrayed themselves
in that manner."</p>

<p>"It isn't safe to take that for granted."</p>

<p>Roswell, after the last change in their course, was at the front.
Frank now quietly moved beyond him, Winchester in hand, and ready
for whatever might come. Confident they were close upon the men
they sought, he was glad of the misstep that had warned them of
the fact.</p>

<p>There certainly could be no excuse now for Hardman and his companion
securing the advantage over the boys, when one of them held his
Winchester half raised to his shoulder and ready to fire.</p>

<p>Within a couple of paces of the turn in the trail the two were
almost lifted off their feet by a sound that burst from the stillness,
startling enough to frighten the strongest man. It was the braying
of the burro, not fifty feet distant.</p>
