<p>The day of the review rose clear and warm, tempered by a light breeze
from the sea.  As it was a fete day, the harbor wore an air of unwonted
inactivity; no lighters passed heavily from the levees to the
merchantmen at anchor, and the warehouses along the wharves were closed
and deserted.  A thin line of smoke from the funnels of the 'Vesta'
showed that her fires were burning, and the fact that she rode on a
single anchor chain seemed to promise that at any moment she might slip
away to sea.
</p><p>As Clay was finishing his coffee two notes were brought to him from
messengers who had ridden out that morning, and who sat in their
saddles looking at the armed force around the office with amused
intelligence.
</p><p>One note was from Mendoza, and said he had decided not to call out the
regiment at the mines, as he feared their long absence from drill would
make them compare unfavorably with their comrades, and do him more harm
than credit.  "He is afraid of them since last night," was Clay's
comment, as he passed the note on to MacWilliams.  "He's quite right,
they might do him harm."
</p><p>The second note was from Stuart.  He said the city was already wide
awake and restless, but whether this was due to the fact that it was a
fete day, or to some other cause which would disclose itself later, he
could not tell.  Madame Alvarez, the afternoon before, while riding in
the Alameda, had been insulted by a group of men around a café, who had
risen and shouted after her, one of them throwing a wine-glass into her
lap as she rode past.  His troopers had charged the sidewalk and
carried off six of the men to the carcel.  He and Rojas had urged the
President to make every preparation for immediate flight, to have the
horses put to his travelling carriage, and had warned him when at the
review to take up his position at the point nearest to his own
body-guard, and as far as possible from the troops led by Mendoza.
Stuart added that he had absolute confidence in the former.  The
policeman who had attempted to carry Burke's note to Mendoza had
confessed that he was the only traitor in the camp, and that he had
tried to work on his comrades without success. Stuart begged Clay to
join him as quickly as possible.  Clay went up the hill to the Palms,
and after consulting with Mr. Langham, dictated an order to Kirkland,
instructing him to call the men together and to point out to them how
much better their condition had been since they had entered the mines,
and to promise them an increase of wages if they remained faithful to
Mr. Langham's interests, and a small pension to any one who might be
injured "from any cause whatsoever" while serving him.
</p><p>"Tell them, if they are loyal, they can live in their shacks rent free
hereafter," wrote Clay.  "They are always asking for that.  It's a
cheap generosity," he added aloud to Mr. Langham, "because we've never
been able to collect rent from any of them yet."
</p><p>At noon young Langham ordered the best three horses in the stables to
be brought to the door of the Palms for Clay, MacWilliams, and himself.
Clay's last words to King were to have the yacht in readiness to put to
sea when he telephoned him to do so, and he advised the women to have
their dresses and more valuable possessions packed ready to be taken on
board.
</p><p>"Don't you think I might see the review if I went on horseback?" Hope
asked.  "I could get away then, if there should be any trouble."
</p><p>Clay answered with a look of such alarm and surprise that Hope laughed.
</p><p>"See the review!  I should say not," he exclaimed.  "I don't even want
Ted to be there."
</p><p>"Oh, that's always the way," said Hope, "I miss everything.  I think
I'll come, however, anyhow.  The servants are all going, and I'll go
with them disguised in a turban."
</p><p>As the men neared Valencia, Clay turned in his saddle, and asked
Langham if he thought his sister would really venture into the town.
</p><p>"She'd better not let me catch her, if she does," the fond brother
replied.
</p><p>The reviewing party left the Government Palace for the Alameda at three
o'clock, President Alvarez riding on horseback in advance, and Madame
Alvarez sitting in the State carriage with one of her attendants, and
with Stuart's troopers gathered so closely about her that the men's
boots scraped against the wheels, and their numbers hid her almost
entirely from sight.
</p><p>The great square in which the evolutions were to take place was lined
on its four sides by the carriages of the wealthy Olanchoans, except at
the two gates, where there was a wide space left open to admit the
soldiers.  The branches of the trees on the edges of the bare parade
ground were black with men and boys, and the balconies and roofs of the
houses that faced it were gay with streamers and flags, and alive with
women wrapped for the occasion in their colored shawls.  Seated on the
grass between the carriages, or surging up and down behind them, were
thousands of people, each hurrying to gain a better place of vantage,
or striving to hold the one he had, and forming a restless, turbulent
audience in which all individual cries were lost in a great murmur of
laughter, and calls, and cheers.  The mass knit together, and pressed
forward as the President's band swung jauntily into the square and
halted in one corner, and a shout of expectancy went up from the trees
and housetops as the President's body-guard entered at the lower gate,
and the broken place in its ranks showed that it was escorting the
State carriage.  The troopers fell back on two sides, and the carriage,
with the President riding at its head, passed on, and took up a
position in front of the other carriages, and close to one of the sides
of the hollow square.  At Stuart's orders Clay, MacWilliams, and
Langham had pushed their horses into the rear rank of cavalry, and
remained wedged between the troopers within twenty feet of where Madame
Alvarez was sitting.  She was very white, and the powder on her face
gave her an added and unnatural pallor.  As the people cheered her
husband and herself she raised her head slightly and seemed to be
trying to catch any sound of dissent in their greeting, or some
possible undercurrent of disfavor, but the welcome appeared to be both
genuine and hearty, until a second shout smothered it completely as the
figure of old General Rojas, the Vice-President, and the most dearly
loved by the common people, came through the gate at the head of his
regiment.  There was such greeting for him that the welcome to the
President seemed mean in comparison, and it was with an embarrassment
which both felt that the two men drew near together, and each leaned
from his saddle to grasp the other's hand.  Madame Alvarez sank back
rigidly on her cushions, and her eyes flashed with anticipation and
excitement.  She drew her mantilla a little closer about her shoulders,
with a nervous shudder as though she were cold.  Suddenly the look of
anxiety in her eyes changed to one of annoyance, and she beckoned Clay
imperiously to the side of the carriage.
</p><p>"Look," she said, pointing across the square.  "If I am not mistaken
that is Miss Langham, Miss Hope.  The one on the black horse--it must
be she, for none of the native ladies ride.  It is not safe for her to
be here alone.  Go," she commanded, "bring her here to me.  Put her
next to the carriage, or perhaps she will be safer with you among the
troopers."
</p><p>Clay had recognized Hope before Madame Alvarez had finished speaking,
and dashed off at a gallop, skirting the line of carriages.  Hope had
stopped her horse beside a victoria, and was talking to the native
women who occupied it, and who were scandalized at her appearance in a
public place with no one but a groom to attend her.
</p><p>"Why, it's the same thing as a polo match," protested Hope, as Clay
pulled up angrily beside the victoria.  "I always ride over to polo
alone at Newport, at least with James," she added, nodding her head
toward the servant.
</p><p>The man approached Clay and touched his hat apologetically, "Miss Hope
would come, sir," he said, "and I thought I'd better be with her than
to go off and tell Mr. Langham, sir.  I knew she wouldn't wait for me."
</p><p>"I asked you not to come," Clay said to Hope, in a low voice.
</p><p>"I wanted to know the worst at once," she answered.  "I was anxious
about Ted--and you."
</p><p>"Well, it can't be helped now," he said.  "Come, we must hurry, here is
our friend, the enemy."  He bowed to their acquaintances in the
victoria and they trotted briskly off to the side of the President's
carriage, just as a yell arose from the crowd that made all the other
shouts which had preceded it sound like the cheers of children at
recess.
</p><p>"It reminds me of a football match," whispered young Langham,
excitedly, "when the teams run on the field.  Look at Alvarez and Rojas
watching Mendoza."
</p><p>Mendoza advanced at the front of his three troops of cavalry, looking
neither to the left nor right, and by no sign acknowledging the fierce
uproarious greeting of the people. Close behind him came his chosen
band of cowboys and ruffians. They were the best equipped and least
disciplined soldiers in the army, and were, to the great relief of the
people, seldom seen in the city, but were kept moving in the mountain
passes and along the coast line, on the lookout for smugglers with whom
they were on the most friendly terms.  They were a picturesque body of
blackguards, in their hightopped boots and silver-tipped sombreros and
heavy, gaudy saddles, but the shout that had gone up at their advance
was due as much to the fear they inspired as to any great love for them
or their chief.
</p><p>"Now all the chessmen are on the board, and the game can begin," said
Clay.  "It's like the scene in the play, where each man has his sword
at another man's throat and no one dares make the first move."  He
smiled as he noted, with the eye of one who had seen Continental troops
in action, the shuffling steps and slovenly carriage of the half-grown
soldiers that followed Mendoza's cavalry at a quick step.  Stuart's
picked men, over whom he had spent many hot and weary hours, looked
like a troop of Life Guardsmen in comparison.  Clay noted their
superiority, but he also saw that in numbers they were most woefully at
a disadvantage.
</p><p>It was a brilliant scene for so modest a capital.  The sun flashed on
the trappings of the soldiers, on the lacquer and polished metal work
of the carriages; and the Parisian gowns of their occupants and the
fluttering flags and banners filled the air with color and movement,
while back of all, framing the parade ground with a band of black, was
the restless mob of people applauding the evolutions, and cheering for
their favorites, Alvarez, Mendoza, and Rojas, moved by an excitement
that was in disturbing contrast to the easy good-nature of their usual
manner.
</p><p>The marching and countermarching of the troops had continued with
spirit for some time, and there was a halt in the evolutions which left
the field vacant, except for the presence of Mendoza's cavalrymen, who
were moving at a walk along one side of the quadrangle.  Alvarez and
Vice-President Rojas, with Stuart, as an adjutant at their side, were
sitting their horses within some fifty yards of the State carriage and
the body-guard.  Alvarez made a conspicuous contrast in his black coat
and high hat to the brilliant greens and reds of his generals'
uniforms, but he sat his saddle as well as either of the others, and
his white hair, white imperial and mustache, and the dignity of his
bearing distinguished him above them both.  Little Stuart, sitting at
his side, with his blue eyes glaring from under his white helmet and
his face burned to almost as red a tint as his curly hair, looked like
a fierce little bull-dog in comparison.  None of the three men spoke as
they sat motionless and quite alone waiting for the next movement of
the troops.
</p><p>It proved to be one of moment.  Even before Mendoza had ridden toward
them with his sword at salute, Clay gave an exclamation of
enlightenment and concern.  He saw that the men who were believed to be
devoted to Rojas, had been halted and left standing at the farthest
corner of the plaza, nearly two hundred yards from where the President
had taken his place, that Mendoza's infantry surrounded them on every
side, and that Mendoza's cowboys, who had been walking their horses,
had wheeled and were coming up with an increasing momentum, a flying
mass of horses and men directed straight at the President himself.
</p><p>Mendoza galloped up to Alvarez with his sword still in salute. His eyes
were burning with excitement and with the light of success.  No one but
Stuart and Rojas heard his words; to the spectators and to the army he
appeared as though he was, in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief,
delivering some brief report, or asking for instructions.
</p><p>"Dr. Alvarez," he said, "as the head of the army I arrest you for high
treason; you have plotted to place yourself in office without popular
election.  You are also accused of large thefts of public funds.  I
must ask you to ride with me to the military prison.  General Rojas, I
regret that as an accomplice of the President's, you must come with us
also.  I will explain my action to the people when you are safe in
prison, and I will proclaim martial law.  If your troops attempt to
interfere, my men have orders to fire on them and you."
</p><p>Stuart did not wait for his sentence.  He had heard the heavy beat of
the cavalry coming up on them at a trot.  He saw the ranks open and two
men catch at each bridle rein of both Alvarez and Rojas and drag them
on with them, buried in the crush of horses about them, and swept
forward by the weight and impetus of the moving mass behind.  Stuart
dashed off to the State carriage and seized the nearest of the horses
by the bridle.  "To the Palace!" he shouted to his men.  "Shoot any one
who tries to stop you.  Forward, at a gallop," he commanded.
</p><p>The populace had not discovered what had occurred until it was
finished.  The coup d'etat had been long considered and the manner in
which it was to be carried out carefully planned.  The cavalry had
swept across the parade ground and up the street before the people saw
that they carried Rojas and Alvarez with them.  The regiment commanded
by Rojas found itself hemmed in before and behind by Mendoza's two
regiments.  They were greatly outnumbered, but they fired a scattering
shot, and following their captured leader, broke through the line
around them and pursued the cavalry toward the military prison.
</p><p>It was impossible to tell in the uproar which followed how many or how
few had been parties to the plot.  The mob, shrieking and shouting and
leaping in the air, swarmed across the parade ground, and from a dozen
different points men rose above the heads of the people and harangued
them in violent speeches.  And while some of the soldiers and the
citizens gathered anxiously about these orators, others ran through the
city calling for the rescue of the President, for an attack on the
palace, and shrieking "Long live the Government!" and "Long live the
Revolution!"  The State carriage raced through the narrow streets with
its body-guard galloping around it, sweeping down in its rush stray
pedestrians, and scattering the chairs and tables in front of the
cafés.  As it dashed up the long avenue of the palace, Stuart called
his men back and ordered them to shut and barricade the great iron
gates and to guard them against the coming of the mob, while
MacWilliams and young Langham pulled open the carriage door and
assisted the President's wife and her terrified companion to alight.
Madame Alvarez was trembling with excitement as she leaned on Langham's
arm, but she showed no signs of fear in her face or in her manner.
</p><p>"Mr. Clay has gone to bring your travelling carriage to the rear door,"
Langham said.  "Stuart tells us it is harnessed and ready.  You will
hurry, please, and get whatever you need to carry with you.  We will
see you safely to the coast."
</p><p>As they entered the hall, and were ascending the great marble stairway,
Hope and her groom, who had followed in the rear of the cavalry, came
running to meet them.  "I got in by the back way," Hope explained.
"The streets there are all deserted. How can I help you?" she asked,
eagerly.
</p><p>"By leaving me," cried the older woman.  "Good God, child, have I not
enough to answer for without dragging you into this? Go home at once
through the botanical garden, and then by way of the wharves.  That
part of the city is still empty."
</p><p>"Where are your servants; why are they not here?" Hope demanded without
heeding her.  The palace was strangely empty; no footsteps came running
to greet them, no doors opened or shut as they hurried to Madame
Alvarez's apartments.  The servants of the household had fled at the
first sound of the uproar in the city, and the dresses and ornaments
scattered on the floor told that they had not gone empty-handed.  The
woman who had accompanied Madame Alvarez to the review sank weeping on
the bed, and then, as the shouts grew suddenly louder and more near,
ran to hide herself in the upper stories of the house.  Hope crossed to
the window and saw a great mob of soldiers and citizens sweep around
the corner and throw themselves against the iron fence of the palace.
"You will have to hurry," she said.  "Remember, you are risking the
lives of those boys by your delay."
</p><p>There was a large bed in the room, and Madame Alvarez had pulled it
forward and was bending over a safe that had opened in the wall, and
which had been hidden by the head board of the bed. She held up a
bundle of papers in her hand, wrapped in a leather portfolio.  "Do you
see these?" she cried, "they are drafts for five millions of dollars."
She tossed them back into the safe and swung the door shut.
</p><p>"You are a witness.  I do not take them," she said.
</p><p>"I don't understand," Hope answered, "but hurry.  Have you everything
you want--have you your jewels?"
</p><p>"Yes," the woman answered, as she rose to her feet, "they are mine."
</p><p>A yell more loud and terrible than any that had gone before rose from
the garden below, and there was the sound of iron beating against iron,
and cries of rage and execration from a great multitude.
</p><p>"I will not go!" the Spanish woman cried, suddenly.  "I will not leave
Alvarez to that mob.  If they want to kill me, let them kill me."  She
threw the bag that held her jewels on the bed, and pushing open the
window stepped out upon the balcony.  She was conspicuous in her black
dress against the yellow stucco of the wall, and in an instant the mob
saw her and a mad shout of exultation and anger rose from the mass that
beat and crushed itself against the high iron railings of the garden.
Hope caught the woman by the skirt and dragged her back.  "You are
mad," she said.  "What good can you do your husband here?  Save
yourself and he will come to you when he can.  There is nothing you can
do for him now; you cannot give your life for him.  You are wasting it,
and you are risking the lives of the men who are waiting for us below.
Come, I tell you."
</p><p>MacWilliams left Clay waiting beside the diligence and ran from the
stable through the empty house and down the marble stairs to the garden
without meeting any one on his way.  He saw Stuart helping and
directing his men to barricade the gates with iron urns and garden
benches and sentry-boxes.  Outside the mob were firing at him with
their revolvers, and calling him foul names, but Stuart did not seem to
hear them.  He greeted MacWilliams with a cheerful little laugh.
"Well," he asked, "is she ready?"
</p><p>"No, but we are.  Clay and I've been waiting there for five minutes.
We found Miss Hope's groom and sent him back to the Palms with a
message to King.  We told him to run the yacht to Los Bocos and lie off
shore until we came.  He is to take her on down the coast to Truxillo,
where our man-of-war is lying, and they will give her shelter as a
political refugee."
</p><p>"Why don't you drive her to the Palms at once?" demanded Stuart,
anxiously, "and take her on board the yacht there?  It is ten miles to
Bocos and the roads are very bad."
</p><p>"Clay says we could never get her through the city," MacWilliams
answered.  "We should have to fight all the way. But the city to the
south is deserted, and by going out by the back roads, we can make
Bocos by ten o'clock to-night.  The yacht should reach there by seven."
</p><p>"You are right; go back.  I will call off some of my men.  The rest
must hold this mob back until you start; then I will follow with the
others.  Where is Miss Hope?"
</p><p>"We don't know.  Clay is frantic.  Her groom says she is somewhere in
the palace."
</p><p>"Hurry," Stuart commanded.  "If Mendoza gets here before Madame Alvarez
leaves, it will be too late."
</p><p>MacWilliams sprang up the steps of the palace, and Stuart, calling to
the men nearest him to follow, started after him on a run.
</p><p>As Stuart entered the palace with his men at his heels, Clay was
hurrying from its rear entrance along the upper hall, and Hope and
Madame Alvarez were leaving the apartments of the latter at its front.
They met at the top of the main stairway just as Stuart put his foot on
its lower step.  The young Englishman heard the clatter of his men
following close behind him and leaped eagerly forward.  Half way to the
top the noise behind him ceased, and turning his head quickly he looked
back over his shoulder and saw that the men had halted at the foot of
the stairs and stood huddled together in disorder looking up at him.
Stuart glanced over their heads and down the hallway to the garden
beyond to see if they were followed, but the mob still fought from the
outer side of the barricade.  He waved his sword impatiently and
started forward again.  "Come on!" he shouted. But the men below him
did not move.  Stuart halted once more and this time turned about and
looked down upon them with surprise and anger.  There was not one of
them he could not have called by name.  He knew all their little
troubles, their love-affairs, even.  They came to him for comfort and
advice, and to beg for money.  He had regarded them as his children,
and he was proud of them as soldiers because they were the work of his
hands.
</p><p>So, instead of a sharp command, he asked, "What is it?" in surprise,
and stared at them wondering.  He could not or would not comprehend,
even though he saw that those in the front rank were pushing back and
those behind were urging them forward.  The muzzles of their carbines
were directed at every point, and on their faces fear and hate and
cowardice were written in varying likenesses.
</p><p>"What does this mean?" Stuart demanded, sharply.  "What are you waiting
for?"
</p><p>Clay had just reached the top of the stairs.  He saw Madame Alvarez and
Hope coming toward him, and at the sight of Hope he gave an exclamation
of relief.
</p><p>Then his eyes turned and fell on the tableau below, on Stuart's back,
as he stood confronting the men, and on their scowling upturned faces
and half-lifted carbines.  Clay had lived for a longer time among
Spanish-Americans than had the English subaltern, or else he was the
quicker of the two to believe in evil and ingratitude, for he gave a
cry of warning, and motioned the women away.
</p><p>"Stuart!" he cried.  "Come away; for God's sake, what are you doing?
Come back!"
</p><p>The Englishman started at the sound of his friend's voice, but he did
not turn his head.  He began to descend the stairs slowly, a step at a
time, staring at the mob so fiercely that they shrank back before the
look of wounded pride and anger in his eyes. Those in the rear raised
and levelled their rifles.  Without taking his eyes from theirs, Stuart
drew his revolver, and with his sword swinging from its wrist-strap,
pointed his weapon at the mass below him.
</p><p>"What does this mean?" he demanded.  "Is this mutiny?"
</p><p>A voice from the rear of the crowd of men shrieked:  "Death to the
Spanish woman.  Death to all traitors.  Long live Mendoza," and the
others echoed the cry in chorus.
</p><p>Clay sprang down the broad stairs calling, "Come to me;" but before he
could reach Stuart, a woman's voice rang out, in a long terrible cry of
terror, a cry that was neither a prayer nor an imprecation, but which
held the agony of both.  Stuart started, and looked up to where Madame
Alvarez had thrown herself toward him across the broad balustrade of
the stairway.  She was silent with fear, and her hand clutched at the
air, as she beckoned wildly to him.  Stuart stared at her with a
troubled smile and waved his empty hand to reassure her.  The movement
was final, for the men below, freed from the reproach of his eyes,
flung up their carbines and fired, some wildly, without placing their
guns at rest, and others steadily and aiming straight at his heart.
</p><p>As the volley rang out and the smoke drifted up the great staircase,
the subaltern's hands tossed high above his head, his body sank into
itself and toppled backward, and, like a tired child falling to sleep,
the defeated soldier of fortune dropped back into the outstretched arms
of his friend.
</p><p>Clay lifted him upon his knee, and crushed him closer against his
breast with one arm, while he tore with his free hand at the stock
about the throat and pushed his fingers in between the buttons of the
tunic.  They came forth again wet and colored crimson.
</p><p>"Stuart!" Clay gasped.  "Stuart, speak to me, look at me!" He shook the
body in his arms with fierce roughness, peering into the face that
rested on his shoulder, as though he could command the eyes back again
to light and life.  "Don't leave me!" he said.  "For God's sake, old
man, don't leave me!"
</p><p>But the head on his shoulder only sank the closer and the body
stiffened in his arms.  Clay raised his eyes and saw the soldiers still
standing, irresolute and appalled at what they had done, and awe-struck
at the sight of the grief before them.
</p><p>Clay gave a cry as terrible as the cry of a woman who has seen her
child mangled before her eyes, and lowering the body quickly to the
steps, he ran at the scattering mass below him.  As he came they fled
down the corridor, shrieking and calling to their friends to throw open
the gates and begging them to admit the mob.  When they reached the
outer porch they turned, encouraged by the touch of numbers, and halted
to fire at the man who still followed them.
</p><p>Clay stopped, with a look in his eyes which no one who knew them had
ever seen there, and smiled with pleasure in knowing himself a master
in what he had to do.  And at each report of his revolver one of
Stuart's assassins stumbled and pitched heavily forward on his face.
Then he turned and walked slowly back up the hall to the stairway like
a man moving in his sleep.  He neither saw nor heard the bullets that
bit spitefully at the walls about him and rattled among the glass
pendants of the great chandeliers above his head.  When he came to the
step on which the body lay he stooped and picked it up gently, and
holding it across his breast, strode on up the stairs.  MacWilliams and
Langham were coming toward him, and saw the helpless figure in his arms.
</p><p>"What is it?" they cried; "is he wounded, is he hurt?"
</p><p>"He is dead," Clay answered, passing on with his burden.  "Get Hope
away."
</p><p>Madame Alvarez stood with the girl's arms about her, her eyes closed
and her figure trembling.
</p><p>"Let me be!" she moaned.  "Don't touch me; let me die.  My God, what
have I to live for now?"  She shook off Hope's supporting arm, and
stood before them, all her former courage gone, trembling and shivering
in agony.  "I do not care what they do to me!" she cried.  She tore her
lace mantilla from her shoulders and threw it on the floor.  "I shall
not leave this place.  He is dead.  Why should I go?  He is dead.  They
have murdered him; he is dead."
</p><p>"She is fainting," said Hope.  Her voice was strained and hard.
</p><p>To her brother she seemed to have grown suddenly much older, and he
looked to her to tell him what to do.
</p><p>"Take hold of her," she said.  "She will fall."  The woman sank back
into the arms of the men, trembling and moaning feebly.
</p><p>"Now carry her to the carriage," said Hope.  "She has fainted; it is
better; she does not know what has happened."
</p><p>Clay, still bearing the body in his arms, pushed open the first door
that stood ajar before him with his foot.  It opened into the great
banqueting hall of the palace, but he could not choose.
</p><p>He had to consider now the safety of the living, whose lives were still
in jeopardy.
</p><p>The long table in the centre of the hall was laid with places for many
people, for it had been prepared for the President and the President's
guests, who were to have joined with him in celebrating the successful
conclusion of the review.  From outside the light of the sun, which was
just sinking behind the mountains, shone dimly upon the silver on the
board, on the glass and napery, and the massive gilt centre-pieces
filled with great clusters of fresh flowers.  It looked as though the
servants had but just left the room.  Even the candles had been lit in
readiness, and as their flames wavered and smoked in the evening breeze
they cast uncertain shadows on the walls and showed the stern faces of
the soldier presidents frowning down on the crowded table from their
gilded frames.
</p><p>There was a great leather lounge stretching along one side of the hall,
and Clay moved toward this quickly and laid his burden down.  He was
conscious that Hope was still following him.  He straightened the limbs
of the body and folded the arms across the breast and pressed his hand
for an instant on the cold hands of his friend, and then whispering
something between his lips, turned and walked hurriedly away.
</p><p>Hope confronted him in the doorway.  She was sobbing silently. "Must we
leave him," she pleaded, "must we leave him--like this?"
</p><p>From the garden there came the sound of hammers ringing on the iron
hinges, and a great crash of noises as the gate fell back from its
fastenings, and the mob rushed over the obstacles upon which it had
fallen.  It seemed as if their yells of exultation and anger must reach
even the ears of the dead man.
</p><p>"They are calling Mendoza," Clay whispered, "he must be with them.
Come, we will have to run for our lives now."
</p><p>But before he could guess what Hope was about to do, or could prevent
her, she had slipped past him and picked up Stuart's sword that had
fallen from his wrist to the floor, and laid it on the soldier's body,
and closed his hands upon its hilt.  She glanced quickly about her as
though looking for something, and then with a sob of relief ran to the
table, and sweeping it of an armful of its flowers, stepped swiftly
back again to the lounge and heaped them upon it.
</p><p>"Come, for God's sake, come!" Clay called to her in a whisper from the
door.
</p><p>Hope stood for an instant staring at the young Englishman as the
candle-light flickered over his white face, and then, dropping on her
knees, she pushed back the curly hair from about the boy's forehead and
kissed him.  Then, without turning to look again, she placed her hand
in Clay's and he ran with her, dragging her behind him down the length
of the hall, just as the mob entered it on the floor below them and
filled the palace with their shouts of triumph.
</p><p>As the sun sank lower its light fell more dimly on the lonely figure in
the vast dining-hall, and as the gloom deepened there, the candles
burned with greater brilliancy, and the faces of the portraits shone
more clearly.
</p><p>They seemed to be staring down less sternly now upon the white mortal
face of the brother-in-arms who had just joined them.
</p><p>One who had known him among his own people would have seen in the
attitude and in the profile of the English soldier a likeness to his
ancestors of the Crusades who lay carved in stone in the village
church, with their faces turned to the sky, their faithful hounds
waiting at their feet, and their hands pressed upward in prayer.
</p><p>And when, a moment later, the half-crazed mob of men and boys swept
into the great room, with Mendoza at their head, something of the
pathos of the young Englishman's death in his foreign place of exile
must have touched them, for they stopped appalled and startled, and
pressed back upon their fellows, with eager whispers.  The
Spanish-American General strode boldly forward, but his eyes lowered
before the calm, white face, and either because the lighted candles and
the flowers awoke in him some memory of the great Church that had
nursed him, or because the jagged holes in the soldier's tunic appealed
to what was bravest in him, he crossed himself quickly, and then
raising his hands slowly to his visor, lifted his hat and pointed with
it to the door.  And the mob, without once looking back at the rich
treasure of silver on the table, pushed out before him, stepping
softly, as though they had intruded on a shrine.
