They're gone&mdash;again the red-men rally<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With dance and song the woods resound;<br/>
The hatchet's buried in the valley;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No foe profanes our hunting-ground!<br/>
The green leaves on the blithe boughs quiver,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The verdant hills with song-birds ring,<br/>
While our bark canoes, the river<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Skim, like swallows on the wing.<br/>

<p>As the Riflemen reached the spot where the settlers were awaiting
them, the preparations for resuming the journey were instantly
made. The dead oxen were rolled to one side, and on the hardened
ground the wagon was easily dragged by the remaining yoke. The
hunters and experienced men of the party were certain that the
Shawnees had fled, and that, for the present at least, there was
no further danger from them; but, in order to quiet the fears
of the women, a thorough examination of the surrounding woods
was made. This search resulted only in the discovery of the dead
bodies of the Indians. As the Riflemen never scalped a savage,
the bodies were left undisturbed.</p>

<p>"Where the deuce has Lew gone to?" demanded O'Hara, after several
times looking around him.</p>

<p>Those who were acquainted with the facts of the case looked in
each other's face, as if in doubt what to reply.</p>

<p>"Don't anybody know? eh? Say!" he repeated, in an angry voice.</p>

<p>"He's taken a near cut to the settlement," replied the elder
Smith.</p>

<p>"<em>Anybody go with him?</em>"</p>

<p>"He took a female, believing that her safety demanded such a
course."</p>

<p>"Lew never had more sense than he needed, and it's all gone now.
Cutting across through the woods with a gal," repeated O'Hara,
in a contemptuous tone. "Just as though she'd be safer with him
than with us. I hope the Shawnees will get on his trail and catch
both."</p>

<p>"What do you want the gal caught for?" demanded Harry Smith,
blustering up.</p>

<p>"She'd no business to be such a fool as to go with him."</p>

<p>"I never allow any one to say any thing against her," added young
Smith, growing red in the face.</p>

<p>"If you want your head broke, just say so," said O'Hara, savagely.</p>

<p>"Come, come," interrupted the elder Smith, "boys should be careful
not to get mad. Shut up, each of you, or I'll whip both of you."</p>

<p>This ended the high words between the two parties, and five minutes
later they were conversing together on as friendly and good terms
as it can be possible between two mortals.</p>

<p>All things being in readiness, the party resumed their journey,
using the same caution that had characterized their march previous
to the attack of the Indians. The Riflemen themselves performed
the part of scouts, and the progress was uninterrupted by any
incident worth mentioning until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The sky, which had been of a threatening character for several
hours, now became overcast, and it was evident that a violent
storm was about to break upon them. This being the case, there
was nothing to be gained by pressing onward, and the settlers
accordingly halted for the night. A sort of barricade was made
around the wagon, so that, in case of attack, a good resistance
could be made, and the oxen were secured fast to the wagon. Stakes
were cut and driven into the ground, and a strong piece of canvas,
which had been brought for the purpose, stretched across them
in such a manner that a comfortable shelter was afforded those
whose duty did not compel them to brave the storm.</p>

<p>These arrangements were hardly completed, when a dull, roaring
sound, like that of the ocean, was heard in the woods. It came
rapidly nearer, and in a few moments the swaying trees showed
that it was passing onward over the camp. The frightened and bewildered
birds circled screaming overhead, the rotten limbs and twigs went
flying through the air, and thick darkness gathered at once over
the forest. A moment later, several big drops of water pattered
through the leaves like so many bullets and immediately the rain
came down in torrents. The thunder booming in the distance, then
sharply exploding like a piece of ordnance directly overhead,
the crack of the solid oak as the thunderbolt tore it to splinters,
the incessant streaming of the lightning across the sky, the soughing
of the wind&mdash;all these made a scene terrifically grand, and would
have induced almost any one to have sought the shelter offered
him, convinced that the only danger at such a time was from the
elements themselves.</p>

<p>But with the Riflemen the case was far different. They well knew
that it was just at such times that the wily Indian prowled through
the woods in quest of his victims, and that at no other period
was his watchfulness so great as at one like the present. Thus
it was that three of the Miami Riflemen braved the terrors of
the storm on that night, and thus it was that all three were witnesses
of the occurrences we are about to narrate.</p>

<p>The storm continued without intermission almost the entire night.
The only change perceptible was in the thunder and lightning.
The flashes of the latter grew less and less, until several minutes
frequently elapsed between them; but the rain came down as if
the "windows of heaven were opened," and a minute's exposure was
sufficient to drench one to the skin, while the wind, soughing
through the trees, made the hours as dismal and dreary as it was
possible for them to be.</p>

<p>The three Riflemen who stood as sentinels, were Dick, George
Dernor and O'Hara. No changes were made during the night, as the
men would have looked upon such a proceeding as childish and foolish.
O'Hara was leaning against a tree, some ten or fifteen yards from
the camp, watching that portion of the wood which immediately
surrounded him, as well as the occasional gleams of lightning
would permit. While doing this, his gaze fell upon a stump, about
twenty feet distant. As the lightning flamed out, he saw distinctly
a bareheaded man seated upon it!</p>

<p>At first sight of this singular apparition, O'Hara started, rubbed
his eyes, fixed his gaze upon the spot, believing that he had
been deceived. A moment later, as another flash illuminated the
wood, he saw the man again. He was seated on the edge of the stump,
his feet and arms hanging down, and, as stated before, without
any covering for his head. The latter was bullet-shaped, and the
view which was afforded of him was so perfect, that the hunter
saw he had short, curly hair, of a reddish color. His eyes were
small, but sparkling like an Indian's, and, when they could be
seen, were fixed with frightful intensity upon the Rifleman. The
whole expression of his face was forbidding and repulsive.</p>

<p>At the first distinct view of this man, came the conviction to
O'Hara that he had seen him before, and he spent a few minutes
in endeavoring to remember where and when it was. He was unable
to do so, however, although he was positive that he was an enemy
to him.</p>

<p>"I don't care who he is," muttered O'Hara; "he ought to know
better than to squat out there when he knows I have seen him.
I say, old chap," he called, in a louder tone, "come down off
that stump, or I'll fetch you."</p>

<p>Whoever the person addressed might be, it was evident he cared
nothing for the command of the hunter, for the latter, the next
moment, saw him, not only seated as immobile as ever, but with
a sneer of contempt upon his face. This so exasperated O'Hara
that he instantly called out: "I'll give you two seconds to get
off of that, and if you don't do it in that time, I'll tumble
you off."</p>

<p>He brought his rifle to his shoulder, so as to be ready to fire
if the man remained. He held it thus full a minute, at the end
of which he discerned the foolhardy being who had not changed
his position in the least. Hesitating no longer, he pointed his
piece directly at his heart, and discharged it.</p>

<p>"It's your own fault," mused the hunter. "I gave you fair warning
and plenty time to get out the way, and in such places as we're
in just now, we can't afford to stand on ceremony. You must be
careful&#11834;"</p>

<p>Again the red lightning flamed out, and revealed the man, seated
as before, the sneer on his face having increased, and his eyes
flaming with more dreadful intensity than ever!</p>

<p>"Man or spirit," said O'Hara, now thoroughly startled, "I'll
give you another shot at any rate."</p>

<p>He reloaded, and, awaiting his opportunity, fired again full
at the man's breast. O'Hara's hair nearly lifted the cap from
his head, when he saw his foe sitting unharmed, and as scornful
as though no bullet could wound him. The bravest man has his weakness,
and the greatest weakness of such characters as the man we are
dealing with is their superstition. O'Hara verily believed the
man at whom he had fired possessed more than mortal attributes,
and, far more frightened than he would have been had a score of
Shawnees sounded their war-whoop in his ears, he made a low whistle
as a signal for Dick and Dernor to come up. In a moment they were
beside him, curious to know the cause of his firing.</p>

<p>The next flash of lightning showed three hunters intently staring
toward a man who was sitting composedly on a stump, and staring
back at them with equal intensity.</p>

<p>"You all seen him, didn't you?" asked Tom, in a whisper. Receiving
an affirmative answer, he added:</p>

<p>"Let's all aim square at his breast, and then we'll be sure that
one of us at least will hit him. If that doesn't finish him, there's
no use of trying."</p>

<p>For the third time, the mysterious being braved the deadly bullets,
this time from three separate rifles, and for the third time he
was seen sitting, unharmed and contemptuous, upon the stump.</p>

<p>"It's all a waste of powder," said O'Hara. "We might pour a broadside
from a brigade into him without making him wink."</p>

<p>"Let's go up and take him," said Dick.</p>

<p>"He'll take <em>us</em>," said O'Hara, who was not ashamed of
his fright in such a case as this.</p>

<p>"Fudge! don't be frightened; come along. I'll lead."</p>

<p>Thus strengthened, O'Hara moved on behind the two others. Most
assuredly the mysterious personage would have been captured, had
not the lightning, which continued to act the part of illuminator,
discovered their approach to him. His feet were instantly seen
to twinkle in the air, and he whisked off the stump as quick as
thought, and disappeared. To make sure, however, the Riflemen
passed their hands over the stump, but of course found nothing.
The booming of the thunder had been so continuous, that the reports
of the rifles had not awakened the settlers, and the three hunters
conversed together without fear of disturbance.</p>

<p>"I don't care what he is," said O'Hara, "I'm sure I've seen him
before."</p>

<p>"Just what I am sure of," added Dick. "The very second I laid
my eyes on him, his face seemed familiar. But it must have been
several years ago."</p>

<p>"It's queer I can't remember," repeated O'Hara, as if talking
with himself.</p>

<p>"I remember having seen him, too, I'll be hanged if I don't,"
added George Dernor, with a dogged decision.</p>

<p>O'Hara made a leap fully six feet from the ground, and uttered
a half-whistle, indicative of some great discovery.</p>

<p>"What's up? what's the matter?" asked Dick, considerably surprised.</p>

<p>"Just one of you break my head, will you, for I'm the greatest
fool that ever lived. I remember now who that man is."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>O'Hara repeated a name that fairly took the breath away from
the others. They had let one of the most inhuman villains of the
day escape, and one for whose life either of the Riflemen would
have undergone any sacrifice. The mention of his name, too, revealed
to them the reason why he had been unharmed by their shots.</p>

<p>"We fired at his <em>breast</em> every time," said O'Hara. "If
we had only fired at some other part of his body, he would have
been riddled. What a precious set of fools we are!"</p>

<p>As no one disputed this exclamation, it may be supposed that
all agreed to it. At any rate, their vexation was extreme for
having failed to remember the man who, at that particular time,
was probably more notorious than any other living being in the
West.</p>

<p>"What's done can't be helped," remarked Dick. "If we ever have
the chance to draw bead on him again, we'll <em>know where to
aim</em>."</p>

<p>Nothing further was seen of the man who had braved their utmost
through the night. He had taken his departure, and was fated to
play an important <em>rôle</em> with a couple of our other friends.</p>

<p>The storm abated toward morning, and the settlers were once more
under way. Their destination, a small frontier settlement, was
reached late in the day, without any further incident, and their
dangers for the present were ended. To the unbounded surprise
of all, they learned that Lewis Dernor and Edith had not arrived,
and there had been nothing heard of them.</p>

<p>This caused the most painful apprehension with all, for they
knew well enough that they would have been in several hours ahead
of them, had not something unusual prevented. They could imagine
but one cause &mdash;Indians!</p>

<p>The settlers commenced their labors at once. Trees were felled,
and the foundations of strong, substantial cabins laid, ground
was cleared and prepared to receive the seed, while the garrison
of the block-house was strengthened, and the condition of the
settlement improved by every means at their command.</p>

<p>Lewis had left a request with the emigrants, upon taking Edith
from them, that the Riflemen should await his return at this settlement,
and they accordingly remained. Two days passed without his coming
in, when the anxiety of Edith's friends became so great, that
it was determined to form a party to go in quest of her; but,
upon mentioning the resolve to O'Hara, he strenuously opposed
it, affirming that a large party could accomplish nothing at all,
save to get themselves in trouble. In this opinion he was joined
by several of the more experienced, and as a consequence, the
scheme was abandoned. O'Hara then expressed the intention of taking
a companion and going in search of them himself. The companion
he chose was Dick Allmat.</p>

<p>Sego took an active interest in these proceedings, but as yet
had not heard the name of Edith Sudbury mentioned. Indeed, none
knew that name except her immediate friends, who heeded the request
which Lewis had made, that it should be kept a secret. Thus it
happened that he entertained not the slightest suspicion of the
true state of the case. Had he known it, nothing could have hindered
him from hurrying forth at once to the rescue.</p>

<p>O'Hara and Dick left the settlement one day about noon, and struck
off in the woods toward the creek where the affray with the Shawnees
had occurred. It was their design to take the trail, if possible,
and follow it up until they discovered a clue to the unaccountable
state of affairs. On reaching the creek, however, they were chagrined
to find their fears realized. The storm which we have mentioned
as succeeding the departure of Lewis and Edith, had completely
obliterated all traces of their footsteps, and the Riflemen were
left with no dependence except their wood-craft.</p>

<p>This, in the end, answered their purpose. Examining the woods
with the eye of a true hunter, O'Hara satisfied himself of the
course his leader would take, and this he pursued with the dogged
persistency of the Indian himself. He was confident that the trail
which he and the girl had made subsequent to the storm could be
followed without difficulty, if he could only strike it. But just
here lay the trouble.</p>

<p>"It looks likely," said O'Hara, as he and Dick stood deliberating
upon the proper course to pursue, "that he would take the nearest
cut to the settlement, and then again it doesn't look so likely.
Lew is such a fool, there's no telling what he'd do."</p>

<p>"Why do you think he wouldn't take the shortest way home?"</p>

<p>"'Cause he wouldn't, that's why. You see, Dick," added Tom, in
a more pleasant voice, "Shawnees are in the woods, and it's no
ways unpossible that they haven't learned that them two fools
are tramping through the country. If they do it, why it looks
nateral that they'd s'pose they'd try to reach home just as soon
as they could, and would try to head 'em off. Now, if the red-skins
know this, Lew knows also that they know it, and I hope, for our
own credit, he's got too much sense to walk into any of their
traps. That's the reason why I think he may have took a longer
way home."</p>

<p>"Just exactly what he has done," said Dick in a glow of admiration.</p>

<p>"How do you know it is, eh?"</p>

<p>"I mean I think so, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, say what you mean, next time. And that is what makes all
the difficulty. How are we to know where to look for his trail?"</p>

<p>"It's pretty certain we won't find it by standing here all day."</p>

<p>"You go west and I will follow the creek, and when you stumble
on any thing worth looking at, just give the whistle."</p>

<p>The two did as proposed. Dick ranged backward and forward until
nightfall, while O'Hara examined the banks of the creek, until
the gathering darkness made it a hopeless task. Upon coming together,
they had nothing favorable to report, and thus ended the first
day's search.</p>

<p>"You know what I'm certain of?" asked O'Hara, as they were ready
to resume the hunt upon the next morning.</p>

<p>"No, of course not."</p>

<p>"I'm sure that that red-headed villain that we fired at on the
stump is mixed up in this affair."</p>

<p>Dick opened his eyes at this startling thought, and replied,
in a few moments:</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder at all if he really was. Hang him! it's just
the business that suits him. But Lew ought to know enough for
him."</p>

<p>"Every man is a fool when he is in love," said O'Hara, contemptuously,
"and that's the reason why I'm pretty certain both of 'em are
in trouble. If he wasn't in love with the gal, he might know what
to do; but&mdash;oh! heavens," he added, unable to find words to express
his disgust at his leader betraying such a weakness.</p>

<p>"I s'pose we'll hunt as we did yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Of course. Let's go at it at once."</p>

<p>O'Hara returned to the creek and resumed his search along the
banks, while Dick took to the woods as before. A half-hour later,
a whistle from the former called him to the stream, where he found
his friend bending over some "sign" that he had discovered in
the soft earth of the shore.</p>

<p>"It's his," said O'Hara, "as sure as you live. They spent the
night on the other side of the creek, and he has carried her across
the next morning, and taken to the woods at this point."</p>

<p>"We can easily tell the direction he has taken, then."</p>

<p>"Not so easy, either; for don't you see he has gone <em>up</em>
the creek, which ain't toward home. I tell you what it is, Lew
has smelled danger, and if the red-skins have catched him, there's
been some splendid fun afore they done it. Lew ain't such a fool,
after all."</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Dick, in a low tone, for he entertained
a strong affection for his leader, "Do you think it is <em>certain</em>
Lew has been catched?"</p>

<p>"NO <em>SIR," </em>replied O'Hara, in tones so loud that they
woke an echo through the woods. "It ain't certain by no means.
He may have thought it best to make a long circle before reaching
home, and like enough he is in the settlement this minute, or
very near there. But I guess not," he added, after a minute's
pause, and in a different voice. "Things look dubious, and we
may have a big job before us."</p>

<p>"Let's go to work at once."</p>

<p>"The first sensible words you've spoken this morning, when it
seems we're both doing more talking than is necessary. Come on."</p>

<p>The trail was followed with the greatest difficulty, for the
time which had elapsed since it was made was almost sufficient
to obliterate it entirely. Now and then, where the ground was
more favorable, it was easily discernible. After progressing a
mile or so, O'Hara exclaimed, with an air of perplexity:</p>

<p>"There is something here that I don't understand. I've seen only
<em>the track of one person up to this time</em>."</p>

<p>"She isn't with him, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but he <em>appears to be carrying her</em>; and what that
means is more than I can tell. It can't be she's hurt."</p>

<p>"Maybe, Tom, we ain't on the track of Lew," said Dick, with a
hopeful gleam.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are. I could tell his track among a thousand. The mistake
isn't <em>there</em>. All we've got to do is to follow it."</p>

<p>The pursuit was renewed and kept up until the bank of a smaller
stream was reached, where the trail was irrecoverably lost. After
leading into the water, it failed to come out upon the opposite
side, and the utmost skill of the hunters was unable to regain
it. The entire day was consumed by them in the search, when it
was given up as hopeless. It would have been hard to tell which
feeling predominated in the breasts of the two Riflemen&mdash;an apprehensive
anxiety for the fate of their leader, or a gratifying pride at
this evidence which he had given of his consummate knowledge of
woodcraft.</p>

<p>These two hunters continued their hunt for two days more, when
they returned to the settlement and reported their failure to
gain any definite knowledge of Dernor and Edith. Neither had the
settlers gained any tidings of them.</p>

<p>Where were they?</p>
