<p>Avon Burnet, at the age of eighteen, was one of the finest horsemen
that ever scurried over the plains of Western Texas, on his matchless
mustang Thunderbolt.</p>

<p>He was a native of the Lone Star State, where, until he was thirteen
years old, he attended the common school, held in a log cabin
within three miles of his home, after which he went to live with
his uncle, Captain Dohm Shirril, with whom the orphan son of his
sister had been a favorite from infancy.</p>

<p>Avon was bright, alert, unusually active, and exceedingly fond
of horses from the time he was able to walk. His uncle had served
through the Civil War in the Confederate army, returning to Texas
at the close of hostilities, thoroughly "reconstructed," and only
anxious to recover his fortunes, which had been scattered to the
four winds of heaven during the long, bitter struggle.</p>

<p>The captain had no children of his own, and it was natural, therefore,
that he and his wife should feel the strongest attachment for
the boy who was placed in their care, and who, should his life
be spared, would inherit whatever his new parents might be able
to leave behind them when called to depart.</p>

<p>Avon had reached the age named, when to his delight he was told
that he was to accompany the large herd of cattle which was to
be driven northward, through upper Texas, the Indian Nation, and
Kansas over the Great Cattle Trail, along which hundreds of thousands
of hoofs have tramped during the years preceding and following
the War for the Union.</p>

<p>Young as was our hero, he had served his apprenticeship at the
cattle business, and was an expert at the round-up, in branding,
in cutting out, in herding, and all the arduous requirements of
a cowboy's life. It was understood, therefore, that he was to
be rated as a full hand among the eight men who, under his uncle,
were to have charge of two thousand cattle about to start on the
long tramp northward.</p>

<p>"It's the hardest kind of work," said the captain to his nephew,
as the two sat in the low, flat structure where the veteran made
his home, with his wife and one colored servant, "but I haven't
any fear that you will not pull through all right."</p>

<p>"If I am not able to do so <em>now</em>, I never shall be," replied
Avon, with a smile, as he sat on the rough, home-made stool, slowly
whittling a piece of wood, while his aunt, looking up from her
sewing, remarked in her quiet way:</p>

<p>"It will be lonesome without Avon."</p>

<p>"But not so bad as when uncle was off to the war," ventured the
youth, gazing affectionately at the lady.</p>

<p>The captain was sitting with his legs crossed, slowly smoking
the old briarwood which he had carried through many a fierce campaign,
and seemingly sunk in deep thought. Like his nephew, he was clad
in the strong serviceable costume of the Texan cowboy, his broad
sombrero resting with a number of blankets on pegs in the wall.</p>

<p>It was evening, with a cold, piercing wind almost like one of
the cutting northers blowing around the homely structure. The
herd were gathered at a point about five miles to the northward,
whence the real start was to be made at an early hour on the morrow.
This arrangement permitted the captain and his young friend to
spend their last night at home.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mrs. Shirril, referring to the last remark of her
nephew, "there never can be any worse days than those, when I
did not know whether your uncle had not been dead for weeks or
possibly months."</p>

<p>"You must have had pretty tough times, aunt."</p>

<p>"Well, they might have been improved, but Dinah and I managed
to get along a great deal better than some of our neighbors. Here
in Texas we were so far from the war that I may say I never heard
a hostile shot fired, except by the Indians who came down this
way now and then."</p>

<p>"They were the same, I suppose, that still trouble us."</p>

<p>"I believe so, mostly Comanches and sometimes Kioways, with perhaps
others that we didn't know. They did much to prevent our life
from becoming dull," added the brave little lady, with another
smile.</p>

<p>"The women in those days had to know how to shoot the rifle,
ride horses, and do the work of the absent men."</p>

<p>"I don't know how we could have got along if we hadn't learned
all those things. For years I never knew the taste of coffee,
and only rarely was able to obtain a pinch of coarse brown sugar;
but we did not suffer for meat, and, with the help of Dinah, we
could get a few things out of the earth, so that, on the whole,
I think I had much easier times than my husband."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," remarked Captain Shirril, rousing
himself; "we had rough days and nights, beyond all doubt, but
after all, there was something about it which had its charm. There
was an excitement in battle, a thrill in the desperate ride when
on a scout, a glory in victory, and even a grim satisfaction in
defeat, caused by the belief that we were not conquered, or that,
if we were driven back, it was by <em>Americans</em>, and not
by foreigners."</p>

<p>"That's an odd way of putting it," remarked the wife, "but was
it not the high health, which you all felt because of your rough
outdoor life? You know when a person is strong and rugged, he
can stand almost anything, and find comfort in that which at any
other time brings only wretchedness and suffering."</p>

<p>"I suppose that had a good deal to do with it, and that, too,
may have had much to do with sustaining you and Dinah in your
loneliness."</p>

<p>The captain raised his eyes and looked at two old-fashioned muzzle-loading
rifles, suspended on a couple of deer's antlers over the fireplace,
and smiling through his shaggy whiskers, said:</p>

<p>"You found them handy in those days, Edna?"</p>

<p>"We never could have got along without them. They served to bring
down a maverick, or one of our own cattle, when we were nearly
starving, and sometimes they helped drive off the Indians."</p>

<p>Captain Shirril shifted his position, as though uneasy over something.
His wife, who was familiar with all his moods, looked inquiringly
at him.</p>

<p>"What troubles you, Dohm?"</p>

<p>"If I hadn't promised Avon that he should go with me northward,
I would make him stay at home."</p>

<p>Wife and nephew stared wonderingly at him.</p>

<p>"The Comanches have been edging down this way for more than a
week past; I believe they mean to make trouble."</p>

<p>It would be supposed that such an announcement as this caused
dismay, but it did not. Even Dinah, who was busy about her household
duties, and who heard the remark, paused only a moment to turn
up her nose and say scornfully:</p>

<p>"If dey've done forgot how we allers sarve de likes ob dem, jes'
let 'em try it agin. Dat's all."</p>

<p>She was a tall, muscular negress, whom an ordinary man might
hesitate to make angry. She passed to another part of the room,
after muttering the words, and seemed to feel no further interest
in a subject which ought to have made her blood tingle with excitement.</p>

<p>"If the Comanches are hovering anywhere in the neighborhood,"
said Mrs. Shirril in her gentle way, "it is in the hope of running
off some of the cattle; you have them all herded and under such
careful care that this cannot be done. When the Indians find you
have started northward with them, they will follow or go westward
to their hunting grounds; surely they will not stay <em>here</em>."</p>

<p>"I wish I could believe as you do."</p>

<p>"And why can't you, husband?"</p>

<p>"Because Indian nature is what it is; you understand that as
well as I. Finding that they cannot steal any of our cattle, they
will try to revenge themselves by burning my home and slaying
my wife and servant."</p>

<p>"But they have tried that before."</p>

<p>"True, but their failures are no ground to believe they will
fail again."</p>

<p>"It is the best ground we can have for such belief."</p>
