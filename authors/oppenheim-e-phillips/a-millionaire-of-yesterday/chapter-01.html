"Filth," grunted Trent - "ugh!  I tell you what it is, my venerable
friend - I have seen some dirty cabins in the west of Ireland and
some vile holes in East London.  I've been in some places which I
can't think of even now without feeling sick.  I'm not a particular
chap, wasn't brought up to it - no, nor squeamish either, but this
is a bit thicker than anything I've ever knocked up against.  If
Francis doesn't hurry we'll have to chuck it!  We shall never stand
it out, Monty!"
<P>
The older man, gaunt, blear-eyed, ragged, turned over on his side.
His appearance was little short of repulsive.  His voice when he
spoke was, curiously enough, the voice of a gentleman, thick and a
trifle rough though it sounded.
<P>
"My young friend," he said, "I agree with you - in effect - most
heartily.  The place is filthy, the surroundings are repulsive, not
to add degrading.  The society is - er - not congenial - I allude
of course to our hosts - and the attentions of these unwashed, and
I am afraid I must say unclothed, ladies of dusky complexion is to
say the least of it embarrassing."
<P>
"Dusky complexion!" Trent interrupted scornfully, "they're coal
black!"
<P>
Monty nodded his head with solemn emphasis.  "I will go so far as
to admit that you are right," he acknowledged.  "They are as black
as sin!  But, my friend Trent, I want you to consider this: If the
nature of our surroundings is offensive to you, think what it must
be to me.  I may, I presume, between ourselves, allude to you as
one of the people.  Refinement and luxury have never come in your
way, far less have they become indispensable to you.  You were, I
believe, educated at a Board School, I was at Eton.  Afterwards you
were apprenticed to a harness-maker, I - but no matter!  Let us
summarise the situation."
<P>
"If that means cutting it short, for Heaven's sake do so," Trent
grumbled.  "You'll talk yourself into a fever if you don't mind.
Let's know what you're driving at."
<P>
"Talking," the elder man remarked with a slight shrug of his
shoulders, "will never have a prejudicial effect upon my health.
To men of your - pardon me - scanty education the expression of
ideas in speech is doubtless a labour.  To me, on the other hand,
it is at once a pleasure and a relief.  What I was about to
observe is this: I belong by birth to what are called, I believe,
the classes, you to the masses.  I have inherited instincts which
have been refined and cultivated, perhaps over-cultivated by
breeding and associations - you are troubled with nothing of the
sort.  Therefore if these surroundings, this discomfort, not to
mention the appalling overtures of our lady friends, are distressing
to you, why, consider how much more so they must be to me!"
<P>
Trent smiled very faintly, but he said nothing.  He was sitting
cross-legged with his back against one of the poles which supported
the open hut, with his eyes fixed upon the cloud of mist hanging
over a distant swamp.  A great yellow moon had stolen over the low
range of stony hills - the mist was curling away in little wreaths
of gold.  Trent was watching it, but if you had asked him he would
have told you that he was wondering when the alligators came out
to feed, and how near the village they ventured.  Looking at his
hard, square face and keen, black eyes no one would surely have
credited him with any less material thoughts.
<P>
"Furthermore," the man whom Trent had addressed as Monty continued,
"there arises the question of danger and physical suitability to
the situation.  Contrast our two cases, my dear young friend.  I am
twenty-five years older than you, I have a weak heart, a ridiculous
muscle, and the stamina of a rabbit.  My fighting days are over.  I
can shoot straight, but shooting would only serve us here until our
cartridges were gone - when the rush came a child could knock me
over.  You, on the contrary, have the constitution of an ox, the
muscles of a bull, and the wind of an ostrich.  You are, if you will
pardon my saying so, a magnificent specimen of the animal man.  In
the event of trouble you would not hesitate to admit that your
chances of escape would be at least double mine.  Trent lit a match
under pretence of lighting his pipe  - in reality because only a few
feet away he had seen a pair of bright eyes gleaming at them through
a low shrub.  A little native boy scuttled away - as black as night,
woolly-headed, and shiny; he had crept up unknown to look with
fearful eyes upon the wonderful white strangers.  Trent threw a lump
of earth at him and laughed as he dodged it.
<P>
"Well, go ahead, Monty," he said.  "Let's hear what you're driving
at.  What a gab you've got to be sure!"
<P>
Monty waved his hand - a magnificent and silencing gesture.
<P>
"I have alluded to these matters," he continued, "merely in order
to show you that the greater share of danger and discomfort in
this expedition falls to my lot.  Having reminded you of this,
Trent, I refer to the concluding sentence of your last speech.  The
words indicated, as I understood them, some doubt of our ability to
see this thing through."
<P>
He paused, peering over to where Trent was sitting with grim,
immovable face, listening with little show of interest.  He drew a
long, deep breath and moved over nearer to the doorway.  His manner
was suddenly changed.
<P>
"Scarlett Trent," he cried, "Scarlett Trent, listen to me!  You are
young and I am old!  To you this may be one adventure amongst many
 - it is my last.  I've craved for such a chance as this ever since
I set foot in this cursed land.  It's come late enough, too late
almost for me, but I'm going through with it while there's breath
in my body.  Swear to me now that you will not back out!  Do you
hear, Trent?  Swear!"
<P>
Trent looked curiously at his companion, vastly interested in this
sudden outburst, in the firmness of his tone and the tightening of
the weak mouth.  After all, then, the old chap had some grit in him.
To Trent, who had known him for years as a broken-down hanger-on of
the settlement at Buckomari, a drunkard, gambler, a creature to all
appearance hopelessly gone under, this look and this almost
passionate appeal were like a revelation.  He stretched out his
great hand and patted his companion on the back - a proceeding which
obviously caused him much discomfort.
<P>
"Bravo, old cockie!" he said.  "Didn't imagine you'd got the grit.
You know I'm not the chap to be let down easy.  We'll go through
with it, then, and take all chances!  It's my game right along.
Every copper I've got went to pay the bearers here and to buy the
kickshaws and rum for old What's-his-name, and I'm not anxious to
start again as a pauper.  We'll stay here till we get our
concessions, or till they bury us, then!  It's a go!"
<P>
Monty - no one at Buckomari had ever known of any other name for
him - stretched out a long hand, with delicate tapering fingers,
and let it rest for a moment gingerly in the thick, brown palm of
his companion.  Then he glanced stealthily over his shoulder and
his eyes gleamed.
<P>
"I think, if you will allow me, Trent, I will just moisten my lips
 - no more - with some of that excellent brandy."
<P>
Trent caught his arm and held it firmly.
<P>
"No, you don't," he said, shaking his head.  "That's the last
bottle, and we've got the journey back.  We'll keep that, in case
of fever."
<P>
A struggle went on in the face of the man whose hot breath fell
upon Trent's cheek.  It was the usual thing - the disappointment
of the baffled drunkard - a little more terrible in his case perhaps
because of the remnants of refinement still to be traced in his
well-shaped features.  His weak eyes for once were eloquent, but
with the eloquence of cupidity and unwholesome craving, his lean
cheeks twitched and his hands shook.
<P>
"Just a drop, Trent!" he pleaded.  "I'm not feeling well, indeed
I'm not!  The odours here are so foul.  A liqueur-glassful will do
me all the good in the world."
<P>
"You won't get it, Monty, so it's no use whining," Trent said
bluntly.  "I've given way to you too much already.  Buck up, man!
We're on the threshold of fortune and we need all our wits about us."
<P>
"Of fortune - fortune!"  Monty's head dropped upon his chest, his
nostrils dilated, he seemed to fall into a state of stupor.  Trent
watched him half curiously, half contemptuously.
<P>
"You're terribly keen on money-making for an old 'un," he remarked,
after a somewhat lengthy pause.  "What do you want to do with it?"
<P>
"To do with it!"  The old man raised his head.  "To do with it!"
The gleam of reawakened desire lit up his face.  He sat for a
moment thinking.  Then he laughed softly.
<P>
"I will tell you, Master Scarlett Trent," he said, "I will tell you
why I crave for wealth.  You are a young and an ignorant man.
Amongst other things you do not know what money will buy.  You have
your coarse pleasures I do not doubt, which seem sweet to you!
Beyond them - what?  A tasteless and barbaric display, a vulgar
generosity, an ignorant and purposeless prodigality.  Bah!  How
different it is with those who know!  There are many things, my
young friend, which I learned in my younger days, and amongst them
was the knowledge of how to spend money.  How to spend it, you
understand!  It is an art, believe me!  I mastered it, and, until
the end came, it was magnificent.  In London and Paris to-day to
have wealth and to know how to spend it is to be the equal of
princes!  The salons of the beautiful fly open before you, great
men will clamour for your friendship, all the sweetest triumphs
which love and sport can offer are yours.  You stalk amongst a
world of pygmies a veritable giant, the adored of women, the envied
of men!  You may be old - it matters not; ugly - you will be fooled
into reckoning yourself an Adonis.  Nobility is great, art is great,
genius is great, but the key to the pleasure storehouse of the world
is a key of gold - of gold!"
<P>
He broke off with a little gasp.  He held his throat and looked
imploringly towards the bottle.  Trent shook his head stonily.
There was something pitiful in the man's talk, in that odd mixture
of bitter cynicism and passionate earnestness, but there was also
something fascinating.  As regards the brandy, however, Trent was
adamant.
<P>
"Not a drop," he declared.  "What a fool you are to want it, Monty!
You're a wreck already.  You want to pull through, don't you?  Leave
the filthy stuff alone.  You'll not live a month to enjoy your coin
if we get it!"
<P>
"Live!" Monty straightened himself out.  A tremor went through all
his frame.
<P>
"Live!" he repeated, with fierce contempt; "you are making the
common mistake of the whole ignorant herd.  You are measuring life
by its length, when its depth alone is of any import.  I want no
more than a year or two at the most, and I promise you, Mr. Scarlett
Trent, my most estimable young companion, that, during that year, I
will live more than you in your whole lifetime.  I will drink deep
of pleasures which you know nothing of, I will be steeped in joys
which you will never reach more nearly than the man who watches a
change in the skies or a sunset across the ocean!  To you, with
boundless wealth, there will be depths of happiness which you will
never probe, joys which, if you have the wit to see them at all,
will be no more than a mirage to you."
<P>
Trent laughed outright, easily and with real mirth.  Yet in his
heart were sown already the seeds of a secret dread.  There was a
ring of passionate truth in Monty's words.  He believed what he was
saying.  Perhaps he was right.  The man's inborn hatred of a second
or inferior place in anything stung him.  Were there to be any
niches after all in the temple of happiness to which he could never
climb?  He looked back rapidly, looked down the avenue of a squalid
and unlovely life, saw himself the child of drink-sodden and brutal
parents, remembered the Board School with its unlovely surroundings,
his struggles at a dreary trade, his running away and the fierce
draughts of delight which the joy and freedom of the sea had brought
to him on the morning when he had crept on deck, a stowaway, to be
lashed with every rope-end and to do the dirty work of every one.
Then the slavery at a Belgian settlement, the job on a steamer
trading along the Congo, the life at Buckomari, and lastly this bold
enterprise in which the savings of years were invested.  It was a
life which called aloud for fortune some day or other to make a
little atonement.  The old man was dreaming.  Wealth would bring
him, uneducated though he was, happiness enough and to spare.
<P>
A footstep fell softly upon the turf outside.  Trent sprang at once
into an attitude of rigid attention.  His revolver, which for four
days had been at full cock by his side, stole out and covered the
approaching shadow stealing gradually nearer and nearer.  The old
man saw nothing, for he slept, worn out with excitement and
exhaustion.
