<p>It looked as if Fred Ashman had gained a double victory over
the giant Ziffak, and his second triumph was infinitely greater
than his first.</p>

<p>His heart thrilled at the thought that this formidable antagonist
had been so suddenly transformed into a friend; and yet he could
not entirely free himself from a certain misgiving, as the two
walked side by side along the Xingu.  Recalling the dexterity
of the native&mdash;all the more wonderful because of his bulk&mdash;he
reflected, that it was the easiest thing in the world for him
to turn like a flash and pierce him with his poisoned javelin
before the slightest defence could be made.</p>

<p>It was this thought which led him stealthily to place his hand
on the butt of the revolver at his hip, prepared to whip it out
and fire as quickly as he knew how.  At the same time he edged
away from him, so as to maintain considerable space between their
bodies.</p>

<p>Ziffak suddenly changed his javelin from his right to his left
hand, the movement sending a shock of fear through the American,
who the next moment blushed from shame, for it was manifest that
the shrewd savage suspected the timidity of his new friend, and
shifted the frightful weapon to the side furthest from him to
relieve any misgiving on his part.</p>

<p>The conversation continued as they walked, the native showing
a surprising willingness to answer all questions.</p>

<p>Ashman gathered from what was told him that the Murhapas were
a tribe numbering fully a thousand men, women and children; that
they occupied a village or town on the right bank of the Xingu
about twenty miles above the rapids, where the incidents already
recorded occurred, and that they were far superior in intelligence,
physical development and prowess to any other tribes in the Matto
Grosso.</p>

<p>It was about five years before that the two white men, Waggaman
and Burkhardt, suddenly made their appearance at the towns.  The
fact that they did not come up the Xingu, but from the forest
to the south, strengthened Ashman's suspicion that they were criminals
who had managed to escape from the Brazilian diamond mines, though
it was a mystery how they had secured the two rifles which they
brought with them.  They had no revolvers, and their guns were
not of the repeating pattern.  When their ammunition gave out,
one of them made a journey of several days' duration into the
wilderness, invariably bringing back a supply which lasted a long
time.</p>

<p>Such weapons were entirely unknown to the Murhapas, who had never
heard of anything of the kind.  The exploits of the owners caused
the natives to look upon them with awe.  They were soon established
on the best of terms with their new associates, who allowed them
to do as they chose in everything.</p>

<p>It is not to be supposed that Ashman gathered all the information
given in this chapter, during his brief walk with Ziffak.  Indeed,
that which has already been stated was obtained only in part during
the memorable interview; but it may be as well to add other facts
which afterwards came to the knowledge of him and the explorers,
since it is necessary to know them in order to understand the
strange series of incidents and adventures in which they became
speedily involved.</p>

<p>The Murhapa tribe was ruled by King Haffgo, whose complexion
was almost as fair as that of a European.  He had fifty wives,
but only one child, whose mother was dead.  This child was a daughter,
Ariel, of surpassing beauty and loveliness, the pride of her grim
father and adored by all his subjects.  From Waggaman and Burkhardt
she had acquired a knowledge of the English tongue, which Ziffak
declared was superior to his own. Both of these men had sought
in turn to win her as his wife, and the king was not unwilling,
because of the awe in which he held them; but Ariel would not
agree to mate herself with either, though she once intimated that
when she became older she might listen favorably to the suit of
Waggaman, whose appearance and manner were less repulsive than
those of his comrade.</p>

<p>The first duty the guests took upon themselves was to impress
King Haffgo and his subjects that all white men except themselves
were their deadliest enemies, and, if any of them were allowed
to visit the village, they would assuredly bring others who would
cause the utter destruction of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Three years before, a party of six white explorers ascended the
Xingu, and suddenly presented themselves to the Murhapas, without
previous announcement or knowledge.  Despite their professions
of friendship, and a most valiant defence, they were set upon
and slain the same hour they appeared among the fierce people.</p>

<p>Ariel, the daughter of the king, was but a child, at that time,
just entering her teens.  She did not know of the cruel massacre
until it was over, when she surprised all by expressing her sorrow
and declaring that a great wrong had been done the strangers. 
From that time forward, those who studied her closely saw that
she had formed a strong distrust, if not dislike, of Waggaman
and Burkhardt, though, seeing the high favor in which they were
held in court, she sought to veil her true feelings.</p>

<p>Ziffak was a younger brother of the king, and bore the title
of head-chieftain.  He was next in authority and power, and, because
of his immense size and prowess, led all expeditions against their
enemies, none of whom was held in fear.  Occasionally, he headed
a hundred warriors, who made excursions through the neighboring
wilderness and in pure wantoness spread destruction and death
on every hand.</p>

<p>The Aryks, after receiving several such terrible visits, sued
for terms and willingly agreed to consider themselves slaves of
the Murhapas. Their location was favorable to detect the advance
of any of the dreaded white men up the Xingu, and they agreed
in consideration of being left alone, to check any such approach,
a fact which will explain the fierceness and determination with
which they contested the ascent of the river by our friends.</p>

<p>If they allowed the whites to pass above the rapids, they knew
that the mighty Ziffak would sweep down upon them and visit frightful
punishment upon their heads.</p>

<p>Instead of bringing a body of his own warriors, Ziffak, as has
been intimated in another place, came alone down one side of the
Xingu, with Waggaman and Burkhardt on the other, the calculation
being to rouse enough Aryks to destroy the invaders, as they were
regarded.  Enough has been told to show how thoroughly the head-chieftain
acquitted himself of this duty.</p>

<p>Several of the powerful reasons for the jealousy of Waggaman
and Burkhardt of their race, was apparent in the fact that there
was an astonishing abundance of diamonds and gold among the Murhapas.
Although none was seen on Ziffak, it was only because he was on
the war-path.  He had enough at home to furnish a prince's ransom,
while the possessions of the beautiful princess Ariel were worth
a kingdom.</p>

<p>These were obtained from some place among the mountains to the
westward of the town.  In the same mysterious region was a peak,
whose interior was a mass of fire that had burned from a date
too remote to be known even in the legends of the wild people. 
There was a lake also, whose waters were so clear that a boat
floating over them seemed suspended in mid air.</p>

<p>This wonderful section was claimed by King Haffgo, who would
permit none but his subjects and the two white men to visit it. 
A party of Aryks; presuming upon the friendly relations just established
with their masters, ventured to make their way to the enchanted
place without permission or knowledge of the Murhapas.</p>

<p>Before they could get away, they were discovered by some of the
lookouts, and every one slain with dreadful torture.  The lesson
was not lost upon their surviving friends, who never again ventured
to repeat the experiment.</p>

<p>The Murhapas were the first to use the spears with the deadly
points. They not only taught the Aryks how to prepare the poison
from the venom of several species of serpents and noxious vegetables,
but imparted to them the remedy,&mdash;a decoction of such marvellous
power, that a single swallow would instantly neutralize the effect
of any wound received from the dreaded missiles.</p>

<p>Among the tribes named, there was no knowledge of the use of
iron though the ore is abundant in that region.  The only objects
composed of the metal were the firearms of the white men, and
the natives could not comprehend how they were fashioned from
the substance which underwent such a change from its native state.</p>

<p>Every implement used by this people is made from stone, which
however seems almost the equal of iron and steel.  Spear points,
axes and cutting tools are shaped with remarkably keen edges,
with which trees are readily felled, and cut into any form desired.</p>

<p>Shells are used in the formation of knives, while the teeth of
certain fish, taken from the Xingu, enables them to construct
still more delicate implements for cutting and carving.</p>

<p>Indian corn, cotton and tobacco are raised from a soil whose
fertility cannot be surpassed, though strangely enough the tribes
have no knowledge of the banana, sugar cane and rice, which belong
so essentially to the torrid zones.  Dogs and fowls are entirely
unknown, and there is no conception of a God, though all have
a firm belief that they will live again after death.  A myth has
existed among them from time immemorial of the creation of the
world, which, according to their views, consists of the regions
around the headwaters of the Xingu and Tapajos.</p>

<p>Ziffak was a favorite of the beauteous Ariel, and it is not improbable
that, knowing as he did, her lamentation over the cruel death
of the white men, who appeared at her home three years before,
he was more willing than would otherwise have been the case to
stay his hand, after doing such yeoman service against the new-comers.</p>

<p>Where these tribes came from is a question yet unsolved by anthropologists,
though the theory has many supporters that most of the isolated
peoples are allied to the original stock of the once mighty Caribs,
who journeyed from the south to the sea.</p>

<p>Conscious of their own might, and knowing the prodigious mineral
wealth at their command, the Murhapas are naturally jealous of
their neighbors, and fight fiercely to resist anything that bears
a resemblance to an encroachment upon their rights.</p>

<p>It will be understood that Waggaman and Burkhardt met with little
difficulty in rousing their enmity particularly against the Caucasian
race, since the members of that, of all others, were the ones
most to be dreaded.</p>

<p>The foregoing, much of which is in the way of anticipation, we
have deemed best to incorporate in this place.</p>
