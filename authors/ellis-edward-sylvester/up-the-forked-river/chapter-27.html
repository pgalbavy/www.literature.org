<p>General Yozarro's red-hot temper burst into uncontrollable flame,
and he committed a blunder which allowed the game to flit when
it was within his grasp. To the consternation of every one, he
gave an instant order to fire upon the sailboat. The officers
protested, but the Dictator was irrestrainable. He hurried down
from the upper deck and ordered two sailors to train the gun at
the front on the little craft. The better to accomplish this,
he shouted to the Captain to slacken speed, so as not to distract
the aim of the gunners.</p>

<p>For a minute or two Major Starland could not believe what he
heard, but the movements on board the tug left no doubt of the
frightful purpose of the raging creature on the larger boat. Holding
the tiller steady and keeping the head of the small craft straight
toward shore, the Major said to his sister:</p>

<p>"If they hit us, it will be by accident; you would better stoop
your head."</p>

<p>She instantly obeyed and he leaned forward himself, so as to
offer as small a target as possible. Captain Guzman and Martella
sat motionless, watching the tug rushing down upon them and ready
to leap ashore the instant they came within reach.</p>

<p>All a-tremble with the intensity of his rage, General Yozarro
stood to the rear and beside the six-pounder whose muzzle was
pointed toward the little boat. He measured with his eye when
the right instant came, and snapped the lanyard. A spout of smoke
and flame shot from the muzzle and the boom rolled across the
river and was echoed from the further shore, as the solid missile
sped on its errand.</p>

<p>Barely more than a hundred yards separated the two craft, when
the explosion came. General Yozarro had aimed to sink the other
boat, reckless of the lives he sacrificed. It may have been and
it probably was because he took the best aim he could, that the
ball missed the catboat by twenty feet and crashed harmlessly
into the jungle beyond.</p>

<p>The delay caused by the slackening speed of the tug gave our
friends the chance they were prompt to use. Not the slightest
change had been made in the course of the craft, whose prow the
next moment impinged sharply against the shore, and Captain Guzman
and Martella sprang out. Instead of running away, however, they
seized the gunwale and tugged to draw the bow up the bank.</p>

<p>Grasping the hand of his sister, Major Starland dashed after
them. They had the length of the boat to travel, but quickly did
it and joined their friends on land.</p>

<p>"Why do you dally?" he called angrily; "if you wait another minute,
you will be taken! Off with you!"</p>

<p>"Fret not about us," was the gruff response of Martella; "attend
to the Señorita, and we'll look after ourselves."</p>

<p>The great fear in the minds of all was that General Yozarro would
fire the rear gun. It would take a few minutes to bring it to
bear, and, although neither he nor his men knew how to aim to
hit, an accident might result in harm. The passing seconds were
of measureless value.</p>

<p>But, before the tug could veer, a gleam of returning reason came
to the ruffian. He had done an outrageous thing, but providentially
without evil consequences. It would not do for him to repeat the
crime. He might claim, as doubtless he meant to claim, that the
first shot was fired as a warning to bring the smaller craft to,
though in all his life he never tried harder to destroy and kill.</p>

<p>He shouted to the Captain to head for land, and the officer did
so with a skill born of experience. In rounding to, he narrowly
missed smashing the smaller boat.</p>

<p>Now, through one of those coincidences which occur oftener in
this life than is supposed, the catboat had touched shore at the
opening of a clearly-marked trail, leading into the interior.
It was pure chance or providence, for even Martella knew nothing
of the path, which was one of many that wound down to the river.
It was his intention to plunge into the jungle with no other thought
than that of immediately finding a hiding place for his friends
and himself, when he happened upon the path. Yielding to impulse,
he called out the fact and told the others to follow, as he hurried
up the slight incline.</p>

<p>But a few paces told him this would never do, for their pursuers
would be right behind them. He abruptly stopped.</p>

<p>"We must turn off," he said, "and let them pass us."</p>

<p>"They may not do so," suggested Starland.</p>

<p>"They will not know where to look for us."</p>

<p>He began picking a course among the matted vegetation, unmindful
of the dangers that might threaten. Miss Starland went next, then
her brother, and then Captain Guzman. They penetrated no more
than twenty feet, when, at a whispered word from Martella, all
halted, and, as they had done earlier in the evening, watched
for their pursuers to pass. In this instance, however, the path
was so screened that nothing could be seen, and our friends depended
wholly upon their sense of hearing.</p>

<p>Less than ten minutes elapsed between the landing of the two
parties. General Yozarro was the first to set foot on shore, and,
noting the trail, he started up it on a lope, with the others
hurrying after him. Their footsteps were heard by the crouching
fugitives, who were unable to see a single shadowy form.</p>

<p>"How long will they keep that up?" asked Major Starland when
the last had gone by.</p>

<p>"Not long," answered Captain Guzman; "they know the Señorita
cannot travel fast, and that, if we took the trail, they must
quickly come up with us."</p>

<p>"Failing to overtake us, what will they do next?"</p>

<p>But for the darkness, the Captain would have been seen to shrug
his shoulders. It was the deserter who spoke:</p>

<p>"They can do nothing but wait."</p>

<p>"Martella, I am now ready to join you in capturing the tugboat."</p>

<p>"<em>Esta buena! Esta buena!</em>" whispered the delighted fellow;
"it makes no difference, if there is more risk, for we do not
know how many they have left behind."</p>

<p>"Hang the risk! Lead on!"</p>

<p>In his eagerness, Martella took no pains to hide the noise of
tearing through the jungle, and the next moment they emerged into
the trail again. The Major had already instructed his sister to
stay at the rear, with the Captain directly in front of her. There
was likely to be sharp fighting, and she must keep out of it.</p>

<p>"When we rush aboard, remain on the bank till I call to you."</p>

<p>She promised to do as told, and the three men, their heads bent
forward, went down the trail at the double quick, she readily
keeping pace with them. The brief distance was quickly passed,
and the three drew together on the edge of the river, just within
the shadow.</p>

<p>"The Captain is in the pilot house," whispered Martella, indicating
the figure of a man who had seated himself; "but I don't think
there are any others beside the engineer and firemen."</p>

<p>"Leave the Captain to me," said the American, who sprang into
the moonlight and led the way up the gang plank with the two at
his heels. In his left hand was his rifle and in his right his
revolver.</p>
