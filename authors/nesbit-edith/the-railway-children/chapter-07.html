<p>I hope you don't mind my telling you a good deal about Roberta.  The
fact is I am growing very fond of her.  The more I observe her the
more I love her.  And I notice all sorts of things about her that I
like.</p>

<p>For instance, she was quite oddly anxious to make other people
happy.  And she could keep a secret, a tolerably rare
accomplishment.  Also she had the power of silent sympathy.  That
sounds rather dull, I know, but it's not so dull as it sounds.  It
just means that a person is able to know that you are unhappy, and
to love you extra on that account, without bothering you by telling
you all the time how sorry she is for you.  That was what Bobbie was
like.  She knew that Mother was unhappy - and that Mother had not
told her the reason.  So she just loved Mother more and never said a
single word that could let Mother know how earnestly her little girl
wondered what Mother was unhappy about.  This needs practice.  It is
not so easy as you might think.</p>

<p>Whatever happened - and all sorts of nice, pleasant ordinary things
happened - such as picnics, games, and buns for tea, Bobbie always
had these thoughts at the back of her mind.  &quot;Mother's unhappy.
Why?  I don't know.  She doesn't want me to know.  I won't try to
find out.  But she IS unhappy.  Why?  I don't know.  She doesn't - &quot;
and so on, repeating and repeating like a tune that you don't know
the stopping part of.</p>

<p>The Russian gentleman still took up a good deal of everybody's
thoughts.  All the editors and secretaries of Societies and Members
of Parliament had answered Mother's letters as politely as they knew
how; but none of them could tell where the wife and children of Mr.
Szezcpansky would be likely to be.  (Did I tell you that the
Russian's very Russian name was that?)</p>

<p>Bobbie had another quality which you will hear differently described
by different people.  Some of them call it interfering in other
people's business - and some call it &quot;helping lame dogs over stiles,&quot;
and some call it &quot;loving-kindness.&quot;  It just means trying to help
people.</p>

<p>She racked her brains to think of some way of helping the Russian
gentleman to find his wife and children.  He had learned a few words
of English now.  He could say &quot;Good morning,&quot; and &quot;Good night,&quot; and
&quot;Please,&quot; and &quot;Thank you,&quot; and &quot;Pretty,&quot; when the children brought
him flowers, and &quot;Ver' good,&quot; when they asked him how he had slept.</p>

<p>The way he smiled when he &quot;said his English,&quot; was, Bobbie felt,
&quot;just too sweet for anything.&quot;  She used to think of his face
because she fancied it would help her to some way of helping him.
But it did not.  Yet his being there cheered her because she saw
that it made Mother happier.</p>

<p>&quot;She likes to have someone to be good to, even beside us,&quot; said
Bobbie.  &quot;And I know she hated to let him have Father's clothes.
But I suppose it 'hurt nice,' or she wouldn't have.&quot;</p>

<p>For many and many a night after the day when she and Peter and
Phyllis had saved the train from wreck by waving their little red
flannel flags, Bobbie used to wake screaming and shivering, seeing
again that horrible mound, and the poor, dear trustful engine
rushing on towards it - just thinking that it was doing its swift
duty, and that everything was clear and safe.  And then a warm
thrill of pleasure used to run through her at the remembrance of how
she and Peter and Phyllis and the red flannel petticoats had really
saved everybody.</p>

<p>One morning a letter came.  It was addressed to Peter and Bobbie and
Phyllis.  They opened it with enthusiastic curiosity, for they did
not often get letters.</p>

<p>The letter said: - </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Sir, and Ladies, - It is proposed to make a small presentation
to you, in commemoration of your prompt and courageous action in
warning the train on the  - - inst., and thus averting what must,
humanly speaking, have been a terrible accident.  The presentation
will take place at the  - - Station at three o'clock on the 30th
inst., if this time and place will be convenient to you.</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;Yours faithfully,<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>                    &quot;Jabez Inglewood.
&quot;Secretary, Great Northern and Southern Railway Co.&quot;</p>

<p>There never had been a prouder moment in the lives of the three
children.  They rushed to Mother with the letter, and she also felt
proud and said so, and this made the children happier than ever.</p>

<p>&quot;But if the presentation is money, you must say, 'Thank you, but
we'd rather not take it,'&quot; said Mother.  &quot;I'll wash your Indian
muslins at once,&quot; she added.  &quot;You must look tidy on an occasion
like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Phil and I can wash them,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;if you'll iron them,
Mother.&quot;</p>

<p>Washing is rather fun.  I wonder whether you've ever done it?  This
particular washing took place in the back kitchen, which had a stone
floor and a very big stone sink under its window.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's put the bath on the sink,&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;then we can pretend
we're out-of-doors washerwomen like Mother saw in France.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But they were washing in the cold river,&quot; said Peter, his hands in
his pockets, &quot;not in hot water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is a HOT river, then,&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;lend a hand with the
bath, there's a dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should like to see a deer lending a hand,&quot; said Peter, but he
lent his.</p>

<p>&quot;Now to rub and scrub and scrub and rub,&quot; said Phyllis, hopping
joyously about as Bobbie carefully carried the heavy kettle from the
kitchen fire.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no!&quot; said Bobbie, greatly shocked; &quot;you don't rub muslin.  You
put the boiled soap in the hot water and make it all frothy-lathery-
-and then you shake the muslin and squeeze it, ever so gently, and
all the dirt comes out.  It's only clumsy things like tablecloths
and sheets that have to be rubbed.&quot;</p>

<p>The lilac and the Gloire de Dijon roses outside the window swayed in
the soft breeze.</p>

<p>&quot;It's a nice drying day - that's one thing,&quot; said Bobbie, feeling
very grown up.  &quot;Oh, I do wonder what wonderful feelings we shall
have when we WEAR the Indian muslin dresses!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, so do I,&quot; said Phyllis, shaking and squeezing the muslin in
quite a professional manner.</p>

<p>&quot;NOW we squeeze out the soapy water.  NO - we mustn't twist them - and
then rinse them.  I'll hold them while you and Peter empty the bath
and get clean water.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A presentation!  That means presents,&quot; said Peter, as his sisters,
having duly washed the pegs and wiped the line, hung up the dresses
to dry.  &quot;Whatever will it be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It might be anything,&quot; said Phyllis; &quot;what I've always wanted is a
Baby elephant - but I suppose they wouldn't know that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Suppose it was gold models of steam-engines?&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;Or a big model of the scene of the prevented accident,&quot; suggested
Peter, &quot;with a little model train, and dolls dressed like us and the
engine-driver and fireman and passengers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you LIKE,&quot; said Bobbie, doubtfully, drying her hands on the
rough towel that hung on a roller at the back of the scullery door,
&quot;do you LIKE us being rewarded for saving a train?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; said Peter, downrightly; &quot;and don't you try to come it
over us that you don't like it, too.  Because I know you do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bobbie, doubtfully, &quot;I know I do.  But oughtn't we to be
satisfied with just having done it, and not ask for anything more?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who did ask for anything more, silly?&quot; said her brother; &quot;Victoria
Cross soldiers don't ASK for it; but they're glad enough to get it
all the same.  Perhaps it'll be medals.  Then, when I'm very old
indeed, I shall show them to my grandchildren and say, 'We only did
our duty,' and they'll be awfully proud of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have to be married,&quot; warned Phyllis, &quot;or you don't have any
grandchildren.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose I shall HAVE to be married some day,&quot; said Peter, &quot;but it
will be an awful bother having her round all the time. I'd like to
marry a lady who had trances, and only woke up once or twice a
year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just to say you were the light of her life and then go to sleep
again.  Yes.  That wouldn't be bad,&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;When <span style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> get married,&quot; said Phyllis, &quot;I shall want him to want me
to be awake all the time, so that I can hear him say how nice I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it would be nice,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;to marry someone very
poor, and then you'd do all the work and he'd love you most
frightfully, and see the blue wood smoke curling up among the trees
from the domestic hearth as he came home from work every night.  I
say - we've got to answer that letter and say that the time and place
WILL be convenient to us.  There's the soap, Peter.  WE'RE both as
clean as clean.  That pink box of writing paper you had on your
birthday, Phil.&quot;</p>

<p>It took some time to arrange what should be said.  Mother had gone
back to her writing, and several sheets of pink paper with scalloped
gilt edges and green four-leaved shamrocks in the corner were
spoiled before the three had decided what to say.  Then each made a
copy and signed it with its own name.</p>

<p>The threefold letter ran: - </p>

<p>&quot;Dear Mr. Jabez Inglewood, - Thank you very much.  We did not want to
be rewarded but only to save the train, but we are glad you think so
and thank you very much.  The time and place you say will be quite
convenient to us.  Thank you very much.</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;Your affecate little friend,&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Then came the name, and after it: - </p>

<p>&quot;P.S. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Washing is much easier than ironing,&quot; said Bobbie, taking the clean
dry dresses off the line.  &quot;I do love to see things come clean.  Oh-
-I don't know how we shall wait till it's time to know what
presentation they're going to present!&quot;</p>

<p>When at last - it seemed a very long time after - it was THE day, the
three children went down to the station at the proper time.  And
everything that happened was so odd that it seemed like a dream.
The Station Master came out to meet them - in his best clothes, as
Peter noticed at once - and led them into the waiting room where once
they had played the advertisement game.  It looked quite different
now.  A carpet had been put down - and there were pots of roses on
the mantelpiece and on the window ledges - green branches stuck up,
like holly and laurel are at Christmas, over the framed
advertisement of Cook's Tours and the Beauties of Devon and the
Paris Lyons Railway.  There were quite a number of people there
besides the Porter - two or three ladies in smart dresses, and quite
a crowd of gentlemen in high hats and frock coats - besides everybody
who belonged to the station.  They recognized several people who had
been in the train on the red-flannel-petticoat day.  Best of all
their own old gentleman was there, and his coat and hat and collar
seemed more than ever different from anyone else's.  He shook hands
with them and then everybody sat down on chairs, and a gentleman in
spectacles - they found out afterwards that he was the District
Superintendent - began quite a long speech - very clever indeed.  I am
not going to write the speech down.  First, because you would think
it dull; and secondly, because it made all the children blush so,
and get so hot about the ears that I am quite anxious to get away
from this part of the subject; and thirdly, because the gentleman
took so many words to say what he had to say that I really haven't
time to write them down.  He said all sorts of nice things about the
children's bravery and presence of mind, and when he had done he sat
down, and everyone who was there clapped and said, &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;</p>

<p>And then the old gentleman got up and said things, too.  It was very
like a prize-giving.  And then he called the children one by one, by
their names, and gave each of them a beautiful gold watch and chain.
And inside the watches were engraved after the name of the watch's
new owner: - </p>

<p>&quot;From the Directors of the Northern and Southern Railway in grateful
recognition of the courageous and prompt action which averted an
accident on  - - 1905.&quot;</p>

<p>The watches were the most beautiful you can possibly imagine, and
each one had a blue leather case to live in when it was at home.</p>

<p>&quot;You must make a speech now and thank everyone for their kindness,&quot;
whispered the Station Master in Peter's ear and pushed him forward.
&quot;Begin 'Ladies and Gentlemen,'&quot; he added.</p>

<p>Each of the children had already said &quot;Thank you,&quot; quite properly.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, dear,&quot; said Peter, but he did not resist the push.</p>

<p>&quot;Ladies and Gentlemen,&quot; he said in a rather husky voice.  Then there
was a pause, and he heard his heart beating in his throat.  &quot;Ladies
and Gentlemen,&quot; he went on with a rush, &quot;it's most awfully good of
you, and we shall treasure the watches all our lives - but really we
don't deserve it because what we did wasn't anything, really.  At
least, I mean it was awfully exciting, and what I mean to say - thank
you all very, very much.&quot;</p>

<p>The people clapped Peter more than they had done the District
Superintendent, and then everybody shook hands with them, and as
soon as politeness would let them, they got away, and tore up the
hill to Three Chimneys with their watches in their hands.</p>

<p>It was a wonderful day - the kind of day that very seldom happens to
anybody and to most of us not at all.</p>

<p>&quot;I did want to talk to the old gentleman about something else,&quot; said
Bobbie, &quot;but it was so public - like being in church.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you want to say?&quot; asked Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell you when I've thought about it more,&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>So when she had thought a little more she wrote a letter.</p>

<p>&quot;My dearest old gentleman,&quot; it said; &quot;I want most awfully to ask you
something.  If you could get out of the train and go by the next, it
would do.  I do not want you to give me anything.  Mother says we
ought not to.  And besides, we do not want any THINGS.  Only to talk
to you about a Prisoner and Captive.  Your loving little friend,</p>

<blockquote><div>&quot;Bobbie.&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>She got the Station Master to give the letter to the old gentleman,
and next day she asked Peter and Phyllis to come down to the station
with her at the time when the train that brought the old gentleman
from town would be passing through.</p>

<p>She explained her idea to them - and they approved thoroughly.</p>

<p>They had all washed their hands and faces, and brushed their hair,
and were looking as tidy as they knew how.  But Phyllis, always
unlucky, had upset a jug of lemonade down the front of her dress.
There was no time to change - and the wind happening to blow from the
coal yard, her frock was soon powdered with grey, which stuck to the
sticky lemonade stains and made her look, as Peter said, &quot;like any
little gutter child.&quot;</p>

<p>It was decided that she should keep behind the others as much as
possible.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps the old gentleman won't notice,&quot; said Bobbie.  &quot;The aged
are often weak in the eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>There was no sign of weakness, however, in the eyes, or in any other
part of the old gentleman, as he stepped from the train and looked
up and down the platform.</p>

<p>The three children, now that it came to the point, suddenly felt
that rush of deep shyness which makes your ears red and hot, your
hands warm and wet, and the tip of your nose pink and shiny.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Phyllis, &quot;my heart's thumping like a steam-engine - right
under my sash, too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense,&quot; said Peter, &quot;people's hearts aren't under their sashes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care - mine is,&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're going to talk like a poetry-book,&quot; said Peter, &quot;my
heart's in my mouth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My heart's in my boots - if you come to that,&quot; said Roberta; &quot;but do
come on - he'll think we're idiots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He won't be far wrong,&quot; said Peter, gloomily.  And they went
forward to meet the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo,&quot; he said, shaking hands with them all in turn.  &quot;This is a
very great pleasure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It WAS good of you to get out,&quot; Bobbie said, perspiring and polite.</p>

<p>He took her arm and drew her into the waiting room where she and the
others had played the advertisement game the day they found the
Russian.  Phyllis and Peter followed.  &quot;Well?&quot; said the old
gentleman, giving Bobbie's arm a kind little shake before he let it
go.  &quot;Well?  What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, please!&quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes?&quot; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;What I mean to say - &quot; said Bobbie.</p>

<p>&quot;Well?&quot; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;It's all very nice and kind,&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;But?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish I might say something,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Say it,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; said Bobbie - and out came the story of the Russian who
had written the beautiful book about poor people, and had been sent
to prison and to Siberia for just that.</p>

<p>&quot;And what we want more than anything in the world is to find his
wife and children for him,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;but we don't know how.
But you must be most horribly clever, or you wouldn't be a Direction
of the Railway.  And if YOU knew how - and would?  We'd rather have
that than anything else in the world.  We'd go without the watches,
even, if you could sell them and find his wife with the money.&quot;</p>

<p>And the others said so, too, though not with so much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&quot;Hum,&quot; said the old gentleman, pulling down the white waistcoat that
had the big gilt buttons on it, &quot;what did you say the name was - 
Fryingpansky?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no,&quot; said Bobbie earnestly.  &quot;I'll write it down for you.  It
doesn't really look at all like that except when you say it.  Have
you a bit of pencil and the back of an envelope?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>The old gentleman got out a gold pencil-case and a beautiful, sweet-
smelling, green Russian leather note-book and opened it at a new
page.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said, &quot;write here.&quot;</p>

<p>She wrote down &quot;Szezcpansky,&quot; and said: - </p>

<p>&quot;That's how you write it.  You CALL it Shepansky.&quot;</p>

<p>The old gentleman took out a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles and
fitted them on his nose.  When he had read the name, he looked quite
different.</p>

<p>&quot;THAT man?  Bless my soul!&quot; he said.  &quot;Why, I've read his book!
It's translated into every European language.  A fine book - a noble
book.  And so your mother took him in - like the good Samaritan.
Well, well.  I'll tell you what, youngsters - your mother must be a
very good woman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course she is,&quot; said Phyllis, in astonishment.</p>

<p>&quot;And you're a very good man,&quot; said Bobbie, very shy, but firmly
resolved to be polite.</p>

<p>&quot;You flatter me,&quot; said the old gentleman, taking off his hat with a
flourish.  &quot;And now am I to tell you what I think of you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, please don't,&quot; said Bobbie, hastily.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot; asked the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't exactly know,&quot; said Bobbie.  &quot;Only - if it's horrid, I don't
want you to; and if it's nice, I'd rather you didn't.&quot;</p>

<p>The old gentleman laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then,&quot; he said, &quot;I'll only just say that I'm very glad you
came to me about this - very glad, indeed.  And I shouldn't be
surprised if I found out something very soon.  I know a great many
Russians in London, and every Russian knows HIS name.  Now tell me
all about yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned to the others, but there was only one other, and that was
Peter.  Phyllis had disappeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me all about yourself,&quot; said the old gentleman again.  And,
quite naturally, Peter was stricken dumb.</p>

<p>&quot;All right, we'll have an examination,&quot; said the old gentleman; &quot;you
two sit on the table, and I'll sit on the bench and ask questions.&quot;</p>

<p>He did, and out came their names and ages - their Father's name and
business - how long they had lived at Three Chimneys and a great deal
more.</p>

<p>The questions were beginning to turn on a herring and a half for
three halfpence, and a pound of lead and a pound of feathers, when
the door of the waiting room was kicked open by a boot; as the boot
entered everyone could see that its lace was coming undone - and in
came Phyllis, very slowly and carefully.</p>

<p>In one hand she carried a large tin can, and in the other a thick
slice of bread and butter.</p>

<p>&quot;Afternoon tea,&quot; she announced proudly, and held the can and the
bread and butter out to the old gentleman, who took them and said: - </p>

<p>&quot;Bless my soul!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>&quot;It's very thoughtful of you,&quot; said the old gentleman, &quot;very.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you might have got a cup,&quot; said Bobbie, &quot;and a plate.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perks always drinks out of the can,&quot; said Phyllis, flushing red.
&quot;I think it was very nice of him to give it me at all - let alone
cups and plates,&quot; she added.</p>

<p>&quot;So do I,&quot; said the old gentleman, and he drank some of the tea and
tasted the bread and butter.</p>

<p>And then it was time for the next train, and he got into it with
many good-byes and kind last words.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; said Peter, when they were left on the platform, and the
tail-lights of the train disappeared round the corner, &quot;it's my
belief that we've lighted a candle to-day - like Latimer, you know,
when he was being burned - and there'll be fireworks for our Russian
before long.&quot;</p>

<p>And so there were.</p>

<p>It wasn't ten days after the interview in the waiting room that the
three children were sitting on the top of the biggest rock in the
field below their house watching the 5.15 steam away from the
station along the bottom of the valley.  They saw, too, the few
people who had got out at the station straggling up the road towards
the village - and they saw one person leave the road and open the
gate that led across the fields to Three Chimneys and to nowhere
else.</p>

<p>&quot;Who on earth!&quot; said Peter, scrambling down.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go and see,&quot; said Phyllis.</p>

<p>So they did.  And when they got near enough to see who the person
was, they saw it was their old gentleman himself, his brass buttons
winking in the afternoon sunshine, and his white waistcoat looking
whiter than ever against the green of the field.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo!&quot; shouted the children, waving their hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Hullo!&quot; shouted the old gentleman, waving his hat.</p>

<p>Then the three started to run - and when they got to him they hardly
had breath left to say: - </p>

<p>&quot;How do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good news,&quot; said he.  &quot;I've found your Russian friend's wife and
child - and I couldn't resist the temptation of giving myself the
pleasure of telling him.&quot;</p>

<p>But as he looked at Bobbie's face he felt that he COULD resist that
temptation.</p>

<p>&quot;Here,&quot; he said to her, &quot;you run on and tell him.  The other two
will show me the way.&quot;</p>

<p>Bobbie ran.  But when she had breathlessly panted out the news to
the Russian and Mother sitting in the quiet garden - when Mother's
face had lighted up so beautifully, and she had said half a dozen
quick French words to the Exile - Bobbie wished that she had NOT
carried the news.  For the Russian sprang up with a cry that made
Bobbie's heart leap and then tremble - a cry of love and longing such
as she had never heard.  Then he took Mother's hand and kissed it
gently and reverently - and then he sank down in his chair and
covered his face with his hands and sobbed.  Bobbie crept away.  She
did not want to see the others just then.</p>

<p>But she was as gay as anybody when the endless French talking was
over, when Peter had torn down to the village for buns and cakes,
and the girls had got tea ready and taken it out into the garden.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was most merry and delightful.  He seemed to be
able to talk in French and English almost at the same moment, and
Mother did nearly as well.  It was a delightful time.  Mother seemed
as if she could not make enough fuss about the old gentleman, and
she said yes at once when he asked if he might present some
&quot;goodies&quot; to his little friends.</p>

<p>The word was new to the children - but they guessed that it meant
sweets, for the three large pink and green boxes, tied with green
ribbon, which he took out of his bag, held unheard-of layers of
beautiful chocolates.</p>

<p>The Russian's few belongings were packed, and they all saw him off
at the station.</p>

<p>Then Mother turned to the old gentleman and said: - </p>

<p>&quot;I don't know how to thank you for EVERYTHING.  It has been a real
pleasure to me to see you.  But we live very quietly.  I am so sorry
that I can't ask you to come and see us again.&quot;</p>

<p>The children thought this very hard.  When they HAD made a friend - 
and such a friend - they would dearly have liked him to come and see
them again.</p>

<p>What the old gentleman thought they couldn't tell.  He only said: - </p>

<p>&quot;I consider myself very fortunate, Madam, to have been received once
at your house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Mother, &quot;I know I must seem surly and ungrateful - but - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You could never seem anything but a most charming and gracious
lady,&quot; said the old gentleman, with another of his bows.</p>

<p>And as they turned to go up the hill, Bobbie saw her Mother's face.</p>

<p>&quot;How tired you look, Mammy,&quot; she said; &quot;lean on me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's my place to give Mother my arm,&quot; said Peter.  &quot;I'm the head
man of the family when Father's away.&quot;</p>

<p>Mother took an arm of each.</p>

<p>&quot;How awfully nice,&quot; said Phyllis, skipping joyfully, &quot;to think of
the dear Russian embracing his long-lost wife.  The baby must have
grown a lot since he saw it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder whether Father will think I'VE grown,&quot; Phyllis went on,
skipping still more gaily.  &quot;I have grown already, haven't I,
Mother?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mother, &quot;oh, yes,&quot; and Bobbie and Peter felt her hands
tighten on their arms.</p>

<p>&quot;Poor old Mammy, you ARE tired,&quot; said Peter.</p>

<p>Bobbie said, &quot;Come on, Phil; I'll race you to the gate.&quot;</p>

<p>And she started the race, though she hated doing it.  YOU know why
Bobbie did that.  Mother only thought that Bobbie was tired of
walking slowly.  Even Mothers, who love you better than anyone else
ever will, don't always understand.</p>
