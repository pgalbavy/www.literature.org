<p>Mr. Carewe returned, one warm May afternoon, by the six o'clock
boat, which was sometimes a day late and sometimes a few hours
early; the latter contingency arising, as in the present instance,
when the owner was aboard. Nelson drove him from the wharf to
the bank, where he conferred briefly, in an undertone, with Eugene
Madrillon; after which Eugene sent a note containing three words
to Tappingham Marsh. Marsh tore up the note, and sauntered over
to the club, where he found General Trumble and Jefferson Bareaud
amicably discussing a pitcher of cherry bounce.</p>

<p>"He has come," said Tappingham, pleased to find the pair the
only occupants of the place. "He saw Madrillon, and there's a
session to-night."</p>

<p>"Praise the Lord!" exclaimed the stout General, rising to his
feet. "I'll see old Chenoweth at once. My fingers have the itch."</p>

<p>"And mine, too," said Bareaud. "I'd begun to think we'd never
have a go with him again."</p>

<p>"You must see that Crailey comes. We want a full table. Drag
him, if you can't get him any other way."</p>

<p>"He won't need urging," said Jefferson.</p>

<p>"But he cut us last time."</p>

<p>"He won't cut tonight. What hour?"</p>

<p>"Nine," answered Tappingham. "It's to be a full sitting, remember."</p>

<p>"Don't fear for us," laughed Trumble.</p>

<p>"Nor for Crailey," Jefferson added. "After so long a vacation
you couldn't keep him away if you chained him to the court-house
pillars; he'd tear 'em in two!"</p>

<p>"Here's to our better fortunes, then!" said the old soldier,
filling a glass for Tappingham; and, "Here's to our better fortunes!"
echoed the young men, pouring off the gentle liquor heartily.
Having thus made libation to their particular god, the trio separated.
But Jefferson did not encounter the alacrity of acceptance he
expected from Crailey, when he found him, half an hour later,
at the hotel bar. Indeed, at first, Mr. Gray not only refused
outright to go, but seriously urged the same course upon Jefferson;
moreover, his remonstrance was offered in such evident good faith
that Bareaud, in the act of swallowing one of his large doses
of quinine, paused with only half the powder down his throat,
gazing, nonplussed, at his prospective brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"My immortal soul!" he gasped. "Is this Crailey Gray? What's
the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Crailey, quietly. "Only don't go, you've lost
enough."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a beautiful one!" Jefferson exclaimed, with an
incredulous laugh. "You're a master hand; you, to talk about losing
enough!"</p>

<p>"I know, I know," Crailey began, shaking his head, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've promised Fanchon never to go again, and you're afraid
Miss Betty will see or hear us, and tell her you were there."</p>

<p>"I don't know Miss Carewe."</p>

<p>"Then you needn't fear; besides, she'll be out when we come,
and asleep when we go. She will never know we've been in the house."</p>

<p>"That has nothing to do with it," said Crailey, impatiently;
and he was the more earnest because he remembered the dangerous
geography of the Carewe house, which made it impossible for anyone
to leave the cupola-room except by the long hall which passed
certain doors. "I will not go, and what's more, I promised Fanchon
I'd try to keep you out of it hereafter."</p>

<p>"Lord, but we're virtuous!" laughed the incredulous Jefferson.
"I'll come for you at a quarter to nine."</p>

<p>"I will not go, I tell you."</p>

<p>Jefferson roared. "Yes, you will. You couldn't keep from it if
you tried!" And he took himself off, laughing violently, again
promising to call for Crailey on his way to the tryst, and leaving
him still warmly protesting that it would be a great folly for
either of them to go.</p>

<p>Crailey looked after the lad's long, thin figure with an expression
as near anger as he ever wore. "He'll go," he said to himself.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;ah, well &mdash;I'll have to risk it! I'll go with him,
but only to try and bring him away early&mdash;that is, as early as
it's safe to be sure that they are asleep downstairs. And I won't
play. No, I'll not play; I'll not play."</p>

<p>He paid his score and went out of the hotel by a side door. Some
distance up the street, Bareaud was still to be seen, lounging
homeward in the pleasant afternoon sunshine, he stopped on a corner
and serenely poured another quinine powder into himself and threw
the paper to a couple of pigs who looked up from the gutter maliciously.</p>

<p>"Confound him!" said Crailey, laughing ruefully. "He makes me
a missionary&mdash;for I'll keep my word to Fanchon in that, at least!
I'll look after Jefferson tonight. Ah, I might as well be old
Tom Vanrevel, indeed!"</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Carewe had taken possession of his own again.
His daughter ran to the door to meet him; she was trembling a
little, and, blushing and smiling, held out both her hands to
him, so that Mrs. Tanberry vowed this was the loveliest creature
in the world, and the kindest.</p>

<p>Mr. Carewe bowed slightly, as to an acquaintance, and disregarded
the extended hands.</p>

<p>At that, the blush faded from Miss Betty's cheeks; she trembled
no more, and a salutation as icy as her father's was returned
to him. He bent his heavy brows upon her, and shot a black glance
her way, being, of course, immediately enraged by her reflection
of his own manner, but he did not speak to her.</p>

<p>Nor did he once address her during the evening meal, preferring
to honor Mrs. Tanberry with his conversation, to that diplomatic
lady's secret anger, but outward amusement. She cheerfully neglected
to answer him at times, having not the slightest awe of him, and
turned to the girl instead; indeed, she was only prevented from
rating him soundly at his own table by the fear that she might
make the situation more difficult for her young charge. As soon
as it was possible, she made her escape with Miss Betty, and they
drove away in the twilight to pay visits of duty, leaving Mr.
Carewe frowning at his coffee on the veranda.</p>

<p>When they came home, three hours later, Miss Betty noticed that
a fringe of illumination bordered each of the heavily curtained
windows in the cupola, and she uttered an exclamation, for she
had never known that room to be lighted.</p>

<p>"Look!" she cried, touching Mrs. Tanberry's arm, as the horses
trotted through the gates under a drizzle of rain, "I thought
the room in the cupola was empty. It's always locked, and when
I came from St. Mary's he told me that old furniture was stored
there."</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry was grateful for the darkness. "He may have gone
there to read," she answered, in a queer voice. "Let us go quietly
to bed, child, so as not to disturb him."</p>

<p>Betty had as little desire to disturb her father as she had to
see him; therefore she obeyed her friend's injunction, and went
to her room on tip-toe. The house was very silent as she lit the
candles on her bureau. Outside, the gentle drizzle and the soothing
tinkle from the eaves were the only sounds; within, there was
but the faint rustle of garments from Mrs. Tanberry's room. Presently
the latter ceased to be heard, and a wooden moan of protest from
the four-poster upon which the good lady reposed, announced that
she had drawn the curtains and wooed the rulers of Nod.</p>

<p>Although it was one of those nights of which they say, "It is
a good night to sleep," Miss Betty was not drowsy. She had half-unfastened
one small sandal, but she tied the ribbons again, and seated herself
by the open window. The ledge and casement framed a dim oblong
of thin light from the candles behind her, a lonely lustre, which
crossed the veranda to melt shapelessly into darkness on the soggy
lawn. She felt a melancholy in the softly falling rain and wet,
black foliage that chimed with the sadness of her own spirit.
The night suited her very well, for her father's coming had brought
a weight of depression with it. Why could he not have spoken one
word to her, even a cross one? She knew that he did not love her,
yet, merely as a fellow-being, she was entitled to a measure of
courtesy; and the fact that she was his daughter could not excuse
his failure to render it. Was she to continue to live with him
on their present terms? She had no intention to make another effort
to alter them; but to remain as they were would be intolerable,
and Mrs. Tanberry could not stay forever, to act as a buffer between
her and her father. Peering out into the dismal night, she found
her own future as black, and it seemed no wonder that the Sisters
loved the convent life; that the pale nuns forsook the world wherein
there was so much useless unkindness; where women were petty and
jealous, like that cowardly Fanchon, and men who looked great
were tricksters, like Fanchon's betrothed. Miss Betty clenched
her delicate fingers. She would not remember that white, startled
face again!</p>

<p>Another face helped her to shut out the recollection: that of
the man who had come to mass to meet her yesterday morning, and
with whom she had taken a long walk afterward. He had shown her
a quaint old English gardener who lived on the bank of the river,
had bought her a bouquet, and she had helped him to select another
to send to a sick friend. How beautiful the flowers were, and
how happy he had made the morning for her, with his gayety, his
lightness, and his odd wisdom! Was it only yesterday? Her father's
coming had made yesterday a fortnight old.</p>

<p>But the continuously pattering rain and the soft drip-drop from
the roof, though as mournful as she chose to find them, began,
afterwhile, to weave their somnolent spells, and she slowly drifted
from reveries of unhappy sorts, into half-dreams, in which she
was still aware she was awake; yet slumber, heavy-eyed, stirring
from the curtains beside her with the small night breeze, breathed
strange distortions upon familiar things, and drowsy impossibilities
moved upon the surface of her thoughts. Her chin, resting upon
her hand, sank gently, until her head almost lay upon her relaxed
arms.</p>

<p>"That is mine, Crailey Gray!"</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, immeasurably startled, one hand clutching
the back of her chair, the other tremulously pressed to her cheek,
convinced that her father had stooped over her and shouted the
sentence in her ear. For it was his voice, and the house rang
with the words; all the rooms, halls, and even the walls, seemed
still murmurous with the sudden sound, like the tingling of a
bell after it had been struck. And yet&mdash;everything was quiet.</p>

<p>She pressed her fingers to her forehead, trying to untangle the
maze of dreams which had evolved this shock for her, the sudden
clamor in her father's voice of a name she hated and hoped never
to hear again, a name she was trying to forget. But as she was
unable to trace anything which had led to it, there remained only
the conclusion that her nerves were not what they should be. The
vapors having become obsolete for young ladies as an explanation
for all unpleasant sensations, they were instructed to have "nerves."
This was Miss Betty's first consciousness of her own, and, desiring
no greater acquaintance with them, she told herself it was unwholesome
to fall asleep in a chair by an open window when the night was
as sad as she.</p>

<p>Turning to a chair in front of the small oval mirror of her bureau,
she unclasped the brooch which held her lace collar, and, seating
herself, began to unfasten her hair. Suddenly she paused, her
uplifted arms falling mechanically to her sides.</p>

<p>Someone was coming through the long hall with a soft, almost
inaudible step, a step which was not her father's. She knew at
once, with instinctive certainty, that it was not he. Nor was
it Nelson, who would have shuffled; nor could it be the vain Mamie,
nor one of the other servants, for they did not sleep in the house.
It was a step more like a woman's, though certainly it was not
Mrs. Tanberry's.</p>

<p>Betty rose, took a candle, and stood silent for a moment, the
heavy tresses of her hair, half-unloosed, falling upon her neck
and left shoulder like the folds of a dark drapery.</p>

<p>At the slight rustle of her rising, the steps ceased instantly.
Her heart set up a wild beating and the candle shook in her hand.
But she was brave and young, and, following an irresistible impulse,
she ran across the room, flung open the door, and threw the light
of the candle into the hall, holding it at arm's length before
her.</p>

<p>She came almost face to face with Crailey Gray.</p>

<p>The blood went from his cheeks as a swallow flies down from a
roof; he started back against the opposite wall with a stifled
groan, while she stared at him blankly, and grew as deathly pale
as he.</p>

<p>He was a man of great resource in all emergencies which required
a quick tongue, but, for the moment, this was beyond him. He felt
himself lost, toppling backward into an abyss, and the uselessness
of his destruction made him physically sick. For he need not have
been there; he had not wished to come; he had well counted the
danger to himself, and this one time in his life had gone to the
cupola-room out of good-nature. But Bareaud had been obstinate
and Crailey had come away alone, hoping that Jefferson might follow.
And here he was, poor trapped rat, convicted and ruined because
of a good action! At last he knew consistency to be a jewel, and
that a greedy boy should never give a crust; that a fool should
stick to his folly, a villain to his deviltry, and each hold his
own; for the man who thrusts a good deed into a life of lies is
wound about with perilous passes, and in his devious ways a thousand
unexpected damnations spring.</p>

<p>Beaten, stunned, hang-jawed with despair, he returned her long,
dumfounded gaze hopelessly and told the truth like an inspired
dunce.</p>

<p>"I came &mdash;I came&mdash;to bring another man away," he whispered
brokenly; and, at the very moment, several heavy, half-suppressed
voices broke into eager talk overhead.</p>

<p>The white hand that held the candle wavered, and the shadows
glided in a huge, grotesque dance. Twice she essayed to speak
before she could do so, at the same moment motioning him back,
for he had made a vague gesture toward her.</p>

<p>"I am not faint. Do you mean, away from up there?" She pointed
to the cupola-stairs.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Have-have you seen my father?"</p>

<p>The question came out of such a depth of incredulousness that
it was more an articulation of the lips than a sound, but he caught
it; and, with it not hope, but the shadow of a shadow of hope,
a hand waving from the far shore to the swimmer who has been down
twice. Did she fear for his sake?</p>

<p>"No &mdash;I have not seen him." He was groping blindly.</p>

<p>"You did not come from that"</p>

<p>"How did you enter the house?"</p>

<p>The draught through the hall was blowing upon him; the double
doors upon the veranda had been left open for coolness. "There,"
he said, pointing to them.</p>

<p>"But &mdash;I heard you come from the other direction."</p>

<p>He was breathing quickly; he saw his chance&mdash;if Jefferson Bareaud
did not come now.</p>

<p>"You did not hear me come down the stairs." He leaned toward
her, risking it all on that.</p>

<p>"Ah!" A sigh too like a gasp burst from Crailey. His head lifted
a little, and his eyes were luminous with an eagerness that was
almost anguish. He set his utmost will at work to collect himself
and to think hard and fast.</p>

<p>"I came here resolved to take a man away, come what would!" he
said. "I found the door open, went to the foot of that stairway;
then I stopped. I remembered something; I turned, and was going
away when you opened the door."</p>

<p>"You remembered what?"</p>

<p>Her strained attitude did not relax, nor, to his utmost scrutiny,
was the complete astonishment of her distended gaze altered one
whit, but a hint of her accustomed high color was again upon her
cheek and her lip trembled a little, like that of a child about
to weep. The flicker of hope in his breast increased prodigiously,
and the rush of it took the breath from his throat and choked
him. Good God! was she going to believe him?</p>

<p>"I remembered&mdash;you!"</p>

<p>"What?" she said, wonderingly.</p>

<p>Art returned with a splendid bound, full-pinioned, his beautiful
and treacherous Familiar who had deserted him at the crucial instant;
but she made up for it now, folding him in protective wings and
breathing through his spirit. In rapid and vehement whispers he
poured out the words upon the girl in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I have a friend, and I would lay down my life to make him what
he could be. He has always thrown everything away, his life, his
talents, all his money and all of mine, for the sake of&mdash;throwing
them away! Some other must tell you about that room; but it has
ruined my friend. Tonight I discovered that he had been summoned
here, and I made up my mind to come and take him away. Your father
has sworn to shoot me if I set foot in his house or on ground
of his. Well, my duty was clear and I came to do it. And yet &mdash;I
stopped at the foot of the stair&mdash;because&mdash;because I remembered
that you were Robert Carewe's daughter. What of you, if I went
up and harm came to me from your father? For I swear I would not
have touched him! You asked me not to speak of 'personal' things,
and I have obeyed you; but you see I must tell you one thing now:
I have cared for this friend of mine more than for all else under
heaven, but I turned and left him to his ruin, and would a thousand
times, rather than bring trouble upon you! 'A thousand times?'
Ah! I swear it should be a thousand times a thousand!"</p>

<p>He had paraded in one speech from the prisoner's dock to Capulet's
garden, and her eyes were shining into his like a great light
when he finished.</p>

<p>"Go quickly," she whispered. "Go quickly! Go quickly!"</p>

<p>"But do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but I shall. Will you go? They might come-my father
might come-at any moment."</p>

<p>"But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you want to drive me quite mad? Please go!" She laid a trembling,
urgent hand upon his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Never, until you tell me that you understand," replied Crailey
firmly, listening keenly for the slightest sound from overhead.
"Never&mdash;until then!"</p>

<p>"When I do I shall tell you; now I only know that you must go."</p>

<p>"But tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must go!"</p>

<p>There was a shuffling of chairs on the floor overhead, and Crailey
went. He went even more hastily than might have been expected
from the adaman-tine attitude he had just previously assumed.
Realizing this as he reached the wet path, he risked stealing
round to her window:</p>

<p>"For your sake!" he breathed; and having thus forestalled any
trifling imperfection which might arise in her recollection of
his exit from the house, he disappeared, kissing his hand to the
rain as he ran down the street.</p>

<p>Miss Betty locked her door and pulled close the curtains of her
window. A numerous but careful sound of footsteps came from the
hall, went by her door and out across the veranda. Silently she
waited until she heard her father go alone to his room.</p>

<p>She took the candle and went in to Mrs. Tanberry. She set the
light upon a table, pulled a chair close to the bedside, and placed
her cool hand lightly on the great lady's forehead.</p>

<p>"Isn't it very late, child? Why are you not asleep?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Tanberry, I want to know why there was a light in the cupola-room
tonight?"</p>

<p>"What?" Mrs. Tanberry rolled herself as upright as possible,
and sat with blinking eyes.</p>

<p>"I want to know what I am sure you know, and what I am sure everybody
knows, except me. What were they doing there tonight, and what
was the quarrel between Mr. Vanrevel and my father that had to
do with Mr. Gray?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry gazed earnestly into the girl's face. After a long
time she said in a gentle voice:</p>

<p>"Child, has it come to matter that much?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Betty.</p>
