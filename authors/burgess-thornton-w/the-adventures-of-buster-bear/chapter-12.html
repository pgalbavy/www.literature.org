<p>He was turning it all over in his mind and studying what it could
mean, when he came to a little muddy place on the bank of the
Laughing Brook, and there he saw something that made his eyes
look as if they would pop right out of his head, and it was right
then that he felt his hair rise. Anyway, that is what he said
when he told about it afterward. What was it he saw? What do you
think? Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud. Yes, Sir, that's
what it was, and all it was. But it was the biggest footprint
Farmer Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it had been
made only a few minutes before. It was the footprint of Buster
Bear.</p>

<p>Now Farmer Brown's boy didn't know that Buster Bear had come
down to the Green Forest to live. He never had heard of a Bear
being in the Green Forest. And so he was so surprised that he
had hard work to believe his own eyes, and he had a queer feeling
all over,&mdash;a little chilly feeling, although it was a warm day.
Somehow, he didn't feel like meeting Buster Bear. If he had had
his terrible gun with him, it might have been different. But he
didn't, and so he suddenly made up his mind that he didn't want
to fish any more that day. He had a funny feeling, too, that he
was being watched, although he couldn't see any one. He <em>was</em>
being watched. Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear were watching
him and taking the greatest care to keep out of his sight.</p>

<p>All the way home through the Green Forest, Farmer Brown's boy
kept looking behind him, and he didn't draw a long breath until
he reached the edge of the Green Forest. He hadn't run, but he
had wanted to.</p>

<p>"Huh!" said Buster Bear to Little Joe Otter, "I believe he was
afraid!"</p>

<p>And Buster Bear was just exactly right.</p>
