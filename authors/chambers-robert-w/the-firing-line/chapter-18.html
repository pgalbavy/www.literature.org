<p>Shelia, standing by the lamplit table and resting one slim hand
on the edge of it, waited for Hamil to give the signal for separation.</p>

<p>Instead he said: "Are you really sleepy?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I dare not&mdash;to-night."</p>

<p>"For any particular reason?"</p>

<p>"For a thousand.... One is that I simply can't believe you are
really going North to-morrow. Why do you?" She had asked it nearly
a thousand times.</p>

<p>"I've got to begin Portlaw's park; and, besides, my work here
is over&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is that all you care about me? Oh, you are truly like the real
Ulysses:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Now toils the hero, trees on trees o'erthrown<br/>
Fall crackling round him, and the forests groan!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Do you remember, in the Odyssey, when poor Calypso begs him to
remain?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Thus spoke Calypso to her god-like guest:<br/>
'This shows thee, friend, by old experience taught,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn'd in all the wiles of human thought,<br/>
How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!<br/>
Thus wilt thou leave me? Are we thus to part?<br/>
Is Portlaw's Park the passion of thy heart?'"

</p>
</div>
<p>Laughing, he answered in the Grecian verse:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Whatever the gods shall destine me to bear,<br/>
'Tis mine to master with a constant mind;<br/>
Inured to peril, to the worst resigned,<br/>
Still I can suffer; their high will be done."

</p>
</div>
<p>From the soft oval of her face the smile faded, but her voice
was still carelessly gay:</p>

<p>"And so he went away. But, concerning his nymph, Calypso, further
Homer sayeth not. Yet&mdash;in the immortal verse it chanced to be
he, not she, who was&mdash;married.... And I think I'll retire now&mdash;if
you have nothing more agreeable to say to me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have; in the garden&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I dare not risk it to-night. The guards are about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is my last night here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We will see each other very soon in New York. And I'll be up
in the morning to drive you to the station&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, Shiela, dear&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There was a bad nigger hanging around the groves last night
and our patrols are out.... No, it's too risky. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking."</p>

<p>He said, tenderly impatient:</p>

<p>"You little witch of Ogygia, come into the <em>patio</em> then,
and do your thinking and let me make love to you."</p>

<p>But she would not raise her eyes, standing there in the rose
lamplight, the perverse smile still edging her lips.</p>

<p>"Calypso," he repeated persuasively.</p>

<p>"No.... Besides, I have nothing to offer you, Ulysses.... You
remember what the real Calypso offered the real Ulysses if he'd
remain with her in Ogygia?"</p>

<p>"Eternal youth and love?" He bent over the table, moving his
hand to cover hers where it rested in the lamplight. "You have
given me eternity in love already," he said.</p>

<p>"Have I?" But she would not lift her eyes.... "Then why make
love to me if you have it ready-made for you?"</p>

<p>"Will you come?"</p>

<p>And she, quoting the Odyssey again:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Swear, then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes;<br/>
Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods!"

</p>
</div>
<p>And in turn he quoted:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art,<br/>
Forgive the weakness of a human heart."

</p>
</div>
<p>But she said with gay audacity, "I have nothing to forgive you&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Are you challenging me? Because I am likely to take you into
my arms at any moment if you are."</p>

<p>"Not <em>here</em> &mdash;Garry!"&mdash;looking up in quick concern,
for his recklessness at times dismayed her. Considering him doubtfully
she made up her mind that she was safe, and her little chin went
up in defiance.</p>

<p>"The hammock's in the <em>patio</em>," he said.</p>

<p>"There's moonlight there, too. No, thank you&mdash;with Cissy wakeful
and her windows commanding every nook!... Besides&mdash;as I told you,
I've been thinking."</p>

<p>"And what have you concluded?"</p>

<p>Delicate straight nose in the air, eyebrows arched in airy disdain,
she stood preoccupied with some little inward train of thought
that alternately made grave and gay the upcurled corners of her
lips.</p>

<p>"About this question of&mdash;ah&mdash;love-making&mdash;" dropping her eyes
in pretence of humility.</p>

<p>"It is no longer a question, you know."</p>

<p>She would <em>not</em> look up; her lashes seemed to rest on
the bloom of the rounded cheek as though the lids were shut, but
there came from the shadows between the lids a faint glimmer;
and he thought of that first day when from her lifted gaze a thousand
gay little demons seemed to laugh at him.</p>

<p>"I've been thinking," she remarked, "that this question of making
love to me should be seriously discussed."</p>

<p>"That's what I've been asking you to do in the <em>patio</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've been thinking, with deep but rather tardy concern, that
it is not the best policy for me to be&mdash;courted&mdash;any more."</p>

<p>She glanced up; her entire expression had suddenly altered to
a gravity unmistakable.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Can <em>you</em> tell <em>me</em>? I ask you, Garry, what has
happened?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nor <em>I.... </em>Because that little fool you kissed&mdash;so many,
many centuries ago&mdash;is not this disillusioned woman who is standing
here!... May I be a little bit serious with you?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he said, amused; "come out on the east balcony and
tell me what troubles you."</p>

<p>She considered him, smilingly suspicious of his alacrity.</p>

<p>"I don't think we had better go to the balcony." "Shiela, can't
you ever get over being ashamed when I make love to you?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to get over it, Garry."</p>

<p>"Are you still afraid to let me love you?"</p>

<p>Her mouth curved gravely as a perplexed child's; she looked down
at the table where his sun-burnt hand now lay lightly across hers.</p>

<p>"I wished to speak to you about myself&mdash;if, somehow you could
help me to say what&mdash;what is very difficult for a girl to say
to a man&mdash;even when she loves him.... I don't think I can say
it, but I'll try."</p>

<p>"Then if you'll come to the balcony&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I can't trust you&mdash;or myself&mdash;unless we promise each other."</p>

<p>"Have I got to do that again?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if I am to go with you. I promise! Do you?"</p>

<p>"If I must," he said with very bad grace&mdash;so ungraciously in
fact that as they passed from the eastern corridor on to the Spanish
balcony she forgot her own promise and slipped her hand into his
in half-humourous, half-tender propitiation.</p>

<p>"Are you going to be disagreeable to me, Garry?"</p>

<p>"You darling!" he said; and, laughing, yet secretly dismayed
at her own perversion, she hurriedly untwisted her fingers from
his and made a new and fervid promise to replace the one just
broken.</p>

<p>The moonlight was magnificent, silvering forest, dune, and chaparral.
Far to the east a thin straight gleam revealed the sea.</p>

<p>She seated herself under the wall, lying back against it; he
lay extended on the marble shelf beside her, studying the moonlight
on her face.</p>

<p>"What was it you had to tell me, Shiela? Remember I am going
in the morning."</p>

<p>"I've turned cowardly; I cannot tell you.... Perhaps later....
Look at the Seminole moon, Garry. They have such a pretty name
for it in March &mdash;Tau-sau-tchusi&mdash;'Little Spring Moon'! And
in May they call it the 'Mulberry Moon' &mdash;Kee-hassi, and
in November it is a charming name &mdash;Hee-wu-li&mdash;'Falling Leaf
Moon'!&mdash;and August is Hyothlucco&mdash;'Big Ripening Moon.' ... Garry,
this moonlight is filling my veins with quicksilver. I feel very
restless, very heathenish." ... She cast a slanting side-glance
at him, lips parting with soundless laughter; and in the witchery
of the moon she seemed exquisitely unreal, head tipped back, slender
throat and shoulders snow-white in the magic lustre that enveloped
them.</p>

<p>Resting one bare arm on the marble she turned, chin on shoulder,
looking mischievously down at him, lovely, fresh, perfect as the
Cherokee roses that spread their creamy, flawless beauty across
the wall behind her.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly her expression changed to soft friendliness, to
tenderness, to a hint of deeper emotion; and her lids drooped
a little, then opened gravely under the quick caress of his eyes;
and very gently she moved her head from side to side as reminder
and refusal.</p>

<p>"Another man's wife," she said deliberately.... "Thy neighbour's
wife.... That's what we've done!"</p>

<p>Like a cut of a whip her words brought him upright to confront
her, his blood tingling on the quick edge of anger.</p>

<p>For always, deep within him, lay that impotent anger latent;
always his ignorance of this man haunted him like the aftermath
of an ugly dream. But of the man himself she had never spoken
since that first day in the wilderness. And then she had not named
him.</p>

<p>Her face had grown very serious, but her eyes remained unfathomable
under his angry gaze.</p>

<p>"Is there any reason to raise that spectre between us?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Dear, has it ever been laid?" she asked sorrowfully.</p>

<p>The muscles in his cheeks tightened and his eyes narrowed unpleasantly.
Only the one feature saved the man from sullen commonness in his
suppressed anger&mdash;and that was his boyish mouth, clean, sweet,
nobly moulded, giving the lie to the baffled brutality gleaming
in the eyes. And the spark died out as it had come, subdued, extinguished
when he could no longer sustain the quiet surprise of her regard.</p>

<p>"How very, very young you are after all," she said gently. "Come
nearer. Lift your sulky, wicked head. Now ask my pardon for not
understanding."</p>

<p>"I ask it.... But when you speak of him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush. He is only a shadow to you&mdash;scarcely more to me. He must
remain so. Do you not understand that I wish him to remain a shadow
to you&mdash;a thing without substance&mdash;without a name?"</p>

<p>He bent his head, nodding almost imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"Garry?"</p>

<p>He looked up in response.</p>

<p>"There is something else&mdash;if I could only say it.... I might
if you would close your eyes." ... She hesitated, half-fearful,
then drew his head down on her knees, daintily, using her finger-tips
only in the operation.</p>

<p>"Are you listening to what I am trying to tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very intently."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;it's about my being afraid&mdash;of love.... Are you listening?...
It is very difficult for me to say this.... It is about my being
afraid.... I used to be when I did not know enough to be. And
now, Garry, when I am less ignorant than I was&mdash;when I have divined
enough of my unknown self to be afraid&mdash;dearest, I am not."</p>

<p>She bent gently above the boyish head lying face downward on
her knees&mdash;waited timidly for some response, touched his hair.</p>

<p>"I am listening," he nodded.</p>

<p>She said: "My will to deny you, my courage to control myself
seem to be waning. I love you so; and it is becoming so much worse,
such a blind, unreasoning love.... And&mdash;do you think it will grow
so much worse that I could be capable of anything ignoble? Do
you think I might be mad enough to beg my freedom? I &mdash;I
don't know where it is leading me, dear. Do you? It is that which
bewilders me&mdash;that I should love you so&mdash;that I should not be
afraid to love you so.... Hush, dear! Don't speak&mdash;for I shall
never be able to tell you this if you speak, or look at me. And
I want to ask you a question. May I? And will you keep your eyes
covered?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;there are memories which burn my cheeks&mdash;hush! &mdash;I
do not regret them.... Only, what am I changing into that I am
capable of forgetting&mdash;everything&mdash;in the happiness of consenting
to things I never dreamed of&mdash;like this"&mdash;bending and laying her
lips softly against his cheek.... "That was wrong; it ought to
frighten me. But it does not."</p>

<p>He turned, looking up into the flushed young face and drew it
closer till their cheeks touched.</p>

<p>"Don't look at me! Why do you let me drift like this? It is madness&mdash;to
give up to each other the way we do&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish we could give up the world for each other."</p>

<p>"I wish so too. I would&mdash;except for the others. Do you suppose
I'd hesitate if it were not for them?"</p>

<p>They looked at each other with a new and subtler audacity.</p>

<p>"You see," she said with a wistful smile, "<em>this</em> is not
Shiela Cardross who sits here smiling into those brown eyes of
yours. I think I died before you ever saw me; and out of the sea
and the mist that day some changeling crept into your boat for
your soul's undoing. Do you remember in Ingoldsby&mdash;'The cidevant
daughter of the old Plantagenet line '?"</p>

<p>They laughed like children.</p>

<p>"Do you think our love-tempted souls are in any peril?" he asked
lightly.</p>

<p>The question arrested her mirth so suddenly that he thought she
must have misunderstood.</p>

<p>"What is it, Shiela?" he inquired, surprised.</p>

<p>"Garry&mdash;will you tell me something&mdash;if you can?... Then, what
does it mean, the saying&mdash;'souls lost through love'? Does it mean
what we have done?&mdash;because I am married? Would people think our
souls lost&mdash;if they knew?"</p>

<p>"No, you blessed child!"</p>

<p>"Well, how can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's a lie anyway," he said. "Nothing is lost through love.
It is something very different they mean."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said calmly, "something quite inconceivable, like
'Faust' and 'The Scarlet Letter,' ... I <em>thought</em> that
was what they meant!"</p>

<p>Brooding over him, silent, pensive, clear eyes fearlessly meeting
his, she drifted into guiltless retrospection.</p>

<p>"After all," she said, "except for letting everybody know that
we belong to each other this is practically like marriage. Look
at that honeymoon up there, Garry.... If, somehow, they could
think we are engaged, and would let us alone for the rest of our
lives, it would not matter.... Except I should like to have a
house alone with you."</p>

<p>And she stooped, resting her cheek lightly against his, eyes
vaguely sweet in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"I love you so," she murmured, as though to herself, "and there
seems no end to it. It is such a hopeless sequence when yesterday's
love becomes to-day's adoration and to-morrow's worship. What
am I to do? What is the use of saying I am not free to love you,
when I do?" She smiled dreamily. "I was silly enough to think
it impossible once. Do you remember?"</p>

<p>"You darling!" he whispered, adoring her innocence. Then as he
lay, head cradled on her knees, looking up at her, all unbidden,
a vision of the future in its sharp-cut ominous desolation flashed
into his vision&mdash;the world without her!&mdash;the endless stretch of
time&mdash;youth with no meaning, effort wasted, attainment without
desire, loneliness, arid, terrible days unending.</p>

<p>"It is too&mdash;too senseless!" he breathed, stumbling to his feet
as the vague, scarcely formulated horror of it suddenly turned
keen and bit into him as he began to realise for the first time
something of what it threatened.</p>

<p>"What is it, Garry?" she asked in gentle concern, as he stood
looking darkly at her. "Is it time to go? You are tired, I know."
She rose and opened the great glass doors. "You poor tired boy,"
she whispered, waiting for him. And as he did not stir: "What
is the matter, Garry?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I am trying to understand that our winter is ended."</p>

<p>She nodded. "Mother and Gray and Cecile and I go North in April....
I wish we might stay through May&mdash;that is, if you&mdash;" She looked
at him in silent consternation. "Where will <em>you</em> be!"</p>

<p>He said in a sullen voice: "That is what I was thinking of&mdash;our
separation.... Do you realise that it is almost here?"</p>

<p>"No," she said faintly, "I cannot."</p>

<p>He moved forward, opening the glass doors wider; she laid one
hand on his arm as though to guide herself; but the eastern corridors
were bright with moonlight, every corner illuminated.</p>

<p>They were very silent until they turned into the south corridor
and reached her door; and there he suddenly gave way to his passionate
resentment, breaking out like a spoiled boy:</p>

<p>"Shiela, I tell you it's going to be unendurable! There must
be some way out, some chance for us.... I <em>don't</em> mean
to ask you to do what is&mdash;what you consider dishonourable. You
wouldn't do it anyway, whether or not I asked you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But don't ask me," she said, turning very white. "I don't know
what I am capable of if I should ever see you suffer!"</p>

<p>"You <em>couldn't</em> do it!" he repeated; "it isn't in you
to take your happiness at their expense, is it? You say you know
how they would feel; I don't. But if you're asking for an annulment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Do you mean divorce?"</p>

<p>"No.... That is&mdash;different&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You dear," he said, suddenly gentle, "you have never been a&mdash;wife;
and you don't know it."</p>

<p>"Garry, are you mad?"</p>

<p>"Shiela, dear, some day will you very quietly ask some woman
the difference between divorce and annulment?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes, if you wish.... Is it something you mayn't tell me, Garry?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... I don't know! You sometimes make me feel as though I
could tell you anything.... Of course I couldn't ... you darling!"
He stepped nearer. "You are so good and sweet, so utterly beyond
evil, or the vaguest thought of it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Garry &mdash;I am <em>not</em>! And you know it!"</p>

<p>He only laughed at her.</p>

<p>"You <em>don't</em> think I am a horrid sort of saint, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, not the horrid sort&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Garry! How can you say such things when I'm half ready now to
run away with you!"</p>

<p>The sudden hint of fire in her face and voice, and something
new in her eyes, sobered him.</p>

<p>"Now do you know what I am?" she said, breathing unevenly and
watching him. "Only one thing keeps me respectable. I'd go with
you; I'd live in rags to be with you. I ask nothing in the world
or of the world except you. You could make me what you pleased,
mould me&mdash;mar me, I believe&mdash;and I would be the happiest woman
who ever loved. <em>That</em> is your saint!"</p>

<p>Flushed with her swift emotion, she stood a minute facing him,
then laid her hand on the door knob behind her, still looking
him in the eyes. Behind her the door slowly swung open under the
pressure.</p>

<p>His own self-control was fast going; he dared not trust himself
to speak lest he break down and beg for the only chance that her
loyalty to others forbade her to take. But the new and deeper
emotion which she had betrayed had awakened the ever-kindling
impatience in him, and now, afire, he stood looking desperately
on all he must for ever lose, till the suffering seemed unendurable
in the checked violence of his revolt.</p>

<p>"Good night," she whispered sorrowfully, as the shadow deepened
on his altered face.</p>

<p>"Are you going!"</p>

<p>"Yes.... And, somehow I feel that perhaps it is better not to&mdash;kiss
me to-night. When I see you&mdash;this way &mdash;Garry, I could find
it in me to do anything&mdash;almost.... Good night."</p>

<p>Watching him, she waited in silence for a while, then turned
slowly and lighted the tiny night-lamp on the table beside her
bed.</p>

<p>When she returned to the open door there was no light in the
hall. She heard him moving somewhere in the distance.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Garry?"</p>

<p>He came back slowly through the dim corridor.</p>

<p>"Were you going without a word to me?" she asked.</p>

<p>He came nearer and leaned against the doorway.</p>

<p>"You are quite right," he said sullenly. "I've been a fool to
let us drift in this way. I don't know where we're headed for,
and it's time I did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"&mdash;in soft consternation.</p>

<p>"That there is no hope left for us&mdash;and that we are both pretty
young, both in love, both close to desperation. At times I tell
you I feel like a cornered beast&mdash;feel like showing my teeth at
the world&mdash;like tearing you from it at any cost. I'd do it, too,
if it were not for your father and mother. You and I could stand
it."</p>

<p>"I would let you do it&mdash;if it were not for them," she said.</p>

<p>They looked at one another, both pale.</p>

<p>"Would you give up the whole moral show for me?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You'd get a first-rate scoundrel."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care if it were you."</p>

<p>"There's one thing," he said with a bluntness bordering on brutality,
"all this is changing me into a man unfit to touch you. I warn
you."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"I tell you not to trust me!" he said almost savagely. "With
heart and soul and body on fire for you&mdash;mad for you &mdash;I'm
not to be trusted!"</p>

<p>"And I?" she faltered, deadly pale.</p>

<p>"You don't know what you're saying!" he said violently.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;I </em>begin to think I do.... Garry&mdash;Garry &mdash;I
am learning very fast!... How can I let you go!"</p>

<p>"The idea is," he said grimly, "for me to go before I go insane....
And never again to touch you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Peril!" he said. "I'm just a plain blackguard, Shiela."</p>

<p>"Would it change you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Not to touch me, not to kiss me. Could you go on always just
loving me?... Because if you could not&mdash;through the years that
are coming&mdash;I &mdash;I had rather take the risk&mdash;with you&mdash;than
lose you."</p>

<p>He stood, head bent, not trusting himself to speak or look at
her.</p>

<p>"Good-night," she said timidly.</p>

<p>He straightened up, stared at her, and turned on his heel, saying
good night in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Garry!"</p>

<p>"Good-night," he muttered, passing on.</p>

<p>Her heart was beating so violently that she pressed her hand
to it, leaning against the door sill.</p>

<p>"Garry!" she faltered, stretching out the other hand to him in
the darkness, "I &mdash;I do not care about the&mdash;risk&mdash;if you
care to&mdash;kiss me&mdash;"</p>

<p>He swung round from the shadows to the dimly lighted sill; crossed
it. For a moment they looked into one another's eyes; then, blinded,
she swayed imperceptibly toward him, sighing as his arms tightened
and her own crept up around his neck.</p>

<p>She yielded, resigning lips, and lids, and throat, and fragrant
hair, and each slim finger in caress unending.</p>

<p>Conscious of nothing save that body and soul were safe in his
beloved keeping, she turned to him in all the passion of a guiltless
love, whispering her adoration, her faith, her trust, her worship
of the man who held her; then, adrift once more, the breathless
magic overwhelmed her; and she drew him to her, closer, desperately,
hiding her head on his breast.</p>

<p>"Take me away, Garry," she stammered&mdash;"take me with you. There
is no use&mdash;no use fighting it back. I shall die if you leave me....
Will you take me? <em>I&mdash;</em>will be&mdash;everything that&mdash;that you
would have me&mdash;that you might wish for&mdash;in&mdash;in a&mdash;wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was crying now, crying her heart out, her face crushed against
his shoulder, clinging to him convulsively.</p>

<p>"Will you take me, Garry? What am I without you? I cannot give
you up! I will not.... Nobody can ask that of me &mdash;How can
they ask that of me?&mdash;to give you up&mdash;to let you go out of my
little world for ever&mdash;to turn from you, refuse you!... What a
punishment for one instant's folly! If they knew they would not
let me suffer this way! &mdash;They would want me to tell them&mdash;"</p>

<p>His dry lips unclosed. "Then <em>tell</em> them!" he tried to
say, but the words were without sound; and, in the crisis of temptation,
at the very instant of yielding, suddenly he knew, somehow, that
he would not yield.</p>

<p>It came to him calmly, without surprise or shock, this stupid
certainty of himself. And at the same moment the crisis was passing,
leaving him stunned, impassive, half senseless as the resurgent
passion battered at his will power, to wreck and undo it&mdash;deafening,
imperative, wave on wave, in vain.</p>

<p>The thing to do was to hold on. One of them was adrift; the other
dared not let go; he seemed to realise it, somehow. Odd bits of
phrases, old-fashioned sayings, maxims long obsolete came to him
without reason or sequence&mdash;"Greater love hath no man&mdash;no man&mdash;no
man&mdash;" and "As ye do unto the least of these "&mdash;odd bits of phrases,
old-fashioned sayings, maxims, alas! long obsolete, long buried
with the wisdom of the dead.</p>

<p>He held her still locked in his arms. From time to time, unconsciously,
as her hot grief spent itself, he bent his head, laying his face
against hers, while his haggard, perplexed gaze wandered about
the room.</p>

<p>In the dimness the snowy bed loomed beside them; pink roses patterned
curtain and wall; the tiny night-light threw a roseate glow across
her gown. In the fresh, sweet stillness of the room there was
no sound or stir save their uneven breathing.</p>

<p>Very gently he lifted one of her hands and looked at it almost
curiously&mdash;this small white hand so innocently smooth&mdash;as unblemished
as a child's&mdash;this unsullied little hand that for an instant seemed
to be slowly relaxing its grasp on the white simplicity around
her&mdash;here in this dim, fresh, fragrant world of hers, called,
intimately, her room.</p>

<p>And here where night and morning had so long held sacred all
that he cared for upon earth&mdash;here in the white symbol of the
world&mdash;her room&mdash;he gave himself again to her, without a word,
without hope, knowing the end of all was near for them.</p>

<p>But it was she, not he, who must make the sign that ended all.
And, after a long, long time, as she made no sign:</p>

<p>"Dearest," he breathed, "I know now that you will never go with
me&mdash;for your father's sake."</p>

<p>That was premature, for she only clung the closer. He waited
cautiously, every instinct alert, his head close to hers. And
at last the hot fragrance of her tears announced the beginning
of the end.</p>

<p>"Shiela?"</p>

<p>A stifled sound from his shoulder where her head lay buried.</p>

<p>"Choose now," he said.</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Choose."</p>

<p>She cowered in his arms. He looked at the little hand once more,
no longer limp but clenched against his breast. And he knew that
the end was close at hand, and he spoke again, forcing her to
her victory.</p>

<p>"Dearest, you must choose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Garry!"</p>

<p>"Between those others&mdash;and me&mdash;"</p>

<p>She shrank out of his arms, turned with a sob, swayed, and sank
on her knees beside the bed, burying her head in her crossed arms.</p>

<p>This was her answer; and with it he went away into the darkness,
reeling, groping, while every pulse in him hammered ironic salutation
to the victor who had loved too well to win. And in his whirling
brain sounded the mocking repetition of his own words: "Nothing
is lost through love! Nothing is lost&mdash;nothing&mdash;nothing!"&mdash;flouting,
taunting him who had lost love itself there on the firing line,
for a comrade's sake.</p>

<p>His room was palely luminous with the lustre of the night. On
the mantel squatted a little wizened and gilded god peering and
leering at him through the shadows &mdash;Malcourt's parting gift&mdash;the
ugliest of the nineteen.</p>

<p>"For," said Malcourt&mdash;"there ought to be only eighteen by rights&mdash;unless
further complications arise; and this really belongs to you, anyway."</p>

<p>So he left the thing on Hamil's mantel, although the latter had
no idea what Malcourt meant, or why he made the parting offering.</p>

<p>Now he stood there staring at it like a man whose senses waver,
and who fixes some object to steady nerve and brain.</p>

<p>Far in the night the voice of the ocean stirred the silence&mdash;the
ocean which had given her to him that day in the golden age of
fable when life and the world were young together, and love wore
a laughing mask.</p>

<p>He listened; all the night was sighing with the sigh of the surf;
and the breeze in the trees mourned; and the lustre died out in
thickening darkness as he stood there, listening.</p>

<p>Then all around him through the hushed obscurity a vague murmur
grew, accentless, sad, interminable; and through the monotone
of the falling rain he heard the ocean very far away washing the
body of a young world dead to him for ever.</p>

<p>Crouched low beside her bed, face quivering in her arms, she
heard, in the stillness, the call of the sea&mdash;that enchanted sea
which had given him to her that day, when Time and the World were
young together in the blessed age of dreams.</p>

<p>And she heard the far complaint of the surf, breaking unsatisfied;
and a strange wind flowing through the trees; then silence, suspense;
and the world's dark void slowly filling with the dreadful monotone
of the rain.</p>

<p>Storm after storm of agony and doubt swept her; she prayed convulsively,
at random, reiterating incoherence in blind, frightened repetition
till the stupefying sequence lost all meaning.</p>

<p>Exhausted, half-senseless, her hands still clung together, her
tear-swollen lips still moved to form his name, asking God's mercy
on them both. But the end had come.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Then fell prone, head buried in her tumbled hair."]</p>

<p>Yes, the end; she knew it now&mdash;understood what had happened,
what must be. And, knowing, she heard the sea-rain whispering
their judgment, and the winds repeating it across the wastes.</p>

<p>She raised her head, dumb, rigid, listening, and stared through
the shaking window into obscurity. Lightning flickered along the
rim of the world&mdash;a pallid threat above the sea&mdash;the sea which
had given them to one another and left them stranded in each other's
arms there on the crumbling edges of destruction.</p>

<p>Her strained eyes divined, her straining senses comprehended;
she cringed lower, aghast, swaying under the menace, then fell
prone, head buried in her tumbled hair.</p>

<p>In the morning he left for the North and Portlaw's camp. Gray
drove him to the station; Cecile, in distractingly pretty negligee
waved him audacious adieu from her window.</p>

<p>"Shiela seems to be ill," explained Gray, as the motor car shot
out into the haze of early morning. "She asked me to say good-bye
for her.... I say, Hamil, you're looking rather ill yourself.
This climate is sure to get a white man sooner or later, if he
remains too long. But the North will put you into condition. You're
going straight to Portlaw's camp on Luckless Lake?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hamil listlessly.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll be in New York in a week or two. You'll surely look
us up when you're in town, won't you? And write me a line about
Acton and father&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>"Surely," nodded Hamil absently.</p>

<p>And they sped on, the vast distorted shadow of the car racing
beside them to the station.</p>
