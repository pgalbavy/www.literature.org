<p>The moment Lupin had finished lunch, he at once and, so to speak,
without transition, recovered all his mastery and authority. The
time for joking was past; and he must no longer yield to his love of
astonishing people with claptrap and conjuring tricks. Now that he had
discovered the crystal stopper in the hiding-place which he had
guessed with absolute certainty, now that he possessed the list of the
Twenty-seven, it became a question of playing off the last game of the
rubber without delay.
</p>
<p>It was child’s play, no doubt, and what remained to be done presented no
difficulty. Nevertheless, it was essential that he should perform these
final actions with promptness, decision and infallible perspicacity. The
smallest blunder was irretrievable. Lupin knew this; but his strangely
lucid brain had allowed for every contingency. And the movements and
words which he was now about to make and utter were all fully prepared
and matured:
</p><p>“Growler, the commissionaire is waiting on the Boulevard Gambetta with
his barrow and the trunk which we bought. Bring him here and have the
trunk carried up. If the people of the hotel ask any questions, say it’s
for the lady in No. 130.”
</p><p>Then, addressing his other companion:
</p><p>“Masher, go back to the station and take over the limousine. The price
is arranged: ten thousand francs. Buy a chauffeur’s cap and overcoat and
bring the car to the hotel.”
</p><p>“The money, governor.”
</p><p>Lupin opened a pocketbook which had been removed from Daubrecq’s jacket
and produced a huge bundle of bank-notes. He separated ten of them:
</p><p>“Here you are. Our friend appears to have been doing well at the club.
Off with you, Masher!”
</p><p>The two men went out through Clarisse’s room. Lupin availed himself of
a moment when Clarisse Mergy was not looking to stow away the pocketbook
with the greatest satisfaction:
</p><p>“I shall have done a fair stroke of business,” he said to himself. “When
all the expenses are paid, I shall still be well to the good; and it’s
not over yet.”
</p><p>Then turning to Clarisse Mergy, he asked:
</p><p>“Have you a bag?”
</p><p>“Yes, I bought one when I reached Nice, with some linen and a few
necessaries; for I left Paris unprepared.”
</p><p>“Get all that ready. Then go down to the office. Say that you are
expecting a trunk which a commissionaire is bringing from the station
cloakroom and that you will want to unpack and pack it again in your
room; and tell them that you are leaving.”
</p><p>When alone, Lupin examined Daubrecq carefully, felt in all his pockets
and appropriated everything that seemed to present any sort of interest.
</p><p>The Growler was the first to return. The trunk, a large wicker hamper
covered with black moleskin, was taken into Clarisse’s room. Assisted by
Clarisse and the Growler, Lupin moved Daubrecq and put him in the trunk,
in a sitting posture, but with his head bent so as to allow of the lid
being fastened:
</p><p>“I don’t say that it’s as comfortable as your berth in a sleeping-car,
my dear deputy,” Lupin observed. “But, all the same, it’s better than a
coffin. At least, you can breathe. Three little holes in each side. You
have nothing to complain of!”
</p><p>Then, unstopping a flask:
</p><p>“A drop more chloroform? You seem to love it!...”
</p><p>He soaked the pad once more, while, by his orders, Clarisse and the
Growler propped up the deputy with linen, rugs and pillows, which they
had taken the precaution to heap in the trunk.
</p><p>“Capital!” said Lupin. “That trunk is fit to go round the world. Lock it
and strap it.”
</p><p>The Masher arrived, in a chauffeur’s livery:
</p><p>“The car’s below, governor.”
</p><p>“Good,” he said. “Take the trunk down between you. It would be dangerous
to give it to the hotel-servants.”
</p><p>“But if any one meets us?”
</p><p>“Well, what then, Masher? Aren’t you a chauffeur? You’re carrying the
trunk of your employer here present, the lady in No. 130, who will
also go down, step into her motor... and wait for me two hundred yards
farther on. Growler, you help to hoist the trunk up. Oh, first lock the
partition-door!”
</p><p>Lupin went to the next room, closed the other door, shot the bolt,
walked out, locked the door behind him and went down in the lift.
</p><p>In the office, he said:
</p><p>“M. Daubrecq has suddenly been called away to Monte Carlo. He asked me
to say that he would not be back until Tuesday and that you were to keep
his room for him. His things are all there. Here is the key.”
</p><p>He walked away quietly and went after the car, where he found Clarisse
lamenting:
</p><p>“We shall never be in Paris to-morrow! It’s madness! The least
breakdown...”
</p><p>“That’s why you and I are going to take the train. It’s safer...”
</p><p>He put her into a cab and gave his parting instructions to the two men:
</p><p>“Thirty miles an hour, on the average, do you understand? You’re to
drive and rest, turn and turn about. At that rate, you ought to be in
Paris between six and seven to-morrow evening. But don’t force the pace.
I’m keeping Daubrecq, not because I want him for my plans, but as a
hostage... and then by way of precaution... I like to feel that I can
lay my hands on him during the next few days. So look after the dear
fellow... Give him a few drops of chloroform every three or four hours:
it’s his one weakness... Off with you, Masher... And you, Daubrecq,
don’t get excited up there. The roof’ll bear you all right... If you
feel at all sick, don’t mind... Off you go, Masher!”
</p><p>He watched the car move into the distance and then told the cabman to
drive to a post-office, where he dispatched a telegram in these words:
</p><p> “M. Prasville, Prefecture de Police, Paris:
</p><p> “Person found.  Will bring you document eleven o’clock
 to-morrow morning.  Urgent communication.
</p><p><strong>“CLARISSE.”</strong>
</p><p>Clarisse and Lupin reached the station by half-past two.
</p><p>“If only there’s room!” said Clarisse, who was alarmed at the least
thing.
</p><p>“Room? Why, our berths are booked!”
</p><p>“By whom?”
</p><p>“By Jacob... by Daubrecq.”
</p><p>“How?”
</p><p>“Why, at the office of the hotel they gave me a letter which had come
for Daubrecq by express. It was the two berths which Jacob had sent him.
Also, I have his deputy’s pass. So we shall travel under the name of M.
and Mme. Daubrecq and we shall receive all the attention due to our rank
and station. You see, my dear madam, that everything’s arranged.”
</p><p>The journey, this time, seemed short to Lupin. Clarisse told him what
she had done during the past few days. He himself explained the miracle
of his sudden appearance in Daubrecq’s bedroom at the moment when his
adversary believed him in Italy:
</p><p>“A miracle, no,” he said. “But still a remarkable phenomenon took
place in me when I left San Remo, a sort of mysterious intuition which
prompted me first to try and jump out of the train--and the Masher
prevented me--and next to rush to the window, let down the glass and
follow the porter of the Ambassadeurs-Palace, who had given me your
message, with my eyes. Well, at that very minute, the porter aforesaid
was rubbing his hands with an air of such satisfaction that, for no
other reason, suddenly, I understood everything: I had been diddled,
taken in by Daubrecq, as you yourself were. Heaps of little details
flashed across my mind. My adversary’s scheme became clear to me from
start to finish. Another minute... and the disaster would have been
beyond remedy. I had, I confess, a few moments of real despair, at the
thought that I should not be able to repair all the mistakes that had
been made. It depended simply on the time-table of the trains, which
would either allow me or would not allow me to find Daubrecq’s emissary
on the railway-platform at San Remo. This time, at last, chance favoured
me. We had hardly alighted at the first station when a train passed, for
France. When we arrived at San Remo, the man was there. I had guessed
right. He no longer wore his hotel-porter’s cap and frock-coat, but a
jacket and bowler. He stepped into a second-class compartment. From that
moment, victory was assured.”
</p><p>“But... how...?” asked Clarisse, who, in spite of the thoughts that
obsessed her, was interested in Lupin’s story.
</p><p>“How did I find you? Lord, simply by not losing sight of Master Jacob,
while leaving him free to move about as he pleased, knowing that he was
bound to account for his actions to Daubrecq. In point of fact, this
morning, after spending the night in a small hotel at Nice, he met
Daubrecq on the Promenade des Anglais. They talked for some time. I
followed them. Daubrecq went back to the hotel, planted Jacob in one
of the passages on the ground-floor, opposite the telephone-office, and
went up in the lift. Ten minutes later I knew the number of his room and
knew that a lady had been occupying the next room, No. 130, since the
day before. ‘I believe we’ve done it,’ I said to the Growler and the
Masher. I tapped lightly at your door. No answer. And the door was
locked.”
</p><p>“Well?” asked Clarisse.
</p><p>“Well, we opened it. Do you think there’s only one key in the world
that will work a lock? So I walked in. Nobody in your room. But the
partition-door was ajar. I slipped through it. Thenceforth, a mere
hanging separated me from you, from Daubrecq and from the packet of
tobacco which I saw on the chimney-slab.”
</p><p>“Then you knew the hiding-place?”
</p><p>“A look round Daubrecq’s study in Paris showed me that that packet of
tobacco had disappeared. Besides...”
</p><p>“What?”
</p><p>“I knew, from certain confessions wrung from Daubrecq in the Lovers’
Tower, that the word Marie held the key to the riddle. Since then I had
certainly thought of this word, but with the preconceived notion that
it was spelt M A R I E. Well, it was really the first two syllables of
another word, which I guessed, so to speak, only at the moment when I
was struck by the absence of the packet of tobacco.”
</p><p>“What word do you mean?”
</p><p>“Maryland, Maryland tobacco, the only tobacco that Daubrecq smokes.”
</p><p>And Lupin began to laugh:
</p><p>“Wasn’t it silly? And, at the same time, wasn’t it clever of Daubrecq?
We looked everywhere, we ransacked everything. Didn’t I unscrew the
brass sockets of the electric lights to see if they contained a crystal
stopper? But how could I have thought, how could any one, however great
his perspicacity, have thought of tearing off the paper band of a packet
of Maryland, a band put on, gummed, sealed, stamped and dated by the
State, under the control of the Inland Revenue Office? Only think! The
State the accomplice of such an act of infamy! The Inland R-r-r-revenue
Awfice lending itself to such a trick! No, a thousand times no!
The Regie [*] is not perfect. It makes matches that won’t light and
cigarettes filled with hay. But there’s all the difference in the world
between recognizing that fact and believing the Inland Revenue to be
in league with Daubrecq with the object of hiding the list of the
Twenty-seven from the legitimate curiosity of the government and the
enterprising efforts of Arsene Lupin! Observe that all Daubrecq had to
do, in order to introduce the crystal stopper, was to bear upon the band
a little, loosen it, draw it back, unfold the yellow paper, remove the
tobacco and fasten it up again. Observe also that all we had to do, in
Paris, was to take the packet in our hands and examine it, in order to
discover the hiding-place. No matter! The packet itself, the plug of
Maryland made up and passed by the State and by the Inland Revenue
Office, was a sacred, intangible thing, a thing above suspicion! And
nobody opened it. That was how that demon of a Daubrecq allowed that
untouched packet of tobacco to lie about for months on his table, among
his pipes and among other unopened packets of tobacco. And no power on
earth could have given any one even the vaguest notion of looking into
that harmless little cube. I would have you observe, besides...” Lupin
went on pursuing his remarks relative to the packet of Maryland and the
crystal stopper. His adversary’s ingenuity and shrewdness interested him
all the more inasmuch as Lupin had ended by getting the better of him.
But to Clarisse these topics mattered much less than did her anxiety as
to the acts which must be performed to save her son; and she sat wrapped
in her own thoughts and hardly listened to him.

<p>“Are you sure,” she kept on repeating, “that you will succeed?”
</p><p>“Absolutely sure.”
</p><p>“But Prasville is not in Paris.”
</p><p>“If he’s not there, he’s at the Havre. I saw it in the paper yesterday.
In any case, a telegram will bring him to Paris at once.”
</p><p>“And do you think that he has enough influence?”
</p><p>“To obtain the pardon of Vaucheray and Gilbert personally. No. If he
had, we should have set him to work before now. But he is intelligent
enough to understand the value of what we are bringing him and to act
without a moment’s delay.”
</p><p>“But, to be accurate, are you not deceived as to that value?”
</p><p>“Was Daubrecq deceived? Was Daubrecq not in a better position than
any of us to know the full power of that paper? Did he not have twenty
proofs of it, each more convincing than the last? Think of all that he
was able to do, for the sole reason that people knew him to possess the
list. They knew it; and that was all. He did not use the list, but he
had it. And, having it, he killed your husband. He built up his fortune
on the ruin and the disgrace of the Twenty-seven. Only last week, one of
the gamest of the lot, d’Albufex, cut his throat in a prison. No, take
it from me, as the price of handing over that list, we could ask for
anything we pleased. And we are asking for what? Almost nothing ... less
than nothing... the pardon of a child of twenty. In other words, they
will take us for idiots. What! We have in our hands...”
</p><p>He stopped. Clarisse, exhausted by so much excitement, sat fast asleep
in front of him.
</p><p>They reached Paris at eight o’clock in the morning.
</p><p>Lupin found two telegrams awaiting him at his flat in the Place de
Clichy.
</p><p>One was from the Masher, dispatched from Avignon on the previous day
and stating that all was going well and that they hoped to keep their
appointment punctually that evening. The other was from Prasville, dated
from the Havre and addressed to Clarisse:
</p><p> “Impossible return to-morrow Monday morning.  Come to my office
 five o’clock.  Reckon on you absolutely.”
</p><p>“Five o’clock!” said Clarisse. “How late!”
</p><p>“It’s a first-rate hour,” declared Lupin.
</p><p>“Still, if...”
</p><p>“If the execution is to take place to-morrow morning: is that what you
mean to say?... Don’t be afraid to speak out, for the execution will not
take place.”
</p><p>“The newspapers...”
</p><p>“You haven’t read the newspapers and you are not to read them. Nothing
that they can say matters in the least. One thing alone matters: our
interview with Prasville. Besides...”
</p><p>He took a little bottle from a cupboard and, putting his hand on
Clarisse’s shoulder, said:
</p><p>“Lie down here, on the sofa, and take a few drops of this mixture.”
</p><p>“What’s it for?”
</p><p>“It will make you sleep for a few hours... and forget. That’s always so
much gained.”
</p><p>“No, no,” protested Clarisse, “I don’t want to. Gilbert is not asleep.
He is not forgetting.”
</p><p>“Drink it,” said Lupin, with gentle insistence. She yielded all of a
sudden, from cowardice, from excessive suffering, and did as she was
told and lay on the sofa and closed her eyes. In a few minutes she was
asleep.
</p><p>Lupin rang for his servant:
</p><p>“The newspapers... quick!... Have you bought them?”
</p><p>“Here they are, governor.”
</p><p>Lupin opened one of them and at once read the following lines:
</p><p><strong>“ARSENE LUPIN’S ACCOMPLICES”</strong>
</p><p>  “We know from a positive source that Arsene Lupin’s
  accomplices, Gilbert and Vaucheray, will be executed
  to-morrow, Tuesday, morning. M. Deibler has inspected
  the scaffold.  Everything is ready.”
</p><p>He raised his head with a defiant look.
</p><p>“Arsene Lupin’s accomplices! The execution of Arsene Lupin’s
accomplices! What a fine spectacle! And what a crowd there will be to
witness it! Sorry, gentlemen, but the curtain will not rise. Theatre
closed by order of the authorities. And the authorities are myself!”
</p><p>He struck his chest violently, with an arrogant gesture:
</p><p>“The authorities are myself!”
</p><p>At twelve o’clock Lupin received a telegram which the Masher had sent
from Lyons:
</p><p>“All well. Goods will arrive without damage.”
</p><p>At three o’clock Clarisse woke. Her first words were:
</p><p>“Is it to be to-morrow?”
</p><p>He did not answer. But she saw him look so calm and smiling that she
felt herself permeated with an immense sense of peace and received the
impression that everything was finished, disentangled, settled according
to her companion’s will.
</p><p>They left the house at ten minutes past four. Prasville’s secretary, who
had received his chief’s instructions by telephone, showed them into the
office and asked them to wait. It was a quarter to five.
</p><p>Prasville came running in at five o’clock exactly and, at once, cried:
</p><p>“Have you the list?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Give it me.”
</p><p>He put out his hand. Clarisse, who had risen from her chair, did not
stir.
</p><p>Prasville looked at her for a moment, hesitated and sat down. He
understood. In pursuing Daubrecq, Clarisse Mergy had not acted only
from hatred and the desire for revenge. Another motive prompted her. The
paper would not be handed over except upon conditions.
</p><p>“Sit down, please,” he said, thus showing that he accepted the
discussion.
</p><p>Clarisse resumed her seat and, when she remained silent, Prasville said:
</p><p>“Speak, my friend, and speak quite frankly. I do not scruple to say that
we wish to have that paper.”
</p><p>“If it is only a wish,” remarked Clarisse, whom Lupin had coached in
her part down to the least detail, “if it is only a wish, I fear that we
shall not be able to come to an arrangement.”
</p><p>Prasville smiled:
</p><p>“The wish, obviously, would lead us to make certain sacrifices.”
</p><p>“Every sacrifice,” said Mme. Mergy, correcting him.
</p><p>“Every sacrifice, provided, of course, that we keep within the bounds of
acceptable requirements.”
</p><p>“And even if we go beyond those bounds,” said Clarisse, inflexibly.
</p><p>Prasville began to lose patience:
</p><p>“Come, what is it all about? Explain yourself.”
</p><p>“Forgive me, my friend, but I wanted above all to mark the great
importance which you attach to that paper and, in view of the immediate
transaction which we are about to conclude, to specify--what shall I
say?--the value of my share in it. That value, which has no limits,
must, I repeat, be exchanged for an unlimited value.”
</p><p>“Agreed,” said Prasville, querulously.
</p><p>“I presume, therefore, that it is unnecessary for me to trace the whole
story of the business or to enumerate, on the one hand, the disasters
which the possession of that paper would have allowed you to avert and,
on the other hand, the incalculable advantages which you will be able to
derive from its possession?”
</p><p>Prasville had to make an effort to contain himself and to answer in a
tone that was civil, or nearly so:
</p><p>“I admit everything. Is that enough?”
</p><p>“I beg your pardon, but we cannot explain ourselves too plainly. And
there is one point that remains to be cleared up. Are you in a position
to treat, personally?”
</p><p>“How do you mean?”
</p><p>“I want to know not, of course, if you are empowered to settle this
business here and now, but if, in dealing with me, you represent the
views of those who know the business and who are qualified to settle
it.”
</p><p>“Yes,” declared Prasville, forcibly.
</p><p>“So that I can have your answer within an hour after I have told you my
conditions?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Will the answer be that of the government?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>Clarisse bent forward and, sinking her voice:
</p><p>“Will the answer be that of the Elysee?”
</p><p>Prasville appeared surprised. He reflected for a moment and then said:
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“It only remains for me to ask you to give me your word of honour that,
however incomprehensible my conditions may appear to you, you will not
insist on my revealing the reason. They are what they are. Your answer
must be yes or no.”
</p><p>“I give you my word of honour,” said Prasville, formally.
</p><p>Clarisse underwent a momentary agitation that made her turn paler still.
Then, mastering herself, with her eyes fixed on Prasville’s eyes, she
said:
</p><p>“You shall have the list of the Twenty-seven in exchange for the pardon
of Gilbert and Vaucheray.”
</p><p>“Eh? What?”
</p><p>Prasville leapt from his chair, looking absolutely dumbfounded:
</p><p>“The pardon of Gilbert and Vaucheray? Of Arsene Lupin’s accomplices?”
</p><p>“Yes,” she said.
</p><p>“The murderers of the Villa Marie-Therese? The two who are due to die
to-morrow?”
</p><p>“Yes, those two,” she said, in a loud voice. “I ask? I demand their
pardon.”
</p><p>“But this is madness! Why? Why should you?”
</p><p>“I must remind you, Prasville, that you gave me your word...”
</p><p>“Yes... yes... I know... But the thing is so unexpected...”
</p><p>“Why?”
</p><p>“Why? For all sorts of reasons!”
</p><p>“What reasons?”
</p><p>“Well... well, but... think! Gilbert and Vaucheray have been sentenced
to death!”
</p><p>“Send them to penal servitude: that’s all you have to do.”
</p><p>“Impossible! The case has created an enormous sensation. They are Arsene
Lupin’s accomplices. The whole world knows about the verdict.”
</p><p>“Well?”
</p><p>“Well, we cannot, no, we cannot go against the decrees of justice.”
</p><p>“You are not asked to do that. You are asked for a commutation of
punishment as an act of mercy. Mercy is a legal thing.”
</p><p>“The pardoning-commission has given its finding...”
</p><p>“True, but there remains the president of the Republic.”
</p><p>“He has refused.”
</p><p>“He can reconsider his refusal.”
</p><p>“Impossible!”
</p><p>“Why?”
</p><p>“There’s no excuse for it.”
</p><p>“He needs no excuse. The right of mercy is absolute. It is exercised
without control, without reason, without excuse or explanation. It is a
royal prerogative; the president of the Republic can wield it according
to his good pleasure, or rather according to his conscience, in the best
interests of the State.”
</p><p>“But it is too late! Everything is ready. The execution is to take place
in a few hours.”
</p><p>“One hour is long enough to obtain your answer; you have just told us
so.”
</p><p>“But this is confounded madness! There are insuperable obstacles to your
conditions. I tell you again, it’s impossible, physically impossible.”
</p><p>“Then the answer is no?”
</p><p>“No! No! A thousand times no!”
</p><p>“In that case, there is nothing left for us to do but to go.”
</p><p>She moved toward the door. M. Nicole followed her. Prasville bounded
across the room and barred their way:
</p><p>“Where are you going?”
</p><p>“Well, my friend, it seems to me that our conversation is at an end. As
you appear to think, as, in fact, you are certain that the president of
the Republic will not consider the famous list of the Twenty-seven to be
worth...”
</p><p>“Stay where you are,” said Prasville.
</p><p>He turned the key in the door and began to pace the room, with his hands
behind his back and his eyes fixed on the floor.
</p><p>And Lupin, who had not breathed a word during the whole of this scene
and who had prudently contented himself with playing a colourless part,
said to himself:
</p><p>“What a fuss! What a lot of affectation to arrive at the inevitable
result! As though Prasville, who is not a genius, but not an absolute
blockhead either, would be likely to lose the chance of revenging
himself on his mortal enemy! There, what did I say? The idea of hurling
Daubrecq into the bottomless pit appeals to him. Come, we’ve won the
rubber.”
</p><p>Prasville was opening a small inner door which led to the office of his
private secretary.
</p><p>He gave an order aloud:
</p><p>“M. Lartigue, telephone to the Elysee and say that I request the favour
of an audience for a communication of the utmost importance.”
</p><p>He closed the door, came back to Clarisse and said:
</p><p>“In any case, my intervention is limited to submitting your proposal.”
</p><p>“Once you submit it, it will be accepted.”
</p><p>A long silence followed. Clarisse’s features expressed so profound a
delight that Prasville was struck by it and looked at her with attentive
curiosity. For what mysterious reason did Clarisse wish to save Gilbert
and Vaucheray? What was the incomprehensible link that bound her to
those two men? What tragedy connected those three lives and, no doubt,
Daubrecq’s in addition?
</p><p>“Go ahead, old boy,” thought Lupin, “cudgel your brains: you’ll never
spot it! Ah, if we had asked for Gilbert’s pardon only, as Clarisse
wished, you might have twigged the secret! But Vaucheray, that brute of
a Vaucheray, there really could not be the least bond between Mme. Mergy
and him.... Aha, by Jingo, it’s my turn now!... He’s watching me ... The
inward soliloquy is turning upon myself... ‘I wonder who that M. Nicole
can be? Why has that little provincial usher devoted himself body and
soul to Clarisse Mergy? Who is that old bore, if the truth were known? I
made a mistake in not inquiring... I must look into this.... I must
rip off the beggar’s mask. For, after all, it’s not natural that a man
should take so much trouble about a matter in which he is not directly
interested. Why should he also wish to save Gilbert and Vaucheray?
Why? Why should he?...” Lupin turned his head away. “Look out!... Look
out!... There’s a notion passing through that red-tape-merchant’s skull:
a confused notion which he can’t put into words. Hang it all, he mustn’t
suspect M. Lupin under M. Nicole! The thing’s complicated enough as it
is, in all conscience!...”
</p><p>But there was a welcome interruption. Prasville’s secretary came to say
that the audience would take place in an hour’s time.
</p><p>“Very well. Thank you,” said Prasville. “That will do.”
</p><p>And, resuming the interview, with no further circumlocution, speaking
like a man who means to put a thing through, he declared:
</p><p>“I think that we shall be able to manage it. But, first of all, so that
I may do what I have undertaken to do, I want more precise information,
fuller details. Where was the paper?”
</p><p>“In the crystal stopper, as we thought,” said Mme. Mergy.
</p><p>“And where was the crystal stopper?”
</p><p>“In an object which Daubrecq came and fetched, a few days ago, from the
writing-desk in his study in the Square Lamartine, an object which I
took from him yesterday.”
</p><p>“What sort of object?”
</p><p>“Simply a packet of tobacco, Maryland tobacco, which used to lie about
on the desk.”
</p><p>Prasville was petrified. He muttered, guilelessly:
</p><p>“Oh, if I had only known! I’ve had my hand on that packet of Maryland a
dozen times! How stupid of me!”
</p><p>“What does it matter?” said Clarisse. “The great thing is that the
discovery is made.”
</p><p>Prasville pulled a face which implied that the discovery would have been
much pleasanter if he himself had made it. Then he asked:
</p><p>“So you have the list?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Show it to me.”
</p><p>And, when Clarisse hesitated, he added:
</p><p>“Oh, please, don’t be afraid! The list belongs to you, and I will give
it back to you. But you must understand that I cannot take the step in
question without making certain.”
</p><p>Clarisse consulted M. Nicole with a glance which did not escape
Prasville. Then she said:
</p><p>“Here it is.”
</p><p>He seized the scrap of paper with a certain excitement, examined it and
almost immediately said:
</p><p>“Yes, yes... the secretary’s writing: I recognize it.... And the
signature of the chairman of the company: the signature in red....
Besides, I have other proofs.... For instance, the torn piece which
completes the left-hand top corner of this sheet...”
</p><p>He opened his safe and, from a special cash-box, produced a tiny piece
of paper which he put against the top left corner:
</p><p>“That’s right. The torn edges fit exactly. The proof is undeniable. All
that remains is to verify the make of this foreign-post-paper.”
</p><p>Clarisse was radiant with delight. No one would have believed that the
most terrible torture had racked her for weeks and weeks and that she
was still bleeding and quivering from its effects.
</p><p>While Prasville was holding the paper against a window-pane, she said to
Lupin:
</p><p>“I insist upon having Gilbert informed this evening. He must be so
awfully unhappy!”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Lupin. “Besides, you can go to his lawyer and tell him.”
</p><p>She continued:
</p><p>“And then I must see Gilbert to-morrow. Prasville can think what he
likes.”
</p><p>“Of course. But he must first gain his cause at the Elysee.”
</p><p>“There can’t be any difficulty, can there?”
</p><p>“No. You saw that he gave way at once.”
</p><p>Prasville continued his examination with the aid of a magnifying-glass
and compared the sheet with the scrap of torn paper. Next, he took from
the cash-box some other sheets of letter-paper and examined one of these
by holding it up to the light:
</p><p>“That’s done,” he said. “My mind is made up. Forgive me, dear friend: it
was a very difficult piece of work.... I passed through various stages.
When all is said, I had my suspicions... and not without cause...”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked Clarisse.
</p><p>“One second.... I must give an order first.”
</p><p>He called his secretary:
</p><p>“Please telephone at once to the Elysee, make my apologies and say
that I shall not require the audience, for reasons which I will explain
later.”
</p><p>He closed the door and returned to his desk. Clarisse and Lupin stood
choking, looking at him in stupefaction, failing to understand this
sudden change. Was he mad? Was it a trick on his part? A breach of
faith? And was he refusing to keep his promise, now that he possessed
the list?
</p><p>He held it out to Clarisse:
</p><p>“You can have it back.”
</p><p>“Have it back?”
</p><p>“And return it to Daubrecq.”
</p><p>“To Daubrecq?”
</p><p>“Unless you prefer to burn it.”
</p><p>“What do you say?”
</p><p>“I say that, if I were in your place, I would burn it.”
</p><p>“Why do you say that? It’s ridiculous!”
</p><p>“On the contrary, it is very sensible.”
</p><p>“But why? Why?”
</p><p>“Why? I will tell you. The list of the Twenty-seven, as we know for
absolutely certain, was written on a sheet of letter-paper belonging to
the chairman of the Canal Company, of which there are a few samples in
this cash-box. Now all these samples have as a water-mark a little cross
of Lorraine which is almost invisible, but which can just be seen in the
thickness of the paper when you hold it up to the light. The sheet which
you have brought me does not contain that little cross of Lorraine.” [*]
</p><ul>
  <li>The Cross of Lorraine is a cross with two horizontal lines
     or bars across the upper half of the perpendicular beam.

<p>Lupin felt a nervous trembling shake him from head to foot and he dared
not turn his eyes on Clarisse, realizing what a terrible blow this was
to her. He heard her stammer:
</p><p>“Then are we to suppose... that Daubrecq was taken in?”
</p><p>“Not a bit of it!” exclaimed Prasville. “It is you who have been taken
in, my poor friend. Daubrecq has the real list, the list which he stole
from the dying man’s safe.”
</p><p>“But this one...”
</p><p>“This one is a forgery.”
</p><p>“A forgery?”
</p><p>“An undoubted forgery. It was an admirable piece of cunning on
Daubrecq’s part. Dazzled by the crystal stopper which he flashed before
your eyes, you did nothing but look for that stopper in which he had
stowed away no matter what, the first bit of paper that came to hand,
while he quietly kept...”
</p><p>Prasville interrupted himself. Clarisse was walking up to him with
short, stiff steps, like an automaton. She said:
</p><p>“Then...”
</p><p>“Then what, dear friend?”
</p><p>“You refuse?”
</p><p>“Certainly, I am obliged to; I have no choice.”
</p><p>“You refuse to take that step?”
</p><p>“Look here, how can I do what you ask? It’s not possible, on the
strength of a valueless document...”
</p><p>“You won’t do it?... You won’t do it?... And, to-morrow morning... in a
few hours... Gilbert...”
</p><p>She was frightfully pale, her face sunk, like the face of one dying. Her
eyes opened wider and wider and her teeth chattered...
</p><p>Lupin, fearing the useless and dangerous words which she was about to
utter, seized her by the shoulders and tried to drag her away. But she
thrust him back with indomitable strength, took two or three more steps,
staggered, as though on the point of falling, and, suddenly, in a burst
of energy and despair, laid hold of Prasville and screamed:
</p><p>“You shall go to the Elysee!... You shall go at once!... You must!...
You must save Gilbert!”
</p><p>“Please, please, my dear friend, calm yourself...”
</p><p>She gave a strident laugh:
</p><p>“Calm myself!... When, to-morrow morning, Gilbert... Ah, no, no, I am
terrified... it’s appalling.... Oh, run, you wretch, run! Obtain his
pardon!... Don’t you understand? Gilbert... Gilbert is my son! My son!
My son!”
</p><p>Prasville gave a cry. The blade of a knife flashed in Clarisse’s hand
and she raised her arm to strike herself. But the movement was not
completed. M. Nicole caught her arm in its descent and, taking the knife
from Clarisse, reducing her to helplessness, he said, in a voice that
rang through the room like steel:
</p><p>“What you are doing is madness!... When I gave you my oath that I would
save him! You must... live for him... Gilbert shall not die.... How can
he die, when... I gave you my oath?...”
</p><p>“Gilbert... my son...” moaned Clarisse.
</p><p>He clasped her fiercely, drew her against himself and put his hand over
her mouth:
</p><p>“Enough! Be quiet!... I entreat you to be quiet.... Gilbert shall not
die...”
</p><p>With irresistible authority, he dragged her away like a subdued child
that suddenly becomes obedient; but, at the moment of opening the door,
he turned to Prasville:
</p><p>“Wait for me here, monsieur,” he commanded, in an imperative tone. “If
you care about that list of the Twenty-seven, the real list, wait for
me. I shall be back in an hour, in two hours, at most; and then we will
talk business.”
</p><p>And abruptly, to Clarisse:
</p><p>“And you, madame, a little courage yet. I command you to show courage,
in Gilbert’s name.”
</p><p>He went away, through the passages, down the stairs, with a jerky step,
holding Clarisse under the arm, as he might have held a lay-figure,
supporting her, carrying her almost. A court-yard, another court-yard,
then the street.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Prasville, surprised at first, bewildered by the course of
events, was gradually recovering his composure and thinking. He thought
of that M. Nicole, a mere supernumerary at first, who played beside
Clarisse the part of one of those advisers to whom we cling in the
serious crises of our lives and who suddenly, shaking off his torpor,
appeared in the full light of day, resolute, masterful, mettlesome,
brimming over with daring, ready to overthrow all the obstacles that
fate placed on his path.
</p><p>Who was there that was capable of acting thus?
</p><p>Prasville started. The question had no sooner occurred to his mind than
the answer flashed on him, with absolute certainty. All the proofs rose
up, each more exact, each more convincing than the last.
</p><p>Hurriedly he rang. Hurriedly he sent for the chief detective-inspector
on duty. And, feverishly:
</p><p>“Were you in the waiting-room, chief-inspector?”
</p><p>“Yes, monsieur le secretaire-general.”
</p><p>“Did you see a gentleman and a lady go out?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Would you know the man again?”
</p><p>“Yes.”
</p><p>“Then don’t lose a moment, chief-inspector. Take six inspectors with
you. Go to the Place de Clichy. Make inquiries about a man called Nicole
and watch the house. The Nicole man is on his way back there.”
</p><p>“And if he comes out, monsieur le secretaire-general?”
</p><p>“Arrest him. Here’s a warrant.”
</p><p>He sat down to his desk and wrote a name on a form:
</p><p>“Here you are, chief-inspector. I will let the chief-detective know.”
</p><p>The chief-inspector seemed staggered:
</p><p>“But you spoke to me of a man called Nicole, monsieur le
secretaire-general.”
</p><p>“Well?”
</p><p>“The warrant is in the name of Arsene Lupin.”
</p><p>“Arsene Lupin and the Nicole man are one and the same individual.”
