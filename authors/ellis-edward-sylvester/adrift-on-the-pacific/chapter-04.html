<p>"Mend a broken shaft?" repeated the chief engineer, in amazement.
"How do you expect to do that?"</p>

<p>"I will show you," replied the mate of the little schooner, who
immediately proceeded to business.</p>

<p>The first thing he asked for was several coils of wire, which
were immediately furnished him. Then, with great labor, the two
parts of the shaft were fitted together and the wire was twisted
tightly around the fractured portion over and over again.</p>

<p>As the tenacity of iron is tremendous, the shaft was securely
fastened, but this was not enough. Ropes and chains were bound
around the iron in turn, until there was really no room to bandage
the broken shaft further.</p>

<p>"There, sir!" exclaimed Storms, as he stepped back and viewed
his work. "That is as secure as before, though, if you can possibly
do so, you should avoid reversing the screw until you reach Tokio,
for you can understand that to reverse and start will wrench the
shaft to a dangerous degree."</p>

<p>The captain now told the engineer, who had been assisting in
the operation, to start the engine slowly and with great care.</p>

<p>Captain Bergen ran on deck to see that the <em>Coral</em> was
in position to receive no harm from the forward motion, while
the rest of the group watched the movements with intense interest,
standing away from the shaft so as to escape the "splinters,"
that more than one thought might be flying about their heads the
next minute.</p>

<p>There came the sound of steam, of plunging rods and cylinders
from ahead, then there was heard a furious splash at the stern,
and all saw that the shaft in its entirety was revolving.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of Abe Storms, who had leaned directly over his
handiwork, lamp in hand, his nose almost touching the gleaming
chains, detected the very yielding which he had prophesied. He
heard the creaking of the chains, the faint gasping, as it may
be called, of the rope, and the soft grinding of the fine wire
beneath.</p>

<p>All this showed what an enormous strain was brought upon them,
and almost any other person detecting the rasping of the ragged
edges of iron against each other would have started back appalled,
believing that everything was about to fly apart. But it was precisely
what the mate expected, and what was inevitable under the circumstances.
Then, at his request, the engineer was ordered to put on a full
head of steam, and the <em>Polynesia</em> plowed forward, cleaving
the water before her.</p>

<p>Abe Storms knelt down and bent almost lovingly over the round
mass revolving on its axis. Then he beckoned to the engineer to
approach and do the same. He obeyed, as did several others, and
placing their ears close, they listened intently to the revolution
of the shaft.</p>

<p>Not even the faintest noise could be detected to show that there
was anything but a normal movement of the shaft. Every one saw,
too, that the revolutions were not only going on regularly, but
would continue so for an indefinite time. The shaft was practically
whole again, with the exception that a reverse movement would
be likely to undo everything, and by scraping the corrugated surfaces
of the fractures, render it impossible to do anything of the kind
again.</p>

<p>Captain Strathmore and his officers stood for a full hour more
steadily watching the revolving shaft, and at the end of that
time they were satisfied. Then the new acquaintances saluted and
bade each other good-by, the officers of the <em>Coral</em> passing
over the rail, and were rowed back to their own vessel, which
had followed in the wake of the steamer, as may be said.</p>

<p>By this time it was midnight, and the captain returned to his
station on the bridge, reflecting to himself that some of the
most insurmountable difficulties, apparently, are overcome by
the simplest means, and that there are some persons in the world
who really seem capable of inventing anything.</p>

<p>The hour was so late that all the passengers had retired, and
little Inez, as a matter of course, had become invisible long
before. She had declared several times that she was going to sit
up with the captain, and she tried it, but, like most children
under such circumstances, she dropped off into slumber by the
time it was fairly dark, and was carried below to the cabin.</p>

<p>The child was like so much sunshine flitting hither and thither
upon the steamer, and whose presence would be sorely missed when
the hour came for her to go. But Captain Strathmore was a disciplinarian,
who could never forget his duty, and he remained at his post until
the time came for him to go below to gain the few hours' sleep
which cannot be safely dispensed with by any one, no matter how
rugged his frame.</p>

<p>Tumbling into his berth, he stretched out with a sigh of comfort,
and went to sleep.</p>

<p>"Inez will be in here bright and early to wake me," was his conclusion,
as he closed his eyes in slumber.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed, for when he was called from his couch,
it was not by the little one whom he expected to see. At the breakfast-table
she did not appear, and then Captain Strathmore, fearing that
she was ill, made inquiries. He heard nothing, and filled with
a growing alarm, he instituted a thorough search of the vessel
from stem to stern and high and low. Not a spot or corner was
omitted where a cat could have been concealed, but she was not
found.</p>

<p>And then the startling truth was established that little Inez
Hawthorne was not on board the steamer.</p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned poor Captain Strathmore, "she became my own child!
Now I have lost her a second time!"</p>
