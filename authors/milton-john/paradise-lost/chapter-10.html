 <BR>
Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood <BR>
Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above <BR>
Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd <BR>
The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh <BR>
Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd <BR>
Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer <BR>
Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight <BR>
Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port <BR>
Not of mean suiters, nor important less <BR>
Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair <BR>
In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, <BR>
DEUCALION and chaste PYRRHA to restore <BR>
The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine <BR>
Of THEMIS stood devout.  To Heav'n thir prayers <BR>
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes <BR>
Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd <BR>
Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad <BR>
With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd, <BR>
By thir great Intercessor, came in sight <BR>
Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son <BR>
Presenting, thus to intercede began. <BR>
<BR>
  See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung <BR>
From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs <BR>
And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt <BR>
With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, <BR>
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed <BR>
Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those <BR>
Which his own hand manuring all the Trees <BR>
Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n <BR>
From innocence.  Now therefore bend thine eare <BR>
To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; <BR>
Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee <BR>
Interpret for him, mee his Advocate <BR>
And propitiation, all his works on mee <BR>
Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those <BR>
Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. <BR>
Accept me, and in mee from these receave <BR>
The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live <BR>
Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days <BR>
Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I <BR>
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) <BR>
To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee <BR>
All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, <BR>
Made one with me as I with thee am one. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. <BR>
All thy request for Man, accepted Son, <BR>
Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: <BR>
But longer in that Paradise to dwell, <BR>
The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: <BR>
Those pure immortal Elements that know <BR>
No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, <BR>
Eject him tainted now, and purge him off <BR>
As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, <BR>
And mortal food, as may dispose him best <BR>
For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first <BR>
Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt <BR>
Corrupted.  I at first with two fair gifts <BR>
Created him endowd, with Happiness <BR>
And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, <BR>
This other serv'd but to eternize woe; <BR>
Till I provided Death; so Death becomes <BR>
His final remedie, and after Life <BR>
Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd <BR>
By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, <BR>
Wak't in the renovation of the just, <BR>
Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd. <BR>
But let us call to Synod all the Blest <BR>
Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide <BR>
My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, <BR>
As how with peccant Angels late they saw; <BR>
And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. <BR>
<BR>
  He ended, and the Son gave signal high <BR>
To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew <BR>
His Trumpet, heard in OREB since perhaps <BR>
When God descended, and perhaps once more <BR>
To sound at general Doom.  Th' Angelic blast <BR>
Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs <BR>
Of AMARANTIN Shade, Fountain or Spring, <BR>
By the waters of Life, where ere they sate <BR>
In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light <BR>
Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, <BR>
And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream <BR>
Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will. <BR>
<BR>
  O Sons, like one of us Man is become <BR>
To know both Good and Evil, since his taste <BR>
Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast <BR>
His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, <BR>
Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known <BR>
Good by it self, and Evil not at all. <BR>
He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, <BR>
My motions in him, longer then they move, <BR>
His heart I know, how variable and vain <BR>
Self-left.  Least therefore his now bolder hand <BR>
Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, <BR>
And live for ever, dream at least to live <BR>
Forever, to remove him I decree, <BR>
And send him from the Garden forth to Till <BR>
The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. <BR>
<BR>
  MICHAEL, this my behest have thou in charge, <BR>
Take to thee from among the Cherubim <BR>
Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend <BR>
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade <BR>
Vacant possession som new trouble raise: <BR>
Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God <BR>
Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, <BR>
From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce <BR>
To them and to thir Progenie from thence <BR>
Perpetual banishment.  Yet least they faint <BR>
At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd, <BR>
For I behold them soft'nd and with tears <BR>
Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. <BR>
If patiently thy bidding they obey, <BR>
Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale <BR>
To ADAM what shall come in future dayes, <BR>
As I shall thee enlighten, intermix <BR>
My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd; <BR>
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: <BR>
And on the East side of the Garden place, <BR>
Where entrance up from EDEN easiest climbes, <BR>
Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame <BR>
Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, <BR>
And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: <BR>
Least Paradise a receptacle prove <BR>
To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, <BR>
With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude. <BR>
<BR>
  He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd <BR>
For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright <BR>
Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each <BR>
Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape <BR>
Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those <BR>
Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze, <BR>
Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed <BR>
Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod.  Meanwhile <BR>
To resalute the World with sacred Light <BR>
LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd <BR>
The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE <BR>
Had ended now thir Orisons, and found, <BR>
Strength added from above, new hope to spring <BR>
Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; <BR>
Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd. <BR>
<BR>
  EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all <BR>
The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends <BR>
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n <BR>
So prevalent as to concerne the mind <BR>
Of God high blest, or to incline his will, <BR>
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, <BR>
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne <BR>
Ev'n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught <BR>
By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease, <BR>
Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart, <BR>
Methought I saw him placable and mild, <BR>
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew <BR>
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd <BR>
Home to my brest, and to my memorie <BR>
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; <BR>
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now <BR>
Assures me that the bitterness of death <BR>
Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee, <BR>
EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind, <BR>
Mother of all things living, since by thee <BR>
Man is to live, and all things live for Man. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek. <BR>
Ill worthie I such title should belong <BR>
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind <BR>
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach <BR>
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: <BR>
But infinite in pardon was my Judge, <BR>
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't <BR>
The sourse of life; next favourable thou, <BR>
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't, <BR>
Farr other name deserving.  But the Field <BR>
To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd, <BR>
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, <BR>
All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins <BR>
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, <BR>
I never from thy side henceforth to stray, <BR>
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind <BR>
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, <BR>
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? <BR>
Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate <BR>
Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest <BR>
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd <BR>
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight <BR>
The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour, <BR>
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: <BR>
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, <BR>
First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace, <BR>
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; <BR>
Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. <BR>
ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase <BR>
Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  O EVE, some furder change awaits us nigh, <BR>
Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews <BR>
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn <BR>
Us haply too secure of our discharge <BR>
From penaltie, because from death releast <BR>
Some days; how long, and what till then our life, <BR>
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, <BR>
And thither must return and be no more. <BR>
VVhy else this double object in our sight <BR>
Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground <BR>
One way the self-same hour? why in the East <BR>
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light <BR>
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws <BR>
O're the blew Firmament a radiant white, <BR>
And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught. <BR>
<BR>
  He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands <BR>
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now <BR>
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, <BR>
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt <BR>
And carnal fear that day dimm'd ADAMS eye. <BR>
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met <BR>
JACOB in MAHANAIM, where he saw <BR>
The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright; <BR>
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd <BR>
In DOTHAN, cover'd with a Camp of Fire, <BR>
Against the SYRIAN King, who to surprize <BR>
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, <BR>
Warr unproclam'd.  The Princely Hierarch <BR>
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise <BR>
Possession of the Garden; hee alone, <BR>
To finde where ADAM shelterd, took his way, <BR>
Not unperceav'd of ADAM, who to EVE, <BR>
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. <BR>
<BR>
  EVE, now expect great tidings, which perhaps <BR>
Of us will soon determin, or impose <BR>
New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie <BR>
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill <BR>
One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate <BR>
None of the meanest, some great Potentate <BR>
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie <BR>
Invests him coming; yet not terrible, <BR>
That I should fear, nor sociably mild, <BR>
As RAPHAEL, that I should much confide, <BR>
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, <BR>
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. <BR>
He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, <BR>
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man <BR>
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes <BR>
A militarie Vest of purple flowd <BR>
Livelier then MELIBOEAN, or the graine <BR>
Of SARRA, worn by Kings and Hero's old <BR>
In time of Truce; IRIS had dipt the wooff; <BR>
His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime <BR>
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side <BR>
As in a glistering ZODIAC hung the Sword, <BR>
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. <BR>
ADAM bowd low, hee Kingly from his State <BR>
Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd. <BR>
<BR>
  ADAM, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs: <BR>
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, <BR>
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, <BR>
Defeated of his seisure many dayes <BR>
Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent, <BR>
And one bad act with many deeds well done <BR>
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd <BR>
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes; <BR>
But longer in this Paradise to dwell <BR>
Permits not; to remove thee I am come, <BR>
And send thee from the Garden forth to till <BR>
The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile. <BR>
<BR>
  He added not, for ADAM at the newes <BR>
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, <BR>
That all his senses bound; EVE, who unseen <BR>
Yet all had heard, with audible lament <BR>
Discover'd soon the place of her retire. <BR>
<BR>
  O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! <BR>
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave <BR>
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, <BR>
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, <BR>
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day <BR>
That must be mortal to us both.  O flours, <BR>
That never will in other Climate grow, <BR>
My early visitation, and my last <BR>
At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand <BR>
From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names, <BR>
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke <BR>
Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount? <BR>
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd <BR>
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee <BR>
How shall I part, and whither wander down <BR>
Into a lower World, to this obscure <BR>
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire <BR>
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? <BR>
<BR>
  Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. <BR>
Lament not EVE, but patiently resigne <BR>
What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, <BR>
Thus over fond, on that which is not thine; <BR>
Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes <BR>
Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; <BR>
Where he abides, think there thy native soile. <BR>
<BR>
  ADAM by this from the cold sudden damp <BR>
Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, <BR>
To MICHAEL thus his humble words addressd. <BR>
<BR>
  Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd <BR>
Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem <BR>
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould <BR>
Thy message, which might else in telling wound, <BR>
And in performing end us; what besides <BR>
Of sorrow and dejection and despair <BR>
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, <BR>
Departure from this happy place, our sweet <BR>
Recess, and onely consolation left <BR>
Familiar to our eyes, all places else <BR>
Inhospitable appeer and desolate, <BR>
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer <BR>
Incessant I could hope to change the will <BR>
Of him who all things can, I would not cease <BR>
To wearie him with my assiduous cries: <BR>
But prayer against his absolute Decree <BR>
No more availes then breath against the winde, <BR>
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: <BR>
Therefore to his great bidding I submit. <BR>
This most afflicts me, that departing hence, <BR>
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd <BR>
His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent, <BR>
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd <BR>
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; <BR>
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree <BR>
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice <BR>
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd: <BR>
So many grateful Altars I would reare <BR>
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone <BR>
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, <BR>
Or monument to Ages, and thereon <BR>
Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours: <BR>
In yonder nether World where shall I seek <BR>
His bright appearances, or footstep trace? <BR>
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd <BR>
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now <BR>
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts <BR>
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL with regard benigne. <BR>
ADAM, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth <BR>
Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills <BR>
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, <BR>
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: <BR>
All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, <BR>
No despicable gift; surmise not then <BR>
His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd <BR>
Of Paradise or EDEN: this had been <BR>
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred <BR>
All generations, and had hither come <BR>
From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate <BR>
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. <BR>
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down <BR>
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: <BR>
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine <BR>
God is as here, and will be found alike <BR>
Present, and of his presence many a signe <BR>
Still following thee, still compassing thee round <BR>
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face <BR>
Express, and of his steps the track Divine. <BR>
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd, <BR>
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent <BR>
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes <BR>
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad <BR>
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending <BR>
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn <BR>
True patience, and to temper joy with fear <BR>
And pious sorrow, equally enur'd <BR>
By moderation either state to beare, <BR>
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead <BR>
Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure <BR>
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend <BR>
This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes) <BR>
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st, <BR>
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd. <BR>
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path <BR>
Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit, <BR>
However chast'ning, to the evil turne <BR>
My obvious breast, arming to overcom <BR>
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, <BR>
If so I may attain.  So both ascend <BR>
In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill <BR>
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top <BR>
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken <BR>
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay. <BR>
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, <BR>
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set <BR>
Our second ADAM in the Wilderness, <BR>
To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. <BR>
His Eye might there command wherever stood <BR>
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat <BR>
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls <BR>
Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN <BR>
And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne, <BR>
To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence <BR>
To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL <BR>
Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where <BR>
The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since <BR>
In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR <BR>
In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE, <BR>
TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken <BR>
Th' Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port <BR>
ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings <BR>
MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND, <BR>
And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme <BR>
Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South; <BR>
Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount <BR>
The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS, <BR>
MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN; <BR>
On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway <BR>
The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw <BR>
Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME, <BR>
And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat <BR>
Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil'd <BR>
GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons <BR>
Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights <BR>
MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov'd <BR>
VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight <BR>
Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue <BR>
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; <BR>
And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd. <BR>
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd, <BR>
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, <BR>
That ADAM now enforc't to close his eyes, <BR>
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: <BR>
But him the gentle Angel by the hand <BR>
Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd. <BR>
<BR>
  ADAM, now ope thine eyes, and first behold <BR>
Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought <BR>
In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd <BR>
Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd, <BR>
Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive <BR>
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. <BR>
<BR>
  His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field, <BR>
Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves <BR>
New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; <BR>
Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood <BR>
Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon <BR>
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought <BR>
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, <BR>
Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next <BR>
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock <BR>
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid <BR>
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd, <BR>
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd. <BR>
His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n <BR>
Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame; <BR>
The others not, for his was not sincere; <BR>
Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd, <BR>
Smote him into the Midriff with a stone <BR>
That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale <BR>
Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd. <BR>
Much at that sight was ADAM in his heart <BR>
Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n <BR>
To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd; <BR>
Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? <BR>
<BR>
  T' whom MICHAEL thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd. <BR>
These two are Brethren, ADAM, and to come <BR>
Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain, <BR>
For envie that his Brothers Offering found <BR>
From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact <BR>
Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd <BR>
Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, <BR>
Rowling in dust and gore.  To which our Sire. <BR>
<BR>
  Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! <BR>
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way <BR>
I must return to native dust?  O sight <BR>
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, <BR>
Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Death thou hast seen <BR>
In his first shape on man; but many shapes <BR>
Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead <BR>
To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense <BR>
More terrible at th' entrance then within. <BR>
Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die, <BR>
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more <BR>
In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring <BR>
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew <BR>
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know <BR>
What miserie th' inabstinence of EVE <BR>
Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place <BR>
Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, <BR>
A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid <BR>
Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies <BR>
Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes <BR>
Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, <BR>
Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, <BR>
Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, <BR>
Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums. <BR>
Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair <BR>
Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; <BR>
And over them triumphant Death his Dart <BR>
Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't <BR>
With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. <BR>
Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long <BR>
Drie-ey'd behold?  ADAM could not, but wept, <BR>
Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd <BR>
His best of Man, and gave him up to tears <BR>
A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, <BR>
And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O miserable Mankind, to what fall <BR>
Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd? <BR>
Better end heer unborn.  Why is life giv'n <BR>
To be thus wrested from us? rather why <BR>
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew <BR>
What we receive, would either not accept <BR>
Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down, <BR>
Glad to be so dismist in peace.  Can thus <BR>
Th' Image of God in man created once <BR>
So goodly and erect, though faultie since, <BR>
To such unsightly sufferings be debas't <BR>
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man, <BR>
Retaining still Divine similitude <BR>
In part, from such deformities be free, <BR>
And for his Makers Image sake exempt? <BR>
<BR>
  Thir Makers Image, answerd MICHAEL, then <BR>
Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd <BR>
To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took <BR>
His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice, <BR>
Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE. <BR>
Therefore so abject is thir punishment, <BR>
Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, <BR>
Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't <BR>
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules <BR>
To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they <BR>
Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. <BR>
<BR>
  I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit. <BR>
But is there yet no other way, besides <BR>
These painful passages, how we may come <BR>
To Death, and mix with our connatural dust? <BR>
<BR>
  There is, said MICHAEL, if thou well observe <BR>
The rule of not too much, by temperance taught <BR>
In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence <BR>
Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, <BR>
Till many years over thy head return: <BR>
So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop <BR>
Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease <BR>
Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: <BR>
This is old age; but then thou must outlive <BR>
Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change <BR>
To witherd weak &amp; gray; thy Senses then <BR>
Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, <BR>
To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth <BR>
Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne <BR>
A melancholly damp of cold and dry <BR>
To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume <BR>
The Balme of Life.  To whom our Ancestor. <BR>
<BR>
  Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong <BR>
Life much, bent rather how I may be quit <BR>
Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, <BR>
Which I must keep till my appointed day <BR>
Of rendring up.  MICHAEL to him repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst <BR>
Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n: <BR>
And now prepare thee for another sight. <BR>
<BR>
  He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon <BR>
Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds <BR>
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound <BR>
Of Instruments that made melodious chime <BR>
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd <BR>
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch <BR>
Instinct through all proportions low and high <BR>
Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue. <BR>
In other part stood one who at the Forge <BR>
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass <BR>
Had melted (whether found where casual fire <BR>
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, <BR>
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot <BR>
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream <BR>
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind <BR>
Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd <BR>
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought <BR>
Fulfil or grav'n in mettle.  After these, <BR>
But on the hether side a different sort <BR>
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, <BR>
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise <BR>
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent <BR>
To worship God aright, and know his works <BR>
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve <BR>
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain <BR>
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold <BR>
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay <BR>
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung <BR>
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: <BR>
The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes <BR>
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net <BR>
Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose; <BR>
And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star <BR>
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat <BR>
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke <BR>
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't; <BR>
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. <BR>
Such happy interview and fair event <BR>
Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, <BR>
And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart <BR>
Of ADAM, soon enclin'd to admit delight, <BR>
The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd. <BR>
<BR>
  True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, <BR>
Much better seems this Vision, and more hope <BR>
Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; <BR>
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, <BR>
Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Judg not what is best <BR>
By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, <BR>
Created, as thou art, to nobler end <BR>
Holie and pure, conformitie divine. <BR>
Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents <BR>
Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race <BR>
Who slew his Brother; studious they appere <BR>
Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, <BR>
Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit <BR>
Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none. <BR>
Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; <BR>
For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd <BR>
Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, <BR>
Yet empty of all good wherein consists <BR>
Womans domestic honour and chief praise; <BR>
Bred onely and completed to the taste <BR>
Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance, <BR>
To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. <BR>
To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives <BR>
Religious titl'd them the Sons of God, <BR>
Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame <BR>
Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles <BR>
Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, <BR>
(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which <BR>
The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft. <BR>
O pittie and shame, that they who to live well <BR>
Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread <BR>
Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! <BR>
But still I see the tenor of Mans woe <BR>
Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. <BR>
<BR>
  From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, <BR>
Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place <BR>
By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd. <BR>
But now prepare thee for another Scene. <BR>
<BR>
  He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred <BR>
Before him, Towns, and rural works between, <BR>
Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, <BR>
Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, <BR>
Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; <BR>
Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, <BR>
Single or in Array of Battel rang'd <BR>
Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; <BR>
One way a Band select from forage drives <BR>
A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine <BR>
From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, <BR>
Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, <BR>
Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, <BR>
But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray; <BR>
With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; <BR>
Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies <BR>
With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field <BR>
Deserted: Others to a Citie strong <BR>
Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, <BR>
Assaulting; others from the Wall defend <BR>
With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; <BR>
On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. <BR>
In other part the scepter'd Haralds call <BR>
To Council in the Citie Gates: anon <BR>
Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, <BR>
Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon <BR>
In factious opposition, till at last <BR>
Of middle Age one rising, eminent <BR>
In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, <BR>
Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, <BR>
And Judgement from above: him old and young <BR>
Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands, <BR>
Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence <BR>
Unseen amid the throng: so violence <BR>
Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law <BR>
Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. <BR>
ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide <BR>
Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, <BR>
Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death <BR>
Inhumanly to men, and multiply <BR>
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew <BR>
His Brother; for of whom such massacher <BR>
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? <BR>
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n <BR>
Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product <BR>
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st; <BR>
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves <BR>
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, <BR>
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. <BR>
Such were these Giants, men of high renown; <BR>
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd, <BR>
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd; <BR>
To overcome in Battel, and subdue <BR>
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite <BR>
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch <BR>
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done <BR>
Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours, <BR>
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, <BR>
Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men. <BR>
Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth, <BR>
And what most merits fame in silence hid. <BR>
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst <BR>
The onely righteous in a World perverse, <BR>
And therefore hated, therefore so beset <BR>
With Foes for daring single to be just, <BR>
And utter odious Truth, that God would come <BR>
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High <BR>
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds <BR>
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God <BR>
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, <BR>
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward <BR>
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; <BR>
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. <BR>
<BR>
  He look'd, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang'd; <BR>
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, <BR>
All now was turn'd to jollitie and game, <BR>
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, <BR>
Marrying or prostituting, as befell, <BR>
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire <BR>
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. <BR>
At length a Reverend Sire among them came, <BR>
And of thir doings great dislike declar'd, <BR>
And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft <BR>
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, <BR>
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd <BR>
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls <BR>
In prison under Judgements imminent: <BR>
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd <BR>
Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off; <BR>
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, <BR>
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, <BR>
Measur'd by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth, <BR>
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore <BR>
Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large <BR>
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! <BR>
Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small <BR>
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught <BR>
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons <BR>
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore. <BR>
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings <BR>
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove <BR>
From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie <BR>
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, <BR>
Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie <BR>
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain <BR>
Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth <BR>
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum <BR>
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow <BR>
Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else <BR>
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp <BR>
Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea, <BR>
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces <BR>
Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd <BR>
And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late, <BR>
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't. <BR>
How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold <BR>
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, <BR>
Depopulation; thee another Floud, <BR>
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd, <BR>
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard <BR>
By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, <BR>
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns <BR>
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once; <BR>
And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. <BR>
<BR>
  O Visions ill foreseen! better had I <BR>
Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne <BR>
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot <BR>
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst <BR>
The burd'n of many Ages, on me light <BR>
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth <BR>
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, <BR>
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek <BR>
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall <BR>
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, <BR>
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, <BR>
And hee the future evil shall no less <BR>
In apprehension then in substance feel <BR>
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, <BR>
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't <BR>
Famin and anguish will at last consume <BR>
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope <BR>
When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth, <BR>
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd <BR>
With length of happy days the race of man; <BR>
But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see <BR>
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. <BR>
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, <BR>
And whether here the Race of man will end. <BR>
To whom thus MICHAEL.  Those whom last thou sawst <BR>
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they <BR>
First seen in acts of prowess eminent <BR>
And great exploits, but of true vertu void; <BR>
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste <BR>
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby <BR>
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, <BR>
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, <BR>
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride <BR>
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. <BR>
The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr <BR>
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose <BR>
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd <BR>
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide <BR>
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale <BR>
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, <BR>
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords <BR>
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear <BR>
More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd: <BR>
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd, <BR>
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; <BR>
One Man except, the onely Son of light <BR>
In a dark Age, against example good, <BR>
Against allurement, custom, and a World <BR>
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, <BR>
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes <BR>
Shall them admonish, and before them set <BR>
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, <BR>
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come <BR>
On thir impenitence; and shall returne <BR>
Of them derided, but of God observd <BR>
The one just Man alive; by his command <BR>
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, <BR>
To save himself and houshold from amidst <BR>
A World devote to universal rack. <BR>
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast <BR>
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd, <BR>
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts <BR>
Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre <BR>
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep <BR>
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp <BR>
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise <BR>
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount <BR>
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd <BR>
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, <BR>
With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift <BR>
Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf, <BR>
And there take root an Iland salt and bare, <BR>
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. <BR>
To teach thee that God attributes to place <BR>
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought <BR>
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. <BR>
And now what further shall ensue, behold. <BR>
<BR>
  He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, <BR>
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, <BR>
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie <BR>
Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd; <BR>
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass <BR>
Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, <BR>
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink <BR>
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole <BR>
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt <BR>
His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut. <BR>
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground <BR>
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. <BR>
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; <BR>
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive <BR>
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. <BR>
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, <BR>
And after him, the surer messenger, <BR>
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie <BR>
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; <BR>
The second time returning, in his Bill <BR>
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: <BR>
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke <BR>
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; <BR>
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, <BR>
Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds <BR>
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow <BR>
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay, <BR>
Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new. <BR>
Whereat the heart of ADAM erst so sad <BR>
Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth. <BR>
<BR>
  O thou that future things canst represent <BR>
As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive <BR>
At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live <BR>
With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. <BR>
Farr less I now lament for one whole World <BR>
Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce <BR>
For one Man found so perfet and so just, <BR>
That God voutsafes to raise another World <BR>
From him, and all his anger to forget. <BR>
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, <BR>
Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd, <BR>
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde <BR>
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, <BR>
Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom th' Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim'st; <BR>
So willingly doth God remit his Ire, <BR>
Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd, <BR>
Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw <BR>
The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh <BR>
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd, <BR>
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, <BR>
That he relents, not to blot out mankind, <BR>
And makes a Covenant never to destroy <BR>
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea <BR>
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World <BR>
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings <BR>
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set <BR>
His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look <BR>
And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night, <BR>
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost <BR>
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, <BR>
Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell. <BR>
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; <BR>
And Man as from a second stock proceed. <BR>
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave <BR>
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine <BR>
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: <BR>
Henceforth what is to com I will relate, <BR>
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. <BR>
This second sours of Men, while yet but few, <BR>
And while the dread of judgement past remains <BR>
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, <BR>
With some regard to what is just and right <BR>
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, <BR>
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, <BR>
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, <BR>
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, <BR>
With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast <BR>
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell <BR>
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes <BR>
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise <BR>
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content <BR>
With fair equalitie, fraternal state, <BR>
Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd <BR>
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess <BR>
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; <BR>
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) <BR>
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse <BR>
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: <BR>
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd <BR>
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n, <BR>
Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie; <BR>
And from Rebellion shall derive his name, <BR>
Though of Rebellion others he accuse. <BR>
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns <BR>
With him or under him to tyrannize, <BR>
Marching from EDEN towards the West, shall finde <BR>
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge <BR>
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; <BR>
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build <BR>
A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n; <BR>
And get themselves a name, least far disperst <BR>
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost, <BR>
Regardless whether good or evil fame. <BR>
But God who oft descends to visit men <BR>
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks <BR>
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, <BR>
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower <BR>
Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets <BR>
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase <BR>
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead <BR>
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: <BR>
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud <BR>
Among the Builders; each to other calls <BR>
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, <BR>
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n <BR>
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange <BR>
And hear the din; thus was the building left <BR>
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Whereto thus ADAM fatherly displeas'd. <BR>
O execrable Son so to aspire <BR>
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming <BR>
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n: <BR>
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl <BR>
Dominion absolute; that right we hold <BR>
By his donation; but Man over men <BR>
He made not Lord; such title to himself <BR>
Reserving, human left from human free. <BR>
But this Usurper his encroachment proud <BR>
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends <BR>
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food <BR>
Will he convey up thither to sustain <BR>
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire <BR>
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, <BR>
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Justly thou abhorr'st <BR>
That Son, who on the quiet state of men <BR>
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue <BR>
Rational Libertie; yet know withall, <BR>
Since thy original lapse, true Libertie <BR>
Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells <BR>
Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being: <BR>
Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd, <BR>
Immediately inordinate desires <BR>
And upstart Passions catch the Government <BR>
From Reason, and to servitude reduce <BR>
Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits <BR>
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign <BR>
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just <BR>
Subjects him from without to violent Lords; <BR>
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall <BR>
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, <BR>
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. <BR>
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low <BR>
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, <BR>
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext <BR>
Deprives them of thir outward libertie, <BR>
Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son <BR>
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame <BR>
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, <BR>
SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race. <BR>
Thus will this latter, as the former World, <BR>
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last <BR>
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw <BR>
His presence from among them, and avert <BR>
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth <BR>
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; <BR>
And one peculiar Nation to select <BR>
From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd, <BR>
A Nation from one faithful man to spring: <BR>
Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing, <BR>
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men <BR>
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, <BR>
While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood, <BR>
As to forsake the living God, and fall <BR>
To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone <BR>
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes <BR>
To call by Vision from his Fathers house, <BR>
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land <BR>
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise <BR>
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre <BR>
His benediction so, that in his Seed <BR>
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys, <BR>
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: <BR>
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith <BR>
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile <BR>
UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford <BR>
To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train <BR>
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; <BR>
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth <BR>
With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown. <BR>
CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents <BR>
Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine <BR>
Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves <BR>
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; <BR>
From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South <BR>
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd) <BR>
From HERMON East to the great Western Sea, <BR>
Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold <BR>
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare <BR>
Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream <BR>
JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons <BR>
Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills. <BR>
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth <BR>
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed <BR>
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise <BR>
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon <BR>
Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest, <BR>
Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call, <BR>
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, <BR>
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; <BR>
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs <BR>
From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd <BR>
EGYPT, divided by the River NILE; <BR>
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes <BR>
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land <BR>
He comes invited by a yonger Son <BR>
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds <BR>
Raise him to be the second in that Realme <BR>
Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race <BR>
Growing into a Nation, and now grown <BR>
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks <BR>
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests <BR>
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves <BR>
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: <BR>
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call <BR>
MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime <BR>
His people from enthralment, they return <BR>
With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land. <BR>
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies <BR>
To know thir God, or message to regard, <BR>
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire; <BR>
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, <BR>
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill <BR>
With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land; <BR>
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, <BR>
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, <BR>
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, <BR>
Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie <BR>
And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls; <BR>
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, <BR>
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down <BR>
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: <BR>
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, <BR>
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; <BR>
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born <BR>
Of EGYPT must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds <BR>
This River-dragon tam'd at length submits <BR>
To let his sojourners depart, and oft <BR>
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice <BR>
More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage <BR>
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea <BR>
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass <BR>
As on drie land between two christal walls, <BR>
Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand <BR>
Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar: <BR>
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, <BR>
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe <BR>
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, <BR>
To guide them in thir journey, and remove <BR>
Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues: <BR>
All night he will pursue, but his approach <BR>
Darkness defends between till morning Watch; <BR>
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud <BR>
God looking forth will trouble all his Host <BR>
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command <BR>
MOSES once more his potent Rod extends <BR>
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; <BR>
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, <BR>
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect <BR>
Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance <BR>
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, <BR>
Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd <BR>
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare <BR>
Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather <BR>
Inglorious life with servitude; for life <BR>
To noble and ignoble is more sweet <BR>
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. <BR>
This also shall they gain by thir delay <BR>
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found <BR>
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose <BR>
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: <BR>
God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top <BR>
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself <BR>
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound <BR>
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine <BR>
To civil Justice, part religious Rites <BR>
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types <BR>
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise <BR>
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve <BR>
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God <BR>
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech <BR>
That MOSES might report to them his will, <BR>
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire, <BR>
Instructed that to God is no access <BR>
Without Mediator, whose high Office now <BR>
MOSES in figure beares, to introduce <BR>
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, <BR>
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times <BR>
Of great MESSIAH shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites <BR>
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men <BR>
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes <BR>
Among them to set up his Tabernacle, <BR>
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: <BR>
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd <BR>
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein <BR>
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, <BR>
The Records of his Cov'nant, over these <BR>
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings <BR>
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn <BR>
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing <BR>
The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud <BR>
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night, <BR>
Save when they journie, and at length they come, <BR>
Conducted by his Angel to the Land <BR>
Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest <BR>
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, <BR>
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, <BR>
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still <BR>
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, <BR>
Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand, <BR>
And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON, <BR>
Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third <BR>
From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him <BR>
His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win. <BR>
<BR>
  Here ADAM interpos'd.  O sent from Heav'n, <BR>
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things <BR>
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne <BR>
Just ABRAHAM and his Seed: now first I finde <BR>
Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd, <BR>
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom <BR>
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see <BR>
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, <BR>
Favour unmerited by me, who sought <BR>
Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means. <BR>
This yet I apprehend not, why to those <BR>
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth <BR>
So many and so various Laws are giv'n; <BR>
So many Laws argue so many sins <BR>
Among them; how can God with such reside? <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Doubt not but that sin <BR>
Will reign among them, as of thee begot; <BR>
And therefore was Law given them to evince <BR>
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up <BR>
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see <BR>
Law can discover sin, but not remove, <BR>
Save by those shadowie expiations weak, <BR>
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude <BR>
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, <BR>
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness <BR>
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde <BR>
Justification towards God, and peace <BR>
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies <BR>
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part <BR>
Perform, and not performing cannot live. <BR>
So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n <BR>
With purpose to resign them in full time <BR>
Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd <BR>
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, <BR>
From imposition of strict Laws, to free <BR>
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear <BR>
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. <BR>
And therefore shall not MOSES, though of God <BR>
Highly belov'd, being but the Minister <BR>
Of Law, his people into CANAAN lead; <BR>
But JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call, <BR>
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell <BR>
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back <BR>
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man <BR>
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. <BR>
Meanwhile they in thir earthly CANAAN plac't <BR>
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins <BR>
National interrupt thir public peace, <BR>
Provoking God to raise them enemies: <BR>
From whom as oft he saves them penitent <BR>
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom <BR>
The second, both for pietie renownd <BR>
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive <BR>
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne <BR>
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing <BR>
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock <BR>
Of DAVID (so I name this King) shall rise <BR>
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, <BR>
Foretold to ABRAHAM, as in whom shall trust <BR>
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings <BR>
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. <BR>
But first a long succession must ensue, <BR>
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd, <BR>
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents <BR>
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. <BR>
Such follow him, as shall be registerd <BR>
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, <BR>
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults <BR>
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense <BR>
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, <BR>
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark <BR>
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey <BR>
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st <BR>
Left in confusion, BABYLON thence call'd. <BR>
There in captivitie he lets them dwell <BR>
The space of seventie years, then brings them back, <BR>
Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn <BR>
To DAVID, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n. <BR>
Returnd from BABYLON by leave of Kings <BR>
Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God <BR>
They first re-edifie, and for a while <BR>
In mean estate live moderate, till grown <BR>
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; <BR>
But first among the Priests dissension springs, <BR>
Men who attend the Altar, and should most <BR>
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings <BR>
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise <BR>
The Scepter, and regard not DAVIDS Sons, <BR>
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true <BR>
Anointed King MESSIAH might be born <BR>
Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr <BR>
Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com, <BR>
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire <BR>
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; <BR>
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells <BR>
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; <BR>
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire <BR>
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. <BR>
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire <BR>
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend <BR>
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign <BR>
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns. <BR>
<BR>
  He ceas'd, discerning ADAM with such joy <BR>
Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears, <BR>
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. <BR>
<BR>
  O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher <BR>
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand <BR>
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, <BR>
Why our great expectation should be call'd <BR>
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, <BR>
High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes <BR>
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son <BR>
Of God most High; So God with man unites. <BR>
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise <BR>
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when <BR>
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus MICHAEL.  Dream not of thir fight, <BR>
As of a Duel, or the local wounds <BR>
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son <BR>
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil <BR>
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome <BR>
SATAN, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise, <BR>
Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound: <BR>
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, <BR>
Not by destroying SATAN, but his works <BR>
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, <BR>
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, <BR>
Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd <BR>
On penaltie of death, and suffering death, <BR>
The penaltie to thy transgression due, <BR>
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: <BR>
So onely can high Justice rest appaid. <BR>
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill <BR>
Both by obedience and by love, though love <BR>
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment <BR>
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh <BR>
To a reproachful life and cursed death, <BR>
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe <BR>
In his redemption, and that his obedience <BR>
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits <BR>
To save them, not thir own, though legal works. <BR>
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd, <BR>
Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd <BR>
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross <BR>
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; <BR>
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, <BR>
The Law that is against thee, and the sins <BR>
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd, <BR>
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust <BR>
In this his satisfaction; so he dies, <BR>
But soon revives, Death over him no power <BR>
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light <BR>
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise <BR>
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, <BR>
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, <BR>
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life <BR>
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace <BR>
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act <BR>
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd, <BR>
In sin for ever lost from life; this act <BR>
Shall bruise the head of SATAN, crush his strength <BR>
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, <BR>
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings <BR>
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, <BR>
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, <BR>
A gentle wafting to immortal Life. <BR>
Nor after resurrection shall he stay <BR>
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer <BR>
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life <BR>
Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge <BR>
To teach all nations what of him they learn'd <BR>
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve <BR>
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe <BR>
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life <BR>
Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall, <BR>
For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd. <BR>
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day <BR>
Not onely to the Sons of ABRAHAMS Loines <BR>
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons <BR>
Of ABRAHAMS Faith wherever through the world; <BR>
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. <BR>
Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend <BR>
With victory, triumphing through the aire <BR>
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise <BR>
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines <BR>
Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave; <BR>
Then enter into glory, and resume <BR>
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high <BR>
Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come, <BR>
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe, <BR>
With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead, <BR>
To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward <BR>
His faithful, and receave them into bliss, <BR>
Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth <BR>
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place <BR>
Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake th' Archangel MICHAEL, then paus'd, <BR>
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire <BR>
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd. <BR>
<BR>
  O goodness infinite, goodness immense! <BR>
That all this good of evil shall produce, <BR>
And evil turn to good; more wonderful <BR>
Then that which by creation first brought forth <BR>
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, <BR>
Whether I should repent me now of sin <BR>
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce <BR>
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, <BR>
To God more glory, more good will to Men <BR>
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. <BR>
But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n <BR>
Must reascend, what will betide the few <BR>
His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd, <BR>
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide <BR>
His people, who defend? will they not deale <BR>
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? <BR>
<BR>
  Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n <BR>
Hee to his own a Comforter will send, <BR>
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell <BR>
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith <BR>
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, <BR>
To guide them in all truth, and also arme <BR>
With spiritual Armour, able to resist <BR>
SATANS assaults, and quench his fierie darts <BR>
What Man can do against them, not affraid, <BR>
Though to the death, against such cruelties <BR>
With inward consolations recompenc't, <BR>
And oft supported so as shall amaze <BR>
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit <BR>
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends <BR>
To evangelize the Nations, then on all <BR>
Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue <BR>
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, <BR>
As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win <BR>
Great numbers of each Nation to receave <BR>
With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length <BR>
Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run, <BR>
Thir doctrine and thir story written left, <BR>
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, <BR>
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, <BR>
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n <BR>
To thir own vile advantages shall turne <BR>
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth <BR>
With superstitions and traditions taint, <BR>
Left onely in those written Records pure, <BR>
Though not but by the Spirit understood. <BR>
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, <BR>
Places and titles, and with these to joine <BR>
Secular power, though feigning still to act <BR>
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating <BR>
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n <BR>
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, <BR>
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force <BR>
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde <BR>
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within <BR>
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then <BR>
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde <BR>
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild <BR>
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, <BR>
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth <BR>
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard <BR>
Infallible? yet many will presume: <BR>
Whence heavie persecution shall arise <BR>
On all who in the worship persevere <BR>
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, <BR>
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes <BR>
Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire <BR>
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith <BR>
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, <BR>
To good malignant, to bad men benigne, <BR>
Under her own waight groaning, till the day <BR>
Appeer of respiration to the just, <BR>
And vengeance to the wicked, at return <BR>
Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid, <BR>
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, <BR>
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, <BR>
Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald <BR>
In glory of the Father, to dissolve <BR>
SATAN with his perverted World, then raise <BR>
From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd, <BR>
New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date <BR>
Founded in righteousness and peace and love, <BR>
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. <BR>
<BR>
  He ended; and thus ADAM last reply'd. <BR>
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, <BR>
Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time, <BR>
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, <BR>
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. <BR>
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, <BR>
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill <BR>
Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe; <BR>
Beyond which was my folly to aspire. <BR>
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, <BR>
And love with feare the onely God, to walk <BR>
As in his presence, ever to observe <BR>
His providence, and on him sole depend, <BR>
Merciful over all his works, with good <BR>
Still overcoming evil, and by small <BR>
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak <BR>
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise <BR>
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake <BR>
Is fortitude to highest victorie, <BR>
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; <BR>
Taught this by his example whom I now <BR>
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. <BR>
<BR>
  To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd: <BR>
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe <BR>
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs <BR>
Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers, <BR>
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, <BR>
Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea, <BR>
And all the riches of this World enjoydst, <BR>
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add <BR>
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, <BR>
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, <BR>
By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul <BR>
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath <BR>
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess <BR>
A Paradise within thee, happier farr. <BR>
Let us descend now therefore from this top <BR>
Of Speculation; for the hour precise <BR>
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, <BR>
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect <BR>
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, <BR>
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; <BR>
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; <BR>
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd <BR>
Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd <BR>
To meek submission: thou at season fit <BR>
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, <BR>
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, <BR>
The great deliverance by her Seed to come <BR>
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. <BR>
That ye may live, which will be many dayes, <BR>
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, <BR>
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd <BR>
With meditation on the happie end. <BR>
<BR>
  He ended, and they both descend the Hill; <BR>
Descended, ADAM to the Bowre where EVE <BR>
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't; <BR>
And thus with words not sad she him receav'd. <BR>
<BR>
  Whence thou returnst, &amp; whither wentst, I know; <BR>
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, <BR>
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good <BR>
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress <BR>
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; <BR>
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, <BR>
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, <BR>
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee <BR>
Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou, <BR>
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence. <BR>
This further consolation yet secure <BR>
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, <BR>
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, <BR>
By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore. <BR>
<BR>
  So spake our Mother EVE, and ADAM heard <BR>
VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh <BR>
Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill <BR>
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array <BR>
The Cherubim descended; on the ground <BR>
Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist <BR>
Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides, <BR>
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel <BR>
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc't, <BR>
The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd <BR>
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, <BR>
And vapour as the LIBYAN Air adust, <BR>
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat <BR>
In either hand the hastning Angel caught <BR>
Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate <BR>
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast <BR>
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd. <BR>
They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld <BR>
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, <BR>
Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate <BR>
With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes: <BR>
Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon; <BR>
The World was all before them, where to choose <BR>
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: <BR>
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, <BR>
Through EDEN took thir solitarie way. <BR>
<BR>
     THE END. </article>
