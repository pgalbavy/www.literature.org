"Good morning, Madam," said Hoopdriver, as Jessie came into the
breakfast room of the Golden Pheasant on Monday morning, and he
smiled, bowed, rubbed his hands together, and pulled out a chair
for her, and rubbed his hands again.
<P>
She stopped abruptly, with a puzzled expression on her face.
"Where HAVE I seen that before?" she said.
<P>
"The chair?" said Hoopdriver, flushing.
<P>
"No--the attitude."
<P>
She came forward and shook hands with him, looking the while
curiously into his face. "And--Madam?"
<P>
"It's a habit," said Mr. Hoopdriver, guiltily. "A bad habit.
Calling ladies Madam. You must put it down to our colonial
roughness. Out there up country--y'know--the ladies--so rare--we
call 'em all Madam." 
<P>
"You HAVE some funny habits, brother Chris," said Jessie. "Before
you sell your diamond shares and go into society, as you say, and
stand for Parliament--What a fine thing it is to be a man!--you
must cure yourself. That habit of bowing as you do, and rubbing
your hands, and looking expectant."
<P>
"It's a habit."
<P>
"I know. But I don't think it a good one. You don't mind my
telling you?"
<P>
"Not a bit. I'm grateful."
<P>
"I'm blessed or afflicted with a trick of observation," said
Jessie, looking at the breakfast table. Mr. Hoopdriver put his
hand to his moustache and then, thinking this might be another
habit, checked his arm and stuck his hand into his pocket. He
felt juiced awkward, to use his private formula. Jessie's eye
wandered to the armchair, where a piece of binding was loose,
and, possibly to carry out her theory of an observant
disposition, she turned and asked him for a pin.
<P>
Mr. Hoopdriver's hand fluttered instinctively to his lappel, and
there, planted by habit, were a couple of stray pins he had
impounded.
<P>
"What an odd place to put pins!" exclaimed Jessie, taking it.
<P>
"It's 'andy," said Mr. Hoopdriver. "I saw a chap in a shop do it
once."
<P>
"You must have a careful disposition," she said, over her
shoulder, kneeling down to the chair.
<P>
"In the centre of Africa--up country, that is--one learns to
value pins," said Mr. Hoopdriver, after a perceptible pause.
"There weren't over many pins in Africa. They don't lie about on
the ground there." His face was now in a fine, red glow. Where
would the draper break out next? He thrust his hands into his
coat pockets, then took one out again, furtively removed the
second pin and dropped it behind him gently. It fell with a loud
'ping' on the fender. Happily she made no remark, being
preoccupied with the binding of the chair.
<P>
Mr. Hoopdriver, instead of sitting down, went up to the table and
stood against it, with his finger-tips upon the cloth. They were
keeping breakfast a tremendous time. He took up his rolled
serviette looked closely and scrutinisingly at the ring, then put
his hand under the fold of the napkin and examined the texture,
and put the thing down again. Then he had a vague impulse to
finger his hollow wisdom tooth--happily checked. He suddenly
discovered he was standing as if the table was a counter, and sat
down forthwith. He drummed with his hand on the table. He felt
dreadfully hot and self-conscious.
<P>
"Breakfast is late," said Jessie, standing up. 
<P>
"Isn't it?"
<P>
Conversation was slack. Jessie wanted to know the distance to
Ringwood. Then silence fell again. 
<P>
Mr. Hoopdriver, very uncomfortable and studying an easy bearing,
looked again at the breakfast things and then idly lifted the
corner of the tablecloth on the ends of his fingers, and regarded
it. "Fifteen three," he thought, privately.
<P>
"Why do you do that?" said Jessie.
<P>
"WHAT?" said Hoopdriver, dropping the tablecloth convulsively.
<P>
"Look at the cloth like that. I saw you do it yesterday, too."
<P>
Mr. Hoopdriver's face became quite a bright red. He began pulling
his moustache nervously. "I know," he said. "I know. It's a queer
habit, I know. But out there, you know, there's native servants,
you know, and--it's a queer thing to talk about--but one has to
look at things to see, don't y'know, whether they're quite clean
or not. It's got to be a habit."
<P>
"How odd!" said Jessie.
<P>
"Isn't it?" mumbled Hoopdriver.
<P>
"If I were a Sherlock Holmes," said Jessie, "I suppose I could
have told you were a colonial from little things like that. But
anyhow, I guessed it, didn't I?"
<P>
"Yes," said Hoopdriver, in a melancholy tone, "you guessed it." 
<P>
Why not seize the opportunity for a neat confession, and add,
"unhappily in this case you guessed wrong." Did she suspect?
Then, at the psychological moment, the girl bumped the door open
with her tray and brought in the coffee and scrambled eggs.
<P>
"I am rather lucky with my intuitions, sometimes," said Jessie.
<P>
Remorse that had been accumulating in his mind for two days
surged to the top of his mind. What a shabby liar he was!
<P>
And, besides, he must sooner or later, inevitably, give himself
away.
