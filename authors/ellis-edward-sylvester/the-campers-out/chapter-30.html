<p>It was a shocking sight, and for a minute or two Dick Halliard
and Jim McGovern did not speak.</p>

<p>Tom Wagstaff had been cut off in the beginning of his lawless
career, and his dead body lay at the feet of his former companion
in wrong-doing, with whom he had exchanged coarse jests but a
short while before.</p>

<p>It was as McGovern declared, and as the reader has learned. When
the Piketon Rangers heard the rush of the flood, each broke from
the tent, thinking only of his own safety, which was just as well,
since neither could offer the slightest aid to the others.</p>

<p>We have shown by what an exceedingly narrow chance McGovern eluded
the torrent. But for the hand of Dick Halliard, extended a second
time to save him from drowning, he would have shared the fate
of Wagstaff. The particulars of the latter’s death were never
fully established. He probably fled in the same general direction
as McGovern, without leading or following in his footsteps, since
his body was carried to the same shore upon which McGovern emerged.
His struggles most likely were similar, but, singularly enough,
he knew nothing about swimming, which, after all, could have been
of no benefit to him, and he perished as did the thousands who
went down in the Johnstown flood.</p>

<p>Terry Hurley overheard the exclamation of McGovern, the roar
of the torrent having greatly subsided, and he called out to know
the cause. Dick explained, and the sympathetic Irishman instantly
quelled the disposition to joke that he had felt a short time
before.</p>

<p>The boys were not slow in observing that the water was falling.
When they first laid down the body the current almost touched
their feet. In a short while it was a considerable distance away.</p>

<p>"I believe he was an old friend of yours," said Dick, addressing
his companion, who was deeply affected by the event.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied McGovern; "him and me run away from home together."</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"Because Satan got into us; we both have good homes and kind
parents, but we played truant, stole, fought, and did everything
bad. Bob Budd came down to New York some time ago, and we made
his acquaintance; we were fellows after one another’s heart, and
we took to each other right off. We showed Bob around the city,
and then he made us promise to come out and visit him. It was
his idea to form the Piketon Rangers."</p>

<p>"I don’t know as there was anything wrong in that," said Dick,
who felt for the grief of his companion and was awed by the fate
that had overtaken the others; "camping out is well enough in
its way, and I would do it myself if I had the chance."</p>

<p>"It isn’t that which I mean; it’s the way we have been going
on since we have been together. I daresn’t tell you all the bad
we did, Dick Halliard."</p>

<p>"Never mind; don’t think of it."</p>

<p>"I am going home as soon as I can; this will break up Tom’s folks,
for they thought all the world of him."</p>

<p>"It is bad," said Dick, who saw how idle it was to try to minify
the dreadful incidents; "but sad as it is, it will not be entirely
lost if you do not forget it."</p>

<p>"Forget it!" repeated McGovern, looking reproachfully in his
face; "it will haunt me as long as I live."</p>

<p>"I have been told that people often feel that way when great
sorrow overtakes them; but," added Dick, seeing his companion
was grieved by his words, "I do not believe it will be so with
you."</p>

<p>"I have run away from home before, but I think this was a little
the worst, for my father had everything arranged to send me to
college, and I know his heart is well-nigh broken."</p>

<p>"Not so far but that you can mend it by doing what you say you
mean to do," said Dick, thinking it wise to emphasize the truth
already spoken.</p>

<p>McGovern made no reply, but stood for a minute as if in deep
thought. Dick was watching him closely and saw him look down at
the inanimate form at his feet. He sighed several times, and then
glancing up quickly, said in an eager voice:</p>

<p>"Dick Hilliard, I wish I was like you."</p>

<p>The words sounded strange from one who had been so reckless of
all that was right, but never was an utterance more sincere—it
came directly from the heart.</p>

<p>"Don’t take me for a model, for you can be a great deal better
than I; you tell me you have good parents; all you have to do
is to obey them."</p>

<p>"You seem to doubt my keeping the pledge," said McGovern, looking
with curious fixidity in the countenance of Dick.</p>

<p>"I believe you are in earnest now, but what I fear is that you
have become so accustomed to your wild life that you will forget
this lesson."</p>

<p>"Well," sighed the stricken youth, "that must remain to be tested;
all that I can now do is to ask you to suspend judgment, as they
say."</p>

<p>"You can give me your hand on it, Jim."</p>

<p>It was a strange sight, when the two boys clasped hands on the
bank of the subsiding flood, with the lifeless body at their feet,
and one of them uttered his solemn promise that from that hour
he would strive to follow the right path and shun the wrong one.</p>

<p>But that pledge, uttered years ago, remains unbroken to this
day.</p>

<p>Dick Halliard was thrilled by the scene, which will always remain
vivid in his memory. Despite the sorrowful surroundings a singular
pleasure crept through his being, for conscience whispered that
he had done a good deed in thus exhorting the wayward youth, and
that it was on record in the great book above.</p>

<p>It was not the impressiveness of that silent form that so wrought
upon the feelings of the youths, but the recollection of the missing
one, whose body they believed was whirling about in the fierce
currents of the torrent that was speedily exhausting itself in
the deeper parts of the valley, or perhaps was lodged somewhere
in the lower limbs of a tree, awaiting the morning for the shocked
friends to claim it.</p>

<p>Considerable time had passed since the bursting of the dam, and
the news of the calamity spread rapidly. People began flocking
hither from the neighborhood, and before long there were arrivals
from Piketon itself. These gathered at the scene of destruction
and viewed it with bated breath. Some brought lanterns, but the
broad space where the waters had reposed for so many years was
clearly shown in the moonlight and made a striking sight.</p>

<p>The striking feature about the calamity, which, as we have stated,
was never satisfactorily explained, was that the dam, which looked
strong enough to resist tenfold the pressure, had not yielded
in a single spot, as would be supposed, but had been carried away
almost bodily. That is to say, three-fourths of the structure
was gone, its foundations being on a level with the bottom of
the pond in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most probable explanation of the accident was that
offered by an old fisherman, to the effect that muskrats had burrowed
under and through the dam until it had been so weakened throughout
most of its extent that when a giving way began at one point it
was like knocking the keystone from an arch. Its results resembled
those often shown by the explosion of a steam boiler, when only
a few fragments remain to show what it once has been.</p>

<p>Before long a party reached the place where Dick and Jim were
standing by the dead body of Wagstaff. When it was proposed to
remove it the suggestion was made that it should not be disturbed
until the arrival of the coroner, who could be called by morning
to view the body. This practice, as the reader doubtless knows,
prevails in nearly every portion of the country, and was adopted
in the instance named.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Terry Hurley and his family, perched among the branches
of the trees, were not forgotten. As soon as the waters subsided
sufficiently, parties waded out, and by means of ladders that
were quickly brought, soon placed the homeless ones safely on
<em>terra firma</em>.</p>

<p>The haste of the flight had prevented the couple from doing much
in the way of bringing needed garments, and the children, who
were in their night clothes, suffered considerably. But they were
now in the hands of good friends, who did everything possible.
They were looked after, and it is a pleasure to say that no serious
consequences followed.</p>

<p>Captain Jim Budd, the indulgent uncle of Bob, happened to be
away from Piketon on the night of the great accident, but was
expected back in the morning. Fortunately no one was so thoughtless
as to hasten to Aunt Ruth with the news of her nephew’s death,
and therein she was more favored than most people placed in her
sad situation.</p>

<p>Dick Halliard made his employer his confidant as far as was necessary
concerning Jim McGovern. The good-hearted merchant took hold of
the matter at once.</p>

<p>Having obtained from McGovern the address of Wagstaff’s parents,
word was telegraphed them and their wishes asked as to the disposition
of their son’s remains. The father appeared that afternoon, and
with the permission of the coroner took charge of them.</p>

<p>Mr. Wagstaff proved to be a man of good sense and judgment. He
told Mr. Hunter that his life purpose had been to educate and
bring up his five children, with every advantage they could require.
He and his wife had set their hearts on preparing Jim for the
ministry, but his wayward tendencies developed at an early age.
He was the only one of the family to cause the parents anxiety,
and he brought them enough sorrow for all.</p>

<p>This parent was one of those rare ones who saw his children as
other people saw them. His boy had been as bad as he could be,
and though the youngest of the three, no excuse was offered for
him on that account.</p>

<p>"He has sown the wind and reaped the whirlwind," remarked the
father; "he chose the wrong path instead of the right, and no
one is blamable beside himself."</p>

<p>Mr. Wagstaff manifested deep interest in young McGovern, when
he learned what the young man had said to Dick Halliard. His father
was a prominent lawyer in New York, who had cherished the same
hopes for his son as he, but he would not be controlled, and he,
too, had run off to seek forbidden pleasures.</p>

<p>But the caller was touched by what he had heard as to the youth’s
change of feelings. He sought him out, and was pleased with his
talk. The same train which bore the remains of Wagstaff to New
York carried also Jim McGovern on his way to join his parents
who had known nothing of him for days.</p>
