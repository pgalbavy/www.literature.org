<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Under a sky heavy with stars and faintly brighter for a low-hanging
sickle moon, the gipsy caravan slept on the turf by the roadside, its
shutters closed, its shafts stretched out like arms. In the shadow of
the ditch nearby a stertorous horse was snoring.
</p><p>Far away, above the black crest of the hills, a bright streak of sky
announced the coming of the dawn. A church clock struck four. Here and
there a bird awoke and began to sing. The air was soft and warm.
</p><p>Abruptly, from the interior of the caravan, a woman's voice cried:
</p><p>"Saint-Quentin! Saint-Quentin!"
</p><p>A head was thrust out of the little window which looked out over the
box under the projecting roof.
</p><p>"A nice thing this! I thought as much! The rascal has decamped in the
night. The little beast! Nice discipline this is!"
</p><p>Other voices joined in the grumbling. Two or three minutes passed,
then the door in the back of the caravan opened and a shadowy figure
descended the five steps of the ladder while two tousled heads appeared
at the side window.
</p><p>"Dorothy! Where are you going?"
</p><p>"To look for Saint-Quentin!" replied the shadowy figure.
</p><p>"But he came back with you from your walk last night; and I saw him
settle down on the box."
</p><p>"You can see that he isn't there any longer, Castor."
</p><p>"Where is he?"
</p><p>"Patience! I'm going to bring him back to you by the ears."
</p><p>But two small boys in their shirts came tumbling down the steps of the
caravan and implored her:
</p><p>"No, no, mummy Dorothy! Don't you go away by yourself in the
night-time. It's dangerous...."
</p><p>"What are you making a fuss about, Pollux? Dangerous? It's no business
of yours!"
</p><p>She smacked them and kicked them gently, and brought them quickly back
to the caravan into which they climbed. There, sitting on the stool,
she took their two heads, pressed them against her face, and kissed
them tenderly.
</p><p>"No ill feeling, children. Danger? I'll find Saint-Quentin in half an
hour from now."
</p><p>"A nice business!... Saint-Quentin!... A beggar who isn't sixteen!"
</p><p>"While Castor and Pollux are twenty--taken together!" retorted Dorothy.
</p><p>"But what does he want to go traipsing about like this at night for?
And it isn't the first time either.... Where is it he makes these
expeditions to?"
</p><p>"To snare rabbits," she said. "There's nothing wrong in it, you see.
But come, there's been talk enough about it. Go to by-by again, boys.
And above all, Castor and Pollux, don't fight. D'you hear? And no
noise. The Captain's asleep; and he doesn't like to be disturbed, the
Captain doesn't."
</p><p>She took herself off, jumped over the ditch, crossed a meadow, in
which her feet splashed up the water in the puddles, and gained a
path which wound through a copse of young trees which only reached
her shoulders. Twice already, the evening before, strolling with her
comrade Saint-Quentin, she had followed this half-formed path, so that
she went briskly forward without hesitating. She crossed two roads,
came to a stream, the white pebbly bottom of which gleamed under the
quiet water, stepped into it, and walked up it against the current, as
if she wished to hide her tracks, and when the first light of day began
to invest objects with clear shapes, darted forth afresh through the
woods, light, graceful, not very tall, her legs bare below a very short
skirt from which streamed behind her a flutter of many-colored ribbons.
</p><p>She ran, with effortless ease, surefooted, with never a chance of
spraining an ankle, over the dead leaves, among the flowers of early
spring, lilies of the valley, violet anemones, or white narcissi.
</p><p>Her black hair, not very long, was divided into two heavy masses
which flapped like two wings. Her smiling face, parted lips, dilated
nostrils, her half-closed eyes proclaimed all her delight in her
swift course through the fresh air of the morning. Her neck, long and
flexible, rose from a blouse of gray linen, closed by a kerchief of
orange silk. She looked to be fifteen or sixteen years old.
</p><p>The wood came to an end. A valley lay before her, sunk between two
walls of rock and turning off abruptly. Dorothy stopped short. She had
reached her goal.
</p><p>Facing her, on a pedestal of granite, cleanly cut down, and not more
than a hundred feet in diameter, rose the main building of a château,
which though it lacked grandeur of style itself, yet drew from its
position and the impressive nature of its construction an air of being
a seigniorial residence. To the right and left the valley, narrowed to
two ravines, appeared to envelop it like an old-time moat. But in front
of Dorothy the full breadth of the valley formed a slightly undulating
glacis, strewn with boulders and traversed by hedges of briar, which
ended at the foot of the almost vertical cliff of the granite pedestal.
</p><p>"A quarter to five striking," murmured the young girl. "Saint-Quentin
won't be long."
</p><p>She crouched down behind the enormous trunk of an uprooted tree and
watched with unwinking eyes the line of demarcation between the château
itself and its rocky base.
</p><p>A narrow shelf of rock lengthened this line, running below the windows
of the ground floor; and there was a spot in this exiguous cornice at
which there came to an end a slanting fissure in the face of the cliff,
very narrow, something of the nature of a crevice in the face of a wall.
</p><p>The evening before, during their walk, Saint-Quentin had said, his
finger pointing at the fissure:
</p><p>"Those people believe themselves to be perfectly secure; and yet
nothing could be easier than to haul one's self up along that crack
to one of the windows. ... Look; there's one which is actually
half-open ... the window of some pantry."
</p><p>Dorothy had no doubt whatever that the idea of climbing the granite
pedestal had gripped Saint-Quentin and that that very night he had
stolen away to attempt it. What had become of him after the attempt?
Had there not been some one in the room he had entered? Knowing nothing
of the place he was exploring nor of the dwellers in it, had he not let
himself be taken? Or was he merely waiting for the break of day?
</p><p>She was greatly troubled. For all that she could see no sign of a path
along the ravine, some countryman might come along at the very moment
at which Saint-Quentin took the risk of making his descent, a far more
difficult business than climbing up.
</p><p>Of a sudden she quivered. One might have said that in thinking of this
mischance she had brought it on them. She heard the sound of heavy
footfalls coming along the ravine and making for its main entrance.
She buried herself among the roots of the tree and they hid her. A man
came in sight. He was wearing a long blouse; his face was encircled
and hidden by a gray muffler; old, furred gloves covered his hands; he
carried a gun on his arm, a mattock over his shoulder.
</p><p>She thought that he must be a sportsman, or rather a poacher, for he
walked with an uneasy air, looking carefully about him, like one who
feared to be seen, and who was carefully changing his usual bearing.
But he came to a standstill near the wall fifty or sixty yards from
the spot at which Saint-Quentin had made the ascent, and studied the
ground, turning over some flat stones and bending down over them.
</p><p>At last he made up his mind and seizing one of these slabs by its
narrower end, he raised it and set it up on end in such a manner that
it was balanced after the fashion of a cromlech. So doing he uncovered
a hole which had been hollowed out in the center of the deep imprint
left by the slab. Then he took his mattock and set about enlarging it,
removing the earth very quietly, evidently taking great care to make no
noise.
</p><p>A few minutes more slipped away. Then the inevitable event which
Dorothy had at once desired and feared took place. The window of the
château, through which Saint-Quentin had climbed the night before,
opened; and there appeared a long body clad in a long black coat,
its head covered with a high hat, which, even at that distance, were
plainly shiny, dirty, and patched.
</p><p>Squeezed flat against the wall, Saint-Quentin lowered himself from the
window and succeeded in setting his two feet on the rocky shelf. On
the instant Dorothy, who was at the back of the man in the blouse, was
on the point of rising and making a warning signal to her comrade. The
movement was useless. The man had perceived what looked to be a black
devil clinging to the face of the cliff, and dropping his mattock, he
slipped into the hole.
</p><p>For his part, Saint-Quentin, absorbed in his job of getting down, was
paying no attention to what was going on below him, and could only have
seen it by turning round, which was practically impossible. Uncoiling a
rope, which he had, without doubt, picked up in the mansion, he ran it
round a pillar of the balcony of the window in such a fashion that the
two ends hung down the face of the cliff an equal distance. With the
help of this double rope the descent presented no difficulty.
</p><p>Without losing a second, Dorothy, uneasy at being no longer able to
see the man in a blouse, sprang from her hiding-place and raced to the
hole. As she got a view of it, she smothered a cry. At the bottom of
the hole, as at the bottom of a trench, the man, resting the barrel of
his gun on the rampart of earth he had thrown up, was about to take
deliberate aim at the unconscious climber.
</p><p>Call out? Warn Saint-Quentin? That was to precipitate the event,
to make her presence known and find herself engaged in an unequal
struggle with an armed adversary. But do something she must. Up there
Saint-Quentin was availing himself of the fissure in the face of the
cliff, for all the world as if he were descending the shaft of a
chimney. The whole of him stuck out, a black and lean silhouette. His
high hat had been crushed down, concertina fashion, right on to his
ears.
</p><p>The man set the butt of his gun against his shoulder and took aim.
Dorothy leapt forward and flung herself at the stone which stood up
behind him and with the impetus of her spring and all her weight behind
her outstretched hands, shoved it. It was badly balanced, gave at the
shock, and toppled over, closing the excavation like a trap-door of
stone, crushing the gun, and imprisoning the man in the blouse. The
young girl got just a glimpse of his head as it bent and his shoulders
as they were thrust down into the hole.
</p><p>She thought that the attack was only postponed, that the enemy would
lose no time in getting out of his grave, and dashed at full speed to
the bottom of the fissure at which she arrived at the same time as
Saint-Quentin.
</p><p>"Quick ... quick!" she cried. "We must bolt!"
</p><p>In a flurry, he dragged down the rope by one of the ends, mumbling as
he did so:
</p><p>"What's up? What d'you want? How did you know I was here?"
</p><p>She gripped his arm and tugged at it.
</p><p>"Bolt, idiot!... They've seen you!... They were going to take a shot at
you!... Quick! They'll be after us!"
</p><p>"What's that? Be after us? Who?"
</p><p>"A queer-looking beggar disguised as a peasant. He's in a hole over
yonder. He was going to shoot you like a partridge when I tumbled the
slab on to the top of him."
</p><p>"But----"
</p><p>"Do as I tell you, idiot! And bring the rope with you. You mustn't
leave any traces!"
</p><p>She turned and bolted; he followed her. They reached the end of the
valley before the slab was raised, and without exchanging a word took
cover in the wood.
</p><p>Twenty minutes later they entered the stream and did not leave it till
they could emerge on to a bank of pebbles on which their feet could
leave no print.
</p><p>Saint-Quentin was off again like an arrow; but Dorothy stopped short,
suddenly shaken by a spasm of laughter which bent her double.
</p><p>"What is it?" he said. "What's the matter with you?"
</p><p>She could not answer. She was convulsed, her hands pressed against her
ribs, her face scarlet, her teeth, small, regular, whitely-gleaming
teeth, bared. At last she managed to stutter:
</p><p>"You--you--your high--high hat!... That b-b-black coat!... Your
b-b-bare feet!... It's t-t-too funny!... Where did you sneak that
disguise from?... Goodness! What a sight you are!"
</p><p>Her laughter rang out, young and fresh, on the silence in which the
leaves were fluttering. Facing her, Saint-Quentin, an awkward stripling
who had outgrown his strength, with his face too pale, his hair too
fair, his ears sticking out, but with admirable, very kindly black
eyes, gazed, smiling, at the young girl, delighted by this diversion
which seemed to be turning aside from him the outburst of wrath he was
expecting.
</p><p>Of a sudden, indeed, she fell upon him, attacking him with thumps
and reproaches, but in a half-hearted fashion, with little bursts of
laughter, which robbed the chastisement of its sting.
</p><p>"Wretch and rogue! You've been stealing again, have you? You're no
longer satisfied with your salary as acrobat, aren't you, my fine
fellow? You must still prig money or jewels to keep yourself in high
hats, must you? What have you got, looter? Eh? Tell me!"
</p><p>By dint of striking and laughing she had soothed her righteous
indignation. She set out again and Saint-Quentin, thoroughly abashed,
stammered:
</p><p>"Tell you? What's the good of telling you? You've guessed everything,
as usual.... As a matter of fact I did get in through that window,
last evening.... It was a pantry at the end of a corridor which led
to the ground-floor rooms.... Not a soul about.... The family was at
dinner.... A servant's staircase led me up into another passage, which
ran round the house, with the doors of all the rooms opening into it.
I went through them all. Nothing--that is to say, pictures and other
things too big to carry away. Then I hid myself in a closet, from which
I could see into a little sitting-room next to the prettiest bedroom.
They danced till late; then came upstairs ... fashionable people.... I
saw them through a peep-hole in the door ... the ladies décolletées,
the gentlemen in evening dress.... At last one of the ladies went into
the boudoir. She put her jewels into a jewel-box and the jewel-box into
a small safe, saying out loud as she opened it the three letters of the
combination of the lock, R.O.B.... So that, when she went to bed, all
I had to do was to make use of them.... After that.... I waited for
daylight.... I wasn't going to chance stumbling about in the dark."
</p><p>"Let's see what you've got," she commanded.
</p><p>He opened his hand and disclosed on the palm of it two earrings, set
with sapphires. She took them and looked at them. Her face changed; her
eyes sparkled; she murmured in quite a different voice:
</p><p>"How lovely they are, sapphires!... The sky is sometimes like that--at
night ... that dark blue, full of light...."
</p><p>At the moment they were crossing a piece of land on which stood a
large scarecrow, simply clad in a pair of trousers. On one of the
cross-sticks which served it for arms hung a jacket. It was the jacket
of Saint-Quentin. He had hung it there the evening before, and in order
to render himself unrecognizable, had borrowed the scarecrow's long
coat and high hat. He took off that long coat, buttoned it over the
plaster bosom of the scarecrow, and replaced the hat. Then he slipped
on his jacket and rejoined Dorothy.
</p><p>She was still looking at the sapphires with an air of admiration.
</p><p>He bent over them and said: "Keep them, Dorothy. You know quite well
that I'm not really a thief and that I only got them for you ... that
you might have the pleasure of looking at them and touching them....
It often goes to my heart to see you running about in that beggarly
get-up!... To think of you dancing on the tight-rope! You who ought to
live in luxury!... Ah, to think of all I'd do for you, if you'd let me!"
</p><p>She raised her head, looked into his eyes, and said: "Would you really
do anything for me?"
</p><p>"Anything, Dorothy."
</p><p>"Well, then, be honest, Saint-Quentin."
</p><p>They set out again; and the young girl continued:
</p><p>"Be honest, Saint-Quentin. That's all I ask of you. You and the
other boys of the caravan, I've adopted you because, like me, you're
war-orphans, and for the last two years we have wandered together
along the high roads, happy rather than miserable, getting our fun,
and on the whole, eating when we're hungry. But we must come to an
understanding. I only like what is clean and straight and as clear as a
ray of sunlight. Are you like me? This is the third time you've stolen
to give me pleasure. Is this the last time? If it is, I pardon it. If
it isn't, it's 'good-bye.'"
</p><p>She spoke very seriously, emphasizing each phrase by a toss of the head
which made the two wings of her hair flap.
</p><p>Overwhelmed, Saint-Quentin said imploringly:
</p><p>"Don't you want to have anything more to do with me?"
</p><p>"Yes. But swear you won't do it again."
</p><p>"I swear I won't."
</p><p>"Then we won't say anything more about it. I feel that you mean what
you say. Take back these jewels. You can hide them in the big basket
under the caravan. Next week you will send them back by post. It's the
Château de Chagny, isn't it?"
</p><p>"Yes, and I saw the lady's name on one of her band-boxes. She's the
Comtesse de Chagny."
</p><p>They went on hand in hand. Twice they hid themselves to avoid meeting
peasants, and at last, after several detours, they reached the
neighborhood of the caravan.
</p><p>"Listen," said Saint-Quentin, pausing to listen himself. "Yes. That's
what it is--Castor and Pollux fighting as usual, the rascals!"
</p><p>He dashed towards the sound.
</p><p>"Saint-Quentin!" cried the young girl. "I forbid you to hit them!"
</p><p>"You hit them often enough!"
</p><p>"Yes. But they like me to hit them."
</p><p>At the approach of Saint-Quentin, the two boys, who were fighting a
duel with wooden swords, turned from one another to face the common
enemy, howling:
</p><p>"Dorothy! Mummy Dorothy! Stop Saint-Quentin! He's a beast! Help!"
</p><p>There followed a distribution of cuffs, bursts of laughter, and hugs.
</p><p>"Dorothy, it's my turn to be hugged!"
</p><p>"Dorothy, it's my turn to be smacked!"
</p><p>But the young girl said in a scolding voice:
</p><p>"And the Captain? I'm sure you've gone and woke him up!"
</p><p>"The Captain? He's sleeping like a sapper," declared Pollux. "Just
listen to his snoring!"
</p><p>By the side of the road the two urchins had lit a fire of wood. The
pot, suspended from an iron tripod, was boiling. The four of them ate a
steaming thick soup, bread and cheese, and drank a cup of coffee.
</p><p>Dorothy did not budge from her stool. Her three companions would not
have permitted it. It was rather which of the three should rise to
serve her, all of them attentive to her wants, eager, jealous of one
another, even aggressive towards one another. The battles of Castor
and Pollux were always started by the fact that she had shown favor to
one or the other. The two urchins, stout and chubby, dressed alike in
pants, a shirt, and jacket, when one least expected it and for all that
they were as fond of one another as brothers, fell upon one another
with ferocious violence, because the young girl had spoken too kindly
to one, or delighted the other with a too affectionate look.
</p><p>As for Saint-Quentin, he cordially detested them. When Dorothy fondled
them, he could have cheerfully wrung their necks. Never would she hug
him. He had to content himself with good comradeship, trusting and
affectionate, which only showed itself in a friendly hand-shake or a
pleasant smile. The stripling delighted in them as the only reward
which a poor devil like him could possibly deserve. Saint-Quentin was
one of those who love with selfless devotion.
</p><p>"The arithmetic lesson now," was Dorothy's order. "And you,
Saint-Quentin, go to sleep for an hour on the box."
</p><p>Castor brought his arithmetic. Pollux displayed his copy-book. The
arithmetic lesson was followed by a lecture delivered by Dorothy on the
Merovingian kings, then by a lecture on astronomy.
</p><p>The two children listened with almost impassioned attention; and
Saint-Quentin on the box took good care not to go to sleep. In
teaching, Dorothy gave full play to her lively fancy in a fashion which
diverted her pupils and never allowed them to grow weary. She had an
air of learning herself whatever she chanced to be teaching. And her
discourse, delivered in a very gentle voice, revealed a considerable
knowledge and understanding and the suppleness of a practical
intelligence.
</p><p>At ten o'clock the young girl gave the order to harness the horse. The
journey to the next town was a long one; and they had to arrive in
time to secure the best place in front of the town-hall.
</p><p>"And the Captain? He hasn't had breakfast!" cried Castor.
</p><p>"All the better," said she. "The Captain always eats too much. It will
give his stomach a rest. Besides if any one wakes him he's always in a
frightful temper. Let him sleep on."
</p><p>They set out. The caravan moved along at the gentle pace of One-eyed
Magpie, a lean old mare, but still strong and willing. They called
her "One-eyed Magpie" because she had a piebald coat and had lost an
eye. Heavy, perched on two high wheels, rocking, jingling like old
iron, loaded with boxes, pots and pans, steps, barrels, and ropes, the
caravan had recently been repainted. On both sides it bore the pompous
inscription, "Dorothy's Circus, Manager's Carriage," which led one
to believe that a file of wagons and vehicles was following at some
distance with the staff, the properties, the baggage, and the wild
beasts.
</p><p>Saint-Quentin, whip in hand, walked at the head of the caravan.
Dorothy, with the two small boys at her side, gathered flowers from the
banks, sang choruses of marching songs with them, or told them stories.
But at the end of half an hour, in the middle of some cross-roads, she
gave the order: "Halt!"
</p><p>"What is it?" asked Saint-Quentin, seeing that she was reading the
directions on a sign-post.
</p><p>"Look," she said.
</p><p>"There's no need to look. It's straight on. I looked it up on our map."
</p><p>"Look," she repeated. "Chagny. A mile and a half."
</p><p>"Quite so. It's the village of our château of yesterday. Only to get to
it we made a short cut through the woods."
</p><p>"Chagny. A mile and a half. Château de Roborey."
</p><p>She appeared to be troubled and in a low voice she murmured again:
</p><p>"Roborey--Roborey."
</p><p>"Doubtless that's the proper name of the château," hazarded
Saint-Quentin. "What difference can it make to you?"
</p><p>"None--none."
</p><p>"But you look as if it made no end of a difference."
</p><p>"No. It's just a coincidence."
</p><p>"In what way?"
</p><p>"With regard to the name of Roborey----"
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Well, it's a word which was impressed on my memory ... a word which
was uttered in circumstances----"
</p><p>"What circumstances, Dorothy?"
</p><p>She explained slowly with a thoughtful air:
</p><p>"Think a minute, Saint-Quentin. I told you that my father died of his
wounds, at the beginning of the war, in a hospital near Chartres. I had
been summoned; but I did not arrive in time.... But two wounded men,
who occupied the beds next to his in the ward, told me that during his
last hours he never stopped repeating the same word again and again:
'Roborey ... Roborey.' It came like a litany, unceasingly, and as if
it weighed on his mind. Even when he was dying he still uttered the
word: 'Roborey ... Roborey.'"
</p><p>"Yes," said Saint-Quentin. "I remember.... You did tell me about it."
</p><p>"Ever since then I have been asking myself what it meant and by what
memory my poor father was obsessed at the time of his death. It was,
apparently, more than an obsession ... it was a terror ... a dread.
Why? I have never been able to find the explanation of it. So now you
understand, Saint-Quentin, on seeing this name ... written there,
staring me in the face ... on learning that there was a château of that
name...."
</p><p>Saint-Quentin was frightened:
</p><p>"You never mean to go there, do you?"
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"It's madness, Dorothy!"
</p><p>The young girl was silent, considering. But Saint-Quentin felt sure
that she had not abandoned this unprecedented design. He was seeking
for arguments to dissuade her when Castor and Pollux came running up:
</p><p>"Three caravans are coming along!"
</p><p>They issued on the instant, one after the other in single file, from
a sunken lane, which opened on to the cross-roads, and took the road
to Roborey. They were an Aunt Sally, a Rifle-Range, and a Tortoise
Merry-go-round. As he passed in front of Dorothy and Saint-Quentin, one
of the men of the Rifle-Range called to them:
</p><p>"Are you coming along too?"
</p><p>"Where to?" said Dorothy.
</p><p>"To the château. There's a village fête in the grounds. Shall I keep a
pitch for you?"
</p><p>"Right. And thanks very much," replied the young girl.
</p><p>The caravans went on their way.
</p><p>"What's the matter, Saint-Quentin?" said Dorothy.
</p><p>He was looking paler than usual.
</p><p>"What's the matter with you?" she repeated. "Your lips are twitching
and you are turning green!"
</p><p>He stammered:
</p><p>"The p-p-police!"
</p><p>From the same sunken lane two horsemen came into the cross-roads, they
rode on in front of the little party.
</p><p>"You see," said Dorothy, smiling, "they're not taking any notice of us."
</p><p>"No; but they're going to the château."
</p><p>"Of course they are. There's a fête there; and two policemen have to be
present."
</p><p>"Always supposing that they haven't discovered the disappearance of the
earrings and telephoned to the nearest police-station," he groaned.
</p><p>"It isn't likely. The lady will only discover it to-night, when she
dresses for dinner."
</p><p>"All the same, don't let's go there," implored the unhappy stripling.
"It's simply walking into the trap.... Besides, there's that man ...
the man in the hole."
</p><p>"Oh, he dug his own grave," she said and laughed.
</p><p>"Suppose he's there.... Suppose he recognizes me?"
</p><p>"You were disguised. All they could do would be to arrest the scarecrow
in the tall hat!"
</p><p>"And suppose they've already laid an information against me? If they
searched us they'd find the earrings."
</p><p>"Drop them in some bushes in the park when we get there. I'll tell the
people of the château their fortunes; and thanks to me, the lady will
recover her earrings. Our fortunes are made."
</p><p>"But if by any chance----"
</p><p>"Rubbish! It would amuse me to go and see what is going on at the
château which is named Roborey. So I'm going."
</p><p>"Yes; but I'm afraid ... afraid for you as well."
</p><p>"Then stay away."
</p><p>He shrugged his shoulders.
</p><p>"We'll chance it!" he said, and cracked his whip.
