<p>Professor Morgan continued: "Thus far the aeronauts had used
hot air with which to make their ascents, but the fire under the
balloon was always dangerous and more than one fatal accident
resulted therefrom. Hydrogen gas was far better, but more costly.
Public subscriptions enabled two brothers named Robert, assisted
by M. Charles, to construct a spherical balloon, twenty-eight
feet in diameter, the silk envelope being covered with varnish,
and the upper half inclosed in a network which supported a hoop
that encircled the middle of the sphere. A boat-like structure
dangled a few feet below the mouth, and was attached to the hoop,
while a safety valve at the apex prevented bursting through expansion
of the gas as the balloon climbed the sky.</p>

<p>"This structure was inflated with hydrogen gas in the Garden
of the Tuileries, Paris, on the first of December, 1783. M. Charles
and one of the Roberts seated themselves in the car, provided
with extra clothing, provisions, sand bags for ballast, a barometer
and a thermometer, and gave the word to let go. The balloon soared
swiftly, the aeronauts waving hands and hats in response to the
cheers of the multitudes below. The ascent was a success in every
respect. Having drifted thirty miles from Paris, the balloon safely
descended near Nesle. There was so much gas left that the enthusiastic
M. Charles decided to go up again, after parting with his companion.
He climbed nine thousand feet and then by the dexterous use of
his ballast came to earth again without the least jar.</p>

<p>"The impulse thus given to ballooning spread to other countries
and it would be idle to attempt any record of their efforts. It
may be said that for nearly a hundred years little or no progress
was made in aerostation. Then came the second stage, the construction
of dirigible or manageable balloons. All the structures which
had hitherto left the earth were wholly under control of air currents,
as much as a chip of wood is under the control of the stream into
which it is flung. People began to experiment with a view of directing
the course of the ships of the sky. While it was impossible to
make headway against a gale or strong wind, it seemed that the
aeronaut ought to be able to overcome a moderate breeze. The first
attempt was by means of oars and a rudder, but nothing was accomplished
until 1852, when Giffard used a small engine, but the difficulty
of constructing a light motor of sufficient power checked all
progress for awhile. It could not do so for long, however, as
the inventive genius of mankind was at work and would not pause
until satisfied. One of Giffard’s stupendous ideas was a balloon
more than a third of a mile long with an engine weighing thirty
tons, but the magnitude and expense involved were too vast to
be considered.</p>

<p>"It would be tedious to follow the various steps in dirigible
ballooning. It was not until 1882, that the Tissandier brothers,
Gilbert and Albert—Frenchmen—built a dirigible cigar-shaped balloon
substantially on the old lines, but it could not be made to travel
more than five miles an hour in a dead calm, and was helpless
in a moderate wind. None the less their attempts marked an epoch,
for they introduced an electric motor. The ‘La France,’ when constructed
some time later, was a hundred and sixty-five feet long, twenty-seven
feet at its greatest diameter, and had a capacity of sixty-six
thousand cubic feet. Many changes and improvements followed and
an ascent was made in August, 1884, during which the balloon traveled
two and a half miles, turned round and came back in the face of
a gentle breeze to its starting point, the whole time in the air
being less than half an hour. This was the first exploit of that
nature.</p>

<p>"But," added the Professor, "I am talking too much about dirigible
ballooning, for our chief interest does not lie there. I am sure
you have read of the Schwartz aluminum dirigible; Santos-Dumont
and his brilliant performances with his fourteen airships; Roze’s
double airship, and Count Zeppelin’s splendid successes with his
colossal dirigibles.</p>

<p>"We have dealt only with structures that were lighter than air.
The wonderful field that has opened before us and into which thousands
are crowding, with every day bringing new and startling achievements,
is that of the heavier-than-air machines. In other words, we have
learned to become air men and to fly as the birds fly.</p>

<p>"Success was sure to come sooner or later, and when it did come
every one wondered why it was so late, since the principles are
so simple that a child can understand them. Otto Lilienthal, after
long study and experimentation, published in Berlin in 1889, as
one of the results of his labors, the discovery that arched surfaces
driven against the wind have a strong tendency to rise. Then he
demonstrated by personal experiments that a beginning must be
made by ‘gliding’ through the air in order to learn to balance
one’s self. He piled up a lot of dirt fifty feet high, and from
its summit made a number of starts, succeeding so well that he
tried a small motor to help flap his wings. Sad to say, an error
of adjustment caused the machine to turn over in August, 1896,
and he was killed.</p>

<p>"Percy S. Pilcher of England experimented for several years along
the same lines and used the method of a kite by employing men
to run with a rope against the wind, but he was destined to become
another martyr, for he was fatally injured one day by a fall.
Chanute and Herring of Chicago taught us a good deal about gliders.
Herring used a motor driven by compressed air and had two plane
surfaces for his apparatus, but his motor was too weak to sustain
him for more than a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Professor," said Wharton, "I have often heard of the Hargrave
kite; why do folks call it that name?"</p>

<p>"You mean the box pattern, made of calico stretched over redwood
frames. They are the invention of Lawrence Hargrave of Sydney,
Australia. He attached a sling seat to one and connected three
above it. A brisk wind showed a lift of more than two hundred
pounds, and he made a number of ascents, the kites preserving
their stability most satisfactorily.</p>

<p>"Of course you do not need to be told anything about Orville
and Wilbur Wright of Dayton, Ohio. These plucky and persevering
fellows experimented for years in the effort to overcome obstacles
that had baffled inventors for centuries. Among the problems they
solved were whether stability is most effectively gained by shifting
the center of gravity, or by a special steering device, and what
the power of a rudder is when fixed in front of a machine. They
decided that in gliding experiments it is best for the aviator
to lie in a horizontal position; that a vertical rudder in the
rear of a machine is preferable in order to turn to the right
or left, and a horizontal rudder or small plane in front is the
most effective device for guiding the aeroplane up or down."</p>

<p>The Professor was in the middle of his interesting talk, when
he abruptly paused and came to his feet.</p>

<p>"I’ve stayed longer than I intended," said he; "I must bid you
good night. If it won’t be too much trouble to your wife I shall
be glad to drink a cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"No trouble at all," replied Abisha Wharton springing from his
stool; "won’t you eat something?"</p>

<p>"I don’t need it."</p>

<p>The three walked through the open door into the larger room where
the wife was sitting. Bohunkus was leaning back against the front
of the house sound asleep, as he had been for some minutes. No
one disturbed him. The woman had heard the words of the visitor,
and quickly brought in a big coffee pot from which she poured
a brimming cup, placing some milk and sugar on the table. The
Professor had not yet thanked any one for the proffers made him
and he did not do so now, but standing erect, with his cap almost
touching the ceiling, he drank, smacked his thin lips and remarked
that the refreshment was good.</p>

<p>Standing thus clearly disclosed in the candle-light, the Professor
impressed Harvey Hamilton more than before. He was as straight
as an arrow and his piercing black eyes had a gleam that must
have possessed hypnotic power. In fact the woman showed so much
restlessness under his glances that she made a pretext for leaving
the room and remained out of sight until he departed. He did not
offer to pay his host and still forgot to acknowledge by word
the kindnesses shown him.</p>

<p>Harvey and Abisha accompanied him on his brief walk across the
little plain to where his machine was waiting. Without any preliminaries
such as testing the wires, levers, framework and different parts
of the apparatus, he seated himself.</p>

<p>"Now," he said in his thunderous bass, "note the action of my
uplifter."</p>

<p>This contrivance was simply a horizontal propeller under the
machine, which being set revolving with great rapidity hoisted
it gently from the ground and as straight upward as a cannon shot
fired at the zenith. It was easy to understand the principle of
the action, but not of some of the other performances of the eccentric
inventor. When the aerocar was well off the earth, the regular
propeller in front began work and the uplifter became motionless.</p>

<p>All this time only a faint humming noise was noticeable, but
in a few minutes that became inaudible. Professor Morgan was swallowed
up in the darkness and speedily vanished, for he made no use of
his searchlight. He must have been half a mile to the northward
when he let off a rocket. Ordinary prudence on account of sparks
probably caused him to send it sideways. It formed a striking
picture,—this germination as it were of a blazing object in mid
air, which shot away with arrowy swiftness in a graceful parabola
that curved downward, and when about half way to the ground burst
into a myriad of dazzling sparks of different hues that were quickly
lost in the gloom.</p>

<p>The two spectators waited and gazed in silence, but saw nothing
more and returned to their seats in front of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Strange man," said Harvey, "I wonder whether we shall ever see
him again."</p>

<p>"I don’t think there is much chance of my meeting him, but you
may bump against him some time when you are cruising overhead."</p>

<p>"That seems hardly likely, for the field is too big."</p>

<p>And yet Harvey Hamilton and Professor Milo Morgan were destined
to meet sooner than either suspected and in circumstances of which
neither could have dreamed.</p>

<p>Wharton refilled his corncob pipe and puffed with deliberate
enjoyment.</p>

<p>"What do you think of him, Mr. Hamilton?" he finally asked.</p>

<p>"He’s wonderfully well informed about aviation, but is cranky."</p>

<p>"He’s more than that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He’s plumb crazy."</p>

<p>"You wouldn’t think so from his conversation; no one can talk
better than he."</p>

<p>"But his eyes! They gave him dead away; I’m glad he didn’t stay
all night."</p>

<p>"What difference could that make?"</p>

<p>"More’n likely he would have got up and killed us all while we
were asleep."</p>

<p>Harvey laughed.</p>

<p>"While he isn’t the sort of companion I should fancy, I’m sure
he is not that kind of a lunatic. The chances are that he will
lose his life through some of his experiments in aviation, the
same as those we talked about."</p>

<p>"Shall we say anything to Bohunkus about the man being off his
base?" asked Wharton, as if in doubt regarding his duty in the
circumstances.</p>

<p>"It isn’t worth while; nothing can be gained by doing so."</p>

<p>And in reaching this decision, Harvey Hamilton made a grand mistake,
as he was fated to learn before many days. It would have been
a fortunate thing, too, had the colored youth kept awake during
this chat, but it was not so to be.</p>

<p>As the night advanced, the host told his guest he was at liberty
to retire whenever agreeable. The couple had a sleeping room upstairs,
and not being well provided for company, a blanket was spread
on the floor in the lower front room. Bohunkus was still unconscious,
his cap having fallen at his feet. Harvey reached over and shook
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come, Bunk, it’s time to go to bed—excuse me!"</p>

<p>Although the action was gentle, it destroyed the sleeper’s center
of gravity, and he and the stool tumbled over on the floor. Even
then, he was only partially awakened and mumbled a wish that folks
would stay on their own side of the bed, as he climbed unsteadily
to his feet.</p>

<p>The weather was so mild that there was no discomfort in occupying
a room whose windows and door were open. With the aid of the candle,
Bohunkus stumbled to the blanket in the corner, pitched down upon
it and the next minute was slumbering as soundly as when his stool
tipped over with him. He and Harvey had laid aside their heavy
coats before they sawed and split the supply of wood, and the
single blanket gave them all the protection they needed. Thus
the two lay down to pleasant dreams. </p>
