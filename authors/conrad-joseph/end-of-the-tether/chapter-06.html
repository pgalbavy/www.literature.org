<p> The sun had set. And when, after drilling a deep hole with his
stick, he moved from that spot the night had massed its army of
shadows under the trees. They filled the eastern ends of the avenues
as if only waiting the signal for a general advance upon the open
spaces of the world; they were gathering low between the deep
stone-faced banks of the canal. The Malay prau, half-concealed
under the arch of the bridge, had not altered its position a quarter
of an inch. For a long time Captain Whalley stared down over the
parapet, till at last the floating immobility of that beshrouded
thing seemed to grow upon him into something inexplicable and
alarming. The twilight abandoned the zenith; its reflected gleams
left the world below, and the water of the canal seemed to turn
into pitch. Captain Whalley crossed it.</p>

<p>The turning to the right, which was his way to his hotel, was
only a very few steps farther. He stopped again (all the houses
of the sea-front were shut up, the quayside was deserted, but
for one or two figures of natives walking in the distance) and
began to reckon the amount of his bill. So many days in the hotel
at so many dollars a day. To count the days he used his fingers:
plunging one hand into his pocket, he jingled a few silver coins.
All right for three days more; and then, unless something turned
up, he must break into the five hundred &mdash;Ivy’s money&mdash;invested
in her father. It seemed to him that the first meal coming out
of that reserve would choke him&mdash;for certain. Reason was of no
use. It was a matter of feeling. His feelings had never played
him false.</p>

<p>He did not turn to the right. He walked on, as if there still
had been a ship in the roadstead to which he could get himself
pulled off in the evening. Far away, beyond the houses, on the
slope of an indigo promontory closing the view of the quays, the
slim column of a factory-chimney smoked quietly straight up into
the clear air. A Chinaman, curled down in the stern of one of
the half-dozen sampans floating off the end of the jetty, caught
sight of a beckoning hand. He jumped up, rolled his pigtail round
his head swiftly, tucked in two rapid movements his wide dark
trousers high up his yellow thighs, and by a single, noiseless,
finlike stir of the oars, sheered the sampan alongside the steps
with the ease and precision of a swimming fish.</p>

<p>"Sofala," articulated Captain Whalley from above; and the Chinaman,
a new emigrant probably, stared upwards with a tense attention
as if waiting to see the queer word fall visibly from the white
man’s lips. "Sofala," Captain Whalley repeated; and suddenly his
heart failed him. He paused. The shores, the islets, the high
ground, the low points, were dark: the horizon had grown somber;
and across the eastern sweep of the shore the white obelisk, marking
the landing-place of the telegraph-cable, stood like a pale ghost
on the beach before the dark spread of uneven roofs, intermingled
with palms, of the native town. Captain Whalley began again.</p>

<p>"Sofala. Savee So-fa-la, John?"</p>

<p>This time the Chinaman made out that bizarre sound, and grunted
his assent uncouthly, low down in his bare throat. With the first
yellow twinkle of a star that appeared like the head of a pin
stabbed deep into the smooth, pale, shimmering fabric of the sky,
the edge of a keen chill seemed to cleave through the warm air
of the earth. At the moment of stepping into the sampan to go
and try for the command of the Sofala Captain Whalley shivered
a little.</p>

<p>When on his return he landed on the quay again Venus, like a
choice jewel set low on the hem of the sky, cast a faint gold
trail behind him upon the roadstead, as level as a floor made
of one dark and polished stone. The lofty vaults of the avenues
were black&mdash;all black overhead&mdash;and the porcelain globes on the
lamp-posts resembled egg-shaped pearls, gigantic and luminous,
displayed in a row whose farther end seemed to sink in the distance,
down to the level of his knees. He put his hands behind his back.
He would now consider calmly the discretion of it before saying
the final word to-morrow. His feet scrunched the gravel loudly&mdash;the
discretion of it. It would have been easier to appraise had there
been a workable alternative. The honesty of it was indubitable:
he meant well by the fellow; and periodically his shadow leaped
up intense by his side on the trunks of the trees, to lengthen
itself, oblique and dim, far over the grass&mdash;repeating his stride.</p>

<p>The discretion of it. Was there a choice? He seemed already to
have lost something of himself; to have given up to a hungry specter
something of his truth and dignity in order to live. But his life
was necessary. Let poverty do its worst in exacting its toll of
humiliation. It was certain that Ned Eliott had rendered him,
without knowing it, a service for which it would have been impossible
to ask. He hoped Ned would not think there had been something
underhand in his action. He supposed that now when he heard of
it he would understand&mdash;or perhaps he would only think Whalley
an eccentric old fool. What would have been the good of telling
him&mdash;any more than of blurting the whole tale to that man Massy?
Five hundred pounds ready to invest. Let him make the best of
that. Let him wonder. You want a captain &mdash;I want a ship.
That’s enough. B-r-r-r-r. What a disagreeable impression that
empty, dark, echoing steamer had made upon him. . . .</p>

<p>A laid-up steamer was a dead thing and no mistake; a sailing-ship
somehow seems always ready to spring into life with the breath
of the incorruptible heaven; but a steamer, thought Captain Whalley,
with her fires out, without the warm whiffs from below meeting
you on her decks, without the hiss of steam, the clangs of iron
in her breast&mdash;lies there as cold and still and pulseless as a
corpse.</p>

<p>In the solitude of the avenue, all black above and lighted below,
Captain Whalley, considering the discretion of his course, met,
as it were incidentally, the thought of death. He pushed it aside
with dislike and contempt. He almost laughed at it; and in the
unquenchable vitality of his age only thought with a kind of exultation
how little he needed to keep body and soul together. Not a bad
investment for the poor woman this solid carcass of her father.
And for the rest&mdash;in case of anything&mdash;the agreement should be
clear: the whole five hundred to be paid back to her integrally
within three months. Integrally. Every penny. He was not to lose
any of her money whatever else had to go&mdash;a little dignity&mdash;some
of his self-respect. He had never before allowed anybody to remain
under any sort of false impression as to himself. Well, let that
go&mdash;for her sake. After all, he had never <em>said</em> anything
misleading&mdash;and Captain Whalley felt himself corrupt to the marrow
of his bones. He laughed a little with the intimate scorn of his
worldly prudence. Clearly, with a fellow of that sort, and in
the peculiar relation they were to stand to each other, it would
not have done to blurt out everything. He did not like the fellow.
He did not like his spells of fawning loquacity and bursts of
resentfulness. In the end&mdash;a poor devil. He would not have liked
to stand in his shoes. Men were not evil, after all. He did not
like his sleek hair, his queer way of standing at right angles,
with his nose in the air, and glancing along his shoulder at you.
No. On the whole, men were not bad&mdash;they were only silly or unhappy.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley had finished considering the discretion of that
step&mdash;and there was the whole long night before him. In the full
light his long beard would glisten like a silver breastplate covering
his heart; in the spaces between the lamps his burly figure passed
less distinct, loomed very big, wandering, and mysterious. No;
there was not much real harm in men: and all the time a shadow
marched with him, slanting on his left hand&mdash;which in the East
is a presage of evil.</p>

<p>. . . . . . .</p>

<p>"Can you make out the clump of palms yet, Serang?" asked Captain
Whalley from his chair on the bridge of the Sofala approaching
the bar of Batu Beru.</p>

<p>"No, Tuan. By-and-by see." The old Malay, in a blue dungaree
suit, planted on his bony dark feet under the bridge awning, put
his hands behind his back and stared ahead out of the innumerable
wrinkles at the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley sat still, without lifting his head to look for
himself. Three years&mdash;thirty-six times. He had made these palms
thirty-six times from the southward. They would come into view
at the proper time. Thank God, the old ship made her courses and
distances trip after trip, as correct as clockwork. At last he
murmured again&mdash;</p>

<p>"In sight yet?"</p>

<p>"The sun makes a very great glare, Tuan."</p>

<p>"Watch well, Serang."</p>

<p>"Ya, Tuan."</p>

<p>A white man had ascended the ladder from the deck noiselessly,
and had listened quietly to this short colloquy. Then he stepped
out on the bridge and began to walk from end to end, holding up
the long cherrywood stem of a pipe. His black hair lay plastered
in long lanky wisps across the bald summit of his head; he had
a furrowed brow, a yellow complexion, and a thick shapeless nose.
A scanty growth of whisker did not conceal the contour of his
jaw. His aspect was of brooding care; and sucking at a curved
black mouthpiece, he presented such a heavy overhanging profile
that even the Serang could not help reflecting sometimes upon
the extreme unloveliness of some white men.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley seemed to brace himself up in his chair, but
gave no recognition whatever to his presence. The other puffed
jets of smoke; then suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I could never understand that new mania of yours of having this
Malay here for your shadow, partner."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley got up from the chair in all his imposing stature
and walked across to the binnacle, holding such an unswerving
course that the other had to back away hurriedly, and remained
as if intimidated, with the pipe trembling in his hand. "Walk
over me now," he muttered in a sort of astounded and discomfited
whisper. Then slowly and distinctly he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>am&mdash;not&mdash;dirt." And then added defiantly, "As you
seem to think."</p>

<p>The Serang jerked out&mdash;</p>

<p>"See the palms now, Tuan."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley strode forward to the rail; but his eyes, instead
of going straight to the point, with the assured keen glance of
a sailor, wandered irresolutely in space, as though he, the discoverer
of new routes, had lost his way upon this narrow sea.</p>

<p>Another white man, the mate, came up on the bridge. He was tall,
young, lean, with a mustache like a trooper, and something malicious
in the eye. He took up a position beside the engineer. Captain
Whalley, with his back to them, inquired&mdash;</p>

<p>"What’s on the log?"</p>

<p>"Eighty-five," answered the mate quickly, and nudged the engineer
with his elbow.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley’s muscular hands squeezed the iron rail with
an extraordinary force; his eyes glared with an enormous effort;
he knitted his eyebrows, the perspiration fell from under his
hat,&mdash;and in a faint voice he murmured, "Steady her, Serang&mdash;when
she is on the proper bearing."</p>

<p>The silent Malay stepped back, waited a little, and lifted his
arm warningly to the helmsman. The wheel revolved rapidly to meet
the swing of the ship. Again the mate nudged the engineer. But
Massy turned upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sterne," he said violently, "let me tell you&mdash;as a shipowner&mdash;that
you are no better than a confounded fool."</p>
