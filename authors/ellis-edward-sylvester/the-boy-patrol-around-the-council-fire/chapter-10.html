<p>When Mike Murphy hurried off the opposite end of the porch of
the bungalow, his single purpose was to rid himself of Hoke Butler,
who had set his heart upon keeping him company for the day. It
was a happy thought thus to send the youth to collect an imaginary
debt from Alvin Landon, and it would seem could scarcely fail
of accomplishing the end in view.</p>

<p>"The spalpeen can thravel a good deal faster then mesilf, owing
to the lingth of his legs, but I’ve got too good a start for him
to find me among the traas."</p>

<p>Mike still walked fast, often glancing behind and more and more
relieved that he failed to gain sight of a living person, or rather
of him whom he dreaded to see.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mike, where are you?"</p>

<p>The youth appealed to almost leaped from the ground, for the
familiar voice sounded much too near for comfort.</p>

<p>"I’m here just now," muttered Mike, "but I don’t intind to stay.
Worrah, worrah, is there no way of shaking ye loose?"</p>

<p>The shout was repeated twice and then ceased. It looked as if
Hoke believed he was too far separated from his friend to reach
him by calling, though he was not likely to give up the search
for some time to come. Mike changed his course and in doing so
came near losing himself. It was impossible in the circumstances
to go far astray, but he was likely to waste a good deal of time.</p>

<p>Coming to a halt he took his bearings. He knew he was well to
the westward of the bungalow and not far from the lake. He was
sure also, after noting the position of the sun, of the course
he should follow to reach the body of water. His plan was to keep
along shore until he came to the western end of the lake, around
which he would make his way if necessary, returning by the northern
bank which would take him past the home of Dr. Spellman. The conviction,
however, was strong with the young man that he would not be called
upon to travel that far before gaining the knowledge which was
drawing him onward as the steel draws the magnet.</p>

<p>When he had traveled far enough to bring him to the lake and
still failed to catch the gleam of its surface, he halted once
more and stared around.</p>

<p>"If I’m lost agin I’ll hire some of the byes to lead me about
by the hand, fur I ain’t fit to travel alone—hello! there’s one
of ’em, that I’ll question without letting him know I’m a stray
lamb."</p>

<p>He had a glimpse of a moving body almost directly ahead, and
knowing it was one of the scouts he called:</p>

<p>"I wish to remark, me friend, that it’s a foine day; if ye agraa
wid me I shall be plaised to have ye signerfy the same."</p>

<p>"Why, Mike, I’m so glad to see you again; you ain’t mad because
I got lost?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not a bit, as Jim O’Toole said whin the sheriff apologized
for shooting him on the wing."</p>

<p>And Mike extended his hand to Hoke Butler as he came grinningly
forward.</p>

<p>"How was it ye missed me?" asked Mike innocently.</p>

<p>"I’ll be hanged if I can tell; I hurried back after talking to
Alvin and ought to have found you, but somehow or other I didn’t."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t ye holler?"</p>

<p>"I nearly split my throat calling to you."</p>

<p>"Strange! I wonder if I’m getting deaf."</p>

<p>"Gracious! I hope not; don’t say that or you’ll worry me awfully."</p>

<p>"Did Alvin hand ye the five dollars?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Say, Mike, they must be blamed poor, for they
had only a Canadian quarter between them. I don’t think they amount
to much."</p>

<p>Mike couldn’t stand this slur upon his chums.</p>

<p>"Let me tell ye something that will make ye open yer eyes. Alvin
Landon’s father is one of the richest men in New York, and Chester’s
is almost as wealthy. They are worth millions upon millions of
dollars, and the byes have all the money they want, but they are
not such fules as you and me and don’t throw it away, though they
give a good deal of it to poor folks. So ye may rist aisy on that
score, friend Hoke."</p>

<p>"Gee! I never suspected that. They don’t put on any more airs
than the poorest of the Boy Scouts."</p>

<p>"Which the same shows their sinse; they’ve always been that way
and always will be. But this isn’t tending to bus’ness. Do ye
wish to keep company wid me till night?"</p>

<p>"You bet! I’m going to stick to you like a burr; I hope you haven’t
any hard feelings on account of my losing you for a little while.
I really didn’t mean it."</p>

<p>"It’s mesilf that has no hard feelings, but I was thinking that
if we don’t get back to the clubhouse till night ye will be obliged
to lose your dinner."</p>

<p>"I don’t like that much, but I’ll stand it for your sake. I’ll
even things up at the supper table. A Boy Scout should learn to
suffer when it can’t be helped."</p>

<p>"I’ve found out the same," replied Mike with a significance which
his companion did not catch; "I hope we shan’t starve to death."</p>

<p>"No danger of that," remarked Hoke, not absolutely certain that
some such calamity did not threaten them.</p>

<p>Mike Murphy like a philosopher made up his mind to accept the
inevitable. It seemed to be decreed by fate that he should have
this young man as a companion throughout at least this day, so
what was the use of kicking against it? Besides, it was not impossible
that where there was so much eagerness on the part of Hoke to
help, he might be able to do so in the strange task Mike had laid
out for himself.</p>

<p>One pleasing fact about the intruder was that he never lost his
way. He pointed out the direction in which the lake lay and Mike
took care not to let him know he himself had believed that an
altogether different course led to it. Pausing on the shore they
looked out upon one of the most beautiful and romantic bodies
of water to be found in a region which abounds with them. Both
saw the canoe laden deeply with three men which was heading for
a point to the westward of Dr. Spellman’s home. The boys studied
it closely, but the distance was too great to identify the old
man, and his companions were strangers.</p>

<p>Mike had told young Butler nothing of his experience of the day
before, nor did he do so now. Whatever Hoke was able to do in
the way of aid he could accomplish as well while ignorant as if
he knew everything.</p>

<p>"Would it be too far, Hoke, for ye to walk wid me round the end
of the lake to the spot where the canoe wint from sight?"</p>

<p>"It’s a pretty good walk, Mike, but it’s nothing so long as I
am with <em>you</em>. I can’t think of anything I wouldn’t do
to please you."</p>

<p>"I could, but I’ll not mintion it," grinned Mike as they resumed
their course with Hoke in the lead.</p>

<p>The forenoon was half gone when they came to the western end
of the lake and changed their course so as to follow the curvature
that would take them to the northern shore. All the time they
were in sight of the water, which they examined at intervals in
quest of other boats. While the home of Dr. Spellman, as we remember,
was invisible from the lake, it was easy to locate it by the thin
wisp of smoke which filtered through the tree-tops. The same could
have been said of Uncle Elk’s cabin had there been any fire burning.</p>

<p>"I am thinking, Mike," remarked Hoke some time later, "that if
you intend to go clean round the lake we haven’t any time to throw
away."</p>

<p>"We kin take all day and the night, should the same be nicissary,
but there’s no call to hurry and if ye find yersilf growing weary,
ye have me permission to turn back whin the notion takes ye."</p>

<p>"We have gone so far that I don’t see much choice in taking either
direction. I say, Mike, isn’t that something queer ahead of us?"</p>

<p>"I’d like to know where ye could be without something qua’ar
being ahead of ye,—begora! I belave ye are right," added Mike
in surprise. An object loomed up which he had not seen before
nor had he heard any one speak of it, though he and others had
been in the neighborhood more than once.</p>

<p>At a point where the undergrowth was plentiful and less than
a hundred yards back from the shore, were the ruins of what probably
had once been a fisherman or hunter’s cabin. Long before the present
time, some party had erected these rude quarters as a refuge during
cold or stormy weather only to abandon them for more inviting
protection. The ruins were simply four walls of logs hardly a
dozen feet square and less than half as high. If there had once
been a roof, it had disappeared long since. No door was visible
from where the boys stood.</p>

<p>"It reminds me of the Castle of Donleigh, which I niver obsarved,"
remarked Mike after they had stood for some minutes.</p>

<p>"I think some one started to put up a cabin such as Uncle Elk
did, but changed his mind before he built a roof. Maybe it was
Uncle Elk himself."</p>

<p>"Aither him or somebody ilse; let’s look further."</p>

<p>Instead of going nearer, the two slowly circled the ruins, keeping
a little way from them. When the circuit was completed the surprising
fact became known that nothing in the nature of a door had been
made by those who laid the logs. Manifestly the structure had
been abandoned before it was half finished.</p>

<p>"It’s easy to raise yourself high enough to look inside," suddenly
remarked Hoke; "I’m going to have a peep. Wait here till I come
back."</p>

<p>He ran to the side of the pile, with Mike slowly following. The
latter gripped his shillaleh firmly, but was moving so slowly
that he had not passed a third of the distance when Hoke inserted
the toe of one foot in a lower crevice, sprang lightly upward
and seized the topmost log with both hands. This raised his head
above the barrier, and in the same minute Mike saw a hand thrust
forward from the inside, grasp the collar of his companion’s coat
and violently yank him out of sight. </p>
