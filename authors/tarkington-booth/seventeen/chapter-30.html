<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In the smallish house which all summer long, from morning until
late at night, had resounded with the voices of young people,
echoing their songs, murmurous with their theories of love, or
vibrating with their glee, sometimes shaking all over during their
more boisterous moods&mdash;in that house, now comparatively so vacant,
the proprietor stood and breathed deep breaths.</p>

<p>"Hah!" he said, inhaling and exhaling the air profoundly.</p>

<p>His wife was upon the porch, outside, sewing. The silence was
deep. He seemed to listen to it&mdash;to listen with gusto; his face
slowly broadening, a pinkish tint overspreading it. His flaccid
cheeks appeared to fill, to grow firm again, a smile finally widening
them.</p>

<p>"<em>HAH!" </em>he breathed, sonorously. He gave himself several
resounding slaps upon the chest, then went out to the porch and
sat in a rocking-chair near his wife. He spread himself out expansively.
"My Glory!" he said. "I believe I'll take off my coat! I haven't
had my coat off, outside of my own room, all summer. I believe
I'll take a vacation! By George, I believe I'll stay home this
afternoon!"</p>

<p>"That's nice," said Mrs. Parcher.</p>

<p>"Hah!" he said. "My Glory! I believe I'll take off my shoes!"</p>

<p>And, meeting no objection, he proceeded to carry out this plan.</p>

<p>"Hah-AH!" he said, and placed his stockinged feet upon the railing,
where a number of vines, running upon strings, made a screen between
the porch and the street. He lit a large cigar. "Well, well!"
he said. "That tastes good! If this keeps on, I'll be in as good
shape as I was last spring before you know it!" Leaning far back
in the rocking-chair, his hands behind his head, he smoked with
fervor; but suddenly he jumped in a way which showed that his
nerves were far from normal. His feet came to the floor with a
thump, he jerked the cigar out of his mouth, and turned a face
of consternation upon his wife.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Suppose," said Mr. Patcher, huskily&mdash;"suppose she missed her
train."</p>

<p>Mrs. Parcher shook her head.</p>

<p>"Think not?" he said, brightening. "I ordered the livery-stable
to have a carriage here in lots of time."</p>

<p>"They did," said Mrs. Parcher, severely. "About five dollars'
worth."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind that," he returned, putting his feet up again.
"After all, she was a mighty fine little girl in her way. The
only trouble with me was that crowd of boys;&mdash;having to listen
to them certainly liked to killed me, and I believe if she'd stayed
just one more day I'd been a goner! Of all the dam boys I ever&mdash;"
He paused, listening.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parcher!" a youthful voice repeated.</p>

<p>He rose, and, separating two of the vines which screened the
end of the porch from the street, looked out. Two small maidens
had paused upon the sidewalk, and were peering over the picket
fence.</p>

<p>"Mr. Parcher," said Jane, as soon as his head appeared between
the vines&mdash;"Mr. Parcher, Miss Pratt's gone. She's gone away on
the cars."</p>

<p>"You think so?" he asked, gravely.</p>

<p>"We saw her," said Jane. "Rannie an' I were there. Willie was
goin' to chase us, I guess, but we went in the baggage-room behind
trunks, an' we saw her go. She got on the cars, an' it went with
her in it. Honest, she's gone away, Mr. Parcher."</p>

<p>Before speaking, Mr. Parcher took a long look at this telepathic
child. In his fond eyes she was a marvel and a darling.</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;<em>THANK </em>you, Jane!" he said.</p>

<p>Jane, however, had turned her head and was staring at the corner,
which was out of his sight.</p>

<p>"Oo-oo-ooh!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"What's the trouble, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Willie!" she said. "It's Willie an' that Joe Bullitt, an' Johnnie
Watson, an' Mr. Wallace Banks. They're with Miss May Parcher.
They're comin' right here!"</p>

<p>Mr. Parcher gave forth a low moan, and turned pathetically to
his wife, but she cheered him with a laugh.</p>

<p>"They've only walked up from the station with May," she said.
"They won't come in. You'll see!"</p>

<p>Relieved, Mr. Parcher turned again to speak to Jane&mdash;but she
was not there. He caught but a glimpse of her, running up the
street as fast as she could, hand in hand with her companion.</p>

<p>"Run, Rannie, run!" panted Jane. "I got to get home an' tell
mamma about it before Willie. I bet I ketch Hail Columbia, anyway,
when he does get there!"</p>

<p>And in this she was not mistaken: she caught Hail Columbia. It
lasted all afternoon.</p>

<p>It was still continuing after dinner. Thatt evening, when an
oft-repeated yodel, followed by a shrill-wailed, "Jane-ee! Oh,
Jane-<em>NEE-</em>ee!" brought her to an open window down-stairs.
In the early dusk she looked out upon the washed face of Rannie
Kirsted, who stood on the lawn below.</p>

<p>"Come on out, Janie. Mamma says I can stay outdoors an' play
till half past eight."</p>

<p>Jane shook her head. "I can't. I can't go outside the house till
to-morrow. It's because we walked after Willie with our stummicks
out o' joint."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" Rannie cried, lightly. "My mother didn't do anything
to me for that."</p>

<p>"Well, nobody told her on you," said Jane, reasonably.</p>

<p>"Can't you come out at all?" Rannie urged. "Go ask your mother.
Tell her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can I," Jane inquired, with a little heat, "when she isn't
here to ask? She's gone out to play cards&mdash;she and papa."</p>

<p>Rannie swung her foot. "Well," she said, "I guess I haf to find
SOMEp'n to do! G' night!"</p>

<p>With head bowed in thought she moved away, disappearing into
the gray dusk, while Jane, on her part, left the window and went
to the open front door. Conscientiously, she did not cross the
threshold, but restrained herself to looking out. On the steps
of the porch sat William, alone, his back toward the house.</p>

<p>"Willie?" said Jane, softly; and, as he made no response, she
lifted her voice a little. "Will-ee!"</p>

<p>"Whatchwant!" he grunted, not moving.</p>

<p>"Willie, I told mamma I was sorry I made you feel so bad."</p>

<p>"All right!" he returned, curtly.</p>

<p>"Well, when I haf to go to bed, Willie," she said, "mamma told
me because I made you feel bad I haf to go up-stairs by myself,
to-night."</p>

<p>She paused, seeming to hope that he would say something, but
he spake not.</p>

<p>"Willie, I don't haf to go for a while yet, but when I do&mdash;maybe
in about a half an hour &mdash;I wish you'd come stand at the
foot of the stairs till I get up there. The light's lit up-stairs,
but down around here it's kind of dark."</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Will you, Willie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all <em>RIGHT!" </em>he said.</p>

<p>This contented her, and she seated herself so quietly upon the
floor, just inside the door, that he ceased to be aware of her,
thinking she had gone away. He sat staring vacantly into the darkness,
which had come on with that abruptness which begins to be noticeable
in September. His elbows were on his knees, and his body was sunk
far forward in an attitude of desolation.</p>

<p>The small noises of the town&mdash;that town so empty to-night&mdash;fell
upon his ears mockingly. It seemed to him incredible that so hollow
a town could go about its nightly affairs just as usual. A man
and a woman, going by, laughed loudly at something the man had
said: the sound of their laughter was horrid to William. And from
a great distance from far out in the country&mdash;there came the faint,
long-drawn whistle of an engine.</p>

<p>That was the sorrowfulest sound of all to William. His lonely
mind's eye sought the vasty spaces to the east; crossed prairie,
and river, and hill, to where a long train whizzed onward through
the dark&mdash;farther and farther and farther away. William uttered
a sigh, so hoarse, so deep from the tombs, so prolonged, that
Jane, who had been relaxing herself at full length upon the floor,
sat up straight with a jerk.</p>

<p>But she was wise enough not to speak.</p>

<p>Now the full moon came masquerading among the branches of the
shade-trees; it came in the likeness of an enormous football,
gloriously orange. Gorgeously it rose higher, cleared the trees,
and resumed its wonted impersonation of a silver disk. Here was
another mockery: What was the use of a moon <em>NOW</em>?</p>

<p>Its use appeared straightway.</p>

<p>In direct coincidence with that rising moon, there came from
a little distance down the street the sound of a young male voice,
singing. It was not a musical voice, yet sufficiently loud; and
it knew only a portion of the words and air it sought to render,
but, upon completing the portion it did know, it instantly began
again, and sang that portion over and over with brightest patience.
So the voice approached the residence of the Baxter family, singing
what the shades of night gave courage to sing&mdash;instead of whistle,
as in the abashing sunlight.</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<p>"My countree, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liber-tee, My countree,
'tis of thee, Sweet land of liber-tee, My countree, 'tis of thee,
Sweet land of liber-tee, My countree, 'tis of thee, Sweet land
of liber-tee, My countree, 'tis&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jane spoke unconsciously. "It's Freddie," she said.</p>

<p>William leaped to his feet; this was something he could <em>NOT
</em>bear! He made a bloodthirsty dash toward the gate, which
the singer was just in the act of passing.</p>

<p>"You <em>GET OUT O' HERE!" </em>William roared.</p>

<p>The song stopped. Freddie Banks fled like a rag on the wind.</p>

<p>... Now here is a strange matter.</p>

<p>The antique prophets prophesied successfully; they practised
with some ease that art since lost but partly rediscovered by
M. Maeterlinck, who proves to us that the future already exists,
simultaneously with the present. Well, if his proofs be true,
then at this very moment when William thought menacingly of Freddie
Banks, the bright air of a happy June evening&mdash;an evening ordinarily
reckoned ten years, nine months and twenty-one days in advance
of this present sorrowful evening&mdash;the bright air of that happy
June evening, so far in the future, was actually already trembling
to a wedding-march played upon a church organ; and this selfsame
Freddie, with a white flower in his buttonhole, and in every detail
accoutred as a wedding usher, was an usher for this very William
who now (as we ordinarily count time) threatened his person.</p>

<p>But for more miracles:</p>

<p>As William turned again to resume his meditations upon the steps,
his incredulous eyes fell upon a performance amazingly beyond
fantasy, and without parallel as a means to make scorn of him.
Not ten feet from the porch&mdash;and in the white moonlight that made
brilliant the path to the gate &mdash;Miss Mary Randolph Kirsted
was walking. She was walking with insulting pomposity in her most
pronounced semicircular manner.</p>

<p>"<em>YOU GET OUT O' HERE!" </em>she said, in a voice as deep
and hoarse as she could make it. "<em>YOU GET OUT O' HERE</em>!"</p>

<p>Her intention was as plain as the moon. She was presenting in
her own person a sketch of William, by this means expressing her
opinion of him and avenging Jane.</p>

<p>"<em>YOU GET OUT O' HERE!" </em>she croaked.</p>

<p>The shocking audacity took William's breath. He gasped; he sought
for words.</p>

<p>"Why, you&mdash;you&mdash;" he cried. "You&mdash;you sooty-faced little girl!"</p>

<p>In this fashion he directly addressed Miss Mary Randolph Kirsted
for the first time in his life.</p>

<p>And that was the strangest thing of this strange evening. Strangest
because, as with life itself, there was nothing remarkable upon
the surface of it. But if M. Maeterlinck has the right of the
matter, and if the bright air of that June evening, almost eleven
years in the so-called future, was indeed already trembling to
"Lohengrin," then William stood with Johnnie Watson against a
great bank of flowers at the foot of a church aisle; that aisle
was roped with white-satin ribbons; and William and Johnnie were
waiting for something important to happen. And then, to the strains
of "Here Comes the Bride," it did&mdash;a stately, solemn, roseate,
gentle young thing with bright eyes seeking through a veil for
William's eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, if great M. Maeterlinck is right, it seems that William
ought to have caught at least some eerie echo of that wedding-march,
however faint&mdash;some bars or strains adrift before their time upon
the moonlight of this September night in his eighteenth year.</p>

<p>For there, beyond the possibility of any fate to intervene, or
of any later vague, fragmentary memory of even Miss Pratt to impair,
there in that moonlight was his future before him.</p>

<p>He started forward furiously. "You&mdash;you&mdash;you little&mdash;"</p>

<p>But he paused, not wasting his breath upon the empty air.</p>

<p>His bride-to-be was gone.</p>
