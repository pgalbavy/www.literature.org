<p><em>BUT </em>while riding across the level plain, Herbert Watrous
did a good deal of thinking, and strove hard to fix upon the wisest
course to benefit the missing Nick.</p>

<p>Now, as I have intimated, nothing could be clearer than the foolhardiness
of trying to outwit the criminals, or to aid his friend by his
own shrewdness. They had made a prisoner of the youth, who Herbert
knew was his superior in every respect, and could well afford
to laugh at the utmost he essayed to do.</p>

<p>Without attempting to answer the many questions that presented
themselves, he confined his speculation to one or two bearing
directly upon the important business on which he was engaged.</p>

<p>Admitting that Bell Rickard, the crooked dealer in horse-flesh,
had made a prisoner of Nick Ribsam, it followed that he held no
intention of doing him immediate harm. Had his anger been as deep
and resentful as supposed, he would have shot him down at sight,
instead of taking him on a long ride. Herbert shuddered at the
thought that possibly he meant to prolong his suffering and torture,
as do the American Indians in the case of their captives, and
that his revenge would be carried out that evening. This theory,
however, was so violent that it caused the youth less worriment
than would be supposed. He could not believe that Rickard held
any such shocking purpose. This brought Herbert back to his former
belief that the frugal criminal was managing things with a view
of forcing a ransom from the friends of his prisoner. While he
saw numerous objections to the idea, he decided to act upon it.
He meant to ride straight into the camp of the thieves, and demand
their reason for what they had done.</p>

<p>If Rickard would agree to release Nick for a reasonable sum,
Herbert would gladly pay it. He had considerable money with him,
and, if that proved insufficient, he could give him drafts that
would be honored in San Antonio, Santa Fé, or San Francisco. It
will be remembered that Mr. Watrous had liberally provided for
his son in this respect.</p>

<p>Should Rickard accept the proposition, he would still hold the
whip hand, in case he chose to betray both boys; but it was idle
to speculate. Time enough to face the varying conditions as they
presented themselves.</p>

<p>By the time this decision crystallized in the mind of Herbert,
the afternoon was half gone, and he had ridden a good many miles.
He had seen no water, and, though he allowed Jill to rest himself
by walking at times, yet he forced him to the verge of imprudence.
Both he and his master were thirsty and hungry, but had to wait
a convenient season before attending to their wants.</p>

<p>At intervals, he had raised his glass and studied the party,
well in advance, but, as he was on their trail, this was not necessary,
and a couple of hours passed without his doing so. He was so absorbed
in his thoughts that he rode at the easy, swinging gait which
Jill could maintain for a long time without fatigue, paying no
attention to his surroundings.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far along, and he was drawing near the ridge
that had seemed so near ever since starting, when he roused himself
with the thought that he must keep his senses about him, and cease
the speculating and daydreaming in which he had indulged so long.</p>

<p>His first natural act was to look ahead for the horsemen, but
the unaided eye could not see them. The helpful field glass was
then levelled, and he scanned the base of the hills from a point
well to the south, along his front, and a considerable way to
the north, but was surprised to observe nothing of them.</p>

<p>"They have ridden in among the hills, where they are out of sight,
but that will make little difference, as long as I stick to their
trail——"</p>

<p>He checked his utterance in dismay, for, looking down at the
ground, he discovered that he was not on the track of the party
at all. While rapt in a brown study, his pony had left it, and
the anxious eyes which scanned the prairie on all sides failed
to detect the first imprint of a horse’s hoofs.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a pretty pass!" he exclaimed impatiently, as he
reined up; "I left it to you, Jill, not doubting that you would
attend to business; but, after all, it was my own fault."</p>

<p>Reflection, however, convinced him that the case was not so bad
after all. He could not be far astray, and he decided to press
on toward the hills, and gallop along their base, until he struck
the missing trail.</p>

<p>That which caused him anxiety was the lateness of the hour. The
top of the ridge already shut the sun from sight, and, ere long,
night would close over the scene, so obscuring the footprints
that further search must be hopeless.</p>

<p>It was this fact which caused him to touch his spur sharply against
the side of Jill, and force him to a pace that he would not have
done in his tired condition, but for the urgency of the case.</p>

<p>Jill responded gamely to the demand, galloping with a speed that
caused the still wind to whistle by the rider’s face. The hills
were so close that a half hour carried him to the base, and he
once more brought the animal down to a walk.</p>

<p>It was now a question whether he was too far north or too far
to the south of the point of entrance by the party in advance.
If he should err, there was not enough daylight remaining to correct
the mistake; he would of necessity be forced to wait until morning
before going on.</p>

<p>Since he had to guess at it, he acted on the theory that he had
struck the ridge to the south. He therefore wheeled his pony to
the right, and touched him into a leisurely canter, while he kept
his eyes fixed on the ground, as it swept under the hoofs of the
animal.</p>

<p>It was certainly remarkable that Herbert’s thoughts remained
so fixed upon what was in front that he gave little or no attention
to the rear. Once, it is true, he glanced back over the long space
ridden during the day, and noted that the ridge, which had been
the scene of his stirring experience of the previous night, was
fast fading from sight; but the survey was so brief and hasty
that it failed to take in an important feature in which he was
directly concerned.</p>

<p>Better fortune attended his search than he anticipated, for he
had ridden only a little way when he struck the footprints of
the horses. It was still so light that he could readily detect
them without dismounting, but that there should be no mistake,
he slipped from the saddle, and, holding the bridle in one hand,
walked several rods, carefully studying the marks in the earth.</p>

<p>He was right. It was easy to see that six horses had passed that
way but a short time before. Two of them must have been the pack
animals, while the others included Nick Ribsam’s Jack, and the
three belonging to Bell Rickard and his two companions.</p>

<p>Their course along the eastern base of the hills showed the riders
were searching for a favorable point of entrance. This looked
as if the party was not fully familiar with the section, though
it was by no means certain this was so.</p>

<p>Herbert began to feel misgivings, as he observed the twilight
deepening into darkness, while the trail still kept the same course,
varying a little now and then to the right or left with the changing
course of the elevation.</p>

<p>By and by, the gloom became so pronounced that he drew his pony
down to a walk, and, leaning over the saddle, studied the ground
with the closest scrutiny. It was not long before this proved
insufficient and he again dismounted.</p>

<p>"It makes slow work," he said, "but it is sure—well, I’ll be
hanged!"</p>

<p>Again there were no footprints before him! The ground showed
not the least impression when he struck a match and stooped over.</p>

<p>"We can’t be far off the track, Jill; we must now take the back
trail, as the hunters say."</p>

<p>Holding the bridle in his left hand, he began carefully retracing
his steps; but, instead of hunting for the path, he looked for
the point where it had turned in among the hills. This must be
close at hand, for the footprints were lost only a short time
before.</p>

<p>He had advanced a little more than a hundred yards, when he observed
an opening among the stunted vegetation and bowlders wide enough
to allow a horse to pass through without trouble.</p>

<p>"This looks as if it might be the right place," he said, stopping
and scrutinizing it; "we’ll soon find out."</p>

<p>Another lucifer was called into play. He bent down, holding it
before his head; and, as the tiny flame spread, he uttered an
exclamation of delight. He had recovered the trail!</p>
