<p>"SO <em>YOU </em>haven’t changed your mind, young man," said
Gates, as Tom presented himself at the hotel the following evening.</p>

<p>"No," said Tom, "I’m in earnest. When do you start?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow at ten."</p>

<p>"I will be on hand."</p>

<p>"By the way, what is your name? How shall we call you?"</p>

<p>The time had come for Tom to test the correctness of his suspicions.
Fixing his eyes, but not with obtrusive attention, on the man
he suspected, he answered carelessly:</p>

<p>"You may call me Tom Lincoln."</p>

<p>Morton started and turned swiftly toward our hero.</p>

<p>"What name did you say?"</p>

<p>"Tom Lincoln."</p>

<p>"I once knew a man of that name," said Morton hesitatingly. "From
what State do you come?"</p>

<p>"Our family originated in Massachusetts," answered Tom, not appearing
to notice anything in the other’s manner. "I believe the name
is a common one."</p>

<p>"Very likely," said Morton, recovering himself, convinced that
it was only an accidental coincidence. He was naturally suspicious,
not knowing what steps might have been taken to secure him. It
seemed improbable, however, that a mere boy like Tom should know
anything of his crime or have any connection with the efforts
to capture him. It may be added that his secret was known to no
one in California except our hero. Gates was an acquaintance he
had picked up and made a companion from his need of society, but
this chosen comrade knew nothing of him save what he had chosen
to tell, and sincerely believed that Morton was his real name.</p>

<p>They did not occupy the same room at the hotel. Gates had proposed
it, but Morton had not encouraged the idea. He said that he was
a light sleeper and always accustomed to room alone, and Gates
acquiesced.</p>

<p>When Morton was alone in his chamber, after disrobing himself,
he unclasped from around his waist a belt which had been made
expressly for his use. Opening it, he drew forth a quantity of
papers and carefully examined them. It is not my intention to
mystify the reader. These were the papers which had been taken
from his employer, and for the lack of which that employer had
been compelled to fail. They represented an aggregate value of
eighty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Morton looked them over carefully, as I have said.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are all here," he said thoughtfully. "I wish I could
turn them into cash; at present they do me no good. I wish I could
with safety dispose of them, but no doubt an accurate list has
been furnished to the detectives. Meanwhile they are a great care
to me. I am compelled to carry them round with me all the time.
I don’t dare to leave them on deposit at any bank lest they should
be identified as stolen property."</p>

<p>Here there was a knock at the door. Morton turned pale, and huddled
the papers into the bed near by. Then with a perturbed look he
opened the door to Gates.</p>

<p>"What’s the matter, Morton?" he said. "You look startled. Did
you think I was a burglar?"</p>

<p>Morton responded with a forced laugh.</p>

<p>"I was plunged in thought," he said, "and your knock startled
me. Will you come in?"</p>

<p>"A minute, if you don’t mind. Have you any matches? I have none
in my room. I rang the bell, but nobody came."</p>

<p>"Yes, there are some. Help yourself."</p>

<p>Gates, not suspecting how unwelcome his visit was, sat down and
lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"Is smoking offensive to you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, in a bedroom."</p>

<p>"Out it goes then. I suppose you were thinking of the fortunes
we are going to make."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Morton, who didn’t care to divulge his real
thoughts.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Gates, "I hope your bed is better than mine.
Mine is as hard as a brick."</p>

<p>As he spoke he reached out his hand and touched the quilt, directly
over the spot where the papers were concealed.</p>

<p>"Don’t do that," said Morton nervously.</p>

<p>"Don’t do what," asked Gates staring.</p>

<p>"I may be silly," stammered Morton, "but I can’t bear to have
any one touch my bed."</p>

<p>Gates laughed.</p>

<p>"Why, man, you’re as nervous as a woman," he said.</p>

<p>"I suppose I am," said Morton, smiling in a forced manner</p>

<p>"Luckily for me I was born without nerves," said Gates. "It’s
a great blessing. Nothing disturbs me except—well, except the
want of money."</p>

<p>"It is uncomfortable," said Morton.</p>

<p>"You are rich, though. You don’t understand what it is."</p>

<p>"No, I am not, Gates. I’ve got a thousand dollars, and little
else—except some stocks that are well-nigh worthless."</p>

<p>"Well, I haven’t got any stocks—worthless or otherwise—to worry
me. I may have, by and by, if we are lucky at the gold-fields."</p>

<p>"Just so; that is what I am hoping. A thousand dollars won’t
go far here."</p>

<p>"I should think not. But I suppose you want to go to bed. So
good-night."</p>

<p>"I am glad he’s gone," said Morton to himself, when his companion
left the room. "Have I done right to encourage his intimacy? Is
there no fear that through him my secret may be divulged? Then,
there is that boy. It’s strange, by the way, that his name is
Lincoln—the same as mine. Perhaps he is a distant relation. However,
he is only a boy. There can’t be any harm in him."</p>

<p>It was not altogether true that Morton was reduced to a thousand
dollars in gold. He had about four times that sum remaining of
the cash he had purloined from his former employer. But in California,
as I have already said, this was an era of high prices, and though
this sum seemed considerable, it would soon melt away if Morton
did not find some way of earning more. He might have gone into
business in San Francisco with what money he had, but there was
always danger of being recognized in a city, the population of
which was reinforced every week or two by new emigrants from the
States. Under the circumstances the most feasible plan of increasing
his fortunes seemed to be to go to the mines. Could he only have
negotiated the valuable securities which he had brought away with
him, he would have made his way to Europe, settled down on the
Continent, and lived comfortably, provided with ample means. But,
as we know, the securities thus far had only occasioned him anxiety
and apprehension. He could not see his way clear to any benefit
to be derived from them, unless to negotiate for their return
in consideration of a liberal reward. He was not prepared, as
yet, to hazard the danger of such a course.</p>

<p>The night passed, and the next morning rose bright and clear.
The first part of the journey was to be performed in a stage-coach.
The last must be made with such aids as they could find.</p>

<p>At ten they started. Tom and Gates were in high spirits. Morton
was more sober. He had cares and anxieties from which they were
exempt.</p>

<p>Each of the three was provided with a revolver, for the country
was unsettled, and they were liable to meet with highwaymen. Tom
had no weapon of his own, but Gates, who had two, lent him one
of his. Tom secretly hoped that he might have a chance to use
it. He was of an age when adventure, even when accompanied by
peril, has a certain charm.</p>
