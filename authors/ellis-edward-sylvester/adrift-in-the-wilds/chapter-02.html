<p>"To-morrow we shall be home," said Elwood Brandon, addressing
his companion, although at the time he was looking out on the
moon-lit sea, in the direction of California.</p>

<p>"Yes; if nothing unexpected happens," replied his cousin, who
was pushing and drawing a large Newfoundland dog that lay at his
feet.</p>

<p>"And what can happen?" asked his cousin, turning abruptly toward
him.</p>

<p>"A hundred things. Suppose the boiler should blow up, we run
on a rock, take fire, or get struck by a squall&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Or be carried away in a balloon," was the impatient exclamation.
"One is just as likely to happen as the other."</p>

<p>"Hardly&mdash;heigh-ho!"</p>

<p>Howard at that moment had twined his feet around the neck of
Terror, the Newfoundland, and the mischievous dog, springing suddenly
to his feet, brought his master from his seat to the deck, which,
as a matter of course, made both of the cousins laugh.</p>

<p>"He did that on purpose," said Howard, recovering his position.</p>

<p>"Of course he did. You have been pestering him for the last half-hour,
and he is getting tired of it; but I may say, Howard, I shall
hardly be able to sleep to-night, I am so anxious to see father
and mother."</p>

<p>"So am I; a few years makes such a difference in us, while I
can't detect the least change in them."</p>

<p>"Except a few more gray hairs, or perhaps an additional wrinkle
or two. What's the matter with Tim?"</p>

<p>"Tim! O nothing, he seems to be meditating and smoking. Fact
is that is about all he has done since he has been with us."</p>

<p>"It's been a grand time for Tim, and I have no doubt he has enjoyed
the trip to and from California as much as either of us."</p>

<p>The subject of these remarks was seated a few feet away, his
arms folded, while he was looking with a vague, dreamy expression
out upon the great Pacific, stretching so many thousand miles
beyond them, rolling far off in each direction, until sky and
ocean blended in great gloom.</p>

<p>"Maybe he is looking for Asia," laughed Elwood in an undertone.</p>

<p>"More likely he is hoping to get a glimpse of Ireland, for he
would be as likely to look in that direction as any other. I say,
Tim!"</p>

<p>The Irishman did not heed the call until he was addressed the
second time in a louder tone than before, when he suddenly raised
his head.</p>

<p>"Whisht! what is it?"</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?"</p>

<p>"Nothin', I was dreaming."</p>

<p>"Dreaming! what about?"</p>

<p>"Begorrah but that was a qua'r dream, was that same one."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it."</p>

<p>"But it's onplaiasnt."</p>

<p>"Never mind, out with it."</p>

<p>"Well, thin, if I must tell yees, I was thinking that this owld
staamer was all on fire, and all of us passengers was jumping
around in the wather, pulling each other down, away miles into
the sea, till we was gone so long there wasn't a chance iver to
git up agin."</p>

<p>A strange fear thrilled both of the boys at the mention of this,
and they looked at each other a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"What put that into your head, Tim?"</p>

<p>"And it's just the question I was axing meself, for I never draamed
of such a thing in my life before, and it's mighty qua'r that
I should take a notion to do it now."</p>

<p>"It ain't worth talking about," said Elwood, showing an anxiety
to change the subject.</p>

<p>"Be yees going to bed to-night?"</p>

<p>"I don't feel a bit sleepy," replied Elwood. "I'd just as soon
sit up half the night as not."</p>

<p>"And so would I; it must be after eleven o'clock, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"It's near 'levin," replied Tim. "I'm not able to examine me
watch; and if I was, I couldn't tell very well, as it hasn't run
for a few months."</p>

<p>Howard took out his watch, but the moonlight was too faint for
him to distinguish the hands, and the three were content to let
the precise time remain a matter of conjecture.</p>

<p>"Tim, how close are we to land?" asked Elwood.</p>

<p>"I should say about the same distance that the land is from us,
and begorrah that's the best information I can give yees."</p>

<p>"I could see the mountains very plainly when the sun was setting,"
said Howard, "and it cannot be many miles away."</p>

<p>"What sort of a country is it off here?" pursued Elwood, pointing
in the direction of the land.</p>

<p>"It is wild and rocky, and there are plenty of Indians and wild
animals there."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked Elwood, in some amazement.</p>

<p>"I have taken the trouble to learn all about California that
I could before coming."</p>

<p>"I believe they have <em>gold</em> there?" said Elwood, in rather
a bantering vein.</p>

<p>"Tim can tell you more about that than I can, as he came to California
to hunt gold."</p>

<p>"How is that, Tim?"</p>

<p>"Begorrah, but he shpakes the truth. I wint up among the mountains
to hunt gowld."</p>

<p>"And what luck had you?"</p>

<p>"Luck, is it?" repeated the Irishman, with an expression of ludicrous
disgust. "Luck, does ye call it, to have your head cracked and
your shins smashed by the copper-skins, chawed up by the b'ars,
froze to death in the mountains, drowned in the rivers&mdash;that run
into the top of yer shanty when yer sound asleep&mdash;your feet gnawed
off by wolverines, as they call&mdash;and&mdash;but whisht! don't talk to
me of luck, and all the time ye never gets a sight of a particle
of gowld."</p>

<p>The boys laughed, Howard said:</p>

<p>"But your luck is not every one's, Tim; there have been plenty
who have made fortunes at the business."</p>

<p>"Yis, but they wasn't Tim O'Rooneys. He's not the man that was
born to be rich!"</p>

<p>"You're better satisfied where you are."</p>

<p>"Yis, thank God, that I've such a good home, and an ongrateful
dog would I baa if I should ask more."</p>

<p>"But, Elwood, it's getting late, and this night air begins to
feel chilly. It can't be far from midnight."</p>

<p>"I am willing; where's Terror? Ah! here he is; old fellow, come
along and keep faithful watch over your friends."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Tim O'Rooney, with a strange, husky intonation,
"you remember my dream about this steamer burning?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what of it?"</p>

<p>"It is coming thrue!"</p>

<p><em>He spoke the truth!</em></p>
