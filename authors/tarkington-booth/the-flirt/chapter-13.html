<p>Mr. Trumble's offices were heralded by a neat blazon upon the
principal door, "Wade J. Trumble, Mortgages and Loans"; and the
gentleman thus comfortably, proclaimed, emerging from that door
upon a September noontide, burlesqued a start of surprise at sight
of a figure unlocking an opposite door which exhibited the name,
"Ray Vilas," and below it, the cryptic phrase, "Probate Law."</p>

<p>"Water!" murmured Mr. Trumble, affecting to faint. "You ain't
going in <em>there</em>, are you, Ray?" He followed the other
into the office, and stood leaning against a bookcase, with his
hands in his pockets, while Vilas raised the two windows, which
were obscured by a film of smoke-deposit: there was a thin coat
of fine sifted dust over everything. "Better not sit down, Ray,"
continued Trumble, warningly. "You'll spoil your clothes and you
might get a client. That word `Probate' on the door ain't going
to keep 'em out forever. You recognize the old place, I s'pose?
You must have been here at least twice since you moved in. What's
the matter? Dick Lindley hasn't missionaried you into any idea
of <em>working</em>, has he? Oh, no, <em>I</em> see: the Richfield
Hotel bar has closed&mdash;you've managed to drink it all at last!"</p>

<p>"Have you heard how old man Madison is to-day?" asked Ray, dusting
his fingers with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Somebody told me yesterday he was about the same. He's not going
to get well."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" Ray spoke quickly.</p>

<p>"Stroke too severe. People never recover&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they do, too."</p>

<p>Trumble began hotly: "I beg to dif&#11834;" but checked himself,
manifesting a slight confusion. "That is, I know they don't. Old
Madison may live a while, if you call that getting well; but he'll
never be the same man he was. Doctor Sloane says it was a bad
stroke. Says it was `induced by heat prostration and excitement.'
`Excitement!'" he repeated with a sour laugh. "Yep, I expect a
man could get all the excitement he wanted in <em>that</em> house,
especially if he was her daddy. Poor old man, I don't believe
he's got five thousand dollars in the world, and look how she
dresses!"</p>

<p>Ray opened a compartment beneath one of the bookcases, and found
a bottle and some glasses. "Aha," he muttered, "our janitor doesn't
drink, I perceive. Join me?" Mr. Trumble accepted, and Ray explained,
cheerfully: "Richard Lindley's got me so cowed I'm afraid to go
near any of my old joints. You see, he trails me; the scoundrel
has kept me sober for whole days at a time, and I've been mortified,
having old friends see me in that condition; so I have to sneak
up here to my own office to drink to Cora, now and then. You mustn't
tell him. What's she been doing to <em>you</em>, lately?"</p>

<p>The little man addressed grew red with the sharp, resentful memory.
"Oh, nothing! Just struck me in the face with her parasol on the
public street, that's all!" He gave an account of his walk to
church with Cora. "I'm through with that girl!" he exclaimed vindictively,
in conclusion. "It was the damnedest thing you ever saw in your
life: right in broad daylight, in front of the church. And she
laughed when she did it; you'd have thought she was knocking a
puppy out of her way. She can't do that to me twice, I tell you.
What the devil do you see to laugh at?"</p>

<p>"You'll be around," returned his companion, refilling the glasses,
"asking for more, the first chance she gives you. Here's her health!"</p>

<p>"I don't drink it!" cried Mr. Trumble angrily.</p>

<p>"And I'm through with her for good, I tell you! I'm not your
kind: I don't let a girl like that upset me till I can't think
of anything else, and go making such an ass of myself that the
whole town gabbles about it. Cora Madison's seen the last of me,
I'll thank you to notice. She's never been half-decent to me;
cut dances with me all last winter; kept me hanging round the
outskirts of every crowd she was in; stuck me with Laura and her
mother every time she had a chance; then has the nerve to try
to use me, so's she can make a bigger hit with a new man! You
can bet your head I'm through! She'll get paid though! Oh, she'll
get paid for it!"</p>

<p>"How?" laughed Ray.</p>

<p>It was a difficult question. "You wait and see," responded the
threatener, feebly. "Just wait and see. She's wild about this
Corliss, I tell you," he continued, with renewed vehemence. "She's
crazy about him; she's lost her head at last&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You mean he's going to avenge you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't, though he might, if she decided to marry him."</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Ray slowly, glancing over his glass at his
nervous companion, "it doesn't strike me that Mr. Valentine Corliss
has much the air of a marrying man."</p>

<p>"He has the air to <em>me</em>," observed Mr. Trumble, "of a
darned bad lot! But I have to hand it to him: he's a wizard. He's
got something besides his good looks&mdash;a man that could get Cora
Madison interested in `business'! In <em>oil</em>! Cora Madison!
How do you suppose&#11834;"</p>

<p>His companion began to laugh again. "You don't really suppose
he talked his oil business to her, do you, Trumble?"</p>

<p>"He must have. Else how could she&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Cora herself never talks upon any subject but one; she
never listens to any other either."</p>

<p>"Then how in thunder did he&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If Cora asks you if you think it will rain," interrupted Vilas,
"doesn't she really seem to be asking: `Do you love me? How much?'
Suppose Mr. Corliss is an expert in the same line. Of course he
can talk about oil!"</p>

<p>"He strikes me," said Trumble, "as just about the slickest customer
that ever hit this town. I like Richard Lindley, and I hope he'll
see his fifty thousand dollars again. <em>I</em> wouldn't have
given Corliss thirty cents."</p>

<p>"Why do you think he's a crook?"</p>

<p>"I don't say that," returned Trumble. "All <em>I</em> know about
him is that he's done some of the finest work to get fifty thousand
dollars put in his hands that I ever heard of. And all anybody
knows about him is that he lived here seventeen years ago, and
comes back claiming to know where there's oil in Italy. He shows
some maps and papers and gets cablegrams signed `Moliterno.' Then
he talks about selling the old Corliss house here, where the Madisons
live, and putting the money into his oil company: he does that
to sound plausible, but I have good reason to know that house
was mortgaged to its full value within a month after his aunt
left it to him. He'll not get a cent if it's sold. That's all.
And he's got Cora Madison so crazy over him that she makes life
a hell for poor old Lindley until he puts all he's saved into
the bubble. The scheme may be all right. How do <em>I</em> know?
There's no way to tell, without going over there, and Corliss
won't let anybody do that&mdash;oh, he's got a plausible excuse for
it! But I'm sorry for Lindley: he's so crazy about Cora, he's
soft. And she's so crazy about Corliss <em>she's</em> soft! Well,
I used to be crazy about her myself, but I'm not soft &mdash;I'm
not the Lindley kind of loon, thank heaven!"</p>

<p>"What kind are you, Trumble?" asked Ray, mildly.</p>

<p>"Not your kind either," retorted the other going to the door.
"She cut me on the street the other day; she's quit speaking to
me. If you've got any money, why don't you take it over to the
hotel and give it to Corliss? She might start speaking to <em>you</em>
again. I'm going to lunch!" He slammed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Ray Vilas, left alone, elevated his heels to the sill, and stared
out of the window a long time at a gravelled roof which presented
little of interest. He replenished his glass and his imagination
frequently, the latter being so stirred that when, about three
o'clock, he noticed the inroads he had made upon the bottle, tears
of self-pity came to his eyes. "Poor little drunkard!" he said
aloud. "Go ahead and do it. Isn't anything <em>you</em> won't
do!" And, having washed his face at a basin in a corner, he set
his hat slightly upon one side, picked up a walking stick and
departed jauntily, and, to the outward eye, presentably sober.</p>

<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss would be glad to see him, the clerk at
the Richfield Hotel reported, after sending up a card, and upon
Ray's following the card, Mr. Valentine Corliss in person confirmed
the message with considerable amusement and a cordiality in which
there was some mixture of the quizzical. He was the taller; and
the robust manliness of his appearance, his splendid health and
boxer's figure offered a sharp contrast to the superlatively lean
tippler. Corliss was humorously aware of his advantage: his greeting
seemed really to say, "Hello, my funny bug, here you are again!"
though the words of his salutation were entirely courteous; and
he followed it with a hospitable offer.</p>

<p>"No," said Vilas; "I won't drink with you." He spoke so gently
that the form of his refusal, usually interpreted as truculent,
escaped the other's notice. He also declined a cigar, apologetically
asking permission to light one of his own cigarettes; then, as
he sank into a velour-covered chair, apologized again for the
particular attention he was bestowing upon the apartment, which
he recognized as one of the suites de luxe of the hotel.</p>

<p>"`Parlour, bedroom, and bath,'" he continued, with a melancholy
smile; "and `Lachrymae,' and `A Reading from Homer.' Sometimes
they have `The Music Lesson,' or `Winter Scene' or `A Neapolitan
Fisher Lad' instead of `Lachrymae,' but they always have `A Reading
from Homer.' When you opened the door, a moment ago, I had a very
strong impression that something extraordinary would some time
happen to me in this room."</p>

<p>"Well," suggested Corliss, "you refused a drink in it."</p>

<p>"Even more wonderful than that," said Ray, glancing about the
place curiously. "It may be a sense of something painful that
already has happened here&mdash;perhaps long ago, before your occupancy.
It has a pathos."</p>

<p>"Most hotel rooms have had something happen in them," said Corliss
lightly. "I believe the managers usually change the door numbers
if what happens is especially unpleasant. Probably they change
some of the rugs, also."</p>

<p>"I feel&#11834;" Ray paused, frowning. "I feel as if some one had
killed himself here."</p>

<p>"Then no doubt some of the rugs <em>have</em> been changed."</p>

<p>"No doubt." The caller laughed and waved his hand in dismissal
of the topic. "Well, Mr. Corliss," he went on, shifting to a brisker
tone, "I have come to make my fortune, too. You are Midas. Am
I of sufficient importance to be touched?"</p>

<p>Valentine Corliss gave him sidelong an almost imperceptibly brief
glance of sharpest scrutiny&mdash;it was like the wink of a camera
shutter&mdash;but laughed in the same instant. "Which way do you mean
that?"</p>

<p>"You have been quick," returned the visitor, repaying that glance
with equal swiftness, "to seize upon the American idiom. I mean:
How small a contribution would you be willing to receive toward
your support!"</p>

<p>Corliss did not glance again at Ray; instead, he looked interested
in the smoke of his cigar. "`Contribution,'" he repeated, with
no inflection whatever. "`Toward my support.'"</p>

<p>"I mean, of course, how small an investment in your oil company."</p>

<p>"Oh, anything, anything," returned the promoter, with quick amiability.
"We need to sell all the stock we can."</p>

<p>"All the money you can get?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. It's really a colossal proposition, Mr. Vilas." Corliss
spoke with brisk enthusiasm. "It's a perfectly certain enormous
profit upon everything that goes in. Prince Moliterno cables me
later investigations show that the oil-field is more than twice
as large as we thought when I left Naples. He's on the ground
now, buying up what he can, secretly."</p>

<p>"I had an impression from Richard Lindley that the secret had
been discovered."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but only by a few, and those are trying to keep it
quiet from the others, of course."</p>

<p>"I see. Does your partner know of your success in raising a large
investment?"</p>

<p>"You mean Lindley's? Certainly." Corliss waved his hand in light
deprecation. "Of course that's something, but Moliterno would
hardly be apt to think of it as very large! You see he's putting
in about five times that much, himself, and I've already turned
over to him double it for myself. Still, it counts&mdash;certainly;
and of course it will be a great thing for Lindley."</p>

<p>"I fear," Ray said hesitatingly, "you won't be much interested
in my drop for your bucket. I have twelve hundred dollars in the
world; and it is in the bank &mdash;I stopped there on my way
here. To be exact, I have twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars
and fifty-one cents. My dear sir, will you allow me to purchase
one thousand dollars' worth of stock? I will keep the two hundred
and forty-seven dollars and fifty-one cents to live on &mdash;I
may need an egg while waiting for you to make me rich. Will you
accept so small an investment?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Corliss, laughing. "Why not? You may as well
profit by the chance as any one. I'll send you the stock certificates&mdash;we
put them at par. I'm attending to that myself, as our secretary,
Mr. Madison, is unable to take up his duties."</p>

<p>Vilas took a cheque-book and a fountain-pen from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Oh, any time, any time," said Corliss cheerfully, observing
the new investor's movement.</p>

<p>"Now, I think," returned Vilas quietly. "How shall I make it
out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, to me, I suppose," answered Corliss indifferently. "That
will save a little trouble, and I can turn it over to Moliterno,
by cable, as I did Lindley's. I'll give you a receipt&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You need not mind that," said Ray. "Really it is of no importance."</p>

<p>"Of course the cheque itself is a receipt," remarked Corliss,
tossing it carelessly upon a desk. "You'll have some handsome
returns for that slip of paper, Mr. Vilas."</p>

<p>"In that blithe hope I came," said Ray airily.</p>

<p>"I am confident of it. I have my own ways of divination, Mr.
Corliss. I have gleams." He rose as if to go, but stood looking
thoughtfully about the apartment again. "Singular impression,"
he murmured. "Not exactly as if I'd seen it in a dream; and yet&mdash;and
yet&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You have symptoms of clairvoyance at times, I take it." The
conscious, smooth superiority of the dexterous man playing with
an inconsequent opponent resounded in this speech, clear as the
humming of a struck bell; and Vilas shot him a single open glance
of fire from hectic eyes. For that instant, the frailer buck trumpeted
challenge. Corliss&mdash;broad-shouldered, supple of waist, graceful
and strong&mdash;smiled down negligently; yet the very air between
the two men seemed charged with an invisible explosive. Ray laughed
quickly, as in undisturbed good nature; then, flourishing his
stick, turned toward the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, it isn't clairvoyance&mdash;no more than when I told you
that your only real interest is women." He paused, his hand upon
the door-knob. "I'm a quaint mixture, however: perhaps I should
be handled with care."</p>

<p>"Very good of you," laughed Corliss&mdash;"this warning. The afternoon
I had the pleasure of meeting you I think I remember your implying
that you were a mere marionette."</p>

<p>"A haggard harlequin!" snapped Vilas, waving his hand to a mirror
across the room. "Don't I look it?" And the phrase fitted him
with tragic accuracy. "You see? What a merry wedding-guest I'll
be! I invite you to join me on the nuptial eve."</p>

<p>"Thanks. Who's getting married: when the nuptial eve?"</p>

<p>Ray opened the door, and, turning, rolled his eyes fantastically.
"Haven't you heard?" he cried. "When Hecate marries John Barleycorn!"
He bowed low. "Mr. Midas, adieu."</p>

<p>Corliss stood in the doorway and watched him walk down the long
hall to the elevator. There, Ray turned and waved his hand, the
other responding with gayety which was not assumed: Vilas might
be insane, or drunk, or both, but the signature upon his cheque
was unassailable.</p>

<p>Corliss closed the door and began to pace his apartment thoughtfully.
His expression manifested a peculiar phenomenon. In company, or
upon the street, or when he talked with men, the open look and
frank eyes of this stalwart young man were disarming and his most
winning assets. But now, as he paced alone in his apartment, now
that he was not upon exhibition, now when there was no eye to
behold him, and there was no reason to dissimulate or veil a single
thought or feeling, his look was anything but open; the last trace
of frankness disappeared; the muscles at mouth and eyes shifted;
lines and planes intermingled and altered subtly; there was a
moment of misty transformation&mdash;and the face of another man emerged.
It was the face of a man uninstructed in mercy; it was a shrewd
and planning face: alert, resourceful, elaborately perceptive,
and flawlessly hard. But, beyond all, it was the face of a man
perpetually on guard.</p>

<p>He had the air of debating a question, his hands in his pockets,
his handsome forehead lined with a temporary indecision. His sentry-go
extended the length of his two rooms, and each time he came back
into his bedroom his glance fell consideringly upon a steamer-trunk
of the largest size, at the foot of his bed. The trunk was partially
packed as if for departure. And, indeed, it was the question of
departure which he was debating.</p>

<p>He was a man of varied dexterities, and he had one faculty of
high value, which had often saved him, had never betrayed him;
it was intuitive and equal to a sixth sense: he always knew when
it was time to go. An inner voice warned him; he trusted to it
and obeyed it. And it had spoken now, and there was his trunk
half-packed in answer. But he had stopped midway in his packing,
because he had never yet failed to make a clean sweep where there
was the slightest chance for one; he hated to leave a big job
before it was completely finished&mdash;and Mr. Wade Trumble had refused
to invest in the oil-fields of Basilicata.</p>

<p>Corliss paused beside the trunk, stood a moment immersed in thought;
then nodded once, decisively, and, turning to a dressing-table,
began to place some silver-mounted brushes and bottles in a leather
travelling-case.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the outer door. He frowned, set down what
he had in his hands, went to the door and opened it to find Mr.
Pryor, that plain citizen, awaiting entrance.</p>

<p>Corliss remained motionless in an arrested attitude, his hand
upon the knob of the opened door. His position did not alter;
he became almost unnaturally still, a rigidity which seemed to
increase. Then he looked quickly behind him, over his shoulder,
and back again, with a swift movement of the head.</p>

<p>"No," said Pryor, at that. "I don't want you. I just thought
I'd have two minutes' talk with you. All right?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Corliss quietly. "Come in." He turned carelessly,
and walked away from the door keeping between his guest and the
desk. When he reached the desk, he turned again and leaned against
it, his back to it, but in the action of turning his hand had
swept a sheet of note-paper over Ray Vilas's cheque&mdash;a too conspicuous
oblong of pale blue. Pryor had come in and closed the door.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he began, regarding the other through his glasses,
with steady eyes, "that I'm going to interfere with you at all,
Corliss. I just happened to strike you &mdash;I wasn't looking
for you. I'm on vacation, visiting my married daughter that lives
here, and I don't want to mix in if I can help it."</p>

<p>Corliss laughed, easily. "There's nothing for you to mix in.
You couldn't if you wanted to."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope that's true," said Pryor, with an air of indulgence,
curiously like that of a teacher for a pupil who promises improvement.
"I do indeed. There isn't anybody I'd like to see turn straight
more than you. You're educated and cultured, and refined, and
smarter than all hell. It would be a big thing. That's one reason
I'm taking the trouble to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I told you I wasn't doing anything," said Corliss with a petulance
as oddly like that of a pupil as the other's indulgence was like
that of a tutor. "This is my own town; I own property here, and
I came here to sell it. I can prove it in half-a-minute's telephoning.
Where do you come in?"</p>

<p>"Easy, easy," said Pryor, soothingly. "I've just told you I don't
want to come in at all."</p>

<p>"Then what do you want?"</p>

<p>"I came to tell you just one thing: to go easy up there at Mr.
Madison's house."</p>

<p>Corliss laughed contemptuously. "It's <em>my</em> house. I own
it. That's the property I came here to sell."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," responded Pryor. "That part of it's all right.
But I've seen you several times with that young lady, and you
looked pretty thick, to me. You know you haven't got any business
doing such things, Corliss. I know your record from Buda Pesth
to Copenhagen and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"See here, my friend," said the younger man, angrily, "you may
be a tiptop spotter for the government when it comes to running
down some poor old lady that's bought a string of pearls in the
Rue de la Paix&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I've been in the service twenty-eight years," remarked Pryor,
mildly.</p>

<p>"All right," said the other with a gesture of impatience; "and
you got me once, all right. Well, that's over, isn't it? Have
I tried anything since?"</p>

<p>"Not in that line," said Pryor.</p>

<p>"Well, what business have you with any other line?" demanded
Corliss angrily. "Who made you general supervisor of public morals?
I want to know&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Now, what's the use your getting excited? I'm just here to tell
you that I'm going to keep an eye on you. I don't know many people
here, and I haven't taken any particular pains to look you up.
For all I know, you're only here to sell your house, as you say.
But I know old man Madison a little, and I kind of took a fancy
to him; he's a mighty nice old man, and he's got a nice family.
He's sick and it won't do to trouble him; but&mdash;honest, Corliss&mdash;if
you don't slack off in that neighbourhood a little, I'll have
to have a talk with the young lady herself."</p>

<p>A derisory light showed faintly in the younger man's eyes as
he inquired, softly: "That all, Mr. Pryor?"</p>

<p>"No. Don't try anything on out here. Not in <em>any</em> of your
lines."</p>

<p>"I don't mean to."</p>

<p>"That's right. Sell your house and clear out. You'll find it
healthy." He went to the door. "So far as I can see," he observed,
ruminatively, "you haven't brought any of that Moliterno crowd
you used to work with over to this side with you."</p>

<p>"I haven't seen Moliterno for two years," said Corliss, sharply.</p>

<p>"Well, I've said my say." Pryor gave him a last word as he went
out. "You keep away from that little girl."</p>

<p>"Ass!" exclaimed Corliss, as the door closed. He exhaled a deep
breath sharply, and broke into a laugh. Then he went quickly into
his bedroom and began to throw the things out of his trunk.</p>
