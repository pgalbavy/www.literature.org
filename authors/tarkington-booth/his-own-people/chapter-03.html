<p>It was some fair dream that would be gone too soon, he told himself,
as they drove rapidly through the twilight streets, down from
the Pincio and up the long slope of the Quirinal. They came to
a stop in the gray courtyard of a palazzo, and ascended in a sleepy
elevator to the fifth floor. Emerging, they encountered a tall
man who was turning away from the Countess' door, which he had
just closed. The landing was not lighted, and for a moment he
failed to see the American following Madame de Vaurigard.</p>

<p>"Eow, it's you, is it," he said informally. "Waitin' a devil
of a long time for you. I've gawt a message for you. <em>He's</em>
comin'. He writes that Cooley&mdash;"</p>

<p><em>"Attention!"</em> she interrupted under her breath, and,
stepping forward quickly, touched the bell. "I have brought a
frien' of our dear, droll Cooley with me to tea. Monsieur Mellin,
you mus' make acquaintance with Monsieur Sneyd. He is English,
but we shall forgive him because he is a such ole frien' of mine."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Mellin. "Remember seeing you on the boat, running
across the pond."</p>

<p>"Yes, ev coss," responded Mr. Sneyd cordially. "I wawsn't so
fawchnit as to meet you, but dyuh eold Cooley's talked ev you
often. Heop I sh'll see maw of you hyuh."</p>

<p>A very trim, very intelligent-looking maid opened the door, and
the two men followed Madame de Vaurigard into a square hall, hung
with tapestries and lit by two candles of a Brobdingnagian species
Mellin had heretofore seen only in cathedrals. Here Mr. Sneyd
paused.</p>

<p>"I weon't be bawthring you," he said. "Just a wad with you, Cantess,
and I'm off."</p>

<p>The intelligent-looking maid drew back some heavy curtains leading
to a salon beyond the hall, and her mistress smiled brightly at
Mellin.</p>

<p>"I shall keep him to jus' his one word," she said, as the young
man passed between the curtains.</p>

<p>It was a nobly proportioned room that he entered, so large that,
in spite of the amount of old furniture it contained, the first
impression it gave was one of spaciousness. Panels of carved and
blackened wood lined the walls higher than his head; above them,
Spanish leather gleamed here and there with flickerings of red
and gilt, reflecting dimly a small but brisk wood fire which crackled
in a carved stone fireplace. His feet slipped on the floor of
polished tiles and wandered from silky rugs to lose themselves
in great black bear skins as in unmown sward. He went from the
portrait of a "cinquecento" cardinal to a splendid tryptich set
over a Gothic chest, from a cabinet sheltering a collection of
old glass to an Annunciation by an unknown Primitive. He told
himself that this was a "room in a book," and became dreamily
assured that he was a man in a book. Finally he stumbled upon
something almost grotesquely out of place: a large, new, perfectly-appointed
card-table with a sliding top, a smooth, thick, green cover and
patent compartments.</p>

<p>He halted before this incongruity, regarding it with astonishment.
Then a light laugh rippled behind him, and he turned to find Madame
de Vaurigard seated in a big red Venetian chair by the fire.</p>

<p>She wore a black lace dress, almost severe in fashion, which
gracefully emphasized her slenderness; and she sat with her knees
crossed, the firelight twinkling on the beads of her slipper,
on her silken instep, and flashing again from the rings upon the
slender fingers she had clasped about her knee.</p>

<p>She had lit a thin, long Russian cigarette.</p>

<p>"You see?" she laughed. "I mus' keep up with the time. I mus'
do somesing to hold my frien's about me. Even the ladies like
to play now&mdash;that breedge w'ich is so tiresome&mdash;they play, play,
play! And you&mdash;you Americans, you refuse to endure us if we do
not let you play. So for my frien's when they come to my house&mdash;if
they wish it, there is that foolish little table. I fear"&mdash;she
concluded with a bewitching affectation of sadness&mdash;"they prefer
that to talkin' wiz me."</p>

<p>"You know that couldn't be so, <em>Comtesse</em>," he said. "I
would rather talk to you than&mdash;than&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, you say so, Monsieur!" She looked at him gravely; a
little sigh seemed to breathe upon her lips; she leaned forward
nearer the fire, her face wistful in the thin, rosy light, and
it seemed to him he had never seen anything so beautiful in his
life.</p>

<p>He came across to her and sat upon a stool at her feet. "On my
soul," he began huskily, "I swear&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laid her finger on her lips, shaking her head gently; and
he was silent, while the intelligent maid&mdash;at that moment entering&mdash;arranged
a tea-table and departed.</p>

<p>"American an' Russian, they are the worse," said the Countess
thoughtfully, as she served him with a generous cup, laced with
rum, "but the American he is the bes' to play <em>wiz</em>." Mellin
found her irresistible when she said "wiz."</p>

<p>"Why is that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the Russian play high, yes&mdash;but the American"&mdash;she laughed
delightedly and stretched her arms wide&mdash;"he make' it all a joke!
He is beeg like his beeg country. If he win or lose, he don' care!
Ah, I mus' tell you of my great American frien', that Honor-able
Chanlair Pedlow, who is comin' to Rome. You have heard of Honor-able
Chanlair Pedlow in America?"</p>

<p>"I remember hearing that name."</p>

<p>"Ah, I shall make you know him. He is a man of distinction; he
did sit in your Chamber of Deputies&mdash;what you call it?&mdash;yes, your
Con-gress. He is funny, eccentric&mdash;always he roar like a lion
&mdash;Boum!&mdash;but so simple, so good, a man of such fine heart&mdash;so
lovable!"</p>

<p>"I'll be glad to meet him," said Mellin coldly.</p>

<p>"An', oh, yes, I almos' forget to tell you," she went on, "your
frien', that dear Cooley, he is on his way from Monte Carlo in
his automobile. I have a note from him to-day."</p>

<p>"Good sort of fellow, little Cooley, in his way," remarked her
companion graciously. "Not especially intellectual or that, you
know. His father was a manufacturer chap, I believe, or something
of the sort. I suppose you saw a lot of him in Paris?"</p>

<p>"Eh, I thought he is dead!" cried Madame de Vaurigard.</p>

<p>"The father is. I mean, little Cooley."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she laughed softly. "We had some gay times, a little
party of us. We shall be happy here, too; you will see. I mus'
make a little dinner very soon, but not unless you will come.
You will?"</p>

<p>"Do you want me very much?"</p>

<p>He placed his empty cup on the table and leaned closer to her,
smiling. She did not smile in response; instead, her eyes fell
and there was the faintest, pathetic quiver of her lower lip.</p>

<p>"Already you know that," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>She rose quickly, turned away from him and walked across the
room to the curtains which opened upon the hall. One of these
she drew back.</p>

<p>"My frien', you mus' go now," she said in the same low voice.
"To-morrow I will see you again. Come at four an' you shall drive
with me&mdash;but not&mdash;not more&mdash;<em>now</em>. Please!"</p>

<p>She stood waiting, not looking at him, but with head bent and
eyes veiled. As he came near she put out a limp hand. He held
it for a few seconds of distinctly emotional silence, then strode
swiftly into the hall.</p>

<p>She immediately let the curtain fall behind him, and as he got
his hat and coat he heard her catch her breath sharply with a
sound like a little sob.</p>

<p>Dazed with glory, he returned to the hotel. In the lobby he approached
the glittering concierge and said firmly:</p>

<p>"What is the Salone Margherita? Cam you get me a box there to-night?"</p>
