<p>
This is the Land of the Pioneer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a life-long feud was healed;<br/>
Where the League of the Men whose Coats were Red<br/>
With the Men of the Woods whose Skins were Red<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was riveted, forged, and sealed.<br/>
Now, by the souls of our Silent Dead,<br/>
God save our sons from the League of Red!

</p>
<p>
Plough up the Land of Battle<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in our hazy hills;<br/>
Plough! to the lowing of cattle;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Plough! to the clatter of mills;<br/>
Follow the turning furrows'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold, where the deep loam breaks,<br/>
While the hand of the harrow burrows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Clutching the clod that cakes;<br/>
North and south on the harrow's line,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the bronzed pines' boughs,<br/>
The silvery flint-tipped arrows shine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of a thousand ploughs!

</p>
<p>
Plough us the Land of the Pioneer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the buckskinned rangers bled;<br/>
Where the Redcoats reeled from a reeking field,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And a thousand Red Men fled;<br/>
Plough us the land of the wolf and deer,<br/>
The land of the men who laughed at fear,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The land of our Martyred Dead!

</p>
<p>
Here where the ghost-flower, blowing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Grows from the bones below,<br/>
Patters the hare, unknowing,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Passes the cawing crow:<br/>
Shadows of hawk and swallow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadows of wind-stirred wood,<br/>
Dapple each hill and hollow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here where our dead men stood:<br/>
Wild bees hum through the forest vines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the bullets of England hummed,<br/>
And the partridge drums in the ringing pines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the drummers of England drummed.

</p>
<p>
This is the Land of the Pioneer,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a life-long feud was healed;<br/>
Where the League of the Men whose Coats were Red<br/>
With the Men of the Woods whose Skins were Red<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was riveted, forged, and sealed.<br/>
Now, by the blood of our Splendid Dead,<br/>
God save our sons from the League of Red!

<p><em>PREFACE</em></p>

<p>Those who read this romance for the sake of what history it may
contain will find the histories from which I have helped myself
more profitable.</p>

<p>Those antiquarians who hunt their hobbies through books had best
drop the trail of this book at the preface, for they will draw
but a blank covert in these pages. Better for the antiquarian
that he seek the mansion of Sir William Johnson, which is still
standing in Johnstown, New York, and see with his own eyes the
hatchet-scars in the solid mahogany banisters where Thayendanegea
hacked out polished chips. It would doubtless prove more profitable
for the antiquarian to thumb those hatchet-marks than these pages.</p>

<p>But there be some simple folk who read romance for its own useless
sake.</p>

<p>To such quiet minds, innocent and disinterested, I have some
little confidences to impart: There are still trout in the Kennyetto;
the wild ducks still splash on the Vlaie, where Sir William awoke
the echoes with his flintlock; the spot where his hunting-box
stood is still called Summer-House Point; and huge pike in golden-green
chain-mail still haunt the dark depths of the Vlaie water, even
on this fair April day in the year of our Lord 1900.</p>
