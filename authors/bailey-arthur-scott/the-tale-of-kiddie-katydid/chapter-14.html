<p>Old Mr. Crow flew into a terrible rage when he found, the next morning,
that his committee had not called on Kiddie Katydid during the night.
And when Chirpy Cricket told him that the weather was too cold for
anybody to stay out late, Mr. Crow said "Nonsense! What about Mr. Frog?"
</p>
<p>That was a hard question to answer. And Chirpy Cricket was so afraid of
angry Mr. Crow that he promptly hid himself among the roots of a clump
of grass.
</p><p>Now, the fact that Mr. Frog had been away from his shop the night before
set Mr. Crow to worrying.
</p><p>"That slippery tailor has been up to some mischief," Mr. Crow declared.
"And if he has played a trick on me I'll never hear the last of it."
</p><p>The old gentleman was so disturbed that he quite lost his appetite
during the rest of the day. And he moped and groaned about, hoping for
the best, but fearing the worst. One thing that made him especially
uneasy was the fact that when he called on Mr. Frog he found the tailor
in a gayer mood than he had ever known him to be in.
</p><p>Mr. Frog bounded about his shop like a rubber ball. And the worst of it
was, he <u>would</u> sing, although Mr. Crow begged him, with tears in his
eyes, to stop.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Mr. Frog asked him. "Don't you like my voice? Or is
it the songs I sing? I've a new one that I'd like to sing for you. It's
about one of the Katydid family; and I'm sure you'll enjoy hearing it."
</p><p>But Mr. Crow wouldn't stay there any longer. With a loud squawk of rage
he scurried away. He was sure, then, that Mr. Frog had tricked him.
</p><p>That night Mr. Crow's committee called on Kiddie Katydid. It was a fine,
warm, moonlight night. And as they drew near Farmer Green's place they
could hear Kiddie's shrill music, even while they were still a quarter
of a mile away.
</p><p>"He plays better than ever," said Freddie Firefly. "I wish Mr. Crow
could hear him." And they hurried on, believing that everything was
going to turn out all right, in the end.
</p><p>"Mr. Crow will be sorry, to-morrow, that he scolded us," said Chirpy
Cricket.
</p><p>But the committee met with a sad disappointment. When they invited
Kiddie Katydid to join the Pleasant Valley orchestra he told them that
he couldn't.
</p><p>"Why not?" Freddie Firefly asked.
</p><p>"I've promised somebody that I wouldn't," Kiddie said.
</p><p>And though they pressed him for an explanation, he wouldn't give them
any. He wouldn't say another word.
</p><p>It was a downcast company that left Farmer Green's front yard. And they
quarreled among themselves, too, before they parted. For there wasn't
one of them that was willing to tell Mr. Crow that Kiddie had declined
his invitation.
</p><p>But they finally hit upon a plan that suited everybody. They agreed to
get Mr. Crow's cousin, Jasper Jay, to break the news gently to the old
gentleman.
</p><p>It turned out that Jasper was delighted to undertake the task. He hoped
that Mr. Crow would fly into a passion when he heard the sad tale. And
Jasper was not disappointed. For old Mr. Crow was furious.
</p><p>"It's the work of that sly rascal, Mr. Frog!" he squalled. "He must have
called on Kiddie Katydid and hoodwinked him somehow.... I'd like to know
what he said."
</p><p>But Mr. Crow never found that out. So Kiddie Katydid had another secret,
which was known only to himself and Mr. Frog.
</p><p>And Mr. Frog wouldn't tell anybody, because he preferred to tease Mr.
Crow.
</p><p>And Kiddie Katydid wouldn't tell anybody, because he liked secrets. So
when people tried to pry into the affair, he just folded his wings
tightly over himself--and said nothing.
