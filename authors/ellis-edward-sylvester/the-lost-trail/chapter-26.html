<p>Having turned his back on his pursuers, Deerfoot gave them no
further attention.  His purpose now was to defend Jack Carleton
and Otto Relstaub from the two red men in pursuit.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the youthful warrior had fixed in
his own mind the course taken by the others, and he hastened to
a point where he was hopeful of finding the trail.  But the calculation
which led him thither was drawn too fine.  Like the detective
who spins a theory, perfect in every part and bristling with proof,
he found that a slight hitch at the beginning destroyed it all.
Neither the pursuers nor pursued had crossed the spot where he
was so certain he would discover their footprints.</p>

<p>This was a disappointment to Deerfoot, who stood several minutes
debating what to do.  It would require considerable time to return
point where he separated from the boys follow them thence, beside
placing him well to the rear of the red men from whom the harm
was dreaded.  It was this fact which disturbed Deerfoot, but there
seemed no other course open.  He could easily speculate as to
the routes by which to head off the warriors, but the mistake
just made warned him that he had no time guesses of that character.</p>

<p>Clearly the only thing to do was to follow the course named,
and with his usual promptitude, he moved through the wood toward
the point where he was more than likely to come into collision
with the larger party of Shawanoes.  He turned aside from his
own trail, as he invariably did under circumstances, but had not
gone far when he found that which was lost.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe halted and looked at the ground with a grim smile,
for he saw the print of the horse's hoof, the tracks made by Jack
and Otto, and the lighter impressions of two pain of moccasins.</p>

<p>Having caught sight of the warriors not long previous, he knew
they were at no great distance.  They were walking at such a leisurely
pace that unless it was increased, they were not likely to overtake
the unconscious fugitives before they halted for the night.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe wheeled and hurried along the trail, with the loping,
noiseless trot which could be maintained without distress from
rise of morn till set of sun.  He did not scrutinize the earth
directly at his feet, but glanced several rods in front.  He could
readily detect the trail that far, and was thus enabled to keep
keen watch of his surroundings, without retarding his own gait.</p>

<p>He occasionally flung a glance over his shoulder, but he was
well satisfied that none of the larger party was after him: they
had become impressed with the fact that it wouldn't pay.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile off and he leaped lightly over a small stream,
which crossed his path.  He paused long enough to learn that the
home had stopped to drink, doing so with some difficulty, for
the water was so shallow that his lips must have stirred the mud
on the bottom.</p>

<p>The boys did not halt, but one of the warriors had got down on
his knees and hands, the latter spread apart like the fore legs
of a camelopard, as to touch his dusky lips to the water, of which
he drank his fill.  All this Deerfoot noted, with only a few moments'
pause, then he was off again.</p>

<p>But he had gone only a little way, when he observed other facts
that were more disquieting.  The Shawanoes had changed pace similar
to his own, and beyond question were gaining upon the boys, who
could not know peril.  Deerfoot was convinced that the red men
had hastened through fear of losing the trail in the coming darkness.
It followed, therefore, that he himself must advance faster or
lose the scent.</p>

<p>While able to follow the tracks of a horse, entirely by the sense
of feeling, the progress must necessarily be too slow to be effective
under circumstances like those which now confronted him.</p>

<p>The youth made a tremendous bound and struck a gait which rendered
it unnecessary to look behind him, for no pursuer could equal
his speed.  He watched only the forest in front, through which
he was hurrying with a velocity that raised a gale about his ears
and kept him dodging and ducking his head to avoid unpleasant
consequences.</p>

<p>All at once, he leaped sideways behind the nearest large tree,
set down his rifle and bow and drew his tomahawk.  He had discovered
through the gathering twilight one of the Shawanoes returning
over the trail.  It was a fortunate accident which prevented him
detecting his pursuer, since he was on the watch against that
very danger, but Deerfoot was an instant quicker, and awaited
him as grimly as he confronted the two warriors who followed him
to the base of the hill, where one was pierced by his unerring
arrow.</p>

<p>Deerfoot at first believed both were coming back, having been
summoned thither perhaps by some signal from the larger party,
but he saw there was only one.  The youth could have picked him
off without difficulty, but he was too chivalrous to do so, inasmuch
as the red man was actually retreating instead of advancing, and
had not as yet made the first move against him.</p>

<p>A guarded peep from his hiding-place showed the warrior approaching
on a loping trot, similar to his own, his long rifle in his right
band, while a glimpse was obtained of his blanket rolled and strapped
like a knapsack behind his shoulders.</p>

<p>He held his head well forward, his restless eyes scanning the
wood as it opened before him, but evidently with no thought of
the danger which really menaced him.  All at once, the figure
of Deerfoot glided softly from behind the tree and confronted
him with his tomahawk drawn back and ready to throw.</p>

<p>The Indian checked himself as abruptly as if an unfathomable
chasm had opened at his feet, but quick as he was, Deerfoot was
so close that the latter could have touched him with his extended
bow.</p>

<p>The warrior, old enough to be the father of the other, saw that
he was helpless.  He was without the power to raise a finger to
save himself, even though he held a loaded rifle in one hand and
carried the regulation knife and tomahawk in his girdle.  Had
he made the first motion toward using his weapons, the upraised
tomahawk would have left the grasp of Deerfoot with the swiftness
of lightning, and the skull of his foe would have been cloven
as though made of tissue paper.</p>

<p>"Let the Shawanoe obey the words of Deerfoot," said the youth,
"and he shall not be harmed."</p>

<p>The other made no answer, but his frightened looks showed he
was ready to follow any orders received from such high authority.</p>

<p>"He carries a blanket on his back which Deerfoot would love to
have, that he may sleep upon it when the night is cold and he
has no camp-fire to warm him."</p>

<p>The elder Shawanoe dropped his gun to the ground beside him,
that he might use both bands more readily to unfasten the bundle
for his master.  Flinging it at his feet, he looked inquiringly
up and awaited the next command.</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not stoop to take the article, for that would have
invited a treacherous attack.  He merely glanced downward and
then asked, "Whither is my brother going?"</p>

<p>"He seeks those who sent him here; they are not far and we heard
the shout of one of our warriors, which we did not understand."</p>

<p>"'Twas his cry when the arrow of Deerfoot pierced his heart,"
said the youth with flashing eye.  "Deerfoot has crossed the great
river and means never to visit the other shore; he has left Kentucky
and Ohio, and the Shawanoes must look for his footprints on this
side. They cannot find him, and he will shoot them from behind
the trees and rocks.  He will flee from them no more."</p>

<p>The red man to whom these words were addressed could not fail
to understand their meaning.  They gave distinct notice that the
youth would strike back, whenever harm was offered him, while
west of the Mississippi.  He had located there for life and was
prepared to defend himself against one and all of his enemies.</p>

<p>Beyond question, the elder Indian would have given much could
he have been in Kentucky at that moment.  He was watching for
some chance to turn with panther-like quickness on his youthful
conqueror, but the latter took care that no such opportunity was
given him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot could not know that the group whom he left behind had
resolved to withdraw from the dangerous country, and while their
agreement would have been interesting and possibly gratifying
news to him, yet he was not particularly concerned, since he was
determined to force them sooner or later to that conclusion.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot took a gun that belonged to one of those who stole
his blanket and broke his canoe; his blanket has been restored
to him and he will now give the gun to his brother."</p>

<p>This statement was not understood by the other, which fact is
not to be wondered at, since it was not only in violation of what
may be called common sense, but the gun itself was not in sight.</p>

<p>It was within reach, however, and the youth had but to take a
single step backward, when he grasped it with his right hand and
proffered it to the other, whose very amazement caused him to
take it with much awkwardness.  Thus it came about that Deerfoot
allowed the warrior to have two rifles, both loaded, while he
stood guard over himself, with only his tomahawk in hand.</p>

<p>The transfer being made, the elder was at liberty to go, so soon
as he answered a few questions.  He knew much of Deerfoot from
reputation, and, therefore, was not so dumfounded as otherwise
he would have been, when informed that no harm would be done him.</p>

<p>"When my brother left his comrades, he took a warrior with him,"
said Deerfoot in his native tongue.  "Where is he?"</p>

<p>Daring as the young Shawanoe was, he was guarded to give up the
gun, until satisfied the second foe was not likely to appear on
the scene.  While he would have made his usual brilliant stand
against two of his enemies, he would have needed all the means
which he possessed to combat them.</p>

<p>"My brother waits my return; he sits on fallen tree and listens
for my footsteps that may learn what ill has befallen our brothers
nearer the great river."</p>

<p>"When my brother has learned and tells them what then will they
do?"</p>

<p>"They will hasten across the great river and never come back."</p>

<p>Deerfoot smiled faintly, for he saw the purpose of this remark;
the warrior was seeking to propitiate his conqueror.  The latter
might well have added that, inasmuch as he had already given him
the fact, the elder was in duty bound to turn about and hasten
to his waiting friend with the news; but it was too much to ask
him to accept the word of an enemy, and the youth preferred that
he should make the slight journey and ascertain the truth for
himself.</p>

<p>What followed was unique and curious.  Deerfoot stepped aside,
just enough to allow the other to pass.  The elder held a gun
in each hand and stood motionless a moment, as if uncertain what
to do; but his conqueror was waiting, and he, therefore, advanced
three steps, enough to bring him opposite Deerfoot, while the
fourth carried him beyond.  It was at that juncture he caught
sight of the long bow leaning against the tree where the gun had
been standing.  He longed to seize it, but he knew instant death
would follow the attempt.</p>

<p>Without turning to the right or left, the released Shawanoe strode
by with deliberate and dignified step.  He held his own gun in
his right hand, and with no evidence of what he was doing, he
stealthily drew back the hammer which clasped the flint.  He then
noted carefully the number of paces he took.</p>

<p>When he had counted nearly fifty, he felt safe from the crash
of the tomahawk.  Dropping the strange rifle to the ground, he
wheeled like a flash and sighted quickly at the spot where he
last saw his conqueror, but he had vanished.</p>
