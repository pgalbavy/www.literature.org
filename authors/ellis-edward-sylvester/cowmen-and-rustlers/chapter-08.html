<p>Monteith Sterry read the "warning" through in a voice without
the slightest tremor. Then he quietly smoked his cigar and looked
off in the moonlight, as though thinking of something of a different
nature.</p>

<p>It was natural that Jennie Whitney should be more impressed by
the occurrence, with the memory of the recent tragedy crushing
her to the earth. She exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Larch Cadmus! Why, Fred, he has visited our house several times;
he was here last week."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied her brother; "he has often sat at our table; and,
by the way, he is a great admirer of yours."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" was the response; "why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"It may be nonsense, but it is true, nevertheless. Your mother
noticed it; and, that there might be no mistake, Larch had the
impudence to tell me so himself."</p>

<p>"I never liked him; he is a bad man," said Jennie, much to the
relief of Sterry, who felt a little uncomfortable. "I did not
know he belonged to the rustlers."</p>

<p>"He was a cowboy until last fall. He had a quarrel with Col.
Ringgold and went off with the others, and has been on the blacklist
ever since."</p>

<p>"Why didn't he bring the message himself," continued the sister,
"instead of sending it?"</p>

<p>"He did," was the significant reply of the brother.</p>

<p>"What! That surely was not he?"</p>

<p>"It was. I knew his voice the moment he spoke; those whiskers
were false; he didn't want to be recognized, and I thought it
as well to humor his fancy, but I could not be mistaken."</p>

<p>"Now that I recall it, his voice <em>did</em> resemble Cadmus',"
said the sister, more thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Of course, and I can tell you something more; he was among the
rustlers with whom we had the fight yesterday. He did his best
to kill me, and came pretty near succeeding. It wasn't he, however,
who put the bullet through my arm, for I dropped that fellow."</p>

<p>"You frighten me!" was all that Jennie Whitney could say.</p>

<p>Sterry still smoked in silence. He was thinking hard, but it
was his turn to be startled by the next remark.</p>

<p>"Larch Cadmus hates you, Mont, not so much because you are the
enemy of all rustlers, but more because he believes my sister
holds you in higher esteem than she does him."</p>

<p>Sterry was clever enough to parry this compliment with considerable
skill.</p>

<p>"For the same reason he is jealous of every gentleman whom Miss
Whitney has ever met, for it would be a sorry tribute to any man's
worth if he did not stand higher in her regard than Larch Cadmus."</p>

<p>"Well spoken!" said the young lady, relieved from what threatened
to become an embarrassing situation for her.</p>

<p>Had her brother chosen he might have expressed what was in his
mind, but he had the good taste to refrain. None knew better than
he the deep, tender affection existing between his friend and
his sister, though it had not yet reached the point of avowal
and confession.</p>

<p>"Well, Mont, what are you going to do about it?" asked Whitney.</p>

<p>By way of reply, the latter twisted the "warning" into the form
of a lamplighter. Then he applied a match to one corner, and held
the paper until it had burned to the last fragment.</p>

<p>"That's my opinion of Mr. Larch Cadmus and his gang, and I shall
pay the same attention to them."</p>

<p>"You are not wise," ventured Jennie, who, with the awful memory
of the preceding day upon her, could not but shudder at the peril
to her friend, who had never been quite so near to her as during
the last few hours, when he showed so much tender sympathy for
her and her mother and brother in the depth of their desolation
and woe.</p>

<p>"I thank you," he said, with the same manly frankness he had
always shown; "I have no desire to appear as a boaster or to make
light of danger, but one of the truest adages is that it is not
the barking dog that does the biting."</p>

<p>"Don't make the mistake of supposing it is not so in this case,"
said Whitney, "and none should know it better than you."</p>

<p>"I do not underestimate the courage of those fellows; they will
shrink at nothing, but there is no more excuse for my running
away upon receiving such a warning than there would be for all
the inhabitants of Wyoming to leave the State at such a command."</p>

<p>"The case is not parallel," was the comment of Fred Whitney.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind that if I stay, as I intend to do, I do not mean
to sit down and wait for those rustlers to pick me off. I count
on having something to say and do in the matter; but, friends,
I must bid you good-night."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked the astonished Fred Whitney.</p>

<p>"I must leave," replied Sterry, rising to his feet; "I have already
staid too long."</p>
