<p>Shortly after we arrived at the village, they took away our watches,
our pocket-knives, and everything that we possessed of a similar
nature, and which they considered as curiosities. The chief wore
Orthis’ wristwatch above one fore-paw and mine above the other, but
as he did not know how to wind them, nor the purpose for which they
were intended, they did him or us no good. The result was, however,
that it was now entirely impossible for us to measure time in any
way, and I do not know, even to this day, how long we were in this
strange village. We ate when we were hungry, and slept when we were
tired. It was always daylight; and it seemed that there were always
raiding parties going out or returning, so that flesh was plentiful,
and we became rather reconciled to our fate, in so far as the
immediate danger of being eaten was concerned, but why they kept us
alive, as we had slain so many of their fellows, I could not
understand.
</p><p>It must have been immediately after we arrived that they made an
attempt to teach us their language. Two females were detailed for
this duty. We were given unlimited freedom within certain bounds,
which were well indicated by the several sentries which constantly
watched from the summit of hills surrounding the village. Past these
we could not go, nor do I know that we had any particular desire to
do so, since we realized only too well that there would be little
chance of our regaining the ship should we escape the village,
inasmuch as we had not the remotest idea in what direction it lay.
</p><p>Our one hope lay in learning their language, and then utilizing our
knowledge in acquiring some definite information as to the
surrounding country and the location of <u>The Barsoom</u>.
</p><p>It did not seem to take us very long to learn their tongue, though,
of course, I realize that it may really have been months. Almost
before we knew it, we were conversing freely with our captors. When I
say freely, it is possible that I exaggerate a trifle, for though we
could understand them fairly well, it was with difficulty that we
made ourselves understood, yet we managed it some way, handicapped as
we were by the peculiarities of the most remarkable language of which
I have any knowledge.
</p><p>It is a very difficult language to speak, and as a written language,
would be practically impossible. For example, there is their word <u>gue
-ho</u>, for which Orthis and I discovered twenty-seven separate and
distinct meanings, and that there are others I have little or no
doubt. Their speech is more aptly described as song, the meaning of
each syllable being governed by the note in which it is sung. They
speak in five notes, which we may describe as A, B, C, D and E. <u>Gu</u>
sung in A means something radically different from <u>gu</u> sung in E,
and again if <u>gu</u> is sung in A, followed by _e_ in G, it means
something other than if <u>gu</u> had been sung in D followed by _e_ in A.
</p><p>Fortunately for us, there are no words of over three syllables, and
most of them consist of only one or two, or we should have been
entirely lost. The resulting speech, however, is extremely beautiful,
and Orthis used to say that if he closed his eyes, he could imagine
himself living constantly in grand opera.
</p><p>The chief’s name, as we learned, was Ga-va-go; the name of the tribe
or village was No-vans, while the race to which they belonged was
known as Va-gas.
</p><p>When I felt that I had mastered the language sufficiently well to
make myself at least partially understood, I asked to speak to Ga-vago, 
and shortly thereafter, I was taken to him.
</p><p>“You have learned our speech?” he asked.
</p><p>I nodded in the affirmative. “I have,” I said, “and I have come to
ask why we are held captives and what you intend to do with us. We
did not come to seek a quarrel with you. We wish only to be friends,
and to be allowed to go our way in peace.”
</p><p>“What manner of creature are you,” he asked, “and where do you come
from?”
</p><p>I asked him if he had ever heard of the Sun or the stars or the other
planets or any worlds outside his own, and he replied that he had
not, and that there were no such things.
</p><p>“But there are, Ga-va-go,” I said, “and I and my companion are from
another world, far, far outside your own. An accident brought us
here. Give us back our weapons, and let us go.”
</p><p>He shook his head negatively.
</p><p>“Where you come from, do you eat one another?” he asked.
</p><p>“No,” I replied, “we do not.”
</p><p>“Why?” he asked, and I saw his eyes narrow as he awaited my reply.
</p><p>Was it mental telepathy or just luck that put the right answer in my
mouth, for somehow, intuitively, I seemed to grasp what was in the
creature’s mind.
</p><p>“Our flesh is poison,” I said, “those who eat it die.”
</p><p>He looked at me then for a long time, with an expression upon his
face which I could not interpret. It may have been that he doubted my
word, or again, it may have been that my reply confirmed his
suspicion, I do not know; but presently he asked me another question.
</p><p>“Are there many like you in the land where you live?”
</p><p>“Millions upon millions,” I replied.
</p><p>“And what do they eat?”
</p><p>“They eat fruits and vegetables and the flesh of animals,” I
answered.
</p><p>“What animals?” he asked.
</p><p>“I have seen no animals here like them,” I replied, “but there are
many kinds unlike us, so that we do not have to eat flesh of our own
race.”
</p><p>“Then you have all the flesh that you want?”
</p><p>“All that we can eat,” I replied. “We raise these animals for their
flesh.”
</p><p>“Where is your country?” he demanded. “Take me to it.”
</p><p>I smiled. “I cannot take you to it,” I said. “It is upon another
world.”
</p><p>It was quite evident that he did not believe me, for he scowled at me
ferociously.
</p><p>“Do you wish to die?” he demanded.
</p><p>I told him that I had no such longing.
</p><p>“Then you will lead me to your country,” he said, “where there is
plenty of flesh for everyone. You may think about it until I send for
you again. Go!” And thus he dismissed me. Then he sent for Orthis,
but what Orthis told him, I never knew exactly, for he would not tell
me, and as our relations, even in our captivity, were far from
friendly, I did not urge him to any confidences. I had occasion to
notice, however, that from that time Ga-va-go indicated a marked
preference for Orthis, and the latter was often called to his hut.
</p><p>I was momentarily expecting to be summoned in to Ga-va-go’s presence,
and learn my fate, when he discovered that I could not lead him to my
country, where flesh was so plentiful. But at about this time we
broke camp, and in the press of other matters, he evidently neglected
to take any further immediate action in my case, or at least, so I
thought, until I later had reason to suspect that he felt that he
need no longer depend upon me to lead him to this land of milk and
honey.
</p><p>The Va-gas are a nomadic race, moving hither and thither, either as
they are pressed by some foes, or till their victories have
frightened away the other tribes from their vicinity, in either of
which events, they march in search of fresh territory. The move that
we made now was necessitated by the fact that all the other tribes
nearby had fled before the ferocity of the No-vans, whose repeated
and successful raids had depleted the villages of their neighbors and
filled them with terror.
</p><p>The breaking of camp was a wonderfully simple operation. All their
few belongings, consisting of extra clothing, trappings, weapons, and
their treasured skulls and bones of victims, were strapped to the
backs of the women. Orthis and I each bestrode a warrior detailed by
Ga-va-go for the purpose of transporting us, and we filed out of the
village, leaving the huts behind.
</p><p>Ga-va-go, with a half-dozen warriors, galloped far ahead. Then came a
strong detachment of warriors, with the women folks behind them,
another detachment of warriors following in the rear of the women and
children, while others rode upon either flank. A mile or so in the
rear, came three warriors, and there were two or three scattered far
out on either flank. Thus we moved, thoroughly protected against
surprise, regulating our speed by that of the point with which Ga-vago 
traveled.
</p><p>Because of the women and the children, we moved more slowly than
warriors do when on the march alone, when they seldom, if ever,
travel slower than a trot, and more generally, at a fast gallop. We
moved along a well-worn trail, passing several deserted villages,
from which the prey of the No-vans had fled. We crossed many rivers,
for the lunar world is well watered. We skirted several lakes, and at
one point of high ground, I saw, far at our left, the waters of what
appeared to be a great ocean.
</p><p>There was never a time when Orthis and I were not plentifully
supplied with food, for there is an abundance of it growing
throughout all the territory we crossed, but the No-vans had been
without flesh for several days and were, in consequence, mad with
hunger, as the fruits and vegetables which they ate seemed not to
satisfy them at all.
</p><p>We were moving along at a brisk trot when, without warning, we were
struck by a sudden gust of wind that swept, cold and refreshing, down
from some icy mountain fastness. The effect upon the No-vans was
electrical. I would not have had to understand their language to
realize that they were terrified. They looked apprehensively about
and increased their speed as though endeavoring to overtake Ga-va-go,
who was now far ahead with the point. A moment later a dash of rain
struck us, and then it was every man for himself and the devil take
the hindmost, as they broke into a wild stampede to place themselves
close to their chief. Their hysterical flight was like the terrorized
rush of wild cattle. They jostled and tripped one another, and
stumbled and fell and were trampled upon, in their haste to escape.
</p><p>Old Ga-va-go had stopped with his point, and was waiting for us.
Those who accompanied him seemed equally terrified with the rest, but
evidently they did not dare run until Ga-va-go gave the word. I
think, however, that they all felt safer when they were close to him,
for they had a great deal of confidence in him, yet they were still
pretty badly frightened, and it would not have taken much to have set
them off again into another rout. Ga-va-go waited until the last of
the rearguard straggled in, and then he set off directly toward the
mountains, the entire tribe moving in a compact mass, though they
might have fallen easy prey to an ambush or any sudden attack. They
knew, however, what I half guessed, that knowing that their enemies
were as terrified of the storm as they, there was little danger of
their being attacked—none whatever, in fact.
</p><p>We came at last to a hillside covered with great trees which offered
some protection from both the wind and the rain, which had now arisen
to the proportion of a hurricane.
</p><p>As we came to a halt, I slipped from the back of the warrior who had
been carrying me, and found myself beside one of the women who had
taught Orthis and me the language of the Va-gas.
</p><p>“Why is everyone so terrified?” I asked her.
</p><p>“It is Zo-al,” she whispered, fearfully. “He is angry.”
</p><p>“Who is Zo-al?” I asked.
</p><p>She looked at me in wide-eyed astonishment. “Who is Zo-al!” she
repeated. “They told me that you said that you came from another
world, and I can well believe it, when you ask, who is Zo-al?”
</p><p>“Well, who is he?” I insisted.
</p><p>“He is a great beast,” she whispered. “He is everywhere. He lives in
all the great holes in the ground, and when he is angry, he comes
forth and makes the water fall and the air run away. We know that
there is no water up there,” and she pointed toward the sky. “But
when Zo-al is angry, he makes water fall from where there is no
water, so mighty is Zo-al, and he makes the air to run away so that
the trees fall before it as it rushes past, and huts are knocked flat
or carried high above the ground. And then, O terror of terrors, he
makes a great noise, before which mighty warriors fall upon the
ground and cover up their ears. We have angered Zo-al, and he is
punishing us, and I do not dare to ask him not to send the big
noise.”
</p><p>It was at that instant that there broke upon my ears the most
terrific detonation that I have ever heard. So terrific was it that I
thought my ear drums had burst, and simultaneously, a great ball of
fire seemed to come rolling down from the mountain heights above us.
</p><p>The woman, covering her ears, shuddered, and when she saw the ball of
fire, she voiced a piercing shriek.
</p><p>“The light that devours!” she cried. “When that comes too, it is the
end, for then is Zo-al mad with rage.”
</p><p>The ground shook to the terrifying noise, and though the ball of fire
did not pass close to us, still could I feel the heat of it even as
it went by at a distance, leaving a trail of blackened and smoking
vegetation in its rear. What flames there were, the torrential rain
extinguished almost immediately. It must have traveled about ten
miles, down toward the sea, across rolling hills and level valleys,
when suddenly it burst, the explosion being followed by a report
infinitely louder than that which I had first heard. An earthquake
could scarce have agitated the ground more terrifyingly than did this
peal of lunar thunder.
</p><p>I had witnessed my first lunar electrical storm, and I did not wonder
that the inhabitants of this strange world were terrified by it. They
attribute these storms, as they do all their troubles, to Zo-al, a
great beast, which is supposed to dwell in the depth of the lunar
craters, the lower ends of which open into the interior lunar world.
As we cowered there among the trees, I wondered if they were not
afraid that the wind would blow the forest down and crush them, and I
asked the woman who stood beside me.
</p><p>“Yes,” she said, “that often happens, but more often does it happen
that if one is caught in a clearing, the air that runs away picks him
up and carries him along to drop him from a great height upon the
hard ground. The trees bend before they break, and those who watch
are warned, and they escape destruction if they are quick. When the
wind that runs seizes one, there is no escape.”
</p><p>“It seems to me,” I said, “that it would have been safer if Ga-va-go
had led us into one of those sheltered ravines,” and I indicated a
gorge in the hillside at our right.
</p><p>“No,” she said, “Ga-va-go is wise. He led us to the safest spot. We
are sheltered from the air that runs away, and perhaps a little from
the light that devours, nor can the waters that drown, reach us here,
for presently they will fill that ravine full.”
</p><p>Nor was she wrong. Rushing down from the hillside, the water poured
in torrents into the ravine, and presently, though it must have been
twenty or thirty feet deep, it was filled almost to overflowing.
Whoever had sought refuge there, would have been drowned and washed
away to the big ocean far below. It was evident that Ga-va-go had not
been actuated solely by blind terror, though I came to know that he
must have felt terror, for these terrible electrical storms alone can
engender it in the breasts of these fearless and ferocious people.
</p><p>The storm must have lasted for a considerable time; how long, of
course, I do not know, but some idea of its duration may be gained by
the fact that I became hungry and ate of the fruit of the trees,
which sheltered us, at least six times, and slept twice. We were
soaked to the skin and very cold, for the rain evidently came from a
great altitude. During the entire storm, the No-vans scarcely moved
from their positions beneath the trees, with their backs toward the
storm, where they stood with lowered heads like cattle. We
experienced twelve detonations of the ground-shaking thunder, and
witnessed six manifestations of the light that devours. Trees had
fallen all about us, and as far as we could see, the grasses lay flat
and matted upon the ground. They told me that storms of the severity
of this were infrequent, though rain and wind, accompanied by
electrical manifestations, might be expected at any season of the
year—I use that expression from habit, for one can scarcely say that
there are any well-marked seasonal changes within the Moon that could
indicate corresponding divisions of time as upon the Earth. From what
I was able to gather from observation and from questioning the Vagas, 
lunar vegetation reproduces itself entirely independent of any
seasonal restrictions, the frequency and temperature of the rains
having, seemingly, the greatest influence in the matter. A period of
drought and cold rains retards growth and germination, while frequent
warm rains have an opposite effect, the result being that you find
vegetation of the same variety in all stages of development, growing
side by side—blossoms upon one tree, fruit upon another, and the dry
seed-pods upon a third. Not even, therefore, by the growth of plant
life, might one measure time within the Moon, and the period of
gestation among the Va-gas is similarly irregular, being affected by
the physical condition of the female as well as by climatic
conditions, I imagine. When the tribe is well-fed, and the weather
warm, the warriors victorious, and the minds of the women at peace,
they bring forth their young in an incredibly short period. On the
other hand, a period of cold, or of hunger, and of long marches,
following defeat, induces an opposite result. It seems to me that the
females nurse their young for a very short period of time, for they
grow rapidly, and as soon as their molars are through, and they can
commence eating meat, they are weaned. They are devilish little
rascals, their youthful exuberance finding its outlet in acts of
fiendish cruelty. As they are not strong enough to inflict their
tortures on adults they perpetrate them upon one another, with the
result that the weaker are often killed, after they are weaned and
have left the protection of their savage mothers. Of course, they
tried to play some of their fiendish tricks on Orthis and myself, but
after we had knocked a few of them down, they left us severely alone.
</p><p>During the storm, they huddled, shivering and cold, against the
adults. Possibly I should be ashamed to say it, but I felt no pity
for them, and rather prayed that they would all be chilled to death,
so hateful and wantonly cruel were they. As they become adults, they
are less wanton in their atrocities, though no less cruel, their
energies, however, being intelligently directed upon the two vital
interests of their lives—procuring flesh and women.
</p><p>Shortly after the rain ceased, the wind began to abate, and as I was
cold, cramped and uncomfortable, I walked out into the open, in
search of exercise that would stimulate my circulation and warm me
again. As I walked briskly to and fro, looking here and there at the
evidences of the recent storm, my glance chanced to rise toward the
sky, and there I saw what appeared at first to be a huge bird, a few
hundred feet above the forest in which we had sought shelter. It was
flapping its great wings weakly and seemed to be almost upon the
verge of exhaustion, and though I could see that it was attempting to
fly back in the direction of the mountains, the force of the wind was
steadily carrying it in the direction of the lowlands and the sea.
Presently it would be directly above me, and as it drew nearer, I
knit my brows in puzzlement, for except for its wings, and what
appeared to be a large hump upon its back, its form bore a striking
resemblance to that of a human being.
</p><p>Some of the No-vans evidently saw me looking upwards thus
interestedly, and prompted by curiosity, joined me. When they saw the
creature flying weakly overhead, they set up a great noise, until
presently all the tribe had run into the open and were looking up at
the thing above us.
</p><p>The wind was lessening rapidly, but it still was strong enough to
carry the creature gently toward us, and at the same time I perceived
that whatever it was, it was falling slowly to the ground, or more
correctly, sinking slowly.
</p><p>“What is it?” I asked of the warrior standing beside me.
</p><p>“It is a U-ga,” he replied. “Now shall we eat.”
</p><p>I had seen no birds in the lunar world, and as I knew they would not
eat the flying reptiles, I guessed that this must be some species of
bird life, but as it dropped closer, I became more and more convinced
that it was a winged human being, or at least a winged creature with
human form.
</p><p>As it fluttered toward the ground, the No-vans ran along to meet it,
waiting for it to fall within reach. As they did so, Ga-va-go called
to them to bring the creature to him alive and unharmed.
</p><p>I was about a hundred yards from the spot, when the poor thing
finally fell into their clutches. They dragged it to the ground
roughly, and a moment later I was horrified to see them tear its
wings from it and the hump from its back. There was a great deal of
grumbling at Ga-va-go’s order, as following the storm and their long
fast, the tribe was ravenously hungry.
</p><p>“Flesh, flesh!” they growled. “We are hungry. Give us flesh!” But Gava
-go paid no attention to them, standing to one side beneath a tree,
awaiting the prisoner that they were bringing toward him.
