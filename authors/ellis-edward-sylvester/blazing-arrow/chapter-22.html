<p>An inexplainable instinct sometimes warns a person of the approach
of peril. The experience of most of us confirms this statement,
and we are tempted to suspect that it is another manifestation
of that occult "sixth sense" of which we have only a shadowy conception.</p>

<p>Wharton Edwards and Larry Murphy had been sleeping several hours,
for it will be remembered that they were exceedingly tired. Day
was at hand, and yet, in the usual order of things, they would
have slumbered several hours longer; but, at the same moment,
the two became as wide awake as they were when hurrying along
the trail to the block-house.</p>

<p>This moment of awakening came when the Indian was in the act
of laying down his bow behind him. Larry, being nearer to the
savage than Wharton, took upon himself to act promptly.</p>

<p>In an instant he rose upon one knee and levelled his gun at the
astonished Shawanoe. In the act of doing so the youth recalled
that he had not reloaded it since firing the weapon while in the
canoe. Nothing in his manner, however, told the red man this interesting
fact.</p>

<p>"Do the same as mesilf," whispered Larry to his companion, "for
I forgot to load my gun."</p>

<p>Wharton was quick to obey, and the Indian stood petrified, absolutely
unable to move hand or foot.</p>

<p>"I've got ye now, ye spalpeen!" said Larry, in a loud voice;
"if ye stir I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>To the amazement of the youth, the Indian replied in their own
tongue:</p>

<p>"No shoot&mdash;no hurt Arqu-wao&mdash;me good Indian."</p>

<p>"Begorra, but ye're not acting like one," was the comment of
Larry, who now rose to his feet. "What were ye trying to do, anyway?"</p>

<p>Wharton imitated the action of his companion, and said, in an
undertone:</p>

<p>"Don't hurt the poor fellow."</p>

<p>"That depinds on himsilf," was the resolute response. "I spared
him once, and he mustn't go to heaving any more rocks at us, for
he's too handy at the business."</p>

<p>The Indian, at the moment of turning around, had placed his hand
on his tomahawk, but snatched it away as though it had suddenly
become red hot. He was a picture of abject fear, and trembled
in every limb. Had he known enough to wheel about and run, he
would have been safe, for neither of the boys had the least desire
to harm him. But, to use a modern expression, they had the drop
on him.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on him," said Larry, "while I load my gun."</p>

<p>The Indian must have experienced peculiar emotions when he received
the proof that it was an empty weapon that had brought him to
terms. Larry proceeded to reload his rifle in a deliberate fashion,
while Wharton covered their prisoner with his own gun.</p>

<p>It was while this proceeding was under way that the couple noticed
that the sun was almost in the horizon. The long eventful night
was ended, and they were close upon more stirring events.</p>

<p>"He calls himself Arqu-wao," said Wharton. "I wonder what the
name means?"</p>

<p>"I'm thinking it means an Indian half-scared to death; but, Whart,
what'll we do wid him, now that we've got him?"</p>

<p>"That's what puzzles me. If we hadn't waked up just as we did
we never would have awaked at all, and if we let him go he'll
probably sneak up behind us and drive an arrow through each before
we know our danger."</p>

<p>"Let's keep him a prisoner."</p>

<p>"How will we manage it?"</p>

<p>"I'll fix it."</p>

<p>Arqu-wao was still motionless, looking as if he expected to be
punished with death for his attempt upon the lives of the youths.
As Larry spoke, he strode toward him with a stern face and manner.
The Indian instantly began pleading in the most pitiful manner
for his life. The youth was tender-hearted, and said, kindly:</p>

<p>"Be good Indian and we won't hurt, but let me have the tomahawk."</p>

<p>The implement was meekly handed over.</p>

<p>"Now the knife."</p>

<p>That followed the other; and with all the gravity that Larry
could assume he shoved the handle of the first weapon between
the waistband of his trousers and shirt.</p>

<p>"Whart, you can take charge of that," he added, passing the knife
to his companion, who readily disposed of it about his person.</p>

<p>The most dangerous implement of all still remained in the hands
of the Shawanoe, and the captors were perplexed for the moment
as to how it was to be disposed of. It would have been easy to
render it useless, and the arrows might have been cast down the
ravine, but they hesitated to take that step.</p>

<p>The same thought was in the minds of the lads. Arqu-wao might
be used as a friend and an ally in the danger which still threatened,
and, if so, he would need some weapon to be of avail in emergencies.</p>

<p>Wharton now advanced and spoke:</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao, do you know where the block-house is?"</p>

<p>The expression of the Indian's face showed that he did not comprehend
the question.</p>

<p>"Big house&mdash;fort&mdash;place where white men are?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;me know&mdash;me been dere," he replied, nodding his head vigorously.</p>

<p>"It's off yonder, isn't it?" inquired Wharton, pointing with
his hand in the supposed direction.</p>

<p>Arqu-wao shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not dere&mdash;off dere," he said, indicating a point of the compass
fully forty-five degrees removed from the first.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he's right?" said Wharton, doubtfully, turning toward
his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes, for he's so scared he's sure to play square for a time."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Wharton, looking toward the Indian. "Lead the
way; if you go wrong, we shoot, we kill."</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao go right&mdash;he go right&mdash;he good Shawanoe&mdash;broder of
Blazing Arrow."</p>

<p>The latter remark was startling to the boys, and they looked
inquiringly at each other, wondering what he could mean.</p>

<p>"Begorra, if he's a brother to him, it's a bad ricommindation
to himsilf," remarked Larry.</p>

<p>"He may be the flower of the flock, but we will keep sharp watch
on him."</p>

<p>The Indian, now that he understood that he had chance for his
life, lost most of the fear that had filled him from the moment
he was arrested in the very act of committing a crime.</p>

<p>He showed his knowledge of what was said to him by walking, not
parallel to the course of the torrent, which the boys had intended
to take for their guidance, but diverging at quite a sharp angle
from it. Neither of the youths could be satisfied whether this
was favorable or not, but there was logic in Larry's theory that
their guide was so frightened that he would act honestly, at least
for a time.</p>

<p>If he was doing so, he was doing them a great favor, for, instead
of walking a number of miles down the gorge, and then returning
over the same route, this distance would be saved by "cutting
across lots," with the probability of eluding the hostile Shawanoes
waiting in ambush. Whether such was the fact or not must be left
to future developments.</p>

<p>The sun was now fairly above the horizon, and the day promised
to be as clear and sunshiny as the preceding one. The hearty meal,
eaten the night before, and the rest, enabled the boys to continue
their brisk walk for hours without fatigue. They would have been
glad to keep straight on, if it were possible, until they reached
the block-house.</p>

<p>When they leaped across a small brook of cold, sparkling water,
Wharton called the guide to wait for a minute. He was walking
about a rod in advance, glancing sharply to the right and left,
and even among the branches of the trees, as though he suspected
danger lurking there. He never once looked back while thus engaged
until he heard the sharp summons of Wharton. Then he stopped short
and turned half way round, and stood like a statue.</p>

<p>There was something suggestive in his attitude, for his right
hand was hidden from the sight of the boys. If he chose he could
slide it up over his breast, stealthily withdraw an arrow from
the quiver, and fit it to his bow-string without detection. The
launching of the missile would be done so quickly that no shot
from either rifle could anticipate it. But there were two boys,
and this would frustrate any such purpose, unless one should place
himself at such disadvantage that he could not rise and recover
his gun before the firing of the second arrow.</p>

<p>"Keep an eye on him," whispered Wharton; "I don't like his actions."</p>
