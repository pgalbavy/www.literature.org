<p>When the Sioux who had rushed out on the open plain to the help
of the wounded Starcus gathered around him they were quick to
perceive that his life was due to the mercy of his conqueror,
but their hostility toward the latter was not diminished one whit
by the discovery; they were as eager for his life as ever, and
proved it by firing several shots after him as he rode away.</p>

<p>The wounded arm was bandaged in a piece of the lining of Warren
Starr's coat. The crimson stain showed through the cloth, though
the flow of blood was checked. Sound and unhurt as was Starcus
in all other respects, he was unable to use the injured limb,
and was therefore as useless in any impending hostilities as if
out of existence.</p>

<p>As the party moved back toward the base of the ridge there was
a consultation among them as to what was best to do. Starcus expressed
a more venomous rancor than ever against the white people, and
especially against the one that had brought him low. He regretted
that he was to be helpless for weeks to come, with a permanent
injury for life.</p>

<p>When the leader of the band suggested that he should return to
the nearest village and remain until able to take the warpath
again, he vehemently opposed it. He was not willing to retire
in such a humiliating manner, but the leader insisted, and after
sulking a while the "civilized" Indian consented.</p>

<p>Being a capital horseman, he leaped unassisted upon his pony,
and unwilling in his anger so much as to bid the warriors good-by,
he struck the animal into a swift gallop, heading toward the village,
where he was expected to stay until fully recovered.</p>

<p>The action of the warrior was singular. After riding some distance
he glanced behind him at the ridge he had left. He seemed to be
in an irritable mood, for he uttered an impatient exclamation
and urged his beast to a faster gait. His wound pained him, but
the agitation of his mind and his own stoical nature caused him
to pay no heed to it. Indeed nothing more could be done for the
hurt.</p>

<p>When he looked back the second time he had reached a point for
which he had been making since his departure. He was out of sight
of any of his people who might be watching him.</p>

<p>An abrupt change in the course of his pony was instantly made,
and he sent him flying at the height of his speed. Strange as
it may seem, he was aiming for the same point toward which Warren
Starr started some time later.</p>

<p>He did not spare his animal. He went like a whirlwind, and as
though his life depended upon reaching his destination without
delay. Warren Starr read the trail aright when he interpreted
it as meaning that the pony before him was going as fast as he
could.</p>

<p>Starcus was picking his way, still mounted, over the rough section
where the youth had expected to meet great difficulty with his
animal, when he suddenly discovered that white people were immediately
in his front. He drew up, and was in doubt for a minute whether
to flee or hold his ground.</p>

<p>A squad of cavalry from Fort Meade confronted him. They numbered
nearly twenty, under the command of a young lieutenant, a recent
graduate of West Point. They were accompanied by a couple of Indian
scouts familiar with the country.</p>

<p>Starcus was quick to make a signal of friendship, and then rode
forward to meet the soldiers, who had halted upon seeing him.</p>

<p>The Sioux was well known to the two Indians, the officer, and
several of the cavalry. They knew he had joined the hostiles,
and were therefore suspicious of him. This fact rendered his self-imposed
task one of considerable difficulty. But after a while he convinced
them of his honesty.</p>

<p>The lieutenant had been sent out by the commandant at Fort Meade
to bring in the rancher and his family, their scouts having reported
them in imminent danger. Starcus explained that the parties for
whom they were looking were at no great distance, having left
the ranch the night before to hasten to the fort. One of the ranchmen
had been killed, and the rest were in great peril. Starcus said
he had started to ride to the fort for help, and it was most fortunate
that he encountered it so near, when the passing moments were
beyond importance.</p>

<p>The young officer was sagacious. He could have asked some very
embarrassing questions relating to the wound of the messenger,
but he wisely forbore. It is not best at all times to let a person
know how much is plain to you and how much you suspect. Evidently
Starcus was earnest in his desire to befriend the imperilled ones;
the fact that he was journeying alone in the direction of the
fort constituting the strongest evidence.</p>

<p>He explained that the ridge where he believed the whites were
doing their best to escape the Sioux was much more approachable
from the other side. He described the ground minutely, and the
two scouts present confirmed the accuracy of his statements.</p>

<p>When the lieutenant proposed that Starcus should act as their
guide the truth could no longer be kept back. He made a clean
breast of everything.</p>

<p>He had been with the hostiles. He was among the fiercest. He
had tried to shoot young Starr, who, more fortunate than he, brought
him wounded from his horse. When he lay on the ground, at his
mercy, the young man rode up, spoke words of kindness, and bandaged
his wound.</p>

<p>And in doing this the youth proved more of a conqueror than he
had done by his excellent marksmanship. He won the heart of the
Indian, who was now eager to prove his gratitude by any act in
his power. He unhesitatingly answered that he would serve as the
guide to the cavalry.</p>

<p>But once again the officer displayed rare tact. If Starcus was
sincere in his newly awakened friendship for the whites, it might
be in his power to accomplish a great deal of good by going among
his people and using persuasion and argument; but if he should
appear as an active ally of the whites such power would be gone,
and it would be unsafe at any time in the future to trust himself
among them.</p>

<p>"No," replied the lieutenant; "return to your own people; do
what you can to show them the mistake they are making in taking
the warpath; you may effect much good. My guides will do as well
as you to direct us to the spot where the whites are in urgent
need of our help. You say it is not far, and I am hopeful that
we shall be in time to save them."</p>

<p>Accordingly Starcus parted from the cavalry, and was on his return
to join his people and to attempt to carry out the wise suggestion
of the officer, when he encountered the young rancher making all
haste on foot to secure the help which was much nearer than he
had dared to hope.</p>

<p>After exchanging friendly greetings, Starcus told the story which
the reader has just learned.</p>

<p>Warren listened with amazement and delight. He had, indeed, heaped
coals of fire upon his enemy's head by his forbearance, and the
bread cast upon the waters had returned before many days.</p>

<p>"You have acted nobly," was the comment of the youth.</p>

<p>"Can it undo the harm of the last few days?" asked the Indian,
with a troubled expression.</p>

<p>"Far more, for I am sure the timely news given to the lieutenant
will save my people."</p>

<p>"And yet I was their enemy."</p>

<p>"And are now their friend. You lost your head in the frenzy that
is spreading like a prairie fire among your people; your footsteps
were guided by Providence, otherwise you would have missed the
cavalry; they would have ridden to the ranch, and my folks would
have been left as much without their help as though the soldiers
had stayed at the fort. Besides," added the young rancher, "you
can do as the officer suggested&mdash;show your own people the right
course for them to follow."</p>

<p>"I will try," replied Starcus firmly; "I cannot understand how
it was my senses forsook me, but they have come back, and," he
said, with a meaning smile, "I think they will stay."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that, and you will do much good."</p>

<p>"Well, good-by," said Starcus, reaching down his unwounded arm.
"I hope we shall meet again under pleasanter conditions."</p>

<p>Warren warmly pressed the hand and stood for a minute gazing
after the strange fellow, who rode toward the nearest Indian village
with the determination to carry out his new intentions.</p>

<p>It may as well be said that he honestly did so, and there is
little doubt that his work was effective in more than one respect,
and did much to ameliorate many phases of the sad incidents that
speedily followed.</p>

<p>Left alone once more, the young rancher stood for some minutes
in doubt as to his right course. It was idle to push on to the
fort on foot, and he was at much disadvantage, now that he had
no animal at command. He decided to follow the cavalry.</p>

<p>He had forgotten to ask Starcus how far off they were, but judged
the distance was not great. The trail of the Indian's horse gave
him the necessary guidance, and he broke once more into his loping
trot, despite the rough nature of the ground.</p>

<p>A half-hour sufficed to take him to the scene of meeting, when
he turned and began following the footprints of the horses at
a faster gait than before.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as he was now a goodly number of miles from the bowlders
where his friends were at bay before the attacking Sioux, he hardly
expected to reach the place in time to take a hand in the decisive
scenes or even to witness them. Starcus had left such accurate
directions, and the Indian guides were so familiar with everything,
that little delay was probable.</p>

<p>The distant sound of firing spurred him to still greater speed,
and he ran so fast and hard that ere long he was compelled to
drop to a walk to regain his breath.</p>

<p>Great as was his hope, he felt much misgiving. The cavalry might
arrive in time, but in the flurry sad mishaps were probable. It
might be that his father or mother or Dot or Tim had fallen before
the vigilance of the assailants. He could not feel any real happiness
until he learned beyond peradventure that all was well.</p>

<p>The shot fired by Tim Brophy the instant he caught sight of the
warrior hurrying along the trail, with no thought that he was
so close to the whites, was the best thing in every way that could
have happened, for it not only wiped out the rash miscreant, but
told those immediately behind him that the fugitives were at bay
and ready to fight to the bitter end.</p>

<p>There was an instant withdrawal beyond reach of the rifles, of
whose effectiveness they had received more than one striking example
that night.</p>

<p>It took a considerable while for the Sioux to learn the whole
truth. The fugitives had intrenched themselves in what was undoubtedly
the most secure position near, and were on the watch. Gradually
working round so as to enclose them against flight, the trail
of the young rancher was discovered. A little investigation made
known that he had mounted his pony and started off for assistance.</p>

<p>But help was no nearer than Fort Meade, and, as the Indians naturally
thought, it could not possibly arrive before the morrow. If this
were so, abundant time remained in which to encompass the destruction
of the defenders. The Sioux decided to maintain watch, but to
defer the decisive assault until late at night.</p>

<p>And it was this decision that saved the little party. Within
the following two hours the friendly scouts reported the situation
to the lieutenant of cavalry, who began his arrangements for an
immediate attack upon the hostiles.</p>

<p>The latter, however, were as watchful as their enemies, and were
quick to learn their new danger. They withdrew and disappeared
after the exchange of a few shots, fired under such circumstances
that no harm was done on either side.</p>

<p>The rescued whites were conducted to the foot of the ridge on
the other side, where they were so disposed among their friends
that all were furnished with transportation, and the journey to
Fort Meade was begun, or rather resumed so far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>Not far away they met the young rancher, breathless and in an
agony of distress. His joy may be imagined upon learning the happy
truth. All were saved without so much as a hair of their heads
being harmed.</p>

<p>The next day Warren returned for his pony, and found him so much
better that he was able to walk with little trouble. The youth
was too considerate to ask him to carry any load, and the two
made the journey with the rider on foot.</p>

<p>And so it came about that Providence mercifully extricated our
friends from the danger which threatened more than once the ruin
of all.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
