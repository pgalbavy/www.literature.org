<p>It froze in the night, harder than was common on the Berg even
in winter, and as I crossed the road next morning it was covered
with rime.  All my fears had gone, and my mind was strung high
with expectation.  Five pencilled words may seem a small thing
to build hope on, but it was enough for me, and I went about my
work in the store with a reasonably light heart.  One of the first
things I did was to take stock of our armoury.  There were five
sporting Mausers of a cheap make, one Mauser pistol, a Lee-Speed
carbine, and a little nickel-plated revolver.  There was also
Japp's shot-gun, an old hammered breech-loader, as well as the
gun I had brought out with me. There was a good supply of cartridges,
including a stock for a .400 express which could not be found. 
I pocketed the revolver, and searched till I discovered a good
sheath-knife.  If fighting was in prospect I might as well look
to my arms.</p>

<p>All the morning I sat among flour and sugar possessing my soul
in as much patience as I could command.  Nothing came down the
white road from the west.  The sun melted the rime; the flies
came out and buzzed in the window; Japp got himself out of bed,
brewed strong coffee, and went back to his slumbers.  Presently
it was dinner-time, and I went over to a silent meal with Wardlaw. 
When I returned I must have fallen asleep over a pipe, for the
next thing I knew I was blinking drowsily at the patch of sun
in the door, and listening for footsteps.  In the dead stillness
of the afternoon I thought I could discern a shuffling in the
dust.  I got up and looked out, and there, sure enough, was some
one coming down the road.</p>

<p>But it was only a Kaffir, and a miserable-looking object at that. 
I had never seen such an anatomy.  It was a very old man, bent
almost double, and clad in a ragged shirt and a pair of foul khaki
trousers. He carried an iron pot, and a few belongings were tied
up in a dirty handkerchief.  He must have been a <em>dacha</em>[1]
smoker, for he coughed hideously, twisting his body with the paroxysms. 
I had seen the type before&mdash;the old broken-down native who had
no kin to support him, and no tribe to shelter him.  They wander
about the roads, cooking their wretched meals by their little
fires, till one morning they are found stiff under a bush.</p>

<p>The native gave me a good-day in Kaffir, then begged for tobacco
or a handful of mealie-meal.</p>

<p>I asked him where he came from.</p>

<p>'From the west, Inkoos,' he said, 'and before that from the south. 
It is a sore road for old bones.'</p>

<p>I went into the store to fetch some meal, and when I came out
he had shuffled close to the door.  He had kept his eyes on the
ground, but now he looked up at me, and I thought he had very
bright eyes for such an old wreck.</p>

<p>'The nights are cold, Inkoos,' he wailed, 'and my folk are scattered,
and I have no kraal.  The aasvogels follow me, and I can hear
the blesbok.' 'What about the blesbok?' I asked with a start.</p>

<p>'The blesbok are changing ground,' he said, and looked me straight
in the face.</p>

<p>'And where are the hunters?' I asked. 'They are here and behind
me,' he said in English, holding out his pot for my meal, while
he began to edge into the middle of the road.</p>

<p>I followed, and, speaking English, asked him if he knew of a
man named Colles.</p>

<p>'I come from him, young Baas.  Where is your house?  Ah, the
school. There will be a way in by the back window?  See that it
is open, for I'll be there shortly.'  Then lifting up his voice
he called down in Sesuto all manner of blessings on me for my
kindness, and went shuffling down the sunlit road, coughing like
a volcano.</p>

<p>In high excitement I locked up the store and went over to Mr
Wardlaw. No children had come to school that day, and he was sitting
idle, playing patience.  'Lock the door,' I said, 'and come into
my room. We're on the brink of explanations.'</p>

<p>In about twenty minutes the bush below the back-window parted
and the Kaffir slipped out.  He grinned at me, and after a glance
round, hopped very nimbly over the sill.  Then he examined the
window and pulled the curtains.</p>

<p>'Is the outer door shut?' he asked in excellent English.  'Well,
get me some hot water, and any spare clothes you may possess,
Mr Crawfurd.  I must get comfortable before we begin our <em>indaba</em>.[2] 
We've the night before us, so there's plenty of time. But get
the house clear, and see that nobody disturbs me at my toilet. 
I am a modest man, and sensitive about my looks.'</p>

<p>I brought him what he wanted, and looked on at an amazing transformation. 
Taking a phial from his bundle, he rubbed some liquid on his face
and neck and hands, and got rid of the black colouring. His body
and legs he left untouched, save that he covered them with shirt
and trousers from my wardrobe. Then he pulled off a scaly wig,
and showed beneath it a head of close-cropped grizzled hair. 
In ten minutes the old Kaffir had been transformed into an active
soldierly-looking man of maybe fifty years.  Mr Wardlaw stared
as if he had seen a resurrection.</p>

<p>'I had better introduce myself,' he said, when he had taken the
edge off his thirst and hunger.  'My name is Arcoll, Captain James
Arcoll. I am speaking to Mr Crawfurd, the storekeeper, and Mr
Wardlaw, the schoolmaster, of Blaauwildebeestefontein. Where,
by the way, is Mr Peter Japp?  Drunk?  Ah, yes, it was always
his failing.  The quorum, however, is complete without him.'</p>

<p>By this time it was about sunset, and I remember I cocked my
ear to hear the drums beat.  Captain Arcoll noticed the movement
as he noticed all else. 'You're listening for the drums, but you
won't hear them. That business is over here.  To-night they beat
in Swaziland and down into the Tonga border.  Three days more,
unless you and I, Mr Crawfurd, are extra smart, and they'll be
hearing them in Durban.'</p>

<p>It was not till the lamp was lit, the fire burning well, and
the house locked and shuttered, that Captain Arcoll began his
tale.</p>

<p>'First,' he said, 'let me hear what you know.  Colles told me
that you were a keen fellow, and had wind of some mystery here. 
You wrote him about the way you were spied on, but I told him
to take no notice. Your affair, Mr Crawfurd, had to wait on more
urgent matters.  Now, what do you think is happening?' I spoke
very shortly, weighing my words, for I felt I was on trial before
these bright eyes.  'I think that some kind of native rising is
about to commence.'</p>

<p>'Ay,' he said dryly, 'you would, and your evidence would be the
spying and drumming.  Anything more?'</p>

<p>'I have come on the tracks of a lot of <em>I.D.B. </em>work in
the neighbourhood.  The natives have some supply of diamonds,
which they sell bit by bit, and I don't doubt but they have been
getting guns with the proceeds.'</p>

<p>He nodded, 'Have you any notion who has been engaged in the job?'</p>

<p>I had it on my tongue to mention Japp, but forbore, remembering
my promise.  'I can name one,' I said, 'a little yellow Portugoose,
who calls himself Henriques or Hendricks. He passed by here the
day before yesterday.'</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll suddenly was consumed with quiet laughter. 'Did
you notice the Kaffir who rode with him and carried his saddlebags? 
Well, he's one of my men.  Henriques would have a fit if he knew
what was in those saddlebags.  They contain my change of clothes,
and other odds and ends.  Henriques' own stuff is in a hole in
the spruit.  A handy way of getting one's luggage sent on, eh? 
The bags are waiting for me at a place I appointed.'  And again
Captain Arcoll indulged his sense of humour.  Then he became grave,
and returned to his examination.</p>

<p>'A rising, with diamonds as the sinews of war, and Henriques
as the chief agent.  Well and good!  But who is to lead, and what
are the natives going to rise about?'</p>

<p>'I know nothing further, but I have made some guesses.'</p>

<p>'Let's hear your guesses,' he said, blowing smoke rings from
his pipe.</p>

<p>'I think the main mover is a great black minister who calls himself
John Laputa.'</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll nearly sprang out of his chair.  'Now, how on
earth did you find that out?  Quick, Mr Crawfurd, tell me all
you know, for this is desperately important.'</p>

<p>I began at the beginning, and told him the story of what happened
on the Kirkcaple shore.  Then I spoke of my sight of him on board
ship, his talk with Henriques about Blaauwildebeestefontein, and
his hurried departure from Durban.</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll listened intently, and at the mention of Durban
he laughed.  'You and I seem to have been running on lines which
nearly touched.  I thought I had grabbed my friend Laputa that
night in Durban, but I was too cocksure and he slipped off.  Do
you know, Mr Crawfurd, you have been on the right trail long before
me?  When did you say you saw him at his devil-worship?  Seven
years ago?  Then you were the first man alive to know the Reverend
John in his true colours. You knew seven years ago what I only
found out last year.'</p>

<p>'Well, that's my story,' I said.  'I don't know what the rising
is about, but there's one other thing I can tell you.  There's
some kind of sacred place for the Kaffirs, and I've found out
where it is.'  I gave him a short account of my adventures in
the Rooirand.</p>

<p>He smoked silently for a bit after I had finished.  'You've got
the skeleton of the whole thing right, and you only want the filling
up. And you found out everything for yourself?  Colles was right;
you're not wanting in intelligence, Mr Crawfurd.'</p>

<p>It was not much of a compliment, but I have never been more pleased
in my life.  This slim, grizzled man, with his wrinkled face and
bright eyes, was clearly not lavish in his praise.  I felt it
was no small thing to have earned a word of commendation.</p>

<p>'And now I will tell you my story,' said Captain Arcoll.  'It
is a long story, and I must begin far back.  It has taken me years
to decipher it, and, remember, I've been all my life at this native
business.  I can talk every dialect, and I have the customs of
every tribe by heart. I've travelled over every mile of South
Africa, and Central and East Africa too.  I was in both the Matabele
wars, and I've seen a heap of other fighting which never got into
the papers.  So what I tell you you can take as gospel, for it
is knowledge that was not learned in a day.'</p>

<p>He puffed away, and then asked suddenly, 'Did you ever hear of
Prester John?'</p>

<p>'The man that lived in Central Asia?' I asked, with a reminiscence
of a story-book I had as a boy. 'No, no,' said Mr Wardlaw, 'he
means the King of Abyssinia in the fifteenth century.  I've been
reading all about him.  He was a Christian, and the Portuguese
sent expedition after expedition to find him, but they never got
there.  Albuquerque wanted to make an alliance with him and capture
the Holy Sepulchre.'</p>

<p>Arcoll nodded.  'That's the one I mean.  There's not very much
known about him, except Portuguese legends.  He was a sort of
Christian, but I expect that his practices were as pagan as his
neighbours'.  There is no doubt that he was a great conqueror. 
Under him and his successors, the empire of Ethiopia extended
far south of Abyssinia away down to the Great Lakes.'</p>

<p>'How long did this power last?' I asked wondering to what tale
this was prologue.</p>

<p>'That's a mystery no scholar has ever been able to fathom. Anyhow,
the centre of authority began to shift southward, and the warrior
tribes moved in that direction.  At the end of the sixteenth century
the chief native power was round about the Zambesi.  The Mazimba
and the Makaranga had come down from the Lake Nyassa quarter,
and there was a strong kingdom in Manicaland.  That was the Monomotapa
that the Portuguese thought so much of.'</p>

<p>Wardlaw nodded eagerly.  The story was getting into ground that
he knew about.</p>

<p>'The thing to remember is that all these little empires thought
themselves the successors of Prester John.  It took me a long
time to find this out, and I have spent days in the best libraries
in Europe over it.  They all looked back to a great king in the
north, whom they called by about twenty different names.  They
had forgotten about his Christianity, but they remembered that
he was a conqueror.</p>

<p>'Well, to make a long story short, Monomotapa disappeared in
time, and fresh tribes came down from the north, and pushed right
down to Natal and the Cape.  That is how the Zulus first appeared. 
They brought with them the story of Prester John, but by this
time it had ceased to be a historical memory, and had become a
religious cult.  They worshipped a great Power who had been their
ancestor, and the favourite Zulu word for him was Umkulunkulu. 
The belief was perverted into fifty different forms, but this
was the central creed&mdash;that Umkulunkulu had been the father of
the tribe, and was alive as a spirit to watch over them.</p>

<p>'They brought more than a creed with them.  Somehow or other,
some fetich had descended from Prester John by way of the Mazimba
and Angoni and Makaranga.  What it is I do not know, but it was
always in the hands of the tribe which for the moment held the
leadership.  The great native wars of the sixteenth century, which
you can read about in the Portuguese historians, were not for
territory but for leadership, and mainly for the possession of
this fetich.  Anyhow, we know that the Zulus brought it down with
them.  They called it <em>Ndhlondhlo</em>, which means the Great
Snake, but I don't suppose that it was any kind of snake.  The
snake was their totem, and they would naturally call their most
sacred possession after it.</p>

<p>'Now I will tell you a thing that few know.  You have heard of
Tchaka. He was a sort of black Napoleon early in the last century,
and he made the Zulus the paramount power in South Africa, slaughtering
about two million souls to accomplish it. Well, he had the fetich,
whatever it was, and it was believed that he owed his conquests
to it.  Mosilikatse tried to steal it, and that was why he had
to fly to Matabeleland.  But with Tchaka it disappeared.  Dingaan
did not have it, nor Panda, and Cetewayo never got it, though
he searched the length and breadth of the country for it.  It
had gone out of existence, and with it the chance of a Kaffir
empire.'</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll got up to light his pipe, and I noticed that his
face was grave.  He was not telling us this yarn for our amusement.</p>

<p>'So much for Prester John and his charm,' he said.  'Now I have
to take up the history at a different point.  In spite of risings
here and there, and occasional rows, the Kaffirs have been quiet
for the better part of half a century.  It is no credit to us. 
They have had plenty of grievances, and we are no nearer understanding
them than our fathers were.  But they are scattered and divided. 
We have driven great wedges of white settlement into their territory,
and we have taken away their arms.  Still, they are six times
as many as we are, and they have long memories, and a thoughtful
man may wonder how long the peace will last. I have often asked
myself that question, and till lately I used to reply, "For ever
because they cannot find a leader with the proper authority, and
they have no common cause to fight for." But a year or two ago
I began to change my mind.</p>

<p>'It is my business to act as chief Intelligence officer among
the natives.  Well, one day, I came on the tracks of a curious
person.  He was a Christian minister called Laputa, and he was
going among the tribes from Durban to the Zambesi as a roving
evangelist.  I found that he made an enormous impression, and
yet the people I spoke to were chary of saying much about him. 
Presently I found that he preached more than the gospel.  His
word was "Africa for the Africans," and his chief point was that
the natives had had a great empire in the past, and might have
a great empire again.  He used to tell the story of Prester John,
with all kinds of embroidery of his own.  You see, Prester John
was a good argument for him, for he had been a Christian as well
as a great potentate. 'For years there has been plenty of this
talk in South Africa, chiefly among Christian Kaffirs.  It is
what they call "Ethiopianism," and American negroes are the chief
apostles.  For myself, I always thought the thing perfectly harmless. 
I don't care a fig whether the native missions break away from
the parent churches in England and call themselves by fancy names. 
The more freedom they have in their religious life, the less they
are likely to think about politics.  But I soon found out that
Laputa was none of your flabby educated negroes from America,
and I began to watch him.</p>

<p>'I first came across him at a revival meeting in London, where
he was a great success.  He came and spoke to me about my soul,
but he gave up when I dropped into Zulu.  The next time I met
him was on the lower Limpopo, when I had the pleasure of trying
to shoot him from a boat.' Captain Arcoll took his pipe from his
mouth and laughed at the recollection.</p>

<p>'I had got on to an <em>I.D.B. </em>gang, and to my amazement
found the evangelist among them.  But the Reverend John was too
much for me.  He went overboard in spite of the crocodiles, and
managed to swim below water to the reed bed at the side. However,
that was a valuable experience for me, for it gave me a clue.</p>

<p>'I next saw him at a Missionary Conference in Cape Town, and
after that at a meeting of the Geographical Society in London,
where I had a long talk with him.  My reputation does not follow
me home, and he thought I was an English publisher with an interest
in missions.  You see I had no evidence to connect him with <em>I.D.B.,
</em>and besides I fancied that his real game was something bigger
than that; so I just bided my time and watched.</p>

<p>'I did my best to get on to his dossier, but it was no easy job.
However, I found out a few things.  He had been educated in the
States, and well educated too, for the man is a good scholar and
a great reader, besides the finest natural orator I have ever
heard.  There was no doubt that he was of Zulu blood, but I could
get no traces of his family.  He must come of high stock, for
he is a fine figure of a man. 'Very soon I found it was no good
following him in his excursions into civilization.  There he was
merely the educated Kaffir; a great pet of missionary societies,
and a favourite speaker at Church meetings.  You will find evidence
given by him in Blue-Books on native affairs, and he counted many
members of Parliament at home among his correspondents.  I let
that side go, and resolved to dog him when on his evangelizing
tours in the back-veld.</p>

<p>'For six months I stuck to him like a leech.  I am pretty good
at disguises, and he never knew who was the broken-down old Kaffir
who squatted in the dirt at the edge of the crowd when he spoke,
or the half-caste who called him "Sir" and drove his Cape-cart. 
I had some queer adventures, but these can wait. The gist of the
thing is, that after six months which turned my hair grey I got
a glimmering of what he was after.  He talked Christianity to
the mobs in the kraals, but to the indunas[3] he told a different
story.'</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll helped himself to a drink.  'You can guess what
that story was, Mr Crawfurd.  At full moon when the black cock
was blooded, the Reverend John forgot his Christianity. He was
back four centuries among the Mazimba sweeping down on the Zambesi. 
He told them, and they believed him, that he was the Umkulunkulu,
the incarnated spirit of Prester John.  He told them that he was
there to lead the African race to conquest and empire.  Ay, and
he told them more: for he has, or says he has, the Great Snake
itself, the necklet of Prester John.'</p>

<p>Neither of us spoke; we were too occupied with fitting this news
into our chain of knowledge.</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll went on.  'Now that I knew his purpose, I set
myself to find out his preparations.  It was not long before I
found a mighty organization at work from the Zambesi to the Cape. 
The great tribes were up to their necks in the conspiracy, and
all manner of little sects had been taken in.  I have sat at tribal
councils and been sworn a blood brother, and I have used the secret
password to get knowledge in odd places.  It was a dangerous game,
and, as I have said, I had my adventures, but I came safe out
of it&mdash;with my knowledge.</p>

<p>'The first thing I found out was that there was a great deal
of wealth somewhere among the tribes.  Much of it was in diamonds,
which the labourers stole from the mines and the chiefs impounded. 
Nearly every tribe had its secret chest, and our friend Laputa
had the use of them all.  Of course the difficulty was changing
the diamonds into coin, and he had to start <em>I.D.B. </em>on
a big scale.  Your pal, Henriques, was the chief agent for this,
but he had others at Mozambique and Johannesburg, ay, and in London,
whom I have on my list.  With the money, guns and ammunition were
bought, and it seems that a pretty flourishing trade has been
going on for some time. They came in mostly overland through Portuguese
territory, though there have been cases of consignments to Johannesburg
houses, the contents of which did not correspond with the invoice. 
You ask what the Governments were doing to let this go on. Yes,
and you may well ask.  They were all asleep.  They never dreamed
of danger from the natives, and in any case it was difficult to
police the Portuguese side.  Laputa knew our weakness, and he
staked everything on it.</p>

<p>'My first scheme was to lay Laputa by the heels; but no Government
would act on my information.  The man was strongly buttressed
by public support at home, and South Africa has burned her fingers
before this with arbitrary arrests. Then I tried to fasten <em>I.D.B.
</em>on him, but I could not get my proofs till too late.  I nearly
had him in Durban, but he got away; and he never gave me a second
chance.  For five months he and Henriques have been lying low,
because their scheme was getting very ripe.  I have been following
them through Zululand and Gazaland, and I have discovered that
the train is ready, and only wants the match.  For a month I have
never been more than five hours behind him on the trail; and if
he has laid his train, I have laid mine also.'</p>

<p>Arcoll's whimsical, humorous face had hardened into grimness,
and in his eyes there was the light of a fierce purpose. The sight
of him comforted me, in spite of his tale.</p>

<p>'But what can he hope to do?' I asked.  'Though he roused every
Kaffir in South Africa he would be beaten.  You say he is an educated
man.  He must know he has no chance in the long run.'</p>

<p>'I said he was an educated man, but he is also a Kaffir.  He
can see the first stage of a thing, and maybe the second, but
no more.  That is the native mind.  If it was not like that our
chance would be the worse.'</p>

<p>'You say the scheme is ripe,' I said; 'how ripe?'</p>

<p>Arcoll looked at the clock.  'In half an hour's time Laputa will
be with 'Mpefu.  There he will stay the night.  To-morrow morning
he goes to Umvelos' to meet Henriques.  To-morrow evening the
gathering begins.'</p>

<p>'One question,' I said.  'How big a man is Laputa?'</p>

<p>'The biggest thing that the Kaffirs have ever produced.  I tell
you, in my opinion he is a great genius.  If he had been white
he might have been a second Napoleon.  He is a born leader of
men, and as brave as a lion.  There is no villainy he would not
do if necessary, and yet I should hesitate to call him a blackguard. 
Ay, you may look surprised at me, you two pragmatical Scotsmen;
but I have, so to speak, lived with the man for months, and there's
fineness and nobility in him.  He would be a terrible enemy, but
a just one.  He has the heart of a poet and a king, and it is
God's curse that he has been born among the children of Ham. 
I hope to shoot him like a dog in a day or two, but I am glad
to bear testimony to his greatness.'</p>

<p>'If the rising starts to-morrow,' I asked, 'have you any of his
plans?'</p>

<p>He picked up a map from the table and opened it.  'The first
rendezvous is somewhere near Sikitola's.  Then they move south,
picking up contingents; and the final concentration is to be on
the high veld near Amsterdam, which is convenient for the Swazis
and the Zulus.  After that I know nothing, but of course there
are local concentrations along the whole line of the Berg from
Mashonaland to Basutoland.  Now, look here. To get to Amsterdam
they must cross the Delagoa Bay Railway. Well, they won't be allowed
to.  If they get as far, they will be scattered there.  As I told
you, I too have laid my train.  We have the police ready all along
the scarp of the Berg. Every exit from native territory is watched,
and the frontier farmers are out on commando.  We have regulars
on the Delagoa Bay and Natal lines, and a system of field telegraphs
laid which can summon further troops to any point.  It has all
been kept secret, because we are still in the dark ourselves.
The newspaper public knows nothing about any rising, but in two
days every white household in South Africa will be in a panic. 
Make no mistake, Mr Crawfurd; this is a grim business. We shall
smash Laputa and his men, but it will be a fierce fight, and there
will be much good blood shed.  Besides, it will throw the country
back another half-century. Would to God I had been man enough
to put a bullet through his head in cold blood.  But I could not
do it&mdash;it was too like murder; and maybe I shall never have the
chance now.'</p>

<p>'There's one thing puzzles me,' I said.  'What makes Laputa come
up here to start with?  Why doesn't he begin with Zululand?'</p>

<p>'God knows!  There's sure to be sense in it, for he does nothing
without reason.  We may know to-morrow.'</p>

<p>But as Captain Arcoll spoke, the real reason suddenly flashed
into my mind: Laputa had to get the Great Snake, the necklet of
Prester John, to give his leadership prestige.  Apparently he
had not yet got it, or Arcoll would have known.  He started from
this neighbourhood because the fetich was somewhere hereabouts. 
I was convinced that my guess was right, but I kept my own counsel.</p>

<p>'To-morrow Laputa and Henriques meet at Umvelos', probably at
your new store, Mr Crawfurd.  And so the ball commences.'</p>

<p>My resolution was suddenly taken.</p>

<p>'I think,' I said, 'I had better be present at the meeting, as
representing the firm.'</p>

<p>Captain Arcoll stared at me and laughed.  'I had thought of going
myself,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then you go to certain death, disguise yourself as you please. 
You cannot meet them in the store as I can.  I'm there on my ordinary
business, and they will never suspect.  If you're to get any news,
I'm the man to go.'</p>

<p>He looked at me steadily for a minute or so.  'I'm not sure that's
such a bad idea of yours.  I would be better employed myself on
the Berg, and, as you say, I would have little chance of hearing
anything. You're a plucky fellow, Mr Crawfurd.  I suppose you
understand that the risk is pretty considerable.'</p>

<p>'I suppose I do; but since I'm in this thing, I may as well see
it out. Besides, I've an old quarrel with our friend Laputa.'</p>

<p>'Good and well,' said Captain Arcoll.  'Draw in your chair to
the table, then, and I'll explain to you the disposition of my
men.  I should tell you that I have loyal natives in my pay in
most tribes, and can count on early intelligence.  We can't match
their telepathy; but the new type of field telegraph is not so
bad, and may be a trifle more reliable.'</p>

<p>Till midnight we pored over maps, and certain details were burned
in on my memory.  Then we went to bed and slept soundly, even
Mr Wardlaw.  It was strange how fear had gone from the establishment,
now that we knew the worst and had a fighting man by our side.</p>
