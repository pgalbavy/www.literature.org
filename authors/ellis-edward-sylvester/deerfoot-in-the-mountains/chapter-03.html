<p>The small lake which was the destination of Deerfoot seemed to
be only two or three miles distant, but he knew it was all of
twenty miles away. Being on foot, he took the most direct course.
The route of the horses was of necessity so tortuous and difficult
that it must have been fully a half greater than the direct one.
The task was so easy for the Shawanoe that he did not lope or
run, but kept up his swinging gait, which caused him not the least
fatigue. Now and then he was forced to make a circuit around a
mass of rocks, or a densely wooded section, but these diversions
were of little account. They might have been twice as extensive
and still he would not have minded them.</p>

<p>When near the body of water he climbed another ridge, upon whose
crest the growth of wood was slight, and took a sweeping survey
of the surrounding country. The scenery was magnificent and impressive.
Far to the northward rose a towering range of mountains, whose
snowy peaks pierced the sky and suggested enormous white clouds
piled against the horizon. To the west rose another range, one
of whose summits was loftier than any within his range of vision.
Seen in the far distance, the soft air gave it a slight bluish
tint, which gradually dissolved into fleecy whiteness toward the
crest. To the eastward the landscape was made up of ridges, elevations
and valleys, with growths of pine, cedar, oak and other species
of wood. The lake's outlet was toward the west, winding in and
out among the depressions until a curve hid it from sight fully
a score of miles away.</p>

<p>There was a biting sharpness in the air that told of the nearness
of winter, for the month of November was come, and in that northern
latitude the rigorous season would soon set in. A whiff of air
which fanned the face of the Indian brought the chill of snow
and ice in it, while here and there the leaves of some of the
deciduous trees drifted downward like the soft falling flakes
of snow.</p>

<p>Deerfoot raised the glass to his eyes and slowly swept the field
of vision. It was a striking proof of the solitude of this immense
region that he did not see the first sign of a human being. No
horsemen riding across the open spaces or climbing the wooded
heights formed a part of the picture, nor in any direction could
he detect the faint smoke of a camp fire. Wherever the Nez Perces
whom he was pursuing might be, they were still a long distance
away.</p>

<p>But the diversified landscape did not lack animal life. The most
interesting sight was that of two grizzly bears, that were frolicking
like a couple of puppies in an open space at the foot of a slight
elevation. Deerfoot held the glass pointed at them for some minutes
and more than once smiled at the odd picture. The great hulking
brutes tumbled, rolled, pawed and boxed each other, all the while
pretending to bite and yet taking care that neither tooth nor
nail did harm. Then one would start to run off, as if frightened,
with the other in hot pursuit. When overtaken, and sometimes before,
the fugitive would wheel and cuff and bite at the other, as if
in a dreadful rage. You know how amusing the antics of kittens
and puppies are. Imagine, if you can, two enormous bears disporting
themselves in the same comical fashion, and you will understand
why the Shawanoe watched the couple minute after minute, forgetting
for the time the serious business on which he was engaged.</p>

<p>But this was not all that attracted him in his surroundings.
From out the undergrowth on the northern side of the stream forming
the outlet of the lake came two or three hundred buffaloes, their
dusky bodies imparting a strange appearance of agitation to that
portion of the landscape. They headed for the stream, which was
no more than a hundred feet in width, and plunged in, pausing
long enough to drink, flirting their tails and tossing their heads,
bellowing and crowding one another. The water was too shallow
to force them to swim, but it was splashed and flung in all directions.
When those at the front emerged they broke into a gallop, with
the others dashing tumultuously after them.</p>

<p>Their course brought them within a few rods of the base of the
elevation on which Deerfoot was standing. He walked down the slope
until quite near the head of the herd, when he brought his rifle
to his shoulder and sent a bullet just back of the foreleg of
one of the bulls. The stricken beast made a single plunging dive
and then rolled over dead. Being on the fringe of the herd he
was not trampled upon, and none of his companions paid any attention
to him. The bison is&mdash;or rather <em>was</em>&mdash;a stupid creature,
his own destruction often resulting from his lack of ordinary
intelligence.</p>

<p>Deerfoot waited until the last animal had passed, when he went
forward to where the carcass of the game lay and deftly extracted
its tongue. He did not touch any other portion, but, washing the
delicacy in the stream, carried it to the small grove of trees
which he had fixed upon in his mind as the place of the encampment
of the Nez Perces, on their first day after leaving their village.</p>

<p>Before he reached the shelter of the clump of trees the quick
eye of the Shawanoe saw the imprints of hoofs, and signs of a
party of horsemen having halted at the spot. Chief Amokeat and
his Nez Perces had made their first meal on fish drawn from the
lake, as was shown by the fragments of their feast scattered round.
Considerable ashes indicated the spot where a fire had been kindled,
in the usual primitive manner of spinning a light pointed stick,
whose sharpened end was thrust into another dry branch.</p>

<p>Thus Deerfoot's calculations proved to be right. He had reached
the scene of the midday halt of the Nez Perces by traveling about
two-thirds of the distance of his predecessors. With his flint
and steel he soon had a blaze going. Over it he broiled the bison
tongue, cut into thin strips, and ate his fill. The meal was a
big one for him, and he would not go out of his way to procure
any more food for twenty-four hours or more. Taking a long draught
from the cold, crystalline waters, he resumed his journey, which
was due north, his blanket fastened about his shoulders, and his
rifle sometimes resting in the crook made by bending his left
arm at the elbow, after the style of modern sportsmen, held sometimes
in a trailing position, and again reposing upon his shoulder.</p>

<p>For two miles or more he kept to the trail, inasmuch as it was
direct and nothing was to be gained by leaving it. With his senses
alert, he finally turned to the right, in order to take advantage
of a mass of rocks on ground so elevated that a more extensive
view than the former one could be secured. He climbed as nimbly
as a monkey to the top, glanced over the many square miles spread
out before his gaze and then looked northward.</p>

<p>Ah! he saw something suggestive. The glass was pointed toward
the spot and instantly confirmed the unaided eye. In the horizon,
in the mist of a stretch of wooded country, he observed a faint,
almost invisible line of vapor climbing upward into the cold blue
sky, and gradually dissolving, until at the height of a hundred
feet or less all trace of it vanished.</p>

<p>The most careful scrutiny could not tell anything more. The spot
was between fifteen and twenty miles away, with the roughest sort
of country intervening. It was a good day's journey distant, but
in the same moment that Deerfoot made his interesting discovery
he resolved to thread his way to the place without a minute's
halt on his part until he reached his destination.</p>

<p>His quick mind instantly saw several explanations of the "sign."
It could not be the Nez Perces riding north, for it was impossible
that they had lagged to such an extent on the road. If it was
Amokeat and his party, they must be returning from their raid,
or hunting expedition, or whatever had engaged their energies.
It would seem more likely that the Indians belonged to some other
tribe. Be that as it may, the only means of answering the question
was by finding out for himself, and that Deerfoot started to do
with the grim, unshakable resolution of his nature.</p>

<p>With all his matchless swiftness and endurance, he would not
have been able to travel the distance until the night was well
advanced; for, though there were numerous places where he broke
into his fleet lope, and more than once rose to a higher pace,
he was compelled to make detours that greatly lengthened the distance
and added to the labor. Again, a moderate walk was the best he
could do.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon he came upon the bank of a
deep, swift stream fully a hundred yards wide. No doubt he could
have found a ford had he taken the time to search for it, but
the minutes were too valuable to waste. With hardly a moment's
hesitation he took three steps over the flinty floor, and then
found he had to swim. He had not so much as loosened the blanket
looped about his shoulders and which threatened to interfere with
the movements of his arms. He held his rifle above his head, so
as to prevent any water running into the barrel, either at the
muzzle or by percolation at the vent, and swam with his other
arm and his feet. For a portion of the way he "trod water," apparently
with the same ease that he walked upon solid earth. So he overcame
the powerful current and emerged almost directly opposite the
point where he had entered. You will remember that in approaching
the stream he left the trail some time before, but he knew it
was not far off, and doubtless would have led him to a ford. That
he would not dally long enough to hunt out the more convenient
crossing place was another illustration of Deerfoot's indifference
to his own comfort. What though his garments were dripping when
he stepped upon solid earth again, and the air was almost wintry
in its chill, he cared naught. The exercise threw his frame into
a glow and the moisture gradually left his clothing.</p>

<p>A few miles farther and the Shawanoe solved one question over
which he had been speculating. In the distance he caught sight
of a party of horsemen approaching from the direction of the camp
whose smoke he had noticed hours before. They were no more than
two or three miles distant, and when first seen were coming almost
in a direct line for Deerfoot.</p>

<p>The first sight was that of a single horseman, who had ridden
up the farther side of a slope, and came into view as he neared
the top. Without pausing, he began the descent, and was followed
by others, all in single file, until seventeen rode into the field
of vision. Before Deerfoot brought his glass into use he had recognized
the horsemen as Nez Perces. They were returning from their expedition,
and if the statement of the number that had left home was correct,
had lost at least three.</p>

<p>The spyglass disclosed the chieftain Amokeat to the Shawanoe,
who, with his horse on a walk, was riding at the head of the procession.
The instrument revealed another significant fact:</p>

<p>Neither Amokeat nor any of his warriors was mounted on Whirlwind.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had to struggle to restrain his indignation. Had he
been within reach of Amokeat at that moment, it is not unlikely
he would have dragged him from his horse and given him a lesson
he could never forget. The very thing the Shawanoe had feared
from the first had occurred: the stallion was either stolen or
dead.</p>

<p>But as Deerfoot advanced to meet the party, who soon observed
and identified him, he pulled himself together. It would have
taken one who knew him intimately, like Simon Kenton, or George
or Victor Shelton, to read in the slightly pale face and peculiar
gleam of the dark eyes the evidence of the emotion that the Shawanoe
held well under control.</p>

<p>It was in the depth of a broad valley, where there was a semblance
to a trail which had been made by bison or other animals on their
way to water, that Chief Amokeat drew up and awaited the approach
of the Shawanoe. The latter, as was his custom, made a half-military
salute, and, without any more preliminaries came to the point.
He used the Blackfoot tongue, which was familiar to the Nez Perce.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot seeks his horse. Where is he?"</p>

<p>Amokeat must have expected the question, for he shook his head
and answered in the language of the Blackfeet:</p>

<p>"Amokeat is grieved to tell Deerfoot he will never see the horse
he loves again. It saddens the heart of Amokeat, but he speaks
with a single tongue."</p>

<p>"Is my horse dead?"</p>

<p>"That Amokeat does not know. Yesterday the Assiniboines took
him from us, and they are now far on their way to their villages."</p>

<p>"Why did Amokeat take my horse from where Deerfoot had left him?
Why did he not wait until he could see Deerfoot and ask him. He
has stolen my horse."</p>

<p>This was a pointed charge, but Deerfoot could not wholly curb
his anger. The chief, however, did not seem to feel the sting
of the words, though more than one of his warriors, who had drawn
up their horses and were looking on and listening, showed resentment.</p>

<p>Amokeat now proceeded to tell in his own way what had befallen
him and his companions. He said they had started out for a hunt,
though expecting to have an encounter with some of their enemies
before their return. At a point about a hundred miles to the northeast,
while riding through a cañon, they were suddenly attacked by fully
a hundred red men, whom they recognized as Assiniboines that were
a long way from their hunting grounds.</p>

<p>While it is more than likely the Nez Perce leader exaggerated
the number of his assailants, no doubt they were superior to the
smaller company. The latter put up a brave fight, but before they
could extricate themselves from the trap five of their number
were shot from their horses. This statement showed that originally
the Nez Perces numbered more than a score.</p>

<p>Amokeat was on the back of Whirlwind, who carried him off with
such amazing speed that he was soon separated from his warriors.
Deerfoot's lips curled when he heard this statement, for to him
it was a proof of the cowardice of the chief. The party had no
time to recover the bodies of their fallen comrades, who were
left to be scalped and despoiled by the victors, the stray horses
also passing into the hands of the Assiniboines.</p>

<p>Amokeat was in full flight when, in dashing through a mass of
undergrowth, he suddenly came face to face with eight or ten Assiniboines
(probably the number was less). He was ambushed so cleverly that
escape was out of the question. He would have resisted, however,
had not one of his enemies called out that he wished to have a
parley with him.</p>

<p>This warrior, who was the leader of the little party, told Amokeat
that if he would swap the black stallion he rode for the pony
of the Assiniboines, the chief would not be harmed, but would
be left free to go to his own home. Had the grinning Nez Perce
put his conclusion in English, it would have been something like
this:</p>

<p>"I counted myself most fortunate, for what was to prevent the
Assiniboines from shooting me from the back of the stallion and
then taking him away with them? So the trade was made and he is
now in the hands of the Assiniboines."</p>
