<p>The most urgent problem in China's relations with foreign powers
is Japanese aggression. Originally Japan was less powerful than
China, but after 1868 the Japanese rapidly learnt from us whatever
we had to teach in the way of skilful homicide, and in 1894 they
resolved to test their new armaments upon China, just as Bismarck
tested his on Denmark. The Chinese Government preserved its traditional
haughtiness, and appears to have been quite unaware of the defeat
in store for it. The question at issue was Korea, over which both
Powers claimed suzerainty. At that time there would have been
no reason for an impartial neutral to take one side rather than
the other. The Japanese were quickly and completely victorious,
but were obliged to fight Russia before obtaining secure possession
of Korea. The war with Russia (1904-5) was fought chiefly in Manchuria,
which the Russians had gained as a reward for befriending China.
Port Arthur and Southern Manchuria up to Mukden were acquired
by the Japanese as a result of the Russo-Japanese war; the rest
of Manchuria came under Japanese control as a result of Russia's
collapse after the Great War.</p>

<p>The nominal sovereignty in Manchuria is still Chinese; the Chinese
have the civil administration, an army, and the appointment of
the Viceroy. But the Japanese also have troops in Manchuria; they
have the railways, the industrial enterprises, and the complete
economic and military control. The Chinese Viceroy could not remain
in power a week if he were displeasing to the Japanese, which,
however, he takes care not to be. (See Note A.) The same situation
was being brought about in Shantung.</p>

<p>Shantung brings us to what Japan did in the Great War. In 1914,
China could easily have been induced to join the Allies and to
set to work to turn the Germans out of Kiao-Chow, but this did
not suit the Japanese, who undertook the work themselves and insisted
upon the Chinese remaining neutral (until 1917). Having captured
Tsing-tau, they presented to the Chinese the famous Twenty-One
Demands, which gave the Chinese Question its modern form. These
demands, as originally presented in January 1915, consisted of
five groups. The first dealt with Shantung, demanding that China
should agree in advance to whatever terms Japan might ultimately
make with Germany as regarded this Chinese province, that the
Japanese should have the right to construct certain specified
railways, and that certain ports (unspecified) should be opened
to trade; also that no privileges in Shantung should be granted
to any Power other than Japan. The second group concerns South
Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia, and demands what is in effect
a protectorate, with control of railways, complete economic freedom
for Japanese enterprise, and exclusion of all other foreign industrial
enterprise. The third group gives Japan a monopoly of the mines
and iron and steel works in a certain region of the Yangtze,[63]
where we claim a sphere of influence. The fourth group consists
of a single demand, that China shall not cede any harbour, bay
or island to any Power except Japan. The fifth group, which was
the most serious, demanded that Japanese political, financial,
and military advisers should be employed by the Chinese Government;
that the police in important places should be administered by
Chinese and Japanese jointly, and should be largely Japanese in
<em>personnel</em>; that China should purchase from Japan at least
50 per cent. of her munitions, or obtain them from a Sino-Japanese
arsenal to be established in China, controlled by Japanese experts
and employing Japanese material; that Japan should have the right
to construct certain railways in and near the Yangtze valley;
that Japan should have industrial priority in Fukien (opposite
Formosa); and finally that the Japanese should have the right
of missionary propaganda in China, to spread the knowledge of
their admirable ethics.</p>

<p>These demands involved, as is obvious, a complete loss of Chinese
independence, the closing of important areas to the commerce and
industry of Europe and America, and a special attack upon the
British position in the Yangtze. We, however, were so busy with
the war that we had no time to think of keeping ourselves alive.
Although the demands constituted a grave menace to our trade,
although the Far East was in an uproar about them, although America
took drastic diplomatic action against them, Mr. Lloyd George
never heard of them until they were explained to him by the Chinese
Delegation at Versailles.[64] He had no time to find out what
Japan wanted, but had time to conclude a secret agreement with
Japan in February 1917, promising that whatever Japan wanted in
Shantung we would support at the Peace Conference.[65] By the
terms of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, Japan was bound to communicate
the Twenty-one Demands to the British Government. In fact, Japan
communicated the first four groups, but not the fifth and worst,
thus definitely breaking the treaty;[66] but this also, one must
suppose, Mr. Lloyd George only discovered by chance when he got
to Versailles.</p>

<p>China negotiated with Japan about the Twenty-one Demands, and
secured certain modifications, but was finally compelled to yield
by an ultimatum. There was a modification as regards the Hanyehping
mines on the Yangtze, presumably to please us; and the specially
obnoxious fifth group was altered into an exchange of studiously
vague Notes.[67] In this form, the demands were accepted by China
on May 9, 1915. The United States immediately notified Japan that
they could not recognize the agreement. At that time America was
still neutral, and was therefore still able to do something to
further the objects for which we were supposed to be fighting,
such as protection of the weaker nations. In 1917, however, after
America had entered the war for self-determination, it became
necessary to placate Japan, and in November of that year the Ishii-Lansing
Agreement was concluded, by which "the Government of the United
States recognizes that Japan has special interests in China, particularly
for the parts to which her possessions are contiguous." The rest
of the agreement (which is long) consists of empty verbiage.[68]</p>

<p>I come now to the events leading up to China's entry into the
war.[69] In this matter, the lead was taken by America so far
as severing diplomatic relations was concerned, but passed to
Japan as regards the declaration of war. It will be remembered
that, when America broke off diplomatic relations with Germany,
President Wilson called upon all neutrals to do likewise. Dr.
Paul S. Reinsch, United States Minister in Peking, proceeded to
act with vigour in accordance with this policy. He induced China
first, on February 9, 1917, to send a Note of expostulation to
Germany on the subject of the submarine campaign; then, on March
14th, to break off diplomatic relations. The further step of declaring
war was not taken until August 14th. The intrigues connected with
these events deserve some study.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the Japanese were among the Allies,
the Chinese had not any strong tendency to take sides against
Germany. The English, French and Russians had always desired the
participation of China (for reasons which I shall explain presently),
and there appears to have been some suggestion, in the early days
of the war, that China should participate in return for our recognizing
Yuan Shi-k'ai as Emperor. These suggestions, however, fell through
owing to the opposition of Japan, based partly on hostility to
Yuan Shi-k'ai, partly on the fear that China would be protected
by the Allies if she became a belligerent. When, in November 1915,
the British, French and Russian Ambassadors in Tokyo requested
Japan to join in urging China to join the Allies, Viscount Ishii
said that "Japan considered developments in China as of paramount
interest to her, and she must keep a firm hand there. Japan could
not regard with equanimity the organization of an efficient Chinese
army such as would be required for her active participation in
the war, nor could Japan fail to regard with uneasiness a liberation
of the economic activities of 400,000,000 people."[70] Accordingly
the proposal lapsed. It must be understood that throughout the
war the Japanese were in a position to blackmail the Allies, because
their sympathies were with Germany, they believed Germany would
win, and they filled their newspapers with scurrilous attacks
on the British, accusing them of cowardice and military incompetence.[71]</p>

<p>But when America severed diplomatic relations with Germany, the
situation for China was changed. America was not bound to subservience
to Japan, as we were; America was not one of the Allies; and America
had always been China's best friend. Accordingly, the Chinese
were willing to take the advice of America, and proceeded to sever
diplomatic relations with Germany in March 1917. Dr. Reinsch was
careful to make no <em>promises</em> to the Chinese, but of course
he held out hopes. The American Government, at that time, could
honestly hold out hopes, because it was ignorant of the secret
treaties and agreements by which the Allies were bound. The Allies,
however, can offer no such excuse for having urged China to take
the further step of declaring war. Russia, France, and Great Britain
had all sold China's rights to secure the continued support of
Japan.</p>

<p>In May 1916, the Japanese represented to the Russians that Germany
was inviting Japan to make a separate peace. In July 1916, Russia
and Japan concluded a secret treaty, subsequently published by
the Bolsheviks. This treaty constituted a separate alliance, binding
each to come to the assistance of the other in any war, and recognizing
that "the vital interests of one and the other of them require
the safeguarding of China from the political domination of any
third Power whatsoever, having hostile designs against Russia
or Japan." The last article provided that "the present agreement
must remain profoundly secret except to both of the High Contracting
Parties."[72] That is to say, the treaty was not communicated
to the other Allies, or even to Great Britain, in spite of Article
3 of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which provides that "The High
Contracting Parties agree that neither of them will, without consulting
the other, enter into a separate agreement with another Power
to the prejudice of the objects described in the preamble of this
Agreement," one of which objects was the preservation of equal
opportunity for all Powers in China and of the independence and
integrity of the Chinese Empire.</p>

<p>On February 16, 1917, at the very time when America was urging
China to sever diplomatic relations with Germany, we concluded
an agreement with Japan containing the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
His Britannic Majesty's Government accedes with pleasure to the<br/>
request of the Japanese Government, for an assurance that they<br/>
will support Japan's claims in regard to the disposal of<br/>
Germany's rights in Shantung and possessions in the islands north<br/>
of the equator on the occasion of the Peace Conference; it being<br/>
understood that the Japanese Government will, in the eventual<br/>
peace settlement, treat in the same spirit Great Britain's claims<br/>
to the German islands south of the equator.

</p>
</div>
<p>The French attitude about Shantung, at the same time, is indicated
by Notes which passed between France and Japan at Tokyo.[73] On
February 19th, Baron Motono sent a communication to the French
and Russian Ambassadors stating, among other things, that "the
Imperial Japanese Government proposes to demand from Germany at
the time of the peace negotiations, the surrender of the territorial
rights and special interests Germany possessed before the war
in Shantung and the islands belonging to her situated north of
the equator in the Pacific Ocean." The French Ambassador, on March
2nd, replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
The Government of the French Republic is disposed to give the<br/>
Japanese Government its accord in regulating at the time of the<br/>
Peace Negotiations questions vital to Japan concerning Shantung<br/>
and the German islands on the Pacific north of the equator. It<br/>
also agrees to support the demands of the Imperial Japanese<br/>
Government for the surrender of the rights Germany possessed<br/>
before the war in this Chinese province and these islands.

</p>
<p>
M. Briand demands on the other hand that Japan give its support<br/>
to obtain from China the breaking of its diplomatic relations<br/>
with Germany, and that it give this act desirable significance.<br/>
The consequences in China should be the following:

</p>
<p>
First, handing passports to the German diplomatic agents and<br/>
consuls;

</p>
<p>
Second, the obligation of all under German jurisdiction to leave<br/>
Chinese territory;

</p>
<p>
Third, the internment of German ships in Chinese ports and the<br/>
ultimate requisition of these ships in order to place them at the<br/>
disposition of the Allies, following the example of Italy and<br/>
Portugal;

</p>
<p>
Fourth, requisition of German commercial houses, established in<br/>
China; forfeiting the rights of Germany in the concessions she<br/>
possesses in certain ports of China.

</p>
</div>
<p>The Russian reply to Baron Motono's Note to the French and Russian
Ambassadors, dated March 5, 1917, was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
In reply to the Note of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs,<br/>
under the date of February 19th last, the Russian Embassy is<br/>
charged with giving the Japanese Government the assurance that it<br/>
can entirely count on the support of the Imperial Government of<br/>
Russia with regard to its desiderata concerning the eventual<br/>
surrender to Japan of the rights belonging to Germany in Shantung<br/>
and of the German Islands, occupied by the Japanese forces, in<br/>
the Pacific Ocean to the north of the Equator.[74]

</p>
</div>
<p>It will be observed that, unlike England and France, Russia demands
no <em>quid pro quo</em>, doubtless owing to the secret treaty
concluded in the previous year.</p>

<p>After these agreements, Japan saw no further objection to China's
participation in the war. The chief inducement held out to China
was the hope of recovering Shantung; but as there was now no danger
of this hope being realized, Japan was willing that America, in
more or less honest ignorance, should unofficially use this hope
for the persuasion of the Chinese. It is true that Japan had reason
to fear America until the last days of the Peace Conference, but
this fear was considerably diminished by the conclusion of the
Lansing-Ishii Agreement in November 1917.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Japan had discovered that the question of China's entry
into the war could be used to increase internal strife in China,
which has been one of the aims of Japanese policy ever since the
beginning of the revolutionary movement.[75] If the Chinese had
not been interfered with at this time, there was some prospect
of their succeeding in establishing a stable democratic government.
Yuan was dead, and his successor in the Presidency, Li Yuan Hung,
was a genuine constitutionalist. He reassembled the Parliament
which Yuan had dismissed, and the work of drafting a permanent
constitution was resumed. The President was opposed to severing
diplomatic relations, and, of course, still more to declaring
war. The Prime Minister, Tuan Chih-jui, a militarist, was strongly
in favour of war. He and his Cabinet persuaded a considerable
majority of both Houses of the Chinese Parliament to side with
them on the question of severing diplomatic relations, and the
President, as in duty bound, gave way on this issue.</p>

<p>On the issue of declaring war, however, public opinion was different.
It was President Wilson's summons to the neutrals to follow him
in breaking off diplomatic relations that had given force to the
earlier campaign; but on June 5th the American Minister, acting
on instructions, presented a Note to the Chinese Government urging
that the preservation of national unity was more important than
entry into the war, and suggesting the desirability of preserving
peace for the present. What had happened in the meantime was that
the war issue, which might never have become acute but for President's
Wilson's action, had been used by the Japanese to revive the conflict
between North and South, and to instigate the Chinese militarists
to unconstitutional action. Sun Yat Sen and most of the Southern
politicians were opposed to the declaration of war; Sun's reasons
were made known in an open letter to Mr. Lloyd George on March
7th. They were thoroughly sound.[76] The Cabinet, on May 1st,
decided in favour of war, but by the Constitution a declaration
of war required the consent of Parliament. The militarists attempted
to coerce Parliament, which had a majority against war; but as
this proved impossible, they brought military force to bear on
the President to compel him to dissolve Parliament unconstitutionally.
The bulk of the Members of Parliament retired to the South, where
they continued to act as a Parliament and to regard themselves
as the sole source of constitutional government. After these various
illegalities, the military autocrats were still compelled to deal
with one of their number, who, in July, effected a five days'
restoration of the Manchu Emperor. The President resigned, and
was succeeded by a person more agreeable to the militarists, who
have henceforth governed in the North, sometimes without a Parliament,
sometimes with a subservient unconstitutional Northern Parliament.
Then at last they were free to declare war. It was thus that China
entered the war for democracy and against militarism.</p>

<p>Of course China helped little, if at all, towards the winning
of the war, but that was not what the Allies expected of her.
The objects of the European Allies are disclosed in the French
Note quoted above. We wished to confiscate German property in
China, to expel Germans living in China, and to prevent, as far
as possible, the revival of German trade in China after the war.
The confiscation of German property was duly carried out&mdash;not
only public property, but private property also, so that the Germans
in China were suddenly reduced to beggary. Owing to the claims
on shipping, the expulsion of the Germans had to wait till after
the Armistice. They were sent home through the Tropics in overcrowded
ships, sometimes with only 24 hours' notice; no degree of hardship
was sufficient to secure exemption. The British authorities insisted
on expelling delicate pregnant women, whom they officially knew
to be very likely to die on the voyage. All this was done after
the Armistice, for the sake of British trade. The kindly Chinese
often took upon themselves to hide Germans, in hard cases, from
the merciless persecution of the Allies; otherwise, the miseries
inflicted would have been much greater.</p>

<p>The confiscation of private property during the war and by the
Treaty of Versailles was a new departure, showing that on this
point all the belligerents agreed with the Bolsheviks. Dr. Reid
places side by side two statements, one by President Wilson when
asking Congress to agree to the Declaration of War: "We shall,
I feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without
passion, and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles
of right and fairplay we profess to be fighting for"; the other
by Senator Hitchcock, when the war was over, after a day spent
with President Wilson in learning the case for ratification of
the Versailles Treaty: "Through the Treaty, we will yet get very
much of importance.... In violation of all international law and
treaties we have made disposition of a billion dollars of German-owned
properly here. The Treaty validates all that."[77] The European
Allies secured very similar advantages from inducing China to
enter the war for righteousness.</p>

<p>We have seen what England and France gained by the Chinese declaration
of war. What Japan gained was somewhat different.</p>

<p>The Northern military faction, which controlled the Peking Government,
was completely dependent upon Japan, and could do nothing to resist
Japanese aggression. All the other Powers were fully occupied
with the war, and had sold China to Japan in return for Japanese
neutrality&mdash;for Japan can hardly be counted as a belligerent after
the capture of Tsingtau in November 1914. The Southern Government
and all the liberal elements in the North were against the clique
which had seized the Central Government. In March 1918, military
and naval agreements were concluded between China and Japan, of
which the text, never officially published, is given by Millard.[78]
By these agreements the Japanese were enabled, under pretence
of military needs in Manchuria and Mongolia, to send troops into
Chinese territory, to acquire control of the Chinese Eastern Railway
and consequently of Northern Manchuria, and generally to keep
all Northern China at their mercy. In all this, the excuse of
operations against the Bolsheviks was very convenient.</p>

<p>After this the Japanese went ahead gaily. During the year 1918,
they placed loans in China to the extent of Yen 246,000,000,[79]
<em>i.e.,</em> about £25,000,000. China was engaged in civil war,
and both sides were as willing as the European belligerents to
sell freedom for the sake of victory. Unfortunately for Japan,
the side on which Japan was fighting in the war proved suddenly
victorious, and some portion of the energies of Europe and America
became available for holding Japan in check. For various reasons,
however, the effect of this did not show itself until after the
Treaty of Versailles was concluded. During the peace negotiations,
England and France, in virtue of secret agreements, were compelled
to support Japan. President Wilson, as usual, sacrificed everything
to his League of Nations, which the Japanese would not have joined
unless they had been allowed to keep Shantung. The chapter on
this subject in Mr. Lansing's account of the negotiations is one
of the most interesting in his book.[80] By Article 156 of the
Treaty of Versailles, "Germany renounces, in favour of Japan,
all her rights, title, and privileges" in the province of Shantung.[81]
Although President Wilson had consented to this gross violation
of justice, America refused to ratify the Treaty, and was therefore
free to raise the issue of Shantung at Washington. The Chinese
delegates at Versailles resisted the clauses concerning Shantung
to the last, and finally, encouraged by a vigorous agitation of
Young China,[82] refused to sign the Treaty. They saw no reason
why they should be robbed of a province as a reward for having
joined the Allies. All the other Allies agreed to a proceeding
exactly as iniquitous as it would have been if we had annexed
Virginia as a reward to the Americans for having helped us in
the war, or France had annexed Kent on a similar pretext.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Young China had discovered that it could move Chinese
public opinion on the anti-Japanese cry. The Government in Peking
in 1919-20 was in the hands of the pro-Japanese An Fu party, but
they were forcibly ejected, in the summer of 1920, largely owing
to the influence of the Young China agitation on the soldiers
stationed in Peking. The An Fu leaders took refuge in the Japanese
Legation, and since then the Peking Government has ventured to
be less subservient to Japan, hoping always for American support.
Japan did everything possible to consolidate her position in Shantung,
but always with the knowledge that America might re-open the question
at any time. As soon as the Washington Conference was announced,
Japan began feverishly negotiating with China, with a view to
having the question settled before the opening of the Conference.
But the Chinese, very wisely, refused the illusory concessions
offered by Japan, and insisted on almost unconditional evacuation.
At Washington, both parties agreed to the joint mediation of England
and America. The pressure of American public opinion caused the
American Administration to stand firm on the question of Shantung,
and I understand that the British delegation, on the whole, concurred
with America. Some concessions were made to Japan, but they will
not amount to much if American interest in Shantung lasts for
another five years. On this subject, I shall have more to say
when I come to the Washington Conference.</p>

<p>There is a question with which the Washington Conference determined
not to concern itself, but which nevertheless is likely to prove
of great importance in the Far East &mdash;I mean the question
of Russia. It was considered good form in diplomatic circles,
until the Genoa Conference, to pretend that there is no such country
as Russia, but the Bolsheviks, with their usual wickedness, have
refused to fall in with this pretence. Their existence constitutes
an embarrassment to America, because in a quarrel with Japan the
United States would unavoidably find themselves in unwilling alliance
with Russia. The conduct of Japan towards Russia has been quite
as bad as that of any other Power. At the time of the Czecho-Slovak
revolt, the Allies jointly occupied Vladivostok, but after a time
all withdrew except the Japanese. All Siberia east of Lake Baikal,
including Vladivostok, now forms one State, the Far Eastern Republic,
with its capital at Chita. Against this Republic, which is practically
though not theoretically Bolshevik, the Japanese have launched
a whole series of miniature Kolchaks &mdash;Semenov, Horvath,
Ungern, etc. These have all been defeated, but the Japanese remain
in military occupation of Vladivostok and a great part of the
Maritime Province, though they continually affirm their earnest
wish to retire.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Bolshevik régime the Russians lost Northern
Manchuria, which is now controlled by Japan. A board consisting
partly of Chinese and partly of reactionary Russians forms the
directorate of the Chinese Eastern Railway, which runs through
Manchuria and connects with the Siberian Railway. There is not
through communication by rail between Peking and Europe as in
the days before 1914. This is an extreme annoyance to European
business men in the Far East, since it means that letters or journeys
from Peking to London take five or six weeks instead of a fortnight.
They try to persuade themselves that the fault lies with the Bolsheviks,
but they are gradually realizing that the real cause is the reactionary
control of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Meanwhile, various Americans
are interesting themselves in this railway and endeavouring to
get it internationalized. Motives similar to those which led to
the Vanderlip concession are forcing friendship with Russia upon
all Americans who have Siberian interests. If Japan were engaged
in a war with America, the Bolsheviks would in all likelihood
seize the opportunity to liberate Vladivostok and recover Russia's
former position in Manchuria. Already, according to <em>The Times</em>
correspondent in Peking, Outer Mongolia, a country about as large
as England, France and Germany combined, has been conquered by
Bolshevik armies and propaganda.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks have, of course, the enthusiastic sympathy of
the younger Chinese students. If they can weather their present
troubles, they have a good chance of being accepted by all vigorous
progressive people in Asia as the liberators of Asia from the
tyranny of the Great Powers. As they were not invited to Washington,
they are not a party to any of the agreements reached there, and
it may turn out that they will upset impartially the ambitions
of Japan, Great Britain and America.[83] For America, no less
than other Powers, has ambitions, though they are economic rather
than territorial. If America is victorious in the Far East, China
will be Americanized, and though the shell of political freedom
may remain, there will be an economic and cultural bondage beneath
it. Russia is not strong enough to dominate in this way, but may
become strong enough to secure some real freedom for China. This,
however, is as yet no more than a possibility. It is worth remembering,
because everybody chooses to forget it, and because, while Russia
is treated as a pariah, no settlement of the Far East can be stable.
But what part Russia is going to play in the affairs of China
it is as yet impossible to say.</p>

<p><em>FOOTNOTES</em>:</p>

<p>[Footnote 63: On this subject George Gleason, <em>What Shall
I Think of Japan?</em> pp. 174-5, says: "This paragraph concerns
the iron and steel mills at the city of Hanyang, which, with Wuchang
and Hangkow, form the Upper Yangtze commercial centre with a population
of 1,500,000 people. The Hanyeping Company owns a large part of
the Tayeh iron mines, eighty miles east of Hangkow, with which
there are water and rail connections. The ore is 67 per cent.
iron, fills the whole of a series of hills 500 feet high, and
is sufficient to turn out 1,000,000 tons a year for 700 years.
[Probably an overstatement.] Coal for the furnaces is obtained
from Pinghsiang, 200 miles distant by water, where in 1913 five
thousand miners dug 690,000 tons. Japanese have estimated that
the vein is capable of producing yearly a million tons for at
least five centuries....</p>

of Shantung Province, and the South Sea Islands north of the Equator."]</p>

<p>[Footnote 75: The story of the steps leading up to China's declaration
of war is admirably told in Reid, op. cit. pp. 88-109.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 76: Port of the letter is quoted by Dr. Reid, p. 108.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 77: Reid, op. cit. p. 161. Chap. vii. of this book,
"Commercial Rivalries as affecting China," should be read by anyone
who still thinks that the Allies stood for honesty or mercy or
anything except money-grubbing.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 79: A list of these loans is given by Hollington K.
Tong in an article on "China's Finances in 1918" in <em>China
in</em> 1918, published early in 1919 by the Peking leader, pp.
61-2. The list and some of the comments appear also in Putnam
Weale's <em>The Truth about China and Japan</em>.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 80: Mr. Lansing's book, in so far as it deals with
Japanese questions, is severely criticized from a Japanese point
of view in Dr. Y. Soyeda's pamphlet "Shantung Question and Japanese
Case," League of Nations Association of Japan, June 1921. I do
not think Dr. Soyeda's arguments are likely to appeal to anyone
who is not Japanese.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 82: This agitation is well described in Mr. <em>M.T.Z.
</em>Tyau's <em>China Awakened</em> (Macmillan, 1922) chap, ix.,
"The Student Movement."]</p>

<p>[Footnote 83: "Soviet Russia has addressed to the Powers a protest
against the discussion at the Washington Conference of the East
China Railway, a question exclusively affecting China and Russia,
and declares that it reserves for itself full liberty of action
in order to compel due deference to the rights of the Russian
labouring masses and to make demands consistent with those rights"
(<em>Daily Herald</em>, December 22, 1921). This is the new-style
imperialism. It was not the "Russian labouring masses," but the
Chinese coolies, who built the railway. What Russia contributed
was capital, but one is surprised to find the Bolsheviks considering
that this confers rights upon themselves as heirs of the capitalists.]</p>
