<p>Jack Carleton walked across the slight space that separated him
from the arrow, quivering in the log on the opposite side of the
enclosure.  He knew that it had come from the bow of the young
Shawanoe, who displayed his extraordinary skill by sending it
at such an elevation that it passed over the heads of his friends.</p>

<p>"It is a message from Deerfoot," repeated the Kentuckian, as
he drew out the missile and unwrapped the paper wound around it. 
"Let us see what he has to say."</p>

<p>The paper being unfolded, showed the following words in the small
but graceful hand of the Shawanoe:</p>

<p>"Let my brothers listen!  They will hear one gun; they will hear
another, and then will sound a third!  Let them listen closer,
for they are meant for their ears!  Then will come shouts and
the sound of a gun the fourth time!  Let my brothers climb over
the logs and run as fast as they can to the river.  Close by the
ash that lies with its limbs in the water, they will find the
canoe; they must make haste to paddle across or it will be too
late.  They must not wait for Deerfoot.  He will take care of
himself.  Let my brothers listen and be not slow."</p>

<p>"There's no trouble to understand what he means," said Jack,
after reading the words aloud.</p>

<p>"What ish it dot he does?" asked Otto, not quite certain as to
the purpose of their dusky ally.</p>

<p>"He means to start a panic.  He is going to try to scare the
red men so that they will scatter and give us a chance to get
away."</p>

<p>The German lad shook his bead.</p>

<p>"Nix.  He can't do dot."</p>

<p>"It looks to me like a wild scheme, but as it is the last hope,
we must be ready to give all the help we can, for I don't know
of any one who ought to be more interested than we.  Sh!  What
was that?"</p>

<p>Just then it was so still that the slightest noise made by a
falling fragment of a stick reached their ears.  Looking quickly
around they saw that the bit of wood which had been used to close
the orifice between the logs had fallen or had been pushed out
and lay on the ground.  The narrow slit would have shown daylight
through it had it not been closed by altogether a different object
or rather series of objects; for when the astonished boys contemplated
the spot they caught the gleam of two pairs of eyes peering at
them.</p>

<p>The Indians had found the opening and were scrutinizing the interior. 
The glitter of the four orbs which filled the crevice caused most
peculiar sensations on the part of the boys who saw them.</p>

<p>"Ain't you not ashamed mit yourselves!" exclaimed Otto, quickly
bringing his gun to his shoulder and firing directly through the
opening.</p>

<p>"I teaches you mit better manners."</p>

<p>But, quick as he was, the warriors were quicker, and the darkened
slit became light with the noiseless speed of a twinkling sunbeam.
The Indians needed no second intimation of what was coming.</p>

<p>The crisis which followed this shot was more imminent than the
defenders supposed.  The assailants had become convinced that
they were throwing away valuable time, and they assembled in a
group to consider the best means of forcing matters to an issue.</p>

<p>It was at that moment that the report of the gun was heard from
the direction of the river.  Shawanoe and Miami suspended conversation
and, looking inquiringly at each other, listened.</p>

<p>A brief while after, the second shot was heard from another point,
followed by a third from still another direction.</p>

<p>"There are strangers in the woods," remarked one of the warriors,
in a guarded voice.</p>

<p>"Our brothers have come to look for us."</p>

<p>As suddenly as the crash of a thunderbolt, the Shawanoe war-whoop
broke on the air, followed by what seemed to be the shouts of
white men.</p>

<p>Then a voice of mortal terror shouted in the same tongue:</p>

<p>"The white men are coming!  The white men are coming!"</p>

<p>The sound of hurrying feet was heard, as though a dozen warriors
were fleeing in hot haste from a dreaded foe.  The effect intended
by this diversion of Deerfoot promised the brilliant success he
hoped rather than expected.  One of the savages standing close
to the fallen tree, started with an exclamation and dashed off
in an opposite direction from the point whence came the alarming
sounds. The effect was contagious: the others followed pell-mell,
every one plunging forward with the frantic desperation which
the bravest man will show in moments of panic.</p>

<p>It need not be said that Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub listened
to these favorable sounds with breathless interest.  They understood
the stratagem of Deerfoot, and could not feel very hopeful of
its success; but the noise of hastily departing warriors thrilled
them with delight.</p>

<p>"They are running!" exclaimed the young Kentuckian, with beaming
face; "who would have thought it?"</p>

<p>"I dinks it time dot we vasn't doing the same," said Otto, who,
catching the top of the wall with both hands, drew himself upward
and peered over.  He was gratified with the sight of the two hindmost
warriors just vanishing from sight.  The whole party were panic-stricken.</p>

<p>Otto turned his head to tell the joyful news to his companion,
when he saw that he had also drawn himself up beside him.  The
fourth report of a gun was heard.</p>

<p>"Now is your time," said Jack: "over with you; I'll hand you
your gun."</p>

<p>Otto lost no time in scrambling over, and his feet scarcely touched
the ground when his rifle whizzed end over end after him.  It
required all his activity to dodge it, and, while doing so, he
received a sound thump from the gun of his friend, who seemed
to be flinging weapons around with wild recklessness.</p>

<p>One important fact was clear to the boys: the panic of the Indians
was certain to be short-lived.  Before fleeing far, they would
suspect the trick played on them, and would return with tenfold
more fierceness than before.</p>

<p>The hearts of the boys throbbed high with hope when they found
themselves outside the enclosure which had served them as a prison,
and they knew the irrevocable step had been taken; they must now
go forward at all hazards.</p>

<p>The Mississippi was near, and thither they made all haste, remembering
the instructions of Deerfoot as conveyed through the note borne
to them on the wings of the arrow.  Jack, who was the fleeter
of foot, kept slightly in advance, though he had no purpose of
leaving his friend behind.</p>

<p>"Dot ish one good things as nefer vos," Otto took occasion to
say, while panting close behind him: "dere ish not so many of
demi blagued vines dot cotches me all de times ven I vos&mdash;oh mine
gracious!"</p>

<p>As is too often the case, the lad rejoiced too soon, for the
words were yet in his mouth when the very mishap he referred to
overtook him.  A running vine became entangled around his ankles,
and he went forward on his hands and knees; but he was not injured,
and speedily rose again.</p>

<p>In spite of their imminent peril, the young Kentuckian could
not repress a smile when he glanced back and saw Otto picking
himself up; but the smile was gone instantly, for the situation
was anything but a mirthful one.</p>

<p>"Here we are!" called out Jack, halting on the bank of the river
and glancing around him.  "But where is the canoe?"</p>

<p>"I dinks the first things ish to find the ash tree what ish not
laying up but standing down," suggested Otto, moving along the
stream.</p>

<p>It was manifest that the boat could not be found until after
locating the landmark named by the young Shawanoe; for it was
certain Deerfoot had taken care to hide the canoe where some search
would be necessary to find it.</p>

<p>But in specifying the fallen tree, Deerfoot gave no idea of where
it was to be found.  He must have believed it was so conspicuous
that no direction was required.</p>

<p>During the few seconds that the friends stood irresolute, they
used ears as well as eyes.  Suddenly the whoop of an Indian was
heard a brief distance away.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" whispered Jack; "they're coming back!  They have
discovered the trick."</p>

<p>"Dot ish so; let's jump on to de water and swim to de oder side."</p>

<p>The situation was enough to make the bravest nervous, and the
sturdy German could not repress his impatience.  Every second
was of incalculable worth, and yet, knowing they were close to
the means which was to take them to safety, they could not seize
it.</p>

<p>"No; that won't do," replied Jack, resolutely; "they will stand
on the bank and pick us off without trouble to themselves; we
must find the boat."</p>

<p>"But how can't we do dot?"</p>

<p>"You move up the bank and I will hurry down it the canoe cannot
be far off; the instant you catch sight of it, whistle, and I'll
do the same if I see it before you."</p>

<p>Otto sprang away with a more anxious expression on his broad,
honest face than it wore when he was crouching behind the logs,
and the young Kentuckian was scarcely less agitated.  His feelings
were similar to those which come to us in sleep, when we see some
grisly terror approaching and have no power to flee before it. 
Somewhere, almost within reach, was the vehicle to carry them
out of peril, and yet they could not lay their hands on it.</p>

<p>Jack was resolved, in case the canoe was not speedily found,
to do as Otto advised&mdash;leap into the Mississippi and swim boldly
for the other shore.  If they could gain a fair start, they would
have cause to hope; but such an attempt, desperate as it was,
must be undertaken very soon or not at all.</p>

<p>Again the dreaded whoop reached them from the woods, and the
leader started as though he had caught the click of a gun-lock
from behind a tree.</p>

<p>The cry was not a loud one, and was no doubt meant as a signal
to some one not far off.</p>

<p>"I wonder where Deerfoot can be," muttered Jack, pushing his
way hurriedly through the underbrush, and glancing in every direction
for the fallen tree which was to show them the craft.  "He told
us not to wait for him, but it seems to me he ought to have given
us help in finding the boat."</p>

<p>Again, and for the third time, the frightful signal trembled
among the trees close behind him.</p>

<p>"He shan't catch me unprepared, at any rate," muttered the young
Kentuckian, raising the hammer of his gun and looking defiantly
toward the point whence came the cry.</p>

<p>The Indian did not show himself, and conscious that he was throwing
away precious seconds, Jack pushed forward once more, keeping
watch of his flank as well as his front, for a treacherous shot
from the forest would render a canoe altogether useless, so far,
at least, as Master Jack Carleton was concerned.</p>

<p>He was impatient and desperate.  There is often a perverseness
in inanimate things which is beyond endurance.  He had started
with the highest hopes a few minutes before, confident of finding
the Indian canoe without trouble, and now he was baffled and held
back when on the very threshold of safety.</p>

<p>"It is useless to wait," he finally said, coming to an abrupt
halt. "I will call to Otto and we will swim for it."</p>

<p>But, before he could emit the whistle that had been agreed upon,
his ears were set tingling by the identical signal coming from
a point up the bank.</p>

<p>"Thank heaven!" was his exclamation, as he wheeled about and,
forgetful of the other signal that had told him of peril, dashed
along the bank of the stream with furious haste.</p>

<p>"Otto has been more fortunate than I," he added, as he bounded
forward; "he has found the canoe, and I pray that he has not been
too late for us to use it."</p>
