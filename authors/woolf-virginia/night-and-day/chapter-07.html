<p>"And little Augustus Pelham said to me, ‘It’s the younger generation
knocking at the door,’ and I said to him, ‘Oh, but the younger
generation comes in without knocking, Mr. Pelham.’ Such a feeble
little joke, wasn’t it, but down it went into his notebook all
the same."</p>

<p>"Let us congratulate ourselves that we shall be in the grave
before that work is published," said Mr. Hilbery.</p>

<p>The elderly couple were waiting for the dinner-bell to ring and
for their daughter to come into the room. Their arm-chairs were
drawn up on either side of the fire, and each sat in the same
slightly crouched position, looking into the coals, with the expressions
of people who have had their share of experiences and wait, rather
passively, for something to happen. Mr. Hilbery now gave all his
attention to a piece of coal which had fallen out of the grate,
and to selecting a favorable position for it among the lumps that
were burning already. Mrs. Hilbery watched him in silence, and
the smile changed on her lips as if her mind still played with
the events of the afternoon.</p>

<p>When Mr. Hilbery had accomplished his task, he resumed his crouching
position again, and began to toy with the little green stone attached
to his watch-chain. His deep, oval-shaped eyes were fixed upon
the flames, but behind the superficial glaze seemed to brood an
observant and whimsical spirit, which kept the brown of the eye
still unusually vivid. But a look of indolence, the result of
skepticism or of a taste too fastidious to be satisfied by the
prizes and conclusions so easily within his grasp, lent him an
expression almost of melancholy. After sitting thus for a time,
he seemed to reach some point in his thinking which demonstrated
its futility, upon which he sighed and stretched his hand for
a book lying on the table by his side.</p>

<p>Directly the door opened he closed the book, and the eyes of
father and mother both rested on Katharine as she came towards
them. The sight seemed at once to give them a motive which they
had not had before. To them she appeared, as she walked towards
them in her light evening dress, extremely young, and the sight
of her refreshed them, were it only because her youth and ignorance
made their knowledge of the world of some value.</p>

<p>"The only excuse for you, Katharine, is that dinner is still
later than you are," said Mr. Hilbery, putting down his spectacles.</p>

<p>"I don’t mind her being late when the result is so charming,"
said Mrs. Hilbery, looking with pride at her daughter. "Still,
I don’t know that I <em>LIKE </em>your being out so late, Katharine,"
she continued. "You took a cab, I hope?"</p>

<p>Here dinner was announced, and Mr. Hilbery formally led his wife
downstairs on his arm. They were all dressed for dinner, and,
indeed, the prettiness of the dinner-table merited that compliment.
There was no cloth upon the table, and the china made regular
circles of deep blue upon the shining brown wood. In the middle
there was a bowl of tawny red and yellow chrysanthemums, and one
of pure white, so fresh that the narrow petals were curved backwards
into a firm white ball. From the surrounding walls the heads of
three famous Victorian writers surveyed this entertainment, and
slips of paper pasted beneath them testified in the great man’s
own handwriting that he was yours sincerely or affectionately
or for ever. The father and daughter would have been quite content,
apparently, to eat their dinner in silence, or with a few cryptic
remarks expressed in a shorthand which could not be understood
by the servants. But silence depressed Mrs. Hilbery, and far from
minding the presence of maids, she would often address herself
to them, and was never altogether unconscious of their approval
or disapproval of her remarks. In the first place she called them
to witness that the room was darker than usual, and had all the
lights turned on.</p>

<p>"That’s more cheerful," she exclaimed. "D’you know, Katharine,
that ridiculous goose came to tea with me? Oh, how I wanted you!
He tried to make epigrams all the time, and I got so nervous,
expecting them, you know, that I spilt the tea&mdash;and he made an
epigram about that!"</p>

<p>"Which ridiculous goose?" Katharine asked her father.</p>

<p>"Only one of my geese, happily, makes epigrams &mdash;Augustus
Pelham, of course," said Mrs. Hilbery.</p>

<p>"I’m not sorry that I was out," said Katharine.</p>

<p>"Poor Augustus!" Mrs. Hilbery exclaimed. "But we’re all too hard
on him. Remember how devoted he is to his tiresome old mother."</p>

<p>"That’s only because she is his mother. Any one connected with
himself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, Katharine&mdash;that’s too bad. That’s&mdash;what’s the word I
mean, Trevor, something long and Latin&mdash;the sort of word you and
Katharine know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Hilbery suggested "cynical."</p>

<p>"Well, that’ll do. I don’t believe in sending girls to college,
but I should teach them that sort of thing. It makes one feel
so dignified, bringing out these little allusions, and passing
on gracefully to the next topic. But I don’t know what’s come
over me &mdash;I actually had to ask Augustus the name of the
lady Hamlet was in love with, as you were out, Katharine, and
Heaven knows what he mayn’t put down about me in his diary."</p>

<p>"I wish," Katharine started, with great impetuosity, and checked
herself. Her mother always stirred her to feel and think quickly,
and then she remembered that her father was there, listening with
attention.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish?" he asked, as she paused.</p>

<p>He often surprised her, thus, into telling him what she had not
meant to tell him; and then they argued, while Mrs. Hilbery went
on with her own thoughts.</p>

<p>"I wish mother wasn’t famous. I was out at tea, and they would
talk to me about poetry."</p>

<p>"Thinking you must be poetical, I see&mdash;and aren’t you?"</p>

<p>"Who’s been talking to you about poetry, Katharine?" Mrs. Hilbery
demanded, and Katharine was committed to giving her parents an
account of her visit to the Suffrage office.</p>

<p>"They have an office at the top of one of the old houses in Russell
Square. I never saw such queer-looking people. And the man discovered
I was related to the poet, and talked to me about poetry. Even
Mary Datchet seems different in that atmosphere."</p>

<p>"Yes, the office atmosphere is very bad for the soul," said Mr.
Hilbery.</p>

<p>"I don’t remember any offices in Russell Square in the old days,
when Mamma lived there," Mrs. Hilbery mused, "and I can’t fancy
turning one of those noble great rooms into a stuffy little Suffrage
office. Still, if the clerks read poetry there must be something
nice about them."</p>

<p>"No, because they don’t read it as we read it," Katharine insisted.</p>

<p>"But it’s nice to think of them reading your grandfather, and
not filling up those dreadful little forms all day long," Mrs.
Hilbery persisted, her notion of office life being derived from
some chance view of a scene behind the counter at her bank, as
she slipped the sovereigns into her purse.</p>

<p>"At any rate, they haven’t made a convert of Katharine, which
was what I was afraid of," Mr. Hilbery remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh no," said Katharine very decidedly, "I wouldn’t work with
them for anything."</p>

<p>"It’s curious," Mr. Hilbery continued, agreeing with his daughter,
"how the sight of one’s fellow-enthusiasts always chokes one off.
They show up the faults of one’s cause so much more plainly than
one’s antagonists. One can be enthusiastic in one’s study, but
directly one comes into touch with the people who agree with one,
all the glamor goes. So I’ve always found," and he proceeded to
tell them, as he peeled his apple, how he committed himself once,
in his youthful days, to make a speech at a political meeting,
and went there ablaze with enthusiasm for the ideals of his own
side; but while his leaders spoke, he became gradually converted
to the other way of thinking, if thinking it could be called,
and had to feign illness in order to avoid making a fool of himself&mdash;an
experience which had sickened him of public meetings.</p>

<p>Katharine listened and felt as she generally did when her father,
and to some extent her mother, described their feelings, that
she quite understood and agreed with them, but, at the same time,
saw something which they did not see, and always felt some disappointment
when they fell short of her vision, as they always did. The plates
succeeded each other swiftly and noiselessly in front of her,
and the table was decked for dessert, and as the talk murmured
on in familiar grooves, she sat there, rather like a judge, listening
to her parents, who did, indeed, feel it very pleasant when they
made her laugh.</p>

<p>Daily life in a house where there are young and old is full of
curious little ceremonies and pieties, which are discharged quite
punctually, though the meaning of them is obscure, and a mystery
has come to brood over them which lends even a superstitious charm
to their performance. Such was the nightly ceremony of the cigar
and the glass of port, which were placed on the right hand and
on the left hand of Mr. Hilbery, and simultaneously Mrs. Hilbery
and Katharine left the room. All the years they had lived together
they had never seen Mr. Hilbery smoke his cigar or drink his port,
and they would have felt it unseemly if, by chance, they had surprised
him as he sat there. These short, but clearly marked, periods
of separation between the sexes were always used for an intimate
postscript to what had been said at dinner, the sense of being
women together coming out most strongly when the male sex was,
as if by some religious rite, secluded from the female. Katharine
knew by heart the sort of mood that possessed her as she walked
upstairs to the drawing-room, her mother’s arm in hers; and she
could anticipate the pleasure with which, when she had turned
on the lights, they both regarded the drawing-room, fresh swept
and set in order for the last section of the day, with the red
parrots swinging on the chintz curtains, and the arm-chairs warming
in the blaze. Mrs. Hilbery stood over the fire, with one foot
on the fender, and her skirts slightly raised.</p>

<p>"Oh, Katharine," she exclaimed, "how you’ve made me think of
Mamma and the old days in Russell Square! I can see the chandeliers,
and the green silk of the piano, and Mamma sitting in her cashmere
shawl by the window, singing till the little ragamuffin boys outside
stopped to listen. Papa sent me in with a bunch of violets while
he waited round the corner. It must have been a summer evening.
That was before things were hopeless...."</p>

<p>As she spoke an expression of regret, which must have come frequently
to cause the lines which now grew deep round the lips and eyes,
settled on her face. The poet’s marriage had not been a happy
one. He had left his wife, and after some years of a rather reckless
existence, she had died, before her time. This disaster had led
to great irregularities of education, and, indeed, Mrs. Hilbery
might be said to have escaped education altogether. But she had
been her father’s companion at the season when he wrote the finest
of his poems. She had sat on his knee in taverns and other haunts
of drunken poets, and it was for her sake, so people said, that
he had cured himself of his dissipation, and become the irreproachable
literary character that the world knows, whose inspiration had
deserted him. As Mrs. Hilbery grew old she thought more and more
of the past, and this ancient disaster seemed at times almost
to prey upon her mind, as if she could not pass out of life herself
without laying the ghost of her parent’s sorrow to rest.</p>

<p>Katharine wished to comfort her mother, but it was difficult
to do this satisfactorily when the facts themselves were so much
of a legend. The house in Russell Square, for example, with its
noble rooms, and the magnolia-tree in the garden, and the sweet-voiced
piano, and the sound of feet coming down the corridors, and other
properties of size and romance&mdash;had they any existence? Yet why
should Mrs. Alardyce live all alone in this gigantic mansion,
and, if she did not live alone, with whom did she live? For its
own sake, Katharine rather liked this tragic story, and would
have been glad to hear the details of it, and to have been able
to discuss them frankly. But this it became less and less possible
to do, for though Mrs. Hilbery was constantly reverting to the
story, it was always in this tentative and restless fashion, as
though by a touch here and there she could set things straight
which had been crooked these sixty years. Perhaps, indeed, she
no longer knew what the truth was.</p>

<p>"If they’d lived now," she concluded, "I feel it wouldn’t have
happened. People aren’t so set upon tragedy as they were then.
If my father had been able to go round the world, or if she’d
had a rest cure, everything would have come right. But what could
I do? And then they had bad friends, both of them, who made mischief.
Ah, Katharine, when you marry, be quite, quite sure that you love
your husband!"</p>

<p>The tears stood in Mrs. Hilbery’s eyes.</p>

<p>While comforting her, Katharine thought to herself, "Now this
is what Mary Datchet and Mr. Denham don’t understand. This is
the sort of position I’m always getting into. How simple it must
be to live as they do!" for all the evening she had been comparing
her home and her father and mother with the Suffrage office and
the people there.</p>

<p>"But, Katharine," Mrs. Hilbery continued, with one of her sudden
changes of mood, "though, Heaven knows, I don’t want to see you
married, surely if ever a man loved a woman, William loves you.
And it’s a nice, rich-sounding name too &mdash;Katharine Rodney,
which, unfortunately, doesn’t mean that he’s got any money, because
he hasn’t."</p>

<p>The alteration of her name annoyed Katharine, and she observed,
rather sharply, that she didn’t want to marry any one.</p>

<p>"It’s very dull that you can only marry one husband, certainly,"
Mrs. Hilbery reflected. "I always wish that you could marry everybody
who wants to marry you. Perhaps they’ll come to that in time,
but meanwhile I confess that dear William&mdash;" But here Mr. Hilbery
came in, and the more solid part of the evening began. This consisted
in the reading aloud by Katharine from some prose work or other,
while her mother knitted scarves intermittently on a little circular
frame, and her father read the newspaper, not so attentively but
that he could comment humorously now and again upon the fortunes
of the hero and the heroine. The Hilberys subscribed to a library,
which delivered books on Tuesdays and Fridays, and Katharine did
her best to interest her parents in the works of living and highly
respectable authors; but Mrs. Hilbery was perturbed by the very
look of the light, gold-wreathed volumes, and would make little
faces as if she tasted something bitter as the reading went on;
while Mr. Hilbery would treat the moderns with a curious elaborate
banter such as one might apply to the antics of a promising child.
So this evening, after five pages or so of one of these masters,
Mrs. Hilbery protested that it was all too clever and cheap and
nasty for words.</p>

<p>"Please, Katharine, read us something <em>REAL</em>."</p>

<p>Katharine had to go to the bookcase and choose a portly volume
in sleek, yellow calf, which had directly a sedative effect upon
both her parents. But the delivery of the evening post broke in
upon the periods of Henry Fielding, and Katharine found that her
letters needed all her attention.</p>
