<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I remained lying there, bound hand and foot, for a long time;
for quite long enough to allow me to collect my senses and see
that I had been a fool to threaten O'Brien. I had been nobly indignant,
and behold! I had a sack thrown over my head for my pains, and
was put away safely somewhere or other. It seemed to be a cellar.</p>

<p>I was in search of romance, and here were all the elements; Spaniards,
a conspirator, and a kidnapping; but I couldn't feel a fool and
romantic as well. True romance, I suppose, needs a whirl of emotions
to extinguish all the senses except that of sight, which it dims.
Except for sight, which I hadn't at all, I had the use of them
all, and all reported unpleasant things.</p>

<p>I ached and smarted with my head in a sack, with my mouth full
of flour that had gone mouldy and offended my nostrils; I had
a sense of ignominy, and I was extremely angry; I could see that
the old Don was in his dotage&mdash;but Carlos I was bitter against.</p>

<p>I was not really afraid; I could not suppose that the Riegos
would allow me to be murdered or seriously maltreated. But I was
incensed against Fate or Chance or whatever it is&mdash;on account
of the ignominious details, the coarse sack, the mouldy flour,
the stones of the tunnel that had barked my shins, the tightness
of the ropes that bound my ankles together, and seemed to cut
into my wrists behind my back.</p>

<p>I waited, and my fury grew in a dead silence. How would it end&mdash;with
what outrage? I would show my contempt and preserve my dignity
by submitting without a struggle &mdash;I despised this odious
plot. At last there were voices, footsteps; I found it very hard
to carry out my resolution and refrain from stifled cries and
kicks. I was lifted up and carried, like a corpse, with many stumbles,
by men who sometimes growled as they hastened along. From time
to time somebody murmured, "Take care." Then I was deposited into
a boat. The world seemed to be swaying, splashing, jarring&mdash;and
it became obvious to me that I was being taken to some ship. The
Spanish ship, of course. Suddenly I broke into cold perspiration
at the thought that, after all, their purpose might be to drop
me quickly overboard. "Carlos!" I cried. I felt the point of a
knife on my breast. "Silence, Señor!" said a gruff voice.</p>

<p>This fear vanished when we came alongside a ship evidently already
under way; but I was handled so roughly and clumsily that I was
thoroughly exhausted and out of breath, by the time I was got
on board. All was still around me; I was left alone on a settee
in the main cabin, as I imagined. For a long time I made no movement;
then a door opened and shut. There was a murmured conversation
between two voices. This went on in animated whispers for a time.
At last I felt as if someone were trying, rather ineffectually,
to remove the sack itself. Finally, that actually did rub its
way over my head, and something soft and silken began to wipe
my eyes with a surprising care, and even tenderness. "This was
stupidly done," came a discontented remark; "you do not handle
a <em>caballero</em> like this."</p>

<p>"And how else was it to be done, to that kind of <em>caballero?</em>"
was the curt retort.</p>

<p>By that time I had blinked my eyes into a condition for remaining
open for minute stretches. Two men were bending over me &mdash;Carlos
and O'Brien himself. The latter said:</p>

<p>"Believe me, your mistake made this necessary. This young gentleman
was about to become singularly inconvenient, and he is in no way
harmed."</p>

<p>He spoke in a velvety voice, and walked away gently through the
darkness. Carlos followed with the lanthorn dangling at arm's
length; strangely enough he had not even looked at me. I suppose
he was ashamed, and I was too proud to speak to him, with my hands
and feet tied fast. The door closed, and I remained sitting in
the darkness. Long small windows grew into light at one end of
the place, curved into an outline that suggested a deep recess.
The figure of a crowned woman, that moved rigidly up and down,
was silhouetted over my body. Groaning creaks of wood and the
faint swish of water made themselves heard continuously.</p>

<p>I turned my head to a click, I saw a door open a little way,
and the small blue flame of a taper floated into the room. Then
the door closed with a definite sound of shutting in. The light
shone redly through protecting fingers, and upwards on to a small
face. It came to a halt, and I made out the figure of a girl leaning
across a table and looking upwards. There was a click of glass,
and then a great blaze of light created a host of shining things;
a glitter of gilded carvings, red velvet couches, a shining table,
a low ceiling, painted white, on carved rafters. A large silver
lamp she had lighted kept on swinging to the gentle motion of
the ship.</p>

<p>She stood just in front of me; the girl that I had seen through
the door; the girl I had seen play with the melon seeds. She was
breathing fast&mdash;it agitated me to be alone with her&mdash;and she had
a little shining dagger in her hand.</p>

<p>She cut the rope round my ankles, and motioned me imperiously
to turn round. "Your hands&mdash;your hands!"</p>

<p>I turned my back awkwardly to her, and felt the grip of small,
cool, very firm fingers upon my wrists. My arms fell apart, numb
and perfectly useless; I was half aware of pain in them, but it
passed unnoticed among a cloud of other emotions. I didn't feel
my finger-tips because I had the agitation, the flutter, the tantalization
of looking at her.</p>

<p>I was all the while conscious of the&mdash;say, the irregularity of
my position, but I felt very little fear. There were the old Don,
an ineffectual, silver-haired old gentleman, who obviously was
not a pirate; the sleek O'Brien, and Carlos, who seemed to cough
on the edge of a grave&mdash;and this young girl. There was not any
future that I could conceive, and the past seemed to be cut off
from me by a narrow, very dark tunnel through which I could see
nothing at all.</p>

<p>The young girl was, for the moment, what counted most on the
whole, the only thing the eye could rest on. She affected me as
an apparition familiar, yet absolutely new in her charm. I had
seen her gray eyes; I had seen her red lips; her dark hair, her
lithe gestures; the carriage of her head; her throat, her hands.
I knew her; I seemed to have known her for years. A rush of strange,
sweet feeling made me dumb. She was looking at me, her lips set,
her eyes wide and still; and suddenly she said:</p>

<p>"Ask nothing. The land is not far yet. You can escape, Carlos
thought.... But no! You would only perish for nothing. Go with
God." She pointed imperiously towards the square stern-ports of
the cabin.</p>

<p>Following the direction of her hand, my eyes fell upon the image
of a Madonna; rather large&mdash;perhaps a third life-size; with a
gilt crown, a pink serious face bent a little forward over a pink
naked child that perched on her left arm and raised one hand.
It stood on a bracket, against the rudder casing, with fat cherubs'
heads carved on the supports. The young girl crossed herself with
a swift motion of the hand. The stern-ports, glazed in small panes,
were black, and gleaming in a white frame-work.</p>

<p>"Go&mdash;go&mdash;go with God," the girl whispered urgently. "There is
a boat<hr>"</p>

<p>I made a motion to rise; I wanted to go. The idea of having my
liberty, of its being again a possibility, made her seem of less
importance; other things began to have their share. But I could
not stand, though the blood was returning, warm and tingling,
in my legs and hands. She looked at me with a sharp frown puckering
her brows a little; beat a hasty tattoo with one of her feet,
and cast a startled glance towards the forward door that led on
deck. Then she walked to the other side of the table, and sat
looking at me in the glow of the lamp.</p>

<p>"Your life hangs on a thread," she murmured.</p>

<p>I answered, "You have given it to me. Shall I never<hr>?"
I was acutely conscious of the imperfection of my language.</p>

<p>She looked at me sharply; then lowered her lids. Afterwards she
raised them again. "Think of yourself. Every moment is<hr>"</p>

<p>"I will be as quick as I can," I said.</p>

<p>I was chafing my ankles and looking up at her. I wanted, very
badly, to thank her for taking an interest in me, only I found
it very difficult to speak to her. Suddenly she sprang to her
feet:</p>

<p>"That man thinks he can destroy you. I hate him &mdash;I detest
him! You have seen how he treats my father."</p>

<p>It struck me, like a blow, that she was merely avenging O'Brien's
insolence to her father. I had been kidnapped against Don Balthasar
Riego's will. It gave me very well the measure of the old man's
powerlessness in face of his intendant&mdash;who was obviously confident
of afterwards soothing the resentment.</p>

<p>I was glad I had not thanked her for taking an interest in me.
I was distressed, too, because once more I had missed Romance
by an inch.</p>

<p>Someone kicked at the locked door. A voice cried &mdash;I could
not help thinking&mdash;warningly, "Seraphina, Seraphina," and another
voice said with excessive softness, "<em>Senorita! Voyons! quelle
folie</em>."</p>

<p>She sprang at me. Her hand hurt my wrist as she dragged me aft.
I scrambled clumsily into the recess of the counter, and put my
head out. The night air was very chilly and full of brine; a little
boat towing by a long painter was sheering about in the phosphorescent
wake of the ship. The sea itself was pallid in the light of the
moon, invisible to me. A little astern of us, on our port quarter,
a vessel under a press of canvas seemed to stand still; looming
up like an immense pale ghost. She might have been coming up with
us, or else we had just passed her &mdash;I couldn't tell. I had
no time to find out, and I didn't care. The great thing was to
get hold of the painter. The whispers of the girl urged me, but
the thing was not easy; the rope, fastened higher up, streamed
away out of reach of my hand. At last, by watching the moment
when it slacked, and throwing myself half out of the stern window,
I managed to hook it with my finger-tips. Next moment it was nearly
jerked away from me, but I didn't lose it, and the boat taking
a run just then under the counter, I got a good hold. The sound
of another kick at the door made me swing myself out, head first,
without reflection. I got soused to the waist before I had reached
the bows of the boat. With a frantic effort I clambered up and
rolled in. When I got on my legs, the jerky motion of tossing
had ceased, the boat was floating still, and the light of the
stern windows was far away already. The girl had managed to cut
the painter.</p>

<p>The other vessel was heading straight for me, rather high on
the water, broad-beamed, squat, and making her way quietly, like
a shadow. The land might have been four or five miles away &mdash;I
had no means of knowing exactly. It looked like a high black cloud,
and purple-gray mists here and there among the peaks hung like
scarves.</p>

<p>I got an oar over the stern to scull, but I was not fit for much
exertion. I stared at the ship I had left. Her stern windows glimmered
with a slight up-and-down motion; her sails seemed to fall into
black confusion against the blaze of the moon; faint cries came
to me out of her, and by the alteration of her shape I understood
that she was being brought to, preparatory to lowering a boat.
She might have been half a mile distant when the gleam of her
stern windows swung slowly round and went out. I had no mind to
be recaptured, and began to scull frantically towards the other
vessel. By that time she was quite near&mdash;near enough for me to
hear the lazy sound of the water at her bows, and the occasional
flutter of a sail. The land breeze was dying away, and in the
wake of the moon I perceived the boat of my pursuers coming over,
black and distinct; but the other vessel was nearly upon me. I
sheered under her starboard bow and yelled, "Ship ahoy! Ship ahoy!"</p>

<p>There was a lot of noise on board, and no one seemed to hear
my shouts. Several voices yelled. "That cursed Spanish ship ahead
is heaving-to athwart our hawse." The crew and the officers seemed
all to be forward shouting abuse at the "lubberly Dago," and it
looked as though I were abandoned to my fate. The ship forged
ahead in the light air; I failed in my grab at her fore chains,
and my boat slipped astern, bumping against the side. I missed
the main chain, too, and yelled all the time with desperation,
"For God's sake! Ship ahoy! For God's sake throw me a rope, some-,
body, before it's too late!"</p>

<p>I was giving up all hope when a heavy coil&mdash;of a brace, I suppose&mdash;fell
upon my head, nearly knocking me over. Half stunned as I was,
desperation lent me strength to scramble up her side hand over
hand, while the boat floated away from under my feet. I was done
up when I got on the poop. A yell came from forward, "Hard aport."
Then the same voice addressed itself to abusing the Spanish ship
very close to us now. "What do you mean by coming-to right across
my bows like this?" it yelled in a fury.</p>

<p>I stood still in the shadows on the poop. We were drawing slowly
past the stern of the Spaniard, and O'Brien's voice answered in
English:</p>

<p>"We are picking up a boat of ours that's gone adrift with a man.
Have you seen anything of her?" "No&mdash;confound you and your boat."
Of course those forward knew nothing of my being on board. The
man who had thrown me the rope&mdash;a passenger, a certain Major Cowper,
going home with his wife and child&mdash;had walked away proudly, without
deigning as much as to look at me twice, as if to see a man clamber
on board a ship ten miles from the land was the most usual occurrence.
He was, I found afterwards, an absurd, pompous person, as stiff
as a ramrod, and so full of his own importance that he imagined
he had almost demeaned himself by his condescension in throwing
down the rope in answer to my despairing cries. On the other hand,
the helmsman, the only other person aft, was so astounded as to
become quite speechless. I could see, in the light of the binnacle
thrown upon his face, his staring eyes and his open mouth.</p>

<p>The voice forward had subsided by then, and as the stern of the
Spanish ship came abreast of the poop, I stepped out of the shadow
of the sails, and going close to the rail I said, not very loud&mdash;there
was no need to shout&mdash;but very distinctly:</p>

<p>"I am out of your clutches, Mr. O'Brien, after all. I promise
you that you shall hear of me yet."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another man had come up from forward on the poop,
growling like a bear, a short, rotund little man, the captain
of the ship. The Spanish vessel was dropping astern, silent, with
her sails all black, hiding the low moon. Suddenly a hurried hail
came out of her.</p>

<p>"What ship is this?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you, blank your eyes? The <em>Breeze</em>, if
you want to know. What are you going to do about it?" the little
skipper shouted fiercely. In the light wind the ships were separating
slowly.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound to?" hailed O'Brien's voice again.</p>

<p>The little skipper laughed with exasperation. "Dash your blanked
impudence. To Havana, and be hanged to you. Anything more you
want to know? And my name's Lumsden, and I am sixty years old,
and if I had you here, I would put a head on you for getting in
my way, you<hr>"</p>

<p>He stopped, out of breath. Then, addressing himself to his passenger:</p>

<p>"That's the Spanish chartered ship that brought these sanguinary
pirates that were hanged this morning, major. She's taking the
Spanish commissioner back. I suppose they had no man-of-war handy
for the service in Cuba. Did you ever<hr>"</p>

<p>He had caught sight of me for the first time, and positively
jumped a foot high with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Who on earth's that there?"</p>

<p>His astonishment was comprehensible. The major, Without deigning
to enlighten him, walked proudly away. He was too dignified a
person to explain.</p>

<p>It was left to me. Frequenting, as I had been doing, Ramon's
store, which was a great gossiping centre of the maritime world
in Kingston, I knew the faces and the names of most of the merchant
captains who used to gather there to drink and swap yarns. I was
not myself quite unknown to little Lumsden. I told him all my
story, and all the time he kept on scratching his bald head, full
of incredulous perplexity. Old Señor Ramon! Such a respectable
man. And I had been kidnapped? From his store!</p>

<p>"If I didn't see you here in my cuddy before my eyes, I wouldn't
believe a word you say," he declared absurdly.</p>

<p>But he was ready enough to take me to Havana. However, he insisted
upon calling down his mate, a gingery fellow, short, too, but
wizened, and as stupid as himself.</p>

<p>"Here's that Kemp, you know. The young fellow that Macdonald
of the Horton Pen picked up somewhere two years ago. The Spaniards
in that ship kidnapped him&mdash;so he says. He says they are pirates.
But that's a government chartered ship, and all the pirates that
have ever been in her were hanged this morning in Kingston. But
here he is, anyhow. And he says that at home he had throttled
a Bow Street runner before he went off with the smugglers. Did
you ever hear the likes of it, Mercer? I shouldn't think he was
telling us a parcel of lies; hey, Mercer?"</p>

<p>And the two grotesque little chaps stood nodding their heads
at me sagaciously.</p>

<p>"He's a desperate character, then," said Mercer at last, cautiously.
"This morning, the very last thing I heard ashore, as I went to
fetch the fresh beef off, is that he had been assaulting a justice
of the peace on the highroad, and had been trying to knock down
the admiral, who was coming down to town in a chaise with Mr.
Topnambo. There's a warrant out against him under the Black Act,
sir."</p>

<p>Then he brightened up considerably. "So he must have been kidnapped
or something after all, sir, or he would be in chokey now."</p>

<p>It was true, after all. Romance reserved me for another fate,
for another sort of captivity, for more than one sort. And my
imagination had been captured, enslaved already by the image of
that young girl who had called me her English cousin, the girl
with the lizard, the girl with the dagger! And with every word
she uttered romance itself, if I had only known it, the romance
of persecuted lovers, spoke to me through her lips.</p>

<p>That night the Spanish ship had the advantage of us in a freshening
wind, and overtook the <em>Breeze</em>. Before morning dawned
she passed us, and before the close of the next day she was gone
out of sight ahead, steering, apparently, the same course with
ourselves.</p>

<p>Her superior sailing had an enormous influence upon my fortunes;
and I was more adrift in the world than ever before, more in the
dark as to what awaited me than when I was lugged along with my
head in a sack. I gave her but little thought. A sort of numbness
had come over me. I could think of the girl who had cut me free,
and for all my resentment at the indignity of my treatment, I
had hardly a thought to spare for the man who had me bound. I
was pleased to remember that she hated him; that she had said
so herself. For the rest, I had a vague notion of going to the
English Consul in Havana. After all, I was not a complete nobody.
I was John Kemp, a gentleman, well connected; I could prove it.
The Bow Street runner had not been dead as I had thought. The
last letter from Veronica informed me that the man had given up
thief-catching, and was keeping, now, a little inn in the neighbourhood.
Ralph, my brother-in-law, had helped him to it, no doubt. I could
come home safely now.</p>

<p>And I had discovered I was no longer anxious to return home.</p>
