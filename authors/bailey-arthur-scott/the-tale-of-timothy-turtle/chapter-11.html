<p>Timothy Turtle was so angry that he went about snapping at everybody and
everything. And since the whole Beaver family kept carefully out of his
way, he had to content himself with setting his jaws upon roots and
sticks.
</p>
<p>Now, the Beavers' dam was made of sticks and mud. So Timothy found
plenty of chances to bite. And because he could not hurt the sticks, no
matter how much he tried, nobody cared.
</p><p>Really he acted in a most silly, surly fashion.
</p><p>Out of a corner of his eye Brownie Beaver watched Timothy Turtle
closely. Brownie had not forgotten how Timothy seized his mother by the
tail. And while he was helping his elders on the dam, at the same time
he was trying to think of some way to outwit Timothy Turtle.
</p><p>It happened that just at that time the dam needed a great deal of
mending. There were so many holes to be filled that the Beavers worked
all night long. And in spite of all their efforts they saw that even
then a few leaks would have to go unmended. But they did not get
snappish nor lose their tempers. They were not like Timothy Turtle.
Though he slept a great part of the night, and waked up to watch the
workers early in the morning, his temper was worse than ever.
</p><p>He was paddling through the water close to the dam when Brownie Beaver
called to him.
</p><p>"You see that stick??" said Brownie, pointing to a stout piece of box
elder that stuck out of the dam.
</p><p>"I'm not blind," Timothy Turtle snarled back at him.
</p><p>"Well, please don't bite it, anyhow!" Brownie Beaver begged him.
</p><p>That was enough for Timothy Turtle. The mere fact that he thought
somebody didn't want him to do a certain thing was sure to make him do
it. So without saying another word he seized that stick in his powerful
jaws. And bracing his feet against the inner side of the dam, half in
the water and half out, he pulled with all his strength.
</p><p>Now and then he turned his beady eyes toward Brownie Beaver and frowned
at him, as if to say, "Don't give <u>me</u> any orders, young fellow! I shall
do just as I please; and nobody can stop me."
</p><p>Timothy noticed that Brownie went to a number of the other workers and
whispered to them. And when everyone to whom he spoke called to Timothy
and asked him if he wouldn't just as soon let go of that stick and grab
another one, that crusty old codger made up his mind that nobody should
move him from that spot. He took an even firmer hold and tugged as if he
meant to tear the whole dam down.
</p><p>But the Beaver family knew that he couldn't do any damage. And as soon
as it was light enough they all went home to take a nap, leaving Timothy
Turtle to pull away to his heart's content.
