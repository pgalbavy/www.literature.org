<P>
Dr. David Blythe had sent his horse and buggy to meet
them, and the urchin who had brought it slipped away
with a sympathetic grin, leaving them to the delight of
driving alone to their new home through the radiant evening.
<P>
Anne never forgot the loveliness of the view that broke
upon them when they had driven over the hill behind the
village.  Her new home could not yet be seen; but
before her lay Four Winds Harbor like a great, shining
mirror of rose and silver.  Far down, she saw its
entrance between the bar of sand dunes on one side and
a steep, high, grim, red sandstone cliff on the other. 
Beyond the bar the sea, calm and austere, dreamed in
the afterlight.  The little fishing village, nestled in
the cove where the sand-dunes met the harbor shore,
looked like a great opal in the haze.  The sky over
them was like a jewelled cup from which the dusk was
pouring; the air was crisp with the compelling tang of
the sea, and the whole landscape was infused with the
subtleties of a sea evening.  A few dim sails drifted
along the darkening, fir-clad harbor shores.  A bell
was ringing from the tower of a little white church on
the far side; mellowly and dreamily sweet, the chime
floated across the water blent with the moan of the
sea.  The great revolving light on the cliff at the
channel flashed warm and golden against the clear
northern sky, a trembling, quivering star of good hope. 
Far out along the horizon was the crinkled gray ribbon
of a passing steamer's smoke.
<P>
"Oh, beautiful, beautiful," murmured Anne.  "I shall
love Four Winds, Gilbert.  Where is our house?"
<P>
"We can't see it yet--the belt of birch running up
from that little cove hides it.  It's about two miles
from Glen St. Mary, and there's another mile between it
and the light-house.  We won't have many neighbors,
Anne.  There's only one house near us and I don't know
who lives in it.  Shall you be lonely when I'm away?"
<P>
"Not with that light and that loveliness for company. 
Who lives in that house, Gilbert?"
<P>
"I don't know.  It doesn't look--exactly--as if the
occupants would be kindred spirits, Anne, does it?"
<P>
The house was a large, substantial affair, painted such
a vivid green that the landscape seemed quite faded by
contrast.  There was an orchard behind it, and a nicely
kept lawn before it, but, somehow, there was a certain
bareness about it.  Perhaps its neatness was
responsible for this; the whole establishment, house,
barns, orchard, garden, lawn and lane, was so starkly
neat.
<P>
"It doesn't seem probable that anyone with that taste
in paint could be VERY kindred," acknowledged Anne,
"unless it were an accident--like our blue hall.  I
feel certain there are no children there, at least. 
It's even neater than the old Copp place on the Tory
road, and I never expected to see anything neater than
that."
<P>
They had not met anybody on the moist, red road that
wound along the harbor shore.  But just before they
came to the belt of birch which hid their home, Anne
saw a girl who was driving a flock of snow- white
geese along the crest of a velvety green hill on the
right.  Great, scattered firs grew along it.  Between
their trunks one saw glimpses of yellow harvest fields,
gleams of golden sand-hills, and bits of blue sea.  The
girl was tall and wore a dress of pale blue print.  She
walked with a certain springiness of step and erectness
of bearing.  She and her geese came out of the gate at
the foot of the hill as Anne and Gilbert passed.  She
stood with her hand on the fastening of the gate, and
looked steadily at them, with an expression that hardly
attained to interest, but did not descend to curiosity. 
It seemed to Anne, for a fleeting moment, that there
was even a veiled hint of hostility in it.  But it was
the girl's beauty which made Anne give a little gasp--a
beauty so marked that it must have attracted attention
anywhere.  She was hatless, but heavy braids of
burnished hair, the hue of ripe wheat, were twisted
about her head like a coronet; her eyes were blue and
star-like; her figure, in its plain print gown, was
magnificent; and her lips were as crimson as the bunch
of blood-red poppies she wore at her belt.
<P>
"Gilbert, who is the girl we have just passed?" asked
Anne, in a low voice.
<P>
"I didn't notice any girl," said Gilbert, who had eyes
only for his bride.
<P>
"She was standing by that gate--no, don't look back. 
She is still watching us.  I never saw such a beautiful
face."
<P>
"I don't remember seeing any very handsome girls while
I was here.  There are some pretty girls up at the
Glen, but I hardly think they could be called
beautiful."
<P>
"This girl is.  You can't have seen her, or you would
remember her.  Nobody could forget her.  I never saw
such a face except in pictures.  And her hair!  It made
me think of Browning's `cord of gold' and `gorgeous
snake'!"
<P>
"Probably she's some visitor in Four Winds--likely
some one from that big summer hotel over the harbor."
<P>
"She wore a white apron and she was driving geese."
<P>
"She might do that for amusement.  Look, Anne--there's
our house."
<P>
Anne looked and forgot for a time the girl with the
splendid, resentful eyes.  The first glimpse of her new
home was a delight to eye and spirit--it looked so like
a big, creamy seashell stranded on the harbor shore. 
The rows of tall Lombardy poplars down its lane stood
out in stately, purple silhouette against the sky. 
Behind it, sheltering its garden from the too keen
breath of sea winds, was a cloudy fir wood, in which
the winds might make all kinds of weird and haunting
music.  Like all woods, it seemed to be holding and
enfolding secrets in its recesses,--secrets whose charm
is only to be won by entering in and patiently seeking. 
Outwardly, dark green arms keep them inviolate from
curious or indifferent eyes.
<P>
The night winds were beginning their wild dances beyond
the bar and the fishing hamlet across the harbor was
gemmed with lights as Anne and Gilbert drove up the
poplar lane.  The door of the little house opened, and
a warm glow of firelight flickered out into the dusk. 
Gilbert lifted Anne from the buggy and led her into the
garden, through the little gate between the
ruddy-tipped firs, up the trim, red path to the
sandstone step.
<P>
"Welcome home," he whispered, and hand in hand they
stepped over the threshold of their house of dreams.
