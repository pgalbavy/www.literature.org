<p><em>TAKEN </em>aback though he was by the man’s words, Tommy
did not hesitate. If audacity had successfully carried him so
far, it was to be hoped it would carry him yet farther. He quietly
passed into the house and mounted the ramshackle staircase. Everything
in the house was filthy beyond words. The grimy paper, of a pattern
now indistinguishable, hung in loose festoons from the wall. In
every angle was a grey mass of cobweb.</p>

<p>Tommy proceeded leisurely. By the time he reached the bend of
the staircase, he had heard the man below disappear into a back
room. Clearly no suspicion attached to him as yet. To come to
the house and ask for "Mr. Brown" appeared indeed to be a reasonable
and natural proceeding.</p>

<p>At the top of the stairs Tommy halted to consider his next move.
In front of him ran a narrow passage, with doors opening on either
side of it. From the one nearest him on the left came a low murmur
of voices. It was this room which he had been directed to enter.
But what held his glance fascinated was a small recess immediately
on his right, half concealed by a torn velvet curtain. It was
directly opposite the left-handed door and, owing to its angle,
it also commanded a good view of the upper part of the staircase.
As a hiding-place for one or, at a pinch, two men, it was ideal,
being about two feet deep and three feet wide. It attracted Tommy
mightily. He thought things over in his usual slow and steady
way, deciding that the mention of "Mr. Brown" was not a request
for an individual, but in all probability a password used by the
gang. His lucky use of it had gained him admission. So far he
had aroused no suspicion. But he must decide quickly on his next
step.</p>

<p>Suppose he were boldly to enter the room on the left of the passage.
Would the mere fact of his having been admitted to the house be
sufficient? Perhaps a further password would be required, or,
at any rate, some proof of identity. The doorkeeper clearly did
not know all the members of the gang by sight, but it might be
different upstairs. On the whole it seemed to him that luck had
served him very well so far, but that there was such a thing as
trusting it too far. To enter that room was a colossal risk. He
could not hope to sustain his part indefinitely; sooner or later
he was almost bound to betray himself, and then he would have
thrown away a vital chance in mere foolhardiness.</p>

<p>A repetition of the signal knock sounded on the door below, and
Tommy, his mind made up, slipped quickly into the recess, and
cautiously drew the curtain farther across so that it shielded
him completely from sight. There were several rents and slits
in the ancient material which afforded him a good view. He would
watch events, and any time he chose could, after all, join the
assembly, modelling his behaviour on that of the new arrival.</p>

<p>The man who came up the staircase with a furtive, soft-footed
tread was quite unknown to Tommy. He was obviously of the very
dregs of society. The low beetling brows, and the criminal jaw,
the bestiality of the whole countenance were new to the young
man, though he was a type that Scotland Yard would have recognized
at a glance.</p>

<p>The man passed the recess, breathing heavily as he went. He stopped
at the door opposite, and gave a repetition of the signal knock.
A voice inside called out something, and the man opened the door
and passed in, affording Tommy a momentary glimpse of the room
inside. He thought there must be about four or five people seated
round a long table that took up most of the space, but his attention
was caught and held by a tall man with close-cropped hair and
a short, pointed, naval-looking beard, who sat at the head of
the table with papers in front of him. As the new-comer entered
he glanced up, and with a correct, but curiously precise enunciation,
which attracted Tommy’s notice, he asked:</p>

<p>"Your number, comrade?"</p>

<p>"Fourteen, gov’nor," replied the other hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Correct."</p>

<p>The door shut again.</p>

<p>"If that isn’t a Hun, I’m a Dutchman!" said Tommy to himself.
"And running the show darned systematically too&mdash;as they always
do. Lucky I didn’t roll in. I’d have given the wrong number, and
there would have been the deuce to pay. No, this is the place
for me. Hullo, here’s another knock."</p>

<p>This visitor proved to be of an entirely different type to the
last. Tommy recognized in him an Irish Sinn Feiner. Certainly
Mr. Brown’s organization was a far-reaching concern. The common
criminal, the well-bred Irish gentleman, the pale Russian, and
the efficient German master of the ceremonies! Truly a strange
and sinister gathering! Who was this man who held in his finger
these curiously variegated links of an unknown chain?</p>

<p>In this case, the procedure was exactly the same. The signal
knock, the demand for a number, and the reply "Correct."</p>

<p>Two knocks followed in quick succession on the door below. The
first man was quite unknown to Tommy, who put him down as a city
clerk. A quiet, intelligent-looking man, rather shabbily dressed.
The second was of the working classes, and his face was vaguely
familiar to the young man.</p>

<p>Three minutes later came another, a man of commanding appearance,
exquisitely dressed, and evidently well born. His face, again,
was not unknown to the watcher, though he could not for the moment
put a name to it.</p>

<p>After his arrival there was a long wait. In fact Tommy concluded
that the gathering was now complete, and was just cautiously creeping
out from his hiding-place, when another knock sent him scuttling
back to cover.</p>

<p>This last-comer came up the stairs so quietly that he was almost
abreast of Tommy before the young man had realized his presence.</p>

<p>He was a small man, very pale, with a gentle almost womanish
air. The angle of the cheek-bones hinted at his Slavonic ancestry,
otherwise there was nothing to indicate his nationality. As he
passed the recess, he turned his head slowly. The strange light
eyes seemed to burn through the curtain; Tommy could hardly believe
that the man did not know he was there and in spite of himself
he shivered. He was no more fanciful than the majority of young
Englishmen, but he could not rid himself of the impression that
some unusually potent force emanated from the man. The creature
reminded him of a venomous snake.</p>

<p>A moment later his impression was proved correct. The new-comer
knocked on the door as all had done, but his reception was very
different. The bearded man rose to his feet, and all the others
followed suit. The German came forward and shook hands. His heels
clicked together.</p>

<p>"We are honoured," he said. "We are greatly honoured. I much
feared that it would be impossible."</p>

<p>The other answered in a low voice that had a kind of hiss in
it:</p>

<p>"There were difficulties. It will not be possible again, I fear.
But one meeting is essential&mdash;to define my policy. I can do nothing
without &mdash;Mr. Brown. He is here?"</p>

<p>The change in the German’s voice was audible as he replied with
slight hesitation:</p>

<p>"We have received a message. It is impossible for him to be present
in person." He stopped, giving a curious impression of having
left the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>A very slow smile overspread the face of the other. He looked
round at a circle of uneasy faces.</p>

<p>"Ah! I understand. I have read of his methods. He works in the
dark and trusts no one. But, all the same, it is possible that
he is among us now...." He looked round him again, and again that
expression of fear swept over the group. Each man seemed eyeing
his neighbour doubtfully.</p>

<p>The Russian tapped his cheek.</p>

<p>"So be it. Let us proceed."</p>

<p>The German seemed to pull himself together. He indicated the
place he had been occupying at the head of the table. The Russian
demurred, but the other insisted.</p>

<p>"It is the only possible place," he said, "for &mdash;Number
One. Perhaps Number Fourteen will shut the door?"</p>

<p>In another moment Tommy was once more confronting bare wooden
panels, and the voices within had sunk once more to a mere undistinguishable
murmur. Tommy became restive. The conversation he had overheard
had stimulated his curiosity. He felt that, by hook or by crook,
he must hear more.</p>

<p>There was no sound from below, and it did not seem likely that
the doorkeeper would come upstairs. After listening intently for
a minute or two, he put his head round the curtain. The passage
was deserted. Tommy bent down and removed his shoes, then, leaving
them behind the curtain, he walked gingerly out on his stockinged
feet, and kneeling down by the closed door he laid his ear cautiously
to the crack. To his intense annoyance he could distinguish little
more; just a chance word here and there if a voice was raised,
which merely served to whet his curiosity still farther.</p>

<p>He eyed the handle of the door tentatively. Could he turn it
by degrees so gently and imperceptibly that those in the room
would notice nothing? He decided that with great care it could
be done. Very slowly, a fraction of an inch at a time, he moved
it round, holding his breath in his excessive care. A little more&mdash;a
little more still&mdash;would it never be finished? Ah! at last it
would turn no farther.</p>

<p>He stayed so for a minute or two, then drew a deep breath, and
pressed it ever so slightly inward. The door did not budge. Tommy
was annoyed. If he had to use too much force, it would almost
certainly creak. He waited until the voices rose a little, then
he tried again. Still nothing happened. He increased the pressure.
Had the beastly thing stuck? Finally, in desperation, he pushed
with all his might. But the door remained firm, and at last the
truth dawned upon him. It was locked or bolted on the inside.</p>

<p>For a moment or two Tommy’s indignation got the better of him.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m damned!" he said. "What a dirty trick!"</p>

<p>As his indignation cooled, he prepared to face the situation.
Clearly the first thing to be done was to restore the handle to
its original position. If he let it go suddenly, the men inside
would be almost certain to notice it, so, with the same infinite
pains, he reversed his former tactics. All went well, and with
a sigh of relief the young man rose to his feet. There was a certain
bulldog tenacity about Tommy that made him slow to admit defeat.
Checkmated for the moment, he was far from abandoning the conflict.
He still intended to hear what was going on in the locked room.
As one plan had failed, he must hunt about for another.</p>

<p>He looked round him. A little farther along the passage on the
left was a second door. He slipped silently along to it. He listened
for a moment or two, then tried the handle. It yielded, and he
slipped inside.</p>

<p>The room, which was untenanted, was furnished as a bedroom. Like
everything else in the house, the furniture was falling to pieces,
and the dirt was, if anything, more abundant.</p>

<p>But what interested Tommy was the thing he had hoped to find,
a communicating door between the two rooms, up on the left by
the window. Carefully closing the door into the passage behind
him, he stepped across to the other and examined it closely. The
bolt was shot across it. It was very rusty, and had clearly not
been used for some time. By gently wriggling it to and fro, Tommy
managed to draw it back without making too much noise. Then he
repeated his former manœuvres with the handle&mdash;this time with
complete success. The door swung open&mdash;a crack, a mere fraction,
but enough for Tommy to hear what went on. There was a velvet
<em>portière</em> on the inside of this door which prevented him
from seeing, but he was able to recognize the voices with a reasonable
amount of accuracy.</p>

<p>The Sinn Feiner was speaking. His rich Irish voice was unmistakable:</p>

<p>"That’s all very well. But more money is essential. No money&mdash;no
results!"</p>

<p>Another voice which Tommy rather thought was that of Boris replied:</p>

<p>"Will you guarantee that there <em>are</em> results?"</p>

<p>"In a month from now&mdash;sooner or later as you wish &mdash;I will
guarantee you such a reign of terror in Ireland as shall shake
the British Empire to its foundations."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then came the soft, sibilant accents of
Number One:</p>

<p>"Good! You shall have the money. Boris, you will see to that."</p>

<p>Boris asked a question:</p>

<p>"Via the Irish Americans, and Mr. Potter as usual?"</p>

<p>"I guess that’ll be all right!" said a new voice, with a transatlantic
intonation, "though I’d like to point out, here and now, that
things are getting a mite difficult. There’s not the sympathy
there was, and a growing disposition to let the Irish settle their
own affairs without interference from America."</p>

<p>Tommy felt that Boris had shrugged his shoulders as he answered:</p>

<p>"Does that matter, since the money only nominally comes from
the States?"</p>

<p>"The chief difficulty is the landing of the ammunition," said
the Sinn Feiner. "The money is conveyed in easily enough&mdash;thanks
to our colleague here."</p>

<p>Another voice, which Tommy fancied was that of the tall, commanding-looking
man whose face had seemed familiar to him, said:</p>

<p>"Think of the feelings of Belfast if they could hear you!"</p>

<p>"That is settled, then," said the sibilant tones. "Now, in the
matter of the loan to an English newspaper, you have arranged
the details satisfactorily, Boris?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"That is good. An official denial from Moscow will be forthcoming
if necessary."</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then the clear voice of the German broke
the silence:</p>

<p>"I am directed by &mdash;Mr. Brown, to place the summaries of
the reports from the different unions before you. That of the
miners is most satisfactory. We must hold back the railways. There
may be trouble with the <em>A.S.E</em>."</p>

<p>For a long time there was a silence, broken only by the rustle
of papers and an occasional word of explanation from the German.
Then Tommy heard the light tap-tap of fingers, drumming on the
table.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;the date, my friend?" said Number One.</p>

<p>"The 29th."</p>

<p>The Russian seemed to consider:</p>

<p>"That is rather soon."</p>

<p>"I know. But it was settled by the principal Labour leaders,
and we cannot seem to interfere too much. They must believe it
to be entirely their own show."</p>

<p>The Russian laughed softly, as though amused.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he said. "That is true. They must have no inkling
that we are using them for our own ends. They are honest men&mdash;and
that is their value to us. It is curious&mdash;but you cannot make
a revolution without honest men. The instinct of the populace
is infallible." He paused, and then repeated, as though the phrase
pleased him: "Every revolution has had its honest men. They are
soon disposed of afterwards."</p>

<p>There was a sinister note in his voice.</p>

<p>The German resumed:</p>

<p>"Clymes must go. He is too far-seeing. Number Fourteen will see
to that."</p>

<p>There was a hoarse murmur.</p>

<p>"That’s all right, gov’nor." And then after a moment or two:
"Suppose I’m nabbed."</p>

<p>"You will have the best legal talent to defend you," replied
the German quietly. "But in any case you will wear gloves fitted
with the finger-prints of a notorious housebreaker. You have little
to fear."</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain’t afraid, gov’nor. All for the good of the cause.
The streets is going to run with blood, so they say." He spoke
with a grim relish. "Dreams of it, sometimes, I does. And diamonds
and pearls rolling about in the gutter for anyone to pick up!"</p>

<p>Tommy heard a chair shifted. Then Number One spoke:</p>

<p>"Then all is arranged. We are assured of success?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>think so." But the German spoke with less than his
usual confidence.</p>

<p>Number One’s voice held suddenly a dangerous quality:</p>

<p>"What has gone wrong?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; but&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"The Labour leaders. Without them, as you say, we can do nothing.
If they do not declare a general strike on the 29th&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why should they not?"</p>

<p>"As you’ve said, they’re honest. And, in spite of everything
we’ve done to discredit the Government in their eyes, I’m not
sure that they haven’t got a sneaking faith and belief in it."</p>

<p>"But&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know. They abuse it unceasingly. But, on the whole, public
opinion swings to the side of the Government. They will not go
against it."</p>

<p>Again the Russian’s fingers drummed on the table.</p>

<p>"To the point, my friend. I was given to understand that there
was a certain document in existence which assured success."</p>

<p>"That is so. If that document were placed before the leaders,
the result would be immediate. They would publish it broadcast
throughout England, and declare for the revolution without a moment’s
hesitation. The Government would be broken finally and completely."</p>

<p>"Then what more do you want?"</p>

<p>"The document itself," said the German bluntly.</p>

<p>"Ah! It is not in your possession? But you know where it is?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Does anyone know where it is?"</p>

<p>"One person&mdash;perhaps. And we are not sure of that even."</p>

<p>"Who is this person?"</p>

<p>"A girl."</p>

<p>Tommy held his breath.</p>

<p>"A girl?" The Russian’s voice rose contemptuously. "And you have
not made her speak? In Russia we have ways of making a girl talk."</p>

<p>"This case is different," said the German sullenly.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;different?" He paused a moment, then went on: "Where is
the girl now?"</p>

<p>"The girl?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"She is&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Tommy heard no more. A crashing blow descended on his head,
and all was darkness.</p>
