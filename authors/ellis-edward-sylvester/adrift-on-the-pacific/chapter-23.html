<p>Captain Bergen and his mate were not certain that one or more
of the mutineers had not survived the foundering of the schooner
<em>Coral</em>, and had managed to reach the island.</p>

<p>If such were the case, they considered it important that it should
be known as soon as possible, and on the morrow, therefore, they
made careful search, but none of the three men was ever seen again.
A few fragments of spars, floating here and there, were all the
signs that such a craft had ever sailed over the Pacific.</p>

<p>Since the captain and mate were now given the opportunity to
think of their own situation, they did so like men of gravity
and sense. They were safely upon Pearl Island, as they had named
it. They had secured the prize for which they had come so many
thousand miles, and they were, as the world goes, wealthy men.
More than that, they had found a pearl of such marvelous size
and purity that, being dedicated to little Inez Hawthorne, it
was a great fortune indeed to her.</p>

<p>And yet, in one sense, the little party were paupers; that is,
so long as they were held prisoners upon the atoll, for the treasure
of pearls could not purchase them food, clothing, friends, happiness&mdash;nor,
in fact, were they anything more than so many valueless pebbles.
They must reach civilization again to realize anything from the
riches which had come into their possession.</p>

<p>But how were they to leave the island? This was the one great
question which faced them, and which they were called upon to
solve, for now that there was no further cause for staying, the
homesickness of the men increased, and it was not long before
they felt they would give half their wealth for the means of getting
back to Boston.</p>

<p>Since they were absolutely without this means, it was evident
they could do nothing but rely upon Providence to send some vessel
to their relief. It was not impossible that Abe Storms, gifted
as he was with so much wonderful ingenuity, might have attempted
to construct some sort of craft from the palm trees, and it is
quite likely he would have succeeded in making something that
could be utilized. But the awful blotting out of the <em>Coral</em>,
before their eyes, had alarmed both, and made them more timid
than they otherwise would have been.</p>

<p>It was a good many miles to the nearest inhabited island, as
laid down on their chart, and they might succeed in reaching it,
provided they could be assured of a week of good weather. But
there could be no such assurance, and a disturbance meant the
same fate that overtook the mutineers.</p>

<p>It is not at all unlikely, too, that the presence of little Inez
Hawthorne increased this timidity. Had they been without her,
they would not have hesitated to take great risks, but, somehow
or other, her life was inestimably precious in their eyes, and
they would never have forgiven themselves had any ill befallen
her through their dereliction of duty.</p>

<p>"There is a mystery about her life which shall yet be cleared
up," Abe Storms frequently remarked; "and we must not do aught
that shall endanger or delay the solution of the question."</p>

<p>There were comparatively few stores which the schooner had left
them before its final departure, and the survivors were forced
to rely mainly upon what the island afforded. Of course there
were fish in abundance, and they frequently rowed out in the lagoon
in the tender, or small boat, or cast out their lines from shore,
and never failed in a short time to catch all they wanted.</p>

<p>The spring of clear, cool water bubbled and trickled steadily,
and never failed them. And the several species of tropical fruits
about them were used sparingly, the men having the prudence to
seek to prevent the supply giving out.</p>

<p>It was a great relief to Storms and Bergen to find, after the
most thorough exploration they could make, that there were no
poisonous reptiles upon the island.</p>

<p>"We may as well face the situation," said Captain Bergen, after
they had held frequent consultations; "we have been here five
weeks now, and we haven't caught sight of the first sail, with
the exception of our own, which has gone to the bottom, and it
may be that weeks and months more may pass before we shall see
another."</p>

<p>"It is not unlikely that it may be years," added Storms, gravely;
"for, according to the narrative of Grebbens himself, he was here
a long time before he was taken away. The wisest thing we can
do is to prepare ourselves for an indefinite stay."</p>

<p>A long time before, the captain had laboriously climbed the mast
which was erected in the sand by the inlet, and had securely fastened
an old garment to the highest point. There it was still, fluttering
in the wind, when there was enough breeze to raise the irregular
folds, but, alas! it had not brought the friendly sail which they
longed for, and they had been forced at last to look upon an extended
residence upon the island as not only possible, but very probable.</p>

<p>Like philosophers, they governed themselves accordingly. The
signal was kept flying and they busied themselves fishing, talking
or doing odd things which were done simply to pass away time.
But the two felt that a most urgent duty was upon them, respecting
Inez Hawthorne.</p>

<p>"We must do what we can for her," said Storms. "With the material
which I have on hand we can construct garments that will keep
her clad with comeliness, though she may not be in the fashion;
and yet I don't know but what she will," he added, with a smile,
"for we may strike some of the vagaries without knowing it. Then,
too, she must be educated."</p>

<p>"I'm not well up in the line of an education," said the captain,
with some embarrassment, "being as I never attended any other
than a district school, but I believe you graduated, didn't you,
Abe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went through Harvard three years ago, and stood second
in my class. I haven't any fear that I won't be able to teach
her, for she is a child of unusual brightness."</p>

<p>And, as may be supposed, the mate went to work thoroughly in
the instruction of Inez Hawthorne, who proved herself one of the
most apt of pupils, and advanced with a rapidity which delighted
her teacher.</p>
