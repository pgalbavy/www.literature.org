<p>Blair would gladly have chosen another time and place for the
composition of the difficult letter he was called on to write,
but he felt compelled to fulfil his promise at once. The men passed
by him in silence, save the single remark of Brimstone, "Give
my love to your <em>sweet</em> mother," delivered in an insulting
tone, and with a laugh more repulsive than the hiss of a snake.</p>

<p>Blair glanced anxiously in the direction where Derry had disappeared,
almost fearing to see that clenched hand coming forth to do its
threatened work of vengeance. But Derry was already far away,
and Brimstone joined his mess-mates without receiving a word or
sign of rebuke.</p>

<p>Blair took up his pen with a silent prayer that it might be guided
by Him without whose aid vain are the most eloquent words of the
wisest counsellor. His letter was as follows:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"<em>DEAR &#11834; I </em>don't know your name, but your father is my friend, and<br/>
of course I feel interested in you for his sake. He has been very<br/>
kind to me, and it is a great pleasure to me to do any thing for<br/>
him. He has been talking to me of you, and while he has gone on deck<br/>
he wants me to write to you. How he loves you. You are the bright<br/>
spot to him in life, his oasis in the desert of this weary world.<br/>
When he is far out on the wide sea, your face comes up before him,<br/>
and makes the loneliest place a home. He loves to think that you<br/>
pray for him. He feels that he needs your prayers. Happy are the<br/>
fathers who, plunged in earthly cares on sea and land, have children<br/>
to fold their hands and lift their hearts in prayer for them. This<br/>
is all you can do for your absent father. Though you could give him<br/>
crowns and kingdoms, wealth and honor, they would not be worth as<br/>
much as one earnest, faithful, importunate prayer in Jesus' name.<br/>
That name is all-powerful, and <em>must prevail</em>. Your father calls you<br/>
his 'little flower.' He wants his little flower to be pure and<br/>
modest and simple, like the lily, which all may consider and see in<br/>
it the handiwork of God. Only God, who made this beautiful world,<br/>
can purify and cleanse our souls and help us to walk in his holy<br/>
ways. I know that you have been taught all this by the kind friends<br/>
who have watched over you from infancy. Your father wants you to<br/>
give good heed to their counsel, and ever watch and pray and<br/>
struggle against temptation. No blow could fall on him so sore as to<br/>
know his little darling was walking in the wrong path. May you never<br/>
so grieve his fond heart. Again I must tell you, though you have<br/>
read it in his repeated caresses, how your father loves you. May you<br/>
be to him that best of treasures, a prayerful, pious daughter, is<br/>
the sincere wish of

</p>
<p>
"Your father's friend,

</p>
<p>
"<em>BLAIR ROBERTSON</em>."

<p>Blair folded his letter, and then addressing a few lines to his
mother, he inclosed the two in a single envelope, and sought out
Derry for further directions. Derry was pacing up and down the
deck, making the boards ring with his heavy tread.</p>

<p>"Shall I read you what I have written?" said Blair, laying his
hand on Derry's shoulder.</p>

<p>Derry started as if in a dream; but recollecting himself, he
said quickly, "Yes, yes. Here, here in the moonlight. No one will
listen here."</p>

<p>The light of the full moon fell on the open letter, and Blair
read it without difficulty.</p>

<p>"That's it, that's it. Every word of it true," said Derry in
a voice trembling with feeling. "It would kill me to think of
her going wrong. But she wont. Her way is <em>up</em>, and mine
is <em>down, down, down</em>. Give me the letter; I'll put the
right name on it. You don't mind my seeing what goes to your mother.
That's no more than fair. I tell you I don't like folks to know
where my flower hides. I'll see it into the bag, and mind you
don't breathe a word of this. Mind!"</p>

<p>Derry's finger was raised in a threatening attitude as he spoke,
and he stopped after he had moved some steps away to give again
to Blair this sign of silence and secrecy.</p>

<p>Blair lingered on deck, not to enjoy the calm moonlight which
so lovingly crowned and silvered the crests of the waves. His
eyes were lifted upward, but not to gaze on the deep blue of the
moonlit sky. To the great Creator, without whom was not any thing
made that was made, Blair was pouring out the earnest petitions
of his loving heart. For Derry and his little daughter prayed
the young Christian, as they only can pray who believe the blessed
words, "If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."</p>
