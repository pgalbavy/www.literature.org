<p><em>TOM WAS </em>very much shocked at the tragical fate of his
companion. Though he had been an outlaw and a chief of a noted
gang of robbers, it had been his purpose to break away from his
evil life and his companions in crime, and to lead hence-forth
a blameless life.</p>

<p>The chance had been taken from him. His presentiments of evil
had been verified, and he had been summoned without other warning
into the presence of his Maker.</p>

<p>As he sunk upon the deck, he was surrounded by a crowd of passengers.</p>

<p>"Who did this?" exclaimed the captain, naturally turning to Tom
for information.</p>

<p>"I don’t know, sir," said Tom.</p>

<p>"You know this gentleman, I believe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, a little. I made his acquaintance while on the way
to the mines."</p>

<p>"Do you know his name?"</p>

<p>"He called himself Davenport."</p>

<p>"You say, called himself?"</p>

<p>"It was not his real name. He told me he had enemies from whom
he feared injury. Therefore he concealed his real name."</p>

<p>"Do you know his real name?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You think the shot was fired by one of the enemies of whom he
stood in fear?"</p>

<p>"I feel sure of it."</p>

<p>The question arose what disposition to make of the money left
by the murdered man. Eight hundred dollars in gold were found
in his possession, but this question was solved by a paper found
in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>It was to this effect:</p>

<p>"Should anything happen to me, which is quite possible, I desire
that whatever property I leave may be given to my young friend
and fellow-voyager, known as Thomas Temple."</p>

<p>"It seems you are his heir," said the captain, when the examination
was over.</p>

<p>"I?" said Tom, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. Probably the gentleman had few friends and took a fancy
to you. I suppose there need be no formalities, except to give
you the property at once."</p>

<p>This decision of the captain was approved by the passengers,
and Tom found himself unexpectedly rich. But he felt that he could
not consent to retain the money for his own use, except, indeed,
a sum equal to that of which he had been robbed. It was stolen
property, and he could not conscientiously retain it. He resolved
on reaching New York to give it to some charitable association,
where it might be a public benefit.</p>

<p>A new surprise awaited him. Among the passengers was Mr. Stoddard,
the invalid who had been his companion on the voyage out.</p>

<p>He was pleased to find that the old gentleman’s health had been
materially improved by his brief residence in California.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see you again, my young friend," said Mr.
Stoddard. "I sought for you in San Francisco, but was told that
you had gone to the mines. Then I gave up all hopes of seeing
you, but I left directions with my bankers to advance you any
sum which you might require, should you apply to them."</p>

<p>"How have I deserved so much kindness?" said Tom, surprised and
grateful.</p>

<p>"You showed me attention when I required it, Tom. You gave me
hours of your society when the companionship of younger persons
would have been more to your taste. This you did out of the kindness
of your heart, and I shall not soon forget it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Stoddard, you exaggerate my merits," said Tom modestly.</p>

<p>"I don’t think I do. At all events, I have taken a strong liking
to you. I am without near relatives; I am rich and lonely. Will
you give me the right to provide for your future? Will you let
me regard you as my adopted son?"</p>

<p>Tom was surprised at this unexpected offer, and he felt that
it was not to be lightly rejected. But it is due to him to say
that he was urged quite as much by a feeling of sympathy for Mr.
Stoddard’s loneliness as by his own interest to decide in the
affirmative. He felt that he could respect and like him, and with
proper acknowledgments of his kindness he gave his consent.</p>

<p>Mr. Stoddard’s eyes lighted up with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Tom," he said earnestly. "You have given me something
to live for. Now I shall have an interest in life apart from the
care of my health. I will pay your expenses, and make you an allowance
of a thousand dollars a year, if you think that will be sufficient
for the present."</p>

<p>"You overwhelm me with kindness," said Tom. "I don’t know what
to say, except that I hope you will never have cause to repent
your kindness."</p>

<p>"I am sure I never shall," said the old gentleman. "When we reach
the city of New York I will consult you as to your plans in life.
You may be interested to know that I have a house in the city
and a country place on the Hudson. I hope you will like them both,
as each will be your home."</p>

<p>"A place on the Hudson!" exclaimed Tom. "I am sure I shall like
that. Have you any saddle-horses?"</p>

<p>"Two; though I fear they have grown lazy from disuse. You must
give them some exercise."</p>

<p>"Trust me for that," said Tom.</p>

<p>"One thing more. I think you had better call me uncle. The name
will give you a claim upon me in the eyes of the world, and moreover,
I shall be proud of such a spirited young nephew."</p>

<p>"All right, uncle," said Tom, smiling.</p>
