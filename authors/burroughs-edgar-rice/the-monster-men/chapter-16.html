For a week Professor Maxon with von Horn and Sing
sought for Virginia.  They could get no help from
the natives of the long-house, who feared the vengeance
of Muda Saffir should he learn that they had aided
the white men upon his trail.
<P>
And always as the three hunted through the jungle
and up and down the river there lurked ever near
a handful of the men of the tribe of the two whom
von Horn had murdered, waiting for the chance that would
give them revenge and the heads of the three they followed.
They feared the guns of the white men too much to venture
an open attack, and at night the quarry never abated
their watchfulness, so that days dragged on, and still
the three continued their hopeless quest unconscious
of the relentless foe that dogged their footsteps.
<P>
Von Horn was always searching for an opportunity to
enlist the aid of the friendly natives in an effort
to regain the chest, but so far he had found none
who would agree to accompany him even in consideration
of a large share of the booty.  It was the treasure alone
which kept him to the search for Virginia Maxon, and he
made it a point to direct the hunt always in the vicinity
of the spot where it was buried, for a great fear consumed
him that Ninaka might return and claim it before he had a
chance to make away with it.
<P>
Three times during the week they returned and slept
at the long-house, hoping each time to learn that
the natives had received some news of her they sought,
through the wonderful channels of communication that
seemed always open across the trackless jungle and up
and down the savage, lonely rivers.
<P>
For two days Bulan lay raving in the delirium of fever,
while the delicate girl, unused to hardship and exposure,
watched over him and nursed him with the loving tenderness
and care of a young mother with her first born.
<P>
For the most part the young giant's ravings were
inarticulate, but now and then Virginia heard
her name linked with words of reverence and worship.
The man fought again the recent battles he had passed through,
and again suffered the long night watches beside the
sleeping girl who filled his heart.  Then it was that
she learned the truth of his self-sacrificing devotion.
The thing that puzzled her most was the repetition of
a number and a name which ran through all his delirium--
"Nine ninety nine Priscilla."
<P>
She could make neither head nor tail of it, nor was
there another word to give a clue to its meaning,
so at last from constant repetition it became
a commonplace and she gave it no further thought.
<P>
The girl had given up hope that Bulan ever could
recover, so weak and emaciated had he become,
and when the fever finally left him quite suddenly
she was positive that it was the beginning of the end.
It was on the morning of the seventh day since they
had commenced their wandering in search of the long-house
that, as she sat watching him, she saw his eyes resting
upon her face with a look of recognition.
<P>
Gently she took his hand, and at the act he smiled
at her very weakly.
<P>
"You are better, Bulan," she said.  "You have been very sick,
but now you shall soon be well again."
<P>
She did not believe her own words, yet the mere saying
of them gave her renewed hope.
<P>
"Yes," replied the man.  "I shall soon be well again.
How long have I been like this?"
<P>
"For two days," she replied.
<P>
"And you have watched over me alone in the jungle
for two days?" he asked incredulously.
<P>
"Had it been for life," she said in a low voice,
"it would scarce have repaid the debt I owe you."
<P>
For a long time he lay looking up into her eyes--
longingly, wistfully.
<P>
"I wish that it had been for life," he said.
<P>
At first she did not quite realize what he meant,
but presently the tired and hopeless expression of
his eyes brought to her a sudden knowledge of his meaning.
<P>
"Oh, Bulan," she cried, "you must not say that.
Why should you wish to die?"
<P>
"Because I love you, Virginia," he replied.
"And because, when you know what I am,
you will hate and loathe me."
<P>
On the girl's lips was an avowal of her own love,
but as she bent closer to whisper the words in his ear
there came the sound of men crashing through the jungle,
and as she turned to face the peril that she thought approaching,
von Horn sprang into view, while directly behind him came
her father and Sing Lee.
<P>
Bulan saw them at the same instant, and as Virginia ran
forward to greet her father he staggered weakly to his feet.
Von Horn was the first to see the young giant, and with an oath
sprang toward him, drawing his revolver as he came.
<P>
"You beast," he cried.  "We have caught you at last."
<P>
At the words Virginia turned back toward Bulan
with a little scream of warning and of horror.
Professor Maxon was behind her.
<P>
"Shoot the monster, von Horn," he ordered.
"Do not let him escape."
<P>
Bulan drew himself to his full height, and though
he wavered from weakness, yet he towered mighty
and magnificent above the evil faced man who menaced him.
<P>
"Shoot!" he said calmly.  "Death cannot come too soon now."
<P>
At the same instant von Horn pulled the trigger.
The giant's head fell back, he staggered, whirled about,
and crumpled to the earth just as Virginia Maxon's
arms closed about him.
<P>
Von Horn rushed close and pushing the girl aside
pressed the muzzle of his gun to Bulan's temple,
but an avalanche of wrinkled, yellow skin was upon him
before he could pull the trigger a second time, and Sing
had hurled him back a dozen feet and snatched his weapon.
<P>
Moaning and sobbing Virginia threw herself upon
the body of the man she loved, while Professor Maxon
hurried to her side to drag her away from the soulless
thing for whom he had once intended her.
<P>
Like a tigress the girl turned upon the two white men.
<P>
"You are murderers," she cried.  "Cowardly murderers.
Weak and exhausted by fever he could not combat you,
and so you have robbed the world of one of the noblest
men that God ever created."
<P>
"Hush!" cried Professor Maxon.  "Hush, child, you do
not know what you say.  The thing was a monster--
a soulless monster."
<P>
At the words the girl looked up quickly at her father,
a faint realization of his meaning striking her like a
blow in the face.
<P>
"What do you mean?" she whispered.  "Who was he?"
<P>
It was von Horn who answered.
<P>
"No god created that," he said, with a contemptuous
glance at the still body of the man at their feet.
"He was one of the creatures of your father's mad
experiments--the soulless thing for whose arms his
insane obsession doomed you.  The thing at your feet,
Virginia, was Number Thirteen."
<P>
With a piteous little moan the girl turned back toward
the body of the young giant.  A faltering step she took
toward it, and then to the horror of her father
she sank upon her knees beside it and lifting
the man's head in her arms covered the face with kisses.
<P>
"Virginia!" cried the professor.  "Are you mad, child?"
<P>
"I am not mad," she moaned, "not yet.  I love him.
Man or monster, it would have been all the same to me,
for I loved him."
<P>
Her father turned away, burying his face in his hands.
<P>
"God!" he muttered.  "What an awful punishment you
have visited upon me for the sin of the thing I did."
<P>
The silence which followed was broken by Sing who had
kneeled opposite Virginia upon the other side of Bulan,
where he was feeling the giant's wrists and pressing
his ear close above his heart.
<P>
"Do'n cly, Linee," said the kindly old Chinaman.
"Him no dlead."  Then, as he poured a pinch of brownish
powder into the man's mouth from a tiny sack he had
brought forth from the depths of one of his sleeves:
"Him no mlonster either, Linee.  Him white man,
alsame Mlaxon.  Sing know."
<P>
The girl looked up at him in gratitude.
<P>
"He is not dead, Sing?  He will live?" she cried.
"I don't care about anything else, Sing, if you will
only make him live."
<P>
"Him live.  Gettem lilee flesh wounds.  Las all."
<P>
"What do you mean by saying that he is not a monster?"
demanded von Horn.
<P>
"You waitee, you dam flool," cried Sing.  "I tellee
lot more I know.  You waitee I flixee him, and then,
by God, I flixee you."
<P>
Von Horn took a menacing step toward the Chinaman,
his face black with wrath, but Professor Maxon interposed.
<P>
"This has gone quite far enough, Doctor von Horn," he said.
"It may be that we acted hastily.  I do not know, of course,
what Sing means, but I intend to find out.  He has been very
faithful to us, and deserves every consideration."
<P>
Von Horn stepped back, still scowling.  Sing poured
a little water between Bulan's lips, and then asked
Professor Maxon for his brandy flask.  With the first
few drops of the fiery liquid the giant's eyelids moved,
and a moment later he raised them and looked about him.
<P>
The first face he saw was Virginia's.  It was full of
love and compassion.
<P>
"They have not told you yet?" he asked.
<P>
"Yes," she replied.  "They have told me, but it makes
no difference.  You have given me the right to say it,
Bulan, and I do say it now again, before them all--
I love you, and that is all there is that makes
any difference."
<P>
A look of happiness lighted his face momentarily, only
to fade as quickly as it had come.
<P>
"No, Virginia," he said, sadly, "it would not be right.
It would be wicked.  I am not a human being.  I am only
a soulless monster.  You cannot mate with such as I.
You must go away with your father.  Soon you will forget me."
<P>
"Never, Bulan!" cried the girl, determinedly.
<P>
The man was about to attempt to dissuade her, when Sing interrupted.
<P>
"You keepee still, Bulan," he said.  "You wait till Sing tellee.
You no mlonster.  Mlaxon he no makee you.  Sing he find you
in low bloat jus' outsidee cove.  You dummy.  No know nothing.
No know namee.  No know where comee from.  No talkee.
<P>
"Sing he jes' hearee Mlaxon tellee Hornee 'bout Nlumber
Thlirteen.  How he makee him for Linee.  Makee Linee
mally him.  Sing he know what kindee fleaks Mlaxon makee.
Linee always good to old Sing.  Sing he been peeking
thlu clack in wallee.  See blig vlat where Thlirteen growing.
<P>
"Sing he takee you to Sing's shackee that night.
Hide you till evlybody sleep.  Then he sneak you
in workee shop.  Kickee over vlat.  Leaves you.
Nex' mlorning Mlaxon makee blig hulabaloo.
Dance up and downee. Whoop!  Thlirteen clome too soonee,
but allight; him finee, perfec' man.  Whoop!
<P>
"Anyway, you heap better for Linee than one Mlaxon's fleaks,"
he concluded, turning toward Bulan.
<P>
"You are lying, you yellow devil," cried von Horn.
<P>
The Chinaman turned his shrewd, slant eyes malevolently
upon the doctor.
<P>
"Sing lies?" he hissed.  "Mabbeso Sing lies when
he ask what for you glet Bludleen steal tleasure.
But Lajah Saffir he come and spoil it all while you
tly glet Linee to the ship--Sing knows.
<P>
"Then you tellee Mlaxon Thlirteen steal Linee.
You lie then and you knew you lie.  You lie again
when Thlirteen savee Linee flom Oulang Outang--
you say you savee Linee.
<P>
"Then you make bad talkee with Lajah Saffir at long-house.
Sing hear you all timee.  You tly getee tleasure away
from Dlyaks for your self.  Then--"
<P>
"Stop!" roared von Horn.  "Stop!  You lying yellow sneak,
before I put a bullet in you."
<P>
"Both of you may stop now," said Professor Maxon
authoritatively.  "There have been charges made here
that cannot go unnoticed.  Can you prove these things Sing?"
he asked turning to the Chinaman.
<P>
"I plove much by Bludleen's lascar.  Bludleen tell
him all 'bout Hornee.  I plove some more by Dyak chief
at long-house.  He knows lots.  Lajah Saffir tell him.
It all tlue, Mlaxon."
<P>
"And it is true about this man--the thing that you
have told us is true?  He is not one of those created
in the laboratory?"
<P>
"No, Mlaxon.  You no makee fine young man like Blulan--
you know lat, Mlaxon.  You makee One, Two, Thlee--
all up to Twelve.  All fleaks.  You ought to know,
Mlaxon, lat you no can makee a Blulan."
<P>
During these revelations Bulan had sat with his
eyes fixed upon the Chinaman.  There was a puzzled
expression upon his wan, blood-streaked face.
It was as though he were trying to wrest from the inner temple
of his consciousness a vague and tantalizing memory
that eluded him each time that he felt he had it within
his grasp--the key to the strange riddle that hid his origin.
<P>
The girl kneeled close beside him, one small hand in his.
Hope and happiness had supplanted the sorrow in her face.
She tore the hem from her skirt, to bandage the bloody
furrow that creased the man's temple.  Professor Maxon
stood silently by, watching the loving tenderness
that marked each deft, little movement of her strong, brown hands.
<P>
The revelations of the past few minutes had shocked
the old man into stupefied silence.  It was difficult,
almost impossible, for him to believe that Sing
had spoken the truth and that this man was not one of
the creatures of his own creation; yet from the bottom
of his heart he prayed that it might prove the truth,
for he saw that his daughter loved the man with a love
that would be stayed by no obstacle or bound by no man-made law,
or social custom.
<P>
The Chinaman's indictment of von Horn had come as an
added blow to Professor Maxon, but it had brought its
own supporting evidence in the flood of recollections
it had induced in the professor's mind.  Now he recalled
a hundred chance incidents and conversations with his
assistant that pointed squarely toward the man's disloyalty
and villainy.  He wondered that he had been so blind
as not to have suspected his lieutenant long before.
<P>
Virginia had at last succeeded in adjusting her rude
bandage and stopping the flow of blood.  Bulan had
risen weakly to his feet.  The girl supported him upon
one side, and Sing upon the other.  Professor Maxon
approached the little group.
<P>
"I do not know what to make of all that Sing has told us,"
he said.  "If you are not Number Thirteen who are you?
Where did you come from?  It seems very strange indeed--
impossible, in fact.  However, if you will explain who you are,
I shall be glad to--ah--consider--ah--permitting you to pay court
to my daughter."
<P>
"I do not know who I am," replied Bulan.  "I had always
thought that I was only Number Thirteen, until Sing
just spoke.  Now I have a faint recollection
of drifting for days upon the sea in an open boat--
beyond that all is blank.  I shall not force my attentions
upon Virginia until I can prove my identity, and that
my past is one which I can lay before her without shame
--until then I shall not see her."
<P>
"You shall do nothing of the kind," cried the girl.
"You love me, and I you.  My father intended to force
me to marry you while he still thought that you were
a soulless thing.  Now that it is quite apparent
that you are a human being, and a gentleman, he hesitates,
but I do not.  As I have told you before, it makes no
difference to me what you are.  You have told me that
you love me.  You have demonstrated a love that is high,
and noble, and self-sacrificing.  More than that no girl
needs to know.  I am satisfied to be the wife of Bulan--
if Bulan is satisfied to have the daughter of the man
who has so cruelly wronged him."
<P>
An arm went around the girl's shoulders and drew her
close to the man she had glorified with her loyalty
and her love.  The other hand was stretched out toward
Professor Maxon.
<P>
"Professor," said Bulan, "in the face of what Sing has
told us, in the face of a disinterested comparison
between myself and the miserable creatures of your
experiments, is it not folly to suppose that I am one
of them?  Some day I shall recall my past, until that
time shall prove my worthiness I shall not ask for
Virginia's hand, and in this decision she must concur,
for the truth might reveal some insurmountable obstacle
to our marriage.  In the meantime let us be friends,
professor, for we are both actuated by the same desire--
the welfare and happiness of your daughter."
<P>
The old man stepped forward and took Bulan's hand.
The expression of doubt and worry had left his face.
<P>
"I cannot believe," he said, "that you are other than
a gentleman, and if, in my desire to protect Virginia,
I have said aught to wound you I ask your forgiveness."
<P>
Bulan responded only with a tighter pressure of the hand.
<P>
"And now," said the professor, "let us return to the
long-house.  I wish to have a few words in private
with you, von Horn," and he turned to face his assistant,
but the man had disappeared.
<P>
"Where is Doctor von Horn?" exclaimed the scientist,
addressing Sing.
<P>
"Hornee, him vamoose long time 'go," replied
the Chinaman.  "He hear all he likee."
<P>
Slowly the little party wound along the jungle trail,
and in less than a mile, to Virginia's infinite
surprise, came out upon the river and the long-house
that she and Bulan had searched for in vain.
<P>
"And to think," she cried, "that all these awful days
we have been almost within sound of your voices.
What strange freak of fate sent you to us today?"
<P>
"We had about given up hope," replied her father,
"when Sing suggested to me that we cut across the highlands
that separate this valley from the one adjoining it
upon the northeast, where we should strike other tribes
and from them glean some clue to your whereabouts
in case your abductors had attempted to carry you back
to the sea by another route.  This seemed likely in view
of the fact that we were assured by enemies of Muda
Saffir that you were not in his possession, and that
the river we were bound for would lead your captors
most quickly out of the domains of that rascally Malay.
You may imagine our surprise, Virginia, when after
proceeding for but a mile we discovered you."
<P>
No sooner had the party entered the verandah of the
long-house than Professor Maxon made inquiries for von
Horn, only to learn that he had departed up stream
in a prahu with several warriors whom he had engaged
to accompany him on a "hunting expedition," having
explained that the white girl had been found and was
being brought to the long-house.
<P>
The chief further explained that he had done his best
to dissuade the white man from so rash an act, as he
was going directly into the country of the tribe
of the two men he had killed, and there was little chance
that he ever would come out alive.
<P>
While they were still discussing von Horn's act,
and wondering at his intentions, a native on the verandah
cried out in astonishment, pointing down the river.
As they looked in the direction he indicated all saw a
graceful, white cutter gliding around a nearby turn.
At the oars were white clad American sailors,
and in the stern two officers in the uniform
of the United States navy.
