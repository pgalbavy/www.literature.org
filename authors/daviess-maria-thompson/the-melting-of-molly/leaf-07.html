<p>I do believe God gave that wise angel charge concerning me lest I get
dashed, but I just got dashed anyway, and its my own fault, not the
angel's. I have suffered this day until I want to lay my face down
against the hem of His garment and wait in the dust for Him to pick me
up. I shall never be able to do it myself, and how He's going to do it
I can't see, but He will.
</p><p>That dinner-party last night was bad enough, but to-day's been worse.
I didn't sleep until long after daylight and then Judy came in before
eight o'clock with a letter for me that looked like a state document.
I felt in my trembly bones that it was some sort of summons affair from
Judge Wade; and it was. I looked into the first paragraph and then
decided that I had better get up and dress and have a cup of coffee and
a single egg before I tried to read it.
</p><p>Incidental to my bath and dressing, I weighed and found that I had lost
all four of those last surplus pounds and two more in three days. Those
two extra pounds might be construed to prove love, but exactly on whom
I was utterly unprepared to say. I didn't even enjoy the thinness, but
took a kind of already-married look in my glass and tried to slip the
egg past my bored lips and get myself to chew it down. It was work; and
then I took up the judge's letter, which also was work and more of it.
</p><p>He started in at the beginning of everything, that is at the beginning
of the tuberculosis girl and I cried over the pages of her as if she had
been my own sister. At the tenth page we buried her and took up Alfred
and I must say I saw a new Alfred in the judge's bouquet-strewn
appreciation of him, but I didn't want him as bad as I had the day
before when I read his own new and old letters, and cried over his old
photographs. I suppose that was the result of some of what the judge
manages the juries with. He'd be apt to use it on a woman and she
wouldn't find out about it until it was too late to be anything but mad.
Still when he began on me at page sixteen I felt a little better, though
I didn't know myself any better than I did Alfred when I got to page
twenty.
</p><p>What I am, is just a poor foolish woman, who has a lot more heart than
she can manage with the amount of brains she got with it at birth. I'm
not any star in a rose-colored sky, and I don't want to inspire anybody;
it's too much of a job. I want to be a healthy happy woman and a wife to
a man who can inspire himself and manage me. I want to marry a thin man
and have from five to ten thin children, and when I get to be thirty I
want my husband to want me to be as fat as Aunt Bettie, but not let me.
An inspiration couldn't be fat and I'm always in danger from hot muffins
and chicken gravy. However, if I should undertake to be all the things
Judge Wade said in that letter he wanted me to be to him, I should soon
be skin and bones from mental and physical exercise. Still, he does
live in Hillsboro and I won't let myself know how my heart aches at the
thought of leaving my home--and other things. It's up in my throat and
I seem always to be swallowing it, the last few days.
</p><p>All the men who write me letters seem to get themselves wound up into a
skyrocket and then let themselves explode in the last paragraph and it
always upsets my nerves. I was just about to begin to cry again over the
last words of the judge when the only bright spot in the day so far
suddenly happened. Pet Buford blew in with the pinkest cheeks and the
brightest eyes I had seen since I looked in the mirror the night of the
dance. She was in an awful hurry.
</p><p>"Molly, dear," she said, with her words literally falling over
themselves, "Tom says you'll give us some of your dinner left-overs to
take for lunch in the Hup, for we are going way out to Wayne County to
see some awfully fine tobacco he has heard is there. I don't want to ask
mother, for she won't let me go; and his mother, if he asked her, will
begin to talk about us. Tom said come to you and you would understand
and fix it quick. He said kiss you for him and tell you he said 'Come on
in, the water's fine.' Isn't he a joke?" And we kissed and laughed and
packed a basket, and kissed and laughed again for good-by. I felt amused
and happy for a few minutes--and also deserted. It's a very good thing
for a woman's conceit to find out how many of her lovers are just
make-believes. I may have needed Tom's deflection.
</p><p>Anyway, I don't know when I ever was so glad to see anybody as I was
when Mrs. Johnson came in the front door. A woman who has proved to her
own satisfaction that marriage is a failure is at times a great tonic to
other women. I needed a tonic badly this morning and I got it.
</p><p>"Well, from all my long experience, Molly," she said as she seated
herself and began to hem a dish-towel with long steady stabs, "husbands
are just stick candy in different jars. They may look a little
different, but they all taste alike and you soon get tired of them. In
two months you won't know the difference in being married to Al Bennett
and Mr. Carter and you'll have to go on living with him maybe fifty
years. Luck doesn't strike twice in the same place and you can't count
on losing two husbands. Al's father was Mr. Johnson's first cousin and
had more crochets and worse. He had silent spells that lasted a week and
family prayers three times a day, though he got drunk twice a year for a
month at a time. Al looks very much like him."
</p><p>"Mrs. Johnson," I said after a minute's silence, while I had decided
whether or not I had better tell her all about it. If a woman's in love
with her husband you can't trust her to keep a secret, but I decided to
try Mrs. Johnson. "I really am not engaged exactly to Alfred Bennett,
though I suppose he thinks so by now if he has got the answer to that
telegram. But--but something has made me--made me think about Judge
Wade--that is he--what do you think of him, Mrs. Johnson?" I concluded
in the most pitifully perplexed tone of voice.
</p><p>"All alike, Molly; all as much alike as peas in a pod; all except John
Moore, who's the only exception in all the male tribe I ever met! His
marrying once was just accidental and must be forgiven him. She fell in
love with him while he was treating her for typhoid, when his back was
turned as it were, and it was God's own kindness in him that made him
marry her when he found out how it was with the poor thing. There's not
a woman in this town who could marry, that wouldn't marry him at the
drop of his hat--but, thank goodness, that hat will never drop and I'll
have one sensible man to comfort and doctor me down into my old age.
Now, just look at that! Mr. Johnson's come home here in the middle of
the morning and I'll have to get that old paper I hunted out of his desk
for him last night. I wonder how he came to forget it!" It's funny how
Mrs. Johnson always knows what Mr. Johnson wants before he knows himself
and gets it before he asks for it!
</p><p>As she went out the gate the postman came in and at the sight of another
letter my heart again slunk off into my slippers, and my brain seemed
about to back up in a corner and refuse to work. In a flash it came to
me that men oughtn't to write letters to women very much--they really
don't plow deep enough, they just irritate the top soil. I took this
missive from Alfred, counted all the fifteen pages, put it out of sight
under a book, looked out the window and saw the ginger barber coming
dejectedly around to the side gate from the kitchen--I knew the scene he
had had with Judy, about the bottle encounters of the night before--saw
Mr. Johnson shooed off down the street by Mrs. Johnson; saw the doctor's
car go chucking hurriedly in the garage and then my spirit turned itself
to the wall and refused to be comforted. I tried my best, but failed to
respond to my own remonstrances with myself, and tears were slowly
gathering in a cloud of gloom when a blue gingham, rompers-clad sunbeam
burst into the room.
</p><p>"Git your night-gown and your toothbresh quick, Molly, if you want to
pack 'em in my trunk!" he exclaimed with his eyes dancing and a curl
standing straight up on the top of his head, as it has a habit of doing
when he is most excited. "You can't take nothing but them 'cause I'm
going to put in a rope to tie the whale with when I ketch him, and
it'll take up all the rest of the room. Git 'em quick!"
</p><p>"Yes, lover, I'll get them for you, but tell Molly where it is you are
going to sail off with her in that trunk of yours?" I asked, dropping
into the game as I have always done with him, no matter what game of my
own pressed when he called.
</p><p>"On the ocean where the boats go 'cross and run right over a whale.
Don't you remember you showed me them pictures of spout whales in a
book, Molly? Doc says they comes right up by the ship and you can hear
'em shoot water and maybe a iceberg, too. Which do you want to ketch
most, Molly, a iceberg or a whale?" His eager eyes demanded instant
decision on my part of the nature of capture I preferred. My mind
quickly reverted to those two ponderous and intense epistles I had got
within the hour and I lay back in my chair and laughed until I felt
almost merry.
</p><p>"The iceberg, Billy, every time," I said at last. "I just can't manage
whales, especially if they are ardent, which word means hot. I like
<u>icebergs</u>, or I think I should if I could catch one."
</p><p>"I don't believe you could, Molly, but maybe Doc will let you put a rope
and a long hook in his trunk to try with if your clothes go into mine.
His is a heap the biggest anyway and Nurse Tilly said he oughter put my
things in his, but I cried and then he went up-stairs and got out that
little one for me. Come see 'em!"
</p><p>"What do you mean, Billy?" I asked, while a sudden fear shot all over me
like lightning. "You're just playing go-away, aren't you?"
</p><p>"No, I ain't playing, Molly!" he exclaimed excitedly. "Me and you and
Doc is a-going across the ocean for a long, long time away from here.
Doc ast me about it this morning and I told him all right and you could
come with us, if you was good. He said couldn't I go without you if you
was busy and couldn't come and I told him you would put things down and
come if I said so. Won't you, Molly? It won't be no fun without you and
you'd cry all by yourself with me gone." His little face was all drawn
up with anxiety and sympathy at my lonely estate with him out of it and
a cry rose up from my heart with a kind of primitive savagery at what I
felt was coming down upon me.
</p><p>Without waiting to take him with me, or think, or do anything but feel
deadly savage anger, I hurried across the garden and into Doctor Moore's
office, where he was just laying off his gloves and dust coat.
</p><p>"What do you mean, John Moore, by daring, daring to think you can go and
take Billy away from me?" I demanded looking at him with what must have
been such fear and madness in my face that he was startled as he came
close to the table against which I leaned. His face had grown white and
quiet at my attack and he waited to answer for a long horrible minute
that pulled me apart like one of those inquisition machines they used to
torture women with when they didn't know any better modern way to do it.
</p><p>"I didn't know Bill would tell you so soon, Mrs. Molly," he said at last
gently, looking past me out of the window into the garden. "I was coming
over just as soon as I got back from this call to talk with you about
it, even if it did seem to intrude Bill's and my affairs into a day
that--that ought to be all yours to be--be happy in. But Bill, you see,
is no respecter of--of other people's happy days if he wants them in
his."
</p><p>"Billy's happy days are mine and mine are his and he has the heart not
to leave me out even if you would have him!" I exclaimed, a sob
gathering in my heart at the thought that my little lover hadn't even
taken in a situation that would separate him from me across an ocean.
</p><p>"Bill is too young to understand when he is--is being bereaved, Molly,"
he said and still he didn't look at me. "I have been appointed a
delegate to represent the State Medical Association at the Centennial
Congress in London the middle of next month--and somehow I--feel a bit
pulled lately and I thought I would take the little chap and have--have
a <u>wander-jahr.</u> You won't need him now, Mrs. Peaches, and I
couldn't go without him, could I?" The sadness in his voice would have
killed me if I hadn't let it madden me instead.
</p><p>"Won't need Billy any more!" I exclaimed with a rage that made my voice
literally scorch past my lips. "Was there ever a minute in his life that
I haven't needed Billy? How dare you say such a thing to me? You are
cruel, cruel, and I have always known it, cold and cruel like all other
men who don't care how they wring the life blood out of women's hearts
and are willing to use their children to do it with. Even the law
doesn't help us poor helpless creatures and you can take our children
and go with them to the ends of the earth and leave us suffering. I have
gone on and believed that you were not like what the women say all men
are and that you cared whether you hurt people or not, but now I see
that you are just the same and you'll take my baby away if you want
to--and I can do nothing to prevent it--nothing in the wide world--I am
completely and absolutely helpless--you coward, you!"
</p><p>When that awful word, the worst word that a woman can use to a man, left
my lips, a flame shot up into his eyes that I thought would burn me up,
but in a half-second it was extinguished by the strangest thing in the
world--for the situation--a perfect flood of mirth. He sat down in his
chair and shook all over with his head in his hands until I saw tears
creep through his fingers. I had calmed down so suddenly that I was
about to begin to cry in good earnest when he wiped his eyes and said
with a low laugh in his throat:
</p><p>"The case is yours, Molly, settled out of court, and the
'possession-nine-points-of-the-law clause' works in some cases for a
woman against a man. Generally speaking, anyway, the pup belongs to the
man who can whistle him down and you can whistle Bill from me any day.
I'm just his father and what I think or want doesn't matter. You had
better take him and keep him!"
</p><p>"I intend to." I answered haughtily, uncertain as to whether I had
better give in and be agreeable or stay prepared to cry in case there
was further argument. But suddenly a strange diffidence came into his
eyes and he looked away from me as he said in queer hesitating words:
</p><p>"You see, Mrs. Molly, I thought from now on your life wouldn't have
exactly a place for Bill. Have you considered that you have trained him
to demand you all the time and all of you? How would you manage
Bill--and--and other claims?"
</p><p>And if there is a contagious thing in this world it is embarrassment. I
never felt anything worse in all my life than the shame that swept over
me in a great hot wave when that look came into his eyes and made me
realize just exactly what I had been saying to him, about what, and how
I had said it. I stood perfectly still, shook all over like a leaf, and
wondered if I would ever be able to raise my eyes from the ground. A
dizzy nauseated feeling for myself rose up in me against myself and I
was just about to turn on my heels and leave him, I hoped for ever, when
he came over and laid his hand on my shoulder.
</p><p>"Molly," he said in a voice that might have come down from heaven on
dove wings, "you can't for a moment feel or think that I don't realize
and appreciate what you have been to the motherless little chap, and for
life I am yours at command, as he is. I really thought it would be a
relief to you to have him taken away from you for just a little while
right now, and I still think it is best; but not unless you consent. You
shall have him back whenever you are ready for him, and at all times
both he and I are at your service to the whole of our kingdoms. Just
think the matter over, won't you, and decide what you want me to do?"
</p><p>Something in me died for ever, I think, when he spoke to me like that.
He's not like other men and there aren't any other men on earth but him!
All the rest are just bugs or bats or something worse. And I'm not
anything myself. There's no excuse for my living and I wish I wasn't so
healthy and likely to go on doing it. It was all over and there was
nothing left for me to live for, and before I could stop myself I buried
my face in my hands.
</p><p>"Billy asked me to go with him on this awful whale hunt!" I sobbed out
to comfort myself with the thought that somebody did care for me,
regardless of just how I was further embarrassing and complicating
myself in the affairs of the two men I had thought I owned and was now
finding out that I had to give up. I wish I had been looking at him, for
I felt him start, but he said in his big friendly voice that is so
much--and never enough for me.
</p><p>"Well, why not you and Al come along and make it a family party, if that
is what suits Bill, the boss?"
</p><p>If men would just buy good, sharp, kitchen knives and cut out women's
hearts in a businesslike way it would be so much kinder of them.
Why do they prefer to use dull weapons that mash the life out slowly?
Everything is at an end for me to-night and that blow did it. It was a
horrible cruel thing for him to say to me! I know now that I have been
in love with John Moore for longer than my honor lets me admit and that
I'll never love anybody else, and that also I have offered myself to him
served up in every known enticement and have had to be refused at least
twice a day for a year. A widow can't say she didn't understand what she
was doing, even to herself, but--My humiliation is complete and the
only thing that can make me ever hold up my head is to puzzle him by--by
<u>happily</u> marrying Alfred Bennett--and quick!
</p><p>Of course, he must suspect how I feel about him, for two people couldn't
both be so ignorant as not to see such an enormous thing as my love for
him is, and I was the blind one. But he must never, never know that I
ever realized it, for he is so good that it would distress him. I must
just go on in my foolish way with him until I can get away. I'll tell
him I'm sorry I was so indignant to-night and say that I think it will
be fine for him to take my Billy away from me with him. I must smile at
the idea of having my very soul amputated, insist that it is the only
thing to do, and pack up the little soul in a steamer trunk with the
smile. Just smile, that is all! Life demands smiles from a woman even if
she must crush their perfume from her own heart; and she generally has
them ready.
</p><p>Oh, Molly, Molly, is it for this you came into the world, twice to give
yourself without love? What difference does it make that your arms are
strong and white if they can't clasp him to the softness and fragrance
of your breast? Why are your eyes blue pools of love if they are not for
his questioning and what are your rose lips for if they quench not his
thirst?
</p><p>[Illustration: What are your rose lips for]
</p><p>Yes, I know God is very tender with a woman and I think He understands,
so if she crept very close to Him and caught at His sleeve to steady
herself He would be kind to her until she could go on along her own
steep way. Please, God, never let him find out, for it would hurt him to
have hurt me!
