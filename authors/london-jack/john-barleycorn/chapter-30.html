Part of the process of recovering from my long sickness was to
find delight in little things, in things unconnected with books
and problems, in play, in games of tag in the swimming pool, in
flying kites, in fooling with horses, in working out mechanical
puzzles.  As a result, I grew tired of the city.  On the ranch, in
the Valley of the Moon, I found my paradise.  I gave up living in
cities.  All the cities held for me were music, the theatre, and
Turkish baths.
<P>
And all went well with me.  I worked hard, played hard, and was
very happy.  I read more fiction and less fact.  I did not study a
tithe as much as I had studied in the past.  I still took an
interest in the fundamental problems of existence, but it was a
very cautious interest; for I had burned my fingers that time I
clutched at the veils of Truth and wrested them from her.  There
was a bit of lie in this attitude of mine, a bit of hypocrisy; but
the lie and the hypocrisy were those of a man desiring to live.  I
deliberately blinded myself to what I took to be the savage
interpretation of biological fact.  After all, I was merely
forswearing a bad habit, forgoing a bad frame of mind.  And I
repeat, I was very happy.  And I add, that in all my days,
measuring them with cold, considerative judgment, this was, far
and away beyond all other periods, the happiest period of my life.
<P>
But the time was at hand, rhymeless and reasonless so far as I can
see, when I was to begin to pay for my score of years of dallying
with John Barleycorn.  Occasionally guests journeyed to the ranch
and remained a few days.  Some did not drink.  But to those who
did drink, the absence of all alcohol on the ranch was a hardship. 
I could not violate my sense of hospitality by compelling them to
endure this hardship.  I ordered in a stock--for my guests.
<P>
I was never interested enough in cocktails to know how they were
made.  So I got a bar-keeper in Oakland to make them in bulk and
ship them to me.  When I had no guests I didn't drink.  But I
began to notice, when I finished my morning's work, that I was
glad if there were a guest, for then I could drink a cocktail with
him.
<P>
Now I was so clean of alcohol that even a single cocktail was
provocative of pitch.  A single cocktail would glow the mind and
tickle a laugh for the few minutes prior to sitting down to table
and starting the delightful process of eating.  On the other hand,
such was the strength of my stomach, of my alcoholic resistance,
that the single cocktail was only the glimmer of a glow, the
faintest tickle of a laugh.  One day, a friend frankly and
shamelessly suggested a second cocktail.  I drank the second one
with him.  The glow was appreciably longer and warmer, the
laughter deeper and more resonant.  One does not forget such
experiences.  Sometimes I almost think that it was because I was
so very happy that I started on my real drinking.
<P>
I remember one day Charmian and I took a long ride over the
mountains on our horses.  The servants had been dismissed for the
day, and we returned late at night to a jolly chafing-dish supper. 
Oh, it was good to be alive that night while the supper was
preparing, the two of us alone in the kitchen.  I, personally, was
at the top of life.  Such things as the books and ultimate truth
did not exist.  My body was gloriously healthy, and healthily
tired from the long ride.  It had been a splendid day.  The night
was splendid.  I was with the woman who was my mate, picnicking in
gleeful abandon.  I had no troubles.  The bills were all paid, and
a surplus of money was rolling in on me.  The future ever-widened
before me.  And right there, in the kitchen, delicious things
bubbled in the chafing-dish, our laughter bubbled, and my stomach
was keen with a most delicious edge of appetite.
<P>
I felt so good, that somehow, somewhere, in me arose an insatiable
greed to feel better.  I was so happy that I wanted to pitch my
happiness even higher.  And I knew the way.  Ten thousand contacts
with John Barleycorn had taught me.  Several times I wandered out
of the kitchen to the cocktail bottle, and each time I left it
diminished by one man's size cocktail.  The result was splendid. 
I wasn't jingled, I wasn't lighted up; but I was warmed, I glowed,
my happiness was pyramided.  Munificent as life was to me, I added
to that munificence.  It was a great hour--one of my greatest. 
But I paid for it, long afterwards, as you will see.  One does not
forget such experiences, and, in human stupidity, cannot be
brought to realise that there is no immutable law which decrees
that same things shall produce same results.  For they don't, else
would the thousandth pipe of opium be provocative of similar
delights to the first, else would one cocktail, instead of
several, produce an equivalent glow after a year of cocktails.
<P>
One day, just before I ate midday dinner, after my morning's
writing was done, when I had no guest, I took a cocktail by
myself.  Thereafter, when there were no guests, I took this daily
pre-dinner cocktail.  And right there John Barleycorn had me.  I
was beginning to drink regularly.  I was beginning to drink alone. 
And I was beginning to drink, not for hospitality's sake, not for
the sake of the taste, but for the effect of the drink.
<P>
I WANTED that daily pre-dinner cocktail.  And it never crossed my
mind that there was any reason I should not have it.  I paid for
it.  I could pay for a thousand cocktails each day if I wanted. 
And what was a cocktail--one cocktail--to me who on so many
occasions for so many years had drunk inordinate quantities of
stiffer stuff and been unharmed?
<P>
The programme of my ranch life was as follows: Each morning, at
eight-thirty, having been reading or correcting proofs in bed
since four or five, I went to my desk.  Odds and ends of
correspondence and notes occupied me till nine, and at nine sharp,
invariably, I began my writing.  By eleven, sometimes a few
minutes earlier or later, my thousand words were finished. 
Another half-hour at cleaning up my desk, and my day's work was
done, so that at eleven-thirty I got into a hammock under the
trees with my mail-bag and the morning newspaper.  At twelve-
thirty I ate dinner and in the afternoon I swam and rode.
<P>
One morning, at eleven-thirty, before I got into the hammock, I
took a cocktail.  I repeated this on subsequent mornings, of
course, taking another cocktail just before I ate at twelve-
thirty.  Soon I found myself, seated at my desk in the midst of my
thousand words, looking forward to that eleven-thirty cocktail.
<P>
At last, now, I was thoroughly conscious that I desired alcohol. 
But what of it? I wasn't afraid of John Barleycorn.  I had
associated with him too long.  I was wise in the matter of drink. 
I was discreet.  Never again would I drink to excess.  I knew the
dangers and the pitfalls of John Barleycorn, the various ways by
which he had tried to kill me in the past.  But all that was past,
long past.  Never again would I drink myself to stupefaction. 
Never again would I get drunk.  All I wanted, and all I would
take, was just enough to glow and warm me, to kick geniality alive
in me and put laughter in my throat and stir the maggots of
imagination slightly in my brain.  Oh, I was thoroughly master of
myself, and of John Barleycorn.
