<p>"They go to bed early, these politicians," he murmured to himself.</p>

<p>And suddenly a sound smote upon his ears—the sound of a shot.
Anthony spun round quickly. The sound had come from within the
house—he was sure of that. He waited a minute, but everything
was still as death. Finally he went up to one of the long French
windows from where he judged the sound that had startled him had
come. He tried the handle. It was locked. He tried some of the
other windows, listening intently all the while. But the silence
remained unbroken.</p>

<p>In the end he told himself that he must have imagined the sound,
or perhaps mistaken a stray shot coming from a poacher in the
woods. He turned and retraced his steps across the park, vaguely
dissatisfied and uneasy.</p>

<p>He looked back at the house, and whilst he looked a light sprang
up in one of the windows on the first floor. In another minute
it went out again, and the whole place was in darkness once more.</p>
