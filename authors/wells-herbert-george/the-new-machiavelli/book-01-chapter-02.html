I dreamt first of states and cities and political things when I was 
a little boy in knickerbockers.
<P>
When I think of how such things began in my mind, there comes back 
to me the memory of an enormous bleak room with its ceiling going up 
to heaven and its floor covered irregularly with patched and 
defective oilcloth and a dingy mat or so and a "surround" as they 
call it, of dark stained wood.  Here and there against the wall are 
trunks and boxes.  There are cupboards on either side of the 
fireplace and bookshelves with books above them, and on the wall and 
rather tattered is a large yellow-varnished geological map of the 
South of England.  Over the mantel is a huge lump of white coral 
rock and several big fossil bones, and above that hangs the portrait 
of a brainy gentleman, sliced in half and displaying an interior of 
intricate detail and much vigour of coloring.  It is the floor I 
think of chiefly; over the oilcloth of which, assumed to be land, 
spread towns and villages and forts of wooden bricks; there are 
steep square hills (geologically, volumes of Orr's CYCLOPAEDIA OF 
THE SCIENCES) and the cracks and spaces of the floor and the bare 
brown surround were the water channels and open sea of that 
continent of mine.
<P>
I still remember with infinite gratitude the great-uncle to whom I 
owe my bricks.  He must have been one of those rare adults who have 
not forgotten the chagrins and dreams of childhood.  He was a 
prosperous west of England builder; including my father he had three 
nephews, and for each of them he caused a box of bricks to be made 
by an out-of-work carpenter, not the insufficient supply of the 
toyshop, you understand, but a really adequate quantity of bricks 
made out of oak and shaped and smoothed, bricks about five inches by 
two and a half by one, and half-bricks and quarter-bricks to 
correspond.  There were hundreds of them, many hundreds.  I could 
build six towers as high as myself with them, and there seemed quite 
enough for every engineering project I could undertake.  I could 
build whole towns with streets and houses and churches and citadels; 
I could bridge every gap in the oilcloth and make causeways over 
crumpled spaces (which I feigned to be morasses), and on a keel of 
whole bricks it was possible to construct ships to push over the 
high seas to the remotest port in the room.  And a disciplined 
population, that rose at last by sedulous begging on birthdays and 
all convenient occasions to well over two hundred, of lead sailors 
and soldiers, horse, foot and artillery, inhabited this world.
<P>
Justice has never been done to bricks and soldiers by those who 
write about toys.  The praises of the toy theatre have been a common 
theme for essayists, the planning of the scenes, the painting and 
cutting out of the caste, penny plain twopence coloured, the stink 
and glory of the performance and the final conflagration.  I had 
such a theatre once, but I never loved it nor hoped for much from 
it; my bricks and soldiers were my perpetual drama.  I recall an 
incessant variety of interests.  There was the mystery and charm of 
the complicated buildings one could make, with long passages and 
steps and windows through which one peeped into their intricacies, 
and by means of slips of card one could make slanting ways in them, 
and send marbles rolling from top to base and thence out into the 
hold of a waiting ship.  Then there were the fortresses and gun 
emplacements and covered ways in which one's soldiers went.  And 
there was commerce; the shops and markets and store-rooms full of 
nasturtium seed, thrift seed, lupin beans and suchlike provender 
from the garden; such stuff one stored in match-boxes and pill-
boxes, or packed in sacks of old glove fingers tied up with thread 
and sent off by waggons along the great military road to the 
beleaguered fortress on the Indian frontier beyond the worn places 
that were dismal swamps.  And there were battles on the way.
<P>
That great road is still clear in my memory.  I was given, I forget 
by what benefactor, certain particularly fierce red Indians of lead--
I have never seen such soldiers since--and for these my father 
helped me to make tepees of brown paper, and I settled them in a 
hitherto desolate country under the frowning nail-studded cliffs of 
an ancient trunk.  Then I conquered them and garrisoned their land.  
(Alas! they died, no doubt through contact with civilisation--one my 
mother trod on--and their land became a wilderness again and was 
ravaged for a time by a clockwork crocodile of vast proportions.)  
And out towards the coal-scuttle was a region near the impassable 
thickets of the ragged hearthrug where lived certain china Zulus 
brandishing spears, and a mountain country of rudely piled bricks 
concealing the most devious and enchanting caves and several mines 
of gold and silver paper.  Among these rocks a number of survivors 
from a Noah's Ark made a various, dangerous, albeit frequently 
invalid and crippled fauna, and I was wont to increase the 
uncultivated wildness of this region further by trees of privet-
twigs from the garden hedge and box from the garden borders.  By 
these territories went my Imperial Road carrying produce to and fro, 
bridging gaps in the oilcloth, tunnelling through Encyclopaedic 
hills--one tunnel was three volumes long--defended as occasion 
required by camps of paper tents or brick blockhouses, and ending at 
last in a magnificently engineered ascent to a fortress on the 
cliffs commanding the Indian reservation.
<P>
My games upon the floor must have spread over several years and 
developed from small beginnings, incorporating now this suggestion 
and now that.  They stretch, I suppose, from seven to eleven or 
twelve.  I played them intermittently, and they bulk now in the 
retrospect far more significantly than they did at the time.  I 
played them in bursts, and then forgot them for long periods; 
through the spring and summer I was mostly out of doors, and school 
and classes caught me early.  And in the retrospect I see them all 
not only magnified and transfigured, but fore-shortened and confused 
together.  A clockwork railway, I seem to remember, came and went; 
one or two clockwork boats, toy sailing ships that, being keeled, 
would do nothing but lie on their beam ends on the floor; a 
detestable lot of cavalrymen, undersized and gilt all over, given me 
by a maiden aunt, and very much what one might expect from an aunt, 
that I used as Nero used his Christians to ornament my public 
buildings; and I finally melted some into fratricidal bullets, and 
therewith blew the rest to flat splashes of lead by means of a brass 
cannon in the garden.
<P>
I find this empire of the floor much more vivid and detailed in my 
memory now than many of the owners of the skirts and legs and boots 
that went gingerly across its territories.  Occasionally, alas! they 
stooped to scrub, abolishing in one universal destruction the slow 
growth of whole days of civilised development.  I still remember the 
hatred and disgust of these catastrophes.  Like Noah I was given 
warnings.  Did I disregard them, coarse red hands would descend, 
plucking garrisons from fortresses and sailors from ships, jumbling 
them up in their wrong boxes, clumsily so that their rifles and 
swords were broken, sweeping the splendid curves of the Imperial 
Road into heaps of ruins, casting the jungle growth of Zululand into 
the fire.
<P>
Well, Master Dick," the voice of this cosmic calamity would say, 
"you ought to have put them away last night.  No! I can't wait until 
you've sailed them all away in ships.  I got my work to do, and do 
it I will."
<P>
And in no time all my continents and lands were swirling water and 
swiping strokes of house-flannel.
<P>
That was the worst of my giant visitants, but my mother too, dear 
lady, was something of a terror to this microcosm.  She wore spring-
sided boots, a kind of boot now vanished, I believe, from the world, 
with dull bodies and shiny toes, and a silk dress with flounces that 
were very destructive to the more hazardous viaducts of the Imperial 
Road.  She was always, I seem to remember, fetching me; fetching me 
for a meal, fetching me for a walk or, detestable absurdity! 
fetching me for a wash and brush up, and she never seemed to 
understand anything whatever of the political Systems across which 
she came to me.  Also she forbade all toys on Sundays except the 
bricks for church-building and the soldiers for church parade, or a 
Scriptural use of the remains of the Noah's Ark mixed up with a 
wooden Swiss dairy farm.  But she really did not know whether a 
thing was a church or not unless it positively bristled with cannon, 
and many a Sunday afternoon have I played Chicago (with the fear of 
God in my heart) under an infidel pretence that it was a new sort of 
ark rather elaborately done.
<P>
Chicago, I must explain, was based upon my father's description of 
the pig slaughterings in that city and certain pictures I had seen.  
You made your beasts--which were all the ark lot really, 
provisionally conceived as pigs--go up elaborate approaches to a 
central pen, from which they went down a cardboard slide four at a 
time, and dropped most satisfyingly down a brick shaft, and pitter-
litter over some steep steps to where a head slaughterman (ne Noah) 
strung a cotton loop round their legs and sent them by pin hooks 
along a wire to a second slaughterman with a chipped foot (formerly 
Mrs. Noah) who, if I remember rightly, converted them into Army 
sausage by means of a portion of the inside of an old alarum clock.
<P>
My mother did not understand my games, but my father did.  He wore 
bright-coloured socks and carpet slippers when he was indoors--my 
mother disliked boots in the house--and he would sit down on my 
little chair and survey the microcosm on the floor with admirable 
understanding and sympathy.
<P>
It was he gave me most of my toys and, I more than suspect, most of 
my ideas.  "Here's some corrugated iron," he would say, "suitable 
for roofs and fencing," and hand me a lump of that stiff crinkled 
paper that is used for packing medicine bottles.  Or, "Dick, do you 
see the tiger loose near the Imperial Road?--won't do for your 
cattle ranch."  And I would find a bright new lead tiger like a 
special creation at large in the world, and demanding a hunting 
expedition and much elaborate effort to get him safely housed in the 
city menagerie beside the captured dragon crocodile, tamed now, and 
his key lost and the heart and spring gone out of him.
<P>
And to the various irregular reading of my father I owe the 
inestimable blessing of never having a boy's book in my boyhood 
except those of Jules Verne.  But my father used to get books for 
himself and me from the Bromstead Institute, Fenimore Cooper and 
Mayne Reid and illustrated histories; one of the Russo-Turkish war 
and one of Napier's expedition to Abyssinia I read from end to end; 
Stanley and Livingstone, lives of Wellington, Napoleon and 
Garibaldi, and back volumes of PUNCH, from which I derived 
conceptions of foreign and domestic politics it has taken years of 
adult reflection to correct.  And at home permanently we had Wood's 
NATURAL HISTORY, a brand-new illustrated Green's HISTORY OF THE 
ENGLISH PEOPLE, Irving's COMPANIONS OF COLUMBUS, a great number of 
unbound parts of some geographical work, a VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD I 
think it was called, with pictures of foreign places, and Clarke's 
NEW TESTAMENT with a map of Palestine, and a variety of other 
informing books bought at sales.  There was a Sowerby's BOTANY also, 
with thousands of carefully tinted pictures of British plants, and 
one or two other important works in the sitting-room.  I was allowed 
to turn these over and even lie on the floor with them on Sundays 
and other occasions of exceptional cleanliness.
<P>
And in the attic I found one day a very old forgotten map after the 
fashion of a bird's-eye view, representing the Crimea, that 
fascinated me and kept me for hours navigating its waters with a 
pin.
<P>
<P>

<P>
My father was a lank-limbed man in easy shabby tweed clothes and 
with his hands in his trouser pockets.  He was a science teacher, 
taking a number of classes at the Bromstead Institute in Kent under 
the old Science and Art Department, and "visiting" various schools; 
and our resources were eked out by my mother's income of nearly a 
hundred pounds a year, and by his inheritance of a terrace of three 
palatial but structurally unsound stucco houses near Bromstead 
Station.
<P>
They were big clumsy residences in the earliest Victorian style, 
interminably high and with deep damp  basements  and  downstairs  
coal-cellars  and kitchens  that suggested  an architect  
vindictively devoted to the discomfort of the servant class.  If so, 
he had overreached himself and defeated his end, for no servant 
would stay in them unless for exceptional wages or exceptional 
tolerance of inefficiency or exceptional freedom in repartee.  Every 
storey in the house was from twelve to fifteen feet high (which 
would have been cool and pleasant in a hot climate), and the stairs 
went steeply up, to end at last in attics too inaccessible for 
occupation.  The ceilings had vast plaster cornices of classical 
design, fragments of which would sometimes fall unexpectedly, and 
the wall-papers were bold and gigantic in pattern and much 
variegated by damp and ill-mended rents.
<P>
As my father was quite unable to let more than one of these houses 
at a time, and that for the most part to eccentric and undesirable 
tenants, he thought it politic to live in one of the two others, and 
devote the rent he received from the let one, when it was let, to 
the incessant necessary repairing of all three.  He also did some of 
the repairing himself and, smoking a bull-dog pipe the while, which 
my mother would not allow him to do in the house, he cultivated 
vegetables in a sketchy, unpunctual and not always successful manner 
in the unoccupied gardens.  The three houses faced north, and the 
back of the one we occupied was covered by a grape-vine that 
yielded, I remember, small green grapes for pies in the spring, and 
imperfectly ripe black grapes in favourable autumns for the purposes 
of dessert. The grape-vine played an important part in my life, for 
my father broke his neck while he was pruning it, when I was 
thirteen.
<P>
My father was what is called a man of ideas, but they were not 
always good ideas.  My grandfather had been a private schoolmaster 
and one of the founders of the College of Preceptors, and my father 
had assisted him in his school until increasing competition and 
diminishing attendance had made it evident that the days of small 
private schools kept by unqualified persons were numbered.  
Thereupon my father had roused himself and had qualified as a 
science teacher under the Science and Art Department, which in these 
days had charge of the scientific and artistic education of the mass 
of the English population, and had thrown himself into science 
teaching and the earning of government grants therefor with great if 
transitory zeal and success.
<P>
I do not remember anything of my father's earlier and more energetic 
time.  I was the child of my parents' middle years; they married 
when my father was thirty-five and my mother past forty, and I saw 
only the last decadent phase of his educational career.
<P>
The Science and Art Department has vanished altogether from the 
world, and people are forgetting it now with the utmost readiness 
and generosity.  Part of its substance and staff and spirit survive, 
more or less completely digested into the Board of Education.
<P>
The world does move on, even in its government.  It is wonderful how 
many of the clumsy and limited governing bodies of my youth and 
early manhood have given place now to more scientific and efficient 
machinery.  When I was a boy, Bromstead, which is now a borough, was 
ruled by a strange body called a Local Board--it was the Age of 
Boards--and I still remember indistinctly my father rejoicing at the 
breakfast-table over the liberation of London from the corrupt and 
devastating control of a Metropolitan Board of Works.  Then there 
were also School Boards; I was already practically in politics 
before the London School Board was absorbed by the spreading 
tentacles of the London County Council.
<P>
It gives a measure of the newness of our modern ideas of the State 
to remember that the very beginnings of public education lie within 
my father's lifetime, and that many most intelligent and patriotic 
people were shocked beyond measure at the State doing anything of 
the sort.  When he was born, totally illiterate people who could 
neither read a book nor write more than perhaps a clumsy signature, 
were to be found everywhere in England; and great masses of the 
population were getting no instruction at all.  Only a few schools 
flourished upon the patronage of exceptional parents; all over the 
country the old endowed grammar schools were to be found sinking and 
dwindling; many of them had closed altogether.  In the new great 
centres of population multitudes of children were sweated in the 
factories, darkly ignorant and wretched and the under-equipped and 
under-staffed National and British schools, supported by voluntary 
contributions and sectarian rivalries, made an ineffectual fight 
against this festering darkness.  It was a condition of affairs 
clamouring for remedies, but there was an immense amount of 
indifference and prejudice to be overcome before any remedies were 
possible.  Perhaps some day some industrious and lucid historian 
will disentangle all the muddle of impulses and antagonisms, the 
commercialism, utilitarianism, obstinate conservatism, humanitarian 
enthusiasm, out of which our present educational organisation arose.  
I have long since come to believe it necessary that all new social 
institutions should be born in confusion, and that at first they 
should present chiefly crude and ridiculous aspects.  The distrust 
of government in the Victorian days was far too great, and the 
general intelligence far too low, to permit the State to go about 
the new business it was taking up in a businesslike way, to train 
teachers, build and equip schools, endow pedagogic research, and 
provide properly written school-books.  These things it was felt 
MUST be provided by individual and local effort, and since it was 
manifest that it was individual and local effort that were in 
default, it was reluctantly agreed to stimulate them by money 
payments.  The State set up a machinery of examination both in 
Science and Art and for the elementary schools; and payments, known 
technically as grants, were made in accordance with the examination 
results attained, to such schools as Providence might see fit to 
send into the world.  In this way it was felt the Demand would be 
established that would, according to the beliefs of that time, 
inevitably ensure the Supply.  An industry of "Grant earning" was 
created, and this would give education as a necessary by-product.
<P>
In the end this belief was found to need qualification, but Grant-
earning was still in full activity when I was a small boy.  So far 
as the Science and Art Department and my father are concerned, the 
task of examination was entrusted to eminent scientific men, for the 
most part quite unaccustomed to teaching.  You see, if they also 
were teaching similar classes to those they examined, it was feared 
that injustice might be done.  Year after year these eminent persons 
set questions and employed subordinates to read and mark the 
increasing thousands of answers that ensued, and having no doubt the 
national ideal of fairness well developed in their minds, they were 
careful each year to re-read the preceding papers before composing 
the current one, in order to see what it was usual to ask.  As a 
result of this, in the course of a few years the recurrence and 
permutation of questions became almost calculable, and since the 
practical object of the teaching was to teach people not science, 
but how to write answers to these questions, the industry of Grant-
earning assumed a form easily distinguished from any kind of genuine 
education whatever.
<P>
Other remarkable compromises had also to be made with the spirit of 
the age.  The unfortunate conflict between Religion and Science 
prevalent at this time was mitigated, if I remember rightly, by 
making graduates in arts and priests in the established church 
Science Teachers EX OFFICIO, and leaving local and private 
enterprise to provide schools, diagrams, books, material, according 
to the conceptions of efficiency prevalent in the district.  Private 
enterprise made a particularly good thing of the books.  A number of 
competing firms of publishers sprang into existence specialising in 
Science and Art Department work; they set themselves to produce 
text-books that should supply exactly the quantity and quality of 
knowledge necessary for every stage of each of five and twenty 
subjects into which desirable science was divided, and copies and 
models and instructions that should give precisely the method and 
gestures esteemed as proficiency in art.  Every section of each book 
was written in the idiom found to be most satisfactory to the 
examiners, and test questions extracted from papers set in former 
years were appended to every chapter.  By means of these last the 
teacher was able to train his class to the very highest level of 
grant-earning efficiency, and very naturally he cast all other 
methods of exposition aside.  First he posed his pupils with 
questions and then dictated model replies.
<P>
That was my father's method of instruction.  I attended his classes 
as an elementary grant-earner from the age of ten until his death, 
and it is so I remember him, sitting on the edge of a table, 
smothering a yawn occasionally and giving out the infallible 
formulae to the industriously scribbling class sitting in rows of 
desks before him.  Occasionally be would slide to his feet and go to 
a blackboard on an easel and draw on that very slowly and 
deliberately in coloured chalks a diagram for the class to copy in 
coloured pencils, and sometimes he would display a specimen or 
arrange an experiment for them to see.  The room in the Institute in 
which he taught was equipped with a certain amount of apparatus 
prescribed as necessary for subject this and subject that by the 
Science and Art Department, and this my father would supplement with 
maps and diagrams and drawings of his own.
<P>
But he never really did experiments, except that in the class in 
systematic botany he sometimes made us tease common flowers to 
pieces.  He did not do experiments if he could possibly help it, 
because in the first place they used up time and gas for the Bunsen 
burner and good material in a ruinous fashion, and in the second 
they were, in his rather careless and sketchy hands, apt to endanger 
the apparatus of the Institute and even the lives of his students.  
Then thirdly, real experiments involved washing up.  And moreover 
they always turned out wrong, and sometimes misled the too observant 
learner very seriously and opened demoralising controversies.  Quite 
early in life I acquired an almost ineradicable sense of the 
unscientific perversity of Nature and the impassable gulf that is 
fixed between systematic science and elusive fact.  I knew, for 
example, that in science, whether it be subject XII., Organic 
Chemistry, or subject XVII., Animal Physiology, when you blow into a 
glass of lime water it instantly becomes cloudy, and if you continue 
to blow it clears again, whereas in truth you may blow into the 
stuff from the lime-water bottle until you are crimson in the face 
and painful under the ears, and it never becomes cloudy at all.  And 
I knew, too, that in science if you put potassium chlorate into a 
retort and heat it over a Bunsen burner, oxygen is disengaged and 
may be collected over water, whereas in real life if you do anything 
of the sort the vessel cracks with a loud report, the potassium 
chlorate descends sizzling upon the flame, the experimenter says 
"Oh! Damn!" with astonishing heartiness and distinctness, and a lady 
student in the back seats gets up and leaves the room.
<P>
Science is the organised conquest of Nature, and I can quite 
understand that ancient libertine refusing to cooperate in her own 
undoing.  And I can quite understand, too, my father's preference 
for what he called an illustrative experiment, which was simply an 
arrangement of the apparatus in front of the class with nothing 
whatever by way of material, and the Bunsen burner clean and cool, 
and then a slow luminous description of just what you did put in it 
when you were so ill-advised as to carry the affair beyond 
illustration, and just exactly what ought anyhow to happen when you 
did.  He had considerable powers of vivid expression, so that in 
this way he could make us see all he described.  The class, freed 
from any unpleasant nervous tension, could draw this still life 
without flinching, and if any part was too difficult to draw, then 
my father would produce a simplified version on the blackboard to be 
copied instead.  And he would also write on the blackboard any 
exceptionally difficult but grant-earning words, such as 
"empyreumatic" or "botryoidal."
<P>
Some words in constant use he rarely explained.  I remember once 
sticking up my hand and asking him in the full flow of description, 
"Please, sir, what is flocculent?"
<P>
"The precipitate is."
<P>
"Yes, sir, but what does it mean?"
<P>
"Oh! flocculent! " said my father, "flocculent!  Why--" he extended 
his hand and arm and twiddled his fingers for a second in the air.  
"Like that," he said.
<P>
I thought the explanation sufficient, but he paused for a moment 
after giving it.  "As in a flock bed, you know," he added and 
resumed his discourse.
<P>
<P>

<P>
My father, I am afraid, carried a natural incompetence in practical 
affairs to an exceptionally high level.  He combined practical 
incompetence, practical enterprise and a thoroughly sanguine 
temperament, in a manner that I have never seen paralleled in any 
human being.  He was always trying to do new things in the briskest 
manner, under the suggestion of books or papers or his own 
spontaneous imagination, and as he had never been trained to do 
anything whatever in his life properly, his futilities were 
extensive and thorough.  At one time he nearly gave up his classes 
for intensive culture, so enamoured was he of its possibilities; the 
peculiar pungency of the manure he got, in pursuit of a chemical 
theory of his own, has scarred my olfactory memories for a lifetime.  
The intensive culture phase is very clear in my memory; it came near 
the end of his career and when I was between eleven and twelve.  I 
was mobilised to gather caterpillars on several occasions, and 
assisted in nocturnal raids upon the slugs by lantern-light that 
wrecked my preparation work for school next day.  My father dug up 
both lawns, and trenched and manured in spasms of immense vigour 
alternating with periods of paralysing distaste for the garden.  And 
for weeks he talked about eight hundred pounds an acre at every 
meal.
<P>
A garden, even when it is not exasperated by intensive methods, is a 
thing as exacting as a baby, its moods have to he watched; it does 
not wait upon the cultivator's convenience, but has times of its 
own.  Intensive culture greatly increases this disposition to 
trouble mankind; it makes a garden touchy and hysterical, a drugged 
and demoralised and over-irritated garden.  My father got at cross 
purposes with our two patches at an early stage.  Everything grew 
wrong from the first to last, and if my father's manures intensified 
nothing else, they certainly intensified the Primordial Curse.  The 
peas were eaten in the night before they were three inches high, the 
beans bore nothing but blight, the only apparent result of a 
spraying of the potatoes was to develop a PENCHANT in the cat for 
being ill indoors, the cucumber frames were damaged by the 
catapulting of boys going down the lane at the back, and all your 
cucumbers were mysteriously embittered.  That lane with its 
occasional passers-by did much to wreck the intensive scheme, 
because my father always stopped work and went indoors if any one 
watched him.  His special manure was apt to arouse a troublesome 
spirit of inquiry in hardy natures.
<P>
In digging his rows and shaping his patches he neglected the guiding 
string and trusted to his eye altogether too much, and the 
consequent obliquity and the various wind-breaks and scare-crows he 
erected, and particularly an irrigation contrivance he began and 
never finished by which everything was to be watered at once by 
means of pieces of gutter from the roof and outhouses of Number 2, 
and a large and particularly obstinate clump of elder-bushes in the 
abolished hedge that he had failed to destroy entirely either by axe 
or by fire, combined to give the gardens under intensive culture a 
singularly desolate and disorderly appearance.  He took steps 
towards the diversion of our house drain under the influence of the 
Sewage Utilisation Society; but happily he stopped in time.  He 
hardly completed any of the operations he began; something else 
became more urgent or simply he tired; a considerable area of the 
Number 2 territory was never even dug up.
<P>
In the end the affair irritated him beyond endurance.  Never was a 
man less horticulturally-minded.  The clamour of these vegetables he 
had launched into the world for his service and assistance, wore out 
his patience.  He would walk into the garden the happiest of men 
after a day or so of disregard, talking to me of history perhaps or 
social organisation, or summarising some book he had read.  He 
talked to me of anything that interested him, regardless of my 
limitations.  Then he would begin to note the growth of the weeds.  
"This won't do," he would say and pull up a handful.
<P>
More weeding would follow and the talk would become fragmentary.  
His hands would become earthy, his nails black, weeds would snap off 
in his careless grip, leaving the roots behind.  The world would 
darken.  He would look at his fingers with disgusted astonishment.  
"CURSE these weeds!" he would say from his heart.  His discourse was 
at an end.
<P>
I have memories, too, of his sudden unexpected charges into the 
tranquillity of the house, his hands and clothes intensively 
enriched.  He would come in like a whirlwind.  "This damned stuff 
all over me and the Agricultural Chemistry Class at six!  Bah!  
AAAAAAH!"
<P>
My mother would never learn not to attempt to break him of swearing 
on such occasions.  She would remain standing a little stiffly in 
the scullery refusing to assist him to the adjectival towel he 
sought.
<P>
"If you say such things--"
<P>
He would dance with rage and hurl the soap about.  "The towel!" he 
would cry, flicking suds from big fingers in every direction; "the 
towel! I'll let the blithering class slide if you don't give me the 
towel!  I'll give up everything, I tell you--everything!" . . .
<P>
At last with the failure of the lettuces came the breaking point.  I 
was in the little arbour learning Latin irregular verbs when it 
happened.  I can see him still, his peculiar tenor voice still 
echoes in my brain, shouting his opinion of intensive culture for 
all the world to hear, and slashing away at that abominable mockery 
of a crop with a hoe.  We had tied them up with bast only a week or 
so before, and now half were rotten and half had shot up into tall 
slender growths.  He had the hoe in both hands and slogged.  Great 
wipes he made, and at each stroke he said, "Take that!"
<P>
The air was thick with flying fragments of abortive salad.  It was a 
fantastic massacre.  It was the French Revolution of that cold 
tyranny, the vindictive overthrow of the pampered vegetable 
aristocrats.  After he had assuaged his passion upon them, he turned 
for other prey; he kicked holes in two of our noblest marrows, 
flicked off the heads of half a row of artichokes, and shied the hoe 
with a splendid smash into the cucumber frame.  Something of the awe 
of that moment returns to me as I write of it.
<P>
Well, my boy," he said, approaching with an expression of beneficent 
happiness, "I've done with gardening.  Let's go for a walk like 
reasonable beings.  I've had enough of this"--his face was convulsed 
for an instant with bitter resentment--"  Pandering to cabbages."
<P>
<P>

<P>
That afternoon's walk sticks in my memory for many reasons.  One is 
that we went further than I had ever been before; far beyond Keston 
and nearly to Seven-oaks, coming back by train from Dunton Green, 
and the other is that my father as he went along talked about 
himself, not so much to me as to himself, and about life and what he 
had done with it.  He monologued so that at times he produced an 
effect of weird world-forgetfulness.  I listened puzzled, and at 
that time not upderstanding many things that afterwards became plain 
to me.  It is only in recent years that I have discovered the pathos 
of that monologue; how friendless my father was and uncompanioned in 
his thoughts and feelings, and what a hunger he may have felt for 
the sympathy of the undeveloped youngster who trotted by his side.
<P>
"I'm no gardener," he said, "I'm no anything.  Why the devil did I 
start gardening?
<P>
"I suppose man was created to mind a garden. . .  But the Fall let 
us out of that!  What was I created for?  God! what was I created 
for? . . .
<P>
"Slaves to matter!  Minding inanimate things!  It doesn't suit me, 
you know.  I've got no hands and no patience.  I've mucked about 
with life.  Mucked about with life."  He suddenly addressed himself 
to me, and for an instant I started like an eavesdropper discovered.  
"Whatever you do, boy, whatever you do, make a Plan.  Make a good 
Plan and stick to it.  Find out what life is about--I never have--
and set yourself to do whatever you ought to do.  I admit it's a 
puzzle. . . .
<P>
"Those damned houses have been the curse of my life.  Stucco white 
elephants!  Beastly cracked stucco with stains of green--black and 
green.  Conferva and soot. . . .  Property, they are! . . .  Beware 
of Things, Dick, beware of Things!  Before you know where you are 
you are waiting on them and minding them.  They'll eat your life up.  
Eat up your hours and your blood and energy!  When those houses came 
to me, I ought to have sold them--or fled the country.  I ought to 
have cleared out.  Sarcophagi--eaters of men!  Oh! the hours and 
days of work, the nights of anxiety those vile houses have cost me!  
The painting!  It worked up my arms; it got all over me.  I stank of 
it.  It made me ill.  It isn't living--it's minding. . . .
<P>
"Property's the curse of life.  Property!  Ugh!  Look at this 
country all cut up into silly little parallelograms, look at all 
those villas we passed just now and those potato patches and that 
tarred shanty and the hedge!  Somebody's minding every bit of it 
like a dog tied to a cart's tail.  Patching it and bothering about 
it.  Bothering!  Yapping at every passer-by.  Look at that notice-
board!  One rotten worried little beast wants to keep us other 
rotten little beasts off HIS patch,--God knows why!  Look at the 
weeds in it.  Look at the mended fence! . . .  There's no property 
worth having, Dick, but money.  That's only good to spend.  All 
these things.  Human souls buried under a cartload of blithering 
rubbish. . . .
<P>
"I'm not a fool, Dick.  I have qualities, imagination, a sort of go.  
I ought to have made a better thing of life.
<P>
"I'm sure I could have done things.  Only the old people pulled my 
leg.  They started me wrong.  They never started me at all.  I only 
began to find out what life was like when I was nearly forty.
<P>
"If I'd gone to a university; if I'd had any sort of sound training, 
if I hadn't slipped into the haphazard places that came easiest. . . .
<P>
"Nobody warned me.  Nobody.  It isn't a world we live in, Dick; it's 
a cascade of accidents; it's a chaos exasperated by policemen!  YOU 
be warned in time, Dick.  You stick to a plan.  Don't wait for any 
one to show you the way.  Nobody will.  There isn't a way till you 
make one.  Get education, get a good education.  Fight your way to 
the top.  It's your only chance.  I've watched you.  You'll do no 
good at digging and property minding.  There isn't a neighbour in 
Bromstead won't be able to skin you at suchlike games.  You and I 
are the brainy unstable kind, topside or nothing.  And if ever those 
blithering houses come to you--don't have 'em.  Give them away!  
Dynamite 'em--and off!  LIVE, Dick!  I'll get rid of them for you if 
I can, Dick, but remember what I say." . . .
<P>
So it was my father discoursed, if not in those particular words, 
yet exactly in that manner, as he slouched along the southward road, 
with resentful eyes becoming less resentful as he talked, and 
flinging out clumsy illustrative motions at the outskirts of 
Bromstead as we passed along them.  That afternoon he hated 
Bromstead, from its foot-tiring pebbles up.  He had no illusions 
about Bromstead or himself.  I have the clearest impression of him 
in his garden-stained tweeds with a deer-stalker hat on the back of 
his head and presently a pipe sometimes between his teeth and 
sometimes in his gesticulating hand, as he became diverted by his 
talk from his original exasperation. . . .
<P>
This particular afternoon is no doubt mixed up in my memory with 
many other afternoons; all sorts of things my father said and did at 
different times have got themselves referred to it; it filled me at 
the time with a great unprecedented sense of fellowship and it has 
become the symbol now for all our intercourse together.  If I didn't 
understand the things he said, I did the mood he was in.  He gave me 
two very broad ideas in that talk and the talks I have mingled with 
it; he gave them to me very clearly and they have remained 
fundamental in my mind; one a sense of the extraordinary confusion 
and waste and planlessness of the human life that went on all about 
us; and the other of a great ideal of order and economy which he 
called variously Science and Civilisation, and which, though I do 
not remember that he ever used that word, I suppose many people 
nowadays would identify with Socialism,--as the Fabians expound it.
<P>
He was not very definite about this Science, you must understand, 
but he seemed always to be waving his hand towards it,--just as his 
contemporary Tennyson seems always to be doing--he belonged to his 
age and mostly his talk was destructive of the limited beliefs of 
his time, he led me to infer rather than actually told me that this 
Science was coming, a spirit of light and order, to the rescue of a 
world groaning and travailing in muddle for the want of it. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
When I think of Bromstead nowadays I find it inseparably bound up 
with the disorders of my father's gardening, and the odd patchings 
and paintings that disfigured his houses.  It was all of a piece 
with that.
<P>
Let me try and give something of the quality of Bromstead and 
something of its history.  It is the quality and history of a 
thousand places round and about London, and round and about the 
other great centres of population in the world.  Indeed it is in a 
measure the quality of the whole of this modern world from which we 
who have the statesman's passion struggle to evolve, and dream still 
of evolving order.
<P>
First, then, you must think of Bromstead a hundred and fifty years 
ago, as a narrow irregular little street of thatched houses strung 
out on the London and Dover Road, a little mellow sample unit of a 
social order that had a kind of completeness, at its level, of its 
own.  At that time its population numbered a little under two 
thousand people, mostly engaged in agricultural work or in trades 
serving agriculture.  There was a blacksmith, a saddler, a chemist, 
a doctor, a barber, a linen-draper (who brewed his own beer); a 
veterinary surgeon, a hardware shop, and two capacious inns.  Round 
and about it were a number of pleasant gentlemen's seats, whose 
owners went frequently to London town in their coaches along the 
very tolerable high-road.  The church was big enough to hold the 
whole population, were people minded to go to church, and indeed a 
large proportion did go, and all who married were married in it, and 
everybody, to begin with, was christened at its font and buried at 
last in its yew-shaded graveyard.  Everybody knew everybody in the 
place.  It was, in fact, a definite place and a real human community 
in those days.  There was a pleasant old market-house in the middle 
of the town with a weekly market, and an annual fair at which much 
cheerful merry making and homely intoxication occurred; there was a 
pack of hounds which hunted within five miles of London Bridge, and 
the local gentry would occasionally enliven the place with valiant 
cricket matches for a hundred guineas a side, to the vast excitement 
of the entire population.  It was very much the same sort of place 
that it had been for three or four centuries.  A Bromstead Rip van 
Winkle from 1550 returning in 1750 would have found most of the old 
houses still as he had known them, the same trades a little improved 
and differentiated one from the other, the same roads rather more 
carefully tended, the Inns not very much altered, the ancient 
familiar market-house.  The occasional wheeled traffic would have 
struck him as the most remarkable difference, next perhaps to the 
swaggering painted stone monuments instead of brasses and the 
protestant severity of the communion-table in the parish church,--
both from the material point of view very little things.  A Rip van 
Winkle from 1350, again, would have noticed scarcely greater 
changes; fewer clergy, more people, and particularly more people of 
the middling sort; the glass in the windows of many of the houses, 
the stylish chimneys springing up everywhere would have impressed 
him, and suchlike details.  The place would have had the same 
boundaries, the same broad essential features, would have been still 
itself in the way that a man is still himself after he has "filled 
out" a little and grown a longer beard and changed his clothes.
<P>
But after 1750 something got hold of the world, something that was 
destined to alter the scale of every human affair.
<P>
That something was machinery and a vague energetic disposition to 
improve material things.  In another part of England ingenious 
people were beginning to use coal in smelting iron, and were 
producing metal in abundance and metal castings in sizes that had 
hitherto been unattainable.  Without warning or preparation, 
increment involving countless possibilities of further increment was 
coming to the strength of horses and men.   "Power," all 
unsuspected, was flowing like a drug into the veins of the social 
body.
<P>
Nobody seems to have perceived this coming of power, and nobody had 
calculated its probable consequences.  Suddenly, almost 
inadvertently, people found themselves doing things that would have 
amazed their ancestors.  They began to construct wheeled vehicles 
much more easily and cheaply than they had ever done before, to make 
up roads and move things about that had formerly been esteemed too 
heavy for locomotion, to join woodwork with iron nails instead of 
wooden pegs, to achieve all sorts of mechanical possibilities, to 
trade more freely and manufacture on a larger scale, to send goods 
abroad in a wholesale and systematic way, to bring back commodities 
from overseas, not simply spices and fine commodities, but goods in 
bulk.  The new influence spread to agriculture, iron appliances 
replaced wooden, breeding of stock became systematic, paper-making 
and printing increased and cheapened.  Roofs of slate and tile 
appeared amidst and presently prevailed over the original Bromstead 
thatch, the huge space of Common to the south was extensively 
enclosed, and what had been an ill-defined horse-track to Dover, 
only passable by adventurous coaches in dry weather, became the 
Dover Road, and was presently the route first of one and then of 
several daily coaches.  The High Street was discovered to be too 
tortuous for these awakening energies, and a new road cut off its 
worst contortions.  Residential villas appeared occupied by retired 
tradesmen and widows, who esteemed the place healthy, and by others 
of a strange new unoccupied class of people who had money invested 
in joint-stock enterprises.  First one and then several boys' 
boarding-schools came, drawing their pupils from London,--my 
grandfather's was one of these.  London, twelve miles to the north-
west, was making itself felt more and more.
<P>
But this was only the beginning of the growth period, the first 
trickle of the coming flood of mechanical power.  Away in the north 
they were casting iron in bigger and bigger forms, working their way 
to the production of steel on a large scale, applying power in 
factories.  Bromstead had almost doubted in size again long before 
the railway came; there was hardly any thatch left in the High 
Street, but instead were houses with handsome brass-knockered front 
doors and several windows, and shops with shop-fronts all of square 
glass panes, and the place was lighted publicly now by oil lamps--
previously only one flickering lamp outside each of the coaching 
inns had broken the nocturnal darkness.  And there was talk, it long 
remained talk,--of gas.  The gasworks came in 1834, and about that 
date my father's three houses must have been built convenient for 
the London Road.  They mark nearly the beginning of the real 
suburban quality; they were let at first to City people still 
engaged in business.
<P>
And then hard on the gasworks had come the railway and cheap coal; 
there was a wild outbreak of brickfields upon the claylands to the 
east, and the Great Growth had begun in earnest.  The agricultural 
placidities that had formerly come to the very borders of the High 
Street were broken up north, west and south, by new roads.  This 
enterprising person and then that began to "run up" houses, 
irrespective of every other enterprising person who was doing the 
same thing.  A Local Board came into existence, and with much 
hesitation and penny-wise economy inaugurated drainage works.  Rates 
became a common topic, a fact of accumulating importance.  Several 
chapels of zinc and iron appeared, and also a white new church in 
commercial Gothic upon the common, and another of red brick in the 
residential district out beyond the brickfields towards Chessington.
<P>
The population doubled again and doubled again, and became 
particularly teeming in the prolific "working-class" district about 
the deep-rutted, muddy, coal-blackened roads between the gasworks, 
Blodgett's laundries, and the railway goods-yard.  Weekly 
properties, that is to say small houses built by small property 
owners and let by the week, sprang up also in the Cage Fields, and 
presently extended right up the London Road.  A single national 
school in an inconvenient situation set itself inadequately to 
collect subscriptions and teach the swarming, sniffing, grimy 
offspring of this dingy new population to read.  The villages of 
Beckington, which used to be three miles to the west, and Blamely 
four miles to the east of Bromstead, were experiencing similar 
distensions and proliferations, and grew out to meet us.  All effect 
of locality or community had gone from these places long before I 
was born; hardly any one knew any one; there was no general meeting 
place any more, the old fairs were just common nuisances haunted by 
gypsies, van showmen, Cheap Jacks and London roughs, the churches 
were incapable of a quarter of the population.  One or two local 
papers of shameless veniality reported the proceedings of the local 
Bench and the local Board, compelled tradesmen who were interested 
in these affairs to advertise, used the epithet "Bromstedian" as one 
expressing peculiar virtues, and so maintained in the general mind a 
weak tradition of some local quality that embraced us all.  Then the 
parish graveyard filled up and became a scandal, and an ambitious 
area with an air of appetite was walled in by a Bromstead Cemetery 
Company, and planted with suitably high-minded and sorrowful 
varieties of conifer.  A stonemason took one of the earlier villas 
with a front garden at the end of the High Street, and displayed a 
supply of urns on pillars and headstones and crosses in stone, 
marble, and granite, that would have sufficed to commemorate in 
elaborate detail the entire population of Bromstead as one found it 
in 1750.
<P>
The cemetery was made when I was a little boy of five or six; I was 
in the full tide of building and growth from the first; the second 
railway with its station at Bromstead North and the drainage 
followed when I was ten or eleven, and all my childish memories are 
of digging and wheeling, of woods invaded by building, roads gashed 
open and littered with iron pipes amidst a fearful smell of gas, of 
men peeped at and seen toiling away deep down in excavations, of 
hedges broken down and replaced by planks, of wheelbarrows and 
builders' sheds, of rivulets overtaken and swallowed up by drain-
pipes.  Big trees, and especially elms, cleared of undergrowth and 
left standing amid such things, acquired a peculiar tattered 
dinginess rather in the quality of needy widow women who have seen 
happier days.
<P>
The Ravensbrook of my earlier memories was a beautiful stream.  It 
came into my world out of a mysterious Beyond, out of a garden, 
splashing brightly down a weir which had once been the weir of a 
mill.  (Above the weir and inaccessible there were bulrushes growing 
in splendid clumps, and beyond that, pampas grass, yellow and 
crimson spikes of hollyhock, and blue suggestions of wonderland.)  
From the pool at the foot of this initial cascade it flowed in a 
leisurely fashion beside a footpath,--there were two pretty thatchcd 
cottages on the left, and here were ducks, and there were willows on 
the right,--and so came to where great trees grew on high banks on 
either hand and bowed closer, and at last met overhead.  This part 
was difficult to reach because of an old fence, but a little boy 
might glimpse that long cavern of greenery by wading.  Either I have 
actually seen kingfishers there, or my father has described them so 
accurately to me that he inserted them into my memory.  I remember 
them there anyhow.  Most of that overhung part I never penetrated at 
all, but followed the field path with my mother and met the stream 
again, where beyond there were flat meadows, Roper's meadows.  The 
Ravensbrook went meandering across the middle of these, now between 
steep banks, and now with wide shallows at the bends where the 
cattle waded and drank.  Yellow and purple loose-strife and ordinary 
rushes grew in clumps along the bank, and now and then a willow.  On 
rare occasions of rapture one might see a rat cleaning his whiskers 
at the water's edge.  The deep places were rich with tangled weeds, 
and in them fishes lurked--to me they were big fishes--water-boatmen 
and water-beetles traversed the calm surface of these still deeps; 
in one pool were yellow lilies and water-soldiers, and in the shoaly 
places hovering fleets of small fry basked in the sunshine--to 
vanish in a flash at one's shadow.  In one place, too, were Rapids, 
where the stream woke with a start from a dreamless brooding into 
foaming panic and babbled and hastened.  Well do I remember that 
half-mile of rivulet; all other rivers and cascades have their 
reference to it for me.  And after I was eleven, and before we left 
Bromstead, all the delight and beauty of it was destroyed.
<P>
The volume of its water decreased abruptly--I suppose the new 
drainage works that linked us up with Beckington, and made me first 
acquainted with the geological quality of the London clay, had to do 
with that--until only a weak uncleansing trickle remained.  That at 
first did not strike me as a misfortune.  An adventurous small boy 
might walk dryshod in places hitherto inaccessible.  But hard upon 
that came the pegs, the planks and carts and devastation.  Roper's 
meadows, being no longer in fear of floods, were now to be slashed 
out into parallelograms of untidy road, and built upon with rows of 
working-class cottages.  The roads came,--horribly; the houses 
followed.  They seemed to rise in the night.  People moved into them 
as soon as the roofs were on, mostly workmen and their young wives, 
and already in a year some of these raw houses stood empty again 
from defaulting tenants, with windows broken and wood-work warping 
and rotting.  The Ravensbrook became a dump for old iron, rusty 
cans, abandoned boots and the like, and was a river only when 
unusual rains filled it for a day or so with an inky flood of 
surface water. . . .
<P>
That indeed was my most striking perception in the growth of 
Bromstead.  The Ravensbrook had been important to my imaginative 
life; that way had always been my first choice in all my walks with 
my mother, and its rapid swamping by the new urban growth made it 
indicative of all the other things that had happened just before my 
time, or were still, at a less dramatic pace, happening.  I realised 
that building was the enemy.  I began to understand why in every 
direction out of Bromstead one walked past scaffold-poles into 
litter, why fragments of broken brick and cinder mingled in every 
path, and the significance of the universal notice-boards, either 
white and new or a year old and torn and battered, promising sites, 
proffering houses to be sold or let, abusing and intimidating 
passers-by for fancied trespass, and protecting rights of way.
<P>
It is difficult to disentangle now what I understood at this time 
and what I have since come to understand, but it seems to me that 
even in those childish days I was acutely aware of an invading and 
growing disorder.  The serene rhythms of the old established 
agriculture, I see now, were everywhere being replaced by 
cultivation under notice and snatch crops; hedges ceased to be 
repaired, and were replaced by cheap iron railings or chunks of 
corrugated iron; more and more hoardings sprang up, and contributed 
more and more to the nomad tribes of filthy paper scraps that flew 
before the wind and overspread the country.  The outskirts of 
Bromstead were a maze of exploitation roads that led nowhere, that 
ended in tarred fences studded with nails (I don't remember barbed 
wire in those days; I think the Zeitgeist did not produce that until 
later), and in trespass boards that used vehement language.  Broken 
glass, tin cans, and ashes and paper abounded.  Cheap glass, cheap 
tin, abundant fuel, and a free untaxed Press had rushed upon a world 
quite unprepared to dispose of these blessings when the fulness of 
enjoyment was past.
<P>
I suppose one might have persuaded oneself that all this was but the 
replacement of an ancient tranquillity, or at least an ancient 
balance, by a new order.  Only to my eyes, quickened by my father's 
intimations, it was manifestly no order at all.  It was a multitude 
of incoordinated fresh starts, each more sweeping and destructive 
than the last, and none of them ever really worked out to a ripe and 
satisfactory completion.  Each left a legacy of products, houses, 
humanity, or what not, in its wake.  It was a sort of progress that 
had bolted; it was change out of hand, and going at an unprecedented 
pace nowhere in particular.
<P>
No, the Victorian epoch was not the dawn of a new era; it was a 
hasty, trial experiment, a gigantic experiment of the most slovenly 
and wasteful kind.  I suppose it was necessary; I suppose all things 
are necessary.  I suppose that before men will discipline themselves 
to learn and plan, they must first see in a hundred convincing forms 
the folly and muddle that come from headlong, aimless and haphazard 
methods.  The nineteenth century was an age of demonstrations, some 
of them very impressive demonstrations, of the powers that have come 
to mankind, but of permanent achievement, what will our descendants 
cherish?  It is hard to estimate what grains of precious metal may 
not be found in a mud torrent of human production on so large a 
scale, but will any one, a hundred years from now, consent to live 
in the houses the Victorians built, travel by their roads or 
railways, value the furnishings they made to live among or esteem, 
except for curious or historical reasons, their prevalent art and 
the clipped and limited literature that satisfied their souls?
<P>
That age which bore me was indeed a world full of restricted and 
undisciplined people, overtaken by power, by possessions and great 
new freedoms, and unable to make any civilised use of them whatever; 
stricken now by this idea and now by that, tempted first by one 
possession and then another to ill-considered attempts; it was my 
father's exploitahon of his villa gardens on the wholesale level.  
The whole of Bromstead as I remember it, and as I saw it last--it is 
a year ago now--is a dull useless boiling-up of human activities, an 
immense clustering of futilities.  It is as unfinished as ever; the 
builders' roads still run out and end in mid-field in their old 
fashion; the various enterprises jumble in the same hopeless 
contradiction, if anything intensified.  Pretentious villas jostle 
slums, and public-house and tin tabernacle glower at one another 
across the cat-haunted lot that intervenes.  Roper's meadows are now 
quite frankly a slum; back doors and sculleries gape towards the 
railway, their yards are hung with tattered washing unashamed; and 
there seem to be more boards by the railway every time I pass, 
advertising pills and pickles, tonics and condiments, and suchlike 
solicitudes of a people with no natural health nor appetite left in 
them. . . .
<P>
Well, we have to do better.  Failure is not failure nor waste wasted 
if it sweeps away illusion and lights the road to a plan.
<P>
<P>

<P>
Chaotic indiscipline, ill-adjusted effort, spasmodic aims, these 
give the quality of all my Bromstead memories.  The crowning one of 
them all rises to desolating tragedy.  I remember now the wan spring 
sunshine of that Sunday morning, the stiff feeling of best clothes 
and aggressive cleanliness and formality, when I and my mother 
returned from church to find my father dead.  He had been pruning 
the grape vine.  He had never had a ladder long enough to reach the 
sill of the third-floor windows--at house-painting times he had 
borrowed one from the plumber who mixed his paint--and he had in his 
own happy-go-lucky way contrived a combination of the garden fruit 
ladder with a battered kitchen table that served all sorts of odd 
purposes in an outhouse.  He had stayed up this arrangement by means 
of the garden roller, and the roller had at the critical moment--
rolled.  He was lying close by the garden door with his head queerly 
bent back against a broken and twisted rainwater pipe, an expression 
of pacific contentment on his face, a bamboo curtain rod with a 
tableknife tied to end of it, still gripped in his hand.  We had 
been rapping for some time at the front door unable to make him 
hear, and then we came round by the door in the side trellis into 
the garden and so discovered him.
<P>
"Arthur!"  I remember my mother crying with the strangest break in 
her voice, "What are you doing there?  Arthur!  And--SUNDAY!"
<P>
I was coming behind her, musing remotely, when the quality of her 
voice roused me.  She stood as if she could not go near him.  He had 
always puzzled her so, he and his ways, and this seemed only another 
enigma.  Then the truth dawned on her, she shrieked as if afraid of 
him, ran a dozen steps back towards the trellis door and stopped and 
clasped her ineffectual gloved hands, leaving me staring blankly, 
too astonished for feeling, at the carelessly flung limbs.
<P>
The same idea came to me also.  I ran to her.  "Mother!" I cried, 
pale to the depths of my spirit, "IS HE DEAD?"
<P>
I had been thinking two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that 
glorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into 
the tree at the end of the garden to read in the afternoon.  Now an 
immense fact had come down like a curtain and blotted out all my 
childish world.  My father was lying dead before my eyes. . . .   I 
perceived that my mother was helpless and that things must he done.
<P>
"Mother!" I said, "we must get Doctor Beaseley,--and carry him 
indoors."
