<p>Chirpy Cricket preferred the dark to the day. He was quite different from
Jennie Junebug and Mehitable Moth, who dearly loved a light at night, and
would dash joyously into any they saw.
</p>
<p>There was only one light that Chirpy Cricket was always glad to see. He
thought Freddie Firefly's flashes looked very cheerful as they twinkled
about the farmyard. And he often told Freddie that he would be willing to
linger above ground in the daytime now and then, if only Freddie would
stay with him and make merry with his light.
</p><p>But Freddie Firefly knew enough to decline the invitation. He was well
aware that nobody could see his light when the sun was shining. And he
was afraid that other merrymakers in the farmyard might make matters far
from merry for him. For Freddie Firefly feared all birds. At night he
used his trusty light to frighten Mr. Nighthawk or Willie Whip-poor-will.
But he didn't intend to run any risk in the daytime, with Jolly Robin or
Rusty Wren.
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket soon saw that it was useless to try to get Freddie Firefly
to enjoy an outing with him by daylight. So every night he spent as much
time as he could in Freddie's company.
</p><p>If the truth were known, Chirpy Cricket wished that he had a light of his
own. And he couldn't help hoping that sooner or later Freddie Firefly
would offer to lend him his.
</p><p>Night after night the two met in the farmyard. But nothing seemed further
from Freddie Firefly's thoughts than lending his brilliant greenish-white
light to Chirpy Cricket, or to any one else.
</p><p>But Chirpy simply couldn't keep his eyes off that wonderful flash-light
when Freddie Firefly was in the neighborhood. People began to notice that
he even stopped fiddling sometimes, to stare at Freddie Firefly.
</p><p>At last Chirpy Cricket made up his mind that if he was ever going to
borrow the light he would have to ask Freddie for it. Several nights
passed before he could think of a good reason for using it. But after a
while he thought of a fine one. So he went straight to Freddie Firefly.
</p><p>"I'm going to see Miss Christabel Cricket home after the music is over
tonight," Chirpy said, "and I've been wondering if you'd be willing to do
me a favor."
</p><p>"Why, certainly!" Freddie Firefly told him.
</p><p>"Will you loan me your light?" Chirpy asked him. "You know there'll be no
moon when it's time to go home. And your light would be a great help to
me, for Miss Christabel lives beyond the barnyard fence."
</p><p>For just a few moments Freddy Firefly appeared greatly surprised. To tell
the truth, Chirpy's request almost took his breath away. And while he
recovered himself he forgot to flash his light--a most unusual
oversight.
</p><p>But Freddie was no person to disappoint a friend. Besides, he had just
said, "Why, certainly!"
</p><p>Really, there was nothing for him to do but to say the same thing again.
