EDITORIAL
<P>
It is with heartfelt regret that we take up our pen to announce
that this will be the last number of Our Magazine.  We have edited
ten numbers of it and it has been successful beyond our
expectations.  It has to be discontinued by reason of
circumstances over which we have no control and not because we
have lost interest in it.  Everybody has done his or her best for
Our Magazine.  Prince Edward Island expected everyone to do his
and her duty and everyone did it.
<P>
Mr. Dan King conducted the etiquette department in a way worthy of
the Family Guide itself.  He is especially entitled to
commendation because he laboured under the disadvantage of having
to furnish most of the questions as well as the answers.  Miss
Felicity King has edited our helpful household department very
ably, and Miss Cecily King's fashion notes were always up to date. 
The personal column was well looked after by Miss Sara Stanley and
the story page has been a marked success under the able management
of Mr. Peter Craig, to whose original story in this issue, "The
Battle of the Partridge Eggs," we would call especial attention. 
The Exciting Adventure series has also been very popular.
<P>
And now, in closing, we bid farewell to our staff and thank them
one and all for their help and co-operation in the past year.  We
have enjoyed our work and we trust that they have too.  We wish
them all happiness and success in years to come, and we hope that
the recollection of Our Magazine will not be held least dear among
the memories of their childhood.

OBITUARY
<P>
On October eighteenth, Patrick Grayfur departed for that bourne
whence no traveller returns.  He was only a cat, but he had been
our faithful friend for a long time and we aren't ashamed to be
sorry for him.  There are lots of people who are not as friendly
and gentlemanly as Paddy was, and he was a great mouser.  We
buried all that was mortal of poor Pat in the orchard and we are
never going to forget him.  We have resolved that whenever the
date of his death comes round we'll bow our heads and pronounce
his name at the hour of his funeral.  If we are anywhere where we
can't say the name out loud we'll whisper it.
<P>
<P>
"Farewell, dearest Paddy, in all the years that are to be
We'll cherish your memory faithfully."[1]
<P>
<P>
[1] The obituary was written by Mr. Felix King, but the two lines
of poetry were composed by Miss Sara Ray.

MY MOST EXCITING ADVENTURE
<P>
My most exciting adventure was the day I fell off Uncle Roger's
loft two years ago.  I wasn't excited until it was all over
because I hadn't time to be.  The Story Girl and I were looking
for eggs in the loft.  It was filled with wheat straw nearly to
the roof and it was an awful distance from us to the floor.  And
wheat straw is so slippery.  I made a little spring and the straw
slipped from under my feet and there I was going head first down
from the loft.  It seemed to me I was an awful long time falling,
but the Story Girl says I couldn't have been more than three
seconds.  But I know that I thought five thoughts and there seemed
to be quite a long time between them.  The first thing I thought
was, what has happened, because I really didn't know at first, it
was so sudden.  Then after a spell I thought the answer, I am
falling off the loft.  And then I thought, what will happen to me
when I strike the floor, and after another little spell I thought,
I'll be killed.  And then I thought, well, I don't care.  I really
wasn't a bit frightened.  I just was quite willing to be killed. 
If there hadn't been a big pile of chaff on the barn floor these
words would never have been written.  But there was and I fell on
it and wasn't a bit hurt, only my hair and mouth and eyes and ears
got all full of chaff.  The strange part is that I wasn't a bit
frightened when I thought I was going to be killed, but after all
the danger was over I was awfully frightened and trembled so the
Story Girl had to help me into the house.

THE BATTLE OF THE PARTRIDGE EGGS
<P>
Once upon a time there lived about half a mile from a forrest a
farmer and his wife and his sons and daughters and a
granddaughter.  The farmer and his wife loved this little girl
very much but she caused them great trouble by running away into
the woods and they often spent haf days looking for her.  One day
she wondered further into the forrest than usual and she begun to
be hungry.  Then night closed in.  She asked a fox where she could
get something to eat.  The fox told her he knew where there was a
partridges nest and a bluejays nest full of eggs.  So he led her
to the nests and she took five eggs out of each.  When the birds
came home they missed the eggs and flew into a rage.  The bluejay
put on his topcoat and was going to the partridge for law when he
met the partridge coming to him.  They lit up a fire and commenced
sining their deeds when they heard a tremendous howl close behind
them.  They jumped up and put out the fire and were immejutly
attacked by five great wolves.  The next day the little girl was
rambelling through the woods when they saw her and took her
prisoner.  After she had confessed that she had stole the eggs
they told her to raise an army.  They would have to fight over the
nests of eggs and whoever one would have the eggs.  So the
partridge raised a great army of all kinds of birds except robins
and the little girl got all the robins and foxes and bees and
wasps.  And best of all the little girl had a gun and plenty of
ammunishun.  The leader of her army was a wolf.  The result of the
battle was that all the birds were killed except the partridge and
the bluejay and they were taken prisoner and starved to death.
<P>
The little girl was then taken prisoner by a witch and cast into a
dunjun full of snakes where she died from their bites and people
who went through the forrest after that were taken prisoner by her
ghost and cast into the same dunjun where they died.  About a year
after the wood turned into a gold castle and one morning
everything had vanished except a piece of a tree.

<P>
<P>
(DAN, WITH A WHISTLE:--"Well, I guess nobody can say Peter can't
write fiction after THAT."
<P>
SARA RAY, WIPING AWAY HER TEARS:--"It's a very interesting story,
but it ends SO sadly."
<P>
FELIX:--"What made you call it The Battle of the Partridge Eggs
when the bluejay had just as much to do with it?"
<P>
PETER, SHORTLY:--"Because it sounded better that way."
<P>
FELICITY:--"Did she eat the eggs raw?"
<P>
SARA RAY:--"Poor little thing, I suppose if you're starving you
can't be very particular."
<P>
CECILY, SIGHING:--"I wish you'd let her go home safe, Peter, and
not put her to such a cruel death."
<P>
BEVERLEY:--"I don't quite understand where the little girl got her
gun and ammunition."
<P>
PETER, SUSPECTING THAT HE IS BEING MADE FUN OF:--"If you could
write a better story, why didn't you?  I give you the chance."
<P>
THE STORY GIRL, WITH A PRETERNATURALLY SOLEMN FACE:--"You
shouldn't criticize Peter's story like that.  It's a fairy tale, 
you know, and anything can happen in a fairy tale."
<P>
FELICITY:--"There isn't a word about fairies in it!"
<P>
CECILY:--"Besides, fairy tales always end nicely and this
doesn't."
<P>
PETER, SULKILY:--"I wanted to punish her for running away from
home."
<P>
DAN:--"Well, I guess you did it all right."
<P>
CECILY:--"Oh, well, it was very interesting, and that is all that
is really necessary in a story." )

Yes, P-t-r, when you call on a young lady and her mother offers
you a slice of bread and jam it is quite polite for you to accept
it.
