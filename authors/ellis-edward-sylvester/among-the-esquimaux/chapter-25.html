<p>Docak, the Esquimau, had no wish to affect any mystery as to
the cause of his misgiving. He had not mentioned it of his own
accord, because he was debating in his mind which of two courses
to adopt: to remain longer in the cavern or to set out at once
for his home on the coast. It may be said that except for the
appearance of the wolves he would have insisted that the start
should be made without delay, and pushed with the utmost vigor
until their destination was reached.</p>

<p>But this was not to be thought of under the circumstances. To
venture outside the cavern was to invite an instant attack by
the brutes who were in that state that they possessed a daring
foreign to their nature.</p>

<p>Docak explained that an alarming change of weather was at hand.
He knew the signs so well that there was no mistake on his part.
As he had promised, it was not in the nature of a thaw or rising
temperature, but may be explained by that expressive word with
which the reader is familiar&mdash;blizzard.</p>

<p>Whoever has gone through one of those frightful visitations will
never forget it. That one of a few years ago was so general throughout
our country that the memory must remain through life with us.</p>

<p>But a blizzard in the Arctic regions is a terror, indeed. It
meant in the present instance a snowstorm that might last for
days, a hurricane of wind, and a temperature of such fearful cold
that would consume almost like fire.</p>

<p>With several feet of snow on the surface of that which now covered
the ground, and too fine to bear the weight of the lightest animal,
with the air white with billions of particles, eddying, whirling,
and flying hither and thither, so that one could not see a step
in advance&mdash;with the gale careering like a demon across the snowy
wastes&mdash;the strongest hunter might well shrink from attempting
a journey one-tenth of that which lay between them and the coast.</p>

<p>When Jack suggested that Docak might be mistaken, he shook his
head so decisively that it sent a chill through the boys, who
were watching his dusky countenance and listening to his words.
Such a man spoke that whereof he knew. He would hold out hope,
if he had justification for doing so, but he saw none.</p>

<p>That the blizzard was at hand, that it was already careering
from the far North and must speedily arrive, was as good as demonstrated.
The only chance that Docak saw was that it might prove of shorter
duration than he feared. If it should last no more than twelve
or possibly twenty-four hours, they might struggle through it,
without serious consequences, but if beyond that (as he was almost
certain it would be), there was little hope.</p>

<p>However, since they must stay where they were until the following
morning, preparations were made for spending the night, which,
it will be borne in mind, was by no means as long as many which
they have at certain seasons in the high latitudes.</p>

<p>It was decided that Rob should sit up until midnight and then
awake Fred, who, after standing guard for several hours, would
arouse Jack to take charge until daylight. Inasmuch as this was
the Esquimau's own proposition, which, as will be perceived, relieved
him of duty for any part of the night, the others understood its
significance. He was reserving himself for the time when there
was likely to be more urgent need of his services.</p>

<p>No comment was made on the fact, and the simple preparations
were quickly finished. Docak added a caution to his friends that
they should be as sparing as possible in the use of the fuel.
They had already consumed a moiety of it, and the approach of
the blizzard would render it valuable beyond estimate. Enough
only to hold the wolves at a safe distance was to be burned.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that an hour later Rob Carrol was the only
one awake in the cavern. The others were huddled together on the
bear skin, quietly sleeping, while he kept off drowsiness by pacing
slowly back and forth over the brief space within.</p>

<p>"It's getting colder," he said to himself more than once; "I
had a hope that Docak might be wrong, but he isn't; we shall catch
it within a few hours. This is a bad place to be snowed up."</p>

<p>He glanced continually toward the entrance, for he could not
forget the wolves which were the indirect cause of their coming
peril. They seemed, in spite of the disgusted remarks of Jack,
to have become satisfied that nothing was to be gained by hovering
about the refuge. So many of their comrades had fallen, and the
fire burned so persistently, that the others must have felt a
certain degree of discouragement.</p>

<p>Now and then a howl echoed among the desolate hills, with a strange
power, and was immediately answered by scores from as many different
points, but there was no such eager crowding as marked the first
appearance of the brutes. Rob glanced repeatedly at the opening
without seeing one of them.</p>

<p>But the youth was too wise to be caught off his guard. He allowed
the fire to smolder until the figures of his friends were only
barely visible in the gloom, and his own form became shadowy,
as it slowly moved back and forth over the floor of the cavern,
with his rifle ready for instant use.</p>

<p>He heard a soft tip tipping on the snow, and there was no mistaking
its meaning.</p>

<p>"They're there," he said, peering outward in the gloom and listening
intently, "and are as watchful for a chance as ever."</p>

<p>Turning toward the crevice which admitted light, and was too
straight to allow the smallest wolf to pass through, he caught
the glow of a pair of eyes.</p>

<p>They were motionless, and the wolf evidently was studying the
interior with a view of learning the prospect for an excursion
within.</p>

<p>The temptation to fire was strong, but the eyes noiselessly vanished
before the gun could be brought to a level.</p>

<p>Rob stood intently listening. He heard the stealthy footsteps
pass along the side of the cavern toward the front, and he moved
in that direction, but placed himself at one side, so as to be
out of sight of any one looking directly into the mouth. He had
not long to wait, when the same keenness of ear told him that
the brute was cautiously entering. The fire was smoldering lower
than ever, the brand at the entrance had died out long before,
and no one could be seen on guard. The brute must have made up
his mind that he had "struck it rich." In his selfishness he did
not summon his friends to the feast, but resolved to devour the
four persons all by himself, and that, too, after having had his
full share of the musk ox and his fallen friends!</p>

<p>There was just enough light in the cavern for Rob to note everything.
Being at one side of the entrance, he could not be detected by
the sneaking brute, which also was invisible to him. He must come
further forward before they could discern each other.</p>

<p>The wolf, one of the largest of his species, stood just outside
with his ears pricked, his head raised, and his eyes roaming over
the interior. Everything looked promising, but he had learned
to be suspicious of those bipeds, whose hands were always against
them.</p>

<p>He stood in this attitude for several minutes, as stationary
as if carved in stone. Then he lifted one of his fore-feet, held
it suspended, as though he were pointing game, and then advanced
a couple of steps. This brought him far enough into the cavern
for the lad to see the end of his nose, but the beast still failed
to detect that shadow at one side of the entrance that was calmly
awaiting the critical moment.</p>

<p>But he saw the dimly outlined forms near the smoldering fire,
and licked his chops in anticipation. Nothing could be more favorable
for the grandest feast of his life.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: <em>THE WOLF LICKED HIS CHOPS IN ANTICIPATION</em></p>

<p>  (See page 232)]</p>

<p>At that moment a howl rent the air at no great distance. It must
have startled this prowler, and told him that, if he delayed his
meal any longer, he must share it with an unlimited number.</p>

<p>He started on a silent walk, straight for the forms, heedless
of the figure that had pointed the rifle at him, while he was
yet out of sight. All was like the tomb until the gun was fired.
Then since the muzzle almost touched the brute, why&mdash;enough has
been said.</p>
