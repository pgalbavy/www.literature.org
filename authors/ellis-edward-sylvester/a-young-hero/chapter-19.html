<p>When Archibald Jackson, constable of Tottenville and the surrounding
country, strode forth from the home of Widow Sheldon on the night
of the call which we have described, he felt like "shaking hands
with himself," for he was confident he had made one of the greatest
strikes that ever came in the way of any one in his profession&mdash;a
strike that would render him famous throughout the country, and
even in the city of New York.</p>

<p>"A man has to be born a detective," he said, as he fell over
a wheelbarrow at the side of the road; "for without great natural
gifts he cannot attain to preeminence, as it were, in his profession.
I was born a detective, and would have beaten any of those fellows
from Irish Yard or Welsh Yard or Scotland Yard, or whatever they
call it.</p>

<p>"Queer I never thought of it before, but that was always the
trouble with me; I've been too modest," he added, as he climbed
over the fence to pick up his hat, which a limb had knocked off;
"but when this robbery at the Misses Perkinpine's occurred, instead
of relying on my own brains I must send for Mr. Carter, and was
worried half to death because he didn't come.</p>

<p>"I s'pose he found the task was too gigantic for him, so he wouldn't
run the risk of failure. Then for the first time I sot down and
begun to use my brains. It didn't take me long to work the thing
out; it came to me like a flash, as it always does to men of genius&mdash;confound
that root; it's ripped the toe of my shoe off."</p>

<p>But Archie was so elevated in the region of conceit and self-satisfaction
that he could not be disturbed by the petty annoyances of earth;
he strode along the road with his chest thrust forward and his
head so high in air that it was no wonder his feet tripped and
bothered him now and then.</p>

<p>"I don't see any use of delaying the blow," he added, as he approached
his home; "it will make a sensation to-morrow when the exposure
is made. The New York papers will be full of it and they will
send their reporters to interview me. They'll print a sketch of
my life and nominate me for governor, and the illustrated papers
will have my picture, and my wife Betsey will find what a man
of genius her husband&mdash;ah! oh! I forgot about that post!"</p>

<p>He was recalled to himself by a violent collision with the hitching-post
in front of his own house, and picking up his hat and waiting
until he could gain full command of his breath, he entered the
bosom of his family fully resolved to "strike the blow" on the
morrow, which should make him famous throughout the country.</p>

<p>With the rising of the sun he found himself feeling more important
than ever. Swallowing his breakfast hastily and looking at his
bruised knuckles, he bade his family good-by, telling his wife
if anybody came after him they should be told that the constable
had gone away on imperative business.</p>

<p>With this farewell Archie went to the depot, boarded the cars
and started for the country town of Walsingham, fifty miles distant.
He bought a copy of a leading daily, and after viewing the scenery
for several miles, pretended to read, while he gave free rein
to his imagination and drew a gorgeous picture of the near future.</p>

<p>"To-morrow the papers will be full of it," he said, not noticing
that several were smiling because he held the journal upside down,
"and they'll want to put me on the force in New York. They've
got to pay me a good salary if they get me&mdash;that's sartin."</p>

<p>Some time after he drew forth a couple of legal documents, which
he read with care, as he had read them a score of times. They
were correctly-drawn papers calling for the arrest of two certain
parties.</p>

<p>"The warrants are all right," mused the officer, as he replaced
them carefully in the inside pocket of his coat, "and the two
gentlemen&mdash;and especially one of them&mdash;will open his eyes when
I place my hand on his shoulder and tell him he is wanted."</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, the constable left the cars at the town
of Walsingham, which was in the extreme corner of the county that
also held Tottenville, and walked in his pompous fashion toward
that portion where Colonel Bandman's menagerie and circus were
making ready for the usual display.</p>

<p>It was near the hour of noon, and the regular street parade had
taken place, and the hundreds of people from the country were
tramping back and forth, crunching peanuts, eating lunch and making
themselves ill on the diluted stuff sold under the name of lemonade.</p>

<p>The constable paid scarcely any heed to these, but wended his
way to the hotel, where he inquired for Colonel Bandman, the proprietor
of the establishment which was creating such an excitement through
the country.</p>

<p>Archie was told that he had just sat down to dinner, whereupon
he said he would wait until the gentleman was through, as he did
not wish to be too severe upon him. Then the officer occupied
a chair by the window on the inside, and feeling in his pockets,
to make sure the warrants were there, he kept an eye on the dining-room,
to be certain the proprietor did not take the alarm and get away.</p>

<p>After a long time Colonel Bandman, a tall, well-dressed gentleman,
came forth, hat in hand, and looked about him, as if he expected
to meet some one.</p>

<p>"Are you the gentleman who was inquiring for me?" he asked, advancing
toward the constable, who rose to his feet, and with all the impressiveness
of manner which he could assume, said, as he placed his hand on
his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Colonel James Bandman, you are my prisoner!"</p>

<p>The other donned his hat, looked somewhat surprised, as was natural,
and with his eyes fixed on the face of the constable, asked:</p>

<p>"On what charge am I arrested?"</p>

<p>"Burglary."</p>

<p>"Let me see the warrant."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," said Mr. Jackson, drawing forth a document
from his pocket and opening it before him; "read it for yourself."</p>

<p>The colonel glanced at it for a moment, and said with a half
smile:</p>

<p>"My name is not mentioned there; that calls upon you to arrest
Thomas Gibby, who is my ticket agent."</p>

<p>"Oh, ah&mdash;that's the wrong paper; here's the right one."</p>

<p>With which he gave Colonel James Bandman the pleasure of reading
the document, which, in due and legal form, commanded Archibald
Jackson to take the gentleman into custody.</p>

<p>"I presume the offense is bailable?" asked the colonel, with
an odd smile.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly, sir; I will accompany you before a magistrate
who will fix your bail. Where can I find Mr. Gibby?"</p>

<p>"I will bring him, if you will excuse me for a minute."</p>

<p>Colonel Bandman started to enter the hotel again, but the vigilant
constable caught his arm:</p>

<p>"No you don't; I'll stay with you, please; we'll go together;
I don't intend you shall slip through my fingers."</p>

<p>The colonel was evidently good-natured, for he only laughed and
then, allowing the officer to take his arm, started for the dining-room,
but unexpectedly met the individual whom they wanted in the hall.</p>

<p>When Gibby had been made acquainted with the business of the
severe-looking official he was disposed to get angry, but a word
and a suggestive look from Colonel Bandman quieted him, and the
two walked with the officer in the direction of a magistrate.</p>

<p>"I've got this thing down fine on you," ventured Mr. Jackson,
by way of helping them to a feeling of resignation, "the proofs
of the nefarious transaction in which you were engaged being beyond
question."</p>

<p>Colonel Bandman made no answer, though his companion muttered
something which their custodian did not catch. As they walked
through the street they attracted some attention, but it was only
a short distance to the magistrate's office, where the official
listened attentively to the complaints. When made aware of its
character he turned smilingly toward the chief prisoner and said:</p>

<p>"Well, colonel, what have you to say to this?"</p>

<p>"I should like to ask Mr. Jackson on what grounds he bases his
charge of burglary against me."</p>

<p>"The house of the Misses Perkinpine, near Tottenville, in this
county, was robbed of a lot of valuable silver plate and several
hundred dollars in money on Monday night last. It was the night
before the circus showed in that town. Fortunately for the cause
of justice the two parties were seen and identified, especially
the one who did the actual robbing. A bright young boy, who is
very truthful, saw the robber at his work, identified him as the
ungrateful wretch who was given his supper by the two excellent
ladies, whom he basely robbed afterward. The description of the
pretended tramp corresponds exactly with that of Colonel Bandman&mdash;so
closely, indeed, that there can be no mistake about him. The account
of his confederate is not so full, but it is sufficient to identify
him as Mr. Gibby, there. When I was assured beyond all mistake
that they were the two wretches I took out them warrants in proper
form, as you will find, and I now ask that they may be held to
await the action of the grand jury."</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of this rather grandiloquent speech,
Mr. Jackson bowed to the court and stepped back to allow the accused
to speak.</p>

<p>Colonel Bandman, instead of doing so, turned to the magistrate
and nodded for him to say something. That official, addressing
himself to the constable, asked:</p>

<p>"You are certain this offense was committed on last Monday evening?"</p>

<p>"There can be no possible mistake about it."</p>

<p>"And it was done by these two?"</p>

<p>"That is equally sartin."</p>

<p>"If one is guilty both are; if one is innocent so is the other?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; if you choose to put it that way."</p>

<p>"It becomes my duty to inform you then, Mr. Jackson, that Colonel
Bandman has not been out of the town of Walsingham for the past
six weeks; he is an old schoolmate of mine, and on last Monday
night he stayed in my house with his wife and daughter. This complaint
is dismissed, and the best thing you can do is to hasten home
by the next train. Good day, sir."</p>

<p>Archie wanted to say something, but he could think of nothing
appropriate, and, catching up his hat, he made haste to the station
where he boarded the cars without a ticket. He was never known
to refer to his great mistake afterward unless some one else mentioned
it, and even then the constable always seemed anxious to turn
the subject to something else.</p>
