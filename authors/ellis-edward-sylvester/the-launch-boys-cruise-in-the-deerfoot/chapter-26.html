<p>The reply to the telegram was delayed so long that the <em>Island
Belle</em> was in sight when the operator handed it to the impatient
Alvin.</p>

"Mr. Richards has gone to Mouse Island. No saying when he will<br/>
return.

</p>
<p>
"G. R. <em>WESTERFIELD</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>"We shall have to wait till we get home," commented Chester,
"and that won't be long."</p>

<p>The well-known steamer <em>Island Belle</em> is a good boat of
moderate speed, and pursuing its winding course was moored at
the wharf in Boothbay Harbor before noon. The boys had kept a
sharp lookout for the stolen launch, but did not get a glimpse
of it. Beyond the brief message of Mr. Richards they were wholly
in the dark, and since he was absent they did not know whom to
question. They could easily have hired a boat to take them to
Mouse Island, less than two miles away, but the chances were that
when they reached there they would learn that their friend had
gone somewhere else.</p>

<p>While the youths stood debating on the low float, they observed
the <em>Nellie G.</em> coming in. The genial bewhiskered Captain
Williams in the pilot house recognized them and waved his hand.
Then for a few minutes he was busy making fast and seeing that
his passengers landed safely. Everybody knows and likes the captain,
and as soon as he was at leisure the boys stepped up to him and
shook hands warmly.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've got your boat back," he remarked, when they
had talked for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"We heard that it had been found," said Alvin, "but we haven't
seen it since it was stolen yesterday. Have you?"</p>

<p>"I saw it yesterday afternoon when I was over at Squirrel Island."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the astonished Alvin.</p>

<p>"Why, I talked with the wild Irishman who had it in charge."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Mike Murphy?"</p>

<p>"I'm not certain of his last name, but they call him Mike, and
he is redheaded, with the most freckled face I ever saw."</p>

<p>"That's our Mike!" exclaimed the delighted Chester. "Tell us
about it."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell," replied Captain Williams. "I had
just backed out to make room for a steamer, when I saw the <em>Deerfoot</em>
going by and headed north. That Irish lad was at the steering
wheel and was grinning so hard that the corners of his mouth touched
his ears. Not seeing either of you, I asked him where you were.
He said he had left you behind, and if I met you before he did
I was to say he had slipped off on a little trip to the 'owld
counthry.'"</p>

<p>"That identifies him as much as his looks. Did you see anything
more of him?"</p>

<p>"I had to give attention to the <em>Nellie</em>, but I caught
sight of him as he started round the upper end of Squirrel and
turned to the eastward. That's the course he would follow," added
Captain Williams, with a smile, "if he meant to take the voyage
he spoke of."</p>

<p>For the first time since hearing the good news, each of the youths
felt misgiving. While it was impossible that Mike Murphy had any
intention of going far out, he did not need to proceed many miles
to run into alarming danger. His knowledge of motor boats was
so limited that the slightest difficulty with the engine would
render him helpless. He had done an exceedingly rash thing, though
in truth no more than was to be expected of him. A full night
had passed since he was met by Captain Williams, who in answer
to the anxious question of Alvin repeated that he had not seen
or heard of the <em>Deerfoot</em> since late on the preceding
afternoon. With his usual shrewdness, he added:</p>

<p>"If you want my advice it is that you hire a launch and start
after that boat of yours and don't throw away any time in doing
so."</p>

<p>"Your advice is good," said Alvin gratefully, "and shall be followed."</p>

<p>Bidding good day to their friend, they set out to hire a launch&mdash;an
easy thing to do during the summer season at Boothbay, when boatmen
reap their harvest. The boys found exactly what they wanted in
the shape of a 28-foot runabout, forty horse power, four-cylinder
gasoline engine, with a guaranteed speed of twenty miles an hour.
It belonged to a wealthy visitor, who having been suddenly called
to New York on business, gave his man permission to pick up an
honest penny or two by means of the pleasure boat left behind.
Although such craft are easily provided with an automobile type
of canopy as a protection against the weather, there was none
on the <em>Shark</em>. But there was a plate glass wind-shield
forward, which shut out the flying spray when the boat was going
at high speed. The seats were athwartship and would accommodate
four persons at a pinch and were tastefully upholstered in leather.</p>

<p>The young man who had charge of the <em>Shark</em> was glum and
reserved, but inasmuch as Alvin promptly agreed to his somewhat
exorbitant terms, he was anxious to oblige. Alvin thought it best
to explain the situation before they started.</p>

<p>"George" listened silently until the story was finished, when
he nodded his head:</p>

<p>"I know the <em>Deerfoot</em>; ain't a finer craft in these waters.
Wish I owned her."</p>

<p>"When did you see her last?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Just off Southport. The Irish bonehead was talking with his
father, as I suppose it was, while going past without stopping."</p>

<p>This was interesting information. George was asked to go first
to the shore of that island, as near as he could get to the home
of Alvin and that of the caretaker, Pat Murphy, the father of
Mike. The run was about five miles past Mouse, Burnt, Capitol
and opposite the lower end of Squirrel Island. Just to show what
the <em>Shark</em> could do she covered the distance in eighteen
minutes.</p>

<p>The faint hope that the <em>Deerfoot</em> would be found at the
small landing constructed for her did not last long, for she would
have been in sight almost from the first, and nothing was to be
seen of her. Pat Murphy was not visible, but a few tootings of
the compressed air whistle brought him from his house, where he
was eating his midday meal.</p>

<p>So great was his haste indeed that he left his hat behind. While
he was hurrying to the rocks, his wife opened the door and stood
apparently motionless to hear what passed.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pat!" called Alvin. "Do you know where Mike is?"</p>

<p>"Bedad! it's mesilf that wish I did!" called back the angry parent.
"Didn't he sail by here yester afternoon, his chist sticking out
and himsilf putting on airs and pretending he didn't understand
what I said whin I towld him to come ashore?"</p>

<p>"He ought to be ashamed of himself, but you mustn't feel too
bitter toward him; it was the first time he had a chance to handle
our boat."</p>

<p>"And how the dooce did he git that same chance? What were ye
thinking of, Alvin, to let such a blunderhead manage yer craft?
Aye, he's a blunderhead and the son of a bigger one."</p>

<p>"No one will deny what ye last said," remarked the wife in the
door. Even the glum George smiled at the man who did not catch
the full meaning of his own words.</p>

<p>"Wait till the spalpeen coomes home," added Pat, with a shake
of his head, "and I'll squar' things wid him."</p>

<p>"You have seen nothing of him to-day?"</p>

<p>"I haven't saan a smell&mdash;bad cess to him!"</p>

<p>"Well, we hope to bring him home very soon."</p>

<p>"It's mesilf that is hoping ye'll soon do it."</p>

<p>Alvin gave the word to George, who set the engine going and headed
to the northeast. "I wish I could find some one who met Mike and
the <em>Deerfoot</em> after his father and Captain Williams saw
her."</p>

<p>"I did," calmly spoke the boatman.</p>

<p>"You!" exclaimed the amazed Alvin; "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I saw him just as it was growing dark."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"A gentleman and lady took the walk yesterday afternoon from
Boothbay over the Indian Trail to Spruce Point, where I met them
late in the afternoon. Then the water being very calm, I went
round to Ocean Point at the end of Linekin Neck, where they went
ashore for a half hour or so. I stayed in my boat waiting for
them, when I happened to look south toward Ram Island, expecting
the light to show pretty soon. While I was staring I caught sight
of your boat, the <em>Deerfoot</em>, heading out to sea."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you weren't mistaken?" asked Chester. "Couldn't
it have been some other boat that resembles her?"</p>

<p>"I might have thought so if I hadn't used my glasses&mdash;them that
are lying on the seat alongside of you. When I took a good look
through them, everything was as plain as the nose on your face."</p>

<p>"Did you notice the one at the wheel?"</p>

<p>"So plain there couldn't be any mistake about it. It was that
redheaded Irish chap that you've been talking about."</p>

<p>"And he was alone?"</p>

<p>"If there was anyone with him he kept out of sight."</p>

<p>"Did you watch the <em>Deerfoot</em> after that?"</p>

<p>"For only a few minutes; my folks soon came back, not staying
as long as they intended, but when they stepped aboard I cast
one more look out to sea. It was so dark by that time that I could
just see the boat fading from sight. She was still headed straight
to the eastward, as if the fool really meant to try to cross the
Atlantic. I should have used the glasses again, but I was too
busy attending to my boat. As I circled about to start for home,
Ram Island light flashed out, so you can know the day was pretty
well gone."</p>

<p>"And you have seen nothing of the <em>Deerfoot</em> since?" asked
Alvin, with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>"No; I don't believe anyone else has; and," added George, dropping
his voice, "I don't believe you will ever see Mike Murphy again!"</p>
