"Have you made up your mind who you're going to have
to the wedding, Anne?" asked Mrs. Rachel Lynde, as she
hemstitched table napkins industriously.  "It's time
your invitations were sent, even if they are to be only
informal ones."
<P>
"I don't mean to have very many," said Anne.  "We just
want those we love best to see us married.  Gilbert's
people, and Mr. and Mrs. Allan, and Mr. and Mrs.
Harrison."
<P>
"There was a time when you'd hardly have numbered Mr.
Harrison among your dearest friends," said Marilla
drily.
<P>
"Well, I wasn't VERY strongly attracted to him at our
first meeting," acknowledged Anne, with a laugh over
the recollection.  "But Mr. Harrison has improved on
acquaintance, and Mrs. Harrison is really a dear. 
Then, of course, there are Miss Lavendar and Paul."
<P>
"Have they decided to come to the Island this summer? 
I thought they were going to Europe."
<P>
"They changed their minds when I wrote them I was
going to be married.  I had a letter from Paul today. 
He says he MUST come to my wedding, no matter what
happens to Europe."
<P>
"That child always idolised you," remarked Mrs.
Rachel.
<P>
"That `child' is a young man of nineteen now, Mrs.
Lynde."
<P>
"How time does fly!" was Mrs. Lynde's brilliant and
original response.
<P>
"Charlotta the Fourth may come with them.  She sent
word by Paul that she would come if her husband would
let her.  I wonder if she still wears those enormous
blue bows, and whether her husband calls her Charlotta
or Leonora.  I should love to have Charlotta at my
wedding.  Charlotta and I were at a wedding long syne. 
They expect to be at Echo Lodge next week.  Then there
are Phil and the Reverend Jo----"
<P>
"It sounds awful to hear you speaking of a minister
like that, Anne," said Mrs. Rachel severely.
<P>
"His wife calls him that."
<P>
"She should have more respect for his holy office,
then," retorted Mrs. Rachel.
<P>
"I've heard you criticise ministers pretty sharply
yourself," teased Anne.
<P>
"Yes, but I do it reverently," protested Mrs. Lynde. 
"You never heard me NICKNAME a minister."
<P>
Anne smothered a smile.
<P>
"Well, there are Diana and Fred and little Fred and
Small Anne Cordelia--and Jane Andrews.  I wish I could
have Miss Stacey and Aunt Jamesina and Priscilla and
Stella.  But Stella is in Vancouver, and Pris is in
Japan, and Miss Stacey is married in California, and
Aunt Jamesina has gone to India to explore her
daughter's mission field, in spite of her horror of
snakes.  It's really dreadful--the way people get
scattered over the globe."
<P>
"The Lord never intended it, that's what," said Mrs.
Rachel authoritatively.  "In my young days people grew
up and married and settled down where they were born,
or pretty near it.  Thank goodness you've stuck to the
Island, Anne.  I was afraid Gilbert would insist on
rushing off to the ends of the earth when he got
through college, and dragging you with him."
<P>
"If everybody stayed where he was born places would
soon be filled up, Mrs. Lynde."
<P>
"Oh, I'm not going to argue with you, Anne.  _I_ am
not a B.A.  What time of the day is the ceremony to
be?"
<P>
"We have decided on noon--high noon, as the society
reporters say.  That will give us time to catch the
evening train to Glen St. Mary."
<P>
"And you'll be married in the parlor?"
<P>
"No--not unless it rains.  We mean to be married in
the orchard-- with the blue sky over us and the
sunshine around us.  Do you know when and where I'd
like to be married, if I could?  It would be at dawn--a
June dawn, with a glorious sunrise, and roses blooming
in the gardens; and I would slip down and meet Gilbert
and we would go together to the heart of the beech
woods,--and there, under the green arches that would be
like a splendid cathedral, we would be married."
<P>
Marilla sniffed scornfully and Mrs. Lynde looked
shocked.
<P>
"But that would be terrible queer, Anne.  Why, it
wouldn't really seem legal.  And what would Mrs. Harmon
Andrews say?"
<P>
"Ah, there's the rub," sighed Anne.  "There are so
many things in life we cannot do because of the fear of
what Mrs. Harmon Andrews would say.  ` 'Tis true, 'tis
pity, and pity 'tis, 'tis true.'  What delightful
things we might do were it not for Mrs. Harmon
Andrews!"
<P>
"By times, Anne, I don't feel quite sure that I
understand you altogether," complained Mrs. Lynde.
<P>
"Anne was always romantic, you know," said Marilla
apologetically.
<P>
"Well, married life will most likely cure her of
that," Mrs. Rachel responded comfortingly.
<P>
Anne laughed and slipped away to Lover's Lane, where
Gilbert found her; and neither of them seemed to
entertain much fear, or hope, that their married life
would cure them of romance.
<P>
The Echo Lodge people came over the next week, and
Green Gables buzzed with the delight of them.  Miss
Lavendar had changed so little that the three years
since her last Island visit might have been a watch in
the night; but Anne gasped with amazement over Paul. 
Could this splendid six feet of manhood be the little
Paul of Avonlea schooldays?
<P>
"You really make me feel old, Paul," said Anne.  "Why,
I have to look up to you!"
<P>
"You'll never grow old, Teacher," said Paul.  "You are
one of the fortunate mortals who have found and drunk
from the Fountain of Youth,--you and Mother Lavendar. 
See here!  When you're married I WON'T call you Mrs.
Blythe.  To me you'll always be `Teacher'--the teacher
of the best lessons I ever learned.  I want to show you
something."
<P>
The "something" was a pocketbook full of poems.  Paul
had put some of his beautiful fancies into verse, and
magazine editors had not been as unappreciative as they
are sometimes supposed to be.  Anne read Paul's poems
with real delight.  They were full of charm and
promise.
<P>
"You'll be famous yet, Paul.  I always dreamed of
having one famous pupil.  He was to be a college
president--but a great poet would be even better.  Some
day I'll be able to boast that I whipped the
distinguished Paul Irving.  But then I never did whip
you, did I, Paul?  What an opportunity lost!  I think I
kept you in at recess, however."
<P>
"You may be famous yourself, Teacher.  I've seen a
good deal of your work these last three years."
<P>
"No.  I know what I can do.  I can write pretty,
fanciful little sketches that children love and editors
send welcome cheques for.  But I can do nothing big. 
My only chance for earthly immortality is a corner in
your Memoirs."
<P>
Charlotta the Fourth had discarded the blue bows but
her freckles were not noticeably less.
<P>
"I never did think I'd come down to marrying a Yankee,
Miss Shirley, ma'am," she said.  "But you never know
what's before you, and it isn't his fault.  He was born
that way."
<P>
"You're a Yankee yourself, Charlotta, since you've
married one."
<P>
"Miss Shirley, ma'am, I'm NOT!  And I wouldn't be if I
was to marry a dozen Yankees!  Tom's kind of nice.  And
besides, I thought I'd better not be too hard to
please, for I mightn't get another chance.  Tom don't
drink and he don't growl because he has to work between
meals, and when all's said and done I'm satisfied, Miss
Shirley, ma'am."
<P>
"Does he call you Leonora?" asked Anne.
<P>
"Goodness, no, Miss Shirley, ma'am.  I wouldn't know
who he meant if he did.  Of course, when we got married
he had to say, `I take thee, Leonora,' and I declare to
you, Miss Shirley, ma'am, I've had the most dreadful
feeling ever since that it wasn't me he was talking to
and I haven't been rightly married at all.  And so
you're going to be married yourself, Miss Shirley,
ma'am?  I always thought I'd like to marry a doctor. 
It would be so handy when the children had measles and
croup.  Tom is only a bricklayer, but he's real good-
tempered.  When I said to him, says I, `Tom, can I go
to Miss Shirley's wedding?  I mean to go anyhow, but
I'd like to have your consent,' he just says, `Suit
yourself, Charlotta, and you'll suit me.'  That's a
real pleasant kind of husband to have, Miss Shirley,
ma'am."
<P>
Philippa and her Reverend Jo arrived at Green Gables
the day before the wedding.  Anne and Phil had a
rapturous meeting which presently simmered down to a
cosy, confidential chat over all that had been and was
about to be.
<P>
"Queen Anne, you're as queenly as ever.  I've got
fearfully thin since the babies came.  I'm not half so
good-looking; but I think Jo likes it.  There's not
such a contrast between us, you see.  And oh, it's
perfectly magnificent that you're going to marry
Gilbert.  Roy Gardner wouldn't have done at all, at
all.  I can see that now, though I was horribly
disappointed at the time.  You know, Anne, you did
treat Roy very badly."
<P>
"He has recovered, I understand," smiled Anne.
<P>
"Oh, yes.  He is married and his wife is a sweet
little thing and they're perfectly happy.  Everything
works together for good.  Jo and the Bible say that,
and they are pretty good authorities."
<P>
"Are Alec and Alonzo married yet?"
<P>
"Alec is, but Alonzo isn't.  How those dear old days
at Patty's Place come back when I'm talking to you,
Anne!  What fun we had!"
<P>
"Have you been to Patty's Place lately?"
<P>
"Oh, yes, I go often.  Miss Patty and Miss Maria still
sit by the fireplace and knit.  And that reminds
me--we've brought you a wedding gift from them, Anne. 
Guess what it is."
<P>
"I never could.  How did they know I was going to be
married?"
<P>
"Oh, I told them.  I was there last week.  And they
were so interested.  Two days ago Miss Patty wrote me a
note asking me to call; and then she asked if I would
take her gift to you.  What would you wish most from
Patty's Place, Anne?"
<P>
"You can't mean that Miss Patty has sent me her china
dogs?"
<P>
"Go up head.  They're in my trunk this very moment. 
And I've a letter for you.  Wait a moment and I'll get
it."
<P>
"Dear Miss Shirley," Miss Patty had written, "Maria
and I were very much interested in hearing of your
approaching nuptials.  We send you our best wishes. 
Maria and I have never married, but we have no
objection to other people doing so.  We are sending you
the china dogs.  I intended to leave them to you in my
will, because you seemed to have sincere affection for
them.  But Maria and I expect to live a good while yet
(D.V.), so I have decided to give you the dogs while
you are young.  You will not have forgotten that Gog
looks to the right and Magog to the left."
<P>
"Just fancy those lovely old dogs sitting by the
fireplace in my house of dreams," said Anne
rapturously.  "I never expected anything so
delightful."
<P>
That evening Green Gables hummed with preparations for
the following day; but in the twilight Anne slipped
away.  She had a little pilgrimage to make on this last
day of her girlhood and she must make it alone.  She
went to Matthew's grave, in the little poplar-shaded
Avonlea graveyard, and there kept a silent tryst with
old memories and immortal loves.
<P>
"How glad Matthew would be tomorrow if he were here,"
she whispered.  "But I believe he does know and is
glad of it-- somewhere else.  I've read somewhere that
`our dead are never dead until we have forgotten them.' 
Matthew will never be dead to me, for I can never
forget him."
<P>
She left on his grave the flowers she had brought and
walked slowly down the long hill.  It was a gracious
evening, full of delectable lights and shadows.  In the
west was a sky of mackerel clouds-- crimson and
amber-tinted, with long strips of apple-green sky
between.  Beyond was the glimmering radiance of a
sunset sea, and the ceaseless voice of many waters came
up from the tawny shore.  All around her, lying in the
fine, beautiful country silence, were the hills and
fields and woods she had known and loved so long.
<P>
"History repeats itself," said Gilbert, joining her as
she passed the Blythe gate.  "Do you remember our
first walk down this hill, Anne--our first walk
together anywhere, for that matter?"
<P>
"I was coming home in the twilight from Matthew's
grave--and you came out of the gate; and I swallowed
the pride of years and spoke to you."
<P>
"And all heaven opened before me," supplemented
Gilbert.  "From that moment I looked forward to
tomorrow.  When I left you at your gate that night and
walked home I was the happiest boy in the world.  Anne
had forgiven me."
<P>
"I think you had the most to forgive.  I was an
ungrateful little wretch--and after you had really
saved my life that day on the pond, too.  How I loathed
that load of obligation at first!  I don't deserve the
happiness that has come to me."
<P>
Gilbert laughed and clasped tighter the girlish hand
that wore his ring.  Anne's engagement ring was a
circlet of pearls.  She had refused to wear a diamond.
<P>
"I've never really liked diamonds since I found out
they weren't the lovely purple I had dreamed.  They
will always suggest my old disappointment ."
<P>
"But pearls are for tears, the old legend says,"
Gilbert had objected.
<P>
"I'm not afraid of that.  And tears can be happy as
well as sad.  My very happiest moments have been when I
had tears in my eyes-- when Marilla told me I might
stay at Green Gables--when Matthew gave me the first
pretty dress I ever had--when I heard that you were
going to recover from the fever.  So give me pearls for
our troth ring, Gilbert, and I'll willingly accept the
sorrow of life with its joy."
<P>
But tonight our lovers thought only of joy and never of
sorrow.  For the morrow was their wedding day, and
their house of dreams awaited them on the misty, purple
shore of Four Winds Harbor.
