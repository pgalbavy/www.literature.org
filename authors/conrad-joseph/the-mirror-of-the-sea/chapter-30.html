<p> <em>THE </em>estuaries of rivers appeal strongly to an adventurous
imagination. This appeal is not always a charm, for there are
estuaries of a particularly dispiriting ugliness: lowlands, mud-flats,
or perhaps barren sandhills without beauty of form or amenity
of aspect, covered with a shabby and scanty vegetation conveying
the impression of poverty and uselessness.  Sometimes such an
ugliness is merely a repulsive mask.  A river whose estuary resembles
a breach in a sand rampart may flow through a most fertile country. 
But all the estuaries of great rivers have their fascination,
the attractiveness of an open portal.  Water is friendly to man. 
The ocean, a part of Nature furthest removed in the unchangeableness
and majesty of its might from the spirit of mankind, has ever
been a friend to the enterprising nations of the earth.  And of
all the elements this is the one to which men have always been
prone to trust themselves, as if its immensity held a reward as
vast as itself.</p>

<p>From the offing the open estuary promises every possible fruition
to adventurous hopes.  That road open to enterprise and courage
invites the explorer of coasts to new efforts towards the fulfilment
of great expectations.  The commander of the first Roman galley
must have looked with an intense absorption upon the estuary of
the Thames as he turned the beaked prow of his ship to the westward
under the brow of the North Foreland.  The estuary of the Thames
is not beautiful; it has no noble features, no romantic grandeur
of aspect, no smiling geniality; but it is wide open, spacious,
inviting, hospitable at the first glance, with a strange air of
mysteriousness which lingers about it to this very day. The navigation
of his craft must have engrossed all the Roman’s attention in
the calm of a summer’s day (he would choose his weather), when
the single row of long sweeps (the galley would be a light one,
not a trireme) could fall in easy cadence upon a sheet of water
like plate-glass, reflecting faithfully the classic form of his
vessel and the contour of the lonely shores close on his left
hand.  I assume he followed the land and passed through what is
at present known as Margate Roads, groping his careful way along
the hidden sandbanks, whose every tail and spit has its beacon
or buoy nowadays.  He must have been anxious, though no doubt
he had collected beforehand on the shores of the Gauls a store
of information from the talk of traders, adventurers, fishermen,
slave-dealers, pirates—all sorts of unofficial men connected with
the sea in a more or less reputable way.  He would have heard
of channels and sandbanks, of natural features of the land useful
for sea-marks, of villages and tribes and modes of barter and
precautions to take: with the instructive tales about native chiefs
dyed more or less blue, whose character for greediness, ferocity,
or amiability must have been expounded to him with that capacity
for vivid language which seems joined naturally to the shadiness
of moral character and recklessness of disposition.  With that
sort of spiced food provided for his anxious thought, watchful
for strange men, strange beasts, strange turns of the tide, he
would make the best of his way up, a military seaman with a short
sword on thigh and a bronze helmet on his head, the pioneer post-captain
of an imperial fleet.  Was the tribe inhabiting the Isle of Thanet
of a ferocious disposition, I wonder, and ready to fall with stone-studded
clubs and wooden lances hardened in the fire, upon the backs of
unwary mariners?</p>

<p>Amongst the great commercial streams of these islands, the Thames
is the only one, I think, open to romantic feeling, from the fact
that the sight of human labour and the sounds of human industry
do not come down its shores to the very sea, destroying the suggestion
of mysterious vastness caused by the configuration of the shore. 
The broad inlet of the shallow North Sea passes gradually into
the contracted shape of the river; but for a long time the feeling
of the open water remains with the ship steering to the westward
through one of the lighted and buoyed passage-ways of the Thames,
such as Queen’s Channel, Prince’s Channel, Four-Fathom Channel;
or else coming down the Swin from the north.  The rush of the
yellow flood-tide hurries her up as if into the unknown between
the two fading lines of the coast.  There are no features to this
land, no conspicuous, far-famed landmarks for the eye; there is
nothing so far down to tell you of the greatest agglomeration
of mankind on earth dwelling no more than five and twenty miles
away, where the sun sets in a blaze of colour flaming on a gold
background, and the dark, low shores trend towards each other. 
And in the great silence the deep, faint booming of the big guns
being tested at Shoeburyness hangs about the Nore—a historical
spot in the keeping of one of England’s appointed guardians.</p>
