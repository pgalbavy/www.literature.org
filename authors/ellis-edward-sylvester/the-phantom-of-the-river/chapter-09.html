<p>It would seem that the pioneers had more than enough to occupy
their minds on this eventful journey through the woods, without
coming in contact with such a frightful thing as a rattlesnake,
but here was one of the hardy members of the escort apparently
stricken unto death by the huge reptile that he had just slain.</p>

<p>By the time the poor fellow had collapsed and fallen to the earth,
almost the entire party were gathered around him. That section
of the Union, even in those early days, was not wholly lacking
in whiskey. There may not have been a great deal of it manufactured
in the territory, but those who made their homes in that favored
land did not often suffer for lack of it.</p>

<p>Flasks there were in plenty, but it was noticeable that not one
of the rangers who had come from the fort made haste to bring
forth a supply and place it at the lips of their collapsed companion.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Altman who was quick to kneel beside the man and apply
the vessel to his mouth, as he raised him to a sitting position.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, George," said Agnes, "that Mr. Kenton said
we must meet with some accident that would prevent our reaching
Rattlesnake Gulch until night was fully come?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, that's the accident we have met."</p>

<p>A light flashed upon young Ashbridge. The amused expression on
the faces of the escort was explained. James Deane had not been
harmed by the rattlesnake which he had pounded to death. As is
said, all this was done for effect.</p>

<p>The most real thing about the business was that Jim was procuring
a prodigious supply of excellent whiskey without any expense to
himself, and without any cause existing for such an over-dose.</p>

<p>Seeing the actual danger that threatened their friend, Hastings
touched the shoulder of Mr. Altman, who looked up inquiringly
at him.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't give him any more."</p>

<p>"It will be safer to fill him up with it, so as to counteract
the poison."</p>

<p>"Yesh&mdash;fill him up," added Jim, thickly, reaching out his hand
vaguely for the bottle; "fill him up&mdash;coun'act&mdash;hic&mdash;p'son&mdash;fill
him up so he runs over."</p>

<p>"I think, Tom, he's running over now," suggested Mr. Ashbridge,
who understood matters.</p>

<p>The words and the expressions on the countenances of the others
caused the truth to flash upon the good Samaritan. He rose to
his feet with a disgusted look. Then he shook his glass flask,
and held it up between him and the sunlight.</p>

<p>"If I had suspected, he shouldn't have had a drop; he has drank
enough to make three men drunk."</p>

<p>"And he's as drunk as three men can get," replied Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"Fetch on your rattler&mdash;hic," stuttered Jim, who was about to
add some more remarks when he gave it up and toppled over on the
ground, deferring all such observations to a more convenient season.</p>

<p>It assumed an almost grotesque phase, and sounds incredible when
it is stated that this pretended rattlesnake bite was solely for
the purpose of deceiving the members of the Shawanoe war party
that were swarming through the woods, yet not only was such the
fact, but the scheme, singular as it was, met the approval of
Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton, whose judgment in such matters
all will admit should be accepted as final.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hastings was anxiously consulting with Ashbridge,
Altman, and his own men.</p>

<p>The situation was grave to the last degree, and the crisis could
not be far off.</p>

<p>"We don't need to wait here more'n half an hour," said he, "and
may be not that long; then, when we start, night'll be fully here
afore we reach the gulch."</p>

<p>"And the Indians have been deceived as to our purpose?" was the
inquiring remark of Mr. Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"There's no sartinty of that, but it looks that way."</p>

<p>"But the most alarming feature of this business, as it seems
to me," continued the pioneer, "is this: the time must soon come
when these Shawanoes will learn we do not mean to pass through
that valley of death."</p>

<p>Hastings nodded his head. He had thought of all this, as well
as of the complications that were likely to follow.</p>

<p>"How long after we make our pause will they suspect the truth?"</p>

<p>"Inside of ten minutes; but," added the ranger, "they may think
we've decided to wait till morning afore we pass through."</p>

<p>"Is that probable?" asked young Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"No; there isn't one chance in a thousand that they'll think
anything of the kind, and yet there is that one chance."</p>

<p>Mr. Ashbridge again took up the exchange of views with the leader
of the scouts, the others listening with the closest attention
and interest.</p>

<p>"Suppose the Shawanoes believe we have merely postponed our passage
through the gulch until morning, and that we are certain to attempt
it then&mdash;what will they do?"</p>

<p>"Wait where they are till daylight, or for a week, if they were
sure the thing would be tried; but," was the significant remark
of Hastings, "don't build any hopes on any such idea as that."</p>

<p>"I am sure it would be foolish to do so, but we are getting down
to bed-rock facts now. The Indians must soon learn that we have
no intention of walking into their trap. What they will then do
is not clear to you."</p>

<p>"No; but I don't think they'll make an attack till the night
is purty well nigh gone. They always spend a good deal of time
in figgering and man[oe]uverin' round. It's that time between
the beginning of darkness and sun-up that's got to be used by
us for the benefit of your folks, or it will not be used at all."</p>

<p>"Mr. Kenton seems to have taken wise steps, as he always does
under such circumstances, for the safety of our families. He counts
upon securing that canoe which was left with the flatboat, and
has hope of finding another near the gulch. Suppose he fails in
both instances&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"Only Kenton himself can answer that question; I believe he's
as likely to fail as to win, but he'll soon be on hand; he won't
keep us waiting long. Boone will be purty sure to jine us, and
atween' em they'll do the right thing."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that, but, if you will pardon me, Mr.
Hastings, it seems to me that there is something for us to do.
My solicitude for the dear ones around us, who cannot help themselves,
must excuse my presumption."</p>

<p>"It's no presumption, sir; we are all glad to hear what you have
to say."</p>

<p>"Accidents are liable to occur at any time, even though some
of them are bogus," qualified Ashbridge, with a glance at the
unconscious figure of Jim Deane a few rods away. "Boone and Kenton
have placed themselves in great peril. One of them may be killed;
it is impossible that both will fall. We are fortunate in having
such good friends as you to stand by us, but the wisest man is
he who provides, as far as he can, for every contingency. Suppose
we see nothing of Boone or Kenton again?"</p>

<p>"I can't think such a thing as both of 'em going under at the
same time can happen. One of 'em is sartin to turn up purty soon."</p>

<p>"But Kenton may fail to bring the canoe, upon which so much depends.
Now, to come down to the point, when we halt near the gulch will
our position be such that we can make a good defence against an
attack?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," was the frank reply of the ranger; "we've only
one man with us who knows all about Rattlesnake Gulch, and the
ins and outs of the place."</p>

<p>"Who is that man?"</p>

<p>For reply, Hastings pointed to Jim Deane, sunk in a helpless
stupor.</p>

<p>"Humph!" remarked the pioneer, "he is of no more account than
a dead man, and won't be for some hours to come."</p>
