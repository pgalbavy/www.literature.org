<p>To sneak away is to steal away trying to keep out of sight of
everybody, and is usually done only by those who for some reason
or other are ashamed to be seen. Just as soon as Reddy Fox could
see after Jimmy Skunk had thrown that terrible perfume in Reddy's
face he started for the Green Forest. He wanted to get away by
himself. But he didn't trot with his head up and his big plumey
tail carried proudly as is usual with him. No indeed. Instead
he hung his head, and his handsome tail was dropped between his
legs; he was the very picture of shame. You see that terrible
perfume which Jimmy Skunk had thrown at him clung to his red coat
and he knew that he couldn't get rid of it, not for a long time
anyway. And he knew, too, that wherever he went his neighbors
would hold their noses and make fun of him, and that no one would
have anything to do with him. So he sneaked away across the Green
Meadows towards the Green Forest and he felt too sick and mean
and unhappy to even be angry with Sammy Jay, who was making fun
of him and saying that he had got no more than he deserved.</p>

<p>Poor Reddy! He didn't know what to do or where to go. He couldn't
go home, for old Granny Fox would drive him out of the house.
She had warned him time and again never to provoke Jimmy Skunk,
and he knew that she never would forgive him if he should bring
that terrible perfume near their home. He knew, too, that it would
not be long before all the little people of the Green Forest and
the Green Meadows would know what had happened to him. Sammy Jay
would see to that. He knew just how they would point at him and
make fun of him. He would never hear the last of it. He felt as
if he never, never would be able to hold his head and his tail
up again. Every few minutes he stopped to roll over and over on
the ground trying to get rid of that dreadful perfume.</p>

<p>When he reached the Green Forest he hurried over to the Laughing
Brook to wash out his eyes. It was just his luck to have Billy
Mink come along while he was doing this. Billy didn't need to
be told what had happened. "Phew!" he exclaimed, holding on to
his nose. Then he turned and hurried beyond the reach of that
perfume. There he stopped and made fun of Reddy Fox and said all
the provoking things he could think of. Reddy took no notice at
all. He felt too miserable to quarrel.</p>

<p>After he had washed his face he felt better. Water wouldn't take
away the awful smell, but it did take away the smart from his
eyes. Then he tried to plan what to do next.</p>

<p>"The only thing I can do is to get as far away from everybody
as I can," thought he. "I guess I'll have to go up to the Old
Pasture to live for a while."</p>

<p>So he started for the Old Pasture, keeping as much out of sight
as possible. On the way he remembered that Old Man Coyote lived
there. Of course it would never do to go near Old Man Coyote's
home for if he smelled that awful perfume and discovered that
he, Reddy, was the cause of it he would certainly drive him out
of the Old Pasture and then where could he go? So Reddy went to
the loneliest part of the Old Pasture and crept into an old house
that he and Granny had dug there long ago when they had been forced
to live in the Old Pasture in the days when Farmer Brown's boy
and Bowser the Hound had hunted them for stealing chickens. There
he stretched himself out and was perfectly miserable.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be so bad if I had really been to blame, but I wasn't.
I didn't know Jimmy Skunk was in that barrel and I didn't mean
to start it rolling down the hill anyway," he muttered. "It was
all an accident and&mdash;" He stopped and into his yellow eyes crept
a look of suspicion. "I wonder," said he slowly, "if Peter Rabbit
knew that Jimmy Skunk was there and planned to get me into all
this trouble. I wonder."</p>
