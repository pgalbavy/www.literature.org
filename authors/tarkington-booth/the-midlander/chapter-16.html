<p><em>HIS </em>attitude had not changed, fifteen minutes later,
when there came a light tapping upon that mishandled door of his;
and at the sound he rose quickly, said, "Yes, mother," and tried
to regain his usual cheerfulness of aspect as Mrs. Oliphant came
in noiselessly. She was smiling, and he was able to construct
a smile in return, telling her she looked "mighty pretty" in her
rose-coloured negligee—a compliment not exaggerated. Serenity,
a good faith, and a cheerful disposition bring beauty in time
even where it has not been; and, where beauty has always been,
as it had with Mrs. Oliphant, white hair is only that crowning
prettiness so knowingly sought by the ladies of the eighteenth-century
when they powdered their blonde or brunette ringlets.</p>

<p>"I just thought I’d slip in for a minute," she said apologetically.
"I was afraid you might forget you had to be up so early to-morrow
morning, and get to thinking about something and not go to bed
at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; don’t worry. I’ll not do that again," he said. "It doesn’t
do any good, I know. I suppose you heard her?"</p>

<p>She patted his cheek, smiling up at him and resolutely withholding
from expression the compassion that had brought her to him. "I
just wanted to tell you not to be troubled. You’ll have to give
her a little more time to get adjusted, Dan. A great many young
couples don’t manage all these little adjustments until after
the first few years of marriage; and I think my own father and
mother didn’t manage it even that soon;—I’m afraid I remember
their having some rather troubled times when I was a pretty old
little girl. You mustn’t let yourself be discouraged, dear. Lena
really tries to get the best of herself, and though she fails
sometimes——"</p>

<p>"It isn’t that," he interrupted. "At least it seemed to be something
more definite than usual this time. You see, I didn’t stop to
think about consulting her, and asked Martha to be Henry Daniel’s
godmother."</p>

<p>"I heard Fred Oliphant say so, but I thought perhaps he was only
trying to tease Lena." For a moment Mrs. Oliphant looked disturbed,
but brightened with a quickly reassuring second thought. "Well,
that would be lovely, and I’m glad you did it; but Martha’ll decline."</p>

<p>"She didn’t, though, when I asked her."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>Dan rubbed his forehead. "Well, I don’t remember that she said
anything."</p>

<p>"No?" His mother laughed. "You won’t have to withdraw your invitation,
if that’s what’s troubling you, Dan."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> troubling me," he admitted despondently. "I just
couldn’t go over there and tell her——"</p>

<p>"No," Mrs. Oliphant said. "And Martha’d never let you."</p>

<p>"You mean <em>you’d</em> tell her——"</p>

<p>"No. Nobody’ll say a word to her about it. Don’t you know Martha
well enough yet to understand that she won’t expect to be Henry’s
godmother?"</p>

<p>"But she must."</p>

<p>"No. If she did, she’d have spoken of it to me."</p>

<p>"That does look like it a little," he said with some relief;
then frowned again. "But I <em>want</em> her to be the godmother;
and she <em>ought</em> to be. Lena hasn’t any great friend of
her own that she wants for it; and Martha’s the best friend I
ever——"</p>

<p>"No, no," his mother interrupted hurriedly. "It wouldn’t do,
Dan."</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Well——" she hesitated, sighed, and went on: "We all love Martha—except
Lena. I’m afraid that’s reason enough. You must give it up."</p>

<p>"I’m afraid so," he agreed gloomily. "Oh, lordy!"</p>

<p>"Now, now! Martha knows you wanted her, and that’s all she’ll
care about. She——" Mrs. Oliphant paused with the bothered air
of one who fears to elaborate an indiscretion already committed.
Then she continued nervously: "There was something else I wanted
to speak to you about. Your father and I—we’ve been a little afraid——"
She hesitated again.</p>

<p>"Afraid of what, mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, we were talking over this long struggle of yours to make
a success of the Addition, Dan; and of course we’ve seen how hard
you’ve been pressed from the very first, and yet you’ve always
kept the thing a little alive and held on to it when time after
time everybody said you’d just have to let go."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, it seems your father heard downtown to-day that <em>this</em>
time you’d—you’d——"</p>

<p>"This time I’d what, mother?"</p>

<p>She put her arms about him and, in spite of her resolution, the
compassion she felt for him was evident in her voice and in her
eyes. "Oh, Dan, if this time you can’t hold on to it any longer,
you mustn’t feel too badly, please!"</p>

<p>He had bent over her as she embraced him; but now he threw back
his shoulders and laughed. "So that’s what father heard to-day,"
he said. "You tell him he was listening to the wrong crowd, mother!"
He moved her gently toward the door, his arm about her. "You go
to bed, and so will I." He laughed again, not grimly or bitterly,
but with deep and hearty mirth. "Why, there isn’t any more chance
of my not keepin’ hold of Ornaby than there is of this house fallin’
off the earth onto the moon! They can’t foreclose on me for anyhow
two weeks more, and by that time I’ll show ’em what’s what! I
sold a lot only last month, and there’ve been three more men out
there already to look at locations. Two weeks is plenty of time
for things to happen, mother. Don’t you worry."</p>

<p>He kissed her good-night, and as she smiled back at him from
the hall and told him she wouldn’t worry if he’d get some sleep,
he went on: "Why, they haven’t any more chance to get Ornaby away
from me than they have to—than they have to"—he paused, searching
for a sufficient comparison, and, finding it, finished with cheery
explosiveness—"than they have to get Henry Daniel Oliphant himself
away from me!"</p>

<p>Upon this she went to her own door down the hall, where she nodded
and whispered back to him a smiling good-night, and disappeared,
glad to see him so abundantly recovered from his brief depression.
"Somehow I believe he <em>will</em> manage to keep on going, even
this time," she told her husband. "He’s so sure failure’s an absolute
impossibility that I do think maybe——"</p>

<p>"No, I don’t see even a ‘maybe’ in it for him," Mr. Oliphant
said, and shook his head. "Not <em>this</em> time, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>But the Earl of Ornaby was in the field by sunrise the next morning,
and armoured in convictions so strong that he began the day with
plans, not for the retention of the threatened domain, but for
an extension of it; he went to see a farmer who owned sixty acres
north of Ornaby and got an option on them before keeping his appointment
with a contractor to select a site for the airily projected automobile
factory.</p>

<p>Not until the afternoon did he go downtown to see about raising
a little money on a note to fend off the impending foreclosure;
and he was still undiscouraged when he came home that evening
without having succeeded. There were thirteen long days left,
he told his mother, in the hall near the front door, where she
met him when he came in; and she responded sunnily that thirteen
was a lucky number, then gave him a note of a kind different from
the one he had spent the afternoon trying to negotiate.</p>

<p>"You see I was right," she said. "Didn’t I tell you she’d understand?
Their housemaid brought it in this morning after breakfast."</p>

<p>Martha had written to Mrs. Oliphant:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
We’re in such a rush of packing I won’t have time to come in and<br/>
say good-bye, as I’d like to. Papa has to go to New York, and<br/>
I’ve decided I ought to go with him, because there are so many<br/>
automobiles there now, and he hasn’t learned that they’re<br/>
getting even worse than the bicycle "speeders" about running<br/>
over people.

</p>
<p>
We’ll be there two or three weeks and I’ve almost persuaded him<br/>
to let me show him Quebec and the Saguenay—and he says he<br/>
<em>might</em> be willing to take the boat from Montreal for a little<br/>
run to England after that!

</p>
<p>
Please give my love to Mr. Oliphant and Harlan for me, and of<br/>
course to Dan, whom I haven’t seen since his great evening after<br/>
the baby was born. He was so funny and delightful, and he talked<br/>
with such really true wisdom, too! I wanted to remember<br/>
everything he said, but the trouble was that he talked so fast<br/>
and said so much that the next day I couldn’t remember any of it<br/>
at all!

</p>
<p>
Please say good-bye for us to Mrs. Savage. Tell her when we get<br/>
home we expect to find her downstairs again and enjoying the<br/>
view from that big window of hers where she’s always loved to<br/>
sit. Tell her papa wants to come with me to see her. He wants to<br/>
talk with her about the old days when this was a little town.<br/>
There aren’t so many left now he can do that with, though I know<br/>
Mrs. Savage regards him as a mere youth, comparatively! He asks<br/>
me to say good-bye to Mr. Oliphant and all of you for him—and<br/>
for myself I close with good-bye to <em>you</em> and send you my best<br/>
love, always.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Lordy!" Dan said, staring at this missive when he had finished
reading it. "She <em>is</em> goin’ to be gone a long while! I
don’t get to see her often, but it’s always mighty satisfactory
to know she’s <em>there</em>—just next door. That house’ll look
pretty empty for a while, won’t it?" He sighed. "Well, I suppose
I’d better go and let Lena know there’s nothin’ to disturb her
now about the christening."</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant told him lightly that she had already informed
her daughter-in-law of Martha’s departure, and that it would be
better for him not to mention the subject again;—Lena had selected
his aunt Olive as a proper godmother. Dan looked rueful, but muttered
an unenthusiastic consent and went into the library to consult
his father upon the best way to raise money in thirteen days.</p>

<p>Mr. Oliphant was unable to offer him either the money itself
or practical advice how to get it. "I’m afraid it looks like pretty
hard luck this time, Dan, old fellow," he said. "It’s funny a
man with as good a practice as mine can’t ever seem to be able
to lay his hands on a little cash that doesn’t have to go right
out on some old debt. If I just didn’t have to meet that confounded
note I went on for poor old Tom Vertrees I——"</p>

<p>"No, no," his son protested;—"I wouldn’t let you, if you could.
My conscience’d trouble me about what I <em>did</em> let you do
for me if I wasn’t so sure you’ll get paid back with seven per
cent. interest as soon as I begin to get these lots to sellin’
off a little faster."</p>

<p>"What about the three men your mother tells me have been out
there looking at lots since you sold the first one? Couldn’t you
offer them a reduction in the price for a little cash in hand?"</p>

<p>"I did," Dan replied. "I did that the first thing with each of
’em. But one of ’em told a darkey I’ve got workin’ out there he
thought he could get what he wanted still cheaper after the mortgage
is foreclosed; and I guess maybe the other two thought the same
way about it. I guess that’s the way those seven people felt that
came when I tried to auction off some lots awhile back."</p>

<p>"I’m afraid so. I hope you aren’t going to take it too hard,
Dan."</p>

<p>"Take what too hard, sir?"</p>

<p>"There are other things you can go into, my boy. You’ve shown
you’ve got immense energy and perseverance. They may laugh at
you, but you can be sure they like the grit you’ve shown, and
if you <em>do</em> have to give up the idea——"</p>

<p>"What idea, sir?"</p>

<p>"I mean the idea of this Addition," his father explained. "If
the time’s come when you have to let it go——"</p>

<p>"Ornaby?" Dan interrupted with an incredulity wholly untouched
by the facts confronting him. "Why, you just put any such notion
out of your mind, sir." And he repeated the extreme comparison
he had made the night before. "Why, I’m not goin’ to let Ornaby
go any more than I am our little namesake upstairs in his cradle!
I’m goin’ to keep it this time and every time! I’ve got thirteen
days left and I’ll find <em>some</em> way!"</p>

<p>He kept Ornaby "this time," but in spite of his determined prophecy
and all he did to fulfil it, six of his thirteen days passed and
he had not found the way. Indeed, he did not find the way at all;
for it was found through none of his seeking. On the seventh of
the thirteen days his grandmother sent for him to come to talk
to her in the evening; and when he sat down beside her and for
a moment covered the ghostly hand on the coverlet with his own,
he told her truthfully that she was looking better.</p>

<p>"Why, a great <em>deal</em> better!" he said. "I guess you’re
goin’ to do what Martha said in her message, grandma, and get
downstairs again before she comes home."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" she said in a voice a little stronger than
it was when he had last talked with her. "You think I might fool
that doctor after all?"</p>

<p>"But doesn’t he say you’re better, grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, and smiled faintly. "But he doesn’t think so.
Told me this morning I was better and then came three times during
the day! <em>He</em> doesn’t fool anybody."</p>

<p>"But you’re goin’ to get well," her grandson assured her. "What
I want to know is: When are you goin’ to let me bring that baby
to see you? Mother says you don’t——"</p>

<p>"No, no," she interrupted peevishly. "I don’t want to see any
babies."</p>

<p>"But, grandma, you’ve never seen any baby like——"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"But you don’t understand what a baby can be <em>like</em>,"
he persisted. "I don’t know I ever thought much of babies generally,
either; but I’ve found out there’s just as much difference between
’em as there is between people. Think of this, for instance: one
day I was bendin’ down over him, just lookin’ at him—and this
was before he was even four weeks old, remember—and all at once
he took the notion I must be kind of funny. He broke right out
in a laugh! He did! It was a real laugh, too, though a good many
people might think I imagined it; because I’ve asked everybody
I know, pretty near, and not one of ’em said they ever heard of
a baby only four weeks old that could——"</p>

<p>"Stop!" she protested. "I didn’t send for you to talk about your
baby."</p>

<p>"But, grandma, if you’d just let me bring him to see you——"</p>

<p>"I don’t want to hear anything about him, and I’ve only got one
thing to say about him myself. You better not let him listen to
his mother when he learns to talk, or to Harlan either—not if
you want to save him from that affected Eastern way of talking.
You’ve had enough to do with Eastern people, young man! You take
care of yourself and have as little to do with ’em after this
as you can manage. They may seem mighty fine and highty-tighty,
and let you think it’s a great thing to be <em>in</em> with ’em,
but all they’re after is to get something out of you; and after
they’ve got it, they’ll give you the go-by quick enough! Now I
haven’t got strength enough to talk very long, and I don’t want
to talk any more about your baby."</p>

<p>"All right," he said submissively. "What do you want to talk
about, grandma?"</p>

<p>She turned her head on the pillow to look at him; and it seemed
to him that her eyes were vague, as if they found him indistinct;—she
frowned plaintively in an effort to see him more clearly, and
was silent for a time.</p>

<p>"It’s Dan, is it?" she said finally.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, grandma," he answered in surprise. "We’ve just been
talkin’ about the baby, grandma; and how much better you are and
everything."</p>

<p>"I know," she returned with a feeble petulance. "I know what
we’re talking about. I wanted you to come to-night because I want
to tell you something."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandma?"</p>

<p>"It’s this," she said; then closed her eyes, and when she opened
them, asked again: "Is it Dan?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, of course, grandma! You just said——"</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> know what I said! I wanted to tell you—to tell you——"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandma," he said, and added indulgently, "Tell me anything
you like to."</p>

<p>"I wanted to tell you not to mind," she went on. "You mustn’t
mind anything that happens. I mean anything I have to do with."</p>

<p>"No; of course," he returned without any idea of what she might
mean. "Of course I won’t. I won’t mind it."</p>

<p>"You must be <em>sure</em> not to," she insisted. "You won’t
understand, but you mustn’t let it make you feel hurt with me.
You mustn’t——"</p>

<p>"Of course I won’t. Why, I’d never dream of feelin’ hurt with
you about anything in the world, grandma."</p>

<p>"Listen, Dan. I’ve always liked you best since you were a little
boy. If you don’t understand something that happens, you remember
I said this, will you? What may happen is for your own good and
to help you, though it may seem just the other way to you. Will
you promise to remember?"</p>

<p>"Of course," he returned promptly; but she was not satisfied.</p>

<p>"No; I want you to think what you’re saying. You speak too quickly
to make me sure you’ll remember. Say it slower, Dan. Say, ‘I promise
to remember.’"</p>

<p>"I promise to remember," he repeated slowly, to indulge this
whim of hers; and then asked, "To remember what, grandma?"</p>

<p>"What I’ve just told you. That’s all I have to say, Dan."</p>

<p>"All right, grandma;—I hope I haven’t stayed long enough to tire
you," he said, and patted her hand as he rose. "I expect you want
to drowse a little now. Good-night, grandma."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said. And her cold and bent fingers feebly clasped
his hand, giving it an impulse which he allowed it to follow until
he found it resting against her cheek. "Dear boy!" she said faintly;
and he was touched by this, the first caress she had given him
since he was a child. She retained his hand, keeping it against
her cheek a moment longer; then relinquished it gently and said
"Good-bye" again.</p>

<p>"Not ‘good-bye,’ grandma," he protested heartily. "‘Good-night,’
not ‘good-bye.’ You <em>are</em> better, and the doctor himself
says so. Why, by next week——"</p>

<p>"Next week?" she said in the faintest voice in the world and
with the remotest shadow of an elfin smile to herself. "Next week?
Yes. You can—you can bring the baby to see me—next week."</p>

<p>She just reached the end of that permission, her voice was so
infinitely small and so drowsy; and her eyes closed before the
last word;—she seemed to fall asleep even while she spoke. Dan
tiptoed out, nodding to the nurse, who had been close at hand
in the hall and came into the room as he left it.</p>

<p>Downstairs he found the courteous Nimbus waiting, as always,
to unlatch the front door. But to-night the elderly servitor was
solemn and unloquacious beyond his custom. "Goo’-ni’, suh," he
said. "I reckon you’ grammaw ’bout ready to let that big door
swing. Yes, suh. Goo’-ni’, suh."</p>

<p>Dan walked home, wondering what door Nimbus conceived himself
to be talking about, and wondering more what his grandmother had
meant him to remember. But at his own door he was abruptly enlightened
upon Nimbus’s meaning about a "big" one. Harlan met him there
and told him that the nurse had just telephoned.</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage would never explain what she had asked him to remember;
she would never explain anything—never, forever. </p>
