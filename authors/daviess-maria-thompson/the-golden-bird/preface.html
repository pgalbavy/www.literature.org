<p>"Oh, how beautiful!" exclaimed Polly, all restraint leaving her young face
and body as she fell on her knees before the sultan
</p><p>A poor old sheep was lying flat with pathetic inertia while Adam stood over

welcomed him
</p><p>And Bud was beautiful in the "custom-made" fifteen-dollar gray cheviot with
his violet eyes and yellow shock, in spite of his red ears
