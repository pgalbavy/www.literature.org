<p>Now Atli the Good, earl of the Orkneys, comes into the story.
</p>
<p>It chanced that Atli had sailed to Iceland in the autumn on a business
about certain lands that had fallen to him in right of his mother Helga,
who was an Icelander, and he had wintered west of Reyjanes. Spring being
come, he wished to sail home, and, when his ship was bound, he put to
sea full early in the year. But it chanced that bad weather came up from
the south-east, with mist and rain, so he must needs beach his ship in a
creek under shelter of the Westman Islands.
</p><p>Now Atli asked what people dwelt in these parts, and, when he heard the
name of Asmund Asmundson the Priest, he was glad, for in old days he and
Asmund had gone many a viking cruise together.
</p><p>“We will leave the ship here,” he said, “till the weather clears, and go
up to Middalhof to stay with Asmund.”
</p><p>So they made the ship snug, and left men to watch her; but two of the
company, with Earl Atli, rode up to Middalhof.
</p><p>It must be told of Atli that he was the best of the earls who lived in
those days, and he ruled the Orkneys so well that men gave him a by-name
and called him Atli the Good. It was said of him that he had never
turned a poor man away unsuccoured, nor bowed his head before a strong
man, nor drawn his sword without cause, nor refused peace to him who
prayed it. He was sixty years old, but age had left few marks on
him, except that of his long white beard. He was keen-eyed, and
well-fashioned of form and face, a great warrior and the strongest of
men. His wife was dead, leaving him no children, and this was a sorrow
to him; but as yet he had taken no other wife, for he would say: “Love
makes an old man blind,” and “When age runs with youth, both shall
fall,” and again, “Mix grey locks and golden and spoil two heads.” For
this earl was a man of many wise sayings.
</p><p>Now Atli came to Middalhof just as men sat down to meat and, hearing the
clatter of arms, all sprang to their feet, thinking that perhaps Ospakar
had come again as he had promised. But when Asmund saw Atli he knew him
at once, though they had not met for nearly thirty years, and he greeted
him lovingly, and put him in the high seat, and gave place to his men
upon the cross-benches. Atli told all his story, and Asmund bade him
rest a while at Middalhof till the weather grew clearer.
</p><p>Now the Earl saw Swanhild and thought the maid wondrous fair, and so
indeed she was, as she moved scornfully to and fro in her kirtle of
white. Soft was her curling hair and deep were her dark blue eyes, and
bent were her red lips as is a bow above her dimpled chin, and her teeth
shone like pearls.
</p><p>“Is that fair maid thy daughter, Asmund,” asked Atli.
</p><p>“She is named Swanhild the Fatherless,” he answered, turning his face
away.
</p><p>“Well,” said Atli, looking sharply on him, “were the maid sprung from
me, she would not long be called the ‘Fatherless,’ for few have such a
daughter.”
</p><p>“She is fair enough,” said Asmund, “in all save temper, and that is bad
to cross.”
</p><p>“In every sword a flaw,” answers Atli; “but what has an old man to do
with young maids and their beauty?” and he sighed.
</p><p>“I have known younger men who would seem less brisk at bridals,” said
Asmund, and for that time they talked no more of the matter.
</p><p>Now, Swanhild heard something of this speech, and she guessed more; and
it came into her mind that it would be the best of sport to make this
old man love her, and then to mock him and say him nay. So she set
herself to the task, as it ever was her wont, and she found it easy. For
all day long, with downcast eyes and gentle looks, she waited upon the
Earl, and now, at his bidding, she sang to him in a voice soft and low,
and now she talked so wisely well that Atli thought no such maid had
trod the earth before. But he checked himself with many learned saws,
and on a day when the weather had grown fair, and they sat alone, he
told her that his ship was bound for Orkney Isles.
</p><p>Then, as though by chance, Swanhild laid her white hand in his, and on a
sudden looked deep into his eyes, and said with trembling lips, “Ah, go
not yet, lord!--I pray thee, go not yet!”--and, turning, she fled away.
</p><p>But Atli was much moved, and he said to himself: “Now a strange thing
is come to pass: a fair maid loves an old man; and yet, methinks, he
who looks into those eyes sees deep waters,” and he beat his brow and
thought.
</p><p>But Swanhild in her chamber laughed till the tears ran from those same
eyes, for she saw that the great fish was hooked and now the time had
come to play him.
</p><p>For she did not know that it was otherwise fated.
</p><p>Gudruda, too, saw all these things and knew not how to read them, for
she was of an honest mind, and could not understand how a woman may love
a man as Swanhild loved Eric and yet make such play with other men,
and that of her free will. For she guessed little of Swanhild’s
guilefulness, nor of the coldness of her heart to all save Eric; nor of
how this was the only joy left to her: to make a sport of men and put
them to grief and shame. Atli said to himself that he would watch this
maid well before he uttered a word to Asmund, and he deemed himself very
cunning, for he was wondrous cautious after the fashion of those about
to fall. So he set himself to watching, and Swanhild set herself to
smiling, and he told her tales of warfare and of daring, and she clasped
her hands and said:
</p><p>“Was there ever such a man since Odin trod the earth?” And so it went
on, till the serving-women laughed at the old man in love and the wit of
her that mocked him.
</p>
<p>Now upon a day, Eric having made an end of sowing his corn, bethought
himself of his vow to go up alone against Skallagrim the Baresark in his
den on Mosfell over by Hecla. Now, this was a heavy task: for Skallagrim
was held so mighty among men that none went up against him any more; and
at times Eric thought of Gudruda, and sighed, for it was likely that
she would be a widow before she was made a wife. Still, his oath must
be fulfilled, and, moreover, of late Skallagrim having heard that a
youngling named Eric Brighteyes had vowed to slay him single-handed,
had made a mock of him in this fashion. For Skallagrim rode down
to Coldback on Ran River and at night-time took a lamb from the fold.
Holding the lamb beneath his arm, he drew near to the house and smote
thrice on the door with his battle-axe, and they were thundering knocks.
Then he leapt on to his horse and rode off a space and waited. Presently
Eric came out, but half clad, a shield in one hand and Whitefire in the
other, and, looking, by the bright moonlight he saw a huge black-bearded
man seated on a horse, having a great axe in one hand and the lamb
beneath his arm.
</p><p>“Who art thou?” roared Eric.
</p><p>“I am called Skallagrim, youngling,” answered the man on the horse.
“Many men have seen me once, none have wished to see me twice, and some
few have never seen aught again. Now, it has been echoed in my ears that
thou hast vowed a vow to go up Mosfell against Skallagrim the Baresark,
and I am come hither to say that I will make thee right welcome. See,”
 and with his axe he cut off the lamb’s tail on the pommel of his saddle:
“of the flesh of this lamb of thine I will brew broth and of his skin I
will make me a vest. Take thou this tail, and when thou fittest it on
to the skin again, Skallagrim will own a lord,” and he hurled the tail
towards him.
</p><p>“Bide thou there till I can come to thee,” shouted Eric; “it will spare
me a ride to Mosfell.”
</p><p>“Nay, nay. It is good for lads to take the mountain air,” and Skallagrim
turned his horse away, laughing.
</p><p>Eric watched Skallagrim vanish over the knoll, and then, though he was
very angry, laughed also and went in. But first he picked up the tail,
and on the morrow he skinned it.
</p><p>Now the time was come when the matter must be tried, and Eric bade
farewell to Saevuna his mother, and Unna his cousin, and girt Whitefire
round him and set upon his head a golden helm with wings on it. Then he
found the byrnie which his father Thorgrimur had stripped, together with
the helm, from that Baresark who cut off his leg--and this was a good
piece, forged of the Welshmen--and he put it on his breast, and taking
a stout shield of bull’s hide studded with nails, rode away with one
thrall, the strong carle named Jon.
</p><p>But the women misdoubted them much of this venture; nevertheless Eric
might not be gainsayed.
</p><p>Now, the road to Mosfell runs past Middalhof and thither he came. Atli,
standing at the men’s door, saw him and cried aloud: “Ho! a mighty man
comes here.”
</p><p>Swanhild looked out and saw Eric, and he was a goodly sight in his
war-gear. For now, week by week, he seemed to grow more fair and great,
as the full strength of his manhood rose in him, like sap in the spring
grass, and Gudruda was very proud of her lover. That night Eric stayed
at Middalhof, and sat hand in hand with Gudruda and talked with Earl
Atli. Now the heart of the old viking went out to Eric, and he took
great delight in him and in his strength and deeds, and he longed much
that the Gods had given him such a son.
</p><p>“I prophesy this of thee, Brighteyes,” he cried: “that it shall go ill
with this Baresark thou seekest--yes, and with all men who come within
sweep of that great sword of thine. But remember this, lad: guard thy
head with thy buckler, cut low beneath his shield, if he carries one,
and mow the legs from him: for ever a Baresark rushes on, shield up.”
</p><p>Eric thanked him for his good words and went to rest. But, before it
was light, he rose, and Gudruda rose also and came into the hall, and
buckled his harness on him with her own hands.
</p><p>“This is a sad task for me, Eric!” she sighed, “for how do I know that
Baresark’s hands shall not loose this helm of thine?”
</p><p>“That is as it may be, sweet,” he said; “but I fear not the Baresark or
any man. How goes it with Swanhild now?”
</p><p>“I know not. She makes herself sweet to that old Earl and he is fain of
her, and that is beyond my sight.”
</p><p>“I have seen as much,” said Eric. “It will be well for us if he should
wed her.”
</p><p>“Ay, and ill for him; but it is to be doubted if that is in her mind.”
</p><p>Now Eric kissed her soft and sweet, and went away, bidding her look for
his return on the day after the morrow.
</p><p>Gudruda bore up bravely against her fears till he was gone, but then she
wept a little.
</p>
<p>Now it is to be told that Eric and his thrall Jon rode hard up Stonefell
and across the mountains and over the black sand, till, two hours before
sunset, they came to the foot of Mosfell, having Hecla on their right.
It is a grim mountain, grey with moss, standing alone in the desert
plain; but between it and Hecla there is good grassland.
</p><p>“Here is the fox’s earth. Now to start him,” said Eric.
</p><p>He knows something of the path by which this fortress can be climbed
from the south, and horses may be ridden up it for a space. So on they
go, till at length they come to a flat place where water runs down the
black rocks, and here Eric drank of the water, ate food, and washed his
face and hands. This done, he bid Jon tend the horses--for hereabouts
there is a little grass--and be watchful till he returned, since he
must go up against Skallagrim alone. And there with a doubtful heart
Jon stayed all that night. For of all that came to pass he saw but one
thing, and that was the light of Whitefire as it flashed out high above
him on the brow of the mountain when first Brighteyes smote at foe.
</p><p>Eric went warily up the Baresark path, for he would keep his breath in
him, and the light shone redly on his golden helm. High he went, till at
length he came to a pass narrow and dark and hedged on either side
with sheer cliffs, such as two armed men might hold against a score.
He peered down this path, but he saw no Baresark, though it was worn by
Baresark feet. He crept along its length, moving like a sunbeam through
the darkness of the pass, for the light gathered on his helm and sword,
till suddenly the path turned and he was on the brink of a gulf that
seemed to have no bottom, and, looking across and down, he could see Jon
and the horses more than a hundred fathoms beneath. Now Eric must stop,
for this path leads but into the black gulf. Also he was perplexed to
know where Skallagrim had his lair. He crept to the brink and gazed.
Then he saw that a point of rock jutted from the sheer face of the cliff
and that the point was worn with the mark of feet.
</p><p>“Where Baresark passes, there may yeoman follow,” said Eric and,
sheathing Whitefire, without more ado, though he liked the task little,
he grasped the overhanging rock and stepped down on to the point below.
Now he was perched like an eagle over the dizzy gulf and his brain
swam. Backward he feared to go, and forward he might not, for there was
nothing but air. Beside him, growing from the face of the cliff, was a
birch-bush. He grasped it to steady himself. It bent beneath his clutch,
and then he saw, behind it, a hole in the rock through which a man could
creep, and down this hole ran footmarks.
</p><p>“First through air like a bird; now through earth like a fox,” said Eric
and entered the hole. Doubling his body till his helm almost touched his
knee he took three paces and lo! he stood on a great platform of rock,
so large that a hall might be built on it, which, curving inwards,
cannot be seen from the narrow pass. This platform, that is backed
by the sheer cliff, looks straight to the south, and from it he could
search the plain and the path that he had travelled, and there once more
he saw Jon and the horses far below him.
</p><p>“A strong place, truly, and well chosen,” said Eric and looked around.
On the floor of the rock and some paces from him a turf fire still
smouldered, and by it were sheep’s bones, and beyond, in the face of the
overhanging precipice, was the mouth of a cave.
</p><p>“The wolf is at home, or was but lately,” said Eric; “now for his lair;”
 and with that he walked warily to the mouth of the cave and peered
in. He could see nothing yet a while, but surely he heard a sound of
snoring?
</p><p>Then he crept in, and, presently, by the red light of the burning
embers, he saw a great black-bearded man stretched at length upon a rug
of sheepskins, and by his side an axe.
</p><p>“Now it would be easy to make an end of this cave-dweller,” thought
Eric; “but that is a deed I will not do--no, not even to a Baresark--to
slay him in his sleep,” and therewith he stepped lightly to the side
of Skallagrim, and was about to prick him with the point of Whitefire,
when! as he did so, another man sat up behind Skallagrim.
</p><p>“By Thor! for two I did not bargain,” said Eric, and sprang from the
cave.
</p><p>Then, with a grunt of rage, that Baresark who was behind Skallagrim
came out like a she-bear robbed of her whelps, and ran straight at Eric,
sword aloft. Eric gives before him right to the edge of the cliff.
Then the Baresark smites at him and Brighteyes catches the blow on his
shield, and smites at him in turn so well and truly, that the head of
the Baresark flies from his shoulders and spins along the ground, but
his body, with outstretched arms yet gripping at the air, falls over the
edge of the gulf sheer into the water, a hundred fathoms down. It was
the flash that Whitefire made as it circled ere it smote that Jon saw
while he waited in the dell upon the mountain side. But of the Baresark
he saw nothing, for he passed down into the great fire-riven cleft and
was never seen more, save once only, in a strange fashion that shall be
told. This was the first man whom Brighteyes slew.
</p><p>Now the old tale tells that Eric cried aloud: “Little chance had this
one,” and that then a wonderful thing came to pass. For the head on the
rock opened its eyes and answered:
</p><p>“Little chance indeed against thee, Eric Brighteyes. Still, I tell thee
this: that where my body fell there thou shalt fall, and where it lies
there thou shalt lie also.”
</p><p>Now Eric was afraid, for he thought it a strange thing that a severed
head should speak to him.
</p><p>“Here it seems I have to deal with trolls,” he said; “but at the least,
though he speak, this one shall strike no more,” and he looked at the
head, but it answered nothing.
</p><p>Now Skallagrim slept through it all and the light grew so dim that Eric
thought it time to make an end this way or that. Therefore, he took
the head of the slain man, though he feared to touch it, and rolled it
swiftly into the cave, saying, “Now, being so glib of speech, go tell
thy mate that Eric Brighteyes knocks at his door.”
</p><p>Then came sounds as of a man rising, and presently Skallagrim rushed
forth with axe aloft and his fellow’s head in his left hand. He was
clothed in nothing but a shirt and the skin of Eric’s lamb was bound to
his chest.
</p><p>“Where now is my mate?” he said. Then he saw Eric leaning on Whitefire,
his golden helm ablaze with the glory of the passing sun.
</p><p>“It seems that thou holdest somewhat of him in thine hand, Skallagrim,
and for the rest, go seek it in yonder rift.”
</p><p>“Who art thou?” roared Skallagrim.
</p><p>“Thou mayest know me by this token,” said Eric, and he threw towards him
the skin of that lamb’s tail which Skallagrim had lifted from Coldback.
</p><p>Now Skallagrim knew him and the Baresark fit came on. His eyes rolled,
foam flew to his lips, his mouth grinned, and he was awesome to see. He
let fall the head, and, swinging the great axe aloft, rushed at Eric.
But Brighteyes is too swift for him. It would not be well to let that
stroke fall, and it must go hard with aught it struck. He springs
forward, he louts low and sweeps upwards with Whitefire. Skallagrim sees
the sword flare and drops almost to his knee, guarding his head with the
axe; but Whitefire strikes on the iron half of the axe and shears it in
two, so that the axe-head falls to earth. Now the Baresark is weaponless
but unharmed, and it would be an easy task to slay him as he rushes
by. But it came into Eric’s mind that it is an unworthy deed to slay
a swordless man, and this came into his mind also, that he desired
to match his naked might against a Baresark in his rage. So, in the
hardihood of his youth and strength, he cast Whitefire aside, and crying
“Come, try a fall with me, Baresark,” rushed on Skallagrim.
</p><p>“Thou art mad,” yells the Baresark, and they are at it hard. Now they
grip and rend and tear. Ospakar was strong, but the Baresark strength
of Skallagrim is more than the strength of Ospakar, and soon Brighteyes
thinks longingly on Whitefire that he has cast aside. Eric is mighty
beyond the might of men, but he can scarcely hold his own against this
mad man, and very soon he knows that only one chance is left to him, and
that is to cling to Skallagrim till the Baresark fit be passed and he is
once more like other men. But this is easier to tell of than to do, and
presently, strive as he will, Eric is on his back, and Skallagrim
on him. But still he holds the Baresark as with bands of iron, and
Skallagrim may not free his arms, though he strive furiously. Now they
roll over and over on the rock, and the gloom gathers fast about them
till presently Eric sees that they draw near to the brink of that mighty
rift down which the severed head of the cave-dweller has foretold his
fall.
</p><p>“Then we go together,” says Eric, but the Baresark does not heed. Now
they are on the very brink, and here as it chances, or as the Norns
decree, a little rock juts up and this keeps them from falling. Eric is
uppermost, and, strive as he will, Skallagrim may not turn him on his
back again. Still, Brighteyes’ strength may not endure very long, for he
grows faint, and his legs slip slowly over the side of the rift till now
he clings, as it were, by his ribs and shoulder-blades alone, that rub
against the little rock. The light dies away, and Eric thinks on sweet
Gudruda and makes ready to die also, when suddenly a last ray from the
sun falls on the fierce face of Skallagrim, and lo! Brighteyes sees it
change, for the madness goes out of it, and in a moment the Baresark
becomes but as a child in his mighty grip.
</p><p>“Hold!” said Skallagrim, “I crave peace,” and he loosed his clasp.
</p><p>“Not too soon, then,” gasped Eric as, drawing his legs from over the
brink of the rift, he gained his feet and, staggering to his sword,
grasped it very thankfully.
</p><p>“I am fordone!” said Skallagrim; “come, drag me from this place, for I
fall; or, if thou wilt, hew off my head.”
</p><p>“I will not serve thee thus,” said Eric. “Thou art a gallant foe,” and
he put out his hand and drew him into safety.
</p><p>For a while Skallagrim lay panting, then he gained his hands and knees
and crawled to where Eric leaned against the rock.
</p><p>“Lord,” he said, “give me thy hand.”
</p><p>Eric stretched forth his left hand, wondering, and Skallagrim took
it. He did not stretch out his right, for, fearing guile, he gripped
Whitefire in it.
</p><p>“Lord,” Skallagrim said again, “of all men who ever were, thou art
the mightiest. Five other men had not stood before me in my rage, but,
scorning thy weapon, thou didst overcome me in the noblest fashion, and
by thy naked strength alone. Now hearken. Thou hast given me my life,
and it is thine from this hour to the end. Here I swear fealty to thee.
Slay me if thou wilt, or use me if thou wilt, but I think it will be
better for thee to do this rather than that, for there is but one who
has mastered me, and thou art he, and it is borne in upon my mind that
thou wilt have need of my strength, and that shortly.”
</p><p>“That may well be, Skallagrim,” said Eric, “yet I put little trust in
outlaws and cave-dwellers. How do I know, if I take thee to me, that
thou wilt not murder me in my sleep, as it would have been easy for me
to do by thee but now?”
</p><p>“What is it that runs from thy arm,” asked Skallagrim.
</p><p>“Blood,” said Eric.
</p><p>“Stretch out thine arm, lord.”
</p><p>Eric did so, and the Baresark put his lips to the scratch and sucked the
blood, then said:
</p><p>“In this blood of thine I pledge thee, Eric Brighteyes! May Valhalla
refuse me and Hela take me; may I be hunted like a fox from earth to
earth; may trolls torment me and wizards sport with me o’ night; may my
limbs shrivel and my heart turn to water; may my foes overtake me, and
my bones be crushed across the doom-stone--if I fail in one jot from
this my oath that I have sworn! I will guard thy back, I will smite
thy enemies, thy hearthstone shall be my temple, thy honour my honour.
Thrall am I of thine, and thrall I will be, and whiles thou wilt we will
live one life, and, in the end, we will die one death.”
</p><p>“It seems that in going to seek a foe I have found a friend,” said Eric,
“and it is likely enough that I shall need one. Skallagrim, Baresark and
outlaw as thou art, I take thee at thy word. Henceforth, we are master
and man and we will do many a deed side by side, and in token of it I
lengthen thy name and call thee Skallagrim Lambstail. Now, if thou hast
it, give me food and drink, for I am faint from that hug of thine, old
bear.”
