<p>The peril which menaced the explorers was more frightful than
any that they had been called upon to face since entering that
mysterious land known by the name of the Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>The Aryks numbered more than half a hundred, all active, vigilant
and armed with their fearful poisoned javelins.  They had taken
position among the trees on the western bank of the Xingu, at
the base of the rapids, at the very point where the white men
intended to shoulder their canoe and make their last portage.</p>

<p>Instead of being in the open, where they were in plain sight
of the defenders, and fair targets for their unerring Winchesters,
they were stationed behind the numerous trunks or lying on the
ground, where little could be seen of them except their bushy
heads and gleaming black eyes, as they glared with inextinguishable
hate at the white men who had slain so many of their number.</p>

<p>The suspicious Long was looking in the direction, with the thought
that if any ambush was attempted, that would be the very spot,
when he caught sight of a dusky figure, as it whisked from behind
a narrow trunk to another that afforded better cover.</p>

<p>That hasty glance in the dim morning light revealed an alarming
number of heads glaring around the trees and from among the undergrowth
like so many wild beasts, aflame with fury and the exultation
of savages who knew that their enemies were at last forced inextricably
into their grasp.</p>

<p>So assured were the Aryks in fact that they showed a disposition
to toy for a moment with their victims, as a cat does with a mouse
before craunching it in her jaws.  They brandished their weapons,
danced grotesquely and uttered shrill shrieks audible above the
deafening roar of the angry Xingu as it foamed through the rapids.</p>

<p>It was a fearful trap in which our friends found themselves,
for it was impossible to advance or retreat, and it was madness
to hope that they could again escape the shower of spears that
were already poised in the air and ready to be launched.</p>

<p>Bippo and Pedros, with wild shrieks of terror bounded into the
canoe, and wrapping the blankets around them, cowered in abject
helpless dread of impending death.  They were only an incumbrance,
as they had proven in more than one crisis before.</p>

<p>But not one of the Caucasians showed the white feather.  Disdaining
to seek impossible shelter, they coolly prepared to die fighting,
while exposed to the hurtling javelins, whose appalling effectiveness
they knew too well.</p>

<p>But at this appalling juncture, when life hung on the passing
moment, a piercing shout rang out above the roar of the waters.</p>

<p>It came from a point behind them, and, despite the imminent peril
all three looked around.</p>

<p>A small canoe was darting across the Xingu toward them, so close
to the foot of the rapids, that it danced about like a cork and
seemed certain to be submerged every minute.</p>

<p>In this frail craft sat the giant Ziffak, propelling it across
the furious swirl with such prodigious power that though the spume
dashed over it, the boat was driven by the sheer power of his
mighty arms under, above, and through the waters.</p>

<p>It was he who uttered the resounding cry which caused the wondering
explorers to turn their heads, and stayed the uplifted arms of
the venomous Aryks.</p>

<p>All saw the giant head chieftain of the Murhapas who repeated
the shout and added an exclamation that was a command, forbidding
his allies to hurl a single weapon.</p>

<p>They must have deemed him mad, but if so he was ten times more
to be dreaded than if sane.  Not a javelin was launched, but all
stood motionless awaiting his arrival, and doubtless believing
he meant them to pause only long enough to place himself at their
head as the leader.</p>

<p>They must have thought, too, that his appearance so filled the
whites with fear that their arms were paralyzed, for, though he
was in direct range, not a hand of the foreigners was raised to
do him hurt.</p>

<p>Coming with such tremendous speed, Ziffak occupied but a moment
in passing the remaining distance.  Before the prow of his boat
could touch land, he flung the paddle aside, spurned the canoe
with his foot, caught up his huge spear, and with one bound placed
himself opposite the wondering trio of white men, while two more
leaps landed him among the Aryks.</p>

<p>Grimcke, Ashman and Long had read aright the meaning of the amazing
demonstration and calmly awaited the issue.</p>

<p>Pausing in the very middle of the dusky force, he addressed them
in their native tongue, with savage gestures and a fierceness
of tones which rendered every word audible amid the roaring tumult.</p>

<p>Only a second or two was required for him to finish his harangue,
when he made a final command for them to fall back, emphasized
by the swing of his tremendous arms.</p>

<p>No more striking proof could have been given of the sway of this
mighty warrior over his vassals, than was shown by their instant
obedience to the order, which fell upon them like the bursting
of a thunderbolt from the clear summer sky.</p>

<p>They did not scatter and flee, for they had not been directed
to do so, but skurried several rods back among the trees, so as
to leave the way open for the explorers to pass around the rapids
to the calmer waters above.</p>

<p>Ziffak did not remove his eyes from the natives, until he saw
that his commands were not only obeyed, but that it was understood
by them that the white men were not to be molested.</p>

<p>This extraordinary person had hastened to the other shore, in
accordance with his pledge, only to learn from a couple of Aryks
whom he met that the main body of warriors had again crossed the
Xingu above the rapids, and were gathered in the wood waiting
for the whites to walk into the trap set for them.</p>

<p>Had our friends remained where he left them, no danger would
have been encountered, but, as we have shown, they moved up stream
and came within a hair's-breadth of being wiped from the face
of the earth before their powerful ally could interfere.</p>

<p>The breaking morning gave Ziffak his first knowledge of the mistake
they had made, and, leaping into his canoe, he drove it across
the stream with resistless speed, reaching the spot in the nick
of time, and barely doing that, since he was forced to raise his
voice while yet on the river, in order to hold the battle in suspense.</p>

<p>Having satisfied himself that everything was adjusted, Ziffak
now turned around, and, without the least appearance of agitation
on his swarthy countenance, signified that the path was open for
them to continue their journey.</p>

<p>Reaching into the canoe, Ashman seized Bippo by the nape of the
neck and hoisted him out on land.  He did the same with Pedros,
both of them howling in the extremity of mortal terror.  Tearing
the blankets from their bodies, he shouted for them to give their
help in carrying the canoe and luggage around the rapids.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before they could comprehend in their blind
way the situation.  Finally, when they saw that their deaths were
postponed, they lent their aid as eagerly as a couple of obedient
dogs.</p>

<p>The sturdy whites were equally helpful, and the boat was quickly
raised aloft and so adjusted that its well apportioned weight
bore lightly upon the shoulders of all.</p>

<p>The sidelong glances which Bippo and Pedros cast at the Aryks
as they moved up the bank, brought a smile to the whites who witnessed
them. The poor fellows were ready to let go and drop down dead
the moment they felt the puncture of the whizzing javelins.</p>

<p>The Professor was at the head of the strange procession bearing
the boat on their shoulders.  Like his companions, he moved with
a springy, elastic step, for he had received the most striking
proof possible of the friendship of Ziffak, and he foresaw the
dazzling results that were to flow from such an alliance.</p>

<p>Had this remarkable savage been disposed to play them false,
no better opportunity could have been given than that which occurred
a few minutes before.  All he had to do was to arrive on the spot
a minute later: the Aryks would have left nothing for him except
to view the dead bodies of the whites and their servants.</p>

<p>As for Jared Long, the doubter, he was willing to admit that
he had made a grevious error of judgment.  Had he thought that
Ziffak suspected his misgivings, he would have taken the fellow's
hand, and humbly begged his pardon.</p>
