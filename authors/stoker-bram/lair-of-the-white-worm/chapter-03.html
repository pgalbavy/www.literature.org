Curiosity took Adam Salton out of bed in the early morning, but when
he had dressed and gone downstairs; he found that, early as he was,
Sir Nathaniel was ahead of him.  The old gentleman was quite
prepared for a long walk, and they started at once.
<P>
Sir Nathaniel, without speaking, led the way to the east, down the
hill.  When they had descended and risen again, they found
themselves on the eastern brink of a steep hill.  It was of lesser
height than that on which the Castle was situated; but it was so
placed that it commanded the various hills that crowned the ridge.
All along the ridge the rock cropped out, bare and bleak, but broken
in rough natural castellation.  The form of the ridge was a segment
of a circle, with the higher points inland to the west.  In the
centre rose the Castle, on the highest point of all.  Between the
various rocky excrescences were groups of trees of various sizes and
heights, amongst some of which were what, in the early morning
light, looked like ruins.  These--whatever they were--were of
massive grey stone, probably limestone rudely cut--if indeed they
were not shaped naturally.  The fall of the ground was steep all
along the ridge, so steep that here and there both trees and rocks
and buildings seemed to overhang the plain far below, through which
ran many streams.
<P>
Sir Nathaniel stopped and looked around, as though to lose nothing
of the effect.  The sun had climbed the eastern sky and was making
all details clear.  He pointed with a sweeping gesture, as though
calling Adam's attention to the extent of the view.  Having done so,
he covered the ground more slowly, as though inviting attention to
detail.  Adam was a willing and attentive pupil, and followed his
motions exactly, missing--or trying to miss--nothing.
<P>
"I have brought you here, Adam, because it seems to me that this is
the spot on which to begin our investigations.  You have now in
front of you almost the whole of the ancient kingdom of Mercia.  In
fact, we see the whole of it except that furthest part, which is
covered by the Welsh Marches and those parts which are hidden from
where we stand by the high ground of the immediate west.  We can
see--theoretically--the whole of the eastern bound of the kingdom,
which ran south from the Humber to the Wash.  I want you to bear in
mind the trend of the ground, for some time, sooner or later, we
shall do well to have it in our mind's eye when we are considering
the ancient traditions and superstitions, and are trying to find the
RATIONALE of them.  Each legend, each superstition which we receive,
will help in the understanding and possible elucidation of the
others.  And as all such have a local basis, we can come closer to
the truth--or the probability--by knowing the local conditions as we
go along.  It will help us to bring to our aid such geological truth
as we may have between us.  For instance, the building materials
used in various ages can afford their own lessons to understanding
eyes.  The very heights and shapes and materials of these hills--
nay, even of the wide plain that lies between us and the sea--have
in themselves the materials of enlightening books."
<P>
"For instance, sir?" said Adam, venturing a question.
<P>
"Well, look at those hills which surround the main one where the
site for the Castle was wisely chosen--on the highest ground.  Take
the others.  There is something ostensible in each of them, and in
all probability something unseen and unproved, but to be imagined,
also."
<P>
"For instance?" continued Adam.
<P>
"Let us take them SERIATIM.  That to the east, where the trees are,
lower down--that was once the location of a Roman temple, possibly
founded on a pre-existing Druidical one.  Its name implies the
former, and the grove of ancient oaks suggests the latter."
<P>
"Please explain."
<P>
"The old name translated means 'Diana's Grove.'  Then the next one
higher than it, but just beyond it, is called 'MERCY'--in all
probability a corruption or familiarisation of the word MERCIA, with
a Roman pun included.  We learn from early manuscripts that the
place was called VILULA MISERICORDIAE.  It was originally a nunnery,
founded by Queen Bertha, but done away with by King Penda, the
reactionary to Paganism after St. Augustine.  Then comes your
uncle's place--Lesser Hill.  Though it is so close to the Castle, it
is not connected with it.  It is a freehold, and, so far as we know,
of equal age.  It has always belonged to your family."
<P>
"Then there only remains the Castle!"
<P>
"That is all; but its history contains the histories of all the
others--in fact, the whole history of early England."  Sir
Nathaniel, seeing the expectant look on Adam's face, went on:
<P>
"The history of the Castle has no beginning so far as we know.  The
furthest records or surmises or inferences simply accept it as
existing.  Some of these--guesses, let us call them--seem to show
that there was some sort of structure there when the Romans came,
therefore it must have been a place of importance in Druid times--if
indeed that was the beginning.  Naturally the Romans accepted it, as
they did everything of the kind that was, or might be, useful.  The
change is shown or inferred in the name Castra.  It was the highest
protected ground, and so naturally became the most important of
their camps.  A study of the map will show you that it must have
been a most important centre.  It both protected the advances
already made to the north, and helped to dominate the sea coast.  It
sheltered the western marches, beyond which lay savage Wales--and
danger.  It provided a means of getting to the Severn, round which
lay the great Roman roads then coming into existence, and made
possible the great waterway to the heart of England--through the
Severn and its tributaries.  It brought the east and the west
together by the swiftest and easiest ways known to those times.
And, finally, it provided means of descent on London and all the
expanse of country watered by the Thames.
<P>
"With such a centre, already known and organised, we can easily see
that each fresh wave of invasion--the Angles, the Saxons, the Danes,
and the Normans--found it a desirable possession and so ensured its
upholding.  In the earlier centuries it was merely a vantage ground.
But when the victorious Romans brought with them the heavy solid
fortifications impregnable to the weapons of the time, its
commanding position alone ensured its adequate building and
equipment.  Then it was that the fortified camp of the Caesars
developed into the castle of the king.  As we are as yet ignorant of
the names of the first kings of Mercia, no historian has been able
to guess which of them made it his ultimate defence; and I suppose
we shall never know now.  In process of time, as the arts of war
developed, it increased in size and strength, and although recorded
details are lacking, the history is written not merely in the stone
of its building, but is inferred in the changes of structure.  Then
the sweeping changes which followed the Norman Conquest wiped out
all lesser records than its own.  To-day we must accept it as one of
the earliest castles of the Conquest, probably not later than the
time of Henry I.  Roman and Norman were both wise in their retention
of places of approved strength or utility.  So it was that these
surrounding heights, already established and to a certain extent
proved, were retained.  Indeed, such characteristics as already
pertained to them were preserved, and to-day afford to us lessons
regarding things which have themselves long since passed away.
<P>
"So much for the fortified heights; but the hollows too have their
own story.  But how the time passes!  We must hurry home, or your
uncle will wonder what has become of us."
<P>
He started with long steps towards Lesser Hill, and Adam was soon
furtively running in order to keep up with him.
