<p>When Jasper Jay told Fatty Coon about Farmer Green's forty fat turkeys
Fatty felt hungrier than ever.
</p>
<p>"Oh! I mustn't go near Farmer Green's house!" he said. "My mother told
me to keep away from there. . . . What time did you say the turkeys go
to roost?"
</p><p>"Oh! they go to roost every night at sundown," Jasper Jay explained.
"And there they sit, up in the tree, all night long. They're fast
asleep. And you would have no trouble at all in catching as many as you
wanted. . . . But of course, if you're afraid--why there's no use of MY
talking about it. There's a plenty of other coons in these woods who'd
be glad to know about those turkeys. And maybe they'd have the manners
to say 'Thank you!' too." And with a hoarse, sneering laugh Jasper Jay
flew away.
</p><p>That was enough for Fatty. He made up his mind that he would show Jasper
Jay that HE was not afraid. And he wanted a turkey to eat, too. He said
nothing to his mother about Jasper's news. But that very night, when the
moon came up, and the lights in Farmer Green's house were all out, Fatty
Coon went stealing across the fields.
</p><p>He was not afraid, for he knew that Farmer Green and all his family were
in their beds. And it was so cold that Fatty felt sure that Farmer
Green's dogs would be inside their kennels.
</p><p>Fatty did not intend to make any noise. The turkeys were asleep--so
Jasper Jay had told him--and he expected to grab one of them so swiftly
and silently that the other turkeys would never know it.
</p><p>When Fatty Coon came to Farmer Green's yard he had no trouble at all in
finding the spreading oak. He could see the turkeys plainly where they
dozed on the bare branches. And in less time than it takes to tell it
Fatty had climbed the tree. On the very lowest limb there was a row of
four plump turkeys, all sound asleep. And Fatty reached out and seized
the nearest one. He seized the turkey by the neck, so that the big bird
could not call out. But Fatty was not quite quick enough. Before he
could pull her off her perch the turkey began to flap her wings, and she
struck the turkey next her, so that THAT turkey woke up and began to
gobble and flap HER wings. Then the next turkey on the limb woke up. And
the first thing that Fatty Coon knew, every one of the thirty-nine
turkeys that were left was going gobble-gob-gob-gob-gobble! And some of
them went sailing off across the yard. One of them lighted on top of the
porch just outside Farmer Green's window and it seemed to Fatty that
that one made the greatest racket of all.
</p><p>Farmer Green's window flew up; and Farmer Green's voice called "Spot!
Spot!"
</p><p>Fatty Coon did not wait to hear anything more. He dropped the turkey he
had seized and slipped down to the ground. And then he ran toward the
woods as fast as he could go.
</p><p>Farmer Green's dog Spot was barking now. And Fatty wanted to climb one
of the trees by the roadside. But he remembered, the narrow escape he
had had when the dog had treed him near the cornfield. So he never
stopped until he reached the woods. Then he went nimbly up into the
trees. And while Spot was barking at the foot of the first tree he
climbed, Fatty was travelling through the tree-tops toward home.
</p><p>He never said anything to his mother about Farmer Green's turkeys. But
the next time he saw Jasper Jay Fatty told him exactly what he thought
of him.
</p><p>"Ha! ha!" Jasper Jay only laughed. And he did not seem at all surprised
that Fatty had fallen into trouble. To tell the truth, he was only sorry
because Fatty had escaped. Jasper Jay did not like Fatty Coon. And he
had told him about the forty fat turkeys because he hoped that Fatty
would get caught if he tried to steal one of them.
</p><p>"Wait till I catch you!" Fatty said.
</p><p>But Jasper Jay only laughed harder than ever when Fatty said that. He
seemed to think it was a great joke. He was most annoying.
