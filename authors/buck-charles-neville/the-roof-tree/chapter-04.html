<p>A week later Dorothy led Kenneth Thornton and Peter Doane to a place
where beside a huge boulder a "spring-branch" gushed into a natural
basin of stone. The ferns grew thick there, and the moss lay deep and
green, but over the spot, with branches spreading nobly and its head
high-reared, stood an ancient walnut and in the narrow circle of open
ground at its base grew a young tree perhaps three feet tall.
</p>
<p>"I want to move that baby tree," said Dorothy, and now her voice became
vibrant, "to a place where, when it has grown tall, it can stand as a
monument over my mother's grave."
</p><p>She paused, and the two young men offered no comment. Each was watching
the glow in her eyes and feeling that, to her, this ceremony meant
something more than the mere setting out of a random seedling.
</p><p>"It will stand guard over our home," she went on, and her eyes took on
an almost dreamy far-awayness. "It will be shade in summer and a
reminder of coming spring in winter. It will look down on people as they
live and die--and are born. At last," she concluded, "when I come to die
myself, I want to be buried under it, too."
</p><p>When the young walnut had been lifted clear and its roots packed with
some of its own native earth Kenneth Thornton started away carrying it
in advance while Dorothy and Peter followed.
</p><p>But before they came to the open space young Doane stopped on the path
and barred the girl's way. "Dorothy," he began, awkwardly, and with
painful embarrassment, "I've got something thet must needs be said--an'
I don't rightly know how to say it."
</p><p>She looked up into his set face and smiled.
</p><p>"Can I help you say it?" she inquired, and he burst out passionately,
"Until <u>he</u> come, you seemed to like me. Now you don't think of nobody
else but jest him ... and I hates him."
</p><p>"If it's hatred you want to talk about," she said, reproachfully, "I
don't think I can help you after all."
</p><p>"Hatred of him," he hastened to explain. "I've done lived in the
woods--an' I ain't never learned pretty graces ... but I can't live
without you, an' if he comes betwixt us...."
</p><p>The girl raised a hand.
</p><p>"Peter," she said, slowly, "we've been good friends, you and I. I want
to go on being good friends with you ... but that's all I can say."
</p><p>"And him," demanded the young man, with white cheeks and passion-shaken
voice, "what of him?"
</p><p>"He asked me an hour ago," she answered, frankly. "We're going to be
married."
</p><p>The face of the backwoodsman worked spasmodically for a moment with an
agitation against which his stoic training was no defense. When his
passion permitted speech he said briefly, "I wishes ye joy of him--damn
him!"
</p><p>Then he wheeled and disappeared in the tangle.
</p><p>"I'm sorry, dearest," declared Thornton when she had told him the story
and his arms had slipped tenderly about her, "that I've cost you a
friend, but I'm proud beyond telling that this tree was planted on the
day you declared for me. To me too, it's a monument now."
</p><p>That night the moon was clouded until late but broke through its
shrouding before Dorothy went to bed, and she slipped out to look at
the young shoot and perhaps to think of the man who had taken her in his
arms there.
</p><p>But as she approached she saw no standing shape and when she reached the
spot she found that the freshly placed earth had been dug up. The tree
had been spitefully dragged from its place and left lying with its roots
extending up instead of its branches. Plainly it was an act of mean
vandalism and Dorothy feared an emblem of deeper threat as well.
</p><p>Already in the girl's thought this newly planted monument had become a
sacred thing. To let it be so soon destroyed would be an evil augury and
submission to a desecration. To tell Kenneth Thornton would kindle his
resentment and provoke a dangerous quarrel. She herself must remedy the
matter. So Dorothy Parish went for her spade, and late into the night
she laboured at that second transplanting.
</p><p>The roots had not had time to dry or burn, because they had been
upturned so short a time, and before the girl went to her bed the task
was finished, and she dreamed of birds nesting in broad branches and
other home-making thoughts more intimate, but also of vague dangers and
grudge-bearings.
</p><p>But the next morning her face blanched when her father roused her before
dawn.
</p><p>"Kenneth Thornton was waylaid and shot last night," he said, briefly.
"They fear he's dying. He's been asking for you."
</p><p>About the door of Thornton's cabin in the gray freshness of that summer
dawn stood a clump of silent men in whose indignant eyes burned a sombre
light which boded no good for the would-be murderer if he were found. As
the girl came up, with her face pale and grief-stricken, they drew back
on either side opening passageway for her, and Dorothy went directly to
the bed.
</p><p>Caleb, though, halted at the threshold in response to a hand laid
detainingly on his fringed sleeve.
</p><p>"We hates to accuse a white man of a deed like this," said Jake Rowlett,
a time-gnawed old Indian fighter, "but Thornton made a statement to
us--under oath. He recognized Peter Doane--and Peter would of scalped
him as well as shot him only he heard somebody rustlin' the brush an'
got away."
</p><p>"Peter Doane!" Caleb pressed a shaken hand to his bewildered forehead.
"Peter Doane--but I can't credit that! Peter has sat by my hearth night
after night ... Peter has eaten my salt ... Peter has been our
staunchest reliance!"
</p><p>Caleb's glance travelled searchingly about the circle of faces and read
there unanimous conviction and grim determination.
</p><p>"Peter has done growed to be half Injin hisself," came the decided
answer. "Thornton didn't swear to no lie when he knew he mout be dyin'."
</p><p>Caleb straightened decisively and his eyes blazed in spurts of wrath.
</p><p>"Go after him then," he ordered. "It won't do to let him get away."
</p><p>The pursuit parties that spread into the woods travelled fast and
studiously--yet with little hope of success.
</p><p>No man better than Peter Doane himself would recognize his desperation
of plight--and if he had "gone bad" there was but one road for his feet
and the security of the colony depended upon his thwarting.
</p><p>Pioneer chronicles crowned with anathema unspeakable their small but
infamous roster of white renegades, headed by the hated name of Samuel
Girty; renegades who had "painted their faces and gone to the Indians!"
</p><p>These were the unforgivably damned!
</p><p>Now at the council-fires of Yellow-Jacket, even at the war-lodge of
Dragging Canoe himself, the voluntary coming of Peter Doane would mean
feasting and jubilation and a promise of future atrocities.
</p><p>Inside Dorothy bent over the bed and saw the eyes of her lover open
slowly and painfully. His lips parted in a ghost of his old, flashing
smile.
</p><p>"Is the tree safe?" he whispered.
</p><p>The girl stooped and slipped an arm under the man's shoulders. The
masses of her night-dark hair fell brushing his face in a fragrant
cascade and her deep eyes were wide, unmasking to his gaze all the
candid fears and intensities of her love. Then as her lips met his in
the first kiss she had ever given him, unasked, it seemed to him that a
current of exaltation and vitality swept into him that death could not
overcome.
</p><p>"I'm going to get well," he told her. "Life is too full--and without
you, heaven would be empty."
</p><p>The next pack train did not arrive. But several weeks later a single,
half-famished survivor stumbled into the fort. His hands were bound, his
tongue swollen from thirst, and about his shoulders dangled a hideous
necklace of white scalps. When he had been restored to speech he
delivered the message for which his life had been spared.
</p><p>"This is what's left of your pack train," was the insolent word that
Peter Doane--now calling himself Chief Mad-dog, had sent back to his
former comrades. "The balance has gone on to Yellow Jacket, but some day
I will come back for Thornton's scalp--and my squaw."
</p><p>As the summer waned the young walnut tree sent down its roots to vigour
and imperceptibly lifted its crest. Its leaves did not wither but gained
in greenness and lustre, and as it prospered so Kenneth Thornton also
prospered, until when the season of corn shucking came again, he and
Dorothy stood beside it, and Caleb, who had received his credentials as
a justice of the peace, read for them the ritual of marriage.
</p><hr/>
<p>At the adze-smoothed table of a house which, for all its pioneer
crudity, reflected the spirit of tradition-loving inhabitants, sat a
young woman whose dark hair hung braided and whose dark eyes looked up
from time to time in thoughtful reminiscence.
</p><p>She was writing with a goose-quill which she dipped into an ink-horn,
and as she nibbled at the end of her pen one might have seen that
whatever she was setting down lay close to her heart.
</p><p>"Since I can not tell," she wrote, "whether or not I shall survive ye
comings of that new life upon which all my thoughts are set and should
such judgment be His Wille, I want that ye deare child shall have this
record of ye days its father and I spent here in these forest hills so
remote from ye sea and ye rivers of our dear Virginia and ye gentle
refinements we put behind us to become pioneers. This wish leads me to
the writing of a journall."
</p><p>A shadow in the doorway cut the shaft of sunlight and the woman at the
writing table turned. On the threshold stood Kenneth Thornton and by the
hand he held a savage-visaged child clad in breech clout and moccasins,
but otherwise naked. Its eyes held the beady sharpness of the Indian,
and though hardly past babyhood, it stood haughtily rigid and
expressionless.
</p><p>The face of the man was not flashing its smile now, but deeply grave,
and as his wife's gaze questioned him he spoke slowly.
</p><p>"This is Peter Doane's boy," he said, briefly.
</p><p>Dorothy Thornton shrank back with a gesture of repulsion, and the man
went on:
</p><p>"A squaw with a travelling party of friendly Indians brought him in.
Mad-dog Doane is dead. His life ended in a drunken brawl in an Otari
village--but before he died he asked that the child be brought back to
us."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Because," Thornton spoke seriously, "blood can't be silenced when death
comes. The squaw said Chief Mad-dog wanted his boy raised to be a white
brave.... He's half white, of course."
</p><p>"And <u>he</u> ventured to ask favours of <u>us</u>!" The woman's voice,
ordinarily gentle, hardened, and the man led the child over and laid his
own hand on her shoulder.
</p><p>"The child is not to blame," he reminded her. "He's the fruit of
madness--but he has human life."
</p><p>Dorothy rose, inclining her head in reluctant assent.
</p><p>"I'll fetch him a white child's clothes," she said.
</p><p>This was the story that the faded pages told and a small part of which
Dorothy Harper read as she sat in the lamplight of the attic a century
and a quarter later.
