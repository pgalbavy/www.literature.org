<p>Within the following half hour a pleasant surprise came to the
little party.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" exclaimed the pioneer to his wife, "do you see
that, Margaret?"</p>

<p>He pointed to the ground between them as he spoke, and she nodded
her head with a smile.</p>

<p>"We are travelling over a trail," he added; "Red Crow is keeping
his promise; he knows what he is doing."</p>

<p>It was the truth. The path was faintly marked, but it was unmistakable,
and all knew the meaning. They were approaching one of those open
spaces, known as "salt licks," which are quite numerous in Kentucky
and Ohio. Naturally they are the resort of animals who thread
their way over long distances to the spots where the brackish
moisture, oozing through the ground, affords a taste of the mineral
which is as indispensable to beasts as to human beings.</p>

<p>The bears, deer, buffaloes and other inhabitants, journeying
toward one common point, gradually form paths through the forest,
into which additional brutes turn, adding to the distinctness
of the trails, which sometimes radiate outward from the common
centre like the spokes of a wheel, until they gradually lose themselves
in the wood, as the brutes diverge from the route, whose individuality
becomes lost like the course of the streams in the sandy wastes
of Africa or the barren regions of the Southwest.</p>

<p>By and by the path was as clearly defined as the trail connecting
the settlement and the block-house. A short distance farther and
they arrived at the lick.</p>

<p>The favorite time for the wild animals to visit these places
of refreshment is early in the morning, but when our friends arrived
there, a huge wolf was lapping the ground on the other side. They
caught but a single glimpse of him, when he skurried off among
the trees, vanishing in a twinkling.</p>

<p>The sight was a singular one, with the ground worn as smooth
as the floor of a barn by the licking of multitudinous tongues,
and its moisture glistened in the sunlight, as if it had been
oiled.</p>

<p>The horses showed their appreciation of the luxury by stretching
out their necks and eagerly applying their tongues to the saltish
surface. They were allowed to do so freely, and a few minutes
later Kenton joined them. His handsome face expanded with a broad
grin, and he surprised all, especially the recipient of the compliment,
by slapping Red Crow on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Arqu-wao, you're a powerful good chap, and here's my hand on
it."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe, rather gingerly, allowed his palm to be almost
crushed in that of the scout.</p>

<p>"He's doin' jes' what the varmint said he would," added Kenton,
addressing the rest of the party. "If nothin' don't happen, he'll
land us at the settlement all right, but we're goin' to be followed."</p>

<p>"Have you discovered anything?" asked Mr. Edwards.</p>

<p>"Not as yet, but they won't let us slip away in this style without
some kind of a rumpus; we musn't stay here too long."</p>

<p>Red Crow was of the same mind, for he tugged at the rein of the
leading horse, who was reluctant to abandon his feast, while the
pioneer had to work as hard with the other before he would leave
the spot. The lick was skirted and another trail taken on the
other side, so that the journey was continued in substantially
the same direction as before. Inasmuch, however, as this path
must soon dissipate itself, there was some curiosity to know what
their guide would do when the point of vanishing was reached.
Not a member of the party, however, felt distrust of his ability
and loyalty to them.</p>

<p>Kenton, as before, fell to the rear, for there was every reason
to believe that whenever the Shawanoes chose to make a demonstration,
it would be from that quarter. As anticipated, the path grew fainter
as they progressed until it was hardly perceptible, but the wood
remained open, and progress was comparatively easy.</p>

<p>For some minutes before this the whites had been sensible of
a dull, roaring sound, which at times was quite distinct, and
then sank again beyond their power of hearing.</p>

<p>"I believe that is the stream where Larry and I had so much trouble
yesterday and last night," said Wharton to his father.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly you are right."</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he intends we shall cross it?"</p>

<p>"If he does, he knows the way."</p>

<p>"I guess we will not, for you know the regular trail doesn't
take the other side."</p>

<p>"But if he means to follow a new course to the settlement, it
may be necessary."</p>

<p>The afternoon was well along, and some of the party had eaten
nothing since early morning. All were hungry, but though there
was a substantial lunch in the packs carried by the horses, no
one spoke of it. They were too desirous of getting forward while
the opportunity was theirs, to pay any attention to their appetites.</p>

<p>They had not yet reached the torrent, which was now close at
hand, when Red Crow halted the animals and said to the pioneer:</p>

<p>"Wait here &mdash;Arqu-wao go ahead&mdash;won't stay long&mdash;want to
see."</p>

<p>Mr. Edwards bowed his head, signifying that it should be as he
wished, and the Shawanoe was off in a twinkling before Kenton,
who was hardly out of sight to the rear, could come up. He soon
appeared, and inquired what had taken place.</p>

<p>"Thar's trouble," was his emphatic comment.</p>

<p>"How can you know that?" asked the pioneer, with slight impatience;
"you haven't seen anything."</p>

<p>"We're not far from where the younkers had the row yesterday;
the lake isn't more'n half a mile up stream, and the reg'lar trail
ain't that fur off in t'other direction."</p>

<p>"Don't you think Red Crow is acting wisely?"</p>

<p>"No one could do as well. It ain't that; but I told you we wouldn't
reach the settlement without a rumpus. He means to take us across
the gorge. The other varmints may not know the course we've took,
but they'll be smart enough to 'spect that we'll try to cross
at this spot, and some of 'em will be on the watch thar as sure
as you're born. Wait hyar whar you be till I go ahead and larn
how things stand. I think Red Crow is likely to need me."</p>

<p>The words proved true sooner than the sagacious scout suspected.</p>
