<P>
Some hours later, fifty men followed Norman of Torn on foot through the
ravine below the castle where John de Fulm, Earl of Buckingham, had his
headquarters; while nearly a thousand more lurked in the woods before the
grim pile.
<P>
Under cover of the tangled shrubbery, they crawled unseen to the little
door through which Joan de Tany had led him the night before.  Following
the corridors and vaults beneath the castle, they came to the stone
stairway, and mounted to the passage which led to the false panel that had
given the two fugitives egress.
<P>
Slipping the spring lock, Norman of Torn entered the apartment followed
closely by his henchmen.  On they went, through apartment after apartment,
but no sign of the Earl or his servitors rewarded their search, and it was
soon apparent that the castle was deserted.
<P>
As they came forth into the courtyard, they descried an old man basking in
the sun, upon a bench.  The sight of them nearly caused the old fellow to
die of fright, for to see fifty armed men issue from the untenanted halls
was well reckoned to blanch even a braver cheek.
<P>
When Norman of Torn questioned him, he learned that De Fulm had ridden out
early in the day bound for Dover, where Prince Edward then was.  The outlaw
knew it would be futile to pursue him, but yet, so fierce was his anger
against this man, that he ordered his band to mount, and spurring to their
head, he marched through Middlesex, and crossing the Thames above London,
entered Surrey late the same afternoon.
<P>
As they were going into camp that night in Kent, midway between London and
Rochester, word came to Norman of Torn that the Earl of Buckingham, having
sent his escort on to Dover, had stopped to visit the wife of a royalist
baron, whose husband was with Prince Edward's forces.
<P>
The fellow who gave this information was a servant in my lady's household
who held a grudge against his mistress for some wrong she had done him.
When, therefore, he found that these grim men were searching for De Fulm,
he saw a way to be revenged upon his mistress.
<P>
"How many swords be there at the castle ?" asked Norman of Torn.
<P>
"Scarce a dozen, barring the Earl of Buckingham," replied the knave; "and,
furthermore, there be a way to enter, which I may show you, My Lord, so
that you may, unseen, reach the apartment where My Lady and the Earl be
supping."
<P>
"Bring ten men, beside yourself, Shandy," commanded Norman of Torn.  "We
shall pay a little visit upon our amorous friend, My Lord, the Earl of
Buckingham."
<P>
Half an hour's ride brought them within sight of the castle.  Dismounting,
and leaving their horses with one of the men, Norman of Torn advanced on
foot with Shandy and the eight others, close in the wake of the traitorous
servant.
<P>
The fellow led them to the rear of the castle, where, among the brush, he
had hidden a rude ladder, which, when tilted, spanned the moat and rested
its farther end upon a window ledge some ten feet above the ground.
<P>
"Keep the fellow here till last, Shandy," said the outlaw, "till all be in,
an' if there be any signs of treachery, stick him through the gizzard --
death thus be slower and more painful."
<P>
So saying, Norman of Torn crept boldly across the improvised bridge, and
disappeared within the window beyond.  One by one the band of cut-throats
passed through the little window, until all stood within the castle beside
their chief; Shandy coming last with the servant.
<P>
"Lead me quietly, knave, to the room where My Lord sups," said Norman of
Torn.  "You, Shandy, place your men where they can prevent my being
interrupted."
<P>
Following a moment or two after Shandy came another figure stealthily
across the ladder and, as Norman of Torn and his followers left the little
room, this figure pushed quietly through the window and followed the great
outlaw down the unlighted corridor.
<P>
A moment later, My Lady of Leybourn looked up from her plate upon the grim
figure of an armored knight standing in the doorway of the great dining
hall.
<P>
"My Lord Earl !" she cried.  "Look !  Behind you."
<P>
And as the Earl of Buckingham glanced behind him , he overturned the bench
upon which he sat in his effort to gain his feet; for My Lord Earl of
Buckingham had a guilty conscience.
<P>
The grim figure raised a restraining hand, as the Earl drew his sword.
<P>
"A moment, My Lord," said a low voice in perfect French.
<P>
"Who are you ?" cried the lady.
<P>
"I be an old friend of My Lord, here; but let me tell you a little story.
<P>
"In a grim old castle in Essex, only last night, a great lord of England
held by force the beautiful daughter of a noble house and, when she spurned
his advances, he struck her with his clenched fist upon her fair face, and
with his brute hands choked her.  And in that castle also was a despised
and hunted outlaw, with a price upon his head, for whose neck the hempen
noose has been yawning these many years.  And it was this vile person who
came in time to save the young woman from the noble flower of knighthood
that would have ruined her young life.
<P>
"The outlaw wished to kill the knight, but many men-at-arms came to the
noble's rescue, and so the outlaw was forced to fly with the girl lest he
be overcome by numbers, and the girl thus fall again into the hands of her
tormentor.
<P>
"But this crude outlaw was not satisfied with merely rescuing the girl, he
must needs mete out justice to her noble abductor and collect in full the
toll of blood which alone can atone for the insult and violence done her.
<P>
"My Lady, the young girl was Joan de Tany; the noble was My Lord the Earl
of Buckingham; and the outlaw stands before you to fulfill the duty he has
sworn to do.  En garde, My Lord !"
<P>
The encounter was short, for Norman of Torn had come to kill, and he had
been looking through a haze of blood for hours -- in fact every time he had
thought of those brutal fingers upon the fair throat of Joan de Tany and of
the cruel blow that had fallen upon her face.
<P>
He showed no mercy, but backed the Earl relentlessly into a corner of the
room, and when he had him there where he could escape in no direction, he
drove his blade so deep through his putrid heart that the point buried
itself an inch in the oak panel beyond.
<P>
Claudia Leybourn sat frozen with horror at the sight she was witnessing,
and, as Norman of Torn wrenched his blade from the dead body before him and
wiped it on the rushes of the floor, she gazed in awful fascination while
he drew his dagger and made a mark upon the forehead of the dead nobleman.
<P>
"Outlaw or Devil," said a stern voice behind them, "Roger Leybourn owes you
his friendship for saving the honor of his home."
<P>
Both turned to discover a mail-clad figure standing in the doorway where
Norman of Torn had first appeared.
<P>
"Roger !" shrieked Claudia Leybourn, and swooned.
<P>
"Who be you ?" continued the master of Leybourn addressing the outlaw.
<P>
For answer Norman of Torn pointed to the forehead of the dead Earl of
Buckingham, and there Roger Leybourn saw, in letters of blood, NT.
<P>
The Baron advanced with outstretched hand.
<P>
"I owe you much.  You have saved my poor, silly wife from this beast, and
Joan de Tany is my cousin, so I am doubly beholden to you, Norman of Torn."
<P>
The outlaw pretended that he did not see the hand.
<P>
"You owe me nothing, Sir Roger, that may not be paid by a good supper.  I
have eaten but once in forty-eight hours."
<P>
The outlaw now called to Shandy and his men, telling them to remain on
watch, but to interfere with no one within the castle.
<P>
He then sat at the table with Roger Leybourn and his lady, who had
recovered from her swoon, and behind them on the rushes of the floor lay
the body of De Fulm in a little pool of blood.
<P>
Leybourn told them that he had heard that De Fulm was at his home, and had
hastened back; having been in hiding about the castle for half an hour
before the arrival of Norman of Torn, awaiting an opportunity to enter
unobserved by the servants.  It was he who had followed across the ladder
after Shandy.
<P>
The outlaw spent the night at the castle of Roger Leybourn; for the first
time within his memory a welcomed guest under his true name at the house of
a gentleman.
<P>
The following morning, he bade his host goodbye, and returning to his camp
started on his homeward march toward Torn.
<P>
Near midday, as they were approaching the Thames near the environs of
London, they saw a great concourse of people hooting and jeering at a small
party of gentlemen and gentlewomen.
<P>
Some of the crowd were armed, and from very force of numbers were waxing
brave to lay violent hands upon the party.  Mud and rocks and rotten
vegetables were being hurled at the little cavalcade, many of them barely
missing the women of the party.
<P>
Norman of Torn waited to ask no questions, but spurring into the thick of
it laid right and left of him with the flat of his sword, and his men,
catching the contagion of it, swarmed after him until the whole pack of
attacking ruffians were driven into the Thames.
<P>
And then, without a backward glance at the party he had rescued, he
continued on his march toward the north.
<P>
The little party sat upon their horses looking in wonder after the
retreating figures of their deliverers.  Then one of the ladies turned to a
knight at her side with a word of command and an imperious gesture toward
the fast disappearing company.  He, thus addressed, put spurs to his horse,
and rode at a rapid gallop after the outlaw's troop.  In a few moments he
had overtaken them and reined up beside Norman of Torn.
<P>
"Hold, Sir Knight," cried the gentleman, "the Queen would thank you in
person for your brave defence of her."
<P>
Ever keen to see the humor of a situation, Norman of Torn wheeled his horse
and rode back with the Queen's messenger.
<P>
As he faced Her Majesty, the Outlaw of Torn bent low over his pommel.
<P>
"You be a strange knight that thinks so lightly on saving a queen's life
that you ride on without turning your head, as though you had but driven a
pack of curs from annoying a stray cat," said the Queen.
<P>
"I drew in the service of a woman, Your Majesty, not in the service of a
queen."
<P>
"What now !  Wouldst even belittle the act which we all witnessed ?  The
King, my husband, shall reward thee, Sir Knight, if you but tell me your
name."
<P>
"If I told my name, methinks the King would be more apt to hang me,"
laughed the outlaw.  "I be Norman of Torn."
<P>
The entire party looked with startled astonishment upon him, for none of
them had ever seen this bold raider whom all the nobility and gentry of
England feared and hated.
<P>
"For lesser acts than that which thou hast just performed, the King has
pardoned men before," replied Her Majesty.  "But raise your visor, I would
look upon the face of so notorious a criminal who can yet be a gentleman
and a loyal protector of his queen."
<P>
"They who have looked upon my face, other than my friends," replied Norman
of Torn quietly, "have never lived to tell what they saw beneath this
visor, and as for you, Madame, I have learned within the year to fear it
might mean unhappiness to you to see the visor of the Devil of Torn lifted
from his face." Without another word he wheeled and galloped back to his
little army.
<P>
"The puppy, the insolent puppy," cried Eleanor of England, in a rage.
<P>
And so the Outlaw of Torn and his mother met and parted after a period of
twenty years.
<P>
Two days later, Norman of Torn directed Red Shandy to lead the forces of
Torn from their Essex camp back to Derby.  The numerous raiding parties
which had been constantly upon the road during the days they had spent in
this rich district had loaded the extra sumpter beasts with rich and
valuable booty and the men, for the time satiated with fighting and loot,
turned their faces toward Torn with evident satisfaction.
<P>
The outlaw was speaking to his captains in council; at his side the old man
of Torn.
<P>
"Ride by easy stages, Shandy, and I will overtake you by tomorrow morning.
I but ride for a moment to the castle of De Tany on an errand, and, as I
shall stop there but a few moments, I shall surely join you tomorrow."
<P>
"Do not forget, My Lord," said Edwild the Serf, a great yellow-haired Saxon
giant, "that there be a party of the King's troops camped close by the road
which branches to Tany."
<P>
"I shall give them plenty of room," replied Norman of Torn.  "My neck
itcheth not to be stretched," and he laughed and mounted.
<P>
Five minutes after he had cantered down the road from camp, Spizo the
Spaniard, sneaking his horse unseen into the surrounding forest, mounted
and spurred rapidly after him.  The camp, in the throes of packing
refractory, half broken sumpter animals, and saddling their own wild
mounts, did not notice his departure.  Only the little grim, gray, old man
knew that he had gone, or why, or whither.
<P>
That afternoon, as Roger de Conde was admitted to the castle of Richard de
Tany and escorted to a little room where he awaited the coming of the Lady
Joan, a swarthy messenger handed a letter to the captain of the King's
soldiers camped a few miles south of Tany.
<P>
The officer tore open the seal as the messenger turned and spurred back in
the direction from which he had come.
<P>
And this was what he read:
<P>
Norman of Torn is now at the castle of Tany, without escort.
<P>
Instantly the call "to arms" and "mount" sounded through the camp and, in
five minutes, a hundred mercenaries galloped rapidly toward the castle of
Richard de Tany, in the visions of their captain a great reward and honor
and preferment for the capture of the mighty outlaw who was now almost
within his clutches.
<P>
Three roads meet at Tany; one from the south along which the King's
soldiers were now riding; one from the west which had guided Norman of Torn
from his camp to the castle; and a third which ran northwest through
Cambridge and Huntingdon toward Derby.
<P>
All unconscious of the rapidly approaching foes, Norman of Torn waited
composedly in the anteroom for Joan de Tany.
<P>
Presently she entered, clothed in the clinging house garment of the period;
a beautiful vision, made more beautiful by the suppressed excitement which
caused the blood to surge beneath the velvet of her cheek, and her breasts
to rise and fall above her fast beating heart.
<P>
She let him take her fingers in his and raise them to his lips, and then
they stood looking into each other's eyes in silence for a long moment.
<P>
"I do not know how to tell you what I have come to tell," he said sadly.
"I have not meant to deceive you to your harm, but the temptation to be
with you and those whom you typify must be my excuse.  I -- " He paused.
It was easy to tell her that he was the Outlaw of Torn, but if she loved
him, as he feared, how was he to tell her that he loved only Bertrade de
Montfort ?
<P>
"You need tell me nothing," interrupted Joan de Tany.  "I have guessed what
you would tell me, Norman of Torn.  'The spell of moonlight and adventure
is no longer upon us' -- those are your own words, and still I am glad to
call you friend."
<P>
The little emphasis she put upon the last word bespoke the finality of her
decision that the Outlaw of Torn could be no more than friend to her.
<P>
"It is best," he replied, relieved that, as he thought, she felt no love
for him now that she knew him for what he really was.  "Nothing good could
come to such as you, Joan, if the Devil of Torn could claim more of you
than friendship; and so I think that for your peace of mind and for my own,
we will let it be as though you had never known me.  I thank you that you
have not been angry with me.  Remember me only to think that in the hills
of Derby, a sword is at your service, without reward and without price.
Should you ever need it, Joan, tell me that you will send for me -- wilt
promise me that, Joan ?"
<P>
"I promise, Norman of Torn."
<P>
"Farewell," he said, and as he again kissed her hand he bent his knee to
the ground in reverence.  Then he rose to go, pressing a little packet into
her palm.  Their eyes met, and the man saw, in that brief instant, deep in
the azure depths of the girl's that which tumbled the structure of his
new-found complacency about his ears.
<P>
As he rode out into the bright sunlight upon the road which led northwest
toward Derby, Norman of Torn bowed his head in sorrow, for he realized two
things.  One was that the girl he had left still loved him, and that some
day, mayhap tomorrow, she would suffer because she had sent him away; and
the other was that he did not love her, that his heart was locked in the
fair breast of Bertrade de Montfort.
<P>
He felt himself a beast that he had allowed his loneliness and the aching
sorrow of his starved, empty heart to lead him into this girl's life.  That
he had been new to women and newer still to love did not permit him to
excuse himself, and a hundred times he cursed his folly and stupidity, and
what he thought was fickleness.
<P>
But the unhappy affair had taught him one thing for certain: to know
without question what love was, and that the memory of Bertrade de
Montfort's lips would always be more to him than all the allurements
possessed by the balance of the women of the world, no matter how charming,
or how beautiful.
<P>
Another thing, a painful thing he had learned from it, too, that the
attitude of Joan de Tany, daughter of an old and noble house, was but the
attitude which the Outlaw of Torn must expect from any good woman of her
class; what he must expect from Bertrade de Montfort when she learned that
Roger de Conde was Norman of Torn.
<P>
The outlaw had scarce passed out of sight upon the road to Derby ere the
girl, who still stood in an embrasure of the south tower, gazing with
strangely drawn, sad face up the road which had swallowed him, saw a body
of soldiers galloping rapidly toward Tany from the south.
<P>
The King's banner waved above their heads, and intuitively, Joan de Tany
knew for whom they sought at her father's castle.  Quickly she hastened to
the outer barbican that it might be she who answered their hail rather than
one of the men-at-arms on watch there.
<P>
She had scarcely reached the ramparts of the outer gate ere the King's men
drew rein before the castle.
<P>
In reply to their hail, Joan de Tany asked their mission.
<P>
"We seek the outlaw, Norman of Torn, who hides now within this castle,"
replied the officer.
<P>
"There be no outlaw here," replied the girl, "but, if you wish, you may
enter with half a dozen men and search the castle."
<P>
This the officer did and, when he had assured himself that Norman of Torn
was not within, an hour had passed, and Joan de Tany felt certain that the
Outlaw of Torn was too far ahead to be caught by the King's men; so she
said:
<P>
"There was one here just before you came who called himself though by
another name than Norman of Torn.  Possibly it is he ye seek."
<P>
"Which way rode he ?" cried the officer.
<P>
"Straight toward the west by the middle road," lied Joan de Tany.  And, as
the officer hurried from the castle and, with his men at his back, galloped
furiously away toward the west, the girl sank down upon a bench, pressing
her little hands to her throbbing temples.
<P>
Then she opened the packet which Norman of Torn had handed her, and within
found two others.  In one of these was a beautiful jeweled locket, and on
the outside were the initials JT, and on the inside the initials NT; in the
other was a golden hair ornament set with precious stones, and about it was
wound a strand of her own silken tresses.
<P>
She looked long at the little trinkets and then, pressing them against her
lips, she threw herself face down upon an oaken bench, her lithe young form
racked with sobs.
<P>
She was indeed but a little girl chained by the inexorable bonds of caste
to a false ideal.  Birth and station spelled honor to her, and honor, to
the daughter of an English noble, was a mightier force even than love.
<P>
That Norman of Torn was an outlaw she might have forgiven, but that he was,
according to report, a low fellow of no birth placed an impassable barrier
between them.
<P>
For hours the girl lay sobbing upon the bench, whilst within her raged the
mighty battle of the heart against the head.
<P>
Thus her mother found her, and kneeling beside her, and with her arms about
the girl's neck, tried to soothe her and to learn the cause of her sorrow.
Finally it came, poured from the flood gates of a sorrowing heart; that
wave of bitter misery and hopelessness which not even a mother's love could
check.
<P>
"Joan, my dear daughter," cried Lady de Tany, "I sorrow with thee that thy
love has been cast upon so bleak and impossible a shore.  But it be better
that thou hast learnt the truth ere it were too late; for, take my word
upon it, Joan, the bitter humiliation such an alliance must needs have
brought upon thee and thy father's house would soon have cooled thy love;
nor could his have survived the sneers and affronts even the menials would
have put upon him."
<P>
"Oh, mother, but I love him so," moaned the girl.  "I did not know how much
until he had gone, and the King's officer had come to search for him, and
then the thought that all the power of a great throne and the mightiest
houses of an entire kingdom were turned in hatred against him raised the
hot blood of anger within me and the knowledge of my love surged through
all my being.  Mother, thou canst not know the honor, and the bravery, and
the chivalry of the man as I do.  Not since Arthur of Silures kept his
round table hath ridden forth upon English soil so true a knight as Norman
man of Torn.
<P>
"Couldst thou but have seen him fight, my mother, and witnessed the honor
of his treatment of thy daughter, and heard the tone of dignified respect
in which he spoke of women thou wouldst have loved him, too, and felt that
outlaw though he be, he is still more a gentleman than nine-tenths the
nobles of England."
<P>
"But his birth, my daughter !" argued the Lady de Tany.  "Some even say
that the gall marks of his brass collar still showeth upon his neck, and
others that he knoweth not himself the name of his own father, nor had he
any mother."
<P>
Ah, but this was the mighty argument !  Naught could the girl say to
justify so heinous a crime as low birth.  What a man did in those rough
cruel days might be forgotten and forgiven but the sins of his mother or
his grandfather in not being of noble blood, no matter howsoever wickedly
attained, he might never overcome or live down.
<P>
Torn by conflicting emotions, the poor girl dragged herself to her own
apartment and there upon a restless, sleepless couch, beset by wild,
impossible hopes, and vain, torturing regrets, she fought out the long,
bitter night; until toward morning she solved the problem of her misery in
the only way that seemed possible to her poor, tired, bleeding, little
heart.  When the rising sun shone through the narrow window, it found Joan
de Tany at peace with all about her; the carved golden hilt of the toy that
had hung at her girdle protruded from her breast, and a thin line of
crimson ran across the snowy skin to a little pool upon the sheet beneath
her.
<P>
And so the cruel hand of a mighty revenge had reached out to crush another
innocent victim.
