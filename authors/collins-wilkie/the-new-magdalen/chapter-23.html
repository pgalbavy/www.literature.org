<P>
THE narrative leaves Julian and Mercy for a while, and, ascending
to the upper regions of the house, follows the march of events in
Lady Janet's room.
<P>
The maid had delivered her mistress's note to Mercy, and had gone
away again on her second errand to Grace Roseberry in her
boudoir. Lady Janet was seated at her writing-table, waiting for
the appearance of the woman whom she had summoned to her
presence. A single lamp difused its mild light over the books,
pictures, and busts round her, leaving the further end of the
room, in which the bed was placed, almost lost in obscurity. The
works of art were all portraits; the books were all presentation
copies from the authors. It was Lady Janet's fancy to associate
her bedroom with memorials of the various persons whom she had
known in the long course of her life--all of them more or less
distinguished, most of them, by this time, gathered with the
dead.
<P>
She sat near her writing-table, lying back in her easy-chair--the
living realization of the picture which Julian's description had
drawn. Her eyes were fixed on a photographic likeness of Mercy,
which was so raised upon a little gilt easel as to enable her to
contemplate it under the full light of the lamp. The bright,
mobile old face was strangely and sadly changed. The brow was
fixed; the mouth was rigid; the whole face would have been like a
mask, molded in the hardest forms of passive resistance and
surpressed rage, but for the light and life still thrown over it
by the eyes. There was something unutterably touching in the keen
hungering tenderness of the look which they fixed on the
portrait, intensified by an underlying expression of fond and
patient reproach. The danger which Julian so wisely dreaded was
in the rest of the face; the love which he had so truly described
was in the eyes alone. _They_ still spoke of the cruelly profaned
affection which had been the one immeasurable joy, the one
inexhaustible hope of Lady Janet's closing life. The brow
expressed nothing but her obstinate determination to stand by the
wreck of that joy, to rekindle the dead ashes of that hope. The
lips were only eloquent of her unflinching resolution to ignore
the hateful present and to save the sacred past. "My idol may be
shattered, but none of you shall know it. I stop the march of
discovery; I extinguish the light of truth. I am deaf to your
words; am blind to your proofs. At seventy years old, my idol is
my life. It shall be my idol still."
<P>
<P>
<P>
The silence in the bedroom was broken by a murmuring of women's
voices outside the door.
<P>
Lady Janet instantly raised herself in the chair and snatched the
photograph off the easel. She laid the portrait face downward,
among some papers on the table, then abruptly changed her mind,
and hid it among the thick folds of lace which clothed her neck
and bosom. There was a world of love in the action itself, and in
the sudden softening of the eyes which accompanied it. The next
moment Lady Janet's mask was on. Any superficial observer who had
seen her now would have said, "This is a hard woman!"
<P>
The door was opened by the maid. Grace Roseberry entered the
room.
<P>
She advanced rapidly, with a defiant assurance in her manner, and
a lofty carriage of her head. She sat down in the chair, to which
Lady Janet silently pointed, with a thump; she returned Lady
Janet's grave bow with a nod and a smile. Every movement and
every look of the little, worn, white-faced, shabbily dressed
woman expressed insolent triumph, and said, as if in words, "My
turn has come!"
<P>
"I am glad to wait on your ladyship," she began, without giving
Lady Janet an opportunity of speaking first. "Indeed, I should
have felt it my duty to request an interview, if you had not sent
your maid to invite me up here."
<P>
"You would have felt it your duty to request an interview?" Lady
Janet repeated, very quietly. "Why?"
<P>
The tone in which that one last word was spoken embarrassed Grace
at the outset. It established as great a distance between Lady
Janet and herself as if she had been lifted in her chair and
conveyed bodily to the other end of the room.
<P>
"I am surprised that your ladyship should not understand me," she
said, struggling to conceal her confusion. "Especially after your
kind offer of your own boudoir."
<P>
Lady Janet remained perfectly unmoved. "I do _not_ understand
you," she answered, just as quietly as ever.
<P>
Grace's temper came to her assistance. She recovered the
assurance which had marked her first appearance on the scene.
<P>
"In that case," she resumed, "I must enter into particulars, in
justice to myself. I can place but one interpretation on the
extraordinary change in your ladyship's behavior to me
downstairs. The conduct of that abominable woman has at last
opened your eyes to the deception that has been practiced on you.
For some reason of your own, however, you have not yet chosen to
recognize me openly. In this painful position something is due to
my own self-respect. I cannot, and will not, permit Mercy Merrick
to claim the merit of restoring me to my proper place in this
house. After what I have suffered it is quite impossible for me
to endu re that. I should have requested an interview (if you had
not sent for me) for the express purpose of claiming this
person's immediate expulsion from the house. I claim it now as a
proper concession to Me. Whatever you or Mr. Julian Gray may do,
_I_ will not tamely permit her to exhibit herself as an
interesting penitent. It is really a little too much to hear this
brazen adventuress appoint her own time for explaining herself.
It is too deliberately insulting to see her sail out of the
room--with a clergyman of the Church of England opening the door
for her--as if she was laying me under an obligation! I can
forgive much, Lady Janet--including the terms in which you
thought it decent to order me out of your house. I am quite
willing to accept the offer of your boudoir, as the expression on
your part of a better frame of mind. But even Christian Charity
has its limits. The continued presence of that wretch under your
roof is, you will permit me to remark, not only a monument of
your own weakness, but a perfectly insufferable insult to Me."
<P>
There she stopped abruptly--not for want of words, but for want
of a listener.
<P>
Lady Janet was not even pretending to attend to her. Lady Janet,
with a deliberate rudeness entirely foreign to her usual habits,
was composedly busying herself in arranging the various papers
scattered about the table. Some she tied together with little
morsels of string; some she placed under paper-weights; some she
deposited in the fantastic pigeon-holes of a little Japanese
cabinet--working with a placid enjoyment of her own orderly
occupation, and perfectly unaware, to all outward appearance,
that any second person was in the room. She looked up, with her
papers in both hands, when Grace stopped, and said, quietly,
<P>
"Have you done?"
<P>
"Is your ladyship's purpose in sending for me to treat me with
studied rudeness?" Grace retorted, angrily.
<P>
"My purpose in sending for you is to say something as soon as you
will allow me the opportunity."
<P>
The impenetrable composure of that reply took Grace completely by
surprise. She had no retort ready. In sheer astonishment she
waited silently with her eyes riveted on the mistress of the
house.
<P>
Lady Janet put down her papers, and settled herself comfortably
in the easy-chair, preparatory to opening the interview on her
side.
<P>
"The little that I have to say to you," she began, "may be said
in a question. Am I right in supposing that you have no present
employment, and that a little advance in money (delicately
offered) would be very acceptable to you?"
<P>
"Do you mean to insult me, Lady Janet?"
<P>
"Certainly not. I mean to ask you a question."
<P>
"Your question is an insult."
<P>
"My question is a kindness, if you will only understand it as it
is intended. I don't complain of your not understanding it. I
don't even hold you responsible for any one of the many breaches
of good manners which you have committed since you have been in
this room. I was honestly anxious to be of some service to you,
and you have repelled my advances. I am sorry. Let us drop the
subject."
<P>
Expressing herself in the most perfect temper in those terms,
Lady Janet resumed the arrangement of her papers, and became
unconscious once more of the presence of any second person in the
room.
<P>
Grace opened her lips to reply with the utmost intemperance of an
angry woman, and thinking better of it, controlled herself. It
was plainly useless to take the violent way with Lady Janet Roy.
Her age and her social position were enough of themselves to
repel any violence. She evidently knew that, and trusted to it.
Grace resolved to meet the enemy on the neutral ground of
politeness, as the most promising ground that she could occupy
under present circumstances.
<P>
"If I have said anything hasty, I beg to apologize to your
ladyship," she began. "May I ask if your only object in sending
for me was to inquire into my pecuniary affairs, with a view to
assisting me?"
<P>
"That," said Lady Janet, "was my only object."
<P>
"You had nothing to say to me on the subject of Mercy Merrick?"
<P>
"Nothing whatever. I am weary of hearing of Mercy Merrick. Have
you any more questions to ask me?"
<P>
"I have one more."
<P>
"Yes?"
<P>
"I wish to ask your ladyship whether you propose to recognize me
in the presence of your household as the late Colonel Roseberry's
daughter?"
<P>
"I have already recognized you as a lady in embarrassed
circumstances, who has peculiar claims on my consideration and
forbearance. If you wish me to repeat those words in the presence
of the servants (absurd as it is), I am ready to comply with your
request."
<P>
Grace's temper began to get the better of her prudent
resolutions.
<P>
"Lady Janet!" she said; "this won't do. I must request you to
express yourself plainly. You talk of my peculiar claims on your
forbearance. What claims do you mean?"
<P>
"It will be painful to both of us if we enter into details,"
replied Lady Janet. "Pray don't let us enter into details."
<P>
"I insist on it, madam."
<P>
"Pray don't insist on it."
<P>
Grace was deaf to remonstrance.
<P>
"I ask you in plain words," she went on, "do you acknowledge that
you have been deceived by an adventuress who has personated me?
Do you mean to restore me to my proper place in this house?"
<P>
Lady Janet returned to the arrangement of her papers.
<P>
"Does your ladyship refuse to listen to me?"
<P>
Lady Janet looked up from her papers as blandly as ever.
<P>
"If _you_ persist in returning to your delusion," she said, "you
will oblige _me_ to persist in returning to my papers."
<P>
"What is my delusion, if you please?"
<P>
"Your delusion is expressed in the questions you have just put to
me. Your delusion constitutes your peculiar claim on my
forbearance. Nothing you can say or do will shake my forbearance.
When I first found you in the dining-room, I acted most
improperly; I lost my temper. I did worse; I was foolish enough
and imprudent enough to send for a police officer. I owe you
every possible atonement (afflicted as you are) for treating you
in that cruel manner. I offered you the use of my boudoir, as
part of my atonement. I sent for you, in the hope that you would
allow me to assist you, as part of my atonement. You may behave
rudely to me, you may speak in the most abusive terms of my
adopted daughter; I will submit to anything, as part of my
atonement. So long as you abstain from speaking on one painful
subject, I will listen to you with the greatest pleasure.
Whenever you return to that subject I shall return to my papers."
<P>
Grace looked at Lady Janet with an evil smile.
<P>
"I begin to understand your ladyship," she said. "You are ashamed
to acknowledge that you have been grossly imposed upon. Your only
alternative, of course, is to ignore everything that has
happened. Pray count on _my_ forbearance. I am not at all
offended--I am merely amused. It is not every day that a lady of
high rank exhibits herself in such a position as yours to an
obscure woman like me. Your humane consideration for me dates, I
presume, from the time when your adopted daughter set you the
example, by ordering the police officer out of the room?"
<P>
Lady Janet's composure was proof even against this assault on it.
She gravely accepted Grace's inquiry as a question addressed to
her in perfect good faith.
<P>
"I am not at all surprised," she replied, "to find that my
adopted daughter's interference has exposed her to
misrepresentation. She ought to have remonstrated with me
privately before she interfered. But she has one fault--she is
too impulsive. I have never, in all my experience, met with such
a warm-hearted person as she is. Always too considerate of
others; always too forgetful of herself! The mere appearance of
the police officer placed you in a situation to appeal to her
compassion, and her impulses carried her away as usual. My fault!
All my fault!"
<P>
Grace changed her tone once more. She was quick enough to discern
that Lady Janet was a match for her with her own weapons.
<P>
"We have had enough of this," she said. "It is time to be
serious. Your adopted daughter (as you call her) is Mercy
Merrick, and you know it."
<P>
Lady Janet returned to her papers.
<P>
"I am Grace Roseberry, whose name she has stolen, and you know
_that_."
<P>
Lady Janet went o n with her papers.
<P>
Grace got up from her chair.
<P>
"I accept your silence, Lady Janet," she said, "as an
acknowledgment of your deliberate resolution to suppress the
truth. You are evidently determined to receive the adventuress as
the true woman; and you don't scruple to face the consequences of
that proceeding, by pretending to my face to believe that I am
mad. I will not allow myself to be impudently cheated out of my
rights in this way. You will hear from me again madam, when the
Canadian mail arrives in England."
<P>
She walked toward the door. This time Lady Janet answered, as
readily and as explicitly as it was possible to desire.
<P>
"I shall refuse to receive your letters," she said.
<P>
Grace returned a few steps, threateningly.
<P>
"My letters shall be followed by my witnesses," she proceeded.
<P>
"I shall refuse to receive your witnesses."
<P>
"Refuse at your peril. I will appeal to the law."
<P>
Lady Janet smiled.
<P>
"I don't pretend to much knowledge of the subject," she said;
"but I should be surprised indeed if I discovered that you had
any claim on me which the law could enforce. However, let us
suppose that you _can_ set the law in action. You know as well as
I do that the only motive power which can do that is--money. I am
rich; fees, costs, and all the rest of it are matters of no sort
of consequence to me. May I ask if you are in the same position?"
<P>
The question silenced Grace. So far as money was concerned, she
was literally at the end of her resources. Her only friends were
friends in Canada. After what she had said to him in the boudoir,
it would be quite useless to appeal to the sympathies of Julian
Gray. In the pecuniary sense, and in one word, she was absolutely
incapable of gratifying her own vindictive longings. And there
sat the mistress of Mablethorpe House, perfectly well aware of
it.
<P>
Lady Janet pointed to the empty chair.
<P>
"Suppose you sit down again?" she suggested. "The course of our
interview seems to have brought us back to the question that I
asked you when you came into my room. Instead of threatening me
with the law, suppose you consider the propriety of permitting me
to be of some use to you. I am in the habit of assisting ladies
in embarrassed circumstances, and nobody knows of it but my
steward--who keeps the accounts--and myself. Once more, let me
inquire if a little advance of the pecuniary sort (delicately
offered) would be acceptable to you?"
<P>
Grace returned slowly to the chair that she had left. She stood
by it, with one hand grasping the top rail, and with her eyes
fixed in mocking scrutiny on Lady Janet's face.
<P>
"At last your ladyship shows your hand," she said. "Hush-money!"
<P>
"You _will_ send me back to my papers," rejoined Lady Janet. "How
obstinate you are!"
<P>
Grace's hand closed tighter and tighter round the rail of the
chair. Without witnesses, without means, without so much as a
refuge--thanks to her own coarse cruelties of language and
conduct-- in the sympathies of others, the sense of her isolation
and her helplessness was almost maddening at that final moment. A
woman of finer sensibilities would have instantly left the room.
Grace's impenetrably hard and narrow mind impelled her to meet
the emergency in a very different way. A last base vengeance, to
which Lady Janet had voluntarily exposed herself, was still
within her reach. "For the present," she thought, "there is but
one way of being even with your ladyship. I can cost you as much
as possible."
<P>
"Pray make some allowances for me," she said. "I am not
obstinate--I am only a little awkward at matching the audacity of
a lady of high rank. I shall improve with practice. My own
language is, as I am painfully aware, only plain English. Permit
me to withdraw it, and to substitute yours. What advance is your
ladyship (delicately) prepared to offer me?"
<P>
Lady Janet opened a drawer, and took out her check-book.
<P>
The moment of relief had come at last! The only question now left
to discuss was evidently the question of amount. Lady Janet
considered a little. The question of amount was (to her mind) in
some sort a question of conscience as well. Her love for Mercy
and her loathing for Grace, her horror of seeing her darling
degraded and her affection profaned by a public exposure, had
hurried her--there was no disputing it--into treating an injured
woman harshly. Hateful as Grace Roseberry might be, her father
had left her, in his last moments, with Lady Janet's full
concurrence, to Lady Janet's care. But for Mercy she would have
been received at Mablethorpe House as Lady Janet's companion,
with a salary of one hundred pounds a year. On the other hand,
how long (with such a temper as she had revealed) would Grace
have remained in the service of her protectress? She would
probably have been dismissed in a few weeks, with a year's salary
to compensate her, and with a recommendation to some suitable
employment. What would be a fair compensation now? Lady Janet
decided that five years' salary immediately given, and future
assistance rendered if necessary, would represent a fit
remembrance of the late Colonel Roseberry's claims, and a liberal
pecuniary acknowledgment of any harshness of treatment which
Grace might have sustained at her hands. At the same time, and
for the further satisfying of her own conscience, she determined
to discover the sum which Grace herself would consider sufficient
by the simple process of making Grace herself propose the terms.
<P>
"It is impossible for me to make you an offer," she said, "for
this reason--your need of money will depend greatly on your
future plans. I am quite ignorant of your future plans.''
<P>
"Perhaps your ladyship will kindly advise me?" said Grace,
satirically.
<P>
"I cannot altogether undertake to advise you," Lady Janet
replied. "I can only suppose that you will scarcely remain in
England, where you have no friends. Whether you go to law with me
or not, you will surely feel the necessity of communicating
personally with your friends in Canada. Am I right?"
<P>
Grace was quite quick enough to understand this as it was meant.
Properly interpreted, the answer signified--"If you take your
compensation in money, it is understood, as part of the bargain
that you don't remain in England to annoy me."
<P>
"Your ladyship is quite right," she said. "I shall certainly not
remain in England. I shall consult my friends--and," she added,
mentally, "go to law with you afterward, if I possibly can, with
your own money!"
<P>
"You will return to Canada," Lady Janet proceeded; "and your
prospects there will be, probably, a little uncertain at first.
Taking this into consideration, at what amount do you estimate,
in your own mind, the pecuniary assistance which you will
require?"
<P>
"May I count on your ladyship's, kindness to correct me if my own
ignorant calculations turn out to be wrong?" Grace asked,
innocently.
<P>
Here again the words, properly interpreted, had a special
signification of their own: "It is stipulated, on my part, that I
put myself up to auction, and that my estimate shall be regulated
by your ladyship's highest bid." Thoroughly understanding the
stipulation, Lady Janet bowed, and waited gravely.
<P>
Gravely, on her side, Grace began.
<P>
"I am afraid I should want more than a hundred pounds," she said.
<P>
Lady Janet made her first bid. "I think so too."
<P>
"More, perhaps, than two hundred?"
<P>
Lady Janet made her second bid. "Probably."
<P>
"More than three hundred? Four hundred? Five hundred?"
<P>
Lady Janet made her highest bid. "Five hundred pounds will do,"
she said.
<P>
In spite of herself, Grace's rising color betrayed her
ungovernable excitement. From her earliest childhood she had been
accustomed to see shillings and sixpences carefully considered
before they were parted with. She had never known her father to
possess so much as five golden sovereigns at his own disposal
(unencumbered by debt) in all her experience of him. The
atmosphere in which she had lived and breathed was the
all-stifling one of genteel poverty. There was something horrible
in the greedy eagerness of her eyes as they watched Lady Janet,
to see if she was really sufficiently in earnest to give away
five hundred pounds sterling with  a stroke of her pen.
<P>
Lady Janet wrote t he check in a few seconds, and pushed it
across the table.
<P>
Grace's hungry eyes devoured the golden line, "Pay to myself or
bearer five hundred pounds," and verified the signature beneath,
"Janet Roy." Once sure of the money whenever she chose to take
it, the native meanness of her nature instantly asserted itself.
She tossed her head, and let the check lie on the table, with an
overacted appearance of caring very little whether she took it or
not.
<P>
"Your ladyship is not to suppose that I snap at your check," she
said.
<P>
Lady Janet leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes. The very
sight of Grace Roseberry sickened her. Her mind filled suddenly
with the image of Mercy. She longed to feast her eyes again on
that grand beauty, to fill her ears again with the melody of that
gentle voice.
<P>
"I require time to consider--in justice to my own self-respect,"
Grace went on.
<P>
Lady Janet wearily made a sign, granting time to consider.
<P>
"Your ladyship's boudoir is, I presume, still at my disposal?"
<P>
Lady Janet silently granted the boudoir.
<P>
"And your ladyship's servants are at my orders, if I have
occasion to employ them?"
<P>
Lady Janet suddenly opened her eyes. "The whole household is at
your orders," she cried, furiously. "Leave me!"
<P>
Grace was far from being offended. If anything, she was
gratified-- there was a certain triumph in having stung Lady
Janet into an open outbreak of temper. She insisted forthwith on
another condition.
<P>
"In the event of my deciding to receive the check," she said, "I
cannot, consistently with my own self-respect, permit it to be
delivered to me otherwise than inclosed. Your ladyship will (if
necessary) be so kind as to inclose it. Good-evening."
<P>
She sauntered to the door, looking from side to side, with an air
of supreme disparagement, at the priceless treasures of art which
adorned the walls. Her eyes dropped superciliously on the carpet
(the design of a famous French painter), as if her feet
condescended in walking over it. The audacity with which she had
entered the room had been marked enough; it shrank to nothing
before the infinitely superior proportions of the insolence with
which she left it.
<P>
The instant the door was closed Lady Janet rose from her chair.
Reckless of the wintry chill in the outer air, she threw open one
of the windows. "Pah!" she exclaimed, with a shudder of disgust,
"the very air of the room is tainted by her!"
<P>
She returned to her chair. Her mood changed as she sat down
again--her heart was with Mercy once more. "Oh, my love!" she
murmured "how low I have stooped, how miserably I have degraded
myself--and all for You!" The bitterness of the retrospect was
unendurable. The inbred force of the woman's nature took refuge
from it in an outburst of defiance and despair. "Whatever she has
done, that wretch deserves it! Not a living creature in this
house shall say she has deceived me. She has _not_ deceived
me--she loves me! What do I care whether she has given me her
true name or not! She has given me her true heart. What right had
Julian to play upon her feelings and pry into her secrets? My
poor, tempted, tortured child! I won't hear her confession. Not
another word shall she say to any living creature. I am
mistress--I will forbid it at once!" She snatched a sheet of
notepaper from the case; hesitated, and threw it from her on the
table. "Why not send for my darling?" she thought. "Why write?"
She hesitated once more, and resigned the idea. "No! I can't
trust myself! I daren't see her yet!"
<P>
She took up the sheet of paper again, and wrote her second
message to Mercy. This time the note began fondly with a familiar
form of address.
<P>
"MY DEAR CHILD--I have had time to think and compose myself a
little, since I last wrote, requesting you to defer the
explanation which you had promised me. I already understand (and
appreciate) the motives which led you to interfere as you did
downstairs, and I now ask you to entirely abandon the
explanation. It will, I am sure, be painful to you (for reasons
of your own into which I have no wish to inquire) to produce the
person of whom you spoke, and as you know already, I myself am
weary of hearing of her. Besides, there is really no need now for
you to explain anything. The stranger whose visits here have
caused us so much pain and anxiety will trouble us no more. She
leaves England of her own free will, after a conversation with me
which has perfectly succeeded in composing and satisfying her.
Not a word more, my dear, to me, or to my nephew, or to any other
human creature, of what has happened in the dining-room to-day.
When we next meet, let it be understood between us that the past
is henceforth and forever _buried to oblivion_. This is not only
the earnest request--it is, if necessary, the positive command,
of your mother and friend,
                JANET ROY.
<P>
"P.S.--I shall find opportunities (before you leave your room) of
speaking separately to my nephew and to Horace Holmcroft. You
need dread no embarrassment, when you next meet them. I will not
ask you to answer my note in writing. Say yes to the maid who
will bring it to you, and I shall know we understand each other."
<P>
<P>
<P>
After sealing the envelope which inclosed these lines, Lady Janet
addressed it, as usual, to "Miss Grace Roseberry." She was just
rising to ring the bell, when the maid appeared with a message
from the boudoir. The woman's tones and looks showed plainly that
she had been made the object of Grace's insolent self-assertion
as well as her mistress.
<P>
"If you please, my lady, the person downstairs wishes--"
<P>
Lady Janet, frowning contemptuously, interrupted the message at
the outset . "I know what the person downstairs wishes. She has
sent you for a letter from me?"
<P>
"Yes, my lady."
<P>
"Anything more?"
<P>
" She has sent one of the men-servants, my lady, for a cab. If
your ladyship had only heard how she spoke to him!"
<P>
Lady Janet intimated by a sign that she would rather not hear.
She at once inclosed the check in an undirected envelope.
<P>
"Take that to her," she said, "and then come back to me."
<P>
Dismissing Grace Roseberry from all further consideration, Lady
Janet sat, with her letter to Mercy in her hand, reflecting on
her position, and on the efforts which it might still demand from
her. Pursuing this train of thought, it now occurred to her that
accident might bring Horace and Mercy together at any moment, and
that, in Horace's present frame of mind, he would certainly
insist on the very explanation which it was the foremost interest
of her life to suppress. The dread of this disaster was in full
possession of her when the maid returned.
<P>
"Where is Mr. Holmcroft?" she asked, the moment the woman entered
the room.
<P>
"I saw him open the library door, my lady, just now, on my way
upstairs."
<P>
"Was he alone?"
<P>
"Yes, my lady."
<P>
"Go to him, and say I want to see him here immediately."
<P>
The maid withdrew on her second errand. Lady Janet rose
restlessly, and closed the open window. Her impatient desire to
make sure of Horace so completely mastered her that she left her
room, and met the woman in the corridor on her return. Receiving
Horace's message of excuse, she instantly sent back the
peremptory rejoinder, "Say that he will oblige me to go to him,
if be persists in refusing to come to me. And, stay!" she added,
remembering the undelivered letter. "Send Miss Roseberry's maid
here; I want her."
<P>
Left alone again, Lady Janet paced once or twice up and down the
corridor--then grew suddenly weary of the sight of it, and went
back to her room. The two maids returned together. One of them,
having announced Horace's submission, was dismissed. The other
was sent to Mercy's room with Lady Janet's letter. In a minute or
two the messenger appeared again, with the news that she had
found the room empty.
<P>
"Have you any idea where Miss Roseberry is?"
<P>
"No, my lady."
<P>
Lady Janet reflected for a moment. If Horace presented himself
without any needless delay, the plain inference would he that she
had succeeded in separating him from Mercy. If his appearance was
suspiciously deferred, she decided on personally searching for
Mercy in the reception rooms on the lower floor of the house.
<P>
"What have you done with
 the letter?" she asked.
<P>
"I left it on Miss Roseberry's table, my lady."
<P>
"Very well. Keep within hearing of the bell, in case I want you
again."
<P>
Another minute brought Lady Janet's suspense to an end. She heard
the welcome sound of a knock at her door from a man's hand.
Horace hurriedly entered the room.
<P>
"What is it you want with me, Lady Janet?" he inquired, not very
graciously.
<P>
"Sit down, Horace, and you shall hear."
<P>
Horace did not accept the invitation. "Excuse me," he said, "if I
mention that I am rather in a hurry."
<P>
"Why are you in a hurry?"
<P>
"I have reasons for wishing to see Grace as soon as possible."
<P>
"And _I_ have reasons," Lady Janet rejoined, "for wishing to
speak to you about Grace before you see her; serious reasons. Sit
down."
<P>
Horace started. "Serious reasons?" he repeated. "You surprise
me."
<P>
"I shall surprise you still more before I have done "
<P>
Their eyes met as Lady Janet answered in those terms. Horace
observed signs of agitation in her, which he now noticed for the
first time. His face darkened with an expression of sullen
distrust--and he took the chair in silence.
