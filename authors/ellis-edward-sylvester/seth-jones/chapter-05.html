<p>"The Mohawks, you say, have then captured her?" remarked Graham,
after a moment’s pause.</p>

<p>"Yes; I know it’s them."</p>

<p>"Did you get a glimpse of them?"</p>

<p>"I came up as soon as possible, and they were leaving at that
moment. I saw one or two of them, and know’d it was them, sure
’nough. Howsumever, that don’t make no difference, whether it’s
the Mohawks, Oneidas, or any of them blasted Five Nation niggers.
They are all a set of skunks, and one would just as lief run off
with a man’s gal, as not. There ain’t any difference atwixt ’em."</p>

<p>"I suppose not. The same difficulties would have to be surmounted
in each case. The point is not whether one shall make an attempt
at a rescue, but how shall it be done. I confess I am in a maze.
The Mohawks are an exceedingly cunning people."</p>

<p>"That’s a fact, that needn’t be disputed."</p>

<p>"But then, you know, if we outwit them, we will not be the first
whites who have done such a thing in their day!"</p>

<p>"That’s a fact, too. Now, just hold on a minute, while I think."</p>

<p>Graham ceased talking for a moment, while Seth remained as if
in deep and anxious thought. Suddenly lifting up his head, he
remarked.</p>

<p>"I have it."</p>

<p>"Have what? The plan which must be pursued by us?"</p>

<p>"I cac’late I have."</p>

<p>"Well, out with it."</p>

<p>"Why, it’s this. <em>We’ve got to git that gal</em>, an’ no mistake."</p>

<p>Despite the gloominess which had been upon Graham, he could not
help laughing outright at the serious tone in which this was uttered.</p>

<p>"What are you laughing at?" indignantly demanded Seth.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought we had arrived at that conclusion long since."</p>

<p>"I didn’t think of that; so we did. Howsumever, I’ve thort further&mdash;hey,
what’s that off yonder? ’Nuther building burning?"</p>

<p>Graham gazed in the direction indicated, and saw that day was
breaking. This he remarked to his companion.</p>

<p>"Yes; so ’tis, and I’m glad of it, for we want some light on
this subject."</p>

<p>In a short time, the sun appeared above the forest, and poured
a flood of golden light over the woods and streams. Birds were
singing their morning songs in every part of the wood, and every
thing wore as gay a look, as though no deed of blood had been
committed during the night. As soon as it was sufficiently light,
Seth and Graham made their way toward the stream.</p>

<p>"As we shall shortly start," remarked the latter, "I will attend
to my horse, which I brought with me. He is not a short distance
away, and I will be back in a moment."</p>

<p>So saying, he departed in the wood. He found his horse, completely
worn out, asleep upon the ground. He unloosened his fastening,
and as there was abundant provender around, in the shape of young
and tender twigs and luxuriant grass, he removed the saddle and
bridle, and concluded to allow him free scope of the wood until
his return, trusting to the rather doubtful chances of ever recovering
him again. This done, he returned to his companion.</p>

<p>He found Seth leaning upon his rifle, and gazing meditatively
into the silent stream flowing before him. Graham looked curiously
at him a moment, and then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am ready, Seth, if you are."</p>

<p>The individual addressed, turned without a word and strode toward
the clearing. When the ruins of the house were reached, they both
halted, and in an undertone, he said:</p>

<p>"Hunt up the trail."</p>

<p>Each bent his head toward the ground, and moved in a circle around
the clearing. Suddenly Graham paused, and proceeding quickly several
yards in the wood, halted and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here it is, Seth."</p>

<p>The latter hastened to his side, and stooping a moment, and running
his eye along the ground, both forward and backward, replied:</p>

<p>"This is the trail! They ain’t very keerful ’bout it now, but
I reckon it’ll make us open our peepers wider to see it, after
we get into the wood."</p>

<p>"Well, as the starting point is now reached, we must perfect
our arrangements. You must take the lead in following this up."</p>

<p>"Can’t you?" asked Seth, looking up in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Not as well as you. From what little I have seen of you, I am
sure you excel me in the knowledge of the forest. I have had some
experience in fighting, but very little in tracing a foe through
such a wilderness as this."</p>

<p>"Don’t say? That’s just where you ’n I disagree. I was always
the one to track the tories or red-coats for old Colonel Allen,
and I remember one time&mdash;but I guess I won’t go to telling stories
now, being as I haven’t much time; but I can say, though pr’aps
I oughn’t to, that I can foller any red-skin as far as he can
go, and I don’t care how much pains he takes to cover up his tracks.
You see, if I undertake to foller this, I’ve got to keep my nose
down to the ground, and won’t be likely to see any danger we’re
running into: that’ll have to be your business. You just hang
close to my heels, and keep yer eyes traveling all over."</p>

<p>"I’ll endeavor to do my part, although I shall expect some aid
from you."</p>

<p>"I may give some, as I can tell purty near about when the imps
have gone over the tracks I’m looking at. And now we must start.
I promised Haverland that I wouldn’t show myself again, until
I could tell him something about his darter, and I swow, I won’t.
Come ahead!"</p>

<p>With these words, Seth started ahead on a rapid walk. He was
slightly inclined forward, and his keen gray eye was bent with
a searching look upon the ground. Graham followed him a few feet
distant, with the barrel of his rifle resting in the hollow of
his left arm, while the stock was held in his right so as to be
ready at a moment’s warning.</p>

<p>The signs that led Seth Jones forward were faint, and to an ordinary
observer, invisible. The Indians, although they had little fears
of pursuit, were yet too cunning and experienced to neglect any
caution that would mislead what enemies might be disposed to follow
them. They traveled in Indian file, each one stepping in the track
of the one before him, so that, judging from the tracks made,
it would appear that but a single savage had been journeying in
these parts. Ina was compelled to walk in this matter, and more
than once when she inadvertently made a misstep, a cruel blow
warned her of her task.</p>

<p>Sometimes the leaves, as they lay, appeared perfectly devoid
of the slightest depression or disturbance, yet, had one stooped
and carefully scrutinized the ground, he would have seen the faint
outlines of a moccasin defined upon it, or observed that a leaf
had been displaced, or perhaps a slender twig had not yet recovered
the position from which it had been forced by the passing of human
feet. All these were trifling indications, it is true, yet they
were unerring ones to the practiced eye of the hunter, and as
plain as the footprints upon the dusty roads. Soon Seth paused,
and raising his head, turned toward Graham.</p>

<p>"We are gaining on ’em."</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;are we? Glad to hear it. When is it probable we shall overtake
them?"</p>

<p>"Can’t exactly say, but not for a considerable time yet. They
are tramping at a purty good gate, and they only halted last night
to rest Iny now and then. Darn ’em! she’ll wan’t rest, I cac’late,
more’n once afore she’s done with ’em."</p>

<p>"Can’t you conjecture their number?"</p>

<p>"There’s somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty of the best
warriors of the Mohawks. I can tell that by their tracks."</p>

<p>"How is that? They make but a single one, do they?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, but I rayther cac’late they make that a little
different, fur all that, from what one would. Are you hungry?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, I can stand it till noon, without the least inconvenience."</p>

<p>"So can I; keep a good look-out, and now ahead again."</p>

<p>With these words, Seth again plunged in to the woods, and the
two prosecuted their journey much as before. The sun was now high
in the heavens, and its warm rays pierced the arches of the forest
at many points, and there were golden patches of light scattered
over the travelers’ path. Several times they crossed small, sparkling
streams, where sometimes could be seen signs of the pursued having
slaked their thirst, and more than once the frightened deer bounded
ahead, and paused and gazed in wonder at them, then leaped away
again. Graham could hardly resist the temptation of bringing one
of them down, especially as he began to feel a desire to taste
them; but he too well knew the danger of risking a shot, when
it might bring down their most mortal enemies in a moment upon
them.</p>

<p>All at once, Seth halted and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"What does this mean?" he asked, gazing off in a side direction
from the trail.</p>

<p>"What is it?" queried Graham, approaching him.</p>

<p>"The trail divides here. They must have separated, though I can’t
see what has made them."</p>

<p>"Isn’t it a stratagem of theirs to mislead pursuers?"</p>

<p>"I believe it is! Here, you follow the main trail, while I take
the side one, and we’ll soon see."</p>

<p>Graham did as directed, although it cost him considerable trouble
to perform his part. It proved as they expected. In a short time,
the two trails united again.</p>

<p>"We must look out for such things," remarked Seth. "I’ve got
to watch the ground closer, and you must look out that I don’t
pitch heels over head into a nest of the hornets."</p>

<p>They now proceeded cautiously and rapidly forward. About the
middle of the afternoon, they halted beside a stream of considerable
size. Seth produced a quantity of dried venison, which he had
brought with him from the settlement, and of this they made a
hearty meal. This done, they arose and again proceeded upon their
journey.</p>

<p>"See there!" said Seth, pointing to the middle of the stream.
"Do you see that stone there? Notice how it is marked, and observe
that print of a moccasin beside it. One of their number has slipped
off of it. Let us be keerful."</p>

<p>He stepped into the water, and made his way carefully across,
followed by Graham. When they stepped upon dry land again, the
shades of evening were gathering over the forest, and already
the birds had ceased their songs. There was, however, a bright
moon,&mdash;in fact, so bright, that they determined to keep up their
pursuit.</p>

<p>The progress was now necessarily tardy, as it required the utmost
straining of Seth’s vision to keep the trail, and had it not been
for the friendly openings in the wood, where it was as plain as
at mid-day, they would have been compelled to abandon it altogether
until the morning. Several times, Graham was compelled to stand,
while Seth, almost on his hands and knees, searched out the "signs."
They came across no evidence of the Indians having encamped, and
judged from this, that they either intended reaching their tribe
before doing so, or that they were somewhere in the vicinity.
The latter was the most probable supposition, and prudence, demanded
them to be cautious and deliberate in their movements.</p>

<p>Suddenly Graham noticed the woods appeared to be growing thinner
and lighter in front, as though an opening was at hand. He called
the attention of Seth to this, who remarked that it was very probable.
In a few moments they heard a noise as of flowing water, and immediately
after stood upon the bank of a large creek, or more properly a
river. The current was quite rapid, yet without much hesitation,
they plunged boldly in and swam across. The night being warm and
moderate, they suffered little inconvenience from their wet and
clinging clothes, as the exercise of walking kept them sufficiently
warm.</p>

<p>As they ascended the bank, they stood upon a vast and treeless
plain over which the trail led.</p>

<p>"Must we cross this?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"I don’t see any other way. There ain’t any chance to skirt it,
’cause it appears to run up and down about four thousand three
hundred miles, while you can see the other side."</p>

<p>This was true&mdash;that is the latter part of his assertion. The
plain before them, from all appearances, was a prairie of great
length, but comparatively narrow breadth. The dark line of the
woods upon the opposite side could be plainly seen, and did not
appear more than a good hour’s walk away.</p>

<p>"I don’t see any other way," repeated Seth, musingly to himself.
"It’s got to be crossed, although it’s a ticklish business, I
swow!"</p>

<p>"Would it be better to wait until morning?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"Why so?"</p>

<p>"We may walk into danger without seeing it, in the night."</p>

<p>"And how do you s’pose we’re going to walk over here in daylight,
without being targets for all the Ingins that are a mind to crack
away at us?"</p>

<p>"Can we not pass around it?"</p>

<p>"Stars and garters! hain’t I told you it reaches five thousand
miles each way, and it would take us three years to get half-way
round?"</p>

<p>"I was not aware that you had given me such interesting information,
until just now; but, as such is the case, of course nothing is
left for us but to move forward, without losing time talking."</p>

<p>"The trail goes purty straight," said Seth, turning and looking
at the ground, "and I’ve no doubt it heads straight across to
the other end. Hope so, ’cause it’ll be convenient."</p>

<p>"You must help me keep watch," said Graham, "you will not need
to watch the ground all the time, and you will need to keep a
look out elsewhere."</p>

<p>As might naturally be supposed, our two friends, although quite
experienced backwoodsmen, had miscalculated the distance to the
opposite side of the prairie. It was full midnight, ere they reached
its margin.</p>

<p>All was as silent as death, as they cautiously and stealthily
entered the wood again. Not a breath of wind stirred the boughs
on the tree-tops, and the soft murmur of the river had long died
away into silence. There were a few flying clouds that obscured
the moon at intervals, and rendered its light uncertain and treacherous.
Seth still pressed forward. They had gone a few hundred yards,
when they heard voices! Cautiously and silently they still picked
their way, and soon saw the light of fire, reflected against the
uppermost limbs of the trees. The fire itself was invisible, although
it could not be far distant. Seth whispered for Graham to remain
quiet, while he moved forward. He then stepped carefully ahead,
and soon reached a massive natural embankment, up which on his
hands and knees he crawled. He peered carefully over this and
saw, down in a sort of hollow, the whole Indian encampment! There
were over twenty gathered around, most of whom were extended upon
the ground asleep, while several sat listlessly smoking and gazing
into the fire. Seth looked but a moment, as he knew there were
watchful sentinels, and it was fortunate that he had not been
discovered, as it was. Carefully retreating, he made his way down
again to Graham.</p>

<p>"What’s the news?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"&mdash;sh! not so loud. They’re all there."</p>

<p>"<em>She</em>, too?"</p>

<p>"I s’pose, though I didn’t see her."</p>

<p>"What do you intend doing?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know. We can’t do nothin’ to-night; it’s too near morning.
If we could git her, we couldn’t get a good ’nough start to give
us a chance. We’ve got to wait till to-morrow night. There’s a
lot of ’em on the watch too. We’ve got to lay low till daylight,
and foller ’long behind ’em."</p>

<p>The two made their way off in a side direction, so as not to
be likely to attract notice in the morning, should any of the
savages take the back trail. Here they remained until daylight.</p>

<p>They heard the Indians, as soon as it was fully light, preparing
their morning meal; and, as they deemed they could see them without
incurring great peril, they determined to obtain a glimpse of
them, in order to assure themselves whether Ina was among them
or not. Each had suspicion the company had separated, and that
their trail had been overlooked in the darkness.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two crept noiselessly to the top. There was
a heavy, peculiar sort of brier growing on the summit of the embankment,
which was fortunately so impenetrable as to effectually conceal
their bodies. Seth pressed against this and peered over. His head
just came above the undergrowth, and he could plainly see all
that was transpiring. Graham, with an unfortunate want of discretion,
placed his arm on Seth’s shoulder, and <em>gazed over him</em>!
Yet singularly enough, neither was seen. Graham was just in the
act of lowering his head, when the briers, which were so matted
together as to hold the pressure against them like a woven band,
gave way, and Seth rolled like a log down the embankment, directly
among the savages!</p>
