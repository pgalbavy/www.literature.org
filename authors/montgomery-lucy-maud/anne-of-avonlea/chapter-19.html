<P>
"After all," Anne had said to Marilla once, "I believe the nicest and
sweetest days are not those on which anything very splendid or wonderful
or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures,
following one another softly, like pearls slipping off a string."
<P>
Life at Green Gables was full of just such days, for Anne's adventures
and misadventures, like those of other people, did not all happen at once,
but were sprinkled over the year, with long stretches of harmless, happy
days between, filled with work and dreams and laughter and lessons.
Such a day came late in August.  In the forenoon Anne and Diana rowed
the delighted twins down the pond to the sandshore to pick "sweet grass"
and paddle in the surf, over which the wind was harping an old lyric
learned when the world was young.
<P>
In the afternoon Anne walked down to the old Irving place to see Paul.
She found him stretched out on the grassy bank beside the thick fir
grove that sheltered the house on the north, absorbed in a book of
fairy tales.  He sprang up radiantly at sight of her.
<P>
"Oh, I'm so glad you've come, teacher," he said eagerly, "because
Grandma's away.  You'll stay and have tea with me, won't you?
It's so lonesome to have tea all by oneself.  YOU know, teacher.
I've had serious thoughts of asking Young Mary Joe to sit down
and eat her tea with me, but I expect Grandma wouldn't approve.
She says the French have to be kept in their place.  And anyhow,
it's difficult to talk with Young Mary Joe.  She just laughs and says,
`Well, yous do beat all de kids I ever knowed.'  That isn't my idea
of conversation."
<P>
"Of course I'll stay to tea," said Anne gaily.  "I was dying to be
asked.  My mouth has been watering for some more of your grandma's
delicious shortbread ever since I had tea here before."
<P>
Paul looked very sober.
<P>
"If it depended on me, teacher," he said, standing before Anne with
his hands in his pockets and his beautiful little face shadowed with
sudden care, "You should have shortbread with a right good will.
But it depends on Mary Joe.  I heard Grandma tell her before she
left that she wasn't to give me any shortcake because it was too
rich for little boys' stomachs.  But maybe Mary Joe will cut some
for you if I promise I won't eat any.  Let us hope for the best."
<P>
"Yes, let us," agreed Anne, whom this cheerful philosophy suited
exactly, "and if Mary Joe proves hard-hearted and won't give me any
shortbread it doesn't matter in the least, so you are not to worry
over that."
<P>
"You're sure you won't mind if she doesn't?" said Paul anxiously.
<P>
"Perfectly sure, dear heart."
<P>
"Then I won't worry," said Paul, with a long breath of relief,
"especially as I really think Mary Joe will listen to reason. 
She's not a naturally unreasonable person, but she has learned
by experience that it doesn't do to disobey Grandma's orders.
Grandma is an excellent woman but people must do as she tells them.
She was very much pleased with me this morning because I managed at
last to eat all my plateful of porridge.  It was a great effort but
I succeeded.  Grandma says she thinks she'll make a man of me yet. 
But, teacher, I want to ask you a very important question.
You will answer it truthfully, won't you?"
<P>
"I'll try," promised Anne.
<P>
"Do you think I'm wrong in my upper story?" asked Paul, as if his
very existence depended on her reply.
<P>
"Goodness, no, Paul," exclaimed Anne in amazement.  "Certainly
you're not.  What put such an idea into your head?"
<P>
"Mary Joe. . .but she didn't know I heard her.  Mrs. Peter Sloane's
hired girl, Veronica, came to see Mary Joe last evening and I heard
them talking in the kitchen as I was going through the hall.
I heard Mary Joe say, `Dat Paul, he is de queeres' leetle boy.
He talks dat queer.  I tink dere's someting wrong in his upper story.'
I couldn't sleep last night for ever so long, thinking of it, and
wondering if Mary Joe was right.  I couldn't bear to ask Grandma
about it somehow, but I made up my mind I'd ask you.  I'm so glad
you think I'm all right in my upper story."
<P>
"Of course you are.  Mary Joe is a silly, ignorant girl, and you
are never to worry about anything she says," said Anne indignantly,
secretly resolving to give Mrs. Irving a discreet hint as to the
advisability of restraining Mary Joe's tongue.
<P>
"Well, that's a weight off my mind," said Paul.  "I'm perfectly
happy now, teacher, thanks to you.  It wouldn't be nice to
have something wrong in your upper story, would it, teacher?
I suppose the reason Mary Joe imagines I have is because I tell
her what I think about things sometimes."
<P>
"It is a rather dangerous practice," admitted Anne, out of the
depths of her own experience.
<P>
"Well, by and by I'll tell you the thoughts I told Mary Joe and you
can see for yourself if there's anything queer in them," said Paul,
"but I'll wait till it begins to get dark.  That is the time I ache
to tell people things, and when nobody else is handy I just HAVE to
tell Mary Joe.  But after this I won't, if it makes her imagine I'm
wrong in my upper story.  I'll just ache and bear it."
<P>
"And if the ache gets too bad you can come up to Green Gables and
tell me your thoughts," suggested Anne, with all the gravity that
endeared her to children, who so dearly love to be taken seriously.
<P>
"Yes, I will.  But I hope Davy won't be there when I go because he
makes faces at me.  I don't mind VERY much because he is such a
little boy and I am quite a big one, but still it is not pleasant
to have faces made at you.  And Davy makes such terrible ones. 
Sometimes I am frightened he will never get his face straightened
out again.  He makes them at me in church when I ought to be thinking
of sacred things.  Dora likes me though, and I like her, but not so
well as I did before she told Minnie May Barry that she meant to
marry me when I grew up.  I may marry somebody when I grow up but
I'm far too young to be thinking of it yet, don't you think, teacher?"
<P>
"Rather young," agreed teacher.
<P>
"Speaking of marrying, reminds me of another thing that has been
troubling me of late," continued Paul.  "Mrs. Lynde was down here
one day last week having tea with Grandma, and Grandma made me show
her my little mother's picture. . .the one father sent me for my
birthday present.  I didn't exactly want to show it to Mrs. Lynde. 
Mrs. Lynde is a good, kind woman, but she isn't the sort of person
you want to show your mother's picture to.  YOU know, teacher.
But of course I obeyed Grandma.  Mrs. Lynde said she was very
pretty ut kind of actressy looking, and must have been an awful lot
younger than father.  Then she said, `Some of these days your pa
will be marrying again likely.  How will you like to have a new ma,
Master Paul? ' Well, the idea almost took my breath away, teacher,
but I wasn't going to let Mrs. Lynde see THAT.  I just looked her
straight in the face. . .like this. . .and I said, `Mrs. Lynde,
father made a pretty good job of picking out my first mother and I
could trust him to pick out just as good a one the second time.'
And I CAN trust him, teacher.  But still, I hope, if he ever does
give me a new mother, he'll ask my opinion about her before it's
too late.  There's Mary Joe coming to call us to tea.  I'll go and
consult with her about the shortbread."
<P>
As a result of the "consultation," Mary Joe cut the shortbread and
added a dish of preserves to the bill of fare.  Anne poured the tea
and she and Paul had a very merry meal in the dim old sitting room
whose windows were open to the gulf breezes, and they talked so much
"nonsense" that Mary Joe was quite scandalized and told Veronica
the next evening that "de school mees" was as queer as Paul.
After tea Paul took Anne up to his room to show her his
mother's picture, which had been the mysterious birthday present
kept by Mrs. Irving in the bookcase.  Paul's little low-ceilinged
room was a soft whirl of ruddy light from the sun that was setting
over the sea and swinging shadows from the fir trees that grew
close to the square, deep-set window.  From out this soft glow
and glamor shone a sweet, girlish face, with tender mother eyes,
that was hanging on the wall at the foot of the bed.
<P>
"That's my little mother," said Paul with loving pride.  "I got
Grandma to hang it there where I'd see it as soon as I opened my
eyes in the morning.  I never mind not having the light when I go
to bed now, because it just seems as if my little mother was right
here with me.  Father knew just what I would like for a birthday
present, although he never asked me.  Isn't it wonderful how much
fathers DO know?"
<P>
"Your mother was very lovely, Paul, and you look a little like her.
But her eyes and hair are darker than yours."
<P>
"My eyes are the same color as father's," said Paul, flying
about the room to heap all available cushions on the window seat,
"but father's hair is gray.  He has lots of it, but it is gray.
You see, father is nearly fifty.  That's ripe old age, isn't it?
But it's only OUTSIDE he's old.  INSIDE he's just as young as anybody. 
Now, teacher, please sit here; and I'll sit at your feet.  May I lay
my head against your knee?  That's the way my little mother and I
used to sit.  Oh, this is real splendid, I think."
<P>
"Now, I want to hear those thoughts which Mary Joe pronounces so queer,"
said Anne, patting the mop of curls at her side.  Paul never needed any
coaxing to tell his thoughts. . .at least, to congenial souls.
<P>
"I thought them out in the fir grove one night," he said dreamily. 
"Of course I didn't BELIEVE them but I THOUGHT them.  YOU know,
teacher.  And then I wanted to tell them to somebody and there was
nobody but Mary Joe.  Mary Joe was in the pantry setting bread and
I sat down on the bench beside her and I said, `Mary Joe, do you
know what I think?  I think the evening star is a lighthouse on the
land where the fairies dwell.'  And Mary Joe said, `Well, yous are
de queer one.  Dare ain't no such ting as fairies.'  I was very much
provoked.  Of course, I knew there are no fairies; but that needn't
prevent my thinking there is.  You know, teacher.  But I tried
again quite patiently.  I said, `Well then, Mary Joe, do you know
what I think?  I think an angel walks over the world after the sun
sets. . .a great, tall, white angel, with silvery folded wings. . .
and sings the flowers and birds to sleep.  Children can hear him
if they know how to listen.'  Then Mary Joe held up her hands
all over flour and said, `Well, yous are de queer leetle boy.
Yous make me feel scare.'  And she really did looked scared.
I went out then and whispered the rest of my thoughts to the garden.
There was a little birch tree in the garden and it died.  Grandma says
the salt spray killed it; but I think the dryad belonging to it was
a foolish dryad who wandered away to see the world and got lost. 
And the little tree was so lonely it died of a broken heart."
<P>
"And when the poor, foolish little dryad gets tired of the world
and comes back to her tree HER heart will break," said Anne.
<P>
"Yes; but if dryads are foolish they must take the consequences,
just as if they were real people," said Paul gravely.  "Do you know
what I think about the new moon, teacher?  I think it is a little
golden boat full of dreams."
<P>
"And when it tips on a cloud some of them spill out and fall into
your sleep."
<P>
"Exactly, teacher.  Oh, you DO know.  And I think the violets are
little snips of the sky that fell down when the angels cut out
holes for the stars to shine through.  And the buttercups are made
out of old sunshine; and I think the sweet peas will be butterflies
when they go to heaven.  Now, teacher, do you see anything so very
queer about those thoughts?"
<P>
"No, laddie dear, they are not queer at all; they are strange and
beautiful thoughts for a little boy to think, and so people who
couldn't think anything of the sort themselves, if they tried for a
hundred years, think them queer.  But keep on thinking them, Paul
. . .some day you are going to be a poet, I believe."
<P>
When Anne reached home she found a very different type of boyhood
waiting to be put to bed.  Davy was sulky; and when Anne had
undressed him he bounced into bed and buried his face in the pillow.
<P>
"Davy, you have forgotten to say your prayers," said Anne rebukingly.
<P>
"No, I didn't forget," said Davy defiantly, "but I ain't going to
say my prayers any more.  I'm going to give up trying to be good,
'cause no matter how good I am you'd like Paul Irving better.
So I might as well be bad and have the fun of it."
<P>
"I don't like Paul Irving BETTER," said Anne seriously.  "I like
you just as well, only in a different way."
<P>
"But I want you to like me the same way," pouted Davy.
<P>
"You can't like different people the same way.  You don't like Dora
and me the same way, do you?"
<P>
Davy sat up and reflected.
<P>
"No. . .o. . .o," he admitted at last, "I like Dora because she's
my sister but I like you because you're YOU."
<P>
"And I like Paul because he is Paul and Davy because he is Davy,"
said Anne gaily.
<P>
"Well, I kind of wish I'd said my prayers then," said Davy, convinced
by this logic.  "But it's too much bother getting out now to say them.
I'll say them twice over in the morning, Anne.  Won't that do as well?"
<P>
No, Anne was positive it would not do as well.  So Davy scrambled
out and knelt down at her knee.  When he had finished his devotions
he leaned back on his little, bare, brown heels and looked up at her.
<P>
"Anne, I'm gooder than I used to be."
<P>
"Yes, indeed you are, Davy," said Anne, who never hesitated to give
credit where credit was due.
<P>
"I KNOW I'm gooder," said Davy confidently, "and I'll tell you how
I know it.  Today Marilla give me two pieces of bread and jam, one
for me and one for Dora.  One was a good deal bigger than the other
and Marilla didn't say which was mine.  But I give the biggest
piece to Dora.  That was good of me, wasn't it?"
<P>
"Very good, and very manly, Davy."
<P>
"Of course," admitted Davy, "Dora wasn't very hungry and she only et
half her slice and then she give the rest to me.  But I didn't know
she was going to do that when I give it to her, so I WAS good, Anne."
<P>
In the twilight Anne sauntered down to the Dryad's Bubble and saw
Gilbert Blythe coming down through the dusky Haunted Wood.  She had
a sudden realization that Gilbert was a schoolboy no longer.  And
how manly he looked -- the tall, frank-faced fellow, with the
clear, straightforward eyes and the broad shoulders.  Anne thought
Gilbert was a very handsome lad, even though he didn't look at all
like her ideal man.  She and Diana had long ago decided what kind
of a man they admired and their tastes seemed exactly similar.  He
must be very tall and distinguished looking, with melancholy,
inscrutable eyes, and a melting, sympathetic voice.  There was
nothing either melancholy or inscrutable in Gilbert's physiognomy,
but of course that didn't matter in friendship!
<P>
Gilbert stretched himself out on the ferns beside the Bubble and
looked approvingly at Anne.  If Gilbert had been asked to describe
his ideal woman the description would have answered point for point
to Anne, even to those seven tiny freckles whose obnoxious presence
still continued to vex her soul.  Gilbert was as yet little more
than a boy; but a boy has his dreams as have others, and in
Gilbert's future there was always a girl with big, limpid gray
eyes, and a face as fine and delicate as a flower.  He had made up
his mind, also, that his future must be worthy of its goddess. 
Even in quiet Avonlea there were temptations to be met and faced. 
White Sands youth were a rather "fast" set, and Gilbert was popular
wherever he went.  But he meant to keep himself worthy of Anne's
friendship and perhaps some distant day her love; and he watched
over word and thought and deed as jealously as if her clear eyes
were to pass in judgment on it.  She held over him the unconscious
influence that every girl, whose ideals are high and pure, wields
over her friends; an influence which would endure as long as she
was faithful to those ideals and which she would as certainly lose
if she were ever false to them.  In Gilbert's eyes Anne's greatest
charm was the fact that she never stooped to the petty practices of
so many of the Avonlea girls -- the small jealousies, the little
deceits and rivalries, the palpable bids for favor.  Anne held
herself apart from all this, not consciously or of design, but
simply because anything of the sort was utterly foreign to her
transparent, impulsive nature, crystal clear in its motives and
aspirations.
<P>
But Gilbert did not attempt to put his thoughts into words, for he
had already too good reason to know that Anne would mercilessly and
frostily nip all attempts at sentiment in the bud -- or laugh at him,
which was ten times worse.
<P>
"You look like a real dryad under that birch tree," he said teasingly.
<P>
"I love birch trees," said Anne, laying her cheek against the creamy
satin of the slim bole, with one of the pretty, caressing gestures
that came so natural to her.
<P>
"Then you'll be glad to hear that Mr. Major Spencer has decided
to set out a row of white birches all along the road front of
his farm, by way of encouraging the A.V.I.S.," said Gilbert.
"He was talking to me about it today.  Major Spencer is the most
progressive and public-spirited man in Avonlea.  And Mr. William
Bell is going to set out a spruce hedge along his road front and up
his lane.  Our Society is getting on splendidly, Anne.  It is past
the experimental stage and is an accepted fact.  The older folks
are beginning to take an interest in it and the White Sands people
are talking of starting one too.  Even Elisha Wright has come
around since that day the Americans from the hotel had the picnic
at the shore.  They praised our roadsides so highly and said they
were so much prettier than in any other part of the Island.  And
when, in due time, the other farmers follow Mr. Spencer's good
example and plant ornamental trees and hedges along their road
fronts Avonlea will be the prettiest settlement in the province."
<P>
"The Aids are talking of taking up the graveyard," said Anne, "and I
hope they will, because there will have to be a subscription for that,
and it would be no use for the Society to try it after the hall affair.
But the Aids would never have stirred in the matter if the Society
hadn't put it into their thoughts unofficially.  Those trees we
planted on the church grounds are flourishing, and the trustees
have promised me that they will fence in the school grounds next year.
If they do I'll have an arbor day and every scholar shall plant a tree;
and we'll have a garden in the corner by the road."
<P>
"We've succeeded in almost all our plans so far, except in getting the old
Boulter house removed," said Gilbert, "and I've given THAT up in despair.
Levi won't have it taken down just to vex us.  There's a contrary streak
in all the Boulters and it's strongly developed in him."
<P>
"Julia Bell wants to send another committee to him, but I think the
better way will just be to leave him severely alone," said Anne sagely.
<P>
"And trust to Providence, as Mrs. Lynde says," smiled Gilbert. 
"Certainly, no more committees.  They only aggravate him. 
Julia Bell thinks you can do anything, if you only have a committee
to attempt it.  Next spring, Anne, we must start an agitation for
nice lawns and grounds.  We'll sow good seed betimes this winter.
I've a treatise here on lawns and lawnmaking and I'm going to prepare
a paper on the subject soon.  Well, I suppose our vacation is almost
over.  School opens Monday.  Has Ruby Gillis got the Carmody school?" 
<P>
"Yes; Priscilla wrote that she had taken her own home school, so
the Carmody trustees gave it to Ruby.  I'm sorry Priscilla is not
coming back, but since she can't I'm glad Ruby has got the school. 
She will be home for Saturdays and it will seem like old times,
to have her and Jane and Diana and myself all together again."
<P>
Marilla, just home from Mrs. Lynde's, was sitting on the back
porch step when Anne returned to the house.
<P>
"Rachel and I have decided to have our cruise to town tomorrow,"
she said.  "Mr. Lynde is feeling better this week and Rachel wants
to go before he has another sick spell."
<P>
"I intend to get up extra early tomorrow morning, for I've ever so
much to do," said Anne virtuously.  "For one thing, I'm going to
shift the feathers from my old bedtick to the new one.  I ought to
have done it long ago but I've just kept putting it off. . .
it's such a detestable task.  It's a very bad habit to put off
disagreeable things, and I never mean to again, or else I can't
comfortably tell my pupils not to do it.  That would be inconsistent.
Then I want to make a cake for Mr. Harrison and finish my paper
on gardens for the A.V.I.S., and write Stella, and wash and starch
my muslin dress, and make Dora's new apron."
<P>
"You won't get half done," said Marilla pessimistically.  "I never yet
planned to do a lot of things but something happened to prevent me."
