<p>Bibbs's room, that neat apartment for transients to which the
"lamidal"  George had shown him upon his return, still bore the
appearance of temporary quarters, possibly because Bibbs had no
clear conception of himself as a permanent incumbent. However,
he had set upon the mantelpiece the two photographs that he owned:
one, a "group" twenty years old&mdash;his father and mother, with Jim
and Roscoe as boys&mdash;and the other a "cabinet" of Edith at sixteen.
And upon a table were the books he had taken from his trunk: Sartor
Resartus, Virginibus Puerisque, Huckleberry Finn, and Afterwhiles.
There were some other books in the trunk&mdash;a large one, which remained
unremoved at the foot of the bed, adding to the general impression
of transiency. It contained nearly all the possessions as well
as the secret life of Bibbs Sheridan, and Bibbs sat beside it,
the day after his interview with his father, raking over a small
collection of manuscripts in the top tray. Some of these he glanced
through dubiously, finding little comfort in them; but one made
him smile. Then he shook his head ruefully indeed, and ruefully
began to read it. It was written on paper stamped "Hood Sanitarium,"
and bore the title, "Leisure."</p>

<p>  A man may keep a quiet heart at seventy miles an hour, but
not if   he is running the train.  Nor is the habit of contemplation
a useful   quality in the stoker of a foundry furnace; it will
not be found to   recommend him to the approbation of his superiors. 
For a profession   adapted solely to the pursuit of happiness
in thinking, I would   choose that of an invalid:  his money is
time and he may spend it on   Olympus.  It will not suffice to
be an amateur invalid.  To my way   of thinking, the perfect practitioner
must be to all outward   purposes already dead if he is to begin
the perfect enjoyment of   life.  His serenity must not be disturbed
by rumors of recovery; he   must lie serene in his long chair
in the sunshine.  The world must   be on the other side of the
wall, and the wall must be so thick and   so high that he cannot
hear the roaring of the furnace fires and the   screaming of the
whistles.  Peace&mdash;</p>

<p>Having read so far as the word "peace," Bibbs suffered an interruption
interesting as a coincidence of contrast. High voices sounded
in the hall just outside his door; and it became evident that
a woman's quarrel was in progress, the parties to it having begun
it in Edith's room, and continuing it vehemently as they came
out into the hall.</p>

<p>"Yes, you <em>BETTER </em>go home!" Bibbs heard his sister vociferating,
shrilly. "You better go home and keep your mind a little more
on your <em>HUSBAND</em>!"</p>

<p>"Edie, Edie!" he heard his mother remonstrating, as peacemaker.</p>

<p>"You see here!" This was Sibyl, and her voice was both acrid
and tremulous. "Don't you talk to me that way! I came here to
tell Mother Sheridan what I'd heard, and to let her tell Father
Sheridan if she thought she ought to, and I did it for your own
good."</p>

<p>"Yes, you did!" And Edith's gibing laughter tooted loudly. "Yes,
you did! <em>YOU </em>didn't have any other reason! OH no! <em>YOU
</em>don't want to break it up between Bobby Lamhorn and me because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Edie, Edie! Now, now!"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up, mamma! I'd like to know, then, if she says her
new friends tell her he's got such a reputation that he oughtn't
to come here, what about his not going to <em>HER </em>house.
How&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've explained that to Mother Sheridan." Sibyl's voice indicated
that she was descending the stairs. "Married people are not the
same. Some things that should be shielded from a young girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>This seemed to have no very soothing effect upon Edith. "'Shielded
from a young girl'!" she shrilled. "You seem pretty willing to
be the shield! You look out Roscoe doesn't notice what kind of
a shield you are!"</p>

<p>Sibyl's answer was inaudible, but Mrs. Sheridan's flurried attempts
at pacification were renewed. "Now, Edie, Edie, she means it for
your good, and you'd oughtn't to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hush up, mamma, and let me alone! If you dare tell papa&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now! I'm not going to tell him to-day, and maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got to promise <em>NEVER </em>to tell him!" the girl
cried, passionately.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see. You just come back in your own room, and we'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! I <em>WON'T '</em>talk it over'! Stop pulling me! Let me
<em>ALONE!" </em>And Edith, flinging herself violently upon Bibbs's
door, jerked it open, swung round it into the room, slammed the
door behind her, and threw herself, face down, upon the bed in
such a riot of emotion that she had no perception of Bibbs's presence
in the room. Gasping and sobbing in a passion of tears, she beat
the coverlet and pillows with her clenched fists. "Sneak!" she
babbled aloud. "Sneak! Snake-in-the-grass! Cat!"</p>

<p>Bibbs saw that she did not know he was there, and he went softly
toward the door, hoping to get away before she became aware of
him; but some sound of his movement reached her, and she sat up,
startled, facing him.</p>

<p>"Bibbs! I thought I saw you go out awhile ago."</p>

<p>"Yes. I came back, though. I'm sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Did you hear me quarreling with Sibyl?"</p>

<p>"Only what you said in the hall. You lie down again, Edith. I'm
going out."</p>

<p>"No; don't go." She applied a handkerchief to her eyes, emitted
a sob, and repeated her request. "Don't go. I don't mind you;
you're quiet, anyhow. Mamma's so fussy, and never gets anywhere.
I don't mind you at all, but I wish you'd sit down."</p>

<p>"All right." And he returned to his chair beside the trunk. "Go
ahead and cry all you want, Edith," he said. "No harm in that!"</p>

<p>"Sibyl told mamma &mdash;OH!" she began, choking. "Mary Vertrees
had mamma and Sibyl and I to tea, one afternoon two weeks or so
ago, and she had some women there that Sibyl's been crazy to get
in with, and she just laid herself out to make a hit with 'em,
and she's been running after 'em ever since, and now she comes
over here and says <em>THEY </em>say Bobby Lamhorn is so bad that,
even though they like his family, none of the nice people in town
would let him in their houses. In the first place, it's a falsehood,
and I don't believe a word of it; and in the second place I know
the reason she did it, and, what's more, she <em>KNOWS I </em>know
it! I won't <em>SAY </em>what it is&mdash;not yet&mdash;because papa and
all of you would think I'm as crazy as she is snaky; and Roscoe's
such a fool he'd probably quit speaking to me. But it's true!
Just you watch her; that's all I ask. Just you watch that woman.
You'll see!"</p>

<p>As it happened, Bibbs was literally watching "that woman." Glancing
from the window, he saw Sibyl pause upon the pavement in front
of the old house next door. She stood a moment, in deep thought,
then walked quickly up the path to the door, undoubtedly with
the intention of calling. But he did not mention this to his sister,
who, after delivering herself of a rather vague jeremiad upon
the subject of her sister-in-law's treacheries, departed to her
own chamber, leaving him to his speculations. The chief of these
concerned the social elasticities of women. Sibyl had just been
a participant in a violent scene; she had suffered hot insult
of a kind that could not fail to set her quivering with resentment;
and yet she elected to betake herself to the presence of people
whom she knew no more than "formally." Bibbs marveled. Surely,
he reflected, some traces of emotion must linger upon Sibyl's
face or in her manner; she could not have ironed it all quite
out in the three or four minutes it took her to reach the Vertreeses'
door.</p>

<p>And in this he was not mistaken, for Mary Vertrees was at that
moment wondering what internal excitement Mrs. Roscoe Sheridan
was striving to master. But Sibyl had no idea that she was allowing
herself to exhibit anything except the gaiety which she conceived
proper to the manner of a casual caller. She was wholly intent
upon fulfilling the sudden purpose that brought her, and she was
no more self-conscious than she was finely intelligent. For Sibyl
Sheridan belonged to a type Scriptural in its antiquity. She was
merely the idle and half-educated intriguer who may and does delude
men, of course, and the best and dullest of her own sex as well,
finding invariably strong supporters among these latter. It is
a type that has wrought some damage in the world and would have
wrought greater, save for the check put upon its power by intelligent
women and by its own "lack of perspective," for it is a type that
never sees itself. Sibyl followed her impulses with no reflection
or question&mdash;it was like a hound on the gallop after a master
on horseback. She had not even the instinct to stop and consider
her effect. If she wished to make a certain impression she believed
that she made it. She believed that she was believed.</p>

<p>"My mother asked me to say that she was sorry she couldn't come
down,"  Mary said, when they were seated.</p>

<p>Sibyl ran the scale of a cooing simulance of laughter, which
she had been brought up to consider the polite thing to do after
a remark addressed to her by any person with whom she was not
on familiar terms. It was intended partly as a courtesy and partly
as the foundation for an impression of sweetness.</p>

<p>"Just thought I'd fly in a minute," she said, continuing the
cooing to relieve the last doubt of her gentiality. "I thought
I'd just behave like <em>REAL </em>country neighbors. We are almost
out in the country, so far from down-town, aren't we? And it seemed
such a <em>LOVELY </em>day! I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed
meeting those nice people at tea that afternoon. You see, coming
here a bride and never having lived here before, I've had to depend
on my husband's friends almost entirely, and I really've known
scarcely anybody. Mr. Sheridan has been so engrossed in business
ever since he was a mere boy, why, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused, with the air of having completed an explanation.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Mary, sympathetically accepting it.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've been seeing quite a lot of the Kittersbys since that
afternoon," Sibyl went on. "They're really delightful people.
Indeed they are! Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped with unconscious abruptness, her mind plainly wandering
to another matter; and Mary perceived that she had come upon a
definite errand. Moreover, a tensing of Sibyl's eyelids, in that
moment of abstraction as she looked aside from her hostess, indicated
that the errand was a serious one for the caller and easily to
be connected with the slight but perceptible agitation underlying
her assumption of cheerful ease. There was a restlessness of breathing,
a restlessness of hands.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Kittersby and her daughter were chatting about some to
the people here in town the other day," said Sibyl, repeating
the cooing and protracting it. "They said something that took
ME by surprise! We were talking about our mutual friend, Mr. Robert
Lamhorn&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mary interrupted her promptly. "Do you mean 'mutual' to include
my mother and me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; the Kittersbys and you and all of us Sheridans, I
mean."</p>

<p>"No," said Mary. "We shouldn't consider Mr. Robert Lamhorn a
friend of ours."</p>

<p>To her surprise, Sibyl nodded eagerly, as if greatly pleased.
"That's just the way Mrs. Kittersby talked!" she cried, with a
vehemence that made Mary stare. "Yes, and I hear that's the way
<em>ALL </em>you old families here speak of him!"</p>

<p>Mary looked aside, but otherwise she was able to maintain her
composure. "I had the impression he was a friend of yours," she
said; adding, hastily, "and your husband's."</p>

<p>"Oh yes," said the caller, absently. "He is, certainly. A man's
reputation for a little gaiety oughtn't to make a great difference
to married people, of course. It's where young girls are in question.
<em>THEN </em>it may be very, very dangerous. There are a great
many things safe and proper for married people that might be awf'ly
imprudent for a young girl. Don't you agree, Miss Vertrees?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned the frank Mary. "Do you mean that you
intend to remain a friend of Mr. Lamhorn's, but disapprove of
Miss Sheridan's doing so?"</p>

<p>"That's it exactly!" was the naive and ardent response of Sibyl.
"What I feel about it is that a man with his reputation isn't
at all suitable for Edith, and the family ought to be made to
understand it. I tell you," she cried, with a sudden access of
vehemence, "her father ought to put his foot down!"</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed with a green spark; something seemed to leap
out and then retreat, but not before Mary had caught a glimpse
of it, as one might catch a glimpse of a thing darting forth and
then scuttling back into hiding under a bush.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Sibyl, much more composedly, "I hardly need
say that it's entirely on Edith's account that I'm worried about
this. I'm as fond of Edith as if she was really my sister, and
I can't help fretting about it. It would break my heart to have
Edith's life spoiled."</p>

<p>This tune was off the key, to Mary's ear. Sibyl tried to sing
with pathos, but she flatted.</p>

<p>And when a lady receives a call from another who suffers under
the stress of some feeling which she wishes to conceal, there
is not uncommonly developed a phenomenon of duality comparable
to the effect obtained by placing two mirrors opposite each other,
one clear and the other flawed. In this case, particularly, Sibyl
had an imperfect consciousness of Mary. The Mary Vertrees that
she saw was merely something to be cozened to her own frantic
purpose&mdash;a Mary Vertrees who was incapable of penetrating that
purpose. Sibyl sat there believing that she was projecting the
image of herself that she desired to project, never dreaming that
with every word, every look, and every gesture she was more and
more fully disclosing the pitiable truth to the clear eyes of
Mary. And the Sibyl that Mary saw was an overdressed woman, in
manner half rustic, and in mind as shallow as a pan, but possessed
by emotions that appeared to be strong&mdash;perhaps even violent.
What those emotions were Mary had not guessed, but she began to
suspect.</p>

<p>"And Edith's life <em>WOULD </em>be spoiled," Sibyl continued.
"It would be a dreadful thing for the whole family. She's the
very apple of Father Sheridan's eye, and he's as proud of her
as he is of Jim and Roscoe. It would be a horrible thing for him
to have her marry a man like Robert Lamhorn; but he doesn't <em>KNOW
</em>anything about him, and if somebody doesn't tell him, what
I'm most afraid of is that Edith might get his consent and hurry
on the wedding before he finds out, and then it would be too late.
You see, Miss Vertrees, it's very difficult for me to decide just
what it's my duty to do."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mary, looking at her thoughtfully, "Does Miss Sheridan
seem to&mdash;to care very much about him?"</p>

<p>"He's deliberately fascinated her," returned the visitor, beginning
to breathe quickly and heavily. "Oh, she wasn't difficult! She
knew she wasn't in right in this town, and she was crazy to meet
the people that were, and she thought he was one of 'em. But that
was only the start that made it easy for him&mdash;and he didn't need
it. He could have done it, anyway!" Sibyl was launched now; her
eyes were furious and her voice shook. "He went after her deliberately,
the way he does everything; he's as cold-blooded as a fish. All
he cares about is his own pleasure, and lately he's decided it
would be pleasant to get hold of a piece of real money&mdash;and there
was Edith! And he'll marry her! Nothing on earth can stop him
unless he finds out she won't <em>HAVE </em>any money if she marries
him, and the only person that could make him understand that is
Father Sheridan. Somehow, that's got to be managed, because Lamhorn
is going to hurry it on as fast as he can. He told me so last
night. He said he was going to marry her the first minute he could
persuade her to it&mdash;and little Edith's all ready to be persuaded!"
Sibyl's eyes flashed green again. "And he swore he'd do it," she
panted. "He swore he'd marry Edith Sheridan, and nothing on earth
could stop him!"</p>

<p>And then Mary understood. Her lips parted and she stared at the
babbling creature incredulously, a sudden vivid picture in her
mind, a canvas of unconscious Sibyl's painting. Mary beheld it
with pity and horror: she saw Sibyl clinging to Robert Lamhorn,
raging, in a whisper, perhaps&mdash;for Roscoe might have been in the
house, or servants might have heard. She saw Sibyl entreating,
beseeching, threatening despairingly, and Lamhorn&mdash;tired of her&mdash;first
evasive, then brutally letting her have the truth; and at last,
infuriated, "swearing" to marry her rival. If Sibyl had not babbled
out the word "swore" it might have been less plain.</p>

<p>The poor woman blundered on, wholly unaware of what she had confessed.
"You see," she said, more quietly, "whatever's going to be done
ought to be done right away. I went over and told Mother Sheridan
what I'd heard about Lamhorn&mdash;oh, I was open and aboveboard! I
told her right before Edith. I think it ought all to be done with
perfect frankness, because nobody can say it isn't for the girl's
own good and what her best friend would do. But Mother Sheridan's
under Edith's thumb, and she's afraid to ever come right out with
anything. Father Sheridan's different. Edith can get anything
she wants out of him in the way of money or ordinary indulgence,
but when it comes to a matter like this he'd be a steel rock.
If it's a question of his will against anybody else's he'd make
his will rule if it killed 'em both! Now, he'd never in the world
let Lamhorn come near the house again if he knew his reputation.
So, you see, somebody's got to tell him. It isn't a very easy
position for me, is it, Miss Vertrees?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mary, gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, to be frank," said Sibyl, smiling, "that's why I've come
to you."</p>

<p>"To ME!" Mary frowned.</p>

<p>Sibyl rippled and cooed again. "There isn't <em>ANYBODY </em>ever
made such a hit with Father Sheridan in his life as you have.
And of course we <em>ALL </em>hope you're not going to be exactly
an outsider in the affairs of the family!" (This sally with another
and louder effect of laughter). "And if it's MY duty, why, in
a way, I think it might be thought yours, too."</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Mary, sharply.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Sibyl. "Now suppose I go to Father Sheridan with
this story, and Edith says it's not true; suppose she says Lamhorn
has a good reputation and that I'm repeating irresponsible gossip,
or suppose (what's most likely) she loses her temper and says
I invented it, then what am I going to do? Father Sheridan doesn't
know Mrs. Kittersby and her daughter, and they're out of the question,
anyway. But suppose I could say: 'All right, if you want proof,
ask Miss Vertrees. She came with me, and she's waiting in the
next room right now, to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no," said Mary, quickly. "You mustn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen just a minute more," Sibyl urged, confidingly. She was
on easy ground now, to her own mind, and had no doubt of her success.
"You naturally don't want to begin by taking part in a family
quarrel, but if <em>YOU </em>take part in it, it won't be one.
You don't know yourself what weight you carry over there, and
no one would have the right to say you did it except out of the
purest kindness. Don't you see that Jim and his father would admire
you all the more for it? Miss Vertrees, listen! Don't you see
we <em>OUGHT </em>to do it, you and I? Do you suppose Robert Lamhorn
cares a snap of his finger for her? Do you suppose a man like
him would <em>LOOK </em>at Edith Sheridan if it wasn't for the
money?" And again Sibyl's emotion rose to the surface. "I tell
you he's after nothing on earth but to get his finger in that
old man's money-pile, over there, next door! He'd marry <em>ANYBODY
</em>to do it. Marry Edith?" she cried. "I tell you he'd marry
their nigger cook for <em>THAT</em>!"</p>

<p>She stopped, afraid&mdash;at the wrong time&mdash;that she had been too
vehement, but a glance at Mary reassured her, and Sibyl decided
that she had produced the effect she wished. Mary was not looking
at her; she was staring straight before her at the wall, her eyes
wide and shining. She became visibly a little paler as Sibyl looked
at her.</p>

<p>"After nothing on earth but to get his finger in that old man's
money-pile, over there, next door!" The voice was vulgar, the
words were vulgar&mdash;and the plain truth was vulgar! How it rang
in Mary Vertrees's ears! The clear mirror had caught its own image
clearly in the flawed one at last.</p>

<p>Sibyl put forth her best bid to clench the matter. She offered
her bargain. "Now don't you worry," she said, sunnily, "about
this setting Edith against you. She'll get over it after a while,
anyway, but if she tried to be spiteful and make it uncomfortable
for you when you drop in over there, or managed so as to sort
of leave you out, why, I've got a house, and Jim likes to come
there. I don't <em>THINK </em>Edith <em>WOULD </em>be that way;
she's too crazy to have you take her around with the smart crowd,
but if she <em>DID, </em>you needn't worry. And another thing
&mdash;I guess you won't mind Jim's own sister-in-law speaking
of it. Of course, I don't know just how matters stand between
you and Jim, but Jim and Roscoe are about as much alike as two
brothers can be, and Roscoe was very slow making up his mind;
sometimes I used to think he actually never <em>WOULD. </em>Now,
what I mean is, sisters-in-law can do lots of things to help matters
on like that. There's lots of little things can be said, and lots&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped, puzzled. Mary Vertrees had gone from pale to scarlet,
and now, still scarlet indeed, she rose, without a word of explanation,
or any other kind of word, and walked slowly to the open door
and out of the room.</p>

<p>Sibyl was a little taken aback. She supposed Mary had remembered
something neglected and necessary for the instruction of a servant,
and that she would return in a moment; but it was rather a rude
excess of absent-mindedness not to have excused herself, especially
as her guest was talking. And, Mary's return being delayed, Sibyl
found time to think this unprefaced exit odder and ruder than
she had first considered it. There might have been more excuse
for it, she thought, had she been speaking of matters less important&mdash;offering
to do the girl all the kindness in her power, too!</p>

<p>Sibyl yawned and swung her muff impatiently; she examined the
sole of her shoe; she decided on a new shape of heel; she made
an inventory of the furniture of the room, of the rugs, of the
wall-paper and engravings. Then she looked at her watch and frowned;
went to a window and stood looking out upon the brown lawn, then
came back to the chair she had abandoned, and sat again. There
was no sound in the house.</p>

<p>A strange expression began imperceptibly to alter the planes
of her face, and slowly she grew as scarlet as Mary&mdash;scarlet to
the ears. She looked at her watch again&mdash;and twenty-five minutes
had elapsed since she had looked at it before.</p>

<p>She went into the hall, glanced over her shoulder oddly; then
she let herself softly out of the front door, and went across
the street to her own house.</p>

<p>Roscoe met her upon the threshold, gloomily. "Saw you from the
window,"  he explained. "You must find a lot to say to that old
lady."</p>

<p>"What old lady?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vertrees. I been waiting for you a long time, and I saw
the daughter come out, fifteen minutes ago, and post a letter,
and then walk on up the street. Don't stand out on the porch,"
he said, crossly. "Come in here. There's something it's come time
I'll have to talk to you about. Come in!"</p>

<p>But as she was moving to obey he glanced across at his father's
house and started. He lifted his hand to shield his eyes from
the setting sun, staring fixedly. "Something's the matter over
there," he muttered, and then, more loudly, as alarm came into
his voice, he said, "What's the matter over there?"</p>

<p>Bibbs dashed out of the gate in an automobile set at its highest
speed, and as he saw Roscoe he made a gesture singularly eloquent
of calamity, and was lost at once in a cloud of dust down the
street. Edith had followed part of the way down the drive, and
it could be seen that she was crying bitterly. She lifted both
arms to Roscoe, summoning him.</p>

<p>"By George!" gasped Roscoe. "I believe somebody's dead!"</p>

<p>And he started for the New House at a run.</p>
