<p>The next morning was a perfect day for the young hunters.  The
sun shone brightly from the unclouded sky, and the air was crisp
and keen with the breath of autumn.  The experienced eye of the
father told him that there was not likely to be any change very
soon, and in his mild way he congratulated his son on the prospect
of the pleasant hunt that was before him and his young friends.</p>

<p>The agreement with the latter was that they were to wait at their
home for Jack, when the three would start into the interior on
a hunt that was likely to last two, if not more, days.  Mr. Gedney
was not one of those who thought his boy was too young to work.
There were always a number of small jobs known in the West as
"chores," which it was the duty of Jack to attend to, and which
he dared not slight.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that, although the boy rose at an unusually
early hour, and his mother hurried his morning meal for him, yet
when he started eastward along the path leading to his friends,
the sun was creeping above the horizon.</p>

<p>The preparations for the journey were few.  All the bullets that
were likely to be needed had been made by Mr. Gedney himself several
days before; the powder-horn was filled, and nothing was lacking
in that line.  Then Jack, like his father, always carried a flint
and steel with him, so as to be able to start a fire when he wanted
it.  (The lucifer match was not invented until a good many years
after.)  Then he had a pinch of mixed pepper and salt, wrapped
in a piece of paper, and meant to be used in seasoning the game
which they ate.  A few other knick-knacks were stowed away in
his inner pocket, and, kissing his parents "good-bye," he entered
the path at the other end of the clearing, and walked briskly
towards the home of his young friends.</p>

<p>When he reached the crossing where he shot the panthers the night
before, he naturally looked for the carcases of the animals. 
They were not in sight, having been carried away by the current.</p>

<p>"They’ve got mighty sharp claws," Jack said to himself, as he
looked down at the scratches in the wood made by the beast before
it dropped into the water.  "It was well for me that I was able
to shoot that other fellow before he could pounce upon me."</p>

<p>On the other side of the stream was a small area in the path,
where the ground was so spongy that it showed any light imprint
upon it.  Jack looked at the impression left by his own heavy
shoe, and then uttered an expression of astonishment.</p>

<p>And well he might do so, for there, beside the imprint of his
shoe, was that of an Indian moccasin (or foot covering), made,
too, since Jack had passed that way the evening before.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha," he muttered, looking keenly about him, "there are Indians
not far off; I wonder whether they are Shawnees, Hurons, Wyandots,
Pottawatomies, or what?  Are they hunting for scalps or wild game?"</p>

<p>It would seem that the most natural thing for the boy to do under
such circumstances was to turn back home and tell his father about
the discovery he had made; but Jack had no thought of that; he
had started out for a hunt, and he was not going to let such a
trifle as a few prowling Indians turn him back. The young hunter
noticed that the toe of the moccasin pointed eastward&mdash;that is,
in the direction he himself was travelling.</p>

<p>"Maybe the boys have seen something of him," was his thought,
as he pushed along the path; "he may be some friendly warrior
who has stopped to ask for something to eat."</p>

<p>Jack Gedney had not walked twenty steps beyond the bridge when
he heard a fierce threshing among the trees and undergrowth, which
he knew was made by an animal in its frenzied flight.  The next
moment a noble-looking buck broke cover on his right, less than
a hundred feet away, and bounded straight across the path in front
of the boy, whose trusty rifle was at his shoulder on the instant.</p>

<p>As the animal turned his broad side towards Jack the latter sent
a bullet behind the fore-leg, at the point where it was sure to
tear its way clean through the heart, and shatter bone and muscle
as it skimmed into the woods beyond.</p>

<p>The buck took two more of his tremendous bounds, as if he were
unhurt, and he might have gone still farther had he not crashed
straight against the trunk of a tree, from which he recoiled,
and sank to the ground limp and lifeless.</p>

<p>Jack started to run towards his prize, but recalling the warning
of his father, checked himself, and re-loaded his gun before leaving
the path. This was soon done, and then he broke into a trot which
quickly took him to the side of the prize.</p>

<p>The young hunter’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"He’s one of the finest animals I ever saw. Hallo!&#11834;"</p>

<p>He was looking at the tiny red orifice where his bullet had entered,
and from which the life current was flowing, when he saw the feathered
tip of an Indian arrow just under the fore part of the buck. 
Seizing the front legs, he rolled the animal over on the other
side.</p>

<p>As he did so he saw that an arrow had been driven into the side
of the deer, close to where his bullet had come out.</p>

<p>The wound thus made must have been mortal, though, as you may
know, it is almost impossible to fire a shot that will instantly
bring down one of these animals.</p>

<p>There could be but one meaning to this&mdash;an Indian had shot the
buck before Jack fired at it.</p>

<p>"Of course he will claim it," thought the young hunter; "but
I am not sure that it belongs to him, for from the way the deer
was running it looked as if he was not going to give up for a
long time, if indeed he would have fallen at all.  But we shall
soon know."</p>

<p>The cause of the last remark was the sight of the Indian who
doubtless fired the arrow.  Jack, on looking at him, saw with
pleasure that he was not a full-grown warrior, but a boy who could
not have been much older than himself.</p>

<p>The young Indian wore the fringed hunting shirt, leggings, and
beaded moccasins of his people, had a row of beads around his
neck, a quiver of arrows over his left shoulder, and a long bow
in his left hand.  In the belt which clasped the waist of his
deer-skin hunting shirt were thrust a tomahawk and hunting knife,
so that he was as fully armed as most of his people.</p>

<p>The face was broad, with high cheek-bones, small twinkling bead-like
eyes, broad thick nose, and retreating chin, the whole daubed
with greasy yellow, red, and black paint, in the shape of circles,
dots, and all sorts of hideous devices for which room could be
found.</p>

<p>From a glance at the colours used in the dress of the Indian
and on his countenance, Jack formed the conclusion that he belonged
to the Wyandot tribe, many of whom he had met.</p>

<p>The young Indian must have believed he was a terrible-looking
fellow, and that no white lad dare dispute him, for he strode
along like one who knows he is master, and stopping a few steps
away, pointed down at the smitten buck.</p>

<p>"He mine," he muttered, in good English; "me shoot him."</p>

<p>"So I see," calmly remarked Jack.  "And I shot him too."</p>

<p>As he spoke he pointed to the place where the ball had left the
body, close to the entrance of the arrow. The Indian stooped down,
and with some dexterity pushed the latter through the body of
the deer, drawing it out on the other side.  The head of such
a missile, as you can well see, is so fashioned that it cannot
be drawn back after being driven into any body.</p>

<p>Rising to his feet, the young Wyandot restored the shaft to its
place in his quiver, and repeated his remark:</p>

<p>"He mine; me shoot him with arrow."</p>

<p>Now there was no cause for Jack Gedney having a dispute with
the Indian. The latter was welcome to the game, for Jack could
do nothing with it, unless to run back home and tell his father
to come and claim it.  It was within convenient reach, but rather
than give the time that this would take, the youth would have
preferred to lose several such deer.</p>

<p>He was anxious to join Will and George, who he knew were waiting
impatiently for him; but he felt very much as you would have felt
had you stood in his shoes.  He thought the Indian was trying
to bully him, and he was not willing to submit.  Had the Wyandot
asked him to let him have the game, he would have been glad to
do so; but when it was not clear which of the two was the rightful
claimant to the prize, the sturdy young hunter did not mean to
be dictated to by a young Indian whose face was painted like his.
Before yielding he would resist him. </p>
