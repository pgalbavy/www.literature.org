<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>By two of the afternoon we were running into the inlet of Rio
Medio. I had come on deck when Tomas Castro had started out of
his doze. I wanted to see. We went round violently as I emerged,
and, clinging to the side, I saw, in a whirl, tall, baked, brown
hills dropping sheer down to a strip of flat land and a belt of
dark-green scrub at the water's edge; little pink squares of house-walls
dropped here and there, mounting the hillside among palms, like
men standing in tall grass, running back, hiding in a steep valley;
silver-gray huts with ragged dun roofs, like dishevelled shocks
of hair; a great pink church-face, very tall and narrow, pyramidal
towards the top, and pierced for seven bells, but having only
three. It looked as if it had been hidden for centuries in the
folds of an ancient land, as it lay there asleep in the blighting
sunlight.</p>

<p>When we anchored, Tomas, beside me in saturnine silence, grunted
and spat into the water.</p>

<p>"Look here," I said. "What is the meaning of it all? What is
it? What is at the bottom?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders gloomily. "If your worship does not
know, who should?" he said. "It is not for me to say why people
should wish to come here."</p>

<p>"Then take me to Carlos," I said. "I must get this settled."</p>

<p>Castro looked at me suspiciously. "You will not excite him?"
he said. "I have known people die right out when they were like
that."</p>

<p>"Oh, I won't excite him," I said.</p>

<p>As we were rowed ashore, he began to point out the houses of
the notables. Rio Medio had been one of the principal ports of
the Antilles in the seventeenth century, but it had failed before
the rivalry of Havana because its harbour would not take the large
vessels of modern draft. Now it had no trade, no life, no anything
except a bishop and a great monastery, a few retired officials
from Havana. A large settlement of ragged thatched huts and clay
hovels lay to the west of the cathedral. The Casa Riego was an
enormous palace, with windows like loopholes, facing the shore.
Don Balthasar practically owned the whole town and all the surrounding
country, and, except for his age and feebleness, might have been
an absolute monarch.</p>

<p>He had lived in Havana with great splendour, but now, in his
failing years, had retired to his palace, from which he had since
only twice set foot. This had only been when official ceremonies
of extreme importance, such as the international execution of
pirates that I had witnessed, demanded the presence of someone
of his eminence and lustre. Otherwise he had lived shut up in
his palace. There was nowhere in Rio Medio for him to go to.</p>

<p>He was said to regard his intendente O'Brien as the apple of
his eye, and had used his influence to get him made one of the
judges of the Marine Court. The old Don himself probably knew
nothing about the pirates. The inlet had been used by buccaneers
ever since the days of Columbus; but they were below his serious
consideration, even if he had ever seen them, which Tomas Castro
doubted.</p>

<p>There was no doubting the sincerity of his tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, you thought <em>I</em> was a pirate!" he muttered. "For
a day&mdash;yes&mdash;to oblige a Riego, my friend&mdash;yes! Moreover, I hate
that familiar of the priests, that soft-spoken Juez, intendente,
intriguer&mdash;that O'Brien. A sufferer for the faith! <em>Que picardia!</em>
Have I, too, not suffered for the faith? I am the trusted humble
friend of the Riegos. But, perhaps, you think Don Balthasar is
himself a pirate! He who has in his veins the blood of the Cid
Campeador; whose ancestors have owned half this island since the
days of Christopher himself. . . ."</p>

<p>"Has he nothing whatever to do with it?" I asked. "After all,
it goes on in his own town."</p>

<p>"Oh, you English," he muttered; "you are all mad! Would one of
your great nobles be a pirate? Perhaps they would &mdash;God knows.
Alas, alas!" he suddenly broke off, "when I think that my Carlos
shall leave his bones in this ungodly place. . . ."</p>

<p>I gave up questioning Tomas Castro; he was too much for me.</p>

<p>We entered the grim palace by the shore through an imposing archway,
and mounted a broad staircase. In a lofty room, giving off the
upper gallery round the central court of the Casa Riego, Carlos
lay in a great bed. I stood before him, having pushed aside Tomas
Castro, who had been cautiously scratching the great brilliant
mahogany panels with a dirty finger-nail.</p>

<p>"Damnation, Carlos!" I said. "This is the third of your treacheries.
What do you want with me?"</p>

<p>You might well have imagined he was a descendant of the Cid Campeador,
only to look at him lying there without a quiver of a feature,
his face stainlessly white, a little bluish in extreme lack of
blood, with all the nobility of death upon it, like an alabaster
effigy of an old knight in a cathedral. On the red-velvet hangings
of the bed was an immense coat-of-arms, worked in silk and surrounded
by a collar, with the golden sheep hanging from the ring. The
shield was patched in with an immense number of quarterings&mdash;lions
rampant, leopards courant, fleurs de lis, castles, eagles, hands,
and arms. His eyes opened slowly, and his face assumed an easy,
languorous smile of immense pleasure.</p>

<p>"Ah, Juan," he said, "<em>se bienvenido</em>, be welcome, be
welcome."</p>

<p>Castro caught me roughly by the shoulder, and gazed at me with
blazing, yellow eyes.</p>

<p>"You should not speak roughly to him," he said. "English beast!
He is dying."</p>

<p>"No, I won't speak roughly to him," I answered. "I see."</p>

<p>I did see. At first I had been suspicious; it might have been
put on to mollify me. But one could not put on that blueness of
tinge, that extra&mdash;nearly final&mdash;touch of the chisel to the lines
round the nose, that air of restfulness that nothing any more
could very much disturb. There was no doubt that Carlos was dying.</p>

<p>"Treacheries&mdash;no. You had to come," he said suddenly. "I need
you. I am glad, dear Juan." He waved a thin long hand a little
towards mine. "You shall not long be angry. It had to be done&mdash;you
must forgive the means."</p>

<p>His air was so gay, so uncomplaining, that it was hard to believe
it came from him.</p>

<p>"You could not have acted worse if you had owed me a grudge,
Carlos," I said. "I want an explanation. But I don't want to kill
you. . . ."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, oh, no," he said; "in a minute I will tell."</p>

<p>He dropped a gold ball into a silver basin that was by the bedside,
and it sounded like a great bell. A nun in a sort of coif that
took the lines of a buffalo's horns glided to him with a gold
cup, from which he drank, raising himself a little. Then the religious
went out with Tomas Castro, who gave me a last ferocious glower
from his yellow eyes. Carlos smiled.</p>

<p>"They try to make my going easy," he said. "<em>Vamos!</em> The
pillow is smooth for him who is well loved." He shut his eyes.
Suddenly he said, "Why do you, alone, hate me, John Kemp? What
have I done?"</p>

<p>"God knows I don't hate you, Carlos," I answered.</p>

<p>"You have always mistrusted me," he said. "And yet I am, perhaps,
nearer to you than many of your countrymen, and I have always
wished you well, and you have always hated and mistrusted me.
From the very first you mistrusted me. Why?"</p>

<p>It was useless denying it; he had the extraordinary incredulity
of his kind. I remembered how I had idolized him as a boy at home.</p>

<p>"Your brother-in-law, my cousin Rooksby, was the very first to
believe that I was a pirate. I, a vulgar pirate! I, Carlos Riego!
Did he not believe it&mdash;and you?" He glanced a little ironically,
and lifted a thin white finger towards the great coat-of-arms.
"That sort of thing," he said, "<em>amigo mio</em>, does not allow
one to pick pockets." He suddenly turned a little to one side,
and fixed me with his clear eyes. "My friend," he said, "if I
told you that Rooksby and your greatest Kent earls carried smugglers'
tubs, you would say I was an ignorant fool. Yet they, too, are
magistrates. The only use I have ever made of these ruffians was
to-day, to bring you here. It was a necessity. That O'Brien had
gone on to take you when you arrived. You would never have come
alive out of Havana. I was saving your life. Once there, you could
never have escaped from that man."</p>

<p>I saw suddenly that this might be the truth. There had been something
friendly in Tomas Castro's desire not to compromise me before
the people on board the ship. Obviously he had been acting a part,
with a visible contempt for the pilfering that he could not prevent.
He <em>had</em> been sent merely to bring me to Rio Medio.</p>

<p>"I never disliked you," I protested. "I do not understand what
you mean. All I know is, that you have used me ill&mdash;outrageously
ill. You have saved my life now, you say. That may be true; but
why did you ever make me meet with that man O'Brien?"</p>

<p>"And even for that you should not hate me," he said, shaking
his head on the silk pillows. "I never wished you anything but
well, Juan, because you were honest and young, of noble blood,
good to look upon; you had done me and my friend good service,
to your own peril, when my own cousin had deserted me. And I loved
you for the sake of another. I loved your sister. We have a proverb:
'A man is always good to the eyes in which the sister hath found
favour.'"</p>

<p>I looked at him in amazement. "You loved Veronica!" I said. "But
Veronica is nothing at all. There was the Señorita."</p>

<p>He smiled wearily. "Ah, the Señorita; she is very well; a man
could love her, too. But we do not command love, my friend."</p>

<p>I interrupted him. "I want to know why you brought me here. Why
did you ask me to come here when we were on board the <em>Thames?</em>"</p>

<p>He answered sadly, "Ah, then! Because I loved your sister, and
you reminded me always of her. But that is all over now&mdash;done
with for good.... I have to address myself to dying as it becomes
one of my race to die." He smiled at me. "One must die in peace
to die like a Christian. Life has treated me rather scurvily,
only the gentleman must not repine like a poor man of low birth.
I would like to do a good turn to the friend who is the brother
of his sister, to the girl-cousin whom I do not love with love,
but whom I understand with affection&mdash;to the great inheritance
that is not for my wasted hands."</p>

<p>I looked out of the open door of the room. There was the absolutely
quiet inner court of the palace, a colonnade of tall square pillars,
in the centre the little thread of a fountain. Round the fountain
were tangled bushes of flowers&mdash;enormous geraniums, enormous hollyhocks,
a riot of orange marigolds.</p>

<p>"How like our flowers at home!" I said mechanically.</p>

<p>"I brought the seeds from there&mdash;from your sister's garden,"
he said.</p>

<p>I felt horribly hipped. "But all these things tell me nothing,"
I said, with an attempt towards briskness.</p>

<p>"I have to husband my voice." He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>There is no saying that I did not believe him; I did, every word.
I had simply been influenced by Rooks-by's suspicions. I had made
an ass of myself over that business on board the <em>Thames</em>.
The passage of Carles and his faithful Tomas had been arranged
for by some agent of O'Brien in London, who was in communication
with Ramon and Rio Medio. The same man had engaged Nichols, that
Nova Scotian mate, an unscrupulous sailor, for O'Brien's service.
He was to leave the ship in Kingston, and report himself to Ramon,
who furnished him with the means to go to Cuba. That man, seeing
me intimate with two persons going to Rio Medio, had got it into
his head that I was going there, too. And, very naturally, he
did not want an Englishman for a witness of his doings.</p>

<p>But Rooksby's behaviour, his veiled accusations, his innuendoes
against Carlos, had influenced me more than anything else. I remembered
a hundred little things now that I knew that Carlos loved Veronica.
I understood Rooksby's jealous impatience, Veronica's friendly
glances at Carlos, the fact that Rooksby had proposed to Veronica
on the very day that Carlos had come again into the neighbourhood
with the runners after him. I saw very well that there was no
more connection between the Casa Riego and the rascality of Rio
Medio than there was between Ralph himself and old drunken Rangsley
on Hythe beach. There was less, perhaps.</p>

<p>"Ah, you have had a sad life, my Carlos," I said, after a long
time.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes, and smiled his brave smile. "Ah, as to that,"
he said, "one kept on. One has to husband one's voice, though,
and not waste it over lamentations. I have to tell you&mdash;ah, yes...."
He paused and fixed his eyes upon me. "Figure to yourself that
this house, this town, an immense part of this island, much even
yet in Castile itself, much gold, many slaves, a great name&mdash;a
very great name&mdash;are what I shall leave behind me. Now think that
there is a very noble old man, one who has been very great in
the world, who shall die very soon; then all these things shall
go to a young girl. That old man is very old, is a little foolish
with age; that young girl knows very little of the world, and
is very passionate, very proud, very helpless.</p>

<p>"Add, now, to that a great menace&mdash;a very dangerous, crafty,
subtle personage, who has the ear of that old man; whose aim it
is to become the possessor of that young girl and of that vast
wealth. The old man is much subject to the other. Old men are
like that, especially the very great. They have many things to
think of; it is necessary that they rely on somebody. I am, in
fact, speaking of my uncle and the man called O'Brien. You have
seen him." Carlos spoke in a voice hardly above a whisper, but
he stuck to his task with indomitable courage. "If I die and leave
him here, he will have my uncle to himself. He is a terrible man.
Where would all that great fortune go? For the re-establishing
of the true faith in Ireland? <em>Quien sabe?</em> Into the hands
of O'Brien, at any rate. And the daughter, too&mdash;a young girl&mdash;she
would be in the hands of O'Brien, too. If I could expect to live,
it might be different. That is the greatest distress of all."
He swallowed painfully, and put his frail hand on to the white
ruffle at his neck. "I was in great trouble to find how to thwart
this O'Brien. My uncle went to Kingston because he was persuaded
it was his place to see that the execution of those unhappy men
was conducted with due humanity. O'Brien came with us as his secretary.
I was in the greatest horror of mind. I prayed for guidance. Then
my eyes fell upon you, who were pressed against our very carriage
wheels. It was like an answer to my prayers." Carlos suddenly
reached out and caught my hand.</p>

<p>I thought he was wandering, and I was immensely sorry for him.
He looked at me so wistfully with his immense eyes. He continued
to press my hand.</p>

<p>"But when I saw you," he went on, after a time, "it had come
into my head, 'That is the man who is sent in answer to my prayers.'
I knew it, I say. If you could have my cousin and my lands, I
thought, it would be like my having your sister&mdash;not quite, but
good enough for a man who is to die in a short while, and leave
no trace but a marble tomb. Ah, one desires very much to leave
a mark under God's blessed sun, and to be able to know a little
how things will go after one is dead.... I arranged the matter
very quickly in my mind. There was the difficulty of O'Brien.
If I had said, 'Here is the man who is to marry my cousin,' he
would have had you or me murdered; he would stop at nothing. So
I said to him very quietly, 'Look here, Señor Secretary, that
is the man you have need of to replace your Nichols&mdash;a devil to
fight; but I think he will not consent without a little persuasion.
Decoy him, then, to Ramon's, and do your persuading.' O'Brien
was very glad, because he thought that at last I was coming to
take an interest in his schemes, and because it was bringing humiliation
to an Englishman. And Sera-phina was glad, because I had often
spoken of you with enthusiasm, as very fearless and very honourable.
Then I made that man Ramon decoy you, thinking that the matter
would be left to me."</p>

<p>That was what Carlos had expected. But O'Brien, talking with
Ramon, had heard me described as an extreme Separationist so positively
that he had thought it safe to open himself fully. He must have
counted, also, on my youth, my stupidity, or my want of principle.
Finding out his mistake, he very soon made up his mind how to
act; and Carlos, fearing that worse might befall me, had let him.</p>

<p>But when the young girl had helped me to escape, Carlos, who
understood fully the very great risks I ran in going to Havana
in the ship that picked me up, had made use of O'Brien's own picaroons
to save me from him. That was the story.</p>

<p>Towards the end his breath came fast and short; there was a flush
on his face; his eyes gazed imploringly at me.</p>

<p>"You will stay here, now, till I die, and then &mdash;I want
you to protect.<hr>" He fell back on the pillows.</p>
