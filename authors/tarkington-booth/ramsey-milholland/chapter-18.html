<p>So everywhere over the country, that winter of 1916, there were
light-hearted boys skylarking&mdash;at college, or on the farms; and
in the towns the young machinists snowballed one another as they
came from the shops; while on this Sunday of the "frat" snow fight
probably several hundreds of thousands of youthful bachelors,
between the two oceans, went walking, like Ramsey, each with a
girl who could forget the weather. Yet boys of nineteen and in
the twenties were not light-hearted all the time that winter and
that spring and that summer. Most of them knew long, thoughtful
moments, as Ramsey did, when they seemed to be thinking not of
girls or work or play&mdash;nor of anything around them, but of some
more vital matter or prospect. And at such times they were grave,
but not ungentle.</p>

<p>For the long strain was on the country; underneath all its outward
seeming of things going on as usual there shook a deep vibration,
like the air trembling to vast organ pipes in diapasons too profound
to reach the ear as sound: one felt, not heard, thunder in the
ground under one's feet. The succession of diplomatic Notes came
to an end after the torpedoing of the <em>Sussex</em>; and at
last the tricky ruling Germans in Berlin gave their word to murder
no more, and people said, "This means peace for America, and all
is well for us," but everybody knew in his heart that nothing
was well for us, that there was no peace.</p>

<p>They said "All is well," while that thunder in the ground never
ceased&mdash;it grew deeper and heavier till all America shook with
it and it became slowly audible as the voice of the old American
soil wherein lay those who had defended it aforetime, a soil that
bred those who would defend it again, for it was theirs; and the
meaning of it &mdash;Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness&mdash;was
theirs, and theirs to defend. And they knew they would defend
it, and that more than the glory of a Nation was at stake. The
Freedom of Man was at stake. So, gradually, the sacred thunder
reached the ears of the young men and gave them those deep moments
that came to them whether they sat in the classroom or the counting-room,
or walked with the plow, or stood to the machine, or behind the
ribbon counter. Thus the thunder shook them and tried them and
slowly came into their lives and changed everything for them.</p>

<p>Hate of the Germans was not bred; but a contempt for what Germany
had shown in lieu of a national heart; a contempt as mighty and
profound as the resolve that the German way and the German will
should prevail in America, nor in any country of the world that
would be free. And when the German Kaiser laid his command upon
America, that no American should take his ship upon the free seas,
death being the penalty for any who disobeyed, then the German
Kaiser got his answer, not only to this new law he had made for
us, but to many other thoughts of his. Yet the answer was for
some time delayed.</p>

<p>There was a bitter Sunday, and its bitterness went everywhere,
to every place in the whole world that held high and generous
hearts. Its bitterness came to the special meeting in the "Frat
hall," where there were hearts, indeed, of that right sort, and
one of them became vocal in its bitterness. This was the heart
of Fred Mitchell, who was now an authority, being president of
the Junior Class, chairman of the Prom Committee, and other things
pleasant to be and to live for at his age.</p>

<p>"For me, Brothers," he said, "I'd think I'd a great deal rather
have been shot through the head than heard the news from Washington
to-day! I tell you, I've spent the meanest afternoon I ever did
in my life, and I guess it's been pretty much the same with all
of us. The worst of it is, it looks as though there isn't a thing
in the world we can do. The country's been betrayed by a few blatherskites
and boneheads that had the power to do it, and all we can do we've
just got to stand it. But there's some Americans that aren't just
standing it, and I want to tell you a lot of 'em are men from
the universities, just like us. They're <em>over there</em> right
now; they haven't said much&mdash;they just packed up and went. They're
flying for France and for England and for Canada; they're fighting
under every flag on the right side of the Western Front; and they're
driving ambulances at Verdun and ammunition trucks at the Somme.
Well, there's going to be a lot more American boys on all these
jobs mighty soon, on account of what those men did in Congress
to-day. If they won't give us a chance to do something under our
own flag, then we'll have to go and do it under some other flag;
and I want to tell you I'm one that's going to <em>go!</em> I'll
stick it out in college up to Easter, and then if there's still
no chance to go under the Stars and Stripes I'll maybe have to
go under the flag my great-great-grandfather fought against in
1776, but, anyhow, I'll <em>go!</em>"</p>

<p>It was in speaking to Ramsey of this declaration that Dora said
Fred was a "dangerous firebrand." They were taking another February
walk, but the February was February, 1917; and the day was dry
and sunny. "It's just about a year ago," she said.</p>

<p>"What is?" Ramsey asked.</p>

<p>"That first time we went walking. Don't you remember?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <em>that</em> day? Yes, I remember it was snowing."</p>

<p>"And so cold and blowy!" she added. "It seems a long time ago.
I like walking with you, Ramsey. You're so quiet and solid &mdash;I've
always felt I could talk to you just anyhow I pleased, and you
wouldn't mind. I'll miss these walks with you when we're out of
college."</p>

<p>He chuckled. "That's funny!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because we've only taken four besides this: two last year, and
another week before last, and another last week. This is only
the fifth."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Is that all? It seemed to me we'd gone ever so
often!"  She laughed. "I'm afraid you won't think that seems much
as if I'd liked going, but I really have. And, by the way, you've
never called on me at all. Perhaps it's because I've forgotten
to ask you."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," Ramsey said, and scuffed his shoes on the path, presently
explaining rather huskily that he "never <em>was</em> much of
a caller"; and he added, "or anything."</p>

<p>"Well, you must come if you ever care to," she said, with a big-sister
graciousness. "The Dorm chaperon sits there, of course, but ours
is a jolly one and you'd like her. You've probably met her &mdash;Mrs.
Hustings?&mdash;when you've called on other girls at our old shop."</p>

<p>"No," said Ramsey. "I never was much of a&mdash;" He paused, fearing
that he might be repeating himself, and too hastily amended his
intention. "I never liked any girl enough to go and call on her."</p>

<p>"Ramsey Milholland!" she cried. "Why, when we were in school
half the room used to be talking about how you and that pretty
Milla&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" Ramsey protested, again too hurriedly. "I never called
on her. We just went walking."</p>

<p>A moment later his colour suddenly became fiery. "I don't mean
&mdash;I mean&mdash;" he stammered. "It was walking, of course &mdash;I
mean we did go out walking but it wasn't walking like&mdash;like this."
He concluded with a fit of coughing which seemed to rack him.</p>

<p>Dora threw back her head and laughed delightfully. "Don't you
apologize!" she said. "<em>I</em> didn't when I said it seemed
to me that we've gone walking so often, when in reality it's only
four or five times altogether. I think I can explain, though:
I think it came partly from a feeling I have that I can rely on
you&mdash;that you're a good, solid, reliable sort of person. I remember
from the time we were little children, you always had a sort of
worried, honest look in school; and you used to make a dent in
your forehead&mdash;you meant it for a frown&mdash;whenever I caught your
eye. You hated me so honestly, and you were so honestly afraid
I wouldn't see it!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no&mdash;no&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;yes!" she laughed, then grew serious. "My feeling about
you&mdash;that you were a person to be relied on, I mean &mdash;I think
it began that evening in our freshman year, after the <em>Lusitania</em>,
when I stopped you on campus and you went with me, and I couldn't
help crying, and you were so nice and quiet. I hardly realized
then that it was the first time we'd ever really talked together&mdash;of
course <em>I</em> did all the talking!&mdash;and yet we'd known each
other so many years. I thought of it afterward. But what gave
me such a different view of you, I'd always thought you were one
of that truculent sort of boys, always just bursting for a fight;
but you showed me you'd really never had a fight in your life
and hated fighting, and that you sympathized with my feeling about
war." She stopped speaking to draw in her breath with a sharp
sigh. "Ah, don't you remember what I've told you all along? How
it keeps coming closer and closer&mdash;and now it's almost here! Isn't
it <em>unthinkable?</em> And what can we do to stop it, we poor
few who feel that we <em>must</em> stop it?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Ramsey began uncomfortably. "Of course I &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You can't do much," she said. "I know. None of us can. What
can any little group do? There are so few of us among the undergraduates&mdash;and
only one in the whole faculty. All the rest are for war. But we
mustn't give up; we must never feel afterward that we left anything
undone; we must fight to the last breath!"</p>

<p>"'Fight'?" he repeated wonderingly, then chuckled.</p>

<p>"Oh, as a figure of speech," she said, impatiently. "Our language
is full of barbaric figures left over from the dark ages. But,
oh, Ramsey!"&mdash;she touched his sleeve&mdash;"I've heard that Fred Mitchell
is saying that he's going to Canada after Easter, to try to get
into the Canadian aviation corps. If it's true, he's a dangerous
firebrand, I think. Is it true?"</p>

<p>"I guess so. He's been talking that way some."</p>

<p>"But why do you <em>let</em> him talk that way?" she cried. "He's
your roommate; surely you have more influence with him than anybody
else has. Couldn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shook his head slowly, while upon his face the faintly indicated
modellings of a grin hinted of an inner laughter at some surreptitious
thought. "Well, you know, Fred says himself sometimes, I don't
seem to be much of a talker exactly!"</p>

<p>"I know. But don't you see? That sort of thing is contagious.
Others will think they ought to go if he does; he's popular and
quite a leader. Can't you do anything with him?"</p>

<p>She waited for him to answer. "Can't you?" she insisted.</p>

<p>The grin had disappeared, and Ramsey grew red again. He seemed
to wish to speak, to heave with speech that declined to be spoken
and would not rouse up from his inwards. Finally he uttered words.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>well, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know," she said. "A man&mdash;or a boy!&mdash;always hates to be
intruding his own convictions upon other men, especially in a
case like this, where he might be afraid of some idiot's thinking
him unmanlike. But Ramsey&mdash;" Suddenly she broke off and looked
at him attentively; his discomfort had become so obvious that
suspicion struck her. She spoke sharply. "Ramsey <em>you</em>
aren't dreaming of doing such a thing, are you?"</p>

<p>"What such a thing?"</p>

<p>"Fred hasn't influenced <em>you</em>, has he? You aren't planning
to go with him, are you?"</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To join the Canadian aviation."</p>

<p>"No; I hadn't thought of doing it."</p>

<p>She sighed again, relieved. "I had a queer feeling about you
just then&mdash;that you <em>were</em> thinking of doing some such
thing. You looked so odd&mdash;and you're always so quiet, anybody
might not really know what you do think. But I'm not wrong about
you, am I, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>They had come to the foot of the steps that led up to the entrance
of her dormitory, and their walk was at an end. As they stopped
and faced each other, she looked at him earnestly; but he did
not meet the scrutiny, his eyelids fell.</p>

<p>"I'm not wrong, am I, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>"About what?" he murmured, uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"You are my friend, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it's all right," she said. "That relieves me and makes
me happier than I was just now, for of course if you're my friend
you wouldn't let me make any mistake about you. I believe you,
and now, just before I go in and we won't see much of each other
for a week&mdash;if you still want me to go with you again next Sunday&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;won't you, please?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like. But I want to tell you now that I count on
you in all this, even though you don't 'talk much,' as you say;
I count on you more than I do on anybody else, and I trust you
when you say you're my friend, and it makes me happy. And I think
perhaps you're right about Fred Mitchell. Talk isn't everything,
nobody knows that better than I, who talk so much! and I think
that, instead of talking to Fred, a steady, quiet influence like
yours would do more good than any amount of arguing. So I trust
you, you see? And I'm sorry I had that queer doubt of you." She
held out her hand. "Unless I happen to see you on the campus for
a minute, in the meantime, it's good-bye until a week from to-day.
So&mdash;well, so, good-bye until then!"</p>

<p>"Wait," said Ramsey.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>He made a great struggle. "I'm not influencing Fred not to go,"
he said. "<em>I&mdash;</em>don't want you to trust me to do anything
like that."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I think it's all right for him to go, if he wants to," Ramsey
said, miserably.</p>

<p>"You do? For him to go to <em>fight?</em>"</p>

<p>He swallowed. "Yes."</p>

<p>"<em>Oh!</em>" she cried, turned even redder than he, and ran
up the stone steps. But before the storm doors closed upon her
she looked down to where he stood, with his eyes still lowered,
a lonely-seeming figure, upon the pavement below. Her voice caught
upon a sob as she spoke.</p>

<p>"If you feel like that, you might as well go and enlist, yourself,"
she said, bitterly. "I can't &mdash;I couldn't&mdash;speak to you again
after this!"</p>
