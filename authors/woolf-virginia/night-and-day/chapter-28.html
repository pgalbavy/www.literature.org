<p>Like a strain of music, the effect of Katharine’s presence slowly
died from the room in which Ralph sat alone. The music had ceased
in the rapture of its melody. He strained to catch the faintest
lingering echoes; for a moment the memory lulled him into peace;
but soon it failed, and he paced the room so hungry for the sound
to come again that he was conscious of no other desire left in
life. She had gone without speaking; abruptly a chasm had been
cut in his course, down which the tide of his being plunged in
disorder; fell upon rocks; flung itself to destruction. The distress
had an effect of physical ruin and disaster. He trembled; he was
white; he felt exhausted, as if by a great physical effort. He
sank at last into a chair standing opposite her empty one, and
marked, mechanically, with his eye upon the clock, how she went
farther and farther from him, was home now, and now, doubtless,
again with Rodney. But it was long before he could realize these
facts; the immense desire for her presence churned his senses
into foam, into froth, into a haze of emotion that removed all
facts from his grasp, and gave him a strange sense of distance,
even from the material shapes of wall and window by which he was
surrounded. The prospect of the future, now that the strength
of his passion was revealed to him, appalled him.</p>

<p>The marriage would take place in September, she had said; that
allowed him, then, six full months in which to undergo these terrible
extremes of emotion. Six months of torture, and after that the
silence of the grave, the isolation of the insane, the exile of
the damned; at best, a life from which the chief good was knowingly
and for ever excluded. An impartial judge might have assured him
that his chief hope of recovery lay in this mystic temper, which
identified a living woman with much that no human beings long
possess in the eyes of each other; she would pass, and the desire
for her vanish, but his belief in what she stood for, detached
from her, would remain. This line of thought offered, perhaps,
some respite, and possessed of a brain that had its station considerably
above the tumult of the senses, he tried to reduce the vague and
wandering incoherency of his emotions to order. The sense of self-preservation
was strong in him, and Katharine herself had strangely revived
it by convincing him that his family deserved and needed all his
strength. She was right, and for their sake, if not for his own,
this passion, which could bear no fruit, must be cut off, uprooted,
shown to be as visionary and baseless as she had maintained. The
best way of achieving this was not to run away from her, but to
face her, and having steeped himself in her qualities, to convince
his reason that they were, as she assured him, not those that
he imagined. She was a practical woman, a domestic wife for an
inferior poet, endowed with romantic beauty by some freak of unintelligent
Nature. No doubt her beauty itself would not stand examination.
He had the means of settling this point at least. He possessed
a book of photographs from the Greek statues; the head of a goddess,
if the lower part were concealed, had often given him the ecstasy
of being in Katharine’s presence. He took it down from the shelf
and found the picture. To this he added a note from her, bidding
him meet her at the Zoo. He had a flower which he had picked at
Kew to teach her botany. Such were his relics. He placed them
before him, and set himself to visualize her so clearly that no
deception or delusion was possible. In a second he could see her,
with the sun slanting across her dress, coming towards him down
the green walk at Kew. He made her sit upon the seat beside him.
He heard her voice, so low and yet so decided in its tone; she
spoke reasonably of indifferent matters. He could see her faults,
and analyze her virtues. His pulse became quieter, and his brain
increased in clarity. This time she could not escape him. The
illusion of her presence became more and more complete. They seemed
to pass in and out of each other’s minds, questioning and answering.
The utmost fullness of communion seemed to be theirs. Thus united,
he felt himself raised to an eminence, exalted, and filled with
a power of achievement such as he had never known in singleness.
Once more he told over conscientiously her faults, both of face
and character; they were clearly known to him; but they merged
themselves in the flawless union that was born of their association.
They surveyed life to its uttermost limits. How deep it was when
looked at from this height! How sublime! How the commonest things
moved him almost to tears! Thus, he forgot the inevitable limitations;
he forgot her absence, he thought it of no account whether she
married him or another; nothing mattered, save that she should
exist, and that he should love her. Some words of these reflections
were uttered aloud, and it happened that among them were the words,
"I love her." It was the first time that he had used the word
"love" to describe his feeling; madness, romance, hallucination&mdash;he
had called it by these names before; but having, apparently by
accident, stumbled upon the word "love," he repeated it again
and again with a sense of revelation.</p>

<p>"But I’m in love with you!" he exclaimed, with something like
dismay. He leant against the window-sill, looking over the city
as she had looked. Everything had become miraculously different
and completely distinct. His feelings were justified and needed
no further explanation. But he must impart them to some one, because
his discovery was so important that it concerned other people
too. Shutting the book of Greek photographs, and hiding his relics,
he ran downstairs, snatched his coat, and passed out of doors.</p>

<p>The lamps were being lit, but the streets were dark enough and
empty enough to let him walk his fastest, and to talk aloud as
he walked. He had no doubt where he was going. He was going to
find Mary Datchet. The desire to share what he felt, with some
one who understood it, was so imperious that he did not question
it. He was soon in her street. He ran up the stairs leading to
her flat two steps at a time, and it never crossed his mind that
she might not be at home. As he rang her bell, he seemed to himself
to be announcing the presence of something wonderful that was
separate from himself, and gave him power and authority over all
other people. Mary came to the door after a moment’s pause. He
was perfectly silent, and in the dusk his face looked completely
white. He followed her into her room.</p>

<p>"Do you know each other?" she said, to his extreme surprise,
for he had counted on finding her alone. A young man rose, and
said that he knew Ralph by sight.</p>

<p>"We were just going through some papers," said Mary. "Mr. Basnett
has to help me, because I don’t know much about my work yet. It’s
the new society," she explained. "I’m the secretary. I’m no longer
at Russell Square."</p>

<p>The voice in which she gave this information was so constrained
as to sound almost harsh.</p>

<p>"What are your aims?" said Ralph. He looked neither at Mary nor
at Mr. Basnett. Mr. Basnett thought he had seldom seen a more
disagreeable or formidable man than this friend of Mary’s, this
sarcastic-looking, white-faced Mr. Denham, who seemed to demand,
as if by right, an account of their proposals, and to criticize
them before he had heard them. Nevertheless, he explained his
projects as clearly as he could, and knew that he wished Mr. Denham
to think well of them.</p>

<p>"I see," said Ralph, when he had done. "D’you know, Mary," he
suddenly remarked, "I believe I’m in for a cold. Have you any
quinine?" The look which he cast at her frightened her; it expressed
mutely, perhaps without his own consciousness, something deep,
wild, and passionate. She left the room at once. Her heart beat
fast at the knowledge of Ralph’s presence; but it beat with pain,
and with an extraordinary fear. She stood listening for a moment
to the voices in the next room.</p>

<p>"Of course, I agree with you," she heard Ralph say, in this strange
voice, to Mr. Basnett. "But there’s more that might be done. Have
you seen Judson, for instance? You should make a point of getting
him."</p>

<p>Mary returned with the quinine.</p>

<p>"Judson’s address?" Mr. Basnett inquired, pulling out his notebook
and preparing to write. For twenty minutes, perhaps, he wrote
down names, addresses, and other suggestions that Ralph dictated
to him. Then, when Ralph fell silent, Mr. Basnett felt that his
presence was not desired, and thanking Ralph for his help, with
a sense that he was very young and ignorant compared with him,
he said good-bye.</p>

<p>"Mary," said Ralph, directly Mr. Basnett had shut the door and
they were alone together. "Mary," he repeated. But the old difficulty
of speaking to Mary without reserve prevented him from continuing.
His desire to proclaim his love for Katharine was still strong
in him, but he had felt, directly he saw Mary, that he could not
share it with her. The feeling increased as he sat talking to
Mr. Basnett. And yet all the time he was thinking of Katharine,
and marveling at his love. The tone in which he spoke Mary’s name
was harsh.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ralph?" she asked, startled by his tone. She looked
at him anxiously, and her little frown showed that she was trying
painfully to understand him, and was puzzled. He could feel her
groping for his meaning, and he was annoyed with her, and thought
how he had always found her slow, painstaking, and clumsy. He
had behaved badly to her, too, which made his irritation the more
acute. Without waiting for him to answer, she rose as if his answer
were indifferent to her, and began to put in order some papers
that Mr. Basnett had left on the table. She hummed a scrap of
a tune under her breath, and moved about the room as if she were
occupied in making things tidy, and had no other concern.</p>

<p>"You’ll stay and dine?" she said casually, returning to her seat.</p>

<p>"No," Ralph replied. She did not press him further. They sat
side by side without speaking, and Mary reached her hand for her
work basket, and took out her sewing and threaded a needle.</p>

<p>"That’s a clever young man," Ralph observed, referring to Mr.
Basnett.</p>

<p>"I’m glad you thought so. It’s tremendously interesting work,
and considering everything, I think we’ve done very well. But
I’m inclined to agree with you; we ought to try to be more conciliatory.
We’re absurdly strict. It’s difficult to see that there may be
sense in what one’s opponents say, though they are one’s opponents.
Horace Basnett is certainly too uncompromising. I mustn’t forget
to see that he writes that letter to Judson. You’re too busy,
I suppose, to come on to our committee?" She spoke in the most
impersonal manner.</p>

<p>"I may be out of town," Ralph replied, with equal distance of
manner.</p>

<p>"Our executive meets every week, of course," she observed. "But
some of our members don’t come more than once a month. Members
of Parliament are the worst; it was a mistake, I think, to ask
them."</p>

<p>She went on sewing in silence.</p>

<p>"You’ve not taken your quinine," she said, looking up and seeing
the tabloids upon the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>"I don’t want it," said Ralph shortly.</p>

<p>"Well, you know best," she replied tranquilly.</p>

<p>"Mary, I’m a brute!" he exclaimed. "Here I come and waste your
time, and do nothing but make myself disagreeable."</p>

<p>"A cold coming on does make one feel wretched," she replied.</p>

<p>"I’ve not got a cold. That was a lie. There’s nothing the matter
with me. I’m mad, I suppose. I ought to have had the decency to
keep away. But I wanted to see you&mdash;I wanted to tell you &mdash;I’m
in love, Mary." He spoke the word, but, as he spoke it, it seemed
robbed of substance.</p>

<p>"In love, are you?" she said quietly. "I’m glad, Ralph."</p>

<p>"I suppose I’m in love. Anyhow, I’m out of my mind. I can’t think,
I can’t work, I don’t care a hang for anything in the world. Good
Heavens, Mary! I’m in torment! One moment I’m happy; next I’m
miserable. I hate her for half an hour; then I’d give my whole
life to be with her for ten minutes; all the time I don’t know
what I feel, or why I feel it; it’s insanity, and yet it’s perfectly
reasonable. Can you make any sense of it? Can you see what’s happened?
I’m raving, I know; don’t listen, Mary; go on with your work."</p>

<p>He rose and began, as usual, to pace up and down the room. He
knew that what he had just said bore very little resemblance to
what he felt, for Mary’s presence acted upon him like a very strong
magnet, drawing from him certain expressions which were not those
he made use of when he spoke to himself, nor did they represent
his deepest feelings. He felt a little contempt for himself at
having spoken thus; but somehow he had been forced into speech.</p>

<p>"Do sit down," said Mary suddenly. "You make me so&mdash;" She spoke
with unusual irritability, and Ralph, noticing it with surprise,
sat down at once.</p>

<p>"You haven’t told me her name&mdash;you’d rather not, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Her name? Katharine Hilbery."</p>

<p>"But she’s engaged&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To Rodney. They’re to be married in September."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mary. But in truth the calm of his manner, now
that he was sitting down once more, wrapt her in the presence
of something which she felt to be so strong, so mysterious, so
incalculable, that she scarcely dared to attempt to intercept
it by any word or question that she was able to frame. She looked
at Ralph blankly, with a kind of awe in her face, her lips slightly
parted, and her brows raised. He was apparently quite unconscious
of her gaze. Then, as if she could look no longer, she leant back
in her chair, and half closed her eyes. The distance between them
hurt her terribly; one thing after another came into her mind,
tempting her to assail Ralph with questions, to force him to confide
in her, and to enjoy once more his intimacy. But she rejected
every impulse, for she could not speak without doing violence
to some reserve which had grown between them, putting them a little
far from each other, so that he seemed to her dignified and remote,
like a person she no longer knew well.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that I could do for you?" she asked gently,
and even with courtesy, at length.</p>

<p>"You could see her&mdash;no, that’s not what I want; you mustn’t bother
about me, Mary." He, too, spoke very gently.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid no third person can do anything to help," she added.</p>

<p>"No," he shook his head. "Katharine was saying to-day how lonely
we are." She saw the effort with which he spoke Katharine’s name,
and believed that he forced himself to make amends now for his
concealment in the past. At any rate, she was conscious of no
anger against him; but rather of a deep pity for one condemned
to suffer as she had suffered. But in the case of Katharine it
was different; she was indignant with Katharine.</p>

<p>"There’s always work," she said, a little aggressively.</p>

<p>Ralph moved directly.</p>

<p>"Do you want to be working now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, no. It’s Sunday," she replied. "I was thinking of Katharine.
She doesn’t understand about work. She’s never had to. She doesn’t
know what work is. I’ve only found out myself quite lately. But
it’s the thing that saves one &mdash;I’m sure of that."</p>

<p>"There are other things, aren’t there?" he hesitated.</p>

<p>"Nothing that one can count upon," she returned. "After all,
other people&mdash;" she stopped, but forced herself to go on. "Where
should I be now if I hadn’t got to go to my office every day?
Thousands of people would tell you the same thing&mdash;thousands of
women. I tell you, work is the only thing that saved me, Ralph."
He set his mouth, as if her words rained blows on him; he looked
as if he had made up his mind to bear anything she might say,
in silence. He had deserved it, and there would be relief in having
to bear it. But she broke off, and rose as if to fetch something
from the next room. Before she reached the door she turned back,
and stood facing him, self-possessed, and yet defiant and formidable
in her composure.</p>

<p>"It’s all turned out splendidly for me," she said. "It will for
you, too. I’m sure of that. Because, after all, Katharine is worth
it."</p>

<p>"Mary&mdash;!" he exclaimed. But her head was turned away, and he
could not say what he wished to say. "Mary, you’re splendid,"
he concluded. She faced him as he spoke, and gave him her hand.
She had suffered and relinquished, she had seen her future turned
from one of infinite promise to one of barrenness, and yet, somehow,
over what she scarcely knew, and with what results she could hardly
foretell, she had conquered. With Ralph’s eyes upon her, smiling
straight back at him serenely and proudly, she knew, for the first
time, that she had conquered. She let him kiss her hand.</p>

<p>The streets were empty enough on Sunday night, and if the Sabbath,
and the domestic amusements proper to the Sabbath, had not kept
people indoors, a high strong wind might very probably have done
so. Ralph Denham was aware of a tumult in the street much in accordance
with his own sensations. The gusts, sweeping along the Strand,
seemed at the same time to blow a clear space across the sky in
which stars appeared, and for a short time the quicks-peeding
silver moon riding through clouds, as if they were waves of water
surging round her and over her. They swamped her, but she emerged;
they broke over her and covered her again; she issued forth indomitable.
In the country fields all the wreckage of winter was being dispersed;
the dead leaves, the withered bracken, the dry and discolored
grass, but no bud would be broken, nor would the new stalks that
showed above the earth take any harm, and perhaps to-morrow a
line of blue or yellow would show through a slit in their green.
But the whirl of the atmosphere alone was in Denham’s mood, and
what of star or blossom appeared was only as a light gleaming
for a second upon heaped waves fast following each other. He had
not been able to speak to Mary, though for a moment he had come
near enough to be tantalized by a wonderful possibility of understanding.
But the desire to communicate something of the very greatest importance
possessed him completely; he still wished to bestow this gift
upon some other human being; he sought their company. More by
instinct than by conscious choice, he took the direction which
led to Rodney’s rooms. He knocked loudly upon his door; but no
one answered. He rang the bell. It took him some time to accept
the fact that Rodney was out. When he could no longer pretend
that the sound of the wind in the old building was the sound of
some one rising from his chair, he ran downstairs again, as if
his goal had been altered and only just revealed to him. He walked
in the direction of Chelsea.</p>

<p>But physical fatigue, for he had not dined and had tramped both
far and fast, made him sit for a moment upon a seat on the Embankment.
One of the regular occupants of those seats, an elderly man who
had drunk himself, probably, out of work and lodging, drifted
up, begged a match, and sat down beside him. It was a windy night,
he said; times were hard; some long story of bad luck and injustice
followed, told so often that the man seemed to be talking to himself,
or, perhaps, the neglect of his audience had long made any attempt
to catch their attention seem scarcely worth while. When he began
to speak Ralph had a wild desire to talk to him; to question him;
to make him understand. He did, in fact, interrupt him at one
point; but it was useless. The ancient story of failure, ill-luck,
undeserved disaster, went down the wind, disconnected syllables
flying past Ralph’s ears with a queer alternation of loudness
and faintness as if, at certain moments, the man’s memory of his
wrongs revived and then flagged, dying down at last into a grumble
of resignation, which seemed to represent a final lapse into the
accustomed despair. The unhappy voice afflicted Ralph, but it
also angered him. And when the elderly man refused to listen and
mumbled on, an odd image came to his mind of a lighthouse besieged
by the flying bodies of lost birds, who were dashed senseless,
by the gale, against the glass. He had a strange sensation that
he was both lighthouse and bird; he was steadfast and brilliant;
and at the same time he was whirled, with all other things, senseless
against the glass. He got up, left his tribute of silver, and
pressed on, with the wind against him. The image of the lighthouse
and the storm full of birds persisted, taking the place of more
definite thoughts, as he walked past the Houses of Parliament
and down Grosvenor Road, by the side of the river. In his state
of physical fatigue, details merged themselves in the vaster prospect,
of which the flying gloom and the intermittent lights of lamp-posts
and private houses were the outward token, but he never lost his
sense of walking in the direction of Katharine’s house. He took
it for granted that something would then happen, and, as he walked
on, his mind became more and more full of pleasure and expectancy.
Within a certain radius of her house the streets came under the
influence of her presence. Each house had an individuality known
to Ralph, because of the tremendous individuality of the house
in which she lived. For some yards before reaching the Hilberys’
door he walked in a trance of pleasure, but when he reached it,
and pushed the gate of the little garden open, he hesitated. He
did not know what to do next. There was no hurry, however, for
the outside of the house held pleasure enough to last him some
time longer. He crossed the road, and leant against the balustrade
of the Embankment, fixing his eyes upon the house.</p>

<p>Lights burnt in the three long windows of the drawing-room. The
space of the room behind became, in Ralph’s vision, the center
of the dark, flying wilderness of the world; the justification
for the welter of confusion surrounding it; the steady light which
cast its beams, like those of a lighthouse, with searching composure
over the trackless waste. In this little sanctuary were gathered
together several different people, but their identity was dissolved
in a general glory of something that might, perhaps, be called
civilization; at any rate, all dryness, all safety, all that stood
up above the surge and preserved a consciousness of its own, was
centered in the drawing-room of the Hilberys. Its purpose was
beneficent; and yet so far above his level as to have something
austere about it, a light that cast itself out and yet kept itself
aloof. Then he began, in his mind, to distinguish different individuals
within, consciously refusing as yet to attack the figure of Katharine.
His thoughts lingered over Mrs. Hilbery and Cassandra; and then
he turned to Rodney and Mr. Hilbery. Physically, he saw them bathed
in that steady flow of yellow light which filled the long oblongs
of the windows; in their movements they were beautiful; and in
their speech he figured a reserve of meaning, unspoken, but understood.
At length, after all this half-conscious selection and arrangement,
he allowed himself to approach the figure of Katharine herself;
and instantly the scene was flooded with excitement. He did not
see her in the body; he seemed curiously to see her as a shape
of light, the light itself; he seemed, simplified and exhausted
as he was, to be like one of those lost birds fascinated by the
lighthouse and held to the glass by the splendor of the blaze.</p>

<p>These thoughts drove him to tramp a beat up and down the pavement
before the Hilberys’ gate. He did not trouble himself to make
any plans for the future. Something of an unknown kind would decide
both the coming year and the coming hour. Now and again, in his
vigil, he sought the light in the long windows, or glanced at
the ray which gilded a few leaves and a few blades of grass in
the little garden. For a long time the light burnt without changing.
He had just reached the limit of his beat and was turning, when
the front door opened, and the aspect of the house was entirely
changed. A black figure came down the little pathway and paused
at the gate. Denham understood instantly that it was Rodney. Without
hesitation, and conscious only of a great friendliness for any
one coming from that lighted room, he walked straight up to him
and stopped him. In the flurry of the wind Rodney was taken aback,
and for the moment tried to press on, muttering something, as
if he suspected a demand upon his charity.</p>

<p>"Goodness, Denham, what are you doing here?" he exclaimed, recognizing
him.</p>

<p>Ralph mumbled something about being on his way home. They walked
on together, though Rodney walked quick enough to make it plain
that he had no wish for company.</p>

<p>He was very unhappy. That afternoon Cassandra had repulsed him;
he had tried to explain to her the difficulties of the situation,
and to suggest the nature of his feelings for her without saying
anything definite or anything offensive to her. But he had lost
his head; under the goad of Katharine’s ridicule he had said too
much, and Cassandra, superb in her dignity and severity, had refused
to hear another word, and threatened an immediate return to her
home. His agitation, after an evening spent between the two women,
was extreme. Moreover, he could not help suspecting that Ralph
was wandering near the Hilberys’ house, at this hour, for reasons
connected with Katharine. There was probably some understanding
between them&mdash;not that anything of the kind mattered to him now.
He was convinced that he had never cared for any one save Cassandra,
and Katharine’s future was no concern of his. Aloud, he said,
shortly, that he was very tired and wished to find a cab. But
on Sunday night, on the Embankment, cabs were hard to come by,
and Rodney found himself constrained to walk some distance, at
any rate, in Denham’s company. Denham maintained his silence.
Rodney’s irritation lapsed. He found the silence oddly suggestive
of the good masculine qualities which he much respected, and had
at this moment great reason to need. After the mystery, difficulty,
and uncertainty of dealing with the other sex, intercourse with
one’s own is apt to have a composing and even ennobling influence,
since plain speaking is possible and subterfuges of no avail.
Rodney, too, was much in need of a confidant; Katharine, despite
her promises of help, had failed him at the critical moment; she
had gone off with Denham; she was, perhaps, tormenting Denham
as she had tormented him. How grave and stable he seemed, speaking
little, and walking firmly, compared with what Rodney knew of
his own torments and indecisions! He began to cast about for some
way of telling the story of his relations with Katharine and Cassandra
that would not lower him in Denham’s eyes. It then occurred to
him that, perhaps, Katharine herself had confided in Denham; they
had something in common; it was likely that they had discussed
him that very afternoon. The desire to discover what they had
said of him now came uppermost in his mind. He recalled Katharine’s
laugh; he remembered that she had gone, laughing, to walk with
Denham.</p>

<p>"Did you stay long after we’d left?" he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>"No. We went back to my house."</p>

<p>This seemed to confirm Rodney’s belief that he had been discussed.
He turned over the unpalatable idea for a while, in silence.</p>

<p>"Women are incomprehensible creatures, Denham!" he then exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Um," said Denham, who seemed to himself possessed of complete
understanding, not merely of women, but of the entire universe.
He could read Rodney, too, like a book. He knew that he was unhappy,
and he pitied him, and wished to help him.</p>

<p>"You say something and they&mdash;fly into a passion. Or for no reason
at all, they laugh. I take it that no amount of education will&mdash;"
The remainder of the sentence was lost in the high wind, against
which they had to struggle; but Denham understood that he referred
to Katharine’s laughter, and that the memory of it was still hurting
him. In comparison with Rodney, Denham felt himself very secure;
he saw Rodney as one of the lost birds dashed senseless against
the glass; one of the flying bodies of which the air was full.
But he and Katharine were alone together, aloft, splendid, and
luminous with a twofold radiance. He pitied the unstable creature
beside him; he felt a desire to protect him, exposed without the
knowledge which made his own way so direct. They were united as
the adventurous are united, though one reaches the goal and the
other perishes by the way.</p>

<p>"You couldn’t laugh at some one you cared for."</p>

<p>This sentence, apparently addressed to no other human being,
reached Denham’s ears. The wind seemed to muffle it and fly away
with it directly. Had Rodney spoken those words?</p>

<p>"You love her." Was that his own voice, which seemed to sound
in the air several yards in front of him?</p>

<p>"I’ve suffered tortures, Denham, tortures!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know that."</p>

<p>"She’s laughed at me."</p>

<p>"Never&mdash;to me."</p>

<p>The wind blew a space between the words&mdash;blew them so far away
that they seemed unspoken.</p>

<p>"How I’ve loved her!"</p>

<p>This was certainly spoken by the man at Denham’s side. The voice
had all the marks of Rodney’s character, and recalled, with; strange
vividness, his personal appearance. Denham could see him against
the blank buildings and towers of the horizon. He saw him dignified,
exalted, and tragic, as he might have appeared thinking of Katharine
alone in his rooms at night.</p>

<p>"I am in love with Katharine myself. That is why I am here to-night."</p>

<p>Ralph spoke distinctly and deliberately, as if Rodney’s confession
had made this statement necessary.</p>

<p>Rodney exclaimed something inarticulate.</p>

<p>"Ah, I’ve always known it," he cried, "I’ve known it from the
first. You’ll marry her!"</p>

<p>The cry had a note of despair in it. Again the wind intercepted
their words. They said no more. At length they drew up beneath
a lamp-post, simultaneously.</p>

<p>"My God, Denham, what fools we both are!" Rodney exclaimed. They
looked at each other, queerly, in the light of the lamp. Fools!
They seemed to confess to each other the extreme depths of their
folly. For the moment, under the lamp-post, they seemed to be
aware of some common knowledge which did away with the possibility
