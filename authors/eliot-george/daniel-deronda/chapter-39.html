  &quot;Vor den Wissenden sich stellen
  Sicher ist's in alien F&auml;llen!
  Wenn du lange dich gequ&auml;let
  Weiss er gleich wo dir es fehlet;
  Auch auf Beifall darfst du hoffen,
  Denn er weiss wo du's getroffen,&quot;
            - GOETHE: <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">West-&ouml;stlicker Divan</span>.</p>

<p>Momentous things happened to Deronda the very evening of that visit to the
small house at Chelsea, when there was the discussion about Mirah's public
name. But for the family group there, what appeared to be the chief
sequence connected with it occurred two days afterward. About four o'clock
wheels paused before the door, and there came one of those knocks with an
accompanying ring which serve to magnify the sense of social existence in
a region where the most enlivening signals are usually those of the
muffin-man. All the girls were at home, and the two rooms were thrown
together to make space for Kate's drawing, as well as a great length of
embroidery which had taken the place of the satin cushions - a sort of
<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</span> in the courses of needlework, taken up by any clever
fingers that happened to be at liberty. It stretched across the front room
picturesquely enough, Mrs. Meyrick bending over it on one corner, Mab in
the middle, and Amy at the other end. Mirah, whose performances in point
of sewing were on the make-shift level of the tailor-bird's, her education
in that branch having been much neglected, was acting as reader to the
party, seated on a camp-stool; in which position she also served Kate as
model for a title-page vignette, symbolizing a fair public absorbed in the
successive volumes of the family tea-table. She was giving forth with
charming distinctness the delightful Essay of Elia, &quot;The Praise of
Chimney-Sweeps,&quot; and all we're smiling over the &quot;innocent blackness,&quot; when
the imposing knock and ring called their thoughts to loftier spheres, and
they looked up in wonderment.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear me!&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick; &quot;can it be Lady Mallinger? Is there a grand
carriage, Amy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No - only a hansom cab. It must be a gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Prime Minister, I should think,&quot; said Kate dryly. &quot;Hans says the
greatest man in London may get into a hansom cab.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, oh, oh!&quot; cried Mab. &quot;Suppose it should be Lord Russell!&quot;</p>

<p>The five bright faces were all looking amused when the old maid-servant
bringing in a card distractedly left the parlor-door open, and there was
seen bowing toward Mrs. Meyrick a figure quite unlike that of the
respected Premier - tall and physically impressive even in his kid and
kerseymere, with massive face, flamboyant hair, and gold spectacles: in
fact, as Mrs. Meyrick saw from the card, <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">Julius Klesmer</span>.</p>

<p>Even embarrassment could hardly have made the &quot;little mother&quot; awkward, but
quick in her perceptions she was at once aware of the situation, and felt
well satisfied that the great personage had come to Mirah instead of
requiring her to come to him; taking it as a sign of active interest. But
when he entered, the rooms shrank into closets, the cottage piano, Mab
thought, seemed a ridiculous toy, and the entire family existence as petty
and private as an establishment of mice in the Tuileries. Klesmer's
personality, especially his way of glancing round him, immediately
suggested vast areas and a multitudinous audience, and probably they made
the usual scenery of his consciousness, for we all of us carry on our
thinking in some habitual locus where there is a presence of other souls,
and those who take in a larger sweep than their neighbors are apt to seem
mightily vain and affected. Klesmer was vain, but not more so than many
contemporaries of heavy aspect, whose vanity leaps out and startles one
like a spear out of a walking-stick; as to his carriage and gestures,
these were as natural to him as the length of his fingers; and the rankest
affectation he could have shown would have been to look diffident and
demure. While his grandiose air was making Mab feel herself a ridiculous
toy to match the cottage piano, he was taking in the details around him
with a keen and thoroughly kind sensibility. He remembered a home no
longer than this on the outskirts of Bohemia; and in the figurative
Bohemia too he had had large acquaintance with the variety and romance
which belong to small incomes. He addressed Mrs. Meyrick with the utmost
deference.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope I have not taken too great a freedom. Being in the neighborhood, I
ventured to save time by calling. Our friend, Mr. Deronda, mentioned to me
an understanding that I was to have the honor of becoming acquainted with
a young lady here - Miss Lapidoth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Klesmer had really discerned Mirah in the first moment of entering, but,
with subtle politeness, he looked round bowingly at the three sisters as
if he were uncertain which was the young lady in question.</p>

<p>&quot;Those are my daughters: this is Miss Lapidoth,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick, waving
her hand toward Mirah.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah,&quot; said Klesmer, in a tone of gratified expectation, turning a radiant
smile and deep bow to Mirah, who, instead of being in the least taken by
surprise, had a calm pleasure in her face. She liked the look of Klesmer,
feeling sure that he would scold her, like a great musician and a kind
man.</p>

<p>&quot;You will not object to beginning our acquaintance by singing to me,&quot; he
added, aware that they would all be relieved by getting rid of
preliminaries.</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be very glad. It is good of you to be willing to listen to me,&quot;
said Mirah, moving to the piano. &quot;Shall I accompany myself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By all means,&quot; said Klesmer, seating himself, at Mrs. Meyrick's
invitation, where he could have a good view of the singer. The acute
little mother would not have acknowledged the weakness, but she really
said to herself, &quot;He will like her singing better if he sees her.&quot;</p>

<p>All the feminine hearts except Mirah's were beating fast with anxiety,
thinking Klesmer terrific as he sat with his listening frown on, and only
daring to look at him furtively. If he did say anything severe it would be
so hard for them all. They could only comfort themselves with thinking
that Prince Camaralzaman, who had heard the finest things, preferred
Mirah's singing to any other: - also she appeared to be doing her very
best, as if she were more instead of less at ease than usual.</p>

<p>The song she had chosen was a fine setting of some words selected from
Leopardi's grand Ode to Italy: - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;_O patria mia, vedo le mura c gli archi<br />
E le colonne e i simula-cri e l'erme<br />
Torridegli avi nostri_&quot; - <br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>This was recitative: then followed - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">Ma la gloria - non vedo</span>&quot; - <br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>a mournful melody, a rhythmic plaint. After this came a climax of devout
triumph - passing from the subdued adoration of a happy Andante in the
words - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;_Beatissimi voi.<br />
Che offriste il petto alle nemiche lance<br />
Per amor di costei che al sol vi diede_&quot; - <br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>to the joyous outburst of an exultant Allegro in - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>      &quot;_Oh viva, oh viva:<br />
Beatissimi voi<br />
Mentre nel monde si favelli o scriva._&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>When she had ended, Klesmer said after a moment - </p>

<p>&quot;That is Joseph Leo's music.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, he was my last master - at Vienna: so fierce and so good,&quot; said
Mirah, with a melancholy smile. &quot;He prophesied that my voice would not do
for the stage. And he was right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;_Con_tinue, if you please,&quot; said Klesmer, putting out his lips and
shaking his long fingers, while he went on with a smothered articulation
quite unintelligible to the audience.</p>

<p>The three girls detested him unanimously for not saying one word of
praise. Mrs. Meyrick was a little alarmed.</p>

<p>Mirah, simply bent on doing what Klesmer desired, and imagining that he
would now like to hear her sing some German, went through Prince
Radzivill's music to Gretchen's songs in the &quot;Faust,&quot; one after the other
without any interrogatory pause. When she had finished he rose and walked
to the extremity of the small space at command, then walked back to the
piano, where Mirah had risen from her seat and stood looking toward him
with her little hands crossed before her, meekly awaiting judgment; then
with a sudden unknitting of his brow and with beaming eyes, he stretched
out his hand and said abruptly, &quot;Let us shake hands: you are a musician.&quot;</p>

<p>Mab felt herself beginning to cry, and all the three girls held Klesmer
adorable. Mrs. Meyrick took a long breath.</p>

<p>But straightway the frown came again, the long hand, back uppermost, was
stretched out in quite a different sense to touch with finger-tip the back
of Mirah's, and with protruded lip he said - </p>

<p>&quot;Not for great tasks. No high roofs. We are no skylarks. We must be
modest.&quot; Klesmer paused here. And Mab ceased to think him adorable: &quot;as if
Mirah had shown the least sign of conceit!&quot;</p>

<p>Mirah was silent, knowing that there was a specific opinion to be waited
for, and Klesmer presently went on - &quot;I would not advise - I would not
further your singing in any larger space than a private drawing-room. But
you will do there. And here in London that is one of the best careers
open. Lessons will follow. Will you come and sing at a private concert at
my house on Wednesday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I shall be grateful,&quot; said Mirah, putting her hands together
devoutly. &quot;I would rather get my bread in that way than by anything more
public. I will try to improve. What should I work at most?&quot;</p>

<p>Klesmer made a preliminary answer in noises which sounded like words
bitten in two and swallowed before they were half out, shaking his fingers
the while, before he said, quite distinctly, &quot;I shall introduce you to
Astorga: he is the foster-father of good singing and will give you
advice.&quot; Then addressing Mrs. Meyrick, he added, &quot;Mrs. Klesmer will call
before Wednesday, with your permission.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We shall feel that to be a great kindness,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick.</p>

<p>&quot;You will sing to her,&quot; said Klesmer, turning again to Mirah. &quot;She is a
thorough musician, and has a soul with more ears to it than you will often
get in a musician. Your singing will satisfy her: - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'Vor den Wissenden sich stellen;'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>you know the rest?&quot;</p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>&quot;'Sicher ist's in alien F&auml;llen.'&quot;<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>said Mirah, promptly. And Klesmer saying &quot;Sch&ouml;n!&quot; put out his hand again
as a good-bye.</p>

<p>He had certainly chosen the most delicate way of praising Mirah, and the
Meyrick girls had now given him all their esteem. But imagine Mab's
feeling when suddenly fixing his eyes on her, he said decisively, &quot;That
young lady is musical, I see!&quot; She was a mere blush and sense of
scorching.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Mirah, on her behalf. &quot;And she has a touch.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, please, Mirah - a scramble, not a touch,&quot; said Mab, in anguish, with a
horrible fear of what the next thing might be: this dreadful divining
personage - evidently Satan in gray trousers - might order her to sit down
to the piano, and her heart was like molten wax in the midst of her. But
this was cheap payment for her amazed joy when Klesmer said benignantly,
turning to Mrs. Meyrick, &quot;Will she like to accompany Miss Lapidoth and
hear the music on Wednesday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There could hardly be a greater pleasure for her,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick.
&quot;She will be most glad and grateful.&quot;</p>

<p>Thereupon Klesmer bowed round to the three sisters more grandly than they
had ever been bowed to before. Altogether it was an amusing picture - the
little room with so much of its diagonal taken up in Klesmer's magnificent
bend to the small feminine figures like images a little less than life-
size, the grave Holbein faces on the walls, as many as were not otherwise
occupied, looking hard at this stranger who by his face seemed a dignified
contemporary of their own, but whose garments seemed a deplorable mockery
of the human form.</p>

<p>Mrs. Meyrick could not help going out of the room with Klesmer and closing
the door behind her. He understood her, and said with a frowning nod - </p>

<p>&quot;She will do: if she doesn't attempt too much and her voice holds out, she
can make an income. I know that is the great point: Deronda told me. You
are taking care of her. She looks like a good girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is an angel,&quot; said the warm-hearted woman.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; said Klesmer, with a playful nod; &quot;she is a pretty Jewess: the
angels must not get the credit of her. But I think she has found a
guardian angel,&quot; he ended, bowing himself out in this amiable way.</p>

<p>The four young creatures had looked at each other mutely till the door
banged and Mrs. Meyrick re-entered. Then there was an explosion. Mab
clapped her hands and danced everywhere inconveniently; Mrs. Meyrick
kissed Mirah and blessed her; Amy said emphatically, &quot;We can never get her
a new dress before Wednesday!&quot; and Kate exclaimed, &quot;Thank heaven my table
is not knocked over!&quot;</p>

<p>Mirah had reseated herself on the music-stool without speaking, and the
tears were rolling down her cheeks as she looked at her friends.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, now, Mab!&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick; &quot;come and sit down reasonably and let
us talk?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, let us talk,&quot; said Mab, cordially, coming back to her low seat and
caressing her knees. &quot;I am beginning to feel large again. Hans said he was
coming this afternoon. I wish he had been here - only there would have been
no room for him. Mirah, what are you looking sad for?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am too happy,&quot; said Mirah. &quot;I feel so full of gratitude to you all; and
he was so very kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, at last,&quot; said Mab, sharply. &quot;But he might have said something
encouraging sooner. I thought him dreadfully ugly when he sat frowning,
and only said, '_Con_tinue.' I hated him all the long way from the top of
his hair to the toe of his polished boot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nonsense, Mab; ho has a splendid profile,&quot; said Kate.</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">Now</span>, but not <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">then</span>. I cannot bear people to keep their minds bottled
up for the sake of letting them off with a pop. They seem to grudge making
you happy unless they can make you miserable beforehand. However, I
forgive him everything,&quot; said Mab, with a magnanimous air, &quot;but he has
invited me. I wonder why he fixed on me as the musical one? Was it because
I have a bulging forehead, ma, and peep from under it like a newt from
under a stone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was your way of listening to the singing, child,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick.
&quot;He has magic spectacles and sees everything through them, depend upon it.
But what was that German quotation you were so ready with, Mirah - you
learned puss?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that was not learning,&quot; said Mirah, her tearful face breaking into an
amused smile. &quot;I said it so many times for a lesson. It means that it is
safer to do anything - singing or anything else - before those who know and
understand all about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was why you were not one bit frightened, I suppose,&quot; said Amy. &quot;But
now, what we have to talk about is a dress for you on Wednesday.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want anything better than this black merino,&quot; said Mirah, rising
to show the effect. &quot;Some white gloves and some new <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">bottines</span>.&quot; She put
out her little foot, clad in the famous felt slipper.</p>

<p>&quot;There comes Hans,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick. &quot;Stand still, and let us hear what
he says about the dress. Artists are the best people to consult about such
things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't consult me, ma,&quot; said Kate, lifting up her eyebrow with a
playful complainingness. &quot;I notice mothers are like the people I deal
with - the girls' doings are always priced low.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dear child, the boys are such a trouble - we could never put up with
them, if we didn't make believe they were worth more,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick,
just as her boy entered. &quot;Hans, we want your opinion about Mirah's dress.
A great event has happened. Klesmer has been here, and she is going to
sing at his house on Wednesday among grand people. She thinks this dress
will do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me see,&quot; said Hans. Mirah in her childlike way turned toward him to
be looked at; and he, going to a little further distance, knelt with one
knee on a hassock to survey her.</p>

<p>&quot;This would be thought a very good stage-dress for me,&quot; she said,
pleadingly, &quot;in a part where I was to come on as a poor Jewess and sing to
fashionable Christians.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It would be effective,&quot; said Hans, with a considering air; &quot;it would
stand out well among the fashionable <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">chiffons</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you ought not to claim all the poverty on your side, Mirah,&quot; said
Amy. &quot;There are plenty of poor Christians and dreadfully rich Jews and
fashionable Jewesses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't mean any harm,&quot; said Mirah. &quot;Only I have been used to thinking
about my dress for parts in plays. And I almost always had a part with a
plain dress.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That makes me think it questionable,&quot; said Hans, who had suddenly become
as fastidious and conventional on this occasion as he had thought Deronda
was, apropos of the Berenice-pictures. &quot;It looks a little too theatrical.
We must not make you a <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">r&ocirc;le</span> of the poor Jewess - or of being a Jewess at
all.&quot; Hans had a secret desire to neutralize the Jewess in private life,
which he was in danger of not keeping secret.</p>

<p>&quot;But it is what I am really. I am not pretending anything. I shall never
be anything else,&quot; said Mirah. &quot;I always feel myself a Jewess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we can't feel that about you,&quot; said Hans, with a devout look. &quot;What
does it signify whether a perfect woman is a Jewess or not?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is your kind way of praising me; I never was praised so before,&quot;
said Mirah, with a smile, which was rather maddening to Hans and made him
feel still more of a cosmopolitan.</p>

<p>&quot;People don't think of me as a British Christian,&quot; he said, his face
creasing merrily. &quot;They think of me as an imperfectly handsome young man
and an unpromising painter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are wandering from the dress,&quot; said Amy. &quot;If that will not do,
how are we to get another before Wednesday? and to-morrow Sunday?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Indeed this will do,&quot; said Mirah, entreatingly. &quot;It is all real, you
know,&quot; here she looked at Hans - &quot;even if it seemed theatrical. Poor
Berenice sitting on the ruins - any one might say that was theatrical, but
I know that this is just what she would do.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am a scoundrel,&quot; said Hans, overcome by this misplaced trust. &quot;That is
my invention. Nobody knows that she did that. Shall you forgive me for not
saying so before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; said Mirah, after a momentary pause of surprise. &quot;You knew it
was what she would be sure to do - a Jewess who had not been faithful - who
had done what she did and was penitent. She could have no joy but to
afflict herself; and where else would she go? I think it is very beautiful
that you should enter so into what a Jewess would feel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The Jewesses of that time sat on ruins,&quot; said Hans, starting up with a
sense of being checkmated. &quot;That makes them convenient for pictures.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the dress - the dress,&quot; said Amy; &quot;is it settled?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes; is it not?&quot; said Mirah, looking doubtfully at Mrs. Meyrick, who in
her turn looked up at her son, and said, &quot;What do you think, Hans?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That dress will not do,&quot; said Hans, decisively. &quot;She is not going to sit
on ruins. You must jump into a cab with her, little mother, and go to
Regent Street. It's plenty of time to get anything you like - a black silk
dress such as ladies wear. She must not be taken for an object of charity.
She has talents to make people indebted to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it is what Mr. Deronda would like - for her to have a handsome
dress,&quot; said Mrs. Meyrick, deliberating.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course it is,&quot; said Hans, with some sharpness. &quot;You may take my word
for what a gentleman would feel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to do what Mr. Deronda would like me to do,&quot; said Mirah, gravely,
seeing that Mrs. Meyrick looked toward her; and Hans, turning on his heel,
went to Kate's table and took up one of her drawings as if his interest
needed a new direction.</p>

<p>&quot;Shouldn't you like to make a study of Klesmer's head, Hans?&quot; said Kate.
&quot;I suppose you have often seen him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seen him!&quot; exclaimed Hans, immediately throwing back his head and mane,
seating himself at the piano and looking round him as if he were surveying
an amphitheatre, while he held his fingers down perpendicularly toward the
keys. But then in another instant he wheeled round on the stool, looked at
Mirah and said, half timidly - &quot;Perhaps you don't like this mimicry; you
must always stop my nonsense when you don't like it.&quot;</p>

<p>Mirah had been smiling at the swiftly-made image, and she smiled still,
but with a touch of something else than amusement, as she said - &quot;Thank
you. But you have never done anything I did not like. I hardly think he
could, belonging to you,&quot; she added, looking at Mrs. Meyrick.</p>

<p>In this way Hans got food for his hope. How could the rose help it when
several bees in succession took its sweet odor as a sign of personal
attachment?</p>
