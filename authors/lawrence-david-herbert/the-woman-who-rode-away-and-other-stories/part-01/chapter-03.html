<p>Winter had now come, in the high valley, with snow that melted in
the day's sun, and nights that were bitter cold.  She lived on, in
a kind of daze, feeling her power ebbing more and more away from
her, as if her will were leaving her.  She felt always in the same
relaxed, confused, victimised state, unless the sweetened herb
drink would numb her mind altogether, and release her senses into a
sort of heightened, mystic acuteness and a feeling as if she were
diffusing out deliciously into the harmony of things.  This at
length became the only state of consciousness she really
recognised: this exquisite sense of bleeding out into the higher
beauty and harmony of things.  Then she could actually hear the
great stars in heaven, which she saw through her door, speaking
from their motion and brightness, saying things perfectly to the
cosmos, as they trod in perfect ripples, like bells on the floor of
heaven, passing one another and grouping in the timeless dance,
with the spaces of dark between.  And she could hear the snow on a
cold, cloudy day twittering and faintly whistling in the sky, like
birds that flock and fly away in autumn, suddenly calling farewell
to the invisible moon, and slipping out of the plains of the air,
releasing peaceful warmth.  She herself would call to the arrested
snow to fall from the upper air.  She would call to the unseen moon
to cease to be angry, to make peace again with the unseen sun like
a woman who ceases to be angry in her house.  And she would smell
the sweetness of the moon relaxing to the sun in the wintry heaven,
when the snow fell in a faint, cold-perfumed relaxation, as the
peace of the sun mingled again in a sort of unison with the peace
of the moon.</p>

<p>She was aware too of the sort of shadow that was on the Indians of
the valley, a deep, stoical disconsolation, almost religious in its
depth.</p>

<p>&quot;We have lost our power over the sun, and we are trying to get him
back.  But he is wild with us, and shy like a horse that has got
away.  We have to go through a lot.&quot;  So the young Indian said to
her, looking into her eyes with a strained meaning.  And she, as if
bewitched, replied:</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you will get him back.&quot;</p>

<p>The smile of triumph flew over his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you hope it?&quot; he said.</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; she answered fatally.</p>

<p>&quot;Then all right,&quot; he said.  &quot;We shall get him.&quot;</p>

<p>And he went away in exultance.</p>

<p>She felt she was drifting on some consummation, which she had no
will to avoid, yet which seemed heavy and finally terrible to her.</p>

<p>It must have been almost December, for the days were short, when
she was taken again before the aged man, and stripped of her
clothing, and touched with the old finger-tips.</p>

<p>The aged cacique looked her in the eyes, with his eyes of lonely,
far-off, black intentness, and murmured something to her.</p>

<p>&quot;He wants you to make the sign of peace,&quot; the young man translated,
showing her the gesture.  &quot;Peace and farewell to him.&quot;</p>

<p>She was fascinated by the black, glass-like, intent eyes of the old
cacique, that watched her without blinking, like a basilisk's,
overpowering her.  In their depths also she saw a certain fatherly
compassion, and pleading.  She put her hand before her face, in the
required manner, making the sign of peace and farewell.  He made
the sign of peace back again to her, then sank among his furs.  She
thought he was going to die, and that he knew it.</p>

<p>There followed a day of ceremonial, when she was brought out before
all the people, in a blue blanket with white fringe, and holding
blue feathers in her hands.  Before an altar of one house, she was
perfumed with incense and sprinkled with ash.  Before the altar of
the opposite house she was fumigated again with incense by the
gorgeous, terrifying priests in yellow and scarlet and black, their
faces painted with scarlet paint.  And then they threw water on
her.  Meanwhile she was faintly aware of the fire on the altar, the
heavy, heavy sound of a drum, the heavy sound of men beginning
powerfully, deeply, savagely to sing, the swaying of the crowd of
faces in the plaza below, and the formation for a sacred dance.</p>

<p>But at this time her commonplace consciousness was numb, she was
aware of her immediate surroundings as shadows, almost immaterial.
With refined and heightened senses she could hear the sound of the
earth winging on its journey, like a shot arrow, the ripple-
rustling of the air, and the boom of the great arrow-string.  And
it seemed to her there were two great influences in the upper air,
one golden towards the sun, and one invisible silver; the first
travelling like rain ascending to the gold presence sunwards, the
second like rain silverily descending the ladders of space towards
the hovering, lurking clouds over the snowy mountain-top.  Then
between them, another presence, waiting to shake himself free of
moisture, of heavy white snow that had mysteriously collected about
him.  And in summer, like a scorched eagle, he would wait to shake
himself clear of the weight of heavy sunbeams.  And he was coloured
like fire.  And he was always shaking himself clear, of snow or of
heavy heat, like an eagle rustling.</p>

<p>Then there was a still stranger presence, standing watching from
the blue distance, always watching.  Sometimes running in upon the
wind, or shimmering in the heat-waves.  The blue wind itself,
rushing as it were out of the holes in the earth into the sky,
rushing out of the sky down upon the earth.  The blue wind, the go-
between, the invisible ghost that belonged to two worlds, that
played upon the ascending and the descending chords of the rains.</p>

<p>More and more her ordinary personal consciousness had left her, she
had gone into that other state of passional cosmic consciousness,
like one who is drugged.  The Indians, with their heavily religious
natures, had made her succumb to their vision.</p>

<p>Only one personal question she asked the young Indian:</p>

<p>&quot;Why am I the only one that wears blue?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is the colour of the wind.  It is the colour of what goes away
and is never coming back, but which is always here, waiting like
death among us.  It is the colour of the dead.  And it is the
colour that stands away off, looking at us from the distance, that
cannot come near to us.  When we go near, it goes farther.  It
can't be near.  We are all brown and yellow and black hair, and
white teeth and red blood.  We are the ones that are here.  You
with blue eyes, you are the messengers from the far-away, you
cannot stay, and now it is time for you to go back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where to?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;To the way-off things like the sun and the blue mother of rain,
and tell them that we are the people on the world again, and we can
bring the sun to the moon again, like a red horse to a blue mare;
we are the people.  The white women have driven back the moon in
the sky, won't let her come to the sun.  So the sun is angry.  And
the Indian must give the moon to the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How?&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;The white woman got to die and go like a wind to the sun, tell him
the Indians will open the gate to him.  And the Indian women will
open the gate to the moon.  The white women don't let the moon come
down out of the blue coral.  The moon used to come down among the
Indian women, like a white goat among the flowers.  And the sun
want to come down to the Indian men, like an eagle to the pine-
trees.  The sun, he is shut out behind the white man, and the moon
she is shut out behind the white woman, and they can't get away.
They are angry, everything in the world gets angrier.  The Indian
says, he will give the white woman to the sun, so the sun will leap
over the white man and come to the Indian again.  And the moon will
be surprised, she will see the gate open, and she not know which
way to go.  But the Indian woman will call to the moon, Come!
Come!  Come back into my grasslands.  The wicked white woman can't
harm you any more.  Then the sun will look over the heads of the
white men, and see the moon in the pastures of our women, with the
Red Men standing around like pine trees.  Then he will leap over
the heads of the white men, and come running past to the Indians
through the spruce trees.  And we, who are red and black and
yellow, we who stay, we shall have the sun on our right hand and
the moon on our left.  So we can bring the rain down out of the
blue meadows, and up out of the black; and we can call the wind
that tells the corn to grow, when we ask him, and we shall make the
clouds to break, and the sheep to have twin lambs.  And we shall be
full of power, like a spring day.  But the white people will be a
hard winter, without snow - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But,&quot; said the white woman, &quot;I don't shut out the moon - how can
I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;you shut the gate, and then laugh, think you have
it all your own way.&quot;</p>

<p>She could never quite understand the way he looked at her.  He was
always so curiously gentle, and his smile was so soft.  Yet there
was such glitter in his eyes, and an unrelenting sort of hate came
out of his words, a strange, profound, impersonal hate.  Personally
he liked her, she was sure.  He was gentle with her, attracted by
her in some strange, soft, passionless way.  But impersonally he
hated her with a mystic hatred.  He would smile at her, winningly.
Yet if, the next moment, she glanced round at him unawares, she
would catch that gleam of pure after-hate in his eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Have I got to die and be given to the sun?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometime,&quot; he said, laughing evasively.  &quot;Sometime we all die.&quot;</p>

<p>They were gentle with her, and very considerate with her.  Strange
men, the old priests and the young cacique alike, they watched over
her and cared for her like women.  In their soft, insidious
understanding, there was something womanly.  Yet their eyes, with
that strange glitter, and their dark, shut mouths that would open
to the broad jaw, the small, strong, white teeth, had something
very primitively male and cruel.</p>

<p>One wintry day, when snow was falling, they took her to a great
dark chamber in the big house.  The fire was burning in a corner on
a high raised dais under a sort of hood or canopy of adobe-work.
She saw in the fire-glow, the glowing bodies of the almost naked
priests, and strange symbols on the roof and walls of the chamber.
There was no door or window in the chamber, they had descended by a
ladder from the roof.  And the fire of pinewood danced continually,
showing walls painted with strange devices, which she could not
understand, and a ceiling of poles making a curious pattern of
black and red and yellow, and alcoves or niches in which were
curious objects she could not discern.</p>

<p>The older priests were going through some ceremony near the fire,
in silence, intense Indian silence.  She was seated on a low
projection of the wall, opposite the fire, two men seated beside
her.  Presently they gave her a drink from a cup, which she took
gladly, because of the semi-trance it would induce.</p>

<p>In the darkness and in the silence she was accurately aware of
everything that happened to her: how they took off her clothes,
and, standing her before a great, weird device on the wall,
coloured blue and white and black, washed her all over with water
and the amole infusion; washed even her hair, softly, carefully,
and dried it on white cloths, till it was soft and glistening.
Then they laid her on a couch under another great indecipherable
image of red and black and yellow, and now rubbed all her body with
sweet-scented oil, and massaged all her limbs, and her back, and
her sides, with a long, strange, hypnotic massage.  Their dark
hands were incredibly powerful, yet soft with a watery softness she
could not understand.  And the dark faces, leaning near her white
body, she saw were darkened with red pigment, with lines of yellow
round the cheeks.  And the dark eyes glittered absorbed, as the
hands worked upon the soft white body of the woman.</p>

<p>They were so impersonal, absorbed in something that was beyond her.
They never saw her as a personal woman: she could tell that.  She
was some mystic object to them, some vehicle of passions too remote
for her to grasp.  Herself in a state of trance, she watched their
faces bending over her, dark, strangely glistening with the
transparent red paint, and lined with bars of yellow.  And in this
weird, luminous-dark mask of living face, the eyes were fixed with
an unchanging steadfast gleam, and the purplish-pigmented lips were
closed in a full, sinister, sad grimness.  The immense fundamental
sadness, the grimness of ultimate decision, the fixity of revenge,
and the nascent exultance of those that are going to triumph - these
things she could read in their faces, as she lay and was rubbed
into a misty glow, by their uncanny dark hands.  Her limbs, her
flesh, her very bones at last seemed to be diffusing into a roseate
sort of mist, in which her consciousness hovered like some sun-
gleam in a flushed cloud.</p>

<p>She knew the gleam would fade, the cloud would go grey.  But at
present she did not believe it.  She knew she was a victim; that
all this elaborate work upon her was the work of victimising her.
But she did not mind.  She wanted it.</p>

<p>Later, they put a short blue tunic on her and took her to the upper
terrace, and presented her to the people.  She saw the plaza below
her full of dark faces and of glittering eyes.  There was no pity:
only the curious hard exultance.  The people gave a subdued cry
when they saw her, and she shuddered.  But she hardly cared.</p>

<p>Next day was the last.  She slept in a chamber of the big house.
At dawn they put on her a big blue blanket with a fringe, and led
her out into the plaza, among the throng of silent, dark-blanketed
people.  There was pure white snow on the ground, and the dark
people in their dark-brown blankets looked like inhabitants of
another world.</p>

<p>A large drum was slowly pounding, and an old priest was declaring
from a housetop.  But it was not till noon that a litter came
forth, and the people gave that low, animal cry which was so
moving.  In the sack-like litter sat the old, old cacique, his
white hair braided with black braid and large turquoise stones.
His face was like a piece of obsidian.  He lifted his hand in
token, and the litter stopped in front of her.  Fixing her with his
old eyes, he spoke to her for a few moments, in his hollow voice.
No one translated.</p>

<p>Another litter came, and she was placed in it.  Four priests moved
ahead, in their scarlet and yellow and black, with plumed
headdresses.  Then came the litter of the old cacique.  Then the
light drums began, and two groups of singers burst simultaneously
into song, male and wild.  And the golden-red, almost naked men,
adorned with ceremonial feathers and kilts, the rivers of black
hair down their backs, formed into two files and began to tread the
dance.  So they threaded out of the snowy plaza, in two long,
sumptuous lines of dark red-gold and black and fur, swaying with a
faint tinkle of bits of shell and flint, winding over the snow
between the two bee-clusters of men who sang around the drum.</p>

<p>Slowly they moved out, and her litter, with its attendance of
feathered, lurid, dancing priests, moved after.  Everybody danced
the tread of the dance-step, even, subtly, the litter-bearers.  And
out of the plaza they went, past smoking ovens, on the trail to the
great cotton-wood trees, that stood like grey-silver lace against
the blue sky, bare and exquisite above the snow.  The river,
diminished, rushed among fangs of ice.  The chequer-squares of
gardens within fences were all snowy, and the white houses now
looked yellowish.</p>

<p>The whole valley glittered intolerably with pure snow, away to the
walls of the standing rock.  And across the flat cradle of snow-bed
wound the long thread of the dance, shaking slowly and sumptuously
in its orange and black motion.  The high drums thudded quickly,
and on the crystalline frozen air the swell and roar of the chant
of savages was like an obsession.</p>

<p>She sat looking out of her litter with big, transfixed blue eyes,
under which were the wan markings of her drugged weariness.  She
knew she was going to die, among the glisten of this snow, at the
hands of this savage, sumptuous people.  And as she stared at the
blaze of blue sky above the slashed and ponderous mountain, she
thought:  &quot;I am dead already.  What difference does it make, the
transition from the dead I am to the dead I shall be, very soon!&quot;
Yet her soul sickened and felt wan.</p>

<p>The strange procession trailed on, in perpetual dance, slowly
across the plain of snow, and then entered the slopes between the
pine-trees.  She saw the copper-dark men dancing the dance-tread,
onwards, between the copper-pale tree trunks.  And at last she,
too, in her swaying litter, entered the pine-trees.</p>

<p>They were travelling on and on, upwards, across the snow under the
trees, past the superb shafts of pale, flaked copper, the rustle
and shake and tread of the threading dance, penetrating into the
forest, into the mountain.  They were following a stream-bed: but
the stream was dry, like summer, dried up by the frozenness of the
head-waters.  There were dark, red-bronze willow bushes with
wattles like wild hair, and pallid aspen trees looking like cold
flesh against the snow.  Then jutting dark rocks.</p>

<p>At last she could tell that the dancers were moving forward no
more.  Nearer and nearer she came upon the drums, as to a lair of
mysterious animals.  Then through the bushes she emerged into a
strange amphitheatre.  Facing was a great wall of hollow rock, down
the front of which hung a great, dripping, fang-like spoke of ice.
The ice came pouring over the rock from the precipice above, and
then stood arrested, dripping out of high heaven, almost down to
the hollow stones where the stream-pool should be below.  But the
pool was dry.</p>

<p>On either side the dry pool, the lines of dancers had formed, and
the dance was continuing without intermission, against a background
of bushes.</p>

<p>But what she felt was that fanged inverted pinnacle of ice, hanging
from the lip of the dark precipice above.  And behind the great
rope of ice, she saw the leopard-like figures of priests climbing
the hollow cliff face, to the cave that, like a dark socket, bored
a cavity, an orifice, half way up the crag.</p>

<p>Before she could realise, her litter-bearers were staggering in the
footholds, climbing the rock.  She, too, was behind the ice.  There
it hung, like a curtain that is not spread, but hangs like a great
fang.  And near above her was the orifice of the cave sinking dark
into the rock.  She watched it as she swayed upwards.</p>

<p>On the platform of the cave stood the priests, waiting in all their
gorgeousness of feathers and fringed robes, watching her ascent.
Two of them stooped to help her litter-bearer.  And at length she
was on the platform of the cave, far in behind the shaft of ice,
above the hollow amphitheatre among the bushes below, where men
were dancing, and the whole populace of the village was clustered
in silence.</p>

<p>The sun was sloping down the afternoon sky, on the left.  She knew
that this was the shortest day of the year, and the last day of her
life.  They stood her facing the iridescent column of ice, which
fell down marvellously arrested, away in front of her.</p>

<p>Some signal was given, and the dance below stopped.  There was now
absolute silence.  She was given a little to drink, then two
priests took off her mantle and her tunic, and in her strange
pallor she stood there, between the lurid robes of the priests,
beyond the pillar of ice, beyond and above the dark-faced people.
The throng below gave the low, wild cry.  Then the priests turned
her round, so she stood with her back to the open world, her long
blond hair to the people below.  And they cried again.</p>

<p>She was facing the cave, inwards.  A fire was burning and
flickering in the depths.  Four priests had taken off their robes,
and were almost as naked as she was.  They were powerful men in the
prime of life, and they kept their dark, painted faces lowered.</p>

<p>From the fire came the old, old priest, with an incense-pan.  He
was naked and in a state of barbaric ecstasy.  He fumigated his
victim, reciting at the same time in a hollow voice.  Behind him
came another robeless priest, with two flint knives.</p>

<p>When she was fumigated, they laid her on a large flat stone, the
four powerful men holding her by the outstretched arms and legs.
Behind stood the aged man, like a skeleton covered with dark glass,
holding a knife and transfixedly watching the sun; and behind him
again was another naked priest, with a knife.</p>

<p>She felt little sensation, though she knew all that was happening.
Turning to the sky, she looked at the yellow sun.  It was sinking.
The shaft of ice was like a shadow between her and it.  And she
realised that the yellow rays were filling half the cave, though
they had not reached the altar where the fire was, at the far end
of the funnel-shaped cavity.</p>

<p>Yes, the rays were creeping round slowly.  As they grew ruddier,
they penetrated farther.  When the red sun was about to sink, he
would shine full through the shaft of ice deep into the hollow of
the cave, to the innermost.</p>

<p>She understood now that this was what the men were waiting for.
Even those that held her down were bent and twisted round, their
black eyes watching the sun with a glittering eagerness, and awe,
and craving.  The black eyes of the aged cacique were fixed like
black mirrors on the sun, as if sightless, yet containing some
terrible answer to the reddening winter planet.  And all the eyes
of the priests were fixed and glittering on the sinking orb, in the
reddening, icy silence of the winter afternoon.</p>

<p>They were anxious, terribly anxious, and fierce.  Their ferocity
wanted something, and they were waiting the moment.  And their
ferocity was ready to leap out into a mystic exultance, of triumph.
But still they were anxious.</p>

<p>Only the eyes of that oldest man were not anxious.  Black, and
fixed, and as if sightless, they watched the sun, seeing beyond the
sun.  And in their black, empty concentration there was power,
power intensely abstract and remote, but deep, deep to the heart of
the earth, and the heart of the sun.  In absolute motionlessness he
watched till the red sun should send his ray through the column of
ice.  Then the old man would strike, and strike home, accomplish
the sacrifice and achieve the power.</p>

<p>The mastery that man must hold, and that passes from race to race.</p>
