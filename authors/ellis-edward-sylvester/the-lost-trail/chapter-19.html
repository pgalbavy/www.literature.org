<p>Deerfoot identified the object before reaching it.  His friends
followed him doubtingly, and while a rod to the rear, saw him
gather it up and hold it aloft.</p>

<p>"It is your blanket," said Jack Carleton to his companion.</p>

<p>"Dot ish what it be."</p>

<p>It was easy to understand why the piece of coarse cloth lay on
the ground.  Instead of rolling it up with the smaller one belonging
to Jack Carleton, Otto had made a separate bundle and strapped
it behind the other effects on the back of the horse.  The latter
in moving among the trees had displaced it.</p>

<p>It was saturated with water, which dripped from the folds when
raised from the ground.  Jack and Otto twisted it between them
until all the moisture it was possible to wring out left it in
a dozen tiny rills.  "Deerfoot," said the German, wheeling about,
"dot ish de blanket vot&mdash;vot I don't&mdash;vot I put on your shoulders
ven it rained."</p>

<p>The Shawanoe bowed his head, smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot knows his brother speaks truth."</p>

<p>"I gives him to you&mdash;be ish yours."</p>

<p>The Indian made no move to take it, and Jack added:</p>

<p>"We shall soon find the colt and with him my blanket and the
other articles he has with him.  We do not need this; you have
none, and you have many miles to traverse before you reach your
home; we shall be glad if you will take it from us."</p>

<p>Deerfoot partly raised his hand to accept the gift, but stepped
back with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"When my brother goes to the cabin of his father, and, he asks
him for the blanket, what will he say?"</p>

<p>"I vill tells him dot I gives him mit you."</p>

<p>"Then the father of my brother will strike him."</p>

<p>"I dinks dot ish so," said Otto with a grin and shrug of his
shoulders, "but I be glad to take a flogging for him dot does
so much for me&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>The youth compressed his thin lips and made a single shake of
his head, so positive in its character that nothing more was needed.</p>

<p>"But," added Jack Carleton, convinced from the hesitancy shown
at first by Deerfoot, that he really wished the blanket, "if you
are so desirous of saving Otto from a flogging, it can be easily
done.  When we take back the colt and Mr. Relstaub asks for the
blanket, we can tell him that an Indian took it before we found
the horse.  That will be the truth."</p>

<p>Deerfoot looked straight in the face of the young Kentuckian,
and his lips parted as if on the point of speaking, but he refrained,
and with his shadowy smile, again shook his head.  The gesture
said as plainly as the words could have done:</p>

<p>"What you propose is as much a falsehood as anything can be."</p>

<p>"But I will give Otto my blanket," persisted Jack Carleton, determined
to overcome the scruples of the remarkable Indian, "that will
make things right."</p>

<p>"Where is my brother's blanket?" asked Deerfoot with a grave
countenance.</p>

<p>"I shall soon find it: the horse can't be far off."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will wait till my brother finds it."</p>

<p>"Well! well", said Jack, with a wondering sigh, "you are the
strangest person I ever saw.  It isn't worth while to argue any
question with you.  So we'll let it pass."</p>

<p>Such seemed to be the wish of Deerfoot, for, with his silent
step, he moved along the elevated ground, until he arrived at
a spot where the trees were so few and stunted that an extended
view was obtained. There the three halted side by side, and spent
several minutes gazing over the surrounding country.</p>

<p>Looking toward Kentucky, the majestic Mississippi was in plain
sight as it swept southward, while beyond stretched the undulating
forest, until it met the dim horizon in the distance.  Far to
the southward was seen the smoke of a campfire.  It was unusually
murky, and, as it ascended in a wavy line through the clear atmosphere,
it looked as if the soiled finger of some great ogre had been
drawn against the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>But it was a sight which every one of the party had seen before,
and it excited little interest.  It was no concern of theirs what
took place in Kentucky, and Jack and Otto turned to survey the
"promised land," which opened out to the westward.</p>

<p>Woods, patches of natural clearing, hills and misty mountains
many miles away: these were the general features of the immense
area which expanded before their sight.  Ordinarily there was
nothing among these of special account, but the eye of Deerfoot,
which never seemed to lose anything, detected almost instantly
a "sign" that signified a great deal to him and his companions.</p>

<p>In a depression, no more than a furlong distant, could be observed
the faintest possible tinge of smoke, slowly ascending from a
mass of dense forest.  It was so faint, in fact, that neither
Jack nor Otto noticed it, until Deerfoot pointed his finger in
that direction, and said "The camp of red men!"</p>

<p>The vapor was of a light blue, just above the tree-top's, and
it rose only a few feet more, when it dissolved in the clear atmosphere.
But it showed that a camp-fire was burning beneath, though it
may have been kindled many hours before, and those who started
it possibly were miles away in the depths of the forest.</p>

<p>"Suppose they are Shawanoes or Miamis?" remarked Jack.</p>

<p>"They are not Shawanoes," said Deerfoot quietly.</p>

<p>"Miamis then?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thinks they are not Miamis, but he cannot be sure till
he sees the camp."</p>

<p>And without further remark, he went down the slope with a rapid
step, which, it is hardly necessary to say, gave out no noise
at all.  Jack concluded he could not feel much misgiving or he
would not have allowed him and Otto to follow so close on his
heels.  But they were some distance off, when he turned about
and motioned them to halt.</p>

<p>"Let my brothers wait for Deerfoot," he said softly.</p>

<p>Knowing he would be obeyed without question, Deerfoot continued
his advance, speedily disappearing from sight among the trees
and undergrowth, while the others did as he requested.</p>

<p>The discovery of the camp-fire not only caused some misgivings
about the personal safety of the little company, but it suggested
that the missing horse was lost beyond recovery.  Horse-flesh
is the most "sensitive capital" on the frontier, and he who pilfers
it runs more danger of lynching than does the man who takes the
life of a fellow being.  To the Indian, the noble animal is as
indispensable as to the settler, and, if the party who had made
the halt in that neighborhood learned that an unusually fine steed
was wandering near them, they would lose no time in making him
captive.</p>

<p>But from the moment our young friends left their elevated position,
they followed a different route from that of the colt.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!" whispered the disturbed German lad: "I dinks
dot if they don't got de golt then the golt don't got dem, and
fader he won't be as bleased as nefer vos."</p>

<p>"There isn't any hurry, Otto, in putting your words together,
and it is a good time for you to try to string them so they will
make a little sense."</p>

<p>"Yaw; I vill tries."</p>

<p>"Sh!  There comes some one!"</p>

<p>It was Deerfoot, who appeared a moment later, and beckoned his
friends to join him.  His manner, while not careless, was so manifestly
free from solicitude, that Jack knew there was no ground for alarm. 
He and Otto overtook the Shawanoe at the moment he stepped into
the open space where a camp-fire had been burning some time before.</p>

<p>In fact it was still burning, else the smoke would not have caught
the eye of the Indian youth; but it must have been smoldering
for hours, judging from the thinness of the vapor, and the fact
that little more than a pile of ashes and decaying embers met
the sight.</p>

<p>There is naught to be said in the way of description.  The fire,
when kindled, had been a large one, and all the burning sticks
were in one pile instead of two or three, as is often the case. 
The charred ends protruded irregularly from the white, feathery
ashes, and one solitary brand, smothered almost from sight, sent
up the faint bluish vapor which, creeping through the foliage
overhead, told the vigilant Shawanoe where to look for the camp
of his enemies.</p>

<p>"How long have they been gone?" asked Jack, gazing carefully
around and assuring himself that no strangers were near.</p>

<p>"They went away when the sun first came up from the woods; many
hours have passed since they left."</p>

<p>"Which course did they take?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot pointed toward the south.</p>

<p>"Were you right in saying they were not Shawanoes?"</p>

<p>"They did not belong to my tribe."</p>

<p>"Ah, then they were Miamis.  I made up my mind to that."</p>

<p>"My brother is wrong," replied Deerfoot, with a flitting smile;
"they were Osage Indians."</p>

<p>"How don't you know dot?"</p>

<p>"My other brother is wrong: Deerfoot said not he did not know
it; he does know they were Osages."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton poked Otto in the side.</p>

<p>"Even Deerfoot corrects your language."</p>

<p>"All rights," said Otto, bristling up; "I'ven I don't haf a mind
to, I talks mebbe better nor you does; but ven I does, den I don't;
so I shets up my mouth up, mebbe&mdash;don't it?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot stepped to a fallen tree, which no doubt had served
as a seat for most of the party, and picked up a strip of blanket,
hardly a foot long and no more than an inch wide.  It was not
only cunningly woven, but showed brilliant blue and yellow colors
on a background of black.</p>

<p>"This was the blanket of an Osage warrior," said the Shawanoe,
flinging it to Otto, who turned it over several times in silence,
Jack looking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"I suppose he caught sight of that before we came up and learned
the truth; don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"I don't dink nodings more," replied Otto, still pouting from
the offence given a few minutes previous.</p>

<p>Bending over, Deerfoot carefully drew some leaves aside and revealed
the upper bone of a deer's foreleg, to which a good quantity of
partially broiled venison was clinging.  Judging from this discovery
and the number of bones scattered about, the Osages had more food
than they needed.</p>

<p>"We&mdash;that is, you and I, Deerfoot&mdash;are hungry.  Is the meat in
shape for us to eat?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had satisfied himself by examination that it was
ready for the palate, and he so expressed himself.</p>

<p>"That is good; there is just enough to make as a good dinner. 
Otto doesn't look as though he cared about any, and he can wait
till tomorrow."</p>

<p>This statement of the situation quickly loosened the tongue of
the sturdy German, whose hunger had reached a ravenous point.</p>

<p>"I speaks mit myself luf ven I vishes," he hastened to say; "I
vos as hungry as nefer could be, and what for you dinks I ain't,
eh?"</p>

<p>Jack laughed, and, sitting on the same tree which had served
the red men, all three used their keen hunting-knives upon the
rarely-cooked meat.  They could have enjoyed much more had it
been at their disposal; but as it was, they made a substantial
meal, receiving enough nourishment to last them till the morrow.</p>

<p>"How many warriors were here?" asked Jack of their leader.</p>

<p>"Seven," was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"What brought them to this place?"</p>

<p>"They were hunting; an Osage village is not many miles off yonder,"
said Deerfoot, pointing to the southwest; "and they have gone
there. They spent the night here."</p>

<p>"Did they get my horse?" asked Otto, whose face was aglow with
good nature and grease.</p>

<p>"My brother shall soon know."</p>
