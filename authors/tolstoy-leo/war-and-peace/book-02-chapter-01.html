<p>BOOK TWO: 1805</p>

<p></p>

<p>In October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and
towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly
arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and
burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the
headquarters of the commander-in-chief, Kutuzov.</p>

<p>On October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just
reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be
inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance
of the locality and surroundings- fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled
roofs, and hills in the distance- and despite the fact that the
inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not
Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment
preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.</p>

<p>On the evening of the last day's march an order had been received
that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march.
Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental
commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in
marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the
battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the
principle that it is always better to &quot;bow too low than not bow low
enough.&quot; So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending
and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the
adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by
morning the regiment- instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it
had been on its last march the day before- presented a well-ordered
array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty,
had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness.
And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the
commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on
every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of
articles, &quot;awl, soap, and all,&quot; as the soldiers say. There was only
one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was
the state of the soldiers' boots. More than half the men's boots
were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the
regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched
some seven hundred miles.</p>

<p>The commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and
thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider
from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new
uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold
epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive
shoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the
most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line
and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was
plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and
that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to
indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair
sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Michael Mitrich, sir?&quot; he said, addressing one of the
battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain
that they both felt happy). &quot;We had our hands full last night.
However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsaritsin Meadow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot; asked the commander.</p>

<p>At that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had
been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an
aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.</p>

<p>The aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief
wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on
the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation
whatever.</p>

<p>A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutuzov the
day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army
of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kutuzov, not considering
this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of
his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the
troops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the
regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the
commander in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know
these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that
the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and
that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On
hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged
his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.</p>

<p>&quot;A fine mess we've made of it!&quot; he remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;There now! Didn't I tell you, Michael Mitrich, that if it was
said 'on the march' it meant in greatcoats?&quot; said he reproachfully
to the battalion commander. &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; he added, stepping
resolutely forward. &quot;Company commanders!&quot; he shouted in a voice
accustomed to command. &quot;Sergeants major!... How soon will he be here?&quot;
he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently
relating to the personage he was referring to.</p>

<p>&quot;In an hour's time, I should say.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we have time to change clothes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know, General....&quot;</p>

<p>The regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered
the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders
ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the
greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares
that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and
stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and
fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and
pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and
drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.</p>

<p>In half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had
become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his
jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a
distance.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever is this? This!&quot; he shouted and stood still. &quot;Commander
of the third company!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Commander of the third company wanted by the general!...
commander to the general... third company to the commander.&quot; The words
passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing
officer.</p>

<p>When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination
in a cry of: &quot;The general to the third company,&quot; the missing officer
appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged
man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on
his toes toward the general. The captain's face showed the
uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not
learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was
evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The
general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting,
slackening his pace as he approached.</p>

<p>&quot;You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?&quot;
shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and
pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat
of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. &quot;What have you been
after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place?
Eh? I'll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade....
Eh...?&quot;</p>

<p>The commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior,
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this
pressure lay his only hope of salvation.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, why don't you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as
a Hungarian?&quot; said the commander with an austere gibe.</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your
excellency?... nobody knows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency, it's the officer Dolokhov, who has been reduced to
the ranks,&quot; said the captain softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier?
If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the
others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Gave him leave? Leave? That's just like you young men,&quot; said the
regimental commander cooling down a little. &quot;Leave indeed.... One says
a word to you and you... What?&quot; he added with renewed irritation, &quot;I
beg you to dress your men decently.&quot;</p>

<p>And the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his
jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display
of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further
excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished
badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the
third company.</p>

<p>&quot;H-o-o-w are you standing? Where's your leg? Your leg?&quot; shouted
the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there
were still five men between him and Dolokhov with his bluish-gray
uniform.</p>

<p>Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with
his clear, insolent eyes in the general's face.</p>

<p>&quot;Why a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his
coat... the ras...&quot; he did not finish.</p>

<p>&quot;General, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...&quot;
Dolokhov hurriedly interrupted.</p>

<p>&quot;No talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not bound to endure insults,&quot; Dolokhov concluded in loud, ringing
tones.</p>

<p>The eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became
silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.</p>

<p>&quot;I request you to have the goodness to change your coat,&quot; he said as
he turned away.</p>
