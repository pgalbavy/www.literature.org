<p>It was Press Day. The critics had begun to arrive; Mr. Albemarle
circulated among them with a ducal amiability. The young assistant
hovered vaguely about, straining to hear what the great men had
to say and trying to pretend that he wasn’t eavesdropping. Lypiatt’s
pictures hung on the walls, and Lypiatt’s catalogue, thick with
its preface and its explanatory notes, was in all hands.</p>

<p>"Very strong," Mr. Albemarle kept repeating, "very strong indeed!"
It was his password for the day.</p>

<p>Little Mr. Clew, who represented the <em>Daily Post</em>, was
inclined to be enthusiastic. "How well he writes!" he said to
Mr. Albemarle, looking up from the catalogue. "And how well he
paints! What <em>impasto</em>."</p>

<p><em>Impasto, impasto</em>—the young assistant sidled off unobtrusively
to the desk and made a note of it. He would look the word up in
Grubb’s <em>Dictionary of Art and Artists</em> later on. He made
his way back, circuitously and as though by accident, into Mr.
Clew’s neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Mr. Clew was one of those rare people who have a real passion
for art. He loved painting, all painting, indiscriminately. In
a picture gallery he was like a Turk in a harem; he adored them
all. He loved Memling as much as Raphael, he loved Grünewald and
Michelangelo, Holman Hunt and Manet, Romney and Tintoretto; how
happy he could be with all of them! Sometimes, it is true, he
hated; but that was only when familiarity had not yet bred love.
At the first Post-Impressionist Exhibition, for example, in 1911,
he had taken a very firm stand. "This is an obscene farce," he
had written then. Now, however, there was no more passionate admirer
of Matisse’s genius. As a connoisseur and <em>kunstforscher</em>,
Mr. Clew was much esteemed. People would bring him dirty old pictures
to look at, and he would exclaim at once: Why, it’s an El Greco,
a Piazetta, or some other suitable name. Asked how he knew, he
would shrug his shoulders and say: But it’s signed all over. His
certainty and his enthusiasm were infectious. Since the coming
of El Greco into fashion, he had discovered dozens of early works
by that great artist. For Lord Petersfield’s collection alone
he had found four early El Grecos, all by pupils of Bassano. Lord
Petersfield’s confidence in Mr. Clew was unbounded; not even that
affair of the Primitives had shaken it. It was a sad affair: Lord
Petersfield’s Duccio had shown signs of cracking; the estate carpenter
was sent for to take a look at the panel; he had looked. "A worse-seasoned
piece of Illinois hickory," he said, "I’ve never seen." After
that he looked at the Simone Martini; for that, on the contrary,
he was full of praise. Smooth-grained, well-seasoned—it wouldn’t
crack, no, not in a hundred years. "A nicer slice of board never
came out of America." He had a hyperbolical way of speaking. Lord
Petersfield was extremely angry; he dismissed the estate carpenter
on the spot. After that he told Mr. Clew that he wanted a Giorgione,
and Mr. Clew went out and found him one which was signed all over.</p>

<p>"I like this very much," said Mr. Clew, pointing to one of the
thoughts with which Lypiatt had prefaced his catalogue. "‘Genius,’"
he adjusted his spectacles and began to read aloud, "‘is life.
Genius is a force of nature. In art, nothing else counts. The
modern impotents, who are afraid of genius and who are envious
of it, have invented in self-defence the notion of the Artist.
The Artist with his sense of form, his style, his devotion to
pure beauty, et cetera, et cetera. But Genius includes the Artist;
every Genius has, among very many others, the qualities attributed
by the impotents to the Artist. The Artist without genius is a
carver of fountains through which no water flows.’ Very true,"
said Mr. Clew, "very true indeed." He marked the passage with
his pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. Albemarle produced the password. "Very strongly put," he
said.</p>

<p>"I have always felt that myself," said Mr. Clew. "El Greco, for
example...."</p>

<p>"Good morning, what about El Greco?" said a voice, all in one
breath. The thin, long, skin-covered skeleton of Mr. Mallard hung
over them like a guilty conscience. Mr. Mallard wrote every week
in the <em>Hebdomadal Digest</em>. He had an immense knowledge
of art, and a sincere dislike of all that was beautiful. The only
modern painter whom he really admired was Hodler. All others were
treated by him with a merciless savagery; he tore them to pieces
in his weekly articles with all the holy gusto of a Calvinist
iconoclast smashing images of the Virgin.</p>

<p>"What about El Greco?" he repeated. He had a peculiarly passionate
loathing of El Greco.</p>

<p>Mr. Clew smiled up at him propitiatingly; he was afraid of Mr.
Mallard. His enthusiasms were no match for Mr. Mallard’s erudite
and logical disgusts. "I was merely quoting him as an example,"
he said.</p>

<p>"An example, I hope, of incompetent drawing, baroque composition,
disgusting forms, garish colouring and hysterical subject-matter."
Mr. Mallard showed his old ivory teeth in a menacing smile. "Those
are the only things which El Greco’s work exemplifies."</p>

<p>Mr. Clew gave a nervous little laugh. "What do you think of these?"
he asked, pointing to Lypiatt’s canvases.</p>

<p>"They look to me very ordinarily bad," answered Mr. Mallard.</p>

<p>The young assistant listened appalled. In a business like this,
how was it possible to make good?</p>

<p>"All the same," said Mr. Clew courageously, "I like that bowl
of roses in the window with the landscape behind. Number twenty-nine."
He looked in the catalogue. "And there’s a really charming little
verse about it:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
‘O beauty of the rose,<br/>
Goodness as well as perfume exhaling!<br/>
Who gazes on these flowers,<br/>
On this blue hill and ripening field—he knows<br/>
Where duty leads and that the nameless Powers<br/>
In a rose can speak their will.’

</p>
</div>
<p>Really charming!" Mr. Clew made another mark with his pencil.</p>

<p>"But commonplace, commonplace." Mr. Mallard shook his head. "And
in any case a verse can’t justify a bad picture. What an unsubtle
harmony of colour! And how uninteresting the composition is! That
receding diagonal—it’s been worked to death." He too made a mark
in his catalogue—a cross and a little circle, arranged like the
skull and cross-bones on a pirate’s flag. Mr. Mallard’s catalogues
were always covered with these little marks: they were his symbols
of condemnation.</p>

<p>Mr. Albemarle, meanwhile, had moved away to greet the new arrivals.
To the critic of the <em>Daily Cinema</em> he had to explain that
there were no portraits of celebrities. The reporter from the
<em>Evening Planet</em> had to be told which were the best pictures.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lypiatt," he dictated, "is a poet and philosopher as well
as a painter. His catalogue is a—h’m—declaration of faith."</p>

<p>The reporter took it down in shorthand. "And very nice too,"
he said. "I’m most grateful to you, sir, most grateful." And he
hurried away, to get to the Cattle Show before the King should
arrive. Mr. Albemarle affably addressed himself to the critic
of the <em>Morning Globe</em>.</p>

<p>"I <em>al_ways regard this gallery," said a loud and cheerful
voice, full of bulls and canaries in chorus, "as positively a
_mauvais lieu</em>. Such exhibitions!" And Mr. Mercaptan shrugged
his shoulders expressively. He halted to wait for his companion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash had lagged behind, reading the catalogue as she
slowly walked along. "It’s a complete book," she said, "full of
poems and essays and short stories even, so far as I can see."</p>

<p>"Oh, the usual cracker mottoes." Mr. Mercaptan laughed. "I know
the sort of thing. ‘Look after the past and the future will look
after itself.’ ‘God squared minus Man squared equals Art-plus-life
times Art-minus-Life.’ ‘The Higher the Art the fewer the morals’—only
that’s too nearly good sense to have been invented by Lypiatt.
But I know the sort of thing. I could go on like that for ever."
Mr. Mercaptan was delighted with himself.</p>

<p>"I’ll read you one of them," said Mrs. Viveash. "‘A picture is
a chemical combination of plastic form and spiritual significance.’"</p>

<p>"Crikey!" said Mr. Mercaptan.</p>

<p>"‘Those who think that a picture is a matter of nothing but plastic
form are like those who imagine that water is made of nothing
but hydrogen.’"</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan made a grimace. "What writing!" he exclaimed; "<em>le
style c’est l’homme</em>. Lypiatt hasn’t got a style. Argal—inexorable
conclusion—Lypiatt doesn’t exist. My word, though. Look at those
horrible great nudes there. Like Carracis with cubical muscles."</p>

<p>"Sampson and Delilah," said Mrs. Viveash. "Would you like me
to read about them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not."</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash did not press the matter. Casimir, she thought,
must have been thinking of her when he wrote this little poem
about Poets and Women, crossed genius, torments, the sweating
of masterpieces. She sighed. "Those leopards are rather nice,"
she said, and looked at the catalogue again. "‘An animal is a
symbol and its form is significant. In the long process of adaptation,
evolution has refined and simplified and shaped, till every part
of the animal expresses one desire, a single idea. Man, who has
become what he is, not by specialization, but by generalization,
symbolizes with his body no one thing. He is a symbol of everything
from the most hideous and ferocious bestiality to godhead.’"</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mr. Mercaptan.</p>

<p>A canvas of mountains and enormous clouds like nascent sculptures
presented itself.</p>

<p>"‘Aerial Alps’" Mrs. Viveash began to read.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"‘Aerial Alps of amber and of snow,<br/>
Junonian flesh, and bosomy alabaster<br/>
Carved by the wind’s uncertain hands....’"

</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Mercaptan stopped his ears. "Please, please," he begged.</p>

<p>"Number seventeen," said Mrs. Viveash, "is called ‘Woman on a
Cosmic background,’" A female figure stood leaning against a pillar
on a hilltop, and beyond was a blue night with stars. "Underneath
is written: ‘For one at least, she is more than the starry universe.’"
Mrs. Viveash remembered that Lypiatt had once said very much that
sort of thing to her. "So many of Casimir’s things remind me,"
she said, "of those Italian vermouth advertisements. You know—Cinzano,
Bonomelli and all these. I wish they didn’t. This woman in white
with her head in the Great Bear...." She shook her head. "Poor
Casimir."</p>

<p>Mr. Mercaptan roared and squealed with laughter. "Bonomelli,"
he said; "that’s precisely it. What a critic, Myra! I take off
my hat." They moved on. "And what’s this grand transformation
scene?" he asked.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash looked at the catalogue. "It’s called ‘The Sermon
on the Mount,’" she said. "And really, do you know, I rather like
it. All that crowd of figures slanting up the hill and the single
figure on the top—it seems to me very dramatic."</p>

<p>"My <em>dear</em>," protested Mr. Mercaptan.</p>

<p>"And in spite of everything," said Mrs. Viveash, feeling suddenly
and uncomfortably that she had somehow been betraying the man,
"he’s really very nice, you know. Very nice, indeed." Her expiring
voice sounded very decidedly.</p>

<p>"Ah, <em>ces femmes</em>," exclaimed Mr. Mercaptan, "<em>ces
femmes</em>! They’re all Pasiphaes and Ledas. They all in their
hearts prefer beasts to men, savages to civilized beings. <em>Even</em>
you, Myra, I <em>really</em> believe." He shook his head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Viveash ignored the outburst. "Very nice," she repeated
thoughtfully. "Only rather a bore...." Her voice expired altogether.</p>

<p>They continued their round of the gallery. </p>
