<p>WHEN the members of the Pleasant Valley Singing Society gathered just
before sunset in the maple grove, near the sugar-house (where Cuffy Bear
first saw a man), they were glad to find that Jasper Jay was already
there, waiting for them.
</p>
<p>Now, a smallish, cinnamon-colored young gentleman named Valentine Veery,
who was a distant cousin of Jolly Robin's, was the singing leader. He
had been chosen on account of his being able to sing both alto and
soprano at the same time. And as soon as everybody had found a
comfortable seat for himself, Valentine Veery said:
</p><p>"I'm glad to see we have a new member with us this evening; and I hope
he will enjoy himself and sing his very best."
</p><p>Everybody looked at Jasper Jay. And you might think he would have felt
the least bit uncomfortable. But he only laughed loudly and replied that
if he didn't have a good time it wouldn't be <u>his</u> fault.
</p><p>Then Valentine Veery bowed politely--which was more than Jasper Jay had
done--and announced that "Good-night, Ladies!" would be the first song.
</p><p>So all the company began to sing, including Jasper Jay. Although he knew
neither the words nor the music, he shrieked at the top of his voice.
But they hadn't sung more than a few lines before the leader made them
stop.
</p><p>"There's something wrong somewhere," said Valentine Veery. "Has anybody
a cold in his head?"
</p><p>But everyone, including Jasper Jay, declared that he never was in better
health in his life.
</p><p>"We'll try again, then," the leader told them.
</p><p>So they started once more. And once more Valentine Veery stopped them.
</p><p>"This is terrible!" he said with a shudder. "Who is it, please, that is
off the key?"
</p><p>Nobody answered. But everybody looked at Jasper Jay again. And you would
think that this time he certainly would have felt most uncomfortable.
But he only grinned as if he were enjoying himself hugely.
</p><p>"We'll try the song just once more," little Mr. Veery told them. But it
was no use. He stopped the singing quickly. "We can't go on like this,"
he declared. "The only thing to be done is to let each member sing the
song alone. And in that way we shall find out who's out of tune. We'll
let our oldest member sing first, and the newest one last," he directed.
</p><p>So old Mr. Mockingbird, who was the first member of the Pleasant Valley
Singing Society--and about the only one of his family in the
neighborhood--sang the song in his best manner. And after him the others
had their turn, until everybody had sung "Good-night, Ladies!" except
the newest member of all.
</p><p>"Now--" said Valentine Veery--"now everyone must keep very still while
we have the pleasure of listening to Jasper Jay."
</p><p>Of course, after hearing the song repeated so many times, Jasper
couldn't help learning a little of it. He began to bellow "Good-night,
Ladies!" in the harshest, most ear-splitting tones he knew. Some of his
listeners hurriedly tucked their heads under their wings, to shut out
the horrid sound. And as for Miss Kitty Catbird, she actually left the
meeting and flew straight home, because she felt that she must scream if
she stayed there any longer. Having a sensitive ear, she could not
endure Jasper's rasping voice. In her opinion, it sounded more like a
buzz saw than anything else.
