<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> IT is difficult for a seaman to believe that his stranded ship
does not feel as unhappy at the unnatural predicament of having
no water under her keel as he is himself at feeling her stranded.</p>

<p>Stranding is, indeed, the reverse of sinking.  The sea does not
close upon the water-logged hull with a sunny ripple, or maybe
with the angry rush of a curling wave, erasing her name from the
roll of living ships. No.  It is as if an invisible hand had been
stealthily uplifted from the bottom to catch hold of her keel
as it glides through the water.</p>

<p>More than any other event does stranding bring to the sailor
a sense of utter and dismal failure.  There are strandings and
strandings, but I am safe to say that 90 per cent. of them are
occasions in which a sailor, without dishonour, may well wish
himself dead; and I have no doubt that of those who had the experience
of their ship taking the ground, 90 per cent. did actually for
five seconds or so wish themselves dead.</p>

<p>"Taking the ground" is the professional expression for a ship
that is stranded in gentle circumstances.  But the feeling is
more as if the ground had taken hold of her.  It is for those
on her deck a surprising sensation.  It is as if your feet had
been caught in an imponderable snare; you feel the balance of
your body threatened, and the steady poise of your mind is destroyed
at once.  This sensation lasts only a second, for even while you
stagger something seems to turn over in your head, bringing uppermost
the mental exclamation, full of astonishment and dismay, "By Jove!
she’s on the ground!"</p>

<p>And that is very terrible.  After all, the only mission of a
seaman’s calling is to keep ships’ keels off the ground.  Thus
the moment of her stranding takes away from him every excuse for
his continued existence. To keep ships afloat is his business;
it is his trust; it is the effective formula of the bottom of
all these vague impulses, dreams, and illusions that go to the
making up of a boy’s vocation.  The grip of the land upon the
keel of your ship, even if nothing worse comes of it than the
wear and tear of tackle and the loss of time, remains in a seaman’s
memory an indelibly fixed taste of disaster.</p>

<p>"Stranded" within the meaning of this paper stands for a more
or less excusable mistake.  A ship may be "driven ashore" by stress
of weather. It is a catastrophe, a defeat.  To be "run ashore"
has the littleness, poignancy, and bitterness of human error.</p>
