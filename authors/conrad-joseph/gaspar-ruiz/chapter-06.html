<p> "I <em>KNEW </em>those people by sight," General Santierra would
tell his guests at the dining-table. "I mean the people with whom
Gaspar Ruiz found shelter. The father was an old Spaniard, a man
of property, ruined by the revolution. His estates, his house
in town, his money, everything he had in the world had been confiscated
by proclamation, for he was a bitter foe of our independence.
From a position of great dignity and influence on the Viceroy’s
Council he became of less importance than his own negro slaves
made free by our glorious revolution. He had not even the means
to flee the country, as other Spaniards had managed to do. It
may be that, wandering ruined and houseless, and burdened with
nothing but his life, which was left to him by the clemency of
the Provisional Government, he had simply walked under that broken
roof of old tiles. It was a lonely spot. There did not seem to
be even a dog belonging to the place. But though the roof had
holes, as if a cannonball or two had dropped through it, the wooden
shutters were thick and tight-closed all the time.</p>

<p>"My way took me frequently along the path in front of that miserable
rancho. I rode from the fort to the town almost every evening,
to sigh at the window of a lady I was in love with, then. When
one is young, you understand.... She was a good patriot, you may
be sure. Caballeros, credit me or not, political feeling ran so
high in those days that I do not believe I could have been fascinated
by the charms of a woman of Royalist opinions...."</p>

<p>Murmurs of amused incredulity all round the table interrupted
the General; and while they lasted he stroked his white beard
gravely.</p>

<p>"Senores," he protested, "a Royalist was a monster to our overwrought
feelings. I am telling you this in order not to be suspected of
the slightest tenderness towards that old Royalist’s daughter.
Moreover, as you know, my affections were engaged elsewhere. But
I could not help noticing her on rare occasions when with the
front door open she stood in the porch.</p>

<p>"You must know that this old Royalist was as crazy as a man can
be. His political misfortunes, his total downfall and ruin, had
disordered his mind. To show his contempt for what we patriots
could do, he affected to laugh at his imprisonment, at the confiscation
of his lands, the burning of his houses, and the misery to which
he and his womenfolk were reduced. This habit of laughing had
grown upon him, so that he would begin to laugh and shout directly
he caught sight of any stranger. That was the form of his madness.</p>

<p>"I, of course, disregarded the noise of that madman with that
feeling of superiority the success of our cause inspired in us
Americans. I suppose I really despised him because he was an old
Castilian, a Spaniard born, and a Royalist. Those were certainly
no reasons to scorn a man; but for centuries Spaniards born had
shown their contempt of us Americans, men as well descended as
themselves, simply because we were what they called colonists.
We had been kept in abasement and made to feel our inferiority
in social intercourse. And now it was our turn. It was sale for
us patriots to display the same sentiments; and I being a young
patriot, son of a patriot, despised that old Spaniard, and despising
him I naturally disregarded his abuse, though it was annoying
to my feelings. Others perhaps would not have been so forbearing.</p>

<p>"He would begin with a great yell&mdash;‘I see a patriot. Another
of them!’ long before I came abreast of the house. The tone of
his senseless revilings, mingled with bursts of laughter, was
sometimes piercingly shrill and sometimes grave. It was all very
mad; but I felt it incumbent upon my dignity to check my horse
to a walk without even glancing towards the house, as if that
man’s abusive clamour in the porch were less than the barking
of a cur. I rode by, preserving an expression of haughty indifference
on my face.</p>

<p>"It was no doubt very dignified; but I should have done better
if I had kept my eyes open. A military man in war time should
never consider himself off duty; and especially so if the war
is a revolutionary war, when the enemy is not at the door, but
within your very house. At such times the heat of passionate convictions,
passing into hatred, removes the restraints of honour and humanity
from many men and of delicacy and fear from some women. These
last, when once they throw off the timidity and reserve of their
sex, become by the vivacity of their intelligence and the violence
of their merciless resentment more dangerous than so many armed
giants."</p>

<p>The General’s voice rose, but his big hand stroked his white
beard twice with an effect of venerable calmness. "Si, senores!
Women are ready to rise to the heights of devotion unattainable
by us men, or to sink into the depths of abasement which amazes
our masculine prejudices. I am speaking now of exceptional women,
you understand..."</p>

<p>Here one of the guests observed that he had never met a woman
yet who was not capable of turning out quite exceptional under
circumstances that would engage her feelings strongly. "That sort
of superiority in recklessness they have over us," he concluded,
"makes of them the more interesting half of mankind."</p>

<p>The General, who bore the interruption with gravity, nodded courteous
assent. "Si. Si. Under circumstances.... Precisely. They can do
an infinite deal of mischief sometimes in quite unexpected ways.
For who could have imagined that a young girl, daughter of a ruined
Royalist whose life itself was held only by the contempt of his
enemies, would have had the power to bring death and devastation
upon two flourishing provinces and cause serious anxiety to the
leaders of the revolution in the very hour of its success!" He
paused to let the wonder of it penetrate our minds.</p>

<p>"Death and devastation," somebody murmured in surprise: "how
shocking!"</p>

<p>The old General gave a glance in the direction of the murmur
and went on. "Yes. That is, war&mdash;calamity. But the means by which
she obtained the power to work this havoc on our southern frontier
seem to me, who have seen her and spoken to her, still more shocking.
That particular thing left on my mind a dreadful amazement which
the further experience of life, of more than fifty years, has
done nothing to diminish." He looked round as if to make sure
of our attention, and, in a changed voice: "I am, as you know,
a republican, son of a Liberator," he declared. "My incomparable
mother, God rest her soul, was a Frenchwoman, the daughter of
an ardent republican. As a boy I fought for liberty; I’ve always
believed in the equality of men; and as to their brotherhood,
that, to my mind, is even more certain. Look at the fierce animosity
they display in their differences. And what in the world do you
know that is more bitterly fierce than brothers’ quarrels?"</p>

<p>All absence of cynicism checked an inclination to smile at this
view of human brotherhood. On the contrary, there was in the tone
the melancholy natural to a man profoundly humane at heart who
from duty, from conviction and from necessity, had played his
part in scenes of ruthless violence.</p>

<p>The General had seen much of fratricidal strife. "Certainly.
There is no doubt of their brotherhood," he insisted. "All men
are brothers, and as such know almost too much of each other.
But "&mdash;and here in the old patriarchal head, white as silver,
the black eyes humorously twinkled&mdash;"if we are all brothers, all
the women are not our sisters."</p>

<p>One of the younger guests was heard murmuring his satisfaction
at the fact. But the General continued, with deliberate earnestness:
"They are so different! The tale of a king who took a beggar-maid
for a partner of his throne may be pretty enough as we men look
upon ourselves and upon love. But that a young girl, famous for
her haughty beauty and, only a short time before, the admired
of all at the balls in the Viceroy’s palace, should take by the
hand a guasso, a common peasant, is intolerable to our sentiment
of women and their love. It is madness. Nevertheless it happened.
But it must be said that in her case it was the madness of hate&mdash;not
of love."</p>

<p>After presenting this excuse in a spirit of chivalrous justice,
the General remained silent for a time. "I rode past the house
every day almost," he began again, "and this was what was going
on within. But how it was going on no mind of man can conceive.
Her desperation must have been extreme, and Gaspar Ruiz was a
docile fellow. He had been an obedient soldier. His strength was
like an enormous stone lying on the ground, ready to be hurled
this way that by the hand that picks it up.</p>

<p>"It is clear that he would tell his story to the people who gave
him the shelter he needed. And he needed assistance badly. His
wound was not dangerous, but his life was forfeited. The old Royalist
being wrapped up in his laughing madness, the two women arranged
a hiding-place for the wounded man in one of the huts amongst
the fruit trees at the back of the house. That hovel, an abundance
of clear water while the fever was on him, and some words of pity
were all they could give. I suppose he had a share of what food
there was. And it would be but little; a handful of roasted corn,
perhaps a dish of beans, or a piece of bread with a few figs.
To such misery were those proud and once wealthy people reduced."</p>
