<p>Inasmuch as Terry and Fred had enough lunch left to furnish all
that was wanted, Deerfoot decided not to hunt for any thing else.
At that hour, when it was growing dark, it would have been hard
to find any game; but he told them that at no great distance above,
the tiny brook issued from a small lake, where he could easily
get all the fish he wanted.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the fire having been started at the rear of the
cavern, where the smoke found free vent, the three sat within
a circle of light, and partook of the coarse bread and cold venison.
The latter was tough, but it could not withstand the teeth of
the two youths, whose appetites were such as wait on high health.</p>

<p>It was noticeable that the young Shawanoe ate no more than half
as much as each of the others. Then saying that he wished to view
the camp from the outside, he went out in front of the cavern.
He remarked that he would be gone only a few minutes, but he took
his gun with him.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot emerged from the rude shelter it was fully dark.
There was a moon in the sky, but the density of the surrounding
forest kept out the rays, so that the gloom could not be penetrated
to any distance.</p>

<p>He stood still and listened. His sense of hearing, like that
of sight, was trained to a wonderfully fine point, as you have
learned in the incidents previously related, so that faint noises,
such as you or I could not have detected, would have told their
full story to him.</p>

<p>But nothing more than what may be called the natural sounds of
the wood fell on his ear. Then the young Indian leaped lightly
across the small brook in front of the cavern and walked some
two rods beyond, where he paused and listened again. After this
he made a complete circuit of the cavern. This compelled him to
cross the little stream once more, brought him back to the mouth
of the retreat, and caused him also to climb over a great deal
of broken ground, but a shadow could not have made the circuit
more noiselessly. He stopped several times and listened with the
same profound attention, occasionally looking toward the cavern
within which his friends were eating their supper and talking
together in low, guarded tones. He caught the murmur of their
voices, which would have been audible to no one else beyond a
dozen feet. Just above the large opening in the cavern, through
which most of the smoke found its way, a faint, dull glow showed
that the camp-fire was burning below.</p>

<p>The inspection made by Deerfoot was satisfactory; he had discovered
no sign of any prowling enemy, and the party could not have found
a place where there was less likelihood of disturbance by any
foes who were in the neighborhood. It would seem indeed that nothing
short of a most exceptional mishap could bring any danger near.
So he once more entered the cavern, and seated himself by the
fire, upon which Fred Linden had just thrown a bundle of sticks
that filled the cavern with a light like that of noonday.</p>

<p>Terry insisted that Deerfoot should take his blanket, because
the Shawanoe had none, and the one belonging to Fred Linden was
enough for the others. Deerfoot at first declined, but his young
friend persevered, so the half-dozen yards of heavy stuff were
spread on the rock and earth floor of the cabin, and then Deerfoot
disposed of himself in a lolling attitude, reclining on his left
elbow, while he looked across and through the blaze at his two
friends, who were stretched out in almost a similar attitude.
It will be borne in mind that he was nearer the mouth of the cavern
than were the others: in fact he was about half-way between where
they were stretched and the open air. Fred and Terry did not notice
this, or, if they did, they supposed it was accidental, though
it was done with forethought by the sagacious young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The evening was yet young, and the circumstances were such as
to make the boys talk at a rate that almost overwhelmed Deerfoot,
who always showed a deliberation in his speech, as if he weighed
each word before allowing it to fall from his lips.</p>

<p>Fred and Terry had formed a strong liking for the young Shawanoe,
and since he seemed to be in fine spirits, they plied him with
questions until they learned the chief facts in his history. When
the long conversation ended they knew that Deerfoot was the son
of a Shawanoe chief, and that he was born in the Dark and Bloody
Ground. When but a small boy he was like a spitting wildcat in
his hatred of the white people, and it was not until he was wounded
and nearly beaten to death, that he could be taken prisoner on
one of the excursions of his people against the white settlements.</p>

<p>He fell into goods hands and was nursed back to strength. Not
only that, but those that had him in direct charge told him about
God, who made the world, who loved His creatures, and who sorrowed
to see them trying to harm each other, and who had sent His only
Son to die for His lost children. It was a wonderful story to
which Deerfoot listened with rapt attention, and all in time (as
you have been told in another place), the extraordinary young
Shawanoe became a devout follower of the meek and lowly One. He
felt that he could never repay the whites for showing him the
way to eternal life. Thenceforward he became their friend, and
devoted his life to protecting them against the enmity of the
red men.</p>

<p>Deerfoot told Fred and Terry something about his stirring experiences
with Ned Preston and Wildblossom Brown, and afterward with Jack
Carleton and Otto Relstaub, but did not hint at one-tenth the
services he had rendered the white people. Of all the fierce tribes
that made portions of Ohio and Kentucky like sheol on earth, the
Shawanoes were the worst: they were the Apaches of the last century.
Deerfoot had fallen into their hands and many of his most desperate
encounters were with them. Finally the efforts to take him prisoner
became so far reaching that he saw that his usefulness as a friend
of the settlements was at end. The rage of the Shawanoes was such
that it may be said that some of their campaigns were planned
with the sole purpose of capturing the young renegade, whom they
hated with a hatred like that of the tigers of the jungle.</p>

<p>You will see, therefore, that not only was the usefulness of
Deerfoot as an ally of the whites ended, but he became even an
element of danger to them. He had been urged to make his home
with those who held him in such high regard, but he could not
do so. He quietly withdrew from the country and crossed the Mississippi
into the vast Louisiana Territory. There he had lived for a couple
of years, and there he expected to end his days.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot," said Fred Linden, when his remarkable narration had
ended, "Terry and I are not new hands in the woods, and we would
be much better satisfied if you would allow us to share the night
in watching with you."</p>

<p>"Why does my brother think of danger?"</p>

<p>"Because <em>you</em> do; I know it by your actions."</p>

<p>The quickness of this reply struck Deerfoot favorably. He did
not think that his conduct had been noticed, and he was gratified
that his friend was so observant. That there should be no mistake
about his suspicions, Fred added:</p>

<p>"I don't know whether you have seen that Winnebago or not since
you started him on the run yesterday; he may be still running,
but I am quite sure, from the way you have behaved, that you suspect
that he and the rest of his companions are prowling through the
woods, on the lookout for a chance to revenge themselves."</p>

<p>Deerfoot's face glowed. Fred Linden had hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>"My brother speaks the words of truth; his thoughts are the thoughts
of Deerfoot."</p>

<p>Terry Clark looked at his companion in astonishment.</p>

<p>"How come ye to know all that, Fred?"</p>

<p>"I see nothing remarkable about it; all I had to do was to observe
the actions of Deerfoot since he joined us to-day. In the first
place, he wouldn't have made us change our camping place if he
hadn't had some misgiving, and then the way he has been mousing
around the outside, and his decision to keep watch to-night: why
what could tell the story more plainly?"</p>

<p>"Begorrah," said the admiring Terry, "ye are not such a big fool
as you look to be; I never thought of that."</p>

<p>"Which looks as if you are a bigger dunce than you seem; but,"
added Fred, turning toward the Shawanoe, "have you seen any thing
of the Winnebagos?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has seen their footprints in the woods; they are on
the watch for his white brothers that they may gain their scalps,
because the gun of the Wolf was taken from him."</p>

<p>"They seem to have hard work in finding us: where do those Winnebagos
come from?"</p>

<p>Deerfoot pointed to the northward, or rather to a little east
of north.</p>

<p>"Their hunting grounds are many suns' travel that way."</p>

<p>"Why do the spalpeens come down in this part of the world, and
why don't they behave thimselves whin they do?" demanded Terry,
with some indignation.</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head, as though the question was more than
he could answer.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has met Shawanoes and Sacs and Wyandottes and Pawnees
far away from their villages and hunting grounds, besides the
strange Indians who come much further from the setting sun. The
red men travel whither they will. Why the Winnebagos passed near
the home of my brothers only they can tell."</p>

<p>"Well, they're a bad lot," said Terry, "to try the mean trick
they did on me; though," he added the next moment, "I'm glad they
done the same, for if they hadn't, how would I've got hold of
this lovely gun? Do ye think we shall have any more trouble with
them?"</p>

<p>"Deerfoot believes there will be trouble, and it will come soon!"</p>

<p>"Well, if it does, all ye have to do is to take away the rist
of their guns and set 'em on the run home agin."</p>
