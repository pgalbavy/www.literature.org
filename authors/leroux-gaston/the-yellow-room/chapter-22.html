<p>I bent in great anxiety over the body of the reporter and had
the joy to find that he was deeply sleeping, the same unhealthy
sleep that I had seen fall upon Frederic Larsan. He had succumbed
to the influence of the same drug that had been mixed with our
food. How was it then, that I, also, had not been overcome by
it? I reflected that the drug must have been put into our wine;
because that would explain my condition. I never drink when eating.
Naturally inclined to obesity, I am restricted to a dry diet.
I shook Rouletabille, but could not succeed in waking him. This,
no doubt, was the work of Mademoiselle Stangerson.</p>

<p>She had certainly thought it necessary to guard herself against
this young man as well as her father. I recalled that the steward,
in serving us, had recommended an excellent Chablis which, no
doubt, had come from the professor’s table.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of an hour passed. I resolved, under the
pressing circumstances, to resort to extreme measures. I threw
a pitcher of cold water over Rouletabille’s head. He opened his
eyes. I beat his face, and raised him up. I felt him stiffen in
my arms and heard him murmur: "Go on, go on; but don’t make any
noise." I pinched him and shook him until he was able to stand
up. We were saved!</p>

<p>"They sent me to sleep," he said. "Ah! I passed an awful quarter
of an hour before giving way. But it is over now. Don’t leave
me."</p>

<p>He had no sooner uttered those words than we were thrilled by
a frightful cry that rang through the chateau,&mdash;a veritable death
cry.</p>

<p>"Malheur!" roared Rouletabille; "we shall be too late!"</p>

<p>He tried to rush to the door, but he was too dazed, and fell
against the wall. I was already in the gallery, revolver in hand,
rushing like a madman towards Mademoiselle Stangerson’s room.
The moment I arrived at the intersection of the "off-turning"
gallery and the "right" gallery, I saw a figure leaving her apartment,
which, in a few strides had reached the landing-place.</p>

<p>I was not master of myself. I fired. The report from the revolver
made a deafening noise; but the man continued his flight down
the stairs. I ran behind him, shouting: "Stop!&mdash;stop! or I will
kill you!" As I rushed after him down the stairs, I came face
to face with Arthur Rance coming from the left wing of the chateau,
yelling: "What is it? What is it?" We arrived almost at the same
time at the foot of the staircase. The window of the vestibule
was open. We distinctly saw the form of a man running away. Instinctively
we fired our revolvers in his direction. He was not more than
ten paces in front of us; he staggered and we thought he was going
to fall. We had sprung out of the window, but the man dashed off
with renewed vigour. I was in my socks, and the American was barefooted.
There being no hope of overtaking him, we fired our last cartridges
at him. But he still kept on running, going along the right side
of the court towards the end of the right wing of the chateau,
which had no other outlet than the door of the little chamber
occupied by the forest-keeper. The man, though he was evidently
wounded by our bullets, was now twenty yards ahead of us. Suddenly,
behind us, and above our heads, a window in the gallery opened
and we heard the voice of Rouletabille crying out desperately:</p>

<p>"Fire, Bernier! &mdash;Fire!"</p>

<p>At that moment the clear moonlight night was further lit by a
broad flash. By its light we saw Daddy Bernier with his gun on
the threshold of the donjon door.</p>

<p>He had taken good aim. The shadow fell. But as it had reached
the end of the right wing of the chateau, it fell on the other
side of the angle of the building; that is to say, we saw it about
to fall, but not the actual sinking to the ground. Bernier, Arthur
Rance and myself reached the other side twenty seconds later.
The shadow was lying dead at our feet.</p>

<p>Aroused from his lethargy by the cries and reports, Larsan opened
the window of his chamber and called out to us. Rouletabille,
quite awake now, joined us at the same moment, and I cried out
to him:</p>

<p>"He is dead!&mdash;is dead!"</p>

<p>"So much the better," he said. "Take him into the vestibule of
the chateau." Then as if on second thought, he said: "No!&mdash;no!
Let us put him in his own room."</p>

<p>Rouletabille knocked at the door. Nobody answered. Naturally,
this did not surprise me.</p>

<p>"He is evidently not there, otherwise he would have come out,"
said the reporter. "Let us carry him to the vestibule then."</p>

<p>Since reaching the dead shadow, a thick cloud had covered the
moon and darkened the night, so that we were unable to make out
the features. Daddy Jacques, who had now joined us, helped us
to carry the body into the vestibule, where we laid it down on
the lower step of the stairs. On the way, I had felt my hands
wet from the warm blood flowing from the wounds.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques flew to the kitchen and returned with a lantern.
He held it close to the face of the dead shadow, and we recognised
the keeper, the man called by the landlord of the Donjon Inn the
Green Man, whom, an hour earlier, I had seen come out of Arthur
Rance’s chamber carrying a parcel. But what I had seen I could
only tell Rouletabille later, when we were alone.</p>

<p>Rouletabille and Frederic Larsan experienced a cruel disappointment
at the result of the night’s adventure. They could only look in
consternation and stupefaction at the body of the Green Man.</p>

<p>Daddy Jacques showed a stupidly sorrowful face and with silly
lamentations kept repeating that we were mistaken&mdash;the keeper
could not be the assailant. We were obliged to compel him to be
quiet. He could not have shown greater grief had the body been
that of his own son. I noticed, while all the rest of us were
more or less undressed and barefooted, that he was fully clothed.</p>

<p>Rouletabille had not left the body. Kneeling on the flagstones
by the light of Daddy Jacques’s lantern he removed the clothes
from the body and laid bare its breast. Then snatching the lantern
from Daddy Jacques, he held it over the corpse and saw a gaping
wound. Rising suddenly he exclaimed in a voice filled with savage
irony:</p>

<p>"The man you believe to have been shot was killed by the stab
of a knife in his heart!"</p>

<p>I thought Rouletabille had gone mad; but, bending over the body,
I quickly satisfied myself that Rouletabille was right. Not a
sign of a bullet anywhere&mdash;the wound, evidently made by a sharp
blade, had penetrated the heart.</p>
