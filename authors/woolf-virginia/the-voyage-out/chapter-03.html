<p>Early next morning there was a sound as of chains being drawn
roughly overhead; the steady heart of the <em>Euphrosyne</em>
slowly ceased to beat; and Helen, poking her nose above deck,
saw a stationary castle upon a stationary hill. They had dropped
anchor in the mouth of the Tagus, and instead of cleaving new
waves perpetually, the same waves kept returning and washing against
the sides of the ship.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was done, Willoughby disappeared over the
vessel's side, carrying a brown leather case, shouting over his
shoulder that every one was to mind and behave themselves, for
he would be kept in Lisbon doing business until five o'clock that
afternoon.</p>

<p>At about that hour he reappeared, carrying his case, professing
himself tired, bothered, hungry, thirsty, cold, and in immediate
need of his tea. Rubbing his hands, he told them the adventures
of the day: how he had come upon poor old Jackson combing his
moustache before the glass in the office, little expecting his
descent, had put him through such a morning's work as seldom came
his way; then treated him to a lunch of champagne and ortolans;
paid a call upon Mrs. Jackson, who was fatter than ever, poor
woman, but asked kindly after Rachel&mdash;and O Lord, little Jackson
had confessed to a confounded piece of weakness&mdash;well, well, no
harm was done, he supposed, but what was the use of his giving
orders if they were promptly disobeyed? He had said distinctly
that he would take no passengers on this trip. Here he began searching
in his pockets and eventually discovered a card, which he planked
down on the table before Rachel. On it she read, "Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Dalloway, 23 Browne Street, Mayfair."</p>

<p>"Mr. Richard Dalloway," continued Vinrace, "seems to be a gentleman
who thinks that because he was once a member of Parliament, and
his wife's the daughter of a peer, they can have what they like
for the asking. They got round poor little Jackson anyhow. Said
they must have passages&mdash;produced a letter from Lord Glenaway,
asking me as a personal favour&mdash;overruled any objections Jackson
made (I don't believe they came to much), and so there's nothing
for it but to submit, I suppose."</p>

<p>But it was evident that for some reason or other Willoughby was
quite pleased to submit, although he made a show of growling.</p>

<p>The truth was that Mr. and Mrs. Dalloway had found themselves
stranded in Lisbon. They had been travelling on the Continent
for some weeks, chiefly with a view to broadening Mr. Dalloway's
mind. Unable for a season, by one of the accidents of political
life, to serve his country in Parliament, Mr. Dalloway was doing
the best he could to serve it out of Parliament. For that purpose
the Latin countries did very well, although the East, of course,
would have done better.</p>

<p>"Expect to hear of me next in Petersburg or Teheran," he had
said, turning to wave farewell from the steps of the Travellers'.
But a disease had broken out in the East, there was cholera in
Russia, and he was heard of, not so romantically, in Lisbon. They
had been through France; he had stopped at manufacturing centres
where, producing letters of introduction, he had been shown over
works, and noted facts in a pocket-book. In Spain he and Mrs.
Dalloway had mounted mules, for they wished to understand how
the peasants live. Are they ripe for rebellion, for example? Mrs.
Dalloway had then insisted upon a day or two at Madrid with the
pictures. Finally they arrived in Lisbon and spent six days which,
in a journal privately issued afterwards, they described as of
"unique interest." Richard had audiences with ministers, and foretold
a crisis at no distant date, "the foundations of government being
incurably corrupt. Yet how blame, etc."; while Clarissa inspected
the royal stables, and took several snapshots showing men now
exiled and windows now broken. Among other things she photographed
Fielding's grave, and let loose a small bird which some ruffian
had trapped, "because one hates to think of anything in a cage
where English people lie buried," the diary stated. Their tour
was thoroughly unconventional, and followed no meditated plan.
The foreign correspondents of the <em>Times</em> decided their
route as much as anything else. Mr. Dalloway wished to look at
certain guns, and was of opinion that the African coast is far
more unsettled than people at home were inclined to believe. For
these reasons they wanted a slow inquisitive kind of ship, comfortable,
for they were bad sailors, but not extravagant, which would stop
for a day or two at this port and at that, taking in coal while
the Dalloways saw things for themselves. Meanwhile they found
themselves stranded in Lisbon, unable for the moment to lay hands
upon the precise vessel they wanted. They heard of the <em>Euphrosyne</em>,
but heard also that she was primarily a cargo boat, and only took
passengers by special arrangement, her business being to carry
dry goods to the Amazons, and rubber home again. "By special arrangement,"
however, were words of high encouragement to them, for they came
of a class where almost everything was specially arranged, or
could be if necessary. On this occasion all that Richard did was
to write a note to Lord Glenaway, the head of the line which bears
his title; to call on poor old Jackson; to represent to him how
Mrs. Dalloway was so-and-so, and he had been something or other
else, and what they wanted was such and such a thing. It was done.
They parted with compliments and pleasure on both sides, and here,
a week later, came the boat rowing up to the ship in the dusk
with the Dalloways on board of it; in three minutes they were
standing together on the deck of the <em>Euphrosyne</em>. Their
arrival, of course, created some stir, and it was seen by several
pairs of eyes that Mrs. Dalloway was a tall slight woman, her
body wrapped in furs, her head in veils, while Mr. Dalloway appeared
to be a middle-sized man of sturdy build, dressed like a sportsman
on an autumnal moor. Many solid leather bags of a rich brown hue
soon surrounded them, in addition to which Mr. Dalloway carried
a despatch box, and his wife a dressing-case suggestive of a diamond
necklace and bottles with silver tops.</p>

<p>"It's so like Whistler!" she exclaimed, with a wave towards the
shore, as she shook Rachel by the hand, and Rachel had only time
to look at the grey hills on one side of her before Willoughby
introduced Mrs. Chailey, who took the lady to her cabin.</p>

<p>Momentary though it seemed, nevertheless the interruption was
upsetting; every one was more or less put out by it, from Mr.
Grice, the steward, to Ridley himself. A few minutes later Rachel
passed the smoking-room, and found Helen moving arm-chairs. She
was absorbed in her arrangements, and on seeing Rachel remarked
confidentially:</p>

<p>"If one can give men a room to themselves where they will sit,
it's all to the good. Arm-chairs are <em>the</em> important things&mdash;"
She began wheeling them about. "Now, does it still look like a
bar at a railway station?"</p>

<p>She whipped a plush cover off a table. The appearance of the
place was marvellously improved.</p>

<p>Again, the arrival of the strangers made it obvious to Rachel,
as the hour of dinner approached, that she must change her dress;
and the ringing of the great bell found her sitting on the edge
of her berth in such a position that the little glass above the
washstand reflected her head and shoulders. In the glass she wore
an expression of tense melancholy, for she had come to the depressing
conclusion, since the arrival of the Dalloways, that her face
was not the face she wanted, and in all probability never would
be.</p>

<p>However, punctuality had been impressed on her, and whatever
face she had, she must go in to dinner.</p>

<p>These few minutes had been used by Willoughby in sketching to
the Dalloways the people they were to meet, and checking them
upon his fingers.</p>

<p>"There's my brother-in-law, Ambrose, the scholar (I daresay you've
heard his name), his wife, my old friend Pepper, a very quiet
fellow, but knows everything, I'm told. And that's all. We're
a very small party. I'm dropping them on the coast."</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalloway, with her head a little on one side, did her best
to recollect Ambrose&mdash;was it a surname?&mdash;but failed. She was made
slightly uneasy by what she had heard. She knew that scholars
married any one&mdash;girls they met in farms on reading parties; or
little suburban women who said disagreeably, "Of course I know
it's my husband you want; not <em>me</em>."</p>

<p>But Helen came in at that point, and Mrs. Dalloway saw with relief
that though slightly eccentric in appearance, she was not untidy,
held herself well, and her voice had restraint in it, which she
held to be the sign of a lady. Mr. Pepper had not troubled to
change his neat ugly suit.</p>

<p>"But after all," Clarissa thought to herself as she followed
Vinrace in to dinner, "<em>every</em> <em>one's</em> interesting
really."</p>

<p>When seated at the table she had some need of that assurance,
chiefly because of Ridley, who came in late, looked decidedly
unkempt, and took to his soup in profound gloom.</p>

<p>An imperceptible signal passed between husband and wife, meaning
that they grasped the situation and would stand by each other
loyally. With scarcely a pause Mrs. Dalloway turned to Willoughby
and began:</p>

<p>"What I find so tiresome about the sea is that there are no flowers
in it. Imagine fields of hollyhocks and violets in mid-ocean!
How divine!"</p>

<p>"But somewhat dangerous to navigation," boomed Richard, in the
bass, like the bassoon to the flourish of his wife's violin. "Why,
weeds can be bad enough, can't they, Vinrace? I remember crossing
in the <em>Mauretania</em> once, and saying to the Captain &mdash;Richards&mdash;did
you know him?&mdash;'Now tell me what perils you really dread most
for your ship, Captain Richards?' expecting him to say icebergs,
or derelicts, or fog, or something of that sort. Not a bit of
it. I've always remembered his answer. '<em>Sedgius</em> <em>aquatici</em>,'
he said, which I take to be a kind of duck-weed."</p>

<p>Mr. Pepper looked up sharply, and was about to put a question
when Willoughby continued:</p>

<p>"They've an awful time of it&mdash;those captains! Three thousand
souls on board!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said Clarissa. She turned to Helen with an air
of profundity. "I'm convinced people are wrong when they say it's
work that wears one; it's responsibility. That's why one pays
one's cook more than one's housemaid, I suppose."</p>

<p>"According to that, one ought to pay one's nurse double; but
one doesn't," said Helen.</p>

<p>"No; but think what a joy to have to do with babies, instead
of saucepans!" said Mrs. Dalloway, looking with more interest
at Helen, a probable mother.</p>

<p>"I'd much rather be a cook than a nurse," said Helen. "Nothing
would induce me to take charge of children."</p>

<p>"Mothers always exaggerate," said Ridley. "A well-bred child
is no responsibility. I've travelled all over Europe with mine.
You just wrap 'em up warm and put 'em in the rack."</p>

<p>Helen laughed at that. Mrs. Dalloway exclaimed, looking at Ridley:</p>

<p>"How like a father! My husband's just the same. And then one
talks of the equality of the sexes!"</p>

<p>"Does one?" said Mr. Pepper.</p>

<p>"Oh, some do!" cried Clarissa. "My husband had to pass an irate
lady every afternoon last session who said nothing else, I imagine."</p>

<p>"She sat outside the house; it was very awkward," said Dalloway.
"At last I plucked up courage and said to her, 'My good creature,
you're only in the way where you are. You're hindering me, and
you're doing no good to yourself.'"</p>

<p>"And then she caught him by the coat, and would have scratched
his eyes out&mdash;" Mrs. Dalloway put in.</p>

<p>"Pooh&mdash;that's been exaggerated," said Richard. "No, I pity them,
I confess. The discomfort of sitting on those steps must be awful."</p>

<p>"Serve them right," said Willoughby curtly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm entirely with you there," said Dalloway. "Nobody can
condemn the utter folly and futility of such behaviour more than
I do; and as for the whole agitation, well! may I be in my grave
before a woman has the right to vote in England! That's all I
say."</p>

<p>The solemnity of her husband's assertion made Clarissa grave.</p>

<p>"It's unthinkable," she said. "Don't tell me you're a suffragist?"
she turned to Ridley.</p>

<p>"I don't care a fig one way or t'other," said Ambrose. "If any
creature is so deluded as to think that a vote does him or her
any good, let him have it. He'll soon learn better."</p>

<p>"You're not a politician, I see," she smiled.</p>

<p>"Goodness, no," said Ridley.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid your husband won't approve of me," said Dalloway
aside, to Mrs. Ambrose. She suddenly recollected that he had been
in Parliament.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever find it rather dull?" she asked, not knowing
exactly what to say.</p>

<p>Richard spread his hands before him, as if inscriptions were
to be read in the palms of them.</p>

<p>"If you ask me whether I ever find it rather dull," he said,
"I am bound to say yes; on the other hand, if you ask me what
career do you consider on the whole, taking the good with the
bad, the most enjoyable and enviable, not to speak of its more
serious side, of all careers, for a man, I am bound to say, 'The
Politician's.'"</p>

<p>"The Bar or politics, I agree," said Willoughby. "You get more
run for your money."</p>

<p>"All one's faculties have their play," said Richard. "I may be
treading on dangerous ground; but what I feel about poets and
artists in general is this: on your own lines, you can't be beaten&mdash;granted;
but off your own lines&mdash;puff&mdash;one has to make allowances. Now,
I shouldn't like to think that any one had to make allowances
for me."</p>

<p>"I don't quite agree, Richard," said Mrs. Dalloway. "Think of
Shelley. I feel that there's almost everything one wants in 'Adonais.'"</p>

<p>"Read 'Adonais' by all means," Richard conceded. "But whenever
I hear of Shelley I repeat to myself the words of Matthew Arnold,
'What a set! What a set!'"</p>

<p>This roused Ridley's attention. "Matthew Arnold? A detestable
prig!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"A prig&mdash;granted," said Richard; "but, I think a man of the world.
That's where my point comes in. We politicians doubtless seem
to you" (he grasped somehow that Helen was the representative
of the arts) "a gross commonplace set of people; but we see both
sides; we may be clumsy, but we do our best to get a grasp of
things. Now your artists <em>find</em> things in a mess, shrug
their shoulders, turn aside to their visions&mdash;which I grant may
be very beautiful&mdash;and <em>leave</em> things in a mess. Now that
seems to me evading one's responsibilities. Besides, we aren't
all born with the artistic faculty."</p>

<p>"It's dreadful," said Mrs. Dalloway, who, while her husband spoke,
had been thinking. "When I'm with artists I feel so intensely
the delights of shutting oneself up in a little world of one's
own, with pictures and music and everything beautiful, and then
I go out into the streets and the first child I meet with its
poor, hungry, dirty little face makes me turn round and say, 'No,
I <em>can't</em> shut myself up &mdash;I <em>won't</em> live in
a world of my own. I should like to stop all the painting and
writing and music until this kind of thing exists no longer.'
Don't you feel," she wound up, addressing Helen, "that life's
a perpetual conflict?" Helen considered for a moment. "No," she
said. "I don't think I do."</p>

<p>There was a pause, which was decidedly uncomfortable. Mrs. Dalloway
then gave a little shiver, and asked whether she might have her
fur cloak brought to her. As she adjusted the soft brown fur about
her neck a fresh topic struck her.</p>

<p>"I own," she said, "that I shall never forget the <em>Antigone</em>.
I saw it at Cambridge years ago, and it's haunted me ever since.
Don't you think it's quite the most modern thing you ever saw?"
she asked Ridley. "It seemed to me I'd known twenty Clytemnestras.
Old Lady Ditchling for one. I don't know a word of Greek, but
I could listen to it for ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here Mr. Pepper struck up:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
πολλἀ τἀ δεινά, κοὐδἑν ἀν-<br/>
θρώπου δεινότερον πέλει.<br/>
τοῦτο καί πολιοῦ πέραν<br/>
πόντου χειμερίῳ νότῳ<br/>
χωρεῖ, περιβρυχίοισι<br/>
περῶν ὑπ´ οῐδμασι

</p>
</div>
<p>Mrs. Dalloway looked at him with compressed lips.</p>

<p>"I'd give ten years of my life to know Greek," she said, when
he had done.</p>

<p>"I could teach you the alphabet in half an hour," said Ridley,
"and you'd read Homer in a month. I should think it an honour
to instruct you."</p>

<p>Helen, engaged with Mr. Dalloway and the habit, now fallen into
decline, of quoting Greek in the House of Commons, noted, in the
great commonplace book that lies open beside us as we talk, the
fact that all men, even men like Ridley, really prefer women to
be fashionable.</p>

<p>Clarissa exclaimed that she could think of nothing more delightful.
For an instant she saw herself in her drawing-room in Browne Street
with a Plato open on her knees &mdash;Plato in the original Greek.
She could not help believing that a real scholar, if specially
interested, could slip Greek into her head with scarcely any trouble.</p>

<p>Ridley engaged her to come to-morrow.</p>

<p>"If only your ship is going to treat us kindly!" she exclaimed,
drawing Willoughby into play. For the sake of guests, and these
were distinguished, Willoughby was ready with a bow of his head
to vouch for the good behaviour even of the waves.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully bad; and my husband's not very good," sighed
Clarissa.</p>

<p>"I am never sick," Richard explained. "At least, I have only
been actually sick once," he corrected himself. "That was crossing
the Channel. But a choppy sea, I confess, or still worse, a swell,
makes me distinctly uncomfortable. The great thing is never to
miss a meal. You look at the food, and you say, 'I can't'; you
take a mouthful, and Lord knows how you're going to swallow it;
but persevere, and you often settle the attack for good. My wife's
a coward."</p>

<p>They were pushing back their chairs. The ladies were hesitating
at the doorway.</p>

<p>"I'd better show the way," said Helen, advancing.</p>

<p>Rachel followed. She had taken no part in the talk; no one had
spoken to her; but she had listened to every word that was said.
She had looked from Mrs. Dalloway to Mr. Dalloway, and from Mr.
Dalloway back again. Clarissa, indeed, was a fascinating spectacle.
She wore a white dress and a long glittering necklace. What with
her clothes, and her arch delicate face, which showed exquisitely
pink beneath hair turning grey, she was astonishingly like an
eighteenth-century masterpiece&mdash;a Reynolds or a Romney. She made
Helen and the others look coarse and slovenly beside her. Sitting
lightly upright she seemed to be dealing with the world as she
chose; the enormous solid globe spun round this way and that beneath
her fingers. And her husband! Mr. Dalloway rolling that rich deliberate
voice was even more impressive. He seemed to come from the humming
oily centre of the machine where the polished rods are sliding,
and the pistons thumping; he grasped things so firmly but so loosely;
he made the others appear like old maids cheapening remnants.
Rachel followed in the wake of the matrons, as if in a trance;
a curious scent of violets came back from Mrs. Dalloway, mingling
with the soft rustling of her skirts, and the tinkling of her
chains. As she followed, Rachel thought with supreme self-abasement,
taking in the whole course of her life and the lives of all her
friends, "She said we lived in a world of our own. It's true.
We're perfectly absurd."</p>

<p>"We sit in here," said Helen, opening the door of the saloon.</p>

<p>"You play?" said Mrs. Dalloway to Mrs. Ambrose, taking up the
score of <em>Tristan</em> which lay on the table.</p>

<p>"My niece does," said Helen, laying her hand on Rachel's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I envy you!" Clarissa addressed Rachel for the first
time. "D'you remember this? Isn't it divine?" She played a bar
or two with ringed fingers upon the page.</p>

<p>"And then Tristan goes like this, and Isolde&mdash;oh!&mdash;it's all too
thrilling! Have you been to Bayreuth?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't," said Rachel. `"Then that's still to come. I
shall never forget my first <em>Parsifal</em>&mdash;a grilling August
day, and those fat old German women, come in their stuffy high
frocks, and then the dark theatre, and the music beginning, and
one couldn't help sobbing. A kind man went and fetched me water,
I remember; and I could only cry on his shoulder! It caught me
here" (she touched her throat). "It's like nothing else in the
world! But where's your piano?" "It's in another room," Rachel
explained.</p>

<p>"But you will play to us?" Clarissa entreated. "I can't imagine
anything nicer than to sit out in the moonlight and listen to
music&mdash;only that sounds too like a schoolgirl! You know," she
said, turning to Helen, "I don't think music's altogether good
for people &mdash;I'm afraid not."</p>

<p>"Too great a strain?" asked Helen.</p>

<p>"Too emotional, somehow," said Clarissa. "One notices it at once
when a boy or girl takes up music as a profession. Sir William
Broadley told me just the same thing. Don't you hate the kind
of attitudes people go into over Wagner&mdash;like this&mdash;" She cast
her eyes to the ceiling, clasped her hands, and assumed a look
of intensity. "It really doesn't mean that they appreciate him;
in fact, I always think it's the other way round. The people who
really care about an art are always the least affected. D'you
know Henry Philips, the painter?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen him," said Helen.</p>

<p>"To look at, one might think he was a successful stockbroker,
and not one of the greatest painters of the age. That's what I
like."</p>

<p>"There are a great many successful stockbrokers, if you like
looking at them," said Helen.</p>

<p>Rachel wished vehemently that her aunt would not be so perverse.</p>

<p>"When you see a musician with long hair, don't you know instinctively
that he's bad?" Clarissa asked, turning to Rachel. "Watts and
Joachim&mdash;they looked just like you and me."</p>

<p>"And how much nicer they'd have looked with curls!" said Helen.
"The question is, are you going to aim at beauty or are you not?"</p>

<p>"Cleanliness!" said Clarissa, "I do want a man to look clean!"</p>

<p>"By cleanliness you really mean well-cut clothes," said Helen.</p>

<p>"There's something one knows a gentleman by," said Clarissa,
"but one can't say what it is."</p>

<p>"Take my husband now, does he look like a gentleman?"</p>

<p>The question seemed to Clarissa in extraordinarily bad taste.
"One of the things that can't be said," she would have put it.
She could find no answer, but a laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow," she said, turning to Rachel, "I shall insist
upon your playing to me to-morrow."</p>

<p>There was that in her manner that made Rachel love her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dalloway hid a tiny yawn, a mere dilation of the nostrils.</p>

<p>"D'you know," she said, "I'm extraordinarily sleepy. It's the
sea air. I think I shall escape."</p>

<p>A man's voice, which she took to be that of Mr. Pepper, strident
in discussion, and advancing upon the saloon, gave her the alarm.</p>

<p>"Good-night&mdash;good-night!" she said. "Oh, I know my way&mdash;do pray
for calm! Good-night!"</p>

<p>Her yawn must have been the image of a yawn. Instead of letting
her mouth droop, dropping all her clothes in a bunch as though
they depended on one string, and stretching her limbs to the utmost
end of her berth, she merely changed her dress for a dressing-gown,
with innumerable frills, and wrapping her feet in a rug, sat down
with a writing-pad on her knee. Already this cramped little cabin
was the dressing room of a lady of quality. There were bottles
containing liquids; there were trays, boxes, brushes, pins. Evidently
not an inch of her person lacked its proper instrument. The scent
which had intoxicated Rachel pervaded the air. Thus established,
Mrs. Dalloway began to write. A pen in her hands became a thing
one caressed paper with, and she might have been stroking and
tickling a kitten as she wrote:</p>

<p>Picture us, my dear, afloat in the very oddest ship you can imagine.
It's not the ship, so much as the people. One does come across
queer sorts as one travels. I must say I find it hugely amusing.
There's the manager of the line&mdash;called Vinrace&mdash;a nice big Englishman,
doesn't say much&mdash;you know the sort. As for the rest&mdash;they might
have come trailing out of an old number of <em>Punch</em>. They're
like people playing croquet in the 'sixties. How long they've
all been shut up in this ship I don't know&mdash;years and years I
should say&mdash;but one feels as though one had boarded a little separate
world, and they'd never been on shore, or done ordinary things
in their lives. It's what I've always said about literary people&mdash;they're
far the hardest of any to get on with. The worst of it is, these
people&mdash;a man and his wife and a niece&mdash;might have been, one feels,
just like everybody else, if they hadn't got swallowed up by Oxford
or Cambridge or some such place, and been made cranks of. The
man's really delightful (if he'd cut his nails), and the woman
has quite a fine face, only she dresses, of course, in a potato
sack, and wears her hair like a Liberty shopgirl's. They talk
about art, and think us such poops for dressing in the evening.
However, I can't help that; I'd rather die than come in to dinner
without changing&mdash;wouldn't you? It matters ever so much more than
the soup. (It's odd how things like that <em>do</em> matter so
much more than what's generally supposed to matter. I'd rather
have my head cut off than wear flannel next the skin.) Then there's
a nice shy girl&mdash;poor thing &mdash;I wish one could rake her out
before it's too late. She has quite nice eyes and hair, only,
of course, she'll get funny too. We ought to start a society for
broadening the minds of the young&mdash;much more useful than missionaries,
Hester! Oh, I'd forgotten there's a dreadful little thing called
Pepper. He's just like his name. He's indescribably insignificant,
and rather queer in his temper, poor dear. It's like sitting down
to dinner with an ill-conditioned fox-terrier, only one can't
comb him out, and sprinkle him with powder, as one would one's
dog. It's a pity, sometimes, one can't treat people like dogs!
The great comfort is that we're away from newspapers, so that
Richard will have a real holiday this time. Spain wasn't a holiday.
. . .</p>

<p>"You coward!" said Richard, almost filling the room with his
sturdy figure.</p>

<p>"I did my duty at dinner!" cried Clarissa.</p>

<p>"You've let yourself in for the Greek alphabet, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear! Who <em>is</em> Ambrose?"</p>

<p>"I gather that he was a Cambridge don; lives in London now, and
edits classics."</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a set of cranks? The woman asked me if
I thought her husband looked like a gentleman!"</p>

<p>"It was hard to keep the ball rolling at dinner, certainly,"
said Richard. "Why is it that the women, in that class, are so
much queerer than the men?"</p>

<p>"They're not half bad-looking, really&mdash;only&mdash;they're so odd!"</p>

<p>They both laughed, thinking of the same things, so that there
was no need to compare their impressions.</p>

<p>"I see I shall have quite a lot to say to Vinrace," said Richard.
"He knows Sutton and all that set. He can tell me a good deal
about the conditions of ship-building in the North."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad. The men always <em>are</em> so much better than
the women."</p>

<p>"One always has something to say to a man certainly," said Richard.
"But I've no doubt you'll chatter away fast enough about the babies,
Clarice."</p>

<p>"Has she got children? She doesn't look like it somehow."</p>

<p>"Two. A boy and girl."</p>

<p>A pang of envy shot through Mrs. Dalloway's heart.</p>

<p>"We <em>must</em> have a son, Dick," she said.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, what opportunities there are now for young men!"
said Dalloway, for his talk had set him thinking. "I don't suppose
there's been so good an opening since the days of Pitt."</p>

<p>"And it's yours!" said Clarissa.</p>

<p>"To be a leader of men," Richard soliloquised. "It's a fine career.
My God&mdash;what a career!"</p>

<p>The chest slowly curved beneath his waistcoat.</p>

<p>"D'you know, Dick, I can't help thinking of England," said his
wife meditatively, leaning her head against his chest. "Being
on this ship seems to make it so much more vivid&mdash;what it really
means to be English. One thinks of all we've done, and our navies,
and the people in India and Africa, and how we've gone on century
after century, sending out boys from little country villages&mdash;and
of men like you, Dick, and it makes one feel as if one couldn't
bear <em>not</em> to be English! Think of the light burning over
the House, Dick! When I stood on deck just now I seemed to see
it. It's what one means by London."</p>

<p>"It's the continuity," said Richard sententiously. A vision of
English history, King following King, Prime Minister Prime Minister,
and Law Law had come over him while his wife spoke. He ran his
mind along the line of conservative policy, which went steadily
from Lord Salisbury to Alfred, and gradually enclosed, as though
it were a lasso that opened and caught things, enormous chunks
of the habitable globe.</p>

<p>"It's taken a long time, but we've pretty nearly done it," he
said; "it remains to consolidate."</p>

<p>"And these people don't see it!" Clarissa exclaimed.</p>

<p>"It takes all sorts to make a world," said her husband. "There
would never be a government if there weren't an opposition."</p>

<p>"Dick, you're better than I am," said Clarissa. "You see round,
where I only see <em>there</em>." She pressed a point on the back
of his hand.</p>

<p>"That's my business, as I tried to explain at dinner."</p>

<p>"What I like about you, Dick," she continued, "is that you're
always the same, and I'm a creature of moods."</p>

<p>"You're a pretty creature, anyhow," he said, gazing at her with
deeper eyes.</p>

<p>"You think so, do you? Then kiss me."</p>

<p>He kissed her passionately, so that her half-written letter slid
to the ground. Picking it up, he read it without asking leave.</p>

<p>"Where's your pen?" he said; and added in his little masculine
hand:</p>

<p><em>R.D. </em><em>loquitur</em>: Clarice has omitted to tell
you that she looked exceedingly pretty at dinner, and made a conquest
by which she has bound herself to learn the Greek alphabet. I
will take this occasion of adding that we are both enjoying ourselves
in these outlandish parts, and only wish for the presence of our
friends (yourself and John, to wit) to make the trip perfectly
enjoyable as it promises to be instructive. . . .</p>

<p>Voices were heard at the end of the corridor. Mrs. Ambrose was
speaking low; William Pepper was remarking in his definite and
rather acid voice, "That is the type of lady with whom I find
myself distinctly out of sympathy. She&mdash;"</p>

<p>But neither Richard nor Clarissa profited by the verdict, for
directly it seemed likely that they would overhear, Richard crackled
a sheet of paper.</p>

<p>"I often wonder," Clarissa mused in bed, over the little white
volume of Pascal which went with her everywhere, "whether it is
really good for a woman to live with a man who is morally her
superior, as Richard is mine. It makes one so dependent. I suppose
I feel for him what my mother and women of her generation felt
for Christ. It just shows that one can't do without <em>something</em>."
She then fell into a sleep, which was as usual extremely sound
and refreshing, but visited by fantastic dreams of great Greek
letters stalking round the room, when she woke up and laughed
to herself, remembering where she was and that the Greek letters
were real people, lying asleep not many yards away. Then, thinking
of the black sea outside tossing beneath the moon, she shuddered,
and thought of her husband and the others as companions on the
voyage. The dreams were not confined to her indeed, but went from
one brain to another. They all dreamt of each other that night,
as was natural, considering how thin the partitions were between
them, and how strangely they had been lifted off the earth to
sit next each other in mid-ocean, and see every detail of each
other's faces, and hear whatever they chanced to say.</p>
