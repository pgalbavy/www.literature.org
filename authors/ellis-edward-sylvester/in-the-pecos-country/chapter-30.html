<p>When they reached the camp-fire, it had burned so low that they
threw on considerable more wood before sitting down to their lunch.
As it flamed up and the cheerful light forced the oppressive gloom
back from around them, both felt a corresponding rise in spirits.</p>

<p>"It was lucky that I brought along that maat," remarked Mickey,
as he produced the venison, already cooked and prepared for the
palate. "It's a custom that Mr. Soot Simpson showed me, and I
like it very much. You note that the maat would be a great deal
better if we had some salt and pepper, or if we could keep it
a few days till it got tender; but, as it is, I think we'll worry
it down."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that I never tasted anything better," responded
Fred, "but that, I suppose, is because I become so hungry before
tasting it."</p>

<p>"Yees are right. If ye want to know how good a cup of water can
taste, go two days without drinking; or if ye want to enjoy a
good night's rest, sit up for two nights, and so, if ye want to
enjoy a nice maal of victuals, ye must fast for a day or two.
Now, I don't naad any fasting, for I always enjoyed ating from
the first pratie they giv me to suck when I was a few waaks old."</p>

<p>"Well, Mickey, you've been pretty well around the cave, and I
want to know what you think of our chance of getting out?"</p>

<p>The face of the Irishman became serious, and he looked thoughtfully
into the fire a moment before answering. Disposed as he was to
view everything from the sunshiny side, Mickey was not such a
simpleton as to consider their incarceration in the cave a matter
that could be passed off with a quirp and jest. He had explored
the interior pretty thoroughly, and gained a correct idea of their
situation, but as yet he saw no practical way of getting out.
The plan of diving down the stream, and trusting to Providence
to come up on the outside was to be the last resort.</p>

<p>Mickey did not propose to undertake it until convinced that no
other scheme was open to him. In going about the cave, he struck
the walls in the hope of finding some weak place, but they all
gave forth that dead sound which would have been heard had they
been backed up by fifty feet of solid granite. Among the many
schemes that he had turned over in his mind, none gave as little
promise as this, and he dismissed it as utterly impracticable.</p>

<p>He could conjure no way of reaching that opening above their
heads. He could not look up at that irregular, jagged opening
without thinking how easy it would be to rescue them, if they
could make their presence known to some one outside. There was
Sut Simpson, who must have learned that he had gone upon the wrong
trail, and who had, therefore, turned back to the assistance of
his former comrade.</p>

<p>The latter knew him to be a veteran of the prairie, one who could
read signs that to others were like a sealed book, and whose long
years of adventure with the tribes of the Southwest had taught
him all their tricks; but whether he would be likely to follow
the two, and to understand their predicament, was a question which
Mickey could not answer with much encouragement to himself. Still
there was a possibility of its being done, and now and then the
Irishman caught himself looking up at the "skylight," with a longing,
half-expectant gaze.</p>

<p>There were several other schemes which he was turning over in
his mind, none of which, however, had taken definite shape, and,
not wishing to discourage his young friend, he answered his question
as best he could.</p>

<p>"Well, my laddy, we're going to have a hard time to get out,
but I think we'll do it."</p>

<p>"But can you tell me how?"</p>

<p>Mickey scratched his head in his perplexed way, hardly feeling
competent to come down to particulars.</p>

<p>"I can't, exactly; I've a good many plans I'm turning over in
my head, and some of them are very fine and grand, and its hard
to pick out the right one."</p>

<p>Fred felt that he would like to hear what some of them were,
but he did not urge his friend, for he suspected that the fellow
was trying to keep their courage up.</p>

<p>They had finished their meal, and were sitting upon the sandy
soil, discussing the situation and throwing an occasional longing
look at the opening above. They had taken care to avoid getting
directly beneath it; for they had no wish to have man or animal
tumble down upon their heads. Now and then some of the gravel
loosened and rattled down, and the clear light that made its way
through the overhanging bushes showed that the sun was still shining,
and, no doubt, several hours still remained to them in which to
do any work that might present itself. But, unfortunately, nothing
remained to do.</p>

<p>Whatever were the different schemes which Mickey was turning
over in his mind, none of them was ripe enough to experiment with.
As the Irishman thought of this and that, he decided to make no
special effort until the morrow. He and Fred could remain where
they were without inconvenience for a day or two longer, but it
was necessary, too, that they should have their full strength
of body and mind when the time should come to work.</p>

<p>"Sometimes when I git into a sore puzzle," said Mickey, "and
so many beautiful and irritating plans come up before me that
I cannot find it in my heart which way to decide, I goes to slape
and drames me way through it, right straight into the right way."</p>

<p>"Did you ever find your path out of trouble?" inquired Fred.</p>

<p>"Very frequently&mdash;that is, not to say so frequently&mdash;but on one
or two important occasions. I mind the time when I was coorting
Bridget O'Flaherty and Mollie McFizzle, in the ould counthry.
Both of 'em was fine gals, and the trouble was for me to decide
which was the best as a helpmate to meself.</p>

<p>"Bridget had red hair and beautiful freckles and a turn-up nose,
and she was so fond of going round without shoes that her feet
spread out like boards; Molly was just as handsome, but her beauty
was of another style. She had very little hair upon her pad, and
a little love-pat she had wid an old beau of hers caused a broken
nose, which made her countenance quite picturesque. She was also
cross-eyed, and when she cocked one eye down at me, while she
kept a watch on the door wid the other, there was a loveliness
about her which is not often saan in the famale form."</p>

<p>"And you could n't decide which of these would make you the best
wife?"</p>

<p>"Nary a once. The attraction of both was nearly equal."</p>

<p>"But how about their housekeeping? I've often heard father tell
what a splendid housekeeper mother was, and how he would rather
have his wife a good housekeeper than beautiful."</p>

<p>"But the trouble was, I had both. I've described you the charms
and grace of each, and when I add that both were elegant housekeepers,
ye'll admit that my dilemma was greater than ever. They both handled
the broom to perfection; they could knock a chap clane across
the cabin and out of the window before ye could know what was
coming. Me mither used to say it was the housekeeping qualities
that should decide, and she told me to call upon 'em sometime
when they was n't expecting me, and obsarve the manner in which
they handled things. Wal, Bridget was the first one that I sneaked
in upon. I heard a thumping noise as I drew near, as though something
was tumbling about the floor, and when I peeped through the door,
I saw that Bridget and her mother was having a delightful love-pat.
They was banging and whaling each other round the room, and, as
the old lady had her muscle well up, it was hard to tell which
was coming out ahead. Of course, my sympathies were with the lovely
Bridget, and I was desirous that she should win&mdash;but I didn't
consider it my duty to interfere. I supposed the old lady had
been trying to impose too much work on Bridget, and, therefore,
she had rebelled, and was lambasting her for the same. My interest
in the little affair was so great, that I pushed the door ajar,
and stood with me mouth and eyes wide open. It wasn't long before
I began to get worried, for, from the way things looked, the owld
lady was getting the upper hand. I was thinking I would have to
sail in and lend a helping hand, when Bridget fotched the old
lady a whack that made her throw up the sponge. Wid that I felt
so proud that I sung out a word of encouragement, and rushed forward
to embrace my angel, but, before I could do so, she give me a
swipe that sent me backward through the door, busting it off,
and I was out of the ring.</p>

<p>"The interview was very satisfactory," continued Mickey, "and
I wint over to take a sly paap at Molly. As I drawed near the
little hut on the edge of the wood, I did n't hear any such noise
as I noticed over at Bridget's house. All was as still as it is
here this minute. Me first thought was that they all had gone
away, but when I got nearer, I noted my mistake. Molly's mother
was busy sewing, and sitting near her was her charming daughter
Molly, leaning back in her chair, with her head thrown still further
back, her mouth wide open, and she a-snoring. I've no doubt that
she had become exhausted from overwork, and was taking a little
nap. The mother looked up as I stepped softly in, and I axed her,
in an undertone, how long her pet child had been asleep. She said
between two or three hours, and that she would wake her up, if
Molly hadn't told her before closing her eyes that if she dared
to disturb her before her nap was finished, she'd break the old
lady's head. Knowing the delicate relations that existed betwaan
us, she suggested that I should arouse her, she being afraid that
she would sleep so long that she would starve to death before
she awoke. I wanted to come at the matter gintly, so I took a
straw and tickled Molly's nose. She snorted a little, and rubbed
it with her fist, but didn't open her eyes. I'd undertook the
job, however, and I was bound to do it, or die. So I wiggled at
her nostrils, and she made a yell and a jump, and was wide awake.
I don't mind me all that took place just then. Things was kind
of confused, and, when Molly lit on me, I thought the cabin had
tumbled in. My senses came back arter a while, and when I got
my head bandaged up, I wint home to dream over it."</p>

<p>"And what was your dream?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"In my slumbers, I saw both my loves going for each other like
a couple of Kilkenny cats, until there was nothing of aither lift.
I took that as a sign that naither of 'em was interested for me,
and so I give them up, sneaking off and sailing for Ameriky before
they learned my intintions."</p>
