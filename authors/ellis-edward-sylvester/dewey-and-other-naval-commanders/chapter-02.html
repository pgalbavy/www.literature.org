<p>No one needs to be reminded that the War for the Union was the
greatest struggle of modern times. The task of bringing back to
their allegiance those who had risen against the authority of
the National Government was a gigantic one, and taxed the courage
and resources of the country to the utmost. In order to make the
war effective, it was necessary to enforce a rigorous blockade
over three thousand miles of seacoast, open the Mississippi river,
and overcome the large and well-officered armies in the field.
The last was committed to the land forces, and it proved an exhausting
and wearying struggle.</p>

<p>Among the most important steps was the second&mdash;that of opening
the Mississippi, which being accomplished, the Southwest, from
which the Confederacy drew its immense supplies of cattle, would
be cut off and a serious blow struck against the armed rebellion.</p>

<p>The river was sealed from Vicksburg to the Gulf of Mexico. At
the former place extensive batteries had been erected and were
defended by an army, while the river below bristled with batteries
and guns in charge of brave men and skilful officers.</p>

<p>While General Grant undertook the task of reducing Vicksburg,
Captain Farragut assumed the herculean work of forcing his way
up the Mississippi and capturing New Orleans, the greatest commercial
city in the South. Knowing that such an attack was certain to
be made, the Confederates had neglected no precaution in the way
of defence. Ninety miles below the city, and twenty miles above
its mouth, at the Plaquemine Bend, were the forts of St. Philip
and Jackson. The former, on the left bank, had forty-two heavy
guns, including two mortars and a battery of four seacoast mortars,
placed below the water battery. Fort Jackson, besides its water
battery, mounted sixty-two guns, while above the forts were fourteen
vessels, including the ironclad ram <em>Manassas</em>, and a partially
completed floating battery, armored with railroad iron and called
the <em>Louisiana</em>. New Orleans was defended by three thousand
volunteers, most of the troops formerly there having been sent
to the Confederate army in Tennessee.</p>

<p>The expedition against New Orleans was prepared with great care,
and so many months were occupied that the enemy had all the notice
they could ask in which to complete their preparations for its
defence. The Union expedition consisted of six sloops of war,
sixteen gunboats, twenty mortar schooners and five other vessels.
The <em>Mississippi</em>, upon which young Dewey was serving as
a lieutenant, was under the command of Melanethon Smith. The land
troops numbered 15,000, and were in charge of General Benjamin
F. Butler, of Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Farragut arrived in February, 1862, nearly two months after the
beginning of preparations to force the river. When everything
was in readiness the fleet moved cautiously up stream, on April
18, and a bombardment of Forts St. Philip and Jackson was opened,
which lasted for three days, without accomplishing anything decisive.
Farragut had carefully studied the situation, and, confident that
the passage could be made, determined it should be done, no matter
at what cost. On the night of the 23d his vessels were stripped
of every rope and spar that could be spared, the masts and rigging
of the gunboats and mortar vessels being trimmed with the limbs
of trees, to conceal their identity from the Confederate watchers.</p>

<p>At two o'clock in the morning the signal was hoisted on the <em>Hartford</em>,
Captain Farragut's flagship, and the fleet started in single line
to run the fearful gauntlet. The <em>Cayuga</em> led, the <em>Pensacola</em>
followed, and the <em>Mississippi</em> was third. The rebels had
huge bonfires burning on both shores, and as the <em>Pensacola</em>
came opposite the forts they opened their furious fire upon her.</p>

<p>A good deal of uneasiness prevailed in the Union fleet regarding
the rebel rams. It was known they were formidable monsters, which
the Confederates believed could smash and sink the whole Union
squadron. While it was known that much was to be feared from the
forts, it was the ironclads that formed the uncertain factor and
magnified the real danger in many men's minds.</p>

<p>The <em>Mississippi</em> was hardly abreast of Fort St. Philip
when the dreaded <em>Manassas</em> came plunging down the river
out of the gloom at full speed, and headed directly for the <em>Mississippi.</em>
She was not seen until so close that it was impossible to dodge
her, and the ironclad struck the steamer on the port side, close
to the mizzenmast, firing a gun at the same time. Fortunately
the blow was a glancing one, though it opened a rent seven feet
long and four inches deep in the steamer, which, being caught
by the swift current on her starboard bow, was swept across to
the Fort Jackson side of the river, so close indeed that her gunners
and those in the fort exchanged curses and imprecations.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>SHELLING FORTS PHILIP AND JACKSON</em>.]</p>

<p>The passage of the forts by the Union vessels forms one of the
most thrilling pictures in the history of the Civil War. The <em>Hartford</em>,
like all the vessels, was subjected to a terrible fire, was assailed
by the Confederate ironclads, and more than once was in imminent
danger of being sent to the bottom. Following with the second
division, Captain Farragut did not reply to the fire of the forts
for a quarter of an hour. He hurled a broadside into St. Philip
and was pushing through the dense smoke when a fire-raft, with
a tug pushing her along, plunged out of the gloom toward the <em>Hartford's</em>
port quarter. She swerved to elude this peril and ran aground
close to St. Philip, which, recognizing her three ensigns and
flag officer's flag, opened a savage fire, but luckily most of
the shot passed too high.</p>

<p>There was no getting out of the way of the fire-raft, which,
being jammed against the flagship, sent the flames through the
portholes and up the oiled masts. The perfect discipline of the
crew enabled them to extinguish the fire before it could do much
damage, and the <em>Hartford</em> succeeded in backing into deep
water and kept pounding Fort St. Philip so long as she was in
range.</p>

<p>Without attempting to describe the battle in detail, we will
give our attention to the <em>Mississippi</em>. Within an hour
and a quarter of the time the leading vessel passed the forts,
all had reached a safe point above, where they engaged in a furious
fight with the Confederate flotilla, the smaller members of which
were soon disabled or sunk.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE "HARTFORD" &</em>mdash;<em>FARRAGUT'S
FLAGSHIP</em>.]</p>

<p>Meanwhile the ironclad <em>Manassas</em> had been prowling at
the heels of the Union squadron, but being discovered by the <em>Mississippi</em>,
the steamer opened on her with so destructive a fire that the
ram ran ashore and the crew scrambled over the bows and escaped.
The <em>Mississippi</em> continued pounding her until she was
completely wrecked. The loss of the Union fleet was thirty-seven
killed and one hundred and forty-seven wounded, while the Confederate
land forces had twelve killed and forty wounded. The Confederate
flotilla must have lost as many men as the Unionists. Having safely
passed all obstructions, Captain Farragut steamed up to the river
to New Orleans, and the city surrendered April 25, formal possession
being taken on May 1.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that Lieutenant Dewey had received his "baptism
of fire."</p>

<p>It is the testimony of every one who saw him during the turmoil
of battle that he conducted himself with the coolness and courage
of a veteran. At no time during the passage of the forts and the
desperate fighting with the Confederate flotilla above did he
display the first evidence of nervousness or lack of self-possession.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>IRONCLADS ON THE MISSISSIPPI</em>.]</p>

<p>The next engagement in which Lieutenant Dewey took part was the
attempt by Farragut to pass the battery of nineteen guns, mounted
on the hundred-foot high bluff of Port Hudson, on a bend of the
Mississippi, below Vicksburg. The position was the most difficult
conceivable to carry from the river, because of the plunging shots
from the enormous guns on the bluff above.</p>

<p>Captain Farragut had no thought of reducing these batteries,
which would have been impossible with a fleet double the strength
of his, but he wished to get his vessels past in order to blockade
the river above the bend. The attempt was made on the night of
March 14, 1863, with the <em>Hartford</em> in the lead, and followed
by the <em>Richmond</em>, <em>Monongahela</em> and <em>Mississippi</em>,
with the smaller boats. The first three boats had as consorts
the <em>Albatross</em>, <em>Kineo</em> and <em>Genessee</em>.
Captain Mahan, in "The Gulf and Inland Waters," gives the following
vivid description of this historical incident:</p>

<p>"As they drew near the batteries, the lowest of which the <em>Hartford</em>
had already passed, the enemy threw up rockets and opened their
fire. Prudence, and the fact of the best water being on the starboard
hand, led the ships to hug the east shore of the river, passing
so close under the Confederate guns that the speech of the gunners
and troops could be distinguished. Along the shore, at the foot
of the bluffs, powerful reflecting lamps, like those used on locomotives,
had been placed to show the ships to the enemy as they passed,
and for the same purpose large fires, already stacked on the opposite
point, were lit. The fire of the fleet and from the shore soon
raised a smoke which made these precautions useless, while it
involved the ships in a danger greater than any from the enemy's
guns. Settling down upon the water in a still, damp atmosphere,
it soon hid everything from the eyes of the pilots. The flagship
leading had the advantage of pushing often ahead of her own smoke;
but those who followed ran into it and incurred a perplexity which
increased from van to rear. At the bend of the river the current
caught the <em>Hartford</em> on her port bow, sweeping her around
with her head toward the batteries, and nearly on shore, her stern
touching the ground slightly; but by her own efforts and the assistance
of the <em>Albatross</em> she was backed clear. Then, the <em>Albatross</em>
backing and the <em>Hartford</em> going ahead strong with the
engine, her head was fairly pointed up the stream, and she passed
by without serious injury. Deceived possibly by the report of
the howitzers in her top, which were nearly on their own level,
the Confederates did not depress their guns sufficiently to hit
her as often as they did the ships that followed her. One killed
and two wounded is her report; and one marine fell overboard,
his cries for help being heard on board the other ships as they
passed by, unable to save him."</p>

<p>If the capture of the batteries was impossible, their passage
was almost equally so. The <em>Richmond</em> was so badly injured
that she was compelled to turn down stream, having suffered a
loss of three killed and fifteen wounded, while the <em>Monongahela</em>
had six killed and twenty-one wounded before she was able to wrench
herself loose from where she had grounded and drift out of range.</p>

<p>Now came the <em>Mississippi</em>, whose tragic fate is graphically
told by Admiral Porter in his "Naval History of the Civil War":</p>

<p>"The steamship <em>Mississippi</em>, Captain Melancthon Smith,
followed in the wake of the <em>Monongahela</em>, firing whenever
her guns could be brought to bear. At 11:30 o'clock she reached
the turn which seemed to give our vessels so much trouble, and
Captain Smith was congratulating himself on the prospect of soon
catching up with the flag officer, when his ship grounded and
heeled over three streaks to port.</p>

<p>"The engines were instantly reversed and the port guns run in
in order to bring her on an even keel, while the fire from her
starboard battery was reopened on the forts. The engines were
backed with all the steam that could be put upon them, and the
backing was continued for thirty minutes, but without avail.</p>

<p>"It was now seen that it would be impossible to get the ship
afloat.</p>

<p>"Captain Smith gave orders to spike the port battery and throw
the guns overboard, but it was not done, for the enemy's fire
was becoming so rapid and severe that the Captain deemed it judicious
to abandon the ship at once in order to save the lives of the
men.</p>

<p>"While preparations were being made to destroy the ship, the
sick and wounded were lowered into boats and conveyed ashore,
while the men at the starboard battery continued to fight in splendid
style, firing at every flash of the enemy's guns. The small arms
were thrown overboard, and all possible damage was done to the
engine and everything else that might prove of use to the enemy.</p>

<p>"The ship was first set on fire in the forward storeroom, but
three shots came through below her water-line and put out the
flames. She was then set afire in four places aft, and when the
flames were well under way, so as to make her destruction certain,
Captain Smith and his first lieutenant (George Dewey) left the
ship, all the officers and crew having been landed before.</p>

<p>"The <em>Mississippi</em> was soon ablaze fore and aft, and as
she was now relieved of a great deal of weight&mdash;by the removal
of her crew and the destruction of her upper works&mdash;she floated
off the bank and drifted down the river, much to the danger of
the Union vessels below. But she passed without doing them any
injury, and at 5:30 o'clock blew up and went to the bottom."</p>

<p>When the time came for the crew to save themselves as best they
could, all sprang overboard and struck out for shore. A little
way from the blazing steamer a poor sailor was struggling hard
to save himself, but one arm was palsied from a wound, and he
must have drowned but for Dewey, who swam powerfully to him, helped
him to a floating piece of wreckage and towed him safely to land.</p>

<p>The lieutenant was now transferred to one of the gunboats of
Admiral Farragut's squadron and engaged in patrol duty between
Cairo and Vicksburg.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>GUNBOATS PASSING BEFORE VICKSBURG</em>.]</p>

<p>The latter surrendered to General Grant July 4, 1863, and the
river was opened from its source to the Gulf. Early in 1864 the
lieutenant was made executive officer of the gunboat <em>Agawam</em>,
and when attached to the North Atlantic squadron, took part in
the attack on Fort Fisher, one of the strongest of forts, which,
standing at the entrance of Cape Fear river, was so efficient
a protection to Wilmington that the city became the chief port
in the Confederacy for blockade runners. Indeed, its blockade
was a nullity, despite the most determined efforts of the Union
fleet to keep it closed. The Confederate cruisers advertised their
regular days for departure, and they ran upon schedule time, even
women and children taking passage upon the swift steamers with
scarcely a fear that they would not be able to steam in and out
of the river whenever the navigators of the craft chose to do
so.</p>

<p>The first attempt against Fort Fisher was in the latter part
of December, 1864, but, though the fleet was numerous and powerful,
and the greatest gallantry was displayed, the attack was unsuccessful.
General Butler, in command of the land troops, after a careful
examination of the Confederate works, pronounced capture impossible
and refused to sacrifice his men in a useless attack. Nevertheless
the attempt was renewed January 12, when General Alfred Terry
had charge of the land forces. The garrison made one of the bravest
defences of the whole war, and the hand-to-hand fight was of the
most furious character. It lasted for five hours, when the fort
was obliged to surrender, the garrison of 2,300 men becoming prisoners
of war. It was in this fearful struggle that Ensign "Bob" Evans,
who was with the naval force that charged up the unprotected beach,
was so frightfully wounded that it was believed he could not live.
When the surgeon made ready to amputate his shattered leg, Bob,
who had secured possession of a loaded revolver, swore he would
shoot any man who touched the limb with such purpose. Perforce
he was left alone, and in due time fully recovered, though lamed
for life.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Dewey was one of the most active of the young officers
in the attack on Fort Fisher, and conducted himself with so much
bravery and skill, executing one of the most difficult and dangerous
movements in the heat of the conflict, that he was highly complimented
by his superior officers.</p>

<p>But peace soon came, and a generation was to pass before his
name was again associated with naval exploits. In March, 1865,
he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-commander and assigned
to duty on the <em>Kearsarge</em>, the vessel that acquired undying
glory for sinking the <em>Alabama</em>, off Cherbourg, France,
during the previous July. Early in 1867 he was ordered home from
the European station and assigned to duty at the Kittery Navy
Yard, at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.</p>

<p>While at this station he became acquainted with Miss Susan B.
Goodwin, daughter of the "war Governor" of New Hampshire. She
was an accomplished young woman, to whom the naval officer was
married, October 24, 1867. Their all too brief wedded life was
ideally happy, but she died December 28, 1872, a few days after
the birth of a son, named George Goodwin, in honor of his grandfather.</p>

<p>From 1873 to 1876 Dewey was engaged in making surveys on the
Pacific coast; he commanded the <em>Juniata</em> on the Asiatic
squadron in 1882-83, and the following year was made captain and
placed in charge of the <em>Dolphin</em>, one of the original
"white squadron." Next came service in Washington as Chief of
the Bureau of Equipment and Recruiting, as member of the Lighthouse
Board and president of the Board of Inspection and Survey (he
being made commodore February 28, 1896), until 1897, when he was
placed in command of the Asiatic squadron, much against his will.</p>
