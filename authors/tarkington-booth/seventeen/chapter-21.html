<p>When George did stop, it was abruptly, during one of these intervals
of sobriety, and he and Miss Pratt came out of the house together
rather quietly, joining one of the groups of young people chatting
with after-dinner languor under the trees. However, Mr. Crooper
began to revive presently, in the sweet air of outdoors, and,
observing some of the more flashing gentlemen lighting cigarettes,
he was moved to laughter. He had not smoked since his childhood&mdash;having
then been bonded through to twenty-one with a pledge of gold&mdash;and
he feared that these smoking youths might feel themselves superior.
Worse, Miss Pratt might be impressed, therefore he laughed in
scorn, saying:</p>

<p>"Burnin' up ole trash around here, I expect!" He sniffed searchingly.
"Somebody's set some ole rags on fire." Then, as in discovery,
he cried, "Oh no, only cigarettes!"</p>

<p>Miss Pratt, that tactful girl, counted four smokers in the group
about her, and only one abstainer, George. She at once defended
the smokers, for it is to be feared that numbers always had weight
with her. "Oh, but cigarettes is lubly smell!" she said. "Untle
Georgiecums maybe be too 'ittle boy for smokings!"</p>

<p>This archness was greeted loudly by the smokers, and Mr. Crooper
was put upon his mettle. He spoke too quickly to consider whether
or no the facts justified his assertion. "Me? I don't smoke paper
and ole carpets. I smoke cigars!"</p>

<p>He had created the right impression, for Miss Pratt clapped her
hands. "Oh, 'plendid! Light one, Untle Georgiecums! Light one
ever 'n' ever so quick! P'eshus Flopit an' me we want see dray,
big, 'normous man smoke dray, big, 'normous cigar!"</p>

<p>William and Johnnie Watson, who had been hovering morbidly, unable
to resist the lodestone, came nearer, Johnnie being just in time
to hear his cousin's reply.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I forgot my cigar-case."</p>

<p>Johnnie's expression became one of biting skepticism. "What you
talkin' about, George? Didn't you promise Uncle George you'd never
smoke till you're of age, and Uncle George said he'd give you
a thousand dollars on your twenty-first birthday? What 'd you
say about your 'cigar-case'?"</p>

<p>George felt that he was in a tight place, and the lovely eyes
of Miss Pratt turned upon him questioningly. He could not flush,
for he was already so pink after his exploits with unnecessary
nutriment that more pinkness was impossible. He saw that the only
safety for him lay in boisterous prevarication. "A thousand dollars!"
he laughed loudly. "I thought that was real money when I was ten
years old! It didn't stand in MY way very long, I guess! Good
ole George wanted his smoke, and he went after it! You know how
I am, Johnnie, when I go after anything. I been smokin' cigars
I dunno how long!" Glancing about him, his eye became reassured;
it was obvious that even Johnnie had accepted this airy statement
as the truth, and to clinch plausibility he added: "When I smoke,
I smoke! I smoke cigars straight along&mdash;light one right on the
stub of the other. I only wish I had some with me, because I miss
'em after a meal. I'd give a good deal for something to smoke
right now! I don't mean cigarettes; I don't want any paper &mdash;I
want something that's all tobacco!"</p>

<p>William's pale, sad face showed a hint of color. With a pang
he remembered the package of My Little Sweetheart All-Tobacco
Cuban Cigarettes (the Package of Twenty for Ten Cents) which still
reposed, untouched, in the breast pocket of his coat. His eyes
smarted a little as he recalled the thoughts and hopes that had
accompanied the purchase; but he thought, "What would Sydney Carton
do?"</p>

<p>William brought forth the package of My Little Sweetheart All-Tobacco
Cuban Cigarettes and placed it in the large hand of George Crooper.
And this was a noble act, for William believed that George really
wished to smoke. "Here," he said, "take these; they're all tobacco.
I'm goin' to quit smokin', anyway." And, thinking of the name,
he added, gently, with a significance lost upon all his hearers,
"I'm sure you ought to have 'em instead of me."</p>

<p>Then he went away and sat alone upon the fence.</p>

<p>"Light one, light one!" cried Miss Pratt. "Ev'ybody mus' be happy,
an' dray, big, 'normous man tan't be happy 'less he have his all-tobatto
smote. Light it, light it!"</p>

<p>George drew as deep a breath as his diaphragm, strangely oppressed
since dinner, would permit, and then bravely lit a Little Sweetheart.
There must have been some valiant blood in him, for, as he exhaled
the smoke, he covered a slight choking by exclaiming, loudly:
"<em>THAT'S </em>good! That's the ole stuff! That's what I was
lookin' for!"</p>

<p>Miss Pratt was entranced. "Oh, 'plendid!" she cried, watching
him with fascinated eyes. "Now take dray, big, 'normous puffs!
Take dray, big, '<em>NORMOUS </em>puffs!"</p>

<p>George took great, big, enormous puffs.</p>

<p>She declared that she loved to watch men smoke, and William's
heart, as he sat on the distant fence, was wrung and wrung again
by the vision of her playful ecstasies. But when he saw her holding
what was left of the first Little Sweetheart for George to light
a second at its expiring spark, he could not bear it. He dropped
from the fence and moped away to be out of sight once more. This
was his darkest hour.</p>

<p>Studiously avoiding the vicinity of the smokehouse, he sought
the little orchard where he had beheld her sitting with George;
and there he sat himself in sorrowful reverie upon the selfsame
fallen tree. How long he remained there is uncertain, but he was
roused by the sound of music which came from the lawn before the
farmhouse. Bitterly he smiled, remembering that Wallace Banks
had engaged Italians with harp, violin, and flute, promising great
things for dancing on a fresh-clipped lawn&mdash;a turf floor being
no impediment to seventeen's dancing. Music! To see her whirling
and smiling sunnily in the fat grasp of that dancing bear! He
would stay in this lonely orchard; <em>SHE </em>would not miss
him.</p>

<p>But though he hated the throbbing music and the sound of the
laughing voices that came to him, he could not keep away&mdash;and
when he reached the lawn where the dancers were, he found Miss
Pratt moving rhythmically in the thin grasp of Wallace Banks.
Johnnie Watson approached, and spoke in a low tone, tinged with
spiteful triumph.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, ole fat George didn't get the first dance with
her! She's the guest of honor, and Wallace had a right to it because
he did all the work. He came up to 'em and ole fat George couldn't
say a thing. Wallace just took her right away from him. George
didn't say anything at all, but I s'pose after this dance he'll
be rushin' around again and nobody else 'll have a chance to get
near her the rest of the afternoon. My mother told me I ought
to invite him over here, out I had no business to do it; he don't
know the first principles of how to act in a town he don't live
in!"</p>

<p>"Where'd he go?" William asked, listlessly, for Mr. Crooper was
nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;he just walked off without sayin' anything. But
he'll be back, time this dance is over, never you fear, and he'll
grab her again and &mdash;What's the matter with Joe?"</p>

<p>Joseph Bullitt had made his appearance at a corner of the house,
some distance from where they stood. His face was alert under
the impulse of strong excitement, and he beckoned fiercely. "Come
here!" And, when they had obeyed, "He's around back of the house
by a kind of shed," said Joe. "I think something's wrong. Come
on, I'll show him to you."</p>

<p>But behind the house, whither they followed him in vague, strange
hope, he checked them. "<em>LOOK THERE!" </em>he said.</p>

<p>His pointing finger was not needed. Sounds of paroxysm drew their
attention sufficiently&mdash;sounds most poignant, soul-rending, and
lugubrious. William and Johnnie perceived the large person of
Mr. Crooper; he was seated upon the ground, his back propped obliquely
against the smoke-house, though this attitude was not maintained
constantly.</p>

<p>Facing him, at a little distance, a rugged figure in homely garments
stood leaning upon a hoe and regarding George with a cold interest.
The apex of this figure was a volcanic straw hat, triangular in
profile and coned with an open crater emitting reddish wisps,
while below the hat were several features, but more whiskers,
at the top of a long, corrugated red neck of sterling worth. A
husky voice issued from the whiskers, addressing George.</p>

<p>"I seen you!" it said. "I seen you eatin'! This here farm is
supposed to be a sanitary farm, and you'd ought of knew better.
Go it, doggone you! Go it!"</p>

<p>George complied. And three spectators, remaining aloof, but watching
zealously, began to feel their lost faith in Providence returning
into them; their faces brightened slowly, and without relapse.
It was a visible thing how the world became fairer and better
in their eyes during that little while they stood there. And William
saw that his Little Sweethearts had been an inspired purchase,
after all; they had delivered the final tap upon a tottering edifice.
George's deeds at dinner had unsettled, but Little Sweethearts
had overthrown&mdash;and now there was awful work among the ruins,
to an ironical accompaniment of music from the front yard, where
people danced in heaven's sunshine!</p>

<p>This accompaniment came to a stop, and Johnnie Watson jumped.
He seized each of his companions by a sleeve and spoke eagerly,
his eyes glowing with a warm and brotherly light. "Here!" he cried.
"We better get around there&mdash;this looks like it was goin' to last
all afternoon. Joe, you get the next dance with her, and just
about time the music slows up you dance her around so you can
stop right near where Bill will be standin', so Bill can get her
quick for the dance after that. Then, Bill, you do the same for
me, and I'll do the same for Joe again, and then, Joe, you do
it for Bill again, and then Bill for me&mdash;and so on. If we go in
right now and work together we can crowd the rest out, and there
won't anybody else get to dance with her the whole day! Come on
quick!"</p>

<p>United in purpose, the three ran lightly to the dancing-lawn,
and Mr. Bullitt was successful, after a little debate, in obtaining
the next dance with the lovely guest of the day. "I did promise
big Untle Georgiecums," she said, looking about her.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't think he'll come," said Joe. "That is, I'm pretty
sure he won't."</p>

<p>A shade fell upon the exquisite face. "No'ty. Bruvva Josie-Joe!
The Men <em>ALWAYS </em>tum when Lola promises dances. Mustn't
be rude!"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;" Joe began, when he was interrupted by the Swedish lady
named Anna, who spoke to them from the steps of the house. Of
the merrymakers they were the nearest.</p>

<p>"Dot pick fella," said Anna, "dot one dot eats&mdash;we make him in
a petroom. He holler! He tank he neet some halp."</p>

<p>"Does he want a doctor?" Joe asked.</p>

<p>"Doctor? No! He want make him in a amyoulance for hospital!"</p>

<p>"I'll go look at him," Johnnie Watson volunteered, running up.
"He's my cousin, and I guess I got to take the responsibility."</p>

<p>Miss Pratt paid the invalid the tribute of one faintly commiserating
glance toward the house. "Well," she said, "if people would rather
eat too much than dance!" She meant "dance with ME!" though she
thought it prettier not to say so. "Come on, Bruvva Josie-Joe!"
she cried, joyously.</p>

<p>And a little later Johnnie Watson approached her where she stood
with a restored and refulgent William, about to begin the succeeding
dance. Johnnie dropped into her hand a ring, receiving one in
return. "I thought I better <em>GET </em>it," he said, offering
no further explanation. "I'll take care of his until we get home.
He's all right," said Johnnie, and then perceiving a sudden advent
of apprehension upon the sensitive brow of William, he went on
reassuringly: "He's doin' as well as anybody could expect; that
is&mdash;after the crazy way he <em>DID! </em>He's always been considered
the dumbest one in all our relations&mdash;never did know how to act.
I don't mean he's exactly not got his senses, or ought to be watched,
anything like that&mdash;and of course he belongs to an awful good
family&mdash;but he's just kind of the black sheep when it comes to
intelligence, or anything like that. I got him as comfortable
as a person could be, and they're givin' him hot water and mustard
and stuff, but what he needs now is just to be kind of quiet.
It'll do him a lot o' good," Johnnie concluded, with a spark in
his voice, "to lay there the rest of the afternoon and get quieted
down, kind of."</p>

<p>"You don't think there's any&mdash;" William began, and, after a pause,
continued&mdash;"any hope&mdash;of his getting strong enough to come out
and dance afterwhile?"</p>

<p>Johnnie shook his head. "None in the world!" he said, conclusively.
"The best we can do for him is to let him entirely alone till
after supper, and then ask nobody to sit on the back seat of the
trolley-car goin' home, so we can make him comfortable back there,
and let him kind of stretch out by himself."</p>

<p>Then gaily tinkled harp, gaily sang flute and violin! Over the
greensward William lightly bore his lady, while radiant was the
cleared sky above the happy dancers. William's fingers touched
those delicate fingers; the exquisite face smiled rosily up to
him; undreamable sweetness beat rhythmically upon his glowing
ears; his feet moved in a rhapsody of companionship with hers.
They danced and danced and danced!</p>

<p>Then Joe danced with her, while William and Johnnie stood with
hands upon each other's shoulders and watched, mayhap with longing,
but without spite; then Johnnie danced with her while Joe and
William watched&mdash;and then William danced with her again.</p>

<p>So passed the long, ineffable afternoon away&mdash;ah, Seventeen!</p>

<p>"... 'Jav a good time at the trolley-party?" the clerk in the
corner drug-store inquired that evening.</p>

<p>"Fine!" said William, taking his overcoat from the hook where
he had left it.</p>

<p>"How j' like them Little Sweethearts I sold you?"</p>

<p>"<em>FINE!" </em>said William.</p>
