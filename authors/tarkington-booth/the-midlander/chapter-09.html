<p><em>NOT </em>long ago there was found everywhere in the Midland
country a kind of wood then most characteristic of it but now
almost disappeared, a vanishment not inexpressive of nature’s
way of striking chords; for the wood is no longer so like the
Midlands as it was. But in the days when Ornaby Addition struggled
in embryo, hickory still grew in profusion, and that tough and
seasoned old sample of it, Mr. Shelby, withstood at his office
desk the hottest summer in several years. He permitted himself
the alleviation of a palm-leaf fan, and when his open carriage
came for him at a little before six o’clock, every afternoon,
he had the elderly negro coachman drive him out to the end of
the cedar-block pavement of Amberson Boulevard before going home;
but on the day that began the hottest hot spell of the summer
he forebore to indulge himself with this excursion, albeit he
forebore somewhat peevishly.</p>

<p>"We got to go straight home this evening, Jim," he said, and
added, "Plague take it!"</p>

<p>"Yes, suh," the coachman assented. "She lay it down she want
me ca’y you home quick as I kin git you. I tell ’er bettuh not
be <em>too</em> quick or I’m goin’ have me two nice dead trottin’
hosses. Hoss die same as a man, day like this, an’ it ain’t cool
off airy bit sense noon. Look to me like gittin’ hottuh, ’stid
o’ simmerin’ down some, way ought to!" He widened one fat brown
cheek in a slight distortion, producing a sound not vocal, but
correctly interpreted by the horses as the call for an advance.
Then, as they obediently set off at a trot, he chuckled; for although
he complained of the heat he really liked it; and was not ill-equipped
for it in shapeless linen, a straw hat, and slippers. "Tell me
be’n five six whi’ men drop down dade right out in a middle the
sidewalk to-day," he said. "Way it keepin’ up, they be mo’ of
’em befo’ mawnin’. Look at them hosses bustin’ out an’ lathun
theyse’f a’ready, an’ I ain’t trot ’em a full square yit!"</p>

<p>"You needn’t push ’em on my account," Mr. Shelby said, "<em>I</em>’m
not in any hurry."</p>

<p>"No, suh," the coloured man agreed, smiling over some private
thought of his own. "I guess you ain’t! But she said, hot or no
hot, git you home early’s I could fix it." And then he laughed
outright.</p>

<p>"Plague take it!" Mr. Shelby said again; for what amused the
coachman made the master all the more peevish. Unquestionably,
he was a deeply annoyed old gentleman, in spite of the fact that
he was the coolest looking human being up and down the full length
of National Avenue, into which thoroughfare the carriage had turned.</p>

<p>The long avenue might well have been mistaken for a colony of
invalids and listless convalescents. Damp and languid citizens,
their coats over bared forearms, made their painful way homeward
from downtown, mopping fiery brows and throats; other coatless
citizens, arrived at home, reclined melting in wicker rocking-chairs
upon their verandas or lawns, likewise mopping as they melted;
while beside them their wives and daughters, in flimsiest white,
sat fanning plaintively. Here and there the stout father of a
family stood near his front fence and played a weak and tepid
stream from the garden hose over his lawn, or sprinkled the street,
while his children, too hot to be importunate, begged lifelessly
to relieve him of the task. The leaves of the massed foliage that
made the street a green tunnel hung flaccidly gilding in the sun;
and the sun abated not at all as it approached its setting. The
air drooped upon the people with a weight too heavy to let them
move readily, yet for breathing there seemed to be no air; and
it had no motion, so that the transparent bits of paper, where
the popcorn man or the hokey-pokey man had passed, lay in the
street and on the sidewalks as still as so much lead.</p>

<p>"Seem like ev’thing wilted down flat," Mr. Shelby’s fat coachman
remarked as they turned into the driveway at home. "Me, I reckon
if you’s to take little slim string o’ cobweb up on the roof an’
push ’er off, she’d fall ri’ down on the groun’ same as a flatiron.
Look fountain, Mist’ Shelby!" He laughed happily, and waved his
whip toward the bronze swan. "That duck, let alone he ain’t got
stren’f ’nough to spout, he ain’t but jes’ hodly able to goggle
his th’oat little bit."</p>

<p>The swan was indeed put to it to eject a faint spray, for all
over the town the people were making such demands on the water,
already low with the dry season, that the depleted river whence
it came threatened to disappear unless the drought were broken.
However, neither drought nor heat had to do with Mr. Shelby’s
peevishness, which visibly increased when the carriage turned
into his driveway;—what made him frown so bitterly was the sight
of his daughter, charmingly dressed in fabrics of gossamer weight,
her shapely hands gloved in spite of the weather, and her hazel
eyes bright under a hat of ivory lace. She was sitting upon a
wicker bench on the big veranda, but when the lathered bay horses
trotted through the driveway gate, she jumped up and hurried to
meet her father as he stepped out upon a stone horseblock near
the veranda steps.</p>

<p>"Papa!" she cried, "you must hurry; we’re terribly late! I wouldn’t
have waited for you, but I was afraid you wouldn’t go unless I
took you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t," he said grimly. "You bet your sweet life I wouldn’t!"</p>

<p>"<em>Won’t</em> you hurry?" she urged.</p>

<p>"What for? Ain’t I dressed up enough? All I’m goin’ to do is
wash my hands."</p>

<p>"Then do," she cried, as he moved to go indoors. "<em>Please</em>
hurry!"</p>

<p>"Never you mind," he returned crossly. "I don’t usually take
more’n half a jiffy to just wash my hands, thank you!" And as
he disappeared he was heard to mutter, not without vehemence:
"Plague take it!"</p>

<p>A few moments later he reappeared, not visibly altered except
that his irritated expression had become one of revolt. "Look
a-here!" he said. "I don’t see as <em>I</em>’m called upon to
promenade over there and join in with all this high jinks and
goin’s-on!"</p>

<p>"Papa——"</p>

<p>"I don’t mind an old-fashioned party," he went on. "I used to
go to plenty of ’em in my time, but when all they got for you
to do is listen to half the women in town tryin’ to out-holler
each other, why, you bet your bottom dollar I’m through!"</p>

<p>"But, papa——"</p>

<p>"No, sir-ree!" he protested loudly. "You can well as not go on
over there without me. Why, just look at the crowd they got in
there already."</p>

<p>He waved his hand to the neighbouring domain on the south, where
the crowd he bitterly mentioned was not in sight, but was indicated
by external manifestations. Open family carriages, surreys, runabouts,
phaetons, and "station wagons" filled the Oliphants’ driveway,
and, for a hundred yards or more, were drawn up to the curb on
each side of the avenue. Coloured drivers sat at leisure, gossiping
from one vehicle to another, or shouting over jokes about the
hot weather. The horses drooped, or, with heads tossing at intervals,
protested against their check-reins—and one of them, detained
in position by a strap fastened to a portable iron weight, alternately
backed and advanced with such persistence that he now and then
produced enough commotion to bring profane bellows of reproof
from the drivers, after which he would subside momentarily, then
misbehave again.</p>

<p>One of the coachmen decided to settle the matter, and, sliding
to the ground from the hot leather front cushion of a "two-horse
surrey", went to chide the nervous animal. "Look a-me, hoss!"
the man shouted fiercely. "You gone spoil ev’ybody’s pleasure.
Whyn’t you behave youse’f an’ listen to music?" He pointed eloquently
to the Oliphants’ open windows, whence came the sound of violins,
a harp and a flute. "You git a chance listen nice music when you
stan’ all day in you’ stall, hoss? An’ look at all them dressed-up
white folks goin’ junketin’. What they goin’ think about you,
you keep on ackin’ a fool?" Here, to clarify his meaning to the
disturber, he gestured toward some young people—girls in pretty
summer flimsies and young men in white flannels—who were going
in through the iron gateway. "You think anybody goin’ respect
you, cuttin’ up that fool way? You look out, hoss, you look out!
You back into my surrey ag’in I’m goin’ take an’ smack you so’s
you won’t fergit it long’s you live!"</p>

<p>Mr. Shelby, becoming more obdurate on his veranda, found this
altercation helpful to his argument. "Why, just listen! That crowd’s
makin’ so much noise I’d lose my hearin’ if I went in there. I
won’t do it!"</p>

<p>"But, papa," his daughter pleaded, "it isn’t the people in the
house who are making the noise; it’s that darkey yelling at a
horse. You’ve <em>got</em> to come."</p>

<p>"Why have I?"</p>

<p>"Because you’re their next-door <em>neighbour</em>. Because it’s
a time when <em>all</em> their friends should go."</p>

<p>"Why is it?" he asked stubbornly. "What they want to make all
this fuss over her for, anyway? I guess, from what I hear, her
folks didn’t make any fuss over <em>them</em> in New York. Just
barely let ’em come to the weddin’ and never even asked ’em to
a single meal! I should think the Oliphant family’d have too much
pride to go and get up a big doin’s like this over a girl when
her family treated them like that!"</p>

<p>"<em>Please</em> come," Martha begged. "All that matters to Dan’s
father and mother is that he <em>is</em> married and they want
their old friends to meet the bride and say a word of welcome
to her."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>I</em> don’t want to say any welcome to her. Dan Oliphant
hadn’t got any more business to get married right now than a muskrat;
he’s as poor as one! I don’t want to go over there and take on
like I approve of any such a foolishness."</p>

<p>"You’re only making excuses," Martha said, frowning, and she
took his arm firmly, propelling him toward the veranda steps.
"You know how they’d all feel if their oldest neighbour didn’t
go. You <em>are</em> going, papa."</p>

<p>"I won’t!" he protested fiercely; then unexpectedly giving way
to what at least appeared to be superior physical force, he descended
the steps. "Plague take it!" he said, and walked on beside his
daughter without further resistance.</p>

<p>At the Oliphants’ open front doors they seemed to step into the
breath of a furnace stoked with flowers. Moreover, this hot and
fragrant breath was laden with clamour, the conglomerate voices
of two hundred people exhausting themselves to be heard in spite
of one another and in spite of the music.</p>

<p>"Gee-mun-<em>nently</em>!" Mr. Shelby groaned, as this turmoil
buffeted his ears. "Why, this is worse’n a chicken farm when they’re
killin’ for market! I’m goin’ straight home!" And he made a serious
attempt to depart through the portal they had just entered, but
Martha had taken his arm too firmly for him to succeed without
creating scandal.</p>

<p>A head taller than her father, she was both powerful and determined;
and his resistance could be but momentary. She said "<em>Papa</em>!"
indignantly under her breath; he succumbed, indistinctly muttering
obsolete profanity; and they went into a drawing-room that was
the very pit of the clamour and the flowery heat, in spite of
generous floor space and high ceilings. The big room was so crowded
with hot, well-dressed people that Martha had difficulty in passing
between the vociferous groups, especially as many sought to detain
her with greetings, and women clutched her, demanding in confidential
shouts: "What do you <em>think</em> of her?"</p>

<p>But she pressed on, keeping a sure hold upon her outraged father,
until they reached the other end of the room; for there, in a
trellised floral bower, with all the flowers wilted in the heat,
Dan Oliphant stood with his bride and his father and mother.</p>

<p>The reception party appeared to be little less wilted than the
flowers; Mr. Oliphant and Dan, in their thick frock coats, suffering
more than the two ladies; but all four smiled with a brave fixity,
as they had been smiling for more than an hour; and the three
Oliphants were still able to speak with a cordiality that even
this ordeal had been unable to exhaust.</p>

<p>The bride might have been taken for a somewhat bewildered automaton,
greatly needing a rewinding of its mechanism. In white satin,
with pearls in her black hair, she was waxy pale under the rouge
it was her habit to use, and she only murmured indistinguishably
as Mr. Oliphant presented his guests to her. The faint smile she
wore upon her lips she did indeed appear to wear, and to have
worn so long that it was almost worn-out;—no one could doubt that
she longed for the time when she could permit herself to get rid
of it. As a matter of fact, she granted herself that privilege
when Mr. Oliphant presented Miss Shelby to her; for the smile
faded to an indiscernible tracing as Lena found the statuesque
amplitude of Martha towering over her. The small bride looked
almost apprehensive.</p>

<p>"I hope—I do hope you’ll be able to like me," Martha said, a
little nervously. "I live next door, and I hope—I do hope you’ll
be able to." Then, as Lena said nothing, Martha gave Mr. Shelby’s
arm a tug, unseen, and brought him unwillingly to face the bride.
"This is my father. He’s a new neighbour for you, too."</p>

<p>The old gentleman made a slight, hostile duck with his head.
"Pleased to meet ye, ma’am," he said severely.</p>

<p>At that the bride seemed to be astonished. "What?" she said.</p>

<p>"I bid you good afternoon, ma’am," he returned, ducked his head
again, and passed on as rapidly as he could.</p>

<p>Martha whispered hurriedly to Dan: "She <em>is</em> beautiful!"
and would have followed her father, but Dan detained her.</p>

<p>"Martha, will you help us to get her to like it here?" he said.
"You see she’s such an utter stranger and everything’s bound to
seem sort of different at first. I’ve been hoping you’d let her
be your best friend, because you—you’d——"</p>

<p>"If she’ll let me, Dan," Martha said, her voice faltering as
she continued, "You know that I’d always—I’d always <em>want</em>
to——" She stopped, glancing back at Lena, whose own glances seemed
to be noting with some interest the heartiness with which Dan
still grasped the hand of this next-door Juno. "I know she’s lovely!"
Martha said; and she moved away to overtake her father, who had
every intention of leaving the house at once, but found himself
again balked by his daughter’s taking his arm.</p>

<p>"What <em>you</em> so upset over?" he asked crossly. "What’s
the matter your face?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, papa. Why?"</p>

<p>"Looks as though you’re takin’ cold. It’s the heat, maybe. Let’s
go."</p>

<p>"Not yet, papa."</p>

<p>"Look a-here!" he said, "I’m not goin’ to promenade out in that
dining-room and ruin my stomach on lemonade and doodaddle refreshments.
It’s suppertime right now, and I want to go home!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" she bade him. "It wouldn’t be polite to rush right out.
Just stay a minute or two longer; then you can go."</p>

<p>"But what’s the <em>use</em>? I don’t want to hang around here
with all the fat women in town perspiring against my clo’es. I
hate the whole possytucky of ’em!"</p>

<p>"<em>Sh</em>, papa!"</p>

<p>"I don’t care," he went on with husky vehemence. "Nothin’ to
do here except stare at the bride, and she’s so little it don’t
take much time to see <em>her</em>; she’s just about half your
size—you made her seem like a wax doll beside you, and the way
she looked at you, I guess she thought so, too. Anyway, she does
look like a wax doll. Looks worse’n <em>that</em>, too!"</p>

<p>"No, no!"</p>

<p>"Yes, she does," he insisted. "She’s got paint on her. Her face
is all over paint."</p>

<p>"It isn’t paint. It’s only rouge."</p>

<p>"What’s the difference? It ain’t decent. She paints. She’s got
red paint on her cheeks and black paint on her eye-winkers. Looks
to me like Dan Oliphant’s gone and married a New York fast woman."</p>

<p>"Hush!" Martha commanded him sharply. "People will hear you!"</p>

<p>"I can’t hardly hear myself!" he retorted. "Never got in such
a gibblety-gabble in my born days. I tell you she paints! Her
mother-in-law ought to take her out to a washstand and clean her
up like a respectable woman. The Oliphant family ought to know
what people’ll take her for, if they let her go around all painted
up like that. If she was <em>my</em> daughter-in-law——"</p>

<p>But here Martha’s protest was so vehement as to check him. "Everybody
<em>will</em> hear you! Be quiet! Look there!"</p>

<p>She caught her breath, staring wide-eyed; and, turning to see
what had so decisively fixed her attention, he realized that the
clamorous place had become almost silent. Old Mrs. Savage, leaning
upon her grandson Harlan’s arm, had entered the room and was on
her way to the bride.</p>

<p>The guests made a passage for her, crowding back upon themselves
until there was an aisle through which she and Harlan slowly passed.
She was in fine gray silk and lace; and her hair, covered only
in part by the lace cap, was still browner than it was white.
But she could no longer hold herself upright as of yore; a cruel
stoop had got into the indomitable back at last, and she was visibly
tremulous all over. The emaciation, too, of such great age had
come upon her; the last few months had begun the final shrivelling
of everything except the self, but in her eyes that ageless self
almost flamed;—it had a kind of majesty, for its will alone and
no other force could have made the spent body walk. Thus, among
these people who had known her all their lives, there was an awe
of her, so that they had hushed themselves, silently making room
for her to pass; and she was so frail, so nearly gone from life,
that to many of them it seemed almost as if a woman already dead
walked among them. They perceived that she could never again do
what she was doing to-day, nor could any fail to comprehend in
her look her own gaunt recognition that this was the last time
she would thus be seen.</p>

<p>Slowly, with Harlan helping her, she went through the room, came
to Lena, and stood before her, looking at her and making little
sighing murmurs that told of the effort it cost her still to live
and move. Then, in a voice not cracked or quavering, though broken
a little, she said: "I thought so! But you’re welcome."</p>

<p>Lena looked frightened, but Dan laughed and kissed his grandmother’s
cheek, talking cheerfully. "Well, this <em>is</em> an honour,
grandma! We hardly hoped you’d come out in all this heat. We certainly
appreciate it, grandma, and we’ll never forget you thought enough
of us to do it. It’s just the best thing could happen to us in
the world!"</p>

<p>His free and easy full voice released the guests from the sympathetic
hush put upon them by the apparition; they turned to one another
again and the interrupted chatter was loudly resumed; but Mrs.
Savage extended her right arm and with her gloved hand abruptly
touched the bride’s cheek.</p>

<p>Startled, Lena uttered a faint outcry, protesting. "What—why,
what do you mean?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Savage was looking fiercely at the tremulous fingertips
of the white glove that had touched the rouged cheek.</p>

<p>"<em>She’s painted!</em>"</p>

<p>Dan laughed and patted the old lady’s shoulder. "You’d better
go and get some iced coffee, grandma," he said, and turned to
his mother. "Couldn’t we all go and get something cold now with
grandma? I don’t believe there are any more people coming and
Lena’s pretty tired, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>"I am," Lena said. "I really am." She came close to him, pleading
in a faint voice: "For heaven’s sake let me go up to my room and
lie down. I can’t stand any more!"</p>

<p>"Why, Lena——"</p>

<p>"Please let me go, Dan."</p>

<p>"Why—but——" he began. "Couldn’t you stick out just a little longer?
If we go to the dining-room with grandma I think it might please
her. Besides, if the bride disappeared at her own reception I’m
afraid they might think——"</p>

<p>"<em>Please</em>, Dan!"</p>

<p>"Well—but, dear——"</p>

<p>But Lena waited for no more argument; she made a gesture of most
poignant appeal, slipped by him and went quickly out through a
door that led into a rear hallway. Dan’s impulse was to follow
her, but he decided that his first duty led him in another direction,
and joined his grandmother who was on her way to the dining-room.
When he had helped Harlan to bring the old lady iced coffee and
such accompaniments as she would consent to nibble, it was time
to return to the drawing-room to say farewell to the guests; for,
according to a prevalent custom, they could not depart without
assuring him that they had enjoyed themselves.</p>

<p>He explained to them that the heat had been too much for Lena,
received their messages of sympathy for her and their renewed
congratulations for himself, and finally, when they were all gone,
ran anxiously upstairs to her. He found her lying face downward
upon her bed in her bridal gown, an attitude less of exhaustion
than of agitation, though it spoke of both. Both were manifest,
too, in the disorder of her curled black hair and in the way one
of her delicate arms was stretched upward across the pillow with
a damp handkerchief half clenched in the childlike fingers.</p>

<p>"Why, Lena——"</p>

<p>"You’d better let me alone!"</p>

<p>"But what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing!"</p>

<p>He touched the small hand on the pillow solicitously. "I’m afraid
I let you get tired, dear."</p>

<p>"‘Tired!’" she echoed, withdrawing her hand instantly. "‘<em>Tired!</em>’"
And with that she abruptly sat upright upon the bed, showing him
a face misshapen with emotion. What added to the disastrous effect
upon her young husband was that her movement completed the disorder
of her hair so that some heavy strands of it hung down, with the
string of pearls, still enmeshed, dangling unheeded against her
cheek. The picture she thus presented was almost unnerving to
Dan, who had never seen a woman so greatly discomposed. His mother
had wept heartbrokenly when her father died; but she had kept
her face covered; and he had no recollection of ever seeing her
with her hair in disorder.</p>

<p>"Why, Lena!" he cried. "What on earth——"</p>

<p>"Nothing!" she said, and laughed painfully, satirizing the word.
"Nothing! Nothing at all!"</p>

<p>"But, dear——"</p>

<p>"Never mind!" She shivered, then sighed profoundly, and stared
at him with curiosity, as if she were examining something unfamiliar.
"So this is what it’s going to be like, is it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I mean this <em>place!</em> These <em>people!</em> This—this
<em>climate!</em>"</p>

<p>But here Dan was touched upon his native pride. "Climate? Why,
this is the best climate in the world, Lena! There isn’t any climate
to compare with it! And as for this little warm spell just now,
why, you see we do need <em>some</em> hot weather."</p>

<p>"Like <em>this</em>?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly! You see this is the greatest corn belt in the
country, dear. If it wasn’t for a stretch or two of good corn-growin’
weather like this every summer, the farmers wouldn’t get half
a crop, and there’d be a big drop in prosperity."</p>

<p>"And you’d <em>rather</em> have it hot like this, then?" Lena
asked, seeming to find him increasingly strange. "You want the
farmers to grow their corn, no matter what happens to your wife?"</p>

<p>"But, my goodness!" he cried, in his perplexity. "<em>I</em>
don’t run the weather, Lena! It don’t make any difference how
I might want it, the weather just <em>is</em> the way it is. Besides,
we don’t mind it so much."</p>

<p>"Don’t you?" She laughed briefly, and shook her head as though
marvelling at the plight in which she found herself, wondering
how she had come to it. "No, I suppose you were born and brought
up to such weather. I suppose that’s why you didn’t tell me about
it before I came here. You probably didn’t realize what this deathly
suffocating air might do to the nerves of a human being who’s
always lived near the sea. And for your mother to make me stand
hours in that oven, trying to talk to all those awful <em>people</em>——"</p>

<p>"Lena!" Dan was as profoundly astonished as he was distressed.
"Why, those are the best people in town; they’re our old family
friends, and I don’t know where in the world you’d expect to find
better. What fault could you find with ’em, dear? They were all
so cordial and pleasant, and so anxious to be friends with you,
I thought you’d enjoy——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she cried. "‘Enjoy!’ Oh, yes!"</p>

<p>"What’s the matter with ’em? Weren’t their clothes——"</p>

<p>"Their clothes!" she echoed desperately. "What do I care about
their clothes!"</p>

<p>"Then what——"</p>

<p>"Oh, don’t!" she moaned. "Don’t ask me what’s wrong with such
people!"</p>

<p>"But I do ask you, Lena."</p>

<p>"Don’t! My life wouldn’t be long enough to tell you."</p>

<p>"Well, I declare!" the dismayed young husband exclaimed, and
sat down beside her on the bed.</p>

<p>But she leaned away from him as he would have put his arm about
her. "Please don’t try petting me," she said. "You’ll never be
able to make me stand such people. I couldn’t! It isn’t <em>in</em>
me to!"</p>

<p>"This is just a little spell you’ve got, Lena; it won’t last.
In a few days you’ll begin to feel mighty different, and then
when you get to knowing mother a little better, and some of the
younger people, like Martha Shelby——"</p>

<p>"Who’s Martha Shelby?"</p>

<p>"You met her and her father this afternoon," Dan explained. "Harlan
and I grew up with her, and she’s one of the finest girls in the
world. She’s always just the same—cheerful, you know, and dependable,
no matter what happens. You’ll get mighty fond of her, Lena. Everybody
always does."</p>

<p>"Was she that great hulking thing with the dried-up little old
father that said, ‘Pleased to meet ye, ma’am?’"</p>

<p>Dan laughed uneasily. "Why, Martha isn’t ‘hulking.’ She’s a mighty
fine-lookin’ girl! She’s tall, but she isn’t as tall as I am,
and she’s——"</p>

<p>"She <em>is</em> that big girl, then," Lena said with conviction.
"I <em>hope</em> you don’t intend to ask me to see anything of
<em>her</em>!"</p>

<p>"But, Lena——"</p>

<p>"She’s an <em>awful</em> person!"</p>

<p>"But you’ve just barely met her," he cried, his distress and
perplexity increasing. "You don’t know——"</p>

<p>"She was perfectly awful," Lena insisted sharply. "Do you <em>have</em>
to let her call you ‘Dan?’"</p>

<p>"Why, good gracious, everybody in town calls me ‘Dan,’ and Martha
lives next door."</p>

<p>"I don’t see why you need to be intimate with people merely because
they live next door," Lena said coldly. "I suppose, though, in
this heavenly climate you feel because a girl lives next door
to you it’s necessary to let her hold your hand quite a little!"</p>

<p>"But she didn’t hold my hand."</p>

<p>"Didn’t she? It seemed to me I noticed——"</p>

<p>"No, no, no!" he exclaimed. "I only wanted to stop her a minute
to say I hoped she’d help make you like it here and be as good
a friend to you as she’s always been to me."</p>

<p>"I see. That’s why you held her hand."</p>

<p>"But I didn’t——"</p>

<p>"Of course not!" Lena interrupted. "Not more than five minutes
or so! And <em>she’s</em> the one you especially want me to be
friends with! I never saw a more awful person."</p>

<p>"But what’s ‘awful’ about her?"</p>

<p>Lena shook her head, as if in despair of him for not comprehending
Martha’s awfulness. "She’s just awful," she said, implying that
if he didn’t perceive for himself why Martha was awful he hadn’t
a mind capable of being enlightened. "I suppose you expect me
to be intimate with her father, too?"</p>

<p>Dan laughed desperately. "I wouldn’t be apt to ask you to be
particularly intimate with anybody his age, Lena."</p>

<p>"I hope not," she said, and became rigid, looking at him with
a cold hostility that was new to his experience and almost appalled
him. "I was afraid you might intend to ask me to be intimate with
your grandmother."</p>

<p>Dan seemed to crumple; he groaned, grew red, apologized unhappily:
"Oh, Lord! I was <em>afraid</em> that’d upset you, but I kind
of hoped you’d forget it."</p>

<p>"‘Forget it?’ When she did it before everybody! Pawing me—croaking
at me——"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he groaned. "I was afraid it bothered you."</p>

<p>"‘<em>Bothered</em>’ me! Is that your word for it?"</p>

<p>"Nobody else noticed it, Lena," he went on. "Nobody except just
our family——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" she said. "The next-door person you admire so much
was one of those that took it all in. She was in at the death—<em>my</em>
death, thank you!"</p>

<p>"Lena, you don’t understand at all. Nobody thinks anything about
anything grandma does. You see she’s a good deal what people call
a ‘privileged character.’"</p>

<p>"‘Privileged?’ Yes! I should say she takes privileges perhaps!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear me!" he sighed. "Lena, you just mustn’t mind it. You
see, she belongs to two generations back, and besides I suppose
most people here wouldn’t know just what to make of your puttin’
artificial colour on your face. For that matter, your own mother
and sister used to be against it, even in New York, and probably
people would take notice of it here a little more than they would
there. I kind of hoped myself, when you got here——"</p>

<p>"How kind of you!" she said. "Possibly some day you’ll understand
a little of what I’ve had to go through since you brought me to
this place. Yesterday, when we got here, I thought I just couldn’t
<em>live</em> in such heat. You’re used to it; you don’t know
what it is to a person who’d never even imagined it. And in spite
of the fact that I was absolutely prostrate with it, your mother
informs me that she’s invited people to come and shake my hand
and arm off for two hours in an oven. Then, because I’m so deathly
pale that I look ghastly, I use a little rouge and am publicly
insulted for it; after which my husband reproves me for trying
to look a little less like a dead person."</p>

<p>Dan was miserable with remorse. "No, no, no! <em>I</em> don’t
mind your puttin’ it on, Lena. I didn’t mean to reprove you; I
only——"</p>

<p>"You only meant to say your grandmother’s insult was justified."</p>

<p>"But it <em>wasn’t</em> an insult, Lena. After you get to know
grandma better——"</p>

<p>"After I <em>what</em>?" Lena interrupted.</p>

<p>"You’ll understand her better after you get to know her."</p>

<p>"After I <em>what</em>?" Lena said again.</p>

<p>"I said——"</p>

<p>"Listen!" she interrupted fiercely. "You must understand this.
On absolutely no account must you expect me ever to go into that
frightful old woman’s house, or to see her, or to speak to her,
or to allow her to speak to me. Never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" Dan groaned; then rose, rubbed his damp forehead,
crossed the room with a troubled and lagging step, and, upon the
sound of a bell-toned gong below, turned again to his bride. "There’s
supper. Mother said we’d just have a light supper this evening
instead of dinner. Could you——"</p>

<p>"Could I what?"</p>

<p>"Could you wash your face and fix your hair up a little?" he
said hopefully, yet with a warranted nervousness. "It’ll do you
good to freshen up and eat a little. Except the family there’ll
be nobody there except—except——"</p>

<p>"Except whom?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Well—except Martha," he faltered. "Mother asked her yesterday
because she thought you’d—well, I mean except Martha and—and grandma."</p>

<p>Lena again threw herself face downward upon the bed; and when
he tried to comfort her she struck at him feebly without lifting
her head. </p>
