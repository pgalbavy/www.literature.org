<p>"So," said Puma, "you are quite convinced he has much wealth.
Yes?"</p>

<p>"You betcha," replied Elmer Skidder. "That pious guy has got
all kinds of it. Why, Alonzo D. Pawling can buy you and me like
we were two subway tickets and then forget which pocket he put
us in."</p>

<p>"He also is a sport? Yes?"</p>

<p>"On the quiet. Oh, I got his number some years ago. Ran into
him once in New York, where you used to knock three times and
ring twice before they slid the panel on you."</p>

<p>"A bank president?"</p>

<p>"Did you ever know one that didn't?" grinned Skidder, inserting
pearl studs in his shirt.</p>

<p>"It is very bad&mdash;for a shake-down," mused Puma, smoothing his
glossy top hat with one of Skidder's silk mufflers.</p>

<p>"Aw, you can't scare Alonzo D. Pawling. Say, Angy, what dames
have you commandeered?"</p>

<p>"I ask Barclay and West. Also, they got another &mdash;Vanna
Brown."</p>

<p>"Pictures?"</p>

<p>"No, she has a friend."</p>

<p>Skidder continued to attire himself in an over-braided evening
dress; Puma, seated behind him, gazed absently at his partner's
features reflected in the looking glass.</p>

<p>"A theatre on Broadway," he mused. "You say he has seemed interested,
Elmer?"</p>

<p>"He didn't run away screaming."</p>

<p>"How did he behave?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's hard to size up Alonzo D. Pawling. He's a fly guy,
Angy. What a man says at a little supper for four, with a peach
pulling his Depews and a good looker sticking gardenias in his
buttonhole, ain't what he's likely to say next day in your office."</p>

<p>"You have accompany him to Broadway and you have shown him the
parcel?"</p>

<p>"I sure did."</p>

<p>"You explain how we can not lose out? You mention the option?"</p>

<p>Skidder cast aside his white tie and tried another, constructed
on the butterfly plan.</p>

<p>"I put the whole thing up to him," he said. "No use stalling
with Alonzo D. Pawling. I know him too well. So I let out straight
from the shoulder, and he knows the scheme we've got in mind and
he knows we want his money in it. That's how it stands to-night."</p>

<p>Puma nodded and softly joined his over-manicured finger-tips:</p>

<p>"We give him a good time," he said. "We give him a little dinner
like there never was in New York. Yes?"</p>

<p>"You betcha."</p>

<p>"Barclay is a devil. You think she please him?"</p>

<p>"Alonzo D. Pawling is some bird himself," remarked Skidder, picking
up his hat and turning to Puma, who rose with lithe briskness,
put on his hat, and began to pull at his white gloves.</p>

<p>They went down to the street, where Puma's car was waiting.</p>

<p>"I stop at the office a moment," he said, as they entered the
limousine. "You need not get out, Elmer."</p>

<p>At the studio he descended, saying to Skidder that he'd be back
in a moment.</p>

<p>But it was very evident when he entered his office that he had
not expected to find Max Sondheim there; and he hesitated on the
threshold, his white-gloved hand still on the door-knob.</p>

<p>"Come in, Puma; I want to see you," growled Sondheim, retaining
his seat but pocketing <em>The Call</em>, which he had been reading.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," said Puma coolly; "I have no time&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, <em>now</em>!" interrupted Sondheim.</p>

<p>They eyed each other for a moment in silence, then Puma shrugged:</p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "But be quick, if you please&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Look here," interrupted the other in a menacing voice, "you're
getting too damned independent, telling me to be quick! I had
a date with you here at five o'clock. You thought you wouldn't
keep it and you left at four-thirty. But I stuck around till you
'phoned in that you'd stop here to get some money. It's seven
o'clock now, and I've waited for you. And I guess you've got enough
time to hear what I'm going to say."</p>

<p>Puma looked at him without any expression at all on his sanguine
features. "Go on," he said.</p>

<p>"What I got to say to you is this," began Sondheim. "There's
a kind of a club that uses our hall on off nights. It's run by
women."</p>

<p>Puma waited.</p>

<p>"They meet this evening at eight in our hall,&mdash;your hall, if
you choose."</p>

<p>Puma nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"All right. Put them out."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Put 'em out!" growled Sondheim. "We don't want them there to-night
or any other night."</p>

<p>"You ask me to evict respectable people who pay me rent?"</p>

<p>"I don't ask you; I <em>tell</em> you."</p>

<p>Puma turned a deep red: "And whose hall do you think it is?"
he demanded in a silky voice.</p>

<p>"Yours. That's why I tell you to get rid of that bunch and their
Combat Club."</p>

<p>"Why have you ask me such a&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Because they're fighting us and you know it. That's a good enough
reason."</p>

<p>"I shall not do so," said Puma, moistening his lips with his
tongue.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess you will when you think it over," sneered Sondheim,
getting up from his chair and stuffing his newspaper into his
overcoat pocket. He crossed the floor and shot an ugly glance
at Puma <em>en passant</em>. Then he jerked open the door and
went out briskly.</p>

<p>Puma walked into the inner waiting room, where a telephone operator
sat reading a book.</p>

<p>"Where's McCabe?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Here he comes now, Governor."</p>

<p>The office manager sauntered up, eating a slice of apple pie,
and Puma stepped forward to meet him.</p>

<p>"For what reason have you permit Mr. Sondheim to wait in my office?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"He said you told him to go in and wait there."</p>

<p>"He is a liar! Hereafter he shall wait out here. You understand,
McCabe?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. You're always out when he calls, ain't you?"</p>

<p>Puma meditated a few moments: "No. When he calls you shall let
me know. Then I decide. But he shall not wait in my office."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir." And, as Puma turned to go: "The police was
here again this evening, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They heard of the row in the hall last night."</p>

<p>"What did you tell them?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the muss was all swept up&mdash;windows fixed and the busted
benches in the furnace, so I said there had been no row as far
as I knew, and I let 'em go in and nose around."</p>

<p>"Next time," said Puma, "you shall say to them that there was
a very bad riot."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"A big fight," continued Puma. "And if there is only a little
damage you shall make more. And you shall show it to the police."</p>

<p>"I get you, Governor. I'll stage it right; don't worry."</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall stage it like there never was in all of France
any ruins like my hall! And afterward," he said, half to himself,
"we shall see what we shall see."</p>

<p>He went back to his office, took a packet of hundred dollar bills
from the safe, and walked slowly out to where the limousine awaited
him.</p>

<p>"Say, what the hell&mdash;" began Skidder impatiently; but Puma leaped
lightly to his seat and pulled the fur robe over his knees.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, in excellent humour, "we pick up Mr. Pawling
at the Astor."</p>

<p>"Where are the ladies?"</p>

<p>"They join us, Hotel Rajah. It will be, I trust, an amusing evening."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>About midnight, dinner merged noisily into supper in the private
dining room reserved by Mr. Puma for himself and guests at the
new Hotel Rajah.</p>

<p>There had been intermittent dancing during the dinner, but now
the negro jazz specialists had been dismissed with emoluments,
and a music-box substituted; and supper promised to become even
a more lively repetition of the earlier banquet.</p>

<p>Puma was superb&mdash;a large, heavy man, he danced as lightly as
any ballerina; and he and Tessa Barclay did a Paraguayan dance
together, with a leisurely and agile perfection of execution that
elicited uproarious demonstrations from the others.</p>

<p>Not a whit winded, Puma resumed his seat at table, laughing as
Mr. Pawling insisted on shaking hands with him.</p>

<p>"You are far too kind to my poor accomplishments," he said in
deprecation. "It was not at all difficult, that Paraguayan dance."</p>

<p>"It was art!" insisted Mr. Pawling, his watery eyes brimming
with emotion. And he pressed the pretty waist of Tessa Barclay.</p>

<p>"Art," rejoined Puma, laying a jewelled hand on his shirt-front,
"is an ecstatic outburst from within, like the song of the bird.
Art is simple; art is not difficult. Where effort begins, art
ends. Where self-expression becomes a labour, art already has
perished!"</p>

<p>He thumped his shirt-front with an impassioned and highly-coloured
fist.</p>

<p>"What is art?" he cried, "if it be not pleasure? And pleasure
ceases where effort begins. For me, I am all heart, all art, like
there never was in all the history of the Renaissance. As expresses
itself the little innocent bird in song, so in my pictures I express
myself. It is no effort. It is in me. It is born. Behold! Art
has given birth to Beauty!"</p>

<p>"And the result," added Skidder, "is a <em>ne plus ultra par
excellence</em> which gathers in the popular coin every time.
And say, if we had a Broadway theatre to run our stuff, and Angelo
Puma to soopervise the combine&mdash;oh boy!&mdash;" He smote Mr. Pawling
upon his bony back and dug him in the ribs with his thumb.</p>

<p>Mr. Pawling's mouth sagged and his melancholy eyes shifted around
him from Tessa Barclay&mdash;who was now attempting to balance a bon-bon
on her nose and catch it between her lips&mdash;to Vanna Brown, teaching
Miss West to turn cart-wheels on one hand.</p>

<p>Evidently Art had its consolations; and the single track genius
who lived for art alone got a bonus, too. Also, what General Sherman
once said about Art seemed to be only too obvious.</p>

<p>A detail, however, worried Mr. Pawling. Financially, he had always
been afraid of Jews. And the nose of Angelo Puma made him uneasy
every time he looked at it.</p>

<p>But an inch is a mile on a man's nose; and his own was bigger,
yet entirely Yankee; so he had about concluded that there was
no racial occasion for financial alarm.</p>

<p>What he should have known was that no Jew can compete with a
Connecticut Yankee; but that any half-cast Armenian is master
of both. Especially when born in Mexico of a Levantine father.</p>

<p>Now, in spite of Angelo Puma's agile gaiety and exotic exuberances,
his brain remained entirely occupied with two matters. One of
these concerned the possibility of interesting Mr. Pawling in
a plot of ground on Broadway, now defaced by several taxpayers.</p>

<p>The other matter which fitfully preoccupied him was his unpleasant
and unintentional interview with Sondheim.</p>

<p>For it had come to a point, now, that the perpetual bullying
of former associates was worrying Mr. Puma a great deal in his
steadily increasing prosperity.</p>

<p>The war was over. Besides, long ago he had prudently broken both
his pledged word and his dangerous connections in Mexico, and
had started what he believed to be a safe and legitimate career
in New York, entirely free from perilous affiliations.</p>

<p>Government had investigated his activities; Government had found
nothing for which to order his internment as an enemy alien.</p>

<p>It had been a close call. Puma realised that. But he had also
realised that there was no law in Mexico ten miles outside of
Mexico City;&mdash;no longer any German power there, either;&mdash;when
he severed all connections with those who had sent him into the
United States camouflaged as a cinema promoter, and under instruction
to do all the damage he could to everything American.</p>

<p>But he had not counted on renewing his acquaintance with Karl
Kastner and Max Sondheim in New York. Nor did they reveal themselves
to him until he had become too prosperous to denounce them and
risk investigation and internment under the counter-accusations
with which they coolly threatened him.</p>

<p>So, from the early days of his prosperity in New York, it had
been necessary for him to come to an agreement with Sondheim and
Kastner. And the more his prosperity increased the less he dared
to resent their petty tyranny and blackmail, because, whether
or not they might suffer under his public accusations, it was
very certain that internment, if not imprisonment for a term of
years, would be the fate reserved for himself. And that, of course,
meant ruin.</p>

<p>So, although Puma ate and drank and danced with apparent abandon,
and flashed his dazzling smile over everybody and everything,
his mind, when not occupied by Alonzo D. Pawling, was bothered
by surmises concerning Sondheim. And also, at intervals, he thought
of Palla Dumont and the Combat Club, and he wondered uneasily
whether Sondheim's agents had attempted to make any trouble at
the meeting in his hall that evening.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>There had been some trouble. The meeting being a public one,
under municipal permission, Kastner had sent a number of his Bolshevik
followers there, instructed to make what mischief they could.
They were recruited from all sects of the Reds, including the
American Bolsheviki, known commonly as the I. W. W. Also, among
them were scattered a few pacifists, hun-sympathisers, conscientious
objectors and other birds of analogous plumage, quite ready for
interruptions and debate.</p>

<p>Palla presided, always a trifle frightened to find herself facing
any audience, but ashamed to avoid the delegated responsibility.</p>

<p>Among others on the platform around her were Ilse and Marya and
Questa Terrett and the birth-control lady &mdash;Miss Thane&mdash;neat
and placid and precise as usual, and wearing long-distance spectacles
for a more minute inspection of the audience.</p>

<p>Palla opened the proceedings in a voice which was clear, and
always became steadier under heckling.</p>

<p>Her favourite proposition&mdash;the Law of Love and Service&mdash;she offered
with such winning candour that the interruption of derisive laughter,
prepared by several of Kastner's friends, was postponed; and Terry
Hogan, I. W. W., said to Jerry Smith, I. W. W.:</p>

<p>"God love her, she's but a baby. Lave her chatter."</p>

<p>However, a conscientious objector got up and asked her whether
she considered that the American army abroad had conformed to
her Law of Love and Service, and when she answered emphatically
that every soldier in the United States army was fulfilling to
the highest degree his obligations to that law, both pacifists
and conscientious objectors dissented noisily, and a student from
Columbia College got up and began to harangue the audience.</p>

<p>Order was finally obtained: Palla added a word or two and retired;
and Ilse Westgard came forward.</p>

<p>Somebody in the audience called out: "Say, just because you're
a good-looker it don't mean you got a brain!"</p>

<p>Ilse threw back her golden head and her healthy laughter rang
uncontrolled.</p>

<p>"Comrade," she said, "we all have to do the best we can with
what brain we have, don't we?"</p>

<p>"Sure!" came from her grinning heckler, who seemed quite won
over by her good humour.</p>

<p>So, an armistice established, Ilse plunged vigorously into her
theme:</p>

<p>"Let me tell you something which you all know in your hearts:
any class revolution based on violence and terrorism is doomed
to failure."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that!" shouted a man.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it. And you will never see any reign of terror
in America."</p>

<p>"But you may see Bolshevism here&mdash;Bolshevist propaganda &mdash;Bolshevist
ideas penetrating. You may see these ideas accepted by Labor.
You may see strikes&mdash;the most senseless and obsolete weapon ever
wielded by thinking men; you may see panics, tie-ups, stagnation,
misery. But you never shall see Bolshevism triumphant here, or
permanently triumphant anywhere.</p>

<p>"Because Bolshevism is autocracy!"</p>

<p>"The hell it is!" yelled an I. W. W.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ilse cheerfully, "as you have said it is hell. And
hell is an end, not a means, not a remedy.</p>

<p>"Because it is the negation of all socialism; the death of civilisation.
And civilisation has an immortal destiny; and that destiny is
socialism!"</p>

<p>A man interrupted, but she asked him so sweetly for a few moments
more that he reseated himself.</p>

<p>"Comrades," she said, "I know something about Bolshevism and
revolution. I was a soldier of Russia. I carried a rifle and full
pack. I was part of what is history. And I learned to be tolerant
in the trenches; and I learned to love this unhappy human race
of ours. And I learned what is Bolshevism.</p>

<p>"It is one of many protests against the exploitation of men by
men. It is one of the many reactions against intolerable wrong.
It is not a policy; it is an outburst against injustice; against
the stupidity of present conditions, where the few monopolise
the wealth created by the many; and the many remain poor.</p>

<p>"And Bolshevism is the remedy proposed&mdash;the violent superimposition
of a brand new autocracy upon the ruins of the old!</p>

<p>"It does not work. It never can work, because it imposes the
will of one class upon all other classes. It excludes all parties
excepting its own from government. It is, therefore, not democratic.
It is a tyranny, imposing upon capital and labour alike its will.</p>

<p>"And I tell you that Labour has just won the greatest of all
wars. Do you suppose Labour will endure the autocracy of the Bolsheviki?
The time is here when a more decent division is going to be made
between the employer and the labourer.</p>

<p>"I don't care what sort of production it may be, the producer
is going to receive a much larger share; the employer a much smaller.
And the producer is going to enjoy a better standard of living,
opportunities for leisure and self-cultivation; and the three
spectres that haunt him from childhood to grave&mdash;lack of money
to make a beginning; fear for a family left on its own resources
by his death; terror of poverty in old age&mdash;shall vanish.</p>

<p>"Against these three evil ghosts that haunt his bedside when
the long day is done, there are going to be guarantees. Because
those who won for us this righteous war, whether abroad or at
home, are going to have something to say about it.</p>

<p>"And it will be they, not the Bolsheviki&mdash;it will be labourer
and employer, not incendiary and assassin, who shall determine
what is to be the policy of this Republic toward those to whom
it owes its salvation!"</p>

<p>A man stood up waving his arms: "All right! All right! The question
is whether the sort of government we have is worth saving. You
talk very flip about the Bolsheviki, but I'll tell you they'll
run this country yet, and every other too, and run 'em to suit
themselves! It's our turn; you've had your inning. Now, you'll
get a dose of what you hand to us if we have to ram it down with
a gun barrel!"</p>

<p>There was wild cheering from Kastner's men scattered about the
hall; cries of "That's the stuff! Take away their dough! Kick
'em out of their Fifth Avenue castles and set 'em to digging subways!"</p>

<p>Ilse said calmly: "Thank you very much for proving my contention
for all these people who have been so kind as to listen to me.</p>

<p>"I said to you that Bolshevism is merely a new and more immoral
autocracy which wishes to confiscate all property, annihilate
all culture and set up in the public places a new god&mdash;the god
of Ignorance!</p>

<p>"You have been good enough to corroborate me. And I and my audience
now know that Bolshevism is on its way to America, and that its
agents are already here.</p>

<p>"It is in view of such a danger that this Combat Club has been
organised. And it was time to organise it.</p>

<p>"It is evident, too, that the newspapers agree with us. Let us
read you what one of them has to say:</p>

<p>  "'We fully realise the atrocity of the Bolshevik propaganda,
which   is really the doctrine of communism and anarchy. We realise
the   perilous ferment which endangers civilisation. But in the  
countries which have held fast to moral standards during the war  
we believe the factors of safety are sufficiently great, the  
forces of sanity are far stronger than those of chaos&#11834;'"</p>

<p>Here, those whose rôle it was to interrupt with derisive laughter,
broke out at a preconcerted signal. But Ilse read on:</p>

<p>  "'In a word, as a mere matter of self-interest and common sense,  
we can only see the people, as a whole, in any country, as opposed  
to anarchy in any form. In our own land, even granted that there  
are a hundred thousand "red" agitators, or say a quarter of a  
million&mdash;and we have no real belief that this is so&mdash;what are  
these in a population of one hundred and five millions? Are the  
ninety and nine sane, moral, law abiding men and women going to  
allow themselves to be stampeded into ruin by a handful of   criminals
and lunatics?</p>

<p>  "'We do not for a moment believe it. These agitators and  
incendiaries have a sort of maniacal impetus that fills the air  
with dust and noise and alarms the credulous. Perhaps it may be  
wise to counteract this with a little quiet promotion of ideas
of   safety and prosperity, based on order and law. It may be
well to   calm the nerves of the timorous and it can do no harm
to set in   motion a counter wave of horror and repulsion against
those who   are planning to lead the world back to conditions
of tribal   savagery. Educational work is always beneficent. Let
us have much   of that but no panic. The power of truth and reason
is in calm   confidence.'"</p>

<p>And now a bushy-headed man got on his feet and levelled his forefinger
at Ilse: "Take shame for your-selluf!" he shouted. "I know you!
You fought mit Korniloff! You took orders from Kerensky, from
aristocrats, from cadets!"</p>

<p>Ilse said pleasantly. "I fought for Russia, my friend. And when
the robbers and despoilers of Russia became the stronger, I took
a vacation."</p>

<p>Some people laughed, but a harsh voice cried: "We know what you
did. You rescued the friend of the Romanoffs&mdash;that Carmelite nun
up there on the platform behind you, who calls herself Miss Dumont!"</p>

<p>And from the other side of the hall another man bawled out: "You
and the White Nun have done enough mischief. And you and your
club had better get out of here while the going is good!"</p>

<p>Estridge, who was standing in the rear of the hall with Shotwell,
came down along the aisle. Jim followed.</p>

<p>"Who said that?" he demanded, scanning the faces on that side
while Shotwell looked among the seats beyond.</p>

<p>Nobody said anything, for John Estridge stood over six feet and
Jim looked physically very fit.</p>

<p>Estridge, standing in the aisle, said in his cool, penetrating
voice:</p>

<p>"This club is a forum for discussion. All are free to argue any
point. Only swine would threaten violence.</p>

<p>"Now go on and argue. Say what you like. But the next man who
threatens these ladies or this club with violence will have to
leave the hall."</p>

<p>"Who'll put him out?" piped an unidentified voice.</p>

<p>Then the two young men laughed; and their mirth was not reassuring
to the violently inclined.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>There were disturbances during the evening, but no violence,
and only a few threats&mdash;those that made them remaining in prudent
incognito.</p>

<p>Miss Thane made a serene, precise and perfectly logical address
upon birth control.</p>

<p>Somebody yelled that the millionaires didn't have to resort to
it, being already sufficiently sterile to assure the dwindling
of their class.</p>

<p>A woman rose and said she had always done what she pleased in
the matter, law or no law, but that if it were true the Bolsheviki
in America were but a quarter of a million to a hundred million
of the bourgeoisie, then it was time to breed and breed to the
limit.</p>

<p>"And let the kids starve?" cried another woman&mdash;a mere girl.
"That isn't the way. The way to do is to even things with a hundred
million hand grenades!"</p>

<p>Instantly the place was in an uproar; but Palla came forward
and said that the meeting was over, and Estridge and Shotwell
and two policemen kept the aisles fairly clear while the wrangling
audience made their way to the street.</p>

<p>"Aw, it's all lollipop!" said a man. "What d' yeh expect from
a bunch of women?"</p>

<p>"The Red Flag Club is better," rejoined another. "Say, bo! There's
somethin' doin' when Sondheim hands it out!"</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Ilse went away with Estridge. Palla came along among the other
women, and turned aside to offer her hand to Jim.</p>

<p>"Did you expect to take me home?" she asked demurely.</p>

<p>"Didn't you expect me to?" he inquired uneasily.</p>

<p>"I? Why should I?" She slipped her arm into his with a little
nestling gesture. "And it's a very odd thing, Jim, that they left
the chafing dish on the table. And that before she went to bed
my waitress laid covers for two."</p>
