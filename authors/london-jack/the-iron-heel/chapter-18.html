Of myself, during this period, there is not much to say.  For six
months I was kept in prison, though charged with no crime.  I was a
suspect--a word of fear that all revolutionists were soon to come
to know.  But our own nascent secret service was beginning to work.
By the end of my second month in prison, one of the jailers made
himself known as a revolutionist in touch with the organization.
Several weeks later, Joseph Parkhurst, the prison doctor who had
just been appointed, proved himself to be a member of one of the
Fighting Groups.
<P>
Thus, throughout the organization of the Oligarchy, our own
organization, weblike and spidery, was insinuating itself.  And so
I was kept in touch with all that was happening in the world
without.  And furthermore, every one of our imprisoned leaders was
in contact with brave comrades who masqueraded in the livery of the
Iron Heel.  Though Ernest lay in prison three thousand miles away,
on the Pacific Coast, I was in unbroken communication with him, and
our letters passed regularly back and forth.
<P>
The leaders, in prison and out, were able to discuss and direct the
campaign.  It would have been possible, within a few months, to
have effected the escape of some of them; but since imprisonment
proved no bar to our activities, it was decided to avoid anything
premature.  Fifty-two Congressmen were in prison, and fully three
hundred more of our leaders.  It was planned that they should be
delivered simultaneously.  If part of them escaped, the vigilance
of the oligarchs might be aroused so as to prevent the escape of
the remainder.  On the other hand, it was held that a simultaneous
jail-delivery all over the land would have immense psychological
influence on the proletariat.  It would show our strength and give
confidence.
<P>
So it was arranged, when I was released at the end of six months,
that I was to disappear and prepare a secure hiding-place for
Ernest.  To disappear was in itself no easy thing.  No sooner did I
get my freedom than my footsteps began to be dogged by the spies of
the Iron Heel.  It was necessary that they should be thrown off the
track, and that I should win to California.  It is laughable, the
way this was accomplished.
<P>
Already the passport system, modelled on the Russian, was
developing.  I dared not cross the continent in my own character.
It was necessary that I should be completely lost if ever I was to
see Ernest again, for by trailing me after he escaped, he would be
caught once more.  Again, I could not disguise myself as a
proletarian and travel.  There remained the disguise of a member of
the Oligarchy.  While the arch-oligarchs were no more than a
handful, there were myriads of lesser ones of the type, say, of Mr.
Wickson--men, worth a few millions, who were adherents of the arch-
oligarchs.  The wives and daughters of these lesser oligarchs were
legion, and it was decided that I should assume the disguise of
such a one.  A few years later this would have been impossible,
because the passport system was to become so perfect that no man,
woman, nor child in all the land was unregistered and unaccounted
for in his or her movements.
<P>
When the time was ripe, the spies were thrown off my track.  An
hour later Avis Everhard was no more.  At that time one Felice Van
Verdighan, accompanied by two maids and a lap-dog, with another
maid for the lap-dog,* entered a drawing-room on a Pullman,** and a
few minutes later was speeding west.
<P>
<P>
* This ridiculous picture well illustrates the heartless conduct of
the masters.  While people starved, lap-dogs were waited upon by
maids.  This was a serious masquerade on the part of Avis Everhard.
Life and death and the Cause were in the issue; therefore the
picture must be accepted as a true picture.  It affords a striking
commentary of the times.
<P>
** Pullman--the designation of the more luxurious railway cars of
the period and so named from the inventor.
<P>
<P>
The three maids who accompanied me were revolutionists.  Two were
members of the Fighting Groups, and the third, Grace Holbrook,
entered a group the following year, and six months later was
executed by the Iron Heel.  She it was who waited upon the dog.  Of
the other two, Bertha Stole disappeared twelve years later, while
Anna Roylston still lives and plays an increasingly important part
in the Revolution.*
<P>
<P>
* Despite continual and almost inconceivable hazards, Anna Roylston
lived to the royal age of ninety-one.  As the Pococks defied the
executioners of the Fighting Groups, so she defied the executioners
of the Iron Heel.  She bore a charmed life and prospered amid
dangers and alarms.  She herself was an executioner for the
Fighting Groups, and, known as the Red Virgin, she became one of
the inspired figures of the Revolution.  When she was an old woman
of sixty-nine she shot "Bloody" Halcliffe down in the midst of his
armed escort and got away unscathed.  In the end she died peaceably
of old age in a secret refuge of the revolutionists in the Ozark
mountains.
<P>
<P>
Without adventure we crossed the United States to California.  When
the train stopped at Sixteenth Street Station, in Oakland, we
alighted, and there Felice Van Verdighan, with her two maids, her
lap-dog, and her lap-dog's maid, disappeared forever.  The maids,
guided by trusty comrades, were led away.  Other comrades took
charge of me.  Within half an hour after leaving the train I was on
board a small fishing boat and out on the waters of San Francisco
Bay.  The winds baffled, and we drifted aimlessly the greater part
of the night.  But I saw the lights of Alcatraz where Ernest lay,
and found comfort in the thought of nearness to him.  By dawn, what
with the rowing of the fishermen, we made the Marin Islands.  Here
we lay in hiding all day, and on the following night, swept on by a
flood tide and a fresh wind, we crossed San Pablo Bay in two hours
and ran up Petaluma Creek.
<P>
Here horses were ready and another comrade, and without delay we
were away through the starlight.  To the north I could see the loom
of Sonoma Mountain, toward which we rode.  We left the old town of
Sonoma to the right and rode up a canyon that lay between outlying
buttresses of the mountain.  The wagon-road became a wood-road, the
wood-road became a cow-path, and the cow-path dwindled away and
ceased among the upland pastures.  Straight over Sonoma Mountain we
rode.  It was the safest route.  There was no one to mark our
passing.
<P>
Dawn caught us on the northern brow, and in the gray light we
dropped down through chaparral into redwood canyons deep and warm
with the breath of passing summer.  It was old country to me that I
knew and loved, and soon I became the guide.  The hiding-place was
mine.  I had selected it.  We let down the bars and crossed an
upland meadow.  Next, we went over a low, oak-covered ridge and
descended into a smaller meadow.  Again we climbed a ridge, this
time riding under red-limbed madronos and manzanitas of deeper red.
The first rays of the sun streamed upon our backs as we climbed.  A
flight of quail thrummed off through the thickets.  A big
jackrabbit crossed our path, leaping swiftly and silently like a
deer.  And then a deer, a many-pronged buck, the sun flashing red-
gold from neck and shoulders, cleared the crest of the ridge before
us and was gone.
<P>
We followed in his wake a space, then dropped down a zigzag trail
that he disdained into a group of noble redwoods that stood about a
pool of water murky with minerals from the mountain side.  I knew
every inch of the way.  Once a writer friend of mine had owned the
ranch; but he, too, had become a revolutionist, though more
disastrously than I, for he was already dead and gone, and none
knew where nor how.  He alone, in the days he had lived, knew the
secret of the hiding-place for which I was bound.  He had bought
the ranch for beauty, and paid a round price for it, much to the
disgust of the local farmers.  He used to tell with great glee how
they were wont to shake their heads mournfully at the price, to
accomplish ponderously a bit of mental arithmetic, and then to say,
"But you can't make six per cent on it."
<P>
But he was dead now, nor did the ranch descend to his children.  Of
all men, it was now the property of Mr. Wickson, who owned the
whole eastern and northern slopes of Sonoma Mountain, running from
the Spreckels estate to the divide of Bennett Valley.  Out of it he
had made a magnificent deer-park, where, over thousands of acres of
sweet slopes and glades and canyons, the deer ran almost in
primitive wildness.  The people who had owned the soil had been
driven away.  A state home for the feeble-minded had also been
demolished to make room for the deer.
<P>
To cap it all, Wickson's hunting lodge was a quarter of a mile from
my hiding-place.  This, instead of being a danger, was an added
security.  We were sheltered under the very aegis of one of the
minor oligarchs.  Suspicion, by the nature of the situation, was
turned aside.  The last place in the world the spies of the Iron
Heel would dream of looking for me, and for Ernest when he joined
me, was Wickson's deer-park.
<P>
We tied our horses among the redwoods at the pool.  From a cache
behind a hollow rotting log my companion brought out a variety of
things,--a fifty-pound sack of flour, tinned foods of all sorts,
cooking utensils, blankets, a canvas tarpaulin, books and writing
material, a great bundle of letters, a five-gallon can of kerosene,
an oil stove, and, last and most important, a large coil of stout
rope.  So large was the supply of things that a number of trips
would be necessary to carry them to the refuge.
<P>
But the refuge was very near.  Taking the rope and leading the way,
I passed through a glade of tangled vines and bushes that ran
between two wooded knolls.  The glade ended abruptly at the steep
bank of a stream.  It was a little stream, rising from springs, and
the hottest summer never dried it up.  On every hand were tall
wooded knolls, a group of them, with all the seeming of having been
flung there from some careless Titan's hand.  There was no bed-rock
in them.  They rose from their bases hundreds of feet, and they
were composed of red volcanic earth, the famous wine-soil of
Sonoma.  Through these the tiny stream had cut its deep and
precipitous channel.
<P>
It was quite a scramble down to the stream bed, and, once on the
bed, we went down stream perhaps for a hundred feet.  And then we
came to the great hole.  There was no warning of the existence of
the hole, nor was it a hole in the common sense of the word.  One
crawled through tight-locked briers and branches, and found oneself
on the very edge, peering out and down through a green screen.  A
couple of hundred feet in length and width, it was half of that in
depth.  Possibly because of some fault that had occurred when the
knolls were flung together, and certainly helped by freakish
erosion, the hole had been scooped out in the course of centuries
by the wash of water.  Nowhere did the raw earth appear.  All was
garmented by vegetation, from tiny maiden-hair and gold-back ferns
to mighty redwood and Douglas spruces.  These great trees even
sprang out from the walls of the hole.  Some leaned over at angles
as great as forty-five degrees, though the majority towered
straight up from the soft and almost perpendicular earth walls.
<P>
It was a perfect hiding-place.  No one ever came there, not even
the village boys of Glen Ellen.  Had this hole existed in the bed
of a canyon a mile long, or several miles long, it would have been
well known.  But this was no canyon.  From beginning to end the
length of the stream was no more than five hundred yards.  Three
hundred yards above the hole the stream took its rise in a spring
at the foot of a flat meadow.  A hundred yards below the hole the
stream ran out into open country, joining the main stream and
flowing across rolling and grass-covered land.
<P>
My companion took a turn of the rope around a tree, and with me
fast on the other end lowered away.  In no time I was on the
bottom.  And in but a short while he had carried all the articles
from the cache and lowered them down to me.  He hauled the rope up
and hid it, and before he went away called down to me a cheerful
parting.
<P>
Before I go on I want to say a word for this comrade, John Carlson,
a humble figure of the Revolution, one of the countless faithful
ones in the ranks.  He worked for Wickson, in the stables near the
hunting lodge.  In fact, it was on Wickson's horses that we had
ridden over Sonoma Mountain.  For nearly twenty years now John
Carlson has been custodian of the refuge.  No thought of
disloyalty, I am sure, has ever entered his mind during all that
time.  To betray his trust would have been in his mind a thing
undreamed.  He was phlegmatic, stolid to such a degree that one
could not but wonder how the Revolution had any meaning to him at
all.  And yet love of freedom glowed sombrely and steadily in his
dim soul.  In ways it was indeed good that he was not flighty and
imaginative.  He never lost his head.  He could obey orders, and he
was neither curious nor garrulous.  Once I asked how it was that he
was a revolutionist.
<P>
"When I was a young man I was a soldier," was his answer.  "It was
in Germany.  There all young men must be in the army.  So I was in
the army.  There was another soldier there, a young man, too.  His
father was what you call an agitator, and his father was in jail
for lese majesty--what you call speaking the truth about the
Emperor.  And the young man, the son, talked with me much about
people, and work, and the robbery of the people by the capitalists.
He made me see things in new ways, and I became a socialist.  His
talk was very true and good, and I have never forgotten.  When I
came to the United States I hunted up the socialists.  I became a
member of a section--that was in the day of the S. L. P.  Then
later, when the split came, I joined the local of the S. P.  I was
working in a livery stable in San Francisco then.  That was before
the Earthquake.  I have paid my dues for twenty-two years.  I am
yet a member, and I yet pay my dues, though it is very secret now.
I will always pay my dues, and when the cooperative commonwealth
comes, I will be glad."
<P>
Left to myself, I proceeded to cook breakfast on the oil stove and
to prepare my home.  Often, in the early morning, or in the evening
after dark, Carlson would steal down to the refuge and work for a
couple of hours.  At first my home was the tarpaulin.  Later, a
small tent was put up.  And still later, when we became assured of
the perfect security of the place, a small house was erected.  This
house was completely hidden from any chance eye that might peer
down from the edge of the hole.  The lush vegetation of that
sheltered spot make a natural shield.  Also, the house was built
against the perpendicular wall; and in the wall itself, shored by
strong timbers, well drained and ventilated, we excavated two small
rooms.  Oh, believe me, we had many comforts.  When Biedenbach, the
German terrorist, hid with us some time later, he installed a
smoke-consuming device that enabled us to sit by crackling wood
fires on winter nights.
<P>
And here I must say a word for that gentle-souled terrorist, than
whom there is no comrade in the Revolution more fearfully
misunderstood.  Comrade Biedenbach did not betray the Cause.  Nor
was he executed by the comrades as is commonly supposed.  This
canard was circulated by the creatures of the Oligarchy.  Comrade
Biedenbach was absent-minded, forgetful.  He was shot by one of our
lookouts at the cave-refuge at Carmel, through failure on his part
to remember the secret signals.  It was all a sad mistake.  And
that he betrayed his Fighting Group is an absolute lie.  No truer,
more loyal man ever labored for the Cause.*
<P>
<P>
* Search as we may through all the material of those times that has
come down to us, we can find no clew to the Biedenbach here
referred to.  No mention is made of him anywhere save in the
Everhard Manuscript.
<P>
<P>
For nineteen years now the refuge that I selected had been almost
continuously occupied, and in all that time, with one exception, it
has never been discovered by an outsider.  And yet it was only a
quarter of a mile from Wickson's hunting-lodge, and a short mile
from the village of Glen Ellen.  I was able, always, to hear the
morning and evening trains arrive and depart, and I used to set my
watch by the whistle at the brickyards.*
<P>
<P>
* If the curious traveller will turn south from Glen Ellen, he will
find himself on a boulevard that is identical with the old country
road seven centuries ago.  A quarter of a mile from Glen Ellen,
after the second bridge is passed, to the right will be noticed a
barranca that runs like a scar across the rolling land toward a
group of wooded knolls.  The barranca is the site of the ancient
right of way that in the time of private property in land ran
across the holding of one Chauvet, a French pioneer of California
who came from his native country in the fabled days of gold.  The
wooded knolls are the same knolls referred to by Avis Everhard.
<P>
The Great Earthquake of 2368 A.D. broke off the side of one of
these knolls and toppled it into the hole where the Everhards made
their refuge.  Since the finding of the Manuscript excavations have
been made, and the house, the two cave rooms, and all the
accumulated rubbish of long occupancy have been brought to light.
Many valuable relics have been found, among which, curious to
relate, is the smoke-consuming device of Biedenbach's mentioned in
the narrative.  Students interested in such matters should read the
brochure of Arnold Bentham soon to be published.
<P>
A mile northwest from the wooded knolls brings one to the site of
Wake Robin Lodge at the junction of Wild-Water and Sonoma Creeks.
It may be noticed, in passing, that Wild-Water was originally
called Graham Creek and was so named on the early local maps.  But
the later name sticks.  It was at Wake Robin Lodge that Avis
Everhard later lived for short periods, when, disguised as an
agent-provocateur of the Iron Heel, she was enabled to play with
impunity her part among men and events.  The official permission to
occupy Wake Robin Lodge is still on the records, signed by no less
a man than Wickson, the minor oligarch of the Manuscript.
