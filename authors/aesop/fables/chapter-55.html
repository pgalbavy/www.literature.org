THE OXEN once upon a time sought to destroy the Butchers, who
practiced a trade destructive to their race.  They assembled on a
certain day to carry out their purpose, and sharpened their horns
for the contest.  But one of them who was exceedingly old (for
many a field had he plowed) thus spoke:  "These Butchers, it is
true, slaughter us, but they do so with skillful hands, and with
no unnecessary pain.  If we get rid of them, we shall fall into
the hands of unskillful operators, and thus suffer a double
death:  for you may be assured, that though all the Butchers
should perish, yet will men never want beef."  
 
Do not be in a hurry to change one evil for another.
