<p>The night was well advanced, and the boys, despite their fine
physique, felt the effects of the prolonged ride. They had come
a goodly distance since morning, the tough little ponies most
of the time maintaining a sweeping canter, which placed many miles
behind them. Jack and Fred were stiffened, tired and hungry, for
no halt was made for supper, it being the intention of the guide
to take that meal at the ranch, which he meant to reach before
drawing rein.</p>

<p>In the midst of the monotonous gallop of the animals the youths
were startled by the sound of a laugh, which suddenly rang out
on the still air. It was brief and hearty, such as a man emits
who is highly pleased over something said by a companion. There
was no moon in the sky, but the starlight was as bright as on
the previous evening. Peering ahead in the gloom, nothing was
to be seen that explained the singular sound.</p>

<p>"Did you hear that?" asked Jack of Hazletine.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you mean that laugh? Not being deaf, it would have
been cur'us if the same hadn't reached my ears."</p>

<p>"What was the meaning of it?"</p>

<p>"It meant, I s'pose, that somebody was pleased."</p>

<p>The lads had to be satisfied with this indefinite answer, but
they did not have to wait long for the explanation. Suddenly,
from the obscurity ahead, loomed the outlines of a building. It
was long, low, and flat, consisting of a single story, like most
of the structures in that section of the country.</p>

<p>At the same moment that it was observed, a tiny point of light
shone through the gloom, and some one called to them:</p>

<p>"Is that you, Hank?"</p>

<p>"I reckon," was the reply.</p>

<p>At the same moment a tall man, rising from the stool on which
he had been seated, came forward. He was smoking a pipe, and the
gleam of the fire in the bowl was what had been noted before he
became visible.</p>

<p>"These are the younkers we expected," explained Hazletine, "and,
if I ain't mistook, they've brought a purty healthy appetite with
'em."</p>

<p>"I've heard of such things afore. Howdy?"</p>

<p>The man, who was known as "Kansas Jim," his full name being James
Denham, extended his hand to each boy in turn, and they dismounted.</p>

<p>"I'll look after the animals," he explained. "Go inside, and
I reckon Ira can give you some medicine fur that appetite Hank
spoke about."</p>

<p>Hazletine led the way to the small covered porch where Ira Garrison,
another cattleman, rose to his feet and shook hands with the boys,
expressing his pleasure at receiving a visit from them. All three
of the arrivals sat down at the front, while Ira passed inside
and lighted an oil-lamp. It seemed that he was not absent ten
minutes when he called out that the meal was ready&mdash;a most welcome
announcement to our young friends. The three were quickly seated
at the pine table and feasting with keen enjoyment. While they
were thus engaged, Ira Garrison sat on a stool a few paces away,
smoking his pipe, and was soon joined by Kansas Jim, who brought
the saddles and belongings of the ponies that he had turned loose
to look after their own wants.</p>

<p>Jack and Fred found their new acquaintances typical cowboys,
dressed similarly to Hazletine, though neither wore as much beard
as he. Both had long hair, pushed behind their ears, while Jim
displayed a luxuriant tawny mustache and goatee, had fine blue
eyes, and was thin almost to emaciation. Garrison was short and
stockily built, with a powerful physique. His hair, eyes and mustache
were as black as coal. He had a fine set of even white teeth,
and was so full of jest and humor that it was safe to conclude
it was something said by him that had caused Jim to break into
laughter.</p>

<p>The structure, as has been said, was a low, flat building, similar
to the majority found in that part of the country. It was made
wholly of wood, with only a single door at the front, where was
a shaded porch, provided with seats, most of which were occupied
at times by the cowmen through the day and late into the night.</p>

<p>There were five men employed at the ranch in looking after the
immense herd of cattle grazing over the surrounding country and
acquiring the plumpness and physical condition which fitted them
for the Eastern market. Hank Hazletine was in charge of the four
men, and would so remain until the task was finished and the stock
disposed of. Barton Coinjock and Morton Blair were absent looking
after the animals, whose wanderings in quest of food sometimes
took them fifteen or twenty miles from the house. Most of the
time, however, the cattle obtained their grazing on the ranch,
a half of which belonged to Mr. Dudley, and which extended into
the foot-hills of the Wind River Mountains.</p>

<p>It has already been made clear that little was to be apprehended
from the hostility of the red men in Wyoming. Rarely is anything
of the kind known north of Arizona and New Mexico, and in those
Territories it seldom manifests itself since the conquest of the
Apaches. There have been fierce collisions of late years between
the cowmen and rustlers of the West, and at one time there was
considerable bloodshed, but the quarrel seems to have been adjusted.</p>

<p>The reader need hardly be told that in the new States, where
grazing has become so important an industry, a perfect system
prevails among the cattlemen. Large associations, with their enormous
herds of cattle, have their own peculiar brands by which their
stock is stamped with their sign of ownership. All these brands
are registered, and the cattleman who uses the same, or is found
in possession of cattle with the brand of another, is subject
to a severe penalty.</p>

<p>Comparatively slight friction, therefore, takes place in those
sections. It is a stirring time when the wonderful horsemen are
engaged for days in branding the calves that have been added to
their herds during the previous months. Sometimes some of the
branded cattle wander off while grazing, but if a cattleman from
Central Wyoming came upon an animal hundreds of miles north in
Montana, bearing his brand, he would promptly cut out the brute
from another herd, whose owner would not think of making objection.</p>

<p>It happens now and then that some of the cattle stray off before
they are branded. The difficulty of their owners identifying them
will be understood. Such cattle are mavericks, and whoever comes
upon them loses little time in scorching his brand into their
shoulders or hips, after which no one cares to dispute their ownership.</p>

<p>The cowmen whose duty it was to look after the large herd browsing
over the thousands of acres composing Bowman's ranch had two annoyances
to guard against. It was their duty, as may be said, to keep the
animals well in hand. But for this precaution hundreds of them
would gradually drift apart until, when the time came for rounding
them up, they would be gone beyond recovery. Great loss, therefore,
was averted by looking after them.</p>

<p>A more aggravating annoyance, however, brings loss to the owners
of the herds. Despite the stringent law, there is always a certain
number of desperate men who take perilous chances in stealing
cattle and running them off beyond recovery by their owners. This
practice is not so prevalent as formerly, for since the brands
are registered, and the agents well known at Cheyenne, Helena,
and other shipping-points, the thieves find it hard to explain
their possession of the carcasses thus marked and escape the arrest
and imprisonment provided as a penalty.</p>

<p>One feature of this annoyance comes from the Indians. By far
the greater majority of those on the reservations are law-abiding.
Under the patient and skilful tutorship of the Government agents
they are advancing in civilization, and in a knowledge of the
trades and of agriculture. Rarely is there any trouble with them;
but it would be strange indeed if, among these people not yet
fairly emerged from barbarism, there were not a number sullen
because of the change, and who cling to the traditions and practices
when the Indian looked upon every white man as his enemy, whom
it was his duty to kill upon the first opportunity. The watchfulness
of the authorities prevents grave crimes, but no vigilance can
keep the dusky thieves from stealthily raiding upon the cattle
and property of their white neighbors.</p>

<p>One of the tasks, therefore, of the cowmen of Bowman's ranch
was to guard against aboriginal thieves. Since those fellows were
sure to have the same trouble as white pilferers in disposing
of their stolen stock, they were fond of stampeding the cattle
when not under the eyes of their caretakers. About all that resulted
from this amusement was extra exasperation and work on the part
of the cowmen.</p>

<p>A more serious mischief was that of killing the animals. Having
satisfied themselves that they were safe from detection, three
or four Indians would entertain themselves for an hour or two
in shooting down cattle in pure wantonness, and then making off
before they were seen. True, this brought the dusky scamps no
gain, but it served as a partial outlet for their enmity of the
white man, and that sufficed.</p>

<p>That this peculiar feature of ranch life sometimes assumed grave
phases was proved by several narrations made by the cowmen to
the boys on their first night at the ranch. Less than a year previous,
Kansas Jim shot from his horse an Indian whom he caught killing
his cattle; and, not many months previous, the five cowmen, under
the leadership of Hank Hazletine, had a running fight for half
an afternoon with a dozen Bannocks, engaged in the same sport.
At that time Barton Coinjock and Kansas Jim were severely wounded,
but three of the marauders were slain, and the mischief nearly
ended for a time.</p>

<p>But Jack and Fred were tired, and, though interested in the reminiscences
of the cowboys, they longed for rest. The house consisted of four
rooms, one being generally reserved for visitors or to serve as
a spare apartment. This contained a wooden bedstead and some simple
furniture, for luxuries are not popular on cattle-ranches. Surely
no bed ever felt more luxurious, however, than the blankets upon
which the wearied youths flung themselves, sinking almost immediately
into deep, dreamless sleep. There were no wolves or dog Indians
to guard against now, and their sense of security was as strong
as if in their own beds at home.</p>

<p>The night was well past, when both lads were awakened by the
sound of rain pattering upon the roof, which, although they were
on the ground floor, was but a brief space above their heads.
The storm foretold by Hank Hazletine had come.</p>

<p>There are few sounds more soothing at night than the falling
of rain-drops upon the shingles over one's head, but in the present
instance the music was anything but welcome to Jack and Fred.
It meant that there could be no hunting on the morrow, and probably
not for several days. Their time in Wyoming was so limited that
they begrudged an hour of enforced idleness.</p>

<p>"But what's the use of kicking?" asked Fred, after they had fully
discussed the situation; "it can't be helped."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they condoled with each other for some time, until,
lulled by the gentle patter, they floated off once more into the
land of Nod, from which they did not emerge until morning.</p>

<p>The first doleful fact that impressed them was that it was still
raining. A peep through the single front window with which their
room was provided showed the dull leaden sky, with its infinite
reservoir, from which the drops were descending in streams that
bid fair to last for days and weeks. The air was chilly, and the
wood fire burning in the adjoining room was grateful.</p>

<p>The boys were surprised by a characteristic fact. At some time
previous to their emerging from their sleeping-room Jim and Ira
had departed to take their turn in looking after the cattle, while
Bart and Mort, as they were called, had come in to spend the day
and night at the building. When they saw the boys they greeted
them pleasantly and conversed for some time. Blair showed himself
a man of education, and it came out afterward that he was a college
graduate, who, having been threatened with pulmonary trouble,
had gone to Arizona and engaged in the cattle business. The experiment
wrought a cure, and he was now one of the sturdiest of the five
men, not afraid to face the more rigorous climate of the North
and to expose himself to all sorts of weather. It was a surprise,
indeed, to Jack Dudley and Fred Greenwood, in the course of the
day, when the conversation happened to drift to the subject of
higher mathematics, to find this cowboy could give them instruction
in the most abstruse problems they had ever attempted to solve.
Thus, although they would have preferred to be away on a hunt,
they found the time less monotonous than anticipated.</p>

<p>"This will let up afore night," said Hank, much to the delight
of his young visitors, "and to-morrow will be clear."</p>

<p>"I hope it will last several days," ventured Fred.</p>

<p>"So it will," remarked the cowman, with that air of assurance
which showed he was more reliable than the Government in his forecasts
of the weather.</p>

<p>Hazletine examined the Winchester repeating-rifles of the boys
with great care. He pronounced them excellent weapons, as were
the Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers with which they were furnished.</p>

<p>"Your outfit is all right," he said, "but it remains to be seed
whether you know how to handle 'em."</p>

<p>"We cannot claim to be skilful," was the modest remark of Jack,
"but we have had some experience at home, though when we hunted
there it was mostly with shotguns."</p>

<p>"The main thing, younker, is not to git rattled. Now, if you
happen to see old Ephraim sailing for you, all you have to do
is to make your aim sure and let him have it between the eyes,
or just back of the foreleg; or, if you don't have the chance
to do that, plug him in the chest, where there's a chance of reaching
his heart."</p>

<p>By "old Ephraim" the hunter referred to the grizzly bear, as
the boys knew.</p>

<p>"I have heard that it generally takes several shots to kill a
grizzly."</p>

<p>"That's 'cause the bullets are not put in the right place. You
see, old Ephraim don't take any trouble to give you a better show
than he has to, and you must look out fur yourself."</p>

<p>"There are other kinds of bears in Wyoming?"</p>

<p>"Rather&mdash;several of 'em. For instance, there's the cinnamon,
which, in my 'pinion, is about as bad as Ephraim. I've fit both
kinds, and the one that left that big scar down the side of my
cheek and chawed a piece out of my thigh was a cinnamon, while
I never got a scratch that 'mounted to anything from Ephraim."</p>

<p>"What about the black bear?"</p>

<p>"He's less dangerous than any of 'em. A black bear ain't much
more than a big dog. Last fall I killed one with my revolver."</p>

<p>"What other kinds of game are we likely to meet?"</p>

<p>"Wal, it would be hard to name 'em all. There's the deer and
antelope, of course, which you find in all parts of the West.
Then there's the mountain lion, that is fond of living on beef."</p>

<p>"I never saw one of the creatures."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen the Eastern panther?" asked Garrison.</p>

<p>"No; though they used to be plentiful in the northern part of
the State of New York."</p>

<p>"Well, the mountain lion is the same animal. Our climate and
conditions have made some changes in his appearance and habits,
but there is no doubt the two are identical."</p>

<p>"There's one kind of game that I wish we could meet," resumed
Hazletine, "but they've got so scarce that I haven't seen one
fur three years. That's the big-horn sheep."</p>

<p>"He seems to be disappearing from certain sections, like the
buffalo from the country," remarked Garrison.</p>

<p>"There's plenty of 'em in the mountains of Arizona and old Mexico,
and I've no doubt there's thousands of 'em in the Wind River and
other parts of the Rockies, but it's mighty hard to find 'em.
Then there's the black wolf."</p>

<p>"Is he fiercer than the gray one?"</p>

<p>"He's ten times worse. Whenever he meets the gray wolf he tears
him to smithereens. You never seen a wolf of any kind that wasn't
as hungry as you younkers was yesterday."</p>

<p>"He couldn't be any hungrier," said Fred, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I have knowed one of them critters to foller a steamboat down
the upper Missouri fur two days and nights, howling and watching
fur a chance to git something to eat."</p>

<p>"The buffaloes have disappeared."</p>

<p>"The right name of the animal is the bison," suggested Garrison;
"they have been slaughtered in pure wantonness. It is a crime,
the way in which they have been extirpated."</p>

<p>"There are a few of 'em left, deep among the mountains," said
Hazletine, "where no one has happened to find 'em, but it won't
be long afore they'll all be wiped out. Do you know," he added,
indignantly, "that last year our boys found a herd of eighteen
buffaloes some miles back in the mountains. Wal, sir, we was that
tickled that we made up our minds to watch 'em and see that they
wasn't interfered with. We kept track of 'em purty well till their
number had growed to twenty-four. Then one afternoon a party of
gentlemen hunters, as they called themselves, from the States,
stumbled onto 'em. Wal, as true as I'm a settin' here, they s'rounded
that herd and never stopped shooting till they killed every one
of 'em!"</p>

<p>The cowman was so angry that he smoked savagely at his pipe for
a minute in silence. His friends shared his feelings, and Kansas
Jim remarked:</p>

<p>"Hank and me hunted two days fur them folks, and if we'd have
got the chance to draw bead on 'em not all of 'em would have got
home. Why, the rapscallions just shot the whole twenty-four, and
left 'em laying on the ground. They didn't even take their hides.
If there ever was such a thing as murder that was."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Garrison; "and although the Government is doing
all it can to protect the few in Yellowstone Park, somebody is
continually shooting into the herd. The bison will soon be an
extinct animal."</p>

<p>"It's too bad, but I don't see that we can help it," observed
Hazletine, rousing himself; "there's plenty of other game left,
and it'll last longer than any of us, but it don't make the killing
of the buffaloes any better. We're likely to find a good many
animals that I haven't told you 'bout and that I don't think of."</p>

<p>"How is it, Hank, that you don't keep any dogs?"</p>

<p>"'Cause they're no use. The hunters from the East seem to think
they must have a dozen or more sniffing at their heels, but I
don't like 'em. We had a big hound a couple of years ago that
I took with me on a hunt. The first critter we scared up was a
cinnamon bear, and that dog hadn't any more sense than to go straight
for him. Wal," grinned Hank, "we haven't had any dog since that
time."</p>
