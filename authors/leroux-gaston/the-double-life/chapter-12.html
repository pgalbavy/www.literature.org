<p><em>THEY </em>wandered down to the lawns at the foot of the
ramparts, and walking across the green grass, they stopped at
the foot of a forked tree. They were seated chatting for some
time, when suddenly Théophraste’s face seemed to light up as if
he recalled something. It seemed as if his memory had suddenly
become awakened to events of years ago. His whole soul was filled
with sweet memories, like the tenderest recollections of youthful
days returning, after having been forgotten for a long time. In
his mind he saw perfectly the spirit of Cartouche, as if he had
never been separated from him by two hundred years. It seemed
to come suddenly to him, and as the events came back to him, he
related them to Adolphe, in the following words:</p>

<p>"Adolphe, my friend, I must tell you that at that time my fortune
was complete. I was dreaded and yet liked by all. I was even liked
by my victims. I despoiled them so gallantly that they went their
way along through the city singing my praises. I had not yet been
attacked by that wonderful sanguinary instinct which some months
later made me commit the most atrocious crimes. Everything prospered
with me; everybody feared me and loved me. I was happy, merry,
of a magnificent audacity, gallant in love, and the ruler of Paris.
They said that I was the greatest of all robbers; that was only
half true, because it was imperative that I should partake of
the sovereignty with M. Law, the Controller-General of Finance.
My glory was at its zenith; for often he and his people paid me
tribute. But he imagined he might excite the Regent against me.
One evening when I had stolen into his room in his hotel, disguised
as a lackey to Lord Dermott, the Regent sent for Monsieur d’Argenson,
keeper of the seals, and told him that he had eight hours in which
to arrest me. M. d’Argenson promised everything he wanted, provided
they let him go by the way of the Convent of the Madeline du Frainel,
where his mistress, Mlle. Husson, had taken refuge. Eight hours
later, M. d’Argenson was still at the Convent with Mlle. Husson.
As for me, my dear Adolphe, during that time, I attended to my
small affairs, and I commanded without any trouble three thousand
men. It was the month of September, the nights were beautiful
and clear, and we profited by this to get into the house of the
Spanish Ambassador, who lived in the old hotel of the Marshal
d’Aucre, in the Rue de Fournon, the same house even which has
since been occupied by the Guard de Paris. We entered his wife’s
bedroom and took possession of all her dresses, of a buckle ornament
with twenty-seven large diamonds, a necklace of very fine pearls,
six plates, six table sets, six knives and ten coral goblets.
We rolled it all up in a table cloth, and went to supper at the
house of the Belle Helene, who kept what you called the Inn of
the Harp in the Rue de la Harp.</p>

<p>"Oh, Adolphe, what a wonderful thing memory is! Truly I do not
know why I said that <em>you</em> called it the Inn of the Harp,
unless in my mind you are representing a friend whom I had, who
was as good as you, and whom I loved as well as you, whose name
was Va-de-Bon Cœur. By the Thunder of the Breast, but he was a
handsome young fellow! He was a sergeant of the French Guards,
and he was my lieutenant. I must tell you, my dear Adolphe, that
I commanded a considerable number of French Guardsmen. At the
time of my arrest, one hundred and fifty non-commissioned officers,
soldiers of the French Guard, hid themselves, and disappeared
over to the colonies. They dreaded lest I should compromise them.
They were wrong, however, for torture could not make me speak.
However, let me leave those melancholy moments, and come back
to the beautiful September nights. We will proceed to the time
when it was customary for the Parisians to take up their new abodes.
The Regent showed still more anger against me and M. d’Argenson,
when he learned about the escapade against the Spanish Ambassador.
Imagine his fury as I turned my attentions to him. Va-de-Bon Cœur,
being on guard at the Palais Royal, carried off two vermilion
flambeaux, which the Duke of Orleans prized very highly. The Regent
was so afraid of being robbed that instead of wearing silver-faced
buckles and sword handles, he resolved to substitute carved steel.
On the first day that he carried one of that kind, I, Cartouche,
stole it from him as he was leaving the opera house. The next
day I sent it back to him in pieces, and I taunted him about his
apparent avarice, and upbraided him, that he, the greatest man
in France, should wish to deprive his unfortunate confrères, the
silversmiths, of a livelihood.</p>

<p>"He answered me publicly by proclaiming that he was very anxious
to know me, and that he would give from his own pocket 20,000
pounds to whoever would bring Cartouche to him. The next day,
as he walked to Saint Germain and was breakfasting in the castle,
he found under his napkin a message of which you will readily
see the sense: ‘My lord, you can see me for nothing. It may be
to-night, at midnight, behind the Anne of Austria Wall in the
forest, where Cartouche will expect you. You are brave. Come alone.
If you come accompanied, you run the danger of death.’</p>

<p>"At midnight, I awaited the Regent; twelve o’clock was still
sounding in the Loges, when the Regent appeared. The moonlight
made the forest seem like fairyland—enchanted, such as one sees
at the theater. The forest, a marvelous, transparent blue, seemed
bereft of all its branches, of all its foliage, of all its thickets.</p>

<p>"‘Behold me, Cartouche,’ said the prince; ‘I come to you armed
with my sword alone, as you have wished. I run perhaps the greatest
danger,’ he said in a clear, derisive voice, ‘but who would not
risk everything to see at close range at midnight, in the heart
of the forest, the form of Cartouche, when it costs nothing?’
Oh, Adolphe, my friend, that thou couldst have been there to hear
me respond to the Regent of France! To be sure, I am only the
son of a poor cooper of the Rue du Pontaux-Choux, but what Condé,
what Montmorency could have bowed with more grace, sweeping the
wet grass with the plume of his hat? The Duke de Richelieu himself
could not kneel more elegantly than I did, nor present in a more
gracious manner to my lord the purse that I had taken from his
pocket. ‘I am,’ said I, ‘the most humble servant of my lord, and
I beg him to take back from Cartouche this purse that I had the
audacity to steal with so much coolness, only to prove to my lord
that his highness finds himself face to face with Cartouche.’
The Regent begged me to preserve that purse for a remembrance
of him. He was wrong to relate, in the course of time, this anecdote;
for the report was spread that he was one of my band. I believe
that he had started to go away, when he put his arm in mine and
dragged me as far to the right as we are sitting to-day.</p>

<p>"Then the regent did me the honor to put his arm in mine, and
I saw that he had something of a secret nature to confide to me.
He did not wait to acknowledge that he counted upon my ingenuity
to avenge him for an offense that Monsieur the Controller-General
had committed against him. He told me that he was quite in love
with the courtesan, Emily; that she was his mistress, and had
been for fifteen days, and that he had learned from La Fillon
that M. Law had the promise of her favors the next night against
the present that he would make her of a ten-thousand-louis necklace.
He was sure of it, for La Fillon was never mistaken. Was it not
from her that he had had a hint of the Cellamore conspiracy? All
the rogues of Paris knew La Fillon.</p>

<p>"La Fillon is a woman of five feet ten inches, who was admirably
formed, a ravishingly beautiful face. From the age of fifteen
years, that model beauty thought that Nature had not provided
such rare treasures to be hidden, so she lavished them. The Duke
d’Orleans, a long time before the regency, loved her. He remained
smitten with her for more than a year. It was for her that he
had constructed, in a retired part of the gardens of Saint Germain,
a sort of grotto, lighted mysteriously by several rays directed
upon a bed of mats, upon which his mistress stretched herself,
clothed in her blonde hair only. He showed them to all who passed
that way, and in that way he made numerous friends. But the fifteen
years of La Fillon flew away in happy days. Now she had no longer
the enjoyment of intrigue, of which she has made two parts—gallantry
and observation. So she furnished some important information to
the police and to M. d’Argenson, guard of the seals, and some
remarkable subjects for the amours of the Regent. It was she who
procured Emily for him, who is by far the prettiest girl in Paris.
Everybody wanted to steal her from him. Law, who was the richest,
swore to succeed there. The bargain was concluded for the next
night.</p>

<p>"‘Cartouche,’ the Regent said to me, after having explained his
small affairs to me, ‘thou art a brave man. I give thee the necklace.’</p>

<p>"And he went away in the moonlight, giving me a slight wave of
the hand. This kind of mission that I received—to thwart the loves
of the Superintendent, and avenge those of the Duke of Orleans,
filled me with pride.</p>

<p>"Being back in Paris, I learned near the morning, through my
police (which was the best information of the epoch), that the
courtesan Emily lived at a small hotel in the Mardis, at the corner
of the Rue Barbette and of the Trois-Pavillons, and that the Regent
showed more attachment for her than he had ever for the Duchess
of Berry, with whom he was disgusted long since for La Baratere,
who shut herself up in the Convent of Chelles, less on account
of her love for God than for her liking for the beautiful nuns
(what morals, my dear Adolphe, what morals!), and it consoled
her that she had recently been mistaken for Mlle de Valois, uniquely
occupied with the Duke de Richelieu. This courtesan, Emily, was
no more than an opera girl, but her beauty, as I have told you,
surpassed all that one can imagine—I was not long in judging for
myself.</p>

<p>"Twenty-four hours after the interview of Saint Germain, that
is to say the midnight following, I went out with a placard describing
exactly the angle of the Rue des Trois-Pavillons and the Rue Barbette.
I had, as if by chance, a pistol in each hand, which made it impossible
for me to decently bow to Mlle. Emily, who appeared, considering
the hour, in the most polite dishabille, with the Superintendent,
who presented a casket to her in which there shone the gems of
a necklace, which was valued at the least at ten thousand louis.
I excused myself for the necessity of keeping my hat on my head,
and begged Monsieur, the Superintendent, seeing the encumbrance
of my hands, to close the casket on the necklace, and to put the
whole thing in the pocket of my cinnamon coat, promising my gratitude
or recognition for this slight service.</p>

<p>"As he hesitated, I proceeded with my presentation, and when
he knew that my name was Cartouche, he obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p>"I begged Mlle. Emily to reassure herself, declaring that she
was in no danger, of which she was convinced, for she began to
laugh heartily at the discomfiture of M. Law. I laughed also.
I said to M. Law that his necklace was worth 10,000 louis, but
if he wished to send the next day, towards five o’clock in the
afternoon, a confidence man to the corner of the Rue Vaugirard
and of the Rue des Fosses—Monsieur le Prince, with five thousand
louis, they would return the collar, on the word of honor of Cartouche.
He replied to me that the bargain was concluded and we took leave
of each other.</p>

<p>"Two days later some one related the adventure to the Regent,
who was at first overjoyed, but whose face changed when he learned
the culmination of the event. The man, Law, had given the five
thousand louis as was arranged, to the man, Cartouche, and he
expected the jewel box, when the other told him that Cartouche
had already gone to carry it himself to Mlle. Emily. Law ran to
the house of the courtesan, saw the necklace and demanded the
price.</p>

<p>"‘It is already received,’ replied Emily, turning her back on
him.</p>

<p>"‘And by whom?’ exclaimed M„ le Superintendent.</p>

<p>"‘Evidently by the one who brought me the necklace—by Cartouche,
who has just left here. Should I not pay upon receipt of the necklace?
And immediately? I have no credit, myself,’ added she, shouting
over the discomfited face of the man of the Rue Quincamprix.</p>

<p>"At the Palais Royal, my dear Adolphe, the jest had the success
that you can imagine. It did not matter, the Regent had found
out that I had surpassed his instructions, and in his anger he
again sent M. d’Argenson to hunt for me. He, however, was again
diverted by the attractions of Mlle. Husson. It was a fact, my
dear Adolphe, that women were a source of great help to me, and
I leaned towards them considerably. But they contributed much
to my ruin, also. Knowing of the propriety of my manners, and
of my exclusive love for Marceline, you must think how two hundred
years changes a man."</p>

<p>Elated at his narrative, Adolphe laughed at the pleasantry which
terminated it. "How two hundred years changes a man!" M. Longuet
laughed at it. The supernatural and terrifying antithesis between
Cartouche and Longuet, which had plunged him at first into the
most melancholy fright, now incited him to make jests. His excuse
was that he did not see anything to fear. He only found his case
a little odd. He joked about it with Adolphe, and even resolved
to no longer keep his true personality from Marceline. She was
intelligent and would understand. He imagined that this personality
would present dangers to himself and to society, but, behold!
it existed no longer in the real condition, but only in his memory,
as a vivid picture. He would not have to control Cartouche as
he had dreaded; he would only have to ask him from time to time,
some anecdote, which would help M. Longuet in conversation. The
history of the Regent, M. Law, and of the courtesan, were sure
proofs of that condition of the soul. How it had glided from his
memory without effort! What evil, then, was there in that? After
all, if he had been Cartouche, it was not his fault, and it would
be very foolish in him to be angry about it. He even joked about
the fortune.</p>

<p>At midnight they made their way back to Paris. As they arrived
at the station St. Lazare, M. Lecamus asked him the following
question:</p>

<p>"My friend, when you are Cartouche, and you take your walks in
Paris, and you see the life of Paris, what astonishes you most?
Is it the telephone, or the railway, or the Metro, or the Eiffel
Tower?"</p>

<p>Théophraste replied, "No, no. That which astonishes me most when
I am Cartouche is the police force."</p>
