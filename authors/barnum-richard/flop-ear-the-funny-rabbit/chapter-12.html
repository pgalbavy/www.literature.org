<p>“What are you doing in these woods?” asked Mappo of Flop Ear, as soon
as the merry monkey had seated himself on a soft cushion of green moss
at the foot of the tree.
</p><p>“I am hopping through them, trying to find my lost home,” answered Flop
Ear. “I live in woods like these, but not in this part. I am lost. What
are you doing here?”
</p><p>“Well, I’m staying here for a while,” answered Mappo. “Years ago, when
I was a little fellow, I used to live in the woods, but not here. In my
country it was very warm. It was what is called a jungle.”
</p><p>“Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, lived in a jungle,” said Flop Ear.
</p><p>“What! do you know about Tum Tum?” asked Mappo in surprise.
</p><p>“Oh, I have met him,” the rabbit replied. “I was near the circus, where
he was, and Dido, the dancing bear; and Tum Tum saved my life.”
</p><p>Then Flop Ear told how the elephant lifted him up in his trunk, and
pulled him out from under the circus wagon wheel.
</p><p>“But you spoke of Tum Tum as though <u>you</u> knew him,” said Flop Ear to
the merry monkey. “How did that happen?”
</p><p>“It was this way,” explained Mappo. “I had not lived in the jungle very
long before I was caught by some men who want monkeys to go around
with the hand-organ players. I was put on a ship and brought to this
country. There Tum Tum and I became good friends. He was also caught in
the jungle and brought over on the ship. Then he went with a circus.
I was there, too, for a while. But I ran away and met Squinty, the
comical pig.”
</p><p>“Why, I know him, too!” cried Flop Ear.
</p><p>“You know many of my friends,” the merry monkey said. “I am glad to
hear that. Well, after a while I was taken in by a nice family, and I
have lived there ever since until yesterday, when I ran away again.”
</p><p>“Why?” asked Flop Ear.
</p><p>“Oh, I wanted to have some adventures. I grew tired of staying in one
place so long, so I ran away to the woods, which are a little bit like
those of the jungle where I used to climb from tree to tree. After a
while I shall run back to the nice people with whom I lived, for I like
them very much.”
</p><p>“I liked the boy from whom I ran away,” said Flop Ear. “Still we
animals were made to roam through the woods and over the fields. It is
no fun to be shut up in a cage.”
</p><p>“That’s right,” chattered Mappo, winding his long tail around his neck,
as you might put a scarf about yours. “Still Tum Tum, the elephant, and
Dido, the dancing bear, do not seem to mind being in the circus.”
</p><p>“I guess that’s different,” said Flop Ear.
</p><p>“Perhaps it is,” agreed Mappo.
</p><p>Flop Ear told his adventures to the merry monkey――how the bunny had
been driven away from his burrow home, how he had gone into the wood
basket and had been found by the boy, and all that followed.
</p><p>“My! you certainly had quite a time,” said Mappo. “Now what do you say
to this? You and I will live together in these woods for a while. I
like it here, and so do you. We will make ourselves a little house of
green branches, and stay in it until I want to run back home again.”
</p><p>“But what about my home?” asked Flop Ear. “I ought to be looking for
it. That’s why I ran away from Jimmie, the boy who taught me to do
tricks.”
</p><p>Mappo thought for a second or two.
</p><p>“I’ll tell you what we can do,” he said. “We’ll stay here a while, and
have a good time, and then I’ll come with you and help you look for
your home. After that I’ll go back to mine.”
</p><p>“That will be fine!” said Flop Ear. “You are very kind to me.”
</p><p>“Oh, I like being kind,” said Mappo. “I learned it of Tum Tum, the
jolly elephant.”
</p><p>Flop Ear thought Mappo a very funny and merry monkey. Mappo could do
more things than could Flop Ear, for the monkey really had four hands,
though as he walked on his hind ones, I suppose they ought to be called
feet. And Mappo’s tail was almost as good as another hand to him, for
the merry monkey could hold himself up in a tree by it, and could swing
to and fro like the pendulum of a clock.
</p><p>If you want to read more about the monkey you may do it in the book
called “Mappo, the Merry Monkey; His Many Adventures.” In that I have
told many things about the jolly four-handed chap.
</p><p>“Well, if we are going to live together in the woods,” said Mappo to
Flop Ear, “we had better start making our house.”
</p><p>“I will cut down branches of trees with my sharp gnawing teeth,” said
Flop Ear.
</p><p>“And I will make them into a house,” said the monkey. “And since
you like to live part of the time down under ground you may dig for
yourself a hole in the middle of the house. We will call that a
cellar.”
</p><p>[Illustration: “My, you certainly had quite a time,” said Mappo.]
</p><p>“That will be fine!” cried Flop Ear.
</p><p>So the two animal friends started to work together. By standing up on
his hind legs, Flop Ear could reach the low branches of some evergreen
trees. These he gnawed off almost as nicely as if they had been cut
with a knife. And, as fast as the tree branches were cut off, Mappo,
with his paws, which were like hands, stuck them in the ground, making
a sort of green tent.
</p><p>Then inside that tent Flop Ear dug for himself a hole under ground, for
rabbits like to stay beneath the top of the earth part of the time.
When the house and the cellar-hole were finished Mappo said:
</p><p>“Now we are all right, except that we need something to eat.”
</p><p>“That will be no trouble for me,” said Flop Ear. “I can eat the bark
off the trees and sweet roots, and perhaps there may grow, not far from
here, some cabbages or carrots.”
</p><p>“I could eat carrots or cabbages,” said Mappo, “but I would not care
for bark from trees. Still I may find some fruit, though in this
country there are no banana or cocoanut trees, such as I love, and
which grew in my own country. Did you ever climb a cocoanut tree, and
pick the nuts?” he asked Flop Ear.
</p><p>“I never did,” replied the white bunny. “A rabbit would look funny, I
think, climbing a tree.”
</p><p>“Perhaps so,” agreed Mappo. “But, if you will excuse my saying so, you
are quite a funny rabbit as it is.”
</p><p>“So I have been told,” laughed Flop Ear. “I don’t mind a bit being
called that. But suppose we go to look for something to eat. It will
soon be dark, and though I can see in the night pretty well, I don’t
suppose you can.”
</p><p>“Not very well,” said Mappo.
</p><p>So, after they had finished making their little house, the monkey and
the rabbit set off together. Flop Ear found a field where turnips grew,
and Mappo found an orchard where some pears and peaches were growing on
trees.
</p><p>“This fruit will be just fine for me,” Mappo said. “Maybe you would
like some of these, Flop Ear,” and he pointed to the trees which grew
in an orchard, not far from the carrot field.
</p><p>“Yes, I think I should like them,” the rabbit answered. “But I can not
climb a tree to get them.”
</p><p>“Oh, I’m just great at climbing trees,” said the monkey. “You just
watch me!” With that, merry Mappo sprang over the fence, and before
Flop Ear could count up to ten (supposing that he knew how), the monkey
had picked some peaches and pears and had scrambled back to the ground
again.
</p><p>“Here, eat some,” he said to Flop Ear, and the rabbit did.
</p><p>“Are they good?” asked Mappo.
</p><p>“Oh, fine!” cried Flop Ear. Then the bunny ate some carrots, and, as
he had paws in which he could carry them, Mappo took home to the leafy
house some fruit and some of the yellow carrots.
</p><p>“Then we won’t have to come back for more right away,” he said. “I
guess the man who owns them won’t mind if we take a few.”
</p><p>It was very nice for Flop Ear and Mappo, living in the leafy house
together. Even when it rained they did not get very wet, for the rabbit
could go down cellar, and Mappo made the roof thick with more branches,
so the rain drops could not drip through on him.
</p><p>Still, every now and then, Flop Ear would think of his own burrow,
where he had been so happy with his father and mother, and with Pink
Nose and Snuggle, before the hunter drove him away.
</p><p>“When are we going to look for my house?” the rabbit would ask the
monkey.
</p><p>“Oh, pretty soon now,” Mappo would answer. “I don’t want to go home
quite yet. I like it here in the woods.”
</p><p>“So do I,” Flop Ear would say. “But still, I want to go to my own home.”
</p><p>And one day the two started off to look for Flop Ear’s home. Every time
they came to a hole in the ground Mappo would ask:
</p><p>“Is this it, Flop Ear?”
</p><p>But the rabbit would look, and then he would say:
</p><p>“No, I am sorry, but that is not it.”
</p><p>“Then we must go on some more,” said Mappo, and on they would go.
</p><p>One day, just as it was getting a little dark, toward evening, Flop
Ear, who was hopping along through the woods with Mappo, heard a
thumping noise. It was a noise such as rabbits make when they call
to one another, and Flop Ear knew at once that some other rabbit was
making signals.
</p><p>“I’ll go and see who that is thumping,” said Flop Ear. “Maybe it’s a
rabbit who knows where my home is.”
</p><p>He ran along a little farther and there, behind a bush, he saw an old
lady rabbit.
</p><p>“Excuse me,” Flop Ear said to her, “but are you thumping for any one?”
</p><p>The old lady rabbit turned around, and who do you suppose she was? Yes,
she was Lady Munch, Flop Ear’s grandmother!
</p><p>“Oh, Grandma! Grandma!” he cried. “I’ve found you at last! Where is my
home, and where are all the others?”
</p><p>“Oh, Flop Ear! Flop Ear!” cried Lady Munch. “You have come home at
last. Oh, we thought you were gone forever! Here, Mr. Bunny! Mrs.
Bunny! Snuggle and Pink Nose! Come here. Flop Ear is back!”
</p><p>Out of a hole near by, in the ground, came running the other rabbits.
There they were――all of Flop Ear’s family. They ran up to him, hugging
and kissing him the way rabbits do. Oh! how glad they were to see him!
</p><p>“Where have you been, Flop Ear? Where have you been?” they asked him.
</p><p>“Oh, everywhere,” he answered. “And I have had <u>so</u> many adventures!
But how is it you are living in this new home? This is not where we
used to live.”
</p><p>“We came here after the hunter chased us,” said the papa rabbit, “and
we have been living here ever since. We looked everywhere for you but
we could not find you.”
</p><p>“And I was out in front of the new burrow just now, thumping with my
feet, and hoping some rabbits might hear it, so I could ask them about
you,” said Lady Munch. “And, lo and behold! along you come yourself,
Flop Ear.”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Flop Ear, “and I’m mighty glad I did.”
</p><p>“But who is your friend?” asked Mamma Bunny, looking at Mappo.
</p><p>“Oh, he is a merry monkey, who was very kind to me,” said Flop Ear.
“He and I have been living in the woods and we have had good times
together. His name is Mappo, and he knows Tum Tum, the jolly elephant,
in the circus.”
</p><p>“What’s a circus?” asked Pink Nose.
</p><p>“And what’s an elephant?” Snuggle demanded.
</p><p>“I’ll tell you all about it,” said Flop Ear, and he did.
</p><p>All the adventures that had happened to him since he had run away did
Flop Ear tell to his brother and sister. Papa and Mamma Bunny listened
also, as did Lady Munch.
</p><p>“But oh! how glad I am to be at home again,” said Flop Ear. “I hope no
more hunters will come along.”
</p><p>“We hope so, too,” said his father.
</p><p>Flop Ear was taken down into the new burrow and given something to eat.
He liked the new home very much. Mappo, the monkey, was too large to go
down into the underground house, but he found a place in a tree where
he could stay all night, and the rabbits gave him some supper.
</p><p>The next morning Mappo said good-by to Flop Ear, and to the other
bunnies.
</p><p>“I’m going back to the house where I live,” said Mappo. “I have had
enough of running away.”
</p><p>“And so have I!” cried Flop Ear. “After this I am going to stay at
home.”
</p><p>And he did. And though he had more adventures they were little ones, in
the woods around the new burrow. And Pink Nose and Snuggle were never
tired of hearing Flop Ear tell of all the wonderful things that had
happened to him, just as I have told you here.
</p><p>And, now since Flop Ear is safe at home again, we will say good-by to
him.
