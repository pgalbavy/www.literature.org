<p>With one bound Harvey Hamilton leaped out of bed and jerked open
the door. Bohunkus Johnson stood before him, atremble with excitement.</p>

<p>"What is it you say?" demanded the young aviator.</p>

<p>"De airyplane am smashed all to bits! It am kindling wood and
nuffin else!" replied the dusky lad, who staggered into the room
and dropped into a chair, so overcome that he was barely able
to stand.</p>

<p>Never did Harvey dress so quickly. While flinging on his garments,
his tongue was busy.</p>

<p>"Have you any idea who did it?"</p>

<p>"Gee! I wish I had! I’d sarve him de same way!"</p>

<p>"Is any one near it?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul; dat is dere wa’n’t anyone when I snoke out dere
and took a look. Ain’t it too bad, Harv? We’ll have to walk home."</p>

<p>"We can ride in the cars; that isn’t worth thinking about."</p>

<p>Talking in an aimless way, the youths a minute later ran along
the hall, skittered down stairs and dashed out to the sheds at
the rear of the hotel. The landlord, who was alone in the bar-room,
stared wonderingly at them as they shot through the door, but
asked no questions.</p>

<p>Bohunkus had scarcely exaggerated in his story. No aeroplane
that gave out in the upper regions and slanted downward to rocky
earth was ever more utterly wrecked. One or more persons had evidently
used a heavy axe to work the destruction. Both wings had been
smashed, fully two-thirds of the ribs being splintered; the lever
handles were broken and even the two blades of the propeller had
been shattered. The machine had been hacked in other places. The
engine, carbureter and magneto were about all that remained intact,
and even they showed dents and bruises as if attempts had been
made to destroy them.</p>

<p>Harvey walked sadly around the ruin and viewed it from every
angle. His face was pale, for his indignation was stirred to the
profoundest depths. He said nothing until his companion asked:</p>

<p>"Who’d you think done it?"</p>

<p>"I have no more idea than the man in the moon. There may have
been only one person, or there may have been half a dozen. Ah,
if I knew!"</p>

<p>Several men straggled into the open yard and to the shed where
they gathered about the two youths. Harvey looked around and saw
there were six, with others coming into sight. Somehow or other
the news of such outrages seems to travel by a system of wireless
telegraphy of their own. In a short time a score of spectators
were gathered, all asking questions and making remarks.</p>

<p>The thought struck Harvey that among this group were probably
the criminals. He looked into their faces and compressing his
lips said:</p>

<p>"I’ll give a hundred dollars to learn what scoundrel did this."</p>

<p>"I’ll gib fourteen million," added Bohunkus enthusiastically.</p>

<p>A tall, stoop-shouldered young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Whoever he was he oughter be lynched and I’d like to help do
it."</p>

<p>The suspicion entered the mind of the young aviator that it was
not at all unlikely that the speaker was the guilty one. With
him might have been joined others and Harvey studied their faces
in the hope of gaining a clue, but in vain. Knowing his father
would back his action he said:</p>

<p>"That was done by some person in Chesterton; you know the people
better than I do; if you would like to earn two hundred dollars
find who he or they were."</p>

<p>Something in the nature of a reaction came over our young friend.
Ashamed of his weakness, he turned his back on the group, walked
rapidly to the hotel and went to his room. And it must be confessed
that when he reached that, he sat down in his chair, covered his
face with his hands and sobbed as if his heart were broken. Bohunkus,
who was at his heels, faced him in another chair, and unable to
think of anything appropriate for the occasion, held his peace,
frequently crossing and uncrossing his beam-like legs, clenching
his fists and sighing. He yearned to do something, but couldn’t
decide what it should be.</p>

<p>Harvey’s outburst lasted only a brief while. He washed his face
and deliberately completed his toilet.</p>

<p>"There’s no use of crying over spilt milk, Bunk," he remarked
calmly; "let’s go down to breakfast."</p>

<p>"I knowed dere was something I’d forgot,—and dat’s it. Seems
to me I’m allers hungry, Harv."</p>

<p>"I have thought that a good many times."</p>

<p>"I’ll tell you what we’ll do, so’s to git rewenge on ’em."</p>

<p>"What’s that?" asked Harvey, who, as is sometimes the case in
mental stress, felt an almost morbid interest in trifles.</p>

<p>"Let’s eat up eberything in de house, so de rest ob de people
will starve to def; de willain dat done dat will be among ’em
and dat’s de way we’ll get eben wid him."</p>

<p>"You might be able, Bunk, to carry out your plan, but I couldn’t
give you much help. Come on and I’ll try to think out what is
the best thing to do."</p>

<p>The second descent of the boys was a contrast to their first.
They showed little or no trace of agitation, as they walked into
the dining-room and sat down at the long table where three other
guests had preceded them. Harvey was so disturbed that he ate
only a few mouthfuls, but hardly less than an earthquake would
have affected the appetite of his companion.</p>

<p>In turning over in his mind the all-absorbing question, Harvey
Hamilton could think of only one explanation. He believed the
destruction of his aeroplane was due to simple wantonness, for
many a man and boy do mischief just because it <em>is</em> mischief
and they know such action is wrong on their part. It was impossible
that he should have an enemy in this country town. It might be
the guilty one or ones were actuated by an unreasoning jealousy
or a superstitious belief that the strange machine was likely
to inflict evil upon the community.</p>

<p>Something like this we say was his theory, though he was not
entirely rid of a vague belief that some other cause might exist.
This was an occasion when he needed the aid of the detective,
Simmons Pendar, who was not in the dining-room nor had he seen
him about the hotel. In the hope of discovering his friend Harvey
strolled into the sitting-room and took the seat he had occupied
the day before. The man in gray was invisible, as were the two
foreign looking individuals who were under suspicion by the officer.</p>

<p>The question which the young aviator was asking himself was as
to the right course for him to follow. Deprived in this summary
fashion of his air machine, he was without power of giving Pendar
any help in his attempt to recover little Grace Hastings from
the kidnappers. Any essay on his part in that direction, now that
he was confined to earth, was sure to hinder more than to aid.</p>

<p>He was still in a maze of perplexity when Bohunkus came ponderously
to his feet and started through the door connecting with the hall
which led up stairs. Harvey naturally looked up to learn why he
did so. With the door drawn back and the negro in the act of stepping
across the threshold, he turned his head, grinned and winked at
his friend. Then he passed out, closing the door behind him, and
the mystified Harvey heard his muffled footsteps along the hall
and ascending the stairs.</p>

<p>"What can he be driving at?" Harvey asked himself; "that wink
looked as if it was an invitation for me to follow him."</p>

<p>Thus early in the day the two were the only ones in the sitting-room,
so that no one could have noticed the action of the two. Nor is
it easy to understand why Bohunkus should have relied upon a wink
of the eye, when it was as easy and would have been much clearer
had he used his gift of speech; but we know how fond his race
are of mystery.</p>

<p>When Harvey reached the top of the stairs, where the view was
unobstructed along the hall, he saw Bunk standing at his door,
as if waiting for him. The space between the two was such that
this time the dusky youth instead of winking flirted his head.
Then he stepped into Harvey’s room and stood just beyond the partially
open door and awaited his friend.</p>

<p>Harvey did not forget that they were near the apartment of Detective
Pendar as well as that of the suspected parties, and while moving
along the passage way he did his utmost in the way of looking
and listening. He made no attempt to soften the noise of his footsteps,
for that of itself would have betrayed him. He strode forward
and through the doors and stood beside the waiting Bohunkus, who
stealthily turned the key in the lock. Then he beckoned to Harvey
to bring his chair and place it alongside the one in which the
African softly seated himself on the far side of the room.</p>

<p>By this time the white youth was beginning to lose patience.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with you, Bunk?"</p>

<p>"Sh! not so loud," replied the other, placing a forefinger against
his bulbous lips.</p>

<p>"Use a little common sense if you have such a thing about you.
If you don’t speak out and explain things, you must get out of
my room."</p>

<p>"All right den; Harv, <em>I know who smashed yo’ airyplane!</em>"</p>

<p>"You do! Why didn’t you tell me before?"</p>

<p>"Wanted to break it to yo’ gentle like."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" demanded the astounded youth.</p>

<p>"Perfesser Morgan!"</p>

<p>Harvey stared in amazement for a moment and then asked:</p>

<p>"How do you know it was he who did it?"</p>

<p>"I seed him!"</p>

<p>"Are you crazy or only a fool, Bunk? Explain yourself. Do you
mean to tell me that you saw Professor Morgan destroy my aeroplane?"</p>

<p>"Didn’t perzactly see him doot, but I seed ’nough."</p>

<p>"How much did you see?"</p>

<p>"When I fust went out ob de hotel and round de corner in de yard
by de sheds I seed a tall man, wid his long linen duster, slip
fru dat place where two boards had been ripped off. Jes’ as he
was slipping fru, he turned and looked at me; dere was de long
part-gray whiskers and de black debilish eyes. Oh, it war him
and no mistake, Harv," added Bohunkus with an air of finality. </p>
