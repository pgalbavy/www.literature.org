<p>Gravity Gimp bore as lightly as he could on the stern of the
boat, which was already so heavily laden that a little more weight
would have sunk it below the surface.</p>

<p>But steady progress was made, and everything was going along
"swimmingly," as may be said, when the craft and its occupants
began to receive alarming attention from the shore.</p>

<p>The reports of guns, and the shouting and whooping were so continuous
that the fugitives had become used to them. The whistling of the
bullets about their ears, and the call of Gimp, notified the ladies
of their danger, and caused an outcry from Aunt Peggy.</p>

<p>"They're shooting at us, as sure as you live; stoop down, Maggie!"</p>

<p>The elderly lady and little Eva got down so low that they were
quite safe. Maggie, however, kept her feet a few moments. Looking
back toward the shore, she saw six or eight Indians standing close
to the water and deliberately firing at them.</p>

<p>"Stoop down," said Gravity, in a low voice. "I'll take care ob
de boat and you see what you can do wid de gun."</p>

<p>The plucky girl acted upon the suggestion. Picking up the weapon
of the African (with which she had shot more than one deer), she
sank upon her knee, and took careful aim at the group on the shore.</p>

<p>Gravity stopped threshing the water, and twisted around so as
to watch the result, while Aunt Peggy and Eva fixed their eyes
on the group with painful interest.</p>

<p>When the whip-like crack of the gun broke upon their ears, the
spectators saw one of the Iroquois leap in the air and stagger
backward, though he did not fall.</p>

<p>"You hit him!" exclaimed the delighted Gravity; "dey'll larn
dat some oder folks can fire off a gun as well as dey."</p>

<p>The shot of the girl caused consternation for a minute or two
among the group. They had evidently no thought of any one "striking
back," now that the panic was everywhere. They could be seen gathering
around the warrior, who was helped a few steps and allowed to
sit on the ground.</p>

<p>Dropping the rifle, Maggie Brainerd caught up the pole once more
and applied it with all the strength at her command, while Gravity
threshed the water with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>Hope was now re-awakened that the river might be crossed in safety.</p>

<p>In the nature of things, the dismay among the Iroquois could
not last long. They were joined by several new arrivals, among
whom was at least one white man.</p>

<p>They saw that the boat was getting farther away, and the fugitives
were likely to escape.</p>

<p>Gravity, who continually glanced over his shoulder, warned Maggie
and the rest (who, however, were equally alert), so that when
the boat was again struck by the whistling bullets no one was
harmed.</p>

<p>"Miss Maggie," whispered Gravity, peering over the gunwale, his
round face rising like the moon under a full eclipse, "you know
dere's another loaded gun; try it agin."</p>

<p>"I musn't miss," she said to herself, sighting the weapon, "for
if ever there was a case of self-defense this is one."</p>

<p>All remained quiet while she carefully drew a bead at the foremost
figure. Before her aim was sure, she recognized her target as
Jake Golcher.</p>

<p>She was startled, and for an instant undecided; but she could
not shoot him, even though he deserved it. She slightly swerved
the point of her piece, hoping to strike one of the Indians, with
the result, however, that she missed altogether.</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Aunt Peggy, with rasping severity, "I've a mind
to box your ears; you missed that Tory on purpose; you ought to
be ashamed of yourself; I'll tell your father what a perjurer
you are."</p>

<p>"I could not do it," replied Maggie, smiling in spite of herself
at the spiteful earnestness of her relative.</p>

<p>"Then load up and try it again."</p>

<p>"Time is too precious to delay for loading guns and shooting
at our old acquaintances, even if they are Tories."</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy was wise enough to see that Maggie could not be dictated
to under such circumstances. She, therefore, held her peace, and
watched the young lady, who applied the pole with a vigor hardly
second to that of Gravity in his efforts of another kind to force
the scow through the water.</p>

<p>Under their joint labors the clumsy craft advanced with considerable
speed, every minute taking it farther from the shots that still
came from the enemies they were leaving behind.</p>

<p>By and by, the African, while kicking, struck bottom with one
foot. With the leverage thus obtained, he shoved the boat faster
than before.</p>

<p>By this time those in the rear had ceased firing, and the interest
of the occupants of the craft centered on the shore they were
approaching.</p>

<p>The water shallowed rapidly, and soon the head and shoulders
of Gravity Gimp rose above the gunwale of the scow. He was now
enabled to look beyond the boat and scrutinize the point where
they were about to land.</p>

<p>He had hardly taken the first glance, when he checked the vessel
with such suddenness that Maggie nearly lost her balance. Looking
inquiringly at him, she asked, with alarm.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Gravity?"</p>

<p>"It's no use, Miss Maggie," was the despairing reply; "we may
as well give up; don't you see we're cotched? The Tories hab got
us <em>dis</em> time, suah!"</p>
