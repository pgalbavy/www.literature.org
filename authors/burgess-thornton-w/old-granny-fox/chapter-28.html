A boasting tongue, as sure as fate,<br/>
Will trip its owner soon or late.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Old Granny Fox.

</p>
</div>
<p>Prickly Porky the Porcupine was enjoying himself. There was no
doubt about that. He was stretched across the doorway of that
old house, the very house in which old Granny Fox had been born.
When he had lain down on the doorstep for a nap and sun-bath,
he had thought that the old house was still deserted. Then he
had fallen asleep, only to be wakened by Reddy Fox, who bad been
asleep in the old house and who couldn't get out because Prickly
Porky was in the way.</p>

<p>Now Prickly Porky does not love Reddy Fox, and the more Reddy
begged and scolded and called him names, the more Prickly Porky
chuckled. It was such a good joke to think that he had trapped
Reddy Fox, and he made up his mind that he would keep Reddy in
there a long time just to tease him and make him uncomfortable.
You see Prickly Porky remembered how often Reddy Fox played mean
tricks on little meadow and forest folks who are smaller and weaker
than himself.</p>

<p>"It will do him good. It certainly will do him good," said Prickly
Porky, and rattled the thousand little spears hidden in his long
coat, for he knew that the very sound of them would make Reddy
Fox shiver with fright.</p>

<p>Suddenly Prickly Porky pricked up his funny little short ears.
He heard the deep voice of Bowser the Hound, and it was coming
nearer and nearer. Prickly Porky chuckled again.</p>

<p>"I guess Mr. Bowser is going to have a surprise; I certainly
think he is," said Prickly Porky as he made all the thousand little
spears stand out from his long coat till he looked like a funny
great chestnut burr.</p>

<p>Bowser the Hound did have a surprise. He was hunting Reddy Fox,
and he almost ran into Prickly Porky before he saw him. The very
sight of those thousand little spears sent little cold chills
chasing each other down Bowser's backbone clear to the tip of
his tail, for he remembered how he had gotten some of them in
his lips and mouth once upon a time, and how it had hurt to have
them pulled out. Ever since then he had had the greatest respect
for Prickly Porky.</p>

<p>"Wow!" yelped Bowser the Hound, stopping short. "I beg your pardon,
Prickly Porky, I beg your pardon, I didn't know you were taking
a nap here."</p>

<p>All the time Bowser the Hound was backing away as fast as he
could. Then he turned around, put his tail between his legs and
actually ran away.</p>

<p>Slowly Prickly Porky unrolled, and his little eyes twinkled as
he watched Bowser the Hound run away.</p>

<p> "Bowser's very big and strong;    His voice is deep; his legs
are long;   His bark scares some almost to death.    But as for
me he wastes his breath;   I just roll up and shake my spears   
And Bowser is the one who fears."</p>

<p>So said Prickly Porky, and laughed aloud. Just then he heard
a light footstep and turned to see who was coming. It was old
Granny Fox. She had seen Bowser run away, and now she was anxious
to find out if Reddy Fox were safe.</p>

<p>"Good morning," said Granny Fox, taking care not to come too
near.</p>

<p>"Good morning," replied Prickly Porky, hiding a smile.</p>

<p>"I'm very tired and would like to go inside my house; had you
just as soon move?" asked Granny Fox.</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Prickly Porky, "is this your house? I thought
you lived over on the Green Meadows."</p>

<p>"I did, but I've moved. Please let me in," replied Granny Fox.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly. Don't mind me, Granny Fox. Step right
over me,"  said Prickly Porky, and smiled once more, and at the
same time rattled his little spears.</p>

<p>Instead of stepping over him, Granny Fox backed away.</p>
