<p>It reminded me forcibly of Episode III in “The Perils of Pamela.”
How often had I not sat in the sixpenny seats, eating a twopenny
bar of milk chocolate, and yearning for similar things to happen
to me. Well, they had happened with a vengeance. And somehow it
was not nearly so amusing as I had imagined. It’s all very well on
the screen—you have the comfortable knowledge that there’s bound
to be an Episode IV. But in real life there was absolutely no
guarantee that Anna the Adventuress might not terminate abruptly
at the end of any Episode.
</p>
<p>Yes, I was in a tight place. All the things that Rayburn had said
that morning came back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell
the truth, he had said. Well, I could always do that, but was it
going to help me? To begin with, would my story be believed? Would
they consider it likely or possible that I had started off on this
mad escapade simply on the strength of a scrap of paper smelling
of moth balls? It sounded to me a wildly incredible tale. In that
moment of cold sanity I cursed myself for a melodramatic idiot,
and yearned for the peaceful boredom of Little Hampsly.
</p><p>All this passed through my mind in less time than it takes to tell.
My first instinctive movement was to step backwards and feel for
the handle of the door. My captor merely grinned.
</p><p>“Here you are and here you stay,” he remarked facetiously.
</p><p>I did my best to put a bold face upon the matter.
</p><p>“I was invited to come here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum.
If I have made a mistake——”
</p><p>“A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!”
</p><p>He laughed coarsely.
</p><p>“What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police——”
</p><p>“Yap, yap, yap—like a little toy dog.” He laughed.
</p><p>I sat down on a chair.
</p><p>“I can only conclude that you are a dangerous lunatic,” I said
coldly.
</p><p>“Indeed?”
</p><p>“I should like to point out to you that my friends are perfectly
well aware where I have gone, and that if I have not returned by
this evening, they will come in search of me. You understand?”
</p><p>“So your friends know where you are, do they? Which of them?”
</p><p>Thus challenged, I did a lightning calculation of chances. Should
I mention Sir Eustace? He was a well-known man, and his name might
carry weight. But if they were in touch with Pagett, they might
know I was lying. Better not risk Sir Eustace.
</p><p>“Mrs. Blair, for one,” I said lightly. “A friend of mine with whom
I am staying.”
</p><p>“I think not,” said my captor, slyly shaking his orange head. “You
have not seen her since eleven this morning. And you received our
note, bidding you come here, at lunch-time.”
</p><p>His words showed me how closely my movements had been followed,
but I was not going to give in without a fight.
</p><p>“You are very clever,” I said. “Perhaps you have heard of that
useful invention, the telephone? Mrs. Blair called me up on it when
I was resting in my room after lunch. I told her then where I was
going this afternoon.”
</p><p>To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pass over
his face. Clearly he had overlooked the possibility that Suzanne
might have telephoned to me. I wished she really had done so!
</p><p>“Enough of this,” he said harshly, rising.
</p><p>“What are you going to do with me?” I asked, still endeavouring to
appear composed.
</p><p>“Put you where you can do no harm in case your friends come after
you.”
</p><p>For a moment my blood ran cold, but his next words reassured me.
</p><p>“To-morrow you’ll have some questions to answer, and after you’ve
answered them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell
you, young lady, we’ve more ways than one of making obstinate
little fools talk.”
</p><p>It was not cheering, but it was at least a respite. I had until
to-morrow. This man was clearly an underling obeying the orders of
a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett?
</p><p>He called and two Kafirs appeared. I was taken upstairs. Despite
my struggles, I was gagged and then bound hand and foot. The room
into which they had taken me was a kind of attic right under the
roof. It was dusty and showed little signs of having been occupied.
The Dutchman made a mock bow and withdrew, closing the door behind
him.
</p><p>I was quite helpless. Turn and twist as I would, I could not loosen
my hands in the slightest degree, and the gag prevented me from
crying out. If, by any possible chance, any one did come to the
house, I could do nothing to attract their attention. Down below
I heard the sound of a door shutting. Evidently the Dutchman was
going out.
</p><p>It was maddening not to be able to do anything. I strained again
at my bonds, but the knots held. I desisted at last, and either
fainted or fell asleep. When I awoke I was in pain all over. It
was quite dark now, and I judged that the night must be well
advanced, for the moon was high in the heavens and shining down
through the dusty skylight. The gag was half choking me and the
stiffness and pain were unendurable.
</p><p>It was then that my eyes fell on a bit of broken glass lying in
the corner. A moonbeam slanted right down on it, and its glistening
had caught my attention. As I looked at it, an idea came into my
head.
</p><p>My arms and legs were helpless, but surely I could still <u>roll.</u>
Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It was not easy.
Besides being extremely painful, since I could not guard my face
with my arms, it was also exceedingly difficult to keep any
particular direction.
</p><p>I tended to roll in every direction except the one I wanted to go.
In the end, however, I came right up against my objective. It
almost touched my bound hands.
</p><p>Even then it was not easy. It took an infinity of time before I
could wriggle the glass into such a position, wedged against the
wall, that it would rub up and down on my bonds. It was a long
heart-rending process, and I almost despaired, but in the end I
succeeded in sawing through the cords that bound my wrists. The
rest was a matter of time. Once I had restored the circulation to
my hands by rubbing the wrists vigorously, I was able to undo the
gag. One or two full breaths did a lot for me.
</p><p>Very soon I had undone the last knot, though even then it was some
time before I could stand on my feet, but at last I stood erect,
swinging my arms to and fro to restore the circulation, and wishing
above all things that I could get hold of something to eat.
</p><p>I waited about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my
recovered strength. Then I tiptoed noiselessly to the door. As I
had hoped, it was not locked, only latched. I unlatched it and
peeped cautiously out.
</p><p>Everything was still. The moonlight came in through a window and
showed me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I crept down
it. Still no sound—but as I stood on the landing below, a faint
murmur of voices reached me. I stopped dead and stood there for
some time. A clock on the wall registered the fact that it was
after midnight.
</p><p>I was fully aware of the risks I might run if I descended lower,
but my curiosity was too much for me. With infinite precautions I
prepared to explore. I crept softly down the last flight of stairs
and stood in the square hall. I looked round me—and then caught my
breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy was sitting by the hall door. He
had not seen me, indeed I soon realized by his breathing that he
was fast asleep.
</p><p>Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voices came from the room
I had been shown into on arrival. One of them was that of my Dutch
friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it
seemed vaguely familiar.
</p><p>In the end I decided that it was clearly my duty to hear all I
could. I must risk the Kafir boy waking up. I crossed the hall
noiselessly and knelt by the study door. For a moment or two I
could hear no better. The voices were louder, but I could not
distinguish what they said.
</p><p>I applied my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. As I had guessed,
one of the speakers was the big Dutchman. The other man was sitting
outside my circumscribed range of vision.
</p><p>Suddenly he rose to get himself a drink. His back, black clad and
decorous, came into view. Even before he turned round I knew who
he was.
</p><p>Mr. Chichester!
</p><p>Now I began to make out the words.
</p><p>“All the same, it is dangerous. Suppose her friends come after
her?”
</p><p>It was the big man speaking. Chichester answered him. He had
dropped his clerical voice entirely. No wonder I had not recognized
it.
</p><p>“All bluff. They haven’t an idea where she is.”
</p><p>“She spoke very positively.”
</p><p>“I dare say. I’ve looked into the matter, and we’ve nothing to
fear. Anyway, it’s the ‘Colonel’s’ orders. You don’t want to go
against them, I suppose?”
</p><p>The Dutchman ejaculated something in his own language. I judged it
to be a hasty disclaimer.
</p><p>“But why not knock her on the head?” he growled. “It would be
simple. The boat is all ready. She could be taken out to sea?”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Chichester meditatively. “That is what I should do.
She knows too much, that is certain. But the ‘Colonel’ is a man
who likes to play a lone hand—though no one else must do so.”
Something in his own words seemed to awaken a memory that annoyed
him. “He wants information of some kind from this girl.”
</p><p>He had paused before the information, and the Dutchman was quick
to catch him up.
</p><p>“Information?”
</p><p>“Something of the kind.”
</p><p>“Diamonds,” I said to myself.
</p><p>“And now,” continued Chichester, “give me the lists.”
</p><p>For a long time their conversation was quite incomprehensible to
me. It seemed to deal with large quantities of vegetables. Dates
were mentioned, prices, and various names of places which I did
not know. It was quite half an hour before they had finished their
checking and counting.
</p><p>“Good,” said Chichester, and there was a sound as though he pushed
back his chair. “I will take these with me for the ‘Colonel’ to
see.”
</p><p>“When do you leave?”
</p><p>“Ten o’clock to-morrow morning will do.”
</p><p>“Do you want to see the girl before you go?”
</p><p>“No. There are strict orders that no one is to see her until the
‘Colonel’ comes. Is she all right?”
</p><p>“I looked in on her when I came in for dinner. She was asleep, I
think. What about food?”
</p><p>“A little starvation will do no harm. The ‘Colonel’ will be here
some time to-morrow. She will answer questions better if she is
hungry. No one had better go near her till then. Is she securely
tied up?”
</p><p>The Dutchman laughed.
</p><p>“What do you think?”
</p><p>They both laughed. So did I, under my breath. Then, as the sounds
seemed to betoken that they were about to come out of the room, I
beat a hasty retreat. I was just in time. As I reached the head of
the stairs, I heard the door of the room open, and at the same time
the Kafir stirred and moved. My retreat by the way of the hall door
was not to be thought of. I retired prudently to the attic, gathered
my bonds round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they
should take it into their heads to come and look at me.
</p><p>They did not do so, however. After about an hour, I crept down the
stairs, but the Kafir by the door was awake and humming softly to
himself. I was anxious to get out of the house, but I did not quite
see how to manage it.
</p><p>In the end I was forced to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir
was clearly on guard for the night. I remained there patiently all
through the sounds of early morning preparation. The men breakfasted
in the hall, I could hear their voices distinctly floating up the
stairs. I was getting thoroughly unnerved. How on earth was I to
get out of the house?
</p><p>I counselled myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil
everything. After breakfast came the sounds of Chichester departing.
To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompanied him.
</p><p>I waited breathlessly. Breakfast was being cleared away, the work
of the house was being done. At last, the various activities seemed
to die down. I slipped out from my lair once more. Very carefully
I crept down the stairs. The hall was empty. Like a flash I was
across it, had unlatched the door, and was outside in the sunshine.
I ran down the drive like one possessed.
</p><p>Once outside, I resumed a normal walk. People stared at me
curiously, and I do not wonder. My face and clothes must have been
covered in dust from rolling about in the attic. At last I came to
a garage. I went in.
</p><p>“I have met with an accident,” I explained. “I want a car to take
me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban.”
</p><p>I had not long to wait. Ten minutes later I was speeding along in
the direction of Cape Town. I must know if Chichester was on the
boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine,
but in the end I decided to do so. Chichester would not know that
I had seen him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay
further traps for me, but I was forewarned. And he was the man I
was after, the man who was seeking the diamonds on behalf of the
mysterious “Colonel.”
</p><p>Alas, for my plans! As I arrived at the docks, the <u>Kilmorden
Castle</u> was steaming out to sea. And I had no means of knowing
whether Chichester had sailed on her or not!
