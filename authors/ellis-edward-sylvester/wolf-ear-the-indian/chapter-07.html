<p>As he was on the point of giving up all hope of ever seeing him
again, Brinton Kingsland was naturally overjoyed at meeting his
favourite pony.  The situation of the young man would have proved
a sad one, had he been compelled to wander over the prairie on
foot, for he would have been liable to encounter hostiles at any
moment.</p>

<p>With the coming of daylight, he could hardly expect to avoid
detection by some of the numerous bands galloping hither and thither,
ready to pounce upon any defenceless settlers, or to cut off the
squads of scouts and soldiers whenever there was a chance of doing
so with little peril to themselves.</p>

<p>And Jack showed as much delight as his master.  He thrust his
nose forward, and whinnied softly in response to the endearments
of Brinton.  Doubtless he had been searching for him for some
time.</p>

<p>"I tell you, old boy, there are only three persons whom I would
rather see just now than you; I won't mention their names, for
you know them as well as I do.  Where are they?  Surely they can't
be far off."</p>

<p>An examination of the horse disclosed that his saddle and bridle
were intact, thus proving that he had not been in the hands of
any enemies, who indeed would not have allowed him to stray off
in this fashion.</p>

<p>Brinton placed his foot in the stirrup, and swung himself astride
of the intelligent beast, who capered with pleasure at feeling
his master once more in the saddle.</p>

<p>Now that such good fortune had come to the youth, he grew anxious
about the dear ones from whom he had been so strangely separated.</p>

<p>There was something in the way in which they had drifted apart
that perplexed him.  The interval in which it occurred was so
brief that he could not believe they were far asunder.  The arrival
of Jack strengthened this belief, and now that he was in the saddle
again, he peered around in the gloom, half expecting their forms
to take shape and come forward to greet him.</p>

<p>The partial clearing of the sky continued.  No snow-flakes drifted
against him, but the moaning wind was as biting and frigid as
ever. The straining gaze, however, could see nothing of horse
or person, though he clung to the belief that they were not far
away.</p>

<p>But with that conviction came the other of the nearness of the
dreaded red men.  He had left them on the bank of the Big Cheyenne,
which was not distant; and, failing to find him there, it was
natural for them to suspect the trick by which he had escaped.</p>

<p>But nothing was to be done by sitting motionless on his horse. 
He ventured to pronounce the name of his father, and then his
mother, increasing the loudness of the tone to an imprudent degree. 
This was done repeatedly, but no answering call was borne back
to him.</p>

<p>Sound could not travel far against the wind on such a blustery
night, and they might be within a hundred yards without his being
able to hear them or they to hear him.</p>

<p>He had absolutely no guide or clue, and despair began to creep
into his heart.  He asked himself what the result was to be if
the aimless wandering should continue through the night.</p>

<p>With the rise of the sun, Pine Ridge would be still a good day's
ride away, and it was too much to hope that they would be permitted
to gallop unchallenged through the reservation.</p>

<p>"Jack," said he, addressing his pony in the odd familiar way
to which he was accustomed, "I can do nothing; you will have to
help us out. So now show what you can do."</p>

<p>Whether the sagacious animal understood what was asked of him
can only be conjectured, but he acted as if he did.  He threw
up his head, sniffed the air, pricked his ears, and started off
at an easy swinging gallop.</p>

<p>Brinton's heart rose with hope.</p>

<p>"He must know where he came from; a horse can teach the best
hunter at such a time, and Jack understands what he is doing."</p>

<p>The pony cantered but a comparatively short way, when he dropped
to a rapid walk, which grew slower every moment.  It was interesting
to see him turn his head and look from side to side, for all the
world as if searching for something which he was surprised he
did not find.</p>

<p>"You must be near the spot," said his master; "don't make any
mistake now, my boy."</p>

<p>He came to a standstill, still turning his head from side to
side, as if examining every point in sight.  There could be no
doubt that he was disappointed, as naturally was his rider also.</p>

<p>"I know this is the spot where you left them to join me, but
they are gone.  I can do nothing: everything depends on you, Jack,
and you must not fail me."</p>

<p>He resumed his deliberate walk, which was continued for only
a short distance.  When he halted finally, his actions said as
plainly as words&mdash;</p>

<p>"I give it up!  I've done my best, and, like you, am at my wits'
end."</p>

<p>For a second time Brinton pronounced the names of the loved ones,
and while doing so, Jack took three or four additional steps,
then halted, threw up his head, snorted, and trembled.</p>

<p>These signs were unmistakable: he had discovered something. 
His master urged him forward.  He obeyed to the extent of a couple
of steps, and then refused to go further.  Not only that, but
he shied to the left, and trembled more than before.</p>

<p>Brinton soothed him, and then leaned over the saddle and looked
into the gloom; and, as he did so, he almost fell from his seat,
because of the shock and faintness from what he saw.</p>

<p>The first glance told him that <em>something</em> was stretched
on the frozen earth but a short distance away.  Further scrutiny
revealed that it was a man, lying motionless at full length.</p>

<p>"It is father!" was the thought of the son, who was out of the
saddle in a twinkling, and running forward.</p>

<p>It was not the body of Hugh Kingsland, but of a stranger.  He
had been a powerful man, who had made a brave fight, and had only
yielded to superior numbers.</p>

<p>Brinton did not attempt any examination in the darkness, for
there was no need to do so.  He uttered a prayer for the unfortunate
one, and for those whom he must have left behind him, and added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thank Heaven, it is not father!  But who can say how soon he,
too, shall not be thus cut down with mother and little Edith?"</p>

<p>He remembered that although this tragedy had taken place so near
him, and within the last hour or two, he had heard no reports
of guns nor any sounds of conflict.  That, however, was accounted
for by the direction of the wind, as already explained.</p>

<p>Really nothing seemed left for him to do.  He had done everything
in his power to find his friends and failed.  As long as night
continued the faculty of vision was useless to him.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack," he said despairingly, "do as you choose; I am helpless."</p>

<p>As if in sympathy with his young master, the pony moved off on
a slow walk, which he continued until, by some means, which Brinton
hardly understood, he clambered down into a gully, similar to
the arroya in which they had taken shelter that afternoon.  In
doing this, it is probable that the animal was guided by that
instinct which prompts his kind to seek shelter from the severity
of the weather, for the refuge was a welcome one to the rider
as well as himself.</p>

<p>On the way thither and after arriving there, Brinton signalled
and called repeatedly to his parents.  The continued failure to
bring a reply led him to decide that nothing more could be done
before morning.</p>

<p>He flung himself off his pony, and made ready to remain where
he was until then.  The gully was narrow, and the banks at the
point where he drew rein were high enough to shut out the gale. 
Food for himself and horse was out of the question, and neither
was suffering for want of it.  The Big Cheyenne had given to them
all the water they wanted; and physically, therefore, nothing
in their condition was specially unpleasant.</p>

<p>It would have been a great comfort to have had a fire by which
to nestle down, but two causes rendered this impossible: no material
was within reach, and, if there had been, he would not have dared
to kindle it.</p>

<p>Jack's saddle was removed, and, in obedience to the command of
his master, he lay down on the flinty earth, while Brinton disposed
himself so as to receive a part of the warmth of his body.  Thus,
with the help of his own thick clothing, his situation was more
comfortable than would be supposed.</p>

<p>Despite his worry and anxiety, he soon fell asleep, and did not
open his eyes again until the grey light of the wintry morning
was stealing through the gully.  He was chilled and cramped by
his exposure, but leaping to his feet, he soon restored his benumbed
circulation.  Jack, seeing his master astir, sprang up, and looked
at him as if to announce that he was ready for any work that was
before them.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, we shall have to go without our breakfast, but
you and I can stand that, I reckon, for this thing must end before
we are many hours older&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be shot!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was uttered by a horseman, who at that moment
rode into sight in the gully and checked his animal only a couple
of rods distant, adding&mdash;</p>

<p>"I didn't expect to meet you here, Brint; where are the rest
of the folk?"</p>

<p>"That's what I would like to know; I am worried to death, Nick;
can't you help us?"</p>

<p>"I'll do anything I can, my lad, but what is it?"</p>

<p>The newcomer was Nicholas Jackson, serving as a scout for General
Miles.  It will be remembered that it was he who stopped at the
home of the Kingslands a short time before and warned them of
their danger.  Had his advice been heeded, they would not have
been in such sore straits at this time.</p>

<p>Brinton quickly told of his strange experience of the night before
and his perplexity as to what he should do.</p>

<p>"I don't think anything has happened to them," was the reassuring
response of Jackson, "for the darkness was in their favour.  They
are hiding somewhere in these gullies, just as you did, and dare
not show themselves."</p>

<p>"But how are we to find them?"</p>

<p>"There's only one way I know of&mdash;look for them."</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Nick?"</p>

<p>"We learned at Wounded Knee that a company with supplies was
to come from Rapid City, and I have been sent out on a scout;
an escort is coming to bring them into camp.  You have heard of
the battle at Wounded Knee Creek, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not a word."</p>

<p>The old scout compressed his lips and shook his head.</p>

<p>"I have been in a good many scrimmages under Generals Crook and
Miles, but that was the hottest half-hour I ever spent."</p>

<p>"How was it, Nick?"</p>

<p>"You know that the hostiles have been gathering in the Bad Lands
ever since this trouble began.  We have them pretty well surrounded,
but there must be a big fight before we wind up this serious business.
Two days before Christmas word reached us that three thousand
Indians, including six hundred bucks, were there.  You can understand
how much relief it was, therefore, to learn that Big Foot, with
a lot of Sitting Bull's fugitives on Cherry Creek Reservation,
had surrendered to Colonel Sumner.</p>

<p>"That was all well enough, but while conducting the band of two
hundred to the Missouri, the next day, the whole lot escaped and
hurried south to join Kicking Bear and the rest of the hostiles.
<em>Then</em> the trouble began.</p>

<p>"Four days later Little Bat, one of our Indian scouts, discovered
Big Foot and his band eight miles north of Major Whiteside's camp
on Wounded Knee Creek, and four troops of the Seventh Cavalry
started for them, with me among 'em.</p>

<p>"As the hostiles spied us they formed a long battle line, all
with guns and knives, the knives being in their cartridge belts
outside their blankets.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Brint, things looked squally.  We could see the
gleam of their black eyes, and the way they scowled and glared
at us showed that nothing would suit 'em better than to drive
their knives to the hilts into every one of us.</p>

<p>"But Major Whiteside meant business.  He drew us up, too, in
battle line.  Just then Big Foot was seen coming forward on foot. 
The major dropped down from his saddle and went forward to meet
him.</p>

<p>"'Me ill,' said Big Foot, 'me want peace&mdash;my people want peace&#11834;'</p>

<p>"The major was impatient.</p>

<p>"'I won't talk or parley with you,' he broke in; 'it is surrender
or fight; I await your answer.'</p>

<p>"'We surrender&mdash;we done so before, but could not find you,' said
Big Foot.</p>

<p>"I had my eye on the chief, who just then turned and motioned
with his arm to his own battle line.  They seemed to be looking
for the signal, 'cause the white flag was shown at once.  We rode
forward quick like and surrounded them, and a courier was sent
off post haste for four troops of the Seventh, and Leftenant Taylor's
scouts to help guard and disarm the party.  They arrived the same
day.  Big Foot had one hundred and fifty warriors fully armed,
with two hundred and fifty squaws and many children.  Despite
the surrender, we all knowed trouble was coming, and it was not
long before it came, like one of them Kansan cyclones."</p>
