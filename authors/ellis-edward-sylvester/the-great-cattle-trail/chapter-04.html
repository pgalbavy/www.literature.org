<p>The family of Texans were not the ones to indulge in sentimentality
or useless speculations when action was demanded. The first feeling
of amazement following Avon's announcement of his resolution quickly
passed, but his uncle deemed it his duty to impress upon him the
desperate nature of his scheme.</p>

<p>"I don't see one chance in twenty of your succeeding," said he.</p>

<p>"And if I stay what are the chances for us all?"</p>

<p>"Possibly one in a hundred."</p>

<p>"Then I shall go," he quietly replied, compressing his lips as
his fine eyes kindled.</p>

<p>"There is hope, if you can reach the bush, but the rub will be
to do <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>"They grow close to the house, and the Comanches will not be
looking for any attempt of that kind."</p>

<p>"Is it not best to wait until later?" asked Mrs. Shirril.</p>

<p>"No," was the sensible response of her nephew; "the prospect
of success will decrease with every passing minute. They will
think, and with reason, that we have repelled their first attack
so sharply that we are confident of beating them off altogether.
After a time, when things begin to look bad for us, they will
look for something of that nature, and be so well prepared for
it that it will be hopeless."</p>

<p>"He is right," assented the captain. "I don't ask you to try
it, Avon, but, if you are determined to do so, now is the time."</p>

<p>"My sentiments exactly, and I'm going."</p>

<p>He dreaded anything in the nature of a scene, one reason for
his moving so promptly being his desire to avert such a trial.</p>

<p>But now that the momentous step was decided upon, the all-important
question remained as to the best means of making the start.</p>

<p>The whole interior of the lower story was so brightly illuminated
by the blaze on the hearth that the moment the door was opened,
even for only a few inches, it would show from the outside. Anxious
as Avon was to be off, he knew better than to start under such
conditions.</p>

<p>"The sooner that fire goes out, the better for all of us," said
the captain; "it is too tempting to the scamps."</p>

<p>On the row of pegs near him hung several heavy blankets, such
as are used by all plainsmen and cowboys. Those which the captain
and his nephew meant to take on their journey northward were in
camp five miles away.</p>

<p>Setting down his gun, he lifted one of the heavy pieces of cloth,
whose texture, like the celebrated blankets of the Navajoe Indians,
was almost close enough to be waterproof. He paused for a minute
to adjust the folds, and then, forgetful of the danger he had
run a short time before, he stepped hastily across the room, and
stooping down flung the blanket over the blaze so as to enclose
it entirely.</p>

<p>The effect was instantaneous. The room was wrapped in darkness
as dense as that outside, though the consequences of the act promised
to be anything but pleasant in the course of a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Now, Avon, is your time!" called the captain in an undertone.</p>

<p>"I'm off; good-by," came from the gloom near the door, where
the sounds showed that he was engaged in raising the ponderous
bar from its sockets.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril stepped hurriedly to the spot, and found the
door closed but unfastened. Even in his haste the youth did not
forget to shut it behind him, leaving to his friends the duty
of securing it in place.</p>

<p>"He is gone; God be with him!" he whispered to his wife and servant,
who with painfully throbbing hearts had stepped to his side.</p>

<p>While speaking, he refastened the structure, and in less time
than it has taken to tell it everything inside was as before,
with the exception that where there had been four persons, there
were now only three.</p>

<p>All forgot their own danger for the moment in their anxiety for
the youth, who had so eagerly risked his own life to save them
from death.</p>

<p>Bending his head, the captain held his ear against the tiny opening
through which the latchkey had been drawn earlier in the evening,
when the heavy bar was put in place. The Texan was listening with
all the intentness possible.</p>

<p>"It seems impossible that he should get away," was his thought,
"and yet the very boldness of his plan may give it success."</p>

<p>The shot from within the cabin, followed so soon by the complete
darkening of the interior, must have caused some confusion among
the Comanches, for otherwise Avon would have been shot or captured
the moment he stepped outside of the cabin.</p>

<p>For the space of two or three seconds Captain Shirril absolutely
heard nothing, except the soft sighing of the night wind among
the mesquite bushes near at hand. The stillness could not have
been more profound had every living thing been moved to a distance
of a hundred miles.</p>

<p>He had listened only a minute or two, however, when he heard
a warrior run rapidly around the building, coming to an abrupt
stop directly in front of the door. Thus he and the Texan stood
within a few inches of each other, separated only by the heavy
structure, which, for the time, barred all entrance.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril even fancied that the eye of the redskin was
pressed against the opening, in the vain effort to gain sight
of the interior. Had the Comanche chosen to place his lips there,
how readily he could have whispered into the ear of his enemy!</p>

<p>That the Texan was right in suspecting one of the warriors was
so very near was proven a moment later, when a second Indian approached
with his mustang on the walk, dropped lightly to the ground, and
coming forward, halted so close to the door that he almost touched
it.</p>

<p>The captain knew this because he heard the two talking in low
tones. He understood the tongue of the dusky miscreants, but though
he listened closely, could not catch the meaning of a word that
passed between them. Their sentences were of the short, jerky
character common to all American Indians, accompanied by a peculiar
grunting, which helped to obscure their meaning.</p>

<p>The unspeakable relief of the listener was caused by the awakening
of hope for his nephew. He was certainly some way from the cabin,
for had he stayed near the door, discovery was inevitable by the
two warriors now standing there. Indeed, they must almost have
stumbled over him.</p>

<p>But he might be still within a few paces, unable to stir through
fear of detection. Extended flat on the ground, on the alert for
the first possible opening, he was liable to discovery at every
moment.</p>

<p>In fact, so far as Avon was concerned, he had crossed the Rubicon;
for, if seen, it was impossible to re-enter the cabin, the door
of which had been shut and barred.</p>

<p>The warriors who had paused in front of Captain Shirril kept
their places but a brief while, when they moved off so silently
that he could not tell the direction they took. Everything remained
still for several minutes, when the listener once more fancied
he heard something unusual.</p>

<p>It was a stir among the mesquite bushes, such as might be caused
by a puff or eddy in the wind, which blew quite steadily, though
with moderate force.</p>

<p>He was listening with all his senses strung to the highest point,
when the stillness was broken by the report of a rifle, accompanied
by a ringing shriek, both coming from a point within a few rods
of the cabin. The hearts of the inmates stood still, the wife
alone finding voice to exclaim in horrified tones:</p>

<p>"Poor Avon! he has fallen! he has given his life for us!"</p>
