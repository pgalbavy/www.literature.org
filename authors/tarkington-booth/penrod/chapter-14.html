<p>"Lo, Sam!" said Maurice cautiously. "What you doin'?"</p>

<p>Penrod at that instant had a singular experience&mdash;an intellectual
shock like a flash of fire in the brain. Sitting in darkness,
a great light flooded him with wild brilliance. He gasped!</p>

<p>"What you doin'?" repeated Mr. Levy.</p>

<p>Penrod sprang to his feet, seized the licorice bottle, shook
it with stoppering thumb, and took a long drink with histrionic
unction.</p>

<p>"What you doin'?" asked Maurice for the third time, Sam Williams
not having decided upon a reply.</p>

<p>It was Penrod who answered.</p>

<p>"Drinkin' lickrish water," he said simply, and wiped his mouth
with such delicious enjoyment that Sam's jaded thirst was instantly
stimulated. He took the bottle eagerly from Penrod.</p>

<p>"A-a-h!" exclaimed Penrod, smacking his lips. "That was a good
un!"</p>

<p>The eyes above the fence glistened.</p>

<p>"Ask him if he don't want some," Penrod whispered urgently. "Quit
drinkin' it! It's no good any more. Ask him!"</p>

<p>"What for?" demanded the practical Sam.</p>

<p>"Go on and ask him!" whispered Penrod fiercely.</p>

<p>"Say, M'rice!" Sam called, waving the bottle. "Want some?"</p>

<p>"Bring it here!" Mr. Levy requested.</p>

<p>"Come on over and get some," returned Sam, being prompted.</p>

<p>"I can't. Penrod Schofield's after me."</p>

<p>"No, I'm not," said Penrod reassuringly. "I won't touch you,
M'rice. I made up with you yesterday afternoon&mdash;don't you remember?
You're all right with me, M'rice."</p>

<p>Maurice looked undecided. But Penrod had the delectable bottle
again, and tilting it above his lips, affected to let the cool
liquid purl enrichingly into him, while with his right hand he
stroked his middle facade ineffably. Maurice's mouth watered.</p>

<p>"Here!" cried Sam, stirred again by the superb manifestations
of his friend. "Gimme that!"</p>

<p>Penrod brought the bottle down, surprisingly full after so much
gusto, but withheld it from Sam; and the two scuffled for its
possession. Nothing in the world could have so worked upon the
desire of the yearning observer beyond the fence.</p>

<p>"Honest, Penrod&mdash;you ain't goin' to touch me if I come in your
yard?" he called. "Honest?"</p>

<p>"Cross my heart!" answered Penrod, holding the bottle away from
Sam. "And we'll let you drink all you want."</p>

<p>Maurice hastily climbed the fence, and while he was thus occupied
Mr. Samuel Williams received a great enlightenment. With startling
rapidity Penrod, standing just outside the storeroom door, extended
his arm within the room, deposited the licorice water upon the
counter of the drug store, seized in its stead the bottle of smallpox
medicine, and extended it cordially toward the advancing Maurice.</p>

<p>Genius is like that&mdash;great, simple, broad strokes!</p>

<p>Dazzled, Mr. Samuel Williams leaned against the wall. He had
the sensations of one who comes suddenly into the presence of
a chef-d'oeuvre. Perhaps his first coherent thought was that almost
universal one on such huge occasions: "Why couldn't <em>I</em>
have done that!"</p>

<p>Sam might have been even more dazzled had he guessed that he
figured not altogether as a spectator in the sweeping and magnificent
conception of the new Talleyrand. Sam had no partner for the cotillon.
If Maurice was to be absent from that festivity&mdash;as it began to
seem he might be &mdash;Penrod needed a male friend to take care
of Miss Rennsdale and he believed he saw his way to compel Mr.
Williams to be that male friend. For this he relied largely upon
the prospective conduct of Miss Rennsdale when he should get the
matter before her&mdash;he was inclined to believe she would favour
the exchange. As for Talleyrand Penrod himself, he was going to
dance that cotillon with Marjorie Jones!</p>

<p>"You can have all you can drink at one pull, M'rice," said Penrod
kindly.</p>

<p>"You said I could have all I want!" protested Maurice, reaching
for the bottle.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't," returned Penrod quickly, holding it away from
the eager hand.</p>

<p>"He did, too! Didn't he, Sam?"</p>

<p>Sam could not reply; his eyes, fixed upon the bottle, protruded
strangely.</p>

<p>"You heard him&mdash;didn't you, Sam?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I did say it I didn't mean it!" said Penrod hastily,
quoting from one of the authorities. "Looky here, M'rice," he
continued, assuming a more placative and reasoning tone, "that
wouldn't be fair to us. I guess we want some of our own lickrish
water, don't we? The bottle ain't much over two-thirds full anyway.
What I meant was, you can have all you can drink at one pull."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, this way: you can gulp all you want, so long as you keep
swallering; but you can't take the bottle out of your mouth and
commence again. Soon's you quit swallering it's Sam's turn."</p>

<p>"No; you can have next, Penrod," said Sam.</p>

<p>"Well, anyway, I mean M'rice has to give the bottle up the minute
he stops swallering."</p>

<p>Craft appeared upon the face of Maurice, like a poster pasted
on a wall.</p>

<p>"I can drink so long I don't stop swallering?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's it."</p>

<p>"All right!" he cried. "Gimme the bottle!"</p>

<p>And Penrod placed it in his hand.</p>

<p>"You promise to let me drink until I quit swallering?" Maurice
insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes!" said both boys together.</p>

<p>With that, Maurice placed the bottle to his lips and began to
drink. Penrod and Sam leaned forward in breathless excitement.
They had feared Maurice might smell the contents of the bottle;
but that danger was past&mdash;this was the crucial moment. Their fondest
hope was that he would make his first swallow a voracious one&mdash;it
was impossible to imagine a second. They expected one big, gulping
swallow and then an explosion, with fountain effects.</p>

<p>Little they knew the mettle of their man! Maurice swallowed once;
he swallowed twice&mdash;and thrice&mdash;and he continued to swallow! No
Adam's apple was sculptured on that juvenile throat, but the internal
progress of the liquid was not a whit the less visible. His eyes
gleamed with cunning and malicious triumph, sidewise, at the stunned
conspirators; he was fulfilling the conditions of the draught,
not once breaking the thread of that marvelous swallering.</p>

<p>His audience stood petrified. Already Maurice had swallowed more
than they had given Duke and still the liquor receded in the uplifted
bottle! And now the clear glass gleamed above the dark contents
full half the vessel's length&mdash;and Maurice went on drinking! Slowly
the clear glass increased in its dimensions&mdash;slowly the dark diminished.</p>

<p>Sam Williams made a horrified movement to check him&mdash;but Maurice
protested passionately with his disengaged arm, and made vehement
vocal noises remindful of the contract; whereupon Sam desisted
and watched the continuing performance in a state of grisly fascination.</p>

<p>Maurice drank it all! He drained the last drop and threw the
bottle in the air, uttering loud ejaculations of triumph and satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Hah!" he cried, blowing out his cheeks, inflating his chest,
squaring his shoulders, patting his stomach, and wiping his mouth
contentedly. "Hah! Aha! Waha! Wafwah! But that was good!"</p>

<p>The two boys stood looking at him in stupor.</p>

<p>"Well, I gotta say this," said Maurice graciously: "You stuck
to your bargain all right and treated me fair."</p>

<p>Stricken with a sudden horrible suspicion, Penrod entered the
storeroom in one stride and lifted the bottle of licorice water
to his nose&mdash;then to his lips. It was weak, but good; he had made
no mistake. And Maurice had really drained&mdash;to the dregs&mdash;the
bottle of old hair tonics, dead catsups, syrups of undesirable
preserves, condemned extracts of vanilla and lemon, decayed chocolate,
ex-essence of beef, mixed dental preparations, aromatic spirits
of ammonia, spirits of nitre, alcohol, arnica, quinine, ipecac,
sal volatile, nux vomica and licorice water-with traces of arsenic,
belladonna and strychnine.</p>

<p>Penrod put the licorice water out of sight and turned to face
the others. Maurice was seating himself on a box just outside
the door and had taken a package of cigarettes from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Nobody can see me from here, can they?" he said, striking a
match. "You fellers smoke?"</p>

<p>"No," said Sam, staring at him haggardly.</p>

<p>"No," said Penrod in a whisper.</p>

<p>Maurice lit his cigarette and puffed showily.</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he remarked, "you fellers are certainly square &mdash;I
gotta say that much. Honest, Penrod, I thought you was after me!
I did think so," he added sunnily; "but now I guess you like me,
or else you wouldn't of stuck to it about lettin' me drink it
all if I kept on swallering."</p>

<p>He chatted on with complete geniality, smoking his cigarette
in content. And as he ran from one topic to another his hearers
stared at him in a kind of torpor. Never once did they exchange
a glance with each other; their eyes were frozen to Maurice. The
cheerful conversationalist made it evident that he was not without
gratitude.</p>

<p>"Well," he said as he finished his cigarette and rose to go,
"you fellers have treated me nice and some day you come over to
my yard; I'd like to run with you fellers. You're the kind of
fellers I like."</p>

<p>Penrod's jaw fell; Sam's mouth had been open all the time. Neither
spoke.</p>

<p>"I gotta go," observed Maurice, consulting a handsome watch.
"Gotta get dressed for the cotillon right after lunch. Come on,
Sam. Don't you have to go, too?"</p>

<p>Sam nodded dazedly.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Penrod," said Maurice cordially. "I'm glad you
like me all right. Come on, Sam."</p>

<p>Penrod leaned against the doorpost and with fixed and glazing
eyes watched the departure of his two visitors. Maurice was talking
volubly, with much gesticulation, as they went; but Sam walked
mechanically and in silence, staring at his brisk companion and
keeping at a little distance from him.</p>

<p>They passed from sight, Maurice still conversing gayly&mdash;and Penrod
slowly betook himself into the house, his head bowed upon his
chest.</p>

<p>Some three hours later, Mr. Samuel Williams, waxen clean and
in sweet raiment, made his reappearance in Penrod's yard, yodelling
a code-signal to summon forth his friend. He yodelled loud, long,
and frequently, finally securing a faint response from the upper
air.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" shouted Mr. Williams, his roving glance searching
ambient heights. Another low-spirited yodel reaching his ear,
he perceived the head and shoulders of his friend projecting above
the roofridge of the stable. The rest of Penrod's body was concealed
from view, reposing upon the opposite slant of the gable and precariously
secured by the crooking of his elbows over the ridge.</p>

<p>"Yay! What you doin' up there?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'."</p>

<p>"You better be careful!" Sam called. "You'll slide off and fall
down in the alley if you don't look out. I come pert' near it
last time we was up there. Come on down! Ain't you goin' to the
cotillon?"</p>

<p>Penrod made no reply. Sam came nearer.</p>

<p>"Say," he called up in a guarded voice, "I went to our telephone
a while ago and ast him how he was feelin', and he said he felt
fine!"</p>

<p>"So did I," said Penrod. "He told me he felt bully!"</p>

<p>Sam thrust his hands in his pockets and brooded. The opening
of the kitchen door caused a diversion. It was Della.</p>

<p>"Mister Penrod," she bellowed forthwith, "come ahn down fr'm
up there! Y'r mamma's at the dancin' class waitin' fer ye, an'
she's telephoned me they're goin' to begin&mdash;an' what's the matter
with ye? Come ahn down fr'm up there!"</p>

<p>"Come on!" urged Sam. "We'll be late. There go Maurice and Marjorie
now."</p>

<p>A glittering car spun by, disclosing briefly a genre picture
of Marjorie Jones in pink, supporting a monstrous sheaf of American
Beauty roses. Maurice, sitting shining and joyous beside her,
saw both boys and waved them a hearty greeting as the car turned
the corner.</p>

<p>Penrod uttered some muffled words and then waved both arms&mdash;either
in response or as an expression of his condition of mind; it may
have been a gesture of despair. How much intention there was in
this act&mdash;obviously so rash, considering the position he occupied&mdash;it
is impossible to say. Undeniably there must remain a suspicion
of deliberate purpose.</p>

<p>Della screamed and Sam shouted. Penrod had disappeared from view.</p>

<p>The delayed dance was about to begin a most uneven cotillon when
Samuel Williams arrived.</p>

<p>Mrs. Schofield hurriedly left the ballroom; while Miss Rennsdale,
flushing with sudden happiness, curtsied profoundly to Professor
Bartet and obtained his attention.</p>

<p>"I have telled you fifty times," he informed her passionately
ere she spoke, "I cannot make no such changes. If your partner
comes you have to dance with him. You are going to drive me crazy,
sure! What is it? What now? What you want?"</p>

<p>The damsel curtsied again and handed him the following communication,
addressed to herself:</p>

<p>"Dear madam Please excuse me from dancing the cotilon with you
this afternoon as I have fell off the barn</p>

<p>"Sincerly yours</p>

<p>"<em>PENROD SCHOFIELD</em>."</p>
