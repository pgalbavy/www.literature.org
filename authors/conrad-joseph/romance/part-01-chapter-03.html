<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The spirit of the age has changed; everything has changed so
utterly that one can hardly believe in the existence of one's
earlier self. But I can still remember how, at that moment, I
made the acquaintance of my heart&mdash;a thing that bounded and leapt
within my chest, a little sickeningly. The other details I forget.</p>

<p>Jack Rangsley was a tall, big-boned, thin man, with something
sinister in the lines of his horseman's cloak, and something reckless
in the way he set his spurred heel on the ground. He was the son
of an old Marsh squire. Old Rangsley had been head of the last
of the Owlers&mdash;the aristocracy of export smugglers&mdash;and Jack had
sunk a little in becoming the head of the Old Bourne Tap importers.
But he was hard enough, tyrannical enough, and had nerve enough
to keep Free-trading alive in our parts until long after it had
become an anachronism. He ended his days on the gallows, of course,
but that was long afterwards.</p>

<p>"I'd give a dollar to know what's going on in those runners'
heads,"  Rangsley said, pointing back with his crop. He laughed
gayly. The great white face of the quarry rose up pale in the
moonlight; the dusky red fires of the limekilns glowed at the
base, sending up a blood-red dust of sullen smoke. "I'll swear
they think they've dropped straight into hell.</p>

<p>"You'll have to cut the country, John," he added suddenly, "they'll
have got your name uncommon pat. I did my best for you." He had
had me tied up like that before the runners' eyes in order to
take their suspicions off me. He had made a pretence to murder
me with the same idea. But he didn't believe they were taken in.
"There'll be warrants out before morning, if they ain't too shaken.
But what were you doing in the business? The two Spaniards were
lying in the fern looking on when you come blundering your clumsy
nose in. If it hadn't been for Rooksby you might have<hr> Hullo,
there!" he broke off.</p>

<p>An answer came from the black shadow of a clump of roadside elms.
I made out the forms of three or four horses standing with their
heads together.</p>

<p>"Come along," Rangsley said; "up with you. We'll talk as we go."</p>

<p>Someone helped me into a saddle; my legs trembled in the stirrups
as if I had ridden a thousand miles on end already. I imagine
I must have fallen into a stupor; for I have only a vague impression
of somebody's exculpating himself to me. As a matter of fact,
Ralph, after having egged me on, in the intention of staying at
home, had had qualms of conscience, and had come to the quarry.
It was he who had cried the watchword, "Snuff and enough," and
who had held the whispered consultation. Carlos and Castro had
waited in their hiding-place, having been spectators of the arrival
of the runners and of my capture. I gathered this long afterwards.
At that moment I was conscious only of the motion of the horse
beneath me, of intense weariness, and of the voice of Ralph, who
was lamenting his own cowardice.</p>

<p>"If it had come at any other time!" he kept on repeating. "But
now, with Veronica to think of!<hr> You take me, Johnny, don't
you?"</p>

<p>My companions rode silently. After we had passed the houses of
a little village a heavy mist fell upon us, white, damp, and clogging.
Ralph reined his horse beside mine.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," he began again, "I'm miserably sorry I got you into
this scrape. I swear I wouldn't have had it happen, not for a
thousand pounds&mdash;not for ten."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter," I said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Ah, but," Rooksby said, "you'll have to leave the country for
a time. Until I can arrange. I will. You can trust me."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll have to leave the country, for sure," Rangsley said
jovially, "if he wants to live it down. There's five-and-forty
warrants out against me&mdash;but they dursent serve 'em. But he's
not me."</p>

<p>"It's a miserable business," Ralph said. He had an air of the
profoundest dejection. In the misty light he looked like a man
mortally wounded, riding from a battle-field.</p>

<p>"Let him come with us," the musical voice of Carlos came through
the mist in front of us. "He shall see the world a little."</p>

<p>"For God's sake hold your tongue!" Ralph answered him. "There's
mischief enough. He shall go to France."</p>

<p>"Oh, let the young blade rip about the world for a year or two,
squire,"  Rangsley's voice said from behind us.</p>

<p>In the end Ralph let me go with Carlos&mdash;actually across the sea,
and to the West Indies. I begged and implored him; it seemed that
now there was a chance for me to find my world of romance. And
Ralph, who, though one of the most law-respecting of men, was
not for the moment one of the most valorous, was wild to wash
his hands of the whole business. He did his best for me; he borrowed
a goodly number of guineas from Rangsley, who travelled with a
bag of them at his saddle-bow, ready to pay his men their seven
shillings a head for the run.</p>

<p>Ralph remembered, too&mdash;or I remembered for him&mdash;that he had estates
and an agent in Jamaica, and he turned into the big inn at the
junction of the London road to write a letter to his agent bidding
him house me and employ me as an improver. For fear of compromising
him we waited in the shadow of trees a furlong or two down the
road. He came at a trot, gave me the letter, drew me aside, and
began upbraiding himself again. The others rode onwards.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," I said. "It's fine&mdash;it's fine. I'd have
given fifty guineas for this chance this morning&mdash;and, Ralph,
I say, you may tell Veronica why I'm going, but keep a shut mouth
to my mother. Let her think I've run away&mdash;eh? Don't spoil your
chance."</p>

<p>He was in such a state of repentance and flutter that he could
not let me take a decent farewell. The sound of the others' horses
had long died away down the hill when he began to tell me what
he ought to have done.</p>

<p>"I knew it at once after I'd let you go. I ought to have kept
you out of it. You came near being murdered. And to think of it&mdash;you,
her brother&mdash;to be<hr>"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," I said gayly, "it's all right. You've to
stand by Veronica. I've no one to my back. Good-night, good-by."</p>

<p>I pulled my horse's head round and galloped down the hill. The
main body had halted before setting out over the shingle to the
shore. Rangsley was waiting to conduct us into the town, where
we should find a man to take us three fugitives out to the expected
ship. We rode clattering aggressively through the silence of the
long, narrow main street. Every now and then Carlos Riego coughed
lamentably, but Tomas Castro rode in gloomy silence. There was
a light here and there in a window, but not a soul stirring abroad.
On the blind of an inn the shadow of a bearded man held the shadow
of a rummer to its mouth.</p>

<p>"That'll be my uncle," Rangsley said. "He'll be the man to do
your errand." He called to one of the men behind. "Here, Joe Pilcher,
do you go into the White Hart and drag my Uncle Tom out. Bring
'un up to me&mdash;to the nest."</p>

<p>Three doors further on we came to a halt, and got down from our
horses.</p>

<p>Rangsley knocked on a shutter-panel, two hard knocks with the
crop and three with the naked fist. Then a lock clicked, heavy
bars rumbled, and a chain rattled. Rangsley pushed me through
the doorway. A side door opened, and I saw into a lighted room
filled with wreaths of smoke. A paunchy man in a bob wig, with
a blue coat and Windsor buttons, holding a churchwarden pipe in
his right hand and a pewter quart in his left, came towards us.</p>

<p>"Hullo, captain," he said, "you'll be too late with the lights,
won't you?" He had a deprecatory air.</p>

<p>"Your watch is fast, Mr. Mayor," Rangsley answered surlily; "the
tide won't serve for half an hour yet."</p>

<p>"Cht, cht," the other wheezed. "No offence. We respect you. But
still, when one has a stake, one likes to know."</p>

<p>"My stake's all I have, and my neck," Rangsley said impatiently;
"what's yours? A matter of fifty pun ten?... Why don't you make
them bring they lanthorns?"</p>

<p>A couple of dark lanthorns were passed to Rangsley, who half-uncovered
one, and lit the way up steep wooden stairs. We climbed up to
a tiny cock-loft, of which the side towards the sea was all glazed.</p>

<p>"Now you sit there, on the floor," Rangsley commanded; "can't
leave you below; the runners will be coming to the mayor for new
warrants to-morrow, and he'd not like to have spent the night
in your company."</p>

<p>He threw a casement open. The moon was hidden from us by clouds,
but, a long way off, over the distant sea, there was an irregular
patch of silver light, against which the chimneys of the opposite
houses were silhouetted. The church clock began muffledly to chime
the quarters behind us; then the hour struck&mdash;ten strokes.</p>

<p>Rangsley set one of his lanthorns on the window and twisted the
top. He sent beams of yellow light shooting out to seawards. His
hands quivered, and he was mumbling to himself under the influence
of ungovernable excitement. His stakes were very large, and all
depended on the flicker of those lanthorns out towards the men
on the luggers that were hidden in the black expanse of the sea.
Then he waited, and against the light of the window I could see
him mopping his forehead with the sleeve of his coat; my heart
began to beat softly and insistently&mdash;out of sympathy.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the deep shadow of the cloud above the sea, a
yellow light flashed silently cut&mdash;very small, very distant, very
short-lived. Rangsley heaved a deep sigh and slapped me heavily
on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"All serene, my buck," he said; "now let's see after you. I've
half an hour. What's the ship?"</p>

<p>I was at a loss, but Carlos said out of the darkness, "The ship
the <em>Thames</em>. My friend Señor Ortiz, of the Minories, said
you would know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know," Rangsley said softly; and, indeed, he did
know all that was to be known about smuggling out of the southern
counties of people who could no longer inhabit them. The trade
was a survival of the days of Jacobite plots. "And it's a hanging
job, too. But it's no affair of mine." He stopped and reflected
for an instant.</p>

<p>I could feel Carlos' eyes upon us, looking out of the thick darkness.
A slight rustling came from the corner that hid Castro.</p>

<p>"She passes down channel to-night, then?" Rangsley said. "With
this wind you'll want to be well out in the Bay at a quarter after
eleven."</p>

<p>An abnormal scuffling, intermingled with snatches of jovial remonstrance,
made itself heard from the bottom of the ladder. A voice called
up through the hatch, "Here's your uncle, Squahre Jack," and a
husky murmur corroborated.</p>

<p>"Be you drunk again, you old sinner?" Rangsley asked. "Listen
to me.... Here's three men to be set aboard the <em>Thames</em>
at a quarter after eleven."</p>

<p>A grunt came in reply.</p>

<p>Rangsley repeated slowly.</p>

<p>The grunt answered again.</p>

<p>"Here's three men to be set aboard the <em>Thames</em> at a quarter
after eleven. . . ." Rangsley said again.</p>

<p>"Here's... a-cop... three men to be set aboard <em>Thames</em>
at quarter after eleven," a voice hiccoughed back to us.</p>

<p>"Well, see you do it," Rangsley said. "He's as drunk as a king," 
he commented to us; "but when you've said a thing three times,
he remembers&mdash;hark to him."</p>

<p>The drunken voice from below kept up a constant babble of, "Three
men to be set aboard <em>Thames</em>... three men to be set .
. ."</p>

<p>"He'll not stop saying that till he has you safe aboard," Rangsley
said. He showed a glimmer of light down the ladder &mdash;Carlos
and Castro descended. I caught sight below me of the silver head
and the deep red ears of the drunken uncle of Rangsley. He had
been one of the most redoubtable of the family, a man of immense
strength and cunning, but a confirmed habit of consuming a pint
and a half of gin a night had made him disinclined for the more
arduous tasks of the trade. He limited his energies to working
the underground passage, to the success of which his fox-like
cunning, and intimate knowledge of the passing shipping, were
indispensable. I was preparing to follow the others down the ladder
when Rangsley touched my arm.</p>

<p>"I don't like your company," he said close behind my ear. "I
know who they are. There were bills out for them this morning.
I'd blow them, and take the reward, but for you and Squahre Rooksby.
They're handy with their knives, too, I fancy. You mind me, and
look to yourself with them. There's something unnatural."</p>

<p>His words had a certain effect upon me, and his manner perhaps
more. A thing that was "unnatural" to Jack Rangsley&mdash;the man of
darkness, who lived forever as if in the shadow of the gallows&mdash;was
a thing to be avoided. He was for me nearly as romantic a figure
as Carlos himself, but for his forbidding darkness, and he was
a person of immense power. The silent flittings of lights that
I had just seen, the answering signals from the luggers far out
to sea, the enforced sleep of the towns and countryside whilst
his plans were working out at night, had impressed me with a sense
of awe. And his words sank into my spirit, and made me afraid
for my future.</p>

<p>We followed the others downwards into a ground-floor room that
was fitted up as a barber's shop. A rushlight was burning on a
table. Rangsley took hold of a piece of wainscotting, part of
the frame of a panel; he pulled it towards him, and, at the same
moment, a glazed show-case full of razors and brushes swung noiselessly
forward with an effect of the supernatural. A small opening, just
big enough to take a man's body, revealed itself. We passed through
it and up a sort of tunnel. The door at the other end, which was
formed of panels, had a manger and straw crib attached to it on
the outside, and let us into a horse's stall. We found ourselves
in the stable of the inn.</p>

<p>"We don't use this passage for ourselves," Rangsley said. "Only
the most looked up to need to&mdash;the justices and such like. But
gallus birds like you and your company, it's best for us not to
be seen in company with. Follow my uncle now. Good-night."</p>

<p>We went into the yard, under the pillars of the town hall, across
the silent street, through a narrow passage, and down to the sea.
Old Rangsley reeled ahead of us swiftly, muttering, "Three men
to be set aboard the <em>Thames</em>... quarter past eleven. Three
men to be set aboard..." and in a few minutes we stood upon the
shingle beside the idle sea, that was nearly at the full.</p>
