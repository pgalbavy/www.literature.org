<p>"Second act, ladies and gentlemen!" cried Packer, at precisely
ten o'clock the next morning.</p>

<p>About a dozen actors were chatting in small groups upon the stage;
three or four paced singly, muttering and mildly gesticulating,
with the fretful preoccupation of people trying to remember; two
or three, seated, bent over their typewritten "sides," studying
intently; and a few, invisible from the auditorium, were scattered
about the rearward rooms and passageways. Talbot Potter, himself,
was nowhere to be seen, and, what was even more important to one
tumultuously beating heart "in front," neither was Wanda Malone.
Mr. Stewart Canby in a silvery new suit, wearing a white border
to his waistcoat collar and other decorations proper to a new
playwright, sat in the centre of the front row of the orchestra.
Yesterday he had taken a seat about nine rows back.</p>

<p>He bore no surface signs of the wear and tear of a witches' night;
riding his runaway play and fighting the enchantment that was
upon him. Elastic twenty-seven does not mark a bedless session
with violet arcs below its eyes;&mdash;what violet a witch had used
upon Stewart Canby this morning appeared as a dewey boutonniere
in the lapel of his new coat; he was that far gone.</p>

<p>Miss Ellsling and a youth of the company took their places near
the front of the stage and began the rehearsal of the second act
with a dialogue that led up to the entrance of the star with the
"ingenue,"  both of whom still remained out of the playwright's
range of vision.</p>

<p>As the moment for their appearance drew near, Canby became, to
his own rage, almost uncontrollably agitated. Miss Ellsling's
scene, which he should have followed carefully, meant nothing
to him but a ticking off of the seconds before he should behold
with his physical eyes the living presence of the fairy ghost
that had put a spell upon him. He was tremulous all over.</p>

<p>Miss Ellsling and her companion came to a full stop and stood
waiting. Thereupon Packer went to the rear of the stage, leaned
through an open doorway, and spoke deferentially:</p>

<p>"Mr. Potter? All ready, sir. All ready, Miss&mdash;ah &mdash;Malone?"</p>

<p>Then he stepped back with the air of an unimportant person making
way for his betters to pass before him, while Canby's eyes fixed
themselves glassily upon the shabby old doorway through which
an actual, breathing Wanda Malone was to come.</p>

<p>But he was destined not to see her appear in that expectant frame.
Twenty years before&mdash;though he had forgotten it&mdash;in a dazzling
room where there was a Christmas tree, he had uttered a shriek
of ecstatic timidity just as a jingling Santa Claus began to emerge
from behind the tree, and he had run out of the room and out of
the house. He did exactly the same thing now, though this time
the shriek was not vocal.</p>

<p>Suffocating, he fled up the aisle and out into the lobby. There
he addressed himself distractedly but plainly:</p>

<p>"Jackass!"</p>

<p>Breathing heavily, he went out to the wide front steps of the
theatre and stood, sunlit Broadway swimming before him.</p>

<p>"Hello, Canby!"</p>

<p>A shabby, shaggy, pale young man, with hot eyes, checked his
ardent gait and paused, extending a cordial, thin hand, the fingers
browned at the sides by cigarettes smoked to the bitter end. "Rieger,"
he said. "Arnold Rieger. Remember me at the old Ink Club meetings
before we broke up?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Canby dimly. "Yes. The old Ink Club. I came out for
a breath of air. Just a breath."</p>

<p>"We used to settle the universe in that little back restaurant
room,"  said Rieger. "Not one of use had ever got a thing into
print&mdash;and me, I haven't yet, for that matter. Editors still hate
my stuff. I've kept my oath, though; I've never compromised&mdash;never
for a moment."</p>

<p>"Yes," Canby responded feebly, wondering what the man was talking
about. Wanda Malone was surely on the stage, now. If he turned,
walked about thirty feet, and opened a door, he would see her&mdash;hear
her speaking!</p>

<p>"I've had news of your success," said Rieger. "I saw in the paper
that Talbot Potter was to put on a play you'd written. I congratulate
you. That man's a great artist, but he never seems to get a good
play; he's always much, much greater than his part. I'm sure you've
given him a real play at last. I remember your principles: Realism;
no compromise! The truth; no shirking it, no tampering with it!
You've struck out for that&mdash;you've never compro&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Oh, no," said Canby, waking up a little. "Of course you've
got to make a little change or two in plays. You see, you've got
to make an actor like a play or he won't play it, and if he won't
play it you haven't got any play&mdash;you've only got some typewriting."</p>

<p>Rieger set his foot upon the step and rested his left forearm
upon his knee, and attitude comfortable for street debate. "Admitting
the truth of that for the sake of argument, and only for the moment,
because I don't for one instant accept such a jesuitism&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Canby dreamily. "Yes." And, with not only apparent
but genuine unconsciousness of this one-time friend's existence,
he turned and walked back into the lobby, and presently was vaguely
aware that somebody near the street doors of the theatre seemed
to be in a temper. Somebody kept shouting "Swell-headed pup!"
and "Go to the devil!"  at somebody else repeatedly, but finally
went away, after reaching a vociferous climax of even harsher
epithets and instructions.</p>

<p>The departure of this raging unknown left the lobby quiet; Canby
had gone near to the inner doors. Listening fearfully, he heard
through these a murmurous baritone cadencing: Talbot Potter declaiming
the inwardness of "Roderick Hanscom"; and then&mdash;oh, bells of Elfland
faintly chiming!&mdash;the voice of Wanda Malone!</p>

<p>He pressed, trembling, against the doors, and went in.</p>

<p>Talbot Potter and Wanda Malone stood together, the two alone
in the great hollow space of the stage. The actors of the company,
silent and remote, watched them; old Tinker, halfway down an aisle,
stood listening; and near the proscenium two workmen, tools in
their hands, had paused in attitudes of arrested motion. Save
for the voices of the two players, the whole vast cavern of the
theatre was as still as the very self of silence. And the stirless
air that filled it was charged with necromancy.</p>

<p>Rehearsal is like the painted canvas without a frame; it is more
like a plaster cast, most like of all to the sculptor's hollow
moulds. It needs the bronze to bring a statue to life, and it
needs the audience to bring a play to life. Some glamour must
come from one to the other; some wind of enchantment must blow
between them&mdash;there must be a magic spell. But these two actors
had produced the spell without the audience.</p>

<p>And yet they were only reading a wistful little love-scene that
Stewart Canby had written the night before.</p>

<p>Two people were falling in love with each other, neither realizing
it. And these two who played the lovers had found some hidden
rhythm that brought them together in one picture as a chord is
one sound. They played to each other and with each other instinctively;
Talbot Potter had forgotten "the smile" and all the mechanism
that went with it. The two held the little breathless silences
of lovers; they broke these silences timidly, and then their movements
and voices ran together like waters in a fountain. A radiance
was about them as it is about all lovers; they were suffused with
it.</p>

<p>To Stewart Canby, watching, they seemed to move within a sorcerer's
circle of enchantment. Upon his disturbed mind there was dawning
a conviction that these inspired mummers were beings apart from
him, knowing things he never could know, feeling things he never
could feel, belonging to another planet whither he could never
voyage, where strange winds blew and all things lived and grew
in a light beyond his understanding. For the light that shone
in the faces of these two was "the light that never was, on sea
or land."</p>

<p>It had its blessing for him. From that moment, if he had known
it, this play, which was being born of so many parents, was certain
of "success,"  of "popularity," and of what quality of renown
such things may bring. And he who was to be called its author
stood there a Made Man, unless some accident befell.</p>

<p>Miss Ellsling spoke and came forward, another actor with her.
The scene was over. There was a clearing of throats; everybody
moved. The stage-carpenter and his assistant went away blinking,
like men roused from deep sleep. The routine of rehearsal resumed
its place; and old Tinker, who had not stirred a muscle, rubbed
the back of his neck suddenly, and came up the aisle to Canby.</p>

<p>"Good business!" he cried. "Did you see that little run off the
stage she made when Miss Ellsling came on? And you saw what he
can do when he wants to!"</p>

<p>"He?" Canby echoed. "He?"</p>

<p>"Played for the scene instead of himself. Oh, he can do it! He's
an old hand&mdash;got too many tricks in the bag to let her get the
piece away from him&mdash;but he's found a girl that can play with
him at last, and he'll use every value she's got. He knows good
property when he sees it. She's got a pretty good box of tricks
herself; stock's the way to learn 'em, but it's apt to take the
bloom off. It hasn't taken off any of hers, the darlin'! What
do you think, Mr. Canby?"</p>

<p>To Canby, who hardly noticed that this dead old man had come
to life, the speech was jargon. The playwright was preoccupied
with the fact that Talbot Potter was still on the stage, would
continue there until the rather distant end of the act, and that
the "ingenue," after completing the little run at her exit, had
begun to study the manuscript of her part, and in that absorption
had disappeared through a door into the rear passageway. Canby
knew that she was not to be "on" again until the next act, and
he followed a desperate impulse.</p>

<p>"See a person," he mumbled, and went out through the lobby, turned
south to the cross-street, proceeded thereby to the stage-door
of the theatre, and resolutely crossed the path of the distrustful
man who lounged there.</p>

<p>"Here!" called the distrustful man.</p>

<p>"I'm with the show," said Canby, an expression foreign to his
lips and a clear case of inspiration. The distrustful man waved
him on.</p>

<p>Wanda Malone was leaning against the wall at the other end of
the passageway, studying her manuscript. She did not look up until
he paused beside her.</p>

<p>"Miss Malone," he began. "I have come&mdash;I have come &mdash;I have-ah&mdash;"</p>

<p>These were his first words to her. She did nothing more than
look at him inquiringly, but with such radiance that he floundered
to a stop. There were only two things within his power to do:
he had either to cough or to speak much too sweetly.</p>

<p>"There's a draught here," she said, Christian anxiety roused
by the paroxysm which rescued him from the damning alternative.
"You oughtn't to stand here perhaps, Mr. Canby."</p>

<p>"'Canby?'" he repeated inquiringly, the name seeming new to him.
"Canby?"</p>

<p>"You're Mr. Canby, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I meant where&mdash;who&mdash;" he stammered. "How did you know?"</p>

<p>"The stage-manager pointed you out to me yesterday at rehearsal.
I was so excited! You're the first author I ever saw, you see.
I've been in stock where we don't see authors."</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;like it?" he said. "I mean stock. Do you like stock?
How much do you like stock? I ah&mdash;" Again he fell back upon the
faithful old device of nervous people since the world began.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you oughtn't to stand in this passageway," she urged.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said hurriedly. "I love it! I love it! I haven't
any cold. It's the air. That's what does it." He nodded brightly,
with the expression of a man who knows the answer to everything.
"It's bad for me."</p>

<p>"Then you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," he said, and went back to the beginning. "I have come &mdash;I
wanted to come &mdash;I wished to say that I wi&mdash;" He put forth
a manful effort which made him master of the speech he had planned.
"I want to thank you for the way you play your part. What I wrote
seemed dry stuff, but when you act it, why, then, it seems to
be&mdash;beautiful!"</p>

<p>"Oh! Do you think so?" she cried, her eyes bedewing ineffably.
"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>oh!&mdash;" He got no further, and, although
a stranger to the context of this conversation might have supposed
him to be speaking of a celebrated commonwealth, Mother of Presidents,
his meaning was sufficiently clear to Wanda Malone.</p>

<p>"You're lovely to me," she said, wiping her eyes. "Lovely! I'll
never forget it! I'll never forget anything that's happened to
me all this beautiful, beautiful week!"</p>

<p>The little kerchief she had lifted to her eyes was wet with tears
not of the stage. "It seems so foolish!" she said bravely. "It's
because I'm so happy! Everything has come all at once, this week.
I'd never been in New York before in my life. Doesn't that seem
funny for a girl that's been on the stage ever since she left
school? And now I am here, all at once I get this beautiful part
you've written, and you tell me you like it&mdash;and Mr. Potter says
he likes it. Oh! Mr. Potter's just beautiful to me! Don't you
think Mr. Potter's wonderful, Mr. Canby?"</p>

<p>The truth about Mr. Canby's opinion of Mr. Potter at this moment
was not to the playwright's credit. However, he went only so far
as to say: "I didn't like him much yesterday afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" she said quickly. "That was every bit my fault.
I was frightened and it made me stupid. And he's just beautiful
to me to-day! But I'd never mind anything from a man that works
with you as he does. It's the most wonderful thing! To a woman
who loves her profession for its own sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You do, Miss Malone?"</p>

<p>"Love it?" she cried. "Is there anything like it in the world?"</p>

<p>"I might have known you felt that, from your acting," he said,
managing somehow to be coherent, though it was difficult.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we all do!" she protested eagerly. "I believe all actors
love it more than they love life itself. Don't think I mean those
that never grew up out of their 'show-off' time in childhood.
Those don't count, in what I mean, any more than the 'show-girls'
and heaven knows what not that the newspapers call 'actresses'.
Oh, Mr. Canby, I mean the people with the art and the fire born
in them: those who must come to the stage and who ought to and
who do. It isn't because we want to be 'looked at' that we go
on the stage and starve to stay there! It's because we want to
make pictures&mdash;to make pictures of characters in plays for people
in audiences. It's like being a sculptor or painter; only we paint
and model with ourselves&mdash;and we're different from sculptors and
painters because they do their work in quiet studios, while we
do ours under the tension of great crowds watching every stroke
we make&mdash;and, oh, the exhilaration when they show us we make the
right stroke!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he said. "Bravo!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it the greatest of all the arts? Isn't it?" she went on
with the same glowing eagerness. "We feed our nerves to it, and
our lives to it, and are glad! It makes us different from other
people. But what of that? Don't we give ourselves? Don't we live
and die just to make these pictures for the world? Oughtn't the
world to be thankful for us? Oughtn't it? Oh, it is, Mr. Canby;
it is thankful for us; and I, for one, never forget that a Prime
Minister of England was proud to warm Davy Garrick's breeches
at the grate for him!"</p>

<p>She clapped her hands together in a gesture of such spirit and
fire that Canby could have thrown his hat in the air and cheered,
she had lifted him so clear of his timidity.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he cried again. "Bravo!"</p>

<p>At that she blushed. "What a little goose I am!" she cried. "Playing
the orator! Mr. Canby, you mustn't mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I won't!"</p>

<p>"It's because I'm so happy," she explained&mdash;to his way of thinking,
divinely. "I'm so happy I just pour out everything. I want to
sing every minute. You see, it seemed such a long while that I
was waiting for my chance. Some of us wait forever, Mr. Canby,
and I was so afraid mine might never come. If it hadn't come now
it might never have come. If I'd missed this one, I might never
have had another. It frightens me to think of it&mdash;and I oughtn't
to be thinking of it! I ought to be spending all my time on my
knees thanking God that old Mr. Packer got it into his head that
'The Little Minister' was a play about the Baptists!"</p>

<p>"I don't see&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If he hadn't," she said, "I wouldn't be here!"</p>

<p>"God bless old Mr. Packer!"</p>

<p>"I hope you mean it, Mr. Canby." She blushed again, because there
was no possible doubt that he meant it. "It seems a miracle to
me that I am here, and that my chance is here with me, at last.
It's twice as good a chance as it was yesterday, thanks to you.
You've given me such beautiful new things to do and such beautiful
new things to say. How I'll work at it! After rehearsal this afternoon
I'll learn every word of it in the tunnel before I get to my station
in Brooklyn. That's funny, too, isn't it; the first time I've
ever been to New York I go and board over in Brooklyn! But it's
a beautiful place to study, and by the time I get home I'll know
the lines and have all the rest of the time for the real work:
trying to make myself into a faraway picture of the adorable girl
you had in your mind when you wrote it. You see&mdash;"</p>

<p>She checked herself again. "Oh! Oh!" she said, half-laughing,
half-ashamed. "I've never talked so much in my life! You see it
seems to me that the whole world has just burst into bloom!"</p>

<p>She radiated a happiness that was almost tangible; it was a glow
so real it seemed to warm and light that dingy old passageway.
Certainly it warmed and lighted the young man who stood there
with her. For him, too, the whole world was transfigured, and
life just an orchard to walk through in perpetual April morning.</p>

<p>The voice of Packer proclaimed: "Two o'clock, ladies and gentlemen!
Rehearsal two o'clock this afternoon!"</p>

<p>The next moment he looked into the passageway. "This afternoon's
rehearsal, two o'clock, Miss&mdash;ahh &mdash;Malone. Oh, Mr. Canby,
Mr. Potter wants you to go to lunch with him and Mr. Tinker. He's
waiting. This way, Mr. Canby."</p>

<p>"In a moment," said the young playwright. "Miss Malone, you spoke
of your going home to work at making yourself into 'the adorable
girl' I had in my mind when I wrote your part. It oughtn't"&mdash;he
faltered, growing red&mdash;"it oughtn't to take much&mdash;much work!"</p>

<p>And, breathless, he followed the genially waiting Packer.</p>
