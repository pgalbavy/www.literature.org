<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I ran till my breath grew short, for some kind of swift motion
I had to have or choke.  The events of the last few minutes had
inflamed my brain.  For the first time in my life I had seen men
die by violence&mdash;nay, by brutal murder.  I had put my soul into
the blow which laid out Henriques, and I was still hot with the
pride of it.  Also I had in my pocket the fetich of the whole
black world; I had taken their Ark of the Covenant, and soon Laputa
would be on my trail.  Fear, pride, and a blind exultation all
throbbed in my veins.  I must have run three miles before I came
to my sober senses.</p>

<p>I put my ear to the ground, but heard no sound of pursuit. Laputa,
I argued, would have enough to do for a little, shepherding his
flock over the water.  He might surround and capture the patrol,
or he might evade it; the vow prevented him from fighting it. 
On the whole I was clear that he would ignore it and push on for
the rendezvous.  All this would take time, and the business of
the priest would have to wait. When Henriques came to he would
no doubt have a story to tell, and the scouts would be on my trail. 
I wished I had shot the Portugoose while I was at the business. 
It would have been no murder, but a righteous execution.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I must get off the road.  The sand had been disturbed
by an army, so there was little fear of my steps being traced. 
Still it was only wise to leave the track which I would be assumed
to have taken, for Laputa would guess I had fled back the way
to Blaauwildebeestefontein.  I turned into the bush, which here
was thin and sparse like whins on a common.</p>

<p>The Berg must be my goal.  Once on the plateau I would be inside
the white man's lines.  Down here in the plains I was in the country
of my enemies.  Arcoll meant to fight on the uplands when it came
to fighting.  The black man might rage as he pleased in his own
flats, but we stood to defend the gates of the hills.  Therefore
over the Berg I must be before morning, or there would be a dead
man with no tales to tell.</p>

<p>I think that even at the start of that night's work I realized
the exceeding precariousness of my chances.  Some twenty miles
of bush and swamp separated me from the foot of the mountains. 
After that there was the climbing of them, for at the point opposite
where I now stood the Berg does not descend sharply on the plain,
but is broken into foot-hills around the glens of the Klein Letaba
and the Letsitela. From the spot where these rivers emerge on
the flats to the crown of the plateau is ten miles at the shortest. 
I had a start of an hour or so, but before dawn I had to traverse
thirty miles of unknown and difficult country.  Behind me would
follow the best trackers in Africa, who knew every foot of the
wilderness. It was a wild hazard, but it was my only hope.  At
this time I was feeling pretty courageous.  For one thing I had
Henriques' pistol close to my leg, and for another I still thrilled
with the satisfaction of having smitten his face.</p>

<p>I took the rubies, and stowed them below my shirt and next my
skin.  I remember taking stock of my equipment and laughing at
the humour of it. One of the heels was almost twisted off my boots,
and my shirt and breeches were old at the best and ragged from
hard usage.  The whole outfit would have been dear at five shillings,
or seven-and-six with the belt thrown in.  Then there was the
Portugoose's pistol, costing, say, a guinea; and last, the Prester's
collar, worth several millions.</p>

<p>What was more important than my clothing was my bodily strength. 
I was still very sore from the bonds and the jog of that accursed
horse, but exercise was rapidly suppling my joints.  About five
hours ago I had eaten a filling, though not very sustaining, meal,
and I thought I could go on very well till morning.  But I was
still badly in arrears with my sleep, and there was no chance
of my snatching a minute till I was over the Berg.  It was going
to be a race against time, and I swore that I would drive my body
to the last ounce of strength.</p>

<p>Moonrise was still an hour or two away, and the sky was bright
with myriad stars.  I knew now what starlight meant, for there
was ample light to pick my way by.  I steered by the Southern
Cross, for I was aware that the Berg ran north and south, and
with that constellation on my left hand I was bound to reach it
sooner or later.  The bush closed around me with its mysterious
dull green shades, and trees, which in the daytime were thin scrub,
now loomed like tall timber.  It was very eerie moving, a tiny
fragment of mortality, in that great wide silent wilderness, with
the starry vault, like an impassive celestial audience, watching
with many eyes.  They cheered me, those stars.  In my hurry and
fear and passion they spoke of the old calm dignities of man. 
I felt less alone when I turned my face to the lights which were
slanting alike on this uncanny bush and on the homely streets
of Kirkcaple.</p>

<p>The silence did not last long.  First came the howl of a wolf,
to be answered by others from every quarter of the compass. This
serenade went on for a bit, till the jackals chimed in with their
harsh bark.  I had been caught by darkness before this when hunting
on the Berg, but I was not afraid of wild beasts. That is one
terror of the bush which travellers' tales have put too high. 
It was true that I might meet a hungry lion, but the chance was
remote, and I had my pistol.  Once indeed a huge animal bounded
across the road a little in front of me. For a moment I took him
for a lion, but on reflection I was inclined to think him a very
large bush-pig.</p>

<p>By this time I was out of the thickest bush and into a piece
of parkland with long, waving tambuki grass, which the Kaffirs
would burn later.  The moon was coming up, and her faint rays
silvered the flat tops of the mimosa trees.  I could hear and
feel around me the rustling of animals.  Once or twice a big buck&mdash;an
eland or a koodoo&mdash;broke cover, and at the sight of me went off
snorting down the slope.  Also there were droves of smaller game&mdash;rhebok
and springbok and duikers&mdash;which brushed past at full gallop without
even noticing me.</p>

<p>The sight was so novel that it set me thinking.  That shy wild
things should stampede like this could only mean that they had
been thoroughly scared.  Now obviously the thing that scared them
must be on this side of the Letaba.  This must mean that Laputa's
army, or a large part of it, had not crossed at Dupree's Drift,
but had gone up the stream to some higher ford.  If that was so,
I must alter my course; so I bore away to the right for a mile
or two, making a line due north-west.</p>

<p>In about an hour's time the ground descended steeply, and I saw
before me the shining reaches of a river.  I had the chief features
of the countryside clear in my mind, both from old porings over
maps, and from Arcoll's instructions.  This stream must be the
Little Letaba, and I must cross it if I would get to the mountains. 
I remembered that Majinje's kraal stood on its left bank, and
higher up in its valley in the Berg 'Mpefu lived. At all costs
the kraals must be avoided.  Once across it I must make for the
Letsitela, another tributary of the Great Letaba, and by keeping
the far bank of that stream I should cross the mountains to the
place on the plateau of the Wood Bush which Arcoll had told me
would be his headquarters.</p>

<p>It is easy to talk about crossing a river, and looking to-day
at the slender streak on the map I am amazed that so small a thing
should have given me such ugly tremors.  Yet I have rarely faced
a job I liked so little.  The stream ran yellow and sluggish under
the clear moon.  On the near side a thick growth of bush clothed
the bank, but on the far side I made out a swamp with tall bulrushes. 
The distance across was no more than fifty yards, but I would
have swum a mile more readily in deep water.  The place stank
of crocodiles.  There was no ripple to break the oily flow except
where a derelict branch swayed with the current.  Something in
the stillness, the eerie light on the water, and the rotting smell
of the swamp made that stream seem unhallowed and deadly.</p>

<p>I sat down and considered the matter.  Crocodiles had always
terrified me more than any created thing, and to be dragged by
iron jaws to death in that hideous stream seemed to me the most
awful of endings.  Yet cross it I must if I were to get rid of
my human enemies.  I remembered a story of an escaped prisoner
during the war who had only the Komati River between him and safety. 
But he dared not enter it, and was recaptured by a Boer commando. 
I was determined that such cowardice should not be laid to my
charge.  If I was to die, I would at least have given myself every
chance of life. So I braced myself as best I could, and looked
for a place to enter.</p>

<p>The veld-craft I had mastered had taught me a few things. One
was that wild animals drink at night, and that they have regular
drinking places.  I thought that the likeliest place for crocodiles
was at or around such spots, and, therefore, I resolved to take
the water away from a drinking place.  I went up the bank, noting
where the narrow bush-paths emerged on the water-side.  I scared
away several little buck, and once the violent commotion in the
bush showed that I had frightened some bigger animal, perhaps
a hartebeest.  Still following the bank I came to a reach where
the undergrowth was unbroken and the water looked deeper.</p>

<p>Suddenly &mdash;I fear I must use this adverb often, for all
the happenings on that night were sudden &mdash;I saw a biggish
animal break through the reeds on the far side.  It entered the
water and, whether wading or swimming I could not see, came out
a little distance.  Then some sense must have told it of my presence,
for it turned and with a grunt made its way back.</p>

<p>I saw that it was a big wart-hog, and began to think.  Pig, unlike
other beasts, drink not at night, but in the daytime. The hog
had, therefore, not come to drink, but to swim across. Now, I
argued, he would choose a safe place, for the wart-hog, hideous
though he is, is a wise beast.  What was safe for him would, therefore,
in all likelihood be safe for me.</p>

<p>With this hope to comfort me I prepared to enter.  My first care
was the jewels, so, feeling them precarious in my shirt, I twined
the collar round my neck and clasped it.  The snake-clasp was
no flimsy device of modern jewellery, and I had no fear but that
it would hold. I held the pistol between my teeth, and with a
prayer to God slipped into the muddy waters.</p>

<p>I swam in the wild way of a beginner who fears cramp.  The current
was light and the water moderately warm, but I seemed to go very
slowly, and I was cold with apprehension.  In the middle it suddenly
shallowed, and my breast came against a mudshoal.  I thought it
was a crocodile, and in my confusion the pistol dropped from my
mouth and disappeared.</p>

<p>I waded a few steps and then plunged into deep water again. Almost
before I knew, I was among the bulrushes, with my feet in the
slime of the bank.  With feverish haste I scrambled through the
reeds and up through roots and undergrowth to the hard soil. 
I was across, but, alas, I had lost my only weapon.</p>

<p>The swim and the anxiety had tired me considerably, and though
it meant delay, I did not dare to continue with the weight of
water-logged clothes to impede me.  I found a dry sheltered place
in the bush and stripped to the skin.  I emptied my boots and
wrung out my shirt and breeches, while the Prester's jewels were
blazing on my neck.  Here was a queer counterpart to Laputa in
the cave!</p>

<p>The change revived me, and I continued my way in better form. 
So far there had been no sign of pursuit.  Before me the Letsitela
was the only other stream, and from what I remembered of its character
near the Berg I thought I should have little trouble.  It was
smaller than the Klein Letaba, and a rushing torrent where shallows
must be common.</p>

<p>I kept running till I felt my shirt getting dry on my back. Then
I restored the jewels to their old home, and found their cool
touch on my breast very comforting.  The country was getting more
broken as I advanced.  Little kopjes with thickets of wild bananas
took the place of the dead levels.  Long before I reached the
Letsitela, I saw that I was right in my guess.  It ran, a brawling
mountain stream, in a narrow rift in the bush. I crossed it almost
dry-shod on the boulders above a little fall, stopping for a moment
to drink and lave my brow.</p>

<p>After that the country changed again.  The wood was now getting
like that which clothed the sides of the Berg.  There were tall
timber-trees&mdash;yellowwood, sneezewood, essenwood, stinkwood&mdash;and
the ground was carpeted with thick grass and ferns.  The sight
gave me my first earnest of safety.  I was approaching my own
country.  Behind me was heathendom and the black fever flats. 
In front were the cool mountains and bright streams, and the guns
of my own folk.</p>

<p>As I struggled on&mdash;for I was getting very footsore and weary
&mdash;I became aware of an odd sound in my rear.  It was as if
something were following me.  I stopped and listened with a sudden
dread.  Could Laputa's trackers have got up with me already? 
But the sound was not of human feet.  It was as if some heavy
animal were plunging through the undergrowth. At intervals came
the soft pad of its feet on the grass.</p>

<p>It must be the hungry lion of my nightmare, and Henriques' pistol
was in the mud of the Klein Letaba!  The only thing was a tree,
and I had sprung for one and scrambled wearily into the first
branches when a great yellow animal came into the moonlight.</p>

<p>Providence had done kindly in robbing me of my pistol.  The next
minute I was on the ground with Colin leaping on me and baying
with joy.  I hugged that blessed hound and buried my head in his
shaggy neck, sobbing like a child.  How he had traced me I can
never tell.  The secret belongs only to the Maker of good and
faithful dogs.</p>

<p>With him by my side I was a new man.  The awesome loneliness
had gone. I felt as if he were a message from my own people to
take me safely home.  He clearly knew the business afoot, for
he padded beside me with never a glance to right or left.  Another
time he would have been snowking in every thicket; but now he
was on duty, a serious, conscientious dog with no eye but for
business.</p>

<p>The moon went down, and the starry sky was our only light. The
thick gloom which brooded over the landscape pointed to the night
being far gone.  I thought I saw a deeper blackness ahead which
might be the line of the Berg.  Then came that period of utter
stillness when every bush sound is hushed and the world seems
to swoon.  I felt almost impious hurrying through that profound
silence, when not even the leaves stirred or a frog croaked.</p>

<p>Suddenly as we came over a rise a little wind blew on the back
of my head, and a bitter chill came into the air.  I knew from
nights spent in the open that it was the precursor of dawn.  Sure
enough, as I glanced back, far over the plain a pale glow was
stealing upwards into the sky.  In a few minutes the pall melted
into an airy haze, and above me I saw the heavens shot with tremors
of blue light.  Then the foreground began to clear, and there
before me, with their heads still muffled in vapour, were the
mountains.</p>

<p>Xenophon's Ten Thousand did not hail the sea more gladly than
I welcomed those frowning ramparts of the Berg.</p>

<p>Once again my weariness was eased.  I cried to Colin, and together
we ran down into the wide, shallow trough which lies at the foot
of the hills.  As the sun rose above the horizon, the black masses
changed to emerald and rich umber, and the fleecy mists of the
summits opened and revealed beyond shining spaces of green.  Some
lines of Shakespeare ran in my head, which I have always thought
the most beautiful of all poetry:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Night's candles are burned out, and jocund day<br/>
Walks tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.'

</p>
</div>
<p>Up there among the clouds was my salvation.  Like the Psalmist,
I lifted my eyes to the hills from whence came my aid.</p>

<p>Hope is a wonderful restorative.  To be near the hills, to smell
their odours, to see at the head of the glens the lines of the
plateau where were white men and civilization&mdash;all gave me new
life and courage. Colin saw my mood, and spared a moment now and
then to inspect a hole or a covert.  Down in the shallow trough
I saw the links of a burn, the Machudi, which flowed down the
glen it was my purpose to ascend. Away to the north in the direction
of Majinje's were patches of Kaffir tillage, and I thought I discerned
the smoke from fires. Majinje's womankind would be cooking their
morning meal. To the south ran a thick patch of forest, but I
saw beyond it the spur of the mountain over which runs the highroad
to Wesselsburg.  The clear air of dawn was like wine in my blood.
I was not free, but I was on the threshold of freedom.  If I could
only reach my friends with the Prester's collar in my shirt, I
would have performed a feat which would never be forgotten. I
would have made history by my glorious folly. Breakfastless and
footsore, I was yet a proud man as I crossed the hollow to the
mouth of Machudi's glen.</p>

<p>My chickens had been counted too soon, and there was to be no
hatching. Colin grew uneasy, and began to sniff up wind.  I was
maybe a quarter of a mile from the glen foot, plodding through
the long grass of the hollow, when the behaviour of the dog made
me stop and listen.  In that still air sounds carry far, and I
seemed to hear the noise of feet brushing through cover.  The
noise came both from north and south, from the forest and from
the lower course of the Machudi.</p>

<p>I dropped into shelter, and running with bent back got to the
summit of a little bush-clad knoll.  It was Colin who first caught
sight of my pursuers.  He was staring at a rift in the trees,
and suddenly gave a short bark.  I looked and saw two men, running
hard, cross the grass and dip into the bed of the stream.  A moment
later I had a glimpse of figures on the edge of the forest, moving
fast to the mouth of the glen.  The pursuit had not followed me;
it had waited to cut me off. Fool that I was, I had forgotten
the wonders of Kaffir telegraphy.  It had been easy for Laputa
to send word thirty miles ahead to stop any white man who tried
to cross the Berg.</p>

<p>And then I knew that I was very weary.</p>
