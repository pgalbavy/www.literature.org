<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My first thought, as I journeyed towards London, was that I was
horribly alone in this business.  Whatever was to be done I must
do it myself, for the truth was I had no evidence which any authority
would recognise.  Pitt-Heron was the friend of a strange being
who collected objects of art, probably passed under an alias in
South London, and had absurd visions of the end of civilisation. 
That, in cold black and white, was all my story came to.  If I
went to the police they would laugh at me, and they would be right.</p>

<p>Now I am a sober and practical person, but, slender though my
evidence was, it brought to my mind the most absolute conviction. 
I seemed to know Pitt-Heron's story as if I had heard it from
his own lips&mdash;his first meeting with Lumley and their growing
friendship; his initiation into secret and forbidden things; the
revolt of the decent man, appalled that his freakishness had led
him so far; the realisation that he could not break so easily
with his past, and that Lumley held him in his power; and last,
the mad flight under the pressure of overwhelming terror.</p>

<p>I could read, too, the purpose of that flight.  He knew the Indian
frontier as few men know it, and in the wild tangle of the Pamirs
he hoped to baffle his enemy.  Then from some far refuge he would
send for his wife and spend the rest of his days in exile.  It
must have been an omnipotent terror to drive such a man, young,
brilliant, rich, successful, to the fate of an absconding felon.</p>

<p>But Lumley was on his trail.  So I read the telegram I had picked
up on the floor of the Blackheath house, and my business was to
frustrate the pursuit.  Some one must have gone to Bokhara, some
creature of Lumley's, perhaps the super-butler I had met in the
County Court.  The telegram, for I had noted the date, had been
received on the 27th day of May.  It was now the 15th of June,
so if some one had started immediately on its receipt, in all
probability he would by now be in Bokhara.</p>

<p>I must find out who had gone and endeavour to warn Tommy.  I
calculated that it would have taken him seven or eight days to
get from Moscow by the Transcaspian; probably he would find Pitt-Heron
gone, but inquiries would set him on the track.  I might be able
to get in touch with him through the Russian officials.  In any
case, if Lumley were stalking Pitt-Heron, I, unknown and unsuspected,
would be stalking Lumley.</p>

<p>And then in a flash I realised my folly.</p>

<p>The wretched letter I had written that morning had given the
whole show away.  Lumley knew that I was a friend of Pitt-Heron,
and that I knew that he was a friend of Pitt-Heron.  If my guess
was right, friendship with Lumley was not a thing Charles was
likely to confess to, and he would argue that my knowledge of
it meant that I was in Charles's confidence.  I would therefore
know of his disappearance and its cause, and alone in London would
connect it with the decorous bachelor of the Albany.  My letter
was a warning to him that he could not play the game unobserved,
and I, too, would be suspect in his eyes.</p>

<p>It was no good crying over spilt milk, and Lumley's suspicions
must be accepted.  But I confess that the thought gave me the
shivers. The man had a curious terror for me, a terror I cannot
hope to analyse and reproduce for you.  My bald words can give
no idea of the magnetic force of his talk, the sense of brooding
and unholy craft. I was proposing to match my wits against a master's,
one, too, who must have at his command an organisation far beyond
my puny efforts. I have said that my first feeling was that of
loneliness and isolation; my second was one of hopeless insignificance. 
It was a boy's mechanical toy arrayed against a Power-House with
its shining wheels and monstrous dynamos.</p>

<p>My first business was to get into touch with Tommy.</p>

<p>At that time I had a friend in one of the Embassies, whose acquaintance
I had made on a dry-fly stream in Hampshire.  I will not tell
you his name, for he has since become a great figure in the world's
diplomacy, and I am by no means certain that the part he played
in this tale was strictly in accordance with official etiquette. 
I had assisted him on the legal side in some of the international
worries that beset all Embassies, and we had reached the point
of intimacy which is marked by the use of Christian names and
by dining frequently together.  Let us call him Monsieur Felix.
He was a grave young man, slightly my senior, learned, discreet,
and ambitious, but with an engaging boyishness cropping up now
and then under the official gold lace.  It occurred to me that
in him I might find an ally.</p>

<p>I reached London about eleven in the morning, and went straight
to Belgrave Square.  Felix I found in the little library off the
big secretaries' room, a sunburnt sportsman fresh from a Norwegian
salmon river.  I asked him if he had half an hour to spare, and
was told that the day was at my service.</p>

<p>"You know Tommy Deloraine?" I asked.</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>"And Charles Pitt-Heron?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of him."</p>

<p>"Well, here is my trouble.  I have reason to believe that Tommy
has joined Pitt-Heron in Bokhara.  If he has, my mind will be
greatly relieved, for, though I can't tell you the story, I can
tell you that Pitt-Heron is in very considerable danger.  Can
you help me?"</p>

<p>Felix reflected.  "That should be simple enough.  I can wire
in cypher to the Military Governor.  The police there are pretty
efficient, as you may imagine, and travellers don't come and go
without being remarked.  I should be able to give you an answer
within twenty-four hours.  But I must describe Tommy.  How does
one do that in telegraphese?"</p>

<p>"I want you to tell me another thing," I said.  "You remember
that Pitt-Heron has some reputation as a Central Asian traveller. 
Tommy, as you know, is as mad as a hatter.  Suppose these two
fellows at Bokhara, wanting to make a long trek into wild country&mdash;how
would they go?  You've been there, and know the lie of the land."</p>

<p>Felix got down a big German atlas, and for half an hour we pored
over it.  From Bokhara, he said, the only routes for madmen ran
to the south.  East and north you got into Siberia; west lay the
Transcaspian desert; but southward you might go through the Hissar
range by Pamirski Post to Gilgit and Kashmir, or you might follow
up the Oxus and enter the north of Afghanistan, or you might go
by Merv into north-eastern Persia.  The first he thought the likeliest
route, if a man wanted to travel fast.</p>

<p>I asked him to put in his cable a suggestion about watching the
Indian roads, and left him with a promise of early enlightenment.</p>

<p>Then I went down to the Temple, fixed some consultations, and
spent a quiet evening in my rooms.  I had a heavy sense of impending
disaster, not unnatural in the circumstances.  I really cannot
think what it was that held me to the job, for I don't mind admitting
that I felt pretty queasy about it.  Partly, no doubt, liking
for Tommy and Ethel, partly regret for that unfortunate fellow
Pitt-Heron, most of all, I think, dislike of Lumley.  That bland
super-man had fairly stirred my prosaic antipathies.</p>

<p>That night I went carefully over every item in the evidence to
try and decide on my next step.  I had got to find out more about
my enemies.  Lumley I was pretty certain would baffle me, but
I thought I might have a better chance with the super-butler. 
As it turned out I hit his trail almost at once.</p>

<p>Next day I was in a case at the Old Bailey.  It was an important
prosecution for fraud, and I appeared, with two leaders, for the
Bank concerned.  The amazing and almost incredible thing about
this story of mine is the way clues kept rolling in unsolicited,
and I was to get another from this dull prosecution.  I suppose
that the explanation is that the world is full of clues to everything,
and that, if a man's mind is sharp-set on any quest, he happens
to notice and take advantage of what otherwise he would miss.</p>

<p>My leaders were both absent the first day, and I had to examine
our witnesses alone.  Towards the close of the afternoon I put
a fellow in the box, an oldish, drink-sodden clerk from a Cannon
Street bucket-shop.  His evidence was valuable for our case, but
I was very doubtful how he would stand a cross-examination as
to credit.  His name was Routh, and he spoke with a strong North-country
accent.  But what caught my attention was his face.  His jaw looked
as if it had been made in two pieces which did not fit, and he
had little, bright protuberant eyes.  At my first glance I was
conscious of a recollection.</p>

<p>He was still in the box when the Court rose, and I informed the
solicitors that before going further I wanted a conference with
the witness.  I mentioned also that I should like to see him alone. 
A few minutes later he was brought to my chambers, and I put one
or two obvious questions on the case, till the managing clerk
who accompanied him announced with many excuses that he must hurry
away. Then I shut the door, gave Mr. Routh a cigar, and proceeded
to conduct a private inquiry.</p>

<p>He was a pathetic being, only too ready to talk.  I learned the
squalid details of his continuous misfortunes.  He had been the
son of a dissenting minister in Northumberland, and had drifted
through half a dozen occupations till he found his present unsavoury
billet. Truth was written large on his statement, he had nothing
to conceal, for his foible was folly, not crime, and he had not
a rag of pride to give him reticence.  He boasted that he was
a gentleman and well-educated, too, but he had never had a chance. 
His brother had advised him badly; his brother was too clever
for a prosaic world; always through his reminiscences came this
echo of fraternal admiration and complaint.</p>

<p>It was about the brother I wanted to know, and Mr. Routh was
very willing to speak.  Indeed, it was hard to disentangle facts
from his copious outpourings.  The brother had been an engineer
and a highly successful one; had dallied with politics, too, and
had been a great inventor.  He had put Mr. Routh on to a South
American speculation, where he had made a little money but speedily
lost it again.  Oh, he had been a good brother in his way, and
had often helped him, but he was a busy man, and his help never
went quite far enough.  Besides, he did not like to apply to him
too often.  I gathered that the brother was not a person to take
liberties with.</p>

<p>I asked him what he was doing now.</p>

<p>"Ah," said Mr. Routh, "that is what I wish I could tell you. 
I will not conceal from you that for the moment I am in considerable
financial straits, and this case, though my hands are clean enough,
God knows, will not make life easier for me.  My brother is a
mysterious man, whose business often takes him abroad.  I have
never known even his address, for I write always to a London office
from which my communications are forwarded.  I only know that
he is in some big electrical business, for I remember that he
once let drop the remark that he was in charge of some power station. 
No, I do not think it is in London, probably somewhere abroad. 
I heard from him a fortnight ago, and he told me he was just leaving
England for a couple of months.  It is very annoying, for I want
badly to get into touch with him."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mr. Routh," I said, "I believe I have met your
brother. Is he like you in any way?"</p>

<p>"We have a strong family resemblance, but he is taller and slimmer.
He has been more prosperous, and has lived a healthier life, you
see."</p>

<p>"Do you happen to know," I asked, "if he ever uses another name? 
I don't think that the man I knew was called Routh."</p>

<p>The clerk flushed.  "I think it highly unlikely that my brother
would use an alias.  He has done nothing to disgrace a name of
which we are proud."</p>

<p>I told him that my memory had played me false, and we parted
on very good terms.  He was an innocent soul, one of those people
that clever rascals get to do their dirty work for them.  But
there was no mistaking the resemblance.  There, without the brains
and force and virility, went my super-butler of Blackheath, who
passed under the name of Tuke.</p>

<p>The clerk had given me the name of the office to whose address
he had written to his brother.  I was not surprised to find that
it was that of the firm of stockbrokers for whom I was still acting
in the bearer-bonds case where I had heard Pavia's name.</p>

<p>I rang up the partner whom I knew and told him a very plausible
story of having a message for one of Mr. Pavia's servants, and
asked him if he were in touch with them and could forward letters. 
He made me hold the line, and then came back and told me that
he had forwarded letters for Tuke, the butler, and one Routh who
was a groom or footman.  Tuke had gone abroad to join his master
and he did not know his address.  But he advised me to write to
the White Lodge.</p>

<p>I thanked him and rang off.  That was settled anyhow.  Tuke's
real name was Routh, and it was Tuke who had gone to Bokhara.</p>

<p>My next step was to ring up Macgillivray at Scotland Yard and
get an appointment in half an hour's time.  Macgillivray had been
at the Bar &mdash;I had read in his chambers&mdash;and was now one
of the heads of the Criminal Investigation Department.  I was
about to ask him for information which he was in no way bound
to give me, but I presumed on our old acquaintance.</p>

<p>I asked him first whether he had ever heard of a secret organisation
which went under the name of the Power-House.  He laughed out
loud at my question.</p>

<p>"I should think we have several hundreds of such pet names on
our records," he said.  "Everything from the Lodge of the Baldfaced
Ravens to Solomon's Seal No. X.  Fancy nomenclature is the relaxation
of the tired anarchist, and matters very little.  The dangerous
fellows have no names, no numbers even, which we can get hold
of. But I'll get a man to look up our records.  There may be something
filed about your Power-House."</p>

<p>My second question he answered differently.  "Routh!  Routh! 
Why, yes, there was a Routh we had dealings with a dozen years
ago, when I used to go the North-Eastern circuit.  He was a trade-union
official who bagged the funds, and they couldn't bring him to
justice because of the ridiculous extra-legal status they possess. 
He knew it, and played their own privileges against them.  Oh,
yes, he was a very complete rogue.  I once saw him at a meeting
in Sunderland, and I remember his face&mdash;sneering eyes, diabolically
clever mouth, and with it all as smug as a family butler.  He
has disappeared from England&mdash;at least we haven't heard of him
for some years, but I can show you his photograph."</p>

<p>Macgillivray took from a lettered cabinet a bundle of cards,
selected one and tossed it towards me.  It was that of a man of
thirty or so, with short side-whiskers and a drooping moustache. 
The eyes, the ill-fitting jaw, and the brow were those of my friend,
Mr. Tuke, brother and patron of the sorrowful Mr. Routh, who had
already that afternoon occupied my attention.</p>

<p>Macgillivray promised to make certain inquiries, and I walked
home in a state of elation.  Now I knew for certain who had gone
to Bokhara, and I knew something, too, of the traveller's past. 
A discredited genius was the very man for Lumley's schemes&mdash;one
who asked for nothing better than to use his brains outside the
ring-fence of convention.  Somewhere in the wastes of Turkestan
the ex-trade-union official was in search of Pitt-Heron.  I did
not fancy that Mr. Tuke would be very squeamish.</p>

<p>I dined at the club and left early.  Going home, I had an impression
that I was being shadowed.</p>

<p>You know the feeling that some one is watching you, a sort of
sensation which the mind receives without actual evidence.  If
the watcher is behind where you can't see him you have a cold
feeling between your shoulders.  I daresay it is a legacy from
the days when the cave-man had to look pretty sharp to keep from
getting his enemy's knife between the ribs.</p>

<p>It was a bright summer evening, and Piccadilly had its usual
crowd of motor-cars and busses and foot passengers.  I halted
twice, once in St.  James's Street and once at the corner of Stratton
Street, and retraced my steps for a bit, and each time I had the
impression that some one a hundred yards or so off had done the
same.  My instinct was to turn round and face him, whoever he
was, but I saw that that was foolishness.  Obviously in such a
crowd I could get no certainty in the matter, so I put it out
of my mind.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the evening in my rooms, reading cases and
trying to keep my thoughts off Central Asia.  About ten I was
rung up on the telephone by Felix.  He had had his answer from
Bokhara.  Pitt-Heron had left with a small caravan on June 2d
by the main road through the Hissar range.  Tommy had arrived
on June 10th and on the 12th had set off with two servants on
the same trail.  Travelling the lighter of the two, he should
have overtaken Pitt-Heron by the 15th at latest.</p>

<p>That was yesterday, and my mind was immensely relieved.  Tommy
in such a situation was a tower of strength, for, whatever his
failings in politics, I knew no one I would rather have with me
to go tiger-shooting.</p>

<p>Next day the sense of espionage increased.  I was in the habit
of walking down to the Temple by way of Pall Mall and the Embankment,
but, as I did not happen to be in Court that morning, I resolved
to make a detour and test my suspicions.  There seemed to be nobody
in Down Street as I emerged from my flat, but I had not walked
five yards before, turning back, I saw a man enter from the Piccadilly
end, while another moved across the Hertford Street opening. 
It may have been only my imagination, but I was convinced that
these were my watchers.</p>

<p>I walked up Park Lane, for it seemed to me that by taking the
Tube at the Marble Arch Station I could bring matters to the proof. 
I have a knack of observing small irrelevant details, and I happened
to have noticed that a certain carriage in the train which left
Marble Arch about 9.30 stopped exactly opposite the exit at the
Chancery Lane Station, and by hurrying up the passage one could
just catch the lift which served an earlier train and so reach
the street before any of the other travellers.</p>

<p>I performed this manoeuvre with success, caught the early lift,
reached the street and took cover behind a pillar-box from which
I could watch the exit of passengers from the stairs.  I judged
that my tracker, if he missed me below, would run up the stairs
rather than wait for the lift.  Sure enough, a breathless gentleman
appeared, who scanned the street eagerly, and then turned to the
lift to watch the emerging passengers.  It was clear that the
espionage was no figment of my brain.</p>

<p>I walked slowly to my chambers and got through the day's work
as best I could, for my mind was preoccupied with the unpleasant
business in which I found myself entangled.  I would have given
a year's income to be honestly quit of it, but there seemed to
be no way of escape. The maddening thing was that I could do so
little.  There was no chance of forgetting anxiety in strenuous
work.  I could only wait with the patience at my command, and
hope for the one chance in a thousand which I might seize.  I
felt miserably that it was no game for me.  I had never been brought
up to harry wild beasts and risk my neck twice a day at polo like
Tommy Deloraine.  I was a peaceful, sedentary man, a lover of
a quiet life, with no appetite for perils and commotions.  But
I was beginning to realize that I was very obstinate.</p>

<p>At four o'clock I left the Temple and walked to the Embassy. 
I had resolved to banish the espionage from my mind, for that
was the least of my difficulties.</p>

<p>Felix gave me an hour of his valuable time.  It was something
that Tommy had joined Pitt-Heron, but there were other matters
to be arranged in that far country.  The time had come, in my
opinion, to tell him the whole story.</p>

<p>The telling was a huge relief to my mind.  He did not laugh at
me as I had half feared, but took the whole thing as gravely as
possible. In his profession, I fancy, he had found too many certainties
behind suspicions to treat anything as trivial.  The next step,
he said, was to warn the Russian police of the presence of the
man called Saronov and the super-butler.  Happily we had materials
for the description of Tuke or Routh, and I could not believe
that such a figure would be hard to trace.  Felix cabled again
in cypher, asking that the two should be watched, more especially
if there was reason to believe that they had followed Tommy's
route.  Once more we got out the big map and discussed the possible
ways.  It seemed to me a land created by Providence for surprises,
for the roads followed the valleys, and to the man who travelled
light there must be many short cuts through the hills.</p>

<p>I left the Embassy before six o'clock and, crossing the Square
engrossed with my own thoughts, ran full into Lumley.</p>

<p>I hope I played my part well, though I could not repress a start
of surprise.  He wore a grey morning-coat and a white top-hat
and looked the image of benevolent respectability.</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Leithen," he said, "we meet again."</p>

<p>I murmured something about my regrets at my early departure three
days ago, and added the feeble joke that I wished he would hurry
on his Twilight of Civilisation, for the burden of it was becoming
too much for me.</p>

<p>He looked me in the eyes with all the friendliness in the world. 
"So you have not forgotten our evening's talk?  You owe me something,
my friend, for giving you a new interest in your profession."</p>

<p>"I owe you much," I said, "for your hospitality, your advice,
and your warnings."</p>

<p>He was wearing his tinted glasses and peered quizzically into
my face.</p>

<p>"I am going to make a call in Grosvenor Place," he said, "and
shall beg in return the pleasure of your company.  So you know
my young friend, Pitt-Heron?"</p>

<p>With an ingenuous countenance I explained that he had been at
Oxford with me and that we had common friends.</p>

<p>"A brilliant young man," said Lumley.  "Like you, he has occasionally
cheered an old man's solitude.  And he has spoken of me to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, lying stoutly.  "He used to tell me about your
collections."  (If Lumley knew Charles well he would find me out,
for the latter would not have crossed the road for all the treasures
of the Louvre.)</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I have picked up a few things.  If ever you should
care to see them I should be honoured.  You are a connoisseur? 
Of a sort? You interest me for I should have thought your taste
lay in other directions than the dead things of art.  Pitt-Heron
is no collector. He loves life better than art, as a young man
should.  A great traveller our friend&mdash;the Laurence Oliphant or
Richard Burton of our day."</p>

<p>We stopped at a house in Grosvenor Place, and he relinquished
my arm. "Mr. Leithen," he said, "a word from one who wishes you
no ill.  You are a friend of Pitt-Heron, but where he goes you
cannot follow. Take my advice and keep out of his affairs.  You
will do no good to him, and you may bring yourself into serious
danger.  You are a man of sense, a practical man, so I speak to
you frankly.  But, remember, I do not warn twice."</p>

<p>He took off his glasses, and his light, wild eyes looked me straight
in the face.  All benevolence had gone, and something implacable
and deadly burned in them.  Before I could say a word in reply
he shuffled up the steps of the house and was gone....</p>
