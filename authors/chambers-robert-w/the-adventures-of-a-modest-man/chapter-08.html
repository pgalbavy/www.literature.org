<p>This is a story of the Mystic Three &mdash;Fate, Chance, and
Destiny; and what happens to people who trifle with them.</p>

<p>It begins with a young man running after a train. He had to run.</p>

<p>The connection at Westport Junction was normally a close one,
but now, even before the incoming train had entirely stopped,
the local on the other line began to move out, while the engineers
of the two locomotives, leaning from their cab windows, exchanged
sooty grins. It was none of their business&mdash;this squabble between
the two roads which was making the term, "Junction," as applied
to Westport, a snare and a derision.</p>

<p>So the roads squabbled, and young Seabury ran. Other passengers
ran, too, amid the gibes of newsboys and the patronizing applause
of station loafers.</p>

<p>He heard them; he also heard squeaks emitted by females whose
highest speed was a dignified and scuttering waddle. Meanwhile
he was running, and running hard through the falling snow; the
ice under foot did not aid him; his overcoat and suit-case handicapped
him; the passengers on the moving train smiled at him behind frosty
windows.</p>

<p>One very thin man smoking a cigar rubbed his thumb on the pane
in order to see better; he was laughing, and Seabury wished him
evil.</p>

<p>There were only two cars, and the last one was already rolling
by him. And at one of the windows of this car he saw a pretty
girl in chinchilla furs watching him curiously. Then she also
smiled.</p>

<p>It may have been the frank amusement of a pretty woman, and it
may have been the sorrowful apathy of a red-nosed brakeman tying
the loose end of the signal rope on the rear platform; doubtless
one or the other spurred him to a desperate flying leap which
landed him and his suit-case on the rear platform of the last
car. And there he stuck, too mad to speak, until a whirlwind of
snow and cinders drove him to shelter inside.</p>

<p>The choice of cars was limited to a combination baggage and smoker
and a more fragrant passenger coach. He selected a place in the
latter across the aisle from the attractive girl in chinchilla
furs who had smiled at his misfortunes&mdash;not very maliciously.
Now, as he seated himself, she glanced up at him without the slightest
visible interest, and returned to her study of the winter landscape.</p>

<p>The car was hot; he was hot. Burning thoughts concerning the
insolence of railroads made him hotter; the knowledge that he
had furnished amusement for the passengers of two trains did not
cool him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile everybody in the car had become tired of staring at
him; a little boy across the aisle giggled his last giggle; several
men resumed their newspapers; a shopgirl remembered her gum and
began chewing it again.</p>

<p>A large mottled man with a damp moustache, seated opposite him,
said: "Vell, Mister, you runned pooty quvick alretty py dot Vestport
train!"</p>

<p>"It seems to me," observed Seabury, touching his heated face
with his handkerchief, "that the public ought to do something."</p>

<p>"Yaw; der bublic it runs," said the large man, resuming his eyeglasses
and holding his newspaper nearer to the window in the fading light.</p>

<p>Seabury smiled to himself and ventured to glance across the aisle
in time to see the dawning smile in the blue eyes of his neighbor
die out instantly as he turned. It was the second smile he had
extinguished since his appearance aboard the train.</p>

<p>The conductor, a fat, unbuttoned, untidy official, wearing spectacles
and a walrus moustache, came straddling down the aisle. He looked
over the tops of his spectacles at Seabury doubtfully.</p>

<p>"I managed to jump aboard," explained the young man, smiling.</p>

<p>"Tickuts!" returned the conductor without interest.</p>

<p>"I haven't a ticket; I'll pay&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sure," said the conductor; "vere you ged owid?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Vere do you ged <em>owid</em>?"</p>

<p>"Oh, where do I get <em>out</em>? I'm going to Beverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Peverly? Sefenty-vive cends."</p>

<p>"Not to Peverly, to Beverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yaw, Peverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, no; Beverly! not Peverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Aind I said Peverly alretty? Sefenty-vive&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Look here; there's a Beverly and a Peverly on this line, and
I don't want to go to Peverly and I do want to go to Beverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You go py Peverly und you don'd go py Beverly alretty! Sure!
Sefenty-vive ce&#11834;"</p>

<p>The young man cast an exasperated glance across the aisle in
time to catch a glimpse of two deliciously blue eyes suffused
with mirth. And instantly, as before, the mirth died out. As an
extinguisher of smiles he was a success, anyway; and he turned
again to the placid conductor who was in the act of punching a
ticket.</p>

<p>"Wait! Hold on! Don't do that until I get this matter straight!
Now, do you understand where I wish to go?"</p>

<p>"You go py Peverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No, Beverly! Beverly! <em>Beverly</em>," he repeated in patiently
studied accents.</p>

<p>The large mottled man with the damp moustache looked up gravely
over his newspaper: "Yaw, der gonductor he also says Peverly."</p>

<p>"But Peverly isn't Beverly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Aind I said it blenty enough dimes?" demanded the conductor,
becoming irritable.</p>

<p>"But you haven't said it right yet!" insisted Seabury.</p>

<p>The conductor was growing madder and madder. "Peverly! Peverly!!
<em>Peverly!!!</em> In Gottes Himmel, don'd you English yet alretty
understandt? Sefenty-vive cends! Und"&mdash;here he jammed a seat check
into the rattling windows-sill&mdash;"Und ven I sez Peverly it iss
Peverly, und ven I sez Beverly it iss Beverly, und ven I sez sefenty-vive
cends so iss it sefenty-vi&#11834;"</p>

<p>Seabury thrust three silver quarters at him; it was impossible
to pursue the subject; madness lay in that direction. And when
the affronted conductor, mumbling muffled indignation, had straddled
off down the aisle, the young man took a cautious glance at the
check in the window-sill. But on it was printed only, "Please
show this to the conductor," so he got no satisfaction there.
He had mislaid his time-table, too, and the large mottled man
opposite had none, and began an endless and patient explanation
which naturally resulted in nothing, as his labials were similar
to the conductor's; even more so.</p>
