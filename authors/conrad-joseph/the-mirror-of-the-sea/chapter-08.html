<p> The sailing and racing of yachts has developed a class of fore-and-aft
sailors, men born and bred to the sea, fishing in winter and yachting
in summer; men to whom the handling of that particular rig presents
no mystery.  It is their striving for victory that has elevated
the sailing of pleasure craft to the dignity of a fine art in
that special sense.  As I have said, I know nothing of racing
and but little of fore-and-aft rig; but the advantages of such
a rig are obvious, especially for purposes of pleasure, whether
in cruising or racing.  It requires less effort in handling; the
trimming of the sail-planes to the wind can be done with speed
and accuracy; the unbroken spread of the sail-area is of infinite
advantage; and the greatest possible amount of canvas can be displayed
upon the least possible quantity of spars.  Lightness and concentrated
power are the great qualities of fore-and-aft rig.</p>

<p>A fleet of fore-and-afters at anchor has its own slender graciousness.
The setting of their sails resembles more than anything else the
unfolding of a bird’s wings; the facility of their evolutions
is a pleasure to the eye.  They are birds of the sea, whose swimming
is like flying, and resembles more a natural function than the
handling of man-invented appliances.  The fore-and-aft rig in
its simplicity and the beauty of its aspect under every angle
of vision is, I believe, unapproachable.  A schooner, yawl, or
cutter in charge of a capable man seems to handle herself as if
endowed with the power of reasoning and the gift of swift execution. 
One laughs with sheer pleasure at a smart piece of manoeuvring,
as at a manifestation of a living creature’s quick wit and graceful
precision.</p>

<p>Of those three varieties of fore-and-aft rig, the cutter—the
racing rig <em>par excellence</em>—is of an appearance the most
imposing, from the fact that practically all her canvas is in
one piece.  The enormous mainsail of a cutter, as she draws slowly
past a point of land or the end of a jetty under your admiring
gaze, invests her with an air of lofty and silent majesty.  At
anchor a schooner looks better; she has an aspect of greater efficiency
and a better balance to the eye, with her two masts distributed
over the hull with a swaggering rake aft.  The yawl rig one comes
in time to love.  It is, I should think, the easiest of all to
manage.</p>

<p>For racing, a cutter; for a long pleasure voyage, a schooner;
for cruising in home waters, the yawl; and the handling of them
all is indeed a fine art.  It requires not only the knowledge
of the general principles of sailing, but a particular acquaintance
with the character of the craft.  All vessels are handled in the
same way as far as theory goes, just as you may deal with all
men on broad and rigid principles.  But if you want that success
in life which comes from the affection and confidence of your
fellows, then with no two men, however similar they may appear
in their nature, will you deal in the same way.  There may be
a rule of conduct; there is no rule of human fellowship.  To deal
with men is as fine an art as it is to deal with ships.  Both
men and ships live in an unstable element, are subject to subtle
and powerful influences, and want to have their merits understood
rather than their faults found out.</p>

<p>It is not what your ship will <em>not</em> do that you want to
know to get on terms of successful partnership with her; it is,
rather, that you ought to have a precise knowledge of what she
will do for you when called upon to put forth what is in her by
a sympathetic touch.  At first sight the difference does not seem
great in either line of dealing with the difficult problem of
limitations.  But the difference is great.  The difference lies
in the spirit in which the problem is approached.  After all,
the art of handling ships is finer, perhaps, than the art of handling
men.</p>

<p>And, like all fine arts, it must be based upon a broad, solid
sincerity, which, like a law of Nature, rules an infinity of different
phenomena. Your endeavour must be single-minded.  You would talk
differently to a coal-heaver and to a professor.  But is this
duplicity?  I deny it.  The truth consists in the genuineness
of the feeling, in the genuine recognition of the two men, so
similar and so different, as your two partners in the hazard of
life.  Obviously, a humbug, thinking only of winning his little
race, would stand a chance of profiting by his artifices.  Men,
professors or coal-heavers, are easily deceived; they even have
an extraordinary knack of lending themselves to deception, a sort
of curious and inexplicable propensity to allow themselves to
be led by the nose with their eyes open.  But a ship is a creature
which we have brought into the world, as it were on purpose to
keep us up to the mark. In her handling a ship will not put up
with a mere pretender, as, for instance, the public will do with
Mr. X, the popular statesman, Mr. Y, the popular scientist, or
Mr. Z, the popular—what shall we say?—anything from a teacher
of high morality to a bagman—who have won their little race. 
But I would like (though not accustomed to betting) to wager a
large sum that not one of the few first-rate skippers of racing
yachts has ever been a humbug.  It would have been too difficult. 
The difficulty arises from the fact that one does not deal with
ships in a mob, but with a ship as an individual.  So we may have
to do with men. But in each of us there lurks some particle of
the mob spirit, of the mob temperament.  No matter how earnestly
we strive against each other, we remain brothers on the lowest
side of our intellect and in the instability of our feelings. 
With ships it is not so.  Much as they are to us, they are nothing
to each other.  Those sensitive creatures have no ears for our
blandishments.  It takes something more than words to cajole them
to do our will, to cover us with glory.  Luckily, too, or else
there would have been more shoddy reputations for first-rate seamanship. 
Ships have no ears, I repeat, though, indeed, I think I have known
ships who really seemed to have had eyes, or else I cannot understand
on what ground a certain 1,000-ton barque of my acquaintance on
one particular occasion refused to answer her helm, thereby saving
a frightful smash to two ships and to a very good man’s reputation. 
I knew her intimately for two years, and in no other instance
either before or since have I known her to do that thing.  The
man she had served so well (guessing, perhaps, at the depths of
his affection for her) I have known much longer, and in bare justice
to him I must say that this confidence-shattering experience (though
so fortunate) only augmented his trust in her.  Yes, our ships
have no ears, and thus they cannot be deceived.  I would illustrate
my idea of fidelity as between man and ship, between the master
and his art, by a statement which, though it might appear shockingly
sophisticated, is really very simple.  I would say that a racing-yacht
skipper who thought of nothing else but the glory of winning the
race would never attain to any eminence of reputation.  The genuine
masters of their craft—I say this confidently from my experience
of ships—have thought of nothing but of doing their very best
by the vessel under their charge.  To forget one’s self, to surrender
all personal feeling in the service of that fine art, is the only
way for a seaman to the faithful discharge of his trust.</p>

<p>Such is the service of a fine art and of ships that sail the
sea.  And therein I think I can lay my finger upon the difference
between the seamen of yesterday, who are still with us, and the
seamen of to-morrow, already entered upon the possession of their
inheritance.  History repeats itself, but the special call of
an art which has passed away is never reproduced.  It is as utterly
gone out of the world as the song of a destroyed wild bird.  Nothing
will awaken the same response of pleasurable emotion or conscientious
endeavour.  And the sailing of any vessel afloat is an art whose
fine form seems already receding from us on its way to the overshadowed
Valley of Oblivion.  The taking of a modern steamship about the
world (though one would not minimize its responsibilities) has
not the same quality of intimacy with nature, which, after all,
is an indispensable condition to the building up of an art.  It
is less personal and a more exact calling; less arduous, but also
less gratifying in the lack of close communion between the artist
and the medium of his art.  It is, in short, less a matter of
love.  Its effects are measured exactly in time and space as no
effect of an art can be.  It is an occupation which a man not
desperately subject to sea-sickness can be imagined to follow
with content, without enthusiasm, with industry, without affection. 
Punctuality is its watchword.  The incertitude which attends closely
every artistic endeavour is absent from its regulated enterprise. 
It has no great moments of self-confidence, or moments not less
great of doubt and heart-searching.  It is an industry which,
like other industries, has its romance, its honour and its rewards,
its bitter anxieties and its hours of ease.  But such sea-going
has not the artistic quality of a single-handed struggle with
something much greater than yourself; it is not the laborious
absorbing practice of an art whose ultimate result remains on
the knees of the gods.  It is not an individual, temperamental
achievement, but simply the skilled use of a captured force, merely
another step forward upon the way of universal conquest.</p>
