<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In touch with his unexciting business again, after many months
of glorious absence, and seated once more at his abhorred yellow-oak
desk, young Shotwell discovered it was anything except agreeable
for him to gather up the ravelled thrums of civilian life after
the thrilling taste of service over seas.</p>

<p>For him, so long accustomed to excitement, the zest of living
seemed to die with the signing of the armistice.</p>

<p>In fact, since the Argonne drive, all luck seemed to have deserted
him; for in the very middle of operations he had been sent back
to the United States as instructor; and there the armistice had
now caught him. Furthermore, then, before he realised what dreadful
thing was happening to him, he had been politely assigned to that
vague limbo supposedly inhabited by a mythical organisation known
as The Officers' Reserve Corps, and had been given indefinite
leave of absence preliminary to being mustered out of the service
of the United States.</p>

<p>To part from his uniform was agonising, and he berated the fate
that pried him loose from tunic and puttees. So disgusted was
he that, although the Government allowed three months longer before
discarding uniforms, he shed his in disgust for "cits."</p>

<p>But James Shotwell, Jr., was not the only man bewildered and
annoyed by the rapidity of events which followed the first days
of demobilisation. Half a dozen other young fellows in the big
real estate offices of Clarence Sharrow &amp; Co. found themselves
yanked out of uniform and seated once more at their familiar,
uninviting desks of yellow oak&mdash;very young men, mostly, assigned
to various camps of special three-month instruction; and now cruelly
interrupted while scrambling frantically after commissions in
machine-gun companies, field artillery, flying units, and tank
corps.</p>

<p>And there they were, back again at the old grind before they
could realise their horrid predicament&mdash;the majority already glum
and restless under the reaction, and hating Shotwell, who, among
them all, had been the only man to cross the sea.</p>

<p>This war-worn and envied veteran of a few months, perfectly aware
that his military career had ended, was now trying to accept the
situation and habituate himself to the loathly technique of commerce.</p>

<p>Out of uniform, out of humour, out of touch with the arts of
peace; still, at times, all a-quiver with the nervous shock of
his experience, it was very hard for him to speak respectfully
to Mr. Sharrow.</p>

<p>As instructor to rookie aspirants he would have been somebody:
he had already been somebody as a lieutenant of infantry in the
thunderous scheme of things in the Argonne.</p>

<p>But in the offices of Clarence Sharrow &amp; Co. he was merely
a rather nice-looking civilian subordinate, whose duties were
to aid clients in the selection and purchase of residences, advise
them, consult with them, make appointments to show them dwelling
houses, vacant or still tenanted, and in every stage of repair
or decrepitude.</p>

<p>On the wall beside his desk hung a tinted map of the metropolis.
Upon a table at his elbow were piled ponderous tomes depicting
the Bronx in all its beauty, and giving details of suburban sewers.
Other volumes contained maps of the fashionable residential district,
showing every consecrated block and the exact location as well
as the linear dimensions of every awesome residence and back yard
from Washington Square to Yorkville.</p>

<p>By referring to a note-book which he carried in his breast pocket,
young Shotwell could inform any grand lady or any pompous or fussy
gentleman what was the "asking price" of any particular residence
marked for sale upon the diagrams of the ponderous tomes.</p>

<p>Also&mdash;which is why Sharrow selected him for that particular job&mdash;clients
liked his good manners and his engaging ways.</p>

<p>The average client buys a freshly painted house in preference
to a well-built one, but otherwise clamours always for a bargain.
The richer the client the louder the clamour. And to such demands
Shotwell was always sympathetic&mdash;always willing to inquire whether
or not the outrageous price asked for a dwelling might possibly
be "shaded" a little.</p>

<p>It always could be shaded; but few clients knew that; and the
majority, much flattered at their own business acumen, entertained
kind feelings toward Sharrow &amp; Co. and sentiments almost cordial
toward young Shotwell when the "shading" process had proved to
be successful.</p>

<p>But the black-eye dealt the residential district long ago had
not yet cleared up. Real property of that sort was still dull
and inactive except for a flare-up now and then along Park Avenue
and Fifth.</p>

<p>War, naturally, had not improved matters; and, as far as the
residential part of their business was concerned, Sharrow &amp;
Co. transacted the bulk of it in leasing apartments and, now and
then, a private house, usually on the West Side.</p>

<p>That morning, in the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co., a few clients
sat beside the desks of the various men who specialised in the
particular brand of real estate desired: several neat young girls
performed diligently upon typewriters; old man Sharrow stood at
the door of his private office twirling his eyeglasses by the
gold chain and urbanely getting rid of an undesirable visitor&mdash;one
Angelo Puma, who wanted some land for a moving picture studio,
but was persuasively unwilling to pay for it.</p>

<p>He was a big man, too heavy, youngish, with plump olive skin,
black hair, lips too full and too red under a silky moustache,
and eyes that would have been magnificent in a woman&mdash;a Spanish
dancer, for example&mdash;rich, dark eyes, softly brilliant under curling
lashes.</p>

<p>He seemed to covet the land and the ramshackle stables on it,
but he wanted somebody to take back a staggering mortgage on the
property. And Mr. Sharrow shook his head gently, and twirled his
eyeglasses.</p>

<p>"For me," insisted Puma, "I do not care. It is good property.
I would pay cash if I had it. But I have not. No. My capital at
the moment is tied up in production; my daily expenses, at present,
require what cash I have. If your client is at all reasonable&#11834;"</p>

<p>"He isn't," said Sharrow. "He's a Connecticut Yankee."</p>

<p>For a moment Angelo Puma seemed crestfallen, then his brilliant
smile flashed from every perfect tooth:</p>

<p>"That is very bad for me," he said, buttoning-his showy overcoat.
"Pardon me; I waste your time&mdash;" pulling on his gloves. "However,
if your client should ever care to change his mind&#11834;"</p>

<p>"One moment," said Sharrow, whose time Mr. Puma had indeed wasted
at intervals during the past year, and who heartily desired to
be rid of property and client: "Suppose you deal directly with
the owner. We are not particularly anxious to carry the property;
it's a little out of our sphere. Suppose I put you in direct communication
with the owner."</p>

<p>"Delighted," said Puma, flashing his smile and bowing from the
waist; and perfectly aware that his badgering had bored this gentleman
to the limit.</p>

<p>"I'll write out his address for you," said Sharrow, "&mdash;one moment,
please&#11834;"</p>

<p>Angelo Puma waited, his glossy hat in one hand, his silver-headed
stick and folded suede gloves in the other.</p>

<p>Like darkly brilliant searchlights his magnificent eyes swept
the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co.; at a glance he appraised the
self-conscious typists, surmised possibilities in a blond one;
then, as a woman entered from the street, he rested his gaze upon
her. And he kept it there.</p>

<p>Even when Sharrow came out of his private office with the slip
of paper, Angelo Puma's eyes still remained fastened upon the
young girl who had spoken to a clerk and then seated herself in
a chair beside the desk of James Shotwell, Jr.</p>

<p>"The man's name," repeated Sharrow patiently, "is Elmer Skidder.
His address is Shadow Hill, Connecticut."</p>

<p>Puma turned to him as though confused, thanked him effusively,
took the slip of paper, pulled on his gloves in a preoccupied
way, and very slowly walked toward the street door, his eyes fixed
on the girl who was now in animated conversation with young Shotwell.</p>

<p>As he passed her she was laughing at something the young man
had just said, and Puma deliberately turned and looked at her
again&mdash;looked her full in the face.</p>

<p>She was aware of him and of his bold scrutiny, of course&mdash;noticed
his brilliant eyes, no doubt&mdash;but paid no heed to him&mdash;was otherwise
preoccupied with this young man beside her, whom she had neither
seen nor thought about since the day she had landed in New York
from the rusty little Danish steamer <em>Elsinore</em>.</p>

<p>And now, although he had meant nothing at all to her except an
episode already forgotten, to meet him again had instantly meant
something to her.</p>

<p>For this man now represented to her a link with the exciting
past&mdash;this young soldier who had been fresh from the furnace when
she had met him on deck as the <em>Elsinore</em> passed in between
the forts in the grey of early morning.</p>

<p>The encounter was exciting her a little, too, over-emphasising
its importance.</p>

<p>"Fancy!" she repeated, "my encountering you here and in civilian
dress! Were you dreadfully disappointed by the armistice?"</p>

<p>"I'm ashamed to say I took it hard," he admitted.</p>

<p>"So did I. I had hoped so to go to France. And you&mdash;oh, I <em>am</em>
sorry for you. You were so disgusted at being detailed from the
fighting line to Camp Upton! And now the war is over. What a void!"</p>

<p>"You're very frank," he said. "We're supposed to rejoice, you
know."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. I really do rejoice&#11834;"</p>

<p>They both laughed.</p>

<p>"I mean it," she insisted. "In my sober senses I am glad the
war is over. I'd be a monster if I were not glad. But&mdash;<em>what</em>
is going to take its place? Because we must have something, you
know. One can't endure a perfect void, can one?"</p>

<p>Again they laughed.</p>

<p>"It was such a tremendous thing," she explained. "I did want
to be part of it before it ended. But of course peace is a tremendous
thing, too&#11834;"</p>

<p>And they both laughed once more.</p>

<p>"Anybody overhearing us," she confided to him, "would think us
mere beasts. Of course you are glad the war is ended: that's why
you fought. And I'm glad, too. And I'm going to rent a house in
New York and find something to occupy this void I speak of. But
isn't it nice that I should come to you about it?"</p>

<p>"Jolly," he said. "And now at last I'm going to learn your name."</p>

<p>"Oh. Don't you know it?"</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you, but there seemed to be no proper opportunity&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Of course. I remember. There seemed to be no reason."</p>

<p>"I was sorry afterward," he ventured.</p>

<p>That amused her. "You weren't really sorry, were you?"</p>

<p>"I really was. I thought of you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say you remembered me after the ship docked?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I'm very sure you instantly forgot me."</p>

<p>"I certainly did!" she admitted, still much amused at the idea.
"One doesn't remember everybody one sees, you know," she went
on frankly,"&mdash;particularly after a horrid voyage and when one's
head is full of exciting plans. Alas! those wonderful plans of
mine!&mdash;the stuff that dreams are made of. And here I am asking
you kindly to find me a modest house with a modest rental....
And by the way," she added demurely, "my name is Palla Dumont."</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said smilingly. "Do you care to know mine?"</p>

<p>"I know it. When I came in and told the clerk what I wanted,
he said I should see Mr. Shotwell."</p>

<p>"James Shotwell, Jr.," he said gravely.</p>

<p>"That <em>is</em> amiable. You don't treasure malice, do you?
I might merely have known you as <em>Mr.</em> Shotwell. And you
generously reveal all from James to Junior."</p>

<p>They were laughing again. Mr. Sharrow noticed them from his private
office and congratulated himself on having Shotwell in his employment.</p>

<p>"When may I see a house?" inquired Palla, settling her black-gloved
hands in her black fox muff.</p>

<p>"Immediately, if you like."</p>

<p>"How wonderful!"</p>

<p>He took out his note-book, glanced through several pages, asked
her carelessly what rent she cared to pay, made a note of it,
and resumed his study of the note-book.</p>

<p>"The East Side?" he inquired, glancing at her with curiosity
not entirely professional.</p>

<p>"I prefer it."</p>

<p>From his note-book he read to her the descriptions and situations
of several twenty-foot houses in the zone between Fifth and Third
Avenues.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to see some of them, Mr. Shotwell? Have you, perhaps,
time this morning?"</p>

<p>"I'm delighted," he said. Which, far from straining truth, perhaps
restrained it.</p>

<p>So he got his hat and overcoat, and they went out together into
the winter sunshine.</p>

<p>Angelo Puma, seated in a taxi across the street, observed them.
He wore a gardenia in his lapel. He might have followed Palla
had she emerged alone from the offices of Sharrow &amp; Co.</p>

<p>Shotwell Junior had a jolly morning of it. And, if the routine
proved a trifle monotonous, Palla, too, appeared to amuse herself.</p>

<p>She inspected various types of houses, expensive and inexpensive,
modern and out of date, well built and well kept and "jerry-built"
and dirty.</p>

<p>Prices and rents painfully surprised her, and she gave up any
idea of renting a furnished house, and so informed Shotwell.</p>

<p>So they restricted their inspection to three-story unfurnished
and untenanted houses, where the neighbourhood was less pretentious
and there was a better light in the rear.</p>

<p>But they all were dirty, neglected, out of repair, destitute
of decent plumbing and electricity.</p>

<p>On the second floor of one of these Palla stood, discouraged,
perplexed, gazing absently out, across a filthy back yard full
of seedling ailanthus trees and rubbish, at the rear fire escapes
on the tenements beyond.</p>

<p>Shotwell, exploring the closely written pages of his note-book,
could discover nothing desirable within the terms she was willing
to make.</p>

<p>"There's one house on our books," he said at last, "which came
in only yesterday. I haven't had time to look at it. I don't even
know where the keys are. But if you're not too tired&#11834;"</p>

<p>Palla gave him one of her characteristic direct looks:</p>

<p>"I'm not too tired, but I'm starved. I could go after lunch."</p>

<p>"Fine!" he said. "I'm hungry, too! Shall we go to Delmonico's?"</p>

<p>The girl seemed a trifle nonplussed. She had not supposed that
luncheon with clients was included in a real estate transaction.</p>

<p>She was not embarrassed, nor did the suggestion seem impertinent.
But she said:</p>

<p>"I had expected to lunch at the hotel."</p>

<p>He reddened a little. Guilt shows its colors.</p>

<p>"Had you rather?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, no. I'd rather lunch with you at Delmonico's and talk houses."
And, a little amused at this young man's transparent guile, she
added: "I think it would be very agreeable for us to lunch together."</p>

<p>She came from the dressing-room fresh and flushed as a slightly
chilled rose, rejoining him in the lobby, and presently they were
seated in the palm room with a discreet and hidden orchestra playing,
"Oh! How I Hate To Get Up in the Morning," and rather busy with
a golden Casaba melon between them.</p>

<p>"Isn't this jolly!" he said, expanding easily, as do all young
men in the warmth of the informal.</p>

<p>"Very. What an agreeable business yours seems to be, Mr. Shotwell."</p>

<p>"In what way?" he asked innocently.</p>

<p>"Why, part of it is lunching with feminine clients, isn't it?"</p>

<p>His close-set ears burned. She glanced up with mischief brilliant
in her brown eyes. But he was busy with his melon. And, not looking
at her:</p>

<p>"Don't you want to know me?" he asked so clumsily that she hesitated
to snub so defenceless a male.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I wish to," she replied, smiling slightly.
"I hadn't aspired to it; I hadn't really considered it. I was
thinking about renting a house."</p>

<p>He said nothing, but, as the painful colour remained in his face,
the girl decided to be a little kinder.</p>

<p>"Anyway," she said, "I'm enjoying myself. And I hope you are."</p>

<p>He said he was. But his voice and manner were so subdued that
she laughed.</p>

<p>"Fancy asking a girl such a question," she said. "You shouldn't
ask a woman whether she doesn't want to know you. It would be
irregular enough, under the circumstances, to say that you wanted
to know her."</p>

<p>"That's what I meant," he replied, wincing. "Would you consider
it?"</p>

<p>She could not disguise her amusement.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll consider it, Mr. Shotwell. I'll give it my careful
attention. I owe you something, anyway."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked uncertainly, prepared for further squelching.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly what. But when a man remembers a woman,
and the woman forgets the man, isn't something due him?"</p>

<p>"I think there is," he said so naïvely that Palla was unable
to restrain her gaiety.</p>

<p>"This is a silly conversation," she said, "&mdash;as silly as though
I had accepted the cocktail you so thoughtfully suggested. We're
both enjoying each other and we know it."</p>

<p>"Really!" he exclaimed, brightening.</p>

<p>His boyish relief&mdash;everything that this young man said to her&mdash;seemed
to excite the girl to mirth. Perhaps she had been starved for
laughter longer than is good for anybody. Besides, her heart was
naturally responsive&mdash;opened easily&mdash;was easily engaged.</p>

<p>"Of course I'm inclined to like you," she said, "or I wouldn't
be here lunching with you and talking nonsense instead of houses&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We'll talk houses!"</p>

<p>"No; we'll <em>look</em> at them&mdash;later.... Do you know it's
a long, long time since I have laughed with a really untroubled
heart?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry."</p>

<p>"Yes, it isn't good for a girl. Sadness is a sickness&mdash;a physical
disorganisation that infects the mind. It makes a strange emotion
of love, too, perverting it to that mysticism we call religion&mdash;and
wasting it.... I suppose you're rather shocked," she said smilingly.</p>

<p>"No.... But have you no religion?"</p>

<p>"Have you?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"Protestant.... Are you Catholic?"</p>

<p>The girl rested her cheek on her hand and dabbed absently at
her orange ice.</p>

<p>"I was once," she said. "I was very religious&mdash;in the accepted
sense of the term.... It came rather suddenly;&mdash;it seemed to be
born as part of a sudden and close friendship with a girl&mdash;began
with that friendship, I think.... And died with it."</p>

<p>She sat quite silent for a while, then a tremulous smile edged
her lips:</p>

<p>"I had meant to take the veil," she said. "I did begin my novitiate."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"No, in Russia. There are a few foreign cloistered orders there....
But I had a tragic awakening...." She bent her head and quoted
softly, "'For the former things have passed away.'"</p>

<p>The orange ice was melting; she stirred it idly, watching it
dissolve.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "I had utterly misunderstood the scheme of things.
Divinity is not a sad, a solemn, a solitary autocrat demanding
selfish tribute, blind allegiance, inexorable self-abasement.
It is not an insecure tyrant offering bribery for the cringing,
frightened servitude demanded."</p>

<p>She looked up smilingly at the man: "Nor, within us, is there
any soul in the accepted meaning,&mdash;no satellite released at death
to revolve around or merge into some super-divinity. No!</p>

<p>"For I believe, &mdash;I <em>know</em>&mdash;that the body&mdash;every
one's body&mdash;is inhabited by a complete god, immortal, retaining
its divine entity, beholden to no other deity save only itself,
and destined to encounter in a divine democracy and through endless
futures, unnumbered brother gods&mdash;the countless divinities which
have possessed and shall possess those tenements of mankind which
we call our bodies.... You do not, of course, subscribe to such
a faith," she added, meeting his gaze.</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" He hesitated. She said:</p>

<p>"Autocracy in heaven is as unthinkable, as unbelievable, and
as obnoxious to me as is autocracy on earth. There is no such
thing as divine right, here or elsewhere,&mdash;no divine prerogatives
for tyranny, for punishment, for cruelty."</p>

<p>"How did you happen to embrace such a faith?" he asked, bewildered.</p>

<p>"I was sick of the scheme of things. Suffering, cruelty, death
outraged my common sense. It is not in me to say, 'Thy will be
done,' to any autocrat, heavenly or earthly. It is not in me to
fawn on the hand that strikes me&mdash;or that strikes any helpless
thing! No! And the scheme of things sickened me, and I nearly
died of it&#11834;"</p>

<p>She clenched her hand where it rested on the table, and he saw
her face flushed and altered by the fire within. Then she smiled
and leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p>"In you," she said gaily, "dwells a god. In me a goddess,&mdash;a
joyous one,&mdash;a divine thing that laughs,&mdash;a complete and free
divinity that is gay and tender, that is incapable of tyranny,
that loves all things both, great and small, that exists to serve&mdash;freely,
not for reward&mdash;that owes allegiance and obedience only to the
divine and eternal law within its own godhead. And that law is
the law of love.... And that is my substitute for the scheme of
things. Could you subscribe?"</p>

<p>After a silence he quoted: "<em>Could you and I with Him conspire</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>She nodded: "'<em>To grasp this sorry scheme of things entire</em>&#11834;'
But there is no '<em>Him</em>.' It's you and <em>I.... </em>Both
divine.... Suppose we grasp it and '<em>shatter it to bits</em>.'
Shall we?"</p>

<p>"'<em>And then remould it nearer to the heart's desire?</em>'"</p>

<p>"Remould it nearer to the logic of common sense."</p>

<p>Neither spoke for a few moments. Then she drew a swift, smiling
breath.</p>

<p>"We're getting on rather rapidly, aren't we?" she said. "Did
you expect to lunch with such a friendly, human girl? And will
you now take her to inspect this modest house which you hope may
suit her, and which, she most devoutly hopes may suit her, too?"</p>

<p>"This has been a perfectly delightful day," he said as they rose.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to corroborate you?"</p>

<p>"Could you?"</p>

<p>"I've had a wonderful time," she said lightly.</p>
