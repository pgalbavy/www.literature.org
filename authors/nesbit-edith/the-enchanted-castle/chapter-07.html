<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"<em>CAN </em>you recommend me to a good hotel?" The speaker
had no inside to his head. Gerald had the best of reasons for
knowing it. The speaker's coat had no shoulders inside it&mdash;only
the cross-bar that a jacket is slung on by careful ladies. The
hand raised in interrogation was not a hand at all; it was a glove
lumpily stuffed with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the arm attached
to it was only Kathleen's school umbrella. Yet the whole thing
was alive, and was asking a definite, and for anybody else, anybody
who really <em>was</em> a body, a reasonable question.</p>

<p>With a sensation of inward sinking, Gerald realised that now
or never was the time for him to rise to the occasion. And at
the thought he inwardly sank more deeply than before. It seemed
impossible to rise in the very smallest degree.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon" was absolutely the best he could do; and
the painted, pointed paper face turned to him once more, and once
more said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Aa oo r√© o me me oo a oo ho el?"</p>

<p>"You want a hotel?" Gerald repeated stupidly, "a <em>good</em>
hotel?"</p>

<p>"A oo ho el," reiterated the painted lips.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," Gerald went on&mdash;one can always be polite,
of course, whatever happens, and politeness came natural to him&mdash;"but
all our hotels shut so early&mdash;about eight, I think."</p>

<p>"Och em er," said the Ugly-Wugly. Gerald even now does not understand
how that practical joke&mdash;hastily wrought of hat, overcoat, paper
face and limp hands&mdash;could have managed, by just being alive,
to become perfectly respectable, apparently about fifty years
old, and obviously well off, known and respected in his own suburb&mdash;the
kind of man who travels first class and smokes expensive cigars.
Gerald knew this time, without need of repetition, that the Ugly-Wugly
had said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Knock 'em up."</p>

<p>"You can't," Gerald explained; "they're all stone deaf&mdash;every
single person who keeps a hotel in this town. It's&mdash;" he wildly
plunged&mdash;"it's a County Council law. Only deaf people allowed
to keep hotels. It's because of the hops in the beer," he found
himself adding; "you know, hops are so good for earache."</p>

<p>"I o wy ollo oo," said the respectable Ugly-Wugly; and Gerald
was not surprised to find that the thing did "not quite follow
him."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> a little difficult at first," he said. The other
Ugly-Wuglies were crowding round. The lady in the poke bonnet
said &mdash;Gerald found he was getting quite clever at understanding
the conversation of those who had no roofs to their mouths:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If not a hotel, a lodging."</p>

<p>"My lodging is on the cold ground," sang itself unhidden and
unavailing in Gerald's ear. Yet stay&mdash;was it unavailing?</p>

<p>"I do know a lodging," he said slowly, "but<hr>" The tallest
of the Ugly-Wuglies pushed forward. He was dressed in the old
brown overcoat and top-hat which always hung on the school hat-stand
to discourage possible burglars by deluding them into the idea
that there was a gentleman-of-the-house, and that he was at home.
He had an air at once more sporting and less reserved than that
of the first speaker, and any one could see that he was not quite
a gentleman.</p>

<p>"Wa I wo oo oh," he began, but the lady Ugly-Wugly in the flower-wreathed
hat interrupted him. She spoke more distinctly than the others,
owing, as Gerald found afterwards, to the fact that her mouth
had been drawn <em>open</em>, and the flap cut from the aperture
had been folded back&mdash;so that she really had something like a
roof to her mouth, though it was only a paper one.</p>

<p>"What <em>I</em> want to know," Gerald understood her to say,
"is where are the carriages we ordered?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Gerald, "but I'll find out. But we ought
to be moving," he added; "you see, the performance is over, and
they want to shut up the house and put the lights out. Let's be
moving."</p>

<p>"Eh&mdash;ech e oo-ig," repeated the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and stepped
towards the front door.</p>

<p>"Oo um oo," said the flower-wreathed one; and Gerald assures
me that her vermilion lips stretched in a smile.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted," said Gerald with earnest courtesy, "to
do anything, of course. Things do happen so awkwardly when you
least expect it. I could go with you, and get you a lodging, if
you'd only wait a few moments in the&mdash;in the yard. It's quite
a superior sort of yard," he went on, as a wave of surprised disdain
passed over their white paper faces&mdash;"not a common yard, you know;
the pump," he added madly, "has just been painted green all over,
and the dustbin is enamelled iron."</p>

<p>The Ugly-Wuglies turned to each other in consultation, and Gerald
gathered that the greenness of the pump and the enamelled character
of the dust-bin made, in their opinion, all the difference.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry," he urged eagerly, "to have to ask you to
wait, but you see I've got an uncle who's quite mad, and I have
to give him his gruel at half-past nine. He won't feed out of
any hand but mine." Gerald did not mind what he said. The only
people one is allowed to tell lies to are the Ugly-Wuglies; they
are all clothes and have no insides, because they are not human
beings, but only a sort of very real visions, and therefore cannot
be really deceived, though they may seem to be.</p>

<p>Through the back door that has the blue, yellow, red and green
glass in it, down the iron steps into the yard, Gerald led the
way, and the Ugly-Wuglies trooped after him. Some of them had
boots, but the ones whose feet were only broomsticks or umbrellas
found the open-work iron stairs very awkward.</p>

<p>"If you wouldn't <em>mind</em>," said Gerald, "just waiting <em>under</em>
the balcony? My uncle is so <em>very</em> mad. If he were to see&mdash;see
any strangers&mdash;I mean, even aristocratic ones &mdash;I couldn't
answer for the consequences."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said the flower-hatted lady nervously, "it would be
better for us to try and find a lodging ourselves?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't advise you to," said Gerald as grimly as he knew
how; "the police here arrest <em>all</em> strangers. It's the
new law the Liberals have just made," he added convincingly, "and
you'd get the sort of lodging you wouldn't care for &mdash;I couldn't
bear to think of you in a prison dungeon," he added tenderly.</p>

<p>"I ah wi oo er papers," said the respectable Ugly-Wugly, and
added something that sounded like "disgraceful state of things."</p>

<p>However, they ranged themselves under the iron balcony. Gerald
gave one last look at them and wondered, in his secret heart,
why he was not frightened, though in his outside mind he was congratulating
himself on his bravery. For the things did look rather horrid.
In that light it was hard to believe that they were really only
clothes and pillows and sticks&mdash;with no insides. As he went up
the steps he heard them talking among themselves&mdash;in that strange
language of theirs, all oo's and ah's; and he thought he distinguished
the voice of the respectable Ugly-Wugly saying, "Most gentlemanly
lad," and the wreathed-hatted lady answering warmly: "Yes, indeed."</p>

<p>The coloured-glass door closed behind him. Behind him was the
yard, peopled by seven impossible creatures. Before him lay the
silent house, peopled, as he knew very well, by five human beings
as frightened as human beings could be. You think, perhaps, that
Ugly-Wuglies are nothing to be frightened of. That's only because
you have never seen one come alive. You just make one&mdash;any old
suit of your father's, and a hat that he isn't wearing, a bolster
or two, a painted paper face, a few sticks and a pair of boots
will do the trick; get your father to lend you a wishing ring,
give it back to him when it has done its work, and see how you
feel then.</p>

<p>Of course the reason why Gerald was not afraid was that he had
the ring; and, as you have seen, the wearer of that is not frightened
by <em>anything</em> unless he touches that thing. But Gerald
knew well enough how the others must be feeling. That was why
he stopped for a moment in the hall to try and imagine what would
have been most soothing to him if he had been as terrified as
he knew they were.</p>

<p>"Cathy! I say! What ho, Jimmy! Mabel ahoy!" he cried in a loud,
cheerful voice that sounded very unreal to himself.</p>

<p>The dining-room door opened a cautious inch.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;such larks!" Gerald went on, shoving gently at the door
with his shoulder. "Look out! what are you keeping the door shut
for?"</p>

<p>"Are you&mdash;alone?" asked Kathleen in hushed, breathless tones.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Don't be a duffer!"</p>

<p>The door opened, revealing three scared faces and the disarranged
chairs where that odd audience had sat.</p>

<p>"Where are they? Have you unwished them? We heard them talking.
Horrible!"</p>

<p>"They're in the yard," said Gerald with the best imitation of
joyous excitement that he could manage. "It <em>is</em> such fun!
They're just like real people, quite kind and jolly. It's the
most ripping lark. Don't let on to Mademoiselle and Eliza. I'll
square <em>them</em>. Then Kathleen and Jimmy must go to bed,
and I'll see Mabel home, and as soon as we get outside I must
find some sort of lodging for the Ugly-Wuglies&mdash;they <em>are</em>
such fun though. I <em>do</em> wish you could all go with me."</p>

<p>"Fun?" echoed Kathleen dismally and doubting.</p>

<p>"Perfectly killing," Gerald asserted resolutely. "Now, you just
listen to what I say to Mademoiselle and Eliza, and back me up
for all you're worth."</p>

<p>"But," said Mabel, "you can't mean that you're going to leave
me alone directly we get out, and go off with those horrible creatures.
They look like fiends."</p>

<p>"You wait till you've seen them close," Gerald advised. "Why,
they're just <em>ordinary</em>&mdash;the first thing one of them did
was to ask me to recommend it to a good hotel! I couldn't understand
it at first, because it has no roof to its mouth, of course."</p>

<p>It was a mistake to say that, Gerald knew it at once.</p>

<p>Mabel and Kathleen were holding hands in a way that plainly showed
how a few moments ago they had been clinging to each other in
an agony of terror. Now they clung again. And Jimmy, who was sitting
on the edge of what had been the stage, kicking his boots against
the pink counterpane, shuddered visibly.</p>

<p>"It doesn't <em>matter</em>," Gerald explained&mdash;"about the roofs,
I mean; you soon get to understand. I heard them say I was a gentlemanly
lad as I was coming away. They wouldn't have cared to notice a
little thing like that if they'd been fiends, you know."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter how gentlemanly they think you; if you don't
see me home you <em>aren't</em>, that's all. Are you going to?"
Mabel demanded.</p>

<p>"Of course I am. We shall have no end of a lark. Now for Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>He had put on his coat as he spoke and now ran up the stairs.
The others, herding in the hall, could hear his light-hearted
there's-nothing-unusual-the-matter-whatever-did-you-bolt-like-that-for
knock at Mademoiselle's door, the reassuring "It's only me &mdash;Gerald,
you know," the pause, the opening of the door, and the low-voiced
parley that followed; then Mademoiselle and Gerald at Eliza's
door, voices of reassurance; Eliza's terror, bluntly voluble,
tactfully soothed.</p>

<p>"Wonder what lies he's telling them," Jimmy grumbled.</p>

<p>"Oh! not <em>lies</em>," said Mabel; "he's only telling them
as much of the truth as it's good for them to know."</p>

<p>"If you'd been a man," said Jimmy witheringly, "you'd have been
a beastly Jesuit, and hid up chimneys."</p>

<p>"If I were only just a boy," Mabel retorted, "I shouldn't be
scared out of my life by a pack of old coats."</p>

<p>"I'm <em>so</em> sorry you were frightened," Gerald's honeyed
tones floated down the staircase; "we didn't think about you being
frightened. And it <em>was</em> a good trick, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"There!" whispered Jimmy, "he's been telling her it was a trick
of ours."</p>

<p>"Well, so it was," said Mabel stoutly.</p>

<p>"It was indeed a wonderful trick," said Mademoiselle; "and how
did you move the mannikins?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we've often done it&mdash;with strings, you know," Gerald explained.</p>

<p>"That's true, too," Kathleen whispered.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>WONDER WHAT LIES HE'S TELLING THEM," JIMMY
GRUMBLED</em>.]</p>

<p>"Let us see you do once again this trick so remarkable," said
Mademoiselle, arriving at the bottom-stair mat.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've cleared them all out," said Gerald. ("So he has," from
Kathleen aside to Jimmy.) "We were so sorry you were startled;
we thought you wouldn't like to see them again."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mademoiselle brightly, as she peeped into the untidy
dining-room and saw that the figures had indeed vanished, "if
we supped and discoursed of your beautiful piece of theatre?"</p>

<p>Gerald explained fully how much his brother and sister would
enjoy this. As for him &mdash;Mademoiselle would see that it was
his duty to escort Mabel home, and kind as it was of Mademoiselle
to ask her to stay the night, it could not be, on account of the
frenzied and anxious affection of Mabel's aunt. And it was useless
to suggest that Eliza should see Mabel home, because Eliza was
nervous at night unless accompanied by her gentleman friend.</p>

<p>So Mabel was hatted with her own hat and cloaked with a cloak
that was not hers; and she and Gerald went out by the front door,
amid kind last words and appointments for the morrow.</p>

<p>The moment that front door was shut Gerald caught Mabel by the
arm and led her briskly to the corner of the side street which
led to the yard. Just round the corner he stopped.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "what I want to know is&mdash;are you an idiot or
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Idiot yourself!" said Mabel, but mechanically, for she saw that
he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"Because <em>I'm</em> not frightened of the Ugly-Wuglies. They're
as harmless as tame rabbits. But an idiot might be frightened,
and give the whole show away. If you're an idiot, say so, and
I'll go back and tell them you're afraid to walk home, and that
I'll go and let your aunt know you're stopping."</p>

<p>"I'm not an idiot," said Mabel; "and," she added, glaring round
her with the wild gaze of the truly terror-stricken, "I'm not
afraid of <em>anything</em>."</p>

<p>"I'm going to let you share my difficulties and dangers," said
Gerald; "at least, I'm inclined to let you. I wouldn't do as much
for my own brother, I can tell you. And if you queer my pitch
I'll never speak to you again or let the others either."</p>

<p>"You're a beast, that's what you are! I don't need to be threatened
to make me brave. I <em>am</em>."</p>

<p>"Mabel," said Gerald, in low, thrilling tones, for he saw that
the time had come to sound another note, "I <em>know</em> you're
brave. I <em>believe</em> in you. That's why I've arranged it
like this. I'm certain you've got the heart of a lion under that
black-and-white exterior. Can I trust you? To the death?"</p>

<p>Mabel felt that to say anything but "Yes" was to throw away a
priceless reputation for courage. So "Yes" was what she said.</p>

<p>"Then wait here. You're close to the lamp. And when you see me
coming with <em>them</em> remember they're as harmless as serpents
&mdash;I mean doves. Talk to them just like you would to any one
else. See?"</p>

<p>He turned to leave her, but stopped at her natural question:</p>

<p>"What hotel did you say you were going to take them to?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jimminy!" the harassed Gerald caught at his hair with both
hands. "There! you see, Mabel, you're a help already"; he had,
even at that moment, some tact left. "I clean forgot! I meant
to ask you&mdash;isn't there any lodge or anything in the Castle grounds
where I could put them for the night? The charm will break, you
know, some time, like being invisible did, and they'll just be
a pack of coats and things that we can easily carry home any day.
Is there a lodge or anything?"</p>

<p>"There's a secret passage," Mabel began&mdash;but at that moment the
yard-door opened and an Ugly-Wugly put out its head and looked
anxiously down the street.</p>

<p>"Righto!" &mdash;Gerald ran to meet it. It was all Mabel could
do not to run in an opposite direction with an opposite motive.
It was all she could do, but she did it, and was proud of herself
as long as ever she remembered that night.</p>

<p>And now, with all the silent precaution necessitated by the near
presence of an extremely insane uncle, the Ugly-Wuglies, a grisly
band, trooped out of the yard door.</p>

<p>"Walk on your toes, dear," the bonneted Ugly-Wugly whispered
to the one with a wreath; and even at that thrilling crisis Gerald
wondered how she could, since the toes of one foot were but the
end of a golf club and of the other the end of a hockey-stick.</p>

<p>Mabel felt that there was no shame in retreating to the lamp-post
at the street corner, but, once there, she made herself halt&mdash;and
no one but Mabel will ever know how much making that took. Think
of it&mdash;to stand there, firm and quiet, and wait for those hollow,
unbelievable things to come up to her, clattering on the pavement
with their stumpy feet or borne along noiselessly, as in the case
of the flower-hatted lady, by a skirt that touched the ground,
and had, Mabel knew very well, nothing at all inside it.</p>

<p>She stood very still; the insides of her hands grew cold and
damp, but still she stood, saying over and over again: "They're
not true&mdash;they can't be true. It's only a dream&mdash;they aren't really
true. They can't be." And then Gerald was there, and all the Ugly-Wuglies
crowding round, and Gerald saying:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is one of our friends, Mabel&mdash;the Princess in the play,
you know. Be a man!" he added in a whisper for her ear alone.</p>

<p>Mabel, all her nerves stretched tight as banjo strings, had an
awful instant of not knowing whether she would be able to be a
man or whether she would be merely a shrieking and running little
mad girl. For the respectable Ugly-Wugly shook her limply by the
hand ("He <em>can't</em> be true," she told herself), and the
rose-wreathed one took her arm with a soft-padded glove at the
end of an umbrella arm, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You dear, clever little thing! <em>Do</em> walk with me!" in
a gushing, girlish way, and in speech almost wholly lacking in
consonants.</p>

<p>Then they all walked up the High Street as if, as Gerald said,
they were anybody else.</p>

<p>It was a strange procession, but Liddlesby goes early to bed,
and the Liddlesby police, in common with those of most other places,
wear boots that one can hear a mile off. If such boots had been
heard, Gerald would have had time to turn back and head them off.
He felt now that he could not resist a flush of pride in Mabel's
courage as he heard her polite rejoinders to the still more polite
remarks of the amiable Ugly-Wuglies. He did not know how near
she was to the scream that would throw away the whole thing and
bring the police and the residents out to the ruin of everybody.</p>

<p>They met no one, except one man, who murmured, "Guy Fawkes, swelp
me!" and crossed the road hurriedly; and when, next day, he told
what he had seen, his wife disbelieved him, and also said it was
a judgment on him, which was unreasonable.</p>

<p>[Illustration: IT <em>WAS A STRANGE PROCESSION</em>.]</p>

<p>Mabel felt as though she were taking part in a very completely
arranged nightmare, but Gerald was in it too, Gerald, who had
asked if she was an idiot. Well, she wasn't. But she soon would
be, she felt. Yet she went on answering the courteous vowel-talk
of these impossible people. She had often heard her aunt speak
of impossible people. Well, now she knew what they were like.</p>

<p>Summer twilight had melted into summer moonlight. The shadows
of the Ugly-Wuglies on the white road were much more horrible
than their more solid selves. Mabel wished it had been a dark
night, and then corrected the wish with a hasty shudder.</p>

<p>Gerald, submitting to a searching interrogatory from the tall-hatted
Ugly-Wugly as to his schools, his sports, pastimes, and ambitions,
wondered how long the spell would last. The ring seemed to work
in sevens. Would these things have seven hours' life&mdash;or fourteen&mdash;or
twenty-one? His mind lost itself in the intricacies of the seven-times
table (a teaser at the best of times) and only found itself with
a shock when the procession found <em>itself</em> at the gates
of the Castle grounds.</p>

<p>Locked&mdash;of course.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, as the Ugly-Wuglies vainly shook the
iron gates with incredible hands; "it's so very late. There <em>is</em>
another way. But you have to climb through a hole."</p>

<p>"The ladies," the respectable Ugly-Wugly began objecting; but
the ladies with one voice affirmed that they loved adventures.
"So frightfully thrilling," added the one who wore roses.</p>

<p>So they went round by the road, and coming to the hole&mdash;it was
a little difficult to find in the moonlight, which always disguises
the most familiar things &mdash;Gerald went first with the bicycle
lantern which he had snatched as his pilgrims came out of the
yard; the shrinking Mabel followed, and then the Ugly-Wuglies,
with hollow rattlings of their wooden limbs against the stone,
crept through, and with strange vowel-sounds of general amazement,
manly courage, and feminine nervousness, followed the light along
the passage through the fern-hung cutting and under the arch.</p>

<p>When they emerged on the moonlit enchantment of the Italian garden
a quite intelligible "Oh!" of surprised admiration broke from
more than one painted paper lip; and the respectable Ugly-Wugly
was understood to say that it must be quite a show-place&mdash;by George,
sir! yes.</p>

<p>Those marble terraces and artfully serpentining gravel walks
surely never had echoed to steps so strange. No shadows so wildly
unbelievable had, for all its enchantments, ever fallen on those
smooth, gray, dewy lawns. Gerald was thinking this, or something
like it (what he really thought was, "I bet there never was such
a go as this, even here!"), when he saw the statue of Hermes leap
from its pedestal and run towards him and his company with all
the lively curiosity of a street boy eager to be in at a street
fight. He saw, too, that he was the only one who perceived that
white advancing presence. And he knew that it was the ring that
let him see what by others could not be seen. He slipped it from
his finger. Yes; Hermes was on his pedestal, still as the snow
man you make in the Christmas holidays. He put the ring on again,
and there was Hermes, circling round the group and gazing deep
in each unconscious Ugly-Wugly face.</p>

<p>"This seems a very superior hotel," the tall-hatted Ugly-Wugly
was saying; "the grounds are laid out with what you might call
taste."</p>

<p>"We should have to go in by the back door," said Mabel suddenly.
"The front door's locked at half-past nine."</p>

<p>A short, stout Ugly-Wugly in a yellow and blue cricket cap, who
had hardly spoken, muttered something about an escapade, and about
feeling quite young again.</p>

<p>And now they had skirted the marble-edged pool where the gold
fish swam and glimmered, and where the great prehistoric beast
had come down to bathe and drink. The water flashed white diamonds
in the moonlight, and Gerald alone of them all saw that the scaly-plated
vast lizard was even now rolling and wallowing there among the
lily pads.</p>

<p>They hastened up the steps of the Temple of Flora. The back of
it, where no elegant arch opened to the air, was against one of
those sheer hills, almost cliffs, that diversified the landscape
of that garden. Mabel passed behind the statue of the goddess,
fumbled a little, and then Gerald's lantern, flashing like a search-light,
showed a very high and very narrow doorway: the stone that was
the door, and that had closed it, revolved slowly under the touch
of Mabel's fingers.</p>

<p>"This way," she said, and panted a little. The back of her neck
felt cold and goose-fleshy.</p>

<p>"You lead the way, my lad, with the lantern," said the suburban
Ugly-Wugly in his bluff, agreeable way.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I must, stay behind to close the door," said Gerald.</p>

<p>"The Princess can do that. <em>We'll</em> help her," said the
wreathed one with effusion; and Gerald thought her horribly officious.</p>

<p>He insisted gently that he would be the one responsible for the
safe shutting of that door.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't like me to get into trouble, I'm sure," he urged;
and the Ugly-Wuglies, for the last time kind and reasonable, agreed
that this, of all things, they would most deplore.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> take it," Gerald urged, pressing the bicycle lamp
on the elderly Ugly-Wugly; "you're the natural leader. Go straight
ahead. Are there any steps?" he asked Mabel in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Not for ever so long," she whispered back. "It goes on for ages,
and then twists round."</p>

<p>"Whispering," said the smallest Ugly-Wugly suddenly, "ain't manners."</p>

<p>"<em>He</em> hasn't any, anyhow," whispered the lady Ugly-Wugly;
"don't mind him&mdash;quite a self-made man," and squeezed Mabel's
arm with horrible confidential flabbiness.</p>

<p>The respectable Ugly-Wugly leading with the lamp, the others
following trustfully, one and all disappeared into that narrow
doorway; and Gerald and Mabel standing without, hardly daring
to breathe lest a breath should retard the procession, almost
sobbed with relief. Prematurely, as it turned out. For suddenly
there was a rush and a scuffle inside the passage, and as they
strove to close the door the Ugly-Wuglies fiercely pressed to
open it again. Whether they saw something in the dark passage
that alarmed them, whether they took it into their empty heads
that this could not be the back way to any really respectable
hotel, or whether a convincing sudden instinct warned them that
they were being tricked, Mabel and Gerald never knew. But they
knew that the Ugly-Wuglies were no longer friendly and commonplace,
that a fierce change had come over them. Cries of "No, No!" "We
won't go on!" "Make <em>him</em> lead!" broke the dreamy stillness
of the perfect night. There were screams from ladies' voices,
the hoarse, determined shouts of strong Ugly-Wuglies roused to
resistance, and, worse than all, the steady pushing open of that
narrow stone door that had almost closed upon the ghastly crew.
Through the chink of it they could be seen, a writhing black crowd
against the light of the bicycle lamp; a padded hand reached round
the door; stick-boned arms stretched out angrily towards the world
that that door, if it closed, would shut them off from for ever.
And the tone of their consonantless speech was no longer conciliatory
and ordinary; it was threatening, full of the menace of unbearable
horrors.</p>

<p>The padded hand fell on Gerald's arm, and instantly all the terrors
that he had, so far, only known in imagination became real to
him, and he saw, in the sort of flash that shows drowning people
their past lives, what it was that he had asked of Mabel, and
that she had given.</p>

<p>"Push, push for your life!" he cried, and setting his heel against
the pedestal of Flora, pushed manfully.</p>

<p>"I can't any more&mdash;oh. I can't!" moaned Mabel, and tried to use
her heel likewise, but her legs were too short.</p>

<p>"They mustn't get out, they mustn't!" Gerald panted.</p>

<p>"You'll know it when we do," came from inside the door in tones
which fury and mouth-rooflessness would have made unintelligible
to any ears but those sharpened by the wild fear of that unspeakable
moment.</p>

<p>"What's up, there?" cried suddenly a new voice&mdash;a voice with
all its consonants comforting, clean-cut, and ringing, and abruptly
a new shadow fell on the marble floor of Flora's temple.</p>

<p>"Come and help push!" Gerald's voice only just reached the newcomer.
"If they get out they'll kill us all."</p>

<p>A strong, velveteen-covered shoulder pushed suddenly between
the shoulders of Gerald and Mabel; a stout man's heel sought the
aid of the goddess's pedestal; the heavy, narrow door yielded
slowly, it closed, its spring clicked, and the furious, surging,
threatening mass of Ugly-Wuglies was shut in, and Gerald and Mabel&mdash;oh,
incredible relief!&mdash;were shut out. Mabel threw herself on the
marble floor, sobbing slow, heavy sobs of achievement and exhaustion.
If I had been there I should have looked the other way, so as
not to see whether Gerald yielded himself to the same abandonment.</p>

<p>The newcomer he appeared to be a gamekeeper, Gerald decided later&mdash;looked
down on&mdash;well, certainly on Mabel, and said:</p>

<p>"Come on, don't be a little duffer." (He may have said, "a couple
of little duffers.") "Who is it, and what's it all about?"</p>

<p>"I can't possibly tell you," Gerald panted.</p>

<p>"We shall have to see about that, shan't we," said the newcomer
amiably. "Come out into the moonlight and let's review the situation."</p>

<p>Gerald, even in that topsy-turvy state of his world, found time
to think that a gamekeeper who used such words as that had most
likely a romantic past. But at the same time he saw that such
a man would be far less easy to "square" with an unconvincing
tale than Eliza, or Johnson, or even Mademoiselle. In fact, he
seemed, with the only tale that they had to tell, practically
unsquarable.</p>

<p>Gerald got up&mdash;if he was not up already, or still up&mdash;and pulled
at the limp and now hot hand of the sobbing Mabel; and as he did
so the unsquarable one took <em>his</em> hand, and thus led both
children out from under the shadow of Flora's dome into the bright
white moonlight that carpeted Flora's steps. Here he sat down,
a child on each side of him, drew a hand of each through his velveteen
arm, pressed them to his velveteen sides in a friendly, reassuring
way, and said: "Now then! Go ahead!"</p>

<p>Mabel merely sobbed. We must excuse her. She had been very brave,
and I have no doubt that all heroines, from Joan of Arc to Grace
Darling, have had their sobbing moments.</p>

<p>But Gerald said: "It's no use. If I made up a story you'd see
through it."</p>

<p>"That's a compliment to my discernment, anyhow," said the stranger.
"What price telling me the truth?"</p>

<p>"If we told you the truth," said Gerald, "you wouldn't believe
it."</p>

<p>"Try me," said the velveteen one. He was clean-shaven, and had
large eyes that sparkled when the moonlight touched them.</p>

<p>"I <em>can't</em>," said Gerald, and it was plain that he spoke
the truth. "You'd either think we were mad, and get us shut up,
or else&mdash;oh, it's no good. Thank you for helping us, and do let
us go home."</p>

<p>"I wonder," said the stranger musingly, "whether you have any
imagination."</p>

<p>"Considering that we invented them," Gerald hotly began, and
stopped with late prudence.</p>

<p>"If by 'them' you mean the people whom I helped you to imprison
in yonder tomb," said the stranger, loosing Mabel's hand to put
his arm round her, "remember that I saw and heard them. And with
all respect to your imagination, I doubt whether any invention
of yours would be quite so convincing."</p>

<p>Gerald put his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands.</p>

<p>"Collect yourself," said the one in velveteen; "and while you
are collecting, let me just put the thing from my point of view.
I think you hardly realise my position. I come down from London
to take care of a big estate."</p>

<p>"I <em>thought</em> you were a gamekeeper," put in Gerald.</p>

<p>Mabel put her head on the stranger's shoulder. "Hero in disguise,
then, <em>I</em> know," she sniffed.</p>

<p>"Not at all," said he; "bailiff would be nearer the mark. On
the very first evening I go out to take the moonlit air, and approaching
a white building, hear sounds of an agitated scuffle, accompanied
by frenzied appeals for assistance. Carried away by the enthusiasm
of the moment, I <em>do</em> assist and shut up goodness knows
who behind a stone door. Now, is it unreasonable that I should
ask who it is that I've shut up&mdash;helped to shut up, I mean, and
who it is that I've assisted?"</p>

<p>"It's reasonable enough," Gerald admitted.</p>

<p>"Well then," said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Well then," said Gerald, "the fact is<hr> No," he added after
a pause, "the fact is, I simply can't tell you."</p>

<p>"Then I must ask the other side," said Velveteens. "Let me go
&mdash;I'll undo that door and find out for myself."</p>

<p>"Tell him," said Mabel, speaking for the first time. "Never mind
if he believes or not. We can't have them let out."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Gerald, "I'll tell him. Now look here, Mr.
Bailiff, will you promise us on an English gentleman's word of
honour&mdash;because, of course, I can see you're <em>that</em>, bailiff
or not&mdash;will you promise that you won't tell any one what we tell
you and that you won't have us put in a lunatic asylum, however
mad we sound?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the stranger, "I think I can promise that. But if
you've been having a sham fight or anything and shoved the other
side into that hole, don't you think you'd better let them out?
They'll be most awfully frightened, you know. After all, I suppose
they are only children."</p>

<p>"Wait till you hear," Gerald answered. "They're not children&mdash;not
much! Shall I just tell about them or begin at the beginning?"</p>

<p>"The beginning, of course," said the stranger.</p>

<p>Mabel lifted her head from his velveteen shoulder and said, "Let
me begin, then. I found a ring, and I said it would make me invisible.
I said it in play. And it <em>did</em>. I was invisible twenty-one
hours. Never mind where I got the ring. Now, Gerald, you go on."</p>

<p>Gerald went on; for quite a long time he went on, for the story
was a splendid one to tell.</p>

<p>"And so," he ended, "we got them in there; and when seven hours
are over, or fourteen, or twenty-one, or something with a seven
in it, they'll just be old coats again. They came alive at half-past
nine. <em>I</em> think they'll stop being it in seven hours&mdash;that's
half-past four. <em>Now</em> will you let us go home?"</p>

<p>"I'll see you home," said the stranger in a quite new tone of
exasperating gentleness. "Come&mdash;let's be going."</p>

<p>"You don't believe us," said Gerald. "Of course you don't. Nobody
could. But I could make you believe if I chose."</p>

<p>All three stood up, and the stranger stared in Gerald's eyes
till Gerald answered his thought.</p>

<p>"No, I don't look mad, do I?"</p>

<p>"No, you aren't. But, come, you're an extraordinarily sensible
boy; don't you think you may be sickening for a fever or something?"</p>

<p>"And Cathy and Jimmy and Mademoiselle and Eliza, and the man
who said 'Guy Fawkes, swelp me!' and <em>you</em>, you saw them
move&mdash;you heard them call out. Are you sickening for anything?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;or at least not for anything but information. Come, and
I'll see you home."</p>

<p>"Mabel lives at the Towers," said Gerald, as the stranger turned
into the broad drive that leads to the big gate.</p>

<p>"No relation to Lord Yalding," said Mabel hastily&mdash;"housekeeper's
niece." She was holding on to his hand all the way. At the servants'
entrance she put up her face to be kissed, and went in.</p>

<p>"Poor little thing!" said the bailiff, as they went down the
drive towards the gate.</p>

<p>He went with Gerald to the door of the school.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Gerald at parting. "I know what you're going
to do. You're going to try to undo that door."</p>

<p>"Discerning!" said the stranger.</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;don't. Or, any way, wait till daylight and let us be there.
We can get there by ten."</p>

<p>"All right &mdash;I'll meet you there by ten," answered the stranger.
"By George! you're the rummest kids I ever met."</p>

<p>"We are rum," Gerald owned, "but so would you be if<hr> Good
night."</p>

<p>As the four children went over the smooth lawn towards Flora's
Temple they talked, as they had talked all the morning, about
the adventures of last night and of Mabel's bravery. It was not
ten, but half-past twelve; for Eliza, backed by Mademoiselle,
had insisted on their "clearing up," and clearing up very thoroughly,
the "litter" of last night.</p>

<p>"You're a Victoria Cross heroine, dear," said Cathy warmly. "You
ought to have a statue put up to you."</p>

<p>"It would come alive if you put it here," said Gerald grimly.</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> shouldn't have been afraid," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"By daylight," Gerald assured him, "everything looks so jolly
different."</p>

<p>"I do hope he'll be there," Mabel said; "he <em>was</em> such
a dear, Cathy&mdash;a perfect bailiff, with the soul of a gentleman."</p>

<p>[Illustration: A <em>PAINTED POINTED PAPER FACE PEERED OUT</em>.]</p>

<p>"He isn't there, though," said Jimmy. "I believe you just dreamed
him, like you did the statues coming alive."</p>

<p>They went up the marble steps in the sunshine, and it was difficult
to believe that this was the place where only in last night's
moonlight fear had laid such cold hands on the hearts of Mabel
and Gerald.</p>

<p>"Shall we open the door," suggested Kathleen, "and begin to carry
home the coats?"</p>

<p>"Let's listen first," said Gerald; "perhaps they aren't only
coats yet."</p>

<p>They laid ears to the hinges of the stone door, behind which
last night the Ugly-Wuglies had shrieked and threatened. All was
still as the sweet morning itself. It was as they turned away
that they saw the man they had come to meet. He was on the other
side of Flora's pedestal. But he was not standing up. He lay there,
quite still, on his back, his arms flung wide.</p>

<p>"Oh, look!" cried Cathy, and pointed. His face was a queer greenish
colour, and on his forehead there was a cut; its edges were blue,
and a little blood had trickled from it on to the white of the
marble.</p>

<p>At the same time Mabel pointed too&mdash;but she did not cry out as
Cathy had done. And what she pointed at was a big glossy-leaved
rhododendron bush, from which a painted pointed paper face peered
out&mdash;very white, very red, in the sunlight&mdash;and, as the children
gazed, shrank back into the cover of the shining leaves.</p>
