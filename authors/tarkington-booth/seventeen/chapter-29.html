<p>Up-stairs, Mrs. Baxter moved to the door of her son's room, pretending
to be unconscious of the gaze he maintained upon her. Mustering
courage to hum a little tune and affecting inconsequence, she
had nearly crossed the threshold when he said, sternly:</p>

<p>"And this is all you intend to say to that child?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Willie."</p>

<p>"And yet I told you what she said!" he cried. "I told you I <em>HEARD
</em>her stand there and tell that dirty-faced little girl how
that idiot boy that's always walkin' past here four or five times
a day, whistling and looking back, was in 'love of' her! Ye gods!
What kind of a person will she grow up into if you don't punish
her for havin' ideas like that at her age?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter regarded him mildly, not replying, and he went on,
with loud indignation:</p>

<p>"I never heard of such a thing! That Worm walkin' past here four
or five times a day just to look at <em>JANE! </em>And her standing
there, calmly tellin' that sooty-faced little girl, 'He's in love
of me'! Why, it's enough to sicken a man! Honestly, if I had my
way, I'd see that both she and that little Freddie Banks got a
first-class whipping!"</p>

<p>"Don't you think, Willie," said Mrs. Baxter&mdash;"don't you think
that, considering the rather noncommittal method of Freddie's
courtship, you are suggesting extreme measures?"</p>

<p>"Well, <em>SHE </em>certainly ought to be punished!" he insisted,
and then, with a reversal to agony, he shuddered. "That's the
least of it!" he cried. "It's the insulting things you always
allow her to say of one of the noblest girls in the United States
&mdash;<em>THAT'S </em>what counts! On the very last day&mdash;yes,
almost the last hour&mdash;that Miss Pratt's in this town, you let
your only daughter stand there and speak disrespectfully of her&mdash;and
then all you do is tell her to 'go and play somewhere else'! I
don't understand your way of bringing up a child," he declared,
passionately. "I do <em>NOT</em>!"</p>

<p>"There, there, Willie," Mrs. Baxter said. "You're all wrought
up&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am <em>NOT </em>wrought up!" shouted William. "Why should
I be charged with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, now!" she said. "You'll feel better to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" he demanded, breathing deeply.</p>

<p>For reply she only shook her head in an odd little way, and in
her parting look at him there was something at once compassionate,
amused, and reassuring.</p>

<p>"You'll be all right, Willie," she said, softly, and closed the
door.</p>

<p>Alone, William lifted clenched hands in a series of tumultuous
gestures at the ceiling; then he moaned and sank into a chair
at his writing-table. Presently a comparative calm was restored
to him, and with reverent fingers he took from a drawer a one-pound
box of candy, covered with white tissue-paper, girdled with blue
ribbon. He set the box gently beside him upon the table; then
from beneath a large, green blotter drew forth some scribbled
sheets. These he placed before him, and, taking infinite pains
with his handwriting, slowly copied:</p>

<p><em>DEAR LOLA &mdash;</em>I presume when you are reading these
lines it will be this afternoon and you will be on the train moving
rapidly away from this old place here farther and farther from
it all. As I sit here at my old desk and look back upon it all
while I am writing this farewell letter I hope when you are reading
it you also will look back upon it all and think of one you called
(Alias) Little Boy Baxter. As I sit here this morning that you
are going away at last I look back and I cannot rember any summer
in my whole life which has been like this summer, because a great
change has come over me this summer. If you would like to know
what this means it was something like I said when John Watson
got there yesterday afternoon and interrupted what I said. May
you enjoy this candy and think of the giver. I will put something
in with this letter. It is something maybe you would like to have
and in exchange I would give all I possess for one of you if you
would send it to me when you get home. Please do this for now
my heart is braking. Yours sincerely, <em>WILLIAM S. BAXTER (ALIAS)
LITTLE BOY BAXTER</em>.</p>

<p>William opened the box of candy and placed the letter upon the
top layer of chocolates. Upon the letter he placed a small photograph
(wrapped in tissue-paper) of himself. Then, with a pair of scissors,
he trimmed an oblong of white cardboard to fit into the box. Upon
this piece of cardboard he laboriously wrote, copying from a tortured,
inky sheet before him:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
IN <em>DREAM<br/>
BY WILLIAM S. BAXTER</em>

</p>
<p>
The sunset light<br/>
Fades into night<br/>
But never will I forget<br/>
The smile that haunts me yet<br/>
Through the future four long years<br/>
I hope you will remember with tears<br/>
Whate'er my rank or station<br/>
Whilst receiving my education<br/>
Though far away you seem<br/>
I will see thee in dream.

</p>
</div>
<p>He placed his poem between the photograph and the letter, closed
the box, and tied the tissue-paper about it again with the blue
ribbon. Throughout these rites (they were rites both in spirit
and in manner) he was subject to little catchings of the breath,
half gulp, half sigh. But the dolorous tokens passed, and he sat
with elbows upon the table, his chin upon his hands, reverie in
his eyes. Tragedy had given way to gentler pathos;&mdash;beyond question,
something had measurably soothed him. Possibly, even in this hour
preceding the hour of parting, he knew a little of that proud
amazement which any poet is entitled to feel over each new lyric
miracle just wrought.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was helped, too, by wondering what Miss Pratt would
think of him when she read "In Dream," on the train that afternoon.
For reasons purely intuitive, and decidedly without foundation
in fact, he was satisfied that no rival farewell poem would be
offered her, and so it may be that he thought "In Dream" might
show her at last, in one blaze of light, what her eyes had sometimes
fleetingly intimated she did perceive in part&mdash;the difference
between William and such every-day, rather well-meaning, fairly
good-hearted people as Joe Bullitt, Wallace Banks, Johnnie Watson,
and others. Yes, when she came to read "In Dream," and to "look
back upon it all," she would surely know&mdash;at last!</p>

<p>And then, when the future four long years (while receiving his
education) had passed, he would go to her. He would go to her,
and she would take him by the hand, and lead him to her father,
and say, "Father, this is William."</p>

<p>But William would turn to her, and, with the old, dancing light
in his eyes, "No, Lola," he would say, "not William, but Ickle
Boy Baxter! Always and always, just that for you; oh, my dear!"</p>

<p>And then, as in story and film and farce and the pleasanter kinds
of drama, her father would say, with kindly raillery, "Well, when
you two young people get through, you'll find me in the library,
where I have a pretty good <em>BUSINESS </em>proposition to lay
before <em>YOU, </em>young man!"</p>

<p>And when the white-waistcoated, white-side-burned old man had,
chuckling, left the room, William would slowly lift his arms;
but Lola would move back from him a step&mdash;only a step&mdash;and after
laying a finger archly upon her lips to check him, "Wait, sir!"
she would say. "I have a question to ask you, sir!"</p>

<p>"What question, Lola?"</p>

<p>"<em>THIS </em>question, sir!" she would reply. "In all that
summer, sir, so long ago, why did you never tell me what you <em>WERE,
</em>until I had gone away and it was too late to show you what
I felt? Ah, Ickle Boy Baxter, I never understood until I looked
back upon it all, after I had read 'In Dream,' on the train that
day! <em>THEN I KNEW!" "</em>And now, Lola?" William would say.
"Do you understand me, <em>NOW</em>?"</p>

<p>Shyly she would advance the one short step she had put between
them, while he, with lifted, yearning arms, this time destined
to no disappointment&#11834;</p>

<p>At so vital a moment did Mrs. Baxter knock at his door and consoling
reverie cease to minister unto William. Out of the rosy sky he
dropped, falling miles in an instant, landing with a bump. He
started, placed the sacred box out of sight, and spoke gruffly.</p>

<p>"What you want?"</p>

<p>"I'm not coming in, Willie," said his mother. "I just wanted
to know &mdash;I thought maybe you were looking out of the window
and noticed where those children went."</p>

<p>"What children?"</p>

<p>"Jane and that little girl from across the street &mdash;Kirsted,
her name must be."</p>

<p>"No. I did not."</p>

<p>"I just wondered," Mrs. Baxter said, timidly. "Genesis thinks
he heard the little Kirsted girl telling Jane she had plenty of
money for carfare. He thinks they went somewhere on a street-car.
I thought maybe you noticed wheth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you I did not."</p>

<p>"All right," she said, placatively. "I didn't mean to bother
you, dear."</p>

<p>Following this there was a silence; but no sound of receding
footsteps indicated Mrs. Baxter's departure from the other side
of the closed door.</p>

<p>"Well, what you <em>WANT?" </em>William shouted.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing at all," said the compassionate voice. "I just
thought I'd have lunch a little later than usual; not till half
past one. That is if&mdash;well, I thought probably you meant to go
to the station to see Miss Pratt off on the one-o'clock train."</p>

<p>Even so friendly an interest as this must have appeared to the
quivering William an intrusion in his affairs, for he demanded,
sharply:</p>

<p>"How'd you find out she's going at one o'clock?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Jane mentioned it," Mrs. Baxter replied, with obvious
timidity. "Jane said&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the loud, desperate sound of William's
fist smiting his writing-table, so sensitive was his condition.
"This is just unbearable!" he cried. "Nobody's business is safe
from that child!"</p>

<p>"Why, Willie, I don't see how it matters if&mdash;"</p>

<p>He uttered a cry. "No! Nothing matters! Nothing matters at all!
Do you s'pose I want that child, with her insults, discussing
when Miss Pratt is or is not going away? Don't you know there
are <em>SOME </em>things that have no business to be talked about
by every Tom, Dick, and Harry?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she said. "I understand, of course. Jane only told
me she met Mr. Parcher on the street, and he mentioned that Miss
Pratt was going at one o'clock to-day. That's all I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You say you understand," he wailed, shaking his head drearily
at the closed door, "and yet, even on such a day as this, you
keep <em>TALKING! </em>Can't you see sometimes there's times when
a person can't stand to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Willie," Mrs. Baxter interposed, hurriedly. "Of course!
I'm going now. I have to go hunt up those children, anyway. You
try to be back for lunch at half past one&mdash;and don't worry, dear;
you really <em>WILL </em>be all right!"</p>

<p>She departed, a sigh from the abyss following her as she went
down the hall. Her comforting words meant nothing pleasant to
her son, who felt that her optimism was out of place and tactless.
He had no intention to be "all right," and he desired nobody to
interfere with his misery.</p>

<p>He went to his mirror, and, gazing long&mdash;long and piercingly&mdash;at
the William there limned, enacted, almost unconsciously, a little
scene of parting. The look of suffering upon the mirrored face
slowly altered; in its place came one still sorrowful, but tempered
with sweet indulgence. He stretched out his hand, as if he set
it upon a head at about the height of his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Yes, it may mean&mdash;it may mean forever!" he said in a low, tremulous
voice. "Little girl, we <em>MUST </em>be brave!"</p>

<p>And the while his eyes gazed into the mirror, they became expressive
of a momentary pleased surprise, as if, even in the arts of sorrow,
he found himself doing better than he knew. But his sorrow was
none the less genuine because of that.</p>

<p>Then he noticed the ink upon his forehead, and went away to wash.
When he returned he did an unusual thing&mdash;he brushed his coat
thoroughly, removing it for this special purpose. After that,
he earnestly combed and brushed his hair, and retied his tie.
Next, he took from a drawer two clean handkerchiefs. He placed
one in his breast pocket, part of the colored border of the handkerchief
being left on exhibition, and with the other he carefully wiped
his shoes. Finally, he sawed it back and forth across them, and,
with a sigh, languidly dropped it upon the floor, where it remained.</p>

<p>Returning to the mirror, he again brushed his hair&mdash;he went so
far, this time, as to brush his eyebrows, which seemed not much
altered by the operation. Suddenly, he was deeply affected by
something seen in the glass.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed aloud.</p>

<p>Seizing a small hand-mirror, he placed it in juxtaposition to
his right eye, and closely studied his left profile as exhibited
in the larger mirror. Then he examined his right profile, subjecting
it to a like scrutiny emotional, yet attentive and prolonged.</p>

<p>"By George!" he exclaimed, again. "By George!"</p>

<p>He had made a discovery. There was a downy shadow upon his upper
lip. What he had just found out was that this down could be seen
projecting beyond the line of his lip, like a tiny nimbus. It
could be seen in <em>PROFILE</em>.</p>

<p>"By <em>GEORGE!" </em>William exclaimed.</p>

<p>He was still occupied with the two mirrors when his mother again
tapped softly upon his door, rousing him as from a dream (brief
but engaging) to the heavy realities of that day.</p>

<p>"What you want now?"</p>

<p>"I won't come in," said Mrs. Baxter. "I just came to see."</p>

<p>"See what?"</p>

<p>"I wondered &mdash;I thought perhaps you needed something. I
knew your watch was out of order&mdash;"</p>

<p>"F'r 'evan's sake what if it is?"</p>

<p>She offered a murmur of placative laughter as her apology, and
said: "Well, I just thought I'd tell you&mdash;because if you did intend
going to the station, I thought you probably wouldn't want to
miss it and get there too late. I've got your hat here all nicely
brushed for you. It's nearly twenty minutes of one, Willie."</p>

<p>"<em>WHAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>She had no further speech with him.</p>

<p>Breathless, William flung open his door, seized the hat, racketed
down the stairs, and out through the front door, which he left
open behind him. Eight seconds later he returned at a gallop,
hurtled up the stairs and into his room, emerging instantly with
something concealed under his coat. Replying incoherently to his
mother's inquiries, he fell down the stairs as far as the landing,
used the impetus thus given as a help to greater speed for the
rest of the descent&mdash;and passed out of hearing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter sighed, and went to a window in her own room, and
looked out.</p>

<p>William was already more than half-way to the next corner, where
there was a car-line that ran to the station; but the distance
was not too great for Mrs. Baxter to comprehend the nature of
the symmetrical white parcel now carried in his right hand. Her
face became pensive as she gazed after the flying slender figure:&mdash;there
came to her mind the recollection of a seventeen-year-old boy
who had brought a box of candy (a small one, like William's) to
the station, once, long ago, when she had been visiting in another
town. For just a moment she thought of that boy she had known,
so many years ago, and a smile came vaguely upon her lips. She
wondered what kind of a woman he had married, and how many children
he had&mdash;and whether he was a widower&#11834;</p>

<p>The fleeting recollection passed; she turned from the window
and shook her head, puzzled.</p>

<p>"Now where on earth could Jane and that little Kirsted girl have
gone?"  she murmured.</p>

<p>... At the station, William, descending from the street-car,
found that he had six minutes to spare. Reassured of so much by
the great clock in the station tower, he entered the building,
and, with calm and dignified steps, crossed the large waiting-room.
Those calm and dignified steps were taken by feet which little
betrayed the tremulousness of the knees above them. Moreover,
though William's face was red, his expression&mdash;cold, and concentrated
upon high matters&mdash;scorned the stranger, and warned the lower
classes that the mission of this bit of gentry was not to them.</p>

<p>With but one sweeping and repellent glance over the canaille
present, he made sure that the person he sought was not in the
waiting-room. Therefore, he turned to the doors which gave admission
to the tracks, but before he went out he paused for an instant
of displeasure. Hard by the doors stood a telephone-booth, and
from inside this booth a little girl of nine or ten was peering
eagerly out at William, her eyes just above the lower level of
the glass window in the door.</p>

<p>Even a prospect thus curtailed revealed her as a smudged and
dusty little girl; and, evidently, her mother must have been preoccupied
with some important affair that day; but to William she suggested
nothing familiar. As his glance happened to encounter hers, the
peering eyes grew instantly brighter with excitement;&mdash;she exposed
her whole countenance at the window, and impulsively made a face
at him.</p>

<p>William had not the slightest recollection of ever having seen
her before.</p>

<p>He gave her one stern look and went on; though he felt that something
ought to be done. The affair was not a personal one&mdash;patently,
this was a child who played about the station and amused herself
by making faces at everybody who passed the telephone-booth&mdash;still,
the authorities ought not to allow it. People did not come to
the station to be insulted.</p>

<p>Three seconds later the dusty-faced little girl and her moue
were sped utterly from William's mind. For, as the doors swung
together behind him, he saw Miss Pratt. There were no gates nor
iron barriers to obscure the view; there was no train-shed to
darken the air. She was at some distance, perhaps two hundred
feet, along the tracks, where the sleeping-cars of the long train
would stop. But there she stood, mistakable for no other on this
wide earth!</p>

<p>There she stood&mdash;a glowing little figure in the hazy September
sunlight, her hair an amber mist under the adorable little hat;
a small bunch of violets at her waist; a larger bunch of fragrant
but less expensive sweet peas in her right hand; half a dozen
pink roses in her left; her little dog Flopit in the crook of
one arm; and a one-pound box of candy in the crook of the other&mdash;ineffable,
radiant, starry, there she stood!</p>

<p>Near her also stood her young hostess, and Wallace Banks, Johnnie
Watson, and Joe Bullitt&mdash;three young gentlemen in a condition
of solemn tensity. Miss Parcher saw William as he emerged from
the station building, and she waved her parasol in greeting, attracting
the attention of the others to him, so that they: all turned and
stared.</p>

<p>Seventeen sometimes finds it embarrassing (even in a state of
deep emotion) to walk two hundred feet, or thereabout, toward
a group of people who steadfastly watch the long approach. And
when the watching group contains the lady of all the world before
whom one wishes to appear most debonair, and contains not only
her, but several rivals, who, though <em>FAIRLY </em>good-hearted,
might hardly be trusted to neglect such an opportunity to murmur
something jocular about one &mdash;No, it cannot be said that
William appeared to be wholly without self-consciousness.</p>

<p>In fancy he had prophesied for this moment something utterly
different. He had seen himself parting from her, the two alone
as within a cloud. He had seen himself gently placing his box
of candy in her hands, some of his fingers just touching some
of hers and remaining thus lightly in contact to the very last.
He had seen himself bending toward the sweet blonde head to murmur
the few last words of simple eloquence, while her eyes lifted
in mysterious appeal to his&mdash;and he had put no other figures,
not even Miss Parcher's, into this picture.</p>

<p>Parting is the most dramatic moment in young love, and if there
is one time when the lover wishes to present a lofty but graceful
appearance it is at the last. To leave with the loved one, for
recollection, a final picture of manly dignity in sorrow&mdash;that,
above all things, is the lover's desire. And yet, even at the
beginning of William's two-hundred-foot advance (later so much
discussed) he felt the heat surging over his ears, and, as he
took off his hat, thinking to wave it jauntily in reply to Miss
Parcher, he made but an uncertain gesture of it, so that he wished
he had not tried it. Moreover, he had covered less than a third
of the distance, when he became aware that all of the group were
staring at him with unaccountable eagerness, and had begun to
laugh.</p>

<p>William felt certain that his attire was in no way disordered,
nor in itself a cause for laughter;&mdash;all of these people had often
seen him dressed as he was to-day, and had preserved their gravity.
But, in spite of himself, he took off his hat again, and looked
to see if anything about it might explain this mirth, which, at
his action, increased. Nay, the laughter began to be shared by
strangers; and some set down their hand-luggage for greater pleasure
in what they saw.</p>

<p>William's inward state became chaotic.</p>

<p>He tried to smile carelessly, to prove his composure, but he
found that he had lost almost all control over his features. He
had no knowledge of his actual expression except that it hurt
him. In desperation he fell back upon hauteur; he managed to frown,
and walked proudly. At that they laughed the more, Wallace Banks
rudely pointing again and again at William; and not till the oncoming
sufferer reached a spot within twenty feet of these delighted
people did he grasp the significance of Wallace's repeated gesture
of pointing. Even then he understood only when the gesture was
supplemented by half-articulate shouts:</p>

<p>"Behind you! Look <em>BEHIND </em>you!"</p>

<p>The stung youth turned.</p>

<p>There, directly behind him, he beheld an exclusive little procession
consisting of two damsels in single file, the first soiled with
house-moving, the second with apple sauce.</p>

<p>For greater caution they had removed their shoes; and each damsel,
as she paraded, dangled from each far-extended hand a shoe. And
both damsels, whether beneath apple sauce or dust smudge, were
suffused with the rapture of a great mockery.</p>

<p>They were walking with their stummicks out o' joint.</p>

<p>At sight of William's face they squealed. They turned and ran.
They got themselves out of sight.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, the air filled with solid thunder and the pompous
train shook the ground. Ah, woe's the word! This was the thing
that meant to bear away the golden girl and honeysuckle of the
world&mdash;meant to, and would, not abating one iron second!</p>

<p>Now a porter had her hand-bag.</p>

<p>Dear Heaven! to be a porter&mdash;yes, a colored one! What of that,
<em>NOW? </em>Just to be a simple porter, and journey with her
to the far, strange pearl among cities whence she had come!</p>

<p>The gentle porter bowed her toward the steps of his car; but
first she gave Flopit into the hands of May Parcher, for a moment,
and whispered a word to Wallace Banks; then to Joe Bullitt; then
to Johnnie Watson;&mdash;then she ran to William.</p>

<p>She took his hand.</p>

<p>"Don't forget!" she whispered. "Don't forget Lola!"</p>

<p>He stood stock-still. His face was blank, his hand limp. He said
nothing.</p>

<p>She enfolded May Parcher, kissed her devotedly; then, with Flopit
once more under her arm, she ran and jumped upon the steps just
as the train began to move. She stood there, on the lowest step,
slowly gliding away from them, and in her eyes there was a sparkle
of tears, left, it may be, from her laughter at poor William's
pageant with Jane and Rannie Kirsted&mdash;or, it may be, not.</p>

<p>She could not wave to her friends, in answer to their gestures
of farewell, for her arms were too full of Flopit and roses and
candy and sweet peas; but she kept nodding to them in a way that
showed them how much she thanked them for being sorry she was
going&mdash;and made it clear that she was sorry, too, and loved them
all.</p>

<p>"Good-by!" she meant.</p>

<p>Faster she glided; the engine passed from sight round a curve
beyond a culvert, but for a moment longer they could see the little
figure upon the steps&mdash;and, to the very last glimpse they had
of her, the small, golden head was still nodding "Good-by!" Then
those steps whereon she stood passed in their turn beneath the
culvert, and they saw her no more.</p>

<p>Lola Pratt was gone!</p>

<p>Wet-eyed, her young hostess of the long summer turned away, and
stumbled against William. "Why, Willie Baxter!" she cried, blinking
at him.</p>

<p>The last car of the train had rounded the curve and disappeared,
but William was still waving farewell&mdash;not with his handkerchief,
but with a symmetrical, one-pound parcel, wrapped in white tissue-paper,
girdled with blue ribbon.</p>

<p>"Never mind!" said May Parcher. "Let's all walk Up-town together,
and talk about her on the way, and we'll go by the express-office,
and you can send your candy to her by express, Willie."</p>
