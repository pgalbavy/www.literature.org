<p>"Drysdale, what's a servitor?"</p>

<p>"How the deuce should I know?"</p>

<p>This short and pithy dialogue took place in Drysdale's rooms
one evening soon after the conversation recorded in the last chapter.
He and Tom were sitting alone there, for a wonder, and so the
latter seized the occasion to propound this question, which he
had had on his mind for some time. He was scarcely satisfied with
the above rejoinder, but while he was thinking how to come at
the subject by another road, Drysdale opened a morocco fly-book,
and poured its contents on the table, which was already covered
with flies of all sorts and patterns, hanks of gut, delicate made-up
casts, reels, minnows, and tackle enough to kill all the fish
in the four neighboring counties. Tom began turning them over
and scrutinizing the dressings of the flies.</p>

<p>"It has been so mild, the fish must be in season don't you think?
Besides, if they're not, it's a jolly drive to Fairford at any
rate. You've never been behind my team Brown. You'd better come,
now, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I can't cut my two lectures."</p>

<p>"Bother your lectures! Put on an aeger, then."</p>

<p>"No! that doesn't suit my book, you know."</p>

<p>"I can't see why you should be so cursedly particular. Well,
if you won't, you won't; I know that well enough. But what cast
shall you fish with to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"How many flies do you use?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes two, sometimes three."</p>

<p>"Two's enough, I think; all depends on the weather; but, if it's
at all like today, you can't do better, I should think, than the
old March brown and a palmer to begin with. Then, for change,
this hare's ear, and an alder fly, perhaps; or,&mdash;let me see,"
and he began searching the glittering heap to select a color to
go with the dull hare's ear.</p>

<p>"Isn't it early for the alder?" said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Rather, perhaps; but they can't resist it."</p>

<p>"These bang-tailed little sinners any good?" said Drysdale, throwing
some cock-a-bondies across the table.</p>

<p>"Yes; I never like to be without them, and a governor or two.
Here, this is a well-tied lot," said Tom, picking out half a-dozen.
"You never know when you may not kill with either of them. But
I don't know the Fairford water; so my opinion isn't worth much."</p>

<p>Tom soon returned to the old topic.</p>

<p>"But now, Drysdale, you must know what a servitor is."</p>

<p>"Why should I? Do you mean one of our college servitors?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, something in the upper-servant line. I should put him above
the porter, and below the cook, and butler. He does the don's
dirty work, and gets their broken victuals, and I believe he pays
no college fees."</p>

<p>Tom rather drew into himself at this insolent and offhand definition.
He was astonished and hurt at the tone of his friend. However,
presently, he resolved to go through with it, and began again.</p>

<p>"But servitors are gentlemen, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"A good deal of the cock-tail about them, I should think. But
I have not the honor of any acquaintance amongst them."</p>

<p>"At any rate, they are undergraduates, are not they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And may take degrees, just like you or me?"</p>

<p>"They may have all the degrees to themselves, for anything I
care. I wish they would let one pay a servitor for passing little-go
for one. It would be deuced comfortable. I wonder it don't strike
the dons, now; they might get clever beggars for servitors, and
farm them, and so make loads of tin."</p>

<p>"But, Drysdale, seriously, why should you talk like that? If
they can take all the degrees we can, and are, in fact, just what
we are, undergraduates, I can't see why they're not as likely
to be gentlemen as we. It can surely make no difference, their
being poor men?"</p>

<p>"It must make them devilish uncomfortable," said the incorrigible
payer of double fees, getting up to light his cigar.</p>

<p>"The name ought to carry respect here, at any rate. The Black
Prince was an Oxford man, and he thought the noblest motto he
could take was, 'Ich dien,' I serve."</p>

<p>"If he were here now, he would change it for 'Je paye.'"</p>

<p>"I often wish you would tell me what you really and truly think,
Drysdale."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow I am telling you what I do really think. Whatever
the Black Prince might be pleased to observe if he were here,
I stick to my motto. I tell you the thing to be able to do here
at Oxford is&mdash;to pay."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it."</p>

<p>"I knew you wouldn't."</p>

<p>"I don't believe you do either."</p>

<p>"I do, though. But what makes you so curious about servitors?"</p>

<p>"Why, I made friends with Hardy, one of our servitors. He is
such a fine fellow!"</p>

<p>I am sorry to relate that it cost Tom an effort to say this to
Drysdale, but he despised himself that it was so.</p>

<p>"You should have told me so, before you began to pump me," said
Drysdale. "However, I partly suspected something of the sort.
You've a good bit of a Quixote in you. But really, Brown," he
added, seeing Tom redden and look angry, "I'm sorry if what I
said pained you. I daresay this friend of yours is a gentleman,
and all you say."</p>

<p>"He is more of a gentleman by a long way than most of the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gentlemen commoners, you were going to say. Don't crane at such
a small fence on my account. I will put it in another way for
you. He can't be a greater snob than many of them."</p>

<p>"Well, but why do you live with them so much, then?"</p>

<p>"Why? because they happen to do the things I like doing, and
live up here as I like to live. I like hunting and driving, and
drawing badgers, and playing cards, and good wine and cigars.
They hunt and drive, and keep dogs and good cellars, and will
play unlimited loo or Van John as long as I please."</p>

<p>"But I know you get very sick of all that often, for I've heard
you say as much half-a-dozen times in the little time I've been
here."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't want to deny me the Briton's privilege of grumbling,
do you?" said Drysdale, as he flung his legs up on the sofa, crossing
one over the other as he lounged on his back&mdash;his favorite attitude;
"but suppose I am getting tired of it all&mdash;which I am not&mdash;what
do you purpose as a substitute?"</p>

<p>"Take to boating. I know you could be in the first boat if you
liked; I heard them say so at Smith's wine the other night."</p>

<p>"But what's to prevent my getting just as tired of that? Besides,
it's such a grind. And then there's the bore of changing all one's
habits."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's such splendid hard work," said Tom, who was bent
on making a convert of his friend.</p>

<p>"Just so; and that's just what I don't want; the 'books and work
and healthful play' line don't suit my complaint. No, as my uncle
says, 'a young fellow must sow his wild oats,' and Oxford seems
a place especially set apart by Providence for that operation."</p>

<p>In all the wild range of accepted British maxims there is none,
take it for all in all, more thoroughly abominable than this one,
as to the sowing of wild oats. Look at it on what side you will,
and you can make nothing but a devil's maxim of it. What a man&mdash;be
he young, old, or middle-aged&mdash;sows, <em>that</em>, and nothing
else shall he reap. The one only thing to do with wild oats, is
to put them carefully into the hottest part of the fire, and get
them burnt to dust, every seed of them. If you sow them no matter
in what ground, up they will come, with long tough roots like
couch grass, and luxuriant stalks and leaves, as sure as there
is a sun in heaven&mdash;a crop which it turns one's heart cold to
think of. The devil, too, whose special crop they are, will see
that they thrive, and you, and nobody else, will have to reap
them; and no common reaping will get them out of the soil, which
must be dug down deep again and again. Well for you if with all
your care you can make the ground sweet again by your dying day.
"Boys will be boys" is not much better, but that has a true side
to it; but this encouragement to the sowing of wild oats, is simply
devilish, for it means that a young man is to give way to the
temptations and follow the lusts of his age. What are we to do
with the wild oats of manhood and old age&mdash;with ambition, over-reaching
the false weights, hardness, suspicion, avarice&mdash;if the wild oats
of youth are to be sown, and not burnt? What possible distinction
can be drawn between them? If we may sow the one, why not the
other?</p>

<p>But to get back to our story. Tom went away from Drysdale's rooms
that night (after they had sorted all the tackle, which was to
accompany the fishing expedition, to their satisfaction) in a
disturbed state of mind. He was very much annoyed at Drysdale's
way of talking, because he was getting to like the man. He was
surprised and angry at being driven more and more to the conclusion
that the worship of the golden calf was verily and indeed rampant
in Oxford&mdash;side by side, no doubt, with much that was manly and
noble, but tainting more or less the whole life of the place.
In fact, what annoyed him most was, the consciousness that he
himself was becoming an idolater. For he couldn't help admitting
that he felt much more comfortable when standing in the quadrangles
or strolling in the High Street with Drysdale in his velvet cap,
and silk gown, and faultless get-up, than when doing the same
things with Hardy in his faded old gown, shabby loose overcoat,
and well-worn trousers. He wouldn't have had Hardy suspect the
fact for all he was worth, and hoped to get over the feeling soon;
but there it was unmistakably. He wondered whether Hardy had ever
felt anything of the kind himself.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, these thoughts did not hinder him from sleeping
soundly, or from getting up an hour earlier than usual to go and
see Drysdale start on his expedition.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he was in Drysdale's rooms next morning betimes,
and assisted at the early breakfast which was going on there.
Blake was the only other man present. He was going with Drysdale,
and entrusted Tom with a message to Miller and the Captain, that
he could not pull in the boat that day, but would pay a waterman
to take his place. As soon as the gate opened, the three, accompanied
by the faithful Jack, and followed by Drysdale's scout, bearing
overcoats, a splendid water-proof apron lined with fur, and the
rods and reels, sallied out of the college, and sought the livery
stables, patronized by the men of St. Ambrose's. Here they found
a dog cart all ready in the yard, with a strong Roman-nosed, vicious-looking,
rat-tailed horse in the shafts, called Satan by Drysdale; the
leader had been sent on to the first turnpike. The things were
packed, and Jack, the bull-dog, hoisted into the interior in a
few minutes; Drysdale produced a long straight horn, which he
called his yard of tin (probably because it was made of brass),
and after refreshing himself with a blast or two, handed it over
to Blake, and then mounted the dog cart, and took the reins. Blake
seated himself by his side; the help who was to accompany them
got up behind, and Jack looked wisely out from his inside place
over the back-board.</p>

<p>"Are we all right?" said Drysdale, catching his long tandem whip
into a knowing double thong.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said the head ostler, touching his cap.</p>

<p>"You'd better have come, my boy," said Drysdale to Tom, as they
trotted off out of the yard; and Tom couldn't help envying them
as he followed, and watched the dog cart lessening rapidly down
the empty street, and heard the notes of the yard of tin, which
Blake managed to make really musical, borne back on the soft western
breeze. It was such a pleasant morning for fishing.</p>

<p>However, it was too late to repent, had he wished it; and so
he got back to chapel, and destroyed the whole effect of the morning
service on Miller's mind, by delivering Blake's message to that
choleric coxswain as soon as chapel was over. Miller vowed for
the twentieth time that Blake should be turned out of the boat,
and went off to the Captain's rooms to torment him, and consult
what was to be done.</p>

<p>The weather continued magnificent&mdash;a soft, dull grey March day,
and a steady wind; and the thought of the lucky fishermen, and
visions of creels filled with huge three-pounders, haunted Tom
at lecture, and throughout the day.</p>

<p>At two o'clock he was down at the river. The college eight was
to go down for the first time in the season to the reached below
Nuneham, for a good training pull, and he had notice, to his great
joy, that he was to be tried in the boat. But, great, no doubt,
as was the glory, the price was a heavy one. This was the first
time he had been subjected to the tender mercies of Miller, the
coxswain, or had pulled behind the Captain; and it did not take
long to convince him that it was a very different style of thing
from anything he had as yet been accustomed to in the freshman's
crew. The long steady sweep of the so-called paddle tried him
almost as much as the breathless strain of the spurt.</p>

<p>Miller, too, was in one of his most relentless moods. He was
angry at Blake's desertion, and seemed to think that Tom had something
to do with it, though he simply delivered the message which had
been entrusted to him; and so, though he distributed rebuke and
objurgation to every man in the boat except the Captain, he seemed
to our hero to take particular delight in working him. There he
stood in the stern, the fiery little coxswain, leaning forward
with a tiller-rope in each hand, and bending to every stroke,
shouting his warnings, and rebukes, and monitions to Tom, till
he drove him to his wits' end. By the time the boat came back
to Hall's, his arms were so numb that he could hardly tell whether
his oar was in or out of his hand; his legs were stiff and aching,
and every muscle in his body felt as if it had been pulled out
an inch or two. As he walked up to College, he felt as if his
shoulders and legs had nothing to do with one another; in short,
he had had a very hard day's work, and, after going fast asleep
at a wine-party, and trying in vain to rouse himself by a stroll
in the streets, fairly gave in about ten o'clock and went to bed
without remembering to sport his oak.</p>

<p>For some hours he slept the sleep of the dead, but at last began
to be conscious of voices, and the clicking of glasses, and laughter,
and scraps of songs; and after turning himself once or twice in
bed, to ascertain whether he was awake or no, rubbed his eyes,
sat up, and became aware that something very entertaining to the
parties concerned was going on in his sitting-room. After listening
for a minute, he jumped up, threw on his shooting-coat, and appeared
at the door of his own sitting-room, where he paused a moment
to contemplate the scene which met his astonished vision. His
fire recently replenished, was burning brightly in the grate,
and his candles on the table on which stood his whisky bottle,
and tumblers, and hot water. On his sofa, which had been wheeled
round before the fire, reclined Drysdale, on his back, in his
pet attitude, one leg crossed over the other, with a paper in
his hand, from which he was singing, and in the arm-chair sat
Blake, while Jack was coiled on the rug, turning himself every
now and then in a sort of uneasy protest against his master's
untimely hilarity. At first, Tom felt inclined to be angry, but
the jolly shout of laughter with which Drysdale received him,
as he stepped out into the light in night-shirt, shooting-coat,
and dishevelled hair, appeased him at once.</p>

<p>"Why, Brown, you don't mean to say you have been in bed this
last half-hour? We looked into the bed-room, and thought it was
empty. Sit down, old fellow, and make yourself at home. Have a
glass of grog; it's first-rate whisky."</p>

<p>"Well you're a couple of cool hands, I must say," said Tom. "How
did you get in?"</p>

<p>"Through the door, like honest men," said Drysdale. "You're the
only good fellow in college to-night. When we got back our fires
were out, and we've been all round the college, and found all
the oaks sported but yours. Never sport your oak, old boy; it's
a bad habit. You don't know what time in the morning you may entertain
angels unawares."</p>

<p>"You're a rum pair of angels, anyhow," said Tom, taking his seat
on the sofa. "But what o'clock is it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, about half-past one," said Drysdale. "We've had a series
of catastrophes. Never got into college till near one. I thought
we should never have waked that besotted little porter. However,
here we are at last, you see, all right."</p>

<p>"So it seems," said Tom; "but how about the fishing?"</p>

<p>"Fishing! We've never thrown a fly all day," said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"He is so cursedly conceited about his knowledge of the country,"
struck in Blake. "What with that, and his awful twist, and his
incurable habit of gossiping, and his blackguard dog, and his
team of a devil and a young female&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold your scandalous tongue," shouted Drysdale. "To hear <em>you</em>
talking of my twist, indeed; you ate four chops and a whole chicken
to-day, at dinner, to your own cheek, you know."</p>

<p>"That's quite another thing," said Blake. "I like to see a fellow
an honest grubber at breakfast and dinner; but you've always got
your nose in the manger. That's how we all got wrong to-day, Brown.
You saw what a breakfast he ate before starting; well, nothing
would satisfy him but another at Whitney. There we fell in with
a bird in mahogany tops, and, as usual, Drysdale began chumming
with him. He knew all about the fishing of the next three counties.
I daresay he did. My private belief is, that he is one of the
Hungerford town council, who let the fishing there; at any rate,
he swore it was no use our going to Fairford; the only place where
fish would be in season was Hungerford. Of course Drysdale swallowed
it all, and nothing would serve him but that we should turn off
for Hungerford at once. Now, I did go once to Hungerford races,
and I ventured to suggest that we should never get near the place.
Not a bit of use; he knew every foot of the country. It was then
about nine; he would guarantee that we should be there by twelve,
at latest."</p>

<p>"So we should have been, but for accidents," struck in Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate, what we did was to drive into Farringdon,
instead of Hungerford, both horses dead done up, at twelve o'clock,
after missing our way about twenty times."</p>

<p>"Because you would put in your oar," said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Then grub again," went on Blake, "and an hour to bait the horses.
I knew we were as likely to get to Jericho as to Hungerford. However,
he would start; but, luckily, about two miles from Farringdon,
old Satan bowled quietly into a bank, broke a shaft, and deposited
us then and there. He wasn't such a fool as to be going to Hungerford
at that time of day; the first time in his wicked old life that
I ever remember seeing him do anything that pleased me."</p>

<p>"Come, now," said Drysdale, "do you mean to say you ever sat
behind a better wheeler, when he's in a decent temper?"</p>

<p>"Can't say," said Blake; "never sat behind him in a good temper,
that I can remember."</p>

<p>"I'll trot him five miles out and home in a dog-cart, on any
road out of Oxford, against any horse you can bring, for a fiver."</p>

<p>"Done!" said Blake.</p>

<p>"But were you upset?" said Tom. "How did you get into the bank?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see," said Drysdale, "Jessy,&mdash;that's the little blood-mare,
my leader,&mdash;is very young, and as shy and skittish as the rest
of her sex. We turned a corner sharp, and came right upon a gipsy
encampment. Up she went into the air in a moment, and then turned
right around and came head on at the cart. I gave her the double
thong across her face to send her back again, and Satan, seizing
the opportunity, rushed against the bank, dragging her with him,
and snapping the shaft."</p>

<p>"And so ended our day's fishing," said Blake. "And next moment
out jumps that brute Jack, and pitches into the gipsy's dog, who
had come up very naturally to have a look at what was going on.
Down jumps Drysdale to see that his beast gets fair play, leaving
me and the help to look after the wreck, and keep his precious
wheeler from kicking the cart into little pieces."</p>

<p>"Come, now," said Drysdale, "you must own we fell on our legs
after all. Hadn't we a jolly afternoon? I'm thinking of turning
tramp, Brown. We spent three or four hours in that camp, and Blake
got spooney on a gipsy girl, and has written I don't know how
many songs on them. Didn't you hear us singing them just now?"</p>

<p>"But how did you get the cart mended?" said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, the tinker patched up the shaft for us,&mdash;a cunning old beggar,
the <em>pere de famille</em> of the encampment; up to every move
on the board. He wanted to have a deal with me for Jessy. But
'pon my honor, we had a good time of it. There was the old tinker,
mending the shaft, in his fur cap, with a black pipe, one inch
long, sticking out of his mouth; and the old brown parchment of
a mother, with her head in a red handkerchief, smoking a ditto
pipe to the tinker's, who told our fortunes, and talked like a
printed book. Then there was his wife, and the slip of a girl
who bowled over Blake there, and half a dozen ragged brats; and
a fellow on a tramp, not a gipsy&mdash;some runaway apprentice, I take
it, but a jolly dog&mdash;with no luggage but an old fiddle on which
he scraped away uncommonly well, and set Blake making rhymes as
we sat in the tent. You never heard any of his songs. Here's one
for each of us; we're going to get up the characters and sing
them about the country;&mdash;now for a rehearsal; I'll be the tinker."</p>

<p>"No, you must take the servant girl," said Blake.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll toss up for characters when the time comes. You
begin then; here's a song," and he handed one of the papers to
Blake, who began singing&mdash;</p>

"Tink tink, a tink a tink,<br/>
&nbsp;We'll work and then get tipsy, oh!<br/>
Clink tink, on each chink,<br/>
&nbsp;Our busy hammers ring.<br/>
Tink tink, a tink a tink,<br/>
&nbsp;How merry lives a gypsy, oh!<br/>
Chanting and ranting;<br/>
&nbsp;As happy as a king."

<p>   "William shall    Be rich and great;    And shall prove   
A constant mate.    Thank not me,    But thank your fate,    On
whose high    Decrees I wait."</p>

<p>"Well, won't that do? won't it bring the house down? I'm going
to send for dresses to London, and we'll start next week."</p>

<p>"What, on the tramp, singing these songs?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we'll begin in some out-of-the-way place till we get used
to it."</p>

<p>"And end in the lock-up, I should say," said Tom; "it'll be a
good lark, though. Now, you haven't told me how you got home."</p>

<p>"Oh, we left camp at about five&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The tinker having extracted a sovereign from Drysdale," interrupted
Blake.</p>

<p>"What did you give to the little gypsy yourself?" retorted Drysdale;
"I saw your adieus under the thorn-bush. &mdash;Well, we got on
all right to old Murdock's, at Kingston Inn, by about seven, and
there we had dinner; and after dinner the old boy came in. He
and I are great chums, for I'm often there, and always ask him
in. But that beggar Blake, who never saw him before, cut me clean
out in five minutes. Fancy his swearing he is Scotch, and that
an ancestor of his in the sixteenth century married a Murdock!"</p>

<p>"Well, when you come to think what a lot of ancestors one must
have had at that time, it's probably true," said Blake.</p>

<p>"At any rate, it took," went on Drysdale. "I thought old Murdock
would have wept on his neck. As it was, he scattered snuff enough
to fill a pint pot over him out of his mull, and began talking
Gaelic. And Blake had the cheek to jabber a lot of gibberish back
to him, as if he understood every word."</p>

<p>"Gibberish! it was the purest Gaelic," said Blake laughing.</p>

<p>"I heard a lot of Greek words myself," said Drysdale; "but old
Murdock was too pleased at hearing his own clapper going, and
too full of whisky, to find him out."</p>

<p>"Let alone that I doubt whether he remembers more than about
five words of his native tongue himself," said Blake.</p>

<p>"The old boy got so excited that he went up stairs for his plaid
and dirk, and dressed himself up in them, apologising that he
could not appear in the full grab of old Gaul, in honor of his
new-found relative, as his daughter had cut up his old kilt for
'trews for the barnies' during his absence from home. Then they
took to more toddy and singing Scotch songs, till at eleven o'clock
they were standing on their chairs, right hands clasped, each
with one foot on the table, glasses in the other hands, the toddy
flying over the room as they swayed about roaring like maniacs,
what was it?&mdash;oh, I have it:</p>

<p>   'Wug-an-toorey all agree,    Wug-an-toorey, wug-an-toorey.'"</p>

<p>"He hasn't told you that he tried to join us, and tumbled over
the back of his chair into the dirty-plate basket."</p>

<p>"A libel! a libel!" shouted Drysdale; "the leg of my chair broke,
and I stepped down gracefully and safely, and when I looked up
and saw what a tottery performance it was, I concluded to give
them a wide berth. It would be no joke to have old Murdock topple
over on to you. I left them 'wug-an-tooreying,' and went out to
look after the trap, which was ordered to be at the door at half-past
ten. I found Murdock's ostler very drunk, but sober compared with
that rascally help whom we had been fools enough to take with
us. They had got the trap out and the horses in, but that old
rascal Satan was standing so quiet that I suspected something
wrong. Sure enough, when I came to look, they had him up to the
cheek on one side of his mouth, and third bar on the other, his
belly-band buckled across his back, and no kicking strap. The
old brute was chuckling to himself what he would do with us as
soon as we had started in that trim. It took half an hour getting
all right, as I was the only one able to do anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would have said so," said Blake, "if you had seen him
trying to put Jack up behind. He made six shots with the old dog,
and dropped him about on his head and the broad of his back as
if he had been a bundle of ells."</p>

<p>"The fact is, that that rascally ostler had made poor old Jack
drunk too," explained Drysdale, "and he wouldn't be lifted straight.
However we got off at last, and hadn't gone a mile before the
help (who was maundering away some cursed sentimental ditty or
other behind), lurched more heavily than usual, and pitched off
into the night somewhere. Blake looked for him for half-an-hour,
and couldn't find a hair."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say the man tumbled off and you never found
him?" said Tom in horror.</p>

<p>"Well, that's about the fact," said Drysdale; "but it isn't so
bad as you think. We had no lamps, and it was an uncommon bad
night for running by holloas."</p>

<p>"But a first-rate night for running by scent," broke in Blake;
"the fellow leant against me until he made his exit, and I'd have
backed myself to have hit the scent again half-a-mile off if the
wind had only been right."</p>

<p>"He may have broken his neck," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Can a fellow sing with a broken neck?" said Drysdale; "hanged
if I know! But don't I tell you, we heard him maundering on somewhere
or other? And when Blake shouted, he rebuked him piously out of
the pitch darkness, and told him to go home and repent. I nearly
dropped off the box laughing at them; and then he 'uplifted his
testimony,' as he called it, against me, for driving a horse called
Satan. I believe he's a ranting methodist spouter."</p>

<p>"I tried hard to find him," said Blake; "For I should dearly
have liked to kick him safely into the ditch."</p>

<p>"At last Black Will himself couldn't have held Satan another
minute. So Blake scrambled up, and away we came, and knocked into
college at one for a finish: the rest you know."</p>

<p>"Well, you've had a pretty good day of it," said Tom, who had
been hugely amused; "but I should feel nervous about the help,
if I were you."</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll come to no grief, I'll be bound," said Drysdale, "but
what o'clock is it?"</p>

<p>"Three," said Blake, looking at his watch and getting up; "time
to turn in."</p>

<p>"The first time I ever heard you say that," said Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Yes; but you forget we were up this morning before the world
was aired. Good night, Brown."</p>

<p>And off the two went, leaving Tom to sport his oak this time,
and retire in wonder to bed.</p>

<p>Drysdale was asleep, with Jack curled up on the foot of the bed,
in ten minutes. Blake, by the help of wet towels and a knotted
piece of whipcord round his forehead, read Pinder till the chapel
bell began to ring.</p>
