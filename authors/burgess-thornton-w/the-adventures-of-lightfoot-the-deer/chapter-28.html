<p>The very worst things come to an end at last. No matter how bad
a thing is, it cannot last forever. So it was with the hunting
season for Lightfoot the Deer. There came a day when the law protected
all Deer,&mdash;a day when the hunters could no longer go searching
for Lightfoot.</p>

<p>Usually there was great rejoicing among the little people of
the Green Forest and the Green Meadows when the hunting season
ended and they knew that Lightfoot would be in no more danger
until the next hunting season. But this year there was no rejoicing.
You see, no one could find Lightfoot. The last seen of him was
when he was running for his life with two hounds baying on his
trail and the Green Forest filled with hunters watching for a
chance to shoot him.</p>

<p>Sammy Jay had hunted everywhere through the Green Forest. Blacky
the Crow, whose eyes are quite as sharp as those of Sammy Jay,
had joined in the search. They had found no trace of Lightfoot.
Paddy the Beaver said that for three days Lightfoot had not visited
his pond for a drink. Billy Mink, who travels up and down the
Laughing Brook, had looked for Lightfoot's footprints in the soft
earth along the banks and had found only old ones. Jumper the
Hare had visited Lightfoot's favorite eating places at night,
but Lightfoot had not been in any of them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "I tell you what it is," said Sammy Jay to Bobby
Coon, "something has happened to Lightfoot."]</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," said Sammy Jay to Bobby Coon, "something
has happened to Lightfoot. Either those hounds caught him and
killed him, or he was shot by one of those hunters. The Green
Forest will never be the same without him. I don't think I shall
want to come over here very much. There isn't one of all the other
people who live in the Green Forest who would be missed as Lightfoot
will be."</p>

<p>Bobby Coon nodded. "That's true, Sammy," said he. "Without Lightfoot,
the Green Forest will never be the same. He never harmed anybody.
Why those hunters should have been so anxious to kill one so beautiful
is something I can't understand. For that matter, I don't understand
why they want to kill any of us. If they really needed us for
food, it would be a different matter, but they don't. Have you
been up in the Old Pasture and asked Old Man Coyote if he has
seen anything of Lightfoot?"</p>

<p>Sammy nodded. "I've been up there twice," said he. "Old Man Coyote
has been lying very low during the days, but nights he has done
a lot of traveling. You know Old Man Coyote has a mighty good
nose, but not once since the day those hounds chased Lightfoot
has he found so much as a tiny whiff of Lightfoot's scent. I thought
he might have found the place where Lightfoot was killed, but
he hasn't, although he has looked for it. Well, the hunting season
for Lightfoot is over, but I am afraid it has ended too late."</p>
