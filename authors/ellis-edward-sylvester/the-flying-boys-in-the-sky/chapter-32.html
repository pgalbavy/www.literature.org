<p>If the wrathful Uncle Tommy Waters could have looked in upon
his home at the time Harvey Hamilton was telling his story, he
would have seen there was no ground for misgiving so far as the
partner of his joys was concerned.</p>

<p>A muscular woman, with a big iron poker in hand, a massive dog
nosing about the house and ready at instant call, surely had little
to fear from a man whose wrists were encircled by steel bracelets
and who was swathed like a mummy in a network of rope, no matter
how sinister his mood might be. She, too, had heard from her husband
the story of the kidnapping of little Grace Hastings, and having
a child of her own of about the same age, she gave it as her honest
opinion that every one of the criminals should be burned at the
stake, thrown head first into a well, tumbled over the highest
precipice in the world, and then left to perish with cold in the
region discovered by Commander Peary and not discovered by Dr.
Cook.</p>

<p>When she found herself alone with the horrible villain, she told
Peggy to go outside and play with the dog, while she had a little
talk with the prisoner.</p>

<p>She seated herself a couple of paces in front of him, and looking
piercingly into his glittering black eyes, demanded in a low,
ominous voice:</p>

<p>"Now, what do you think of yourself? Don’t speak a word or I’ll
bang you with this poker," and she raised the stiff rod threateningly.</p>

<p>Understanding what was said to him, the prisoner prudently held
his peace.</p>

<p>"I asked you what you thought of yourself. What oughter be done
with a scamp that steals a little child from its father and mother?
Hanging is too good for him. Ain’t you ashamed? Look out! Don’t
you dare open your mouth!"</p>

<p>And again the primitive weapon was brandished close to the captive’s
crown, whose shaggy wealth of hair could not have shielded it
had the poker descended.</p>

<p>"You ask me what I think," finally blurted Pierotti in desperation;
"you say you strike if I open mouth; I think you are mighty big
fool,—that’s what I think—now you know."</p>

<p>As the Italian sat he faced the open door, toward which the back
of the woman was turned. While striving to grasp the meaning of
the broken sentences, she saw from the expression of the impish
countenance that he was looking at some one behind her. She whirled
about, and almost fell from her chair, for standing in the doorway
was a second member of the Black Hand, in the person of Amasi
Catozzi, who had been slightly wounded by the revolver of Detective
Pendar.</p>

<p>This criminal, quick to read the meaning of the departure of
the officer with the young aviator, in an outburst of uncontrollable
passion fired at him, and then made all haste to the headquarters
in the woods, whither his companion had preceded him. He was still
running when the explosion told its horrifying story. He knew
what had taken place as well as if he had been an eyewitness,
with the exception of the personal results to his two associates.
With a raging chagrin which no one can comprehend, he saw that
the princely ransom which he had felt in the itching palm of his
hand had slipped away forever. All that remained to him was to
save his own neck, as well as that of the survivors, if so be
there were any, provided he could bring about such a consummation
without adding to his own peril.</p>

<p>Skilfully keeping out of sight in the wood, he saw Alessandro
Pierotti handcuffed and driven to the cabin as a prisoner. Catozzi
would have felt a gleeful delight in shooting the man with whom
he had already exchanged shots, but to do that would have intensified
his own danger, since it would have added ardor to the efforts
to run him to earth. The certain result of such disaster would
be a verdict of murder, when kidnapping at most involved only
a sentence to a long term of imprisonment, with the cheering prospect
of a speedy pardon in the background, or a release upon parole,
and the opportunity to resume his atrocious misdeeds. Consequently,
Catozzi did not interfere during the first part of the proceedings.</p>

<p>As stealthily as a red Indian he peered out from the depth of
the forest. Waiting until the detective and child accompanied
the young aviator in his flight to Chesterton and were gone long
enough for him to feel no fear of their return, he went forward
and presented himself in the door while the pointed and somewhat
one-sided conversation was going on between Mrs. Waters and the
bound prisoner in the chair.</p>

<p>It would have pleased the new arrival to give the woman her final
quietus, but he was restrained by the same knowledge that stayed
his hand when he might have shot Simmons Pendar. She was so terrified
that she could only stare in a daze at Catozzi, with a limp grasp
upon the simple weapon in her hand. She would have begged for
mercy had she not quickly seen that it was not necessary. The
Italian merely glanced at her, and striding forward to the chair,
speedily cut the thongs and the prisoner rose to his feet. The
loosening of the handcuffs would require more time and could wait.
The two talked briefly in their own language. Pierotti indulged
in the luxury of a hideous grimace at the woman as he was following
his companion out of the door and across the clearing to the forest,
into which they plunged and were immediately lost to sight.</p>

<p>This explanation will make clear the disappointment of the mob
which swarmed out of the wood soon afterward, with the panting
Uncle Tommy still at the head, and the worried detective beside
him. He had turned over the care of Grace Hastings to Harvey Hamilton,
who remained behind at Chesterton. In his flurry and eagerness
Uncle Tommy caught the toe of his boot at the threshold and sprawled
on his hands and knees into the "parlor" of his residence.</p>

<p>"Is my lamb safe?" he asked, scrambling to his feet and gazing
at the pudgy figure still seated and maintaining a somewhat stronger
grip upon the poker.</p>

<p>"You old simpleton! Why don’t you clean your boots?" was the
loving response of his life partner, who quickly regained her
natural disposition when she saw that all danger had gone by.</p>

<p>Her story was quickly told. The disappointment to all, except
the detective, was keen, and his feelings were solely due to his
respect for law and order. Uncle Tommy was asked whether his dog
could not take the scent of the two fugitives and run them down,
but the weather prophet replied that the canine wasn’t worth a
shoestring for such work.</p>

<p>"You never will be able to find the couple in the woods," said
Pendar; "there are too many hiding places; they can dodge you
for weeks; the only course is for us to return to Chesterton at
once, and for me to telegraph to all the surrounding towns, asking
the authorities to be on the lookout for them. They will have
to leave the woods sooner or later and there is a fair chance
of catching both."</p>

<p>He added in a lower voice:</p>

<p>"What is left of one of them lies a little way from here; the
body must not be neglected."</p>

<p>The announcement caused a striking change in the moods of all.
Three of the men walked forth with the detective and viewed all
that remained of the Black Hander. One of them carried a blanket
which was tenderly laid over the body.</p>

<p>"It is best not to remove it until the coroner has given permission,"
explained the officer; "since there has been a death he must make
an investigation."</p>

<p>The party straggled back to town, Uncle Tommy being the only
one who stayed behind. Detective Pendar having decided upon his
course acted promptly. When he entered the telegraph office he
found a long message from Mr. Hastings awaiting him. It was so
fervent in its expressions of gratitude that the eyes of the detective
filled and he could not command his voice for some minutes. The
telegram contained a loving message to the child, and the assurance
that the father would start for Chesterton at once to bring her
home.</p>

<p>Pendar sent notices to all the nearby towns and to the large
cities, doing his work so thoroughly that he said to himself as
he lighted a cigar and leaned back in his chair:</p>

<p>"If those two fellows can break through the net that I have spread
round them, they will almost deserve to get away. They may keep
in hiding for several days, but sooner or later they will be gathered
in."</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton proposed to carry Grace in his aeroplane to Philadelphia,
confident that by starting early the next morning he could reach
her home by noon, but his friend showed him the folly of anything
of that nature. She was unaccustomed to riding in the air, and
an accident was more than likely. Moreover, her father was due
in Chesterton on the afternoon of the morrow.</p>

<p>"The child has already passed through too much to incur any more
danger from which it is possible to save her. And that reminds
me, Harvey," added the detective with a smile, "you have decided
by this time who it was that chopped up your aeroplane."</p>

<p>"It must have been Catozzi and Caprioni."</p>

<p>"Beyond a doubt."</p>

<p>"Why did they do it?"</p>

<p>"They may have seen a possible danger in the presence of a machine
like that in the neighborhood of Chesterton and decided to put
it out of commission."</p>

<p>"Why didn’t they do the same with my second?"</p>

<p>"It would have involved a great deal more risk, and could have
accomplished little or nothing for them. Besides, we mustn’t forget
the element of unadulterated cussedness that actuates so many
members of mankind. Professor Morgan took a fancy to inspect your
machine at close range without the chance of meeting you, and
so he made a visit early in the morning, only to find it smashed
to everlasting smithereens. He left, your colored boy being just
in time to gain a glimpse of him, and straightway telegraphed
your father, and you know what followed."</p>

<p>This part of my story may be summed up in a few sentences. On
the morrow the coroner entered into an official investigation,
as in duty bound, of the death of the Italian supposed to be Giuseppe
Caprioni, blown up by the explosion of a bomb. The testimony of
Professor Milo Morgan was much needed, but he had departed no
one knew whither, and that of Simmons Pendar supplied its place.
The verdict was in accordance with the facts, so far as they could
be ascertained, and the body was buried in Potter’s Field.</p>

<p>The next day the gratifying intelligence came that both Catozzi
and Pierotti had been captured in Groveton, only twelve miles
from Chesterton. Driven out by hunger they had applied at a house
for food, and were quickly arrested. They were tried, found guilty
and sentenced to the longest terms possible in State Prison, where
it is to be hoped they will spend the remainder of their days.</p>

<p>Horace Hastings reached Chesterton by special train earlier than
was expected and took his child home with him. </p>
