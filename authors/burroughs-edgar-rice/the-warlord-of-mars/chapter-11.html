I did not languish long within the prison of Salensus Oll.
During the short time that I lay there, fettered with chains of gold,
I often wondered as to the fate of Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth.
<P>
My brave companion had followed me into the garden as I attacked Thurid,
and when Salensus Oll had left with Dejah Thoris and the others,
leaving Thuvia of Ptarth behind, he, too, had remained in the garden
with his daughter, apparently unnoticed, for he was appareled
similarly to the guards.
<P>
The last I had seen of him he stood waiting for the warriors
who escorted me to close the gate behind them, that he might be
alone with Thuvia.  Could it be possible that they had escaped?
I doubted it, and yet with all my heart I hoped that it might be true.
<P>
The third day of my incarceration brought a dozen warriors to
escort me to the audience chamber, where Salensus Oll himself was
to try me.  A great number of nobles crowded the room, and among
them I saw Thurid, but Matai Shang was not there.
<P>
Dejah Thoris, as radiantly beautiful as ever, sat upon a small
throne beside Salensus Oll.  The expression of sad hopelessness
upon her dear face cut deep into my heart.
<P>
Her position beside the Jeddak of Jeddaks boded ill for her and me,
and on the instant that I saw her there, there sprang to my mind
the firm intention never to leave that chamber alive if I must
leave her in the clutches of this powerful tyrant.
<P>
I had killed better men than Salensus Oll, and killed them
with my bare hands, and now I swore to myself that I should kill
him if I found that the only way to save the Princess of Helium.
That it would mean almost instant death for me I cared not, except
that it would remove me from further efforts in behalf of Dejah
Thoris, and for this reason alone I would have chosen another way,
for even though I should kill Salensus Oll that act would not
restore my beloved wife to her own people.  I determined to
wait the final outcome of the trial, that I might learn all that I
could of the Okarian ruler's intentions, and then act accordingly.
<P>
Scarcely had I come before him than Salensus Oll summoned Thurid also.
<P>
"Dator Thurid," he said, "you have made a strange request of me;
but, in accordance with your wishes and your promise that it will
result only to my interests, I have decided to accede.
<P>
"You tell me that a certain announcement will be the means of
convicting this prisoner and, at the same time, open the way to the
gratification of my dearest wish."
<P>
Thurid nodded.
<P>
"Then shall I make the announcement here before all my nobles,"
continued Salensus Oll.  "For a year no queen has sat upon the
throne beside me, and now it suits me to take to wife one who
is reputed the most beautiful woman upon Barsoom.  A statement
which none may truthfully deny.
<P>
"Nobles of Okar, unsheathe your swords and do homage to Dejah
Thoris, Princess of Helium and future Queen of Okar, for at the end
of the allotted ten days she shall become the wife of Salensus Oll."
<P>
As the nobles drew their blades and lifted them on high, in
accordance with the ancient custom of Okar when a jeddak announces
his intention to wed, Dejah Thoris sprang to her feet and, raising
her hand aloft, cried in a loud voice that they desist.
<P>
"I may not be the wife of Salensus Oll," she pleaded, "for
already I be a wife and mother.  John Carter, Prince of Helium,
still lives.  I know it to be true, for I overheard Matai Shang
tell his daughter Phaidor that he had seen him in Kaor, at the
court of Kulan Tith, Jeddak.  A jeddak does not wed a married
woman, nor will Salensus Oll thus violate the bonds of matrimony."
<P>
Salensus Oll turned upon Thurid with an ugly look.
<P>
"Is this the surprise you held in store for me?" he cried.
"You assured me that no obstacle which might not be easily
overcome stood between me and this woman, and now I find that
the one insuperable obstacle intervenes.  What mean you, man?
What have you to say?"
<P>
"And should I deliver John Carter into your hands, Salensus Oll,
would you not feel that I had more than satisfied the promise
that I made you?" answered Thurid.
<P>
"Talk not like a fool," cried the enraged jeddak.  "I am no
child to be thus played with."
<P>
"I am talking only as a man who knows," replied Thurid.
"Knows that he can do all that he claims."
<P>
"Then turn John Carter over to me within ten days or yourself
suffer the end that I should mete out to him were he in my power!"
snapped the Jeddak of Jeddaks, with an ugly scowl.
<P>
"You need not wait ten days, Salensus Oll," replied Thurid;
and then, turning suddenly upon me as he extended a pointing
finger, he cried:  "There stands John Carter, Prince of Helium!"
<P>
"Fool!" shrieked Salensus Oll.  "Fool!  John Carter is a white man.
This fellow be as yellow as myself.  John Carter's face is
smooth--Matai Shang has described him to me.  This prisoner has a
beard and mustache as large and black as any in Okar.  Quick,
guardsmen, to the pits with the black maniac who wishes to throw
his life away for a poor joke upon your ruler!"
<P>
"Hold!" cried Thurid, and springing forward before I could guess
his intention, he had grasped my beard and ripped the whole false
fabric from my face and head, revealing my smooth, tanned skin
beneath and my close-cropped black hair.
<P>
Instantly pandemonium reigned in the audience chamber of Salensus Oll.
Warriors pressed forward with drawn blades, thinking that I might be
contemplating the assassination of the Jeddak of Jeddaks; while others,
out of curiosity to see one whose name was familiar from pole to pole,
crowded behind their fellows.
<P>
As my identity was revealed I saw Dejah Thoris spring to her feet--
amazement writ large upon her face--and then through that jam of
armed men she forced her way before any could prevent.  A moment
only and she was before me with outstretched arms and eyes filled
with the light of her great love.
<P>
"John Carter!  John Carter!" she cried as I folded her to my breast,
and then of a sudden I knew why she had denied me in the garden
beneath the tower.
<P>
What a fool I had been!  Expecting that she would penetrate the marvelous
disguise that had been wrought for me by the barber of Marentina!
She had not known me, that was all; and when she saw the sign of love
from a stranger she was offended and righteously indignant.  Indeed,
but I had been a fool.
<P>
"And it was you," she cried, "who spoke to me from the tower!
How could I dream that my beloved Virginian lay behind that fierce
beard and that yellow skin?"
<P>
She had been wont to call me her Virginian as a term of endearment,
for she knew that I loved the sound of that beautiful name,
made a thousand times more beautiful and hallowed by her dear lips,
and as I heard it again after all those long years my eyes
became dimmed with tears and my voice choked with emotion.
<P>
But an instant did I crush that dear form to me ere Salensus Oll,
trembling with rage and jealousy, shouldered his way to us.
<P>
"Seize the man," he cried to his warriors, and a hundred ruthless
hands tore us apart.
<P>
Well it was for the nobles of the court of Okar that John Carter
had been disarmed.  As it was, a dozen of them felt the weight
of my clenched fists, and I had fought my way half up the
steps before the throne to which Salensus Oll had carried Dejah
Thoris ere ever they could stop me.
<P>
Then I went down, fighting, beneath a half-hundred warriors; but
before they had battered me into unconsciousness I heard that from
the lips of Dejah Thoris that made all my suffering well worth while.
<P>
Standing there beside the great tyrant, who clutched her by the arm,
she pointed to where I fought alone against such awful odds.
<P>
"Think you, Salensus Oll, that the wife of such as he is," she cried,
"would ever dishonor his memory, were he a thousand times dead,
by mating with a lesser mortal?  Lives there upon any world such
another as John Carter, Prince of Helium?  Lives there another
man who could fight his way back and forth across a warlike planet,
facing savage beasts and hordes of savage men, for the love of a woman?
<P>
"I, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, am his.  He fought for me and won me.
If you be a brave man you will honor the bravery that is his, and you will
not kill him.  Make him a slave if you will, Salensus Oll; but spare his life.
I would rather be a slave with such as he than be Queen of Okar."
<P>
"Neither slave nor queen dictates to Salensus Oll," replied the
Jeddak of Jeddaks.  "John Carter shall die a natural death in the
Pit of Plenty, and the day he dies Dejah Thoris shall become my queen."
<P>
I did not hear her reply, for it was then that a blow upon my
head brought unconsciousness, and when I recovered my senses only
a handful of guardsmen remained in the audience chamber with me.
As I opened my eyes they goaded me with the points of their swords
and bade me rise.
<P>
Then they led me through long corridors to a court far toward the
center of the palace.
<P>
In the center of the court was a deep pit, near the edge of which stood
half a dozen other guardsmen, awaiting me.  One of them carried a long
rope in his hands, which he commenced to make ready as we approached.
<P>
We had come to within fifty feet of these men when I felt a
sudden strange and rapid pricking sensation in one of my fingers.
<P>
For a moment I was nonplused by the odd feeling, and then there
came to me recollection of that which in the stress of my adventure
I had entirely forgotten--the gift ring of Prince Talu of Marentina.
<P>
Instantly I looked toward the group we were nearing, at the
same time raising my left hand to my forehead, that the ring might
be visible to one who sought it.  Simultaneously one of the waiting
warriors raised his left hand, ostensibly to brush back his hair,
and upon one of his fingers I saw the duplicate of my own ring.
<P>
A quick look of intelligence passed between us, after which I kept
my eyes turned away from the warrior and did not look at him again,
for fear that I might arouse the suspicion of the Okarians.
When we reached the edge of the pit I saw that it was very deep,
and presently I realized I was soon to judge just how far it
extended below the surface of the court, for he who held the rope
passed it about my body in such a way that it could be released
from above at any time; and then, as all the warriors grasped it,
he pushed me forward, and I fell into the yawning abyss.
<P>
After the first jerk as I reached the end of the rope that
had been paid out to let me fall below the pit's edge they
lowered me quickly but smoothly.  The moment before the plunge,
while two or three of the men had been assisting in adjusting the
rope about me, one of them had brought his mouth close to my cheek,
and in the brief interval before I was cast into the forbidding
hole he breathed a single word into my ear:
<P>
"Courage!"
<P>
The pit, which my imagination had pictured as bottomless, proved to be
not more than a hundred feet in depth; but as its walls were smoothly
polished it might as well have been a thousand feet, for I could never
hope to escape without outside assistance.
<P>
For a day I was left in darkness; and then, quite suddenly,
a brilliant light illumined my strange cell.  I was reasonably
hungry and thirsty by this time, not having tasted food or drink
since the day prior to my incarceration.
<P>
To my amazement I found the sides of the pit, that I had
thought smooth, lined with shelves, upon which were the most
delicious viands and liquid refreshments that Okar afforded.
<P>
With an exclamation of delight I sprang forward to partake of
some of the welcome food, but ere ever I reached it the light
was extinguished, and, though I groped my way about the chamber,
my hands came in contact with nothing beside the smooth, hard wall
that I had felt on my first examination of my prison.
<P>
Immediately the pangs of hunger and thirst began to assail me.
Where before I had had but a mild craving for food and drink,
I now actually suffered for want of it, and all because of the
tantalizing sight that I had had of food almost within my grasp.
<P>
Once more darkness and silence enveloped me, a silence that was
broken only by a single mocking laugh.
<P>
For another day nothing occurred to break the monotony of my
imprisonment or relieve the suffering superinduced by hunger
and thirst.  Slowly the pangs became less keen, as suffering
deaded the activity of certain nerves; and then the light
flashed on once again, and before me stood an array of new
and tempting dishes, with great bottles of clear water and
flagons of refreshing wine, upon the outside of which the
cold sweat of condensation stood.
<P>
Again, with the hunger madness of a wild beast, I sprang
forward to seize those tempting dishes; but, as before,
the light went out and I came to a sudden stop against a hard wall.
<P>
Then the mocking laugh rang out for a second time.
<P>
The Pit of Plenty!
<P>
Ah, what a cruel mind must have devised this exquisite,
hellish torture!  Day after day was the thing repeated,
until I was on the verge of madness; and then, as I had
done in the pits of the Warhoons, I took a new, firm hold
upon my reason and forced it back into the channels of sanity.
<P>
By sheer will-power I regained control over my tottering mentality,
and so successful was I that the next time that the light came I sat
quite still and looked indifferently at the fresh and tempting food
almost within my reach.  Glad I was that I had done so, for it gave me
an opportunity to solve the seeming mystery of those vanishing banquets.
<P>
As I made no move to reach the food, the torturers left the light
turned on in the hope that at last I could refrain no longer from
giving them the delicious thrill of enjoyment that my former futile
efforts to obtain it had caused.
<P>
And as I sat scrutinizing the laden shelves I presently saw
how the thing was accomplished, and so simple was it that I
wondered I had not guessed it before.  The wall of my prison was of
clearest glass--behind the glass were the tantalizing viands.
<P>
After nearly an hour the light went out, but this time there was
no mocking laughter--at least not upon the part of my tormentors;
but I, to be at quits with them, gave a low laugh that none might
mistake for the cackle of a maniac.
<P>
Nine days passed, and I was weak from hunger and thirst, but no
longer suffering--I was past that.  Then, down through the
darkness above, a little parcel fell to the floor at my side.
<P>
Indifferently I groped for it, thinking it but some new
invention of my jailers to add to my sufferings.
<P>
At last I found it--a tiny package wrapped in paper, at the
end of a strong and slender cord.  As I opened it a few lozenges
fell to the floor.  As I gathered them up, feeling of them and
smelling of them, I discovered that they were tablets of
concentrated food such as are quite common in all parts of Barsoom.
<P>
Poison! I thought.
<P>
Well, what of it?  Why not end my misery now rather than drag out
a few more wretched days in this dark pit?  Slowly I raised one
of the little pellets to my lips.
<P>
"Good-bye, my Dejah Thoris!" I breathed.  "I have lived for
you and fought for you, and now my next dearest wish is to be
realized, for I shall die for you," and, taking the morsel
in my mouth, I devoured it.
<P>
One by one I ate them all, nor ever did anything taste better
than those tiny bits of nourishment, within which I knew must lie
the seeds of death--possibly of some hideous, torturing death.
<P>
As I sat quietly upon the floor of my prison, waiting for the end,
my fingers by accident came in contact with the bit of paper
in which the things had been wrapped; and as I idly played with it,
my mind roaming far back into the past, that I might live again for
a few brief moments before I died some of the many happy moments of
a long and happy life, I became aware of strange protuberances upon
the smooth surface of the parchment-like substance in my hands.
<P>
For a time they carried no special significance to my mind--I
merely was mildly wondrous that they were there; but at last they
seemed to take form, and then I realized that there was but a
single line of them, like writing.
<P>
Now, more interestedly, my fingers traced and retraced them.
There were four separate and distinct combinations of raised lines.
Could it be that these were four words, and that they were intended
to carry a message to me?
<P>
The more I thought of it the more excited I became, until my
fingers raced madly back and forth over those bewildering
little hills and valleys upon that bit of paper.
<P>
But I could make nothing of them, and at last I decided
that my very haste was preventing me from solving the mystery.
Then I took it more slowly.  Again and again my forefinger
traced the first of those four combinations.
<P>
Martian writing is rather difficult to explain to an Earth man--
it is something of a cross between shorthand and picture-writing,
and is an entirely different language from the spoken language of Mars.
<P>
Upon Barsoom there is but a single oral language.
<P>
It is spoken today by every race and nation, just as it was at
the beginning of human life upon Barsoom.  It has grown with the
growth of the planet's learning and scientific achievements, but so
ingenious a thing it is that new words to express new thoughts or
describe new conditions or discoveries form themselves--no other
word could explain the thing that a new word is required for other
than the word that naturally falls to it, and so, no matter how far
removed two nations or races, their spoken languages are identical.
<P>
Not so their written languages, however.  No two nations have the
same written language, and often cities of the same nation have
a written language that differs greatly from that of the nation
to which they belong.
<P>
Thus it was that the signs upon the paper, if in reality they
were words, baffled me for some time; but at last I made out
the first one.
<P>
It was "courage," and it was written in the letters of Marentina.
<P>
Courage!
<P>
That was the word the yellow guardsman had whispered in my ear
as I stood upon the verge of the Pit of Plenty.
<P>
The message must be from him, and he I knew was a friend.
<P>
With renewed hope I bent my every energy to the deciphering of
the balance of the message, and at last success rewarded my
endeavor--I had read the four words:
<P>
"Courage!  Follow the rope."
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
"FOLLOW THE ROPE"
<P>
<P>
What could it mean?
<P>
"Follow the rope."  What rope?
<P>
Presently I recalled the cord that had been attached to the
parcel when it fell at my side, and after a little groping my hand
came in contact with it again.  It depended from above, and when I
pulled upon it I discovered that it was rigidly fastened, possibly
at the pit's mouth.
<P>
Upon examination I found that the cord, though small, was amply able
to sustain the weight of several men.  Then I made another discovery--
there was a second message knotted in the rope at about the height
of my head.  This I deciphered more easily, now that the key was mine.
<P>
"Bring the rope with you.  Beyond the knots lies danger."
<P>
That was all there was to this message.  It was evidently
hastily formed--an afterthought.
<P>
I did not pause longer than to learn the contents of the
second message, and, though I was none too sure of the
meaning of the final admonition, "Beyond the knots lies danger,"
yet I was sure that here before me lay an avenue of escape,
and that the sooner I took advantage of it the more likely
was I to win to liberty.
<P>
At least, I could be but little worse off than I had been in
the Pit of Plenty.
<P>
I was to find, however, ere I was well out of that damnable
hole that I might have been very much worse off had I been
compelled to remain there another two minutes.
<P>
It had taken me about that length of time to ascend some fifty
feet above the bottom when a noise above attracted my attention.
To my chagrin I saw that the covering of the pit was being removed
far above me, and in the light of the courtyard beyond I saw a
number of yellow warriors.
<P>
Could it be that I was laboriously working my way into some new trap? 
Were the messages spurious, after all?  And then, just as my hope and
courage had ebbed to their lowest, I saw two things.
<P>
One was the body of a huge, struggling, snarling apt being lowered
over the side of the pit toward me, and the other was an aperture
in the side of the shaft--an aperture larger than a man's body,
into which my rope led.
<P>
Just as I scrambled into the dark hole before me the apt passed me,
reaching out with his mighty hands to clutch me, and snapping, growling,
and roaring in a most frightful manner.
<P>
Plainly now I saw the end for which Salensus Oll had destined me.
After first torturing me with starvation he had caused this
fierce beast to be lowered into my prison to finish the work that
the jeddak's hellish imagination had conceived.
<P>
And then another truth flashed upon me--I had lived nine days
of the allotted ten which must intervene before Salensus Oll could
make Dejah Thoris his queen.  The purpose of the apt was to insure
my death before the tenth day.
<P>
I almost laughed aloud as I thought how Salensus Oll's measure
of safety was to aid in defeating the very end he sought, for when
they discovered that the apt was alone in the Pit of Plenty they
could not know but that he had completely devoured me, and so no
suspicion of my escape would cause a search to be made for me.
<P>
Coiling the rope that had carried me thus far upon my strange
journey, I sought for the other end, but found that as I followed
it forward it extended always before me.  So this was the meaning
of the words:  "Follow the rope."
<P>
The tunnel through which I crawled was low and dark.  I had followed
it for several hundred yards when I felt a knot beneath my fingers.
"Beyond the knots lies danger."
<P>
Now I went with the utmost caution, and a moment later a sharp
turn in the tunnel brought me to an opening into a large,
brilliantly lighted chamber.
<P>
The trend of the tunnel I had been traversing had been slightly upward,
and from this I judged that the chamber into which I now found myself
looking must be either on the first floor of the palace or directly
beneath the first floor.
<P>
Upon the opposite wall were many strange instruments and devices,
and in the center of the room stood a long table, at which two men
were seated in earnest conversation.
<P>
He who faced me was a yellow man--a little, wizened-up,
pasty-faced old fellow with great eyes that showed the
white round the entire circumference of the iris.
<P>
His companion was a black man, and I did not need to see his
face to know that it was Thurid, for there was no other of the
First Born north of the ice-barrier.
<P>
Thurid was speaking as I came within hearing of the men's voices.
<P>
"Solan," he was saying, "there is no risk and the reward is great.
You know that you hate Salensus Oll and that nothing would
please you more than to thwart him in some cherished plan.
There be nothing that he more cherishes today than the idea
of wedding the beautiful Princess of Helium; but I, too,
want her, and with your help I may win her.
<P>
"You need not more than step from this room for an instant
when I give you the signal.  I will do the rest, and then, when I
am gone, you may come and throw the great switch back into its place,
and all will be as before.  I need but an hour's start to be safe
beyond the devilish power that you control in this hidden chamber
beneath the palace of your master.  See how easy," and with
the words the black dator rose from his seat and, crossing the
room, laid his hand upon a large, burnished lever that protruded
from the opposite wall.
<P>
"No! No!" cried the little old man, springing after him, with a
wild shriek.  "Not that one!  Not that one!  That controls the
sunray tanks, and should you pull it too far down, all Kadabra
would be consumed by heat before I could replace it.  Come away!
Come away!  You know not with what mighty powers you play.
This is the lever that you seek.  Note well the symbol inlaid
in white upon its ebon surface."
<P>
Thurid approached and examined the handle of the lever.
<P>
"Ah, a magnet," he said.  "I will remember.  It is settled
then I take it," he continued.
<P>
The old man hesitated.  A look of combined greed and
apprehension overspread his none too beautiful features.
<P>
"Double the figure," he said.  "Even that were all too small
an amount for the service you ask.  Why, I risk my life by even
entertaining you here within the forbidden precincts of my station.
Should Salensus Oll learn of it he would have me thrown to the apts
before the day was done."
<P>
"He dare not do that, and you know it full well, Solan,"
contradicted the black.  "Too great a power of life and death
you hold over the people of Kadabra for Salensus Oll ever to risk
threatening you with death.  Before ever his minions could lay
their hands upon you, you might seize this very lever from which
you have just warned me and wipe out the entire city."
<P>
"And myself into the bargain," said Solan, with a shudder.
<P>
"But if you were to die, anyway, you would find the nerve to do it,"
replied Thurid.
<P>
"Yes," muttered Solan, "I have often thought upon that very thing.
Well, First Born, is your red princess worth the price I ask for my
services, or will you go without her and see her in the arms of
Salensus Oll tomorrow night?"
<P>
"Take your price, yellow man," replied Thurid, with an oath.
"Half now and the balance when you have fulfilled your contract."
<P>
With that the dator threw a well-filled money-pouch upon the table.
<P>
Solan opened the pouch and with trembling fingers counted its contents.
His weird eyes assumed a greedy expression, and his unkempt beard
and mustache twitched with the muscles of his mouth and chin.
It was quite evident from his very mannerism that Thurid had
keenly guessed the man's weakness--even the clawlike, clutching
movement of the fingers betokened the avariciousness of the miser.
<P>
Having satisfied himself that the amount was correct, Solan
replaced the money in the pouch and rose from the table.
<P>
"Now," he said, "are you quite sure that you know the way to
your destination?  You must travel quickly to cover the ground
to the cave and from thence beyond the Great Power, all within
a brief hour, for no more dare I spare you."
<P>
"Let me repeat it to you," said Thurid, "that you may see if
I be letter-perfect."
<P>
"Proceed," replied Solan.
<P>
"Through yonder door," he commenced, pointing to a door at the
far end of the apartment, "I follow a corridor, passing three
diverging corridors upon my right; then into the fourth right-hand
corridor straight to where three corridors meet; here again I
follow to the right, hugging the left wall closely to avoid the pit.
<P>
"At the end of this corridor I shall come to a spiral runway,
which I must follow down instead of up; after that the way
is along but a single branchless corridor.  Am I right?"
<P>
"Quite right, Dator," answered Solan; "and now begone.  Already
have you tempted fate too long within this forbidden place."
<P>
"Tonight, or tomorrow, then, you may expect the signal," said Thurid,
rising to go.
<P>
"Tonight, or tomorrow," repeated Solan, and as the door closed
behind his guest the old man continued to mutter as he turned
back to the table, where he again dumped the contents of the
money-pouch, running his fingers through the heap of shining metal;
piling the coins into little towers; counting, recounting, and fondling
the wealth the while he muttered on and on in a crooning undertone.
<P>
Presently his fingers ceased their play; his eyes popped wider than ever
as they fastened upon the door through which Thurid had disappeared.
The croon changed to a querulous muttering, and finally to an ugly growl.
<P>
Then the old man rose from the table, shaking his fist at the closed door.
Now he raised his voice, and his words came distinctly.
<P>
"Fool!" he muttered.  "Think you that for your happiness Solan
will give up his life?  If you escaped, Salensus Oll would
know that only through my connivance could you have succeeded.
Then would he send for me.  What would you have me do?  Reduce the
city and myself to ashes?  No, fool, there is a better way--a better
way for Solan to keep thy money and be revenged upon Salensus Oll."
<P>
He laughed in a nasty, cackling note.
<P>
"Poor fool!  You may throw the great switch that will give you
the freedom of the air of Okar, and then, in fatuous security,
go on with thy red princess to the freedom of--death.  When you have
passed beyond this chamber in your flight, what can prevent Solan
replacing the switch as it was before your vile hand touched it?
Nothing; and then the Guardian of the North will claim you and your
woman, and Salensus Oll, when he sees your dead bodies, will never
dream that the hand of Solan had aught to do with the thing."
<P>
Then his voice dropped once more into mutterings that I could
not translate, but I had heard enough to cause me to guess a
great deal more, and I thanked the kind Providence that had led
me to this chamber at a time so filled with importance to Dejah
Thoris and myself as this.
<P>
But how to pass the old man now!  The cord, almost invisible
upon the floor, stretched straight across the apartment to a door
upon the far side.
<P>
There was no other way of which I knew, nor could I afford to
ignore the advice to "follow the rope."  I must cross this room,
but however I should accomplish it undetected with that old man
in the very center of it baffled me.
<P>
Of course I might have sprung in upon him and with my bare hands
silenced him forever, but I had heard enough to convince me that
with him alive the knowledge that I had gained might serve me
at some future moment, while should I kill him and another be
stationed in his place Thurid would not come hither with Dejah
Thoris, as was quite evidently his intention.
<P>
As I stood in the dark shadow of the tunnel's end racking my
brain for a feasible plan the while I watched, catlike, the old
man's every move, he took up the money-pouch and crossed to one
end of the apartment, where, bending to his knees, he fumbled with
a panel in the wall.
<P>
Instantly I guessed that here was the hiding place in which he
hoarded his wealth, and while he bent there, his back toward me, I
entered the chamber upon tiptoe, and with the utmost stealth
essayed to reach the opposite side before he should complete his
task and turn again toward the room's center.
<P>
Scarcely thirty steps, all told, must I take, and yet it
seemed to my overwrought imagination that that farther wall was
miles away; but at last I reached it, nor once had I taken my eyes
from the back of the old miser's head.
<P>
He did not turn until my hand was upon the button that controlled
the door through which my way led, and then he turned away
from me as I passed through and gently closed the door.
<P>
For an instant I paused, my ear close to the panel, to learn
if he had suspected aught, but as no sound of pursuit came from
within I wheeled and made my way along the new corridor, following
the rope, which I coiled and brought with me as I advanced.
<P>
But a short distance farther on I came to the rope's end at
a point where five corridors met.  What was I to do?  Which
way should I turn?  I was nonplused.
<P>
A careful examination of the end of the rope revealed the fact
that it had been cleanly cut with some sharp instrument.  This fact
and the words that had cautioned me that danger lay beyond the
KNOTS convinced me that the rope had been severed since my friend
had placed it as my guide, for I had but passed a single knot,
whereas there had evidently been two or more in the entire length
of the cord.
<P>
Now, indeed, was I in a pretty fix, for neither did I know
which avenue to follow nor when danger lay directly in my path;
but there was nothing else to be done than follow one of the corridors,
for I could gain nothing by remaining where I was.
<P>
So I chose the central opening, and passed on into its gloomy
depths with a prayer upon my lips.
<P>
The floor of the tunnel rose rapidly as I advanced, and a
moment later the way came to an abrupt end before a heavy door.
<P>
I could hear nothing beyond, and, with my accustomed rashness,
pushed the portal wide to step into a room filled with yellow
warriors.
<P>
The first to see me opened his eyes wide in astonishment, and
at the same instant I felt the tingling sensation in my finger
that denoted the presence of a friend of the ring.
<P>
Then others saw me, and there was a concerted rush to lay hands upon me,
for these were all members of the palace guard--men familiar with my face.
<P>
The first to reach me was the wearer of the mate to my strange ring,
and as he came close he whispered:  "Surrender to me!" then in a
loud voice shouted:  "You are my prisoner, white man," and menaced
me with his two weapons.
<P>
And so John Carter, Prince of Helium, meekly surrendered to a
single antagonist.  The others now swarmed about us, asking many
questions, but I would not talk to them, and finally my captor
announced that he would lead me back to my cell.
<P>
An officer ordered several other warriors to accompany him,
and a moment later we were retracing the way I had just come.
My friend walked close beside me, asking many silly questions
about the country from which I had come, until finally his
fellows paid no further attention to him or his gabbling.
<P>
Gradually, as he spoke, he lowered his voice, so that presently he was
able to converse with me in a low tone without attracting attention.
His ruse was a clever one, and showed that Talu had not misjudged
the man's fitness for the dangerous duty upon which he was detailed.
<P>
When he had fully assured himself that the other guardsmen were
not listening, he asked me why I had not followed the rope,
and when I told him that it had ended at the five corridors he said
that it must have been cut by someone in need of a piece of rope,
for he was sure that "the stupid Kadabrans would never have guessed
its purpose."
<P>
Before we had reached the spot from which the five corridors
diverge my Marentinian friend had managed to drop to the rear of
the little column with me, and when we came in sight of the
branching ways he whispered:
<P>
"Run up the first upon the right.  It leads to the watchtower upon
the south wall.  I will direct the pursuit up the next corridor,"
and with that he gave me a great shove into the dark mouth of
the tunnel, at the same time crying out in simulated pain
and alarm as he threw himself upon the floor as though I had
felled him with a blow. 
<P>
From behind the voices of the excited guardsmen came
reverberating along the corridor, suddenly growing fainter as
Talu's spy led them up the wrong passageway in fancied pursuit.
<P>
As I ran for my life through the dark galleries beneath the palace
of Salensus Oll I must indeed have presented a remarkable appearance
had there been any to note it, for though death loomed large about me,
my face was split by a broad grin as I thought of the resourcefulness
of the nameless hero of Marentina to whom I owed my life.
<P>
Of such stuff are the men of my beloved Helium, and when I meet another
of their kind, of whatever race or color, my heart goes out to him as
it did now to my new friend who had risked his life for me simply
because I wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger.
<P>
The corridor along which I ran led almost straight for
a considerable distance, terminating at the foot of a
spiral runway, up which I proceeded to emerge presently
into a circular chamber upon the first floor of a tower.
<P>
In this apartment a dozen red slaves were employed polishing
or repairing the weapons of the yellow men.  The walls of the
room were lined with racks in which were hundreds of straight and
hooked swords, javelins, and daggers.  It was evidently an armory.
There were but three warriors guarding the workers.
<P>
My eyes took in the entire scene at a glance.  Here were weapons
in plenty!  Here were sinewy red warriors to wield them!
<P>
And here now was John Carter, Prince of Helium, in need both
of weapons and warriors!
<P>
As I stepped into the apartment, guards and prisoners saw me
simultaneously.
<P>
Close to the entrance where I stood was a rack of straight
swords, and as my hand closed upon the hilt of one of them my eyes
fell upon the faces of two of the prisoners who worked side by side.
<P>
One of the guards started toward me.  "Who are you?" he demanded.
"What do you here?"
<P>
"I come for Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and his son, Mors Kajak,"
I cried, pointing to the two red prisoners, who had now
sprung to their feet, wide-eyed in astonished recognition.
<P>
"Rise, red men!  Before we die let us leave a memorial in the
palace of Okar's tyrant that will stand forever in the annals of
Kadabra to the honor and glory of Helium," for I had seen that all
the prisoners there were men of Tardos Mors's navy.
<P>
Then the first guardsman was upon me and the fight was on,
but scarce did we engage ere, to my horror, I saw that the
red slaves were shackled to the floor.
