<p>As was intimated at the close of the preceding chapter, the individual
who has figured thus far as Cyrus Sutton, interested in the cattle
business, was in reality James Carter, the well-known detective
of the metropolis.</p>

<p>When he received word from Archie Jackson of the robbery that
had been committed near Tottenville, he went out at once to the
little town to investigate. Mr. Carter was a shrewd man, who understood
his business, and he took the precaution to go in such a disguise
that the fussy little constable never once suspected his identity.
The detective wished to find out whether it would do to trust
the officer, and he was quick to see that if Jackson was taken
into his confidence, he would be likely to spoil everything, from
his inability to keep a secret.</p>

<p>So the real detective went to work in his own fashion, following
up the clews with care, and allowing Jackson to disport himself
as seemed best.</p>

<p>He was not slow to fix his suspicions on the right parties, and
he then devoted himself to winning the confidence of Bud Heyland.
It would have been an easy matter to fasten the guilt on this
bad boy, but the keen-witted officer was quick to perceive that
he had struck another and more important trail, which could not
be followed to a successful conclusion without the full confidence
of young Heyland.</p>

<p>He learned that Bud was being used as a tool by other parties,
who were circulating counterfeit money, and Jacob Kincade was
one of the leaders, with the other two who composed the company
in New York. The detectives in that city were put to work and
captured the knaves almost at the same time that Bud and Kincade
were taken.</p>

<p>It required a little time for Mr. Carter to satisfy himself beyond
all mistake that the two named were the ones who were engaged
in the dangerous pursuit of "shoving" spurious money, and he resolved
that when he moved he would have the proof established beyond
a shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>He easily drew the most important facts from Bud, and thus it
will be seen the recovery of the stolen silverware became secondary
to the detection of the dealers in counterfeit money.</p>

<p>The officer was annoyed by the failure of Kincade to appear on
the night he agreed, and was fearful lest he suspected something
and would keep out of the way. He could have taken him at the
time Fred Sheldon was paid his reward, for he knew the showman
at that time had a lot of bad money in his possession, though
he paid good bills to Fred, who, it will be remembered, placed
them in the hands of Squire Jones.</p>

<p>Bud was determined to exchange bad currency for this, and waylaid
Fred for that purpose, but failed, for the reason already given.
He, however, gave Fred twenty dollars to change, which it will
also be remembered fell into the hands of the detective a few
minutes later, and was one of the several links in the chain of
evidence that was forged about the unsuspecting youth and his
employer.</p>

<p>Then Bud, like many beginners in actual transgression, became
careless, and worked off a great deal of the counterfeit money
in the village where he was staying, among the lot being the one
hundred dollars which he paid the liveryman for wrecking his wagon.</p>

<p>When Fred Sheldon came into the village to claim his reward for
securing the estray lion, Cyrus Sutton, as he was known, who was
sitting on the hotel porch, became interested in him. He scrutinized
him sharply, but avoided asking him any questions. It was natural,
however, that he should feel some curiosity, and he learned that
what he suspected was true; the boy was the child of Mary Sheldon,
who was the widow of George Sheldon, killed some years before
on the battle-field.</p>

<p>George Sheldon and James Carter had been comrades from the beginning
of the war until the former fell while fighting for his country.
The two had "drank from the same canteen," and were as closely
bound together as if brothers. Carter held the head of Sheldon
when he lay dying, and sent the last message to his wife, who
had also been a schoolmate of Carter's.</p>

<p>An aptitude which the latter showed in tracing crime and wrong-doers
led him into the detective business, and he lost sight of the
widow of his old friend and their baby boy, until drawn to Tottenville
in the pursuit of his profession.</p>

<p>He reproached himself that he did not discover the truth sooner,
but when he found that Mrs. Sheldon was absent he could only wait
until she returned, and as we have shown, he took the first occasion
to call upon her and renew the acquaintance of former years.</p>

<p>But the moment Carter identified the brave little fellow who
had earned his reward for capturing the wild beast he made up
his mind to do a generous thing for him and his mother; he was
determined that if it could possibly be brought about Fred should
receive the five hundred dollars reward offered for the recovery
of the silver plate stolen from the Misses Perkinpine.</p>

<p>Circumstances already had done a good deal to help him in his
laudable purpose, for, as we have shown, Fred had witnessed the
robbery, and, in fact, had been brought in contact with both of
the guilty parties.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter was afraid to take Fred into his entire confidence,
on account of his tender years; and though he was an unusually
bright and courageous lad, the detective was reluctant to bring
him into any more intimate association with crime than was necessary
from the service he intended to do him.</p>

<p>As he was too prudent to trust the constable, Archie Jackson,
it will be seen that he worked entirely alone until the night
that Mrs. Sheldon returned home.</p>

<p>Then he called upon her and told her his whole plans, for he
knew that Fred inherited a good deal of his bravery from her,
and though it was contrary to his rule to make a confidant of
any one, he did not hesitate to tell her all.</p>

<p>She was deeply grateful for the kindness he contemplated, though
she was not assured that it was for the best to involve Fred as
was proposed.</p>

<p>The detective, however, succeeded in overcoming her scruples,
and they agreed upon the plan of action.</p>

<p>The boy was encouraged to make his hunt in the wood, for Carter
had already learned from Bud Heyland that the plunder was hidden
somewhere in it, and he had agreed to assist in bringing it forth,
though Bud would not agree to show him precisely where it was,
until the time should come for taking it away.</p>

<p>When Fred found the hiding place he was so overjoyed that for
awhile he did not know what to do; finally he concluded, as a
matter of safety, to remove and hide it somewhere else.</p>

<p>Accordingly he tugged and lifted the heavy pieces out one by
one, and then carried them all some distance, placed them on the
ground at the foot of a large beech tree and covered them up as
best he could with leaves.</p>

<p>This took him until nearly noon, when he ran home to tell his
mother what he had done. Within the next hour James Carter knew
it and he laughed with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"It was the wisest thing that could have been done."</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked the widow.</p>

<p>"Don't you see he has already earned the reward, and, what is
more, he shall have it, too. He has recovered the plate without
the slightest assistance from any one."</p>

<p>"But the thieves have not been caught."</p>

<p>"That is my work; I will attend to that."</p>

<p>"And what shall Fred do?"</p>

<p>"Keep him home to-night, give him a good supper and put him to
bed early, and tell him it will be all right in the morning."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon did not feel exactly clear that it was "all right,"
but the good-hearted Carter had a way of carrying his point, and
he would not listen to any argument from her.</p>

<p>So she performed her part of the programme in spirit and letter,
and when Fred Sheldon closed his eyes in slumber that Saturday
evening it was in the belief that everything would come out as
his mother promised, even though he believed that one of the guiltiest
of the criminals was the man known as Cyrus Sutton.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sheldon wanted to tell the little fellow the whole story
that night, but the detective would not consent until the "case
was closed."</p>

<p>When Archie Jackson was called upon late in the afternoon by
James Carter and informed how matters stood, he was dumfounded
for several minutes. It seemed like doubting his own senses, to
believe that the cattle drover was no other than the famous New
York detective, but he was convinced at last, and entered with
great ardor into the scheme for the capture of the criminals.</p>

<p>Mr. Carter impressed upon the constable the fact that the offered
reward had already been earned by Master Fred Sheldon. Archie
was disposed to demur, but finally, with some show of grace, he
gave in and said he would be pleased to extend his congratulations
to the young gentleman.</p>

<p>A little judicious flattery on the part of the detective convinced
Archie that a point had been reached in the proceedings, where
his services were indispensable, and that, if the two law breakers
were to be captured, it must be through the help of the brave
Tottenville constable, who would receive liberal compensation
for his assistance.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Archie was stationed near the spot where it was
certain Bud Heyland and Jacob Kincade would appear, later in the
evening.</p>

<p>At a preconcerted signal, he sprang from his concealment, and
the reader has learned that he performed his part in really creditable
style.</p>
