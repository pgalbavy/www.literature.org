<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The vow was at an end.  In place of the silent army of yesterday
a mob of maddened savages surged around me.  They were chanting
a wild song, and brandishing spears and rifles to its accompaniment. 
From their bloodshot eyes stared the lust of blood, the fury of
conquest, and all the aboriginal passions on which Laputa had
laid his spell.  In my mind ran a fragment from Laputa's prayer
in the cave about the 'Terrible Ones.' Machudi's men&mdash;stout fellows,
they held their ground as long as they could&mdash;were swept out of
the way, and the wave of black savagery seemed to close over my
head.</p>

<p>I thought my last moment had come.  Certainly it had but for
Colin. The bag had been taken from his head, and the fellow of
Machudi's had dropped the rope round his collar.  In a red fury
of wrath the dog leaped at my enemies.  Though every man of them
was fully armed, they fell back, for I have noticed always that
Kaffirs are mortally afraid of a white man's dog.  Colin had the
sense to keep beside me.  Growling like a thunderstorm he held
the ring around my litter.</p>

<p>The breathing space would not have lasted long, but it gave me
time to get to my feet.  My wrists and feet had been unbound long
before, and the rest had cured my leg-weariness. I stood up in
that fierce circle with the clear knowledge that my life hung
by a hair.</p>

<p>'Take me to Inkulu,' I cried.  'Dogs and fools, would you despise
his orders?  If one hair of my head is hurt, he will flay you
alive.  Show me the way to him, and clear out of it.'</p>

<p>I dare say there was a break in my voice, for I was dismally
frightened, but there must have been sufficient authority to get
me a hearing.  Machudi's men closed up behind me, and repeated
my words with flourishes and gestures.  But still the circle held. 
No man came nearer me, but none moved so as to give me passage.</p>

<p>Then I screwed up my courage, and did the only thing possible. 
I walked straight into the circle, knowing well that I was running
no light risk.  My courage, as I have already explained, is of
little use unless I am doing something.  I could not endure another
minute of sitting still with those fierce eyes on me.</p>

<p>The circle gave way.  Sullenly they made a road for me, closing
up behind on my guards, so that Machudi's men were swallowed in
the mob, Alone I stalked forward with all that huge yelling crowd
behind me.</p>

<p>I had not far to go.  Inanda's Kraal was a cluster of kyas and
rondavels, shaped in a half-moon, with a flat space between the
houses, where grew a big merula tree.  All around was a medley
of little fires, with men squatted beside them. Here and there
a party had finished their meal, and were swaggering about with
a great shouting.  The mob into which I had fallen was of this
sort, and I saw others within the confines of the camp.  But around
the merula tree there was a gathering of chiefs, if I could judge
by the comparative quiet and dignity of the men, who sat in rows
on the ground.  A few were standing, and among them I caught sight
of Laputa's tall figure.  I strode towards it, wondering if the
chiefs would let me pass.</p>

<p>The hubbub of my volunteer attendants brought the eyes of the
company round to me.  In a second it seemed every man was on his
feet.  I could only pray that Laputa would get to me before his
friends had time to spear me.  I remember I fixed my eyes on a
spur of hill beyond the kraal, and walked on with the best resolution
I could find.  Already I felt in my breast some of the long thin
assegais of Umbooni's men.</p>

<p>But Laputa did not intend that I should be butchered.  A word
from him brought his company into order, and the next thing I
knew I was facing him, where he stood in front of the biggest
kya, with Henriques beside him, and some of the northern indunas. 
Henriques looked ghastly in the clear morning light, and he had
a linen rag bound round his head and jaw, as if he suffered from
toothache.  His face was more livid, his eyes more bloodshot,
and at the sight of me his hand went to his belt, and his teeth
snapped.  But he held his peace, and it was Laputa who spoke. 
He looked straight through me, and addressed Machudi's men.</p>

<p>'You have brought back the prisoner.  That is well, and your
service will be remembered.  Go to 'Mpefu's camp on the hill there,
and you will be given food.'</p>

<p>The men departed, and with them fell away the crowd which had
followed me.  I was left, very giddy and dazed, to confront Laputa
and his chiefs.  The whole scene was swimming before my eyes. 
I remember there was a clucking of hens from somewhere behind
the kraal, which called up ridiculous memories.  I was trying
to remember the plan I had made in Machudi's glen.  I kept saying
to myself like a parrot: 'The army cannot know about the jewels. 
Laputa must keep his loss secret.  I can get my life from him
if I offer to give them back.' It had sounded a good scheme three
hours before, but with the man's hard face before me, it seemed
a frail peg to hang my fate on.</p>

<p>Laputa's eye fell on me, a clear searching eye with a question
in it.</p>

<p>There was something he was trying to say to me which he dared
not put into words.  I guessed what the something was, for I saw
his glance run over my shirt and my empty pockets.</p>

<p>'You have made little of your treachery,' he said.  'Fool, did
you think to escape me?  I could bring you back from the ends
of the earth.'</p>

<p>'There was no treachery,' I replied.  'Do you blame a prisoner
for trying to escape?  When shooting began I found myself free,
and I took the road for home.  Ask Machudi's men and they will
tell you that I came quietly with them, when I saw that the game
was up.'</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.  'It matters very little what you
did.  You are here now.&mdash;  Tie him up and put him in my kya,'
he said to the bodyguard.  'I have something to say to him before
he dies.'</p>

<p>As the men laid hands on me, I saw the exultant grin on Henriques'
face.  It was more than I could endure.</p>

<p>'Stop,' I said.  'You talk of traitors, Mr Laputa.  There is
the biggest and blackest at your elbow.  That man sent word to
Arcoll about your crossing at Dupree's Drift.  At our outspan
at noon yesterday he came to me and offered me my liberty if I
would help him.  He told me he was a spy, and I flung his offer
in his face.  It was he who shot the Keeper by the river side,
and would have stolen the Snake if I had not broken his head. 
You call me a traitor, and you let that thing live, though he
has killed your priest and betrayed your plans.  Kill me if you
like, but by God let him die first.'</p>

<p>I do not know how the others took the revelation, for my eyes
were only for the Portugoose.  He made a step towards me, his
hands twitching by his sides.</p>

<p>'You lie,' he screamed in that queer broken voice which much
fever gives.  'It was this English hound that killed the Keeper,
and felled me when I tried to save him.  The man who insults my
honour is dead.' And he plucked from his belt a pistol.</p>

<p>A good shot does not miss at two yards.  I was never nearer my
end than in that fraction of time while the weapon came up to
the aim.  It was scarcely a second, but it was enough for Colin. 
The dog had kept my side, and had stood docilely by me while Laputa
spoke.  The truth is, he must have been as tired as I was.  As
the Kaffirs approached to lay hands on me he had growled menacingly,
but when I spoke again he had stopped.  Henriques' voice had convinced
him of a more urgent danger, and so soon as the trigger hand of
the Portugoose rose, the dog sprang. The bullet went wide, and
the next moment dog and man were struggling on the ground.</p>

<p>A dozen hands held me from going to Colin's aid, but oddly enough
no one stepped forward to help Henriques.  The ruffian kept his
head, and though the dog's teeth were in his shoulder, he managed
to get his right hand free.  I saw what would happen, and yelled
madly in my apprehension.  The yellow wrist curved, and the pistol
barrel was pressed below the dog's shoulder.  Thrice he fired,
the grip relaxed, and Colin rolled over limply, fragments of shirt
still hanging from his jaw.  The Portugoose rose slowly with his
hand to his head, and a thin stream of blood dripping from his
shoulder. As I saw the faithful eyes glazing in death, and knew
that I had lost the best of all comrades, I went clean berserk
mad. The cluster of men round me, who had been staring open-eyed
at the fight, were swept aside like reeds.  I went straight for
the Portugoose, determined that, pistol or no pistol, I would
serve him as he had served my dog.</p>

<p>For my years I was a well-set-up lad, long in the arms and deep
in the chest.  But I had not yet come to my full strength, and
in any case I could not hope to fight the whole of Laputa's army. 
I was flung back and forwards like a shuttlecock.  They played
some kind of game with me, and I could hear the idiotic Kaffir
laughter.  It was blind man's buff, so far as I was concerned,
for I was blind with fury.  I struck out wildly left and right,
beating the air often, but sometimes getting in a solid blow on
hard black flesh.  I was soundly beaten myself, pricked with spears,
and made to caper for savage sport. Suddenly I saw Laputa before
me, and hurled myself madly at his chest.  Some one gave me a
clout on the head, and my senses fled.</p>

<p>When I came to myself, I was lying on a heap of mealie-stalks
in a dark room.  I had a desperate headache, and a horrid nausea,
which made me fall back as soon as I tried to raise myself. A
voice came out of the darkness as I stirred&mdash;a voice speaking
English.</p>

<p>'Are you awake, Mr Storekeeper?'</p>

<p>The voice was Laputa's, but I could not see him.  The room was
pitch dark, except for a long ray of sunlight on the floor.</p>

<p>'I'm awake,' I said.  'What do you want with me?'</p>

<p>Some one stepped out of the gloom and sat down near me. A naked
black foot broke the belt of light on the floor.</p>

<p>'For God's sake get me a drink,' I murmured. The figure rose
and fetched a pannikin of water from a pail. I could hear the
cool trickle of the drops on the metal.  A hand put the dish to
my mouth, and I drank water with a strong dash of spirits.  This
brought back my nausea, and I collapsed on the mealie-stalks till
the fit passed. Again the voice spoke, this time from close at
hand.</p>

<p>'You are paying the penalty of being a fool, Mr Storekeeper.
You are young to die, but folly is common in youth.  In an hour
you will regret that you did not listen to my advice at Umvelos'.'</p>

<p>I clawed at my wits and strove to realize what he was saying.
He spoke of death within an hour.  If it only came sharp and sudden,
I did not mind greatly.  The plan I had made had slipped utterly
out of my mind. My body was so wretched, that I asked only for
rest.  I was very lighthearted and foolish at that moment.</p>

<p>'Kill me if you like,' I whispered.  'Some day you will pay dearly
for it all.  But for God's sake go away and leave me alone.'</p>

<p>Laputa laughed.  It was a horrid sound in the darkness.</p>

<p>'You are brave, Mr Storekeeper, but I have seen a brave man's
courage ebb very fast when he saw the death which I have arranged
for you. Would you like to hear something of it by way of preparation?'</p>

<p>In a low gentle voice he began to tell me mysteries of awful
cruelty. At first I scarcely heard him, but as he went on my brain
seemed to wake from its lethargy.  I listened with freezing blood. 
Not in my wildest nightmares had I imagined such a fate.  Then
in despite of myself a cry broke from me.</p>

<p>'It interests you?' Laputa asked.  'I could tell you more, but
something must be left to the fancy.  Yours should be an active
one,' and his hand gripped my shaking wrist and felt my pulse.</p>

<p>'Henriques will see that the truth does not fall short of my
forecast,' he went on.  'For I have appointed Henriques your executioner.'</p>

<p>The name brought my senses back to me.</p>

<p>'Kill me,' I said, 'but for God's sake kill Henriques too.  If
you did justice you would let me go and roast the Portugoose alive. 
But for me the Snake would be over the Lebombo by this time in
Henriques' pocket.'</p>

<p>'But it is not, my friend.  It was stolen by a storekeeper, who
will shortly be wishing he had died in his mother's womb.'</p>

<p>My plan was slowly coming back to me.</p>

<p>'If you value Prester John's collar, you will save my life. What
will your rising be without the Snake?  Would they follow you
a yard if they suspected you had lost it?'</p>

<p>'So you would threaten me,' Laputa said very gently.  Then in
a burst of wrath he shouted, 'They will follow me to hell for
my own sake. Imbecile, do you think my power is built on a trinket? 
When you are in your grave, I will be ruling a hundred millions
from the proudest throne on earth.'</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, and pulled back a shutter of the window,
letting a flood of light into the hut.  In that light I saw that
he had in his hands the ivory box which had contained the collar.</p>

<p>'I will carry the casket through the wars,' he cried, 'and if
I choose never to open it, who will gainsay me?  You besotted
fool, to think that any theft of yours could hinder my destiny!'
He was the blustering savage again, and I preferred him in the
part.  All that he said might be true, but I thought I could detect
in his voice a keen regret, and in his air a touch of disquiet. 
The man was a fanatic, and like all fanatics had his superstitions.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, 'but when you mount the throne you speak of, it
would be a pity not to have the rubies on your neck after all
your talk in the cave.'</p>

<p>I thought he would have throttled me.  He glowered down at me
with murder in his eyes.  Then he dashed the casket on the floor
with such violence that it broke into fragments.</p>

<p>'Give me back the <em>Ndhlondhlo</em>,' he cried, like a petted
child. 'Give me back the collar of John.'</p>

<p>This was the moment I had been waiting for.</p>

<p>'Now see here, Mr Laputa,' I said.  'I am going to talk business.
Before you started this rising, you were a civilized man with
a good education.  Well, just remember that education for a minute,
and look at the matter in a sensible light. I'm not like the Portugoose. 
I don't want to steal your rubies. I swear to God that what I
have told you is true.  Henriques killed the priest, and would
have bagged the jewels if I had not laid him out.  I ran away
because I was going to be killed to-day, and I took the collar
to keep it out of Henriques' hands.  I tell you I would never
have shot the old man myself.  Very well, what happened?  Your
men overtook me, and I had no choice but to surrender.  Before
they reached me, I hid the collar in a place I know of.  Now,
I am going to make you a fair and square business proposition. 
You may be able to get on without the Snake, but I can see you
want it back.  I am in a tight place and want nothing so much
as my life.  I offer to trade with you.  Give me my life, and
I will take you to the place and put the jewels in your hand. 
Otherwise you may kill me, but you will never see the collar of
John again.'</p>

<p>I still think that was a pretty bold speech for a man to make
in a predicament like mine.  But it had its effect.  Laputa ceased
to be the barbarian king, and talked like a civilized man.</p>

<p>'That is, as you call it, a business proposition.  But supposing
I refuse it?  Supposing I take measures here&mdash;in this kraal&mdash;to
make you speak, and then send for the jewels.'</p>

<p>'There are several objections,' I said, quite cheerfully, for
I felt that I was gaining ground.  'One is that I could not explain
to any mortal soul how to find the collar.  I know where it is,
but I could not impart the knowledge.  Another is that the country
between here and Machudi's is not very healthy for your people. 
Arcoll's men are all over it, and you cannot have a collection
of search parties rummaging about in the glen for long.  Last
and most important, if you send any one for the jewels, you confess
their loss.  No, Mr Laputa, if you want them back, you must go
yourself and take me with you.'</p>

<p>He stood silent for a little, with his brows knit in thought.
Then he opened the door and went out.  I guessed that he had gone
to discover from his scouts the state of the country between Inanda's
Kraal and Machudi's glen.  Hope had come back to me, and I sat
among the mealie-stalks trying to plan the future.  If he made
a bargain I believed he would keep it. Once set free at the head
of Machudi's, I should be within an hour or two of Arcoll's posts. 
So far, I had done nothing for the cause.  My message had been
made useless by Henriques' treachery, and I had stolen the Snake
only to restore it.  But if I got off with my life, there would
be work for me to do in the Armageddon which I saw approaching. 
Should I escape, I wondered.  What would hinder Laputa from setting
his men to follow me, and seize me before I could get into safety? 
My only chance was that Arcoll might have been busy this day,
and the countryside too full of his men to let Laputa's Kaffirs
through.  But if this was so, Laputa and I should be stopped,
and then Laputa would certainly kill me.  I wished&mdash;and yet I
did not wish&mdash;that Arcoll should hold all approaches.  As I reflected,
my first exhilaration died away.  The scales were still heavily
weighted against me.</p>

<p>Laputa returned, closing the door behind him.</p>

<p>'I will bargain with you on my own terms.  You shall have your
life, and in return you will take me to the place where you hid
the collar, and put it into my hands.  I will ride there, and
you will run beside me, tied to my saddle.  If we are in danger
from the white men, I will shoot you dead.  Do you accept?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I said, scrambling to my feet, and ruefully testing my
shaky legs.  'But if you want me to get to Machudi's you must
go slowly, for I am nearly foundered.'</p>

<p>Then he brought out a Bible, and made me swear on it that I would
do as I promised.</p>

<p>'Swear to me in turn,' I said, 'that you will give me my life
if I restore the jewels.'</p>

<p>He swore, kissing the book like a witness in a police-court. 
I had forgotten that the man called himself a Christian.</p>

<p>'One thing more I ask,' I said.  'I want my dog decently buried.'
'That has been already done,' was the reply.  'He was a brave
animal, and my people honour bravery.'</p>
