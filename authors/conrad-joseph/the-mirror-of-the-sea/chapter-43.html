<p> Anyway, he was perfect, as Doña Rita had declared.  The only
thing unsatisfactory (and even inexplicable) about our Dominic
was his nephew, Cesar.  It was startling to see a desolate expression
of shame veil the remorseless audacity in the eyes of that man
superior to all scruples and terrors.</p>

<p>"I would never have dared to bring him on board your balancelle,"
he once apologized to me.  "But what am I to do?  His mother is
dead, and my brother has gone into the bush."</p>

<p>In this way I learned that our Dominic had a brother.  As to
"going into the bush," this only means that a man has done his
duty successfully in the pursuit of a hereditary vendetta.  The
feud which had existed for ages between the families of Cervoni
and Brunaschi was so old that it seemed to have smouldered out
at last.  One evening Pietro Brunaschi, after a laborious day
amongst his olive-trees, sat on a chair against the wall of his
house with a bowl of broth on his knees and a piece of bread in
his hand.  Dominic’s brother, going home with a gun on his shoulder,
found a sudden offence in this picture of content and rest so
obviously calculated to awaken the feelings of hatred and revenge. 
He and Pietro had never had any personal quarrel; but, as Dominic
explained, "all our dead cried out to him."  He shouted from behind
a wall of stones, "O Pietro!  Behold what is coming!"  And as
the other looked up innocently he took aim at the forehead and
squared the old vendetta account so neatly that, according to
Dominic, the dead man continued to sit with the bowl of broth
on his knees and the piece of bread in his hand.</p>

<p>This is why—because in Corsica your dead will not leave you alone—Dominic’s
brother had to go into the <em>maquis</em>, into the bush on the
wild mountain-side, to dodge the gendarmes for the insignificant
remainder of his life, and Dominic had charge of his nephew with
a mission to make a man of him.</p>

<p>No more unpromising undertaking could be imagined.  The very
material for the task seemed wanting.  The Cervonis, if not handsome
men, were good sturdy flesh and blood.  But this extraordinarily
lean and livid youth seemed to have no more blood in him than
a snail.</p>

<p>"Some cursed witch must have stolen my brother’s child from the
cradle and put that spawn of a starved devil in its place," Dominic
would say to me.  "Look at him!  Just look at him!"</p>

<p>To look at Cesar was not pleasant.  His parchment skin, showing
dead white on his cranium through the thin wisps of dirty brown
hair, seemed to be glued directly and tightly upon his big bones,
Without being in any way deformed, he was the nearest approach
which I have ever seen or could imagine to what is commonly understood
by the word "monster."  That the source of the effect produced
was really moral I have no doubt.  An utterly, hopelessly depraved
nature was expressed in physical terms, that taken each separately
had nothing positively startling.  You imagined him clammily cold
to the touch, like a snake.  The slightest reproof, the most mild
and justifiable remonstrance, would be met by a resentful glare
and an evil shrinking of his thin dry upper lip, a snarl of hate
to which he generally added the agreeable sound of grinding teeth.</p>

<p>It was for this venomous performance rather than for his lies,
impudence, and laziness that his uncle used to knock him down. 
It must not be imagined that it was anything in the nature of
a brutal assault. Dominic’s brawny arm would be seen describing
deliberately an ample horizontal gesture, a dignified sweep, and
Cesar would go over suddenly like a ninepin—which was funny to
see.  But, once down, he would writhe on the deck, gnashing his
teeth in impotent rage—which was pretty horrible to behold.  And
it also happened more than once that he would disappear completely—which
was startling to observe.  This is the exact truth.  Before some
of these majestic cuffs Cesar would go down and vanish.  He would
vanish heels overhead into open hatchways, into scuttles, behind
up-ended casks, according to the place where he happened to come
into contact with his uncle’s mighty arm.</p>

<p>Once—it was in the old harbour, just before the <em>Tremolino’s</em>
last voyage—he vanished thus overboard to my infinite consternation. 
Dominic and I had been talking business together aft, and Cesar
had sneaked up behind us to listen, for, amongst his other perfections,
he was a consummate eavesdropper and spy.  At the sound of the
heavy plop alongside horror held me rooted to the spot; but Dominic
stepped quietly to the rail and leaned over, waiting for his nephew’s
miserable head to bob up for the first time.</p>

<p>"Ohé, Cesar!" he yelled contemptuously to the spluttering wretch. 
"Catch hold of that mooring hawser—<em>charogne</em>!"</p>

<p>He approached me to resume the interrupted conversation.</p>

<p>"What about Cesar?" I asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Canallia!  Let him hang there," was his answer.  And he went
on talking over the business in hand calmly, while I tried vainly
to dismiss from my mind the picture of Cesar steeped to the chin
in the water of the old harbour, a decoction of centuries of marine
refuse.  I tried to dismiss it, because the mere notion of that
liquid made me feel very sick. Presently Dominic, hailing an idle
boatman, directed him to go and fish his nephew out; and by-and-by
Cesar appeared walking on board from the quay, shivering, streaming
with filthy water, with bits of rotten straws in his hair and
a piece of dirty orange-peel stranded on his shoulder. His teeth
chattered; his yellow eyes squinted balefully at us as he passed
forward.  I thought it my duty to remonstrate.</p>

<p>"Why are you always knocking him about, Dominic?" I asked.  Indeed,
I felt convinced it was no earthly good—a sheer waste of muscular
force.</p>

<p>"I must try to make a man of him," Dominic answered hopelessly.</p>

<p>I restrained the obvious retort that in this way he ran the risk
of making, in the words of the immortal Mr. Mantalini, "a demnition
damp, unpleasant corpse of him."</p>

<p>"He wants to be a locksmith!" burst out Cervoni.  "To learn how
to pick locks, I suppose," he added with sardonic bitterness.</p>

<p>"Why not let him be a locksmith?" I ventured.</p>

<p>"Who would teach him?" he cried.  "Where could I leave him?"
he asked, with a drop in his voice; and I had my first glimpse
of genuine despair. "He steals, you know, alas!  <em>Par ta Madonne</em>! 
I believe he would put poison in your food and mine—the viper!"</p>

<p>He raised his face and both his clenched fists slowly to heaven.
However, Cesar never dropped poison into our cups.  One cannot
be sure, but I fancy he went to work in another way.</p>

<p>This voyage, of which the details need not be given, we had to
range far afield for sufficient reasons.  Coming up from the South
to end it with the important and really dangerous part of the
scheme in hand, we found it necessary to look into Barcelona for
certain definite information. This appears like running one’s
head into the very jaws of the lion, but in reality it was not
so.  We had one or two high, influential friends there, and many
others humble but valuable because bought for good hard cash. 
We were in no danger of being molested; indeed, the important
information reached us promptly by the hands of a Custom-house
officer, who came on board full of showy zeal to poke an iron
rod into the layer of oranges which made the visible part of our
cargo in the hatchway.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention before that the <em>Tremolino</em> was officially
known as a fruit and cork-wood trader.  The zealous officer managed
to slip a useful piece of paper into Dominic’s hand as he went
ashore, and a few hours afterwards, being off duty, he returned
on board again athirst for drinks and gratitude.  He got both
as a matter of course.  While he sat sipping his liqueur in the
tiny cabin, Dominic plied him with questions as to the whereabouts
of the guardacostas.  The preventive service afloat was really
the one for us to reckon with, and it was material for our success
and safety to know the exact position of the patrol craft in the
neighbourhood.  The news could not have been more favourable. 
The officer mentioned a small place on the coast some twelve miles
off, where, unsuspicious and unready, she was lying at anchor,
with her sails unbent, painting yards and scraping spars.  Then
he left us after the usual compliments, smirking reassurringly
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>I had kept below pretty close all day from excess of prudence. 
The stake played on that trip was big.</p>

<p>"We are ready to go at once, but for Cesar, who has been missing
ever since breakfast," announced Dominic to me in his slow, grim
way.</p>

<p>Where the fellow had gone, and why, we could not imagine.  The
usual surmises in the case of a missing seaman did not apply to
Cesar’s absence.  He was too odious for love, friendship, gambling,
or even casual intercourse.  But once or twice he had wandered
away like this before.</p>

<p>Dominic went ashore to look for him, but returned at the end
of two hours alone and very angry, as I could see by the token
of the invisible smile under his moustache being intensified. 
We wondered what had become of the wretch, and made a hurried
investigation amongst our portable property.  He had stolen nothing.</p>

<p>"He will be back before long," I said confidently.</p>

<p>Ten minutes afterwards one of the men on deck called out loudly:</p>

<p>"I can see him coming."</p>

<p>Cesar had only his shirt and trousers on.  He had sold his coat,
apparently for pocket-money.</p>

<p>"You knave!" was all Dominic said, with a terrible softness of
voice.  He restrained his choler for a time.  "Where have you
been, vagabond?" he asked menacingly.</p>

<p>Nothing would induce Cesar to answer that question.  It was as
if he even disdained to lie.  He faced us, drawing back his lips
and gnashing his teeth, and did not shrink an inch before the
sweep of Dominic’s arm.  He went down as if shot, of course. 
But this time I noticed that, when picking himself up, he remained
longer than usual on all fours, baring his big teeth over his
shoulder and glaring upwards at his uncle with a new sort of hate
in his round, yellow eyes.  That permanent sentiment seemed pointed
at that moment by especial malice and curiosity.  I became quite
interested.  If he ever manages to put poison in the dishes, I
thought to myself, this is how he will look at us as we sit at
our meal. But I did not, of course, believe for a moment that
he would ever put poison in our food.  He ate the same things
himself.  Moreover, he had no poison.  And I could not imagine
a human being so blinded by cupidity as to sell poison to such
an atrocious creature.</p>
