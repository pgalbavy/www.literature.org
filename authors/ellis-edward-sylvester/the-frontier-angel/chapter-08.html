<p><em>DINGLE </em>waited in the wood until morning, searching and
signaling for Jenkins, but without success. He hoped at first
that he had made his escape; but he was compelled, after carefully
watching the village for a long time, to the belief that he had
been captured. In fact, it was a certainty with the ranger. He
understood the actions of the Shawnees well enough to be satisfied
upon that point.</p>

<p>"Now, Dingle, what's to be done?" queried the ranger meditatively.
"He's in their claws&mdash;that's a sure case, and it don't look right
for you to leave him thar. But jest hold on a minute. The great
moral question is this: which ar' to be saved&mdash;him or the whole
settlements? Ef I stay h'yer, pokin' round for him, like as not,
I'll get cotched myself&mdash;no, I won't either, for Dick Dingle don't
get that thing done to him. The reds ar' goin' on a ha'r raise,
that's sure; and they'll leave Jenkins till they come back afore
they roast him. Consequently, he'll have time to look round and
git acquainted with his friends, and p'r'aps make a bargain to
let him off on a visit. No, Dingle, you must make tracks fur home
powerful fast."</p>

<p>This decision arrived at, the ranger lost no time in putting
it into execution. He knew he could not get much start of his
enemies; and, although they would be armed at the settlement,
yet it was imperatively necessary they should have more definite
knowledge of the intended assault. Slinging his rifle over his
shoulder, he turned his face to the south and plunged into the
forest.</p>

<p>In the meantime Peter Jenkins <em>had</em> managed to fall into
an unpleasant predicament.</p>

<p>Upon the departure of Dingle, he made up his mind to obey every
letter of his instructions. Accordingly, he squeezed himself into
the smallest space possible, and curled obediently up on the ground.
He lay thus perhaps a half-hour, when he fell sound asleep. This
was unintentional on his part; but the fatigue of the expedition,
and the time he had passed, without slumber, were too much for
him, and he finally succumbed.</p>

<p>He would have slept, in all probability, until the return of
Dingle, had it not been for a purely accidental circumstance.
As his slumbers grew more heavy, he gave two or three jerks, and
finally straightened out upon his back. In doing this, he naturally
threw his hands backward, and by the merest accident in the world,
struck a toad that sat blinking a foot or two distant. The creature
made a startled leap and plumped down square in his face, but
immediately sprang off again. It, however, seemed to awaken Jenkins,
who rose to the sitting position, and entirely unmindful of where
he was, commenced talking, in a mumbling tone, to himself.</p>

<p>"Like to know who that feller was that hit me in the face. Liked
to knocked me out of bed; s'pose it was Dingle, though&mdash;just like
him&mdash;makes my nose feel awful cold. Queer a feller can't sleep
when he wants to&mdash;all-fired mean to 'sturb a person that way.
Lay over on your own side, Dick. Hello! he ain't here! Look at
these bushes! &mdash;Thunderation! where am I?"</p>

<p>He stared bewilderingly about him. Gradually a recollection of
his situation came to him. And then he was filled with apprehension
lest he had betrayed himself. He listened carefully for a few
minutes, but hearing nothing, judged that matters were all right;
and, as he was excessively sleepy, he dropped languidly back again,
and was falling rapidly into a state of unconsciousness, when
he was waked again.</p>

<p>The fact was he had been overheard by a couple of brawny Shawnees
who, at that moment, were passing within a few feet of him. They
dropped noiselessly to the earth, and commenced making their way
toward him, as he fell back so unconsciously.</p>

<p>In the meantime, one of those little, active, prying dogs, that
are always bobbing around an Indian village, made the same discovery.
He ran fearlessly up to the prostrate man, poked his cold nose
against his cheek, and gave a loud bark that electrized Jenkins
completely. Remembering the parting admonition of Dingle, to "fire
and run," in case of discovery, he seized his gun, blazed away
at the dog, and turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Even then he might have effected his escape, had it not been
for the dog mentioned. The Indians suspecting he was a scout,
were taken all aback by the unexpected manner in which he acted,
and hesitated so long before following, that, as we said, he might
have escaped, had it not been for the dog. The creature was unhurt
by his shot, and with a yelp of alarm, sprang in front of him.
Jenkins was too confused to notice him, the dog got entangled
between his legs, and he pitched headlong to the ground. Before
he could rise the Indians were upon him, and yelling with exultation.</p>

<p>  [Illustration: "Before he could rise the Indians were upon
him."]</p>

<p>"We kill&mdash;if fight&mdash;no run," muttered one in broken English.</p>

<p>"Jerusalem! I won't run&mdash;don't kill me. I won't run at least
with you two fellers on my back. Don't kill me!"</p>

<p>"Stand up&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will&mdash;don't kill me!"</p>

<p>One of the savages had already secured his rifle; and, as he
arose, one stood on either side of him and took a firm hold of
his arms. By this time there were a score of other savages around,
all dancing, shouting, and yelling; and in the midst of them our
friend Jenkins was marched into the center of the Indian village.</p>

<p>Immediately a score of Shawnees scattered into the wood, to ascertain
whether there were any more whites lurking in the vicinity, while
Jenkins was hurried into a lodge, thrown upon his face, his hands
tied securely behind him, and his feet locked as tightly together,
as if they had been screwed in a vice.</p>

<p>"Consarn it! what's the use in serving a feller that way? I told
you I wouldn't run away, and you shouldn't doubt my word."</p>

<p>Some eight or nine remained to guard, but no one seemed disposed
to heed his request.</p>

<p>"You ugly old heathen, standing there by the door, grinning at
me, just loosen these cords, will you?" said Jenkins. The Indian,
still paying no attention to his entreaties. Jenkins supposed
he did not understand the English language; and he repeated his
request in a louder tone, as though that would assist his understanding.
But with no better effect. "I don't want the cords loosened&mdash;wouldn't
have them untied if you wanted to do it," he added, sullenly.</p>

<p>As his captors still evinced no desire to do anything more than
watch him, he resigned himself sullenly to his fate, and ceased
speaking.</p>

<p>The night wore slowly away without any noticeable change taking
place in his condition. Sleep, under the existing circumstances,
was out of the question, and Jenkins contented himself&mdash;if the
expression is allowable&mdash;with maintaining a moody silence, varied
now and then by a gratuitous insult to those around, which, luckily
for him, they failed to comprehend.</p>

<p>While this sleepless guard was being kept upon our unfortunate
friend, there was another tribunal, as sleepless and vastly more
important to him. In the chieftain's lodge was assembled half
a hundred warriors, debating the matter of life or death. It could
be hardly said there was a debate upon that either; for all agreed
that their victim should die&mdash;agreed that he should not only die,
but <em>be burned at the stake</em>!</p>

<p>They were considering only <em>when</em> this should be done.
It could not be expected there would be a single dissenting voice
as to his fate, and there was none. But the question was whether
the war-expedition should be deferred by consummating the torture,
or whether it should be left over until they returned. It was
their intention to start upon the morrow for the settlement which
we have so often referred to; and rightly fearing that every hour
of delay was a day's gain to their intended victims, it was at
last decided that Jenkins should be kept until their return, when
he should suffer the awful torture of death by fire. They knew
their passions would be inflamed to that pitch that the agonies
of their prisoner's torment would be the most exquisite pleasure
they could enjoy.</p>

<p>Most fortunate, indeed, for Jenkins was it that the renegade
was not present at that council. Had he been, he never would have
seen the light of another morning; for he had learned long before
that no white prisoner was sure to them until he had been a victim
to their vengeance. The renegade had left only a day or two before
for the Indian towns in the Sciota valley, and consequently knew
nothing of Jenkins' capture.</p>

<p>When the morning dawned, there was great commotion throughout
the village. The final preparations were made for the departure
of the war-party.</p>

<p>Jenkins heard the confusion and clamor around him, but he was
in no mood to care what they were doing. A sort of stolid indifference
had succeeded to the excessive fear he had at first evinced.</p>

<p>"Darnation! I don't care what they do! They can burn me and eat
me, if they want to! Let 'em blaze away!"</p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak, the war-party departed. About a dozen
men remained behind to guard the village, and see that no attempt
was made to free the prisoner, while a whole host of squaws and
children raised bedlam. The lodge in which Jenkins was confined
was completely beset by them. At first his guards allowed them
to rush in and torment him in their characteristic manner&mdash;such
as pulling his hair, pinching, and striking him with sticks. Finally
his patience became exhausted.</p>

<p>"By thunder! if you don't take these things off I'll kill every
one of them!" he exclaimed, furiously wriggling and tugging at
his bonds.</p>

<p>The Indians enjoyed the sport hugely, especially the impotent
wrath he displayed. They made no attempt to restrain the excited
multitude, until they became so numerous and boisterous, that
for their own convenience, they cleared the lodge of the tormentors.</p>

<p>"You'd better done that just then," said the prisoner. "I was
just getting ready to knock some of their brains out."</p>

<p>At noon he was given some meat and drink, and he ate ravenously,
for his situation seemed to have little effect upon his appetite.
His usual fear and subsequent indifference had now given way to
a perfect recklessness. Goaded to madness, he cared not a straw
what he did. He swore within himself that he would make his escape
before morning, though how to effect it wasn't plain even to himself.</p>

<p>His guard maintained their sullen watch until dark, when the
clamorous crowd again commenced pressing around. They were restrained
from entering, but they continued yelling and pressing against
the lodge till, all at once, the side gave way, and fell inward.
Those pressing against it were so numerous that they poured irresistibly
forward, piling in a mass upon Jenkins, kicking and struggling
to free themselves, and making the confusion perfectly horrid
by their yells. To make the matter still worse, the sudden incoming
of the multitude had extinguished the burning torches, so that
all was in total darkness.</p>

<p>Jenkins, feeling the mass upon him, became doubly enraged and
made furious efforts to free himself. But the cords were too firm,
and he finally gave up in despair.</p>

<p>Immediately he felt some one fingering around him; and to his
inexpressible astonishment found the cords at his feet and hands
cut, and he was now perfectly free. He lost no time in taking
advantage of this providential intercourse of some one. Springing
to his feet, he turned to make a dash through the open side of
the lodge. At that moment a soft hand touched his, and some one,
pulling his head downward, whispered eagerly in his ear:</p>

<p>"Don't stop! run as fast as you can!"</p>

<p>"You may bet I'll do that," he replied, although he scarcely
heard his own voice in the deafening uproar around him.</p>

<p>Of course, in the darkness, it was impossible to distinguish
the prisoner. When the building crashed inward, two or three savages
hurried off for torches, while several more sprang to the opening
to intercept his flight, should he attempt it. As they knew his
bonds were too firm to be broken, they had little fear of this,
but adopted these precautions in obedience to their cautious instincts.
But Jenkins avoided them all. He made a spring outward, a literal
"leap in the dark," ran a short distance in a straight line, until,
as might be expected, he brought up all standing against a lodge
that happened to be in his way. There were none inside, for the
tumult in the village had drawn them out, and he suffered no injury,
except a few scratches. Without stopping to ascertain the damages,
he made an abrupt turn to the left, and hurrying onward, found
himself, in a few seconds, clear of the town and in the dark wood.</p>

<p>The lights were soon recovered and brought to the lodge from
which he had fled. Held in the entrance, they revealed a swarm
of dark, struggling bodies, piled pell-mell upon each other. Under
the light of the smoking-torches, these regained their feet in
an incredible short space of time. Then to the unutterable astonishment
of the Shawnees, it was found that the prisoner had escaped.</p>

<p>The Indians stood completely dumbfounded for a moment, totally
unable to realize that such was the case. But a Shawnee Indian
rarely gives way to his emotions, and when he does, it does not
last long. A long, wild, lengthened howl conveyed the dismal intelligence
that the white man had fled to the woods.</p>

<p>Now the pursuit and search commenced. Lights were gleaming and
flitting through the trees, like frantic fire-flies, and the eager
savages were darting and yelling in every direction. Signals were
given and returned, and all imaginable artifices adopted.</p>

<p>But a pursuit, under such disadvantages, could hardly be expected
to be successful. And it did not prove so in this case. Jenkins
knew well how to use his legs, especially when his life depended
upon them; and the manner in which he flew through the forest
would have made an ordinary Indian despair at once. He had nearly
the entire night before him, and he hardly halted for breathing
time until morning. The moon arose toward midnight, and so lit
up the wood that it would have been exceedingly dangerous for
him had his pursuers been anywhere in the vicinity. But they were
not, and he had it all to himself.</p>

<p>At morning he was so exhausted that he threw himself upon the
ground, at the roots of a fallen tree, and slept heavily. Slept
until near the middle of the afternoon, and then he would not
have awakened, had not a visitor helped him to recall his wits.
He opened his eyes and started with unbounded astonishment at
seeing before him that mysterious being known as the Frontier
Angel. She stood a few feet away, surveying him with a look of
mild joy, and holding in her right hand a rifle which he instantly
recognized as his own.</p>

<p>"So you made your escape, did you?" she remarked, seeing that
he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Hello! how are you? Glad to see you. How's your folks? Been
well?" asked Jenkins, suddenly thinking he had been remiss in
his usual politeness. These questions were accompanied by a profound
bow and scrape of his foot upon the earth.</p>

<p>The being before him paid no heed to these demonstrations, but
repeated her remark:</p>

<p>"So you made your escape, did you?"</p>

<p>"Very well, I thank you, how's your health?"</p>

<p>"You have escaped, I say?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, a pleasant day."</p>

<p>The personage paused and looked at him in astonishment. The truth
of the matter was, Jenkins was so confused that he did not comprehend
a single remark made by her. He continued bowing and scraping
and speaking incoherently until, at last, his senses returned.
The Frontier Angel merely gazed at him with a wondering expression,
in which not a particle of mirth could be seen. Waiting a few
moments, she once more repeated her remark.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you spoke of escape, did you? Yes, I managed to get away
<em>myself</em>."</p>

<p>"Were you not bound?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; with tremendous big cords."</p>

<p>"How did you free yourself of them?"</p>

<p>"Broke them all by my giant strength, ma'm," he replied, valiantly.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! was it you that cut them when we was in the muss?" he asked,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I cut them and admonished you to fly. You should not take the
credit yourself," mildly replied the visitor.</p>

<p>"I didn't know as you done it, or I wouldn't said so," said Jenkins,
somewhat crestfallen at being so caught.</p>

<p>"How came you to be captured?" she continued, standing in front
of him, and keeping her dark eyes fixed upon him.</p>

<p>"Overpowered by main force! I'd like to see the man that could
withstand forty-three Shawnee Indians."</p>

<p>"Were there that many who assailed you?"</p>

<p>"Well, I couldn't say positively now&mdash;perhaps more or less. To
speak within bounds, we'll call it forty-two."</p>

<p>"And where is he who was with you?"</p>

<p>"Who? &mdash;Dick Dingle? He wouldn't stay and fight, but run
and left me behind to meet all the danger."</p>

<p>"You were scouts, then, sent to reconnoiter the Indians, I suppose.
In doing so, you were captured by your enemies, while your companion
escaped. But, thanks to the great Ruler above, you were also delivered
from death. Your friend, from what I know of him, leads me to
the belief that he gained enough knowledge of the Indians to answer
all purposes. And he will be able to give all information to the
settlements which I was unable to give."</p>

<p>"S'pect so. Leastways I know, when I get home, I'll be able to
give our settlement a great deal of information that they never
knowed or dreamt on before."</p>

<p>"I have followed your trail, my friend, to come up with you and
find out what I have just learned. I rejoice to learn that it
has turned out thus. And now I will bid you good-by. Do not delay,
for, although you are a great way from the Indian town, there
may be many and swift pursuers upon your trail."</p>

<p>"Say! hold on a minute!" called out Jenkins, springing toward
her, first reaching out his hand, and then suddenly withdrawing
it, as he remembered what he had heard said would be the consequences
of such an act.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" she asked, turning round and facing him.</p>

<p>Now, the truth of the matter was, Jenkins had fallen desperately
in love with this singular personage. And, all things considered,
it could not be wondered at. Arrayed in her fantastic Indian dress,
her beauty was certainly wild and wonderful. Gay, painted eagle
and porcupine quills formed a fiery head-dress, which contrasted
well with the long, luxuriant hair of jetty blackness, that rolled
unrestrained down her shoulders. The face was small and a delicate
oval, the eyelashes long and black, the nose thin and small, and
the teeth of pearly pureness. Viewed from the side, the profile
was perfectly straight from the upper part of the forehead to
the base of the nose, from which point it slightly retreated to
the chin. The eyes were dark, and when fixed upon a person, wore
a meek, mild expression; at other times they fairly blazed with
fire. A dress of dazzling colors reached from the shoulders to
the ankles, and was confined at the waist by a band of gleaming
red. The feet were encased in small, ornamented moccasins which
displayed the symmetrical limbs to advantage. Several rows of
wampum were hung around the neck and waist, and the whole dress
was such as an Indian chief would put upon his princess.</p>

<p>When she turned so abruptly and faced Jenkins, he was considerably
disconcerted. Upon any other occasion, he would have hesitated
and stammered much, before he would have come to the point; but,
he well knew there were but a few minutes left him, and he said:</p>

<p>"I just want to speak a word with you. I s'pose you know Dick
Dingle, don't you? that feller that left me so cowardly?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied, without changing a feature or removing her
gaze from him.</p>

<p>"Well, I was just going to say&mdash;that is &mdash;I wouldn't have
anything to do with him. He is an awful mean man; I wouldn't speak
to him."</p>

<p>"Why?" was the same quiet question.</p>

<p>"Oh! 'cause he's so everlastingly mean. Darnation! haven't I
told you a thousand times? How many more times are you going to
ask me?"</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;no&mdash;hold on!"</p>

<p>"What else do you wish?"</p>

<p>"I want to know if&mdash;if&mdash;if you don't like him, do you now?" suddenly
broke forth Jenkins.</p>

<p>The maiden began acting strangely. Her eyes brightened, her lips
quivered, and she seemed striving to say something. She controlled
her emotion in a moment, and sweeping her hand over her eyes,
looked calmly at her questioner, but without deigning a reply.</p>

<p>"Don't you&mdash;don't you&mdash;don't you <em>love me now</em>? I do you!"
besought our friend, going down on his knees in true, sentimental
style.</p>

<p>The Frontier Angel gazed calmly on him a moment, then raised
her eyes, turned on her heel, and disappeared in the forest.</p>
