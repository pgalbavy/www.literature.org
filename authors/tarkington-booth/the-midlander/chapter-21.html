<p><em>DAN </em>did not go next day to bid the returned neighbour
welcome home—he thought it better to postpone the call of greeting
he should have made at once. He knew he should have made it, if
even out of no more than mere neighbourliness; but gradually it
became postponed into the indefiniteness that means never, a postponement
not without parallel when old friends of husbands return. Meanwhile,
Martha was not again mentioned by either Lena or her husband;
though this is only to say that she was not orally mentioned between
them, but continued to be the subject of their silences. Dan did
not dare to go to see her; and his own silence, when he was with
his wife, was doggedly protestive, while Lena’s was inscrutable,
though she sometimes gave him evidences of a faintly amused contempt.
She permitted him to perceive that she despised him, but not to
understand whether she despised him because he wanted to see Martha
or because he was afraid to do what he wanted.</p>

<p>Once or twice, when he came from his long day’s work, he caught
a glimpse of a white figure in the twilight of the Shelbys’ veranda,
and waved his hat, and thought a hand waved to him in return;
but weeks passed and limp midsummer was almost upon the town before
he had speech again with the slighted lady, though the slight
was always upon his conscience.</p>

<p>Upon a hot Sunday noon, when his father and mother returned from
church, he took them to see the "carpenter shop" he had spent
the morning making in the old summer-house for young Henry—Henry
Daniel no longer, at the boy’s own vehement request. The grandparents
praised the "carpenter shop" but chided their son for staying
away from church to construct it, and their grandson for missing
Sunday-school. Dan laughed; he had not been to church in a year;
and Henry distorted the cherubic rotundities of his small face
into as much ferocity as he could accomplish. "I hate Sunday-school,"
he declared; and, as his mother joined them just then, he seized
her hand. "I don’t <em>haf</em> to go ’lessen I want to. You’ll
never get <em>me</em> in that ole hole again!"</p>

<p>"My gracious!" Dan laughed. "It isn’t as bad as all that. You
and I <em>might</em> decide to begin goin’ again sometime, Henry."</p>

<p>"I won’t," Henry said stoutly, and as the group moved across
the lawn, returning toward the house, he clung to his mother’s
hand and repeated that he didn’t "haf to." He appealed to Lena
piercingly: "I <em>don’t</em> haf to if I don’t want to, <em>do</em>
I, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," his father assured him. "Of course you don’t. It wouldn’t
do you much good, I expect, if you don’t like it. You needn’t
fret, Henry. I guess you’ll be a good enough boy without Sunday-school."</p>

<p>"I expect so, maybe," Mr. Oliphant agreed, chuckling at his grandson’s
vehemence. "It’s a good thing your grandmother Savage can’t hear
you, though, Dan. I never did know what she really believed; in
fact, I rather suspect she was an agnostic in her heart—but she’d
have been shocked to hear you letting your offspring out of Sunday-school—or
anything else—merely because he doesn’t like it."</p>

<p>"I expect she would, sir," Dan said. "But all that’s changed
since her day. People don’t believe in——" He stopped speaking
and moving simultaneously, and stood staring out at the sidewalk
where his brother and Martha Shelby, walking slowly, were returning
from church.</p>

<p>"People don’t believe in what?" Mr. Oliphant inquired, stopping
also.</p>

<p>"I—I don’t know, sir," Dan said vaguely, and he began to grow
red. Harlan and Martha had turned in at the gate and were coming
across the lawn to them.</p>

<p>Martha went first to Lena. "I haven’t had a chance to say ‘Howdy-do’
to you since I came back," she said easily. "I’m ever so glad
to see you again." Then she turned to Dan, and gave him her hand
with a cordial emphasis of gesture. "It’s fine to see you again,
too, Dan. I want to congratulate you about Ornaby Addition. You’ll
have to look out, though."</p>

<p>"I will?" Dan said and added awkwardly, "Well—well, the—the truth
is, I’m mighty glad to see you. I mean we’re all glad you’re back
home again, Martha." He was visibly in a state of that almost
certain contagion, embarrassment, and so flounderingly that he
was embarrassing. He dropped Martha’s cordial hand almost as soon
as he touched it, and at the same instant turned upon his wife
a look of helpless apprehension that would have revealed everything,
if revelation were needed. But Lena showed herself as little disconcerted
as the steady Martha was; and the look she sent back to her husband
held in it something of the hostile examination that had come
into her eyes on the evening after Martha’s return, though now
it was accompanied by a bright glint almost hilariously jeering.
It was strikingly successful in effect. Dan gulped, then he stammered:
"How—how do you—how do you mean I must look out, Martha?"</p>

<p>She laughed cheerfully. "I mean you must look out for some of
those wicked old men downtown. You tried to get them to come in
with you at the start, but they wouldn’t, and pretty soon they’re
going to be furious that they let the chance slip. They’ll try
to get Ornaby away from you, Dan." She turned to the little boy,
who had been silenced for a moment by the arrival of this stranger.
"I ought to know you," she said. "That’s why I stopped on my way
home: I wanted to meet you. I live next door. Will you shake hands?"</p>

<p>"No," Henry replied, because his momentary shyness had passed
and he felt that this refusal would help to restore the conspicuousness
he had been enjoying as the owner of a new "carpenter shop" and
a rebel against Sunday-school. "I don’t want to. I don’t want
to shake hands."</p>

<p>"Why, Henry dear!" Mrs. Oliphant intervened, touching her grandson
lightly upon the shoulder. "You don’t mean that! This is our dear
friend that lives next door and <em>likes</em> little boys. You
must——"</p>

<p>"I won’t!" Henry shouted. "I don’t care who she likes, I don’t
want to shake hands." He intended no discourtesy; he merely wished
to be distinguished, and in continuance of that desire immediately
doubled himself, placing the top of his head upon the ground.
"I can turn a summerset," he said. "Want to see me do it? Watch
me! Look!"</p>

<p>He failed to accomplish the proposed feat, but at once attempted
it again. "<em>Watch</em> me!" he shouted. "Look at <em>me</em>!
Why don’t you <em>watch</em> me?"</p>

<p>He went on with his attempts, more and more shrilly demanding
the public attention that had wandered from him. Martha had begun
to talk to Mrs. Oliphant; and Lena came close to Harlan for a
moment. "Didn’t leave her accent in Italy!" she murmured in her
little voice; and passed on toward the house, displaying daintily
upon the short grass pretty white slippers that a girl of twelve
might have worn.</p>

<p>Harlan shrugged his shoulders, and his thought was, "Parisian
doll!" as it usually was when his sister-in-law irritated him.
Certainly, if there were a Parisienne present it was Lena and
not the unchanging Martha in her Paris clothes.</p>

<p>The little boy shouted louder and louder, since attention was
still denied him;—he tugged at his father’s coat, wailing shrilly,
"Look at <em>me</em>, papa! Oh, my goodness, can’t you <em>watch</em>
me?"</p>

<p>Meanwhile Martha, beaming down upon Mrs. Oliphant, nevertheless
sent an impersonal glance over that amiable lady’s head to where
the child thus besieged his father, who seemed to be in a temporary
stupor. Dan looked much older, Martha thought, than when she had
gone away; and, though she had not expected him to retain for
ever an unlined face and his fine figure, she felt a little dismay
at finding him settling into what was strikingly like middle-age.
He was older and heavier than he need have been, she thought,
and a stranger might well have guessed Harlan to be ten years
the younger of the two.</p>

<p>Nowhere in Dan, with his broadened, preoccupied, and lined face,
his heavy, careless figure and his middle-aged careless clothes,
could she discover the jolly boy she had known, or the youth she
had danced with in college holidays, or the jaunty young man so
dashingly clad who had come home from New York engaged to be married,
and told her so on a February walk she would always remember.
What was more to her, nowhere in this almost middle-aged man of
business, now beginning to be successful, could she discover signs
of the spirit that once would have brought him instantly to welcome
home an old friend, even if a wife did threaten. Yet he was a
man who would have swept Lena aside if she had attempted to interfere
with his business, Martha thought—and it was not a thought that
made her happier. She moved to depart.</p>

<p>But at this, the insistent Henry, irritated beyond measure by
the general indifference to his acrobatics, flung himself upon
her, pulling fiercely at her dress. "My good_nuss_! Can’t you
<em>watch</em> me? What’s the <em>matter</em> with you? You <em>got</em>
to watch me!"</p>

<p>There was a sound of tearing as he pulled at her;—Mr. Oliphant
sprang to him and removed him, but Martha picked up the lace flounce
partly torn from her skirt, and laughed at the mutilation of her
finery. "No harm at all," she said, as both Mr. and Mrs. Oliphant
began to apologize for Henry; but their apologies and her reassurances
were not distinctly audible; nor were her words of departure as
she turned toward the gate with Harlan. Henry had instantly squirmed
from his grandfather’s grasp and was shriller and louder than
ever.</p>

<p>"<em>Now</em> I guess you’ll watch me!" he shrieked. "Look at
<em>me</em>, gran’pa! Look at <em>me</em>, everybody!" He appealed
also to his mother, who had paused near the front steps and stood
there, laughing. "Look at <em>me</em>, mamma! Watch me, now! I’m
goin’ to turn a summerset!" He charged into his father’s legs,
yelling, "You’re not lookin’ at <em>me</em>, papa! My good_nuss_!
Can’t you <em>watch</em> me?" And he continued to be overwhelmingly
vociferous, but Dan, for the moment, paid no attention.</p>

<p>He was wondering how it had happened that Martha had been so
long at home and he had not taken the few steps—just to next door—to
tell her he was glad she had come back. What if Lena had made
a fuss? It would have been right to go. And there came to him
faintly, faintly, the ghost of a recollection of a starry night
when he and Martha stood not far from where they were now in this
glaring noon. It had strangely seemed to him then that he had
had a gift from her, something made of no earthly stuff, something
enriching and ineffable. He had forgotten it; but now he remembered,
and at the very moment of remembering, it seemed to him that the
gift was gone.</p>

<p>He stared blankly at her as she passed through the open gateway,
holding her torn dress and chatting with Harlan; while against
Dan’s legs the vehement Henry was battering himself and shrieking,
"Look at <em>me</em>, papa! My good_nuss_! <em>Can’t</em> you
look at <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>Dan consented, and when Martha and Harlan entered the Shelbys’
gate, beyond, they saw that the acrobat, still piercingly vociferous,
had collected the attention of all of his audience but one. His
mother still stood near the stone front steps, laughing, not looking
at him; but his grandparents and his father were applauding him.
He was insatiable, however; keeping them in the hot sun while
he performed other athletic feats. "You <em>shan’t</em> go in
the house, gran’ma!" he screamed. "I’m goin’ to hop on one leg
all across the yard. You got to watch me. You <em>watch</em> me,
gran’ma!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Oliphant obediently returned, and the new entertainment
began.</p>

<p>"Isn’t it awful?" Harlan groaned. "Isn’t it dismaying to think
what children are coming to nowadays? I’d hoped you’d let me sit
on the veranda a little while with you, Martha; but I can’t ask
you to stay out in an air made hideous by all this squawking and
squealing."</p>

<p>"Then you might come in with me," she laughed. "Our walls are
pretty thick."</p>

<p>The walls of the big old house were as she said, but open windows
brought the shrill, incessant "Watch me!" indoors, and the annoyed
Harlan complained further of his nephew. "It makes one respect
the Chinese," he said. "They at least pay some attention to ancestors.
Only certain tribes biologically very low worship children, I
understand; but that seems to be our most prevalent American habit
to-day. We’re deliberately making this the age of the abject worship
of children—and I wish my grandmother could have lived to give
her opinion of it!"</p>

<p>"What do you think she’d say, Harlan?"</p>

<p>"Isn’t hard to guess! She’d have said we’re heading the children
straight for perdition. In fact, she thought that about our own
generation; she thought father and mother were heading Dan and
me that way; yet we were under heavy discipline compared to the
way this terrible little Henry’s being brought up. Lena’s family
were severe with her, I understand, and she doesn’t believe in
discipline. As for Dan, he’s always been just the child’s slave."</p>

<p>Martha looked compassionate. "Yes," she said slowly. "I suppose
he had to have something he could worship."</p>

<p>"Well, he’s got Ornaby Addition," Harlan suggested dryly.</p>

<p>"No. He had to have something besides. I think he’d have worshipped
his wife, if she had ever let him, but I suppose she——"</p>

<p>"No," Harlan said, breaking the indefinite pause into which Martha
had absently strayed. "But she’s always capable of being jealous."
And he looked at Martha from the side of his eye.</p>

<p>"Jealous of me?"</p>

<p>"You’ve certainly been made well enough aware of it from the
very day he brought her home, Martha."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she assented cheerfully. "She’s never doubted that
I’ve always cared for Dan, but she knows that he wasn’t in love
with me. She must have always been sure of that, because—well,
here I was—he had only to step over next door and ask me, but
he asked her, instead. And yet, as you say, she disliked me from
the start. She certainly saw I wasn’t the sort to take him away
from her, even if I’d thought I could—and I knew I couldn’t. Yet
it’s true she was jealous. Do you know what I think really made
her so, Harlan? I think almost the principal reason was because
I’m so tall."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do believe it," Martha insisted. "Someone told me she
used to be called ‘French doll’ in New York, and was very sensitive
about it. She wanted to be thought a temperamental and romantic
opera heroine, and would never stand near a tall woman because
she was afraid of being made to look more like a French doll.
I think she couldn’t endure the thought of her husband’s having
a woman friend as big as I am."</p>

<p>"No doubt she’s never wanted to be near you herself," Harlan
said. "But I think her feeling isn’t quite so much on the physical
plane as that."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it was. A man mightn’t understand it, but——"</p>

<p>"A man might, though," he interrupted. "Lena’s always been afraid
that you’re just what she’d call the type of big Western woman
Dan ought to have married in order to be happy."</p>

<p>"What?" Martha cried, but her colour deepened, and there was
agitation in her voice, though she laughed. "Why, what nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" Harlan said, and now agitation became evident in his
own voice, though he controlled it manfully. "It’s what I’ve always
been afraid of, myself."</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, her colour still deepening. "That’s just
nonsense!"</p>

<p>"Is it?" he repeated grimly. "My grandmother Savage didn’t think
so. She cut Dan off with a shilling because she hoped Lena would
leave him and give him a chance to marry you—eventually!"</p>

<p>"Harlan Oliphant! What on earth are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I think you understand me," he said. "Grandmother was a shrewd
old lady, and as good a judge of character as one often sees;
but sometimes she overshot the mark, as most of us do, no doubt,
when we think we understand other people so thoroughly that we
can manipulate their destinies. She thought a good deal that was
true about Lena; but she despised her too much, and made the mistake
of thinking her purely mercenary. That’s why I was the residuary
legatee, Martha."</p>

<p>"Of all the nonsense!" she protested, and continued to protest.
She’d never heard anything so far-fetched in all her life, she
declared—people didn’t put such Machiavellian subtleties into
their wills; and Harlan was a creative romanticist instead of
the critic she’d always believed him to be. But his romancing
wasn’t successful; it was too incredible.</p>

<p>He listened, skeptically marking the difference between the vehemence
of the words she used and the lack of conviction in the voice
that uttered them. "Never mind, Martha," he said at last. "I see
you believe it and agree with me."</p>

<p>"I don’t," she still protested; but her tone was now so feeble
that it only proved her determined never to make the open admission
of what she denied. "It would be too tragic."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"To think of that poor old woman——"</p>

<p>"Yes," he agreed. "I’m afraid it must irritate her now if she
knows."</p>

<p>"To think of her——" Martha said. "Poor thing! I mean it would
be too tragic to think of her hoping and planning such—such preposterousness!"</p>

<p>At this Harlan looked at her so sharply, so gravely, that he
seemed to ask much more than appeared upon the surface of his
question: "But would it be preposterous? Suppose Lena and Dan
should——"</p>

<p>"Separate?" she said, as he stopped at the word. "They never
will."</p>

<p>"But I asked you, if they should?"</p>

<p>Martha shook her head, smiling faintly; and she looked away from
him—far away, it seemed—as she spoke. "People don’t stay ardently
in love forever, Harlan. I don’t suppose anybody stays in love
with anybody—forever. I think I used to believe I’d always be
in love with Dan, and in a way that was true—whatever is left
in me of the girl I used to be will always be in love with the
boy he used to be. But I don’t know where that boy is any more.
Do you understand?"</p>

<p>Harlan looked melancholy, as he nodded. "I suppose so."</p>

<p>"I mean I’m true to my memory of him, perhaps. I’m afraid I don’t
know just what I do mean."</p>

<p>"I’m afraid I do, though," he said. "I’m afraid it’s only that
you’re hurt with him because Lena frightened him into keeping
from even stepping over here for a minute to say, ‘Welcome home.’"</p>

<p>"No; it didn’t hurt—not exactly," she returned. "But he does
seem changed." She frowned. "Do you think he’s lost something,
Harlan? Is it something—something fine about him—that’s lost?
It seems to me—it seems to me there must be. How could anybody
expect a man to go through such a struggle for success as the
one he’s been through and not bear the marks of it? Or maybe is
it only his youthfulness he’s lost?"</p>

<p>"I don’t see anything missing," Harlan replied. "He’s certainly
not lost his optimistic oratory; he can still out-talk any man
in town on the subject of Our Glorious Future. In fact, I think
he’s even more that way than he used to be. Years ago he may have
shown a few very faint traces of having been through a university,
but you could sandpaper him to powder now and not find them: I
don’t believe he could translate the first sentence of Cæsar,
or ‘<em>Arma, virumque cano</em>!’ The only things he ever talks
about are his business and his boy and local politics. I think
that’s all he <em>can</em> talk about."</p>

<p>"Whereas," Martha said, with a flash of the old championing,
"the learned Mr. Harlan Oliphant has only to open his mouth in
order to destroy a lonely woman’s whole joy in the Italian Renaissance."</p>

<p>He lifted his hands, protesting, then dropped them in despair.
"So I’ve lost it already!" he said. "And lost it in the old, old
way!"</p>

<p>"Lost what?"</p>

<p>"Hope," he explained. "You see I’m years and years older than
Freddie Oliphant, and he was complaining to me the other day;—he’s
now considered so much ‘one of the older men’ that some of the
pretty young things one sees at the Country Club were leaving
him out of their festivities. You see where that puts <em>me</em>.
So I hoped that when you came home——"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Well, I hoped that maybe you and I shouldn’t quarrel any more,
and——"</p>

<p>"Quarrel? No; we mustn’t, indeed!" she said. "What else is there
left for left-overs to do but to make the best of each other?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else, I’m afraid."</p>

<p>"And I’d hoped," he went on a little nervously;—"I’d hoped maybe
you’d let me see you a good deal—that you’d let me take you places
and——"</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" Martha cried; and she laughed and blushed. "Haven’t
you just taken me to church? Aren’t you already taking me places,
Harlan?" </p>
