<p>Many diseases of the body are caused by what we take into our
stomachs. You can see, therefore, how important it is that we
should know what and how to eat and drink.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>TEA, COFFEE, MILK, AND CHOCOLATE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If I say that tea, coffee, and chocolate are poisonous, and that
they shorten life, you will smile and shake your head. Very likely
some of you have kind grandmothers who have drunk tea all their
lives and still enjoy good health. Perhaps your father is fond
of his coffee and feels no ill effects from its use.</p>

<p>No doubt it would be better for all if only water was drunk,
but it cannot be said that a temperate use of tea, coffee or chocolate
and what are known as temperance drinks, are injurious. Milk is
a drink of nature, and therefore excellent, though it does not
agree with every person.</p>

<p>
<em>WHEN AND HOW TO DRINK</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If you have formed the habit of drinking while eating, stop it
at once. At first your mouth will be dry and your thirst great,
but persevere and in a short time you will not feel the least
desire to drink until you have finished your meal, when a few
swallows will be all you wish.</p>

<p>Nearly every one drinks too much. If you are thirsty, you fill
a tumbler and drink its contents and sometimes take even more
than that. Now if instead of doing so, you sip the water slowly,
your thirst will be gone before half the water is consumed.</p>

<p>An hour or two after a hearty meal, you may feel a slight degree
of thirst. This is caused by the digestion going on in the stomach.
If you drink, you will soon be thirsty again and will be forced
to drink often through the day; but, if you refrain, at first,
the thirst will soon depart and will not return for hours.</p>

<p>During warm weather, or when perspiring from exercise, you need
more water than at other times. Even if very cold, it will do
no harm, if slowly sipped. Many people learn to like warm water,
which is more healthful than cold.</p>

<p>
<em>LEMONADE, ROOT BEER, SODA WATER, ETC</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Pure soda water, lemonade, root beer and similar drinks are not
hurtful, but the sugar they contain increases our thirst and leads
us to drink more than is good for us. Water is the provision of
nature, and though it has no color, taste or smell, nothing in
the world is so delicious and refreshing.</p>

<p>Very hot and very cold drinks are hurtful, but much of the ill
effects may be averted by sipping them as I have already advised.
Few will believe until they make the test, how little water is
needed through the day. The less we take the more comfortable
will we feel.</p>

<p>  How are many diseases caused? What, therefore, is important?</p>

<p>  What have you to say about tea, coffee, and chocolate?</p>

<p>  What of a temperate use of those and of temperance drinks?
Of milk?</p>

<p>  What have you to say of the habit of drinking while eating?</p>

<p>  What does nearly every one do? What is the best way to drink
water?</p>

<p>  What should be done when slightly thirsty an hour or two after
a   meal?</p>

<p>  When do you need more water than at other times? In what manner
may   very cold water be drunk without harm? What of warm water?</p>

<p>  What is said of soda water, lemonade, etc.? What of water?</p>

<p>  What of very hot and cold drinks? What will be the effect if
we   drink only a small quantity of water? </p>
