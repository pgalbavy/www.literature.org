<p>As Talaskar was preparing their breakfast the following morning
Komodoflorensal remarked to Tarzan that he wished they two could be
employed upon the same work, that they might be always together.
</p>
<p>"If there is ever the chance for escape that you seem to think will
some day present itself," he said, "then it will be well if we are
together."
</p><p>"When we go," replied Tarzan, "we must take Talaskar with us."
</p><p>Komodoflorensal shot a swift glance at the ape-man, but made no comment
upon his suggestion.
</p><p>"You would take me with you!" exclaimed Talaskar. "Ah, if such a dream
could but be realized! I would go with you to Trohanadalmakus and be
your slave, for I know that you would not harm me; but, alas, it can be
nothing more than a pleasant day-dream, enduring for a brief time, for
Kalfastoban has spoken for me and doubtless my master will be glad to
sell me to him, for I have heard it said among the slaves that he sells
many of his each year to raise the money to pay his taxes."
</p><p>"We will do what we can, Talaskar," said Tarzan, "and if Aoponato and
I find a means of escape we will take you with us; but first he and I
must find a way to be together more."
</p><p>"I have a plan," said Komodoflorensal, "that might prove successful.
They believe that you neither speak nor understand our language. To
work a slave with whom they cannot communicate is, to say the least,
annoying. I shall tell them that I can communicate with you, when it is
quite probable that they will assign us to the same crew."
</p><p>"But how will you communicate with me without using the Minunian
language?" demanded the ape-man.
</p><p>"Leave that to me," replied Komodoflorensal. "Until they discover in
some other way that you speak Minunian I can continue to deceive them."
</p><p>It was not long before the fruits of Komodoflorensal's plan ripened.
The guards had come for the slaves and the various parties had gone
forth from the sleeping chamber, joining in the corridors without the
thousands of others wending their way to the scene of their daily
labor. The ape-man joined the timbering crew at the extension of the
thirteenth tunnel at the thirty-sixth level where he once more attacked
the monotonous work of shoring the sides and roof of the shaft with an
enthusiasm that elicited commendation from even the surly Kalfastoban,
though Caraftap, who was removing rocks just ahead of Tarzan, often
shot venomous looks at the ape-man.
</p><p>The work had been progressing for perhaps two or three hours when two
warriors descended the tunnel and halted beside Kalfastoban. They
were escorting a green-tunicked slave, to whom Tarzan paid no more
attention than he did to the warriors until a scrap of the conversation
between the warriors and Kalfastoban reached his ears, then he shot
a quick glance in the direction of the four and saw that the slave
was Komodoflorensal, Prince of Trohanadalmakus, known in the quarries
of Veltopismakus as Slave Aoponato, or 800^3+19, which is written in
Minunian hieroglyphics
</p><p>[Illustration: glyph].
</p><p>Tarzan's number, Aopontando, 800^3+21, appeared thus, upon the shoulder
of his green tunic:
</p><p>[Illustration: glyph].
</p><p>Although the Minunian form occupies less space than would our English
equivalent of Tarzan's number, which is 512,000,021, it would be more
difficult to read if expressed in English words, for it then would
be, ten times ten times eight, cubed, plus seven times three; but the
Minunians translate it in no such way. To them it is a whole number,
Aopontando, which represents at first glance a single quantity as
surely as do the digits 37 represent to our minds an invariable amount,
a certain, definite measure of quantity which we never think of as
three times ten plus seven, which, in reality, it is. The Minunian
system of numerals, while unthinkably cumbersome and awkward from the
European point of view, is, however, not without its merits.
</p>
<p>As Tarzan looked up Komodoflorensal caught his eye and winked and then
Kalfastoban beckoned to the ape-man, who crossed the corridor and stood
in silence before the Vental.
</p><p>"Let us hear you talk to him," cried Kalfastoban to Komodoflorensal. "I
don't believe that he will understand you. How could he when he cannot
understand us?" The fellow could not conceive of another language than
his own.
</p><p>"I will ask him in his own language," said Komodoflorensal, "if he
understands me, and you will see that he nods his head affirmatively."
</p><p>"Very good," cried Kalfastoban; "ask him."
</p><p>Komodoflorensal turned toward Tarzan and voiced a dozen syllables of
incomprehensible gibberish and when he was done the ape-man nodded his
head.
</p><p>"You see?" demanded Komodoflorensal.
</p><p>Kalfastoban scratched his head. "It is even as he says," he admitted,
ruefully, "the Zertalacolol has a language."
</p><p>Tarzan did not smile, though he should have liked to, at the clever
manner in which Komodoflorensal had deceived the Veltopismakusians into
believing that he had communicated with Tarzan in a strange language.
As long as he could contrive to put all his communications into
questions that could be answered by yes or no, the deception would be
easily maintained; but under circumstances that made this impossible
some embarrassments might be expected to arise, and he wondered how the
resourceful Trohanadalmakusian would handle these.
</p><p>"Tell him," said one of the warriors to Komodoflorensal, "that his
master, Zoanthrohago, has sent for him, and ask him if he fully
understands that he is a slave and that upon his good behavior depends
his comfort; yes, even his life, for Zoanthrohago has the power of life
and death over him; as much so as have the royal family. If he comes
docilely to his master and is obedient he will not fare ill, but if he
be lazy, impudent, or threatening he may expect to taste the point of a
freeman's sword."
</p><p>Komodoflorensal strung out, this time, a much longer series of
senseless syllables, until he could scarce compose his features to
comport with the seriousness of his mien.
</p><p>"Tell them," said Tarzan, in English, which, of course, not one of them
understood, "that at the first opportunity I shall break the neck of my
master; that it would require but little incentive to cause me to seize
one of these timbers and crack the skull of Kalfastoban and the rest of
the warriors about us; and I shall run away at the first opportunity
and take you and Talaskar with me."
</p><p>Komodoflorensal listened intently until Tarzan had ceased speaking
and then turned to the two warriors who had come with him to find the
ape-man.
</p><p>"Zuanthrol says that he fully understands his position and that he is
glad to serve the noble and illustrious Zoanthrohago, from whom he
claims but a single boon," translated the Trohanadalmakusian prince,
rather freely.
</p><p>"And what boon is that?" demanded one of the warriors.
</p><p>"That I be permitted to accompany him that he may thus better fulfil
the wishes of his master, since without me he could not even know what
was desired of him," explained Aoponato.
</p><p>Tarzan understood now how Komodoflorensal would surmount whatever
difficulties of communication might arise and he felt that he would be
safe in the hands of his quick-witted friend for as long a time as he
cared to pretend ignorance of the Minunian tongue.
</p><p>"The thought was even in our minds, slave, when we heard that you could
communicate with this fellow," said the warrior to whom Komodoflorensal
had addressed the suggestion. "You shall both be taken to Zoanthrohago,
who will doubtless decide his wishes without consulting you or any
other slave. Come! Kalfastoban Vental, we assume responsibility for
the Slave Zuanthrol," and they handed the Vental a slip of paper upon
which they had marked some curious hieroglyphics.
</p><p>Then, with swords drawn, they motioned Komodoflorensal and Tarzan to
precede them along the corridor, for the story of Tarzan's handling of
Caraftap had reached even to the guard room of the quarry, and these
warriors were taking no chances.
</p><p>The way led through a straight corridor and up a winding spiral runway
to the surface, where Tarzan greeted the sunlight and the fresh air
almost with a sob of gratitude, for to be shut away from them for even
a brief day was to the ape-man cruel punishment, indeed. Here he saw
again the vast, endless multitude of slaves bearing their heavy burdens
to and fro, the trim warriors who paced haughtily upon either flank
of the long lines of toiling serfs, the richly trapped nobles of the
higher castes and the innumerable white-tunicked slaves who darted
hither and thither upon the errands of their masters, or upon their
own business or pleasure, for many of these had a certain freedom and
independence that gave them almost the standing of freedmen. Always
were these slaves of the white tunic owned by a master, but, especially
in the case of skilled artisans, about the only allegiance they owed to
this master was to pay to him a certain percentage of their incomes.
They constituted the bourgeoisie of Minuni and also the higher caste
serving class. Unlike the green-tunicked slaves, no guard was placed
over them to prevent their escape, since there was no danger that they
would attempt to escape, there being no city in Minuni where their
estate would be improved, for any other city than that of their birth
would treat them as alien prisoners, reducing them immediately to the
green tunic and life-long hard labor.
</p><p>The domes of Veltopismakus were as imposing as those of
Trohanadalmakus. In fact, to Tarzan, they appeared infinitely larger
since he now was one-fourth the size he had been when he had left
Trohanadalmakus. There were eight of them fully occupied and another
in course of construction, for the surface population of Veltopismakus
was already four hundred and eighty thousand souls, and as overcrowding
was not permitted in the king's dome the remaining seven were packed
densely with humanity.
</p><p>It was to the royal dome that Tarzan and Komodoflorensal were
conducted, but they did not enter by way of the King's Corridor, before
the gates of which fluttered the white and gold of the royal standards.
Instead they were escorted to the Warriors' Corridor, which opens
toward the west. Unlike the city of Trohanadalmakus, Veltopismakus was
beautiful in the areas between the domes with flowers and shrubbery and
trees, among which wound graveled walks and broad roadways. The royal
dome faced upon a large parade where a body of mounted warriors was
at drill. There were a thousand of them, forming an amak, consisting
of four novands of two hundred fifty men each, the larger body being
commanded by a kamak and the smaller by an novand. Five entex of
fifty men each compose an novand, there being five entals of ten men
each to an entex; these latter units commanded by a vental and a
ventex, respectively. The evolutions of the amak were performed with
kaleidoscopic rapidity, so quick upon their feet and so well trained
were the tiny diadets. There was one evolution in particular, performed
while he was passing, that greatly interested the ape-man. Two novands
formed line at one end of the parade and two at the other and at the
command of the kamak the thousand men charged swiftly down the field
in two solid ranks that approached one another with the speed of an
express train. Just when it seemed impossible that a serious accident
could be averted, when it seemed that in another instant diadets and
riders must crash together in a bloody jumble of broken bones, the
warriors rushing so swiftly toward the east raised their agile mounts,
which fairly flew above the heads of the opposing force and alighting
upon the other side in an unbroken line continued to the far end of the
field.
</p><p>Tarzan was commenting on this maneuver and upon the beauties of the
landscaping of the city of Veltopismakus to Komodoflorensal as they
proceeded along the Warriors' Corridor, sufficiently ahead of their
escort that Tarzan might speak in a low tone without the guard being
cognizant of the fact that he was using the language of Minuni.
</p><p>"It is a beautiful evolution," replied Komodoflorensal, "and it
was performed with a precision seldom attained. I have heard that
Elkomoelhago's troops are famous for the perfection of their drill,
and as justly so as is Veltopismakus for the beauty of her walks and
gardens; but, my friend, these very things constitute the weakness
of the city. While Elkomoelhago's warriors are practicing to perfect
their appearance upon parade, the warriors of my father, Adendrohahkis,
are far afield, out of sight of admiring women and spying slaves,
practicing the art of war under the rough conditions of the field
and camp. The amaks of Elkomoelhago might easily defeat those of
Adendrohahkis in a contest for the most beautiful; but it was not long
since you saw less than fifteen thousand Trohanadalmakusians repulse
fully thirty thousand warriors of Veltopismakus, for they never passed
the infantry line that day. Yes, they can drill beautifully upon parade
and they are courageous, all Minunians are that, but they have not been
trained in the sterner arts of war--it is not the way of Elkomoelhago.
He is soft and effeminate. He cares not for war. He listens to the
advice he likes best--the advice of the weaklings and the women who
urge him to refrain from war entirely, which would be not altogether
bad if he could persuade the other fellow to refrain, also.
</p><p>"The beautiful trees and shrubs that almost make a forest of
Veltopismakus, and which you so admire! I, too, admire them--especially
do I admire them in the city of an enemy. How easy it would be for
a Trohanadalmakusian army to creep through the night, hidden by the
beautiful trees and shrubs, to the very gateways of the domes of
Veltopismakus! Do you understand now, my friend, why you saw less
perfect maneuvers upon the parade grounds of my city than you have seen
here, and why, though we love trees and shrubbery, we have none planted
within the city of Trohanadalmakus?"
</p><p>One of the guards who had approached him quickly from the rear touched
Komodoflorensal upon the shoulder. "You said that Zuanthrol does not
understand our language. Why then do you speak to him in this tongue
which he cannot understand," the fellow demanded.
</p><p>Komodoflorensal did not know how much the warrior had overheard. If he
had heard Tarzan speak in Minuni it might be difficult to persuade the
fellow that The Giant did not understand the language; but he must act
on the assumption that he, alone, had been overheard.
</p><p>"He wishes to learn it and I am trying to teach him," replied
Komodoflorensal quickly.
</p><p>"Has he learned anything of it?" asked the warrior.
</p><p>"No," said Komodoflorensal, "he is very stupid."
</p><p>And after this they went in silence, winding up long, gentle inclines,
or again scaling the primitive ladders that the Minunians use to
reach the upper levels of their dome-houses between the occasional
levels that are not connected by the inclined runways, which are thus
frequently broken for purposes of defense, the ladders being easily
withdrawn upward behind hard pressed defenders and the advance of the
enemy thus more easily checked.
</p><p>The royal dome of Elkomoelhago was of vast proportions, its summit
rising to an equivalent of over four hundred feet, had it been built
upon a scale corresponding to the relatively larger size of ordinary
mankind. Tarzan ascended until he was almost as far above ground as
he had been below ground in the quarry. Where the corridors on lower
levels had been crowded with humanity, those which they now traversed
were almost devoid of life. Occasionally they passed a tenanted
chamber, but far more generally the rooms were utilized for storage
purposes, especially for food, great quantities of which, cured, dried
and neatly wrapped, was packed ceiling-high in many large chambers.
</p><p>The decorations of the walls were less ornate and the corridors
narrower, on the whole, than those at lower levels. However, they
passed through many large chambers, or halls, which were gorgeously
decorated, and in several of which were many people of both sexes and
all ages variously occupied, either with domestic activities or with
the handiwork of one art or another.
</p><p>Here was a man working in silver, perhaps fashioning a bracelet
of delicate filigree, or another carving beautiful arabesques
upon leather. There were makers of pottery, weavers of cloth,
metal stampers, painters, makers of candles, and these appeared to
predominate, for the candle was in truth life to these people.
</p><p>And then, at last, they reached the highest level, far above the
ground, where the rooms were much closer to daylight because of the
diminished thickness of the walls near the summit of the dome, but
even here were the ever-present candles. Suddenly the walls of the
corridor became gorgeously decorated, the number of candles increased,
and Tarzan sensed that they were approaching the quarters of a rich
or powerful noble. They halted, now, before a doorway where stood a
sentinel, with whom one of the warriors conducting them communicated.
</p><p>"Tell Zoanthrohago Zertol that we have brought Zuanthrol and another
slave who can communicate with him in a strange tongue."
</p><p>The sentinel struck a heavy gong with his lance and presently, from
the interior of the chamber, a man appeared to whom the sentinel
repeated the warrior's message.
</p><p>"Let them enter," said the newcomer, who was a white-tunicked slave;
"my glorious master, Zoanthrohago Zertol, expects his slave Zuanthrol.
Follow me!"
</p><p>They followed him through several chambers until at last he led them
into the presence of a gorgeously garbed warrior who was seated behind
a large table, or desk, upon which were numerous strange instruments,
large, cumbersome looking volumes, pads of heavy Minunian writing paper
and the necessary implements for writing. The man looked up as they
entered the room.
</p><p>"It is your slave, Zuanthrol, Zertol," announced the fellow who had led
them hither.
</p><p>"But the other?" Prince Zoanthrohago pointed at Komodoflorensal.
</p><p>"He speaks the strange language that Zuanthrol speaks, and he was
brought along that you might communicate with Zuanthrol if you so
wished." Zoanthrohago nodded.
</p><p>He turned to Komodoflorensal. "Ask him," he ordered, "if he feels any
differently since I reduced his size."
</p><p>When the question was put to Tarzan by Komodoflorensal in the imaginary
language with which they were supposed to communicate the ape-man shook
his head, at the same time speaking a few words in English.
</p><p>"He says no, illustrious prince," translated Komodoflorensal out of his
imagination, "and he asks when you will restore him to his normal size
and permit him to return to his own country, which is far from Minuni."
</p><p>"As a Minunian he should know," replied the Zertol, "that he never will
be permitted to return to his own country--Trohanadalmakus never will
see him again."
</p><p>"But he is not of Trohanadalmakus, nor is he a Minunian," explained
Komodoflorensal. "He came to us and we did not make a slave of him, but
treated him as a friend, because he is from a far country with which we
have never made war."
</p><p>"What country is that?" demanded Zoanthrohago.
</p><p>"That we do not know, but he says that there is a great country beyond
the thorns where dwell many millions as large as was he. He says that
his people would not be unfriendly to ours and for this reason we
should not enslave him, but treat him as a guest."
</p><p>Zoanthrohago smiled. "If you believe this you must be a simple fellow,
Trohanadalmakusian," he said. "We all know that there is naught beyond
Minuni but impenetrable forests of thorn to the very uttermost wall of
the blue dome within which we all dwell. I can well believe that the
fellow is no Trohanadalmakusian, but he most certainly is a Minunian,
since all creatures of whatever kind dwell in Minuni. Doubtless he is
a strange form of Zertalacolol, a member of a tribe inhabiting some
remote mountain fastness, which we have never previously discovered;
but be that as it may, he will never----"
</p><p>At this juncture the prince was interrupted by the clanging of the
great gong at the outer entrance to his apartments. He paused to count
the strokes and when they reached five and ceased he turned to the
warriors who had conducted Tarzan and Komodoflorensal to his presence.
</p><p>"Take the slaves into that chamber," he instructed, pointing to a
doorway in the rear of the apartment in which he had received them.
"When the king has gone I will send for them."
</p><p>As they were crossing toward the doorway Zoanthrohago had indicated a
warrior halted in the main entrance to the chamber. "Elkomoelhago,"
he announced, "Thagosto of Veltopismakus, Ruler of All Men, Master of
Created Things, All-Wise, All-Courageous, All-Glorious! Down before the
thagosto!"
</p><p>Tarzan glanced back as he was quitting the chamber to see Zoanthrohago
and the others in the room kneel and lean far back with arms raised
high above their heads as Elkomoelhago entered with a guard of a dozen
gorgeous warriors, and he could not but compare this ruler with the
simple and dignified soldier who ruled Trohanadalmakus and who went
about his city without show or pomp, and oftentimes with no other
escort than a single slave; a ruler to whom no man bent his knee, yet
to whom was accorded the maximum of veneration and respect.
</p><p>And Elkomoelhago had seen the slaves and the warriors leave the chamber
as he had entered it. He acknowledged the salutes of Zoanthrohago and
his people with a curt wave of the hand and commanded them to arise.
</p><p>"Who quitted the apartment as I entered?" he demanded, looking
suspiciously at Zoanthrohago.
</p><p>"The slave Zuanthrol and another who interprets his strange language
for me," explained the Zertol.
</p><p>"Have them back," commanded the thagosto; "I would speak with you
concerning Zuanthrol."
</p><p>Zoanthrohago instructed one of his slaves to fetch them and, in the few
moments that it required, Elkomoelhago took a chair behind the desk
at which his host had been sitting. When Tarzan and Komodoflorensal
entered the chamber the guard who accompanied them brought them to
within a few paces of the desk behind which the king sat, and here he
bade them kneel and make their obeisance to the thagosto.
</p><p>Familiar since childhood, was every tradition of slavery to
Komodoflorensal the Trohanadalmakusian. Almost in a spirit of Fatalism
had he accepted the conditions of this servitude that the fortunes
of war had thrust him into and so it was that, without question or
hesitation, he dropped to one knee in servile salute to this alien
king; but not so Tarzan of the Apes. He was thinking of Adendrohahkis.
He had bent no knee to him and he did not propose to do greater honor
to Elkomoelhago, whose very courtiers and slaves despised him, than he
had done to the really great king of Veltopismakus.
</p><p>Elkomoelhago glared at him. "The fellow is not kneeling," he whispered
to Zoanthrohago, who had been leaning back so far that he had not
noticed the new slave's act of disrespect.
</p><p>The Zertol glanced toward Tarzan. "Down, fellow!" he cried, and then
recalling that he understood no Minunian, he commanded Komodoflorensal
to order him to kneel, but when the Trohanadalmakusian Zertolosto
pretended to do so Tarzan but shook his head.
</p><p>Elkomoelhago signaled the others to rise. "We will let it pass this
time," he said, for something in the attitude of the slave told him
that Zuanthrol never would kneel to him and as he was valuable because
of the experiment of which he was the subject, the king preferred to
swallow his pride rather than risk having the slave killed in an effort
to compel him to kneel. "He is but an ignorant Zertalacolol. See that
he is properly instructed before we see him again."
