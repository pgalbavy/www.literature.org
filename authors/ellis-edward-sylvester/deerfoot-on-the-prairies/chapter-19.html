<p>IT seemed too good to be true, and yet all doubt vanished with
the words spoken by the Blackfoot.</p>

<p>"I can’t say I liked the way Black Elk acted when we first met,"
said Victor, "but he has proved himself more of a man than I supposed.
I hope now he won’t punish Young Elk for running away from me."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because <em>I</em> gave him enough. Anyway, whatever the father
did to his boys has been already done, so we needn’t worry over
it."</p>

<p>"Mul-tal-la," said George, "you haven’t any doubts left?"</p>

<p>"It is wrong to doubt; the words of Black Elk were true; he spoke
with a single tongue. My brothers need not fear."</p>

<p>"Why don’t those Shoshones of his come back and see us through
the mountains? It strikes me that that is the right thing to do."</p>

<p>"No; they will stay with the Cas-ta-ba-nas and hold them back
if they try to do us harm. They will be with them till we are
far away; then they can go back to Black Elk and tell him that
all has been done as he ordered."</p>

<p>"It is better than I thought," said the pleased George. "I don’t
suppose we are likely to run against any more of those people;
if we do, we can fall back on these reserves."</p>

<p>The Blackfoot silently led the journey for an hour longer. No
one observing the surety of his movements would have thought he
had been over the route but once before. Everything appeared to
be as familiar as if he had spent his life in the mountains. The
trail continued to ascend and soon became harder to travel. Several
times it looked to the boys as if they would be checked and turned
back, but their guide always found a course that permitted the
passage of their horses’ feet.</p>

<p>"This is well enough," finally remarked Victor, "but I don’t
see the need of it. We did a good deal of traveling to-day, and
if those Indians to the rear are friendly what’s the use of hurrying
to get away from them?"</p>

<p>"I don’t think Mul-tal-la means to travel much farther."</p>

<p>Even as George spoke the Blackfoot halted. He had been pushing
on in order to reach the most favorable spot for camping. It was
found near the base of a mass of black frowning rocks, from beneath
which bubbled a tiny stream of ice-cold water. This formed a deep
pool close to the rocks, and then dripped away in the gloom of
the boulders, trees and undergrowth. The place was sheltered against
the arctic winds which sometimes rage at this altitude, and indeed
was so attractive that while our friends were gathering fuel and
preparing for camp, they saw it had been used more than once for
the same purpose by other hunting parties in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Hardly had the animals been relieved of saddles, bridles and
the pack, and the fire started, when the three were given a taste
of the variable climate of that section. Although summer had fully
come, the wind moaned and howled through the trees at the summit
of the rocks and on their right and left. Suddenly Victor called
out:</p>

<p>"It’s snowing!"</p>

<p>In a twinkling, as it were, the air was filled with blinding
flakes, which eddied and whirled about the three and covered their
bodies with its white mantle. The horses found protection by huddling
close to the pile of stone, though the temperature was not very
low.</p>

<p>The flurry passed almost as quickly as it arose. In a few minutes
the air was as clear as before, and the moon shone from an unclouded
sky. The friends gathered about the fire, which was soon burning
vigorously.</p>

<p>It was the turn of George Shelton to go on guard for the first
part of the night, changing places with his brother at the usual
hour. Since this duty had to be divided among three persons, the
Blackfoot would do his share in the early half of the following
evening, alternating with George, while Victor would be given
rest. This plan was kept up when Deerfoot was absent, so the division
of the work was as equitable as it could be. When the party included
four people the arrangement was simpler.</p>

<p>The action of Mul-tal-la removed any lingering misgiving the
boys may have felt. Had the Blackfoot been distrustful of the
honor of Black Elk, the Shoshone chieftain, he himself would have
acted as sentinel for the first portion and probably throughout
all the darkness; but, while the night was still young, he wrapped
himself in his blanket and stretched out to sleep, Victor Shelton
speedily doing the same.</p>

<p>Left to himself, George Shelton entered upon his task in his
usual deliberate manner. The fire was replenished from the wood
that had been gathered, and with his gun resting on his shoulder
he marked out a beat over which he slowly tramped to and fro.
At the middle of the course he moved in front of the fire, so
that any foe lingering near could have seen him clearly, and,
had he been so disposed, picked off the youth without risk to
himself.</p>

<p>George at first felt a natural shrinking when he knew his form
was shown in relief against the yellow background, but after the
pacing had been kept up for an hour or so without molestation
this feeling passed off, and his thoughts became tranquil. He
often peered into the gloom which walled him in on every hand,
pausing and listening, but hearing nothing unusual. His expectation
was that some prowling beast would be attracted by the light of
the camp-fire, but it was the summer time, when they were not
likely to be pressed for food, and nothing in the nature of an
attack was to be feared from wolves, bears or any species of forest
creatures.</p>

<p>The youth looked up at the sky, which was clear and cold. The
moon gave only slight illumination, and now and then he traced
many of the constellations, as he and his brother had often done
when at home or when on the trail in the leafy solitudes. He gazed
at the Pleiades, which to him and Victor were always the Seven
Stars, and again noted the peculiarity of that beautiful group
with which I am sure you are familiar. When you look at the stars
fixedly and try to count, you can see but six, but glancing abruptly
at them the seven are visible. He recalled the fancy that one
of the cluster was so modest that when stared at it shrinks from
sight, to steal into view again after the scrutiny is removed.
It seemed to George that he never looked at the heavens on a starry
night without his eyes immediately resting upon the Dipper, as
he and his friends called a portion of the constellation of Ursa
Major. Then, too, he traced the Little Dipper, located Orion and
the North Star, and in the loneliness of the hour mused upon the
One who had launched all these stupendous orbs into space and
set them spinning over their mighty orbits, as they shall spin
until time shall be no more.</p>

<p>Who can look at the worlds circling through the dome of heaven
without being profoundly awed by his own insignificance and the
infinite greatness of the Author of all these marvels? How little
and mean seem the affairs of this life when we are brought into
such intimate communion with the wonders that are beyond the grasp
of the greatest intellect!</p>

<p>But the hours wore on and George was still tramping to and fro
when he saw Victor sit up, fling aside his blanket and rise to
his feet. Impressed before falling asleep with the duty that awaited
him, he awoke at the right minute without external help. The two
exchanged places after a few words, during which George made known
that he had not seen or heard anything to cause alarm.</p>

<p>The experience of Victor was quite similar to that of his brother,
and when the gray light of the morning began stealing through
the mountains the slumber of the Blackfoot had continued unbroken.
He showed no surprise over the report of the boys. Upon leaving
the camp of the Cas-ta-ba-nas the night before it was with a feeling
of certainty that Black Elk had carried out his promise in spirit
and letter.</p>

<p>While the boys bathed faces and hands in the crystalline pool,
the Blackfoot strolled off, bow and arrow in hand, in search of
breakfast. Wild turkeys were so plentiful in the mountains that
he soon came back with a big, plump bird, from which they made
their usual excellent breakfast. He told the boys that the meal
must suffice until night, for he did not mean to halt any longer
than necessary to rest the horses. Two meals a day are enough
for anybody, and it is slight hardship for a hunter or traveler
to get on with a single repast.</p>

<p>Soon after the journey was resumed the trail began to descend,
but shortly rose again, though not to the same extent. The air
was clear and sunshiny, and before noon, despite their elevation,
which was not great, the heat became uncomfortable. To relieve
the animals and for the sake of the exercise all needed, the three
walked most of the time, Mul-tal-la keeping his place at the head,
while the brothers trailed at the rear.</p>

<p>It was slightly past noon when they paused to rest their animals.
The spot was in a valley-like depression, through which wound
a stream of clear, cold water. A little to the right of the trail
this expanded into a pool or pond several rods across and fifteen
or twenty feet deep. The water, however, was so transparent that
the stones and pebbles could be plainly seen in the deepest portion.</p>

<p>The temptation was too great to be resisted. Victor’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"George, we must have a swim! I never saw a finer place. Who’ll
be first in?"</p>

<p>The Blackfoot, like most of his race, was much less fond of water
than the Caucasian. Mul-tal-la smiled at the ardor of his young
friends, and remarked that he would stroll down the trail to refresh
his memory as to the route. Then he passed out of sight, and the
boys were left to themselves.</p>

<p>"This is a good chance to do our weekly washing," said George,
as they began disrobing; "it’s time we attended to that."</p>

<p>It was the practice of the boys and Deerfoot to look after that
indispensable work at regular intervals, for they had not the
excuse of the lack of opportunity, since rarely were they out
of sight of water. So the brothers brought their underclothing
from the pack of Zigzag and laid it on the bank to don when their
swim was over. Then they cleansed that which they had taken off,
as well as they could without the help of soap. I am afraid they
hurried through with the task, for in a very brief time they were
frolicking in the icy water and enjoying themselves as nobody
in the world can enjoy himself unless he is a rugged youngster,
overflowing with health and animal spirits.</p>

<p>They dived and swam; they splashed and tried to duck each other;
their happy laughter rang out, and it seemed to them as if they
could do nothing finer than spend the remainder of the day in
the pool. If the first contact with the icy element gave them
a shock, it also imparted an electric thrill which tingled from
the crown of the head to the end of the toes, and made them shout
and cry out in the wanton ecstasy of enjoyment.</p>

<p>But in due time they felt they had had enough and the moment
had come to don their clothing again, leaving that which had been
washed spread out and drying in the sunlight. They reluctantly
emerged from the pool and gingerly picked their way over the pebbles.</p>

<p>Victor was a few paces in advance. His brother was in the act
of leaving the water when Victor uttered an exclamation:</p>

<p>"Great Cæsar, George! Somebody has stolen our clothes!"</p>
