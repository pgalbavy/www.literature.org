<p>"Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared at the door of her ante-room," 
continues Rouletabille’s note-book. "We were near her door in
the gallery where this incredible phenomenon had taken place.
There are moments when one feels as if one’s brain were about
to burst. A bullet in the head, a fracture of the skull, the seat
of reason shattered&mdash;with only these can I compare the sensation
which exhausted and left me void of sense.</p>

<p>"Happily, Mademoiselle Stangerson appeared on the threshold of
her ante-room. I saw her, and that helped to relieve my chaotic
state of mind. I breathed her &mdash;I inhaled the perfume of
the lady in black, whom I should never see again. I would have
given ten years of my life&mdash;half my life&mdash;to see once more the
lady in black! Alas! I no more meet her but from time to time,&mdash;and
yet!&mdash;and yet! how the memory of that perfume&mdash;felt by me alone&mdash;carries
me back to the days of my childhood.* It was this sharp reminder
from my beloved perfume, of the lady in black, which made me go
to her&mdash;dressed wholly in white and so pale&mdash;so pale and so beautiful!&mdash;on
the threshold of the inexplicable gallery. Her beautiful golden
hair, gathered into a knot on the back of her neck, left visible
the red star on her temple which had so nearly been the cause
of her death. When I first got on the right track of the mystery
of this case I had imagined that, on the night of the tragedy
in The "Yellow Room", Mademoiselle Stangerson had worn her hair
in bands. But then, how could I have imagined otherwise when I
had not been in "The Yellow Room"!</p>

* When I wrote these lines, Joseph Rouletabille was eighteen<br/>
years of age,&mdash;and he spoke of his "youth." I have kept the<br/>
text of my friend, but I inform the reader here that the<br/>
episode of the mystery of "The Yellow Room" has no connection<br/>
with that of the perfume of the lady in black. It is not my<br/>
fault if, in the document which I have cited, Rouletabille<br/>
thought fit to refer to his childhood.

<p>"But now, since the occurrence of the inexplicable gallery, I
did not reason at all. I stood there, stupid, before the apparition&mdash;so
pale and so beautiful&mdash;of Mademoiselle Stangerson. She was clad
in a dressing-gown of dreamy white. One might have taken her to
be a ghost&mdash;a lovely phantom. Her father took her in his arms
and kissed her passionately, as if he had recovered her after
being long lost to him. I dared not question her. He drew her
into the room and we followed them,&mdash;for we had to know! &mdash;The
door of the boudoir was open. The terrified faces of the two nurses
craned towards us. Mademoiselle Stangerson inquired the meaning
of all the disturbance. That she was not in her own room was quite
easily explained&mdash;quite easily. She had a fancy not to sleep that
night in her chamber, but in the boudoir with her nurses, locking
the door on them. Since the night of the crime she had experienced
feelings of terror, and fears came over her that are easily to
be comprehended.</p>

<p>"But who could imagine that on that particular night when he
was to come, she would, by a mere chance, determine to shut herself
in with her women? Who would think that she would act contrary
to her father’s wish to sleep in the drawing-room? Who could believe
that the letter which had so recently been on the table in her
room would no longer be there? He who could understand all this,
would have to assume that Mademoiselle Stangerson knew that the
murderer was coming&mdash;she could not prevent his coming again&mdash;unknown
to her father, unknown to all but to Monsieur Robert Darzac. For
he must know it now&mdash;perhaps he had known it before! Did he remember
that phrase in the Elysee garden: ‘Must I commit a crime, then,
to win you?’ Against whom the crime, if not against the obstacle,
against the murderer? ‘Ah, I would kill him with my own hand!’
And I replied, ‘You have not answered my question.’ That was the
very truth. In truth, in truth, Monsieur Darzac knew the murderer
so well that&mdash;while wishing to kill him himself&mdash;he was afraid
I should find him. There could be but two reasons why he had assisted
me in my investigation. First, because I forced him to do it;
and, second, because she would be the better protected.</p>

<p>"I am in the chamber&mdash;her room. I look at her, also at the place
where the letter had just now been. She has possessed herself
of it; it was evidently intended for her&mdash;evidently. How she trembles!
&mdash;Trembles at the strange story her father is telling her,
of the presence of the murderer in her chamber, and of the pursuit.
But it is plainly to be seen that she is not wholly satisfied
by the assurance given her until she had been told that the murderer,
by some incomprehensible means, had been able to elude us.</p>

<p>"Then follows a silence. What a silence! We are all there&mdash;looking
at her&mdash;her father, Larsan, Daddy Jacques and I. What were we
all thinking of in the silence? After the events of that night,
of the mystery of the inexplicable gallery, of the prodigious
fact of the presence of the murderer in her room, it seemed to
me that all our thoughts might have been translated into the words
which were addressed to her. ‘You who know of this mystery, explain
it to us, and we shall perhaps be able to save you. How I longed
to save her&mdash;for herself, and, from the other! &mdash;It brought
the tears to my eyes.</p>

<p>"She is there, shedding about her the perfume of the lady in
black. At last, I see her, in the silence of her chamber. Since
the fatal hour of the mystery of "The Yellow Room", we have hung
about this invisible and silent woman to learn what she knows.
Our desires, our wish to know must be a torment to her. Who can
tell that, should we learn the secret of her mystery, it would
not precipitate a tragedy more terrible than that which had already
been enacted here? Who can tell if it might not mean her death?
Yet it had brought her close to death,&mdash;and we still knew nothing.
Or, rather, there are some of us who know nothing. But <em>I&mdash;</em>if
I knew who, I should know all. Who?&mdash;Who? &mdash;Not knowing who,
I must remain silent, out of pity for her. For there is no doubt
that she knows how he escaped from "The Yellow Room", and yet
she keeps the secret. When I know who, I will speak to him&mdash;to
him!"</p>

<p>"She looked at us now&mdash;with a far-away look in her eyes&mdash;as if
we were not in the chamber. Monsieur Stangerson broke the silence.
He declared that, henceforth, he would no more absent himself
from his daughter’s apartments. She tried to oppose him in vain.
He adhered firmly to his purpose. He would install himself there
this very night, he said. Solely concerned for the health of his
daughter, he reproached her for having left her bed. Then he suddenly
began talking to her as if she were a little child. He smiled
at her and seemed not to know either what he said or what he did.
The illustrious professor had lost his head. Mademoiselle Stangerson
in a tone of tender distress said: ‘Father!&mdash;father!’ Daddy Jacques
blows his nose, and Frederic Larsan himself is obliged to turn
away to hide his emotion. For myself, I am able neither to think
or feel. I felt an infinite contempt for myself.</p>

<p>"It was the first time that Frederic Larsan, like myself, found
himself face to face with Mademoiselle Stangerson since the attack
in "The Yellow Room". Like me, he had insisted on being allowed
to question the unhappy lady; but he had not, any more than had
I, been permitted. To him, as to me, the same answer had always
been given: Mademoiselle Stangerson was too weak to receive us.
The questionings of the examining magistrate had over-fatigued
her. It was evidently intended not to give us any assistance in
our researches. I was not surprised; but Frederic Larsan had always
resented this conduct. It is true that he and I had a totally
different theory of the crime.</p>

<p>"I still catch myself repeating from the depths of my heart:
‘Save her!&mdash;save her without his speaking!’ Who is he&mdash;the murderer?
Take him and shut his mouth. But Monsieur Darzac made it clear
that in order to shut his mouth he must be killed. Have I the
right to kill Mademoiselle Stangerson’s murderer? No, I had not.
But let him only give me the chance! Let me find out whether he
is really a creature of flesh and blood! &mdash;Let me see his
dead body, since it cannot be taken alive.</p>

<p>"If I could but make this woman, who does not even look at us,
understand! She is absorbed by her fears and by her father’s distress
of mind. And I can do nothing to save her. Yes, I will go to work
once more and accomplish wonders.</p>

<p>"I move towards her. I would speak to her. I would entreat her
to have confidence in me. I would, in a word, make her understand&mdash;she
alone&mdash;that I know how the murderer escaped from "The Yellow Room"&mdash;that
I have guessed the motives for her secrecy&mdash;and that I pity her
with all my heart. But by her gestures she begged us to leave
her alone, expressing weariness and the need for immediate rest.
Monsieur Stangerson asked us to go back to our rooms and thanked
us. Frederic Larsan and I bowed to him and, followed by Daddy
Jacques, we regained the gallery. I heard Larsan murmur: ‘Strange!
strange!’ He made a sign to me to go with him into his room. On
the threshold he turned towards Daddy Jacques.</p>

<p>"‘Did you see him distinctly?’ he asked.</p>

<p>"‘Who?’</p>

<p>"‘The man?’</p>

<p>"‘Saw him!&mdash;why, he had a big red beard and red hair.’</p>

<p>"‘That’s how he appeared to me,’ I said.</p>

<p>"‘And to me,’ said Larsan.</p>

<p>"The great Fred and I were alone in his chamber, now, to talk
over this thing. We talked for an hour, turning the matter over
and viewing it from every side. From the questions put by him,
from the explanation which he gives me, it is clear to me that&mdash;in
spite of all our senses&mdash;he is persuaded the man disappeared by
some secret passage in the chateau known to him alone.</p>

<p>"‘He knows the chateau,’ he said to me; ‘he knows it well.’</p>

<p>"‘He is a rather tall man&mdash;well-built,’ I suggested.</p>

<p>"‘He is as tall as he wants to be,’ murmured Fred.</p>

<p>"‘I understand,’ I said; ‘but how do you account for his red
hair and beard?’</p>

<p>"‘Too much beard&mdash;too much hair&mdash;false,’ says Fred.</p>

<p>"‘That’s easily said. You are always thinking of Robert Darzac.
You can’t get rid of that idea? I am certain that he is innocent.’</p>

<p>"‘So much the better. I hope so; but everything condemns him.
Did you notice the marks on the carpet? &mdash;Come and look at
them.’</p>

<p>"‘I have seen them; they are the marks of the neat boots, the
same as those we saw on the border of the lake.’</p>

<p>"‘Can you deny that they belong to Robert Darzac?’</p>

<p>"‘Of course, one may be mistaken.’</p>

<p>"‘Have you noticed that those footprints only go in one direction?&mdash;that
there are no return marks? When the man came from the chamber,
pursued by all of us, his footsteps left no traces behind them.’</p>

<p>"‘He had, perhaps, been in the chamber for hours. The mud from
his boots had dried, and he moved with such rapidity on the points
of his toes &mdash;We saw him running, but we did not hear his
steps.’</p>

<p>"I suddenly put an end to this idle chatter&mdash;void of any logic,
and made a sign to Larsan to listen.</p>

<p>"‘There&mdash;below; some one is shutting a door.’</p>

<p>"I rise; Larsan follows me; we descend to the ground-floor of
the chateau. I lead him to the little semi-circular room under
the terrace beneath the window of the ‘off-turning’ gallery. I
point to the door, now closed, open a short time before, under
which a shaft of light is visible.</p>

<p>"‘The forest-keeper!’ says Fred.</p>

<p>"‘Come on!’ I whisper.</p>

<p>"Prepared &mdash;I know not why&mdash;to believe that the keeper is
the guilty man &mdash;I go to the door and rap smartly on it.
Some might think that we were rather late in thinking of the keeper,
since our first business, after having found that the murderer
had escaped us in the gallery, ought to have been to search everywhere
else,&mdash;around the chateau,&mdash;in the park&mdash;</p>

<p>"Had this criticism been made at the time, we could only have
answered that the assassin had disappeared from the gallery in
such a way that we thought he was no longer anywhere! He had eluded
us when we all had our hands stretched out ready to seize him&mdash;when
we were almost touching him. We had no longer any ground for hoping
that we could clear up the mystery of that night.</p>

<p>"As soon as I rapped at the door it was opened, and the keeper
asked us quietly what we wanted. He was undressed and preparing
to go to bed. The bed had not yet been disturbed.</p>

<p>"We entered and I affected surprise.</p>

<p>"‘Not gone to bed yet?’</p>

<p>"‘No,’ he replied roughly. ‘I have been making a round of the
park and in the woods. I am only just back&mdash;and sleepy. Good-night!’</p>

<p>"‘Listen,’ I said. ‘An hour or so ago, there was a ladder close
by your window.’</p>

<p>"‘What ladder? &mdash;I did not see any ladder. Good-night!’</p>

<p>"And he simply put us out of the room. When we were outside I
looked at Larsan. His face was impenetrable.</p>

<p>"‘Well?’ I said.</p>

<p>"‘Well?’ he repeated.</p>

<p>"‘Does that open out any new view to you?’</p>

<p>"There was no mistaking Larsan’s bad temper. On re-entering the
chateau, I heard him mutter:</p>

<p>"‘It would be strange&mdash;very strange&mdash;if I had deceived myself
on that point!’</p>

<p>"He seemed to be talking to me rather than to himself. He added:
‘In any case, we shall soon know what to think. The morning will
bring light with it.’"</p>
