<p>After Farmer Green put the lid with the holes in it over the top of the
feeding trough, Grunty Pig began to grow. At last he was getting as much
to eat as his brothers and sisters. And the bigger he grew, the more
food he wanted. He was always on the watch for some extra tidbit--always
rooting about to find some dainty that others had overlooked. Many a
delicious piece of carrot, or turnip, or potato-paring rewarded him for
his eager searching.
</p>
<p>Still, Grunty Pig was far from satisfied. He had a great longing to get
outside the pen where he lived with the rest of Mrs. Pig's seven
children.
</p><p>"Out in the wide world there must be many good things to eat," he
thought. "I'd like to find the place where the potato-parings grow."
</p><p>But of all this, Grunty Pig said nothing to anyone. If the chance ever
came to slip out of the pen, he intended to take nobody with him. He had
not yet caught up with his brothers and sisters in size, even if he had
outstripped them in the matter of brains. And he feared that any one of
them would crowd him away from the good things that he meant to find
beyond the walls of the pigsty.
</p><p>Little did Mrs. Pig dream what plans filled the head of her son Grunty.
When she saw him sniffing around the walls of the pen she never once
guessed that he could be looking for anything except something to eat.
How could she know that Grunty--the littlest of the family--was
searching for a place to escape?
</p><p>Now, it happened that there was one loose board in a corner of the
pigpen. The nails that once held it had rusted away. Nobody but Grunty
Pig had discovered that by pressing against an end of this board one
could bend it outward.
</p><p>It was too bad--for him--that he had grown so rapidly. Had he been just
a bit smaller he could have squeezed through the opening.
</p><p>Here Grunty met the first real problem of his life. For some days he
puzzled over it. One thing was certain: he couldn't make himself
smaller, unless he stopped eating. And that was out of the question. In
the end he made up his mind that there was only one thing to do: he must
make the opening bigger.
</p><p>Day after day Grunty Pig crowded against the loose board. And at last
came his reward. Two more rusty nails gave way all at once. Under
Grunty's weight the board opened wide. And as he slipped through the
space, to freedom, the board snapped back into place again.
</p><p>There he was, with the wide world before him. And there was the pen,
with no opening anywhere to be seen.
</p><p>With a grunt of delight Grunty Pig trotted out of the low building and
found himself on the edge of Farmer Green's orchard.
</p><p>He noticed that there was a fragrant smell of apples in the air.
