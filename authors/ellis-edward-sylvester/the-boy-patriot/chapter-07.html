<p>The pilot-boat was nearing the strange vessel, when Blair suddenly
exclaimed, "I see British uniforms on board. We have been tricked
by that flag falsely displayed. It is an English man-of-war. Put
about. We'll pilot no such vessel into Fairport."</p>

<p>Quick as thought the little boat had turned its head, and was
making towards the shore. The movement was not unperceived on
board the man-of-war, and its cause was at once understood. A
boat, manned by a dozen strong rowers, had been made ready for
such an emergency. They were quickly in pursuit of the retreating
pilot. They gained rapidly upon the boys, and were soon alongside,
commanding Blair to surrender, while half a dozen muskets were
aimed at the brave lads.</p>

<p>"Fire! Do your worst! I am not afraid to die!" sprang to the
lips of Blair Robertson; but he thought of his mother, and was
silent. He had no right so to throw away the life of her only
son.</p>

<p>"Surrender, or we shall fire," was again repeated.</p>

<p>"A couple of unarmed boys, decoyed within your reach, would be
a worthy mark for your treacherous British muskets," said Blair
boldly. "I would dare you to fire, but there are those at home
who would miss us too much. Do what you will with us; we are your
prisoners."</p>

<p>The British tars handled their captives without ceremony, and
hurried them at once on board the man-of-war and presented them
before its impatient commander.</p>

<p>Not a little surprised at the grotesque appearance of the prisoners,
he exclaimed in astonishment, "Who and what are you?"</p>

<p>"I am a Yankee boy, the captain of the Fairport Guard," said
Blair frankly. "We had been parading, when your signal for a pilot
called me too suddenly away for me to have time to lay aside this
dress, <em>this coat</em> which my grandfather wore at <em>Bunker
Hill</em>."</p>

<p>A strong emphasis was laid on the last word of the sentence.</p>

<p>"You young rascal!" exclaimed the commander. "And who is this
Tom-fool of a companion?"</p>

<p>"It is my friend, and one of our company. He would not see me
risking my life on the water while he stood on the shore. Would
that we had many such 'Tom-fools,' with brave, strong hearts like
his."</p>

<p>As Blair spoke, he took off his official cap and left his noble
young head bare. With another movement the precious coat was thrown
over his arm, and the stripling stood in his school-boy dress
before the English commander, who exclaimed, "A pretty pilot,
you. Who sent you on this mad errand?"</p>

<p>"My father has been for thirty years the pilot of Fairport. He
is now absent fighting for his country against her oppressors.
I know the channel well. No one of our few remaining men would
venture his life in such a sea for an unknown vessel, and so I
came. I knew it would be certain death for you to try to enter
that harbor without a pilot."</p>

<p>"Then do your duty, young malapert. There is no time to be lost.
We'll run up the British flag, and go into port under fair colors."</p>

<p>The commander gave the necessary orders to have the last suggestion
carried out, and the sailors were prompt to do his bidding.</p>

<p>Blair stood perfectly still, while a look of stern determination
sat on his young face. "I will never pilot enemies to the shores
of our land. You can shoot me, but you cannot force me to act
the traitor."</p>

<p>The boy spoke resolutely. The English commander eyed him for
a moment, and then said quickly,</p>

<p>"Shooting is too good for you, young dare-devil. That is quick
work, soon over. There are other means of bringing you to terms."</p>

<p>The commander held in his hand a thick pamphlet in which he had
been reading. He made it into a firm scroll, and placed it upon
the edge of the railing near which he was standing. Then turning
to one of the sailors, he said, "Here, let me see you cut that
through with your knife. Be quick."</p>

<p>The man drew the long knife from his belt, and with one sweeping
stroke severed the thick scroll. One part went fluttering through
the air and dropped in the angry waters, while the other was firmly
held by the commander.</p>

<p>"Put young master's right-hand in the same place, and we will
see it food for fishes. Or will he choose to do his duty, and
keep his precious five fingers for future use?"</p>

<p>The words had hardly passed from the lips of the British officer,
when Blair laid his hand calmly on the railing, and exclaimed,
"Now, God helping me, you may tear me limb from limb, and I will
be true to my country and my home."</p>

<p>"It's no use. He'll keep his word. You can't force 'im," shouted
Hal Hutchings, the tears coursing down his cheeks.</p>

<p>The wild winds swept through the rigging, and the storm came
on with sudden violence.</p>

<p>This was no time for contention with such a spirit as Blair had
displayed, and the captain at once gave orders to make for the
open sea, where he might the more safely abide the approaching
tempest. The Fairport channel had been strewn with too many wrecks
to be ventured without a careful pilot, and of that the English
captain had been fully warned.</p>

<p>Blair and Hal were hastily thrust below, while rapid preparations
were made to meet the coming hour of danger.</p>
