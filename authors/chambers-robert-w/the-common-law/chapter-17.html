<p>The fifteenth day of her absence had come and gone and there
had been no word from her.</p>

<p>Whether or not he had permitted himself to expect any, the suspense
had been none the less almost unendurable. He walked the floor
of the studio all day long, scarcely knowing what he was about,
insensible to fatigue or to anything except the dull, ceaseless
beating of his heart. He seemed older, thinner:&mdash;a man whose sands
were running very swiftly.</p>

<p>With the dawn of the fifteenth day of her absence a gray pallor
had come into his face; and it remained there. Ogilvy and Annan
sauntered into the studio to visit him, twice, and the second
time they arrived bearing gifts&mdash;favourite tonics, prescriptions,
and pills.</p>

<p>"You look like hell, Kelly," observed Sam with tactful and characteristic
frankness. "Try a few of this assorted dope. Harry and I dote
on dope:</p>

<p>&mdash;he sang, waltzing slowly around the room with Annan until,
inadvertently, they stepped upon the tail of Gladys who went off
like a pack of wet fire-crackers; whereupon they retired in confusion
to their respective abodes above.</p>

<p>Evening came, and with evening, letters; but none from her. And
slowly the stealthy twilight hours dragged their heavy minutes
toward darkness; and night crawled into the room like some sinister
living thing, and found him still pacing the floor.</p>

<p>Through the dusky June silence far below in the street sounded
the clatter of wheels; but they never stopped before his abode.
Voices rose faintly at moments in the still air, borne upward
as from infinite depths; but her voice would never sound again
for him: he knew it now&mdash;never again for him. And yet he paced
the floor, listening. The pain in his heart grew duller at intervals,
benumbed by the tension; but it always returned, sickening him,
almost crazing him.</p>

<p>Late in the evening he gave way under the torture&mdash;turned coward,
and started to write to her. Twice he began letters&mdash;pleading
with her to forget his letter; begging her to come back. And destroyed
them with hands that shook like the hands of a sick man. Then
the dull insensibility to pain gave him a little respite, but
later the misery and terror of it drove him out into the street
with an insane idea of seeking her&mdash;of taking the train and finding
her.</p>

<p>He throttled that impulse; the struggle exhausted him; and he
returned, listlessly, to the door and stood there, vacant-eyed,
staring into the lamp-lit street.</p>

<p>Once he caught sight of a shadowy, graceful figure crossing the
avenue&mdash;a lithe young silhouette against the gas-light&mdash;and his
heart stood still for an instant but it was not she, and he swayed
where he stood, under the agony of reaction, dazed by the rushing
recession of emotion.</p>

<p>Then a sudden fear seized him that she might have come while
he had been away. He had been as far as the avenue. Could she
have come?</p>

<p>But when he arrived at his door he had scarce courage enough
to go in. She had a key; she might have entered. Had she entered:
was she there, behind the closed door? To go in and find the studio
empty seemed almost more than he could endure. But, at last, he
went in; and he found the studio empty.</p>

<p>Confused, shaken, tortured, he began again his aimless tour of
the place, ranging the four walls like a wild creature dulled
to insanity by long imprisonment&mdash;passing backward, forward, to
and fro, across, around his footsteps timing the dreadful monotone
of his heart, his pulse beating, thudding out his doom.</p>

<p>She would never come; never come again. She had determined what
was best to do; she had arrived at her decision. Perhaps his letter
had convinced her,&mdash;had cleared her vision;&mdash;the letter which
he had been man enough to write&mdash;fool enough &mdash;God!&mdash;perhaps
brave enough.... But if what he had done in his madness was bravery,
it was an accursed thing; and he set his teeth and cursed himself
scarce knowing what he was saying.</p>

<p>It promised to be an endless night for him; and there were other
nights to come&mdash;interminable nights. And now he began to watch
the clock&mdash;strained eyes riveted on the stiff gilded hands&mdash;and
on the little one jerkily, pitilessly recording the seconds and
twitching them one by one into eternity.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to midnight crept the gilded, flamboyant hour-hand;
the gaunter minute-hand was slowly but inexorably overtaking it.
Nearer, nearer, they drew together; then came the ominous click;
a moment's suspense; the high-keyed gong quivered twelve times
under the impact of the tiny steel hammer.</p>

<p>And he never would hear her voice again. And he dropped to his
knees asking mercy on them both.</p>

<p>In his dulled ears still lingered the treble ringing echo of
the bell&mdash;lingered, reiterated, repeated incessantly, until he
thought he was going mad. Then, of a sudden, he realised that
the telephone was ringing; and he reeled from his knees to his
feet, and crept forward into the shadows, feeling his way like
a blind man.</p>

<p>"Louis?"</p>

<p>But he could not utter a sound.</p>

<p>"Louis, is it you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he whispered.</p>

<p>"What is the matter? Are you ill? Your voice is so strange. <em>Are</em>
you?"</p>

<p>"No! &mdash;Is it <em>you</em>, Valerie?"</p>

<p>"You know it is!"</p>

<p>"Where&mdash;are you?"</p>

<p>"In my room&mdash;where I have been all day."</p>

<p>"You have been&mdash;<em>there</em>! You have been <em>here</em>&mdash;in
the city&mdash;all this time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I came in on the morning train. I wanted to be sure. There <em>have</em>
been such things as railroad delays you know."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;<em>why</em> didn't you let me know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Louis! You will please to recollect that I had until midnight
... <em>I&mdash;</em>was busy. Besides, midnight has just sounded&mdash;and
here I am."</p>

<p>He waited.</p>

<p>"I received your letter." Her voice had the sweet, familiar,
rising inflection which seemed to invite an answer.</p>

<p>"Yes," he muttered, "I wrote to you."</p>

<p>"Do you wish to know what I thought of your letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he breathed.</p>

<p>"I will tell you some other time; not now.... Have you been perfectly
well, Louis? But I heard all about you, every day,&mdash;through Rita.
Do you know I am quite mad to see that picture you painted of
her,&mdash;the new one&mdash;'Womanhood.' She says it is a great picture&mdash;really
great. Is it?"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"Louis!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I would like to see that picture."</p>

<p>"Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Yes?"&mdash;sweetly impatient.</p>

<p>"Are we to see each other again?"</p>

<p>She said calmly: "I didn't ask to see <em>you</em>, Louis: I
asked to see a picture which you recently painted, called 'Womanhood.'"</p>

<p>He remained silent and presently she called him again by name:
"You say that you are well&mdash;or rather Rita said so two days ago&mdash;and
I'm wondering whether in the interim you've fallen ill? Two days
without news from you is rather disquieting. Please tell me at
once exactly how you are?"</p>

<p>He succeeded in forcing something resembling a laugh: "I am all
right," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you could be&mdash;after the letter you wrote me.
How much of it did you mean?"</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"Louis! Answer me!"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;of it," he managed to reply.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She knelt down beside the bed and ... said whatever
prayer she had in mind"]</p>

<p>"<em>All!</em>"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;perhaps you scarcely expected me to call up to-night.
Did you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Suppose I had not done so."</p>

<p>He shivered slightly, but remained mute.</p>

<p>"Answer me, Louis?"</p>

<p>"It would have been&mdash;better."</p>

<p>"For you?"</p>

<p>"For&mdash;both."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;have I any choice except to say&mdash;good-night?"</p>

<p>"No choice. Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>He crept, shaking, into his bed-room, sat down, resting his hands
on his knees and staring at vacancy.</p>

<p>Valerie, in her room, hung up the receiver, buried her face in
her hands for a moment, then quietly turned, lowering her hands
from her face, and looked down at the delicate, intimate garments
spread in order on the counterpane beside her. There was a new
summer gown there, too&mdash;a light, dainty, fragile affair on which
she had worked while away. Beside it lay a big summer hat of white
straw and white lilacs.</p>

<p>She stood for a moment, reflecting; then she knelt down beside
the bed and covered her eyes again while she said whatever prayer
she had in mind.</p>

<p>It was not a very short petition, because it concerned Neville.
She asked nothing for herself except as it regarded him or might
matter to his peace of mind. Otherwise what she said, asked, and
offered, related wholly to Neville.</p>

<p>Presently she rose and went lightly and silently about her ablutions;
and afterward she dressed herself in the fragile snowy garments
ranged so methodically upon the white counterpane, each in its
proper place.</p>

<p>She was longer over her hair, letting it fall in a dark lustrous
cloud to her waist, then combing and gathering it and bringing
it under discipline.</p>

<p>She put on her gown, managing somehow to fasten it, her lithe
young body and slender arms aiding her to achieve the impossible
between neck and shoulders. Afterward she pinned on her big white
hat.</p>

<p>At the door she paused for a second; took a last look at the
quiet, white little room tranquil and silent in the lamplight;
then she turned off the light and went out, softly, holding in
her hands a key which fitted no door of her own.</p>

<p>One o'clock sounded heavily from Saint Hilda's as she left her
house; the half hour was striking as she stooped in the dark hallway
outside the studio and fitted the key she held&mdash;the key that was
to unlock for her the mystery of the world.</p>

<p>He had not heard her. She groped her way into the unlighted studio,
touched with caressing finger-tips the vague familiar shapes that
the starlight, falling through the glass above, revealed to her
as she passed.</p>

<p>In the little inner room she paused. There was a light through
the passageway beyond, but she stood here a moment, looking around
her while memories of the place deepened the colour in her cheeks.</p>

<p>Then she went forward, timidly, and stood at his closed door,
listening.</p>

<p>A sudden fright seized her; one hand flew to her breast, her
throat&mdash;covered her eyes for a moment&mdash;and fell limp by her side.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She was longer over her hair ... gathering it
and bringing it under discipline."]</p>

<p>"Louis!" she faltered. She heard him spring to his feet and stand
as though transfixed.</p>

<p>"Louis," she said, "it is I. Will you open your door to me?"</p>

<p>The sudden flood of electric light dazzled her; then she saw
him standing there, one hand still resting on the door knob.</p>

<p>"I've come," she said, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Valerie! My God!"</p>

<p>She stood, half smiling, half fearful, her dark eyes meeting
his, two friendly little hands outstretched. Then, as his own
caught them, almost crushed them:</p>

<p>"Oh, it was <em>your</em> letter that ended all for me, Louis!
It settled every doubt I had. I <em>knew</em> then&mdash;you darling!"</p>

<p>She bent and touched his hands with her lips, then lifted her
sweet, untroubled gaze to his:</p>

<p>"I had been away from you so long, so long. And the time was
approaching for me to decide, and I didn't know what was best
for us, any more than when I went away. And <em>then</em>!&mdash;your
letter came!"</p>

<p>She shook her head, slowly:</p>

<p>"I don't know what I might have decided if you never had written
that letter to me; probably I would have come back to you anyway.
I think so; I can't think of my doing anything else: though I
<em>might</em> have decided&mdash;against myself. But as soon as I
read your letter I <em>knew</em>, Louis.... And I am here."</p>

<p>He said with drawn lips quivering:</p>

<p>"Did you read in that letter one single word of cowardly appeal?&mdash;one
infamous word of self? If you did, I wrote in vain."</p>

<p>"It was because I read nothing in it of self that I made up my
mind, Louis." She stepped nearer. "Why are you so dreadfully pale
and worn? Your face is so haggard&mdash;so terrible&mdash;"</p>

<p>She laid one hand on his shoulder, looking up at him; then she
smoothed his forehead and hair, lightly.</p>

<p>"As though I could ever live without you," she said under her
breath. Then she laughed, releasing her hands, and went over to
the dresser where there was a mirror.</p>

<p>"I have come, at one in the morning, to pay you a call," she
said, withdrawing the long pins from her hat and taking it off.
"Later I should like a cup of chocolate, please.... Oh, there
is Gladys! You sweet thing!" she cried softly, kneeling to embrace
the cat who came silently into the room, tail waving aloft in
gentle greeting.</p>

<p>The girl lifted Gladys onto the bed and rolled her over into
a fluffy ball and rubbed her cheeks and her ears until her furry
toes curled, and her loud and grateful purring filled the room.</p>

<p>Valerie, seated sideways on the edge of the bed, looked up at
Neville, laughing:</p>

<p>"I <em>must</em> tell you about Sam and Hélène," she said. "They
are too funny! Hélène was furious because Sam wrote her a letter
saying that he intended to marry her but had not the courage to
notify her, personally, of his decision; and Hélène was wild,
and wrote him that he might save himself further trouble in the
matter. And they've been telephoning to each other at intervals
all day, and Sam is so afraid of her that he dare not go to see
her; and Hélène was in tears when I saw her&mdash;and I <em>think</em>
it was because she was afraid Sam wouldn't come and resume the
quarrel where she could manage it and him more satisfactorily."</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed at the recollection, stroking
Gladys the while:</p>

<p>"It will come out all right, of course," she added, her eyes
full of laughter; "she's been in love with Sam ever since he broke
a Ming jar and almost died of fright. But isn't it funny, Louis?&mdash;the
way people fall in love, and their various manners of informing
each other!"</p>

<p>He was trying to smile, but the gray constraint in his face made
it only an effort. Valerie pretended not to notice it, and she
rattled on gaily, detailing her small budget of gossip and caressing
Gladys&mdash;behaving as irresponsibly and as capriciously as though
her heart were not singing a ceaseless hymn of happiness too deep,
too thankful to utter by word or look.</p>

<p>"Dear little Rita," she exclaimed, suddenly and tenderly solemn&mdash;"I
saw her the morning of the day she departed with John. And first
of all I asked about you of course&mdash;you spoiled thing!&mdash;and then
I asked about John. And we put our arms around each other and
had a good, old-fashioned cry.... But&mdash;<em>don't</em> you think
he is going to get well, Louis?"</p>

<p>"Sam's brother &mdash;Billy Ogilvy&mdash;wrote me that he would always
have to live in Arizona. He <em>can</em> live there. But the East
would be death to him."</p>

<p>"Can't he ever come back?" she asked pitifully.</p>

<p>"No, dear."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but what will Rita do?"</p>

<p>He said: "I think that will depend on Rita. I think it depends
on her already."</p>

<p>"Why?" she asked, wide-eyed. "Do you believe that John cares
for her?"</p>

<p>"I know he does.... And I haven't much doubt that he wants to
marry her."</p>

<p>"Do you think so? Oh, Louis&mdash;if that is true, what a heavenly
future for Rita!"</p>

<p>"Heavenly? Out in that scorching desert?"</p>

<p>"Do you think she'd care <em>where</em> she was? Kelly, you're
ridiculous!"</p>

<p>"Do you believe that any woman could stand that for the rest
of her life, Valerie?"</p>

<p>She smiled, head lowered, fondling the cat who had gone ecstatically
to sleep.</p>

<p>She said, still smiling: "If a girl is loved she endures some
things; if she loves she endures more. But to a girl who is loved,
and who loves, nothing else matters ... And it would be that way
with Rita"&mdash;she lifted her eyes&mdash;"as it is with me."</p>

<p>He was standing beside her now; she made room on the side of
the bed for him with a little gesture of invitation:</p>

<p>"People who die for each other are less admirable than people
who live for each other. The latter requires the higher type of
courage ... If I go out of your life I am like a dead person to
you&mdash;a little worse in fact. Besides, I've shown the white feather
and run away. That's a cowardly solution of a problem, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Am I a coward if I decide to stand back and give you a chance?"</p>

<p>"You haven't decided to do it," she said cheerfully, lifting
the somnolent cat and hugging it.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I have, dear."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You read my letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes and kissed every line in it."</p>

<p>He retained sufficient self-control to keep his hands off her&mdash;but
that was all; and her eyes, which were looking into his, grew
serious and beautiful.</p>

<p>"I love you so," she breathed.</p>

<p>"I love you, Valerie."</p>

<p>"Yes.... I know it.... I know you do...." She sat musing a moment,
then: "And I thought that I knew what it was to love, before you
wrote that letter." She shook her head, murmuring something to
herself. Then the swift smile curved her lips again, she dumped
Gladys out of her lap without ceremony, and leaned her shoulder
on Neville's, resting her cheek lightly against his:</p>

<p>"It doesn't seem possible that the problem of life has really
been solved for us, Louis. I can scarcely realise it&mdash;scarcely
understand what this heavenly relief means&mdash;this utterly blissful
relaxation and untroubled confidence. There isn't anything in
the world that can harm me, now; is there?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Nor my soul?"</p>

<p>"It has always been beyond danger."</p>

<p>"There are those who might tell me differently."</p>

<p>"Let them talk. I <em>know</em>."</p>

<p>"Do you?&mdash;you darling!" Her soft, fragrant mouth touched his
cheek, lingered, then she laughed to herself for the very happiness
of living.</p>

<p>"Isn't it wonderful how a word sometimes shatters the fixed ideas
that a girl has arrived at through prayer and fasting? I am beginning
to think that no real intelligence can remain very long welded
to any one fixed belief."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Valerie?" She rested her head on his shoulder
and sat considering, eyes remote; then her white fingers crept
into his:</p>

<p>"We won't talk about it now. I was wrong in some ways. You or
common sense&mdash;or something&mdash;opened my eyes.... But we won't talk
about it now.... Because there are still perplexities&mdash;some few....
We'll go over them together&mdash;and arrange matters&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>"What matters?"</p>

<p>But she placed a soft hand over his lips, imposing silence, and
drew his arm around her with a little sigh of content.</p>

<p>Presently she said: "Have you noticed my gown? I made it."</p>

<p>He smiled and bent forward to look.</p>

<p>"I made <em>everything</em> that I am wearing&mdash;except the shoes
and stockings. But they are perfectly new.... I wanted to come
to you&mdash;perfectly new. There was a Valerie who didn't really love
you. She thought she did, but she didn't.... So I left her behind
when I came&mdash;left everything about her behind me. I am all new,
Louis.... Are you afraid to love me?"</p>

<p>He drew her closer; she turned, partly, and put both arms around
his neck, and their lips touched and clung.</p>

<p>Then, a little pale, she drew away from him, a vague smile tremulous
on her lips. The confused sweetness of her eyes held him breathless
with their enchantment; the faint fragrance of her dazed him.</p>

<p>In silence she bent her head, remained curbed, motionless for
a few moments, then slowly lifted her eyes to his.</p>

<p>"How much do you want me, Louis?"</p>

<p>"You know."</p>

<p>"Enough to&mdash;give me up?"</p>

<p>His lips stiffened and refused at first, then:</p>

<p>"Yes," they motioned. And she saw the word they formed.</p>

<p>"I knew it," she breathed; "I only wanted to hear you say it
again.... I don't know why I'm crying;&mdash;do you?... What a perfect
ninny a girl can be when she tries to.... <em>All</em> over your
'collar, too.... And now you're what Mr. Mantalini would call
'demned moist and unpleasant!' ... I &mdash;I don't want to&mdash;s-sob&mdash;this
way! I do-don't wish to ... M-make me stop, Louis!... I'd like
a handkerchief&mdash;anything&mdash;give me Gladys and I'll staunch my tears
on her!"</p>

<p>She slipped from the bed's edge to the floor, and stood with
her back toward him. Then she glanced sideways at the mirror to
inspect her nose.</p>

<p>"Thank goodness <em>that</em> isn't red," she said gaily....
"Kelly, I'm hungry.... I've fasted since dawn&mdash;on this day&mdash;because
I wanted to break bread with you on the first day of our new life
together."</p>

<p>He looked at her, appalled, but she laughed and went into the
studio. There was a beautiful old sideboard there always well
stocked.</p>

<p>He turned on the lights, brought peaches and melons and strawberries
and milk from the ice-chest, and found her already preparing chocolate
over the electric grill and buttering immense slices of peasant
bread.</p>

<p>"It's after two o'clock," she said, delighted. "Isn't this divinely
silly? I wonder if there happens to be any salad in the ice-chest?"</p>

<p>"Cold chicken, too," he nodded, watching her set the table.</p>

<p>She glanced at him over her shoulder from time to time:</p>

<p>"Louis, are you going to enjoy all this? <em>All of</em> it?
You&mdash;somehow&mdash;don't look entirely happy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am.... All I wanted was to see you&mdash;hear your voice.... I
shall be contented now."</p>

<p>"With just a view of me, and the sound of my voice?"</p>

<p>"You know there is&mdash;nothing more for us."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the kind. The idea! And don't you dare struggle
and kick and scream when I kiss you. Do you hear me, Louis?"</p>

<p>He laughed and watched her as she went swiftly and gracefully
about the table arrangement, glancing up at him from moment to
moment.</p>

<p>"The idea," she repeated, indignantly. "I guess I'll kiss you
when I choose to. You are not in holy orders, are you? You haven't
made any particular vows, have you&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"One."</p>

<p>She halted, looked at him, then went on with her labours, a delicate
colour flushing face and neck.</p>

<p>"Where in the world is that salad, Louis? A hungry girl asks
you! Don't drive me to desperation&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are we going to have coffee?"</p>

<p>"No, it will keep us awake all night! I believe you <em>are</em>
bent on my destruction." And, as she hovered over the table, she
hummed the latest popular summer-roof ballad:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Stand back! Go 'way!<br/>
I can no longer stay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you are a Marquis or a Earl!<br/>
You may tempt the upper classes<br/>
With your villainous demi-tasses<br/>
But&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven will protect the Working Girl!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>At length everything was ready. He had placed two chairs opposite
one another, but she wouldn't have it, and made him lug up a bench,
lay a cushion on it, and sit beside her.</p>

<p>They behaved foolishly; she fed him strawberries at intervals,
discreetly, on a fork&mdash;and otherwise.</p>

<p>"Think of it! Fruit&mdash;at three in the morning, Louis! I hope Heaven
will protect <em>this</em> working girl.... No, dear, I'd rather
not have any champagne.... You forget that this is a brand-new
girl you're supping with ... And, for reasons of her own&mdash;perhaps
as an example to you&mdash;there is never again to be anything like
that&mdash;not even a cigarette."</p>

<p>"Nonsense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's on account of my voice, not my morals, goose! I have
rather a nice voice you know, and, if we can afford it, it would
be a jolly good idea to have it cultivated ...Isn't this melon
divine! What fun, Louis!... I believe you <em>are</em> a little
happier. That crease between your eyes has quite disappeared &mdash;There!
Don't dare let it come back! It has no business there I tell you.
I <em>know</em> it hasn't&mdash;and you must trust my word. Will you?"</p>

<p>She leaned swiftly toward him, placed both hands on his shoulders.</p>

<p>"You've a perfectly new girl to deal with," she said, looking
him in the eyes;&mdash;"a miracle of meekness and patience that is
rather certain to turn into a dreadful, frowsy old hausfrau some
day. But that's the kind you wanted.... It's none of my doings&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You darling!&mdash;do you mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>She closed his lips with hers.</p>

<p>"Silence," she said; "we have plenty to talk over before the
hour arrives for me to be a door-mat. I <em>won't</em> be a door-mat
when I'm trying to be happy over a perfectly good supper!... Besides
I want to torture you while there's still time. I want to make
you miserable by reminding you how disgracefully unmoral we are,
here in your studio together at three in the morning&mdash;" She stretched
out a slim, white ringless hand, and lifted the third finger for
his inspection:</p>

<p>"Not a sign of a ring! Shame!" She turned her pretty, daring
face to his, eyes sparkling with audacity:</p>

<p>"Besides, I'm not going back to-night."</p>

<p>He said tranquilly: "I should think not."</p>

<p>"I mean it, Kelly, I simply won't go. And you may ring up the
police and every ambulance in town&mdash;and the fire department&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've done it," he said, "but the fire department refuses to
put you out.... You don't mean to say you've finished!&mdash;after
fasting all day like a little idiot," he exclaimed as she sprang
to her feet and pushed away her chair.</p>

<p>"I have. I am <em>not</em> an anaconda!" ... She passed swiftly
into the outer room where her own toilet necessaries were always
ready, and presently came back, leisurely, her hands behind her
back, sauntering toward, him with a provoking smile edging her
lips:</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Yes,' she said, 'it is really great.'"]</p>

<p>"You may retire when you like, Kelly, and tie your red cotton
night-cap under your chin. <em>I</em> shall sit up for the sun.
It's due in about an hour, you know."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said. "We'll both, be dead in the morning."</p>

<p>"You offer me your guest-room?" she said in pretence of surprise.
"How <em>very</em> nice of you, Mr. Neville. <em>I&mdash;</em>ah&mdash;will
condescend to occupy it&mdash;for this evening only&mdash;" Her eyes brightened
into laughter: "Oh, isn't it delicious, Louis! Isn't it perfectly
heavenly to <em>know</em> that we are utterly and absolutely all
right,&mdash;and to know that the world outside would be perfectly
certain that we are not? What a darling you are!"</p>

<p>Still holding her hands behind her back she bent forward and
touched her lips to his, daintily, fastidious in the light contact,</p>

<p>"Where is that picture of 'Womanhood'?" she asked.</p>

<p>He drew out the easel, adjusting the canvas to the light, and
rolled a big chair up in front of it.</p>

<p>"Please sit there," she said; and seated herself on the padded
arm, still keeping her hands behind her back.</p>

<p>"Are you concealing anything from me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I want to look at your picture," she added slowly
as her eyes fell upon the canvas.</p>

<p>Minute after minute she sat there in silence, neither stirring
nor offering comment. And after a long time he moved restlessly
in the depths of the chair beside her.</p>

<p>Then she turned and looked down at him:</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it is really great.... And, <em>somehow</em>,
I am lonely. Take me, Louis."</p>

<p>He drew her into his arms. She lay very silent against his breast
for a while, and at last raised her curiously troubled eyes.</p>

<p>"You are going to be a very, very great painter, aren't you,
Louis?"</p>

<p>He laughed and kissed her, watching her face.</p>

<p>"Don't be too great&mdash;so great that I shall feel too&mdash;too lonely,"
she whispered.</p>

<p>Then his eyes fell upon the ring which he had given her&mdash;and
which she had gently put aside. She was wearing it on her betrothal
finger.</p>

<p>"Where did you&mdash;find it?" he said unsteadily.</p>

<p>"In its box on your dresser."</p>

<p>"Do you realise what it means?"</p>

<p>"Yes.... And I am wearing it."</p>

<p>"Valerie!"</p>

<p>Her head nestled closer:</p>

<p>"Because I am going to marry you, Louis.... You were right....
If I fail, as your wife, to win my way in your world, then it
will be because I have attempted the impossible. Which is no crime....
Who was it said 'Not failure, but low aim is crime'?"</p>

<p>She sighed, nestling closer like a child seeking rest:</p>

<p>"I am not coward enough to run away from you and destiny....
And if I stay, only two ways remain.... And the lawful is the
better for us both...." She laid her flushed cheek against his:
"Because," she said dreamily, "there is one thing of which I never
thought&mdash;children.... And I don't, perhaps, exactly understand,
but I realise that&mdash;such things have happened;&mdash;and that it could
happen to&mdash;us."</p>

<p>She lay silent for a while, her fingers restless on his shoulder;
then she spoke again in the same dreamy voice of a half-awakened
child:</p>

<p>"Each for the other's sake is not enough. It must be broader,
wider, more generous ... it must be for the sake of all.... I
have learned this.... We can learn it better together.... Louis,
can you guess what I did the day your letter came to me at Estwich?"</p>

<p>"What did you do, my darling?"</p>

<p>"I went to Ashuelyn."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear. If it had not been for your letter which I could
feel against my breast I should have been frightened.... Because
all your family were together under the pergola.... As it was
I could scarcely speak; I gave your mother the letter, and when
she had read it and your father and your sister had read it, I
asked them what I was to do.</p>

<p>"It was so strange and still there under the pergola; and I scarcely
knew what I was saying&mdash;and I didn't realise that there were tears
in my eyes&mdash;until I saw them in your mother's, too.</p>

<p>"Louis! Louis! I wonder if she can really ever care for me!&mdash;she
was so good&mdash;so sweet to me.... And Mrs. Collis took me away to
her own room&mdash;after your father had shaken hands with me&mdash;very
stiffly but I think kindly&mdash;and I behaved very badly, dear&mdash;and
your sister let me cry&mdash;all that I needed to."</p>

<p>She said nothing more for a while, resting in his arms, dark
eyes fixed on space. Then:</p>

<p>"They asked me to remain; your brother-in-law is a dear!&mdash;but
I still had a long day of self-examination before me. Your father
and mother walked with me to the gate. Your mother kissed me."</p>

<p>His eyes, blinded by tears, scarcely saw her; and she turned
her head and smiled at him.</p>

<p>"What they said to me was <em>very</em> sweet and patient, Louis....
I believe &mdash;I sometimes believe that I may, in time, win
more than their consent, I believe that, some day, they will care
to think of me as your wife&mdash;and think of me as such, kindly,
without regret for what might have been if I had never known you."</p>
