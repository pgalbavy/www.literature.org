<p>Following the escape of their human victim, the wolves had maintained
a frightful and most discordant howling, as if angered beyond
expression at the style in which they had been baffled of their
prey.</p>

<p>The lad sat listening to this, when suddenly it ceased. Silence
from each beast came as completely and simultaneously as if they
were members of an orchestra subject to the wand of such an enchanter
as Theodore Thomas. What could it be?</p>

<p>For the space of two or three minutes the silence remained as
profound as that of the tomb, and then there came a rush and patter,
made by the wolves as they fled pell-mell.</p>

<p>At first sight this seemed a reason for congratulation in getting
rid of such unwelcome company; but Fred saw in it more cause for
alarm. Very evidently the creatures would not have left the spot
in such a hurry unless they were frightened away by some wild
animal more to be dreaded than themselves.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'll have to use my rifle," he thought, as he moved
softly downward until he reached a point from which he could see
anything that passed beneath. "It's pretty rough to have to fire
a fellow's last shot, when he's likely to starve to death for
it; but a beast that can scare away a pack of wolves is likely
to be one that will take a well-aimed bullet to stop&#11834;"</p>

<p>This train of thought was abruptly checked by a sight which almost
paralyzed him. He could dimly discern the ground beneath, and
he was watching and listening when a large figure came to view,
and halted directly beneath him, where the first wolf had sat
upon his haunches and looked so longingly upward.</p>

<p>No noise could be heard and it seemed to move like a phantom;
but, even in the gloom, the peculiar swinging motion of the body
showed prodigious strength and activity. There could be no doubt,
either, that the animal was a climber, and therefore more to be
feared than a thousand wolves.</p>

<p>Fred had gained quite a knowledge of the animals of the country
on his way across the plains, and in the indistinct view obtained
he made up his mind that this was that most dangerous of wild
beasts in the Southwest, the American cougar. If such were the
case, the lad's only defense lay in the single charge of his rifle.
The cougar could leap among the limbs as easily as a cat bounds
from the floor into the chair.</p>

<p>Fred had left his rifle beyond his reach, and he was about to
climb up to it, when the possibility occurred to him that, perhaps,
the cougar was not aware that any one was in the tree, and, if
unmolested might pass by. Accordingly, the fugitive remained as
motionless as a statue, his eyes fixed upon the dreaded brute,
ready to make for his gun the instant the cougar showed any sign
of making for him.</p>

<p>The animal, known in some parts of the country as the panther,
or "painter," remained equally motionless. It looked precisely
as if he suspected that something was in the wind and had slipped
up to this point to listen for some evidence of what it was. Fred,
who had heard fabulous stories of the "smelling" powers of all
wild animals, feared that the cougar would scent him out, but
he showed no evidence of his ability to do so.</p>

<p>After remaining stationary a minute or two, he moved forward
a couple of steps, and then paused as before. The lad was fearful
that this was an indication that he had detected his presence
in the tree and was about to make his leap; but, preliminary to
doing so, all such animals squat upon their haunches, and pick
out a perch at which to aim. This he had not done, and the boy
waited for it before changing his own position.</p>

<p>The head of the cougar was close to the trunk of the tree, and
he had maintained the attitude hut a few seconds when he started
forward again and continued until he vanished from view.</p>

<p>"I hope he is gone," was the wish that came to Fred, as he peered
through the leaves, in his effort to catch a glimpse of him.</p>

<p>But the intervening leaves prevented, and he saw him no more.</p>

<p>He remained where he was for some time, on the look-out for the
beast, but finally climbed back to his former place, where his
gun was within reach, and where he disposed of himself as comfortably
as possible.</p>

<p>In less than ten minutes thereafter, the whole pack of wolves
were back again. The cougar had departed, and they returned to
claim their breakfast. They were somewhat less demonstrative in
their manner, as though they did not wish to bring the panther
back again.</p>

<p>They were scarcely upon the ground, however, when Fred noticed
that it was growing light in the east. The long, terrible night,
the most dreadful of his life, was about over, and he welcomed
the coming day as the shipwrecked mariner does the approach of
the friendly sail.</p>

<p>The light rapidly increased, and in a short time the sun itself
appeared, driving the darkness from the mountain and bathing all
in its rosy hues.</p>

<p>The wolves seemed to dread its coming somewhat as they did that
of the cougar. By the time the morning was fairly upon them, one
of them slunk away. Another speedily followed, and it soon became
a stampede.</p>

<p>Fred waited awhile, and then peered out. Not a wolf was to be
seen, and he concluded it was safe to descend.</p>

<p>He made several careful surveys of his surroundings before trusting
his feet on solid ground again. When he found himself there he
grasped his rifle firmly, half expecting the formidable cougar
to pounce upon him from some hiding-place; but everything remained
quiet, and he finally ventured to move off toward the eastward,
feeling quite nervous until he had gone a couple of hundred yards,
and was given some assurance that no wild beasts held him in sight.</p>

<p>Now that the lad had some opportunity to gather his wits, he
paused to consider what was best to do, for with the coming of
daylight came the necessity for serious work. His disposition
was to return to the ravine, which he had left for the purpose
of seeking a sleeping-place, and to press homeward as rapidly
as possible. There was no time to be lost, for many a long and
wearisome mile lay between him and New Boston.</p>

<p>As was natural, Fred was hungry again, but he resolved to make
no attempt to secure food until night-fall, and to spend the intervening
time in traveling. Of course, if a camp-fire should come in his
way, where he was likely to find any remnants of food, he did
not intend to pass it by; but his wish was to improve the day
while it lasted. By taking to the ravine again, he entered upon
the Apache highway, where he was likely, at any moment, and especially
at the sharp turns, to come in collision with the red men, but
the advantage was too great to overlook, and he hoped by the exercise
of unusual care to keep out of all such peril.</p>

<p>He was on the margin of the plateau, and before returning to
the gorge he thought it best to venture upon a little exploration
of his own. Possibly he might stumble upon some narrower pass,
one unfit for horses, which would afford him a chance of getting
out of the mountains without the great risk of meeting his old
enemies.</p>

<p>For a short distance, the way was so broken that his progress
was slow. He found himself clambering up a ledge of rocks, then
he was forced to make his way around some massive boulders, and
in picking his way along a steep place, the gravelly earth gave
way beneath his weight, and he slid fully a hundred feet before
he could check himself. His descent was so gradual that he was
not bruised in the slightest, but he was nearly buried beneath
the gravel and dirt that came rattling down after him.</p>

<p>"I wish I could travel all the way home that way," he laughed,
as he picked himself up. "I would soon get there, and wouldn't
have to work very hard, either."</p>

<p>But this was not very profitable work, and when he had quaffed
his fill from a small rivulet of icy-cold water, he was conscious
of the importance of going forward without any further delay.</p>

<p>"I guess the best thing I can do is to get back in that ravine
or pass without any more foolery. It looks as though the way was
open ahead yonder."</p>

<p>It was useless to attempt to retrace his steps, for it was impossible
to climb up that incline, which came so near burying him out of
sight, so he moved forward, with rocks all around him&mdash;right,
left, in the rear, and in the front. There was considerable stunted
vegetation, also, and, as the day was quite warm, and no wind
could reach him, he found the labor of traveling with a heavy
rifle anything but fun. Still, he had no thought of giving up,
or even halting to rest, so long as his strength held out, and
he kept it up until he concluded that it was about time that he
reached the ravine for which he aimed from the first.</p>

<p>"It must be right ahead, yonder," he said, after pausing to survey
his surroundings. "I've kept going toward it ever since I picked
myself up, and I know I wasn't very far away."</p>

<p>He had been steadily ascending for a half hour, and he believed
that he had nearly reached the level upon which he had spent the
night. His view was so shut in by the character of his surroundings,
that he could recognize nothing, and he was compelled, therefore,
to depend upon his own sagacity.</p>

<p>Fred had enough wit to take every precaution against going astray,
for he had learned long since how liable any one in his circumstances
was to make such a blunder. He fixed the position of the sun with
regard to the ravine, and as the orb was only a short distance
above the horizon, he was confident of keeping his "reckoning."</p>

<p>"That's mighty strange!" he exclaimed, when, having climbed up
the place he had fixed in his mind, he looked over and found nothing
but a broken country beyond. "There is n't anything there that
looks like the pass I'm looking for."</p>

<p>He took note of the position of the sun, and then carefully recalled
the direction of the ravine with regard to that, and he could
discover no error in the course which he had followed. According
to the reasoning of common sense, he ought to strike it at right
angles. But just then he recalled that the gorge did not follow
a straight line. Had it done so, he would have succeeded in what
he had undertaken, but it was otherwise, and so he failed.</p>

<p>"I'll try a little more."</p>

<p>With no little labor, he climbed to an eminence a short distance
away, where he hoped to gain a glimpse of the promised land; but
the most studied scrutiny failed to show anything resembling the
pass.</p>

<p>"I'm lost!" he exclaimed, in despair.</p>
