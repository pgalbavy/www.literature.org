<p>While engaged with his duties in Washington, Commodore Dewey
found his close confinement to work had affected his health. Naturally
strong and rugged, accustomed to the ozone of the ocean and toned
up by the variety of the service, even in times of peace, the
monotony of a continual round of the same duties told upon him,
and his physician advised him to apply for sea service. He knew
the counsel was wise and he made application, which was granted.</p>

<p>Assistant Secretary of War Theodore Roosevelt, after a careful
study of the record of the different naval commanders, was convinced
that George Dewey deserved one of the most important commands
at the disposal of the Government. The impetuous official was
certain that war with Spain was at hand, and that one of the most
effective blows against that tyrannous power could be struck in
the far East, where the group of islands known as the Philippines
constituted her most princely possessions.</p>

<p>The assignment, as has been stated, was not pleasing to Dewey,
because he and others believed the real hard fighting must take
place in European or Atlantic waters. We all know the uneasiness
that prevailed for weeks over the destination of the Spanish fleet
under Admiral Cervera. Dewey wanted to meet him and do some fighting
that would recall his services when a lieutenant in the Civil
War, and he saw no chance of securing the chance on the other
side of the world, but Roosevelt was persistent, and, against
the wishes of the Naval Board, he obtained his assignment as flag
officer of the Asiatic squadron.</p>

<p>Commodore Dewey felt that the first duty of an officer is to
obey, and after a farewell dinner given by his friends at the
Metropolitan Club in Arlington, he hurriedly completed his preparations,
and, starting for Hong Kong, duly reached that port, where, on
January 3, 1898, he hoisted his flag on the <em>Olympia</em>.</p>

<p>The official records show that the <em>Olympia</em> was ordered
home, but Roosevelt, in a confidential dispatch of February 25,
directed Commodore Dewey to remain, to prepare his squadron for
offensive operations, and, as soon as war broke out with Spain,
to steam to the Philippines and hit the enemy as hard as he knew
how. Meanwhile ammunition and supplies were hurried across the
continent to San Francisco as fast as express trains could carry
them, and were sent thence by steamer to Hong Kong, where they
were eagerly received by the waiting Commodore.</p>

<p>Reverting to those stirring days, it will be recalled that the
Queen Regent of Spain declared war against the United States on
April 24, 1898, to which we replied that war had begun three days
earlier, when the Madrid government dismissed our minister and
handed him his passports. Then followed, or rather were continued,
the vigorous preparations on the part of our authorities for the
prosecution of the war to a prompt and decisive end.</p>

<p>Commodore Dewey's squadron lay at anchor in the harbor of Hong
Kong, awaiting the momentous news from Washington. When it reached
the commander it was accompanied by an order to capture or destroy
the enemy's fleet at Manila. Almost at the same time Great Britain
issued her proclamation of neutrality, the terms of which compelled
Dewey to leave the British port of Hong Kong within twenty-four
hours. He did so, steaming to Mirs Bay, a Chinese port near at
hand, where he completed his preparations for battle, and on the
27th of April steamed out of the harbor on his way to Manila.</p>

<p>The city of Manila, with a population numbering about a quarter
of a million, lies on the western side of Luzon, the principal
island, with a magnificent bay in front, extensive enough to permit
all the navies of the world to manoeuvre with plenty of elbow
room. The entrance to the immense bay is seven miles wide and
contains two islands, Corregidor and Caballo, both of which were
powerfully fortified, the works containing a number of modern
guns. Torpedoes were stretched across the channel and the bay
abounded with enough mines and torpedoes, it would seem, to blow
any fleet of ironclads to atoms as soon as it dared to try to
force an entrance into the waters. Some twenty miles beyond lay
the city of Manila, and about ten miles to the south was Cavit√©,
constituting the strongly fortified part of the city proper.</p>

<p>Of course the Spanish spies were on the watch in Hong Kong, and
while the American squadron was steaming out of the bay the news
was telegraphed to the authorities at Manila, who knew that the
real destination of the enemy was that city. Every effort was
made to keep the matter a secret, but it was impossible, and it
soon became known to everybody that the American "pigs" were coming,
and that Manila must fall, if the Spanish fleet were unable to
beat off the enemy.</p>

<p>The Spaniards proclaimed that they would send every one of the
American vessels to the bottom; but they had made similar boasts
before, and their bombast did not quiet the fears of the people,
among whom a panic quickly spread. Those who were able to do so
gathered their valuables and took refuge on the merchant ships
in the harbor and thanked heaven when they bore them away. Many
others fled from the city, but the majority stayed, grimly determined
to be in at the death and accept whatever fate was in store for
them.</p>

<p>The distance between Hong Kong and Manila is 630 miles, and it
needed only a little figuring on the part of the inhabitants to
decide that the dreaded squadron would be due on the following
Saturday evening or early the next morning, which would be the
first of May. The self-confidence of Admiral Montojo and his officers
was almost sublime. All they asked was a fair chance at the "American
pigs." They hoped that nothing would occur to prevent the coming
of the fleet, for the Spaniards would never cease to mourn if
the golden opportunity were allowed to slip from their grasp.
They were not disappointed in that respect.</p>

<p>It is proper to give at this point the respective strength of
the American and Spanish fleets. The squadron under the command
of Commodore Dewey was as follows:</p>

<p>Through the bright sunshine and when the stars twinkled in the
sky or the full moon rode overhead, the American ships steamed
to the southeast across the heaving China Sea. The Stars and Stripes
fluttered in the breeze and there was a feeling of expectancy
on board the grim engines of war, that had laid aside every possible
encumbrance, and like prize-fighters were stripped to the buff
and eager for battle.</p>

<p>The run was a smooth one, and as the sun was sinking in the sky
Commodore Dewey, peering through his glass, caught the faint outlines
of Corregidor Island, and dimly beyond the flickering haze revealed
the Spanish fleet in the calm bay. The Commodore had been in that
part of the world before, and while waiting at Hong Kong had gathered
all the knowledge possible of the defences of Manila. He knew
the fort was powerfully fortified and the bay mined, and knowing
all this, he remembered the exclamation of his immortal instructor
in the science of war, the peerless Farragut, when he was driving
his squadron into Mobile Bay. Recalling that occurrence, Commodore
Dewey joined in spirit in repeating the words:</p>

<p>"<em>D&#11834; </em>the torpedoes!"</p>

<p>It was still many miles to the entrance, and night closed in
while the squadron was ploughing through the sea that broke in
tumbling foam at the bows and spread far away in snowy wakes at
the rear. All lights were put out, the full moon again climbed
the sky and the shadowy leviathans plunged through the waters
straight for the opening of the bay, guarded by the fort and batteries,
with the Spanish fleet beyond, defiantly awaiting the coming of
the American squadron.</p>

<p>Suddenly from Corregidor Island the darkness was lit up by a
vivid flash, a thunderous boom traveled across the bay, and the
heavy shot tore its way screaming over the <em>Raleigh</em>, quickly
followed by a second, which fell astern of the <em>Olympia</em>
and <em>Raleigh</em>. The Spaniards had discovered the approach
of the squadron. The <em>Raleigh</em>, <em>Concord</em>, and <em>Boston</em>
replied; all the shots being fired with remarkable accuracy.</p>

<p>One may imagine the consternation in Manila when the boom of
those guns rolled in from the bay, for none could mistake its
meaning. Women and children ran to the churches and knelt in frenzied
prayer; men dashed to and fro, not knowing what to do, while the
Spanish soldiers, who had not believed the American ships could
ever pass the harbor torpedoes and mines, were in a wild panic
when they learned that the seemingly impossible had been done.
To add to the terror, rumors spread that the ferocious natives
were gathering at the rear of the city to rush in and plunder
and kill.</p>

<p>When at last the morning light appeared in the sky, the Americans
saw tens of thousands of people crowded along the shore, gazing
in terror out on the bay where rode the hostile fleets, soon to
close in deadly battle. Commodore Dewey coolly scanned the hostile
vessels, and grasping the whole situation, as may be said, at
a glance, led in the attack on the enemy.</p>

<p>While approaching Cavit√© two mines exploded directly in front
of the <em>Olympia</em>. The roar was tremendous and the water
was flung hundreds of feet in the air. Without swerving an inch
or halting, Dewey signalled to the other vessels to pay no attention
to the torpedoes, but to steam straight ahead. It was virtually
a repetition of the more emphatic command of Farragut in Mobile
Bay, uttered thirty-four years before.</p>

<p>The batteries on shore let fly at the ships, and the first reply
was made by Captain Coghlan of the <em>Raleigh</em>. The <em>Olympia</em>
had led the way into the harbor, and she now headed for the centre
of the Spanish fleet. Calmly watching everything in his field
of vision, and knowing when the exact moment arrived for the beginning
of the appalling work, Commodore Dewey, cool, alert, attired in
white duck uniform and a golf cap, turned to Captain Gridley and
said in his ordinary conversational tone:</p>

<p>"Gridley, you may fire when ready."</p>

<p>A series of sharp, crackling sounds followed, like exploding
Chinese crackers, and then the thunderous roars and a vast volume
of smoke rolled over the bay and enveloped the warships that were
pouring their deadly fire into the Spanish vessels. The American
ships, in order to disconcert the aim of the batteries of the
enemy, moved slowly in their terrible ellipses or loops, their
sides spouting crimson flame and answered by the shots of the
Spaniards, who fought with a courage deserving of all praise.
The manoeuvring of the American ships led the breathless swarms
on shore to believe they were suffering defeat, and an exultant
telegram to that effect was cabled to Madrid, nearly ten thousand
miles away, where it caused a wild but short-lived rejoicing.</p>

<p>At half-past seven there was a lull. Commodore Dewey drew off
to replenish his magazines, of whose shortness of supply he had
received disturbing reports. Advantage was taken of the cessation
to give the men breakfast, for it is a well accepted principle
that sailors as well as soldiers fight best upon full stomachs.
As the wind blew aside the dense smoke, it was seen that the <em>Reina
Cristina</em>, the Spanish flagship, was in flames. Hardly two
hours later the American squadron advanced again to the attack,
and Admiral Montojo was observed to transfer his flag from the
doomed <em>Reina Cristina</em> to the <em>Isla de Cuba</em>, which
soon after was also ablaze. Amid the crash and roar of the ponderous
guns sounded the shrieks and cries of mortal agony from the Spanish
crews, victims to the matchless gunnery of the Americans.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE "OLYMPIA" IN MANILA BAY</em>.]</p>

<p>The latter pressed their advantage remorselessly. The <em>Don
Juan de Austria</em> was the centre of the heaviest fire, and
suddenly a part of the deck flew upward in the air, carrying with
it scores of dead and wounded. A shot had exploded one of her
magazines, and at the sight of the awful results Admiral Montojo
threw up his arms in despair. The crew refused to leave the blazing
ship, and cursing and praying they went down with her. Then the
<em>Castilla</em> burst into one mass of roaring flame, and the
rest of the defeated fleet skurried down the long narrow isle
behind Cavit√©. Others dashed up a small creek, where they grounded,
and those that were left ran ashore. By half-past eleven the batteries
of Cavit√© were silenced, the Spanish fleet was destroyed, and
the victorious Americans broke into ringing cheers. The battle
of Manila, one of the most remarkable in naval annals, was won
and Commodore Dewey took rank among the greatest of all the heroes
of the sea.</p>

<p>What a marvellous record! Of the Spaniards, the dead and wounded
numbered nearly a thousand, while not a single life had been lost
by the American squadron. Several were wounded, but none seriously.
No such victory between ironclads has thus far taken place in
the history of the world. In the face of mines, torpedoes and
shore batteries, Commodore Dewey had won an overwhelming and crushing
victory. The power of Spain in the Philippines was forever destroyed,
and another glorious victory had been added to the long list that
illumines the story of the American navy.</p>

<p>It was easy for Dewey to compel the surrender of Manila, but
with the prudence that always guides him, he decided that since
his force was not strong enough to occupy and hold the city, to
await the arrival of reinforcements from the United States. They
reached Manila the following August, and, under command of General
Wesley Merritt and aided by the fleet, Manila surrendered, almost
at the same hour that the representatives of Spain and our own
officials in Washington signed the protocol that marked the cessation
of war between the two countries.</p>

<p>Now came long and trying weeks and months to Rear Admiral Dewey,
he having been promoted upon receipt of news of his great victory.
Peerless as was his conduct during offensive operations, it was
surpassed in many respects by his course throughout the exasperating
period named. Germany and France were unfriendly and Aguinaldo
treacherous, though Great Britain and Japan were ardent in their
sympathy for the United States. Germany especially was a constant
cause of irritation to Admiral Dewey, whose patience was often
tried to the utmost verge. To his tact, prudence, self-control,
firmness, diplomacy and masterful wisdom were due the fact that
no complication with foreign powers occurred and that the United
States escaped a tremendous war, whose consequences no one could
foresee or calculate.</p>

<p>Everybody instinctively felt that Admiral Dewey was the real
hero of our war with Spain. The wish was general that he should
return home in order that his countrymen might have opportunity
to show their appreciation of him and to give him fitting honors.</p>

<p>And nothing could be more repugnant than all this to the naval
hero, who is as modest as he is brave. Besides, he felt that his
work was by no means finished in the far East, for, as has been
shown, there was need of delicate diplomacy, prudence and statesmanship.
He asked to be allowed to stay, and he did so, until, the main
difficulty being passed, and his health feeling the result of
the tremendous strain that was never relaxed, he finally set sail
in the <em>Olympia</em> for home, leaving Hong Kong in May, and,
one year after his great victory, proceeding at a leisurely rate
that did not bring him to his native shores until the cool breezes
of autumn. On the long voyage hither he was shown the highest
honors everywhere, and Washington or Lincoln could not have received
more grateful homage than was paid to him by his countrymen, whom
he had served so long, so faithfully and so well.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it should be added, that the rank of full Admiral
of the navy, hitherto borne only by David Glasgow Farragut and
David Dixon Porter, was revived and bestowed, in February, 1899,
upon George Dewey, and of the three none has worn the exalted
honor more worthily than the Green Mountain Boy, who has proven
himself the born gentleman and fighter, the thorough patriot and
statesman and the Chevalier Bayard of the American navy.</p>
