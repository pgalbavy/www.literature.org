<p>THEA had a superstitious feeling about the potsherds, and liked better
to leave them in the dwellings where she found them. If she took a few
bits back to her own lodge and hid them under the blankets, she did it
guiltily, as if she were being watched. She was a guest in these houses,
and ought to behave as such. Nearly every afternoon she went to the
chambers which contained the most interesting fragments of pottery, sat
and looked at them for a while. Some of them were beautifully decorated.
This care, expended upon vessels that could not hold food or water any
better for the additional labor put upon them, made her heart go out to
those ancient potters. They had not only expressed their desire, but
they had expressed it as beautifully as they could. Food, fire, water,
and something else--even here, in this crack in the world, so far back
in the night of the past! Down here at the beginning that painful thing
was already stirring; the seed of sorrow, and of so much delight.
</p><p>There were jars done in a delicate overlay, like pine cones; and there
were many patterns in a low relief, like basket-work. Some of the
pottery was decorated in color, red and brown, black and white, in
graceful geometrical patterns. One day, on a fragment of a shallow bowl,
she found a crested serpent's head, painted in red on terra-cotta. Again
she found half a bowl with a broad band of white cliff-houses painted on
a black ground. They were scarcely conventionalized at all; there they
were in the black border, just as they stood in the rock before her. It
brought her centuries nearer to these people to find that they saw their
houses exactly as she saw them.
</p><p>Yes, Ray Kennedy was right. All these things made one feel that one
ought to do one's best, and help to fulfill some desire of the dust that
slept there. A dream had been dreamed there long ago, in the night of
ages, and the wind had whispered some promise to the sadness of the
savage. In their own way, those people had felt the beginnings of what
was to come. These potsherds were like fetters that bound one to a long
chain of human endeavor.
</p><p>Not only did the world seem older and richer to Thea now, but she
herself seemed older. She had never been alone for so long before, or
thought so much. Nothing had ever engrossed her so deeply as the daily
contemplation of that line of pale-yellow houses tucked into the wrinkle
of the cliff. Moonstone and Chicago had become vague. Here everything
was simple and definite, as things had been in childhood. Her mind was
like a ragbag into which she had been frantically thrusting whatever she
could grab. And here she must throw this lumber away. The things that
were really hers separated themselves from the rest. Her ideas were
simplified, became sharper and clearer. She felt united and strong.
</p>
<p>When Thea had been at the Ottenburg ranch for two months, she got a
letter from Fred announcing that he “might be along at almost any time
now.” The letter came at night, and the next morning she took it down
into the canyon with her. She was delighted that he was coming soon. She
had never felt so grateful to any one, and she wanted to tell him
everything that had happened to her since she had been there--more than
had happened in all her life before. Certainly she liked Fred better
than any one else in the world. There was Harsanyi, of course--but
Harsanyi was always tired. Just now, and here, she wanted some one who
had never been tired, who could catch an idea and run with it.
</p><p>She was ashamed to think what an apprehensive drudge she must always
have seemed to Fred, and she wondered why he had concerned himself about
her at all. Perhaps she would never be so happy or so good-looking
again, and she would like Fred to see her, for once, at her best. She
had not been singing much, but she knew that her voice was more
interesting than it had ever been before. She had begun to understand
that--with her, at least--voice was, first of all, vitality; a lightness
in the body and a driving power in the blood. If she had that, she could
sing. When she felt so keenly alive, lying on that insensible shelf of
stone, when her body bounded like a rubber ball away from its hardness,
then she could sing. This, too, she could explain to Fred. He would know
what she meant.
</p><p>Another week passed. Thea did the same things as before, felt the same
influences, went over the same ideas; but there was a livelier movement
in her thoughts, and a freshening of sensation, like the brightness
which came over the underbrush after a shower. A persistent
affirmation--or denial--was going on in her, like the tapping of the
woodpecker in the one tall pine tree across the chasm. Musical phrases
drove each other rapidly through her mind, and the song of the cicada
was now too long and too sharp. Everything seemed suddenly to take the
form of a desire for action.
</p><p>It was while she was in this abstracted state, waiting for the clock to
strike, that Thea at last made up her mind what she was going to try to
do in the world, and that she was going to Germany to study without
further loss of time. Only by the merest chance had she ever got to
Panther Canyon. There was certainly no kindly Providence that directed
one's life; and one's parents did not in the least care what became of
one, so long as one did not misbehave and endanger their comfort. One's
life was at the mercy of blind chance. She had better take it in her own
hands and lose everything than meekly draw the plough under the rod of
parental guidance. She had seen it when she was at home last
summer,--the hostility of comfortable, self-satisfied people toward any
serious effort. Even to her father it seemed indecorous. Whenever she
spoke seriously, he looked apologetic. Yet she had clung fast to
whatever was left of Moonstone in her mind. No more of that! The
Cliff-Dwellers had lengthened her past. She had older and higher
obligations.
