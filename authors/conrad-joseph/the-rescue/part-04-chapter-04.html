<p>Lingard repeated it all to Mrs. Travers. Her courage, her intelligence,
the quickness of her apprehension, the colour of her eyes and
the intrepidity of her glance evoked in him an admiring enthusiasm.
She stood by his side! Every moment that fatal illusion clung
closer to his soul&mdash;like a garment of light&mdash;like an armour of
fire.</p>

<p>He was unwilling to face the facts. All his life&mdash;till that day&mdash;had
been a wrestle with events in the daylight of this world, but
now he could not bring his mind to the consideration of his position.
It was Mrs. Travers who, after waiting awhile, forced on him the
pain of thought by wanting to know what bearing Hassim's news
had upon the situation.</p>

<p>Lingard had not the slightest doubt Daman wanted him to know
what had been done with the prisoners. That is why Daman had welcomed
Hassim, and let him hear the decision and had allowed him to leave
the camp on the sandbank. There could be only one object in this;
to let him, Lingard, know that the prisoners had been put out
of his reach as long as he remained in his brig. Now this brig
was his strength. To make him leave his brig was like removing
his hand from his sword.</p>

<p>"Do you understand what I mean, Mrs. Travers?" he asked. "They
are afraid of me because I know how to fight this brig. They fear
the brig because when I am on board her, the brig and I are one.
An armed man&mdash;don't you see? Without the brig I am disarmed, without
me she can't strike. So Daman thinks. He does not know everything
but he is not far off the truth. He says to himself that if I
man the boats to go after these whites into the lagoon then his
Illanuns will get the yacht for sure&mdash;and perhaps the brig as
well. If I stop here with my brig he holds the two white men and
can talk as big as he pleases. Belarab believes in me no doubt,
but Daman trusts no man on earth. He simply does not know how
to trust any one, because he is always plotting himself. He came
to help me and as soon as he found I was not there he began to
plot with Tengga. Now he has made a move&mdash;a clever move; a cleverer
move than he thinks. Why? I'll tell you why. Because I, Tom Lingard,
haven't a single white man aboard this brig I can trust. Not one.
I only just discovered my mate's got the notion I am some kind
of pirate. And all your yacht people think the same. It is as
though you had brought a curse on me in your yacht. Nobody believes
me. Good God! What have I come to! Even those two&mdash;look at them
&mdash;I say look at them! By all the stars they doubt me! Me!
. . ."</p>

<p>He pointed at Hassim and Immada. The girl seemed frightened.
Hassim looked on calm and intelligent with inexhaustible patience.
Lingard's voice fell suddenly.</p>

<p>"And by heavens they may be right. Who knows? You? Do you know?
They have waited for years. Look. They are waiting with heavy
hearts. Do you think that I don't care? Ought I to have kept it
all in&mdash;told no one&mdash;no one&mdash;not even you? Are they waiting for
what will never come now?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Travers rose and moved quickly round the table. "Can we
give anything to this&mdash;this Daman or these other men? We could
give them more than they could think of asking. <em>I&mdash;</em>my
husband. . . ."</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me of your husband," he said, roughly. "You don't
know what you are doing." She confronted the sombre anger of his
eyes&mdash;"But I must," she asserted with heat.&mdash;"Must," he mused,
noticing that she was only half a head less tall than himself.
"Must! Oh, yes. Of course, you must. Must! Yes. But I don't want
to hear. Give! What can you give? You may have all the treasures
of the world for all I know. No! You can't give anything. . .
."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of your difficulty when I spoke," she interrupted.
His eyes wandered downward following the line of her shoulder.&mdash;"Of
me&mdash;of me!" he repeated.</p>

<p>All this was said almost in whispers. The sound of slow footsteps
was heard on deck above their heads. Lingard turned his face to
the open skylight.</p>

<p>"On deck there! Any wind?"</p>

<p>All was still for a moment. Somebody above answered in a leisurely
tone:</p>

<p>"A steady little draught from the northward."</p>

<p>Then after a pause added in a mutter:</p>

<p>"Pitch dark."</p>

<p>"Aye, dark enough," murmured Lingard. He must do something. Now.
At once. The world was waiting. The world full of hopes and fear.
What should he do? Instead of answering that question he traced
the ungleaming coils of her twisted hair and became fascinated
by a stray lock at her neck. What should he do? No one to leave
his brig to. The voice that had answered his question was Carter's
voice. "He is hanging about keeping his eye on me," he said to
Mrs. Travers. She shook her head and tried to smile. The man above
coughed discreetly. "No," said Lingard, "you must understand that
you have nothing to give."</p>

<p>The man on deck who seemed to have lingered by the skylight was
heard saying quietly, "I am at hand if you want me, Mrs. Travers."
Hassim and Immada looked up. "You see," exclaimed Lingard. "What
did I tell you? He's keeping his eye on me! On board my own ship.
Am I dreaming? Am I in a fever? Tell him to come down," he said
after a pause. Mrs. Travers did so and Lingard thought her voice
very commanding and very sweet. "There's nothing in the world
I love so much as this brig," he went on. "Nothing in the world.
If I lost her I would have no standing room on the earth for my
feet. You don't understand this. You can't."</p>

<p>Carter came in and shut the cabin door carefully. He looked with
serenity at everyone in turn.</p>

<p>"All quiet?" asked Lingard.</p>

<p>"Quiet enough if you like to call it so," he answered. "But if
you only put your head outside the door you'll hear them all on
the quarter-deck snoring against each other, as if there were
no wives at home and no pirates at sea."</p>

<p>"Look here," said Lingard. "I found out that I can't trust my
mate."</p>

<p>"Can't you?" drawled Carter. "I am not exactly surprised. I must
say <em>he</em> does not snore but I believe it is because he
is too crazy to sleep. He waylaid me on the poop just now and
said something about evil communications corrupting good manners.
Seems to me I've heard that before. Queer thing to say. He tried
to make it out somehow that if he wasn't corrupt it wasn't your
fault. As if this was any concern of mine. He's as mad as he's
fat&mdash;or else he puts it on." Carter laughed a little and leaned
his shoulders against a bulkhead.</p>

<p>Lingard gazed at the woman who expected so much from him and
in the light she seemed to shed he saw himself leading a column
of armed boats to the attack of the Settlement. He could burn
the whole place to the ground and drive every soul of them into
the bush. He could! And there was a surprise, a shock, a vague
horror at the thought of the destructive power of his will. He
could give her ever so many lives. He had seen her yesterday,
and it seemed to him he had been all his life waiting for her
to make a sign. She was very still. He pondered a plan of attack.
He saw smoke and flame&mdash;and next moment he saw himself alone amongst
shapeless ruins with the whispers, with the sigh and moan of the
Shallows in his ears. He shuddered, and shaking his hand:</p>

<p>"No! I cannot give you all those lives!" he cried.</p>

<p>Then, before Mrs. Travers could guess the meaning of this outburst,
he declared that as the two captives must be saved he would go
alone into the lagoon. He could not think of using force. "You
understand why," he said to Mrs. Travers and she whispered a faint
"Yes." He would run the risk alone. His hope was in Belarab being
able to see where his true interest lay. "If I can only get at
him I would soon make him see," he mused aloud. "Haven't I kept
his power up for these two years past? And he knows it, too. He
feels it." Whether he would be allowed to reach Belarab was another
matter. Lingard lost himself in deep thought. "He would not dare,"
he burst out. Mrs. Travers listened with parted lips. Carter did
not move a muscle of his youthful and self-possessed face; only
when Lingard, turning suddenly, came up close to him and asked
with a red flash of eyes and in a lowered voice, "Could you fight
this brig?"  something like a smile made a stir amongst the hairs
of his little fair moustache.</p>

<p>"'Could I?" he said. "I could try, anyhow." He paused, and added
hardly above his breath, "For the lady&mdash;of course."</p>

<p>Lingard seemed staggered as though he had been hit in the chest.
"I was thinking of the brig," he said, gently.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Travers would be on board," retorted Carter.</p>

<p>"What! on board. Ah yes; on board. Where else?" stammered Lingard.</p>

<p>Carter looked at him in amazement. "Fight! You ask!" he said,
slowly. "You just try me."</p>

<p>"I shall," ejaculated Lingard. He left the cabin calling out
"serang!" A thin cracked voice was heard immediately answering,
"Tuan!" and the door slammed to.</p>

<p>"You trust him, Mrs. Travers?" asked Carter, rapidly.</p>

<p>"You do not&mdash;why?" she answered.</p>

<p>"I can't make him out. If he was another kind of man I would
say he was drunk," said Carter. "Why is he here at all&mdash;he, and
this brig of his? Excuse my boldness&mdash;but have you promised him
anything?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I promised!" exclaimed Mrs. Travers in a bitter tone
which silenced Carter for a moment.</p>

<p>"So much the better," he said at last. "Let him show what he
can do first and . . ."</p>

<p>"Here! Take this," said Lingard, who re-entered the cabin fumbling
about his neck. Carter mechanically extended his hand.</p>

<p>"What's this for?" he asked, looking at a small brass key attached
to a thin chain.</p>

<p>"Powder magazine. Trap door under the table. The man who has
this key commands the brig while I am away. The serang understands.
You have her very life in your hand there."</p>

<p>Carter looked at the small key lying in his half-open palm.</p>

<p>"I was just telling Mrs. Travers I didn't trust you&mdash;not altogether.
. . ."</p>

<p>"I know all about it," interrupted Lingard, contemptuously. "You
carry a blamed pistol in your pocket to blow my brains out&mdash;don't
you? What's that to me? I am thinking of the brig. I think I know
your sort. You will do."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I might," mumbled Carter, modestly.</p>

<p>"Don't be rash," said Lingard, anxiously. "If you've got to fight
use your head as well as your hands. If there's a breeze fight
under way. If they should try to board in a calm, trust to the
small arms to hold them off. Keep your head and&mdash;" He looked intensely
into Carter's eyes; his lips worked without a sound as though
he had been suddenly struck dumb. "Don't think about me. What's
that to you who I am? Think of the ship,"  he burst out. "Don't
let her go!  &mdash;Don't let her go!" The passion in his voice
impressed his hearers who for a time preserved a profound silence.</p>

<p>"All right," said Carter at last. "I will stick to your brig
as though she were my own; but I would like to see clear through
all this. Look here&mdash;you are going off somewhere? Alone, you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Alone."</p>

<p>"Very well. Mind, then, that you don't come back with a crowd
of those brown friends of yours&mdash;or by the Heavens above us I
won't let you come within hail of your own ship. Am I to keep
this key?"</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard," said Mrs. Travers suddenly. "Would it not
be better to tell him everything?"</p>

<p>"Tell him everything?" repeated Lingard. "Everything! Yesterday
it might have been done. Only yesterday! Yesterday, did I say?
Only six hours ago&mdash;only six hours ago I had something to tell.
You heard it. And now it's gone. Tell him! There's nothing to
tell any more." He remained for a time with bowed head, while
before him Mrs. Travers, who had begun a gesture of protest, dropped
her arms suddenly. In a moment he looked up again.</p>

<p>"Keep the key," he said, calmly, "and when the time comes step
forward and take charge. I am satisfied."</p>

<p>"I would like to see clear through all this though," muttered
Carter again. "And for how long are you leaving us, Captain?"
Lingard made no answer. Carter waited awhile. "Come, sir," he
urged. "I ought to have some notion. What is it? Two, three days?"
Lingard started.</p>

<p>"Days," he repeated. "Ah, days. What is it you want to know?
Two . . . three&mdash;what did the old fellow say&mdash;perhaps for life."
This was spoken so low that no one but Carter heard the last words.&mdash;"Do
you mean it?"  he murmured. Lingard nodded.&mdash;"Wait as long as
you can&mdash;then go," he said in the same hardly audible voice. "Go
where?"&mdash;"Where you like, nearest port, any port."&mdash;"Very good.
That's something plain at any rate," commented the young man with
imperturbable good humour.</p>

<p>"I go, O Hassim!" began Lingard and the Malay made a slow inclination
of the head which he did not raise again till Lingard had ceased
speaking. He betrayed neither surprise nor any other emotion while
Lingard in a few concise and sharp sentences made him acquainted
with his purpose to bring about singlehanded the release of the
prisoners. When Lingard had ended with the words: "And you must
find a way to help me in the time of trouble, O Rajah Hassim,"
he looked up and said:</p>

<p>"Good. You never asked me for anything before."</p>

<p>He smiled at his white friend. There was something subtle in
the smile and afterward an added firmness in the repose of the
lips. Immada moved a step forward. She looked at Lingard with
terror in her black and dilated eyes. She exclaimed in a voice
whose vibration startled the hearts of all the hearers with an
indefinable sense of alarm, "He will perish, Hassim! He will perish
alone!"</p>

<p>"No," said Hassim. "Thy fear is as vain to-night as it was at
sunrise. He shall not perish alone."</p>

<p>Her eyelids dropped slowly. From her veiled eyes the tears fell,
vanishing in the silence. Lingard's forehead became furrowed by
folds that seemed to contain an infinity of sombre thoughts. "Remember,
O Hassim, that when I promised you to take you back to your country
you promised me to be a friend to all white men. A friend to all
whites who are of my people, forever."</p>

<p>"My memory is good, O Tuan," said Hassim; "I am not yet back
in my country, but is not everyone the ruler of his own heart?
Promises made by a man of noble birth live as long as the speaker
endures."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," said Lingard to Mrs. Travers. "You will be safe here."
He looked all around the cabin. "I leave you," he began again
and stopped short. Mrs. Travers' hand, resting lightly on the
edge of the table, began to tremble. "It's for you . . . Yes.
For you alone . . . and it seems it can't be. . . ."</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he was saying good-bye to all the world,
that he was taking a last leave of his own self. Mrs. Travers
did not say a word, but Immada threw herself between them and
cried:</p>

<p>"You are a cruel woman! You are driving him away from where his
strength is. You put madness into his heart, O! Blind&mdash;without
pity&mdash;without shame! . . ."</p>

<p>"Immada," said Hassim's calm voice. Nobody moved.</p>

<p>"What did she say to me?" faltered Mrs. Travers and again repeated
in a voice that sounded hard, "What did she say?"</p>

<p>"Forgive her," said Lingard. "Her fears are for me . . ."&mdash;"It's
about your going?" Mrs. Travers interrupted, swiftly.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is&mdash;and you must forgive her." He had turned away his
eyes with something that resembled embarrassment but suddenly
he was assailed by an irresistible longing to look again at that
woman. At the moment of parting he clung to her with his glance
as a man holds with his hands a priceless and disputed possession.
The faint blush that overspread gradually Mrs. Travers' features
gave her face an air of extraordinary and startling animation.</p>

<p>"The danger you run?" she asked, eagerly. He repelled the suggestion
by a slighting gesture of the hand.&mdash;"Nothing worth looking at
twice. Don't give it a thought," he said. "I've been in tighter
places." He clapped his hands and waited till he heard the cabin
door open behind his back. "Steward, my pistols." The mulatto
in slippers, aproned to the chin, glided through the cabin with
unseeing eyes as though for him no one there had existed. . .
.&mdash;"Is it my heart that aches so?" Mrs. Travers asked herself,
contemplating Lingard's motionless figure. "How long will this
sensation of dull pain last? Will it last forever. . . ."&mdash;"How
many changes of clothes shall I put up, sir?" asked the steward,
while Lingard took the pistols from him and eased the hammers
after putting on fresh caps.&mdash;"I will take nothing this time,
steward." He received in turn from the mulatto's hands a red silk
handkerchief, a pocket book, a cigar-case. He knotted the handkerchief
loosely round his throat; it was evident he was going through
the routine of every departure for the shore; he even opened the
cigar-case to see whether it had been filled.&mdash;"Hat, sir," murmured
the half-caste. Lingard flung it on his head.&mdash;"Take your orders
from this lady, steward&mdash;till I come back. The cabin is hers&mdash;do
you hear?" He sighed ready to go and seemed unable to lift a foot.&mdash;"I
am coming with you," declared Mrs. Travers suddenly in a tone
of unalterable decision. He did not look at her; he did not even
look up; he said nothing, till after Carter had cried: "You can't,
Mrs. Travers!"&mdash;when without budging he whispered to himself:&mdash;"Of
course."  Mrs. Travers had pulled already the hood of her cloak
over her head and her face within the dark cloth had turned an
intense and unearthly white, in which the violet of her eyes appeared
unfathomably mysterious. Carter started forward.&mdash;"You don't know
this man," he almost shouted.</p>

<p>"I do know him," she said, and before the reproachfully unbelieving
attitude of the other she added, speaking slowly and with emphasis:
"There is not, I verily believe, a single thought or act of his
life that I don't know."&mdash;"It's true&mdash;it's true," muttered Lingard
to himself. Carter threw up his arms with a groan. "Stand back,"
said a voice that sounded to him like a growl of thunder, and
he felt a grip on his hand which seemed to crush every bone. He
jerked it away.&mdash;"Mrs. Travers! stay," he cried. They had vanished
through the open door and the sound of their footsteps had already
died away. Carter turned about bewildered as if looking for help.&mdash;"Who
is he, steward? Who in the name of all the mad devils is he?"
he asked, wildly. He was confounded by the cold and philosophical
tone of the answer:&mdash;"'Tain't my place to trouble about that,
sir&mdash;nor yours I guess."&mdash;"Isn't it!" shouted Carter. "Why, he
has carried the lady off." The steward was looking critically
at the lamp and after a while screwed the light down.&mdash;"That's
better," he mumbled.&mdash;"Good God! What is a fellow to do?" continued
Carter, looking at Hassim and Immada who were whispering together
and gave him only an absent glance. He rushed on deck and was
struck blind instantly by the night that seemed to have been lying
in wait for him; he stumbled over something soft, kicked something
hard, flung himself on the rail. "Come back," he cried. "Come
back. Captain! Mrs. Travers!&mdash;or let me come, too."</p>

<p>He listened. The breeze blew cool against his cheek. A black
bandage seemed to lie over his eyes. "Gone," he groaned, utterly
crushed. And suddenly he heard Mrs. Travers' voice remote in the
depths of the night.&mdash;"Defend the brig," it said, and these words,
pronouncing themselves in the immensity of a lightless universe,
thrilled every fibre of his body by the commanding sadness of
their tone. "Defend, defend the brig." . . . "I am damned if I
do," shouted Carter in despair. "Unless you come back! . . . Mrs.
Travers!"</p>

<p>". . . as though &mdash;I were&mdash;on board&mdash;myself," went on the
rising cadence of the voice, more distant now, a marvel of faint
and imperious clearness.</p>

<p>Carter shouted no more; he tried to make out the boat for a time,
and when, giving it up, he leaped down from the rail, the heavy
obscurity of the brig's main deck was agitated like a sombre pool
by his jump, swayed, eddied, seemed to break up. Blotches of darkness
recoiled, drifted away, bare feet shuffled hastily, confused murmurs
died out. "Lascars," he muttered, "The crew is all agog." Afterward
he listened for a moment to the faintly tumultuous snores of the
white men sleeping in rows, with their heads under the break of
the poop. Somewhere about his feet, the yacht's black dog, invisible,
and chained to a deck-ringbolt, whined, rattled the thin links,
pattered with his claws in his distress at the unfamiliar surroundings,
begging for the charity of human notice. Carter stooped impulsively,
and was met by a startling lick in the face.&mdash;"Hallo, boy!" He
thumped the thick curly sides, stroked the smooth head&mdash;"Good
boy, Rover. Down. Lie down, dog. You don't know what to make of
it&mdash;do you, boy?" The dog became still as death. "Well, neither
do I," muttered Carter. But such natures are helped by a cheerful
contempt for the intricate and endless suggestions of thought.
He told himself that he would soon see what was to come of it,
and dismissed all speculation. Had he been a little older he would
have felt that the situation was beyond his grasp; but he was
too young to see it whole and in a manner detached from himself.
All these inexplicable events filled him with deep concern&mdash;but
then on the other hand he had the key of the magazine and he could
not find it in his heart to dislike Lingard. He was positive about
this at last, and to know that much after the discomfort of an
inward conflict went a long way toward a solution. When he followed
Shaw into the cabin he could not repress a sense of enjoyment
or hide a faint and malicious smile.</p>

<p>"Gone away&mdash;did you say? And carried off the lady with him?"
discoursed Shaw very loud in the doorway. "Did he? Well, I am
not surprised. What can you expect from a man like that, who leaves
his ship in an open roadstead without &mdash;I won't say orders&mdash;but
without as much as a single word to his next in command? And at
night at that! That just shows you the kind of man. Is this the
way to treat a chief mate? I apprehend he was riled at the little
al-ter-cation we had just before you came on board. I told him
a truth or two&mdash;but&mdash;never mind. There's the law and that's enough
for me. I am captain as long as he is out of the ship, and if
his address before very long is not in one of Her Majesty's jails
or other I au-tho-rize you to call me a Dutchman. You mark my
words."</p>

<p>He walked in masterfully, sat down and surveyed the cabin in
a leisurely and autocratic manner; but suddenly his eyes became
stony with amazement and indignation; he pointed a fat and trembling
forefinger.</p>

<p>"Niggers," he said, huskily. "In the cuddy! In the cuddy!" He
appeared bereft of speech for a time.</p>

<p>Since he entered the cabin Hassim had been watching him in thoughtful
and expectant silence. "I can't have it," he continued with genuine
feeling in his voice. "Damme! I've too much respect for myself."
He rose with heavy deliberation; his eyes bulged out in a severe
and dignified stare. "Out you go!" he bellowed; suddenly, making
a step forward.&mdash;"Great Scott! What are you up to, mister?" asked
in a tone of dispassionate surprise the steward whose head appeared
in the doorway. "These are the Captain's friends." "Show me a
man's friends and . . ."  began Shaw, dogmatically, but abruptly
passed into the tone of admonition. "You take your mug out of
the way, bottle-washer. They ain't friends of mine. I ain't a
vagabond. I know what's due to myself. Quit!"  he hissed, fiercely.
Hassim, with an alert movement, grasped the handle of his kris.
Shaw puffed out his cheeks and frowned.&mdash;"Look out! He will stick
you like a prize pig," murmured Carter without moving a muscle.
Shaw looked round helplessly.&mdash;"And you would enjoy the fun&mdash;wouldn't
you?" he said with slow bitterness. Carter's distant non-committal
smile quite overwhelmed him by its horrid frigidity. Extreme despondency
replaced the proper feeling of racial pride in the primitive soul
of the mate. "My God! What luck! What have I done to fall amongst
that lot?" he groaned, sat down, and took his big grey head in
his hands. Carter drew aside to make room for Immada, who, in
obedience to a whisper from her brother, sought to leave the cabin.
She passed out after an instant of hesitation, during which she
looked up at Carter once. Her brother, motionless in a defensive
attitude, protected her retreat. She disappeared; Hassim's grip
on his weapon relaxed; he looked in turn at every object in the
cabin as if to fix its position in his mind forever, and following
his sister, walked out with noiseless footfalls.</p>

<p>They entered the same darkness which had received, enveloped,
and hidden the troubled souls of Lingard and Edith, but to these
two the light from which they had felt themselves driven away
was now like the light of forbidden hopes; it had the awful and
tranquil brightness that a light burning on the shore has for
an exhausted swimmer about to give himself up to the fateful sea.
They looked back; it had disappeared; Carter had shut the cabin
door behind them to have it out with Shaw. He wanted to arrive
at some kind of working compromise with the nominal commander,
but the mate was so demoralized by the novelty of the assaults
made upon his respectability that the young defender of the brig
could get nothing from him except lamentations mingled with mild
blasphemies. The brig slept, and along her quiet deck the voices
raised in her cabin &mdash;Shaw's appeals and reproaches directed
vociferously to heaven, together with Carter's inflexible drawl
mingled into one deadened, modulated, and continuous murmur. The
lockouts in the waist, motionless and peering into obscurity,
one ear turned to the sea, were aware of that strange resonance
like the ghost of a quarrel that seemed to hover at their backs.
Wasub, after seeing Hassim and Immada into their canoe, prowled
to and fro the whole length of the vessel vigilantly. There was
not a star in the sky and no gleam on the water; there was no
horizon, no outline, no shape for the eye to rest upon, nothing
for the hand to grasp. An obscurity that seemed without limit
in space and time had submerged the universe like a destroying
flood.</p>

<p>A lull of the breeze kept for a time the small boat in the neighbourhood
of the brig. The hoisted sail, invisible, fluttered faintly, mysteriously,
and the boat rising and falling bodily to the passage of each
invisible undulation of the waters seemed to repose upon a living
breast. Lingard, his hand on the tiller, sat up erect, expectant
and silent. Mrs. Travers had drawn her cloak close around her
body. Their glances plunged infinitely deep into a lightless void,
and yet they were still so near the brig that the piteous whine
of the dog, mingled with the angry rattling of the chain, reached
their ears faintly, evoking obscure images of distress and fury.
A sharp bark ending in a plaintive howl that seemed raised by
the passage of phantoms invisible to men, rent the black stillness,
as though the instinct of the brute inspired by the soul of night
had voiced in a lamentable plaint the fear of the future, the
anguish of lurking death, the terror of shadows. Not far from
the brig's boat Hassim and Immada in their canoe, letting their
paddles trail in the water, sat in a silent and invincible torpor
as if the fitful puffs of wind had carried to their hearts the
breath of a subtle poison that, very soon, would make them die.&mdash;"Have
you seen the white woman's eyes?" cried the girl. She struck her
palms together loudly and remained with her arms extended, with
her hands clasped. "O Hassim! Have you seen her eyes shining under
her eyebrows like rays of light darting under the arched boughs
in a forest? They pierced me. I shuddered at the sound of her
voice! I saw her walk behind him&mdash;and it seems to me that she
does not live on earth&mdash;that all this is witchcraft."</p>

<p>She lamented in the night. Hassim kept silent. He had no illusions
and in any other man but Lingard he would have thought the proceeding
no better than suicidal folly. For him Travers and d'Alcacer were
two powerful Rajahs&mdash;probably relatives of the Ruler of the land
of the English whom he knew to be a woman; but why they should
come and interfere with the recovery of his own kingdom was an
obscure problem. He was concerned for Lingard's safety. That the
risk was incurred mostly for his sake&mdash;so that the prospects of
the great enterprise should not be ruined by a quarrel over the
lives of these whites&mdash;did not strike him so much as may be imagined.
There was that in him which made such an action on Lingard's part
appear all but unavoidable. Was he not Rajah Hassim and was not
the other a man of strong heart, of strong arm, of proud courage,
a man great enough to protect highborn princes&mdash;a friend? Immada's
words called out a smile which, like the words, was lost in the
darkness. "Forget your weariness," he said, gently, "lest, O Sister,
we should arrive too late." The coming day would throw its light
on some decisive event. Hassim thought of his own men who guarded
the Emma and he wished to be where they could hear his voice.
He regretted Jaffir was not there. Hassim was saddened by the
absence from his side of that man who once had carried what he
thought would be his last message to his friend. It had not been
the last. He had lived to cherish new hopes and to face new troubles
and, perchance, to frame another message yet, while death knocked
with the hands of armed enemies at the gate. The breeze steadied;
the succeeding swells swung the canoe smoothly up the unbroken
ridges of water travelling apace along the land. They progressed
slowly; but Immada's heart was more weary than her arms, and Hassim,
dipping the blade of his paddle without a splash, peered right
and left, trying to make out the shadowy forms of islets. A long
way ahead of the canoe and holding the same course, the brig's
dinghy ran with broad lug extended, making for that narrow and
winding passage between the coast and the southern shoals, which
led to the mouth of the creek connecting the lagoon with the sea.</p>

<p>Thus on that starless night the Shallows were peopled by uneasy
souls. The thick veil of clouds stretched over them, cut them
off from the rest of the universe. At times Mrs. Travers had in
the darkness the impression of dizzy speed, and again it seemed
to her that the boat was standing still, that everything in the
world was standing still and only her fancy roamed free from all
trammels. Lingard, perfectly motionless by her side, steered,
shaping his course by the feel of the wind. Presently he perceived
ahead a ghostly flicker of faint, livid light which the earth
seemed to throw up against the uniform blackness of the sky. The
dinghy was approaching the expanse of the Shallows. The confused
clamour of broken water deepened its note.</p>

<p>"How long are we going to sail like this?" asked Mrs. Travers,
gently. She did not recognize the voice that pronounced the word
"Always" in answer to her question. It had the impersonal ring
of a voice without a master. Her heart beat fast.</p>

<p>"Captain Lingard!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Yes. What?" he said, nervously, as if startled out of a dream.</p>

<p>"I asked you how long we were going to sail like this," she repeated,
distinctly.</p>

<p>"If the breeze holds we shall be in the lagoon soon after daybreak.
That will be the right time, too. I shall leave you on board the
hulk with Jorgenson."</p>

<p>"And you? What will you do?" she asked. She had to wait for a
while.</p>

<p>"I will do what I can," she heard him say at last. There was
another pause. "All I can," he added.</p>

<p>The breeze dropped, the sail fluttered.</p>

<p>"I have perfect confidence in you," she said. "But are you certain
of success?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>The futility of her question came home to Mrs. Travers. In a
few hours of life she had been torn away from all her certitudes,
flung into a world of improbabilities. This thought instead of
augmenting her distress seemed to soothe her. What she experienced
was not doubt and it was not fear. It was something else. It might
have been only a great fatigue.</p>

<p>She heard a dull detonation as if in the depth of the sea. It
was hardly more than a shock and a vibration. A roller had broken
amongst the shoals; the livid clearness Lingard had seen ahead
flashed and flickered in expanded white sheets much nearer to
the boat now. And all this&mdash;the wan burst of light, the faint
shock as of something remote and immense falling into ruins, was
taking place outside the limits of her life which remained encircled
by an impenetrable darkness and by an impenetrable silence. Puffs
of wind blew about her head and expired; the sail collapsed, shivered
audibly, stood full and still in turn; and again the sensation
of vertiginous speed and of absolute immobility succeeding each
other with increasing swiftness merged at last into a bizarre
state of headlong motion and profound peace. The darkness enfolded
her like the enervating caress of a sombre universe. It was gentle
and destructive. Its languor seduced her soul into surrender.
Nothing existed and even all her memories vanished into space.
She was content that nothing should exist.</p>

<p>Lingard, aware all the time of their contact in the narrow stern
sheets of the boat, was startled by the pressure of the woman's
head drooping on his shoulder. He stiffened himself still more
as though he had tried on the approach of a danger to conceal
his life in the breathless rigidity of his body. The boat soared
and descended slowly; a region of foam and reefs stretched across
her course hissing like a gigantic cauldron; a strong gust of
wind drove her straight at it for a moment then passed on and
abandoned her to the regular balancing of the swell. The struggle
of the rocks forever overwhelmed and emerging, with the sea forever
victorious and repulsed, fascinated the man. He watched it as
he would have watched something going on within himself while
Mrs. Travers slept sustained by his arm, pressed to his side,
abandoned to his support. The shoals guarding the Shore of Refuge
had given him his first glimpse of success&mdash;the solid support
he needed for his action. The Shallows were the shelter of his
dreams; their voice had the power to soothe and exalt his thoughts
with the promise of freedom for his hopes. Never had there been
such a generous friendship. . . . A mass of white foam whirling
about a centre of intense blackness spun silently past the side
of the boat. . . . That woman he held like a captive on his arm
had also been given to him by the Shallows.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes caught on a distant sandbank the red gleam
of Daman's camp fire instantly eclipsed like the wink of a signalling
lantern along the level of the waters. It brought to his mind
the existence of the two men&mdash;those other captives. If the war
canoe transporting them into the lagoon had left the sands shortly
after Hassim's retreat from Daman's camp, Travers and d'Alcacer
were by this time far away up the creek. Every thought of action
had become odious to Lingard since all he could do in the world
now was to hasten the moment of his separation from that woman
to whom he had confessed the whole secret of his life.</p>

<p>And she slept. She could sleep! He looked down at her as he would
have looked at the slumbering ignorance of a child, but the life
within him had the fierce beat of supreme moments. Near by, the
eddies sighed along the reefs, the water soughed amongst the stones,
clung round the rocks with tragic murmurs that resembled promises,
good-byes, or prayers. From the unfathomable distances of the
night came the booming of the swell assaulting the seaward face
of the Shallows. He felt the woman's nearness with such intensity
that he heard nothing. . . . Then suddenly he thought of death.</p>

<p>"Wake up!" he shouted in her ear, swinging round in his seat.
Mrs. Travers gasped; a splash of water flicked her over the eyes
and she felt the separate drops run down her cheeks, she tasted
them on her lips, tepid and bitter like tears. A swishing undulation
tossed the boat on high followed by another and still another;
and then the boat with the breeze abeam glided through still water,
laying over at a steady angle.</p>

<p>"Clear of the reef now," remarked Lingard in a tone of relief.</p>

<p>"Were we in any danger?" asked Mrs. Travers in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Well, the breeze dropped and we drifted in very close to the
rocks," he answered. "I had to rouse you. It wouldn't have done
for you to wake up suddenly struggling in the water."</p>

<p>So she had slept! It seemed to her incredible that she should
have closed her eyes in this small boat, with the knowledge of
their desperate errand, on so disturbed a sea. The man by her
side leaned forward, extended his arm, and the boat going off
before the wind went on faster on an even keel. A motionless black
bank resting on the sea stretched infinitely right in their way
in ominous stillness. She called Lingard's attention to it. "Look
at this awful cloud."</p>

<p>"This cloud is the coast and in a moment we shall be entering
the creek," he said, quietly. Mrs. Travers stared at it. Was it
land&mdash;land! It seemed to her even less palpable than a cloud,
a mere sinister immobility above the unrest of the sea, nursing
in its depth the unrest of men who, to her mind, were no more
real than fantastic shadows.</p>
