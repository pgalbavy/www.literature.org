<p>In her pocket as she spoke her hand rested upon the little sack
of tobacco, which responded accusingly to the touch of her restless
fingers; and she found time to wonder why she was building up
this fiction for Mr. Arthur Russell. His discovery of Walter's
device for whiling away the dull evening had shamed and distressed
her; but she would have suffered no less if almost any other had
been the discoverer. In this gentleman, after hearing that he
was Mildred's Mr. Arthur Russell, Alice felt not the slightest
"personal interest"; and there was yet to develop in her life
such a thing as an interest not personal. At twenty-two this state
of affairs is not unique.</p>

<p>So far as Alice was concerned Russell might have worn a placard,
"Engaged." She looked upon him as diners entering a restaurant
look upon tables marked "Reserved": the glance, slightly discontented,
passes on at once. Or so the eye of a prospector wanders querulously
over staked and established claims on the mountainside, and seeks
the virgin land beyond; unless, indeed, the prospector be dishonest.
But Alice was no claim-jumper&mdash;so long as the notice of ownership
was plainly posted.</p>

<p>Though she was indifferent now, habit ruled her: and, at the
very time she wondered why she created fictitious cigars for her
father, she was also regretting that she had not boldly carried
her Malacca stick down-town with her. Her vivacity increased automatically.</p>

<p>"Perhaps the clerk thought you wanted the cigars for yourself,"
Russell suggested. "He may have taken you for a Spanish countess."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he did!" Alice agreed, gaily; and she hummed a bar
or two of "LaPaloma," snapping her fingers as castanets, and swaying
her body a little, to suggest the accepted stencil of a "Spanish
Dancer." "Would you have taken me for one, Mr. Russell?" she asked,
as she concluded the impersonation.</p>

<p>"I? Why, yes," he said. "I'D take you for anything you wanted
me to."</p>

<p>"Why, what a speech!" she cried, and, laughing, gave him a quick
glance in which there glimmered some real surprise. He was looking
at her quizzically, but with the liveliest appreciation. Her surprise
increased; and she was glad that he had joined her.</p>

<p>To be seen walking with such a companion added to her pleasure.
She would have described him as "altogether quite stunning-looking";
and she liked his tall, dark thinness, his gray clothes, his soft
hat, and his clean brown shoes; she liked his easy swing of the
stick he carried.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't I have said it?" he asked. "Would you rather not be
taken for a Spanish countess?"</p>

<p>"That isn't it," she explained. "You said&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I said I'd take you for whatever you wanted me to. Isn't that
all right?"</p>

<p>"It would all depend, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it would depend on what you wanted."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she laughed. "It might depend on a lot of things."</p>

<p>"Such as?"</p>

<p>"Well&#11834;" She hesitated, having the mischievous impulse to say,
"Such as Mildred!" But she decided to omit this reference, and
became serious, remembering Russell's service to her at Mildred's
house. "Speaking of what I want to be taken for," she said;&mdash;"I've
been wondering ever since the other night what you did take me
for! You must have taken me for the sister of a professional gambler,
I'm afraid!"</p>

<p>Russell's look of kindness was the truth about him, she was to
discover; and he reassured her now by the promptness of his friendly
chuckle. "Then your young brother told you where I found him,
did he? I kept my face straight at the time, but I laughed afterward&mdash;to
myself. It struck me as original, to say the least: his amusing
himself with those darkies."</p>

<p>"Walter IS original," Alice said; and, having adopted this new
view of her brother's eccentricities, she impulsively went on
to make it more plausible. "He's a very odd boy, and I was afraid
you'd misunderstand. He tells wonderful 'darky stories,' and he'll
do anything to draw coloured people out and make them talk; and
that's what he was doing at Mildred's when you found him for me&mdash;he
says he wins their confidence by playing dice with them. In the
family we think he'll probably write about them some day. He's
rather literary."</p>

<p>"Are you?" Russell asked, smiling.</p>

<p>"I? Oh&#11834;" She paused, lifting both hands in a charming gesture
of helplessness. "Oh, I'm just&mdash;me!"</p>

<p>His glance followed the lightly waved hands with keen approval,
then rose to the lively and colourful face, with its hazel eyes,
its small and pretty nose, and the lip-caught smile which seemed
the climax of her decorative transition. Never had he seen a creature
so plastic or so wistful.</p>

<p>Here was a contrast to his cousin Mildred, who was not wistful,
and controlled any impulses toward plasticity, if she had them.
"By George!"  he said. "But you <em>ARE </em>different!"</p>

<p>With that, there leaped in her such an impulse of roguish gallantry
as she could never resist. She turned her head, and, laughing
and bright-eyed, looked him full in the face.</p>

<p>"From whom?" she cried.</p>

<p>"From&mdash;everybody!" he said. "Are you a mind-reader?"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"How did you know I was thinking you were different from my cousin,
Mildred Palmer?"</p>

<p>"What makes you think I <em>DID </em>know it?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he said. "You knew what I was thinking and I knew
you knew."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said with cool humour. "How intimate that seems to
make us all at once!"</p>

<p>Russell left no doubt that he was delighted with these gaieties
of hers. "By George!" he exclaimed again. "I thought you were
this sort of girl the first moment I saw you!"</p>

<p>"What sort of girl? Didn't Mildred tell you what sort of girl
I am when she asked you to dance with me?"</p>

<p>"She didn't ask me to dance with you &mdash;I'd been looking
at you. You were talking to some old ladies, and I asked Mildred
who you were."</p>

<p>"Oh, so Mildred <em>DIDN'T&#11834;" </em>Alice checked herself. "Who
did she tell you I was?"</p>

<p>"She just said you were a Miss Adams, so I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"'A' Miss Adams?" Alice interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes. Then I said I'd like to meet you."</p>

<p>"I see. You thought you'd save me from the old ladies."</p>

<p>"No. I thought I'd save myself from some of the girls Mildred
was getting me to dance with. There was a Miss Dowling&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Poor man!" Alice said, gently, and her impulsive thought was
that Mildred had taken few chances, and that as a matter of self-defense
her carefulness might have been well founded. This Mr. Arthur
Russell was a much more responsive person than one had supposed.</p>

<p>"So, Mr. Russell, you don't know anything about me except what
you thought when you first saw me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know I was right when I thought it."</p>

<p>"You haven't told me what you thought."</p>

<p>"I thought you were like what you <em>ARE </em>like."</p>

<p>"Not very definite, is it? I'm afraid you shed more light a minute
or so ago, when you said how different from Mildred you thought
I was. That <em>WAS </em>definite, unfortunately!"</p>

<p>"I didn't say it," Russell explained. "I thought it, and you
read my mind. That's the sort of girl I thought you were&mdash;one
that could read a man's mind. Why do you say 'unfortunately' you're
not like Mildred?"</p>

<p>Alice's smooth gesture seemed to sketch Mildred. "Because she's
perfect&mdash;why, she's <em>PERFECTLY </em>perfect! She never makes
a mistake, and everybody looks up to her&mdash;oh, yes, we all fairly
adore her! She's like some big, noble, cold statue&mdash;'way above
the rest of us&mdash;and she hardly ever does anything mean or treacherous.
Of all the girls I know I believe she's played the fewest really
petty tricks. She's&#11834;"</p>

<p>Russell interrupted; he looked perplexed. "You say she's perfectly
perfect, but that she does play <em>SOME</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice laughed, as if at his sweet innocence. "Men are so funny!"
she informed him. "Of course girls <em>ALL </em>do mean things
sometimes. My own career's just one long brazen smirch of 'em!
What I mean is, Mildred's perfectly perfect compared to the rest
of us."</p>

<p>"I see," he said, and seemed to need a moment or two of thoughtfulness.
Then he inquired, "What sort of treacherous things do <em>YOU
</em>do?"</p>

<p>"I? Oh, the very worst kind! Most people bore me particularly
the men in this town&mdash;and I show it."</p>

<p>"But I shouldn't call that treacherous, exactly."</p>

<p>"Well, <em>THEY </em>do," Alice laughed. "It's made me a terribly
unpopular character! I do a lot of things they hate. For instance,
at a dance I'd a lot rather find some clever old woman and talk
to her than dance with nine-tenths of these nonentities. I usually
do it, too."</p>

<p>"But you danced as if you liked it. You danced better than any
other girl I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"This flattery of yours doesn't quite turn my head, Mr. Russell,"
Alice interrupted. "Particularly since Mildred only gave you Ella
Dowling to compare with me!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he insisted. "There were others&mdash;and of course Mildred,
herself."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, yes. I forgot that. Well&#11834;" She paused, then
added, "I certainly <em>OUGHT </em>to dance well."</p>

<p>"Why is it so much a duty?"</p>

<p>"When I think of the dancing-teachers and the expense to papa!
All sorts of fancy instructors &mdash;I suppose that's what daughters
have fathers for, though, isn't it? To throw money away on them?"</p>

<p>"You don't&#11834;" Russell began, and his look was one of alarm.
"You haven't taken up&#11834;"</p>

<p>She understood his apprehension and responded merrily, "Oh, murder,
no! You mean you're afraid I break out sometimes in a piece of
cheesecloth and run around a fountain thirty times, and then,
for an encore, show how much like snakes I can make my arms look."</p>

<p>"I <em>SAID </em>you were a mind-reader!" he exclaimed. "That's
exactly what I was pretending to be afraid you might do."</p>

<p>"'Pretending?' That's nicer of you. No; it's not my mania."</p>

<p>"What is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular that I know of just now. Of course
I've had the usual one: the one that every girl goes through."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, Mr. Russell, you can't expect me to believe you're
really a man of the world if you don't know that every girl has
a time in her life when she's positive she's divinely talented
for the stage! It's the only universal rule about women that hasn't
got an exception. I don't mean we all want to go on the stage,
but we all think we'd be wonderful if we did. Even Mildred. Oh,
she wouldn't confess it to you: you'd have to know her a great
deal better than any man can ever know her to find out."</p>

<p>"I see," he said. "Girls are always telling us we can't know
them. I wonder if you&#11834;"</p>

<p>She took up his thought before he expressed it, and again he
was fascinated by her quickness, which indeed seemed to him almost
telepathic. "Oh, but <em>DON'T </em>we know one another, though!"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Such things we have to keep secret&mdash;things that go on right
before <em>YOUR </em>eyes!"</p>

<p>"Why don't some of you tell us?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We can't tell you."</p>

<p>"Too much honour?"</p>

<p>"No. Not even too much honour among thieves, Mr. Russell. We
don't tell you about our tricks against one another because we
know it wouldn't make any impression on you. The tricks aren't
played against you, and you have a soft side for cats with lovely
manners!"</p>

<p>"What about your tricks against us?"</p>

<p>"Oh, those!" Alice laughed. "We think they're rather cute!"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" he cried, and hammered the ferrule of his stick upon
the pavement.</p>

<p>"What's the applause for?"</p>

<p>"For you. What you said was like running up the black flag to
the masthead."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It was just a modest little sign in a pretty flower-bed:
'Gentlemen, beware!'"</p>

<p>"I see I must," he said, gallantly.</p>

<p>"Thanks! But I mean, beware of the whole bloomin' garden!" Then,
picking up a thread that had almost disappeared: "You needn't
think you'll ever find out whether I'm right about Mildred's not
being an exception by asking her," she said. "She won't tell you:
she's not the sort that ever makes a confession."</p>

<p>But Russell had not followed her shift to the former topic. "'Mildred's
not being an exception?'" he said, vaguely. "I don't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"An exception about thinking she could be a wonderful thing on
the stage if she only cared to. If you asked her I'm pretty sure
she'd say, 'What nonsense!' Mildred's the dearest, finest thing
anywhere, but you won't find out many things about her by asking
her."</p>

<p>Russell's expression became more serious, as it did whenever
his cousin was made their topic. "You think not?" he said. "You
think she's&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No. But it's not because she isn't sincere exactly. It's only
because she has such a lot to live up to. She has to live up to
being a girl on the grand style to herself, I mean, of course."
And without pausing Alice rippled on, "You ought to have seen
ME when I had the stage-fever! I used to play 'Juliet' all alone
in my room.' She lifted her arms in graceful entreaty, pleading
musically,</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,<br/>
That monthly changes in her circled orb,<br/>
Lest thy love prove&#11834;"

</p>
</div>
<p>She broke off abruptly with a little flourish, snapping thumb
and finger of each outstretched hand, then laughed and said, "Papa
used to make such fun of me! Thank heaven, I was only fifteen;
I was all over it by the next year."</p>

<p>"No wonder you had the fever," Russell observed. "You do it beautifully.
Why didn't you finish the line?"</p>

<p>"Which one? 'Lest thy love prove likewise variable'? Juliet was
saying it to a <em>MAN, </em>you know. She seems to have been
ready to worry about his constancy pretty early in their affair!"</p>

<p>Her companion was again thoughtful. "Yes," he said, seeming to
be rather irksomely impressed with Alice's suggestion. "Yes; it
does appear so."</p>

<p>Alice glanced at his serious face, and yielded to an audacious
temptation. "You mustn't take it so hard," she said, flippantly.</p>

<p>"It isn't about you: it's only about Romeo and Juliet."</p>

<p>"See here!" he exclaimed. "You aren't at your mind-reading again,
are you? There are times when it won't do, you know!"</p>

<p>She leaned toward him a little, as if companionably: they were
walking slowly, and this geniality of hers brought her shoulder
in light contact with his for a moment. "Do you dislike my mind-reading?"
she asked, and, across their two just touching shoulders, gave
him her sudden look of smiling wistfulness. "Do you hate it?"</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No, I don't," he said, gravely. "It's quite
pleasant. But I think it says, 'Gentlemen, beware!'"</p>

<p>She instantly moved away from him, with the lawless and frank
laugh of one who is delighted to be caught in a piece of hypocrisy.
"How lovely!"  she cried. Then she pointed ahead. "Our walk is
nearly over. We're coming to the foolish little house where I
live. It's a queer little place, but my father's so attached to
it the family have about given up hope of getting him to build
a real house farther out. He doesn't mind our being extravagant
about anything else, but he won't let us alter one single thing
about his precious little old house. Well!" She halted, and gave
him her hand. "Adieu!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't," he began; hesitated, then asked: "I couldn't come
in with you for a little while?"</p>

<p>"Not now," she said, quickly. "You can come&#11834;" She paused.</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Almost any time." She turned and walked slowly up the path,
but he waited. "You can come in the evening if you like," she
called back to him over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"Soon?"</p>

<p>"As soon as you like!" She waved her hand; then ran indoors and
watched him from a window as he went up the street. He walked
rapidly, a fine, easy figure, swinging his stick in a way that
suggested exhilaration. Alice, staring after him through the irregular
apertures of a lace curtain, showed no similar buoyancy. Upon
the instant she closed the door all sparkle left her: she had
become at once the simple and sometimes troubled girl her family
knew.</p>

<p>"What is going on out there?" her mother asked, approaching from
the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing," Alice said, indifferently, as she turned away.
"That Mr. Russell met me downtown and walked up with me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Russell? Oh, the one that's engaged to Mildred?"</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I don't know for certain. He didn't seem so much
like an engaged man to me." And she added, in the tone of thoughtful
preoccupation: "Anyhow&mdash;not so terribly!"</p>

<p>Then she ran upstairs, gave her father his tobacco, filled his
pipe for him, and petted him as he lighted it.</p>
