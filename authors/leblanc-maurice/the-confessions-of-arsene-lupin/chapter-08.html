<p>    "Monsieur Arsène Lupin has the honour to inform you of his
    approaching marriage with Mademoiselle Angélique de
    Sarzeau-Vendôme, Princesse de Bourbon-Condé, and to request the
    pleasure of your company at the wedding, which will take place at
    the church of Sainte-Clotilde...."
</p>
<p>    "The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme has the honour to inform you of the
    approaching marriage of his daughter Angélique, Princesse de
    Bourbon-Condé, with Monsieur Arsène Lupin, and to request...."
</p>
<p>Jean Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme could not finish reading the invitations
which he held in his trembling hand. Pale with anger, his long, lean
body shaking with tremors:
</p><p>"There!" he gasped, handing the two communications to his daughter.
"This is what our friends have received! This has been the talk of Paris
since yesterday! What do you say to that dastardly insult, Angélique?
What would your poor mother say to it, if she were alive?"
</p><p>Angélique was tall and thin like her father, skinny and angular like
him. She was thirty-three years of age, always dressed in black stuff,
shy and retiring in manner, with a head too small in proportion to her
height and narrowed on either side until the nose seemed to jut forth in
protest against such parsimony. And yet it would be impossible to say
that she was ugly, for her eyes were extremely beautiful, soft and
grave, proud and a little sad: pathetic eyes which to see once was to
remember.
</p><p>She flushed with shame at hearing her father's words, which told her the
scandal of which she was the victim. But, as she loved him,
notwithstanding his harshness to her, his injustice and despotism, she
said:
</p><p>"Oh, I think it must be meant for a joke, father, to which we need pay
no attention!"
</p><p>"A joke? Why, every one is gossiping about it! A dozen papers have
printed the confounded notice this morning, with satirical comments.
They quote our pedigree, our ancestors, our illustrious dead. They
pretend to take the thing seriously...."
</p><p>"Still, no one could believe...."
</p><p>"Of course not. But that doesn't prevent us from being the by-word of
Paris."
</p><p>"It will all be forgotten by to-morrow."
</p><p>"To-morrow, my girl, people will remember that the name of Angélique de
Sarzeau-Vendôme has been bandied about as it should not be. Oh, if I
could find out the name of the scoundrel who has dared...."
</p><p>At that moment, Hyacinthe, the duke's valet, came in and said that
monsieur le duc was wanted on the telephone. Still fuming, he took down
the receiver and growled:
</p><p>"Well? Who is it? Yes, it's the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme speaking."
</p><p>A voice replied:
</p><p>"I want to apologize to you, monsieur le duc, and to Mlle. Angélique.
It's my secretary's fault."
</p><p>"Your secretary?"
</p><p>"Yes, the invitations were only a rough draft which I meant to submit to
you. Unfortunately my secretary thought...."
</p><p>"But, tell me, monsieur, who are you?"
</p><p>"What, monsieur le duc, don't you know my voice? The voice of your
future son-in-law?"
</p><p>"What!"
</p><p>"Arsène Lupin."
</p><p>The duke dropped into a chair. His face was livid.
</p><p>"Arsène Lupin ... it's he ... Arsène Lupin...."
</p><p>Angélique gave a smile:
</p><p>"You see, father, it's only a joke, a hoax."
</p><p>But the duke's rage broke out afresh and he began to walk up and down,
moving his arms:
</p><p>"I shall go to the police!... The fellow can't be allowed to make a fool
of me in this way!... If there's any law left in the land, it must be
stopped!"
</p><p>Hyacinthe entered the room again. He brought two visiting-cards.
</p><p>"Chotois? Lepetit? Don't know them."
</p><p>"They are both journalists, monsieur le duc."
</p><p>"What do they want?"
</p><p>"They would like to speak to monsieur le duc with regard to ... the
marriage...."
</p><p>"Turn them out!" exclaimed the duke. "Kick them out! And tell the porter
not to admit scum of that sort to my house in future."
</p><p>"Please, father ..." Angélique ventured to say.
</p><p>"As for you, shut up! If you had consented to marry one of your cousins
when I wanted you to this wouldn't have happened."
</p><p>The same evening, one of the two reporters printed, on the front page of
his paper, a somewhat fanciful story of his expedition to the family
mansion of the Sarzeau-Vendômes, in the Rue de Varennes, and expatiated
pleasantly upon the old nobleman's wrathful protests.
</p><p>The next morning, another newspaper published an interview with Arsène
Lupin which was supposed to have taken place in a lobby at the Opera.
Arsène Lupin retorted in a letter to the editor:
</p>
<p>    "I share my prospective father-in-law's indignation to the full.
    The sending out of the invitations was a gross breach of etiquette
    for which I am not responsible, but for which I wish to make a
    public apology. Why, sir, the date of the marriage is not yet
    fixed. My bride's father suggests early in May. She and I think
    that six weeks is really too long to wait!..."
</p>
<p>That which gave a special piquancy to the affair and added immensely to
the enjoyment of the friends of the family was the duke's well-known
character: his pride and the uncompromising nature of his ideas and
principles. Duc Jean was the last descendant of the Barons de Sarzeau,
the most ancient family in Brittany; he was the lineal descendant of
that Sarzeau who, upon marrying a Vendôme, refused to bear the new title
which Louis XV forced upon him until after he had been imprisoned for
ten years in the Bastille; and he had abandoned none of the prejudices
of the old régime. In his youth, he followed the Comte de Chambord into
exile. In his old age, he refused a seat in the Chamber on the pretext
that a Sarzeau could only sit with his peers.
</p><p>The incident stung him to the quick. Nothing could pacify him. He cursed
Lupin in good round terms, threatened him with every sort of punishment
and rounded on his daughter:
</p><p>"There, if you had only married!... After all you had plenty of chances.
Your three cousins, Mussy, d'Emboise and Caorches, are noblemen of good
descent, allied to the best families, fairly well-off; and they are
still anxious to marry you. Why do you refuse them? Ah, because miss is
a dreamer, a sentimentalist; and because her cousins are too fat, or too
thin, or too coarse for her...."
</p><p>She was, in fact, a dreamer. Left to her own devices from childhood, she
had read all the books of chivalry, all the colourless romances of
olden-time that littered the ancestral presses; and she looked upon life
as a fairy-tale in which the beauteous maidens are always happy, while
the others wait till death for the bridegroom who does not come. Why
should she marry one of her cousins when they were only after her money,
the millions which she had inherited from her mother? She might as well
remain an old maid and go on dreaming....
</p><p>She answered, gently:
</p><p>"You will end by making yourself ill, father. Forget this silly
business."
</p><p>But how could he forget it? Every morning, some pin-prick renewed his
wound. Three days running, Angélique received a wonderful sheaf of
flowers, with Arsène Lupin's card peeping from it. The duke could not go
to his club but a friend accosted him:
</p><p>"That was a good one to-day!"
</p><p>"What was?"
</p><p>"Why, your son-in-law's latest! Haven't you seen it? Here, read it for
yourself: 'M. Arsène Lupin is petitioning the Council of State for
permission to add his wife's name to his own and to be known henceforth
as Lupin de Sarzeau-Vendôme.'"
</p><p>And, the next day, he read:
</p>
<p>    "As the young bride, by virtue of an unrepealed decree of Charles
    X, bears the title and arms of the Bourbon-Condés, of whom she is
    the heiress-of-line, the eldest son of the Lupins de
    Sarzeau-Vendôme will be styled Prince de Bourbon-Condé."
</p>
<p>And, the day after, an advertisement.
</p>
<p>    "Exhibition of Mlle. de Sarzeau-Vendôme's trousseau at Messrs.
    ----'s Great Linen Warehouse. Each article marked with initials L.
    S. V."
</p>
<p>Then an illustrated paper published a photographic scene: the duke, his
daughter and his son-in-law sitting at a table playing three-handed
auction-bridge.
</p><p>And the date also was announced with a great flourish of trumpets: the
4th of May.
</p><p>And particulars were given of the marriage-settlement. Lupin showed
himself wonderfully disinterested. He was prepared to sign, the
newspapers said, with his eyes closed, without knowing the figure of the
dowry.
</p><p>All these things drove the old duke crazy. His hatred of Lupin assumed
morbid proportions. Much as it went against the grain, he called on the
prefect of police, who advised him to be on his guard:
</p><p>"We know the gentleman's ways; he is employing one of his favourite
dodges. Forgive the expression, monsieur le duc, but he is 'nursing'
you. Don't fall into the trap."
</p><p>"What dodge? What trap?" asked the duke, anxiously.
</p><p>"He is trying to make you lose your head and to lead you, by
intimidation, to do something which you would refuse to do in cold
blood."
</p><p>"Still, M. Arsène Lupin can hardly hope that I will offer him my
daughter's hand!"
</p><p>"No, but he hopes that you will commit, to put it mildly, a blunder."
</p><p>"What blunder?"
</p><p>"Exactly that blunder which he wants you to commit."
</p><p>"Then you think, monsieur le préfet ...?"
</p><p>"I think the best thing you can do, monsieur le duc, is to go home, or,
if all this excitement worries you, to run down to the country and stay
there quietly, without upsetting yourself."
</p><p>This conversation only increased the old duke's fears. Lupin appeared to
him in the light of a terrible person, who employed diabolical methods
and kept accomplices in every sphere of society. Prudence was the
watchword.
</p><p>And life, from that moment, became intolerable. The duke grew more
crabbed and silent than ever and denied his door to all his old friends
and even to Angélique's three suitors, her Cousins de Mussy, d'Emboise
and de Caorches, who were none of them on speaking terms with the
others, in consequence of their rivalry, and who were in the habit of
calling, turn and turn about, every week.
</p><p>For no earthly reason, he dismissed his butler and his coachman. But he
dared not fill their places, for fear of engaging creatures of Arsène
Lupin's; and his own man, Hyacinthe, in whom he had every confidence,
having had him in his service for over forty years, had to take upon
himself the laborious duties of the stables and the pantry.
</p><p>"Come, father," said Angélique, trying to make him listen to
common-sense. "I really can't see what you are afraid of. No one can
force me into this ridiculous marriage."
</p><p>"Well, of course, that's not what I'm afraid of."
</p><p>"What then, father?"
</p><p>"How can I tell? An abduction! A burglary! An act of violence! There is
no doubt that the villain is scheming something; and there is also no
doubt that we are surrounded by spies."
</p><p>One afternoon, he received a newspaper in which the following paragraph
was marked in red pencil:
</p>
<p>    "The signing of the marriage-contract is fixed for this evening, at
    the Sarzeau-Vendôme town-house. It will be quite a private ceremony
    and only a few privileged friends will be present to congratulate
    the happy pair. The witnesses to the contract on behalf of Mlle. de
    Sarzeau-Vendôme, the Prince de la Rochefoucauld-Limours and the
    Comte de Chartres, will be introduced by M. Arsène Lupin to the two
    gentlemen who have claimed the honour of acting as his groomsmen,
    namely, the prefect of police and the governor of the Santé
    Prison."
</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, the duke sent his servant Hyacinthe to the post with
three express messages. At four o'clock, in Angélique's presence, he saw
the three cousins: Mussy, fat, heavy, pasty-faced; d'Emboise, slender,
fresh-coloured and shy: Caorches, short, thin and unhealthy-looking: all
three, old bachelors by this time, lacking distinction in dress or
appearance.
</p><p>The meeting was a short one. The duke had worked out his whole plan of
campaign, a defensive campaign, of which he set forth the first stage in
explicit terms:
</p><p>"Angélique and I will leave Paris to-night for our place in Brittany. I
rely on you, my three nephews, to help us get away. You, d'Emboise, will
come and fetch us in your car, with the hood up. You, Mussy, will bring
your big motor and kindly see to the luggage with Hyacinthe, my man.
You, Caorches, will go to the Gare d'Orléans and book our berths in the
sleeping-car for Vannes by the 10.40 train. Is that settled?"
</p><p>The rest of the day passed without incident. The duke, to avoid any
accidental indiscretion, waited until after dinner to tell Hyacinthe to
pack a trunk and a portmanteau. Hyacinthe was to accompany them, as well
as Angélique's maid.
</p><p>At nine o'clock, all the other servants went to bed, by their master's
order. At ten minutes to ten, the duke, who was completing his
preparations, heard the sound of a motor-horn. The porter opened the
gates of the courtyard. The duke, standing at the window, recognized
d'Emboise's landaulette:
</p><p>"Tell him I shall be down presently," he said to Hyacinthe, "and let
mademoiselle know."
</p><p>In a few minutes, as Hyacinthe did not return, he left his room. But he
was attacked on the landing by two masked men, who gagged and bound him
before he could utter a cry. And one of the men said to him, in a low
voice:
</p><p>"Take this as a first warning, monsieur le duc. If you persist in
leaving Paris and refusing your consent, it will be a more serious
matter."
</p><p>And the same man said to his companion:
</p><p>"Keep an eye on him. I will see to the young lady."
</p><p>By that time, two other confederates had secured the lady's maid; and
Angélique, herself gagged, lay fainting on a couch in her boudoir.
</p><p>She came to almost immediately, under the stimulus of a bottle of salts
held to her nostrils; and, when she opened her eyes, she saw bending
over her a young man, in evening-clothes, with a smiling and friendly
face, who said:
</p><p>"I implore your forgiveness, mademoiselle. All these happenings are a
trifle sudden and this behaviour rather out of the way. But
circumstances often compel us to deeds of which our conscience does not
approve. Pray pardon me."
</p><p>He took her hand very gently and slipped a broad gold ring on the girl's
finger, saying:
</p><p>"There, now we are engaged. Never forget the man who gave you this ring.
He entreats you not to run away from him ... and to stay in Paris and
await the proofs of his devotion. Have faith in him."
</p><p>He said all this in so serious and respectful a voice, with so much
authority and deference, that she had not the strength to resist. Their
eyes met. He whispered:
</p><p>"The exquisite purity of your eyes! It would be heavenly to live with
those eyes upon one. Now close them...."
</p><p>He withdrew. His accomplices followed suit. The car drove off, and the
house in the Rue de Varennes remained still and silent until the moment
when Angélique, regaining complete consciousness, called out for the
servants.
</p><p>They found the duke, Hyacinthe, the lady's maid and the porter and his
wife all tightly bound. A few priceless ornaments had disappeared, as
well as the duke's pocket-book and all his jewellery; tie pins, pearl
studs, watch and so on.
</p><p>The police were advised without delay. In the morning it appeared that,
on the evening before, d'Emboise, when leaving his house in the
motor-car, was stabbed by his own chauffeur and thrown, half-dead, into
a deserted street. Mussy and Caorches had each received a
telephone-message, purporting to come from the duke, countermanding
their attendance.
</p><p>Next week, without troubling further about the police investigation,
without obeying the summons of the examining-magistrate, without even
reading Arsène Lupin's letters to the papers on "the Varennes Flight,"
the duke, his daughter and his valet stealthily took a slow train for
Vannes and arrived one evening, at the old feudal castle that towers
over the headland of Sarzeau. The duke at once organized a defence with
the aid of the Breton peasants, true mediæval vassals to a man. On the
fourth day, Mussy arrived; on the fifth, Caorches; and, on the seventh,
d'Emboise, whose wound was not as severe as had been feared.
</p><p>The duke waited two days longer before communicating to those about him
what, now that his escape had succeeded in spite of Lupin, he called the
second part of his plan. He did so, in the presence of the three
cousins, by a dictatorial order to Angélique, expressed in these
peremptory terms:
</p><p>"All this bother is upsetting me terribly. I have entered on a struggle
with this man whose daring you have seen for yourself; and the struggle
is killing me. I want to end it at all costs. There is only one way of
doing so, Angélique, and that is for you to release me from all
responsibility by accepting the hand of one of your cousins. Before a
month is out, you must be the wife of Mussy, Caorches or d'Emboise. You
have a free choice. Make your decision."
</p><p>For four whole days Angélique wept and entreated her father, but in
vain. She felt that he would be inflexible and that she must end by
submitting to his wishes. She accepted:
</p><p>"Whichever you please, father. I love none of them. So I may as well be
unhappy with one as with the other."
</p><p>Thereupon a fresh discussion ensued, as the duke wanted to compel her to
make her own choice. She stood firm. Reluctantly and for financial
considerations, he named d'Emboise.
</p><p>The banns were published without delay.
</p><p>From that moment, the watch in and around the castle was increased
twofold, all the more inasmuch as Lupin's silence and the sudden
cessation of the campaign which he had been conducting in the press
could not but alarm the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme. It was obvious that the
enemy was getting ready to strike and would endeavour to oppose the
marriage by one of his characteristic moves.
</p><p>Nevertheless, nothing happened: nothing two days before the ceremony,
nothing on the day before, nothing on the morning itself. The marriage
took place in the mayor's office, followed by the religious celebration
in church; and the thing was done.
</p><p>Then and not till then, the duke breathed freely. Notwithstanding his
daughter's sadness, notwithstanding the embarrassed silence of his
son-in-law, who found the situation a little trying, he rubbed his hands
with an air of pleasure, as though he had achieved a brilliant victory:
</p><p>"Tell them to lower the drawbridge," he said to Hyacinthe, "and to admit
everybody. We have nothing more to fear from that scoundrel."
</p><p>After the wedding-breakfast, he had wine served out to the peasants and
clinked glasses with them. They danced and sang.
</p><p>At three o'clock, he returned to the ground-floor rooms. It was the hour
for his afternoon nap. He walked to the guard-room at the end of the
suite. But he had no sooner placed his foot on the threshold than he
stopped suddenly and exclaimed:
</p><p>"What are you doing here, d'Emboise? Is this a joke?"
</p><p>D'Emboise was standing before him, dressed as a Breton fisherman, in a
dirty jacket and breeches, torn, patched and many sizes too large for
him.
</p><p>The duke seemed dumbfounded. He stared with eyes of amazement at that
face which he knew and which, at the same time, roused memories of a
very distant past within his brain. Then he strode abruptly to one of
the windows overlooking the castle-terrace and called:
</p><p>"Angélique!"
</p><p>"What is it, father?" she asked, coming forward.
</p><p>"Where's your husband?"
</p><p>"Over there, father," said Angélique, pointing to d'Emboise, who was
smoking a cigarette and reading, some way off.
</p><p>The duke stumbled and fell into a chair, with a great shudder of fright:
</p><p>"Oh, I shall go mad!"
</p><p>But the man in the fisherman's garb knelt down before him and said:
</p><p>"Look at me, uncle. You know me, don't you? I'm your nephew, the one who
used to play here in the old days, the one whom you called Jacquot....
Just think a minute.... Here, look at this scar...."
</p><p>"Yes, yes," stammered the duke, "I recognize you. It's Jacques. But the
other one...."
</p><p>He put his hands to his head:
</p><p>"And yet, no, it can't be ... Explain yourself.... I don't
understand.... I don't want to understand...."
</p><p>There was a pause, during which the newcomer shut the window and closed
the door leading to the next room. Then he came up to the old duke,
touched him gently on the shoulder, to wake him from his torpor, and
without further preface, as though to cut short any explanation that was
not absolutely necessary, spoke as follows:
</p><p>"Four years ago, that is to say, in the eleventh year of my voluntary
exile, when I settled in the extreme south of Algeria, I made the
acquaintance, in the course of a hunting-expedition arranged by a big
Arab chief, of a man whose geniality, whose charm of manner, whose
consummate prowess, whose indomitable pluck, whose combined humour and
depth of mind fascinated me in the highest degree. The Comte d'Andrésy
spent six weeks as my guest. After he left, we kept up a correspondence
at regular intervals. I also often saw his name in the papers, in the
society and sporting columns. He was to come back and I was preparing to
receive him, three months ago, when, one evening as I was out riding, my
two Arab attendants flung themselves upon me, bound me, blindfolded me
and took me, travelling day and night, for a week, along deserted roads,
to a bay on the coast, where five men awaited them. I was at once
carried on board a small steam-yacht, which weighed anchor without
delay. There was nothing to tell me who the men were nor what their
object was in kidnapping me. They had locked me into a narrow cabin,
secured by a massive door and lighted by a port-hole protected by two
iron cross-bars. Every morning, a hand was inserted through a hatch
between the next cabin and my own and placed on my bunk two or three
pounds of bread, a good helping of food and a flagon of wine and removed
the remains of yesterday's meals, which I put there for the purpose.
From time to time, at night, the yacht stopped and I heard the sound of
the boat rowing to some harbour and then returning, doubtless with
provisions. Then we set out once more, without hurrying, as though on a
cruise of people of our class, who travel for pleasure and are not
pressed for time. Sometimes, standing on a chair, I would see the
coastline, through my port-hole, too indistinctly, however, to locate
it. And this lasted for weeks. One morning, in the ninth week, I
perceived that the hatch had been left unfastened and I pushed it open.
The cabin was empty at the time. With an effort, I was able to take a
nail-file from a dressing-table. Two weeks after that, by dint of
patient perseverance, I had succeeded in filing through the bars of my
port-hole and I could have escaped that way, only, though I am a good
swimmer, I soon grow tired. I had therefore to choose a moment when the
yacht was not too far from the land. It was not until yesterday that,
perched on my chair, I caught sight of the coast; and, in the evening,
at sunset, I recognized, to my astonishment, the outlines of the
Château de Sarzeau, with its pointed turrets and its square keep. I
wondered if this was the goal of my mysterious voyage. All night long,
we cruised in the offing. The same all day yesterday. At last, this
morning, we put in at a distance which I considered favourable, all the
more so as we were steaming through rocks under cover of which I could
swim unobserved. But, just as I was about to make my escape, I noticed
that the shutter of the hatch, which they thought they had closed, had
once more opened of itself and was flapping against the partition. I
again pushed it ajar from curiosity. Within arm's length was a little
cupboard which I managed to open and in which my hand, groping at
random, laid hold of a bundle of papers. This consisted of letters,
letters containing instructions addressed to the pirates who held me
prisoner. An hour later, when I wriggled through the port-hole and
slipped into the sea, I knew all: the reasons for my abduction, the
means employed, the object in view and the infamous scheme plotted
during the last three months against the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme and his
daughter. Unfortunately, it was too late. I was obliged, in order not to
be seen from the yacht, to crouch in the cleft of a rock and did not
reach land until mid-day. By the time that I had been to a fisherman's
cabin, exchanged my clothes for his and come on here, it was three
o'clock. On my arrival. I learnt that Angélique's marriage was
celebrated this morning."
</p><p>The old duke had not spoken a word. With his eyes riveted on the
stranger's, he was listening in ever-increasing dismay. At times, the
thought of the warnings given him by the prefect of police returned to
his mind:
</p><p>"They're nursing you, monsieur le duc, they are nursing you."
</p><p>He said, in a hollow voice:
</p><p>"Speak on ... finish your story.... All this is ghastly.... I don't
understand it yet ... and I feel nervous...."
</p><p>The stranger resumed:
</p><p>"I am sorry to say, the story is easily pieced together and is summed up
in a few sentences. It is like this: the Comte d'Andrésy remembered
several things from his stay with me and from the confidences which I
was foolish enough to make to him. First of all, I was your nephew and
yet you had seen comparatively little of me, because I left Sarzeau when
I was quite a child, and since then our intercourse was limited to the
few weeks which I spent here, fifteen years ago, when I proposed for the
hand of my Cousin Angélique; secondly, having broken with the past, I
received no letters; lastly, there was a certain physical resemblance
between d'Andrésy and myself which could be accentuated to such an
extent as to become striking. His scheme was built up on those three
points. He bribed my Arab servants to give him warning in case I left
Algeria. Then he went back to Paris, bearing my name and made up to look
exactly like me, came to see you, was invited to your house once a
fortnight and lived under my name, which thus became one of the many
aliases beneath which he conceals his real identity. Three months ago,
when 'the apple was ripe,' as he says in his letters, he began the
attack by a series of communications to the press; and, at the same
time, fearing no doubt that some newspaper would tell me in Algeria the
part that was being played under my name in Paris, he had me assaulted
by my servants and kidnapped by his confederates. I need not explain any
more in so far as you are concerned, uncle."
</p><p>The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme was shaken with a fit of nervous trembling.
The awful truth to which he refused to open his eyes appeared to him in
its nakedness and assumed the hateful countenance of the enemy. He
clutched his nephew's hands and said to him, fiercely, despairingly:
</p><p>"It's Lupin, is it not?"
</p><p>"Yes, uncle."
</p><p>"And it's to him ... it's to him that I have given my daughter!"
</p><p>"Yes, uncle, to him, who has stolen my name of Jacques d'Emboise from me
and stolen your daughter from you. Angélique is the wedded wife of
Arsène Lupin; and that in accordance with your orders. This letter in
his handwriting bears witness to it. He has upset your whole life,
thrown you off your balance, besieging your hours of waking and your
nights of dreaming, rifling your town-house, until the moment when,
seized with terror, you took refuge here, where, thinking that you would
escape his artifices and his rapacity, you told your daughter to choose
one of her three cousins, Mussy, d'Emboise or Caorches, as her husband.
</p><p>"But why did she select that one rather than the others?"
</p><p>"It was you who selected him, uncle."
</p><p>"At random ... because he had the biggest income...."
</p><p>"No, not at random, but on the insidious, persistent and very clever
advice of your servant Hyacinthe."
</p><p>The duke gave a start:
</p><p>"What! Is Hyacinthe an accomplice?"
</p><p>"No, not of Arsène Lupin, but of the man whom he believes to be
d'Emboise and who promised to give him a hundred thousand francs within
a week after the marriage."
</p><p>"Oh, the villain!... He planned everything, foresaw everything...."
</p><p>"Foresaw everything, uncle, down to shamming an attempt upon his life so
as to avert suspicion, down to shamming a wound received in your
service."
</p><p>"But with what object? Why all these dastardly tricks?"
</p><p>"Angélique has a fortune of eleven million francs. Your solicitor in
Paris was to hand the securities next week to the counterfeit d'Emboise,
who had only to realize them forthwith and disappear. But, this very
morning, you yourself were to hand your son-in-law, as a personal
wedding-present, five hundred thousand francs' worth of bearer-stock,
which he has arranged to deliver to one of his accomplices at nine
o'clock this evening, outside the castle, near the Great Oak, so that
they may be negotiated to-morrow morning in Brussels."
</p><p>The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme had risen from his seat and was stamping
furiously up and down the room:
</p><p>"At nine o'clock this evening?" he said. "We'll see about that.... We'll
see about that.... I'll have the gendarmes here before then...."
</p><p>"Arsène Lupin laughs at gendarmes."
</p><p>"Let's telegraph to Paris."
</p><p>"Yes, but how about the five hundred thousand francs?... And, still
worse, uncle, the scandal?... Think of this: your daughter, Angélique de
Sarzeau-Vendôme, married to that swindler, that thief.... No, no, it
would never do...."
</p><p>"What then?"
</p><p>"What?..."
</p><p>The nephew now rose and, stepping to a gun-rack, took down a rifle and
laid it on the table, in front of the duke:
</p><p>"Away in Algeria, uncle, on the verge of the desert, when we find
ourselves face to face with a wild beast, we do not send for the
gendarmes. We take our rifle and we shoot the wild beast. Otherwise, the
beast would tear us to pieces with its claws."
</p><p>"What do you mean?"
</p><p>"I mean that, over there, I acquired the habit of dispensing with the
gendarmes. It is a rather summary way of doing justice, but it is the
best way, believe me, and to-day, in the present case, it is the only
way. Once the beast is killed, you and I will bury it in some corner,
unseen and unknown."
</p><p>"And Angélique?"
</p><p>"We will tell her later."
</p><p>"What will become of her?"
</p><p>"She will be my wife, the wife of the real d'Emboise. I desert her
to-morrow and return to Algeria. The divorce will be granted in two
months' time."
</p><p>The duke listened, pale and staring, with set jaws. He whispered:
</p><p>"Are you sure that his accomplices on the yacht will not inform him of
your escape?"
</p><p>"Not before to-morrow."
</p><p>"So that ...?"
</p><p>"So that inevitably, at nine o'clock this evening, Arsène Lupin, on his
way to the Great Oak, will take the patrol-path that follows the old
ramparts and skirts the ruins of the chapel. I shall be there, in the
ruins."
</p><p>"I shall be there too," said the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme, quietly, taking
down a gun.
</p><p>It was now five o'clock. The duke talked some time longer to his nephew,
examined the weapons, loaded them with fresh cartridges. Then, when
night came, he took d'Emboise through the dark passages to his bedroom
and hid him in an adjoining closet.
</p><p>Nothing further happened until dinner. The duke forced himself to keep
calm during the meal. From time to time, he stole a glance at his
son-in-law and was surprised at the likeness between him and the real
d'Emboise. It was the same complexion, the same cast of features, the
same cut of hair. Nevertheless, the look of the eye was different,
keener in this case and brighter; and gradually the duke discovered
minor details which had passed unperceived till then and which proved
the fellow's imposture.
</p><p>The party broke up after dinner. It was eight o'clock. The duke went to
his room and released his nephew. Ten minutes later, under cover of the
darkness, they slipped into the ruins, gun in hand.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Angélique, accompanied by her husband, had gone to the suite
of rooms which she occupied on the ground-floor of a tower that flanked
the left wing. Her husband stopped at the entrance to the rooms and
said:
</p><p>"I am going for a short stroll, Angélique. May I come to you here, when
I return?"
</p><p>"Yes," she replied.
</p><p>He left her and went up to the first floor, which had been assigned to
him as his quarters. The moment he was alone, he locked the door,
noiselessly opened a window that looked over the landscape and leant
out. He saw a shadow at the foot of the tower, some hundred feet or more
below him. He whistled and received a faint whistle in reply.
</p><p>He then took from a cupboard a thick leather satchel, crammed with
papers, wrapped it in a piece of black cloth and tied it up. Then he
sat down at the table and wrote:
</p>
<p>    "Glad you got my message, for I think it unsafe to walk out of the
    castle with that large bundle of securities. Here they are. You
    will be in Paris, on your motor-cycle, in time to catch the morning
    train to Brussels, where you will hand over the bonds to Z.; and he
    will negotiate them at once.
</p><p>                                                                 "A. L.
</p><p>    "P. S.--As you pass by the Great Oak, tell our chaps that I'm
    coming. I have some instructions to give them. But everything is
    going well. No one here has the least suspicion."
</p>
<p>He fastened the letter to the parcel and lowered both through the window
with a length of string:
</p><p>"Good," he said. "That's all right. It's a weight off my mind."
</p><p>He waited a few minutes longer, stalking up and down the room and
smiling at the portraits of two gallant gentlemen hanging on the wall:
</p><p>"Horace de Sarzeau-Vendôme, marshal of France.... And you, the Great
Condé ... I salute you, my ancestors both. Lupin de Sarzeau-Vendôme will
show himself worthy of you."
</p><p>At last, when the time came, he took his hat and went down. But, when he
reached the ground-floor, Angélique burst from her rooms and exclaimed,
with a distraught air:
</p><p>"I say ... if you don't mind ... I think you had better...."
</p><p>And then, without saying more, she went in again, leaving a vision of
irresponsible terror in her husband's mind.
</p><p>"She's out of sorts," he said to himself. "Marriage doesn't suit her."
</p><p>He lit a cigarette and went out, without attaching importance to an
incident that ought to have impressed him:
</p><p>"Poor Angélique! This will all end in a divorce...."
</p><p>The night outside was dark, with a cloudy sky.
</p><p>The servants were closing the shutters of the castle. There was no light
in the windows, it being the duke's habit to go to bed soon after
dinner.
</p><p>Lupin passed the gate-keeper's lodge and, as he put his foot on the
drawbridge, said:
</p><p>"Leave the gate open. I am going for a breath of air; I shall be back
soon."
</p><p>The patrol-path was on the right and ran along one of the old ramparts,
which used to surround the castle with a second and much larger
enclosure, until it ended at an almost demolished postern-gate. The
park, which skirted a hillock and afterward followed the side of a deep
valley, was bordered on the left by thick coppices.
</p><p>"What a wonderful place for an ambush!" he said. "A regular cut-throat
spot!"
</p><p>He stopped, thinking that he heard a noise. But no, it was a rustling of
the leaves. And yet a stone went rattling down the slopes, bounding
against the rugged projections of the rock. But, strange to say, nothing
seemed to disquiet him. The crisp sea-breeze came blowing over the
plains of the headland; and he eagerly filled his lungs with it:
</p><p>"What a thing it is to be alive!" he thought. "Still young, a member of
the old nobility, a multi-millionaire: what could a man want more?"
</p><p>At a short distance, he saw against the darkness the yet darker outline
of the chapel, the ruins of which towered above the path. A few drops of
rain began to fall; and he heard a clock strike nine. He quickened his
pace. There was a short descent; then the path rose again. And suddenly,
he stopped once more.
</p><p>A hand had seized his.
</p><p>He drew back, tried to release himself.
</p><p>But some one stepped from the clump of trees against which he was
brushing; and a voice said; "Ssh!... Not a word!..."
</p><p>He recognized his wife, Angélique:
</p><p>"What's the matter?" he asked.
</p><p>She whispered, so low that he could hardly catch the words:
</p><p>"They are lying in wait for you ... they are in there, in the ruins,
with their guns...."
</p><p>"Who?"
</p><p>"Keep quiet.... Listen...."
</p><p>They stood for a moment without stirring; then she said:
</p><p>"They are not moving.... Perhaps they never heard me.... Let's go
back...."
</p><p>"But...."
</p><p>"Come with me."
</p><p>Her accent was so imperious that he obeyed without further question. But
suddenly she took fright:
</p><p>"Run!... They are coming!... I am sure of it!..."
</p><p>True enough, they heard a sound of footsteps.
</p><p>Then, swiftly, still holding him by the hand, she dragged him, with
irresistible energy, along a shortcut, following its turns without
hesitation in spite of the darkness and the brambles. And they very soon
arrived at the drawbridge.
</p><p>She put her arm in his. The gate-keeper touched his cap. They crossed
the courtyard and entered the castle; and she led him to the corner
tower in which both of them had their apartments:
</p><p>"Come in here," she said.
</p><p>"To your rooms?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Two maids were sitting up for her. Their mistress ordered them to retire
to their bedrooms, on the third floor.
</p><p>Almost immediately after, there was a knock at the door of the outer
room; and a voice called:
</p><p>"Angélique!"
</p><p>"Is that you, father?" she asked, suppressing her agitation.
</p><p>"Yes. Is your husband here?"
</p><p>"We have just come in."
</p><p>"Tell him I want to speak to him. Ask him to come to my room. It's
important."
</p><p>"Very well, father, I'll send him to you."
</p><p>She listened for a few seconds, then returned to the boudoir where her
husband was and said:
</p><p>"I am sure my father is still there."
</p><p>He moved as though to go out:
</p><p>"In that case, if he wants to speak to me...."
</p><p>"My father is not alone," she said, quickly, blocking his way.
</p><p>"Who is with him?"
</p><p>"His nephew, Jacques d'Emboise."
</p><p>There was a moment's silence. He looked at her with a certain
astonishment, failing quite to understand his wife's attitude. But,
without pausing to go into the matter:
</p><p>"Ah, so that dear old d'Emboise is there?" he chuckled. "Then the fat's
in the fire? Unless, indeed...."
</p><p>"My father knows everything," she said. "I overheard a conversation
between them just now. His nephew has read certain letters.... I
hesitated at first about telling you.... Then I thought that my
duty...."
</p><p>He studied her afresh. But, at once conquered by the queerness of the
situation, he burst out laughing:
</p><p>"What? Don't my friends on board ship burn my letters? And they have let
their prisoner escape? The idiots! Oh, when you don't see to everything
yourself!... No matter, its distinctly humorous.... D'Emboise versus
d'Emboise.... Oh, but suppose I were no longer recognized? Suppose
d'Emboise himself were to confuse me with himself?"
</p><p>He turned to a wash-hand-stand, took a towel, dipped it in the basin and
soaped it and, in the twinkling of an eye, wiped the make-up from his
face and altered the set of his hair:
</p><p>"That's it," he said, showing himself to Angélique under the aspect in
which she had seen him on the night of the burglary in Paris. "I feel
more comfortable like this for a discussion with my father-in-law."
</p><p>"Where are you going?" she cried, flinging herself in front of the door.
</p><p>"Why, to join the gentlemen."
</p><p>"You shall not pass!"
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"Suppose they kill you?"
</p><p>"Kill me?"
</p><p>"That's what they mean to do, to kill you ... to hide your body
somewhere.... Who would know of it?"
</p><p>"Very well," he said, "from their point of view, they are quite right.
But, if I don't go to them, they will come here. That door won't stop
them.... Nor you, I'm thinking. Therefore, it's better to have done with
it."
</p><p>"Follow me," commanded Angélique.
</p><p>She took up the lamp that lit the room, went into her bedroom, pushed
aside the wardrobe, which slid easily on hidden castors, pulled back an
old tapestry-hanging, and said:
</p><p>"Here is a door that has not been used for years. My father believes the
key to be lost. I have it here. Unlock the door with it. A staircase in
the wall will take you to the bottom of the tower. You need only draw
the bolts of another door and you will be free."
</p><p>He could hardly believe his ears. Suddenly, he grasped the meaning of
Angélique's whole behaviour. In front of that sad, plain, but
wonderfully gentle face, he stood for a moment discountenanced, almost
abashed. He no longer thought of laughing. A feeling of respect, mingled
with remorse and kindness, overcame him.
</p><p>"Why are you saving me?" he whispered.
</p><p>"You are my husband."
</p><p>He protested:
</p><p>"No, no ... I have stolen that title. The law will never recognize my
marriage."
</p><p>"My father does not want a scandal," she said.
</p><p>"Just so," he replied, sharply, "just so. I foresaw that; and that was
why I had your cousin d'Emboise near at hand. Once I disappear, he
becomes your husband. He is the man you have married in the eyes of
men."
</p><p>"You are the man I have married in the eyes of the Church."
</p><p>"The Church! The Church! There are means of arranging matters with the
Church.... Your marriage can be annulled."
</p><p>"On what pretext that we can admit?"
</p><p>He remained silent, thinking over all those points which he had not
considered, all those points which were trivial and absurd for him, but
which were serious for her, and he repeated several times:
</p><p>"This is terrible ... this is terrible.... I should have
anticipated...."
</p><p>And, suddenly, seized with an idea, he clapped his hands and cried:
</p><p>"There, I have it! I'm hand in glove with one of the chief figures at
the Vatican. The Pope never refuses me anything. I shall obtain an
audience and I have no doubt that the Holy Father, moved by my
entreaties...."
</p><p>His plan was so humorous and his delight so artless that Angélique could
not help smiling; and she said:
</p><p>"I am your wife in the eyes of God."
</p><p>She gave him a look that showed neither scorn nor animosity, nor even
anger; and he realized that she omitted to see in him the outlaw and the
evil-doer and remembered only the man who was her husband and to whom
the priest had bound her until the hour of death.
</p><p>He took a step toward her and observed her more attentively. She did not
lower her eyes at first. But she blushed. And never had he seen so
pathetic a face, marked with such modesty and such dignity. He said to
her, as on that first evening in Paris:
</p><p>"Oh, your eyes ... the calm and sadness of your eyes ... the beauty of
your eyes!"
</p><p>She dropped her head and stammered:
</p><p>"Go away ... go ..."
</p><p>In the presence of her confusion, he received a quick intuition of the
deeper feelings that stirred her, unknown to herself. To that spinster
soul, of which he recognized the romantic power of imagination, the
unsatisfied yearnings, the poring over old-world books, he suddenly
represented, in that exceptional moment and in consequence of the
unconventional circumstances of their meetings, somebody special, a
Byronic hero, a chivalrous brigand of romance. One evening, in spite of
all obstacles, he, the world-famed adventurer, already ennobled in song
and story and exalted by his own audacity, had come to her and slipped
the magic ring upon her finger: a mystic and passionate betrothal, as in
the days of the <u>Corsair</u> and <u>Hernani</u>.... Greatly moved and touched,
he was on the verge of giving way to an enthusiastic impulse and
exclaiming:
</p><p>"Let us go away together!... Let us fly!... You are my bride ... my
wife.... Share my dangers, my sorrows and my joys.... It will be a
strange and vigorous, a proud and magnificent life...."
</p><p>But Angélique's eyes were raised to his again; and they were so pure and
so noble that he blushed in his turn. This was not the woman to whom
such words could be addressed.
</p><p>He whispered:
</p><p>"Forgive me.... I am a contemptible wretch.... I have wrecked your
life...."
</p><p>"No," she replied, softly. "On the contrary, you have shown me where my
real life lies."
</p><p>He was about to ask her to explain. But she had opened the door and was
pointing the way to him. Nothing more could be spoken between them. He
went out without a word, bowing very low as he passed.
</p><hr/>
<p>A month later, Angélique de Sarzeau-Vendôme, Princesse de Bourbon-Condé,
lawful wife of Arsène Lupin, took the veil and, under the name of Sister
Marie-Auguste, buried herself within the walls of the Visitation
Convent.
</p><p>On the day of the ceremony, the mother superior of the convent received
a heavy sealed envelope containing a letter with the following words:
</p>
<p>    "For Sister Marie-Auguste's poor."
</p>
<p>Enclosed with the letter were five hundred bank-notes of a thousand
francs each.
