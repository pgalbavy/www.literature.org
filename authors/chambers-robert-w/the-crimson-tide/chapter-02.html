<p>They were a weary, half-starved and travel-stained quartette
when the Red Guards stopped them for the last time in Russia and
passed them through, warning them that the White Guards would
surely do murder if they caught them.</p>

<p>The next day the White Guards halted them, but finally passed
them through, counselling them to keep out of the way of the Red
Guards if they wished to escape being shot at sight.</p>

<p>In the neat, shiny, carefully scrubbed little city of Helsingfors
they avoided the huns by some miracle&mdash;one of Brisson's customary
miracles&mdash;but another little company of Americans and English
was halted and detained, and one harmless Yankee among them was
arrested and packed off to a hun prison.</p>

<p>Also, a large and nervous party of fugitives of mixed nationalities
and professions&mdash;consuls, chargés, attachés, and innocent, agitated
citizens&mdash;was summarily grabbed and ordered into indefinite limbo.</p>

<p>But Brisson's daily miracles continued to materialise, even in
the land of the Finn. By train, by sleigh, by boat, his quartette
floundered along toward safety, and finally emerged from the white
hell of the Red people into the sub-arctic sun &mdash;Estridge
with painfully scanty luggage, Palla Dumont with none at all,
Ilse Westgard carrying only her Cossack saddle-bags, and Brisson
with his damning papers still sewed inside his clothes, and owing
Estridge ten dollars for not getting murdered.</p>

<p>They all had become excellent comrades during those anxious days
of hunger, fatigue and common peril, but they were also a little
tired of one another, as becomes all friends when subjected to
compulsory companionship for an unreasonable period.</p>

<p>And even when one is beginning to fall in love, one can become
surfeited with the beloved under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Besides, Estridge's budding sentiment for Ilse Westgard, and
her wholesome and girlish inclination for him, suffered an early
chill. For the poor child had acquired trench pets from the Cossacks,
and had passed on a few to Estridge, with whom she had been constantly
seated on the front seat.</p>

<p>Being the frankest thing in Russia, she told him with tears in
her blue eyes; and they had a most horrid time of it before they
came finally to a sanitary plant erected to attend to such matters.</p>

<p>Episodes of that sort discourage sentiment; so does cold, hunger
and discomfort incident on sardine-like promiscuousness.</p>

<p>Nobody in the party desired to know more than they already knew
concerning anybody else. In fact, there was little more to know,
privacy being impossible. And the ever instinctive hostility of
the two sexes, always and irrevocably latent, became vaguely apparent
at moments.</p>

<p>Common danger swept it away at times; but reaction gradually
revealed again what is born under the human skin&mdash;the paradox
called sex-antipathy. And yet the men in the party would not have
hesitated to sacrifice their lives in defence of these women,
nor would the women have faltered under the same test.</p>

<p>Brisson was the philosophical stoic of the quartette. Estridge
groused sometimes. Palla, when she thought herself unnoticed,
camouflaged her face in her furs and cried now and then. And occasionally
Ilse Westgard tried the patience of the others by her healthy
capacity for unfeigned laughter&mdash;sometimes during danger-laden
and inopportune moments, and once in the shocking imminence of
death itself.</p>

<p>As, for example, in a vile little village, full of vermin and
typhus, some hunger-crazed peasants, armed with stolen rifles
and ammunition, awoke them where they lay on the straw of a stable,
cursed them for aristocrats, and marched them outside to a convenient
wall, at the foot of which sprawled half a dozen blood-soaked,
bayoneted and bullet-riddled landlords and land owners of the
district.</p>

<p>And things had assumed a terribly serious aspect when, to their
foolish consternation, the peasants discovered that their purloined
cartridges did not fit their guns.</p>

<p>Then, in the very teeth of death, Ilse threw back her blond head
and laughed. And there was no mistaking the genuineness of the
girl's laughter.</p>

<p>Some of their would-be executioners laughed too;&mdash;the hilarity
spread. It was all over; they couldn't shoot a girl who laughed
that way. So somebody brought a samovar; tea was boiled; and they
all went back to the barn and sat there drinking tea and swapping
gossip and singing until nearly morning.</p>

<p>That was a sample of their narrow escapes. But Brisson's only
comment before he went to sleep was that Estridge would probably
owe him a dollar within the next twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>They had a hair-raising time in Helsingfors. On one occasion,
German officers forced Palla's door at night, and the girl became
ill with fear while soldiers searched the room, ordering her out
of bed and pushing her into a corner while they ripped up carpets
and tore the place to pieces in a swinishly ferocious search for
"information."</p>

<p>But they did nothing worse to her, and, for some reason, left
the hotel without disturbing Brisson, whose room adjoined and
who sat on the edge of his bed with an automatic in each hand&mdash;a
dangerous opportunist awaiting events and calmly determined to
do some recruiting for hell if the huns harmed Palla.</p>

<p>She never knew that. And the worst was over now, and the Scandinavian
border not far away. And in twenty-four hours they were over &mdash;Brisson
impatient to get his papers to Washington and planning to start
for England on a wretched little packet-boat, in utter contempt
of mines, U-boats, and the icy menace of the North Sea.</p>

<p>As for the others, Estridge decided to cable and await orders
in Copenhagen; Palla, to sail for home on the first available
Danish steamer; Ilse, to go to Stockholm and eventually decide
whether to volunteer once more as a soldier of the proletariat
or to turn propagandist and carry the true gospel to America,
where, she had heard, the ancient liberties of the great Democracy
were becoming imperilled.</p>

<p>The day before they parted company, these four people, so oddly
thrown together out of the boiling cauldron of the Russian Terror,
arranged to dine together for the last time.</p>

<p>Theirs were the appetites of healthy wolves; theirs was the thirst
of the marooned on waterless islands; and theirs, too, was the
feverish gaiety of those who had escaped great peril by land and
sea; and who were still physically and morally demoralized by
the glare and the roar of the hellish conflagration which was
still burning up the world around them.</p>

<p>So they met in a private dining room of the hotel for dinner
on the eve of separation.</p>

<p>Brisson and Estridge had resurrected from their luggage the remains
of their evening attire; Ilse and Palla had shopped; and they
now included in a limited wardrobe two simple dinner gowns, among
more vital purchases.</p>

<p>There were flowers on the table, no great variety of food but
plenty of champagne to make up&mdash;a singular innovation in apology
for short rations conceived by the hotel proprietor.</p>

<p>There was a victrola in the corner, too, and this they kept going
to stimulate their nerves, which already were sufficiently on
edge without the added fillip of music and champagne.</p>

<p>"As for me," said Brisson, "I'm in sight of nervous dissolution
already; &mdash;I'm going back to my wife and children, thank
God&mdash;" he smiled at Palla. "I'm grateful to the God you don't
believe in, dear little lady. And if He is willing, I'll report
for duty in two weeks." He turned to Estridge:</p>

<p>"What about you?"</p>

<p>"I've cabled for orders but I have none yet. If they're through
with me I shall go back to New York and back to the medical school
I came from. I hate the idea, too. Lord, how I detest it!"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Palla nervously.</p>

<p>"I've had too much excitement. You have too&mdash;and so have Ilse
and Brisson. I'm not keen for the usual again. It bores me to
contemplate it. The thought of Fifth Avenue&mdash;the very idea of
going back to all that familiar routine, social and business,
makes me positively ill. What a dull place this world will be
when we're all at peace again!"</p>

<p>"We won't be at peace for a long, long while," said Ilse, smiling.
She lifted a goblet in her big, beautifully shaped hand and drained
it with the vigorous grace of a Viking's daughter.</p>

<p>"You think the war is going to last for years?" asked Estridge.</p>

<p>"Oh, no; not this war. But the other," she explained cheerfully.</p>

<p>"What other?"</p>

<p>"Why, the greatest conflict in the world; the social war. It's
going to take many years and many battles. I shall enlist."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Brisson, "you're not a Red!"</p>

<p>The girl laughed and showed her snowy teeth: "I'm one kind of
Red&mdash;not the kind that sold Russia to the boche&mdash;but I'm very,
very red."</p>

<p>"Everybody with a brain and a heart is more or less red in these
days," nodded Palla. "Everybody knows that the old order is ended&mdash;done
for. Without liberty and equal opportunity civilisation is a farce.
Everybody knows it except the stupid. And they'll have to be instructed."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Brisson briskly, "here's to the universal but
bloodless revolution! An acre for everybody and a mule to plough
it! Back to the soil and to hell with the counting house!"</p>

<p>They all laughed, but their brimming glasses went up; then Estridge
rose to re-wind the victrola. Palla's slim foot tapped the parquet
in time with the American fox-trot; she glanced across the table
at Estridge, lifted her head interrogatively, then sprang up and
slid into his arms, delighted.</p>

<p>While they danced he said: "Better go light on that champagne,
Miss Dumont."</p>

<p>"Don't you think I can keep my head?" she demanded derisively.</p>

<p>"Not if you keep up with Ilse. You're not built that way."</p>

<p>"I wish I were. I wish I were nearly six feet tall and beautiful
in every limb and feature as she is. What wonderful children she
could have! What magnificent hair she must have had before she
sheared it for the Woman's Battalion! Now it's all a dense, short
mass of gold&mdash;she looks like a lovely boy who requires a barber."</p>

<p>"Your hair is not unbecoming, either," he remarked, "&mdash;short
as it is, it's a mop of curls and very fetching."</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny?" she said. "I sheared mine for the sake of Mother
Church; Ilse cut off hers for the honour of the Army! Now we're
both out of a job&mdash;with only our cropped heads to show for the
experience!&mdash;and no more army and no more church&mdash;at least, as
far as I am concerned!"</p>

<p>And she threw back hers with its thick, glossy curls and laughed,
looking up at him out of her virginal brown eyes of a child.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I cut my hair," she added presently. "I look like
a Bolshevik."</p>

<p>"It's growing very fast," he said encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, it grows fast," she nodded indifferently. "Shall we
return to the table? I am rather thirsty."</p>

<p>Ilse and Brisson were engaged in an animated conversation when
they reseated themselves. The waiter arrived about that time with
another course of poor food.</p>

<p>Palla, disregarding Estridge's advice, permitted the waiter to
refill her glass.</p>

<p>"I can't eat that unappetising entrée," she insisted, "and champagne,
they say, is nourishing and I'm still hungry."</p>

<p>"As you please," said Brisson; "but you've had two glasses already."</p>

<p>"I don't care," she retorted childishly; "I mean to live to the
utmost in future. For the first time in my silly existence I intend
to be natural. I wonder what it feels like to become a little
intoxicated?"</p>

<p>"It feels rotten," remarked Estridge.</p>

<p>"Really? <em>How</em> rotten?" She laughed again, laid her hand
on the goblet's stem and glanced across at him defiantly, mischievously.
However, she seemed to reconsider the matter, for she picked up
a cigarette and lighted it at a candle.</p>

<p>"Bah!" she exclaimed with a wry face. "It stings!"</p>

<p>But she ventured another puff or two before placing it upon a
saucer among its defunct fellows.</p>

<p>"Ugh!" she complained again with a gay little shiver, and bit
into a pear as though to wash out the contamination of unaccustomed
nicotine.</p>

<p>"Where are you going when we all say good-bye?" inquired Estridge.</p>

<p>"I? Oh, I'm certainly going home on the first Danish boat&mdash;home
to Shadow Hill, where I told you I lived."</p>

<p>"And you have nobody but your aunt?"</p>

<p>"Only that one old lady."</p>

<p>"You won't remain long at Shadow Hill," he predicted.</p>

<p>"It's very pretty there. Why don't you think I am likely to remain?"</p>

<p>"You won't remain," he repeated. "You've slipped your cable.
You're hoisting sail. And it worries me a little."</p>

<p>The girl laughed. "It's a pretty place, Shadow Hill, but it's
dull. Everybody in the town is dull, stupid, and perfectly satisfied:
everybody owns at least that acre which Ilse demands; there's
no discontent at Shadow Hill, and no reason for it. I really couldn't
bear it," she added gaily; "I want to go where there's healthy
discontent, wholesome competition, natural aspiration&mdash;where things
must be bettered, set right, helped. You understand? That is where
I wish to be."</p>

<p>Brisson heard her. "Can't you practise your loving but godless
creed at Shadow Hill?" he inquired, amused. "Can't you lavish
love on the contented and well-to-do?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Brisson," she replied with sweet irony, "but where
the poor and loveless fight an ever losing battle is still a better
place for me to practise my godless creed and my Law of Love."</p>

<p>"Aha!" he retorted, "&mdash;a brand new excuse for living in New York
because all young girls love it!"</p>

<p>"Indeed," she said with some little heat, "I certainly do intend
to live and not to stagnate! I intend to live as hard as I can&mdash;live
and enjoy life with all my might! Can one serve the world better
than by loving it enough to live one's own life through to the
last happy rags? Can one give one's fellow creatures a better
example than to live every moment happily and proclaim the world
good to live in, and mankind good to live with?"</p>

<p>Ilse whispered, leaning near: "Don't take any more champagne,
Palla."</p>

<p>The girl frowned, then looked serious: "No, I won't," she said
naïvely. "But it is wonderful how eloquent it makes one feel,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>And to Estridge: "You know that this is quite the first wine
I have ever tasted&mdash;except at Communion. I was brought up to think
it meant destruction. And afterward, wherever I travelled to study,
the old prejudice continued to guide me. And after that, even
when I began to think of taking the veil, I made abstinence one
of my first preliminary vows.... And <em>look</em> what I've been
doing to-night!"</p>

<p>She held up her glass, tasted it, emptied it.</p>

<p>"There," she said, "I desired to shock you. I don't really want
any more. Shall we dance? Ilse! Why don't you seize Mr. Brisson
and make him two-step?"</p>

<p>"Please seize me," added Brisson gravely.</p>

<p>Ilse rose, big, fresh, smilingly inviting; Brisson inspected
her seriously&mdash;he was only half as tall&mdash;then he politely encircled
her waist and led her out.</p>

<p>They danced as though they could not get enough of it&mdash;exhilaration
due to reaction from the long strain during dangerous days.</p>

<p>It was already morning, but they danced on. Palla's delicate
intoxication passed&mdash;returned&mdash;passed&mdash;hovered like a rosy light
in her brain, but faded always as she danced.</p>

<p>There were snapping-crackers and paper caps; and they put them
on and pelted each other with the drooping table flowers.</p>

<p>Then Estridge went to the piano and sang an ancient song, called
"The Cork Leg"&mdash;not very well&mdash;but well intended and in a gay
and inoffensive voice.</p>

<p>But Ilse sang some wonderful songs which she had learned in the
Battalion of Death.</p>

<p>And that is what was being done when a waiter knocked and asked
whether they might desire to order breakfast.</p>

<p>That ended it. The hour of parting had arrived.</p>

<p>No longer bored with one another, they shook hands cordially,
regretfully.</p>
