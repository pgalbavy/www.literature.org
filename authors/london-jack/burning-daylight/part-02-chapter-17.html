<P>
Daylight had been wholly truthful when he told Dede that he had
no real friends.  On speaking terms with thousands, on fellowship
and drinking terms with hundreds, he was a lonely man.  He failed
to find the one man, or group of several men, with whom he could
be really intimate.  Cities did not make for comradeship as did
the Alaskan trail.  Besides, the types of men were different. 
Scornful and contemptuous of business men on the one hand, on the
other his relations with the San Francisco bosses had been more
an alliance of expediency than anything else.  He had felt more
of kinship for the franker brutality of the bosses and their
captains, but they had failed to claim any deep respect.  They
were too prone to crookedness.  Bonds were better than men's word
in this modern world, and one had to look carefully to the bonds.
<P>
In the old Yukon days it had been different.  Bonds didn't go.  A
man said he had so much, and even in a poker game his appeasement
was accepted.
<P>
Larry Hegan, who rose ably to the largest demands of Daylight's
operations and who had few illusions and less hypocrisy, might
have proved a chum had it not been for his temperamental twist. 
Strange genius that he was, a Napoleon of the law, with a power
of visioning that far exceeded Daylight's, he had nothing in
common with Daylight outside the office.  He spent his time with
books, a thing Daylight could not abide.  Also, he devoted
himself to the endless writing of plays which never got beyond
manuscript form, and, though Daylight only sensed the secret
taint of it, was a confirmed but temperate eater of hasheesh. 
Hegan lived all his life cloistered with books in a world of
agitation.  With the out-of-door world he had no understanding
nor tolerance.  In food and drink he was abstemious as a monk,
while exercise was a thing abhorrent.  Daylight's friendships, in
lieu of anything closer, were drinking friendships and roistering
friendships.  And with the passing of the Sunday rides with Dede,
he fell back more and more upon these for diversion.  The
cocktail wall of inhibition he reared more assiduously than ever.
<P>
The big red motor-car was out more frequently now, while a stable
hand was hired to give Bob exercise.  In his early San Francisco
days, there had been intervals of easement between his deals, but
in this present biggest deal of all the strain was unremitting.  
Not in a month, or two, or three, could his huge land investment
be carried to a successful consummation.  And so complete and
wide-reaching was it that complications and knotty situations
constantly arose.  Every day brought its problems, and when he
had solved them in his masterful way, he left the office in his
big car, almost sighing with relief at anticipation of the
approaching double Martini.  Rarely was he made tipsy.  His
constitution was too strong for that.  Instead, he was that
direst of all drinkers, the steady drinker, deliberate and
controlled, who averaged a far higher quantity of alcohol than
the irregular and violent drinker.  For six weeks hard-running he
had seen nothing of Dede except in the office, and there he
resolutely refrained from making approaches.  But by the seventh
Sunday his hunger for her overmastered him.  It was a stormy day.
<P>
A heavy southeast gale was blowing, and squall after squall of
rain and wind swept over the city.  He could not take his mind
off of her, and a persistent picture came to him of her sitting
by a window and sewing feminine fripperies of some sort.  When
the time came for his first pre-luncheon cocktail to be served to
him in his rooms, he did not take it.
<P>
Filled with a daring determination, he glanced at his note book
for Dede's telephone number, and called for the switch.
<P>
At first it was her landlady's daughter who was raised, but in a
minute he heard the voice he had been hungry to hear.
<P>
"I just wanted to tell you that I'm coming out to see you," he
said.  "I didn't want to break in on you without warning, that
was all."
<P>
"Has something happened?" came her voice.  
<P>
"I'll tell you when I get there," he evaded.
<P>
He left the red car two blocks away and arrived on foot at the
pretty, three-storied, shingled Berkeley house.  For an instant
only, he was aware of an inward hesitancy, but the next moment he
rang the bell.  He knew that what he was doing was in direct
violation of her wishes, and that he was setting her a difficult
task to receive as a Sunday caller the multimillionaire and
notorious Elam Harnish of newspaper fame.  On the other hand, the
one thing he did not expect of her was what he would have termed
"silly female capers."
<P>
And in this he was not disappointed.
<P>
She came herself to the door to receive him and shake hands with
him.  He hung his mackintosh and hat on the rack in the
comfortable square hall and turned to her for direction.
<P>
"They are busy in there," she said, indicating the parlor from
which came the boisterous voices of young people, and through the
open door of which he could see several college youths.  "So you
will have to come into my rooms."
<P>
She led the way through the door opening out of the hall to the
right, and, once inside, he stood awkwardly rooted to the floor,
gazing about him and at her and all the time trying not to gaze. 
In his perturbation he failed to hear and see her invitation to a
seat.  So these were her quarters.  the intimacy of it and her
making no fuss about it was startling, but it was no more than he
would have expected of her.  It was almost two rooms in one, the
one he was in evidently the sitting-room, and the one he could
see into, the bedroom.  Beyond an oaken dressing-table, with an
orderly litter of combs and brushes and dainty feminine
knickknacks, there was no sign of its being used as a bedroom. 
The broad couch, with a cover of old rose and banked high with
cushions, he decided must be the bed, but it was farthest from
any experience of a civilized bed he had ever had.
<P>
Not that he saw much of detail in that awkward moment of
standing.  His general impression was one of warmth and comfort
and beauty.  There were no carpets, and on the hardwood floor he
caught a glimpse of several wolf and coyote skins.  What captured
and perceptibly held his eye for a moment was a Crouched Venus
that stood on a Steinway upright against a background of
mountain-lion skin on the wall.
<P>
But it was Dede herself that smote most sharply upon sense and
perception.  He had always cherished the idea that she was very
much a woman--the lines of her figure, her hair, her eyes, her
voice, and birdlike laughing ways had all contributed to this;
but here, in her own rooms, clad in some flowing, clinging gown,
the emphasis of sex was startling.  He had been accustomed to her
only in trim tailor suits and shirtwaists, or in riding costume
of velvet corduroy, and he was not prepared for this new
revelation.  She seemed so much softer, so much more pliant, and
tender, and lissome.  She was a part of this atmosphere of
quietude and beauty.  She fitted into it just as she had fitted
in with the sober office furnishings.
<P>
"Won't you sit down?" she repeated.
<P>
He felt like an animal long denied food.  His hunger for her
welled up in him, and he proceeded to "wolf" the dainty morsel
before him.  Here was no patience, no diplomacy.  The
straightest, direct way was none too quick for him and, had he
known it, the least unsuccessful way he could have chosen.
<P>
"Look here," he said, in a voice that shook with passion,
"there's one thing I won't do, and that's propose to you in the
office.  That's why I'm here.  Dede Mason, I want you.  I just
want
you."
<P>
While he spoke he advanced upon her, his black eyes burning with
bright fire, his aroused blood swarthy in his cheek.
<P>
So precipitate was he, that she had barely time to cry out her
involuntary alarm and to step back, at the same time catching one
of his hands as he attempted to gather her into his arms.
<P>
In contrast to him, the blood had suddenly left her cheeks.  The
hand that had warded his off and that still held it, was
trembling.  She relaxed her fingers, and his arm dropped to his
side.  She wanted to say something, do something, to pass on from
the awkwardness of the situation, but no intelligent thought nor
action came into her mind.  She was aware only of a desire to
laugh.  This impulse was party hysterical and partly spontaneous
humor--the latter growing from instant to instant.  Amazing as
the affair was, the ridiculous side of it was not veiled to her. 
She felt like one who had suffered the terror of the onslaught of
a murderous footpad only to find out that it was an innocent
pedestrian asking the time.
<P>
Daylight was the quicker to achieve action.  "Oh, I know I'm a
sure enough fool," he said.  "I-I guess I'll sit down.  Don't be
scairt, Miss Mason.  I'm not real dangerous."
<P>
"I'm not afraid," she answered, with a smile, slipping down
herself into a chair, beside which, on the floor, stood a
sewing-basket from which, Daylight noted, some white fluffy thing
of lace and muslin overflowed.  Again she smiled.  "Though I
confess you did startle me for the moment."
<P>
"It's funny," Daylight sighed, almost with regret; "here I am,
strong enough to bend you around and tie knots in you.  Here I
am, used to having my will with man and beast and anything.  And
here I am sitting in this chair, as weak and helpless as a little
lamb.  You sure take the starch out of me."
<P>
Dede vainly cudgeled her brains in quest of a reply to these
remarks.  Instead, her thought dwelt insistently upon the
significance of his stepping aside, in the middle of a violent
proposal, in order to make irrelevant remarks.  What struck her
was the man's certitude.  So little did he doubt that he would
have her, that he could afford to pause and generalize upon love
and the effects of love.
<P>
She noted his hand unconsciously slipping in the familiar way
into the side coat pocket where she knew he carried his tobacco
and brown papers.
<P>
"You may smoke, if you want to," she said.  He withdrew his hand
with a jerk, as if something in the pocket had stung him.
<P>
"No, I wasn't thinking of smoking.  I was thinking of you. 
What's a man to do when he wants a woman but ask her to marry
him?  That's all that I'm doing.  I can't do it in style.  I
know that.  But I can use straight English, and that's good
enough for me.  I sure want you mighty bad, Miss Mason.  You're
in my mind 'most all the time, now.  And what I want to know
is--well, do you want me?  That's all."    
<P>
"I-I wish you hadn't asked," she said softly.  
<P>
"Mebbe it's best you should know a few things before you give me
an answer," he went on, ignoring the fact that the answer had
already been given.  "I never went after a woman before in my
life, all reports to the contrary not withstanding.  The stuff
you read about me in the papers and books, about me being a
lady-killer, is all wrong. There's not an iota of truth in it.  I
guess I've done more than my share of card-playing and
whiskey-drinking, but women I've let alone.  There was a woman
that killed herself, but I didn't know she wanted me that bad or
else I'd have married her--not for love, but to keep her from
killing herself.  She was the best of the boiling, but I never
gave her any encouragement.  I'm telling you all this because
you've read about it, and I want you to get it straight from me. 
<P>
"Lady-killer! " he snorted.  "Why, Miss Mason, I don't mind
telling you that I've sure been scairt of women all my life. 
You're the first one I've not been afraid of.  That's the strange
thing about it.  I just plumb worship you, and yet I'm not afraid
of you.  Mebbe it's because you're different from the women I
know.  You've never chased me.  Lady-killer!  Why, I've been
running away from ladies ever since I can remember, and I
guess all that saved me was that I was strong in the wind and
that I never fell down and broke a leg or anything.
<P>
"I didn't ever want to get married until after I met you, and
until a long time after I met you.  I cottoned to you from the
start; but I never thought it would get as bad as marriage.  Why,
I can't get to sleep nights, thinking of you and wanting you."
<P>
He came to a stop and waited.  She had taken the lace and muslin
from the basket, possibly to settle her nerves and wits, and was
sewing upon it.  As she was not looking at him, he devoured her
with his eyes.  He noted the firm, efficient hands--hands that
could control a horse like Bob, that could run a typewriter
almost as fast as a man could talk, that could sew on dainty
garments, and that, doubtlessly, could play on the piano over
there in the corner.  Another ultra-feminine detail he
noticed--her slippers.  They were small and bronze.  He had never
imagined she had such a small foot.  Street shoes and riding
boots were all that he had ever seen on her feet, and they had
given no advertisement of this.  The bronze slippers fascinated
him, and to them his eyes repeatedly turned.
<P>
A knock came at the door, which she answered.  Daylight could not
help hearing the conversation.  She was wanted at the telephone.
<P>
"Tell him to call up again in ten minutes," he heard her say, and
the masculine pronoun caused in him a flashing twinge of
jealousy.  Well, he decided, whoever it was, Burning Daylight
would give him a run for his money.  The marvel to him was that a
girl like Dede hadn't been married long since.
<P>
She came back, smiling to him, and resumed her sewing.  His eyes
wandered from the efficient hands to the bronze slippers and back
again, and he swore to himself that there were mighty few
stenographers like her in existence.  That was because she must
have come of pretty good stock, and had a pretty good raising. 
Nothing else could explain these rooms of hers and the clothes
she wore and the way she wore them.
<P>
"Those ten minutes are flying," he suggested.
<P>
"I can't marry you," she said.  
<P>
"You don't love me?" 
<P>
She shook her head.  
<P>
"Do you like me--the littlest bit?"
<P>
This time she nodded, at the same time allowing the smile of
amusement to play on her lips.  But it was amusement without
contempt.  The humorous side of a situation rarely appealed in
vain to her.
<P>
"Well, that's something to go on," he announced.  "You've got to
make a start to get started.  I just liked you at first, and look
what it's grown into.  You recollect, you said you didn't like my
way of life.  Well, I've changed it a heap.  I ain't gambling
like I used to.  I've gone into what you called the legitimate,
making two minutes grow where one grew before, three hundred
thousand folks where only a hundred thousand grew before.  And
this time next year there'll be two million eucalyptus growing on
the hills.  Say do you like me more than the littlest bit?"
<P>
She raised her eyes from her work and looked at him as she
answered:
<P>
"I like you a great deal, but--"
<P>
He waited a moment for her to complete the sentence, failing
which, he went on himself.
<P>
"I haven't an exaggerated opinion of myself, so I know I ain't
bragging when I say I'll make a pretty good husband.  You'd find
I was no hand at nagging and fault-finding. I can guess what it
must be for a woman like you to be independent.  Well, you'd be
independent as my wife.  No strings on you.  You could follow
your own sweet will, and nothing would be too good for you.  I'd
give you everything your heart desired--"
<P>
"Except yourself," she interrupted suddenly, almost sharply.
<P>
Daylight's astonishment was momentary.
<P>
"I don't know about that.  I'd be straight and square, and live
true.  I don't hanker after divided affections."
<P>
"I don't mean that," she said.  "Instead of giving yourself to
your wife, you would give yourself to the three hundred thousand
people of Oakland, to your street railways and ferry-routes, to
the two million trees on the hills to everything
business--and--and to all that that means."
<P>
"I'd see that I didn't," he declared stoutly.  "I'd be yours to
command."
<P>
"You think so, but it would turn out differently."  She suddenly
became nervous.  "We must stop this talk.  It is too much like
attempting to drive a bargain.  'How much will you give?'  'I'll
give so much.' 'I want more,' and all that.  I like you, but not
enough to marry you, and I'll never like you enough to marry
you."
<P>
"How do you know that?" he demanded.  
<P>
"Because I like you less and less."    
<P>
Daylight sat dumfounded.  The hurt showed itself plainly in his
face.
<P>
"Oh, you don't understand," she cried wildly, beginning to lose
self-control--"It's not that way I mean.  I do like you; the more
I've known you the more I've liked you.  And at the same time the
more I've known you the less would I care to marry you."
<P>
This enigmatic utterance completed Daylight's perplexity.
<P>
"Don't you see?" she hurried on.  "I could have far easier
married the Elam Harnish fresh from Klondike, when I first laid
eyes on him long ago, than marry you sitting before me now."
<P>
He shook his head slowly.  "That's one too many for me.  The more
you know and like a man the less you want to marry him. 
Familiarity breeds contempt--I guess that's what you mean."
<P>
"No, no," she cried, but before she could continue, a knock came
on the door.
<P>
"The ten minutes is up," Daylight said.
<P>
His eyes, quick with observation like an Indian's, darted about
the room while she was out.  The impression of warmth and comfort
and beauty predominated, though he was unable to analyze it;
while the simplicity delighted him--expensive simplicity, he
decided, and most of it leftovers from the time her father went
broke and died.  He had never before appreciated a plain hardwood
floor with a couple of wolfskins; it sure beat all the carpets in
creation.  He stared solemnly at a bookcase containing acCouple
of hundred books.  There was mystery.  He could not understand
what people found so much to write about.
<P>
Writing things and reading things were not the same as doing
things, and himself primarily a man of action, doing things was
alone comprehensible.
<P>
His gaze passed on from the Crouched Venus to a little tea-table
with all its fragile and exquisite accessories, and to a shining
copper kettle and copper chafing-dish.  Chafing dishes were not
unknown to him, and he wondered if she concocted suppers on this
one for some of those University young men he had heard whispers
about.  One or two water-colors on the wall made him conjecture
that she had painted them herself.  There were photographs of
horses and of old masters, and the trailing purple of a Burial of
Christ held him for a time.  But ever his gaze returned to that
Crouched Venus on the piano.  To his homely, frontier-trained
mind, it seemed curious that a nice young woman should have such
a bold, if not sinful, object on display in her own room.  But he
reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.  Since it was Dede,
it must be eminently all right.  Evidently such things went along
with culture.  Larry Hegan had similar casts and photographs in
his book-cluttered quarters.  But then, Larry Hegan was
different.  There was that hint of unhealth about him that
Daylight invariably sensed in his presence, while Dede, on the
contrary, seemed always so robustly wholesome, radiating an
atmosphere compounded of the sun and wind and dust of the open
road.  And yet, if such a clean, healthy woman as she went in for
naked women crouching on her piano, it must be all right.  Dede
made it all right.  She could come pretty close to making
anything all right.  Besides, he didn't understand culture
anyway.
<P>
She reentered the room, and as she crossed it to her chair, he
admired the way she walked, while the bronze slippers were
maddening.
<P>
"I'd like to ask you several questions," he began immediately
"Are you thinking of marrying somebody?" 
<P>
She laughed merrily and shook her head.
<P>
"Do you like anybody else more than you like me?--that man at the
'phone just now, for instance?"
<P>
"There isn't anybody else.  I don't know anybody I like well
enough to marry.  For that matter, I don't think I am a marrying
woman.  Office work seems to spoil one for that."
<P>
Daylight ran his eyes over her, from her face to the tip of a
bronze slipper, in a way that made the color mantle in her
cheeks.  At the same time he shook his head sceptically.
<P>
"It strikes me that you're the most marryingest woman that ever
made a man sit up and take notice.  And now another question. 
You see, I've just got to locate the lay of the land.  Is there
anybody you like as much as you like me?"
<P>
But Dede had herself well in hand.
<P>
"That's unfair," she said.  "And if you stop and consider, you
will find that you are doing the very thing you
disclaimed--namely,
nagging.  I refuse to answer any more of your
questions.  Let us talk about other things.  How is Bob?"
<P>
Half an hour later, whirling along through the rain on Telegraph
Avenue toward Oakland, Daylight smoked one of his brown-paper
cigarettes and reviewed what had taken place.  It was not at all
bad, was his summing up, though there was much about it that was
baffling.  There was that liking him the more she knew him and at
the same time wanting to marry him less.  That was a puzzler.
<P>
But the fact that she had refused him carried with it a certain
elation.  In refusing him she had refused his thirty million
dollars.  That was going some for a ninety dollar-a-month
stenographer who had known better ties.  She wasn't after money,
that was patent.  Every woman he had encountered had seemed
willing to swallow him down for the sake of his money.  Why, he
had doubled his fortune, made fifteen millions, since the day she
first came to work for him, and behold, any willingness to marry
him she might have possessed had diminished as his money had
increased.
<P>
"Gosh!" he muttered.  "If I clean up a hundred million on this
land deal she won't even be on speaking terms with me."
<P>
But he could not smile the thing away.  It remained to baffle
him, that enigmatic statement of hers that she could more easily
have married the Elam Harnish fresh from the Klondike than the
present Elam Harnish.  Well, he concluded, the thing to do was
for him to become more like that old-time Daylight who had come
down out of the North to try his luck at the bigger game.  But
that was impossible.  He could not set back the flight of time. 
Wishing wouldn't do it, and there was no other way.  He might as
well wish himself a boy again.
<P>
Another satisfaction he cuddled to himself from their interview. 
He had heard of stenographers before, who refused their
employers, and who invariably quit their positions immediately
afterward.  But Dede had not even hinted at such a thing.  No
matter how baffling she was, there was no nonsensical silliness
about her.  She was level headed.  But, also, he had been
level-headed and was partly responsible for this.  He hadn't
taken advantage of her in the office.  True, he had twice
overstepped the bounds, but he had not followed it up and made a
practice of it.  She knew she could trust him.  But in spite of
all this he was confident that most young women would have been
silly enough to resign a position with a man they had turned
down.  And besides, after he had put it to her in the right
light, she had not been silly over his sending her brother to
Germany.
<P>
"Gee!" he concluded, as the car drew up before his hotel.  "If
I'd only known it as I do now, I'd have popped the question the
first day she came to work.  According to her say-so, that would
have been the proper moment.  She likes me more and more, and the
more she likes me the less she'd care to marry me!  Now what do
youbthink of that?  She sure must be fooling."
