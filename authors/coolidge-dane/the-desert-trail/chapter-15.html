<p>When the solid earth quakes, though it move but a thousandth of an inch
beneath our feet, the human brain reels and we become dizzy, sick, and
afraid. So, too, at the thought that some trusted friend has played us
false, the mind turns back upon itself and we doubt the stability of
everything--for a moment. Then, as we find all the trees straight up,
the world intact, and the hills in their proper places, we cast the
treacherous doubts aside and listen to the voice of reason.
</p><p>For one awful moment Hooker saw himself betrayed by his friend, either
through weakness or through guile; and then his mind straightened
itself and he remembered that Phil was in jail.
</p><p>What more natural, then, than that the <u>rurales</u> should search his
pockets and give the ore to Aragon? He stooped and picked up the chunk
of rock--that precious, pocket-worn specimen that had brought them the
first sure promise of success--and wiped it on his sleeve.
</p><p>Mechanically he placed it beside the other piece which Aragon had
gouged from the ledge, and while he gazed at them he wondered what to
do--to leave their mine and go to his friend, or to let his friend wait
and stand guard by their treasure--and his heart told him to go to his
friend.
</p><p>So he swung up on his horse and followed slowly, and as soon as it was
dark he rode secretly through Old Fortuna and on till he came to the
jail. It was a square stone structure, built across the street from the
<u>cantina</u> in order to be convenient for the drunks, and as Bud rode up
close and stared at it, some one hailed him through the bars.
</p><p>"Hello there, pardner," called Hooker, swinging down and striding over
to the black window, "how long have they had you in here?"
</p><p>"Two days," answered Phil from the inner darkness; "but it seems like
a lifetime to me. Say, Bud, there's a Mexican in here that's got the
jim-jams--regular <u>tequila</u> jag--can't you get me out?"
</p><p>"Well, I sure will!" answered Bud. "What have they got you in for?
Where's our friend, Don Juan? Why didn't he let me know?"
</p><p>"You can search me!" railed De Lancey. "Seems like everybody quits you
down here the minute you get into trouble. I got arrested night before
last by those damned <u>rurales</u>--Manuel Del Rey was behind it, you can
bet your life on that--and I've been here ever since!"
</p><p>"Well, what are you pinched for? Who do I go and see?"
</p><p>"Pinched for nothing!" cried De Lancey bitterly. "Pinched because I'm a
Mexican citizen and can't protect myself! I'm <u>incomunicado</u> for three
days!"
</p><p>"Well, I'll get you out, all right," said Hooker, leaning closer
against the bars. "Here, have a smoke--did they frisk you of your
makings?"
</p><p>"No," snapped De Lancey crossly, "but I'm out of everything by this
time. Bud, I tell you I've had a time of it! They threw me in here with
this crazy, murdering Mexican and I haven't had a wink of sleep for two
days. He's quiet now, but I don't want any more."
</p><p>"Well, say," began Bud again, "what are you charged with? Maybe I can
grease somebody's paw and get you out tonight!"
</p><p>There was an awkward pause at this, and finally De Lancey dropped his
white face against the bars and his voice became low and beseeching.
</p><p>"I'll tell you, Bud," he said, "I haven't been quite on the square with
you--I've been holding out a little. But you know how it is--when a
fellow's in love. I've been going to see Gracia!"
</p><p>"Oh!" commented Hooker, and stood very quiet while he waited.
</p><p>"Yes, I've been going to see her," hurried on Phil. "I know I promised;
but honest, Bud, I couldn't help it. It just seemed as if my whole
being was wrapped up in her, and I had to do it. She'd be looking for
me when I came and went--and then I fixed it with her maid to take her
a letter. And then I met her secretly, back by the garden gate. You
know they've got some holes punched in the wall--loopholed during the
fight last summer--and we'd--"
</p><p>"Sure, I'll take your word for that," broke in Hooker harshly. "But get
to the point! What are you pinched for?"
</p><p>"Well," went on De Lancey, his voice quavering at the reproof, "I was
going to tell you, if you'll listen to me. Somebody saw us there and
told Aragon--he shut her up for a punishment and she slipped me out a
note. She was lonely, she said. And that night--well, I couldn't stand
it--I hired the string band and we went down there in a hack to give
her a serenade. But this cad, Manuel del Rey, who has been acting like
a jealous ass all along, swooped down on us with a detachment of his
<u>rurales</u> and took us all to jail. He let the musicians out the next
morning, but I've been here ever since."
</p><p>"Yes, and what are you charged with?" demanded Bud bruskly.
</p><p>"Drunk," confessed Phil, and Bud grunted.
</p><p>"Huh!" he said, "and me out watching that mine night and day!"
</p><p>"Oh, I know I've done you dirt, Bud," wailed De Lancey; "but I didn't
mean to, and I'll never do it again."
</p><p>"Never do what?" inquired Bud roughly.
</p><p>"I won't touch another drop of booze as long as I'm in Mexico!" cried
Phil. "Not a drop!"
</p><p>"And how about the girl?" continued Bud inexorably. "Her old man was
out and tried to jump our mine to-day--how about her?"
</p><p>"Well," faltered De Lancey, "I'll--she--"
</p><p>"You know your promise!" reminded Bud.
</p><p>"Yes; I know. But--oh, Bud, if you knew how loyal I've been to you--if
you knew what offers I've resisted--the mine stands in my name, you
know."
</p><p>"Well?"
</p><p>"Well, Aragon came around to me last week and said if I'd give him a
half interest in it he'd--well, never mind--it was a great temptation.
But did I fall for it? Not on your life! I know you, Bud, and I know
you're honest--you'd stay by me to the last ditch, and I'll do the same
by you. But I'm in love, Bud, and that would make a man forget his
promise if he wasn't true as steel."
</p><p>"Yes," commented Hooker dryly. "I don't reckon I can count on you much
from now on. Here, take a look at this and see what you make of it."
He drew the piece of ore that he had taken from Aragon from his pocket
and held it up in the moonlight. "Well, feel of it, then," he said.
"Shucks, you ought to know that piece of rock, Phil--it's the first one
we found in our mine!"
</p><p>"No!" exclaimed De Lancey, starting back. "Why--where'd you get it?"
</p><p>"Never mind where I got it!" answered Hooker. "The question is: What
did you do with it?"
</p><p>"Well, I might as well come through with it," confessed Phil, the last
of his assurance gone. "I gave it to Gracia!"
</p><p>"And I took it away from Aragon," continued Bud, "while he was digging
some more chunks out of our mine. So that is your idea of being true
as steel, is it? You've done noble by me and Kruger, haven't you? Yes,
you've been a good pardner, I don't think!"
</p><p>"Well, don't throw me down, Bud!" pleaded Phil. "There's some mistake
somewhere. Her father must have found it and taken it away! I'd stake
my life on it that Gracia would never betray me!"
</p><p>"Well, think it over for a while," suggested Bud, edging his words
with sarcasm. "I'm going up to the hotel!"
</p><p>"No; come back!" cried De Lancey, clamoring at the bars. "Come on back,
Bud! Here!" he said, thrusting his hand out through the heavy irons.
"I'll give you my word for it--I won't see her again until we get our
title! Will that satisfy you? Then give me your hand, pardner--I'm
sorry I did you wrong!"
</p><p>"It ain't me," replied Hooker soberly, as he took the trembling hand;
"it's Kruger. But if you'll keep your word, Phil, maybe we can win out
yet. I'm going up to find the <u>comisario</u>."
</p><p>A brief interview with that smiling individual and the case of Phil
De Lancey was laid bare. He had been engaged in a desperate rivalry
with Manuel del Rey for the hand of Gracia Aragon, and his present
incarceration was not only for singing rag-time beneath the Aragon
windows, but for trying to whip the captain of the <u>rurales</u> when the
latter tried to place him under arrest.
</p><p>And De Lancey was the prisoner not of the <u>comisario</u>, but of the
captain of the <u>rurales</u>. Sore at heart, Bud rode up through the
Mexican quarters to the <u>cuartel</u> of the <u>rurales</u>, but the captain was
inexorable.
</p><p>"No, <u>señor</u>," he said, waving an eloquent finger before his nose, "I
cannot release your friend. No, <u>señor</u>."
</p><p>"But what is he charged with," persisted Bud, "and when is his trial?
You can't keep him shut up without a trial."
</p><p>At this the captain of the <u>rurales</u> lifted his eyebrows and one
closely waxed <u>mustachio</u> and smiled mysteriously.
</p><p>"<u>Y como no?</u>" he inquired. "And why not? Is he not a Mexican citizen?"
</p><p>"Well, perhaps he is," thundered Bud, suddenly rising to his full
height, "but I am not! I am an American, Señor Capitan, and there are
other Americans! If you hold my friend without a trial I will come and
tear your jail down--and the <u>comisario</u> will not stop me, either!"
</p><p>"Ah!" observed the dandy little captain shrugging his <u>mustachio</u> once
more and blinking, and while Hooker raged back and forth he looked him
over appraisingly.
</p><p>"One moment!" he said at last, raising a quieting hand. "These are
perilous times, <u>señor</u>, in which all the defenders of Fortuna should
stand together. I do not wish to have a difference with the Americans
when Bernardo Bravo and his men are marching to take our town. No, I
value the friendship of the valiant Americans very highly--so I will
let your friend go. But first he must promise me one thing--not to
trouble the Señor Aragon by making further love to his daughter!"
</p><p>"Very well!" replied Bud. "He has already promised that to me; so come
on and let him out."
</p><p>"To you?" repeated Manuel del Rey with a faint smile. "Then, perhaps--"
</p><p>"Perhaps nothing!" broke in Hooker shortly. "Come on!"
</p><p>He led the way impatiently while the captain, his saber clanking,
strode out and rode beside him. He was not a big man, this swashing
captain of the rural police, but he was master, nevertheless, of a
great district, from Fortuna to the line, with a reputation for quick
work in the pursuance of his duty as well as in the primrose ways of
love.
</p><p>In the insurrections and raidings of the previous summer he had given
the <u>coup de grâce</u> with his revolver to more than one embryo bandit,
and in his love-affairs he had shown that he could be equally summary.
</p><p>The elegant Feliz Luna, who for a time had lingered near the charming
Gracia, had finally found himself up against a pair of pistols with the
option of either fighting Captain del Rey or returning to his parents.
The young man concluded to beat a retreat. For a like offense Philip De
Lancey had been unceremoniously thrown into jail; and now the <u>capitan</u>
turned his attention to Bud Hooker, whose mind he had not yet fathomed.
</p><p>"Excuse me, <u>señor</u>," he said, after a brief silence, "but your words
left me in doubt--whether to regard you as a friend or a rival."
</p><p>"What?" demanded Bud, whose knowledge of Spanish did not extend to the
elegancies.
</p><p>"You said," explained the captain politely, "that your friend had
promised you he would not trouble the lady further. Does that mean that
you are interested in her yourself, or merely that you perceive the
hopelessness of his suit and wish to protect him from a greater evil
that may well befall him? For look you, <u>señor</u>, the girl is mine, and
no man can come between us!"
</p><p>"Huh!" snorted Bud, who caught the last all right. Then he laughed
shortly and shrugged his shoulders. "I don't know what you're talking
about," he said gruffly, "but he will stay away, all right."
</p><p>"<u>Muy bien</u>," responded Del Rey carelessly and, dismounting at the
jail, he threw open the door and stood aside for his rival to come out.
</p><p>"<u>Muchas gracias, Señor Capitan</u>," saluted Bud, as the door clanged to
behind his pardner. But Phil still bristled with anger and defiance,
and the captain perceived that there would be no thanks from him.
</p><p>"It is nothing," he replied, bowing politely, and something in
the way he said it made De Lancey choke with rage. But there by
the <u>cárcel</u> door was not the place for picking quarrels. They
went to the hotel, where Don Juan, all apologies for his apparent
neglect--which he excused on the ground that De Lancey had been held
<u>incomunicado</u>--placated them as best he could and hurried on to the
news.
</p><p>"My gracious, Don Felipe," he cried, "you don't know how sorry I was to
see you in jail, but the captain's orders were that no one should go
near you--and in Mexico we obey the <u>rurales</u>, you know. Otherwise we
are placed against a wall and shot.
</p><p>"But have you heard the news from down below? Ah, what terrible times
they are having there--ranches raided, women stolen, rich men held for
ransom! Yes, it is worse than ever! Already I am receiving telegrams to
prepare rooms for the refugees, and the people are coming in crowds.
</p><p>"Our friend, the Señor Luna, and his son Feliz have been taken by
Bernardo Bravo! Only by an enormous ransom was he able to save his wife
and daughters, and his friends must now pay for him.
</p><p>"At the ranch of the rich Spaniard, Alvarez, there has been a great
battle in which the red-flaggers were defeated with losses. Now
Bernardo Bravo swears he will avenge his men, and Alvarez has armed his
Yaqui workmen.
</p><p>"He is a brave man, this Colonel Alvarez, and his Yaquis are
all warriors from the hills; but Bernardo has gathered all the
<u>insurrectos</u> in the country together--Campos, Rojas, the brothers
Escaboza--and they may crush him with their numbers. But now there is
other news--that they are marching upon Fortuna and El Tigre, to seize
the mines and mills and hold the rich American companies up for ransom.
</p><p>"No, <u>señores</u>, you must not return to your camp. Remain here, and
you shall still have your room, though Spanish gentlemen sleep on the
floors. No, allow me, Don Felipe! I wish to show you how highly I value
your friendship! Only because we cannot disobey the <u>rurales</u> did I
suffer you to lie in jail; but now you shall be my guest, you shall--"
</p><p>"Nope," answered Bud; "we're safer out at the mine."
</p><p>He glanced at De Lancey, in whose mind rosy visions were beginning to
gather, and he, too, declined--with a sigh.
</p><p>"Make it a bed for the night," he said. "I've got to get out of this
town before I tangle with Del Rey again and find myself back in jail.
And now lead me to it--I'm perishing for a bath and a sleep!"
</p><p>They retired early and got up early--for Bud was haunted by fears. But
as they passed through Old Fortuna the worst happened to him--they met
Gracia, mounted on a prancing horse and followed by a <u>rural</u> guard,
and she smote him to the heart with a smile.
</p><p>It was not a smile for Phil, gone astray and wounding by chance; it was
a dazzling, admiring smile for Bud alone, and he sat straighter in his
saddle. But Phil uttered a groan and struck his horse with the quirt.
</p><p>"She cut me!" he moaned.
</p><p>"Aw, forget it!" growled Bud, and they rode on their way in silence.
