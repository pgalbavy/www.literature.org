<p>The racing season at Saratoga drew toward its close, and Brandes
had appeared there only twice in person, both times with a very
young girl.</p>

<p>"If you got to bring her here to the races, can't you get her
some clothes?" whispered Stull in his ear. "That get-up of hers
is something fierce."</p>

<p>Late hours, hot weather, indiscreet nourishment, and the feverish
anxiety incident to betting other people's money had told on Stull.
His eyes were like two smears of charcoal on his pasty face; sourly
he went about the business which Brandes should have attended
to, nursing resentment&mdash;although he was doing better than Brandes
had hoped to do.</p>

<p>Their joint commission from his winnings began to assume considerable
proportions; at track and club and hotel people were beginning
to turn and stare when the little man with the face of a sick
circus clown appeared, always alone, greeting with pallid indifference
his acquaintances, ignoring overtures, noticing neither sport,
nor fashion, nor political importance, nor yet the fair and frail
whose curiosity and envy he was gradually arousing.</p>

<p>Obsequiousness from club, hotel, and racing officials made no
impression on him; he went about his business alone, sullen, preoccupied,
deathly pale, asking no information, requesting no favours, conferring
with nobody, doing no whispering and enduring none.</p>

<p>After a little study of that white, sardonic, impossible face,
people who would have been glad to make use of him became discouraged.
And those who first had recognised him in Saratoga found, at the
end of the racing month, nothing to add to their general identification
of him as "Ben Stull, partner of Eddie Brandes &mdash;Western
sports."</p>

<p>Stull, whispering in Brandes' ear again, where he sat beside
him in the grand stand, added to his earlier comment on Ruhannah's
appearance:</p>

<p>"Why don't you fix her up, Eddie? It looks like you been robbing
a country school."</p>

<p>Brandes' slow, greenish eyes marked sleepily the distant dust,
where Mr. Sanford's Nick Stoner was leading a brilliant field,
steadily overhauling the favourite, Deborah Glenn.</p>

<p>"When the time comes for me to fix her up," he said between thin
lips which scarcely moved, "she'll look like Washington Square
in May&mdash;not like Fifth Avenue and Broadway."</p>

<p>Nick Stoner continued to lead. Stull's eyes resembled two holes
burnt in a sheet; Brandes yawned. They were plunging the limit
on the Sanford favourite.</p>

<p>As for Ruhannah, she sat with slender gloved hands tightly clasped,
lips parted, intent, fascinated with the sunlit beauty of the
scene.</p>

<p>Brandes looked at her, and his heavy, expressionless features
altered subtly:</p>

<p>"Some running!" he said.</p>

<p>A breathless nod was her response. All around them repressed
excitement was breaking out; men stood up and shouted; women rose,
and the club house seemed suddenly to blossom like a magic garden
of wind-tossed flowers.</p>

<p>Through the increasing cheering Stull looked on without a sign
of emotion, although affluence or ruin, in the Sanford colours,
sat astride the golden roan.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ruhannah stood up, one hand pressed to the ill-fitting
blue serge over her wildly beating heart. Brandes rose beside
her. Not a muscle in his features moved.</p>

<p>"Gawd!" whispered Stull in his ear, as they were leaving.</p>

<p>"Some killing, Ben!" nodded Brandes in his low, deliberate voice.
His heavy, round face was deeply flushed; Fortune, the noisy wanton,
had flung both arms around his neck. But his slow eyes were continually
turned on the slim young girl whom he was teaching to walk beside
him without taking his arm.</p>

<p>"Ain't she on to us?" Stull had enquired. And Brandes' reply
was correct; Ruhannah never dreamed that it made a penny's difference
to Brandes whether Nick Stoner won or whether it was Deborah Glenn
which the wild-voiced throng saluted.</p>

<p>They did not remain in Saratoga for dinner. They took Stull back
to his hotel on the rumble of the runabout, Brandes remarking
that he thought he should need a chauffeur before long and suggesting
that Stull look about Saratoga for a likely one.</p>

<p>Halted in the crush before the United States Hotel, Stull decided
to descend there. Several men in the passing crowds bowed to Brandes;
one, Norton Smawley, known to the fraternity as "Parson" Smawley,
came out to the curb to shake hands. Brandes introduced him to
Rue as "Parson" Smawley&mdash;whether with some sinister future purpose
already beginning to take shape in his round, heavy head, or whether
a perverted sense of humour prompted him to give Rue the idea
that she had been in godly company, it is difficult to determine.</p>

<p>He added that Miss Carew was the daughter of a clergyman and
a missionary. And the Parson took his cue. At any rate Rue, leaning
from her seat, listened to the persuasive and finely modulated
voice of Parson Smawley with pleasure, and found his sleek, graceful
presence and courtly manners most agreeable. There were no such
persons in Gayfield.</p>

<p>She hoped, shyly, that if he were in Gayfield he would call on
her father. Once in a very long while clergymen called on her
father, and their rare visits remained a pleasure to the lonely
invalid for months.</p>

<p>The Parson promised to call, very gravely. It would not have
embarrassed him to do so; it was his business in life to have
a sufficient knowledge of every man's business to enable him to
converse convincingly with anybody.</p>

<p>He took polished leave of her; took leave of Brandes with the
faintest flutter of one eyelid, as though he understood Brandes'
game. Which he did not; nor did Brandes himself, entirely.</p>

<p>They had thirty miles to go in the runabout. So they would not
remain to dinner. Besides, Brandes did not care to make himself
conspicuous in public just then. Too many people knew more or
less about him&mdash;the sort of people who might possibly be in communication
with his wife. There was no use slapping chance in the face. Two
quiet visits to the races with Ruhannah was enough for the present.
Even those two visits were scarcely discreet. It was time to go.</p>

<p>Stull and Brandes stood consulting together beside the runabout;
Rue sat in the machine watching the press of carriages and automobiles
on Broadway, and the thronged sidewalks along which brilliant,
animated crowds were pouring.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming again, Ben," said Brandes, dropping his voice.
"No use to hunt the limelight just now. You can't tell what some
of these people might do. I'll take no chances that some fresh
guy might try to start something."</p>

<p>"Stir up Minna?" Stull's lips merely formed the question, and
his eyes watched Ruhannah.</p>

<p>"They couldn't. What would she care? All the same, I play safe,
Ben. Well, be good. Better send me mine on pay day. I'll need
it."</p>

<p>Stull's face grew sourer:</p>

<p>"Can't you wait till she gets her decree?"</p>

<p>"And lose a month off? No."</p>

<p>"It's all coming your way, Eddie. Stay wise and play safe. Don't
start anything now&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's safe. If I don't take September off I wait a year for my&mdash;honeymoon.
And I won't. See?"</p>

<p>They both looked cautiously at Ruhannah, who sat motionless,
absorbed in the turmoil of vehicles and people.</p>

<p>Brandes' face slowly reddened; he dropped one hand on Stull's
shoulder and said, between thin lips that scarcely moved:</p>

<p>"She's all I'm interested in. You don't think much of her, Ben.
She isn't painted. She isn't dolled up the way you like 'em. But
there isn't anything else that matters very much to me. All I
want in the world is sitting in that runabout, looking out of
her kid eyes at a thousand or two people who ain't worth the pair
of run-down shoes she's wearing."</p>

<p>But Stull's expression remained sardonic and unconvinced.</p>

<p>So Brandes got into his car and took the wheel; and Stull watched
them threading a tortuous path through the traffic tangle of Broadway.</p>

<p>They sped past the great hotels, along crowded sidewalks, along
the park, and out into an endless stretch of highway where hundreds
of other cars were travelling in the same direction.</p>

<p>"Did you have a good time?" he inquired, shifting his cigar and
keeping his narrow eyes on the road.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was beautiful&mdash;exciting."</p>

<p>"Some horse, Nick Stoner! Some race, eh?"</p>

<p>"I was so excited&mdash;with everybody standing up and shouting. And
such beautiful horses&mdash;and such pretty women in their wonderful
dresses! I &mdash;I never knew there were such things."</p>

<p>He swung the car, sent it rushing past a lumbering limousine,
slowed a little, gripped his cigar between his teeth, and watched
the road, both hands on the wheel.</p>

<p>Yes, things were coming his way&mdash;coming faster and faster all
the while. He had waited many years for this&mdash;for material fortune&mdash;for
that chance which every gambler waits to seize when the psychological
second ticks out. But he never had expected that the chance was
to include a very young girl in a country-made dress and hat.</p>

<p>As they sped westward the freshening wind from distant pine woods
whipped their cheeks; north, blue hills and bluer mountains beyond
took fairy shape against the sky; and over all spread the tremendous
heavens where fleets of white clouds sailed the uncharted wastes,
and other fleets glimmered beyond the edges of the world, hull
down, on vast horizons.</p>

<p>"I want to make you happy," said Brandes in his low, even voice.
It was, perhaps, the most honest statement he had ever uttered.</p>

<p>Ruhannah remained silent, her eyes riveted on the far horizon.</p>

<p>It was a week later, one hot evening, that he telegraphed to
Stull in Saratoga:</p>

<p>"Find me a chauffeur who will be willing to go abroad. I'll give
you twenty-four hours to get him here."</p>

<p>The next morning he called up Stull on the telephone from the
drug store in Gayfield:</p>

<p>"Get my wire, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait. Here's a postscript. I also want Parson Smawley. I want
him to get a car and come over to the Gayfield House. Tell him
I count on him. And he's to wear black and a white tie."</p>

<p>"Yes. But about that chauffeur you want&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't argue. Have him here. Have the Parson, also. Tell him
to bring a white tie. Understand?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I understand you, Eddie! You don't want anything of
me, do you! Go out and get that combination? Just like that! What'll
I do? Step into the street and whistle?"</p>

<p>"It's up to you. Get busy."</p>

<p>"<em>As</em> usual," retorted Stull in an acrid voice. "All the
same. I'm telling you there ain't a chauffeur you'd have in Saratoga.
Who handed you that dope?"</p>

<p>"Try. I need the chauffeur part of the combine, anyway. If he
won't go abroad, I'll leave him in town. Get a wiggle on, Ben.
How's things?"</p>

<p>"All right. We had War-axe and Lady Johnson. Some killing, eh?
That stable is winning all along. We've got Adriutha and Queen
Esther today. The Ocean Belle skate is scratched. Doc and Cap
and me is thick with the Legislature outfit. We'll trim 'em tonight.
How are you feeling, Eddie?"</p>

<p>"Never better. I'll call you up in the morning. Ding-dong!"</p>

<p>"Wait! Are you really going abroad?" shouted Stull.</p>

<p>But Brandes had already hung up.</p>

<p>He walked leisurely back to Brookhollow through the sunshine.
He had never been as happy in all his life.</p>
