<p>The aeroplane was caught in a furious snow squall. While descending
it ran into the swirling tumult which in an instant enveloped
it like a blanket, the myriads of particles filling the air so
thickly that the terrified Bohunkus could not see the ailerons
and even the aviator was partly shrouded from sight. Harvey Hamilton
was faintly visible as he leaned over and manipulated the levers.
Not only was the snow everywhere, but the machine itself was rocking
like a ship laboring in a storm. It tipped so fearfully that the
negro believed it was about to capsize and tumble them out. He
shrieked in his terror, and held fast for life.</p>

<p>Harvey paid no heed to him. He had enough to engage his skill
and wits. He recalled that Professor Sperbeck had told him what
to do when caught in one of those elemental outbursts. Instead
of running away from it, he headed for its center, so far as he
could locate it, as the navigator does when gripped by the typhoon
of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>Within five minutes of the aerial explosion, as it may be called,
the biplane was sailing in the same calm as before. The sun was
shining low in the sky and all was as serene as the mildest summer
day that ever soothed earth and heavens. The gust had come and
gone so quickly that it seemed like some frightful nightmare.
The youths might have doubted the evidence of their senses, but
for the reminder of the snowflakes on the wings, different parts
of the machine and their clothing. They had entered so balmy a
temperature, however, that the particles soon dissolved and left
only a slight moisture behind them.</p>

<p>"Wal, if dat don’t beat all creation," mused Bohunkus; "de fust
ting I knowed I didn’t know anyting and de next dat I knowed wasn’t
anyting. Wonder if Harv seed dat yell I let out when dat rumpus
hit me on de side ob my head."</p>

<p>The aviator acted as if unaware of the dusky youth’s presence.
Knowing the gasoline was nearly gone, he centered his thoughts
upon making a landing. To his astonishment he saw an immense forest
below him, many miles in extent. This seemed remarkable in view
of the fact that only a short time before he had sailed over a
large city, which could not be far to the south. He would have
turned about and made for it, knowing he could renew his supply
of fuel there, and find accommodations for himself and companion.
But the fluid was lower than he had supposed. It would not carry
him thither and he must volplane, or glide to earth, the best
he could.</p>

<p>It need not be said that a stretch of woods is the worst place
in the world for an aeroplane to descend to the earth. In fact
it is impossible to land without wrecking the apparatus and endangering
the lives of those it is carrying.</p>

<p>The keen eyes of the youth were scanning the ground below when
to his surprise he caught sight of a village of considerable size
to the westward. Why he had not observed it before passed his
comprehension. It was barely two miles distant and he was wondering
whether he had enough gasoline left to carry him over the woods
to the broken country beyond when he made a second and pleasing
discovery. A short distance ahead an open space in the forest
showed,—one of those natural breaks that are occasionally seen
in wide stretches of wilderness. It was several acres in extent
and seemed at that altitude to be free of stumps and covered with
a sparse growth of dry grass, so level that it formed an ideal
landing place. He did not hesitate to make use of it.</p>

<p>Now when an aeroplane comes down to earth, the greatest care
is necessary to avoid descending too suddenly. A violent bump
is likely to injure the small wheels beneath or the machine itself.
The aviator therefore oscillates downward somewhat after the manner
of a pendulum. When near the ground, he shifts his steering gear
so that the machine glides sideways for a little way. Then he
circles about or takes a zig-zag course, until it is safe to shut
off power and alight. As our old friend Darius Green said, the
danger is not so much in rising and sailing through the sky as
it is in ’lighting.</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton displayed fine skill, seesawing back and forth
until at the right moment the three small wheels touched the ground,
the machine under the slight momentum ran forward for two or three
rods, and then came to a standstill. A perfect landing had been
effected.</p>

<p>"Gee, but dat’s what I call splendacious!" exclaimed Bohunkus;
"it’s jest de way I’d done it myself."</p>

<p>The aviator leaped lightly from his seat, and his companion did
so more deliberately. He yawned and stretched his arms over his
head. Harvey gave him no attention until he had examined the different
parts of the machine and found them in order. Then he looked gravely
at the African and asked:</p>

<p>"Didn’t I hear you make some remark at the moment we dived into
that snow squall?"</p>

<p>"P’raps yo’ did, for de weather was so funny dat it war nat’ral
dat I should indulge in some obserwation inasmuch as to de same."</p>

<p>"But why use so loud tones?"</p>

<p>"Dat was necessumsary on ’count ob de prewailing disturbance
ob de atmospheric air wat was surrounding us."</p>

<p>"I’m glad to hear your explanation, but it sounded to me as if
you were scared."</p>

<p>"Me scared! Yo’ hurts my feelings, Harv; but I say, ain’t yo’
gwine to tie de machine fast?"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To keep it from running away."</p>

<p>"It won’t do that unless some one runs away with it; but, Bunk,
we can’t do any more flying till we get some gasoline and oil,
and it doesn’t look to me as if there is much chance of buying
any in these parts."</p>

<p>"Mebbe we can git it ober dere."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At dat house jest behind yo’."</p>

<p>Harvey turned about and met another surprise, for on the farther
edge of the natural clearing stood a dilapidated log dwelling,
with portions of several outbuildings visible around and beyond
it.</p>

<p>"I must be going blind!" was his exclamation; "I came near passing
this spot without seeing it and never noticed that house."</p>

<p>But the young man was hardly just to himself. In his concentration
of attention upon a landing place, he had given heed to nothing
else, and the descent engaged his utmost care until it was finished.
It was different with his companion, who had more freedom of vision.
Moreover, the primitive structure which the aviator now saw for
the first time was so enclosed by trees that it was hardly noticeable
from above.</p>

<p>No fence was visible, but a small, tumble-down porch was in front
of the broad door, which was open and showed a short, dumpy woman,
slovenly dressed and filling all of the space except that which
was above her head, because of her short stature. Her husband,
scrawny, stoop-shouldered, without coat, waistcoat or necktie,
wearing a straw hat whose rim pointed straight upward at the back
and almost straight downward in front, with a yellow tuft of whiskers
on his receding chin, and a set of big projecting teeth, was slouching
toward the two young men, as if impelled by a curiosity natural
in the circumstances. The thumb of each hand was thrust behind
a suspender button in front, and it was evident that he felt some
distrust until Harvey Hamilton’s genial "Good afternoon!" greeted
him. His trousers were tucked in the tops of his thick boots,
which now moved a little faster, but came to a stop several paces
off, as if the owner was still timid.</p>

<p>"How’r you?" he asked with a nod, in response to Harvey’s salutation;
"what sort of thing might you be calling that? Is it an aeroplane?"</p>

<p>"That’s its name; you have heard of them."</p>

<p>"I’ve read about them in the newspapers and studied pictures
of the blamed things, but yours is the first one I ever laid eyes
on."</p>

<p>Despite the uncouth manner of the man, it was evident that he
possessed considerable intelligence. He stepped closer and made
inquiries about the machine, its different parts and their functions,
and finally remarked:</p>

<p>"It’s coming, sure."</p>

<p>"What do you refer to?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"The day when those things will be as common as automobiles and
bicycles. If I don’t peg out in the next ten years, I expect to
own one myself."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope so, for you will get great pleasure from it."</p>

<p>"Not to mention a broken neck or arm or leg," he remarked with
a chuckle. "Now I suppose you call this contrivance a biplane
because it has double wings?"</p>

<p>"That is the reason."</p>

<p>"And it seems to me," he added, turning his head to one side
and squinting, "the length is a little greater from the nose of
the forward rudder to the end of the tail than between the wing
tips?"</p>

<p>"You are correct again; there is a difference of about two feet."</p>

<p>"The wings are curved a bit; I have read that that shape is better
than the flat form to support you in air."</p>

<p>"Experiments have proved it so."</p>

<p>"And this stuff," he continued, touching his forefinger to the
taut covering of one of the wings, "is rubberized linen?"</p>

<p>"It is with our machine, though some aviators prefer other material."</p>

<p>"Spruce seems to be the chief wood in your biplane."</p>

<p>"Because of its lightness and strength."</p>

<p>"The horizontal rudder in front must be used in ascending and
descending and the two vertical ones at the rear for steering
your course. I should judge," he said, scrutinizing the motor,
"that your engine has about sixty-horse power."</p>

<p>"You hit it exactly; I am astonished by your knowledge."</p>

<p>"It all comes from remembering what I read. And the wing tips
are the ailerons, and the engine weighs about three hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"A trifle less, the whole weight of the aeroplane being eight
hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"Your propeller is made of black walnut, and has eight laminations,
and when under full headway revolves more than a thousand times
a minute."</p>

<p>"See here," said Harvey; "don’t say you haven’t examined aeroplanes
before."</p>

<p>"As I told you, I never saw one until now, but what’s the use
of reading anything unless you keep it in your memory? That’s
my principle." </p>
