<p><em>SIXTEEN</em></p>

<p>We reached London somewhat late in the evening&mdash;in the twilight
of a summer day. There was the hurry and bustle of arrival, a
hurry and bustle that changed the tenor of my thoughts and broke
their train. As I stood reflecting before the door of the carriage,
I felt a friendly pressure of a hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"You'll see to that," Churchill's voice said in my ear. "You'll
set the copyists to work."</p>

<p>"I'll go to the Museum to-morrow," I said. There were certain
extracts to be made for the "Life of Cromwell"&mdash;extracts from
pamphlets that we had not conveniently at disposal. He nodded,
walked swiftly toward his brougham, opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>I remember so well that last sight of him&mdash;of his long, slim
figure bending down for the entrance, woefully solitary, woefully
weighted; remember so well the gleam of the carriage panels reflecting
the murky light of the bare London terminus, the attitude of the
coachman stiffly reining back the horse; the thin hand that reached
out, a gleam of white, to turn the gleaming handle. There was
something intimately suggestive of the man in the motion of that
hand, in its tentative outstretching, its gentle, half-persuasive&mdash;almost
theoretic&mdash;grasp of the handle. The pleasure of its friendly pressure
on my shoulder carried me over some minutes of solitude; its weight
on my body removing another from my mind. I had feared that my
ineffective disclosure had chilled what of regard he had for me.
He had said nothing, his manner had said nothing, but I had feared.
In the railway carriage he had sat remote from me, buried in papers.
But that touch on my shoulder was enough to set me well with myself
again, if not to afford scope for pleasant improvisation. It at
least showed me that he bore me no ill-will, otherwise he would
hardly have touched me. Perhaps, even, he was grateful to me,
not for service, but for ineffectual good-will. Whatever I read
into it, that was the last time he spoke to me, and the last time
he touched me. And I loved him very well. Things went so quickly
after that.</p>

<p>In a moderately cheerful frame of mind I strolled the few yards
that separated me from my club&mdash;intent on dining. In my averseness
to solitude I sat down at a table where sat already a little,
bald-headed, false-toothed Anglo-Indian, a man who bored me into
fits of nervous excitement. He was by way of being an incredibly
distant uncle of my own. As a rule I avoided him, to-night I dined
with him. He was a person of interminable and incredibly inaccurate
reminiscences. His long residence in an indigo-producing swamp
had affected his memory, which was supported by only very occasional
visits to England.</p>

<p>He told me tales of my poor father and of my poor, dear mother,
and of Mr. Bromptons and Mrs. Kenwards who had figured on their
visiting lists away back in the musty sixties.</p>

<p>"Your poor, dear father was precious badly off then," he said;
"he had a hard struggle for it. I had a bad time of it too; worm
had got at all my plantations, so I couldn't help him, poor chap.
I think, mind you, Kenny Granger treated him very badly. He might
have done something for him&mdash;he had influence, Kenny had."</p>

<p>Kenny was my uncle, the head of the family, the husband of my
aunt.</p>

<p>"They weren't on terms," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know, I know," the old man mumbled, "but still, for one's
only brother ... However, you contrive to do yourselves pretty
well. You're making your pile, aren't you? Someone said to me
the other day&mdash;can't remember who it was&mdash;that you were quite
one of the rising men&mdash;quite one of <em>the</em> men."</p>

<p>"Very kind of someone," I said.</p>

<p>"And now I see," he went on, lifting up a copy of a morning paper,
over which I had found him munching his salmon cutlet, "now I
see your sister is going to marry a cabinet minister. Ah!" he
shook his poor, muddled, baked head, "I remember you both as tiny
little dots."</p>

<p>"Why," I said, "she can hardly have been born then."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he affirmed, "that was when I came over in '78. She
remembered, too, that I brought her over an ivory doll&mdash;she remembered."</p>

<p>"You have seen her?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, I called two or three weeks&mdash;no, months&mdash;ago. She's the
image of your poor, dear mother," he added, "at that age; I remarked
upon it to your aunt, but, of course, she could not remember.
They were not married until after the quarrel."</p>

<p>A sudden restlessness made me bolt the rest of my tepid dinner.
With my return to the upper world, and the return to me of a will,
despair of a sort had come back. I had before me the problem&mdash;the
necessity&mdash;of winning her. Once I was out of contact with her
she grew smaller, less of an idea, more of a person&mdash;that one
could win. And there were two ways. I must either woo her as one
woos a person barred; must compel her to take flight, to abandon,
to cast away everything; or I must go to her as an eligible suitor
with the Etchingham acres and possibilities of a future on that
basis. This fantastic old man with his mumbled reminiscences spoilt
me for the last. One remembers sooner or later that a county-man
may not marry his reputed sister without scandal. And I craved
her intensely.</p>

<p>She had upon me the effect of an incredible stimulant; away from
her I was like a drunkard cut off from his liquor; an opium-taker
from his drug. I hardly existed; I hardly thought.</p>

<p>I had an errand at my aunt's house; had a message to deliver,
sympathetic enquiries to make&mdash;and I wanted to see her, to gain
some sort of information from her; to spy out the land; to ask
her for terms. There was a change in the appearance of the house,
an adventitious brightness that indicated the rise in the fortunes
of the family. For me the house was empty and the great door closed
hollowly behind me. My sister was not at home. It seemed abominable
to me that she should be out; that she could be talking to anyone,
or could exist without me. I went sullenly across the road to
the palings of the square. As I turned the corner I found my head
pivoting on my neck. I was looking over my shoulder at the face
of the house, was wondering which was her window.</p>

<p>"Like a love-sick boy&mdash;like a damn love-sick boy," I growled
at myself. My sense of humour was returning to me. There began
a pilgrimage in search of companionship.</p>

<p>London was a desert more solitary than was believable. On those
brilliant summer evenings the streets were crowded, were alive,
bustled with the chitter-chatter of footsteps, with the chitter-chatter
of voices, of laughter.</p>

<p>It was impossible to walk, impossible to do more than tread on
one's own toes; one was almost blinded by the constant passing
of faces. It was like being in a wheat-field with one's eyes on
a level with the indistinguishable ears. One was alone in one's
intense contempt for all these faces, all these contented faces;
one towered intellectually above them; one towered into regions
of rarefaction. And down below they enjoyed themselves. One understood
life better; they better how to live. That struck me then&mdash;in
Oxford Street. There was the intense good-humour, the absolute
disregard of the minor inconveniences, of the inconveniences of
a crowd, of the ignominy of being one of a crowd. There was the
intense poetry of the soft light, the poetry of the summer-night
coolness, and they understood how to enjoy it. I turned up an
ancient court near Bedford Row.</p>

<p>"In the name of God," I said, "I will enjoy ..." and I did. The
poetry of those old deserted quarters came suddenly home to me&mdash;all
the little commonplace thoughts; all the commonplace associations
of Georgian London. For the time I was done with the meanings
of things.</p>

<p>I was seeking Lea&mdash;he was not at home. The quarter was honeycombed
with the homes of people one knows; of people one used to know,
excellent young men who wrote for the papers, who sub-edited papers,
who designed posters, who were always just the same. One forgot
them for a year or two, one came across them again and found them
just the same&mdash;still writing for the same papers, still sub-editing
the same papers, designing the same posters. I was in the mood
to rediscover them in the privacies of their hearths, with the
same excellent wives making fair copies of the same manuscripts,
with the same gaiety of the same indifferent whiskey, brown or
pale or suspicious-looking, in heavy, square, cut-glass stoppered
decanters, and with the same indifferent Virginian tobacco at
the same level in the same jars.</p>

<p>I was in the mood for this stability, for the excellent household
article that was their view of life and literature. I wanted to
see it again, to hear again how it was filling the unvarying,
allotted columns of the daily, the weekly, or the monthly journals.
I wanted to breathe again this mild atmosphere where there are
no longer hopes or fears. But, alas!...</p>

<p>I rang bell after bell of that gloomy central London district.
You know what happens. One pulls the knob under the name of the
person one seeks&mdash;pulls it three, or, it may be, four times in
vain. One rings the housekeeper's bell; it reverberates, growing
fainter and fainter, gradually stifled by a cavernous subterranean
atmosphere. After an age a head peeps round the opening door,
the head of a hopeless anachronism, the head of a widow of early
Victorian merit, or of an orphan of incredible age. One asks for
So-and-so&mdash;he's out; for Williams&mdash;he's expecting an increase
of family, and has gone into the country with madame. And Waring?
Oh, he's gone no one knows where, and Johnson who used to live
at Number 44 only comes up to town on Tuesdays now. I exhausted
the possibilities of that part of Bloomsbury, the possibilities
of variety in the types of housekeepers. The rest of London divided
itself into bands&mdash;into zones. Between here and Kensington the
people that I knew could not be called on after dinner, those
who lived at Chiswick and beyond were hyperborean&mdash;one was bound
by the exigencies of time. It was ten o'clock as I stood reflecting
on a doorstep&mdash;on Johnson's doorstep. I must see somebody, must
talk to somebody, before I went to bed in the cheerless room at
the club. It was true I might find a political stalwart in the
smoking-room&mdash;but that was a last resort, a desperate and ignominious
<em>pis aller</em>.</p>

<p>There was Fox, I should find him at the office. But it needed
a change of tone before I could contemplate with equanimity the
meeting of that individual. I had been preparing myself to confront
all the ethically excellent young men and Fox was, ethically speaking,
far from excellent, middle-aged, rubicund, leery&mdash;a free lance
of genius. I made the necessary change in my tone of mind and
ran him to earth.</p>

<p>The Watteau room was further enlivened by the introduction of
a scarlet plush couch of sumptuous design. By its side stood a
couple of electric lights. The virulent green of their shades
made the colours of the be-shepherded wall-panels appear almost
unearthly, and threw impossible shadows on the deal partition.
Round the couch stood chairs with piles of papers neatly arranged
on them; round it, on the floor, were more papers lying like the
leaves of autumn that one sings of. On it lay Fox, enveloped in
a Shetland shawl&mdash;a good shawl that was the only honest piece
of workmanship in the torn-tawdry place. Fox was as rubicund as
ever, but his features were noticeably peaked and there were heavy
lines under his eyes&mdash;lines cast into deep shadow by the light
by which he was reading. I entered unannounced, and was greeted
by an indifferent upward glance that changed into one of something
like pleasure as he made out my features in the dim light.</p>

<p>"Hullo, you old country hawbuck," he said, with spasmodic jocularity;
"I'm uncommon glad to see you." He came to a jerky close, with
an indrawing of his breath. "I'm about done," he went on. "Same
old thing&mdash;sciatica. Took me just after I got here this afternoon;
sent out one of the messengers to buy me a sofa, and here I've
been ever since. Well, and what's brought you up&mdash;don't answer,
I know all about it. I've got to keep on talking until this particular
spasm's over, or else I shall scream and disturb the flow of Soane's
leader. Well, and now you've come, you'll stop and help me to
put the <em>Hour</em> to bed, won't you? And then you can come
and put me to bed."</p>

<p>He went on talking at high pressure, exaggerating his expressions,
heightening his humorous touches with punctuations of rather wild
laughter. At last he came to a stop with a half suppressed "Ah!"
and a long indrawing of the breath.</p>

<p>"That's over," he said. "Give me a drop of brandy&mdash;there's a
good fellow." I gave him his nip. Then I explained to him that
I couldn't work for the <em>Hour</em>; that I wasn't on terms
with de Mersch.</p>

<p>"Been dropping money over him?" he asked, cheerfully. I explained
a little more&mdash;that there was a lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's <em>that</em>," Fox said. "The man <em>is</em> a fool
... But anyhow Mersch don't count for much in this particular
show. He's no money in it even, so you may put your pride in your
pocket, or wherever you keep it. It's all right. Straight. He's
only the small change."</p>

<p>"But," I said, "everyone says; you said yourself...."</p>

<p>"To be sure," he answered. "But you don't think that <em>I</em>
play second fiddle to a bounder of that calibre. Not really?"</p>

<p>He looked at me with a certain seriousness. I remembered, as
I had remembered once before, that Fox was a personality&mdash;a power.
I had never realised till then how entirely&mdash;fundamentally&mdash;different
he was from any other man that I knew. He was surprising enough
to have belonged to another race. He looked at me, not as if he
cared whether I gave him his due or no, but as if he were astonished
at my want of perception of the fact. He let his towzled head
fall back upon the plush cushions. "You might kick him from here
to Greenland for me," he said; "I wouldn't weep. It suits me to
hold him up, and a kicking might restore his equilibrium. I'm
sick of him &mdash;I've told him so. I knew there <em>was</em>
a woman. But don't you worry; <em>I'm</em> the man here."</p>

<p>"If that's the case ..." I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it," he answered.</p>

<p>I helped him to put the paper to bed; took some of the work off
his hands. It was all part of the getting back to life; of the
resuming of rusty armour; and I wanted to pass the night. I was
not unused to it, as it happened. Fox had had several of these
fits during my year, and during most of them I had helped him
through the night; once or twice for three on end. Once I had
had entire control for a matter of five nights. But they gave
me a new idea of Fox, those two or three weird hours that night.
It was as if I had never seen him before. The attacks grew more
virulent as the night advanced. He groaned and raved, and said
things&mdash;oh, the most astounding things in gibberish that upset
one's nerves and everything else. At the height he sang hymns,
and then, as the fits passed, relapsed into incredible clear-headedness.
It gave me, I say, a new idea of Fox. It was as if, for all the
time I had known him, he had been playing a part, and that only
now, in the delirium of his pain, in the madness into which he
drank himself, were fragments of the real man thrown to the surface.
I grew, at last, almost afraid to be alone with him in the dead
small hours of the morning, and longed for the time when I could
go to bed among the uninspiring, marble-topped furniture of my
club.</p>
