<P>
Anne found that she could go on living; the day came
when she even smiled again over one of Miss Cornelia's
speeches.  But there was something in the smile that
had never been in Anne's smile before and would never
be absent from it again.
<P>
On the first day she was able to go for a drive Gilbert
took her down to Four Winds Point, and left her there
while he rowed over the channel to see a patient at the
fishing village.  A rollicking wind was scudding across
the harbor and the dunes, whipping the water into
white-caps and washing the sandshore with long lines of
silvery breakers.
<P>
"I'm real proud to see you here again, Mistress
Blythe," said Captain Jim.  "Sit down--sit down.  I'm
afeared it's mighty dusty here today--but there's no
need of looking at dust when you can look at such
scenery, is there?"
<P>
"I don't mind the dust," said Anne, "but Gilbert says
I must keep in the open air.  I think I'll go and sit
on the rocks down there."
<P>
"Would you like company or would you rather be alone?"
<P>
"If by company you mean yours I'd much rather have it
than be alone," said Anne, smiling.  Then she sighed. 
She had never before minded being alone.  Now she
dreaded it.  When she was alone now she felt so
dreadfully alone.
<P>
"Here's a nice little spot where the wind can't get at
you," said Captain Jim, when they reached the rocks. 
"I often sit here.  It's a great place jest to sit and
dream."
<P>
"Oh--dreams," sighed Anne.  "I can't dream now,
Captain Jim--I'm done with dreams."
<P>
"Oh, no, you're not, Mistress Blythe--oh, no, you're
not," said Captain Jim meditatively.  "I know how you
feel jest now--but if you keep on living you'll get
glad again, and the first thing you know you'll be
dreaming again--thank the good Lord for it!  If it
wasn't for our dreams they might as well bury us. 
How'd we stand living if it wasn't for our dream of
immortality?  And that's a dream that's BOUND to come
true, Mistress Blythe.  You'll see your little Joyce
again some day."
<P>
"But she won't be my baby," said Anne, with trembling
lips.  "Oh, she may be, as Longfellow says, `a fair
maiden clothed with celestial grace'--but she'll be a
stranger to me."
<P>
"God will manage better'n THAT, I believe," said
Captain Jim.
<P>
They were both silent for a little time.  Then Captain
Jim said very softly:
<P>
"Mistress Blythe, may I tell you about lost Margaret?"
<P>
"Of course," said Anne gently.  She did not know who
"lost Margaret" was, but she felt that she was going
to hear the romance of Captain Jim's life.
<P>
"I've often wanted to tell you about her," Captain Jim
went on.
<P>
"Do you know why, Mistress Blythe?  It's because I want
somebody to remember and think of her sometime after
I'm gone.  I can't bear that her name should be
forgotten by all living souls.  And now nobody
remembers lost Margaret but me."
<P>
Then Captain Jim told the story--an old, old forgotten
story, for it was over fifty years since Margaret had
fallen asleep one day in her father's dory and
drifted--or so it was supposed, for nothing was ever
certainly known as to her fate--out of the channel,
beyond the bar, to perish in the black thundersquall
which had come up so suddenly that long-ago summer
afternoon.  But to Captain Jim those fifty years were
but as yesterday when it is past.
<P>
"I walked the shore for months after that," he said
sadly, "looking to find her dear, sweet little body;
but the sea never give her back to me.  But I'll find
her sometime, Mistress Blythe--I'll find her sometime . 
She's waiting for me.  I wish I could tell you jest how
she looked, but I can't.  I've seen a fine, silvery
mist hanging over the bar at sunrise that seemed like
her--and then again I've seen a white birch in the
woods back yander that made me think of her.  She had
pale, brown hair and a little white, sweet face, and
long slender fingers like yours, Mistress Blythe, only
browner, for she was a shore girl.  Sometimes I wake up
in the night and hear the sea calling to me in the old
way, and it seems as if lost Margaret called in it. 
And when there's a storm and the waves are sobbing and
moaning I hear her lamenting among them.  And when they
laugh on a gay day it's HER laugh--lost Margaret's
sweet, roguish, little laugh.  The sea took her from
me, but some day I'll find her.  Mistress Blythe.  It
can't keep us apart forever."
<P>
"I am glad you have told me about her," said Anne.  "I
have often wondered why you had lived all your life
alone."
<P>
"I couldn't ever care for anyone else.  Lost Margaret
took my heart with her--out there," said the old
lover, who had been faithful for fifty years to his
drowned sweetheart.  "You won't mind if I talk a good
deal about her, will you, Mistress Blythe?  It's a
pleasure to me--for all the pain went out of her memory
years ago and jest left its blessing.  I know you'll
never forget her, Mistress Blythe.  And if the years,
as I hope, bring other little folks to your home, I
want you to promise me that you'll tell THEM the story
of lost Margaret, so that her name won't be forgotten
among humankind."
