<p>The possibility that his father could be involved in any of the
spectacular schemes which had evidently caught Dysart, seemed
so remote that Duane's incredulity permitted him to sleep that
night, though the name Yo Espero haunted his dreams.</p>

<p>But in the morning, something he read in the paper concerning
a vast enterprise, involving the control of the new radium mines
in Southern California, startled him into trying to recollect
what he had heard of Yo Espero and the Cascade Development and
Securities Company. Tainting its title the sinister name of Moebus
seemed to reoccur persistently in his confused imagination. Dysart's
name, too, figured in it. And, somehow, he conceived an idea that
his father once received some mining engineer's reports covering
the matter; he even seemed to remember that Guy Wilton had been
called into consultation.</p>

<p>Whatever associations he had for the name of the Cascade Development
and Securities Company must have originated in Paris the year
before his father returned to America. It seemed to him that Wilton
had been in Spain that year examining the recent and marvellously
rich radium find; and that his father and Wilton exchanged telegrams
very frequently concerning a mine in Southern California known
as Yo Espero.</p>

<p>His father breakfasted in his room that morning, but when he
appeared in the library Duane was relieved to notice that his
step was firmer and he held himself more erect, although his extreme
pallor had not changed to a healthier colour.</p>

<p>"You know," said Duane, "you've simply got to get out of town
for a while. It's all bally rot, your doing this sort of thing."</p>

<p>"I may go West for a few weeks," said his father absently.</p>

<p>"Are you going down-town?"</p>

<p>"No.... And, Duane, if you don't mind letting me have the house
to myself this morning&#11834;"</p>

<p>He hesitated, glancing from his son to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Of course not," said Duane heartily. "I'm off to the studio&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean to throw you out," murmured his father with a painful
attempt to smile, "but there's a stenographer coming from my office
and several&mdash;business acquaintances."</p>

<p>The young fellow rose, patted his father's shoulder lightly:</p>

<p>"What is really of any importance," he said, "is that you keep
your health and spirits. What I said last night covers my sentiments.
If I can do anything in the world for you, tell me."</p>

<p>His father took the outstretched hand, lifted his faded eyes
with a strange dumb look; and so they parted.</p>

<p>On Fifth Avenue and Fifty-ninth Street, Duane, swinging along
at a good pace, turned westward, and half-way to Sixth Avenue
encountered Guy Wilton going east, a packet under one arm, stick
and hat in the other hand, the summer wind blowing the thick curly
hair from his temples.</p>

<p>"Ah," observed Wilton, "early bird and worm, I suppose? Don't
try to bolt me, Duane; I'm full of tough and undigested&mdash;er&mdash;problems,
myself. Besides, I'm fermenting. Did you ever silently ferment
while listening politely to a man you wanted to assault?"</p>

<p>Duane laughed, then his eye by accident, caught a superscription
on the packet of papers under Wilton's arm: Yo Espero! His glance
reverted in a flash to Wilton's face.</p>

<p>The latter said: "I want to write a book entitled 'Gentleman
I Have Kicked.' Of course I've only kicked 'em mentally; but my!
what a list I have!&mdash;all sorts, all nations&mdash;from certain domestic
and predatory statesmen to the cad who made his beautiful and
sensitive mistress notorious in a decadent novel!&mdash;all kinds,
Duane, have I kicked mentally I've just used my foot on another
social favorite&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Dysart!" said Duane, inspired, and, turning painfully red, begged
Wilton's pardon.</p>

<p>"You've sure got a disconcerting way with you," admitted Wilton,
very much out of countenance.</p>

<p>"It was rotten bad taste in me&#11834;"</p>

<p>Wilton grinned with a wry face: "Nobody is standing much on ceremony
these days. Besides, I'm on to your trail, young man"&mdash;tapping
the bundle under his arm&mdash;"your eye happened to catch that superscription;
no doubt your father has talked to you; and you came to&mdash;a rather
embarrassing conclusion."</p>

<p>Duane's serious face fell:</p>

<p>"My father and I have not talked on that subject, Guy. Are you
going up to see him now?"</p>

<p>Wilton hesitated: "I suppose I am.... See here, Duane, how much
do you know about&mdash;anything?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said without humour; "I'm beginning to worry over
my father's health.... Guy, don't tell me anything that my father's
son ought not to know; but is there something I should know and
don't?&mdash;anything in which I could possibly be of help to my father?"</p>

<p>Wilton looked carefully at a distant policeman for nearly a minute,
then his meditative glance became focussed on vacancy.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't&mdash;know," he said slowly. "I'm going to see
your father now. If there is anything to tell, I think he ought
to tell it to you. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But he won't. Guy, I don't care a damn about anything except
his health and happiness. If anything threatens either, he won't
tell me, but don't you think I ought to know?"</p>

<p>"You ask too hard a question for me to answer."</p>

<p>"Then can you answer me this? Is father at all involved in any
of Jack Dysart's schemes?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>had better not answer, Duane."</p>

<p>"You know best. You understand that it is nothing except anxiety
for his personal condition that I thought warranted my butting
into his affairs and yours."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. Let me think over things for a day or two.
Now I've got to hustle. Good-bye."</p>

<p>He hastened on eastward; Duane went west, slowly, more slowly,
halted, head bent in troubled concentration; then he wheeled in
his tracks with nervous decision, walked back to the Plaza Club,
sent for a cab, and presently rattled off up-town.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the cab swung east and came to a standstill
a few doors from Fifth Avenue; and Duane sprang out and touched
the button at a bronze grille.</p>

<p>The servant who admitted him addressed him by name with smiling
deference and ushered him into a two-room reception suite beyond
the tiny elevator.</p>

<p>There was evidently somebody in the second room; Duane had also
noticed a motor waiting outside as he descended from his cab;
so he took a seat and sat twirling his walking-stick between his
knees, gloomily inspecting a room which, in pleasanter days, had
not been unfamiliar to him.</p>

<p>Instead of the servant returning, there came a click from the
elevator, a quick step, and the master of the house himself walked
swiftly into the room wearing hat and gloves.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he inquired briefly.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you a question or two," said Duane, shocked at
the change in Dysart's face. Haggard, thin, snow-white at the
temples with the light in his eyes almost extinct, the very precision
and freshness of linen and clothing brutally accentuated the ravaged
features.</p>

<p>"What questions?" demanded Dysart, still standing, and without
any emotion whatever in either voice or manner.</p>

<p>"The first is this: are you in communication with my father concerning
mining stock known as Yo Espero?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"Is my father involved in any business transactions in which
you figure, or have figured?"</p>

<p>"There are some. Yes."</p>

<p>"Is the Cascade Development and Securities Co. one of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>Duane's lips were dry with fear; he swallowed, controlled the
rising anger that began to twitch at his throat, and went on in
a low, quiet voice:</p>

<p>"Is this man &mdash;Moebus&mdash;connected with any of these transactions
in which you and&mdash;and my father are interested?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is Klawber?"</p>

<p>"Max Moebus, Emanuel Klawber, James Skelton, and Amos Flack are
interested. Is that what you want to know?"</p>

<p>Duane looked at him, stunned. Dysart stepped nearer, speaking
almost in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Well, what about it? Once I warned you to keep your damned nose
out of my personal affairs&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I make some of them mine!" said Duane sharply; "when crooks
get hold of an honest man, every citizen is a policeman!"</p>

<p>Dysart, face convulsed with fury, seized his arm in a vicelike
grip:</p>

<p>"Will you keep your cursed mouth shut!" he breathed. "My father
is in the next room. Do you want to kill him?"</p>

<p>At the same moment there came a stir from the room beyond, the
tap-tap of a cane and shuffling steps across the polished parquet.
Dysart's grip relaxed, his hand fell away, and he made a ghastly
grimace as a little old gentleman came half-trotting, half-shambling
to the doorway. He was small and dapper and pink-skinned under
his wig; the pink was paint; his lips and eyes peered and simpered;
from one bird-claw hand dangled a monocle.</p>

<p>Jack Dysart made a ghastly and supreme effort:</p>

<p>"I was just saying to Duane, father, that all this financial
agitation is bound to blow over by December &mdash;Duane Mallett,
father!"&mdash;as the old man raised his eye-glass and peeped up at
the young fellow&mdash;"you know his father, Colonel Mallett."</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure, yes, to be sure!" piped the old beau. "How-de-do!
How-de-do-o-o! My son Jack and I motor every morning at this hour.
It is becoming a custom&mdash;he! he!&mdash;every day from ten to eleven&mdash;then
a biscuit and a glass of sherry&mdash;then a nap&mdash;te-he! Oh, yes, every
day, Mr. Mallett, rain or fair&mdash;then luncheon at one, and the
cigarette&mdash;te-he!&mdash;and a little sleep&mdash;and the drive at five!
Yes, Mr. Mallett, it is the routine of a very old man who knew
your grandfather&mdash;and all his set&mdash;when the town was gay below
Bleecker Street! Yes, yes&mdash;te-he-he!"</p>

<p>Nervous spasms which passed as smiles distorted the younger Dysart's
visage; the aged beau offered his hand to Duane, who took it in
silence, his eyes fixed on the shrivelled, painted face:</p>

<p>"Your grandfather was a very fine man," he piped; "very fine!
ve-ery fine! And so I perceive is his grandson&mdash;te-he!&mdash;and I
flatter myself that my boy Jack is not unadmired&mdash;te-he-he!&mdash;no,
no&mdash;not precisely unnoticed in New York&mdash;the town whose history
is the history of his own race, Mr. Mallett&mdash;he is a good son
to me&mdash;yes, yes, a good son. It is gratifying to me to know that
you are his friend. He is a good friend to have, Mr. Mallett,
a good friend and a good son."</p>

<p>Duane bent gently over the shrivelled hand.</p>

<p>"I won't detain you from your drive, Mr. Dysart. I hope you will
have a pleasant one. It is a pleasure to know my grandfather's
old friends. Good-bye."</p>

<p>And, erect, he hesitated a moment, then, for an old man's sake
he held out his hand to Jack Dysart, bidding him good-bye in a
pleasant voice pitched clear and decided, so that deaf ears might
corroborate what half-blind and peering eyes so dimly beheld.</p>

<p>Dysart walked to the door with him, waved the servant aside,
and, laying a shaking hand on the bronze knob, opened the door
for his unbidden guest.</p>

<p>As Duane passed him he said:</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mallett," in a voice so low that Duane was half-way
to his cab before he understood.</p>

</div>
<p>That day, and the next, and all that week he worked in his pitlike
studio. Through the high sky-window a cloudless zenith brooded;
the heat became terrific; except for the inevitable crush of the
morning and evening migration south and north, the streets were
almost empty under a blazing sun.</p>

<p>His father seemed to be physically better. Although he offered
no confidences, it appeared to the son that there was something
a little more cheerful in his voice and manner. It may have been
only the anticipation of departure; for he was going West in a
day or two, and it came out that Wilton was going with him.</p>

<p>The day he left, Duane drove him to the station. There was a
private car, the "Cyane," attached to the long train. Wilton met
them, spoke pleasantly to Duane; but Colonel Mallett did not invite
his son to enter the car, and adieux were said where they stood.</p>

<p>As the young fellow turned and passed beneath the car-windows,
he caught a glimpse above him of a heavy-jowled, red face into
which a cigar was stuck&mdash;a perfectly enormous expanse of face
with two little piglike eyes almost buried in the mottled fat.</p>

<p>"That's Max Moebus," observed a train hand respectfully, as Duane
passed close to him; "I guess there's more billions into that
there private car than old Pip's crowd can dig out of their pants
pockets on pay day."</p>

<p>A little, dry-faced, chin-whiskered man with a loose pot-belly
and thin legs came waddling along, followed by two red-capped
negroes with his luggage. He climbed up the steps of the "Cyane";
the train man winked at Duane, who had turned to watch him.</p>

<p>"Amos Flack," he said. "He's their 'lobbygow.'" With which contemptuous
information he spat upon the air-brakes and, shoving both hands
into his pockets, meditatively jingled a bunch of keys.</p>

<p>The club was absolutely deserted that night; Duane dined there
alone, then wandered into the great empty room facing Fifth Avenue,
his steps echoing sharply across the carpetless floor. The big
windows were open; there was thunder in the air&mdash;the sonorous
stillness in which voices and footsteps in the street ring out
ominously.</p>

<p>He smoked and watched the dim forms of those whom the heat drove
forth into the night, men with coats over their arms and straw
hats in their hands, young girls thinly clad in white, bare-headed,
moving two and two with dragging steps and scarcely spirit left
even for common coquetry or any response to the jesting oafs who
passed.</p>

<p>Here and there a cruising street-dryad threaded the by-paths
of the metropolitan jungle; here and there a policeman, gray helmet
in hand, stood mopping his face, night-club tucked up snugly under
one arm. Few cabs were moving; at intervals a creaking, groaning
omnibus rolled past, its hurricane deck white with the fluttering
gowns of women and young girls.</p>

<p>Somebody came into the room behind him; Duane turned, but could
not distinguish who it was in the dusk. A little while later the
man came over to where he sat, and he looked up; and it was Dysart.</p>

<p>There was silence for a full minute; Dysart stood by the window
looking out; Duane paid him no further attention until he wheeled
slowly and said:</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I have a word with you, Mallett?"</p>

<p>"Not if it is necessary."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether it is necessary."</p>

<p>"Don't bother about it if you are in the slightest doubt."</p>

<p>Dysart waited a moment, perhaps for some unpleasant emotion to
subside; then:</p>

<p>"I'll sit down a moment, if you permit."</p>

<p>He dropped into one of the big, deep, leather chairs and touched
the bell. A servant came; he looked across at Duane, hesitated
to speak:</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Duane curtly. "I've cut it out."</p>

<p>"Scotch. Bring the decanter," murmured Dysart to the servant.</p>

<p>When it was served he drained the glass, refilled it, and turned
in the rest of the mineral water. Before he spoke he emptied the
glass again and rang for more mineral water. Then he looked at
Duane and said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I thought you were worried the other day when I saw you at my
house."</p>

<p>"What is that to you?"</p>

<p>Dysart said: "You were very kind&mdash;under provocation."</p>

<p>"I was not kind on your account."</p>

<p>"I understand. But I don't forget such things."</p>

<p>Duane glanced at him in profound contempt. Here was the stereotyped
scoundrel with the classical saving trait&mdash;the one conventionally
inevitable impulse for good shining like a diamond on a muck-heap&mdash;his
apparently disinterested affection for his father.</p>

<p>"You were very decent to me that day," Dysart said. "You had
something to say to me&mdash;but were good enough not to. I came over
to-night to give you a chance to curse me out. It's the square
thing to do."</p>

<p>"What do you know about square dealing?"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to add."</p>

<p>"Then I have if you'll let me." He paused; the other remained
silent. "I've this to say: you are worried sick; I saw that. What
worries you concerns your father. You were merciful to mine. I'll
do what I can for you."</p>

<p>He swallowed half of what remained in his iced glass, set it
back on the table with fastidious precision:</p>

<p>"The worst that can happen to your father is to lose control
of the Yo Espero property. I think he is going to lose it. They've
crowded me out. If I could have endured the strain I'd have stood
by your father&mdash;for what you did for mine.... But I couldn't,
Mallett."</p>

<p>He moistened his lips again; leaned forward:</p>

<p>"I think I know one thing about you, anyway; and I'm not afraid
you'd ever use any words of mine against me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't say them!" retorted Duane sharply.</p>

<p>But Dysart went on:</p>

<p>"You have no respect for me. You found out one thing about me
that settled me in your opinion. Outside of that, however, you
never liked me."</p>

<p>"That is perfectly true."</p>

<p>"I know it. And I want to say now that it was smouldering irritation
from that source&mdash;wounded vanity, perhaps&mdash;coupled with worry
and increasing cares, that led to that outburst of mine. I never
really believed that my wife needed any protection from the sort
of man you are. You are not that kind."</p>

<p>"That also is true."</p>

<p>"And I know it. And now I've cleared up these matters; and there's
another." He bit his lip, thought a moment, then with a deep,
long breath:</p>

<p>"When you struck me that night <em>I&mdash;</em>deserved it. I was
half crazy, I think&mdash;with what I had done&mdash;with a more material
but quite as ruinous situation developing here in town&mdash;with domestic
complications&mdash;never mind where all the fault lay&mdash;it was demoralising
me. Do you think that I am not perfectly aware that I stand very
much alone among men? Do you suppose that I am not aware of my
personal unpopularity as far as men are concerned? I have never
had an intimate friend&mdash;except Delancy Grandcourt. And I've treated
him like a beast. There's something wrong about me; there always
has been."</p>

<p>He slaked his thirst again; his hand shook so that he nearly
dropped the glass:</p>

<p>"Which is preliminary," he went on, "to saying to you that no
matter what I said in access of rage, I never doubted that your
encounter with &mdash;Miss Quest&mdash;was an accident. I never doubted
that your motive in coming to me was generous. God knows why I
said what I did say. You struck me; and you were justified....
And that clears up that!"</p>

<p>"Dysart," said the other, "you don't have to tell me these things."</p>

<p>"Would you rather not have heard them?"</p>

<p>Duane thought a moment.</p>

<p>"I would rather have heard them, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then may I go on?"</p>

<p>"Is there anything more to explain between us?"</p>

<p>"No.... But I would like to say something&mdash;in my own behalf.
Not that it matters to you&mdash;or to any man, perhaps, except my
father. I would like to say it, Mallett."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"Then; I prefer that you should believe I am not a crook. Not
that it matters to you; but I prefer that you do not believe it....
You have read enough in the papers to know what I mean. I'm telling
you now what I have never uttered to any man; and I haven't the
slightest fear you will repeat it or use it in any manner to my
undoing. It is this:</p>

<p>"The men with whom I was unwise enough to become partially identified
are marked for destruction by the Clearing House Committee and
by the Federal Government. I know it; others know it. Which means
the ruthless elimination of anything doubtful which in future
might possibly compromise the financial stability of this city.</p>

<p>"It is a brutal programme; the policy they are pursuing is bitterly
unjust. Innocent and guilty alike are going to suffer; I never
in all my life consciously did a crooked thing in business; and
yet I say to you now that these people are bent on my destruction;
that they mean to force us to close the doors of the Algonquin;
that they are planning the ruin of every corporation, every company,
every bank, every enterprise with which I am connected, merely
because they have decreed the financial death of Moebus and Klawber!"</p>

<p>He made a trembling gesture with clenched hand, and leaned farther
forward:</p>

<p>"Mallett! There is not one man to-day in Wall Street who has
not done, and who is not doing daily, the very things for which
the government officials and the Clearing House authorities are
attempting to get rid of me. Their attacks on my securities will
ultimately ruin me; but such attacks would ruin any financier,
any bank in the United States, if continued long enough.</p>

<p>"Doesn't anybody know that when the government conspires with
the Clearing House officials any security can be kicked out of
the market? Don't they know that when bank examiners class any
securities as undesirable, and bank officials throw them out from
the loans of such institutions, that they're not worth the match
struck to burn them into nothing?</p>

<p>"If they mean to close my companies and bring charges against
me, I'll tell you now, Mallett, any official of any bank which
to-day is in operation, can be indicted!"</p>

<p>He sat breathing fast, hands clasped nervously between his knees.
Duane, painfully impressed, waited. And after a moment Dysart
spoke again:</p>

<p>"They mean my ruin. There is a bank examiner at work&mdash;this very
moment while we're sitting here&mdash;on the Collect Pond Bank&mdash;which
is mine. The Federal inquisitors went through it once; now a new
one is back again. They found nothing with which to file an adverse
report the first time. Why did they come back?</p>

<p>"And I'll tell you another thing, Mallett, which may seem a slight
reason for my sullenness and quick temper; they've had secret-service
men following me ever since I returned from Roya-Neh. They are
into everything that I've ever been connected with; there is no
institution, no security in which I am interested, that they have
not investigated.</p>

<p>"And I tell you also, incredible as it may sound, that there
is no security in which I am interested which is not now being
attacked by government officials, and which, as a result of such
attacks, is not depreciating daily. I tell you they've even approached
the United States Court for its consent to a ruinous disposal
of certain corporation notes in which I am interested! Will you
tell me what you think of that, Mallett?"</p>

<p>Duane said: "I don't know, Dysart. I know almost nothing about
such matters. And &mdash;I am sorry that you are in trouble."</p>

<p>The silence remained unbroken for some time; then Dysart stood
up:</p>

<p>"I don't offer you my hand. You took it once for my father's
sake. That was manly of you, Mallett.... I thought perhaps I might
lighten your anxiety about your father. I hope I have.... And
I must ask your pardon for pressing my private affairs upon you"&mdash;he
laughed mirthlessly&mdash;"merely because I'd rather you didn't think
me a crook&mdash;for my father's sake.... Good-night."</p>

<p>"Dysart," he said, "why in God's name have you behaved as you
have to&mdash;that girl?"</p>

<p>Dysart stood perfectly motionless, then in a voice under fair
control:</p>

<p>"I understand you. You don't intend that as impertinence; you're
a square man, Mallett&mdash;a man who suffers under the evil in others.
And your question to me meant that you thought me not entirely
hopeless; that there was enough of decency in me to arouse your
interest. Isn't that what you meant?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'll answer you. There isn't much left of me; there'll
be less left of my fortune before long. I've made a failure of
everything, fortune, friendship, position, happiness. My wife
and I are separated; it is club gossip, I believe. She will probably
sue for divorce and get it. And I ask you, because I don't know,
can any amends be made to&mdash;the person you mentioned&mdash;by my offering
her the sort and condition of man I now am?"</p>

<p>"You've got to, haven't you?" asked Duane.</p>

<p>"Oh! Is that it? A sort of moral formality?"</p>

<p>"It's conventional; yes. It's expected."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"All the mess that goes to make up this compost heap we call
society.... I think she also would expect it."</p>

<p>Dysart nodded.</p>

<p>"If you could make her happy it would square a great many things,
Dysart."</p>

<p>The other looked up: "You?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know. Yes, in many ways; in that way at all
events&mdash;if you made her happy."</p>

<p>Dysart stepped forward: "Would you be nice to her if I did? No
other soul in the world knows except you. Other people would be
nice to her. Would <em>you</em>? And would you have the woman
you marry receive her?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is square of you, Mallett.... I meant to do it, anyway....
Thank you.... Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night," said Duane in a low voice.</p>

<p>He returned to the house late that night, and found a letter
from Geraldine awaiting him; the first in three days. Seated at
the library table he opened the letter and saw at once that the
red-pencilled cross at the top was missing.</p>

<p>Minutes passed; the first line blurred under his vacant gaze,
for his eyes travelled no farther. Then the letter fell to the
table; he dropped his head in his arms.</p>

<p>It was a curiously calm letter when he found courage to read
it:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I've lost a battle after many victories. It went against me after a<br/>
hard fight here alone at Roya-Neh. I think you had better come up.<br/>
The fight was on again the next night&mdash;that is, night before last,<br/>
but I've held fast so far and expect to. Only I wish you'd come.

</p>
<p>
"It is no reproach to you if I say that, had you been here, I might<br/>
have made a better fight. You couldn't be here; the shame of defeat<br/>
is all my own.

</p>
<p>
"Duane, it was not a disastrous defeat in one way. I held out for<br/>
four days, and thought I had won out. I was stupefied by loss of<br/>
sleep, I think; this is not in excuse, only the facts which I lay<br/>
bare for your consideration.

</p>
<p>
"The defeat was in a way a concession&mdash;a half-dazed<br/>
compromise&mdash;merely a parody on a real victory for the enemy; because<br/>
it roused in me a horror that left the enemy almost no consolation,<br/>
no comfort, even no physical relief. The enemy is I myself, you<br/>
understand&mdash;that other self we know about.

</p>

"She was perfectly furious, Duane; she wrestled with me, fought to<br/>
make me yield more than I had&mdash;which was almost nothing&mdash;begged me,<br/>
brutalised me, pleaded, tormented, cajoled. I was nearly dead when<br/>
the sun rose; but I had gone through it.

</p>
<p>
"I wish you could come. She is still watching me. It's an armed<br/>
truce, but I know she'll break it if the chance comes. There is no<br/>
honour in her, Duane, no faith, no reason, no mercy. I know her.

</p>
<p>
"Can you not come? I won't ask it if your father needs you. Only if<br/>
he does not, I think you had better come very soon.

</p>
<p>
"When may I restore the red cross to the top of my letters to you? I<br/>
suppose I had better place it on the next letter, because if I do<br/>
not you might think that another battle had gone against me.

</p>
<p>
"Don't reproach me. I couldn't stand it just now. Because I am a<br/>
very tired girl, Duane, and what has happened is heavy in my<br/>
heart&mdash;heavy on my head and shoulders like that monster Sindbad<br/>
bore.

</p>
<p>
"Can you come and free me? One word&mdash;your arms around me&mdash;and I am<br/>
safe.

</p>
<p>
"<em>G.S</em>."

</p>

<p>As he finished, a maid came bearing a telegram on a salver.</p>

<p>"Tell him to wait," said Duane, tearing open the white night-message:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Your father is ill at San Antonio and wishes you to come at once.<br/>
Notify your mother but do not alarm her. Your father's condition is<br/>
favorable, but the outcome is uncertain.

</p>
<p>
"<em>WELLS, </em><em>Secretary</em>."

</p>
</div>
<p>Duane took three telegram blanks from the note-paper rack and
wrote:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"My father is ill at San Antonio. They have just wired me, and I<br/>
shall take the first train. Stand by me now. Win out for my sake. I<br/>
put you on your honour until I can reach you."

</p>
</div>
<p>And to his father:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I leave on first train for San Antonio. It's going to be all right,<br/>
father."

</p>
</div>
<p>And to his mother:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Am leaving for San Antonio because I don't think father is well<br/>
enough to I'll write you and wire you. Love to you and Naïda."

</p>
</div>
<p>He gave the maid the money, turned, and unhooking the receiver
of the telephone, called up the Grand Central Station.</p>
