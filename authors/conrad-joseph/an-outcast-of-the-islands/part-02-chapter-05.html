<p>Directly on stepping outside Omar’s hut Abdulla caught sight
of Willems. He expected, of course, to see a white man, but not
that white man, whom he knew so well. Everybody who traded in
the islands, and who had any dealings with Hudig, knew Willems.
For the last two years of his stay in Macassar the confidential
clerk had been managing all the local trade of the house under
a very slight supervision only on the part of the master. So everybody
knew Willems, Abdulla amongst others&mdash;but he was ignorant of Willems’
disgrace. As a matter of fact the thing had been kept very quiet&mdash;so
quiet that a good many people in Macassar were expecting Willems’
return there, supposing him to be absent on some confidential
mission. Abdulla, in his surprise, hesitated on the threshold.
He had prepared himself to see some seaman&mdash;some old officer of
Lingard’s; a common man&mdash;perhaps difficult to deal with, but still
no match for him. Instead, he saw himself confronted by an individual
whose reputation for sagacity in business was well known to him.
How did he get here, and why? Abdulla, recovering from his surprise,
advanced in a dignified manner towards the fire, keeping his eyes
fixed steadily on Willems. When within two paces from Willems
he stopped and lifted his right hand in grave salutation. Willems
nodded slightly and spoke after a while.</p>

<p>"We know each other, Tuan Abdulla," he said, with an assumption
of easy indifference.</p>

<p>"We have traded together," answered Abdulla, solemnly, "but it
was far from here."</p>

<p>"And we may trade here also," said Willems.</p>

<p>"The place does not matter. It is the open mind and the true
heart that are required in business."</p>

<p>"Very true. My heart is as open as my mind. I will tell you why
I am here."</p>

<p>"What need is there? In leaving home one learns life. You travel.
Travelling is victory! You shall return with much wisdom."</p>

<p>"I shall never return," interrupted Willems. "I have done with
my people. I am a man without brothers. Injustice destroys fidelity."</p>

<p>Abdulla expressed his surprise by elevating his eyebrows. At
the same time he made a vague gesture with his arm that could
be taken as an equivalent of an approving and conciliating "just
so!"</p>

<p>Till then the Arab had not taken any notice of Aissa, who stood
by the fire, but now she spoke in the interval of silence following
Willems’ declaration. In a voice that was much deadened by her
wrappings she addressed Abdulla in a few words of greeting, calling
him a kinsman. Abdulla glanced at her swiftly for a second, and
then, with perfect good breeding, fixed his eyes on the ground.
She put out towards him her hand, covered with a corner of her
face-veil, and he took it, pressed it twice, and dropping it turned
towards Willems. She looked at the two men searchingly, then backed
away and seemed to melt suddenly into the night.</p>

<p>"I know what you came for, Tuan Abdulla," said Willems; "I have
been told by that man there." He nodded towards Babalatchi, then
went on slowly, "It will be a difficult thing."</p>

<p>"Allah makes everything easy," interjected Babalatchi, piously,
from a distance.</p>

<p>The two men turned quickly and stood looking at him thoughtfully,
as if in deep consideration of the truth of that proposition.
Under their sustained gaze Babalatchi experienced an unwonted
feeling of shyness, and dared not approach nearer. At last Willems
moved slightly, Abdulla followed readily, and they both walked
down the courtyard, their voices dying away in the darkness. Soon
they were heard returning, and the voices grew distinct as their
forms came out of the gloom. By the fire they wheeled again, and
Babalatchi caught a few words. Willems was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have been at sea with him many years when young. I have used
my knowledge to observe the way into the river when coming in,
this time."</p>

<p>Abdulla assented in general terms.</p>

<p>"In the variety of knowledge there is safety," he said; and then
they passed out of earshot.</p>

<p>Babalatchi ran to the tree and took up his position in the solid
blackness under its branches, leaning against the trunk. There
he was about midway between the fire and the other limit of the
two men’s walk. They passed him close. Abdulla slim, very straight,
his head high, and his hands hanging before him and twisting mechanically
the string of beads; Willems tall, broad, looking bigger and stronger
in contrast to the slight white figure by the side of which he
strolled carelessly, taking one step to the other’s two; his big
arms in constant motion as he gesticulated vehemently, bending
forward to look Abdulla in the face.</p>

<p>They passed and repassed close to Babalatchi some half a dozen
times, and, whenever they were between him and the fire, he could
see them plain enough. Sometimes they would stop short, Willems
speaking emphatically, Abdulla listening with rigid attention,
then, when the other had ceased, bending his head slightly as
if consenting to some demand, or admitting some statement. Now
and then Babalatchi caught a word here and there, a fragment of
a sentence, a loud exclamation. Impelled by curiosity he crept
to the very edge of the black shadow under the tree. They were
nearing him, and he heard Willems say&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will pay that money as soon as I come on board. That I must
have."</p>

<p>He could not catch Abdulla’s reply. When they went past again,
Willems was saying&mdash;</p>

<p>"My life is in your hand anyway. The boat that brings me on board
your ship shall take the money to Omar. You must have it ready
in a sealed bag."</p>

<p>Again they were out of hearing, but instead of coming back they
stopped by the fire facing each other. Willems moved his arm,
shook his hand on high talking all the time, then brought it down
jerkily&mdash;stamped his foot. A short period of immobility ensued.
Babalatchi, gazing intently, saw Abdulla’s lips move almost imperceptibly.
Suddenly Willems seized the Arab’s passive hand and shook it.
Babalatchi drew the long breath of relieved suspense. The conference
was over. All well, apparently.</p>

<p>He ventured now to approach the two men, who saw him and waited
in silence. Willems had retired within himself already, and wore
a look of grim indifference. Abdulla moved away a step or two.
Babalatchi looked at him inquisitively.</p>

<p>"I go now," said Abdulla, "and shall wait for you outside the
river, Tuan Willems, till the second sunset. You have only one
word, I know."</p>

<p>"Only one word," repeated Willems.</p>

<p>Abdulla and Babalatchi walked together down the enclosure, leaving
the white man alone by the fire. The two Arabs who had come with
Abdulla preceded them and passed at once through the little gate
into the light and the murmur of voices of the principal courtyard,
but Babalatchi and Abdulla stopped on this side of it. Abdulla
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well. We have spoken of many things. He consents."</p>

<p>"When?" asked Babalatchi, eagerly.</p>

<p>"On the second day from this. I have promised every thing. I
mean to keep much."</p>

<p>"Your hand is always open, O Most Generous amongst Believers!
You will not forget your servant who called you here. Have I not
spoken the truth? She has made roast meat of his heart."</p>

<p>With a horizontal sweep of his arm Abdulla seemed to push away
that last statement, and said slowly, with much meaning&mdash;</p>

<p>"He must be perfectly safe; do you understand? Perfectly safe&mdash;as
if he was amongst his own people&mdash;till . . ."</p>

<p>"Till when?" whispered Babalatchi.</p>

<p>"Till I speak," said Abdulla. "As to Omar." He hesitated for
a moment, then went on very low: "He is very old."</p>

<p>"Hai-ya! Old and sick," murmured Babalatchi, with sudden melancholy.</p>

<p>"He wanted me to kill that white man. He begged me to have him
killed at once," said Abdulla, contemptuously, moving again towards
the gate.</p>

<p>"He is impatient, like those who feel death near them," exclaimed
Babalatchi, apologetically.</p>

<p>"Omar shall dwell with me," went on Abdulla, "when . . . But
no matter. Remember! The white man must be safe."</p>

<p>"He lives in your shadow," answered Babalatchi, solemnly. "It
is enough!" He touched his forehead and fell back to let Abdulla
go first.</p>

<p>And now they are back in the courtyard wherefrom, at their appearance,
listlessness vanishes, and all the faces become alert and interested
once more. Lakamba approaches his guest, but looks at Babalatchi,
who reassures him by a confident nod. Lakamba clumsily attempts
a smile, and looking, with natural and ineradicable sulkiness,
from under his eyebrows at the man whom he wants to honour, asks
whether he would condescend to visit the place of sitting down
and take food. Or perhaps he would prefer to give himself up to
repose? The house is his, and what is in it, and those many men
that stand afar watching the interview are his. Syed Abdulla presses
his host’s hand to his breast, and informs him in a confidential
murmur that his habits are ascetic and his temperament inclines
to melancholy. No rest; no food; no use whatever for those many
men who are his. Syed Abdulla is impatient to be gone. Lakamba
is sorrowful but polite, in his hesitating, gloomy way. Tuan Abdulla
must have fresh boatmen, and many, to shorten the dark and fatiguing
road. Hai-ya! There! Boats!</p>

<p>By the riverside indistinct forms leap into a noisy and disorderly
activity. There are cries, orders, banter, abuse. Torches blaze
sending out much more smoke than light, and in their red glare
Babalatchi comes up to say that the boats are ready.</p>

<p>Through that lurid glare Syed Abdulla, in his long white gown,
seems to glide fantastically, like a dignified apparition attended
by two inferior shades, and stands for a moment at the landing-place
to take leave of his host and ally&mdash;whom he loves. Syed Abdulla
says so distinctly before embarking, and takes his seat in the
middle of the canoe under a small canopy of blue calico stretched
on four sticks. Before and behind Syed Abdulla, the men squatting
by the gunwales hold high the blades of their paddles in readiness
for a dip, all together. Ready? Not yet. Hold on all! Syed Abdulla
speaks again, while Lakamba and Babalatchi stand close on the
bank to hear his words. His words are encouraging. Before the
sun rises for the second time they shall meet, and Syed Abdulla’s
ship shall float on the waters of this river&mdash;at last! Lakamba
and Babalatchi have no doubt&mdash;if Allah wills. They are in the
hands of the Compassionate. No doubt. And so is Syed Abdulla,
the great trader who does not know what the word failure means;
and so is the white man&mdash;the smartest business man in the islands&mdash;who
is lying now by Omar’s fire with his head on Aissa’s lap, while
Syed Abdulla flies down the muddy river with current and paddles
between the sombre walls of the sleeping forest; on his way to
the clear and open sea where the Lord of the Isles (formerly of
Greenock, but condemned, sold, and registered now as of Penang)
waits for its owner, and swings erratically at anchor in the currents
of the capricious tide, under the crumbling red cliffs of Tanjong
Mirrah.</p>

<p>For some time Lakamba, Sahamin, and Bahassoen looked silently
into the humid darkness which had swallowed the big canoe that
carried Abdulla and his unvarying good fortune. Then the two guests
broke into a talk expressive of their joyful anticipations. The
venerable Sahamin, as became his advanced age, found his delight
in speculation as to the activities of a rather remote future.
He would buy praus, he would send expeditions up the river, he
would enlarge his trade, and, backed by Abdulla’s capital, he
would grow rich in a very few years. Very few. Meantime it would
be a good thing to interview Almayer to-morrow and, profiting
by the last day of the hated man’s prosperity, obtain some goods
from him on credit. Sahamin thought it could be done by skilful
wheedling. After all, that son of Satan was a fool, and the thing
was worth doing, because the coming revolution would wipe all
debts out. Sahamin did not mind imparting that idea to his companions,
with much senile chuckling, while they strolled together from
the riverside towards the residence. The bull-necked Lakamba,
listening with pouted lips without the sign of a smile, without
a gleam in his dull, bloodshot eyes, shuffled slowly across the
courtyard between his two guests. But suddenly Bahassoen broke
in upon the old man’s prattle with the generous enthusiasm of
his youth. . . . Trading was very good. But was the change that
would make them happy effected yet? The white man should be despoiled
with a strong hand! . . . He grew excited, spoke very loud, and
his further discourse, delivered with his hand on the hilt of
his sword, dealt incoherently with the honourable topics of throat-cutting,
fire-raising, and with the far-famed valour of his ancestors.</p>

<p>Babalatchi remained behind, alone with the greatness of his conceptions.
The sagacious statesman of Sambir sent a scornful glance after
his noble protector and his noble protector’s friends, and then
stood meditating about that future which to the others seemed
so assured. Not so to Babalatchi, who paid the penalty of his
wisdom by a vague sense of insecurity that kept sleep at arm’s
length from his tired body. When he thought at last of leaving
the waterside, it was only to strike a path for himself and to
creep along the fences, avoiding the middle of the courtyard where
small fires glimmered and winked as though the sinister darkness
there had reflected the stars of the serene heaven. He slunk past
the wicket-gate of Omar’s enclosure, and crept on patiently along
the light bamboo palisade till he was stopped by the angle where
it joined the heavy stockade of Lakamba’s private ground. Standing
there, he could look over the fence and see Omar’s hut and the
fire before its door. He could also see the shadow of two human
beings sitting between him and the red glow. A man and a woman.
The sight seemed to inspire the careworn sage with a frivolous
desire to sing. It could hardly be called a song; it was more
in the nature of a recitative without any rhythm, delivered rapidly
but distinctly in a croaking and unsteady voice; and if Babalatchi
considered it a song, then it was a song with a purpose and, perhaps
for that reason, artistically defective. It had all the imperfections
of unskilful improvisation and its subject was gruesome. It told
a tale of shipwreck and of thirst, and of one brother killing
another for the sake of a gourd of water. A repulsive story which
might have had a purpose but possessed no moral whatever. Yet
it must have pleased Babalatchi for he repeated it twice, the
second time even in louder tones than at first, causing a disturbance
amongst the white rice-birds and the wild fruit-pigeons which
roosted on the boughs of the big tree growing in Omar’s compound.
There was in the thick foliage above the singer’s head a confused
beating of wings, sleepy remarks in bird-language, a sharp stir
of leaves. The forms by the fire moved; the shadow of the woman
altered its shape, and Babalatchi’s song was cut short abruptly
by a fit of soft and persistent coughing. He did not try to resume
his efforts after that interruption, but went away stealthily
to seek&mdash;if not sleep&mdash;then, at least, repose.</p>
