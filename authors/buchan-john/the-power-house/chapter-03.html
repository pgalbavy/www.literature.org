<p>Hitherto I had been the looker-on; now I was to become a person
of the drama.  That telegram was the beginning of my active part
in this curious affair.  They say that everybody turns up in time
at the corner of Piccadilly Circus if you wait long enough.  I
was to find myself like a citizen of Bagdad in the days of the
great Caliph, and yet never stir from my routine of flat, chambers,
club, and flat.</p>

<p>I am wrong; there was one episode out of London, and that perhaps
was the true beginning of my story.</p>

<p>Whitsuntide that year came very late, and I was glad of the fortnight's
rest, for Parliament and the Law Courts had given me a busy time. 
I had recently acquired a car and a chauffeur called Stagg, and
I looked forward to trying it in a tour in the West country. 
But before I left London I went again to Portman Square.</p>

<p>I found Ethel Pitt-Heron in grave distress.  You must remember
that Tommy and I had always gone on the hypothesis that Charles's
departure had been in pursuance of some mad scheme of his own
which might get him into trouble.  We thought that he had become
mixed up with highly undesirable friends, and was probably embarking
in some venture which might not be criminal but was certain to
be foolish.  I had long rejected the idea of blackmail, and convinced
myself that Lumley and Pavia were his colleagues.  The same general
notion, I fancy, had been in his wife's mind.  But now she had
found something which altered the case.</p>

<p>She had ransacked his papers in the hope of finding a clue to
the affair which had taken him abroad, but there was nothing but
business letters, notes of investments, and such like.  He seemed
to have burned most of his papers in the queer laboratory at the
back of the house.  But, stuffed into the pocket of a blotter
on a bureau in the drawing-room where he scarcely ever wrote,
she had found a document. It seemed to be the rough draft of a
letter, and it was addressed to her.  I give it as it was written;
the blank spaces were left blank in the manuscript.</p>

<p>"<em>You must have thought me mad, or worse, to treat you as
I have done.  But there was a terrible reason, which some day
I hope to tell you all about.  I want you as soon as you get this
to make ready to come out to me at ... You will travel by ...
and arrive at ... I enclose a letter which I want you to hand
in deepest confidence to Knowles, the solicitor.  He will make
all arrangements about your journey and about sending me the supplies
of money I want.  Darling, you must leave as secretly as I did,
and tell nobody anything, not even that I am alive&mdash;that least
of all.  I would not frighten you for worlds, but I am on the
edge of a horrible danger, which I hope with God's help and yours
to escape...</em>"</p>

<p>That was all&mdash;obviously the draft of a letter which he intended
to post to her from some foreign place.  But can you conceive
a missive more calculated to shatter a woman's nerves?  It filled
me, I am bound to say, with heavy disquiet.  Pitt-Heron was no
coward, and he was not the man to make too much of a risk.  Yet
it was clear that he had fled that day in May under the pressure
of some mortal fear.</p>

<p>The affair in my eyes began to look very bad.  Ethel wanted me
to go to Scotland Yard, but I dissuaded her.  I have the utmost
esteem for Scotland Yard, but I shrank from publicity at this
stage.  There might be something in the case too delicate for
the police to handle, and I thought it better to wait.</p>

<p>I reflected a great deal about the Pitt-Heron business the first
day or two of my trip, but the air and the swift motion helped
me to forget it.  We had a fortnight of superb weather, and sailed
all day through a glistening green country under the hazy blue
heavens of June.  Soon I fell into the blissful state of physical
and mental ease which such a life induces.  Hard toil, such as
deer-stalking, keeps the nerves on the alert and the mind active,
but swimming all day in a smooth car through a heavenly landscape
mesmerises brain and body.</p>

<p>We ran up the Thames valley, explored the Cotswolds, and turned
south through Somerset till we reached the fringes of Exmoor. 
I stayed a day or two at a little inn high up in the moor, and
spent the time tramping the endless ridges of hill or scrambling
in the arbutus thickets where the moor falls in steeps to the
sea.  We returned by Dartmoor and the south coast, meeting with
our first rain in Dorset, and sweeping into sunlight again on
Salisbury Plain.  The time came when only two days remained to
me.  The car had behaved beyond all my hopes, and Stagg, a sombre
and silent man, was lyrical in his praises.</p>

<p>I wanted to be in London by the Monday afternoon, and to insure
this I made a long day of it on the Sunday.  It was the long day
which brought our pride to a fall.  The car had run so well that
I resolved to push on and sleep in a friend's house near Farnham. 
It was about half-past eight, and we were traversing the somewhat
confused and narrow roads in the neighbourhood of Wolmer Forest,
when, as we turned a sharp corner, we ran full into the tail of
a heavy carrier's cart.  Stagg clapped on the brakes, but the
collision, though it did no harm to the cart, was sufficient to
send the butt-end of something through our glass screen, damage
the tyre of the near front-wheel, and derange the steering-gear. 
Neither of us suffered much hurt, but Stagg got a long scratch
on his cheek from broken glass, and I had a bruised shoulder.</p>

<p>The carrier was friendly but useless, and there was nothing for
it but to arrange for horses to take the car to Farnham.  This
meant a job of some hours, and I found on inquiry at a neighbouring
cottage that there was no inn where I could stay within eight
miles.  Stagg borrowed a bicycle somehow and went off to collect
horses, while I morosely reviewed the alternatives before me.</p>

<p>I did not like the prospect of spending the June night beside
my derelict car, and the thought of my friend's house near Farnham
beckoned me seductively.  I might have walked there, but I did
not know the road, and I found that my shoulder was paining me,
so I resolved to try to find some gentleman's house in the neighbourhood
where I could borrow a conveyance.  The south of England is now
so densely peopled by Londoners that even in a wild district where
there are no inns and few farms there are certain to be several
week-end cottages.</p>

<p>I walked along the white ribbon of road in the scented June dusk. 
At first it was bounded by high gorse, then came patches of open
heath, and then woods.  Beyond the woods I found a park-railing,
and presently an entrance-gate with a lodge.  It seemed to be
the place I was looking for, and I woke the lodge-keeper, who
thus early had retired to bed.  I asked the name of the owner,
but was told the name of the place instead&mdash;it was High Ashes. 
I asked if the owner was at home, and got a sleepy nod for answer.</p>

<p>The house, as seen in the half-light, was a long white-washed
cottage, rising to two storeys in the centre.  It was plentifully
covered with creepers and roses, and the odour of flowers was
mingled with the faintest savour of wood-smoke, pleasant to a
hungry traveller in the late hours.  I pulled an old-fashioned
bell, and the door was opened by a stolid young parlour-maid.</p>

<p>I explained my errand, and offered my card.  I was, I said, a
Member of Parliament and of the Bar, who had suffered a motor
accident. Would it be possible for the master of the house to
assist me to get to my destination near Farnham?  I was bidden
enter, and wearily seated myself on a settle in the hall.</p>

<p>In a few minutes an ancient housekeeper appeared, a grim dame
whom at other times I should have shunned.  She bore, however,
a hospitable message.  There was no conveyance in the place, as
the car had gone that day to London for repairs.  But if I cared
to avail myself of the accommodation of the house for the night
it was at my service. Meantime my servant could be looking after
the car, and a message would go to him to pick me up in the morning.</p>

<p>I gratefully accepted, for my shoulder was growing troublesome,
and was conducted up a shallow oak staircase to a very pleasant
bedroom with a bathroom adjoining.  I had a bath, and afterwards
found a variety of comforts put at my service, from slippers to
razors. There was also some Elliman for my wounded shoulder. 
Clean and refreshed, I made my way downstairs and entered a room
from which I caught a glow of light.</p>

<p>It was a library, the most attractive I think I have ever seen. 
The room was long, as libraries should be, and entirely lined
with books, save over the fireplace, where hung a fine picture,
which I took to be a Raeburn.  The books were in glass cases,
which showed the beautiful shallow mouldings of a more artistic
age.  A table was laid for dinner in a corner, for the room was
immense, and the shaded candlesticks on it, along with the late
June dusk, gave such light as there was.  At first I thought the
place was empty, but as I crossed the floor a figure rose from
a deep chair by the hearth.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Leithen," a voice said.  "It is a kindly mischance
which gives a lonely old man the pleasure of your company."</p>

<p>He switched on an electric lamp, and I saw before me&mdash;what I
had not guessed from the voice&mdash;an old man.  I was thirty-four
at the time, and counted anything over fifty old, but I judged
my host to be well on in the sixties.  He was about my own size,
but a good deal bent in the shoulders as if from study.  His face
was clean-shaven and extraordinarily fine, with every feature
delicately chiselled.  He had a sort of Hapsburg mouth and chin,
very long and pointed, but modelled with a grace which made the
full lower lip seem entirely right.  His hair was silver, brushed
so low on the forehead as to give him a slightly foreign air,
and he wore tinted glasses, as if for reading.</p>

<p>Altogether it was a very dignified and agreeable figure who greeted
me in a voice so full and soft that it belied his obvious age.</p>

<p>Dinner was a light meal, but perfect in its way.  There were
soles, I remember, an exceedingly well-cooked chicken, fresh strawberries
and a savoury.  We drank a '95 Perrier-Jouet and some excellent
Madeira. The stolid parlour-maid waited on us, and, as we talked
of the weather and the Hampshire roads, I kept trying to guess
my host's profession.  He was not a lawyer, for he had not the
inevitable lines on the cheek.  I thought that he might be a retired
Oxford don, or one of the higher civil servants, or perhaps some
official of the British Museum.  His library proclaimed him a
scholar, and his voice a gentleman.</p>

<p>Afterwards we settled ourselves in armchairs and he gave me a
good cigar.  We talked about many things&mdash;books, the right furnishing
of a library, a little politics in deference to my <em>M.P.-</em>ship. 
My host was apathetic about party questions, but curious about
defence matters and in his way an amateur strategist.  I could
fancy him inditing letters to <em>The Times</em> on national service.</p>

<p>Then we wandered into foreign affairs, where I found his interest
acute, and his knowledge immense.  Indeed he was so well informed
that I began to suspect that my guesses had been wrong, and that
he was a retired diplomat.  At that time there was some difficulty
between France and Italy over customs duties, and he sketched
for me with remarkable clearness the weak points in the French
tariff administration.  I had been recently engaged in a big South
American railway case, and I asked him a question about the property
of my clients.  He gave me a much better account than I had ever
got from the solicitors who briefed me.</p>

<p>The fire had been lit before we finished dinner, and presently
it began to burn up and light the figure of my host, who sat in
a deep arm-chair.  He had taken off his tinted glasses, and as
I rose to get a match I saw his eyes looking abstractedly before
him.</p>

<p>Somehow they reminded me of Pitt-Heron.  Charles had always a
sort of dancing light in his, a restless intelligence which was
at once attractive and disquieting.  My host had this and more. 
His eyes were paler than I had ever seen in a human head&mdash;pale,
bright, and curiously wild.  But, whereas Pitt-Heron's had only
given the impression of reckless youth, this man's spoke of wisdom
and power as well as of endless vitality.</p>

<p>All my theories vanished, for I could not believe that my host
had ever followed any profession.  If he had, he would have been
at the head of it, and the world would have been familiar with
his features. I began to wonder if my recollection was not playing
me false, and I was in the presence of some great man whom I ought
to recognise.</p>

<p>As I dived into the recesses of my memory I heard his voice asking
if I were not a lawyer.</p>

<p>I told him, Yes.  A barrister with a fair common-law practice
and some work in Privy Council appeals.</p>

<p>He asked me why I chose the profession.</p>

<p>"It came handiest," I said.  "I am a dry creature, who loves
facts and logic.  I am not a flier, I have no new ideas, I don't
want to lead men and I like work.  I am the ordinary educated
Englishman, and my sort gravitates to the Bar.  We like feeling
that, if we are not the builders, at any rate we are the cement
of civilisation."</p>

<p>He repeated the words "cement of civilisation" in his soft voice.</p>

<p>"In a sense you are right.  But civilisation needs more than
the law to hold it together.  You see all mankind are not equally
willing to accept as divine justice what is called human law."</p>

<p>"Of course there are further sanctions," I said.  "Police and
armies and the good-will of civilisation."</p>

<p>He caught me up quickly.  "The last is your true cement.  Did
you ever reflect, Mr. Leithen, how precarious is the tenure of
the civilisation we boast about?"</p>

<p>"I should have thought it fairly substantial," I said, "and the
foundations grow daily firmer."</p>

<p>He laughed.  "That is the lawyer's view, but believe me you are
wrong.  Reflect, and you will find that the foundations are sand.
You think that a wall as solid as the earth separates civilisation
from barbarism.  I tell you the division is a thread, a sheet
of glass.  A touch here, a push there, and you bring back the
reign of Saturn."</p>

<p>It was the kind of paradoxical, undergraduate speculation which
grown men indulge in sometimes after dinner.  I looked at my host
to discover his mood, and at the moment a log flared up again.</p>

<p>His face was perfectly serious.  His light wild eyes were intently
watching me.</p>

<p>"Take one little instance," he said.  "We are a commercial world,
and have built up a great system of credit.  Without our cheques
and bills of exchange and currency the whole of our life would
stop.  But credit only exists because behind it we have a standard
of value.  My Bank of England notes are worthless paper unless
I can get sovereigns for them if I choose.  Forgive this elementary
disquisition, but the point is important.  We have fixed a gold
standard, because gold is sufficiently rare, and because it allows
itself to be coined into a portable form.  I am aware that there
are economists who say that the world could be run on a pure credit
basis, with no metal currency at the back of it; but, however
sound their argument may be in the abstract, the thing is practically
impossible.  You would have to convert the whole of the world's
stupidity to their economic faith before it would work.</p>

<p>"Now, suppose something happened to make our standard of value
useless.  Suppose the dream of the alchemists came true, and all
metals were readily transmutable.  We have got very near it in
recent years, as you will know if you interest yourself in chemical
science. Once gold and silver lost their intrinsic value, the
whole edifice of our commerce would collapse.  Credit would become
meaningless, because it would be untranslatable.  We should be
back at a bound in the age of barter, for it is hard to see what
other standard of value could take the place of the precious metals. 
All our civilisation, with its industries and commerce, would
come toppling down.  Once more, like primitive man, I would plant
cabbages for a living and exchange them for services in kind from
the cobbler and the butcher. We should have the simple life with
a vengeance&mdash;not the self-conscious simplicity of the civilised
man, but the compulsory simplicity of the savage."</p>

<p>I was not greatly impressed by the illustration.  "Of course,
there are many key-points in civilisation," I said, "and the loss
of them would bring ruin.  But these keys are strongly held."</p>

<p>"Not so strongly as you think.  Consider how delicate the machine
is growing.  As life grows more complex, the machinery grows more
intricate and therefore more vulnerable.  Your so-called sanctions
become so infinitely numerous that each in itself is frail.  In
the Dark Ages you had one great power&mdash;the terror of God and His
Church. Now you have a multiplicity of small things, all delicate
and fragile, and strong only by our tacit agreement not to question
them."</p>

<p>"You forget one thing," I said&mdash;"the fact that men really are
agreed to keep the machine going.  That is what I called the 'good-will
of civilisation.'"</p>

<p>He got up from his chair and walked up and down the floor, a
curious dusky figure lit by the rare spurts of flame from the
hearth.</p>

<p>"You have put your finger on the one thing that matters. Civilisation
is a conspiracy.  What value would your police be if every criminal
could find a sanctuary across the Channel, or your law courts
if no other tribunal recognised their decisions?  Modern life
is the silent compact of comfortable folk to keep up pretences. 
And it will succeed till the day comes when there is another compact
to strip them bare."</p>

<p>I do not think that I have ever listened to a stranger conversation.
It was not so much what he said&mdash;you will hear the same thing
from any group of half-baked young men&mdash;as the air with which
he said it. The room was almost dark, but the man's personality
seemed to take shape and bulk in the gloom.  Though I could scarcely
see him, I knew that those pale strange eyes were looking at me. 
I wanted more light, but did not know where to look for a switch. 
It was all so eery and odd that I began to wonder if my host were
not a little mad. In any case, I was tired of his speculations.</p>

<p>"We won't dispute on the indisputable," I said.  "But I should
have thought that it was the interest of all the best brains of
the world to keep up what you call the conspiracy."</p>

<p>He dropped into his chair again.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said slowly.  "Do we really get the best brains
working on the side of the compact?  Take the business of Government.
When all is said, we are ruled by the amateurs and the second-rate.
The methods of our departments would bring any private firm to
bankruptcy.  The methods of Parliament&mdash;pardon me&mdash;would disgrace
any board of directors.  Our rulers pretend to buy expert knowledge,
but they never pay the price for it that a business man would
pay, and if they get it they have not the courage to use it. 
Where is the inducement for a man of genius to sell his brains
to our insipid governors?</p>

<p>"And yet knowledge is the only power&mdash;now as ever.  A little
mechanical device will wreck your navies.  A new chemical combination
will upset every rule of war.  It is the same with our commerce. 
One or two minute changes might sink Britain to the level of Ecuador
or give China the key of the world's wealth.  And yet we never
dream that these things are possible.  We think our castles of
sand are the ramparts of the universe."</p>

<p>I have never had the gift of the gab, but I admire it in others.
There is a morbid charm in such talk, a kind of exhilaration of
which one is half ashamed.  I found myself interested and more
than a little impressed.</p>

<p>"But surely," I said, "the first thing a discoverer does is to
make his discovery public.  He wants the honour and glory, and
he wants money for it.  It becomes part of the world's knowledge,
and everything is readjusted to meet it.  That was what happened
with electricity.  You call our civilisation a machine, but it
is something far more flexible.  It has the power of adaptation
of a living organism."</p>

<p>"That might be true if the new knowledge really became the world's
property.  But does it?  I read now and then in the papers that
some eminent scientist has made a great discovery.  He reads a
paper before some Academy of Science, and there are leading articles
on it, and his photograph adorns the magazines.  That kind of
man is not the danger.  He is a bit of the machine, a party to
the compact.  It is the men who stand outside it that are to be
reckoned with, the artists in discovery who will never use their
knowledge till they can use it with full effect.  Believe me,
the biggest brains are without the ring which we call civilisation."</p>

<p>Then his voice seemed to hesitate.  "You may hear people say
that submarines have done away with the battleship, and that aircraft
have annulled the mastery of the sea.  That is what our pessimists
say. But do you imagine that the clumsy submarine or the fragile
aeroplane is really the last word of science?"</p>

<p>"No doubt they will develop," I said, "but by that time the power
of the defence will have advanced also."</p>

<p>He shook his head.  "It is not so.  Even now the knowledge which
makes possible great engines of destruction is far beyond the
capacity of any defence.  You see only the productions of second-rate
folk who are in a hurry to get wealth and fame.  The true knowledge,
the deadly knowledge, is still kept secret.  But, believe me,
my friend, it is there."</p>

<p>He paused for a second, and I saw the faint outline of the smoke
from his cigar against the background of the dark.  Then he quoted
me one or two cases, slowly, as if in some doubt about the wisdom
of his words.</p>

<p>It was these cases which startled me.  They were of different
kinds&mdash;a great calamity, a sudden breach between two nations,
a blight on a vital crop, a war, a pestilence.  I will not repeat
them. I do not think I believed in them then, and now I believe
less.  But they were horribly impressive, as told in that quiet
voice in that sombre room on that dark June night.  If he was
right, these things had not been the work of Nature or accident,
but of a devilish art. The nameless brains that he spoke of, working
silently in the background, now and then showed their power by
some cataclysmic revelation.  I did not believe him, but, as he
put the case, showing with strange clearness the steps in the
game, I had no words to protest.</p>

<p>At last I found my voice.</p>

<p>"What you describe is super-anarchy, and yet it makes no headway.
What is the motive of those diabolical brains?"</p>

<p>He laughed.  "How should I be able to tell you?  I am a humble
inquirer, and in my researches I come on curious bits of fact. 
But I cannot pry into motives.  I only know of the existence of
great extra-social intelligences.  Let us say that they distrust
the machine.  They may be idealists and desire to make a new world,
or they may simply be artists, loving for its own sake the pursuit
of truth.  If I were to hazard a guess, I should say that it took
both types to bring about results, for the second find the knowledge
and the first the will to use it."</p>

<p>A recollection came back to me.  It was of a hot upland meadow
in Tyrol, where among acres of flowers and beside a leaping stream
I was breakfasting after a morning spent in climbing the white
crags.  I had picked up a German on the way, a small man of the
Professor class, who did me the honour to share my sandwiches. 
He conversed fluently, but quaintly in English, and he was, I
remember, a Nietzschean, and a hot rebel against the established
order.  "The pity," he cried, "is that the reformers do not know,
and those who know are too idle to reform.  Some day there will
come the marriage of knowledge and will, and then the world will
march."</p>

<p>"You draw an awful picture," I said.  "But if those extra-social
brains are so potent, why after all do they effect so little? 
A dull police-officer, with the machine behind him, can afford
to laugh at most experiments in anarchy."</p>

<p>"True," he said, "and civilisation will win until its enemies
learn from it the importance of the machine.  The compact must
endure until there is a counter-compact.  Consider the ways of
that form of foolishness which to-day we call nihilism or anarchy. 
A few illiterate bandits in a Paris slum defy the world, and in
a week they are in jail.  Half a dozen crazy Russian <em>intellectuels</em>
in Geneva conspire to upset the Romanoffs and are hunted down
by the police of Europe.  All the Governments and their not very
intelligent police forces join hands, and hey, presto! there is
an end of the conspirators.  For civilisation knows how to use
such powers as it has, while the immense potentiality of the unlicensed
is dissipated in vapour.  Civilisation wins because it is a world-wide
league; its enemies fail because they are parochial.  But supposing&#11834;"</p>

<p>Again he stopped and rose from his chair.  He found a switch
and flooded the room with light.  I glanced up blinking to see
my host smiling down on me, a most benevolent and courteous old
gentleman. He had resumed his tinted glasses.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, "for leaving you in darkness while I bored
you with my gloomy prognostications.  A recluse is apt to forget
what is due to a guest."</p>

<p>He handed the cigar-box to me, and pointed to a table where whisky
and mineral waters had been set out.</p>

<p>"I want to hear the end of your prophecies," I said.  "You were
saying&#11834;?"</p>

<p>"I said&mdash;supposing anarchy learned from civilisation and became
international.  Oh, I don't mean the bands of advertising donkeys
who call themselves International Unions of Workers and such-like
rubbish.  I mean if the real brain-stuff of the world were internationalised. 
Suppose that the links in the cordon of civilisation were neutralised
by other links in a far more potent chain.  The earth is seething
with incoherent power and unorganised intelligence.  Have you
ever reflected on the case of China?  There you have millions
of quick brains stifled in trumpery crafts.  They have no direction,
no driving power, so the sum of their efforts is futile, and the
world laughs at China.  Europe throws her a million or two on
loan now and then, and she cynically responds by begging the prayers
of Christendom.  And yet, I say, supposing&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It's a horrible idea," I said, "and, thank God, I don't believe
it possible.  Mere destruction is too barren a creed to inspire
a new Napoleon, and you can do with nothing short of one."</p>

<p>"It would scarcely be destruction," he replied gently.  "Let
us call it iconoclasm, the swallowing of formulas, which has always
had its full retinue of idealists.  And you do not want a Napoleon. 
All that is needed is direction, which could be given by men of
far lower gifts than a Bonaparte.  In a word, you want a Power-House,
and then the age of miracles will begin."</p>

<p>I got up, for the hour was late, and I had had enough of this
viewy talk.  My host was smiling, and I think that smile was the
thing I really disliked about him.  It was too&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;superior
and Olympian.</p>

<p>As he led me into the hall he apologised for indulging his whims.
"But you, as a lawyer, should welcome the idea.  If there is an
atom of truth in my fancies, your task is far bigger than you
thought. You are not defending an easy case, but fighting in a
contest where the issues are still doubtful.  That should encourage
your professional pride..."</p>

<p>By all the rules I should have been sleepy, for it was past midnight,
and I had had a long day in the open air.  But that wretched talk
had unsettled me, and I could not get my mind off it.  I have
reproduced very crudely the substance of my host's conversation,
but no words of mine could do justice to his eery persuasiveness. 
There was a kind of magnetism in the man, a sense of vast powers
and banked-up fires, which would have given weight to the tritest
platitudes.  I had a horrible feeling that he was trying to convince
me, to fascinate me, to prepare the ground for some proposal. 
Again and again I told myself it was crazy nonsense, the heated
dream of a visionary, but again and again I came back to some
details which had a horrid air of reality.  If the man was a romancer
he had an uncommon gift of realism.</p>

<p>I flung open my bedroom window and let in the soft air of the
June night and the scents from leagues of clover and pines and
sweet grasses.  It momentarily refreshed me, for I could not believe
that this homely and gracious world held such dire portents.</p>

<p>But always that phrase of his, the "Power-House," kept recurring.
You know how twisted your thoughts get during a wakeful night,
and long before I fell asleep towards morning I had worked myself
up into a very complete dislike of that bland and smiling gentleman,
my host. Suddenly it occurred to me that I did not know his name,
and that set me off on another train of reflection.</p>

<p>I did not wait to be called, but rose about seven, dressed, and
went downstairs.  I heard the sound of a car on the gravel of
the drive, and to my delight saw that Stagg had arrived.  I wanted
to get away from the house as soon as possible, and I had no desire
to meet its master again in this world.</p>

<p>The grim housekeeper, who answered my summons, received my explanation
in silence.  Breakfast would be ready in twenty minutes; eight
was Mr. Lumley's hour for it.</p>

<p>"Mr. Andrew Lumley?" I asked with a start.</p>

<p>"Mr. Andrew Lumley," she said.</p>

<p>So that was my host's name.  I sat down at a bureau in the hall
and did a wildly foolish thing.</p>

<p>I wrote a letter, beginning "Dear Mr. Lumley," thanking him for
his kindness and explaining the reason of my early departure. 
It was imperative, I said, that I should be in London by midday. 
Then I added: "I wish I had known who you were last night, for
I think you know an old friend of mine, Charles Pitt-Heron."</p>

<p>Breakfastless I joined Stagg in the car, and soon we were swinging
down from the uplands to the shallow vale of the Wey.  My thoughts
were very little on my new toy or on the mid-summer beauties of
Surrey.  The friend of Pitt-Heron, who knew about his going to
Bokhara, was the maniac who dreamed of the "Power-House."  There
were going to be dark scenes in the drama before it was played
out.</p>
