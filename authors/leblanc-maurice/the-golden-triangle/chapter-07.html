<p>The great hall that ran from Rue Raynouard to the upper terrace of the
garden was filled to half its extent by a wide staircase and divided the
Essarès house into two parts communicating only by way of the hall.
</p>
<p>On the left were the drawing-room and the library, which was followed by
an independent block containing a private staircase. On the right were a
billiard-room and the dining-room, both with lower ceilings. Above these
were Essarès Bey's bedroom, on the street side, and Coralie's,
overlooking the garden. Beyond was the servants' wing, where old Siméon
also used to sleep.
</p><p>Patrice was asked to wait in the billiard-room, with the Senegalese. He
had been there about a quarter of an hour when Siméon and the maid were
shown in.
</p><p>The old secretary seemed quite paralyzed by the death of his employer
and was holding forth under his breath, making queer gestures as he
spoke. Patrice asked him how things were going; and the old fellow
whispered in his ear:
</p><p>"It's not over yet . . . There's something to fear . . . to fear! . . .
To-day . . . presently."
</p><p>"Presently?" asked Patrice.
</p><p>"Yes . . . yes," said the old man, trembling.
</p><p>He said nothing more. As for the housemaid, she readily told her story
in reply to Patrice' questions:
</p><p>"The first surprise, sir, this morning was that there was no butler, no
footman, no porter. All the three were gone. Then, at half-past six, M.
Siméon came and told us from the master that the master had locked
himself in his library and that he wasn't to be disturbed even for
breakfast. The mistress was not very well. She had her chocolate at nine
o'clock. . . . At ten o'clock she went out with M. Siméon. Then, after
we had done the bedrooms, we never left the kitchen. Eleven o'clock
came, twelve . . . and, just as the hour was striking, we heard a loud
ring at the front-door. I looked out of the window. There was a motor,
with four gentlemen inside. I went to the door. The commissary of police
explained who he was and wanted to see the master. I showed them the
way. The library-door was locked. We knocked: no answer. We shook it: no
answer. In the end, one of the gentlemen, who knew how, picked the lock.
. . . Then . . . then . . . you can imagine what we saw. . . . But you
can't, it was much worse, because the poor master at that moment had his
head almost under the grate. . . . Oh, what scoundrels they must have
been! . . . For they did kill him, didn't they? I know one of the
gentlemen said at once that the master had died of a stroke and fallen
into the fire. Only my firm belief is . . ."
</p><p>Old Siméon had listened without speaking, with his head still half
wrapped up, showing only his bristly gray beard and his eyes hidden
behind their yellow spectacles. But at this point of the story he gave
a little chuckle, came up to Patrice and said in his ear:
</p><p>"There's something to fear . . . to fear! . . . Mme. Coralie. . . . Make
her go away at once . . . make her go away. . . . If not, it'll be the
worse for her. . . ."
</p><p>Patrice shuddered and tried to question him, but could learn nothing
more. Besides, the old man did not remain. A policeman came to fetch him
and took him to the library.
</p><p>His evidence lasted a long time. It was followed by the depositions of
the cook and the housemaid. Next, Coralie's evidence was taken, in her
own room. At four o'clock another car arrived. Patrice saw two gentlemen
pass into the hall, with everybody bowing very low before them. He
recognized the minister of justice and the minister of the interior.
They conferred in the library for half an hour and went away again.
</p><p>At last, shortly before five o'clock, a policeman came for Patrice and
showed him up to the first floor. The man tapped at a door and stood
aside. Patrice entered a small boudoir, lit up by a wood fire by which
two persons were seated: Coralie, to whom he bowed, and, opposite her,
the gentleman who had spoken to him on his arrival and who seemed to be
directing the whole enquiry.
</p><p>He was a man of about fifty, with a thickset body and a heavy face, slow
of movement, but with bright, intelligent eyes.
</p><p>"The examining-magistrate, I presume, sir?" asked Patrice.
</p><p>"No," he replied, "I am M. Masseron, a retired magistrate, specially
appointed to clear up this affair . . . not to examine it, as you
think, for it does not seem to me that there is anything to examine."
</p><p>"What?" cried Patrice, in great surprise. "Nothing to examine?"
</p><p>He looked at Coralie, who kept her eyes fixed upon him attentively. Then
she turned them on M. Masseron, who resumed:
</p><p>"I have no doubt, Captain Belval, that, when we have said what we have
to say, we shall be agreed at all points . . . just as madame and I are
already agreed."
</p><p>"I don't doubt it either," said Patrice. "All the same, I am afraid that
many of those points remain unexplained."
</p><p>"Certainly, but we shall find an explanation, we shall find it together.
Will you please tell me what you know?"
</p><p>Patrice waited for a moment and then said:
</p><p>"I will not disguise my astonishment, sir. The story which I have to
tell is of some importance; and yet there is no one here to take it
down. Is it not to count as evidence given on oath, as a deposition
which I shall have to sign?"
</p><p>"You yourself, captain, shall determine the value of your words and the
innuendo which you wish them to bear. For the moment, we will look on
this as a preliminary conversation, as an exchange of views relating to
facts . . . touching which Mme. Essarès has given me, I believe, the
same information that you will be able to give me."
</p><p>Patrice did not reply at once. He had a vague impression that there was
a private understanding between Coralie and the magistrate and that, in
face of that understanding, he, both by his presence and by his zeal,
was playing the part of an intruder whom they would gladly have
dismissed. He resolved therefore to maintain an attitude of reserve
until the magistrate had shown his hand.
</p><p>"Of course," he said, "I daresay madame has told you. So you know of the
conversation which I overheard yesterday at the restaurant?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And the attempt to kidnap Mme. Essarès?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And the murder? . . ."
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Mme. Essarès has described to you the blackmailing scene that took
place last night, with M. Essarès for a victim, the details of the
torture, the death of the colonel, the handing over of the four
millions, the conversation on the telephone between M. Essarès and a
certain Grégoire and, lastly, the threats uttered against madame by her
husband?"
</p><p>"Yes, Captain Belval, I know all this, that is to say, all that you
know; and I know, in addition, all that I discovered through my own
investigations."
</p><p>"Of course, of course," Patrice repeated. "I see that my story becomes
superfluous and that you are in possession of all the necessary factors
to enable you to draw your conclusions." And, continuing to put rather
than answer questions, he added, "May I ask what inference you have
arrived at?"
</p><p>"To tell you the truth, captain, my inferences are not definite.
However, until I receive some proof to the contrary, I propose to remain
satisfied with the actual words of a letter which M. Essarès wrote to
his wife at about twelve o'clock this morning and which we found lying
on his desk, unfinished. Mme. Essarès asked me to read it and, if
necessary, to communicate the contents to you. Listen."
</p><p>M. Masseron proceeded to read the letter aloud:
</p><p>      "<u>Coralie</u>,
</p><pre>
      "You were wrong yesterday to attribute my departure to
      reasons which I dared not acknowledge; and perhaps I
      also was wrong not to defend myself more convincingly
      against your accusation. The only motive for my
      departure is the hatred with which I am surrounded.
      You have seen how fierce it is. In the face of these
      enemies who are seeking to despoil me by every
      possible means, my only hope of salvation lies in
      flight. That is why I am going away.
      "But let me remind you, Coralie, of my clearly
      expressed wish. You are to join me at the first
      summons. If you do not leave Paris then, nothing shall
      protect you against my lawful resentment: nothing, not
      even my death. I have made all my arrangements so
      that, even in the contingency . . ."</pre>
<p>"The letter ends there," said M. Masseron, handing it back to Coralie,
"and we know by an unimpeachable sign that the last lines were written
immediately before M. Essarès' death, because, in falling, he upset a
little clock which stood on his desk and which marked twenty-three
minutes past twelve. I assume that he felt unwell and that, on trying to
rise, he was seized with a fit of giddiness and fell to the floor.
Unfortunately, the fireplace was near, with a fierce fire blazing in it;
his head struck the grate; and the wound that resulted was so deep--the
surgeon testified to this--that he fainted. Then the fire close at hand
did its work . . . with the effects which you have seen. . . ."
</p><p>Patrice had listened in amazement to this unexpected explanation:
</p><p>"Then in your opinion," he asked, "M. Essarès died of an accident? He
was not murdered?"
</p><p>"Murdered? Certainly not! We have no clue to support any such theory."
</p><p>"Still . . ."
</p><p>"Captain Belval, you are the victim of an association of ideas which, I
admit, is perfectly justifiable. Ever since yesterday you have been
witnessing a series of tragic incidents; and your imagination naturally
leads you to the most tragic solution, that of murder.
Only--reflect--why should a murder have been committed? And by whom? By
Bournef and his friends? With what object? They were crammed full with
bank-notes; and, even admitting that the man called Grégoire recovered
those millions from them, they would certainly not have got them back by
killing M. Essarès. Then again, how would they have entered the house?
And how can they have gone out? . . . No, captain, you must excuse me,
but M. Essarès died an accidental death. The facts are undeniable; and
this is the opinion of the divisional surgeon, who will draw up his
report in that sense."
</p><p>Patrice turned to Coralie:
</p><p>"Is it Mme. Essarès' opinion also?"
</p><p>She reddened slightly and answered:
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"And old Siméon's?"
</p><p>"Oh," replied the magistrate, "old Siméon is wandering in his mind! To
listen to him, you would think that everything was about to happen all
over again, that Mme. Essarès is threatened with danger and that she
ought to take to flight at once. That is all that I have been able to
get out of him. However, he took me to an old disused door that opens
out of the garden on a lane running at right angles with the Rue
Raynouard; and here he showed me first the watch-dog's dead body and
next some footprints between the door and the flight of steps near the
library. But you know those foot-prints, do you not? They belong to you
and your Senegalese. As for the death of the watch-dog, I can put that
down to your Senegalese, can't I?"
</p><p>Patrice was beginning to understand. The magistrate's reticence, his
explanation, his agreement with Coralie: all this was gradually becoming
plain. He put the question frankly:
</p><p>"So there was no murder?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"Then there will be no magistrate's examination?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"And no talk about the matter; it will all be kept quiet, in short, and
forgotten?"
</p><p>"Just so."
</p><p>Captain Belval began to walk up and down, as was his habit. He now
remembered Essarès' prophecy:
</p><p>"I sha'n't be arrested. . . . If I am, I shall be let go. . . . The
matter will be hushed up. . . ."
</p><p>Essarès was right. The hand of justice was arrested; and there was no
way for Coralie to escape silent complicity.
</p><p>Patrice was intensely annoyed by the manner in which the case was being
handled. It was certain that a compact had been concluded between
Coralie and M. Masseron. He suspected the magistrate of circumventing
Coralie and inducing her to sacrifice her own interests to other
considerations. To effect this, the first thing was to get rid of him,
Patrice.
</p><p>"Ugh!" said Patrice to himself. "I'm fairly sick of this sportsman, with
his cool ironical ways. It looks as if he were doing a considerable
piece of thimblerigging at my expense."
</p><p>He restrained himself, however, and, with a pretense of wanting to keep
on good terms with the magistrate, came and sat down beside him:
</p><p>"You must forgive me, sir," he said, "for insisting in what may appear
to you an indiscreet fashion. But my conduct is explained not only by
such sympathy or feeling as I entertain for Mme. Essarès at a moment in
her life when she is more lonely than ever, a sympathy and feeling which
she seems to repulse even more firmly than she did before. It is also
explained by certain mysterious links which unite us to each other and
which go back to a period too remote for our eyes to focus. Has Mme.
Essarès told you those details? In my opinion, they are most important;
and I cannot help associating them with the events that interest us."
</p><p>M. Masseron glanced at Coralie, who nodded. He answered:
</p><p>"Yes, Mme. Essarès has informed me and even . . ."
</p><p>He hesitated once more and again consulted Coralie, who flushed and
seemed put out of countenance. M. Masseron, however, waited for a reply
which would enable him to proceed. She ended by saying, in a low voice:
</p><p>"Captain Belval is entitled to know what we have discovered. The truth
belongs as much to him as to me; and I have no right to keep it from
him. Pray speak, monsieur."
</p><p>"I doubt if it is even necessary to speak," said the magistrate. "It
will be enough, I think, to show the captain this photograph-album which
I have found. Here you are, Captain Belval."
</p><p>And he handed Patrice a very slender album, covered in gray canvas and
fastened with an india-rubber band.
</p><p>Patrice took it with a certain anxiety. But what he saw on opening it
was so utterly unexpected that he gave an exclamation:
</p><p>"It's incredible!"
</p><p>On the first page, held in place by their four corners, were two
photographs: one, on the right, representing a small boy in an Eton
jacket; the other, on the left, representing a very little girl. There
was an inscription under each. On the right: "Patrice, at ten." On the
left: "Coralie, at three."
</p><p>Moved beyond expression, Patrice turned the leaf. On the second page
they appeared again, he at the age of fifteen, she at the age of eight.
And he saw himself at nineteen and at twenty-three and at twenty-eight,
always accompanied by Coralie, first as a little girl, then as a young
girl, next as a woman.
</p><p>"This is incredible!" he cried. "How is it possible? Here are portraits
of myself which I had never seen, amateur photographs obviously, which
trace my whole life. Here's one when I was doing my military training.
. . . Here I am on horseback . . . Who can have ordered these
photographs? And who can have collected them together with yours,
madame?"
</p><p>He fixed his eyes on Coralie, who evaded their questioning gaze and
lowered her head as though the close connection between their two lives,
to which those pages bore witness, had shaken her to the very depths of
her being.
</p><p>"Who can have brought them together?" he repeated. "Do you know? And
where does the album come from?"
</p><p>M. Masseron supplied the answer:
</p><p>"It was the surgeon who found it. M. Essarès wore a vest under his
shirt; and the album was in an inner pocket, a pocket sewn inside the
vest. The surgeon felt the boards through it when he was undressing M.
Essarès' body."
</p><p>This time, Patrice's and Coralie's eyes met. The thought that M. Essarès
had been collecting both their photographs during the past twenty years
and that he wore them next to his breast and that he had lived and died
with them upon him, this thought amazed them so much that they did not
even try to fathom its strange significance.
</p><p>"Are you sure of what you are saying, sir?" asked Patrice.
</p><p>"I was there," said M. Masseron. "I was present at the discovery.
Besides, I myself made another which confirms this one and completes it
in a really surprising fashion. I found a pendant, cut out of a solid
block of amethyst and held in a setting of filigree-work."
</p><p>"What's that?" cried Captain Belval. "What's that? A pendant? An
amethyst pendant?"
</p><p>"Look for yourself, sir," suggested the magistrate, after once more
consulting Mme. Essarès with a glance.
</p><p>And he handed Captain Belval an amethyst pendant, larger than the ball
formed by joining the two halves which Coralie and Patrice possessed,
she on her rosary and he on his bunch of seals; and this new ball was
encircled with a specimen of gold filigree-work exactly like that on the
rosary and on the seal.
</p><p>The setting served as a clasp.
</p><p>"Am I to open it?" he asked.
</p><p>Coralie nodded. He opened the pendant. The inside was divided by a
movable glass disk, which separated two miniature photographs, one of
Coralie as a nurse, the other of himself, wounded, in an officer's
uniform.
</p><p>Patrice reflected, with pale cheeks. Presently he asked:
</p><p>"And where does this pendant come from? Did you find it, sir?"
</p><p>"Yes, Captain Belval."
</p><p>"Where?"
</p><p>The magistrate seemed to hesitate. Coralie's attitude gave Patrice the
impression that she was unaware of this detail. M. Masseron at last
said:
</p><p>"I found it in the dead man's hand."
</p><p>"In the dead man's hand? In M. Essarès' hand?"
</p><p>Patrice had given a start, as though under an unexpected blow, and was
now leaning over the magistrate, greedily awaiting a reply which he
wanted to hear for the second time before accepting it as certain.
</p><p>"Yes, in his hand. I had to force back the clasped fingers in order to
release it."
</p><p>Belval stood up and, striking the table with his fist, exclaimed:
</p><p>"Well, sir, I will tell you one thing which I was keeping back as a last
argument to prove to you that my collaboration is of use; and this thing
becomes of great importance after what we have just learnt. Sir, this
morning some one asked to speak to me on the telephone; and I had hardly
answered the call when this person, who seemed greatly excited, was the
victim of a murderous assault, committed in my hearing. And, amid the
sound of the scuffle and the cries of agony, I caught the following
words, which the unhappy man insisted on trying to get to me as so many
last instructions: 'Patrice! . . . Coralie! . . . The amethyst pendant.
. . . Yes, I have it on me. . . . The pendant. . . . Ah, it's too late!
. . . I should so much have liked. . . . Patrice. . . . Coralie. . . .'
There's what I heard, sir, and here are the two facts which we cannot
escape. This morning, at nineteen minutes past seven, a man was murdered
having upon him an amethyst pendant. This is the first undeniable fact.
A few hours later, at twenty-three minutes past twelve, this same
amethyst pendant is discovered clutched in the hand of another man. This
is the second undeniable fact. Place these facts side by side and you
are bound to come to the conclusion that the first murder, the one of
which I caught the distant echo, was committed here, in this house, in
the same library which, since yesterday evening, witnessed the end of
every scene in the tragedy which we are contemplating."
</p><p>This revelation, which in reality amounted to a fresh accusation against
Essarès, seemed to affect the magistrate profoundly. Patrice had flung
himself into the discussion with a passionate vehemence and a logical
reasoning which it was impossible to disregard without evident
insincerity.
</p><p>Coralie had turned aside slightly and Patrice could not see her face;
but he suspected her dismay in the presence of all this infamy and
shame.
</p><p>M. Masseron raised an objection:
</p><p>"Two undeniable facts, you say, Captain Belval? As to the first point,
let me remark that we have not found the body of the man who is supposed
to have been murdered at nineteen minutes past seven this morning."
</p><p>"It will be found in due course."
</p><p>"Very well. Second point: as regards the amethyst pendant discovered in
Essarès' hand, how can we tell that Essarès Bey found it in the murdered
man's hand and not somewhere else? For, after all, we do not know if he
was at home at that time and still less if he was in his library."
</p><p>"But I do know."
</p><p>"How?"
</p><p>"I telephoned to him a few minutes later and he answered. More than
that, to sweep away any trace of doubt, he told me that he had rung me
up but that he had been cut off."
</p><p>M. Masseron thought for a moment and then said:
</p><p>"Did he go out this morning?"
</p><p>"Ask Mme. Essarès."
</p><p>Without turning round, manifestly wishing to avoid Belval's eyes,
Coralie answered:
</p><p>"I don't think that he went out. The suit he was wearing at the time of
his death was an indoor suit."
</p><p>"Did you see him after last night?"
</p><p>"He came and knocked at my room three times this morning, between seven
and nine o'clock. I did not open the door. At about eleven o'clock I
started off alone; I heard him call old Siméon and tell him to go with
me. Siméon caught me up in the street. That is all I know."
</p><p>A prolonged silence ensued. Each of the three was meditating upon this
strange series of adventures. In the end, M. Masseron, who had realized
that a man of Captain Belval's stamp was not the sort to be easily
thrust aside, spoke in the tone of one who, before coming to terms,
wishes to know exactly what his adversary's last word is likely to be:
</p><p>"Let us come to the point, captain. You are building up a theory which
strikes me as very vague. What is it precisely? And what are you
proposing to do if I decline to accept it? I have asked you two very
plain questions. Do you mind answering them?"
</p><p>"I will answer them, sir, as plainly as you put them."
</p><p>He went up to the magistrate and said:
</p><p>"Here, sir, is the field of battle and of attack--yes, of attack, if
need be--which I select. A man who used to know me, who knew Mme.
Essarès as a child and who was interested in both of us, a man who used
to collect our portraits at different ages, who had reasons for loving
us unknown to me, who sent me the key of that garden and who was making
arrangements to bring us together for a purpose which he would have told
us, this man was murdered at the moment when he was about to execute
his plan. Now everything tells me that he was murdered by M. Essarès. I
am therefore resolved to lodge an information, whatever the results of
my action may be. And believe me, sir, my charge will not be hushed up.
There are always means of making one's self heard . . . even if I am
reduced to shouting the truth from the house-tops."
</p><p>M. Masseron burst out laughing:
</p><p>"By Jove, captain, but you're letting yourself go!"
</p><p>"I'm behaving according to my conscience; and Mme. Essarès, I feel sure,
will forgive me. She knows that I am acting for her good. She knows that
all will be over with her if this case is hushed up and if the
authorities do not assist her. She knows that the enemies who threaten
her are implacable. They will stop at nothing to attain their object and
to do away with her, for she stands in their way. And the terrible thing
about it is that the most clear-seeing eyes are unable to make out what
that object is. We are playing the most formidable game against these
enemies; and we do not even know what the stakes are. Only the police
can discover those stakes."
</p><p>M. Masseron waited for a second or two and then, laying his hand on
Patrice's shoulder, said, calmly:
</p><p>"And, suppose the authorities knew what the stakes were?"
</p><p>Patrice looked at him in surprise:
</p><p>"What? Do you mean to say you know?"
</p><p>"Perhaps."
</p><p>"And can you tell me?"
</p><p>"Oh, well, if you force me to!"
</p><p>"What are they?"
</p><p>"Not much! A trifle!"
</p><p>"But what sort of trifle?"
</p><p>"A thousand million francs."
</p><p>"A thousand millions?"
</p><p>"Just that. A thousand millions, of which two-thirds, I regret to say,
if not three-quarters, had already left France before the war. But the
remaining two hundred and fifty or three hundred millions are worth more
than a thousand millions all the same, for a very good reason."
</p><p>"What reason?"
</p><p>"They happen to be in gold."
