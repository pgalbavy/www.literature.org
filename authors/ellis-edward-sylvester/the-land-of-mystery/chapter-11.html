<p>Jared Long, the New Englander, and Quincal, the native helper,
were the sentinels on duty in the immediate vicinity of the camp.</p>

<p>The professor was wearied from a hard day's work, and, feeling
that everything possible had been done for the safety of all,
stretched out upon his blanket on the soft ground and was soon
asleep.</p>

<p>He expected to assume his duty as guardsman in the course of
a few hours, and needed all the rest he could get before that
time.</p>

<p>Bippo and Pedros were so disturbed by what they had witnessed,
that, though they lay down at the same time, it was a good while
before they closed their eyes in slumber.  Their homes were near
the mouth of the Xingu, and, even at that remote point, they had
heard so many fearful accounts of the ferocious savages that infested
the upper portions of the river, that they never would have dared
to help in an attempt to explore the region but for the liberal
pay promised, and their unbounded faith in the white men and their
firearms.</p>

<p>The poor fellows would have given all they had, or expected to
have, to be transported down the Xingu and out of the reach of
the terrible natives who used their poisoned arrows and javelins
with such effect; but, behold! the explorers, undaunted by what
had taken place, had no thought of turning back, but were resolved
to push on for an unknown distance, and Bippo and his friends
had no choice but to go with them, for to run away would insure
certain death at the hands of these people who seemed to be all
around them.</p>

<p>Jared Long had so little faith in the usefulness of the servant
Quincal as sentinel, that he arranged to place the least dependence
possible on him.  With no supposition that any danger was likely
to come from the woods behind them, he sent the fellow a short
distance back, instructing him to keep his ears and eyes open,
since if he failed to do so, some wild animal was likely to devour
him.</p>

<p>In crossing the Xingu below the falls, the rapid current had
swept the canoe downward, so that it lay against the bank at a
point fully two hundred yards below.  It was here that the American
stationed himself, standing, like Fred Ashman, just far enough
from the water to be shrouded in the slight but increasing shadow
made as the moon slowly worked over and beyond the zenith.</p>

<p>Looking across to the other shore, he could discern nothing upon
which to hang a suspicion; but the first thing, perhaps trifling
in itself, which attracted notice, was the unusual quantity of
driftwood which appeared to be coming through the rapids and floating
past.</p>

<p>As has been stated, in such a wooded country as the Matto Grasso
there was always more or less of this, and Long had taken a critical
survey of the rapids and noted the stuff which went plunging and
dancing through them.  Now, however, he was sure there was an
increase, and a good deal of it consisted of large trees and logs,
which must have been brought down by some cause more than ordinary.</p>

<p>Had there been anything else to occupy his attention, the fact
would have escaped him, but the sentinel who is alive to his duty,
notes little things, even when they seem to have no bearing on
the great subject which engages all his energies.</p>

<p>It was a long way from the camp to the source of the Xingu, and
in such a vast country as Brazil, there might have been a violent
storm raging at that moment above and below them without the least
evidence, so far as they could see, around them.  Like all countries,
that portion of empire is ravaged at times by fierce hurricanes
and cyclones, which might have uprooted scores of trees and flung
them into the waters which were now bearing them toward the Amazon
and the broad Atlantic.</p>

<p>The sentinel naturally gave his chief attention to the other
side of the Xingu, where so many stirring scenes had taken place
that afternoon and evening.  The camp-fire, which had been left
burning, had smouldered so low that none of the embers were discernible,
and only a thin column of smoke crept slowly upward marking where
it had been. But this vapor was so clearly seen in the wonderful
moonlight that it was easy to fix the precise point where the
trail entered the wilderness.</p>

<p>It was just there, as Long believed, that the savages would debouch
into sight, and renew the warfare which thus far had been only
one series of disasters to them.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken, when, shortly after he had noticed the increasing
number of logs and driftwood, he fancied he detected something
going on at the very point on which his gaze was fixed.</p>

<p>As was the case with Fred Ashman, it was some time before he
could so much as conjecture its nature.  The glimpses were so
faint and momentary that nothing tangible resulted, though he
was positive that some of their enemies were there.</p>

<p>At the moment he uttered an exclamation of impatience, he made
out three figures of the natives, who advanced far enough from
the wood for him to identify them.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they walked stealthily to the edge of the
river and stood several minutes, as if looking across at the canoe.</p>

<p>Long was confident that he could drop one of them at least, and
he was tempted to do so.  The most effective way of keeping the
savages off was by nipping their schemes in the bud, and filling
them with additional terror of the white strangers.</p>

<p>But he decided to wait a while, suspecting, as he did, that some
scheme whose nature he could not guess was under way, and that
if the projectors were undisturbed, it would soon be revealed.</p>

<p>Jared Long, we say, was convinced that the natives were scrutinizing
the canoe and seeking to learn something about the occupants,
whom they had doubtless watched as they made their way from the
water to the shelter of the wood.  Such was his belief, and yet
he was altogether mistaken.</p>

<p>It struck him as odd that the savages acted as they did, when
it would seem that they could see just as well from the edge of
the wood, where they were not exposed to the fire of their enemies;
but he reflected that there was precious little about the conduct
of the natives from the first that could be explained on the line
of common sense and consistency.</p>

<p>The trio stood in view less than five minutes, when they darted
back to cover, as if afraid of being seen by the whites, a theory
altogether untenable under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The natural supposition of the sentinel was that a large number
of the savages had gathered under the bank and were making ready
for some demonstration, which would soon take place.</p>

<p>It was not yet time to awaken the Professor and the natives. 
In fact, the plucky New Englander half believed that with his
repeating rifle he would be able to beat off any approach from
the other shore.</p>

<p>At this moment, he was amazed to see one of the savages do an
extraordinary thing.</p>

<p>Darting out from the wood behind him, he ran to the smouldering
camp-fire seized a brand that was covered with ashes, and circled
it so swiftly about his head that it was fanned into a roaring
blaze.</p>

<p>While doing this, he stood apparently with one foot in the margin
of the Xingu, and evidently with not the slightest fear of the
white strangers within gun-shot.  He not only swung the brand
forward several times, but reversed and spun it in the other direction,
with a velocity that made it look like a solid ring of fire.</p>

<p>Suddenly the truth flashed upon the bewildered sentinel: <em>the
savage was signaling to some friend or friends on the other bank</em>! 
That being the case, it followed that the friend or friends were
most uncomfortably close to the camp of the white men.</p>

<p>And still Long failed to attach any importance to the unusual
quantity of logs and driftwood that was sweeping down the Xingu
in front of him.</p>
