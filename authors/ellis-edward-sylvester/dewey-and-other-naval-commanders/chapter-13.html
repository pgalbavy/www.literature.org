<p>Captains Carden and Decatur&mdash;Cruise of the <em>Macedonian</em>
&mdash;Battle with the Frigate <em>United States</em> &mdash;Decatur's
Chivalry.</p>

<p>Before the war broke out between England and the United States
the naval officers naturally were on the best of terms with one
another. They exchanged visits, had dinners together and talked
in the most friendly terms over the relations of their respective
countries. Brave men always feel thus, and no matter how fiercely
they have been fighting, they become friends again as soon as
peace is declared.</p>

<p>You have already been told considerable about Stephen Decatur,
one of the bravest and most chivalrous men that ever drew a sword.
At the breaking out of the War of 1812 he was given command of
the frigate <em>United States</em>, of 44 guns, built in 1798,
and one of the finest in the American navy. While lying at Norfolk,
some months before war was declared, the British frigate <em>Macedonian</em>,
of about the same strength, was in port, and the officers and
crews became well acquainted.</p>

<p>The commander of the <em>Macedonian</em> was Captain John Surman
Carden, one of the finest officers in the British service. He
and Decatur became fond of each other and often discussed the
probable results of the impending naval contests, for it was apparent
to both that their countries were on the brink of war. Captain
Carden conceded the bravery and skill of the American officers
and seamen, but insisted that they would be at a disadvantage,
because they had not met with the experience of the Englishmen,
who had been engaged in so many wars with European nations.</p>

<p>The <em>Macedonian</em> was made of oak and was without a superior
in the British navy. In the latter part of September, 1812, she
left Portsmouth, England. She was just off the docks and her crew,
297 in number, were such as the best officer would have been proud
to command. The discipline was as near perfection as possible,
Captain Carden being one of the severest of disciplinarians. His
business was to look out for French merchantmen and warships,
though as it was known that war had been declared with the United
States, it was deemed probable that Captain Carden would have
a chance of testing the mettle of her naval officers and crews.</p>

<p>There were two American vessels that Captain Carden was specially
anxious to meet. One was the <em>Essex</em>, which was playing
havoc among the English shipping (and of which I shall tell you
something later on), and the other that of Captain Stephen Decatur,
the courteous but brave naval officer who had displayed so much
intrepidity in the war with Tripoli and had insisted to Carden
that the American sailors were the match of the English anywhere.</p>

<p>While at Madeira Captain Carden learned that the <em>Essex</em>
had sailed from the Delaware and was expected to cruise in the
neighborhood of the Canary Islands. The Englishman turned southward
and was within a few days' sail of the islands when, on the 25th
of October, the man at the masthead reported a sail. As it approached
it was carefully scrutinized and found to be a frigate bearing
down on the <em>Macedonian</em>.</p>

<p>Convinced that she was an enemy, Captain Carden at once issued
the command to clear for action. The most thorough preparations
were made and officers were stationed with orders to shoot down
the first man who flinched from his duty. On board the ship were
a number of American seamen, who began speculating among themselves
as to whether the approaching frigate was a Frenchman or belonged
to their own country. They were in a trying position, for they
were patriotic and would have given anything in the world to escape
firing upon their countrymen, but there was no help for it. Such
a rigid disciplinarian as Captain Carden would listen to no protests
from them, and, should the stranger prove to be an American, it
would be a choice between helping to fight her or being shot down
by their own officers.</p>

<p>The approaching frigate went through a number of evolutions of
such a rapid and brilliant nature that the Englishmen murmured
their admiration. Through their glasses the officers could see
groups of men on the quarter deck scanning them closely, while
glimpses of sailors were caught as they moved about the deck and
of the gun crews standing quietly at their stations. Then, when
there was a change of direction, parties of marines were observed
in her tops, muskets in hand, coolly awaiting the time when the
ships would engage at close quarters.</p>

<p>While Captain Carden and his officers were in doubt whether the
ship was a French one she gave her colors to the breeze. They
were the Stars and Stripes of the American Republic. One of the
finest of its frigates had thrown down the gage of battle to as
superb a frigate as belonged to the British navy.</p>

<p>Since all doubt of her nationality was dispelled, one of the
American seamen walked resolutely to Captain Carden, saluted and
told him that he and his companions had no wish to fight the flag
of their country. In reply the officer ordered him back to his
station and with notice that if the request was repeated he would
be shot. Sad to say, the sailor who made his wish known was one
of the first killed in battle.</p>

<p>The two ships now began exchanging shots, but the distance was
too great for any damage on either side. A little after 9 o'clock
on that bright sunshiny Sunday morning they were close enough
for the wonderful marksmanship of the American to display itself.
The first shot that found the <em>Macedonian</em> entered through
the starboard bulwark and killed the sergeant of marines. A minute
later the mizzen topmast was sundered, and, cluttered with sails,
yards and rigging, it fell into the maintop, where it hung suspended,
liable to fall at any moment and crush those beneath.</p>

<p>The fire of the American became frightfully destructive. It seemed
as if every shot splintered some part of the rigging or hull and
killed and wounded men right and left. The exasperating feature
of this awful business was that neither Captain Carden nor his
aids, who were directing operations from the quarter deck, could
discover any corresponding damage on the American ship. Her mizzen
topgallant mast had been carried away, but it looked as if all
the other shots sent in her direction sped past without harm.
She was wrapped in an immense volume of smoke made by her own
broadsides, and through it constantly shot tongues of crimson
flame, while the roar of the rapidly discharged guns was incessant.</p>

<p>Now and then a rift appeared in the billows of vapor, through
which the Stars and Stripes were seen fluttering, while the men
worked as coolly at their guns as if going through manoeuvres
in time of peace. Finally the smoke became so dense that the Americans
were unable to see through it. Ceasing firing for a few minutes,
the frigate moved far enough forward to pass from under the impenetrable
blanket of vapor and then renewed the battle with more terrific
effect than before. Her firing was so rapid that several times
Captain Carden believed the incessant flame indicated she was
on fire. The report was spread among his men to encourage them,
but no such good fortune came to the Englishmen.</p>

<p>One of the men on board the <em>Macedonian</em> gave the following
graphic account of his experience:</p>

<p>"Our men kept cheering with all their might. I cheered with them,
though I confess I scarcely knew what for. Certainly there was
nothing very inspiriting in the aspect of things. Grape shot and
canister were pouring through our portholes like leaden hail.
The large shot came against the ship's side, shaking her to the
very keel, and passing through her timbers and scattering terrific
splinters, which did more appalling work than the shot itself.
A constant stream of wounded men were being hurried to the cockpit
from all quarters of the ship. My feelings were pretty much as
I suppose every one else felt at such a time. That men are without
thought when they stand among the dying and dead is too absurd
an idea to be entertained. We all appeared cheerful, but I know
that many a serious thought ran through my mind. Still, what could
we do but keep up a semblance at least of animation? To run from
our quarters would have been certain death from the hands of our
own officers; to give way to gloom or show fear would do no good
and might brand us with the name of cowards and insure certain
defeat."</p>

<p>In the desperate hope of warding off defeat, Captain Garden now
ordered his helm aport and directed that boarders be called. The
response was prompt, for the British sailor fights with unsurpassable
heroism, but at the critical moment the forebrace was carried
away, the ship was thrown into the wind and exposed to a raking
fire. The American instantly seized the advantage and swept the
decks with murderous destructiveness. In a brief time the <em>Macedonian</em>
was completely disabled. Her rigging was in tatters and splinters
and her hull had been pierced by more than a hundred shot, many
of which struck between wind and water.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>BATTLE BETWEEN THE "UNITED STATES" AND THE
"MACEDONIAN</em>."]</p>

<p>Finally the American ceased firing and drew off to make the few
repairs that were necessary. During the lull Captain Carden called
his surviving officers around him for council. There was indeed
but one thing to do, and it was agreed to surrender. As the American
was returning, therefore, to resume her appalling work the English
colors were hauled down. The victor lay to and lowered a boat,
under charge of a lieutenant, who, as he climbed aboard, gave
his name and that of the American 44-gun frigate as the <em>United
States</em>, Captain Stephen Decatur. The <em>United States</em>,
whose crew numbered 478, had 5 killed and 7 wounded, while the
297 of the <em>Macedonian</em> lost 36 killed and 68 wounded.</p>

<p>So it was that the old friends settled the question over which
they had argued many times. When the English officer came aboard
of the <em>United States</em> and offered his sword to Decatur
the latter said: "I cannot receive the sword of a man who has
defended his ship with such bravery."</p>

<p>The chivalrous nature of Decatur was shown in a private letter
in which he wrote: "One-half of the satisfaction arising from
this victory is destroyed in seeing the mortification of poor
Carden, who deserved success as much as we did who had the good
fortune to obtain it." Everything possible was done to alleviate
the sufferings of the prisoners. The private property of the officers
and seamen was returned or its equivalent in money. In a letter
from Captain Carden to Captain Decatur he expressed his feelings
and added: "I have much gratitude to express to you, my dear sir,
for all your kindnesses, and all my officers feel it equally with
myself. If ever we should turn the tables we will endeavor, if
possible, to improve on your unusual goodness."</p>
