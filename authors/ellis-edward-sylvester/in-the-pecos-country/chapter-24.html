<p>It was nearly noon, and, having failed so completely in his efforts
to regain the pass, Fred determined to devote a little time to
procuring food. He was certain that he would soon require it and
might postpone his hunt too long. Although now and then he suffered
somewhat from want of water, yet it was not for any length of
time. There was an abundance of streams and rivulets, and he frequently
stumbled upon them, when he had no expectation of doing so. Quaffing
his fill from one of these, he rested a few minutes, for he had
been laboring unceasingly for hours.</p>

<p>"What a pity a fellow, when he got caught in such a fix as this,
wasn't like a camel, so that he might store away enough water
to last him a week, and then if he could do the same with what
he ate, he needn't feel scared when he got lost like me."</p>

<p>His gun, of course, was as useless to him as a stick, and although
in his long tramping it became onerous and oppressive, he had
no thought of abandoning it.</p>

<p>"I don't see as there is any chance of killing any animals to
eat, and, if I did, I haven't got any matches to start a fire
to cook them, so I must get what I want some other way."</p>

<p>He had noticed in his wanderings here and there a species of
scarlet berry, about the size of the common cherry, but he refrained
from eating any, fearing that they were poisonous. He now ventured
to taste two or three, and found them by no means unpleasant to
the palate; but, fearful of the consequence, he swallowed but
a little, waiting to see the result before going into the eating
line any more extensively.</p>

<p>A half hour having passed without any internal disturbance, he
fell to and ate fully a pint. There was not much nourishment in
them, but they seemed to serve his purpose very well, and when
he resumed his wandering, he felt somewhat like a giant refreshed
with new wine.</p>

<p>As it seemed useless to lay out any definite line to follow,
Fred made no attempt to do so, believing he was as likely to reach
the ravine by aimless traveling as by acting upon any theory of
his own as to the location of the place he desired to reach. This
he continued to do until the afternoon was about half spent. He
was still plodding along, with some hope of success, when he became
aware of a sickness stealing over him. The thought of the berries,
and the fear that he had been poisoned, gave him such a shock
that the slight nausea was greatly intensified, and he reclined
upon the ground in the hope that it would soon pass over.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, he grew worse, and he stretched out upon
the ground, firmly persuaded that his last hour had came. He was
deathly pale, and had he espied a cougar peering over the corner
of the rock, he would n't have paid him the least attention&mdash;no,
not if there had been a dozen of them!</p>

<p>What alarmed Fred as much as anything was some of the accompaniments
of his trouble. As he laid his head upon the ground, it seemed
to him that he could catch the faint sound of falling water, just
as if there was a little cascade a mile away, and the gentle wind
brought him the soft, musical cadence. Then, too, when he flung
himself upon the ground, it gave forth a hollow sound, such as
he had never heard before. Several times he banged his heel against
the earth, and the same peculiarity was noticed.</p>

<p>All this the poor fellow took as one of the accompaniments of
the poisoning, and as additional proof that he was beyond hope.
He rolled upon the ground in misery, and wondered whether he would
have his mind about him when the last dreadful moment should come;
but after a half hour or more had passed, and he was still himself,
he began to feel a renewal of hope.</p>

<p>"It may be that I ate too many of them," he reflected, as he
found himself able to sit up, "and there's nothing poisonous about
them, after all. If that's so, I've got a good meal, anyway, and
know where to get another."</p>

<p>It was nearly dark, and, as he was still weak, he concluded to
spend the night where he was.</p>

<p>A rod or so away was a dense clump of bushes, which seemed to
offer an inviting shelter, and he gained his feet with the intention
of walking to them. He had taken no more than a couple of steps,
however, when such a dizziness overcame him that he sank at once
to the ground, and stretched out for relief. It was a case of
poisoning beyond question, but not of a dangerous nature; and
Fred had about time to lie flat when he experienced a grateful
relief.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll stay here a while," he muttered, recalling his
experience. "I can crawl in among the bushes in the night, if
I find it getting cold, or any rain falls."</p>

<p>Darkness had scarcely descended, when the lad sank into a quiet,
dreamless slumber. His rest of the night previous had not been
of a refreshing character, and his traveling during the day had
been very exhaustive, so that his wearied system was greatly in
need of rest.</p>

<p>Fred was really in the most delightful climate in the world.
New Mexico is so far south that the heat in many portions, at
certain seasons of the year, assumes a tropical fervor. On some
of the arid plains the sun's rays have an intensity like that
of the Sahara; but numerous ranges of mountains traverse the territory
north and south, with spurs in all directions, and the elevation
of many of these give a temperature as cool and pleasant as can
be desired.</p>

<p>As the lad stretched out upon the ground, he was without a blanket,
or any covering except his ordinary clothes; and he needed nothing
more. The surrounding rocks shut out all wind, and the air was
not warm enough to cause perspiration. The fact was, he had struck
that golden mean which leaves nothing to be desired as regards
the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The sky remained clear, and, as the moon climbed higher and higher
in the sky, it was only at intervals that a fleecy cloud floated
before it, causing fantastic shadows to glide over the ground,
and making strange phantom-like formations among the mountain
peaks and along the chasms, gorges, ravines, and precipices. Had
the sleeping lad awoke and risen to his feet, he would have seen
nothing of wolf, catamount, or Indian, nor would the straining
vision have caught the glimmer of any solitary camp-fire. He was
alone in the great solitude, with no eye but the all-seeing One
to watch over him.</p>

<p>It was a curious fact connected with the boy's wanderings that
more than once he was within a stone's throw of the pass for which
he was so anxiously searching; and yet he never suspected it,
owing to his unfamiliarity with the territory. As is nearly always
the case with an inexperienced hunter, he showed a continual tendency
to travel in a circle, the nature of the ground only preventing
him from doing so.</p>

<p>Fred slept, without disturbance, until after midnight. An hour
or so previous to his waking, when the moon was in the best position
to lighten up the earth below, the figure of a man appeared upon
an eminence, a hundred yards or more away, and stood motionless
for several minutes, as though he were engaged in reverie.</p>

<p>Could one have looked more closely, he would have seen that the
stranger's action and manner showed that he was hunting for something.
He turned slowly around several times, scanning the ravines, gorges,
peaks, and declivities as best he could; but he did not expect
to gain much, without the daylight to assist him, and the result
of the attempt was anything but satisfactory.</p>

<p>Muttering some impatient exclamation, he turned about and walked
slowly away, taking a direction almost the opposite of that which
led toward the sleeping boy. He moved with caution, like one accustomed
to the wilderness, and was soon lost to view in the gloom.</p>

<p>Then Fred Munson awoke, it was with the impression upon him that
he was near some waterfall. He raised his head, but could detect
nothing; but when he placed his ear to the ground, he caught it
once again.</p>

<p>"I have it!" he said to himself; "there is a waterfall somewhere
about here under the ground. That's what makes it sound so hollow
when I stamp on it."</p>

<p>He was greatly relieved to find that no results of his afternoon's
nausea remained by him. He had recovered entirely, and when he
rather doubtingly assumed the sitting position and felt that his
head and stomach remained clear he was considerably elated in
spirits.</p>

<p>"That shows that I can get a meal at any time, if I want it bad
enough to take a few hours' sickness in pay. Maybe I can find
something else to eat which won't be so hard on me. It must be
very near morning, for I have slept a great while."</p>

<p>The hour, however, was earlier then he supposed, and he found,
after sitting awhile, that his old drowsiness was returning.</p>

<p>Before giving way to it, he recalled the clump of bushes, which
was so near that it was easily seen from where he sat.</p>

<p>"I forgot that I meant to make my bed there."</p>

<p>With which he rose and moved toward it, not feeling altogether
certain of the wisdom of what he was doing.</p>

<p>"That looks very much like the place where the cougar was waiting
for me, but I didn't think there were enough in this country to
furnish one for every bush."</p>

<p>He reconnoitered it for several minutes, but finally ventured
upon a closer acquaintance. There certainly was no wild animal
there, and he stooped down and began crawling toward the centre.</p>

<p>He was near the middle when he was alarmed at finding the ground
giving way beneath him. It was sinking rapidly downward, and he
clutched desperately at the bushes to save himself, but those
that he grasped yielded and went, too.</p>

<p>In his terror and despair he cried out, and fought like a madman
to save himself; but there was nothing firm or substantial upon
which he could lay hold, and he was helpless to check his descent.</p>

<p>Down, down, down he went in the pulseless darkness, lower and
lower, until he found himself going through the dizzying air&mdash;to
where?</p>
