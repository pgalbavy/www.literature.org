<p>I passed through the kitchen out to the stable, marking as I
went that the breakfast was ready laid in the sitting room. There
I saddled Saladin, grown sleek by fat living, and rolling his
great eyes at me wonderingly. I tested the joinings, buckled the
girth tight, and led him round to the front of the house, where
I tethered him to a tree and entered the door.</p>

<p>A savory smell of hot meats came from the room and a bright wood
fire drove away the grayness of the morning. Anne stood by the
table, slicing a loaf and looking ever and anon to the entrance.
Her face was pale as if with sleeplessness and weeping. Her hair
was not so daintily arranged as was her wont. It seemed almost
as if she had augured the future. A strange catch&mdash;coming as such
songs do from nowhere and meaning nothing&mdash;ran constantly in my
head. 'Twas one of Philippe Desportes', that very song which the
Duke de Guise sang just before his death. So, as I entered, I
found myself humming half unwittingly:</p>

<p>
"Nous verrons, berg√®re Rosette,<br/>
&nbsp;Qui premier s'en repentira."

</p>

<p>Anne looked up as if startled at my coming, and when she saw
my dress glanced fearfully at my face. It must have told her some
tale, for a red flush mounted to her brow and abode there.</p>

<p>I picked up a loaf from the table. 'Twas my one sacrifice to
the gods of hospitality. 'Twould serve, I thought, for the first
stage in my journey.</p>

<p>Anne looked up at me with a kind of confused wonder. She laughed,
but there was little mirth in her laughter.</p>

<p>"Why, what would you do with the loaf?" said she. "Do you seek
to visit the widows and fatherless in their affliction?"</p>

<p>"Nay," said I gravely. "I would but keep myself unspotted from
the world."</p>

<p>All merriment died out of her face.</p>

<p>"And what would you do?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"The time has come for me to leave, Mistress Anne. My horse is
saddled at the door. I have been here long enough; ay, and too
long. I thank you with all my heart for your kindness, and I would
seek to repay it by ridding you of my company."</p>

<p>I fear I spoke harshly, but 'twas to hide my emotion, which bade
fair to overpower me and ruin all.</p>

<p>"Oh, and why will you go?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Farewell, Anne," I said, looking at her fixedly, and I saw that
she divined the reason.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel, and went out from the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, my love," she cried passionately, "stay with me; stay, oh,
stay!"</p>

<p>Her voice rang in my ear with honeyed sweetness, like that of
the Sirens to Ulysses of old.</p>

<p>"Stay!" she cried, as I flung open the house-door.</p>

<p>I turned me round for one last look at her whom I loved better
than life. She stood at the entrance to the room, with her arms
outstretched and her white bosom heaving. Her eyes were filled
with an utterable longing, which a man may see but once in his
life&mdash;and well for him if he never sees it. Her lips were parted
as if to call me back once more. But no word came; her presence
was more powerful than any cry.</p>

<p>I turned to the weather. A gray sky, a driving mist, and a chill
piercing blast. The contrast was almost more than my resolution.
An irresistible impulse seized me to fly to her arms, to enter
the bright room again with her, and sell myself, body and soul,
to the lady of my heart.</p>

<p>My foot trembled to the step backward, my arms all but felt her
weight, when that blind Fate which orders the ways of men intervened.
Against my inclination and desire, bitterly, unwilling, I strode
to my horse and flung myself on his back. I dared not look behind,
but struck spurs into Saladin and rode out among the trees.</p>

<p>A fierce north wind met me in the teeth, and piercing through
my tatters, sent a shiver to my very heart.</p>

<p>I cannot recall my thoughts during that ride: I seem not to have
thought at all. All I know is that in about an hour there came
into my mind, as from a voice, the words: "Recreant! Fool!" and
I turned back.</p>

<p>=<em>THE PRISONER OF ZENDA</em>.=</p>

<p>By <em>ANTHONY HOPE</em>.</p>

<p>"A glorious story, which cannot be too warmly recommended to
all who love a tale that stirs the blood. Perhaps not the least
among its many good qualities is the fact that its chivalry is
of the nineteenth, not of the sixteenth century; that it is a
tale of brave men and true, and of a fair woman of to-day. The
Englishman who saves the king ... is as interesting a knight as
was Bayard.... The story holds the reader's attention from first
to last."&mdash;<em>Critic.</em></p>

<p>"One of the strongest and most vital characters that have appeared
in our fiction."&mdash;<em>Dial.</em></p>

<p>"Commands our very sincere respect ... there is no glaring improbability
about his story ... the highly dramatic crisis of the story....
The tone and manner of the book are noble.... A timely, manly,
thoroughbred, and eminently suggestive book."&mdash;<em>Atlantic Monthly.</em></p>

<p>"A fine, tender love story."&mdash;<em>Literary World.</em></p>

<p>"The book is sure to excite attention and win popularity."&mdash;<em>Boston

<p>=<em>KAFIR STORIES. </em>By <em>WILLIAM CHARLES SCULLY</em>.=</p>

<p>"He writes of South Africa with the sure knowledge, the sympathy,
and almost with the vigor that Mr. Kipling bestows upon his Hindu
stories.... His strongly picturesque and eventful tale of adventure
and warfare ... there is no false sentiment ... the narrative
of their long march, their triumphs, their betrayal and finally
their brave death is thrilling."&mdash;<em>N. Y. Times.</em></p>

<p>"An extraordinary piece of work.... South Africa may be said
to have her Kipling in him."&mdash;<em>Miss Gilder in N. Y. World.</em></p>

<p>"There is a fascination about them ... unlike any of the hundreds
of volumes of short stories that have been given us during the
past few years."&mdash;<em>Boston Times.</em></p>

<p>=<em>THE MASTER-KNOT AND "ANOTHER STORY." </em>By <em>CONOVER
DUFF</em>.=</p>

<p>Two tales told in letters. The first shows how "the master-knot
of human fate" strangely linked two lovers in a Long Island house
party with a quarry riot in Ohio. The second is full of breezy
humor and describes New York life, uptown, in the park, and at
the opera.</p>

<p>"Happily imagined and neatly worked out ... a high order of work."&mdash;<em>New
York Times.</em></p>

<p>"Whoever has written these stories has a delicate touch and a
keen insight ... very cleverly told indeed, and the uncertainty
is kept up to the last moment ... happy in its strength and delicacy.
Altogether a precious little book, dealing with worldly people,
who can be unconventional and loyal and consistently American."&mdash;<em>Philadelphia
Ledger.</em></p>
