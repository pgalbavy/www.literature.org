<p>In the outer room, Winterset, unable to find Lady Mary, and supposing
her to have joined Lady Rellerton, disposed of his negus, then
approached the two visitors to pay his respects to the young prince,
whom he discovered to be a stripling of seventeen, arrogant looking,
but pretty as a girl. Standing beside the Marquis de Mirepoix&mdash;a
man of quiet bearing&mdash;he was surrounded by a group of the great,
among whom Mr. Nash naturally counted himself. The Beau was felicitating
himself that the foreigners had not arrived a week earlier, in
which case he and Bath would have been detected in a piece of
gross ignorance concerning the French nobility&mdash;making much of
de Mirepoix's ex-barber.</p>

<p>"'Tis a lucky thing that fellow was got out of the way," he ejaculated,
under cover.</p>

<p>"Thank me for it," rejoined Winterset.</p>

<p>An attendant begged Mr. Nash's notice. The head bailiff sent
word that Beaucaire had long since entered the building by a side
door. It was supposed Mr. Nash had known of it, and the Frenchman
was not arrested, as Mr. Molyneux was in his company, and said
he would be answerable for him. Consternation was so plain on
the Beau's trained face that the Duke leaned toward him anxiously.</p>

<p>"The villain's in, and Molyneux hath gone mad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Bantison, who had been fiercely elbowing his way toward them,
joined heads with them. "You may well say he is in," he exclaimed
"and if you want to know where, why, in yonder card-room. I saw
him through the half-open door."</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" asked the Beau.</p>

<p>"Send the bailiffs&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fie, fie! A file of bailiffs? The scandal!"</p>

<p>"Then listen to me," said the Duke. "I'll select half-a-dozen
gentlemen, explain the matter, and we'll put him in the center
of us and take him out to the bailiffs. 'Twill appear nothing.
Do you remain here and keep the attention of Beaujolais and de
Mirepoix. Come, Bantison, fetch Townbrake and Harry Rakell yonder;
I'll bring the others."</p>

<p>Three minutes later, his Grace of Winterset flung wide the card-room
door, and, after his friends had entered, closed it.</p>

<p>"Ah!" remarked M. Beaucaire quietly. "Six more large men."</p>

<p>The Duke, seeing Lady Mary, started; but the angry signs of her
interview had not left her face, and reassured him. He offered
his hand to conduct her to the door. "May I have the honor?"</p>

<p>"If this is to be known, 'twill be better if I leave after; I
should be observed if I went now."</p>

<p>"As you will, madam," he answered, not displeased. "And now,
you impudent villain," he began, turning to M. Beaucaire, but
to fall back astounded. "'Od's blood, the dog hath murdered and
robbed some royal prince!" He forgot Lady Mary's presence in his
excitement. "Lay hands on him!" he shouted. "Tear those orders
from him!"</p>

<p>Molyneux threw himself between. "One word!" he cried. "One word
before you offer an outrage you will repent all your lives!"</p>

<p>"Or let M. de Winterset come alone," laughed M. Beaucaire.</p>

<p>"Do you expect me to fight a cut-throat barber, and with bare
hands?"</p>

<p>"I think one does not expec' monsieur to fight anybody. Would
I fight you, you think? That was why I had my servants, that evening
we play. I would gladly fight almos' any one in the won'; but
I did not wish to soil my hand with a&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stuff his lying mouth with his orders!" shouted the Duke.</p>

<p>But Molyneux still held the gentlemen back. "One moment," he
cried.</p>

<p>"M. de Winterset," said Beaucaire, "of what are you afraid? You
calculate well. Beaucaire might have been belief&mdash;an impostor
that you yourself expose'? Never! But I was not goin' reveal that
secret. You have not absolve me of my promise."</p>

<p>"Tell what you like," answered the Duke. "Tell all the wild lies
you have time for. You have five minutes to make up your mind
to go quietly."</p>

<p>"Now you absolve me, then? Ha, ha! Oh, yes! Mademoiselle," he
bowed to Lady Mary, "I have the honor to reques' you leave the
room. You shall miss no details if these frien's of yours kill
me, on the honor of a French gentleman."</p>

<p>"A French what?" laughed Bantison.</p>

<p>"Do you dare keep up the pretense?" cried Lord Town brake. "Know,
you villain barber, that your master, the Marquis de Mirepoix,
is in the next room."</p>

<p>Molyneux heaved a great sigh of relief. "Shall <em>I&mdash;" </em>He
turned to M. Beaucaire.</p>

<p>The young man laughed, and said: "Tell him come here at once.</p>

<p>"Impudent to the last!" cried Bantison, as Molyneux hurried from
the room.</p>

<p>"Now you goin' to see M. Beaucaire's master," said Beaucaire
to Lady Mary. "'Tis true what I say, the other night. I cross
from Prance in his suite; my passport say as his barber. Then
to pass the ennui of exile, I come to Bath and play for what one
will. It kill the time. But when the people hear I have been a
servant they come only secretly; and there is one of them&mdash;he
has absolve' me of a promise not to speak&mdash;of him I learn something
he cannot wish to be tol'. I make some trouble to learn this thing.
Why I should do this? Well&mdash;that is my own rizzon. So I make this
man help me in a masque, the unmasking it was, for, as there is
no one to know me, I throw off my black wig and become myself&mdash;and
so I am 'Chateaurien,' Castle Nowhere. Then this man I use', this
Winterset, he&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have great need to deny these accusations?" said the Duke.</p>

<p>"Nay," said Lady Mary wearily.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you why I mus' be 'Victor' and 'Beaucaire' and
'Chateaurien,' and not myself?"</p>

<p>"To escape from the bailiffs for debts for razors and soap,"
gibed Lord Townbrake.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur. In France I have got a cousin who is a man with
a very bad temper at some time', and he will never enjoy his relatives
to do what he does not wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a loud commotion from without. The door
was flung open, and the young Count of Beaujolais bounded in and
threw his arms about the neck of M. Beaucaire.</p>

<p>"Philippe!" he cried. "My brother, I have come to take you back
with me."</p>

<p>M. de Mirepoix followed him, bowing as a courtier, in deference;
but M. Beaucaire took both his hands heartily. Molyneux came after,
with Mr. Nash, and closed the door.</p>

<p>"My warmest felicitations," said the Marquis. "There is no longer
need for your incognito."</p>

<p>"Thou best of masters!" said Beaucaire, touching him fondly on
the shoulder. "I know. Your courier came safely. And so I am forgiven!
But I forget." He turned to the lady. She had begun to tremble
exceedingly. "Faires' of all the English fair," he said, as the
gentlemen bowed low to her deep courtesy, "I beg the honor to
presen' to Lady Mary Carlisle, M. le Comte de Beaujolais. M. de
Mirepoix has already the honor. Lady Mary has been very kind to
me, my frien's; you mus' help me make my acknowledgment. Mademoiselle
and gentlemen, will you give me that favour to detain you one
instan'?"</p>

<p>"Henri," he turned to the young Beaujolais, "I wish you had shared
my masque &mdash;I have been so gay!" The surface of his tone
was merry, but there was an undercurrent, weary&mdash;sad, to speak
of what was the mood, not the manner. He made the effect of addressing
every one present, but he looked steadily at Lady Mary. Her eyes
were fixed upon him, with a silent and frightened fascination,
and she trembled more and more. "I am a great actor, Henri. These
gentlemen are yet scarce convince' I am not a lackey! And I mus'
tell you that I was jus' now to be expelled for having been a
barber!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" the ambassador cried out. "He would not be content
with me; he would wander over a strange country."</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, my Mirepoix! And what is better, one evening I am oblige'
to fight some frien's of M. de Winterset there, and some ladies
and cavaliers look on, and they still think me a servant. Oh,
I am a great actor! 'Tis true there is not a peasant in France
who would not have then known one 'born'; but they are wonderful,
this English people, holding by an idea once it is in their heads&mdash;a
mos' worthy quality. But my good Molyneux here, he had speak to
me with courtesy, jus' because I am a man an' jus' because he
is always kind. (I have learn' that his great-grandfather was
a Frenchman.) So I sen' to him and tell him ev'rything, and he
gain admittance for me here to-night to await my frien's.</p>

<p>"I was speaking to messieurs about my cousin, who will meddle
in the affair' of his relatives. Well, that gentleman, he make
a marriage for me with a good and accomplish' lady, very noble
and very beautiful&mdash;and amiable." (The young count at his elbow
started slightly at this, but immediately appeared to wrap himself
in a mantle of solemn thought.) "Unfortunately, when my cousin
arrange' so, I was a dolt, a little blockhead; I swear to marry
for myself and when I please, or never if I like. That lady is
all things charming and gentle, and, in truth, she is&mdash;very much
attach' to me&mdash;why should I not say it? I am so proud of it. She
is very faithful and forgiving and sweet; she would be the same,
I think, if <em>I&mdash;</em>were even&mdash;a lackey. But I? I was a dolt,
a little unsensible brute; I did not value such thing' then; I
was too yo'ng, las' June. So I say to my cousin, 'No, I make my
own choosing!' 'Little fool,' he answer, 'she is the one for you.
Am I not wiser than you?' And he was very angry, and, as he has
influence in France, word come' that he will get me put in Vincennes,
so I mus' run away quick till his anger is gone. My good frien'
Mirepoix is jus' leaving for London; he take' many risk' for my
sake; his hairdresser die before he start', so I travel as that
poor barber. But my cousin is a man to be afraid of when he is
angry, even in England, and I mus' not get my Mirepoix in trouble.
I mus' not be discover' till my cousin is ready to laugh about
it all and make it a joke. And there may be spies; so I change
my name again, and come to Bath to amuse my retreat with a little
gaming &mdash;I am always fond of that. But three day' ago M.
le Marquis send me a courier to say that my brother, who know
where I had run away, is come from France to say that my cousin
is appease'; he need me for his little theatre, the play cannot
go on. I do not need to espouse mademoiselle. All shall be forgiven
if I return, and my brother and M. de Mirepoix will meet me in
Bath to felicitate.</p>

<p>"There is one more thing to say, that is all. I have said I learn'
a secret, and use it to make a man introduce me if I will not
tell. He has absolve' me of that promise. My frien's, I had not
the wish to ruin that man. I was not receive'; Meestaire Nash
had reboff me; I had no other way excep' to use this fellow. So
I say, 'Take me to Lady Malbourne's ball as "Chateaurien."' I
throw off my wig, and shave, and behol', I am M. le Duc de Castle
Nowhere. Ha, ha! You see?"</p>

<p>The young man's manner suddenly changed. He became haughty, menacing.
He stretched out his arm, and pointed at Winterset. "Now I am
no 'Beaucaire,' messieurs. I am a French gentleman. The man who
introduce' me at the price of his honor, and then betray' me to
redeem it, is that coward, that card-cheat there!"</p>

<p>Winterset made a horrible effort to laugh. The gentlemen who
surrounded him fell away as from pestilence. "A French gentleman!"
he sneered savagely, and yet fearfully. "I don't know who you
are. Hide behind as many toys and ribbons as you like; I'll know
the name of the man who dares bring such a charge!"</p>

<p>"Sir!" cried de Mirepoix sharply, advancing a step towards him;
but he checked himself at once. He made a low bow of state, first
to the young Frenchman, then to Lady Mary and the company. "Permit
me, Lady Mary and gentlemen," he said, "to assume the honor of
presenting you to His Highness, Prince Louis-Philippe de Valois,
Duke of Orleans, Duke of Chartres, Duke of Nemours, Duke of Montpeti'sier,
First Prince of the Blood Royal, First Peer of France, Lieutenant-General
of French Infantry, Governor of Dauphine, Knight of the Golden
Fleece, Grand Master of the Order of Notre Dame, of Mount Carmel,
and of St. Lazarus in Jerusalem; and cousin to His most Christian
Majesty, Louis the Fifteenth, King of France."</p>

<p>"Those are a few of my brother's names," whispered Henri of Beaujolais
to Molyneux. "Old Mirepoix has the long breath, but it take' a
strong man two day' to say all of them. I can suppose this Winterset
know' now who bring the charge!"</p>

<p>"Castle Nowhere!" gasped Beau Nash, falling back upon the burly
prop of Mr. Bantison's shoulder.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Orleans will receive a message from me within the
hour!"  said Winterset, as he made his way to the door. His face
was black with rage and shame.</p>

<p>"I tol' you that I would not soil my hand with you," answered
the young man. "If you send a message no gentleman will bring
it. Whoever shall bear it will receive a little beating from Francois."</p>

<p>He stepped to Lady Mary's side. Her head was bent low, her face
averted. She seemed to breathe with difficulty, and leaned heavily
upon a chair. "Monseigneur," she faltered in a half whisper, "can
you&mdash;forgive me? It is a bitter&mdash;mistake-I have made. Forgive."</p>

<p>"Forgive?" he answered, and his voice was as broken as hers;
but he went on, more firmly: "It is&mdash;nothing&mdash;less than nothing.
There is&mdash;only jus' one&mdash;in the&mdash;whole worl' who would not have
treat' me the way that you treat' me. It is to her that I am goin'
to make reparation. You know something, Henri? I am not goin'
back only because the king forgive' me. I am goin' to please him;
I am goin' to espouse mademoiselle, our cousin. My frien's, I
ask your felicitations."</p>

<p>"And the king does not compel him!" exclaimed young Henri.</p>

<p>"Henri, you want to fight me?" cried his brother sharply. "Don'
you think the King of France is a wiser man than me?"</p>

<p>He offered his hand to Lady Mary. "Mademoiselle is fatigue'.
Will she honor me?"</p>

<p>He walked with her to the door. Her hand fluttering faintly in
his. From somewhere about the garments of one of them a little
cloud of faded rose-leaves fell, and lay strewn on the floor behind
them. He opened the door, and the lights shone on a multitude
of eager faces turned toward it. There was a great hum of voices,
and, over all, the fiddles wove a wandering air, a sweet French
song of the voyageur.</p>

<p>He bowed very low, as, with fixed and glistening eyes, Lady Mary
Carlisle, the Beauty of Bath, passed slowly by him and went out
of the room.</p>
