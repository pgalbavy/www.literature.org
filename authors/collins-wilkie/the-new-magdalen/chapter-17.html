<P>
"You were here when I fainted, were you not?" Mercy began. "You
must think me a sad coward, even for a woman."
<P>
He shook his head. "I am far from thinking that, "he replied. "No
courage could have sustained the shock which fell on you. I don't
wonder that you fainted. I don't wonder that you have been ill."
<P>
She paused in rolling up the ball of wool. What did those words
of unexpected sympathy mean? Was he laying a trap for her? Urged
by that serious doubt, she questioned him more boldly.
<P>
"Horace tells me you have been abroad," she said. "Did you enjoy
your holiday?"
<P>
"It was no holiday. I went abroad because I thought it right to
make certain inquiries--" He stopped there, unwilling to return
to a subject that  was painful to her.
<P>
Her v oice sank, her fingers trembled round the ball of wool; but
she managed to go on.
<P>
"Did you arrive at any results?" she asked.
<P>
"At no results worth mentioning."
<P>
The caution of that reply renewed her worst suspicions of him. In
sheer despair, she spoke out plainly.
<P>
"I want to know your opinion--" she began.
<P>
"Gently!" said Julian. "You are entangling the wool again."
<P>
"I want to know your opinion of the person who so terribly
frightened me. Do you think her--"
<P>
"Do I think her--what?"
<P>
"Do you think her an adventuress?"
<P>
(As she said those words the branches of a shrub in the
conservatory were noiselessly parted by a hand in a black glove.
The face of Grace Roseberry appeared dimly behind the leaves.
Undiscovered, she had escaped from the billiard-room, and had
stolen her way into the conservatory as the safer hiding-place of
the two. Behind the shrub she could see as well as listen. Behind
the shrub she waited as patiently as ever.)
<P>
"I take a more merciful view," Julian answered. "I believe she is
acting under a delusion. I don't blame her: I pity her."
<P>
"You pity her?" As Mercy repeated the words, she tore off
Julian's hands the last few lengths of wool left, and threw the
imperfectly wound skein back into the basket. "Does that mean,"
she resumed, abruptly, "that you believe her?"
<P>
Julian rose from his seat, and looked at Mercy in astonishment.
<P>
"Good heavens, Miss Roseberry! what put such an idea as that into
your head?"
<P>
"I am little better than a stranger to you," she rejoined, with
an effort to assume a jesting tone. "You met that person before
you met with me. It is not so very far from pitying her to
believing her. How could I feel sure that you might not suspect
me?"
<P>
"Suspect _you!_" he exclaimed. "You don't know how you distress,
how you shock me. Suspect _you!_ The bare idea of it never
entered my mind. The man doesn't live who trusts you more
implicitly, who believes in you more devotedly, than I do."
<P>
His eyes, his voice, his manner, all told her that those words
came from the heart. She contrasted his generous confidence in
her (the confidence of which she was unworthy) with her
ungracious distrust of him. Not only had she wronged Grace
Roseberry--she had wronged Julian Gray. Could she deceive him as
she had deceived the others? Could she meanly accept that
implicit trust, that devoted belief? Never had she felt the base
submissions which her own imposture condemned her to undergo with
a loathing of them so overwhelming as the loathing that she felt
now. In horror of herself, she turned her head aside in silence
and shrank from meeting his eye. He noticed the movement, placing
his own interpretation on it. Advancing closer, he asked
anxiously if he had offended her.
<P>
"You don't know how your confidence touches me," she said,
without looking up. "You little think how keenly I feel your
kindness."
<P>
She checked herself abruptly. Her fine tact warned her that she
was speaking too warmly--that the expression of her gratitude
might strike him as being strangely exaggerated. She handed him
her work-basket before he could speak again.
<P>
"Will you put it away for me?" she asked, in her quieter tones.
"I don't feel able to work just now."
<P>
His back was turned on her for a moment, while he placed the
basket on a side-table. In that moment her mind advanced at a
bound from present to future. Accident might one day put the true
Grace in possession of the proofs that she needed, and might
reveal the false Grace to him in the identity that was her own.
What would he think of her then? Could she make him tell her
without betraying herself? She determined to try.
<P>
"Children are notoriously insatiable if you once answer their
questions, and women are nearly as bad," she said, when Julian
returned to her. "Will your patience hold out if I go back for
the third time to the person whom we have been speaking of?"
<P>
"Try me," he answered, with a smile.
<P>
"Suppose you had _not_ taken your merciful view of her?"
<P>
"Yes?"
<P>
"Suppose you believed that she was wickedly bent on deceiving
others for a purpose of her own--would you not shrink from such a
woman in horror and disgust?"
<P>
"God forbid that I should shrink from any human creature!" he
answered, earnestly. "Who among us has a right to do that?"
<P>
She hardly dared trust herself to believe him. "You would still
pity her?" she persisted, "and still feel for her?"
<P>
"With all my heart."
<P>
"Oh, how good you are!"
<P>
He held up his hand in warning. The tones of his voice deepened,
the luster of his eyes brightened. She had stirred in the depths
of that great heart the faith in which the man lived--the steady
principle which guided his modest and noble life.
<P>
"No!" he cried. "Don't say that! Say that I try to love my
neighbor as myself. Who but a Pharisee can believe that he is
better than another? The best among us to-day may, but for the
mercy of God, be the worst among us tomorrow. The true Christian
virtue is the virtue which never despairs of a fellow-creature.
The true Christian faith believes in Man as well as in God. Frail
and fallen as we are, we can rise on the wings of repentance from
earth to heaven. Humanity is sacred. Humanity has its immortal
destiny. Who shall dare say to man or woman, 'There is no hope in
you?' Who shall dare say the work is all vile, when that work
bears on it the stamp of the Creator's hand?"
<P>
He turned away for a moment, struggling with the emotion which
she had roused in him.
<P>
Her eyes, as they followed him, lighted with a momentary
enthusiasm--then sank wearily in the vain regret which comes too
late. Ah! if he could have been her friend and her adviser on the
fatal day when she first turned her steps toward Mablethorpe
House! She sighed bitterly as the hopeless aspiration wrung her
heart. He heard the sigh; and, turning again, looked at her with
a new interest in his face.
<P>
"Miss Roseberry," he said.
<P>
She was still absorbed in the bitter memories of the past: she
failed to hear him.
<P>
"Miss Roseberry," he repeated, approaching her.
<P>
She looked up at him with a start.
<P>
"May I venture to ask you something?" he said, gently.
<P>
She shrank at the question.
<P>
"Don't suppose I am speaking out of mere curiosity," he went on.
"And pray don't answer me unless you can answer without betraying
any confidence which may have been placed in you."
<P>
"Confidence!" she repeated. "What confidence do you mean?"
<P>
"It has just struck me that you might have felt more than a
common interest in the questions which you put to me a moment
since," he answered. "Were you by any chance speaking of some
unhappy woman--not the person who frightened you, of course--but
of some other woman whom you know?"
<P>
Her head sank slowly on her bosom. He had plainly no suspicion
that she had been speaking of herself: his tone and manner both
answered for it that his belief in her was as strong as ever.
Still those last words made her tremble; she could not trust
herself to reply to them.
<P>
He accepted the bending of her head as a reply.
<P>
"Are you interested in her?" he asked next.
<P>
She faintly answered this time. "Yes."
<P>
"Have you encouraged her?"
<P>
"I have not dared to encourage her."
<P>
His face lighted up suddenly with enthusiasm. "Go to her," he
said, "and let me go with you and help you!"
<P>
The answer came faintly and mournfully. "She has sunk too low for
that!"
<P>
He interrupted her with a gesture of impatience.
<P>
"What has she done?" he asked.
<P>
"She has deceived--basely deceived--innocent people who trusted
her. She has wronged--cruelly wronged--another woman."
<P>
For the first time Julian seated himself at her side. The
interest that was now roused in him was an interest above
reproach. He could speak to Mercy without restraint; he could
look at Mercy with a pure heart.
<P>
"You judge her very harshly," he said. "Do _you_ know how she may
have been tried and tempted?"
<P>
There was no answer.
<P>
"Tell me," he went on, "is the person whom she has injured still
living?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"If the person is still living, she may atone for the wrong. The
time may come when this sinner, too, may win our pardon and
deserve our respect."
<P>
"Could _you_ respect her?" Mercy asked, sadly. "Can such a mind
as yours understand what she has gone t hrough?"
<P>
A smile, kind and momentary, brightened his attentive face.
<P>
"You forget my melancholy experience," he answered. "Young as I
am, I have seen more than most men of women who have sinned and
suffered. Even after the little that you have told me, I think I
can put myself in her place. I can well understand, for instance,
that she may have been tempted beyond human resistance. Am I
right?"
<P>
"You are right."
<P>
"She may have had nobody near at the time to advise her, to warn
her, to save her. Is that true?"
<P>
"It is true."
<P>
"Tempted and friendless, self-abandoned to the evil impulse of
the moment, this woman may have committed herself headlong to the
act which she now vainly repents. She may long to make atonement,
and may not know how to begin. All her energies may be crushed
under the despair and horror of herself, out of which the truest
repentance grows. Is such a woman as this all wicked, all vile? I
deny it! She may have a noble nature; and she may show it nobly
yet. Give her the opportunity she needs, and our poor fallen
fellow-creature may take her place again among the best of
us--honored, blameless, happy, once more!"
<P>
Mercy's eyes, resting eagerly on him while he was speaking,
dropped again despondingly when he had done.
<P>
"There is no such future as that," she answered, "for the woman
whom I am thinking of. She has lost her opportunity. She has done
with hope."
<P>
Julian gravely considered with himself for a moment.
<P>
"Let us understand each other," he said. "She has committed an
act of deception to the injury of another woman. Was that what
you told me?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"And she has gained something to her own advantage by the act."
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Is she threatened with discovery?"
<P>
"She is safe from discovery--for the present, at least."
<P>
"Safe as long as she closes her lips?"
<P>
"As long as she closes her lips."
<P>
"There is her opportunity!" cried Julian. "Her future is before
her. She has not done with hope!"
<P>
With clasped hands, in breathless suspense, Mercy looked at that
inspiriting face, and listened to those golden words.
<P>
"Explain yourself," she said. "Tell her, through me, what she
must do."
<P>
"Let her own the truth," answered Julian, "without the base fear
of discovery to drive her to it. Let her do justice to the woman
whom she has wronged, while that woman is still powerless to
expose her. Let her sacrifice everything that she has gained by
the fraud to the sacred duty of atonement. If she can do
that--for conscience' sake, and for pity's sake--to her own
prejudice, to her own shame, to her own loss--then her repentance
has nobly revealed the noble nature that is in her; then she is a
woman to be trusted, respected, beloved! If I saw the Pharisees
and fanatics of this lower earth passing her by in contempt, I
would hold out my hand to her before them all. I would say to her
in her solitude and her affliction, 'Rise, poor wounded heart!
Beautiful, purified soul, God's angels rejoice over you! Take
your place among the noblest of God's creatures!'"
<P>
In those last sentences he unconsciously repeated the language in
which he had spoken, years since, to his congregation in the
chapel of the Refuge. With tenfold power and tenfold persuasion
they now found their way again to Mercy's heart. Softly,
suddenly, mysteriously, a change passed over her. Her troubled
face grew beautifully still. The shifting light of terror and
suspense vanished from her grand gray eyes, and left in them the
steady inner glow of a high and pure resolve.
<P>
There was a moment of silence between them. They both had need of
silence. Julian was the first to speak again.
<P>
"Have I satisfied you that her opportunity is still before her?"
he asked. "Do you feel, as I feel, that she has _not_ done with
hope?"
<P>
"You have satisfied me that the world holds no truer friend to
her than you," Mercy answered, gently and gratefully. "She shall
prove herself worthy of your generous confidence in her. She
shall show you yet that you have not spoken in vain."
<P>
Still inevitably failing to understand her, he led the way to the
door.
<P>
"Don't waste the precious time," he said. "Don't leave her
cruelly to herself. If you can't go to her, let me go as your
messenger, in your place."
<P>
She stopped him by a gesture. He took a step back into the room,
and paused, observing with surprise that she made no attempt to
move from the chair that she occupied.
<P>
"Stay here," she said to him, in suddenly altered tones.
<P>
"Pardon me, "he rejoined, "I don't understand you."
<P>
"You will understand me directly. Give me a little time."
<P>
He still lingered near the door, with his eyes fixed inquiringly
on her. A man of a lower nature than his, or a man believing in
Mercy less devotedly than he believed, would now have felt his
first suspicion of her. Julian was as far as ever from suspecting
her, even yet. "Do you wish to be alone?" he asked,
considerately. "Shall I leave you for a while and return again?"
<P>
She looked up with a start of terror. "Leave me?" she repeated,
and suddenly checked herself on the point of saying more. Nearly
half the length of the room divided them from each other. The
words which she was longing to say were words that would never
pass her lips unless she could see some encouragement in his
face. "No!" she cried out to him, on a sudden, in her sore need,
"don't leave me! Come back to me!"
<P>
He obeyed her in silence. In silence, on her side, she pointed to
the chair near her. He took it. She looked at him, and checked
herself again; resolute to make her terrible confession, yet
still hesitating how to begin. Her woman's instinct whispered to
her, "Find courage in his touch!" She said to him, simply and
artlessly said to him, "Give me encouragement. Give me strength.
Let me take your hand." He neither answered nor moved. His mind
seemed to have become suddenly preoccupied; his eyes rested on
her vacantly. He was on the brink of discovering her secret; in
another instant he would have found his way to the truth. In that
instant, innocently as his sister might have taken it, she took
his hand. The soft clasp of her fingers, clinging round his,
roused his senses, fired his passion for her, swept out of his
mind the pure aspirations which had filled it but the moment
before, paralyzed his perception when it was just penetrating the
mystery of her disturbed manner and her strange words. All the
man in him trembled under the rapture of her touch. But the
thought of Horace was still present to him: his hand lay passive
in hers; his eyes looked uneasily away from her.
<P>
She innocently strengthened her clasp of his hand. She innocently
said to him, "Don't look away from me. Your eyes give me
courage."
<P>
His hand returned the pressure of hers. He tasted to the full the
delicious joy of looking at her. She had broken down his last
reserves of self-control. The thought of Horace, the sense of
honor, became obscured in him. In a moment more he might have
said the words which he would have deplored for the rest of his
life, if she had not stopped him by speaking first. "I have more
to say to you," she resumed abruptly, feeling the animating
resolution to lay her heart bare before him at last; "more, far
more, than I have said yet. Generous, merciful friend, let me say
it _here!_"
<P>
She attempted to throw herself on her knees at his feet. He
sprung from his seat and checked her, holding her with both his
hands, raising her as he rose himself. In the words which had
just escaped her, in the startling action which had accompanied
them, the truth burst on him. The guilty woman she had spoken of
was herself!
<P>
While she was almost in his arms, while her bosom was just
touching his, before a word more had passed his lips or hers, the
library door opened.
<P>
Lady Janet Roy entered the room.
