<p>The horror-stricken Terry thought no more about his wife, whom
he was in the act of lifting through the trap-door, but let go
her hand, allowing her to drop with a crash that shook the whole
building.</p>

<p>"Where is the child?" he asked, facing the elder daughter.</p>

<p>"Yonder; I was trying to hold her when she slipped away and rolled
down the slope of the roof—"</p>

<p>But the father waited to hear no more. Just then the cry of his
baby reached his ear, and he caught a glimpse of the white clothing
which helped to buoy her up. Like an athlete, running along a
spring-board to gather momentum for his tremendous leap, he took
a couple of steps down the incline of the roof to the edge, from
which he made a tremendous bound far out in the muddy torrent.</p>

<p>It was the energy of desperation and the delirium of paternal
affection itself which carried him for a long way over the water,
so that when he struck, one extended arm seized the shoulder of
his child, while the other sustained both from sinking.</p>

<p>Poor Katie, who had been gasping for breath, now began crying,
and the sound was welcome to the parent, for it proved that she
was alive. Had she been quiet he would have believed she was drowned.</p>

<p>The trees which grew so thickly in the little valley served another
good purpose in addition to that already named. The most powerful
swimmer that ever lived could not make headway against such a
torrent, nor indeed hold his own for a moment.</p>

<p>Terry would have been quickly swept beyond sight and sound of
the rest of his family had he not grasped a strong, protruding
limb by which he checked his progress.</p>

<p>"Are ye there, Terry?"</p>

<p>It was his wife who called. She had heard the frenzied cry of
the elder girl at the moment she went downward herself with such
a resounding crash. She was as frantic as her husband, and did
that which would have been impossible at any other time. Grasping
the sides of the trap-door, she drew herself upward and through
with as much deftness as her husband a few minutes before. She
asked the agonized question at the moment her head and shoulders
appeared above the roof.</p>

<p>"Yis, I’m here, Delia," he called back, "and Katie is wid me."</p>

<p>"Hiven be praised!" was the fervent response of the wife; "I
don’t care now if the owld shanty is knocked into smithereens."</p>

<p>The speech was worthy of an Irishwoman, who never thought of
her own inevitable fate in case the catastrophe named should overtake
her dwelling while she was on the roof. She could dimly discern
the figures of her husband and child, as the former clung to the
friendly limb.</p>

<p>"If yer faat are risting so gintaaly on the ground," said the
wife, who supposed for the moment he was standing on the earth
and grasping the branch to steady himself, "why doesn’t ye walk
forward and jine us?"</p>

<p>"If my faat are risting on the ground!" repeated Terry: "and
if I were doing the same, I would be as tall as a maating-house
wid the staaple thrown in."</p>

<p>"Thin would ye loike to have us join <em>ye</em>?" persisted
the wife.</p>

<p>"Arrah, Delia, now are ye gone clean crazy, that ye talks in
that style? Stay where ye be, and I would be thankful if I could
get back to ye, which the same I can’t do."</p>

<p>The wife had been so flustered that her questions were a little
mixed, but by the time she was fairly seated on the roof, with
one arm encircling Maggie, who clung, frightened and crying, to
her, she began to realize her situation.</p>

<p>"Terry," she called again, "are ye not comfortable?"</p>

<p>"Wal, yis," replied the fellow, whose waggery must show itself,
now that he believed the entire family were safe from the flood,
"I faals as comfortable, thank ye, as if I was standing on me
head on the top of a barber’s pole. How is it wid yerself, me
jewel?"</p>

<p>"I’m thankful for the blissing of our lives; but why don’t ye
climb into the traa and take a seat?"</p>

<p>"I will do so in a few minutes."</p>

<p>There was good ground for this promise. Although Terry had been
sustaining himself only a brief while, he felt the water rising
so rapidly that the crown of his head, which was several inches
below the supporting limb, quickly touched it, and as he shifted
his position slightly it ascended still farther. While sustaining
his child he could not lift both over the branch, but, with the
help of the current, would soon be able to do so.</p>

<p>Requesting his wife to hold her peace for the moment, he seized
the opportunity the instant it presented itself, and with comparatively
little outlay of strength, placed himself astride the branch.
This was all well enough, provided the flood did not keep on ascending,
but it was doing that very thing, and his perch must speedily
become untenable.</p>

<p>His refuge, however, was a sturdy oak, whose top was fully twenty
feet above him, and, like its kind, was abundantly supplied with
strong branches, so near each other that it was not difficult
for the father to climb to a safe point, where he was confident
the furious waters could never reach him.</p>

<p>Having seated himself in a better position than before, he surveyed
his surroundings with some degree of composure.</p>

<p>"Delia," he called, "I obsarve ye are there yit."</p>

<p>"I’m thankful that yer words are the thruth, and if ye kaap on
climbing ye’ll be in the clouds by morning."</p>

<p>Now, while the rising torrent had proven of great assistance
in one way to Terry and his infant child, it threatened a still
graver peril to the mother and Maggie, who remained on the roof.</p>

<p>The house, being of wood, was liable to be lifted from its foundations
and carried in sections down-stream. In that event it would seem
that nothing could save the couple from immediate drowning.</p>

<p>Neither the husband nor wife thought of this calamity until she
called out, under the stress of her new fear:</p>

<p>"Terry, the owld building can’t stand this."</p>

<p>"What do ye maan, me darling?"</p>

<p>"I faal it moving under me as though its getting onaisy—oh! <em>we’re
afloat</em>!"</p>

<p>The exclamation was true. The little structure, after resisting
the giant tugging at it as though it were a sentient thing, yielded
when it could hold out no longer. It popped up a foot or two like
a cork, as if to recover its gravity, and the next moment started
down the torrent.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that Terry uttered the despairing cry
which brought Dick Halliard and Jim McGovern hurrying to the spot
on the shore directly opposite.</p>

<p>But unexpected good fortune attended the shifting of the little
building from its foundations. Swinging partly around, it drifted
against the tree in which Terry had taken refuge with his child.
His wife and Maggie were so near that he could touch them with
his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Climb into the limbs," he said, "for the owld shebang will soon
go to pieces."</p>

<p>He could give little help, since he had to keep one arm about
Katie, but the wife was cool and collected, now that she fully
comprehended her danger. The projecting limbs were within convenient
reach, and it took her but a minute or two to ensconce herself
beside her husband and other child.</p>

<p>Quick as was the action it was not a moment too soon, for she
was hardly on her perch and safely established by the side of
all that was dear to her when the house broke into a dozen fragments,
the roof itself disintegrating, and every portion quickly vanished
among the tree-tops in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Helloa, Terry, are you alive?" called Dick Halliard.</p>

<p>"We’re all alive, Hiven be praised!" replied the Irishman, "and
are roosting among the tree-tops."</p>

<p>"It will be all right with you then," was the cheery response,
"for I don’t think the flood will rise any higher."</p>

<p>"Little odds if it does, for we haven’t raiched the top story
of our new risidence yit."</p>

<p>Just then a dark object struck the ground at the feet of the
boys, swinging around like a log of wood. Seeing what it was,
Dick Halliard stooped down and drew it out of the current.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked McGovern, in a whisper, seeing as he spoke
that it was a human body. "Great Heavens! it is Tom Wagstaff!"</p>

<p>"So it is," replied Dick, "and he is dead."</p>

<p>"And so is Bobb Budd!"</p>
