<p>Lieutenant Russell was treading on delicate ground, where the
utmost caution was necessary. He must not alarm his friend. He
smoked a few minutes in silence.</p>

<p>"It is not for me to give counsel to my captain, but is it not
a fact that selfishness grows upon us with advancing years?"</p>

<p>"Very likely."</p>

<p>"Has it occurred to you that in concluding to pass the remainder
of your days in this mining settlement, you are thinking more
of yourself than of your child?"</p>

<p>"What have I said that warrants that question?" asked the captain
sharply.</p>

<p>"No higher motive than to protect a daughter from harm can inspire
a father, but if she should be allowed to close your eyes, when
you come to lie down and die, it will be hers to live: what <em>then</em>?"</p>

<p>"I shall leave her comfortably provided for. My pay amounted
to a goodly sum when the war ended, and it is placed where no
one else can reap the benefit of it. Then, too, as you know we
have struck considerable paying dirt of late. The prospects are
that New Constantinople, even if a small town, will soon be a
rich one."</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell groaned in spirit. Would the parent never
understand him?</p>

<p>"Then you expect her to remain here, sharing in all the vicissitudes
of the place? It cannot always stand still; it will either increase,
bringing with it many bad elements, or it will cease to exist
and these people will have to go elsewhere: what then of the child
whom you have left behind you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, by that time," airily replied the father; "she will be married
to some good honest fellow, like the parson, who seems to be fond
of her, as I know she is of him, but I will not allow her to think
of marriage for a long while to come," he added with emphasis.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Russell had heard all he wished. He had learned that
the father would not consent to the marriage of his daughter for
a number of years, and when that time came, he would select one
of the shaggy, uncouth miners for her life partner.</p>

<p>"He has never thought of <em>me</em> in that capacity, but he
will have to entertain the thought before he is much older."</p>

<p>In her dreamings of the mysterious world, with its teeming multitudes
and all manner of men, Nellie Dawson was sure that none lived
who could compare with this young cavalier who had come out from
that wonderful realm into the loneliness of her mountain home,
bringing with him a sunshine, a glow, a radiance, a happiness,
and a thrilling life which she had never believed could be hers.</p>

<p>She often sat with her eyes upon his countenance, when, in his
chair opposite her father, he recalled those marvelous experiences
of his. To her no man could ever possess so musical a voice, and
none so perfect features and winning ways. It was young love's
dream and in her heart the sacred flame was kindled and fanned
until her whole being was suffused and glowed with the new life.</p>

<p>One of Lieutenant Russell's firsts acts of kindness to Nellie
Dawson was to present her with his massive dog Timon. She had
shown great admiration from the first for the magnificent brute,
who became fond of her. The maiden was delighted beyond measure
and thanked the donor so effusively that he was embarrassed. It
is not probable, however, that Timon himself was ever aware of
the change of ownership, for it brought no change of conditions
to him. He had learned to divide his time about equally between
the home of the lieutenant and that of Captain Dawson, while,
like the young lady herself, he wandered about the settlement
at will. He was a dignified canine, who stalked solemnly through
New Constantinople, or took a turn in Dead Man's Gulch, resenting
all familiarity from every one, except from the only two persons
that had ever owned him.</p>

<p>The lieutenant reflected much upon his conversation with Captain
Dawson, the impression which he had received being anything but
pleasant. "He considers himself unselfish, and yet like all such
he is selfishness itself. He has determined to spend the rest
of his days in this hole and to keep her with him. He won't allow
her to marry for years, because it might interfere with his own
pleasure; then he intends to turn her over to that lank, shaggy-faced
Brush, who pretends to be a parson. The captain never thinks of
<em>me</em> as having any claims upon her love. To carry out his
plan would be a crime. If she objects to Brush, he will probably
give her a choice from the whole precious lot, including Ruggles,
Adams, Bidwell, or Red Mike, the reformed gambler.</p>

<p>"Never once has he asked himself whether his daughter may not
have a preference in the matter, but, with the help of heaven,
he shall not carry out this outrage."</p>

<p>In the solitude of his own thoughts, the lover put the question
to himself:</p>

<p>"Am <em>I</em> unselfish in my intentions?"</p>

<p>Selfishness is the essence of love. We resolve to obtain the
one upon whom our affections are set, regardless of the consequences
or of the future. It is <em>our</em> happiness which is placed
in the balance and outweighs everything else.</p>

<p>"Of course," continued the young officer in his self-communing,
"I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world when I win her and
she will be a happy woman. Therefore, it is her good which I seek
as much as my own."</p>

<p>How characteristic of the lover!</p>

<p>"I shall not abduct her. If she tells me she does not love me;
if she refuses to forsake all for me, then I will bid her good-by
and go off and die."</p>

<p>How characteristic again of the lover!</p>

<p>And yet it may be repeated that Lieutenant Russell was the most
guarded and circumspect of men. He no longer argued with Captain
Dawson, for it was useless. He rather lulled his suspicion by
falling in with his views, and talked of the future of parent
and daughter, as if it were one of the least interesting subjects
that could come between them.</p>

<p>On one of Vose Adams's pilgrimages to Sacramento, he returned
with a superb mettled pony, the gift of Lieutenant Russell. With
this pet she soon became a daring and accomplished horsewoman.
She was an expert, too, with the small Winchester and revolver
which her father brought with him from the East. Perched like
a bird upon her own Cap, as she named him, she often dashed for
a mile down the trail, wheeling like a flash and returning at
full speed.</p>

<p>"Have a care," said Parson Brush, more than once; "you ride like
a centaur and none knows better how to use firearms, but there
are Indians in these mountains and they sometimes approach nigh
enough to be seen from New Constantinople. Then, too, your father
brought word that other miners are working their way toward us.
More than likely there are bad men among them whom it is best
you should not meet."</p>

<p>"But none would harm <em>me</em>," was the wondering reply of
the miss; "are not all of my own race my friends?"</p>

<p>"They ought to be, but alas! it is too much to expect."</p>

<p>She could not believe, however, that any danger of that nature
threatened her, but she deferred to the fears of her father, Lieutenant
Russell and the parson to that extent that she generally had a
companion with her on these dashes down the trail. Sometimes it
was Brush, sometimes Ruggles or her parent, and less frequently
the young officer. Timon always galloped or trotted behind her
pony, and she could not be made to believe that his protection
was not all-sufficient.</p>

<p>The winds of early autumn were moaning through the gorges and
ca√±ons of the Sierras, bringing with them the breath of coming
winter, which was often felt with all its Arctic rigor in these
depressions among the towering peaks and ridges. The usual group
was gathered in the Heavenly Bower, though two of the most prominent
citizens were absent. They were Felix Brush and Wade Ruggles,
who were seated in their cabin, where a small fire had been kindled
on the primitive hearth and afforded the only light in the small
apartment. They had eaten their evening meal and as usual were
smoking.</p>

<p>As neither cared to taste the Mountain Dew, so winsome to a majority
of the miners, the two often spent their evenings thus, especially
since the shadow caused by the coming of Lieutenant Russell had
fallen across their threshold.</p>

<p>"Things begin to look better than afore," remarked Ruggles, sitting
with one leg flung across the other and looking thoughtfully into
the fire.</p>

<p>"Yes, I always insisted that the soil about here is auriferous
and we had only to stick to it to obtain our reward."</p>

<p>Ruggles took his pipe from his mouth and looked at his partner
with a disgusted expression.</p>

<p>"What are you talkin' 'bout, parson?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you refer to the diggings?" he innocently asked in turn.</p>

<p>"Come now, that won't do; you know my references to allusions
was the leftenant and the young lady. I say things look better
as regards the same."</p>

<p>"In what way?"</p>

<p>"In the only way there could be. They don't care partic'lar for
each other."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt they did some time ago."</p>

<p>"Of course, but I mean <em>now</em>."</p>

<p>"How do you explain the change, Wade?"</p>

<p>"The chap ain't a fool; he's took notice of our warnin's."</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware that we had given him any."</p>

<p>"Not 'zactly in words, but every time I've met him with the gal,
I give the leftenant a scowl. Once I come purty near shakin' my
fist at him; he's obsarved it all and is wise in time."</p>

<p>"I think there is ground for what you say," remarked the parson,
anxious to be convinced of the hoped-for fact; "what I base my
belief on is that the leftenant doesn't accompany her on her little
riding trips as often as her father or you or I: <em>that</em>
is a sure barometer, according to my judgment. Still I have sometimes
feared from the way she talks and acts that she thinks more of
him than is right."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind! She treats him as she does everybody else;
the leftenant is the friend of the cap and the leftenant give
her the dog that is the size of a meetin' house and the pony hardly
as big as the dog, but she doesn't think half as much of him as
of you and me; how can she?" demanded Ruggles, sitting bolt upright
and spreading his hand like a lawyer who has uttered an unanswerable
argument; "hain't she knowed us a blamed sight longer than him?"</p>

<p>"You are correct; I didn't think of that."</p>

<p>How eagerly we accept the argument, flimsy as it may be, which
accords with our wishes!</p>

<p>"When I feel sorter ugly over my 'spicions," continued Ruggles;
"I jest reflect that we've knowed the gal ever since she was a
baby and her father tumbled down a hundred feet onto the roof
of the Heavenly Bower, with her in his arms in the middle of that
howlin' blizzard,&mdash;when I think of that I say&#11834;"</p>

<p>The door of the cabin was hastily shoved inward and Captain Dawson,
his face as white as death, strode in.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Nellie?" he asked in a husky whisper.</p>

<p>"No; what's the matter?" asked the startled miners.</p>

<p>"She has gone! she has left me!" gasped the father dropping into
the only remaining chair, the picture of despair and unutterable
woe.</p>

<p>"Why do you think that?" asked the parson, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Russell has gone too! They have fled together!"</p>
