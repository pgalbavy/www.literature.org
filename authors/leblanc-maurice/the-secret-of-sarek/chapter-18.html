<p>The <u>Crystal Stopper</u> was running on the surface of the water. Don Luis
sat talking, with Stéphane, Patrice and All's Well, who were gathered
round him:
</p><p>"What a swine that Vorski is!" he said. "I've seen that breed of monster
before, but never one of his calibre."
</p><p>"Then, in that case . . ." Patrice Belval objected.
</p><p>"In that case?" echoed Don Luis.
</p><p>"I repeat what I've said already. You hold a monster in your hands and
you let him go free! To say nothing of its being highly immoral, think
of all the harm that he can do, that he inevitably will do! It's a heavy
responsibility to take upon yourself, that of the crimes which he will
still commit."
</p><p>"Do you think so too, Stéphane?" asked Don Luis.
</p><p>"I'm not quite sure what I think," replied Stéphane, "because, to save
François, I was prepared to make any concession. But, all the same
. . ."
</p><p>"All the same, you would rather have had another solution?"
</p><p>"Frankly, yes. So long as that man is alive and free, Madame d'Hergemont
and her son will have everything to fear from him."
</p><p>"But what other solution was there? I promised him his liberty in return
for François' immediate safety. Ought I to have promised him only his
life and handed him over to the police?"
</p><p>"Perhaps," said Captain Belval.
</p><p>"Very well. But, in that case, the police would institute enquiries, and
by discovering the fellow's real identity bring back to life the husband
of Véronique d'Hergemont and the father of François. Is that what you
want?"
</p><p>"No, no!" cried Stéphane, eagerly.
</p><p>"No, indeed," confessed Patrice Belval, a little uneasily. "No, that
solution is no better; but what astonishes me is that you, Don Luis, did
not hit upon the right one, the one which would have satisfied us all."
</p><p>"There was only one solution," Don Luis Perenna said, plainly. "There
was only one."
</p><p>"Which was that?"
</p><p>"Death."
</p><p>There was a pause. Then Don Luis resumed:
</p><p>"My friends, I did not form you into a court simply as a joke; and you
must not think that your parts as judges are played because the trial
seems to you to be over. It is still going on; and the court has not
risen. That is why I want you to answer me honestly: do you consider
that Vorski deserves to die?"
</p><p>"Yes," declared Patrice.
</p><p>And Stéphane approved:
</p><p>"Yes, beyond a doubt."
</p><p>"My friends," Don Luis continued, "your verdict is not sufficiently
solemn. I beseech you to utter it formally and conscientiously, as
though you were in the presence of the culprit. I ask you once more:
what penalty did Vorski deserve?"
</p><p>They raised their hands and, one after the other, answered:
</p><p>"Death."
</p><p>Don Luis whistled. One of the Moors ran up.
</p><p>"Two pairs of binoculars, Hadji."
</p><p>The man brought the glasses and Don Luis handed them to Stéphane and
Patrice:
</p><p>"We are only a mile from Sarek," he said. "Look towards the point: the
boat should have started."
</p><p>"Yes," said Patrice, presently.
</p><p>"Do you see her, Stéphane?"
</p><p>"Yes, only . . ."
</p><p>"Only what?"
</p><p>"There's only one passenger."
</p><p>"Yes," said Patrice, "only one passenger."
</p><p>They put down their binoculars and one of them said:
</p><p>"Only one has got away: Vorski evidently. He must have killed Otto, his
accomplice."
</p><p>"Unless Otto, his accomplice, has killed him," chuckled Don Luis.
</p><p>"What makes you say that?"
</p><p>"Why, remember the prophecy made to Vorski in his youth: 'Your wife will
die on the cross and you will be killed by a friend.'"
</p><p>"I doubt if a prediction is enough."
</p><p>"I have other proofs, though."
</p><p>"What proofs?"
</p><p>"They, my friends, form part of the last problem we shall have to
elucidate together. For instance, what is your idea of the manner in
which I substituted Elfride Vorski for Madame d'Hergemont?"
</p><p>Stéphane shook his head:
</p><p>"I confess that I never understood."
</p><p>"And yet it's so simple! When a gentleman in a drawing-room, in a white
tie and a tail-coat, performs conjuring-tricks or guesses your thoughts,
you say to yourself, don't you, that there must be some artifice beneath
it all, the assistance of a confederate? Well, you need seek no farther
where I'm concerned."
</p><p>"What, you had a confederate?"
</p><p>"Yes, certainly."
</p><p>"But who was he?"
</p><p>"Otto."
</p><p>"Otto? But you never left us! You never spoke to him, surely?"
</p><p>"How could I have succeeded without his help? In reality, I had two
confederates in this business, Elfride and Otto, both of whom betrayed
Vorski, either out of revenge or out of greed. While you, Stéphane, were
luring Vorski past the Fairies' Dolmen, I accosted Otto. We soon struck
a bargain, at the cost of a few bank-notes and in return for a promise
that he would come out of the adventure safe and sound. Moreover I
informed him that Vorski had pouched the sisters Archignat's fifty
thousand francs."
</p><p>"How did you know that?" asked Stéphane.
</p><p>"Through my confederate number one, through Elfride, whom I continued to
question in a whisper while you were looking out for Vorski's coming and
who also, in a few brief words, told me what she knew of Vorski's
past."
</p><p>"When all is said, you only saw Otto that once."
</p><p>"Two hours later, after Elfride's death and after the fireworks in the
hollow oak, we had a second interview, under the Fairies' Dolmen. Vorski
was asleep, stupefied with drink, and Otto was mounting guard. You can
imagine that I seized the opportunity to obtain particulars of the
business and to complete my information about Vorski with the details
which Otto for two years had been secretly collecting about a chief whom
he detested. Then he unloaded Vorski's and Conrad's revolvers, or rather
he removed the bullets, while leaving the cartridges. Then he handed me
Vorski's watch and note-book, as well as an empty locket and a
photograph of Vorski's mother which Otto had stolen from him some months
before, things which helped me next day to play the wizard with the
aforesaid Vorski in the crypt where he found me. That is how Otto and I
collaborated."
</p><p>"Very well," said Patrice, "but still you didn't ask him to kill
Vorski?"
</p><p>"Certainly not."
</p><p>"In that case, how are we to know that . . ."
</p><p>"Do you think that Vorski did not end by discovering our collaboration,
which is one of the obvious causes of his defeat? And do you imagine
that Master Otto did not foresee this contingency? You may be sure that
there was no doubt of this: Vorski, once unfastened from his tree, would
have made away with his accomplice, both from motives of revenge and in
order to recover the sisters Archignat's fifty thousand francs. Otto got
the start of him. Vorski was there, helpless, lifeless, an easy prey. He
struck him a blow. I will go farther and say that Otto, who is a
coward, did not even strike him a blow. He will simply have left Vorski
on his tree. And so the punishment is complete. Are you appeased now, my
friends? Is your craving for justice satisfied?"
</p><p>Patrice and Stéphane were silent, impressed by the terrible vision which
Don Luis was conjuring up before their eyes.
</p><p>"There," he said, laughing, "I was right not to make you pronounce
sentence over there, when we were standing at the foot of the oak, with
the live man in front of us! I can see that my two judges might have
flinched a little at that moment. And so would my third judge, eh, All's
Well, you sensitive, tearful fellow? And I am like you, my friends. We
are not people who condemn and execute. But, all the same, think of what
Vorski was, think of his thirty murders and his refinements of cruelty
and congratulate me on having, in the last resort, chosen blind destiny
as his judge and the loathsome Otto as his responsible executioner. The
will of the gods be done!"
</p><p>The Sarek coast was making a thinner line on the horizon. It disappeared
in the mist in which sea and sky were merged.
</p><p>The three men were silent. All three were thinking of the isle of the
dead, laid waste by one man's madness, the isle of the dead where soon
some visitor would find the inexplicable traces of the tragedy, the
entrances to the tunnels, the cells with their "death-chambers," the
hall of the God-Stone, the mortuary crypts, Elfride's body, Conrad's
body, the skeletons of the sisters Archignat and, right at the end of
the island, near the Fairies' Dolmen, where the prophecy of the thirty
coffins and the four crosses was written for all to read, Vorski's great
body, lonely and pitiable, mangled by the ravens and owls.
</p><hr/>
<p>A villa near Arcachon, in the pretty village of Les Moulleaux, whose
pine-trees run down to the shores of the gulf.
</p><p>Véronique is sitting in the garden. A week's rest and happiness have
restored the colour to her comely face and assuaged all evil memories.
She is looking with a smile at her son, who, standing a little way off,
is listening to and questioning Don Luis Perenna. She also looks at
Stéphane; and their eyes meet gently.
</p><p>It is easy to see that the affection in which they both hold the boy is
a link which unites them closely and which is strengthened by their
secret thoughts and their unuttered feelings. Not once has Stéphane
recalled the avowals which he made in the cell, under the Black Heath;
but Véronique has not forgotten them; and the profound gratitude which
she feels for the man who brought up her son is mingled with a special
emotion and an agitation of which she unconsciously savours the charm.
</p><p>That day, Don Luis, who, on the evening when the <u>Crystal Stopper</u>
brought them all to the Villa des Moulleaux, had taken the train for
Paris, arrived unexpectedly at lunch-time, accompanied by Patrice
Belval; and during the hour that they have been sitting in their
rocking-chairs in the garden, the boy, his face all pink with
excitement, has never ceased to question his rescuer:
</p><p>"And what did you do next? . . . But how did you know? . . . And what
put you on the track of that?"
</p><p>"My darling," says Véronique, "aren't you afraid of boring Don Luis?"
</p><p>"No, madame," replies Don Luis, rising, going up to Véronique and
speaking in such a way that the boy cannot hear, "no, François is not
boring me; and in fact I like answering his questions. But I confess
that he perplexes me a little and that I am afraid of saying something
awkward. Tell me, how much exactly does he know of the whole story?"
</p><p>"As much as I know myself, except Vorski's name, of course."
</p><p>"But does he know the part which Vorski played?"
</p><p>"Yes, but with certain differences. He thinks that Vorski is an escaped
prisoner who picked up the legend of Sarek and, in order to get hold of
the God-Stone, proceeded to carry out the prophecy touching it. I have
kept some of the lines of the prophecy from François."
</p><p>"And the part played by Elfride? Her hatred for you? The threats she
made you?"
</p><p>"Madwoman's talk, I told François, of which I myself did not understand
the meaning."
</p><p>Don Luis smiled:
</p><p>"The explanation is a little arbitrary; and I have a notion that
François quite well understands that certain parts of the tragedy remain
and must remain obscure to him. The great thing, don't you think, is
that he should not know that Vorski was his father?"
</p><p>"He does not know and he never will."
</p><p>"And then--and this is what I was coming to--what name will he bear
himself?"
</p><p>"What do you mean?"
</p><p>"Whose son will he believe himself to be? For you know as well as I do
that the legal reality is this, that François Vorski died fifteen years
ago, drowned in a shipwreck, and his grandfather with him. And Vorski
died last year, stabbed by a fellow-prisoner. Neither of them is alive
in the eyes of the law. So . . ."
</p><p>Véronique nodded her head and smiled:
</p><p>"So I don't know. The position seems to me, as you say, incapable of
explanation. But everything will come out all right."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>"Because you're here to do it."
</p><p>It was his turn to smile:
</p><p>"I can no longer take credit for the actions which I perform or the
steps which I take. Everything is arranging itself <u>a priori</u>. Then why
worry?"
</p><p>"Am I not right to?"
</p><p>"Yes," he said, gravely. "The woman who has suffered all that you have
must not be subjected to the least additional annoyance. And nothing
shall happen to her after this, I swear. So what I suggest to you is
this: long ago, you married against your father's wish a very distant
cousin, who died after leaving you a son, François. This son your
father, to be revenged upon you, kidnapped and brought to Sarek. At your
father's death, the name of d'Hergemont became extinct and there is
nothing to recall the events of your marriage."
</p><p>"But my name remains. Legally, in the official records, I am Véronique
d'Hergemont."
</p><p>"Your maiden name disappears under your married name."
</p><p>"You mean under that of Vorski."
</p><p>"No, because you did not marry that fellow Vorski, but one of your
cousins called . . ."
</p><p>"Called what?"
</p><p>"Jean Maroux. Here is a stamped certificate of your marriage to Jean
Maroux, a marriage mentioned in your official records, as this other
document shows."
</p><p>Véronique looked at Don Luis in amazement:
</p><p>"But why? Why that name?"
</p><p>"Why? So that your son may be neither d'Hergemont, which would have
recalled past events, nor Vorski, which would have recalled the name of
a traitor. Here is his birth-certificate, as François Maroux."
</p><p>She repeated, all blushing and confused:
</p><p>"But why did you choose just that name?"
</p><p>"It seemed easy for François. It's the name of Stéphane, with whom
François will go on living for some time. We can say that Stéphane was a
relation of your husband's; and this will explain the intimacy
generally. That is my plan. It presents, believe me, no possible danger.
When one is confronted by an inexplicable and painful position like
yours, one must needs employ special means and resort to drastic and, I
admit, very illegal measures. I did so without scruple, because I have
the good fortune to dispose of resources which are not within
everybody's reach. Do you approve of what I have done?"
</p><p>Véronique bent her head:
</p><p>"Yes," she said, "yes."
</p><p>He half-rose from his seat:
</p><p>"Besides," he added, "if there should be any drawbacks, the future will
no doubt take upon itself the burden of removing them. It would be
enough, for instance--there is no indiscretion, is there, in alluding to
the feelings which Stéphane entertains for François' mother?--it would
be enough if, one day or another, for reasons of common-sense, or
reasons of gratitude, François' mother were moved to accept the homage
of those feelings. How much simpler everything will be if François
already bears the name of Maroux! How much more easily the past will be
abolished, both for the outside world and for François, who will no
longer be able to pry into the secret of bygone events which there will
be nothing to recall to memory. It seemed to me that these were rather
weighty arguments. I am glad to see that you share my opinion."
</p><p>Don Luis bowed to Véronique and, without insisting any further, without
appearing to notice her confusion, turned to François and explained:
</p><p>"I'm at your orders now, young man. And, since you don't want to leave
anything unexplained, let's go back to the God-Stone and the scoundrel
who coveted its possession. Yes, the scoundrel," repeated Don Luis,
seeing no reason not to speak of Vorski with absolute frankness, "and
the most terrible scoundrel that I have ever met with, because he
believed in his mission; in short, a sick-brained man, a lunatic . . ."
</p><p>"Well, first of all," François observed, "what I don't understand is
that you waited all night to capture him, when he and his accomplices
were sleeping under the Fairies' Dolmen."
</p><p>"Well done, youngster," said Don Luis, laughing, "you have put your
finger on a weak point! If I had acted as you suggest, the tragedy would
have been finished twelve or fifteen hours earlier. But think, would you
have been released? Would the scoundrel have spoken and revealed your
hiding-place? I don't think so. To loosen his tongue I had to keep him
simmering. I had to make him dizzy, to drive him mad with apprehension
and anguish and to convince him by means of a mass of proofs, that he
was irretrievably defeated. Otherwise he would have held his tongue and
we might perhaps not have found you. . . . . Besides, at that time, my
plan was not very clear, I did not quite know how to wind up; and it was
not until much later that I thought not of submitting him to violent
torture--I am incapable of that--but of tying him to that tree on which
he wanted to let your mother die. So that, in my perplexity and
hesitation, I simply yielded, in the end, to the wish--the rather
puerile wish, I blush to confess--to carry out the prophecy to the end,
to see how the missionary would behave in the presence of the ancient
Druid, in short to amuse myself. After all, the adventure was so dark
and gloomy that a little fun seemed to me essential. And I laughed like
blazes. That was wrong. I admit it and I apologize."
</p><p>The boy was laughing too. Don Luis, who was holding him between his
knees, kissed him and asked:
</p><p>"Do you forgive me?"
</p><p>"Yes, on condition that you answer two more questions. The first is not
important."
</p><p>"Ask away."
</p><p>"It's about the ring. Where did you get that ring which you put first on
mother's finger and afterwards on Elfride's?"
</p><p>"I made it that same night, in a few minutes, out of an old wedding-ring
and some coloured stones."
</p><p>"But the scoundrel recognized it as having belonged to his mother."
</p><p>"He thought he recognized it; and he thought it because the ring was
like the other."
</p><p>"But how did you know that? And how did you learn the story?"
</p><p>"From himself."
</p><p>"You don't mean that?"
</p><p>"Certainly I do! From words that escaped him while he was sleeping under
the Fairies' Dolmen. A drunkard's nightmare. Bit by bit he told the
whole story of his mother. Elfride knew a good part of it besides. You
see how simple it is and how my luck stood by me!"
</p><p>"But the riddle of the God-Stone is not simple," François cried, "and
you deciphered it! People have been trying for centuries and you took a
few hours!"
</p><p>"No, a few minutes, François. It was enough for me to read the letter
which your grandfather wrote about it to Captain Belval. I sent your
grandfather by post all the explanations as to the position and the
marvellous nature of the God-Stone."
</p><p>"Well," cried the boy, "it's those explanations that I'm asking of you,
Don Luis. This is my last question, I promise you. What made people
believe in the power of the God-Stone? And what did that so-called power
consist of exactly?"
</p><p>Stéphane and Patrice drew up their chairs. Véronique sat up and
listened. They all understood that Don Luis had waited until they were
together before rending the veil of the mystery before their eyes.
</p><p>He began to laugh:
</p><p>"You mustn't hope for anything sensational," he said. "A mystery is
worth just as much as the darkness in which it is shrouded; and, as we
have begun by dispelling the darkness, nothing remains but the fact
itself in its naked reality. Nevertheless the facts in this case are
strange and the reality is not denuded of a certain grandeur."
</p><p>"It must needs be so," said Patrice Belval, "seeing that the reality
left so miraculous a legend in the isle of Sarek and even all over
Brittany."
</p><p>"Yes," said Don Luis, "and a legend so persistent that it influences us
to this day and that not one of you has escaped the obsession of the
miraculous."
</p><p>"What do you mean?" protested Patrice. "I don't believe in miracles."
</p><p>"No more do I," said the boy.
</p><p>"Yes, you do, you believe in them, you accept miracles as possible. If
not, you would long ago have seen the whole truth."
</p><p>"Why?"
</p><p>Don Luis picked a magnificent rose from a tree by his side and asked
François:
</p><p>"Is it possible for me to transform this rose, whose proportions, as it
is, are larger than those a rose often attains, into a flower double
the size and this rose-tree into a shrub twice as tall?"
</p><p>"Certainly not," said François.
</p><p>"Then why did you admit, why did you all admit that Maguennoc could
achieve that result, merely by digging up earth in certain parts of the
island, at certain fixed hours? That was a miracle; and you accepted it
without hesitation, unconsciously."
</p><p>Stéphane objected:
</p><p>"We accept what we saw with our eyes."
</p><p>"But you accepted it as a miracle, that is to say, as a phenomenon which
Maguennoc produced by special and, truth to tell, by supernatural means.
Whereas I, when I read this detail in M. d'Hergemont's letter, at
once--what shall I say?--caught on. I at once established the connection
between those monstrous blossoms and the name borne by the Calvary of
the flowers. And my conviction was immediate: 'No, Maguennoc is not a
wizard. He simply cleared a piece of uncultivated land around the
Calvary; and all he had to do, to produce abnormal flowers, was to bring
along a layer of mould. So the God-Stone is underneath; the God-Stone
which, in the middle-ages, produced the same abnormal flowers; the
God-Stone, which, in the days of the Druids, healed the sick and
strengthened children.'"
</p><p>"Therefore," said Patrice, "there is a miracle."
</p><p>"There is a miracle if we accept the supernatural explanation. There is
a natural phenomenon if we look for it and if we find the physical cause
capable of giving rise to the apparent miracle."
</p><p>"But those physical causes don't exist! They are not present."
</p><p>"They exist, because you have seen monstrous flowers."
</p><p>"Then there is a stone," asked Patrice, almost chaffingly, "which can
naturally give health and strength? And that stone is the God-Stone?"
</p><p>"There is not a particular, individual stone. But there are stones,
blocks of stone, rocks, hills and mountains of rock, which contain
mineral veins formed of various metals, oxides of uranium, silver, lead,
copper, nickel, cobalt and so on. And among these metals are some which
emit a special radiation, endowed with peculiar properties known as
radioactivity. These veins are veins of pitchblende which are found
hardly anywhere in Europe except in the north of Bohemia and which are
worked near the little town of Joachimsthal. And those radioactive
bodies are uranium, thorium, helium and chiefly, in the case which we
are considering . . ."
</p><p>"Radium," François interrupted.
</p><p>"You've said it, my boy: radium. Phenomena of radioactivity occur more
or less everywhere; and we may say that they are manifested throughout
nature, as in the healing action of thermal springs. But plainly
radioactive bodies like radium possess more definite properties. For
instance, there is no doubt that the rays and the emanation of radium
exercise a power over the life of plants, a power similar to that caused
by the passage of an electric current. In both cases, the stimulation of
the nutritive centres makes the elements required by the plant more easy
to assimilate and promotes its growth. In the same way, there is no
doubt that the radium rays are capable of exercising a physiological
action on living tissues, by producing more or less profound
modifications, destroying certain cells and contributing to develop
other cells and even to control their evolution. Radiotherapy claims to
have healed or improved numerous cases of rheumatism of the joints,
nervous troubles, ulceration, eczema, tumours and adhesive cicatrices.
In short radium is a really effective therapeutic agent."
</p><p>"So," said Stéphane, "you regard the God-Stone . . ."
</p><p>"I regard the God-Stone as a block of radiferous pitchblende originating
from the Joachimsthal lodes. I have long known the Bohemian legend which
speaks of a miraculous stone that was once removed from the side of a
hill; and, when I was travelling in Bohemia, I saw the hole left by the
stone. It corresponds pretty accurately with the dimensions of the
God-Stone."
</p><p>"But," Stéphane objected, "radium is contained in rocks only in the form
of infinitesimal particles. Remember that, after a mass of fourteen
hundred tons of rock have been duly mined and washed and treated, there
remains at the end of it all only a filtrate of some fifteen grains of
radium. And you attribute a miraculous power to the God-Stone, which
weighs two tons at most!"
</p><p>"But it evidently contains radium in appreciable quantities. Nature has
not pledged herself to be always niggardly and invariably to dilute the
radium. She was pleased to accumulate in the God-Stone a generous supply
which enabled it to produce the apparently extraordinary phenomena which
we know of . . . not forgetting that we have to allow for popular
exaggeration."
</p><p>Stéphane seemed to be yielding to conviction. Nevertheless he said:
</p><p>"One last point. Apart from the God-Stone, there was the little chip of
stone which Maguennoc found in the leaden sceptre, the prolonged touch
of which burnt his hand. According to you, this was a particle of
radium?"
</p><p>"Undoubtedly. And it is this perhaps that most clearly reveals the
presence and the power of radium in all this adventure. When Henri
Becquerel, the great physicist, kept a tube containing a salt of radium
in his waistcoat-pocket, his skin became covered in a few days with
suppurating ulcers. Curie repeated the experiment, with the same result.
Maguennoc's case was more serious, because he held the particle of
radium in his hand. A wound formed which had a cancerous appearance.
Scared by all that he knew and all that he himself had said about the
miraculous stone which burns like hell-fire and 'gives life or death,'
he chopped off his hand."
</p><p>"Very well," said Stéphane, "but where did that particle of pure radium
come from? It can't have been a chip of the God-Stone, because, once
again, however rich a mineral may be, radium is incorporated in it, not
in isolated grains, but in a soluble form, which has to be dissolved and
afterwards collected, by a series of mechanical operations, into a
solution rich enough to enable successive crystallizations and
concentrations to isolate the active product which the solution
contains. All this and a number of other later operations demand an
enormous plant, with workshops, laboratories, expert chemists, in short,
a very different state of civilization, you must admit, from the state
of barbarism in which our ancestors the Celts were immersed."
</p><p>Don Luis smiled and tapped the young man on the shoulder:
</p><p>"Hear, hear, Stéphane! I am glad to see that François' friend and tutor
has a far-seeing and logical mind. The objection is perfectly valid and
suggested itself to me at once. I might reply by putting forward some
quite legitimate theory, I might presume a natural means of isolating
radium and imagine that, in a geological fault occurring in the granite,
at the bottom of a big pocket containing radiferous ore, a fissure has
opened through which the waters of the river slowly trickle, carrying
with them infinitesimal quantities of radium; that the waters so charged
flow for a long time in a narrow channel, combine again, become
concentrated and, after centuries upon centuries, filter through in
little drops, which evaporate at once, and form at the point of
emergence a tiny stalactite, exceedingly rich in radium, the tip of
which is broken off one day by some Gallic warrior. But is there any
need to seek so far and to have recourse to hypotheses? Cannot we rely
on the unaided genius and the inexhaustible resources of nature? Does it
call for a more wonderful effort on her part to evolve by her own
methods a particle of pure radium than to make a cherry ripen or to make
this rose bloom . . . or to give life to our delightful All's Well? What
do you say, young François? Do we agree?"
</p><p>"We always agree," replied the boy.
</p><p>"So you don't unduly regret the miracle of the God-Stone?"
</p><p>"Why, the miracle still exists!"
</p><p>"You're right, François, it still exists and a hundred times more
beautiful and dazzling than before. Science does not kill miracles: it
purifies them and ennobles them. What was that crafty, capricious,
wicked, incomprehensible little power attached to the tip of a magic
wand and acting at random, according to the ignorant fancy of a
barbarian chief or Druid, what was it, I ask you, beside the beneficent,
logical, reliable and quite as miraculous power which we behold to-day
in a pinch of radium?"
</p><p>Don Luis suddenly interrupted himself and began to laugh:
</p><p>"Come, come, I'm allowing myself to be carried away and singing an ode
to science! Forgive me, madame," he added, rising and going up to
Véronique, "and tell me that I have not bored you too much with my
explanations. I haven't, have I? Not too much? Besides, it's finished
. . . or nearly finished. There is only one more point to make clear,
one decision to take."
</p><p>He sat down beside her:
</p><p>"It's this. Now that we have won the God-Stone, in other words, an
actual treasure, what are we going to do with it?"
</p><p>Véronique spoke with a heartfelt impulse:
</p><p>"Oh, as to that, don't let us speak of it! I don't want anything that
may come from Sarek, or anything that's found in the Priory. We will
work."
</p><p>"Still, the Priory belongs to you."
</p><p>"No, no, Véronique d'Hergemont no longer exists and the Priory no longer
belongs to any one. Let it all be put up to auction. I don't want
anything of that accursed past."
</p><p>"And how will you live?"
</p><p>"As I used to by my work. I am sure that François approves, don't you,
darling?"
</p><p>And, with an instinctive movement, turning to Stéphane, as though he had
a certain right to give his opinion, she added:
</p><p>"You too approve, don't you, dear Stéphane?"
</p><p>"Entirely," he said.
</p><p>She at once went on:
</p><p>"Besides, though I don't doubt my father's feelings of affection, I have
no proof of his wishes towards me."
</p><p>"I have the proofs," said Don Luis.
</p><p>"How?"
</p><p>"Patrice and I went back to Sarek. In a writing-desk in Maguennoc's
room, in a secret drawer, we found a sealed, but unaddressed envelope,
and opened it. It contained a bond worth ten thousand francs a year and
a sheet of paper which read as follows:
</p><p>"'After my death, Maguennoc will hand this bond to Stéphane Maroux, to
whom I confide the charge of my grandson, François. When François is
eighteen years of age, the bond will be his to do what he likes with. I
hope and trust, however, that he will seek his mother and find her and
that she will pray for my soul. I bless them both.'
</p><p>"Here is the bond," said Don Luis, "and here is the letter. It is dated
April of this year."
</p><p>Véronique was astounded. She looked at Don Luis and the thought occurred
to her that all this was perhaps merely a story invented by that strange
man to place her and her son beyond the reach of want. It was a passing
thought. When all was considered, it was a natural consequence.
Everything said, M. d'Hergemont's action was very reasonable; and,
foreseeing the difficulties that would crop up after his death, it was
only right that he should think of his grandson. She murmured:
</p><p>"I have not the right to refuse."
</p><p>"You have so much the less right," said Don Luis, "in that the
transaction excludes you altogether. Your father's wishes affect
François and Stéphane directly. So we are agreed. There remains the
God-Stone; and I repeat my question. What are we to do with it? To whom
does it belong?"
</p><p>"To you," said Véronique, definitely.
</p><p>"To me?"
</p><p>"Yes, to you. You discovered it and you have given it a real
signification."
</p><p>"I must remind you," said Don Luis, "that this block of stone possesses,
beyond a doubt, an incalculable value. However great the miracles
wrought by nature may be, it is only through a wonderful concourse of
circumstances that she was able to perform the miracle of collecting so
much precious matter in so small a volume. There are treasures and
treasures there."
</p><p>"So much the better," said Véronique, "you will be able to make a better
use of them than any one else."
</p><p>Don Luis thought for a moment and added:
</p><p>"You are quite right; and I confess that I prepared for this climax.
First, because my right to the God-Stone seemed to me to be proved by
adequate titles of ownership; and, next, because I have need of that
block of stone. Yes, upon my word, the tombstone of the Kings of Bohemia
has not exhausted its magic power; there are plenty of nations left on
whom that power might produce as great an effect as on our ancestors the
Gauls; and, as it happens, I am tackling a formidable undertaking in
which an assistance of this kind will be invaluable to me. In a few
years, when my task is completed, I will bring the God-Stone back to
France and present it to a national laboratory which I intend to found.
In this way science will purge any evil that the God-Stone may have done
and the horrible adventure of Sarek will be atoned for. Do you approve,
madame?"
</p><p>She gave him her hand:
</p><p>"With all my heart."
</p><p>There was a fairly long pause. Then Don Luis said:
</p><p>"Ah, yes, a horrible adventure, too terrible for words. I have had some
gruesome adventures in my life which have left painful memories behind
them. But this outdoes them all. It exceeds anything that is possible in
reality or human in suffering. It was so excessively logical as to
become illogical; and this because it was the act of a madman . . . and
also because it came to pass at a season of madness and bewilderment. It
was the war which facilitated the safe silent committal of an obscure
crime prepared and executed by a monster. In times of peace, monsters
have not the time to realize their stupid dreams. To-day, in that
solitary island, this particular monster found special, abnormal
conditions . . ."
</p><p>"Please don't let us talk about all this," murmured Véronique, in a
trembling voice.
</p><p>Don Luis kissed her hand and then took All's Well and lifted him in his
arms:
</p><p>"You're right. Don't let's talk about it, or else tears would come and
All's Well would be sad. Therefore, All's Well, my delightful All's
Well, let us talk no more of the dreadful adventure. But all the same
let us recall certain episodes which were beautiful and picturesque. For
instance, Maguennoc's garden with the gigantic flowers; you will
remember it as I shall, won't you, All's Well? And the legend of the
God-Stone, the idyll of the Celtic tribes wandering with the memorial
stone of their kings, the stone all vibrant with radium, emitting an
incessant bombardment of vivifying and miraculous atoms; all that, All's
Well, possesses a certain charm, doesn't it? Only, my most exquisite
All's Well, if I were a novelist and if it were my duty to tell the
story of Coffin Island, I should not trouble too much about the horrid
truth and I should give you a much more important part. I should do away
with the intervention of that phrase-mongering humbug of a Don Luis and
you would be the fearless and silent rescuer. You would fight the
abominable monster, you would thwart his machinations and, in the end,
you, with your marvellous instinct, would punish vice and make virtue
triumph. And it would be much better so, because none would be more
capable than you, my delightful All's Well, of demonstrating by a
thousand proofs, each more convincing than the other, that in this life
of ours all things come right and all's well."
