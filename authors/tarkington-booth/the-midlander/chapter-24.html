<p><em>SHE </em>was right; the growth was now visibly upon the pleasant
and substantial town, where all had once appeared to be so settled
and so finished; for, just as with some of man’s disorders that
develop slowly, at first merely hinting in mild prophetic symptoms,
then becoming more sinister, and attacking one member after another
until the whole body writhes and alters, so it is with this disorder
that comes racking the midland towns through distortions and turmoil
into the vaster likenesses of cities: haphazard and insignificant
destructions begin casually, but gradually grow more sweeping
and more violent until the victim town becomes aware of great
crashings;—and then lies choking in a cloud of dust and smoke
wherein huge new excrescences appear.</p>

<p>Cameras of the new age sometimes record upon strips of moving
film the slow life of a plant from the seed to the blossoming
of its flower; and then there is thrown upon the screen a picture
in which time is so quickened that the plant is seen in the very
motions of its growth, twisting itself out of the ground and stretching
and swelling to its maturity, all within a few minutes. So might
a film record be made of the new growth bringing to full life
a quiet and elderly midland town; but the picture would be dumfounding.
Cyclone, earthquake, and miracle would seem to stalk hand-in-hand
upon the screen; thunder and avalanche should play in the orchestra
pit.</p>

<p>In such a picture, block after block of heavy old mansions would
be seen to topple; row on row of stout buildings would vanish
almost simultaneously; families would be shown in flight, carrying
away their goods with them from houses about to crumble; miles
of tall trees would be uprooted; the earth would gape, opening
in great holes and long chasms;—the very streets would unskin
themselves and twist in agony; every landmark would fly dispersed
in powder upon the wind, and all old-established things disappear.</p>

<p>Such a picture would be but the truth with time condensed;—that
is to say, the truth made like a man’s recollection of events—and
yet it would not be like the truth as the truth appeared to Daniel
Oliphant and the other men who made the growth, nor like their
subsequent memories. For these men saw, not the destruction, but
only the city they were building; and they shouted their worship
of that vision and were exultant in the uproar. They shouted as
each new skyscraper rose swimming through the vast drifts of smoke,
and shouted again as the plain, clean, old business streets collapsed
and the magnificent and dirty new ones climbed above the ruins.
They shouted when business went sweeping outward from its centre,
tearing away the houses where people had lived contentedly for
so long; and they shouted again as the new factory suburbs marched
upon the countryside, far and wide, and the colossal black plumes
of new chimneys went undulating off into a perpetual smoke-mist,
so that the distant level plain seemed to be a plain surrounding
not a city, but an ever-fuming volcano.</p>

<p>Once again, in the interminably cycling repetition of the new
displacing the old, then becoming the old and being displaced
in turn, an old order was perishing. The "New Materialism" that
had begun to grow with the renewed growing of the country after
the Civil War, and staggered under the Panic of ’73, but recovered
and went on growing egregiously, had become an old materialism
now. It had done great things and little things. Amongst the latter,
it had furnished Europe with a caricature type of the American—the
"successful American business man." On the shelf, beside the figure
of the loud-tweeded Boxing Briton with his "side whiskers," Europe
set the lank-and-drawling, chin-bearded, palace-buying Boaster
of the Almighty Dollar, the Yankee of the great boom period.</p>

<p>That had been a great railroad-making and railroad-breaking period;
the great steel period; the great oil period; the great electric-invention
period; the great Barnum-and-Bunkum period; the period of "corrupt
senators"; of reform; and of skyscrapers thirty stories high.
All this was old now, routed by a newer and more gorgeous materialism.
The old had still its disciplines for the young and its general
appearance of piety; bad children were still whipped sometimes,
and the people of best reputation played no games on Sunday, but
went to church and seemed to believe in God and the Bible with
almost the faith of their fathers. But many of these people went
down with their falling houses; a new society, swarming upward
above the old surfaces, became dominant. It began to breed, among
other things, a new critic who attacked every faith, and offered,
instead of mysteries, full knowledge of all creation as merely
a bit of easily comprehended mechanics. And in addition to discovering
the secret of the universe, the new society discovered golf, communism,
the movies, and the turkey trot; it spread the great American
cocktail over the whole world, abolished horses, and produced
buildings fifty stories high.</p>

<p>. . . The slow beginnings of the new growth in the town had been
imperceptible except to a few exuberant dreamers—the most persistent
somnambulist of whom was Dan Oliphant—but now that the motion
was daily more visible to all men, there was no stopping it. Hard
times and prosperity were all one to it;—it marched, and so did
its chief herald and those who went shouting before it with him,
while the "old conservative business men," the Shelbys and Rowes
and John P. Johnses, sat shaking their heads and muttering "Gamblers!"</p>

<p>Gamblers, or destroying angels, or prophets, whatever they were,
they went trampling forward in thunder and dust. The great Sheridan,
of the Trust Company and the Pump Works, had joined them. Unscrupulous
and noisiest of the noisy, he was like a war band drumming and
brassily trumpeting with the vanguard. There was Eugene Morgan
who had begun building the "Morgan Car" when automobiles were
a joke, and now puffed forth from his long lanes of shops black
smoke that trailed off unendingly to the horizon that it dimmed.
Pendleton, of the new "Pendleton Tractor," marched with these,
and old Sam Kohn and Sol Kohn and Sam Kohn, Junior—the Kohns were
tearing down the Amberson Block, the very centre and business
temple of the old town, the corner of National Avenue and First
Street—and there were the Rosenberg Brothers, apartment builders
who would buy and obliterate half a dozen solid old houses at
a time. There were the Schmidts, the Reillys, the younger Johnsons,
third generation of the old firm of Abner Johnson’s Sons, and
there were the Caldinis, the Comiskeys, and the Hensels, as well
as all the never-resting optimists who had come to the town from
farms and villages to blast it into nothingness and build their
own city and build themselves into it.</p>

<p>In the din of all the tearing down and building up, most of the
old family names were not heard, or were heard but obscurely,
or perhaps in connection with misfortunes; for many of the old
families were vanishing. They and their fathers and grandfathers
had slowly made the town; they had always thought of it as their
own, and they had expected to sit looking out upon it complacently
forever from the plate glass of their big houses on National Avenue
and the two other streets parallel to the avenue and nearest it.
They had built thick walls round themselves, these "old families,"
not only when they built the walls of their houses, but when they
built the walls encircling their close association with one another.
The growth razed all these walls; the "sets" had resisted the
"climbers," but the defences fell now; and those who had sheltered
behind them were dispersed, groping for one another in the smoke.</p>

<p>It was Dan Oliphant who began the destruction of National Avenue.
Among the crumbling families were the Vertreeses;—they retired
to what was left of their country estate, which had already been
overtaken by the expanding town and compressed to half an acre.
Dan bought the old Vertrees Mansion on National Avenue, tore it
down and built upon its site a tremendous square box of concrete
fronted with glass—the "sales building" of the "Ornaby Four, the
Car of Excellent Service." This was just across the street from
where his grandmother had lived, and Harlan protested long and
loudly; but Dan was too busy to give his brother a complete attention.
He said mildly that his new building seemed at least an improvement
upon the shabby boarding-house, which the Vertrees Mansion had
become when he bought it; and, when Harlan hotly denied the improvement,
Dan sat listening with an expression of indulgence, the while
occupying his mind with computations concerning other matters.</p>

<p>For, as Martha had felt, these were his great days, and he was
"in on" everything. The Earl of Ornaby was earl of more than Ornaby
now; Ornaby and the "Ornaby Four" were but two of the adventurous
fleets he had at sea. He was "in on" a dozen "promotions" at once;
"in on" the stock of new "industrials"; inventors and exploiters
lived at his office doors. And although all of his fellow-hustlers
used the phrase, none could say "my city" with a greater right
than he. When he began one of his boostings with, "I believe first
of all in my own city," the voice of a religion was heard. He
was his city; he was its spirit, and more than any other he was
its guide, and yet its slave and worshipper. He could not speak
of it except with reverence, nor go on speaking of it long unless
he made the eagle scream.</p>

<p>He had become a juggler of money, which poured streaming into
one hand as fast as he hurled it aloft with the other. He was
one of those men of whom it is said, "Nobody knows what he’s worth.
He couldn’t tell you, himself, to save his life!" He was called
"rich," and sometimes he was said to be the richest man in town.
He juggled with money, with land, with houses, with skyscrapers,
and with factories, keeping them all in the air at once; and his
brother said that even so, Dan still "danced the tight-rope,"
maintaining his balance dangerously during the juggling. Meanwhile,
as he balanced and tossed the glittering and ponderous things
through the air, the rest of the deafening show went on; the hustling
and booming and boosting moving round and round him in clouds
of dust to the sound of brass bands, while crowds gazed marvelling
up at the juggler, and admired and envied him.</p>

<p>Of all the admirers who now looked up to him, cheering, probably
the most enthusiastic was his brother-in-law, George McMillan,
whom Dan had made "General Manager of the Ornaby Four." George
had not quite fulfilled his own prediction that at forty he was
to be a "drunken broker"; but he had come, as he said, "near enough
to it"; and he was glad when Dan finally sent for him and his
designer of a new gasoline engine, the prospective "Ornaby Four."</p>

<p>"It’s the greatest idea in the world," George told his sister.
"It’s cheap, but not the cheapest; it doesn’t compete with the
commonest little cars, nor, on the other hand, with even the moderately
expensive ones. It’s got a place of its own in between, where
there are millions of people that can afford a little better car
than the cheapest, but wouldn’t dream of a luxurious one like
the ‘Morgan.’ It was an inspiration of Dan’s to set the price
of the ‘Ornaby’ at eight hundred and eighty-five dollars. I like
the sense of adventure you get in a game like this. I like getting
out of my New York, and I like the way things move in a place
so friendly as this. It’s immensely alive, but somehow it does
manage to be friendly, too. I don’t understand why you’ve always
hated it so."</p>

<p>She explained that she had hated it less when she was in Europe,
where she had at last got her year, having taken young Henry with
her in spite of her husband’s strong protest. The mother and son
had just returned. "I think I could stand the place perfectly
well, George," she said, "if I were quite sure I’d never have
to see it again!"</p>

<p>"But don’t you begin to understand <em>yet</em> what a husband
you’ve got?" George cried. "Why, he’s a great man, Lena!"</p>

<p>Lena laughed and looked at him pityingly; but contented herself
with that for argument. To her mind Dan was not made great by
becoming the great figure of a city that was merely growing larger,
noisier, and dirtier. She had never cared for anything but Beauty,
she said; and, to her mind, as to that of the fastidious Harlan,
Dan was only helping to increase hideousness; so she joined her
brother-in-law in habitually referring to "Ornaby the Beautiful"
as "Ornaby the Horrible." Moreover, although she had never manifested
any interest in National Avenue before its destruction began,
she became almost vehement upon the subject of its merit as the
razing of its old houses continued; and Harlan was again in agreement
with her here.</p>

<p>"You and Eugene Morgan and that rascally old Sheridan and your
Jew friends are doing an awful thing," he said to Dan at a family
dinner. "You’re ruining the one decent thing the city possessed—a
splendid, dignified old street. It’s happening all over the country—one
doesn’t need half an hour in New York to see that Fifth Avenue
is ruined; but I did think we might have escaped here. I doubt
if it would ever have occurred to Morgan to put up his awful sales
building—with a repair shop in it!—on National Avenue, if you
hadn’t done it first. Then the others thought they had to follow;
and if something isn’t done to stop you fellows, the whole avenue
will be nothing but a mile row of motor-car sales buildings and
pneumatic tire warehouses and garages—a market!—and with hundred-foot
smoke-stacks! It may reach even here to our old house and the
Shelbys’; and already you’ve made the peaceful neighbourhood around
<em>my</em> house horrible. I’d like to know what grandma Savage
would have said about the things you people have done to this
town! Why, you’ve made National Avenue begin to look like an old
pipe-smoking hag’s mouth with every other tooth missing and the
rest sticking up all black in the smoke."</p>

<p>Dan laughed absent-mindedly, but remained impervious. Like the
ardent Sheridan, he loved the smoke, called it "Prosperity," and
drew his lungs full of it, breathing in it the glory of his city.
More and more, the city became his city, and with all his juggling
and tight-rope dancing he found time to be mayor of it for a year,
and to begin the "Park System" that was afterwards to bring so
much beauty to it. One day he drove his father over the ground
he had planned to include in this chain of groves and meadows;
and he was glad afterwards that they had made the excursion together.</p>

<p>"It’ll be a great thing for the city," his father said, as Dan’s
car turned homeward with them. "It’s a great thing for you to
do and to be remembered by. You were a good boy, Dan; and you’re
a good man and a good citizen. You serve your fellow-men well,
I think."</p>

<p>Dan laughed, a little embarrassed by this praise; but although
Mr. Oliphant perceived his son’s embarrassment, he had more to
say, and went on with something like timidity, yet with a gentle
persistence: "I’d like to tell you another thing, Dan. It’s something
your mother and I never felt we ought to talk about to you, but
I believe I’ll mention it to you to-day. We—you see your mother
and I have always thought there’s a danger sometimes in letting
a person see that you sympathize with him, because it might make
him feel that he’s unhappy, or in trouble, whereas, if you just
leave him to himself he may go on cheerfully enough and never
think about it. But I <em>would</em> like to tell you—I’d like
to say——"</p>

<p>He paused, and Dan asked: "You’d like to say what, sir?"</p>

<p>"Well—I’d like just to tell you that your mother and I think
you’ve always been as kind as you could to Lena."</p>

<p>Surprised, Dan stared at him; and Mr. Oliphant gravely and affectionately
returned his look. "Yes, sir," the son said awkwardly. "I hope
so. Thank you, sir." And he thought that the handsome, kind old
face seemed whiter and more fragile than usual.</p>

<p>That was natural, Dan told himself; people couldn’t help growing
old, and they grew whiter and thinner as age came upon them; but
age didn’t necessarily mean ill-health. For that matter, his father
hadn’t nearly reached a really venerable old age; he was more
than a decade younger than old-hickory Shelby, who still never
missed a day’s work. Nevertheless, there had been something a
little disquieting in Mr. Oliphant’s manner; it was as if he had
thought that perhaps he might never have another chance to say
what he had said;—and that night, on the train to which he had
hurried after their drive, Dan thought about his father often.</p>

<p>He thought about him often, too, the next day, in New York; and
during the conferences there with the landscape architects who
were designing the new parks, his thoughts went uneasily westward;—not
to the green stretches of grove and sward that were to be, but
to the quiet old man who had walked so slowly between the tall
white gateposts after bidding his son good-bye. Recalling this,
it seemed to Dan that he had never before seen him walk so slowly;
and he went over in his mind, for the fiftieth time, his father’s
manner in speaking of Lena—the slight, timid insistence, as if
there might never be another opportunity to say something he had
always wished to say. It had given what he said the air of a blessing
bestowed—and of a valedictory.</p>

<p>Thus Dan’s vague uneasiness grew, and although he scolded himself
for it, and told himself he was imaginative beyond reason, he
could not be rid of it. That was well for him; since such uneasiness
may be of help when life is like a path whereon tigers leap from
nowhere, as it is, sometimes;—the wayfarer will not avoid wounds,
but may better survive them for having been in some expectance
of them.</p>

<p>For a year Mr. Oliphant’s heart had been "not just what it ought
to be"; but he told no one that this was his physician’s report
to him. Harlan’s telegram reached New York just as Dan was starting
home. Mr. Oliphant had indeed taken his last opportunity to say
what he had so long wished to say, for now the kind heart beat
no longer;—but he had died proud of his son. </p>
