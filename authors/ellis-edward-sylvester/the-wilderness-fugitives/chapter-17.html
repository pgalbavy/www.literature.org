<p>Up to that time the fugitives, although steadily drifting down
stream, seemed to keep directly in the way of the parties whom
they were seeking to avoid; for, no matter where they headed,
or at what point they aimed, they were sure to find some of the
Iroquois waiting to receive them. It looked, indeed, as if the
redmen were shrewd enough to make allowance for this fact, judging
from the way the attempt turned out in each instance. It was the
purpose of Lena-Wingo, in heading up stream, to break through
this chain that seemed thrown around them, and there appeared
no other way of doing it.</p>

<p>Neither to the right nor left turned he, but swinging his paddle
powerfully and noiselessly, he drove the deeply-laden canoe against
the current with a force that sent the water foaming from the
prow, the soft wash and rustle of the current being the only noise
that marked this bird-like flight. Going at such a rate, he did
not need much time to pass over considerable space, and he was
still forging ahead in the same swift fashion when he caught the
sound of another paddle. This, then, was proof that the pursuers
did not care to wait till the fugitives should land, but had sent
some of their warriors out to search for them.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo recognized the sound as coming from the shore which
he meant to reach, but at some distance below them, which fact
was proof of his wisdom in taking the course he did. He kept up
his flight without the least cessation, and had every reason to
hope that the Iroquois were outwitted, when he was more angered
than alarmed by hearing the sweep of still another paddle&mdash;this
time coming from a point above where he was, but on the same side
of the river as the former. The Iroquois were making the hunt
hotter than he anticipated. The Mohawk stopped paddling and looked
around in the gloom that shut down on every hand, for there was
cause to expect the appearance of other boats, and it was necessary
to watch where his own craft was going.</p>

<p>"We have got along very well so far," said Jo, who, not having
noticed the evidence of their pursuit, supposed their friend had
merely paused to take his bearings.</p>

<p>"Pretty well," assented the Mohawk, speaking in the lowest key
and scanning the stream in every direction.</p>

<p>"Do you think they know where we are?" continued the young scout.</p>

<p>"Know we on river&mdash;they find us."</p>

<p>Upon hearing these alarming words, Rosa Minturn straightened
up and peered anxiously about, impelled thereto by the manner,
more than the utterance, of the leader.</p>

<p>"I think I hear the sound of another paddle," she said in a whisper,
turning inquiringly to the Indian.</p>

<p>"Yes, two boats on water; looking for us; maybe find us."</p>

<p>"In which direction is this last one that Rosa noticed, and which
I also hear?" asked Ned Clinton, in the same guarded tone.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo answered by pointing toward the shore a little above
a spot opposite where they were lying in the stream.</p>

<p>"Right there&mdash;he go 'bout&mdash;look for us."</p>

<p>"Yes, and I see him, too!" added Rosa, the next instant.</p>

<p>"There he come!" added the Mohawk, making the discovery at the
same moment. "Stoop down, quick! must not see you! Put head low
down, so can't see you&mdash;make no noise."</p>

<p>His command was obeyed at once. The other canoe having approached
near enough to be seen itself, was sure to discover the boat.
The heads of Ned Clinton and of the brother and sister were instantly
lowered, so that they could not be seen from the outside, and
they waited with throbbing hearts for the issue. The occupants
of the strange boat descried the Mohawk almost as soon as he saw
them, and as he expected they headed straight toward him. The
action of Lena-Wingo depended for success on its very boldness,
and he went at it with as much coolness and self-possession as
if failure was impossible.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo, being a Mohawk, was also an Iroquois, as much as
if he were a member of the Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, or Seneca
branch of the powerful confederation known as the Six Nations.
His intention was to assume the character of a genuine enemy of
the white race, and to answer whatever questions were put to him
in a way to mislead their foes. Still, this trick had been played
so often by him, that it required all the skill of which he was
master. It was necessary also that he should not permit the strange
canoe to come too near, else the deception would be detected.</p>

<p>As the boat drew nigh, he kept up a slight movement of his paddle,
which caused the craft to glide in a slanting direction from the
other.</p>

<p>"Where are the pale faces?" asked one of the four Iroquois who
sat in the new boat, while the couple were separated by two or
three rods.</p>

<p>"How should Magawan know?" asked the Mohawk in return, in a surly
voice, as if angry that the question was put to him. "The warriors
on the land are squaws, and they do not know how to look for the
traitor and the pale faces. They have let them go again."</p>

<p>These words were spoken in the Indian tongue, the accent as clear
as that of those who addressed him. There was truth and sense
in what Lena-Wingo said, for it was this very suspicion that the
Indians were not doing as well as they should that led to the
canoe being launched from the other side.</p>

<p>"But they called to us that Lena-Wingo was on the river in a
canoe," said one of the new-comers, sidling up toward the Mohawk,
who was as cautiously sidling away from him.</p>

<p>"They spoke the truth if they said the pale faces have gone off
again. I am looking for them."</p>

<p>"Why does Magawan look for them this way?"</p>

<p>"To find them," was the quick response. "Are you searching for
them?"</p>

<p>"We have been sent out by Taunwaso, the great chief of the Oneidas,
to find Lena-Wingo, the traitor, and the whites."</p>

<p>"Why don't you find them, then? If they are not here they are
somewhere else. Go there and find them."</p>

<p>And, as if he were tired of the conversation, the Mohawk dipped
his paddle lower than before, and deliberately paddled away from
his questioners. The surliness of the repulse made it quite effective,
and the four Iroquois sat for several minutes as if undecided
what they ought to do after such an interview.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo knew that he was in great peril, for he believed from
the first that the others were not satisfied with the appearance
of things. He shaped his action on the supposition that they would
speedily detect the trick and start in pursuit. He kept up the
river until he had gone far enough to screen his movements, when
he made a sharp bend in the course he was following, and headed
for the bank on his right. There was another canoe that was also
hunting for them, as will be remembered, and, in case these two
should meet, the whole truth would become known at once. Lena-Wingo
was not mistaken in his suspicion that he heard the two boats
at the same time, showing that they were not only very near, but
drawing nearer every minute.</p>

<p>While the Mohawk was paddling in this fashion, striving to make
his landing-place as far up stream as he could, he knew the two
canoes had joined and that the hottest kind of a hunt was on foot.
But there was not a great deal of water between him and the shore,
and he quickly made it still less.</p>

<p>"Raise head now&mdash;make no noise!" he said, as the water foamed
again from the bow of the canoe.</p>

<p>As the fugitives obeyed, they saw they were close to the bank,
and the limbs of the overhanging trees were within their reach.
Lena-Wingo kept along the shore for some distance further, when
one turn of the paddle sent the canoe in so sharply against the
bank that it stuck fast, and all were forced forward by the sudden
stoppage. The Susquehanna was crossed at last.</p>
