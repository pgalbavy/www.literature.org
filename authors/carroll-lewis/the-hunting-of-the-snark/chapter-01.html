               "Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,<br />
               As he landed his crew with care;<br />
               Supporting each man on the top of the tide<br />
               By a finger entwined in his hair.
          <P>
               "Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:<br />
               That alone should encourage the crew.<br />
               Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:<br />
               What i tell you three times is true."
          <P>
               The crew was complete: it included a Boots--<br />
               A maker of Bonnets and Hoods--<br />
               A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes--<br />
               And a Broker, to value their goods.
          <P>
               A Billiard-maker, whose skill was immense,<br />
               Might perhaps have won more than his share--<br />
               But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<br />
               Had the whole of their cash in his care.
          <P>
               There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<br />
               Or would sit making lace in the bow:<br />
               And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<br />
               Though none of the sailors knew how.
          <P>
               There was one who was famed for the number of things<br />
               He forgot when he entered the ship:<br />
               His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br />
               And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
          <P>
               He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br />
               With his name painted clearly on each:<br />
               But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<br />
               They were all left behind on the beach.
          <P>
               The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br />
               He had seven coats on when he came,<br />
               With three pairs of boots--but the worst of it was,<br />
               He had wholly forgotten his name.
          <P>
               He would answer to "Hi!" or to any loud cry,<br />
               Such as "Fry me!" or "Fritter my wig!"<br />
               To "What-you-may-call-um!" or "What-was-his-name!"<br />
               But especially "Thing-um-a-jig!"
          <P>
               While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br />
               He had different names from these:<br />
               His intimate friends called him "Candle-ends,"<br />
               And his enemies "Toasted-cheese."
          <P>
               "His form in ungainly--his intellect small--"<br />
               (So the Bellman would often remark)<br />
               "But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,<br />
               Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."
          <P>
               He would joke with hyenas, returning their stare<br />
               With an impudent wag of the head:<br />
               And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,<br />
               "Just to keep up its spirits," he said.
          <P>
               He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late--<br />
               And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad--<br />
               He could only bake Bridecake--for which, I may state,<br />
               No materials were to be had.
          <P>
               The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br />
               Though he looked an incredible dunce:<br />
               He had just one idea--but, that one being "Snark,"<br />
               The good Bellman engaged him at once.
          <P>
               He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br />
               When the ship had been sailing a week,<br />
               He could only kill Beavers. The Bellman looked scared,<br />
               And was almost too frightened to speak:
          <P>
               But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br />
               There was only one Beaver on board;<br />
               And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br />
               Whose death would be deeply deplored.
          <P>
               The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br />
               Protested, with tears in its eyes,<br />
               That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br />
               Could atone for that dismal surprise!
          <P>
               It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br />
               Conveyed in a separate ship:<br />
               But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br />
               With the plans he had made for the trip:
          <P>
               Navigation was always a difficult art,<br />
               Though with only one ship and one bell:<br />
               And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br />
               Undertaking another as well.
          <P>
               The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure<br />
               A second-hand dagger-proof coat--<br />
               So the Baker advised it-- and next, to insure<br />
               Its life in some Office of note:
          <P>
               This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire<br />
               (On moderate terms), or for sale,<br />
               Two excellent Policies, one Against Fire,<br />
               And one Against Damage From Hail.
          <P>
               Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<br />
               Whenever the Butcher was by,<br />
               The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<br />
               And appeared unaccountably shy.
