<p>He came to with a start.  His mouth was dry and hard, his heart
beat heavily, but he had not the energy to get up.  His heart beat
heavily.  Where was he? - the barracks - at home?  There was
something knocking.  And, making an effort, he looked round - trees,
and litter of greenery, and reddish, bright, still pieces of
sunshine on the floor.  He did not believe he was himself, he did
not believe what he saw.  Something was knocking.  He made a
struggle towards consciousness, but relapsed.  Then he struggled
again.  And gradually his surroundings fell into relationship with
himself.  He knew, and a great pang of fear went through his heart.
Somebody was knocking.  He could see the heavy, black rags of a fir
tree overhead.  Then everything went black.  Yet he did not believe
he had closed his eyes.  He had not.  Out of the blackness sight
slowly emerged again.  And someone was knocking.  Quickly, he saw
the blood-disfigured face of his Captain, which he hated.  And he
held himself still with horror.  Yet, deep inside him, he knew that
it was so, the Captain should be dead.  But the physical delirium
got hold of him.  Someone was knocking.  He lay perfectly still, as
if dead, with fear.  And he went unconscious.</p>

<p>When he opened his eyes again, he started, seeing something
creeping swiftly up a tree-trunk.  It was a little bird.  And the
bird was whistling overhead.  Tap-tap-tap - it was the small, quick
bird rapping the tree-trunk with its beak, as if its head were a
little round hammer.  He watched it curiously.  It shifted sharply,
in its creeping fashion.  Then, like a mouse, it slid down the bare
trunk.  Its swift creeping sent a flash of revulsion through him.
He raised his head.  It felt a great weight.  Then, the little bird
ran out of the shadow across a still patch of sunshine, its little
head bobbing swiftly, its white legs twinkling brightly for a
moment.  How neat it was in its build, so compact, with pieces of
white on its wings.  There were several of them.  They were so
pretty - but they crept like swift, erratic mice, running here and
there among the beech-mast.</p>

<p>He lay down again exhausted, and his consciousness lapsed.  He had
a horror of the little creeping birds.  All his blood seemed to be
darting and creeping in his head.  And yet he could not move.</p>

<p>He came to with a further ache of exhaustion.  There was the pain
in his head, and the horrible sickness, and his inability to move.
He had never been ill in his life.  He did not know where he was or
what he was.  Probably he had got sunstroke.  Or what else? - he had
silenced the Captain for ever - some time ago - oh, a long time ago.
There had been blood on his face, and his eyes had turned upwards.
It was all right, somehow.  It was peace.  But now he had got
beyond himself.  He had never been here before.  Was it life, or
not life?  He was by himself.  They were in a big, bright place,
those others, and he was outside.  The town, all the country, a big
bright place of light: and he was outside, here, in the darkened
open beyond, where each thing existed alone.  But they would all
have to come out there sometime, those others.  Little, and left
behind him, they all were.  There had been father and mother and
sweetheart.  What did they all matter?  This was the open land.</p>

<p>He sat up.  Something scuffled.  It was a little, brown squirrel
running in lovely, undulating bounds over the floor, its red tail
completing the undulation of its body - and then, as it sat up,
furling and unfurling.  He watched it, pleased.  It ran on again,
friskily, enjoying itself.  It flew wildly at another squirrel,
and they were chasing each other, and making little scolding,
chattering noises.  The soldier wanted to speak to them.  But only
a hoarse sound came out of his throat.  The squirrels burst away - 
they flew up the trees.  And then he saw the one peeping round at
him, half-way up a tree-trunk.  A start of fear went through him,
though, in so far as he was conscious, he was amused.  It still
stayed, its little, keen face staring at him halfway up the tree-
trunk, its little ears pricked up, its clawey little hands clinging
to the bark, its white breast reared.  He started from it in panic.</p>

<p>Struggling to his feet, he lurched away.  He went on walking,
walking, looking for something - for a drink.  His brain felt hot
and inflamed for want of water.  He stumbled on.  Then he did not
know anything.  He went unconscious as he walked.  Yet he stumbled
on, his mouth open.</p>

<p>When, to his dumb wonder, he opened his eyes on the world again, he
no longer tried to remember what it was.  There was thick, golden
light behind golden-green glitterings, and tall, grey-purple
shafts, and darknesses further off, surrounding him, growing
deeper.  He was conscious of a sense of arrival.  He was amid the
reality, on the real, dark bottom.  But there was the thirst
burning in his brain.  He felt lighter, not so heavy.  He supposed
it was newness.  The air was muttering with thunder.  He thought he
was walking wonderfully swiftly and was coming straight to relief - 
or was it to water?</p>

<p>Suddenly he stood still with fear.  There was a tremendous flare of
gold, immense - just a few dark trunks like bars between him and it.
All the young level wheat was burnished gold glaring on its silky
green.  A woman, full-skirted, a black cloth on her head for head-
dress, was passing like a block of shadow through the glistening,
green corn, into the full glare.  There was a farm, too, pale blue
in shadow, and the timber black.  And there was a church spire,
nearly fused away in the gold.  The woman moved on, away from him.
He had no language with which to speak to her.  She was the bright,
solid unreality.  She would make a noise of words that would
confuse him, and her eyes would look at him without seeing him.
She was crossing there to the other side.  He stood against a tree.</p>

<p>When at last he turned, looking down the long, bare grove whose
flat bed was already filling dark, he saw the mountains in a
wonder-light, not far away, and radiant.  Behind the soft, grey
ridge of the nearest range the further mountains stood golden and
pale grey, the snow all radiant like pure, soft gold.  So still,
gleaming in the sky, fashioned pure out of the ore of the sky, they
shone in their silence.  He stood and looked at them, his face
illuminated.  And like the golden, lustrous gleaming of the snow he
felt his own thirst bright in him.  He stood and gazed, leaning
against a tree.  And then everything slid away into space.</p>

<p>During the night the lightning fluttered perpetually, making the
whole sky white.  He must have walked again.  The world hung livid
round him for moments, fields a level sheen of grey-green light,
trees in dark bulk, and the range of clouds black across a white
sky.  Then the darkness fell like a shutter, and the night was
whole.  A faint flutter of a half-revealed world, that could not
quite leap out of the darkness! - Then there again stood a sweep of
pallor for the land, dark shapes looming, a range of clouds hanging
overhead.  The world was a ghostly shadow, thrown for a moment upon
the pure darkness, which returned ever whole and complete.</p>

<p>And the mere delirium of sickness and fever went on inside him - 
his brain opening and shutting like the night - then sometimes
convulsions of terror from something with great eyes that stared
round a tree - then the long agony of the march, and the sun
decomposing his blood - then the pang of hate for the Captain,
followed by a pang of tenderness and ease.  But everything was
distorted, born of an ache and resolving into an ache.</p>

<p>In the morning he came definitely awake.  Then his brain flamed
with the sole horror of thirstiness!  The sun was on his face, the
dew was steaming from his wet clothes.  Like one possessed, he got
up.  There, straight in front of him, blue and cool and tender, the
mountains ranged across the pale edge of the morning sky.  He
wanted them - he wanted them alone - he wanted to leave himself and
be identified with them.  They did not move, they were still soft,
with white, gentle markings of snow.  He stood still, mad with
suffering, his hands crisping and clutching.  Then he was twisting
in a paroxysm on the grass.</p>

<p>He lay still, in a kind of dream of anguish.  His thirst seemed to
have separated itself from him, and to stand apart, a single
demand.  Then the pain he felt was another single self.  Then there
was the clog of his body, another separate thing.  He was divided
among all kinds of separate beings.  There was some strange,
agonized connection between them, but they were drawing further
apart.  Then they would all split.  The sun, drilling down on him,
was drilling through the bond.  Then they would all fall, fall
through the everlasting lapse of space.  Then again, his
consciousness reasserted itself.  He roused on to his elbow and
stared at the gleaming mountains.  There they ranked, all still and
wonderful between earth and heaven.  He stared till his eyes went
black, and the mountains, as they stood in their beauty, so clean
and cool, seemed to have it, that which was lost in him.</p>
