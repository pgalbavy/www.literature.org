<p>There was no acknowledgment of his note to Jacqueline the day
following; none the next day, or the next. It was only when telephoning
to Silverwood he learned by chance from Mrs. Quant that Jacqueline
had been at the house every day as usual, busy in the armoury
with the work that took her there.</p>

<p>He had fully expected that she would send a substitute; had assumed
that she would not wish to return and take the chance of his being
there.</p>

<p>What she had thought of his note to her, what she might be thinking
of him, had made him so miserable that even the unwisdom of excess
could not dull the pain of it or subdue the restless passion ever
menacing him with a shameful repudiation of the words he had written
her. He had fought one weakness with another, and there was no
strength in him now. He knew it, but stood on guard.</p>

<p>For he knew, too, in his heart that he had nothing to offer her
except a sentiment which, in the history of man, has never been
anything except temporary. With it, of course, and part of it,
was a gentler inclination&mdash;love, probably, of one sort or another&mdash;with
it went also genuine admiration and intellectual interest, and
sympathy, and tenderness of some unanalysed kind.</p>

<p>But he knew that he had no intention of marrying anybody&mdash;never,
at least, of marrying out of his own social environment. That
he understood fully; had wit and honesty enough to admit to himself.
And so there was no way&mdash;nothing, now, anyway. He had settled
that definitely&mdash;settled it for her and for himself, unrequested;
settled, in fact, everything except how to escape the aftermath
of restless pain for which there seemed to be no remedy so far&mdash;not
even the professional services of old Doctor Time. However, it
had been only three days&mdash;three sedative pills from the old gentleman's
inexhaustible supply. It is the regularity of taking it, more
than the medicine itself which cures.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, he emerged from the unhappy seclusion of his
rooms and ventured into the Olympian Club, where he deliberately
attempted to an√¶sthetise his badly battered senses. But he couldn't.
Cairns found him there, sitting alone in the library&mdash;it was not
an intellectual club&mdash;and saw what Desboro had been doing to himself
by the white tensity of his features.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "If there's really anything the matter
with you, why don't you go into business and forget it? You can't
fool real trouble with what you buy in bottles!"</p>

<p>"What business shall I go into?" asked Desboro, unoffended.</p>

<p>"Stocks or literature. All the ginks who can't do anything else
go into stocks or literature."</p>

<p>Desboro waved away the alternatives with amiable urbanity.</p>

<p>"Then run for your farms and grow things for market. You could
do that, couldn't you? Even a Dutchess County millionaire can
run a milk-route."</p>

<p>"I don't desire to grow milk," explained Desboro pleasantly.</p>

<p>Cairns regarded him with a grin of anxiety.</p>

<p>"You're jingled," he concluded. "That is, you are as jingled
as <em>you</em> ever get. Why?"</p>

<p>"No reason, thanks."</p>

<p>"It isn't some girl, is it? <em>You</em> never take them seriously.
All the same, <em>is</em> it?"</p>

<p>Desboro smiled: "Do you think it's likely, dear friend?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. But whatever you're worrying about isn't improving
your personal beauty. Since you hit this hamlet you've been on
one continuous tootlebat. Why don't you go back to Westchester
and hoe potatoes?"</p>

<p>"One doesn't hoe them in January, you know," said Desboro, always
deprecatingly polite. "Please cease to trouble yourself about
me. I'm quite all right, thanks."</p>

<p>"You've resigned from a lot of clubs and things, I hear."</p>

<p>"Admirably reported, dear friend, and perfectly true."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Motives of economy; nothing more serious, John."</p>

<p>"You're not in any financial trouble, are you?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>ah&mdash;possibly have been a trifle indiscreet in my
expenditures&mdash;a little unfortunate in my investments, perhaps.
You are very kind to ask me. It may afford you some gratification
to learn that eventually I anticipate an agreeable return to affluence."</p>

<p>Cairns laughed: "You <em>are</em> jingled all right," he said.
"I recognise the urbane symptoms of your Desboro ancestors."</p>

<p>"You flatter them and me," said Desboro, bowing. "They were the
limit, and I'm nearing it."</p>

<p>"Pardon! You have arrived, sir," said Cairns, returning the salute
with exaggerated gravity.</p>

<p>They parted with pomp and circumstance, Desboro to saunter back
to his rooms and lie limply in his arm chair beside an empty fireplace
until sleep overcame him where he sat. And he looked very young,
and white, and somewhat battered as he lay there in the fading
winter daylight.</p>

<p>The ringing racket of his telephone bell aroused him in total
darkness. Still confused by sleep, he groped for the electric
light switch, could not find it; but presently his unsteady hand
encountered the telephone, and he unhooked the receiver and set
it to his ear.</p>

<p>At first his imagination lied to him, and he thought it was Jacqueline's
distant voice, though he knew in his heart it could not be.</p>

<p>"Jim," repeated the voice, "what are you doing this evening?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I was asleep. It's you, Elena, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course. To whom are you in the habit of talking every evening
at seven by special request?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was seven."</p>

<p>"That's flattering to me. Listen, Jim, I'm coming to see you."</p>

<p>"I've told you a thousand times it can't be done&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that no woman has ever been in your apartments?"</p>

<p>"You can't come," he repeated obstinately. "If you do, it ends
my interest in your various sorrows. I mean it, Elena."</p>

<p>She laughed: "I only wanted to be sure that you are still afraid
of caring too much for me. Somebody told me a very horrid thing
about you. It was probably a lie&mdash;as long as you are still afraid
of me."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes patiently and leaned his elbow on the desk,
waiting for her to go on or to ring off.</p>

<p>"Was it a lie, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Was what a lie?"</p>

<p>"That you are entertaining a very pretty girl at Silverwood House&mdash;unchaperoned?"</p>

<p>"Do you think it likely?"</p>

<p>"Why not? They say you've done it before."</p>

<p>"Nobody has been there except on business. And, after all, you
know, it doesn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it does concern me! Oh, Jim, <em>are</em> you being horrid&mdash;when
I'm so unhappy and helpless&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Be careful what you say over the wire!"</p>

<p>"I don't care who hears me. If you mean anybody in your apartment
house, they know my voice already. I want to see you, Jim&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"You said you'd be friendly to me!"</p>

<p>"I am&mdash;by keeping away from you."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that I am never to see you at all?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough that it isn't best, under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"You could come here if you only would. He is not in town to-night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Confound it, do you think I'm that sort?"</p>

<p>"I think you are very absurd and not very consistent, considering
the things that they say you are not too fastidious to do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Will you please be a little more reticent over the telephone!"</p>

<p>"Then take me out to dinner somewhere, where we <em>can</em>
talk!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but it won't do."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd say that. Very well, then, listen: they are
singing <em>Ariane</em> to-night; it's an 8:15 curtain. I'll be
in the Barkley's box very early; nobody else will arrive before
nine. Will you come to me at eight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll do that for a moment."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear. I just want to be happy for a few minutes.
You don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"It will be very jolly," he said vaguely.</p>

<p>The galleries were already filling, but there were very few people
in the orchestra and nobody at all to be seen in the boxes when
Desboro paused before a door marked with the Barkleys' name. After
a second's hesitation, he turned the knob, stepped in, and found
Mrs. Clydesdale already seated in the tiny foyer, under the hanging
shadow of her ermine coat&mdash;a charming and youthful figure, eyes
and cheeks bright with trepidation and excitement.</p>

<p>"What the dickens do you suppose prompted Mrs. Hammerton to arrive
at such an hour?" she said, extending her hand to Desboro. "That
very wicked old cat got out of somebody's car just as I did, and
I could feel her beady eyes boring into my back all the way up
the staircase."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Aunt Hannah?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! What does she mean by coming here at such an unearthly
hour? Don't go out into the box, Jim. She can see you from the
orchestra. I'll wager that her opera glasses have been sweeping
the house every second since she saw me!"</p>

<p>"If she sees me she won't talk," he said, coolly. "I'm one of
her exempts&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Wait, Jim! What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Let her see us both. I tell you she never talks about me, or
anybody with whom I happen to be. It's the best way to avoid gossip,
Elena&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't want to risk it, Jim! Please don't! I'm in abject terror
of that woman&#11834;"</p>

<p>But Desboro had already stepped out to the box, and his keen,
amused eyes very soon discovered the levelled glasses of Mrs.
Hammerton.</p>

<p>"Come here, Elena!"</p>

<p>"Had I better?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. I want her to see you. That's it! That's enough.
She won't say a word about you now."</p>

<p>Mrs. Clydesdale shrank back into the dim, rosy half-light of
the box; Desboro looked down at Mrs. Hammerton and smiled; then
rejoined his flushed companion.</p>

<p>"Don't worry; Aunt Hannah's fangs are extracted for this evening.
Elena, you are looking pretty enough to endanger the record of
an aged saint! There goes that meaningless overture! What is it
you have to say to me?"</p>

<p>"Why are you so brusque with me, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I'm not. But I don't want the Barkleys and their guests to find
us here together."</p>

<p>"Betty knows I care for you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he said impatiently. "You always did care for anything
that is just out of reach when you stand on tip-toe. You always
were that way, Elena. When we were free to see each other you
would have none of me."</p>

<p>She was looking down while he spoke, smoothing one silken knee
with her white-gloved hand. After a moment, she lifted her head.
To his surprise, her eyes were brilliant with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"You don't love me any more, do you, Jim?"</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I have&mdash;it is about as it always will be with me. Circumstances
have altered things."</p>

<p>"<em>Is</em> that all?"</p>

<p>He thought for a moment, and his eyes grew sombre.</p>

<p>"Jim! Are you going to marry somebody?" she said suddenly.</p>

<p>He looked up with a startled laugh, not entirely agreeable.</p>

<p>"Marry? No."</p>

<p>"Is there any girl you want to marry?"</p>

<p>"No. God forbid!"</p>

<p>"Why do you say that? Is it because of what you know about marriages&mdash;like
mine?"</p>

<p>"Probably. And then some."</p>

<p>"There are happy ones."</p>

<p>"Yes, I've read about them."</p>

<p>"But there really are, Jim."</p>

<p>"Mention one."</p>

<p>She mentioned several among people both knew. He smiled. Then
she said, wearily:</p>

<p>"There are plenty of decent people and decent marriages in the
world. The people we play with are no good. It's only restlessness,
idleness, and discontent that kills everything among people of
our sort. I know I'm that way, too. But I don't believe I would
be if I had married you."</p>

<p>"You are mistaken."</p>

<p>"Why? Don't you believe any marriage can be happy?"</p>

<p>"Elena, have you ever heard of a honeymoon that lasts? Do you
know how long any two people can endure each other without merciful
assistance from a third? Don't you know that, sooner or later,
any two people ever born are certain to talk each other out&mdash;pump
each other dry&mdash;love each other to satiation&mdash;and ultimately recoil,
each into the mysterious seclusion of its own individuality, from
whence it emerged temporarily in order that the human race might
not perish from the earth!"</p>

<p>"What miserable lesson have you learned to teach you such a creed?"
she asked. "I tell you the world is full of happy marriages&mdash;full
of honoured husbands and beloved wives, and children worshipped
and adored&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Children, yes, they come the nearest to making the conventional
contract endurable. I wish to God you had some!"</p>

<p>"Jim!"</p>

<p>He said, almost savagely: "If you <em>can</em>, and <em>don't</em>,
you'll make a hell for yourself with any man, sooner or later&mdash;mark
my words! And it isn't worth while to enact the hypocrisy of marriage
with nothing more than legal license in view! Why bother with
priest or clergyman? That contract won't last. And it's less trouble
not to make one at all than to go West and break one."</p>

<p>"Do you know you are talking very horridly to me?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I suppose I am. I've got to be going now, anyway&#11834;"</p>

<p>As he spoke, the glittering house became dark; the curtain opened
upon a dim scene of shadowy splendour, into which, exquisite and
bewitchingly immortal as any goddess in the heavenly galaxy, glided
Farrar, in the shimmering panoply of <em>Ariane</em>.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Desboro stood staring down at the magic picture.
Mrs. Clydesdale, too, had risen"]</p>

<p>Desboro stood staring down at the magic picture. Mrs. Clydesdale,
too, had risen. Below them the beauty of Farrar's matchless voice
possessed the vast obscurity, searching the darkness like a ray
of crystal light. One by one the stone crypts opened, disclosing
their tinted waterfalls of jewels.</p>

<p>"I've got to go," he whispered. "Your people will be arriving."</p>

<p>They moved silently to the door.</p>

<p>"Jim?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"There <em>is</em> no other woman; is there?"</p>

<p>"Not now."</p>

<p>"Oh! <em>Was</em> there?"</p>

<p>"There might have been."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;to&mdash;to marry?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then &mdash;I suppose I can't help <em>that</em> sort. Men are&mdash;that
way. Was it that girl at Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, lying.</p>

<p>"Oh! Who was that girl at Silverwood?"</p>

<p>"A business acquaintance."</p>

<p>"I hear she is unusually pretty."</p>

<p>"Yes, very."</p>

<p>"You found it necessary to be at Silverwood when she was there?"</p>

<p>"Once or twice."</p>

<p>"It is no longer necessary?"</p>

<p>"No longer necessary."</p>

<p>"So you won't see her again?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'm glad. It hurt, Jim. Some people I know at Willow Lake saw
her. They said she was unusually beautiful."</p>

<p>"Elena," he said, "will you kindly come to your senses? I'm not
going to marry anybody; but that doesn't concern you. I advise
you to attend to your own life's business&mdash;which is to have children
and bring them up more decently than the present generation are
being brought up in this fool of a town! If nothing else will
make your husband endurable, children will come nearest to it&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jim&mdash;please&#11834;"</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, don't cry!" he whispered.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>won't. Dear, don't you realise that you are all
I have in the world&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We haven't got each other, I tell you, and we're not going to
have each other&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;but don't take anybody else&mdash;marry anyone&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I won't. Control yourself!"</p>

<p>"Promise me!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Go forward into the box; those people will be arriving&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you want me to. Go forward; nobody can see you in the
dark. Good-bye&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Good-bye, dear. And thank you&#11834;"</p>

<p>He coolly ignored the upturned face; she caught his hand in a
flash of impatient passion, then, with a whispered word, turned
and went forward, mistress of herself again, to sit there for
an hour or two and witness a mystery that has haunted the human
heart for aeons, unexpressed.</p>

<p>On the fifth day, Desboro remained indoors and wrote business
letters until late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Toward evening he telephoned to Mrs. Quant to find out whether
everything was being done to render Miss Nevers's daily sojourn
at Silverwood House agreeable.</p>

<p>He learned that everything was being done, that the young lady
in question had just departed for New York, and, furthermore,
that she had inquired of Mrs. Quant whether Mr. Desboro was not
coming soon to Silverwood, desiring to be informed because she
had one or two business matters on which to consult him.</p>

<p>"Hold the wire," he said, and left it for a few moments' swift
pacing to and fro. Then he came again to the telephone.</p>

<p>"Ask Miss Nevers to be kind enough to write me about the matters
she has in mind, because I can not leave town at present."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. James. Are you well, sir?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. If you feel chilly like at night&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I don't. Good-night!"</p>

<p>He dressed, dined at the club, and remained there reading the
papers until he had enough of their complacent ignorance. Then
he went home, still doggedly refusing to attempt to analyse the
indirect message from Jacqueline.</p>

<p>If it had any significance other than its apparent purport, he
grimly refused to consider even such a possibility. And, deadly
weary at last, he fell asleep and slept until late in the morning.</p>

<p>It was snowing hard when he awoke. His ablutions ended, he rang
for breakfast. On his tray was a note from the girl in blue; he
read it and dropped it into his pocket, remembering the fireplace
sacrifice of a few days ago at Silverwood, and realising that
such frivolous souvenirs were beginning to accumulate again.</p>

<p>He breakfasted without interest, unfolded the morning paper,
glanced over the headlines, and saw that there was a little more
murder, divorce, and boot-licking than he cared for, laid it aside,
and lighted a cigarette. As he dropped the burnt match on the
tray, he noticed under it another letter which he had overlooked
among the bills and advertisements composing the bulk of the morning
mail.</p>

<p>For a little while he held the envelope in his hand, not looking
at it; then, with careless deliberation, he cut it open, using
a paper knife, and drew out the letter. As he slowly opened it
his hands shook in spite of him.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"MY <em>DEAR MR. DESBORO: I </em>telephoned Mrs. Quant last night and<br/>
learned that she had given you my message over the wire only a few<br/>
minutes before; and that you had sent word you could not come to<br/>
Silverwood, but that I might communicate with you by letter.

</p>
<p>
"This is what I had to say to you: There is a suit of armour here<br/>
which is in a very bad condition. It will be expensive to have it<br/>
repaired by a good armourer. Did you wish to include it in the<br/>
sale as it is, or have it repaired? It is No. 41 in the old list;<br/>
No. 69 in my catalogue, now almost completed and ready for the<br/>
printer. It is that rather unusual suit of black plate-mail,<br/>
called 'Brigandine Armour,' a XV century suit from Aragon; and the<br/>
quilted under-jacket has been ruined by moths and has gone<br/>
completely to pieces. It is a very valuable suit.

</p>
<p>
"Would you tell me what to do?

</p>
</div>
<p>  "Very sincerely yours,   "<em>JACQUELINE NEVERS</em>."</p>

<p>An hour later he still sat there with the letter in his hand,
gazing at nothing. And until the telephone beside him rang twice
he had not stirred.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he asked finally.</p>

<p>At the reply his face altered subtly, and he bowed his head to
listen.</p>

<p>The distant voice spoke again, and:</p>

<p>"Silverwood?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, here's your party."</p>

<p>An interval filled with a vague whirring, then:</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good-morning, Miss Nevers."</p>

<p>"Good-morning. Have you a note from me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you. It came this morning. I was just reading it&mdash;again."</p>

<p>"I thought I ought to consult you in such a matter."</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;what are your wishes?"</p>

<p>"My wishes are yours."</p>

<p>"I cannot decide such a matter. It will be very expensive&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If it is worth the cost to you, it is worth it to me."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean. The burden of decision lies with
you this time, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"With us both. Unless you wish me to assume it."</p>

<p>"But it <em>is</em> yours to assume!"</p>

<p>"If you wish, then. But I may ask your opinion, may I not?"</p>

<p>There was a silence, then:</p>

<p>"Whatever you do I approve. I have no&mdash;opinion."</p>

<p>"You do not approve <em>all</em> I do."</p>

<p>The rejoinder came faintly: "How do you know?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>wrote to you. Do you approve my writing to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. If <em>you</em> do."</p>

<p>"And do you approve of what I wrote?"</p>

<p>"Not of <em>all</em> that you wrote."</p>

<p>"I wrote that I would not see you again."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Do you think that is best?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>do not think about it."</p>

<p>He said: "That, also, is best. Don't think of it at all. And
about the armour, do exactly what you would do if you were in
my place. Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Could you wait a moment? I am trying to think&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't try, Jacqueline!"</p>

<p>"Please wait&mdash;for me!"</p>

<p>There was a silence; a tiny spot of blood reddened his bitten
lip before she spoke again; then:</p>

<p>"I wished to tell you something. I knew why you wrote. Is it
right for me to tell you that I understood you? I wanted to write
and say so, and&mdash;say something else&mdash;about how I felt&mdash;but it
seems I can't. Only&mdash;we could be friends more easily now&mdash;if you
wish."</p>

<p>"You have not understood!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have, Mr. Desboro. But we <em>can</em> be friends?"</p>

<p>"Could you be <em>mine</em>, after what I have written?"</p>

<p>"I thought I couldn't, at first. But that day was a&mdash;long one.
And when a girl is much alone she becomes very honest with herself.
And it all was entirely new to me. I didn't know what I ought
to have done about it&mdash;only what I wished to do."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;what is that, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Make things as they were&mdash;before&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Before I wrote?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All up to that time you wish might be again as it was? <em>All?</em>"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"All?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me. I don't know &mdash;I don't know what I think
any more."</p>

<p>"How deeply do you suppose I feel about it?"</p>

<p>"I did not know you felt anything very deeply."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, then her voice again:</p>

<p>"You know&mdash;you need not be afraid. I did not know enough to be
until you wrote. But I understand, now."</p>

<p>He said: "It will be all right, then. It will be quite all right,
Jacqueline. I'll come up on the noon train."</p>

<p>His car met him at the station. The snow had melted and the wet
macadam road glittered under a declining winter sun, as the car
rolled smoothly away through the still valleys of Westchester.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quant, in best bib and tucker and lilac ribbons, welcomed
him, and almost wept at his pallor; but he shrugged impatiently
and sprang up the low steps. Here the necessity for self-control
stopped him short on his way to the armoury. He turned to Mrs.
Quant with an effort:</p>

<p>"Is everything all right?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. James. Phibby broke a cup and saucer Saturday, and there
is new kittens in the laundry&mdash;which makes nine cats&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, all right! Miss Nevers is here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;in the liberry&mdash;which ain't been dusted right by that
Phibby minx&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tell Phoebe to dust it!" he said sternly. "Do you suppose Miss
Nevers cares to handle dirty books!" His restless glance fell
on the clock: "Tell Farris I'm here and that Miss Nevers and I
will lunch as soon as it's served. And say to Miss Nevers that
I'll be down in a few minutes." He turned and mounted the stairs
to his room, and found it full of white, clove-scented carnations.</p>

<p>Mrs. Quant came panting after him:</p>

<p>"Miss Nevers, she cut them in the greenhouse, and told me to
put 'em in your room, sayin' as how clove pinks is sanitary. Would
you&mdash;would you try a few m-m-magic drops, Mr. James, sir? Miss
Nevers takes 'em regular."</p>

<p>"Oh, Lord!" he exclaimed, laughing in sheer exuberance of spirits.
"I'll swallow anything you like, only hurry!"</p>

<p>She dosed him with great content, he, both hands in soap-suds,
turning his head to receive the potion. And at last, ablutions
finished, he ran down the stairs, checked himself, and managed
to stroll leisurely through the hall and into the library.</p>

<p>She was writing; looked up, suddenly pale under her golden crown
of hair; and the red lips quivered, but her eyes were steady.</p>

<p>She bent her head again, both hands abandoned to him, sitting
in silence while his lips rested against her fingers.</p>

<p>"Is all well with you, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And with you?"</p>

<p>"All is well with me. I missed you&mdash;if you know what that really
means."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Won't you even look at me?"</p>

<p>"In a moment. Do you see all these piles of manuscript? All that
is your new catalogue&mdash;and mine," she added, with a faint smile;
but her head remained averted.</p>

<p>"You wonderful girl!" he said softly. "You wonderful girl!"</p>

<p>"Thank you. It was a labor of&mdash;pleasure." Colour stole to the
tips of her ears. "I have worked&mdash;worked&mdash;every minute since&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Really, I have&mdash;every minute. But somehow, it didn't seem to
tire me. To-day&mdash;now &mdash;I begin to feel a little tired." She
rested her cheek on one hand, still looking away from him.</p>

<p>"I took a peep into the porcelain and jade rooms," she said,
"just a glance over what lies before me. Mrs. Quant very kindly
gave me the keys. Did you mind?"</p>

<p>"Do I mind anything that it pleases you to do? What did you find
in the jade room?"</p>

<p>She smiled: "Jadeite, of course; and lapis and crystals&mdash;the
usual."</p>

<p>"Any good ones?"</p>

<p>"Some are miracles. I don't really know, yet; I gave just one
swift glance and fled&mdash;because you see I haven't finished in the
armoury, and I ought not to permit myself the pleasures of curiosity."</p>

<p>"The pleasures of curiosity and of anticipation are the only
real ones. Sages have said it."</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>"Isn't it true?" he insisted.</p>

<p>She looked up at him at last, frank-eyed but flushed:</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Which is the real pleasure?' she asked"]</p>

<p>"Which is the real pleasure," she asked, "seeing each other,
or anticipating the&mdash;the resumption of the entente cordial?"</p>

<p>"You've smashed the sages and their philosophy," he nodded, studying
the exquisite, upturned features unsmilingly. "To be with you
is the greater&mdash;content. It's been a long time, hasn't it?"</p>

<p>She nodded thoughtfully: "Five days and a half."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;counted them, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>This wouldn't do. He rose and walked over to the fire, which
needed a log or two; she turned and looked after him with little
expression in her face except that the blue of her eyes had deepened
to a lilac tint, and the flush on her cheeks still remained.</p>

<p>"You know," she said, "I didn't mean to take you from any business
in New York&mdash;or pleasures&#11834;"</p>

<p>He shuddered slightly.</p>

<p>"Did I?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I only wished you to come&mdash;when you had time&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I know, Jacqueline. Don't show me your soul in every word you
utter."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>He turned on his heel and came back to her, and she shrank a
little, not knowing why; but he came no nearer than her desk.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'The thing to do,' he said ... 'is for us both
to keep very busy'"]</p>

<p>"The thing to do," he said, speaking with forced animation and
at random, "is for us both to keep very busy. I think I'll go
into farming&mdash;raise some dinky thing or other&mdash;that's what I'll
do. I'll go in for the country squire business&mdash;that's what I'll
do. And I'll have my neighbours in. I'm never here long enough
to ask 'em. They're a funny lot; they're all right, though&mdash;deadly
respectable. I'll give a few parties&mdash;ask some people from town,
too. Betty Barkley could run the conventional end of it. And you'd
come floating in with other unattached girls&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You want <em>me</em>!"</p>

<p>He said, astonished: "Well, why on earth do you suppose I'm taking
the trouble to ask the others?"</p>

<p>"You want <em>me</em>&mdash;to come&mdash;where your friends&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't you care to?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>don't know." The surprise of it still widened her
eyes and parted her lips a little. She looked up at him, perplexed,
encountered something in his eyes which made her cheeks redden
again.</p>

<p>"What would they think?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Is there anything to think?"</p>

<p>"N-no. But they don't know who I am. And I have nobody to vouch
for me."</p>

<p>"You ought to have a companion."</p>

<p>"I don't want any&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Of course; but you ought to have one. Can you afford one?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I don't know what they&mdash;they cost&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Let me fix that up," he said, with animation. "Let me think
it out. I know a lot of people &mdash;I know some indigent and
respectable old terrors who ought to fill the bill and hold their
tongues as long as their salary is paid&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't, Mr. Desboro!"</p>

<p>He seated himself on the arm of her chair:</p>

<p>"Jacqueline, dear, it's only for your sake&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I <em>did</em> understand your letter!"</p>

<p>"I know &mdash;I know. I just want to see you with other people.
I just want to have them see you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But I don't need a chaperon. Business women are understood,
aren't they? Even women whom you know go in for house decoration,
and cigarette manufacturing, and tea rooms, and hats and gowns."</p>

<p>"But they were socially known before they went in for these things.
It's the way of the world, Jacqueline&mdash;nothing but suspicion when
intelligence and beauty step forward from the ranks. And what
do you suppose would happen if a man of my sort attempts to vouch
for any woman?"</p>

<p>"Then don't&mdash;please don't try! I don't care for it&mdash;truly I don't.
It was nice of you to wish it, Mr. Desboro, but &mdash;I'd rather
be just what I am and&mdash;your friend."</p>

<p>"It can't be," he said, under his breath. But she heard him,
looked up dismayed, and remained mute, crimsoning to the temples.</p>

<p>"This oughtn't to go on," he said, doggedly.</p>

<p>She said: "You have not understood me. I am different from you.
You are not to blame for thinking that we are alike at heart;
but, nevertheless, it is a mistake. I can be what I will&mdash;not
what I once seemed to be&mdash;for a moment&mdash;with you&mdash;" Her head sank
lower and remained bowed; and he saw her slender hands tightening
on the arm of the chair.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I've got to be honest," she said under her breath.
"I've got to be&mdash;in every way. I know it perfectly well, Mr. Desboro.
Men seem to be different &mdash;I don't know why. But they seem
to be, usually. And all I want is to remain friends with you&mdash;and
to remember that we are friends when I am at work somewhere. I
just want to be what I am, a business woman with sufficient character
and intelligence to be your friend quietly&mdash;not even for one evening
in competition with women belonging to a different life&mdash;women
with wit and beauty and charm and savoir faire&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Jacqueline!" he broke out impulsively. "I want you to be my
guest here. Won't you let me arrange with some old gorgon to chaperon
you? I can do it! And with the gorgon's head on your moral shield
you can silence anybody!"</p>

<p>He began to laugh; she sat twisting her fingers on her lap and
looking up at him in a lovely, distressed sort of way, so adorably
perplexed and yet so pliable, so soft and so apprehensive, that
his laughter died on his lips, and he sat looking down at her
in silence.</p>

<p>After a while he spoke again, almost mechanically:</p>

<p>"I'm trying to think how we can best be on equal terms, Jacqueline.
That is all. After your work is done here, I want to see you here
and elsewhere &mdash;I want you to come back at intervals, as
my guest. Other people will ask you. Other people must be here,
too, when you are. I know some who will accept you on your merits&mdash;if
you are properly chaperoned. That is all I am thinking about.
It's fairer to you."</p>

<p>But even to himself his motive was not clear&mdash;only the rather
confused idea persisted that women in his own world knew how to
take care of themselves, whatever they chose to do about it&mdash;that
Jacqueline would stand a fairer chance with herself, and with
him, whatever his intentions might really be. It would be a squarer
deal, that was all.</p>

<p>She sat thinking, one slim forefinger crook'd under her chin;
and he saw her blue eyes deep in thought, and the errant lock
curling against her cheek. Then she raised her head and looked
at him:</p>

<p>"Do you think it best?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;you adorable little thing!"</p>

<p>She managed to sustain his gaze:</p>

<p>"Could you find a lady gorgon?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure I can. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>A moment later Farris announced luncheon. A swarm of cats greeted
them at the door, purring and waiving multi-coloured tails, and
escorted them to the table, from whence they knew came the delectable
things calculated to satisfy the inner cat.</p>
