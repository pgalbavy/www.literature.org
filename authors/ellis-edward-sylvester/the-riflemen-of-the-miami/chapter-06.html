And we knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this rare sternness had its softness too,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That woman's charm and grace upon his being wrought;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That underneath the armor of his breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were springs of tenderness, all quick to flow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In sympathy with childhood's joy or woe;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That children climbed his knees, and made his arms their rest.

<p>It was with a heart beating with more than one excessive emotion,
that Lewis Dernor, the Rifleman, plunged into the forest with
Edith Sudbury. None knew better than he the perils that threatened
them in those dim labyrinths, and none was better prepared to
encounter them. Were they twice as many, he would rather have
braved them than allowed Edith and Sego to meet before he had
declared his love to her.</p>

<p>In taking this step, the Rifleman had more than one twinge of
conscience, for he could but consider it of questionable propriety
in acting his part. Beyond a doubt, Sego and Edith were accepted
lovers, who had been separated for months, and it seemed cruel,
to say the least, thus to take advantage of their separation.
The more he reflected upon it, the more guilty did he feel, until
he formed the resolution to acquaint his fair charge with the
presence of her lover with the settlers, and then leave her own
heart to decide the matter.</p>

<p>The instant this resolve was formed, the honest-hearted hunter
felt better. What though the judgment should be against him, he
had done his duty, and this very fact gave him a pleasure which
nothing else could destroy. His great, all-absorbing love for
Edith had led him to use the artifice mentioned, in order to defer
the interview between her and Sego; but, great as was this master-passion,
it could lead him no further in deception than it had already
done. More than once he half determined to turn and make his way
back to the settlement, and was only prevented by a dread of the
speculation and remarks that such a proceeding would occasion
upon their part.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that Lewis doubted his ability to reach
the settlement in safety, with Edith. Had he known what danger
he was doomed to encounter, he would have retraced his steps instantly,
although he had commenced them with such a strong determination
to keep her and Sego separate for a time.</p>

<p>For an hour or so the journey progressed in silence upon the
part of the hunter and his charge. While, as might be expected,
his passion often led his gaze from the path he was pursuing,
still it made him doubly alive to the responsibilities resting
upon him, and increased his vigilance and watchfulness to a degree
that would have appeared absurd to an ordinary observer. Most
of the time, he kept a step or two in advance of Edith, trailing
his rifle in his left hand, while his form was half bent, and
his head projected forward, giving him the attitude of constant
and intense attention. His eyes were flitting constantly from
tree-top to ground, from side to side, ahead and behind him, kindling
with admiration and fire as they rested upon the form of his companion.
The latter was enveloped in a large shawl, a portion of which
covered her head, while her arms gathered the rest around her
person. Her face was inclined, so that she was not sensible of
the many ardent glances to which she was subjected. She stepped
lightly forward, her beautifully moccasined feet hardly disturbing
the leaves, among which they twinkled like some forest-flower.</p>

<p>Lewis had proposed to himself, when starting, to take the nearest
route to the settlement; but his apprehension for the safety of
Edith led him to change his intention after going a few miles.
The Indians which he had assisted so signally to repulse, he believed
would hover around the settlers so long as there remained an opportunity
to pick off any of them. They would not fail, too, to scour the
woods in search of smaller parties, and knowing the destination
of the emigrants, would select the very ground over which they
too were journeying. The Rifleman took the best course to avoid
them. Retracing his steps some distance, he turned off toward
the creek, he having concluded to ascend this for several miles,
and then take a circuitous route to the settlement, convinced
that, in this case, the longest way was the surest.</p>

<p>"Why this change of direction?" asked Edith, looking up in alarm,
as he turned and commenced retracing his steps.</p>

<p>"I think it best," he replied, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Have you discovered danger? Are we pursued?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of. But I have been thinking for some time that
if there <em>are</em> any Injins in this wood, this is the very
ground they will select to cut us off, because they know that
it is the one which we would naturally take, in making such a
journey as this."</p>

<p>"<em>I have full faith in you.</em>"</p>

<p>And the gallant Rifleman felt he would die before any act of
his should cause her to lose this faith in him. As she turned
her trusting blue eyes up to his, their heavenly light seemed
to fill his whole being, and he scarcely was conscious of what
he did when he reached out his hand, and said:</p>

<p>"Edith, let me take your hand."</p>

<p>"Why, what need is there of that?" she coyly asked, with a roguish
look, as she half complied and half hesitated.</p>

<p>"I shall feel safer&mdash;that is, I shall feel more certain of your
safety if I lead you."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, you may lead me then," and she slid her almost fairy
hand into his hard, horny palm, with a charming simplicity, which
made the hunter's heart leap with a painful pleasure. That little,
white member, as the Rifleman grasped it, was like the poles of
a battery. It sent a shock through every part of his system, and
gave his arm precisely the same tremor that takes place when a
person is charged through this limb with electricity. If Edith
had only returned the pressure, Lewis Dernor most assuredly would
never have been able to stand it, and, therefore, it was fortunate
that she did not.</p>

<p>It was this pressure, and the looks accompanying it, that made
Edith Sudbury conscious that the hunter loved her. She would have
been an exception to her sex had she not suspected this before.
The thousand and one acts, and little, airy nothings, had given
her a suspicion of the truth long since, but she had never felt
certain of it.</p>

<p>This knowledge, which must ever be pleasant and flattering to
the maiden, caused no unpleasant feelings on her part. If she
did not love him, she certainly respected and admired his noble
qualities, and the difference between the emotions named and love
itself is certainly too faint for recognition. Under almost any
circumstances they will grow into the passion, and all be lost
in blending. Respect is the scout and guide that leads love to
the soul.</p>

<p>The tell-tale blush stole on Edith's face, as a realizing sense
of her situation came upon her, and, for a long time, she dared
not look up, much less speak. Suddenly the Rifleman made a spring
in the air, and drew a deep breath, as though seized with a mortal
pain.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Edith, in a tremor of apprehension.</p>

<p>"Oh! it nearly killed me!" replied the hunter, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"What? Do tell me. Are you hurt? What caused it?"</p>

<p>"Why, Edith, <em>didn't you squeeze my hand</em>?"</p>

<p>"If I did, it was <em>certainly unintentional</em>."</p>

<p>"Never mind. I thought it was on purpose."</p>

<p>The merry, musical laugh of the maiden rung out through the forest-arches,
and the Rifleman, for the time, lost all thoughts of Indians and
danger; but this delightful forgetfulness could not last long.
As the faint rumble of thunder was heard in the distance, he started,
as though awakened from a dream, and looked furtively around him,
half expecting to see his dread foes start from behind the trees,
and rush upon him.</p>

<p>"Are you frightened?" asked Edith.</p>

<p>"Only for you," he replied, with a natural gallantry.</p>

<p>"And why are you alarmed on my account? What has occurred that
makes you walk faster, and look so constantly about you?"</p>

<p>"Edith," said the hunter, in a low voice of passionate tenderness,
"you have lived on the frontier long enough to be familiar with
its dangers. When I first saw you, it was in an awful situation
for a gal like yourself, but you bore it like a man. I 'spose,
therefore, that there's no use in keeping any thing back from
you."</p>

<p>"Of course not. What good could that possibly do?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, it's my opinion that <em>some one is following us</em>."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" asked Edith, in genuine alarm; for
there is something startling in the sudden knowledge that a foe
is pursuing us, when there is no shelter at hand which can secure
us against him.</p>

<p>"I can not give you the reason that makes me positive a foe is
behind us; but I am so certain of it, that we must hurry forward
and take measures to hide our trail."</p>

<p>"Why not rejoin our friends?"</p>

<p>"I do not think it can be done, as there are plenty Injin between
us, and we could not avoid them."</p>

<p>"Do what you think best, for surely none can know better than
you."</p>

<p>"Come on, then."</p>

<p>They ascended the creek until the darkening sky, booming thunder,
and constant flashing of lightning warned them that the storm
was at hand. The hunter then stooped, and, lifting his companion
in his arms with the same ease that he would have picked up an
infant, stepped into the stream, and waded nearly across, going
several hundred yards further up before stepping upon the land.
By this time, the swaying of the trees, and the pattering of several
large drops of water, told them that they had but a few minutes
to spare. The hunter was perfectly acquainted with this section,
and made all haste toward a spot which, more than once, had served
him as a shelter in such storms as this. It consisted of a number
of fallen trees, evidently torn up by some tornado, whose branches
were so interlocked and matted that a slight effort of the hand
of man had turned into a comfortable security as one need wish
who was storm-stayed in the forest.</p>

<p>As this was reached, the storm burst upon them in all its grand
fury, but their refuge answered every purpose, and not a thread
of Edith's clothes was wetted. Darkness came on prematurely, and,
as the reader already knows, the storm continued nearly through
the entire night. Fully, and almost morbidly alive to the danger
that ever menaced them, Lewis kept his station at the mouth or
entrance of their shelter until daylight, not willing that for
a moment a free entrance to any foe should be offered.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, it was clear and beautiful, and the two
set out immediately upon their journey. As they had partaken of
no food for a considerable time, the Rifleman was on the alert
to procure some. The forests of Kentucky and Ohio, at that day,
literally swarmed with game, and, in less than a half-hour from
starting, he had brought down a wild turkey, which was dressed
and cooked with admirable skill, and which afforded them a nourishing
and substantial meal.</p>

<p>Lewis was fearful that the late storm would cause such a rise
in the creek that he would be unable to cross if he waited any
longer, and he, therefore, attempted it at once. He found it muddy
and rapidly rising, but he carried Edith over without difficulty,
and then resumed his journey, taking such a direction that he
could only reach the settlement by a wide <em>détour</em> from
directness.</p>

<p>"At any rate," said Dernor, "if any one attempted to follow us
yesterday, he is thrown off the track, and has got to commence
again."</p>

<p>"Should they accidentally come across our trail, it would be
easy enough for them to follow it, would it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, any one could do that, but you see we're so far up the
stream that there is little likelihood of that."</p>

<p>"I <em>do</em> hope the Indians will not trouble us more," said
Edith, in a low, earnest voice.</p>

<p>"And so do I," said the Rifleman, in a lower and more earnest
voice, and venturing at the same time to press the hand that he
held within his own.</p>

<p>There certainly was something in the situation of these two calculated
to inspire mutual trust. Edith felt that, under the merciful Being
who was ever watching her, there was no stronger or more faithful
arm upon which she could rely than the one beside her&mdash;that there
was no heart truer, and no devotion more trustworthy. Under these
circumstances, her words were quite unembarrassed and familiar.</p>

<p>"Suppose we <em>are</em> overtaken?" she asked, looking up in
his face.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> will never be captured while <em>I</em> have strength
to defend you," was the fervent reply.</p>

<p>"You are too kind and noble."</p>

<p>This time Edith impulsively pressed his hand, and, to his dying
day, Lewis Dernor affirmed that this was one of the happiest moments
of his life. Deeply learned as he was in wood-lore, he was a perfect
novice in the subtle mysteries of the tender passion, and the
cause of his ecstasy on this occasion was the sudden certainty
that his love was returned. Had he been less a novice in such
matters, he would have reflected that this slight evidence of
regard most probably was but a mere momentary emotion which any
man in his situation might have inspired. But, "where ignorance
is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise;" and the happy hunter was all
unconscious of this disagreeable possibility.</p>

<p>He felt an unutterable desire to say something&mdash;something grand
and terrible&mdash;which would give Edith a faint idea of the strength
of the passion burning in his breast. Inability to say this something
kept him silent for a long period. Several times, indeed, he was
on the point of speaking, but the words that came to him were
too commonplace and weak to express his tumultuous thoughts. Just
as he was on the point of deciding upon something, it came to
him with startling suddenness that he was too careless with his
charge. For the last hour he had hardly been conscious that he
was traveling in the woods, much less that in these same woods
lurked the deadly Indian, whose thoughts were constantly bent
upon murder and outrage.</p>

<p>"Edith," said he, "I would do any thing if it would only place
us where we could talk without fear of being disturbed. But it
can't be done here. There's Injins in these woods, and I'd never
forgive myself if I should forget it agin, and I've already done
so several times. Just stop a minute."</p>

<p>He took her hand, and the two bent forward in the attitude of
intense listening; and listening thus, they heard faintly in the
distance the report of a rifle. It was several miles away, and
evidently fired by some wandering Indian or hunter. Its only effect
upon our friends was that peculiar one of making them more fully
sensible that there were other beings in the woods besides themselves.</p>

<p>"It means nothing," said Dernor. "Let's go on, but more careful
than before."</p>

<p>"Do you think there is any one following us?" asked Edith, for
this constant renewal of her apprehension made her nervous and
unnaturally suspicious.</p>

<p>"I have no reason to think so, and I haven't any suspicion that
there is. So I guess there's no need of being scared."</p>

<p>"I can not help feeling frightened," said Edith, clinging closer
to him. "I do wish we were at the settlement. How much longer
will it take us to reach it?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow, at the very furthest, I hope we shall be there, and
perhaps to-night, if we keep up a brisk walk."</p>

<p>"I see no reason why we should not hurry."</p>

<p>"Nor I, either," laughed Dernor. "So come on."</p>

<p>He struck up a brisk walk as he spoke, and continued it for some
twenty minutes, when a small creek was reached, the one where
O'Hara and Allmat lost the trail. Before wading it, the Rifleman
paused on its banks as if in deep thought. This was so marked
that Edith questioned him.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking whether it wouldn't be best to put this brook to
the same use that I did last summer. A half-dozen Miamis got rather
closer to me than was pleasant, when I jumped in here and threw
them off the scent."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I will show you."</p>

<p>He picked her up as he spoke, and stepped carefully into the
water. The center of the stream was sufficiently deep to hide
his trail, even had the bottom been less favorable than it was.
But this was hard, gravelly and pebbly, and he walked close to
the edge without fear of betraying himself.</p>

<p>Having gone a considerable distance, he approached the bank,
and made a leap which carried him several feet upon it. He alighted
upon the face of a large, firmly-fixed stone, where, poising himself
for a moment, he sprung to another; and then, making a fourth
leap, came down upon the ground. By this artifice he avoided leaving
any visible trail until so far from the creek that almost any
pursuer would fail to discover it. This explains why his two pursuers
did fail in pursuing him.</p>

<p>"We're safe again for a while," said the Rifleman. "Any one who
comes upon our track must do it between us and the creek."</p>

<p>"I feel greatly relieved," said Edith.</p>

<p>"And much more comfortable, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," she replied, half laughing, as she turned her
gleaming, radiant face up to his.</p>

<p>The Rifleman hardly knew what he did. A mist seemed to come before
his eyes, and he felt as though floating in space, as, acting
under an electrifying impulse, he stooped and kissed the warm
lips of his fair companion. This transport of bliss was changed
to the most utter misery when she answered, with every appearance
of anger:</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself to take advantage of my
helplessness."</p>

<p>"Are you offended?" he asked, his very voice showing his wretchedness
of feeling.</p>

<p>Edith looked up with flashing eyes, crimsoned face, and silent
voice, as if she would annihilate him by her very look. Gradually
a change, like the sunlight breaking through the storm-clouds,
overspread her features. The light of her eyes grew softer, and
the expression of her face more merciful, until, as the hunter
had paused and scarcely breathed for her reply, she said, with
one of her most enchanting smiles:</p>

<p>"I am not offended. You may kiss me again if you wish to do so."</p>

<p>"If I wish to," said the Rifleman, drawing her to him. "If I
wish to&#11834;"</p>

<p>Here his words became unintelligible. He continued kissing her
until she checked him.</p>

<p>"Sh!"</p>

<p>The crackling of some bushes a few yards away showed that they
were no longer alone. The whole aspect of the Rifleman changed.
The lover became the ranger instantly. Cocking his rifle, he placed
himself in front of Edith so as to confront this unexpected danger.</p>
