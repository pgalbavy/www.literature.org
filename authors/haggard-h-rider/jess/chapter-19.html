<p>Once he had turned the corner, John’s recovery was rapid. Naturally of a
vigorous constitution, when the artery had reunited, he soon made up
for the great loss of blood which he had undergone, and in a little more
than a month from the date of his wound physically, was almost as good a
man as ever.
</p><p>One morning--it was the 20th of March--Jess and he were sitting in “The
Palatial” garden. John was lying in a lone cane deck chair that Jess
had borrowed or stolen out of one of the deserted houses, and smoking
a pipe. By his side, in a hole in the flat arm of the chair, fashioned
originally to receive a soda-water tumbler, was a great bunch of purple
grapes which she had gathered for him; and on his knees lay a copy of
that journalistic curiosity, the “News of the Camp,” which was chiefly
remarkable for its utter dearth of news. It was not easy to run a
journal in a beleaguered town.
</p><p>They sat in silence: John puffing away at his pipe, and Jess, her
work--one of his socks--lying idly upon her knees, her hands clasped
over it, and her eyes fixed upon the lights and shadows that played with
broad fingers upon the wooded slopes beyond.
</p><p>So silently did they sit that a great green lizard came and basked
himself in the sun within a yard of them, and a beautiful striped
butterfly perched deliberately upon the purple grapes! It was a
delightful day and a delightful spot. They were too far from the camp to
be disturbed by its rude noise, and the only sounds that reached their
ears were the rippling of running water and the whispers of the wind,
odorous with the breath of mimosa blooms, as it stirred the stiff grey
leaves on the blue gums.
</p><p>They were seated in the shade of the little house that Jess had learned
to love as she had never loved a spot before, but around them lay the
flood of sunshine shimmering like golden water; and beyond the red line
of the fence at the end of the garden, where the rich pomegranate bloom
tried to blush the roses down, the hot air danced merrily above the
rough stone wall like a million microscopic elves at play. Peace!
everywhere was peace! and in it the full heart of Nature beat out in
radiant life. Peace in the voice of the turtle-doves among the willows!
peace in the play of the sunshine and the murmur of the wind! peace
in the growing flowers and hovering butterfly! Jess looked out at the
wealth and glory which were spread before her, and thought that it was
like heaven; then, giving way to the melancholy strain in her nature,
she began to wonder idly how many human beings had sat and thought the
same things, and had been gathered up into the azure of the past and
forgotten; and how many would sit and think there when she in her turn
had been utterly swept away into that gulf whence no echo ever comes!
But what did it matter? The sunshine would still flood the earth with
gold, the water would ripple, and the butterflies hover; and there would
be other women to sit and fold their hands and consider them, thinking
the same identical thoughts, beyond which our human intelligence cannot
travel. And so on for thousands upon thousands of centuries, till at
last the old world reaches its journey’s appointed end, and, passing
from the starry spaces, is swallowed up with those it bore.
</p><p>And she--where would she be? Would she still live on, and love and
suffer elsewhere, or was it all a cruel myth? Was she merely a creature
bred of the teeming earth, or had she an individuality beyond the earth?
What awaited her after sunset?--Sleep. She had often hoped that it was
sleep, and nothing but sleep. But now she did not hope that. Her life
had centred itself around a new interest, and one that she felt could
never die while that life lasted. She hoped for a future now; for if
there was a future for her, there would be one for <u>him</u>, and then her
day would come, and where he was there she would be also. Oh, sweet
mockery, old and unsubstantial thought, bright dream set halowise about
the dull head of life! Who has not dream it, but who can believe in
it? And yet, who shall say that it is not true? Though philosophers and
scientists smile and point in derision to the gross facts and freaks
that mark our passions, is it not possible that there may be a place
where the love shall live when the lust has died; and where Jess will
find that she has not sat in vain in the sunshine, throwing out her pure
heart towards the light of a happiness and a visioned glory whereof, for
some few minutes, the shadow seemed to lie within her?
</p><p>John had finished his pipe, and, although she did not know it, was
watching her face, which, now when she was off her guard, was no longer
impassive, but seemed to mirror the tender and glorious hope that was
floating through her mind. Her lips were slightly parted, and her wide
eyes were full of a soft strange light, while on the whole countenance
was stamped a look of eager thought and spiritualised desire such as he
had known portrayed in ancient masterpieces upon the face of the
Virgin Mother. Except as regards her eyes and hair, Jess was not even a
good-looking person. But, at that moment, John thought that her face was
touched with a diviner beauty than he had yet seen on the face of
woman. It thrilled him and appealed to him, not as Bessie’s beauty had
appealed, but to that other side of his nature, of which Jess alone
could turn the key. It was more like the face of a spirit than that of a
human being, and it almost frightened him to see it.
</p><p>“Jess,” he said at last, “what are you thinking of?”
</p><p>She started, and her face resumed its normal expression. It was as
though a mask had been suddenly set upon it.
</p><p>“Why do you ask?” she said.
</p><p>“Because I want to know. I never saw you look like that before.”
</p><p>She laughed a little.
</p><p>“You would call me foolish if I told you what I was thinking about.
Never mind, it has gone wherever thoughts go. I will tell you what I am
thinking about now, which is--that it is about time we got out of this
place. My uncle and Bessie must be half distracted.”
</p><p>“We’ve had more than two months of it now. The relieving column can’t be
far off,” suggested John; for these foolish people in Pretoria laboured
under a firm belief that one fine morning they would be gratified with a
vision of the light dancing down a long line of British bayonets, and of
Boers evaporating in every direction like storm clouds before the sun.
</p><p>Jess shook her head. She was beginning to lose faith in relieving
columns that never came.
</p><p>“If we don’t help ourselves, my opinion is that we may stop here till
we are starved out, which in fact we are. However, it’s no use
talking about it, so I’m off to fetch our rations. Let’s see, have you
everything you want?”
</p><p>“Everything, thanks.”
</p><p>“Well, then, mind you stop quiet till I come back.”
</p><p>“Why,” laughed John, “I am as strong as a horse.”
</p><p>“Possibly; but that is what the doctor said, you know. Good-bye!” and
Jess took her big basket and started on what John used feebly to call
her “rational undertaking.”
</p><p>She had not gone fifty paces from the door before she suddenly caught
sight of a familiar form seated on a familiar pony. The form was fat
and jovial-looking, and the pony was small but also fat. It was Hans
Coetzee--none other!
</p><p>Jess could hardly believe her eyes. Old Hans in Pretoria! What could it
mean?
</p><p>“<u>Oom</u> Coetzee! <u>Oom</u> Coetzee!” she called, as he came ambling past her,
evidently heading for the Heidelberg road.
</p><p>The old Boer pulled up his pony, and gazed around him in a mystified
fashion.
</p><p>“Here, <u>Oom</u> Coetzee! Here!”
</p><p>“_Allemachter!_” he said, jerking his pony round. “It’s you, Missie
Jess, is it? Now who would have thought of seeing you here?”
</p><p>“Who would have thought of seeing <u>you</u> here?” she answered.
</p><p>“Yes, yes; it seems strange; I dare say that it seems strange. But I am
a messenger of peace, like Uncle Noah’s dove in the ark, you know. The
fact is,” and he glanced round to see if anybody was listening, “I have
been sent by the Government to arrange about an exchange of prisoners.”
</p><p>“The Government! What Government?”
</p><p>“What Government? Why, the Triumvirate, of course--whom may the Lord
bless and prosper, as He did Jonah when he walked on the wall of the
city.”
</p><p>“Joshua, when he walked round the wall of the city,” suggested Jess.
“Jonah walked down the whale’s throat.”
</p><p>“Ah! to be sure, so he did, and blew a trumpet inside. I remember
now; though I am sure I don’t know how he did it. The fact is that our
glorious victories have quite confused me. Ah! what a thing it is to be
a patriot! The dear Lord makes strong the arm of the patriot, and takes
care that he hits his man well in the middle.”
</p><p>“You have turned wonderfully patriotic all of a sudden, <u>Oom</u> Coetzee,”
 said Jess tartly.
</p><p>“Yes, missie, yes; I am a patriot to the bone of my back! I hate the
English Government; damn the English Government! Let us have our land
back and our <u>Volksraad</u>. Almighty! I saw who was in the right at
Laing’s Nek there. Ah, those poor _rooibaatjes!_ I killed four of them
myself; two as they came up, and two as they ran away, and the last one
went head-over-heels like a buck. Poor man! I cried for him afterwards.
I did not like going to fight at all, but Frank Muller sent to me and
said that if I did not go he would have me shot. Ah, he is a devil of a
man, that Frank Muller! So I went, and when I saw how the dear Lord had
put it into the heart of the English general to be a bigger fool even
that day than he is every day, and to try and drive us out of Laing’s
Nek with a thousand of his poor <u>rooibaatjes</u>, then, I tell you, I saw
where the right lay, and I said, ‘Damn the English Government! What is
the English Government doing here?’ and after Ingogo I said it again.”
</p><p>“Never mind all that, <u>Oom</u> Coetzee,” broke in Jess. “I have heard you
tell a different tale before, and perhaps you will again. How are my
uncle and my sister? Are they at the farm?”
</p><p>“Almighty! you don’t suppose that I have been there to see, do you? But,
yes, I have heard they are there. It is a nice place, that Mooifontein,
and I think that I shall buy it when we have turned all you English
people out of the land. Frank Muller told me that they were there. And
now I must be getting on, or that devil of a man, Frank Muller, will
want to know what I have been about.”
</p><p>“<u>Oom</u> Coetzee,” said Jess, “will you do something for me? We are
old friends, you know, and once I persuaded my uncle to lend you five
hundred pounds when all your oxen died of the lungsick.”
</p><p>“Yes, yes, it shall be paid back one day--when we have hunted the damned
Englishmen out of the country.” And he began to gather up his reins
preparatory to riding off.
</p><p>“Will you do me a favour?” said Jess, catching the pony by the bridle.
</p><p>“What is it? What is it, missie? I must be getting on. That devil of a
man, Frank Muller, is waiting for me with the prisoners at the Rooihuis
Kraal.”
</p><p>“I want a pass for myself and Captain Niel, and an escort. We wish to go
home.”
</p><p>The old Boer held up his fat hands in amazement.
</p><p>“Almighty!” he said, “it is impossible. A pass!--who ever heard of such
a thing? Come, I must be going.”
</p><p>“It is not impossible, Uncle Coetzee, as you know,” said Jess. “Listen!
If I get that pass I will speak to my uncle about the five hundred
pounds. Perhaps he would not want it all back again.”
</p><p>“Ah!” said the Boer. “Well, we are old friends, missie, and ‘never
desert a friend,’ that is my saying. Almighty! I must ride a hundred
miles--I will swim through blood for a friend. Well, well, I must see.
It depends upon that devil of a man, Frank Muller. Where are you to be
found--in the white house yonder? Good. To-morrow the escort will come
in with the prisoners, and if I can get it they will bring the pass.
But, missie, remember the five hundred pounds. If you do not speak to
your uncle about that I shall be even with him. Almighty! what a thing
it is to have a good heart, and to love to help your friends! Well,
good-day, good-day,” and off he cantered on his fat pony, his broad face
shining with a look of unutterable benevolence.
</p><p>Jess cast a look of contempt after him, and then went on towards the
camp to fetch the rations.
</p><p>When she returned to “The Palatial,” she told John what had taken
place, and suggested that it would be as well, in case there should be
a favourable reply to her request, to have everything prepared for a
start. Accordingly, the cart was brought down and stood outside “The
Palatial,” where John unscrewed the patent caps and filled them with
castor-oil, and ordered Mouti to keep the horses, which were all in
health, though “poor” from want of proper food, well within hail.
</p><p>Meanwhile, old Hans pursued the jerky tenour of his way for an hour or
so, till he came in sight of a small red house.
</p><p>Presently, from the shadow in front of the red house emerged a rider,
mounted on a powerful black horse. The horseman--a stern, handsome,
bearded man--put his hand above his eyes to shade them from the sun, and
gazed up the road. Then he seemed suddenly to strike his spurs into the
horse, for the animal bounded forward swiftly, and came sweeping towards
Hans at a hand gallop.
</p><p>“Ah! it is that devil of a man, Frank Muller!” ejaculated Coetzee. “Now
I wonder what he wants? I always feel cold down the back when he comes
near me.”
</p><p>By this time the plunging black horse was being reined up alongside of
his pony so sharply that it reared till its great hoofs were pawing the
air within a few inches of Hans’ head.
</p><p>“Almighty!” said the old man, tugging his pony round. “Be careful,
nephew, be careful; I do not wish to be crushed like a beetle.”
</p><p>Frank Muller--for it was he--smiled. He had made his horse rear
purposely, in order to frighten the old man, whom he knew to be an
arrant coward.
</p><p>“Why have you been so long? and what have you done with the Englishmen?
You should have been back half an hour ago.”
</p><p>“And so I should, nephew, and so I should, if I had not been detained.
Surely you do not suppose that I would linger in the accursed place?
Bah,” and he spat upon the ground, “it stinks of Englishmen. I cannot
get the taste of them out of my mouth.”
</p><p>“You are a liar, Uncle Coetzee,” was the cool answer. “English with the
English, Boer with the Boer. You blow neither hot nor cold. Be careful
lest I show you up. I know you and your talk. Do you remember what you
were saying to the Englishman Niel in the inn-yard at Wakkerstroom
when you turned and saw me? I heard, and I do not forget. You know what
happens to a ‘land betrayer’?”
</p><p>Hans’ teeth positively chattered, and his florid face blanched with
fear.
</p><p>“What do you mean, nephew?” he asked.
</p><p>“I--ah!--I mean nothing. I was only speaking a word of warning to you as
a friend. I have heard things said about you by----” and he dropped
his voice and whispered a name, at the sound of which poor Hans turned
whiter than ever.
</p><p>“Well,” went on his tormentor, when he had sufficiently enjoyed his
terror, “what sort of terms did you make in Pretoria?”
</p><p>“Oh, good, nephew, good,” he gabbled, delighted to find a fresh subject.
“I found the Englishmen supple as a tanned skin. They will give up their
twelve prisoners for our four. The men are to be in by ten to-morrow.
I told their commandant about Laing’s Nek and Ingogo, and he would not
believe me. He thought I lied like himself. They are getting hungry
there now. I saw a Hottentot I knew, and he told me that their bones
were beginning to show.”
</p><p>“They will be through the skin before long,” muttered Frank. “Well,
here we are at the house. The General is there. He has just come up from
Heidelberg, and you can make your report to him. Did you find out about
the Englishman--Captain Niel? Is it true that he is dead?”
</p><p>“No, he is not dead. By the way, I met <u>Oom</u> Croft’s niece--the dark
one. She is shut up there with the Captain, and she begged me to try and
get them a pass to go home. Of course I told her that it was nonsense,
and that they must stop and starve with the others.”
</p><p>Muller, who had been listening to this last piece of information with
intense interest, suddenly checked his horse and answered:
</p><p>“Did you? Then you are a bigger fool than I thought you. Who gave you
authority to decide whether they should have a pass or not?”
