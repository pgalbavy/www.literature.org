<p>Mr. Sharp-horn, the man-goat, was so surprised at what Lightfoot had
done in leaping over the edge of the cliff that, for a second, he did
not know what to do. Indeed Sharp-horn, who was running very fast,
could hardly stop in time to save himself from sliding over.
</p><p>“Look out there, Lightfoot!” he called. “I didn’t mean to make you do
that. I wouldn’t have hurt you very much. Why did you jump?”
</p><p>But Lightfoot could not answer now. He was falling down through the
air. Indeed he, himself, hardly knew why he had jumped. He almost
wished he had not.
</p><p>Far down below he saw the shanty of the Widow Malony, and he saw the
hard rocks and ground all around it. Somewhere down there Lightfoot
would land, and he might be badly hurt. For he was not one of the kind
of goats that are said to turn somersaults in the air, when they leap,
and land on their big, curved horns.
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” called Grandpa Bumper, as he heard Mr. Sharp-horn
shouting in his bleating voice.
</p><p>“Lightfoot has jumped over the edge!” called the other goat.
</p><p>“Oh, my! He’ll be killed!” cried Mrs. Sharp-horn. “You shouldn’t have
chased him, Sharpy,” for sometimes she called her goat-husband that.
</p><p>“I――I didn’t mean to make him jump,” went on Mr. Sharp-horn. “I was
only trying to scare him away from our feeding place. He is too young
to come up here. I’m sorry.”
</p><p>“Oh, what a big jump he made!” cried Grandpa Bumper, for he knew it was
about twenty-five feet from the rocky edge down to the ground below.
“If he isn’t killed or hurt it will be a wonder.”
</p><p>Of course all this took place much more quickly than I can tell it.
It was only a few seconds. Lightfoot was falling down and down, or,
rather, he had jumped down.
</p><p>And as he left the edge of the rocks, and looked below, he wished he
had taken the butting from Mr. Sharp-horn. But it was too late now. And
then, all of a sudden, Lightfoot did that which gained him the name of
being a very wise young goat.
</p><p>[Illustration: Lightfoot was falling down and down.]
</p><p>Below he saw the tin and board roof of the Malony shanty. It stood
about fifteen feet high, and Lightfoot thought if he could land on that
it would shorten his big jump. He would not have to go so far, and then
he could leap down that much more easily.
</p><p>So he gave himself a shake and a twist in the air, as some acrobats do
in the circus, and as cats and goats do when they jump, and, instead of
heading straight for the hard ground, Lightfoot aimed his four feet at
the roof of the shanty.
</p><p>Just then Mrs. Malony came to the door to watch her son going down the
street with the basket of clothes on his wagon.
</p><p>“Look! Look, Mike!” called the widow. “Sure it’s a flyin’ goat
Lightfoot is now. He’s fallin’ down out of the sky!”
</p><p>And indeed it did look so. But before Mike could answer, Lightfoot had
landed on the roof of the shanty amid a great clattering of the boards
and tin that kept out the rain. The roof was flat, and the boards were
springy, so the goat sort of bounced up and down, like the man when he
falls into the circus net, though, of course, to a less degree.
</p><p>And it was this that saved the goat from being hurt. He was shaken up
a bit and jarred, but he had safely jumped from the top of the rocks
to the roof of the shanty. From there it was easy to get down, for
at one side was a shed, with a little lower roof, and when Lightfoot
had leaped to this he had no trouble in jumping to a soft place on the
ground just outside the kitchen door.
</p><p>“Well, of all things!” exclaimed the Widow Malony. “You’re th’
jumpinest goat I ever had! You’re that light on your feet a clog-dancer
would admire you. Sure it’s a fine goat you are!”
</p><p>“We never had any goat to jump the likes of Lightfoot!” cried Mike,
running back to see if his pet were hurt, for he loved Lightfoot better
than any of the others. He patted the shaggy coat of the animal, and,
looking at him, saw that he was not in the least harmed. Lightfoot felt
a little pain, but he could not tell Mike about it.
</p><p>“Oh, how did you ever dare do it?” asked Blackie, running up to
Lightfoot with a piece of paste-paper in her mouth. “Weren’t you
afraid?”
</p><p>“I――I guess I didn’t have time to be,” answered Lightfoot. “I didn’t
think they’d drive me away from up there.”
</p><p>Mike went on with the washing when he found Lightfoot was not hurt, and
Mrs. Malony went back in the shanty. From the edge of the rocks above
the other goats looked down.
</p><p>“Say, youngster,” called Mr. Sharp-horn to Lightfoot, “I didn’t mean to
make you do that. Are you hurt?”
</p><p>“Not a bit,” answered Lightfoot, who was beginning to feel a bit proud
of himself now.
</p><p>“That was a wonderful leap,” said Mrs. Sharp-horn.
</p><p>“Indeed it was!” added Grandpa Bumper. “Of course I have made such
leaps as that when I was younger, but I can’t any more. For a kid that
was very good, Lightfoot.”
</p><p>“He won’t be a kid much longer,” said Mrs. Sharp-horn. Then she said
something in a low baa-a to her goat-husband.
</p><p>“Why, yes,” answered Mr. Sharp-horn, “I guess, after this big leap
he did to-day, Lightfoot can come up among us other goats now. You
may come up to the top of the rocks whenever you like,” he went on to
Lightfoot. “We won’t chase you away any more.”
</p><p>“And may Blackie come up with me and eat the sweet grass?” asked
Lightfoot, having a kind thought for his little friend.
</p><p>“Can she climb that far?” asked Grandpa Bumper.
</p><p>“I’ll help her,” offered Lightfoot.
</p><p>“Then you may both come,” went on the old grandfather goat who ruled
over the rest. “Your grass down there is getting pretty dry,” he went
on. “Come up whenever you want to. And, Lightfoot, don’t try any more
such risky jumps as that. You might break a leg.”
</p><p>So, after all, you see, Lightfoot’s big jump turned out to be a
good thing for him and Blackie. After Lightfoot had rested a bit he
and Blackie went up to the top of the rocks, Lightfoot helping the
girl-goat over the rough places, and soon all the Widow Malony’s
animals were cropping the sweet grass on top of the high rocks.
</p><p>Lightfoot’s leap was talked about among the goats for many a day after
that. The goat grew bigger and stronger, and every chance he found he
practiced jumping until he could do almost as well as Mr. Sharp-horn,
who was the best leaper of all the goats in Shanty-town, as the place
of the squatters was called.
</p><p>Day after day Lightfoot would practice jumping and climbing among
the rocks, sometimes alone and sometimes with Blackie. One day, when
he had made a very hard jump from one rock to another, he heard some
boy-and-girl-talk in the road in front of the widow’s shanty. Looking
down, Lightfoot saw a small cart drawn by a pony, and seated in the
cart was a man, and with him were his two children.
</p><p>“Oh, look, George!” called the little girl, “there’s that nice goat we
saw when we were going to the circus, the day we got back Tinkle, our
pony.”
</p><p>“So it is, Mabel,” answered the boy. “Could we ever have a goat,
Daddy?” he asked his father as the pony cart stopped.
</p><p>“Oh, I guess not,” said the man. “Tinkle is enough for you.” Then to
Mrs. Malony, who came to the front gate, he said: “That’s a fine goat
you have.”
</p><p>“Sure an’ you may well say that. You’re the gintleman who went past
here a few days ago, aren’t you?”
</p><p>“Yes. I was on my way to the circus, and it was there we got back my
children’s pony which had been stolen.”
</p><p>“Well, I’m glad you have him back,” said the Widow Malony, with a
twinkle in her kind, Irish-blue eyes. “You should have seen Lightfoot
leap from the top of the rocks to the roof of me shanty one day.”
</p><p>“Did he really do that?” asked George.
</p><p>“He did,” and Mrs. Malony told about it.
</p><p>Meanwhile Tinkle, the trick pony, of whom I have told you in the book
of that name, was having a little talk with Lightfoot.
</p><p>“Were you really stolen?” asked Lightfoot, when Tinkle told some of his
adventures.
</p><p>“Indeed I was. And did you really jump from the top of those rocks?”
</p><p>“I did,” answered the leaping goat, holding his head high and feeling
very proud.
</p><p>“That’s more than I could do, though I can do circus tricks,” said
Tinkle. “There’s been a book written about me and my tricks and
adventures.”
</p><p>“You don’t tell me!” cried Lightfoot. “But what’s a book?”
</p><p>Before Tinkle could answer Mr. Farley, the father of George and Mabel,
called good-by to the Widow Malony and drove on with the children in
the pony cart.
</p><p>“Good-by!” called Tinkle to Lightfoot. “If ever you get to the circus
ask Tum Tum, the jolly elephant, or Mappo, the merry monkey, about me.”
</p><p>“I will,” promised Lightfoot, “though I never expect to go to a circus.”
</p><p>“Sure they were nice little children,” said Mrs. Malony, “and it was a
fine pony cart they had. How would you like to pull a stylish cart like
that, Lightfoot?” she asked as she went back in the shanty to finish
her washing.
</p><p>For many days after this Lightfoot lived around the squatter’s shanty
learning to leap and do other things that goats have to do in this
world. And one day he had an adventure that was not exactly pleasant.
</p><p>Lightfoot was getting to be quite a big goat now, and sometimes he
wandered away farther than he had ever gone before. Two or three
streets from where the Malony shanty was built ran an electric car
line. At first Lightfoot did not know what it was, but the other goats
told him that people rode in the queer, yellow cars which went rolling
along in such a queer way on the shiny rails, a bell clanging in front.
</p><p>One afternoon Lightfoot wandered down to the trolley tracks. An ash
wagon had passed a little while before, and the goat had seen fall from
it a tin can with a big, red, tomato-paper pasted on it.
</p><p>“I’ll get that paper and eat off the paste,” thought Lightfoot.
</p><p>The can was in the middle of the tracks. Lightfoot began nosing it,
tearing off the paper and eating small pieces. It tasted very good to
him.
</p><p>Suddenly there was the clanging of a bell, and along came a car, headed
straight for Lightfoot. The goat looked up.
</p><p>“Bother!” he exclaimed to himself. “You’ll have to wait until I finish
my lunch,” he went on. “I’m not going to hurry out of the way for you.
I’m as good as you!” Lightfoot wanted his own way, you see.
</p><p>But goats have no rights on a trolley track, though Lightfoot did not
know this. The motorman clanged his bell, and cried:
</p><p>“Get off the tracks, you goat, or I’ll bump into you!”
</p><p>Now Lightfoot knew very little indeed about trolley cars. He did not
know how strong they were. And so, as he stood between the rails,
chewing the paper from the can, and saw the big yellow car clanging its
way toward him, Lightfoot stamped his hoofs, shook his horns and said
to himself:
</p><p>“Well, do as you please, but I’m not going to move until I finish
eating. I guess I can butt as hard as you!”
</p><p>“Get out of there!” called the motorman again. But Lightfoot did not
understand. The car slowed up a little, but still came on.
</p><p>“Bump into him, Bill!” called the conductor to the motorman, and the
next instant the fender of the street car struck Lightfoot’s lowered
horns, and tossed him to one side over into a ditch full of weeds.
</p><p>“Oh, dear! I’m hurt this time, sure!” thought poor Lightfoot. “I
thought I could knock that car off the track, but, instead, it knocked
me off! Oh, dear!”
