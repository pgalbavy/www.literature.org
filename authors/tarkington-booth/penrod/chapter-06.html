<p>The sun was setting behind the back fence (though at a considerable
distance) as Penrod Schofield approached that fence and looked
thoughtfully up at the top of it, apparently having in mind some
purpose to climb up and sit there. Debating this, he passed his
fingers gently up and down the backs of his legs; and then something
seemed to decide him not to sit anywhere. He leaned against the
fence, sighed profoundly, and gazed at Duke, his wistful dog.</p>

<p>The sigh was reminiscent: episodes of simple pathos were passing
before his inward eye. About the most painful was the vision of
lovely Marjorie Jones, weeping with rage as the Child Sir Lancelot
was dragged, insatiate, from the prostrate and howling Child Sir
Galahad, after an onslaught delivered the precise instant the
curtain began to fall upon the demoralized "pageant." And then&mdash;oh,
pangs! oh, woman!&mdash;she slapped at the ruffian's cheek, as he was
led past her by a resentful janitor; and turning, flung her arms
round the Child Sir Galahad's neck.</p>

<p>"<em>PENROD SCHOFIELD, DON'T YOU DARE EVER SPEAK TO ME AGAIN
AS LONG AS YOU LIVE!" </em>Maurice's little white boots and gold
tassels had done their work.</p>

<p>At home the late Child Sir Lancelot was consigned to a locked
clothes-closet pending the arrival of his father. Mr. Schofield
came and, shortly after, there was put into practice an old patriarchal
custom. It is a custom of inconceivable antiquity: probably primordial,
certainly prehistoric, but still in vogue in some remaining citadels
of the ancient simplicities of the Republic.</p>

<p>And now, therefore, in the dusk, Penrod leaned against the fence
and sighed.</p>

<p>His case is comparable to that of an adult who could have survived
a similar experience. Looking back to the sawdust-box, fancy pictures
this comparable adult a serious and inventive writer engaged in
congenial literary activities in a private retreat. We see this
period marked by the creation of some of the most virile passages
of a Work dealing exclusively in red corpuscles and huge primal
impulses. We see this thoughtful man dragged from his calm seclusion
to a horrifying publicity; forced to adopt the stage and, himself
a writer, compelled to exploit the repulsive sentiments of an
author not only personally distasteful to him but whose whole
method and school in belles lettres he despises.</p>

<p>We see him reduced by desperation and modesty to stealing a pair
of overalls. We conceive him to have ruined, then, his own reputation,
and to have utterly disgraced his family; next, to have engaged
in the duello and to have been spurned by his lady-love, thus
lost to him (according to her own declaration) forever. Finally,
we must behold: imprisonment by the authorities; the third degree
and flagellation.</p>

<p>We conceive our man decided that his career had been perhaps
too eventful. Yet Penrod had condensed all of it into eight hours.</p>

<p>It appears that he had at least some shadowy perception of a
recent fulness of life, for, as he leaned against the fence, gazing
upon his wistful Duke, he sighed again and murmured aloud:</p>

<p>"<em>WELL, HASN'T THIS BEEN A DAY</em>!"</p>

<p>But in a little while a star came out, freshly lighted, from
the highest part of the sky, and Penrod, looking up, noticed it
casually and a little drowsily. He yawned. Then he sighed once
more, but not reminiscently: evening had come; the day was over.
It was a sigh of pure ennui.</p>
