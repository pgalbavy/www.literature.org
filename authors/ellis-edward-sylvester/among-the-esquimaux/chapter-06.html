<p>It is at such times that a person realizes his helplessness and
utter dependence on the great Father of all. Too much are we prone
to forget such dependence, when all goes well, and too often the
prayer for help and guidance is put off until too late.</p>

<p>It was a commendable trait in all three of the parties whose
experience I have set out to tell that they never forgot their
duty in this all-important matter. Rob and Fred were full of animal
life and spirits, and the elder especially was inclined, from
this very excess of health and strength, to overstep at times
the bounds of propriety, but both remembered the lessons learned
in infancy at the mother's knee, and never failed to commend themselves
to their heavenly parent, not only on waking in the glad morning,
but on closing their eyes at night.</p>

<p>Jack Cosgrove had one of those impressionable natures, tinged
with innocent superstition, which is often seen in those of his
calling. His faith possessed the simplicity of a child, and, though
many of his doings might not square with those of a Christian,
yet at heart he devoutly believed in the all-protecting care of
his Maker, and was never ashamed, no matter what his surroundings,
to call upon Him for help and guidance.</p>

<p>And so, as the three pressed closer together, adjusting themselves
as best they could to pass the long, dismal hours ere the sun
would shine upon them again, they were silent, and all, at the
same time, communed with God, as fervently and trustfully as ever
a dying Christian did when stretched upon his bed of mortal illness.</p>

<p>Had they possessed a blanket among them they could have spread
it upon the ice, lain down upon it, and, wrapping it as best they
could, passed the night with a fair degree of comfort. That, however,
was out of the question. They, therefore, seated themselves under
the lee, as may be said of the mass of ice, which protected them
against the gale, their bodies pressed as closely together as
well could be, and in this sitting posture prepared to go to sleep,
if it should so prove that the blessing could be won.</p>

<p>One can become accustomed to almost anything. An abrupt change
from the comfortable cabin of the "Nautilus" to the bleak situation
on the iceberg would have filled them with a dread hardly less
trying than death itself; but they had already been in the situation
long enough to grow used to it. The ponderous swaying of the frozen
structure, the thunderous dash and roar of the waves against its
base, the screaming of the gale and the darkness of the arctic
night; all these were sounds and sensations which in a certain
sense grew familiar to them and did not disturb them as the hours
passed.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that an icy seat or rest forms the most comfortable
support for the body, whose warmth is likely to melt the frozen
surface, but the thick clothing of the party did much to avert
unpleasant consequences. Had Jack or Rob or Fred been alone, the
penetrating cold most likely would have overcome him, but as has
been shown, the mutual warmth rendered their situation less trying
than would be supposed.</p>

<p>When an hour had passed, with only an occasional word spoken,
Jack addressed each of the boys in turn by name. There was no
response, and he spoke in a louder tone with the same result.</p>

<p>"They're asleep," he said to himself, "and I'm glad of it, though
the sleep that sometimes comes to a chap in these parts at such
times is the kind that doesn't know any waking in this world.
I've no doubt, howsumever, that they're all right."</p>

<p>With a vague uneasiness, natural under the circumstances, he
passed his hands over their faces and pinched their arms, as if
to assure himself there was no mistake.</p>

<p>The boys were so muffled up in their thick coats and sealskin
caps that were drawn about their ears, behind which the collars
of their coats were raised, that only the ends of their noses
and a slight portion of their cheeks could be felt. He removed
his heavy mitten from one hand, and, reaching under the protecting
covering about the cheeks and neck, found a healthy glow which
told him all was well, and, for the time at least, he need feel
no further anxiety, so far as they were concerned.</p>

<p>"Which being the case," he added, drawing on his mitten again,
and making sure their coverings were adjusted, "I'll take a little
trip myself into the land of nod."</p>

<p>But this trip was easier thought of than made. His rugged body,
with its powerful vitality, would have soon succumbed to drowsiness,
could his mind have been free of its distressing fear for the
two young friends under his charge. But, though he had said little,
he knew far more than he dare tell them. He had shown his alarm
on discovering the loss of the boat, but though some impatient
expressions escaped him, he did not explain what was in his mind.</p>

<p>His belief was that before morning should come the "Nautilus"
would be driven so far from her course that she would be nowhere
in sight, and, towering as was the iceberg in its height and proportions,
it would be invisible from the deck of the ship, or, if visible,
could not be identified among the others drifting through the
icy ocean. Well aware, too, he was of the terrific strength of
the gale sweeping across the deep, he trembled for the safety
of the "Nautilus" and those on board, hardly less than he did
for himself and friends. The hurricane was resistless in its power,
and would drive the ship whither it chose like a cockle-shell.
Icebergs were moving hither and thither through the darkness,
less affected by the wind and waves than the vessel, and a collision
was among the possibilities, if not the probabilities.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the "Nautilus" was likely to go down under the fury
of the elements, or, if she rode through it, was certain to be
too far removed to be of help to the three, the question to consider
was what hope of escape remained to the latter.</p>

<p>Although vessels penetrate Baffin Bay and far into the Arctic
Ocean, they are so few in number that days and weeks may pass
without any two of them gaining sight of each other. A shipwrecked
sailor afloat in the South Sea, on a spar, was as likely to be
picked up by some trading ship as were Jack and his companions,
by any of the whalers or ships in that high latitude.</p>

<p>And then, supposing they did catch sight of some stray vessel,
who of the captain and crew would be looking for living persons
on board an iceberg? Why would they give the latter any more attention
than the scores of the mountainous masses afloat in their path
and which it was their first care to avoid?</p>

<p>If a ship should pass so near to them that they could make their
signals seen there would be hope; but the chances of anything
of that kind were too remote to be regarded.</p>

<p>Such being the outlook, where was there ground for hope? They
were beyond sight of the Greenland coast, and were doubtless drifting
farther away every hour. Nothing in the nature of succor was to
be hoped for from land, and the brave-hearted Jack was obliged
to say to himself that, so far as human eye could see, there was
none from any source. Cold, starvation, and death seemed among
the certainties near at hand.</p>

<p>And having reached this disheartening belief, he closed his eyes
and joined his young friends in the land of dreams.</p>

<p>Having sunk into slumber, the sailor was likely to remain so
until morning, unless some unexpected circumstance should break
in upon his rest, and it did.</p>

<p>It was Rob Carrol, who, probably because of his cramped position,
first regained consciousness. As his senses gradually came back
to him, and the thunder of the surges and the shrieking of the
gale broke in upon his brain, he stretched his benumbed limbs
and yawned in an effort to make his situation more comfortable.</p>

<p>It struck him that there had been a change in their relative
positions while asleep. Not wishing to awake his companions, he
carefully shifted his limbs and body, so as not to disturb them.
While doing so, he extended his hand to touch them.</p>

<p>He groped along one figure, which he knew at once was Jack, but
he felt no other. With a vague fear he straightened up, leaned
over, and hastily extended his arms about him, as far as he could
reach. The next moment he roughly shook the shoulder of the sailor,
and called out in a husky voice:</p>

<p>"Jack! Jack! wake up! Fred is gone!"</p>
