<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Weber was right in his declaration that the parties who were
stampeding a part of the herd were Indians. They were two in number,
both superbly mounted, and dashing back and forth with great swiftness,
as they urged the animals to a frantic flight. They knew the danger
of pursuit and the value of time.</p>

<p>The rancher, who shouted to his companion, was a few paces in
advance at the exciting moment he made the discovery. The sight
so angered him that he stopped abruptly and brought his rifle
to his shoulder, with the intention of shooting the marauder from
his horse.</p>

<p>This would have been done the next instant but for the exclamation
of Grizzly Weber. Despite the noise and confusion, the Indian
heard him and saw his danger. Before the rancher could sight his
weapon the thief seemed to plunge headlong over the further side
of his steed; but instead of doing so he resorted to the common
trick of his people, all of whom are unsurpassable horsemen. He
flung himself so far over that nothing of his body remained visible.
The horse himself became the shield between him and the white
man. The redskin was in the saddle, but he would have been just
as expert had he been riding bareback.</p>

<p>Weber muttered his disappointment, but held his rifle ready to
fire the instant he caught sight of any part of the fellow's person.
At any rate, a recourse was open to him; he could shoot the horse,
and thus place his enemy on the same footing with himself. He
decided to do so.</p>

<p>The hurly-burly was bewildering. The cattle were bellowing in
affright, galloping frenziedly before the two horsemen, dashing
back and forth among them at the rear like two lunatics, and goading
them to desperate haste.</p>

<p>At the instant the Indian whom Grizzly Weber selected as his
man eluded his fatal aim, his horse was running diagonally. This
could not be continued without the abandonment of the herd. He
must wheel, to come back behind the fleeing cattle. The rancher
waited for that moment, prepared to fire the instant any tangible
part of the body of the rogue was revealed by the moonlight.</p>

<p>But an astonishing exploit prevented the shot. The savage wheeled,
just as was anticipated, but, in the act of doing so, threw himself
for a second time over the side of his horse, so as to interpose
his body. He did it with such inimitable dexterity that the rancher
was baffled.</p>

<p>All this took place in a twinkling, as may be said; but, brief
as was the time, it caused Weber to lose valuable ground. The
horse was growing dimmer in the gloom, and, unless checked, would
quickly be beyond reach of the Winchester still levelled at him.
Nothing was easier than to drive a bullet through his brain and
then have it out with the Indian. Possibly the single bullet would
end the career of both.</p>

<p>Budd Hankinson called out something, but Grizzly Weber did not
catch it. With grim resolution he sighted as best he could in
the moonlight at the galloping steed, and then with a shiver lowered
his weapon undischarged, awed by the sudden discovery of the deed
he had come within a hair of committing.</p>

<p>The erratic motions of the Indian and his horse entangled both
with the flying cattle. All at once the nimble steed became so
crowded on every side that his only escape from being gored to
death was by a tremendous bound which he made over the back of
a terrified steer who lowered his head for the purpose of driving
his horns into his body. He made the leap with amazing skill and
grace.</p>

<p>As he went up in the air, with the Indian clinging to his side,
the astonishing leap was executed with perfect ease, precision
and perfectness, his figure rising above the mass of struggling
animals and standing out for a moment in clear relief.</p>

<p>That one glimpse of the outlines of the splendid horse, together
with the brilliancy of the performance itself, told Grizzly Weber
that the steed was his own Cap. The owner had by a hair escaped
sending a bullet through the brain of the animal whom he loved
as his own brother.</p>

<p>Grizzly was stupefied for an instant. Then, knowing that Cap
had been duped by some conjuration, he sent out the familiar signal
with a sharp distinctness that rose above the din and racket,
which, to ordinary ears, would have been overwhelming.</p>

<p>The result was remarkable, and approached the ridiculous. Cap
heard the call, and instantly turned to obey it. The Indian on
his back strove furiously to prevent and to keep him at his work.
Cap fought savagely, flinging his head aloft, rearing, plunging,
and refusing to follow the direction toward which the redskin
twisted his head by sheer strength. It was a strife between rider
and steed, and the latter made no progress in either direction
while keeping up the fight, which was as fierce as it was brief.</p>

<p>The Indian could not force the horse to obey him, and the efforts
of Cap to reach his master were defeated by the wrenching at the
bit. It looked as if the horse had been seized with the frenzy
that possessed every one, and was fighting and struggling aimlessly
and accomplishing nothing.</p>

<p>But Grizzly Weber was not the one to stand idly by and allow
this extraordinary contest to go on. Nothing intervened between
him and the daring marauder, and he dashed toward him.</p>

<p>The redskin's audacity, nimbleness and self-possession excited
the admiration of Grizzly Weber, angered though he was at the
trick played on him. The rider knew the risk of keeping up the
fight with the obdurate beast, for the master was sure to arrive
on the spot within a few seconds. Before the rancher could reach
him he went from the saddle as if shot out of a gun.</p>

<p>Freed from his incubus, Cap emitted a joyful whinny and trotted
toward his master.</p>

<p>"You rascal!" exclaimed the delighted rancher, vaulting upon
his back in a twinkling. "Now we'll settle with the chap that
tried to part you and me."</p>

<p>All this consumed but a few moments. The Indian could not have
gone far. He would not dash among the cattle, who, now that they
were stampeded, were as dangerous as so many wild beasts. He had
hardly time to conceal himself, and Grizzly was certain that he
had him.</p>

<p>All the same, however, the cowman made a miscalculation. When
he wheeled Cap about to run down the daring redskin he was nowhere
to be seen. There were no trees near, but there were boulders,
rocks and depressions, with the rich grass everywhere, and the
dusky thief was as safe as if beyond the Assinaboine, in British
territory.</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it," thought Weber, a moment later; "a redskin that
can show such a performance as that desarves to save his scalp."</p>

<p>In the dizzying flurry Grizzly had no time to think of his companion,
who had enough to attend to his own matters. He now looked around
for him, but he, too, was invisible.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he got his horse back, for Dick must have been
stole, the same as was Cap."</p>

<p>And, grateful for having regained possession of his horse, he
patted the silken neck of the noble animal.</p>

<p>Grizzly's years of experience with cattle apprised him of a gratifying
truth. The course of the stampeded herd was changing. Instead
of fleeing away from the main body they were veering around, so
that, if the change of course continued, they would return to
the neighbourhood from which they started.</p>

<p>Panic-smitten cattle are not apt to do a thing of that kind of
their own accord. Some cause, and a strong one, too, must have
effected this diversion in the line of flight. All at once, above
the din, sounded the penetrating voice of a man, who was striving
with herculean energy to change the course of the wild animals.</p>

<p>One sound of that voice was sufficient to identify it as Budd
Hankinson's. He must have played his cards well to have done all
this in so brief a space of time.</p>

<p>And such had been the case beyond a doubt. Budd suspected from
the first what did not enter Grizzly's mind until it flashed upon
him as described. The fact that neither of their horses appeared
when summoned convinced Budd that they had been stolen. True,
even in that case they would have obeyed the signal, had they
been near enough, and had the circumstances allowed them to identify
it; but, although not far off, the noise immediately around them
shut out the call of Grizzly from their ears, until he repeated
it, as has been told.</p>

<p>Hankinson anticipated his friend in this act. In his case, the
thief in the saddle of Dick gave it up at once. He leaped off,
and whisked out of sight. It was then Budd called to Grizzly that
the thieves had their horses; but the other did not catch his
words, and, therefore, gave them no further heed.</p>

<p>The instant Budd's feet were in the stirrups he set his horse
bounding along the side of the herd, with the purpose of checking
the stampede by changing its course. Grizzly understood matters
and set off after him, leaving to the sagacious Cap to thread
his way to the other side of the running cattle.</p>

<p>In the course of a few minutes the ranchers opened communication
and pushed their work with a vigor which brought good results.
The cattle were tired. They had been on their feet most of the
day while grazing, were growing fat, and naturally were indisposed
to severe exertion. Their pace dropped to a walk, and sooner than
would have been supposed, the fright passed off. The herders kept
them moving until close to the main herd, where they were allowed
to rest. Budd and Grizzly dismounted once more, turning their
horses loose, and seated themselves on the ground. The night,
as will be remembered, was mild, and they did not need their blankets
to make them comfortable.</p>

<p>"Wal," was the smiling remark of Grizzly, as he began refilling
his pipe, "my leg didn't deceive me this time."</p>

<p>"No, I'll own up it played square; but, Grizzly, if we've got
to fight the red varmints as well as rustlers, there will be some
lively fun in Wyoming and Montana before the thing is over."</p>

<p>"The Injins won't take a hand in this. You know who them two
thieves were, don't you?"</p>

<p>"A couple of 'dog Injins,' of course."</p>

<p>"There isn't anybody else that's got anything to do with this;
it's sort of queer&mdash;that is, it has struck me so two or three
times&mdash;that the Injins have tramps among 'em the same as white
folks. They call 'em 'dog Injins,' I s'pose, 'cause they don't
claim any particular tribe, but tramp back and forth over the
country, slipping off their reservations whenever they get a chance."</p>

<p>"Yes, there are plenty of 'em," assented Budd; "we've met 'em
before; you'll find 'em as far north as the Saskatchewan and as
low down as the Rio Grande. But I say, Grizzly, they were two
slick ones; I never seen finer work."</p>

<p>"Nor me either; if they had been satisfied with taking our hosses
we'd never seen 'em agin. Gracious!" added the rancher, "for myself,
I'd rather lost half the herd than Cap."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said Budd, after smoking a moment in silence,
"that although them 'dog Injins' was pretty smart in getting out
of the way when we come down on 'em, they weren't smart in trying
to run off the cattle. They must have known we'd find it out at
daylight and would be after 'em hot-footed."</p>

<p>Grizzly had been puzzling over the same phase of the question.
The 'dog Indian' is a vagabond, who, belonging to some particular
tribe, as of necessity must be the case, affiliates with none,
but goes whithersoever his will leads him, provided he is not
prevented. Sometimes they remain on the reservation for weeks
and months, as orderly, industrious and well-behaved as the best
of the red men. Then they disappear, and may not turn up for a
long time. In truth, they are as likely not to turn up at all,
but to lead their wandering, useless lives just as the vagrants
do in civilized communities.</p>

<p>Surely the couple who had played their parts in the incidents
of the night must have known that nothing could be gained by stampeding
a part of Whitney's herd. The cattle were branded, and could not
be disposed of for that reason. Besides, a couple of Indians in
charge of several hundred cattle would be objects of suspicion
themselves, and certain to be called to account. They could make
no common cause with the rustlers, for the latter would have naught
to do with them.</p>

<p>More than likely Grizzly Weber hit the truth when he said:</p>

<p>"It was a piece of pure deviltry on their part. When they got
into the saddles they felt safe. Instead of making off with the
hosses, they thought they would stir up a little fun by stampeding
the cattle. After injuring 'em by rapid driving for a good many
miles they would have paid no more attention to 'em, and let us
find 'em as best we could."</p>

<p>"Yes," assented Budd, "they bit off more'n they could chaw, and
so lost the hosses. But, Grizzly, have you noticed there's been
several guns shot off around the country to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yas," replied the other, indifferently; "I've heard 'em several
times, but I haven't obsarved any coming from the house; it must
be that some of the boys are having fun to-night instead of sleeping
like lambs, as they ought to do."</p>

<p>"And there'll be more of it to-morrow, but that's what we've
got to expect at all times. I'm going to sleep; call me when you
want me."</p>

<p>Budd spread the blanket, which he had taken from the back of
his horse, on the ground and lay down. Hardly five minutes passed
when he was wrapped in sound slumber. To prevent himself from
becoming unconscious, Grizzly rose and walked slowly around and
among the herd. He had no thought of anything further occurring,
for the 'dog Indians' would be certain to keep away from that
neighbourhood after what had occurred. He did not feel easy, however,
concerning his friends at the ranch. He knew trouble was at hand,
and he would have been glad if the mother and daughter were removed
beyond danger. The sounds of rifle-firing and the bright glow
in the horizon, made by a burning building, confirmed his misgivings
as to what a few days or hours were sure to bring forth.</p>
