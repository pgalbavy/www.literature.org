<p>The doubts as to his own usefulness in the world, noticed in
the last chapter, wore off naturally as he fell into the routine
of country life; but it was the growth of the younger generation—of
you for whom this sketch is written—which found him in work and
interest during the last years of his life. I could never have
envied him anything; but if there was one talent of his more than
another which I have longed to share, it was his power of winning,
not only the love, but the frank confidence, of his own, and all
other boys. I think the secret was, that he was far more in sympathy
with them; could realize more vividly their pleasures, and troubles,
than almost any man of his age. And then, he had never given up
athletic games altogether, and was still a far better cricketer
and football player than most boys, and ready to join them in
their sports whenever they seemed to wish it.</p>

<p>Few things gave him more pleasure than taking up again the thread
of intimate relations with his old school, which he did when his
eldest nephew entered there. He accompanied him, to give him confidence
and a good start, and characteristically recounts that "we had
a famous football match, and I got my legs kicked to my heart’s
content, thereby vividly recalling old times." He remarks also,
at the same time, "Rugby is charming; only there is rather too
much what I call ‘drill,’ in the play as in the work—not spontaneous
enough." Not long after, in 1866, his own eldest boy followed.
He thus details that event to his mother:—</p>

<p>
"<em>OFFLEY, </em><em>September 27, 1866</em>.

</p>
<p>
"We went to Rugby last Thursday, and the new-comers were<br/>
examined on Friday and Saturday. As we rather feared,<br/>
Herby failed to get into the Middle School. We were rather<br/>
disappointed, and he, poor boy, was in despair, as he was<br/>
afraid Arnold would not take him, and that he would have to go<br/>
to Mr. Furness; however, Arnold offered to make an exception<br/>
in his case, and as we joyfully accepted it, Master Herby<br/>
was duly installed in his uncle’s study, and we left him on<br/>
Monday morning very happy, and delighted with his new dignity<br/>
of a public school boy. Our visit to Rugby was very pleasant,<br/>
and not a little exciting. The school is much altered since<br/>
my time—the boys are much more accurately dressed, less<br/>
rollicking, and more decorous. The exceeding quiet of the town<br/>
and playground struck me particularly. I should like to have<br/>
seen a little more running about, and to have heard a little<br/>
more shouting; in fact a jolly curly-haired youngster with whom<br/>
I made a casual acquaintance, said to me, ‘I am sure, sir, you<br/>
must have had much more fun in your time than we have.’ It is<br/>
perhaps just as well that they should have become quieter.<br/>
The recognized name for the anxious parents who bring their<br/>
boys up for examination is the ‘Early Fathers,’ because, I<br/>
suppose, they take care to be at the schoolroom-door with their<br/>
Hopefuls a quarter of an hour before the examination begins.<br/>
Jenny Lind’s boy has just gone to the School-house; he is,<br/>
as boys say, awfully ’cute, and came out nearly head of the<br/>
examination. Jenny Lind was at chapel herself on Sunday; her<br/>
husband has done much for the music of the school; the singing<br/>
in chapel is exceedingly good, and the whole service very<br/>
impressive. The last time I was in chapel there was in poor<br/>
Arnold’s time. The master of Herby’s form, Mr. Buckoll, was my<br/>
old master when I was in the shell thirty years ago! Also Mrs.<br/>
Jacomb, of the principal tuck shop, used to spoil our stomachs<br/>
in my time. I felt myself rather boyish again, without the<br/>
boisterous spirits and good stomach of boyhood."

</p>
</div>
<p>From this time he constantly visited the school, and kept his
mother and sister informed of the progress of the boys. I add
a few extracts from his letters:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"<em>November, 1866.</em>—I was at Rugby last Saturday, and stayed<br/>
over Sunday. Walter breakfasted with me on Sunday morning, and<br/>
very jolly he was. He and Herby won’t see much of one another<br/>
until they get higher in the school. Junior boys never enter<br/>
each other’s boarding-houses. This is very absurd, but no power<br/>
on earth can alter boys’ fashions."

</p>
<p>
"<em>EATON SOCON, </em><em>November 26th, 1867</em>.

</p>
<p>
"Boys’ letters get so full of school slang that it is hard to<br/>
understand them. Herbert says in his last that he got 100<br/>
lines from Chumley for <em>tweaking</em>. This was Hebrew to us, as<br/>
‘tweaking’ was not a Rugby word in my time. On referring the<br/>
matter to Ned, he immediately informed us that ‘tweaking’ in<br/>
boys’ language was, shooting shot out of a catapult, or other<br/>
warlike engine."

</p>
<p>
"<em>OFFLEY, <em>1868</em></em>.

</p>
<p>
"We have excellent accounts from Rugby. Herbert is at the head<br/>
of his form, and evidently finds his work easier, and is in<br/>
a high state of encouragement. One of his schoolfellows has<br/>
just shot himself in the leg with a ‘saloon,’ meaning a saloon<br/>
pistol. Hang all pistols, but boys will have them."

</p>
<p>
"<em>OFFLEY, </em><em>October 7th, 1868</em>.

</p>
<p>
"Concerning schoolboys’ etiquette, it beats all other<br/>
etiquette. Public schools cultivate reserve, and so strongly<br/>
that I think one never gets quite rid of it, although one gets<br/>
better in after-life. I wish it was not so; it is one of the<br/>
drawbacks of public schools, which are on the whole excellent<br/>
institutions. One must take the sours with the sweets.

</p>
<p>
"Herbert would not think of speaking to a schoolfellow (not<br/>
on a par with himself), unless first spoken to. And in public<br/>
schools the great ‘swells’ are those distinguished at cricket,<br/>
football, &amp;c. Then come the sixth, by virtue of their legal<br/>
power. Then the great middle class, including clever, stupid,<br/>
pleasant, unpleasant, &amp;c., and then the new boys, and the very<br/>
small boys. All the power and influence is in the hands of the<br/>
athletes, and the sixth form, and all the rest pay them (the<br/>
athletes) the greatest respect, and the most willing obedience.<br/>
They obey the sixth (lawful authority) less willingly. All this<br/>
is not quite satisfactory, but it might be worse. At all events<br/>
Temple, who is a tremendous Radical, knows it and allows, nay,<br/>
encourages it. But I find that few people are Radicals in their<br/>
own departments."

</p>
<p>
"<em>OFFLEY, </em><em>November 7th, 1868</em>.

</p>
<p>
"I went for the day to see the old Rug. match, and gave Walter<br/>
and Herbert a dinner at the ‘Shoes’ before going away. Walter<br/>
played in the match, and the young ones gave it the old Rugs<br/>
hot, much to my delight. Walter seemed wonderfully well, and<br/>
ditto Herbert. He always looks pale at school, but he was<br/>
in high spirits, and evidently enjoys school life. He is<br/>
very different from me in some things; his study is awfully<br/>
’cute (that’s boys’ English, and means tidy and full of<br/>
knick-knacks); in fact he is a bit of a dandy; I was not. Also<br/>
he must be a better boy than I was, for his character is really<br/>
first-rate in everything; and the masters used always to row me<br/>
for not doing as much as I could. That was the burden of their<br/>
song."

</p>
</div>
<p>As a complement to these letters, I add here extracts from those
to his eldest boy:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Thank you much for your letter received this morning; you are<br/>
very good in writing so regularly, and I hope you will keep up<br/>
the habit, for (I repeat) there is no pleasure to us so great<br/>
as to receive your letters. We are glad to hear you are ‘all<br/>
right’ in your form. I have no objection to the Rifle corps.<br/>
It would be odd if I had, as I was a Volunteer myself; only<br/>
go into it heartily, and learn your drill well. It is capital<br/>
exercise, and it will do you good to be ‘set up,’ as you stoop<br/>
too much. I should not think, however, that Temple would let<br/>
the Rugby volunteers go to Windsor. If he thinks proper to do<br/>
so, of course I have no objection. I suppose that as usual<br/>
you are ‘hard up,’ so I send you a <em>P.O. </em>order. You must learn<br/>
to exercise a little forethought and self-denial about money<br/>
matters: you spend more than your income. You must overcome<br/>
this habit, for it would embarrass and, perhaps, ruin you<br/>
hereafter."

</p>
</div>
<p>The next extract refers to some help in his work which his father
sent him from time to time:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I depend upon your looking out all the words, and working it<br/>
out for yourself with the help of my translation. You promised<br/>
me to do this, and I know you are a boy of your word, otherwise<br/>
I shouldn’t think it right to help you. Your tutor may ask if<br/>
you have any assistance. If he does you must say you found<br/>
it very hard (which it really is for a boy of your age), and<br/>
asked me to help you. There is nothing like being open and<br/>
truth-telling with your masters, and every one. If he objects<br/>
to my helping you, you must do the best you can without it,<br/>
like a man; but I don’t think he will object. Your place in the<br/>
form seems very satisfactory: if you <em>do</em> get out we shall be<br/>
very much pleased, but don’t make yourself anxious about it,<br/>
only do your best...."

</p>
</div>
<p>Again at the beginning of the following half-year:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"The reason you give for having lost a few places is no doubt<br/>
the right one—that you have not got yet into the swing—it will<br/>
be all right in a week or two. I have no doubt you will get<br/>
your remove at the end of term easily enough. The <em>exam.</em> (if<br/>
I understand rightly) consists of subjects which you prepare<br/>
during term, and there is not much ‘unseen.’ This will be an<br/>
advantage to you over the idle ones who don’t prepare their<br/>
work. I shall be delighted to help you in any way, if you will<br/>
only let me know, and give me due notice. Perhaps you won’t<br/>
believe me when I assure you again, that Latin prose will come<br/>
to you as well as cricket and football in good time; but it<br/>
is the truth nevertheless. At your age I often felt the same<br/>
discouragement which you feel. I had rather overgrown myself<br/>
like you, and was longer ‘ripening’ (to use an expressive<br/>
phrase) than many fellows who did not grow so fast; but it<br/>
all came right in my case, as it will in yours. Therefore <em>en<br/>
avant</em> and don’t be discouraged...."

</p>
<p>
"We are very glad to hear that you are in upper-middle one, and<br/>
it will make us very happy if you can get another remove at<br/>
Christmas. It is to be done if you like, and as you cannot play<br/>
football just now (worse luck) you will have more time. Don’t<br/>
you want some help in your tutor work? If so, send me the book;<br/>
or is there anything else in which I can help you? You are now<br/>
rapidly becoming a young man, and have probably some influence<br/>
in the school, and will have more. Be kind to the new boys and<br/>
juniors; even if they are ‘scrubby,’ your business is to polish<br/>
them, and you will do this much better by a little kind advice<br/>
than by making their lives a burden (I don’t say, mind, that<br/>
you are unkind to them). Don’t ‘bosh’ your masters. Remember<br/>
that they are gentlemen like yourself, and that it is insulting<br/>
them to ‘bosh’ them when they are taking trouble with you. As<br/>
to the sixth form, I don’t quite approve of all the customs<br/>
thereof, but it is an institution of the school, and, on the<br/>
whole, beneficial, and it is no use kicking against it. Now I<br/>
have done with my preaching. I don’t know that it is necessary,<br/>
but it can do you no harm, and I know you respect my opinion.<br/>
Your mother is horrified at your signing yourself ‘Hughes,’<br/>
<em>tout court</em> (as the French say), so to please her don’t forget<br/>
to put in ‘your affectionate son’ (as I know you are). God<br/>
bless you.

</p>
<p>
"Yours most affectionately,

</p>
<p>
"G. E. <em>HUGHES</em>."

</p>
<p>
"I was much pleased by your writing so openly to me. It<br/>
will make me very happy if you will treat me with perfect<br/>
confidence in all matters. You need have no fear that I shall<br/>
not understand and sympathise with you, for although (as we<br/>
have said in joke) I was a Rugbeian in the time of the ancient<br/>
Britons, when we had no breeches, and painted ourselves blue<br/>
for decency’s sake, it seems to me a very short time since I<br/>
was as you are, and I have a very vivid recollection of my<br/>
youth, feelings, prejudices, faults, and all the rest of it."

</p>
</div>
<p>And then, after some advice about his matriculation at Oxford,
his father goes on:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"I am not going to preach to you about billiards. If there had<br/>
been a table at Rugby in my time (there was none), I might<br/>
very possibly have played myself; although, like you, I should<br/>
certainly not have made a habit of it, preferring, as I did<br/>
and do, more active amusements. Don’t play again at Rugby; it<br/>
would be childish, as well as wrong, to risk leaving the school<br/>
under a cloud, for such a paltry gratification. I don’t agree<br/>
with you in comparing billiards to your school games: billiards<br/>
(public) generally involve smoking, and a certain amount of<br/>
drinking, and losing money (or winning, which is worse); and<br/>
engender a sort of lounging habit. I am afraid you have rather<br/>
a fast lot at Rugby, and what you tell me about card-playing<br/>
makes me rather anxious about Jack. It is altogether abominably<br/>
bad form, and I wish you would get up an opposition to it. It<br/>
ought to be put down for the credit of the school. I must say<br/>
that there was no such card-playing in my time. Having said my<br/>
say, I must leave you to do what you can, in concert with any<br/>
other big fellows in the house, who may be brought to see the<br/>
matter in my light."

</p>
</div>
<p>The "Jack" referred to in the last letter was his third boy,
who was now in his first term at a preparatory school for Rugby.
This chapter may fitly close with his letters to this, the youngest
of his boys whom he lived to see launched at school. He was a
favourite subject of study to his father, who writes of him at
Pau, years before: "Jack will be, I think, the strongest of the
lot. He always clears his plate, fat and all, and always clears
his lesson, however disagreeable;" and again, to his sister, who
was the boy’s godmother:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Your favourite Jack is always running after me, and is a very<br/>
good boy, and surprisingly good company too. He has not quite<br/>
forgotten how to ‘beak’ himself when he feels insulted. About<br/>
a week ago the children had some shrimps for tea, and Jack<br/>
was offended because he was presented with a ‘baby’ shrimp<br/>
instead of a big one; so he pushed his chair from the table,<br/>
and prostrated himself on his knees, with his nose in the<br/>
carpet. After remaining for five minutes in that position, he<br/>
felt better. It is a more amusing way of getting rid of steam<br/>
than crying. Children have the funniest fancies in the world.<br/>
There is a Scotch terrier next door to us, with a grave and<br/>
venerable face, and a long grey beard. Jack said one day, ‘that<br/>
doggy like Moses coming down de mountain;’ and so he really is<br/>
like Moses, in one of those little woodcuts in which children<br/>
delight, but I should never have thought of such a ridiculous<br/>
comparison."

"<em>DEAREST OLD BOY</em>,

</p>
<p>
"Here we are all right, and I wish we had your jolly face at<br/>
the other end of the table, for we miss you very much. I have<br/>
begun golf, but there are not many golfers here yet; however,<br/>
there is one very good player named Oliphant, so I have not<br/>
much chance of the medal. Your friends the Molesworths are both<br/>
gone to Radley School, near Oxford. There are only 100 boys<br/>
there, but it is a nice place, and being near the Thames, they<br/>
get plenty of rowing; in fact, that is their chief amusement.<br/>
Ned plays golf with me, but has not got into his play yet. You<br/>
are a good old boy for writing so often, and I hope you will<br/>
continue it. Nothing gives us so much pleasure as your letters<br/>
and Herbert’s, and don’t think that anything that happens to<br/>
you is too trifling to tell us of. Now about your letter. I<br/>
always thought that you would find the lessons rather a grind<br/>
at first: you see it is your first school, and you have had no<br/>
experience in working with a lot of other boys, perhaps making<br/>
a row, and idling around you. Never mind. It will get easier<br/>
every day, and besides, I believe that you have something of<br/>
the bull-dog about you, and won’t be discouraged by a little<br/>
hardship and difficulty at first. I hope you will be one of<br/>
your fifteen, for then I shall come up to see you play, but<br/>
anyhow I am as certain as I can be of anything that you will be<br/>
first-rate at football some day, and a first-rate scholar too,<br/>
I hope. The two things often go together. All well, and send<br/>
best love. Mamma and Argy hope your shoulder is not much hurt,<br/>
and I have no doubt it is all right again. God bless you.

"Thank you for your letters, which interest us immensely. Boys<br/>
make the most absurd customs, as you will find out: it is<br/>
better to give way to their customs in a good-tempered way; new<br/>
boys are not admitted at once to the full privileges. It does<br/>
not much matter, as I hope you won’t be long at ——. Boys think<br/>
it very fine and manly not to prepare their lessons, whereas in<br/>
fact nothing can be more childish. Take your own way, and never<br/>
mind them. It is half pretence with them, and they will respect<br/>
you more if they see you have your own way. You need not<br/>
stand being ‘sat upon,’ and yet you can be good-tempered and<br/>
obliging, but, above all, don’t forget what I said to you when<br/>
we parted. Don’t forget the lessons you have learnt at home (I<br/>
don’t mean Latin and Greek). God bless you. Write as often as<br/>
you have time.

<p>
"<em>DEAREST OLD BOY</em>,

</p>
<p>
"Thank you for your letters. They are well written and spelt,<br/>
and creditable to you in every way. Although it is not pleasant<br/>
to us to hear that you are miserable (or rather uncomfortable,<br/>
for ‘miserable’ is a strong word), yet we always like to hear<br/>
exactly what you feel. I don’t think you <em>can</em> be exactly<br/>
miserable, for I believe that you are doing your best. God<br/>
will not suffer us to be miserable (at least not for any<br/>
time) whilst we do our duty. Don’t be discouraged about your<br/>
work; you see it is your first plunge into school. All your<br/>
schoolfellows have had more experience than you: practice will<br/>
give you the quickness and accuracy that you want.

</p>
<p>
"Your feelings towards us are quite natural: when you are at<br/>
home, perfectly happy, although you do not love us less, you do<br/>
not feel it so much; when you are thrown among a lot of people<br/>
who do not much care about you, you find out the value of our<br/>
love for you, and think more of us. However, you have Herbert,<br/>
and I daresay you think that you love him better now than ever<br/>
you did at home. As we are all sinful and imperfect creatures,<br/>
I have no doubt that you have sometimes done and said things<br/>
which we should be sorry to hear of. You must ask God to help<br/>
you to do better in future; but I must say that I have always<br/>
found you good and obedient, and you have never given us any<br/>
anxiety. There is one lesson which you ought to learn from<br/>
your present feelings of discomfort and worry; when you are a<br/>
big boy at Rugby, and see any poor little fellow worried and<br/>
uncomfortable, you must say a kind word to him (remembering<br/>
what you once felt yourself); you have no idea how much good a<br/>
kind word from a big fellow (what you call a swell) will do to<br/>
a poor little beggar. You remember how kind Gardner was, and<br/>
how much he was liked at Rugby for it. All are well, and send<br/>
best love. I fully intend to come to see you when I get back to<br/>
Offley—perhaps to the old Rug. match. God bless you.

"I know why you feel rather down in the mouth just now. You<br/>
have (to use a phrase in athletics) lost your first wind, and<br/>
haven’t yet got your <em>second</em> wind. The novelty of excitement<br/>
of school life has gone off, and you are too new to it yet<br/>
to enjoy what there is enjoyable in it. Courage! I know your<br/>
feelings well, having experienced them myself. So has Herbert:<br/>
so, in short, has everyone who has ever been at school. You<br/>
will soon get over it all, and like your school life, although<br/>
of course it is not so pleasant as home. Most schoolboys are<br/>
selfish and bad-mannered, and there are always plenty of snobs<br/>
and bullies amongst them; but there is always a minority of<br/>
nice fellows. I am inclined to believe that as you go so often<br/>
to Arnold’s, you have not made much acquaintance with your<br/>
schoolfellows. Perhaps it would be better to cultivate their<br/>
acquaintance more. Don’t be afraid about not getting into<br/>
Rugby. You ought to have heard Herbert’s doleful forebodings<br/>
about never being able to get out of lower school: he was much<br/>
more doleful than you, but if you were to remind him of it, he<br/>
would probably not remember it at all; neither will you a year<br/>
hence. If you are hungry, can’t you buy grub in the town? I<br/>
mean something like sausage-rolls, or hard eggs. I will give<br/>
you the money for it; or can you suggest any way in which we<br/>
can supply you? What do you do on Sundays? and to what church<br/>
do you go? I wish we could have you with us occasionally, just<br/>
as much as you do. All are well, and join in best love. God<br/>

doing well. I am very sorry that you were down in the mouth at<br/>
my departure. I should like to have you always with me, but you<br/>
(being a boy of good sense) must know very well that it cannot<br/>
be: you must (like all others) fly from the nest some time or<br/>
other, and school is the preparation for a longer flight. I<br/>

</p>
</div>
<p>In explanation of an allusion in the next letter, I insert an
extract of the same date, from one to his sister:—</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Jack is in high force, but has been having extra lessons (with<br/>
all his schoolfellows), in consequence of (what he calls) a<br/>
‘towel fight,’ and subsequent ‘war dance,’ in which the school<br/>
indulged in an irrepressible burst of youthful spirits. What<br/>
geese boys are!"

</p>
<p>
"<em>OFFLEY, </em><em>March 1872</em>.

</p>
<p>
"<em>DEAREST JACK</em>,

</p>
<p>
"I hope you got the hamper all right, and that the ‘grub’<br/>
was good and of the right sort. Your ‘war dance’ amused us<br/>
excessively, and of course there is no harm in a war dance;<br/>
but, if it is forbidden, what an old goose you are to risk<br/>
having impositions and extra lessons for it! But schoolboys are<br/>
always the same, and I can’t expect you to be wiser than the<br/>
rest.

</p>
<p>
"If you can’t make out why your copies are wrong, why don’t<br/>
you ask one of your schoolfellows? I suppose some of them are<br/>
good fellows, and would tell you your mistake; or say openly<br/>
to the master that you can’t find out, and I should think he<br/>
would enlighten you. At least, he <em>ought</em>. We shall have you<br/>
home in about three weeks, and right glad we shall be. Go at it<br/>
hard for the remainder of the term, for remember the entrance<br/>
Exam. You must work a little in the holidays to keep up what<br/>
you know. The boys are better, and have been playing football<br/>
vigorously. Best love to Herbert; ask him whether he wants any<br/>
cricket practice. I mean Hughes to bowl. God bless you.

</p>
<p>
"Yours most affectionately,

</p>
<p>
"G. E. H."

<p>Westward Ho, from which several of the preceding letters were
written, had become his favourite watering-place. He had gone
there at first by chance, and, finding links and a golf club,
had taken to the game with his usual success. At Pau he had played
a little, but certainly never handled a club till he was past
forty. Nevertheless, though it is a game in which, I am told,
early training and constant practice is almost an essential condition
of success, he entered for, and succeeded in winning the champion’s
medal in the annual gathering of 1870. Soon after his return from
the meeting he wrote to me.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"We spent three very pleasant weeks at Westward Ho. I wish that<br/>
I could infect you with ‘golfomania.’ Golf is <em>the</em> middle-aged<br/>
man’s game. I mean by the middle-aged man, the man who could<br/>
<em>once</em>, but cannot <em>now</em>, get down upon a leg shooter. We had a<br/>
dozen hard-worked men from the city, besides doctors, lawyers,<br/>
soldiers on leave, etc., all perfectly mad whilst it lasted.<br/>
I was quite as mad as the rest, and having now ‘relapsed’<br/>
into sanity, I am able to look back upon it with the most<br/>
intense amusement. The humour of the whole thing was positively<br/>
sublime. You have heard squires at their wine after a good<br/>
run—bless you, they can’t hold a candle to golfers. Most of the<br/>
players were Scotch, and the earnestness with which the Scotch<br/>
‘play’ is a caution. I think of trying my hand at a rhapsody<br/>
about golf."

</p>
</div>
<p>The rhapsody was, I believe, never written, but he continued
to like and practise the game till his death, which indeed is,
in my mind, rather painfully connected with it. My last visit
to Offley was in the short Easter vacation of this year, and I
thought I had never seen him better, or in more full vigour of
body and mind. On the 30th of March he mounted me, and I rode
with him and two of his boys to a meet near Offley. We had a run
early in the day, and got home to a late lunch, after which he
went out into his plantations and worked till dark. Indeed, when
I left the same evening by the mail train for the north, I beguiled
my journey by thinking that the whole kingdom might be searched
in vain to find a finer specimen of a man. On that day four weeks
I received a telegram from Hoylake to say that he was lying there
very dangerously ill. He had gone on there, after leaving his
boys at Rugby, to take part in the golf tournament. He went down
with a bad cold, but paid no attention to it, and went round the
links with some friends on the first evening. The next day he
became much worse, and was obliged to take to his bed, from which
he never got up. The cold had settled on his lungs, and violent
inflammation was set up. His wife and children were summoned at
once, and his mother and sister and myself two days later. When
I arrived, the lower part of the lungs had suppurated, and the
medical man gave very slight hopes of his recovery. He could only
speak with exceeding difficulty, but retained his strength, and
the grip of his hand was as strong as ever. He met death with
the same courage as he had shown throughout life, giving me a
few clear instructions for a codicil to his will, while his youngest
boy lay with his head on his shoulder, crying bitterly, and almost
with his last breath regretting the trouble he was giving his
nurse. On the afternoon of May 1st he received the Sacrament with
all of us, and at four on the morning of the 2nd passed away,
leaving behind him, I am proud to think, no braver or better man.
But you shall have better testimony than mine on this point. Out
of the many letters to the same purpose which I received, and
two of which have found a place in the earlier part of this memoir,
I select an extract from one written by Bishop MacDougal, who,
thirty years ago, had rowed behind him in the University boat.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"I must just write a line to express my heartfelt sympathy with<br/>
you in your sad, sad bereavement. Dear old George! What an<br/>
irreparable loss to you and all his old friends! I have myself<br/>
been heavy-hearted ever since I heard he had been called away<br/>
from us, and shall never think of his cheery voice, his hearty<br/>
greeting, his kindly, loving words, without a sharp pang of<br/>
regret that I shall no more in this life meet with him I loved<br/>
so well, and admired as the finest specimen of the high-minded,<br/>
earnest, true-hearted English gentleman it has been my lot to<br/>
meet with. He was too good for this hard, selfish generation,<br/>
and he is in God’s mercy called away to that better world,<br/>
where love and truth and peace dwell undisturbed in the<br/>
presence of our blessed Lord. May we, my dear Tom, have grace<br/>
given us so to fight the good fight of truth and faith, that<br/>
when our work is done we may be called thither to join your<br/>
dear brother and our other loved ones, who have gained the<br/>
victory over self and the world, and have been called to their<br/>
rest before us."
