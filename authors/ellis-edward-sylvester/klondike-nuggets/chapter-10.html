<p>"We're doing well," observed Tim McCabe, when the raft with its
load and party of gold-seekers reached the end of Lynx River,
"but be the same token, we're drawing nigh the worst part of the
voyage, and we'll be lucky if we git through the same without
mishap."</p>

<p>"What have we ahead?" asked Jeff.</p>

<p>"Miles Cañon; it's a little more than half a mile long, and if
this raft isn't as strong as it should be it'll be torn to pieces."</p>

<p>Fortunately Jeff had given attention from the first to the stability
of the structure, upon which everything depended. He was continually
examining it from stem to stern, and where there was a suspicion
of the necessity, he drove nails and strengthened the craft in
every way possible.</p>

<p>The sail was used whenever possible; but since they were really
among the network of lakes which form the headwaters of the Yukon,
the current carried them steadily toward their destination, and
there were hours when they scarcely lifted their hands except
to keep the raft in proper position by means of the poles. The
weather grew steadily milder, for summer was approaching. The
snow and ice rapidly melted, and now and then, when the sun shone,
the thick clothing felt uncomfortable during the middle of the
day. Our friends were in advance of the great multitude that were
pushing toward the Klondike from the south, from Canada and to
St. Michael's, whence they would start on the two-thousand-mile
climb of the Yukon, as soon as it shook off its icy bounds.</p>

<p>It was impossible that the party should not view with solicitude
their entrance into Miles Cañon, though Tim assured his friends
that much more dangerous rapids would remain to be passed. The
cañon is five-eighths of a mile long, with an angry and swift
current. Although the raft was tossed about like a cockleshell,
it went through without injury, and none of the goods were displaced
or harmed.</p>

<p>Following this came the severest kind of work. For three miles
it seemed as if the river could be no worse, and the raft must
be wrenched asunder. The current was not only very swift, but
the channel was filled with rocks. Each man grasped one of the
strong poles with which the craft was provided, and wrought with
might and main to steer clear of the treacherous masses of stone
which thrust up their heads everywhere. There were many narrow
escapes, and despite the utmost they could do, the raft struck
repeatedly. Sometimes it was a bump and sheer to one side so suddenly
that the party were almost knocked off their feet. Once, owing
to unintentional contrary work the raft banged against the head
of a rock and stood still. While the men were desperately plying
their poles the current slewed the craft around, and the voyage
was resumed.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE CURRENT WAS NOT ONLY VERY SWIFT, BUT THE
CHANNEL WAS FILLED WITH ROCKS</em>.]</p>

<p>"Look out!" shouted Jeff; "there's another rock right ahead!"</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was just below the surface, and there were so
many ripples and eddies in the current that neither Tim nor Hardman
was sure of its exact location, but taking their cue from the
leader, they pushed with all their strength to clear the obstruction.</p>

<p>They failed, and the flinty head swept directly under the logs
and gouged its course for the entire length of the craft. All
felt the jar, and those who could look beneath the upper deck
saw the lower timbers rise from the impact, which was so severe
that when the raft at last swung free it was barely moving, but,
like a wounded horse, it shook itself clear, and the next moment
was plunging forward as impetuously as ever. The fears of the
party were intensified by sight of wreckage along the banks, proving
that more than one of their predecessors had come to grief in
trying to make the passage.</p>

<p>While all were on edge with the danger, however, they found themselves
at the end of the perilous passage and floating in comparatively
smooth water again. Men and boys drew sighs of relief, the former
mopping their perspiring brows and looking their mutual congratulations.</p>

<p>"The fun is only just begun," said Tim McCabe; "we had matters
purty lively fur a time, but they'll soon be a good deal livelier."</p>

<p>"What is next due?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"I belave," said Tim, "that some folks spake of death as riding
on a pale horse, don't they?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That must be the raison they call the nixt plisure thramp White
Horse Cañon, or White Horse Rapids."</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"But a little way ahid; many men have been drowned in thrying
to sail through the same; and him as doesn't know how to swim
in a whirlpool hasn't ony business to thry it."</p>

<p>"What, then, do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"Thry it," was the imperturbable response.</p>

<p>Such talk was not calculated to cheer the listeners, but knowing
the Irishman as they did, they received his statement with less
seriousness than they should have done, for he had by no means
overrated the peril in their front. Jeff made another examination
of the raft while he had the opportunity, and strengthened it
in every possible way. He was pleased that it stood the test so
well, though it had been severely wrenched, and when it crawled
over the sunken rock it had narrowly missed being torn asunder.
The fastenings of the goods were examined and everything prepared,
so far as it could be done, for the crucial trial at hand.</p>

<p>The party were seated in various positions about the raft, looking
anxiously ahead, when Tim pointed a little way in advance, with
the question:</p>

<p>"Do ye all obsarve that?"</p>

<p>He indicated a high bank of sand on the right which had been
cut out by the erosion of the violent current. Near by some philanthropist
had put up a sign, "Keep a Good Look Out."</p>

<p>"You have larned what other people think of the same," he added;
"there's been more than twinty men drowned in there."</p>

<p>"Because they could not swim?" asked Frank.</p>

<p>"'Cause the best swimmer in the world can't swim in there; you
and mesilf, boys, will soon be on the same futting, for the raison
that we won't have any futting at all."</p>

<p>"How long is the cañon?"</p>

<p>"Not quite half a mile. Miles Cañon, that we've just passed through,
is like a duck-pond alongside the rapids in front of us."</p>

<p>"Can a boat go through?"</p>

<p>"The thing has been done, but only about one in fifty that starts
into them rapids ever raiches the outlet, excipt in bits the size
of yer hand."</p>

<p>Frank and Roswell looked at each other in consternation. Was
it possible that Jeff would allow the criminal recklessness Tim
contemplated? Where the chances were so overwhelmingly against
success, it was throwing away their lives to trust themselves
to the fearful rapids that had already caused so many deaths.</p>

<p>"If you want to try," said Roswell, excitedly, "you may do so,
but neither Frank nor I will. Put us ashore!"</p>

<p>He addressed himself to Jeff, who was seated on the edge of the
upper deck, calmly smoking his pipe. He did not look around nor
seem to hear the appeal.</p>

<p>"Never mind," interposed Frank; "if they are willing, we are
not the ones to back out. I know of no law that prevents a man
making a fool of himself."</p>

<p>"Very well," replied his cousin, more composedly, "I am ready."</p>
