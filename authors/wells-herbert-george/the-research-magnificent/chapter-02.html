The oldest novel in the world at any rate, White reflected, was a
story with a hero and no love interest worth talking about.  It was
the story of Tobias and how he came out from the shelters of his
youth into this magic and intricate world.  Its heroine was
incidental, part of the spoil, a seven times relict. . . .
<P>
White had not read the book of Tobit for many years, and what he was
really thinking of was not that ancient story at all, but
Botticelli's picture, that picture of the sunlit morning of life.
When you say "Tobias" that is what most intelligent people will
recall.  Perhaps you will remember how gaily and confidently the
young man strides along with the armoured angel by his side.
Absurdly enough, Benham and his dream of high aristocracy reminded
White of that. . . .
<P>
"We have all been Tobias in our time," said White.
<P>
If White had been writing this chapter he would have in all
probability called it THE TOBIAS STAGE, forgetful that there was no
Tobit behind Benham and an entirely different Sara in front of him.

From Cambridge Benham came to London.  For the first time he was to
live in London.  Never before had he been in London for more than a
few days at a time.  But now, guided by his mother's advice, he was
to have a flat in Finacue street, just round the corner from
Desborough Street, a flat very completely and delightfully furnished
under her supervision.  It had an admirable study, in which she had
arranged not only his books, but a number of others in beautiful old
leather bindings that it had amused her extremely to buy; it had a
splendid bureau and business-like letter-filing cabinets, a neat
little drawing-room and a dining-room, well-placed abundant electric
lights, and a man called Merkle whom she had selected very carefully
and who she felt would not only see to Benham's comfort but keep
him, if necessary, up to the mark.
<P>
This man Merkle seemed quite unaware that humanity "here and now"--
even as he was engaged in meticulously putting out Benham's clothes--
was ��leaving its ancestral shelters and going out upon the
greatest adventure that ever was in space or time."  If he had been
told as much by Benham he would probably have said, "Indeed, sir,"
and proceeded accurately with his duties.  And if Benham's voice had
seemed to call for any additional remark, he would probably have
added, "It's �igh time, sir, something of the sort was done.  Will
you have the white wesket as before, sir, or a fresh one this
evening? . . .  Unless it's a very special occasion, sir. . . .
Exactly, sir.  THANK you, sir."
<P>
And when her son was properly installed in his apartments Lady
Marayne came round one morning with a large experienced-looking
portfolio and rendered an account of her stewardship of his estate
that was already some months overdue.  It was all very confused and
confusing, and there were inexplicable incidents, a heavy overdraft
at the bank for example, but this was Sir Godfrey's fault, she
explained.  "He never would help me with any of this business," she
said.  "I've had to add sometimes for HOURS.  But, of course, you
are a man, and when you've looked through it all, I know you'll
understand."
<P>
He did look through it enough to see that it was undesirable that he
should understand too explicitly, and, anyhow, he was manifestly
very well off indeed, and the circumstances of the case, even as he
understood them, would have made any businesslike book-keeping
ungracious.  The bankers submitted the corroborating account of
securities, and he found himself possessed of his unconditional six
thousand a year, with, as she put it, "the world at his feet."  On
the whole it seemed more wonderful to him now than when he had first
heard of it.  He kissed her and thanked her, and left the portfolio
open for Merkle's entirely honest and respectful but very exact
inspection, and walked back with her to Desborough Street, and all
the while he was craving to ask the one tremendous question he knew
he would never ask, which was just how exactly this beneficent Nolan
came in. . . .
<P>
Once or twice in the small hours, and on a number of other
occasions, this unspeakable riddle assumed a portentous predominance
in his mind.  He was forced back upon his inner consciousness for
its consideration.  He could discuss it with nobody else, because
that would have been discussing his mother.
<P>
Probably most young men who find themselves with riches at large in
the world have some such perplexity as this mixed in with the gift.
Such men as the Cecils perhaps not, because they are in the order of
things, the rich young Jews perhaps not, because acquisition is
their principle, but for most other intelligent inheritors there
must be this twinge of conscientious doubt.  "Why particularly am I
picked out for so tremendous an advantage?"  If the riddle is not
Nolan, then it is rent, or it is the social mischief of the
business, or the particular speculative COUP that established their
fortune.
<P>
"PECUNIA NON OLET," Benham wrote, "and it is just as well.  Or the
west-ends of the world would reek with deodorizers.  Restitution is
inconceivable; how and to whom?  And in the meanwhile here we are
lifted up by our advantage to a fantastic appearance of opportunity.
Whether the world looks to us or not to do tremendous things, it
ought to look to us.  And above all we ought to look to ourselves.
RICHESSE OBLIGE."
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
It is not to be supposed that Benham came to town only with a
general theory of aristocracy.  He had made plans for a career.
Indeed, he had plans for several careers.  None of them when brought
into contrast with the great spectacle of London retained all the
attractiveness that had saturated them at their inception.
<P>
They were all more or less political careers.  Whatever a democratic
man may be, Prothero and he had decided that an aristocratic man is
a public man.  He is made and protected in what he is by laws and
the state and his honour goes out to the state.  The aristocrat has
no right to be a voluptuary or a mere artist or a respectable
nonentity, or any such purely personal things.  Responsibility for
the aim and ordering of the world is demanded from him as
imperatively as courage.
<P>
Benham's deliberate assumption of the equestrian role brought him
into contact with a new set of acquaintances, conscious of political
destinies.  They were amiable, hard young men, almost affectedly
unaffected; they breakfasted before dawn to get in a day's hunting,
and they saw to it that Benham's manifest determination not to
discredit himself did not lead to his breaking his neck.  Their
bodies were beautifully tempered, and their minds were as flabby as
Prothero's body.  Among them were such men as Lord Breeze and Peter
Westerton, and that current set of Corinthians who supposed
themselves to be resuscitating the Young England movement and Tory
Democracy.  Poor movements which indeed have never so much lived as
suffered chronic resuscitation.  These were days when Tariff Reform
was only an inglorious possibility for the Tory Party, and Young
England had yet to demonstrate its mental quality in an anti-
socialist campaign.  Seen from the perspectives of Cambridge and
Chexington, the Tory party was still a credible basis for the
adventure of a young man with an aristocratic theory in his mind.
<P>
These were the days when the strain and extremity of a dangerous
colonial war were fresh in people's minds, when the quality of the
public consciousness was braced up by its recent response to
unanticipated demands.  The conflict of stupidities that had caused
the war was overlaid and forgotten by a hundred thousand devotions,
by countless heroic deaths and sufferings, by a pacification largely
conceived and broadly handled.  The nation had displayed a belated
regard for its honour and a sustained passion for great unities.  It
was still possible for Benham to regard the empire as a splendid
opportunity, and London as the conceivable heart of the world.  He
could think of Parliament as a career, and of a mingling of
aristocratic socialism based on universal service with a civilizing
imperialism as a purpose. . . .
<P>
But his thoughts had gone wider and deeper than that. . . .
<P>
Already when Benham came to London he had begun to dream of
possibilities that went beyond the accidental states and empires of
to-day.  Prothero's mind, replete with historical detail, could find
nothing but absurdity in the alliances and dynasties and loyalties
of our time.  "Patched up things, Benham, temporary, pretentious.
All very well for the undignified man, the democratic man, to take
shelter under, all very well for the humourist to grin and bear, all
very well for the crowd and the quack, but not for the aristocrat--
No!--his mind cuts like steel and burns like fire.  Lousy sheds they
are, plastered hoardings . . . and such a damned nuisance too!  For
any one who wants to do honourable things!  With their wars and
their diplomacies, their tariffs and their encroachments; all their
humbugging struggles, their bloody and monstrous struggles, that
finally work out to no end at all. . . .  If you are going for the
handsome thing in life then the world has to be a united world,
Benham, as a matter of course.  That was settled when the railways
and the telegraph came.  Telephones, wireless telegraphy, aeroplanes
insist on it.  We've got to mediatise all this stuff, all these
little crowns and boundaries and creeds, and so on, that stand in
the way.  Just as Italy had to be united in spite of all the rotten
little dukes and princes and republics, just as Germany had to be
united in spite of its scores of kingdoms and duchies and liberties,
so now the world.  Things as they are may be fun for lawyers and
politicians and court people and--douaniers; they may suit the loan-
mongers and the armaments shareholders, they may even be more
comfortable for the middle-aged, but what, except as an
inconvenience, does that matter to you or me?
<P>
Prothero always pleased Benham when he swept away empires.  There
was always a point when the rhetoric broke into gesture.
<P>
"We've got to sweep them away, Benham," he said, with a wide gesture
of his arm.  "We've got to sweep them all away."
<P>
Prothero helped himself to some more whiskey, and spoke hastily,
because he was afraid some one else might begin.  He was never safe
from interruption in his own room.  The other young men present
sucked at their pipes and regarded him doubtfully.  They were never
quite certain whether Prothero was a prophet or a fool.  They could
not understand a mixed type, and he was so manifestly both.
<P>
"The only sane political work for an intelligent man is to get the
world-state ready.  For that we have to prepare an aristocracy--"
<P>
"Your world-state will be aristocratic?" some one interpolated.
<P>
"Of course it will be aristocratic.  How can uninformed men think
all round the globe?  Democracy dies five miles from the parish
pump.  It will be an aristocratic republic of all the capable men in
the world. . . ."
<P>
"Of course," he added, pipe in mouth, as he poured out his whiskey,
"it's a big undertaking.  It's an affair of centuries. . . ."
<P>
And then, as a further afterthought: "All the more reason for
getting to work at it. . . ."
<P>
In his moods of inspiration Prothero would discourse through the
tobacco smoke until that great world-state seemed imminent--and Part
Two in the Tripos a thing relatively remote.  He would talk until
the dimly-lit room about him became impalpable, and the young men
squatting about it in elaborately careless attitudes caught glimpses
of cities that are still to be, bridges in wild places, deserts
tamed and oceans conquered, mankind no longer wasted by bickerings,
going forward to the conquest of the stars. . . .
<P>
An aristocratic world-state; this political dream had already taken
hold of Benham's imagination when he came to town.  But it was a
dream, something that had never existed, something that indeed may
never materialize, and such dreams, though they are vivid enough in
a study at night, fade and vanish at the rustle of a daily newspaper
or the sound of a passing band.  To come back again. . . .  So it
was with Benham.  Sometimes he was set clearly towards this world-
state that Prothero had talked into possibility.  Sometimes he was
simply abreast of the patriotic and socially constructive British
Imperialism of Breeze and Westerton.  And there were moods when the
two things were confused in his mind, and the glamour of world
dominion rested wonderfully on the slack and straggling British
Empire of Edward the Seventh--and Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Mr.
Chamberlain.  He did go on for a time honestly entertaining both
these projects in his mind, each at its different level, the greater
impalpable one and the lesser concrete one within it.  In some
unimaginable way he could suppose that the one by some miracle of
ennoblement--and neglecting the Frenchman, the Russian, the German,
the American, the Indian, the Chinaman, and, indeed, the greater
part of mankind from the problem--might become the other. . . .
<P>
All of which is recorded here, without excess of comment, as it
happened, and as, in a mood of astonished reminiscences, he came
finally to perceive it, and set it down for White's meditative
perusal.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
But to the enthusiasm of the young, dreams have something of the
substance of reality and realities, something of the magic of
dreams.  The London to which Benham came from Cambridge and the
disquisitions of Prothero was not the London of a mature and
disillusioned vision.  It was London seen magnified and distorted
through the young man's crystalline intentions.  It had for him a
quality of multitudinous, unquenchable activity.  Himself filled
with an immense appetite for life, he was unable to conceive of
London as fatigued.  He could not suspect these statesmen he now
began to meet and watch, of jaded wills and petty spites, he
imagined that all the important and influential persons in this
large world of affairs were as frank in their private lives and as
unembarrassed in their financial relationships as his untainted
self.  And he had still to reckon with stupidity.  He believed in
the statecraft of leader-writers and the sincerity of political
programmes.  And so regarded, what an avenue to Empire was
Whitehall!  How momentous was the sunrise in St. James's Park, and
how significant the clustering knot of listeners and speakers
beneath the tall column that lifts our Nelson to the windy sky!
<P>
For a time Benham was in love with the idea of London.  He got maps
of London and books about London.  He made plans to explore its
various regions.  He tried to grasp it all, from the conscious
picturesqueness of its garden suburbs to the factories of Croydon,
from the clerk-villadoms of Ealing to the inky streams of Bow.  In
those days there were passenger steamboats that would take one from
the meadows of Hampton Court past the whole spectacle of London out
to the shipping at Greenwich and the towed liners, the incessant
tugs, the heaving portals of the sea. . . .  His time was far too
occupied for him to carry out a tithe of these expeditions he had
planned, but he had many walks that bristled with impressions.
Northward and southward, eastward and westward a dreaming young man
could wander into a wilderness of population, polite or sombre,
poor, rich, or middle-class, but all ceaselessly active, all
urgently pressing, as it seemed, to their part in the drama of the
coming years.  He loved the late afternoon, when every artery is
injected and gorged with the multitudinous home-going of the daily
workers, he loved the time of lighting up, and the clustering
excitements of the late hours.  And he went out southward and
eastward into gaunt regions of reeking toil.  As yet he knew nothing
of the realities of industrialism.  He saw only the beauty of the
great chimneys that rose against the sullen smoke-barred sunsets,
and he felt only the romance of the lurid shuddering flares that
burst out from squat stacks of brickwork and lit the emptiness of
strange and slovenly streets. . . .
<P>
And this London was only the foreground of the great scene upon
which he, as a prosperous, well-befriended young Englishman, was
free to play whatever part he could.  This narrow turbid tidal river
by which he walked ran out under the bridges eastward beneath the
grey-blue clouds towards Germany, towards Russia, and towards Asia,
which still seemed in those days so largely the Englishman's Asia.
And when you turned about at Blackfriars Bridge this sense of the
round world was so upon you that you faced not merely Westminster,
but the icy Atlantic and America, which one could yet fancy was a
land of Englishmen--Englishmen a little estranged.  At any rate they
assimilated, they kept the tongue.  The shipping in the lower
reaches below the Tower there carried the flags of every country
under the sky. . . .  As he went along the riverside he met a group
of dusky students, Chinese or Japanese.  Cambridge had abounded in
Indians; and beneath that tall clock tower at Westminster it seemed
as though the world might centre.  The background of the
Englishman's world reached indeed to either pole, it went about the
earth, his background it was--for all that he was capable of doing.
All this had awaited him. . . .
<P>
Is it any wonder if a young man with an excitable imagination came
at times to the pitch of audible threats?  If the extreme indulgence
of his opportunity and his sense of ability and vigour lifted his
vanity at moments to the kingly pitch?  If he ejaculated and made a
gesture or so as he went along the Embankment?
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
In the disquisition upon choice that opened Benham's paper on
ARISTOCRACY, he showed himself momentarily wiser than his day-
dreams.  For in these day-dreams he did seem to himself to be
choosing among unlimited possibilities.  Yet while he dreamt other
influences were directing his movements.  There were for instance
his mother, Lady Marayne, who saw a very different London from what
he did, and his mother Dame Nature, who cannot see London at all.
She was busy in his blood as she is busy in the blood of most
healthy young men; common experience must fill the gaps for us; and
patiently and thoroughly she was preparing for the entrance of that
heroine, whom not the most self-centred of heroes can altogether
avoid. . . .
<P>
And then there was the power of every day.  Benham imagined himself
at large on his liberating steed of property while indeed he was
mounted on the made horse of Civilization; while he was speculating
whither he should go, he was already starting out upon the round.
One hesitates upon the magnificent plan and devotion of one's
lifetime and meanwhile there is usage, there are engagements.  Every
morning came Merkle, the embodiment of the established routine, the
herald of all that the world expected and required Benham to be and
do.  Usually he awakened Benham with the opening of his door and the
soft tinkle of the curtain rings as he let in the morning light.  He
moved softly about the room, gathering up and removing the crumpled
hulls of yesterday; that done he reappeared at the bedside with a
cup of admirable tea and one thin slice of bread-and-butter,
reported on the day's weather, stood deferential for instructions.
"You will be going out for lunch, sir.  Very good, sir.  White slips
of course, sir.  You will go down into the country in the afternoon?
Will that be the serge suit, sir, or the brown?"
<P>
These matters settled, the new aristocrat could yawn and stretch
like any aristocrat under the old dispensation, and then as the
sound of running water from the bathroom ceased, stick his toes out
of bed.
<P>
The day was tremendously indicated.  World-states and aristocracies
of steel and fire, things that were as real as coal-scuttles in
Billy's rooms away there at Cambridge, were now remoter than Sirius.
<P>
He was expected to shave, expected to bath, expected to go in to the
bright warmth and white linen and silver and china of his breakfast-
table.  And there he found letters and invitations, loaded with
expectation.  And beyond the coffee-pot, neatly folded, lay the
TIMES, and the DAILY NEWS and the TELEGRAPH all with an air of
requiring his attention.  There had been more fighting in Thibet and
Mr. Ritchie had made a Free Trade speech at Croydon.  The Japanese
had torpedoed another Russian ironclad and a British cruiser was
ashore in the East Indies.  A man had been found murdered in an
empty house in Hoxton and the King had had a conversation with
General Booth.  Tadpole was in for North Winchelsea, beating Taper
by nine votes, and there had been a new cut in the Atlantic
passenger rates.  He was expected to be interested and excited by
these things.
<P>
Presently the telephone bell would ring and he would hear the clear
little voice of his mother full of imperative expectations.  He
would be round for lunch?  Yes, he would be round to lunch.  And the
afternoon, had he arranged to do anything with his afternoon?  No!--
put off Chexington until tomorrow.  There was this new pianist, it
was really an EXPERIENCE, and one might not get tickets again.  And
then tea at Panton's.  It was rather fun at Panton's. . . .  Oh!--
Weston Massinghay was coming to lunch.  He was a useful man to know.
So CLEVER. . . .  So long, my dear little Son, till I see you. . . .
<P>
So life puts out its Merkle threads, as the poacher puts his hair
noose about the pheasant's neck, and while we theorize takes hold of
us. . . .
<P>
It came presently home to Benham that he had been down from
Cambridge for ten months, and that he was still not a step forward
with the realization of the new aristocracy.  His political career
waited.  He had done a quantity of things, but their net effect was
incoherence.  He had not been merely passive, but his efforts to
break away into creative realities had added to rather than
diminished his accumulating sense of futility.
<P>
The natural development of his position under the influence of Lady
Marayne had enormously enlarged the circle of his acquaintances.  He
had taken part in all sorts of social occasions, and sat and
listened to a representative selection of political and literary and
social personages, he had been several times to the opera and to a
great number and variety of plays, he had been attentively
inconspicuous in several really good week-end parties.  He had spent
a golden October in North Italy with his mother, and escaped from
the glowing lassitude of Venice for some days of climbing in the
Eastern Alps.  In January, in an outbreak of enquiry, he had gone
with Lionel Maxim to St. Petersburg and had eaten zakuska,
brightened his eyes with vodka, talked with a number of charming
people of the war that was then imminent, listened to gipsy singers
until dawn, careered in sledges about the most silent and stately of
capitals, and returned with Lionel, discoursing upon autocracy and
assassination, Japan, the Russian destiny, and the government of
Peter the Great.  That excursion was the most after his heart of all
the dispersed employments of his first year.  Through the rest of
the winter he kept himself very fit, and still further qualified
that nervous dislike for the horse that he had acquired from
Prothero by hunting once a week in Essex.  He was incurably a bad
horseman; he rode without sympathy, he was unready and convulsive at
hedges and ditches, and he judged distances badly.  His white face
and rigid seat and a certain joylessness of bearing in the saddle
earned him the singular nickname, which never reached his ears, of
the "Galvanized Corpse."  He got through, however, at the cost of
four quite trifling spills and without damaging either of the horses
he rode.  And his physical self-respect increased.
<P>
On his writing-desk appeared a few sheets of manuscript that
increased only very slowly.  He was trying to express his Cambridge
view of aristocracy in terms of Finacue Street, West.
<P>
The artistic and intellectual movements of London had made their
various demands upon his time and energies.  Art came to him with a
noble assumption of his interest and an intention that presently
became unpleasantly obvious to sell him pictures that he did not
want to buy and explain away pictures that he did.  He bought one or
two modern achievements, and began to doubt if art and aristocracy
had any necessary connection.  At first he had accepted the
assumption that they had.  After all, he reflected, one lives rather
for life and things than for pictures of life and things or pictures
arising out of life and things.  This Art had an air of saying
something, but when one came to grips with it what had it to say?
Unless it was Yah!  The drama, and more particularly the
intellectual drama, challenged his attention.  In the hands of Shaw,
Barker, Masefield, Galsworthy, and Hankin, it, too, had an air of
saying something, but he found it extremely difficult to join on to
his own demands upon life anything whatever that the intellectual
drama had the air of having said.  He would sit forward in the front
row of the dress-circle with his cheek on his hand and his brow
slightly knit.  His intentness amused observant people.  The drama
that did not profess to be intellectual he went to with Lady
Marayne, and usually on first nights.  Lady Marayne loved a big
first night at St. James's Theatre or His Majesty's.  Afterwards,
perhaps, Sir Godfrey would join them at a supper party, and all
sorts of clever and amusing people would be there saying keen
intimate things about each other.  He met Yeats, who told amusing
stories about George Moore, and afterwards he met George Moore, who
told amusing stories about Yeats, and it was all, he felt, great fun
for the people who were in it.  But he was not in it, and he had no
very keen desire to be in it.  It wasn't his stuff.  He had, though
they were nowadays rather at the back of his mind, quite other
intentions.  In the meanwhile all these things took up his time and
distracted his attention.
<P>
There was, as yet, no practicable aviation to beguile a young man of
spirit, but there were times when Benham found himself wondering
whether there might not be something rather creditable in the
possession and control of a motor-car of exceptional power.  Only
one might smash people up.  Should an aristocrat be deterred by the
fear of smashing people up?  If it is a selfish fear of smashing
people up, if it is nerves rather than pity?  At any rate it did not
come to the car.
<P>
<P>
<P>
6
<P>
<P>
Among other things that delayed Benham very greatly in the
development of his aristocratic experiments was the advice that was
coming to him from every quarter.  It came in extraordinary variety
and volume, but always it had one unvarying feature.  It ignored and
tacitly contradicted his private intentions.
<P>
We are all of us disposed to be propagandists of our way of living,
and the spectacle of a wealthy young man quite at large is enough to
excite the most temperate of us without distinction of age or sex.
"If I were you," came to be a familiar phrase in his ear.  This was
particularly the case with political people; and they did it not
only from the natural infirmity of humanity, but because, when they
seemed reluctant or satisfied with him as he was, Lady Marayne egged
them on.
<P>
There was a general assumption that he was to go into Parliament,
and most of his counsellors assumed further that on the whole his
natural sympathies would take him into the Conservative party.  But
it was pointed out to him that just at present the Liberal party was
the party of a young man's opportunity; sooner or later the swing of
the pendulum which would weed the Conservatives and proliferate
Liberals was bound to come, there was always more demand and
opportunity for candidates on the Liberal side, the Tariff Reformers
were straining their ministerial majority to the splitting point,
and most of the old Liberal leaders had died off during the years of
exile.  The party was no longer dominated; it would tolerate ideas.
A young man who took a distinctive line--provided it was not from
the party point of view a vexatious or impossible line--might go
very rapidly far and high.  On the other hand, it was urged upon him
that the Tariff Reform adventure called also for youth and energy.
But there, perhaps, there was less scope for the distinctive line--
and already they had Garvin.  Quite a number of Benham's friends
pointed out to him the value of working out some special aspect of
our national political interests.  A very useful speciality was the
Balkans.  Mr. Pope, the well-known publicist, whose very sound and
considerable reputation was based on the East Purblow Labour
Experiment, met Benham at lunch and proposed to go with him in a
spirit of instructive association to the Balkans, rub up their Greek
together, and settle the problem of Albania.  He wanted, he said, a
foreign speciality to balance his East Purblow interest.  But Lady
Beach Mandarin warned Benham against the Balkans; the Balkans were
getting to be too handy for Easter and summer holidays, and now that
there were several good hotels in Servia and Montenegro and Sofia,
they were being overdone.  Everybody went to the Balkans and came
back with a pet nationality.  She loathed pet nationalities.  She
believed most people loathed them nowadays.  It was stale: it was
GLADSTONIAN.  She was all for specialization in social reform.  She
thought Benham ought to join the Fabian Society and consult the
Webbs.  Quite a number of able young men had been placed with the
assistance of the Webbs.  They were, she said, "a perfect fount. . . ."
Two other people, independently of each other, pointed out to
Benham the helpfulness of a few articles in the half-crown
monthlies. . . .
<P>
"What are the assumptions underlying all this?" Benham asked himself
in a phase of lucidity.
<P>
And after reflection.  "Good God!  The assumptions!  What do they
think will satisfy me? . . ."
<P>
Everybody, however, did not point to Parliament.  Several people
seemed to think Travel, with a large T, was indicated.  One distant
cousin of Sir Godfrey's, the kind of man of the world who has long
moustaches, was for big game shooting.  "Get right out of all this
while you are young," he said.  "There's nothing to compare with
stopping a charging lion at twenty yards.  I've done it, my boy.
You can come back for all this pow-wow afterwards."  He gave the
diplomatic service as a second choice.  "There you are," he said,
"first-rate social position, nothing to do, theatres, operas, pretty
women, colour, life.  The best of good times.  Barring Washington,
that is.  But Washington, they say, isn't as bad as it used to be--
since Teddy has Europeanized �em. . . ."
<P>
Even the Reverend Harold Benham took a subdued but thoughtful share
in his son's admonition.  He came up to the flat--due precautions
were taken to prevent a painful encounter--he lunched at his son's
new club, and he was visibly oppressed by the contrast between the
young man's youthful fortunes and his own.  As visibly he bore up
bravely.  "There are few men, Poff, who would not envy you your
opportunities," he said.  "You have the Feast of Life spread out at
your feet. . . .  I hope you have had yourself put up for the
Athenaeum.  They say it takes years.  When I was a young man--and
ambitious--I thought that some day I might belong to the
Athenaeum. . . .  One has to learn. . . ."
<P>
<P>
<P>
7
<P>
<P>
And with an effect of detachment, just as though it didn't belong to
the rest of him at all, there was beginning a sort of backstairs and
underside to Benham's life.  There is no need to discuss how
inevitable that may or may not be in the case of a young man of
spirit and large means, nor to embark upon the discussion of the
temptations and opportunities of large cities.  Several ladies, of
various positions and qualities, had reflected upon his manifest
need of education.  There was in particular Mrs. Skelmersdale, a
very pretty little widow with hazel eyes, black hair, a mobile
mouth, and a pathetic history, who talked of old music to him and
took him to a Dolmetsch concert in Clifford's Inn, and expanded that
common interest to a general participation in his indefinite
outlook.  She advised him about his probable politics--everybody did
that--but when he broke through his usual reserve and suggested
views of his own, she was extraordinarily sympathetic.  She was so
sympathetic and in such a caressing way that she created a temporary
belief in her understanding, and it was quite imperceptibly that he
was drawn into the discussion of modern ethical problems.  She
herself was a rather stimulating instance of modern ethical
problems.  She told him something of her own story, and then their
common topics narrowed down very abruptly.  He found he could help
her in several ways.  There is, unhappily, a disposition on the part
of many people, who ought to know better, to regard a role played by
Joseph during his earlier days in Egypt as a ridiculous one.  This
point of view became very inopportunely dominant in Benham's mind
when he was lunching TETE A TETE with Mrs. Skelmersdale at her
flat. . . .
<P>
The ensuing intimacy was of an entirely concealed and respectable
nature, but a certain increased preoccupation in his manner set Lady
Marayne thinking.  He had as a matter of fact been taken by surprise.
<P>
Still he perceived that it is no excuse for a man that he has been
taken by surprise.  Surprises in one's own conduct ought not to
happen.  When they do happen then an aristocrat ought to stick to
what he had done.  He was now in a subtle and complicated
relationship to Mrs. Skelmersdale, a relationship in which her pride
had become suddenly a matter of tremendous importance.  Once he had
launched himself upon this affair, it was clear to him that he owed
it to her never to humiliate her.  And to go back upon himself now
would be a tremendous humiliation for her.  You see, he had helped
her a little financially.  And she looked to him, she wanted him. . . .
<P>
She wasn't, he knew, altogether respectable.  Indeed, poor dear, her
ethical problems, already a little worn, made her seem at times
anything but respectable.  He had met her first one evening at Jimmy
Gluckstein's when he was forming his opinion of Art.  Her manifest
want of interest in pictures had attracted him.  And that had led to
music.  And to the mention of a Clementi piano, that short, gentle,
sad, old, little sort of piano people will insist upon calling a
spinet, in her flat.
<P>
And so to this. . . .
<P>
It was very wonderful and delicious, this first indulgence of sense.
<P>
It was shabby and underhand.
<P>
The great god Pan is a glorious god.  (And so was Swinburne.)  And
what can compare with the warmth of blood and the sheen of sunlit
limbs?
<P>
But Priapus. . . .
<P>
She was the most subtle, delightful and tender of created beings.
<P>
She had amazing streaks of vulgarity.
<P>
And some astonishing friends.
<P>
Once she had seemed to lead the talk deliberately to money matters.
<P>
She loved him and desired him.  There was no doubt of it.
<P>
There was a curious effect about her as though when she went round
the corner she would become somebody else.  And a curious recurrent
feeling that round the corner there was somebody else.
<P>
He had an extraordinary feeling that his mother knew about this
business.  This feeling came from nothing in her words or acts, but
from some indefinable change in her eyes and bearing towards him.
But how could she know?
<P>
It was unlikely that she and Mrs. Skelmersdale would ever meet, and
it seemed to him that it would be a particularly offensive incident
for them to meet.
<P>
There were times now when life took on a grey and boring quality
such as it had never had before he met Mrs. Skelmersdale, and the
only remedy was to go to her.  She could restore his nervous
tranquillity, his feeling of solidity and reality, his pride in
himself.  For a time, that is.
<P>
Nevertheless his mind was as a whole pervaded by the feeling that he
ought not to have been taken by surprise.
<P>
And he had the clearest conviction in his mind that if now he could
be put back again to the day before that lunch. . . .
<P>
No! he should not have gone there to lunch.
<P>
He had gone there to see her Clementi piano.
<P>
Had he or had he not thought beforehand of any other possibility?
<P>
On a point so vital his memory was curiously unsure.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
The worry and disorganization of Benham's life and thoughts
increased as the spring advanced.  His need in some way to pull
things together became overpowering.  He began to think of Billy
Prothero, more and more did it seem desirable to have a big talk
with Billy and place everything that had got disturbed.  Benham
thought of going to Cambridge for a week of exhaustive evenings.
Small engagements delayed that expedition. . . .
<P>
Then came a day in April when all the world seemed wrong to Benham.
He was irritable; his will was unstable; whatever presented itself
to be done presented itself as undesirable; he could settle to
nothing.  He had been keeping away from Mrs. Skelmersdale and in the
morning there came a little note from her designed to correct this
abstention.  She understood the art of the attractive note.  But he
would not decide to go to her.  He left the note unanswered.
<P>
Then came his mother at the telephone and it became instantly
certain to Benham that he could not play the dutiful son that
evening.  He answered her that he could not come to dinner.  He had
engaged himself.  "Where?"
<P>
"With some men."
<P>
There was a pause and then his mother's voice came, flattened by
disappointment.  "Very well then, little Poff.  Perhaps I shall see
you to-morrow."
<P>
He replaced the receiver and fretted back into his study, where the
notes on aristocracy lay upon his desk, the notes he had been
pretending to work over all the morning.
<P>
"Damned liar!" he said, and then, "Dirty liar!"  He decided to lunch
at the club, and in the afternoon he was moved to telephone an
appointment with his siren.  And having done that he was bound to
keep it.
<P>
About one o'clock in the morning he found himself walking back to
Finacue Street.  He was no longer a fretful conflict of nerves, but
if anything he was less happy than he had been before.  It seemed to
him that London was a desolate and inglorious growth.
<P>
London ten years ago was much less nocturnal than it is now.  And
not so brightly lit.  Down the long streets came no traffic but an
occasional hansom.  Here and there a cat halted or bolted in the
road.  Near Piccadilly a policeman hovered artfully in a doorway,
and then came a few belated prostitutes waylaying the passers-by,
and a few youths and men, wearily lust driven.
<P>
As he turned up New Bond Street he saw a figure that struck him as
familiar.  Surely!--it was Billy Prothero!  Or at any rate it was
astonishingly like Billy Prothero.  He glanced again and the
likeness was more doubtful.  The man had his back to Benham, he was
halting and looking back at a woman.
<P>
By some queer flash of intuition it came to Benham that even if this
was not Prothero, still Prothero did these things.  It might very
well be Prothero even, though, as he now saw, it wasn't.  Everybody
did these things. . . .
<P>
It came into Benham's head for the first time that life could be
tiresome.
<P>
This Bond Street was a tiresome place; with its shops all shut and
muffled, its shops where in the crowded daytime one bought costly
furniture, costly clothes, costly scent, sweets, bibelots, pictures,
jewellery, presents of all sorts, clothes for Mrs. Skelmersdale,
sweets for Mrs. Skelmersdale, presents for Mrs. Skelmersdale, all
the elaborate fittings and equipage of--THAT!
<P>
"Good night, dear," a woman drifted by him.
<P>
"I've SAID good night," he cried, "I've SAID good night," and so
went on to his flat.  The unquenchable demand, the wearisome
insatiability of sex!  When everything else has gone, then it shows
itself bare in the bleak small hours.  And at first it had seemed so
light a matter!  He went to bed, feeling dog-tired, he went to bed
at an hour and with a finished completeness that Merkle would have
regarded as entirely becoming in a young gentleman of his position.
<P>
And a little past three o'clock in the morning he awoke to a mood of
indescribable desolation.  He awoke with a start to an agony of
remorse and self-reproach.
<P>
<P>
<P>
9
<P>
<P>
For a time he lay quite still staring at the darkness, then he
groaned and turned over.  Then, suddenly, like one who fancies he
hears a strange noise, he sat up in bed and listened."Oh, God!" he
said at last.
<P>
And then: "Oh!  The DIRTINESS of life!  The dirty muddle of life!
<P>
"What are we doing with life?  What are we all doing with life?
<P>
"It isn't only this poor Milly business.  This only brings it to a
head.  Of course she wants money. . . ."
<P>
His thoughts came on again.
<P>
"But the ugliness!
<P>
"Why did I begin it?"
<P>
He put his hands upon his knees and pressed his eyes against the
backs of his hands and so remained very still, a blankness beneath
his own question.
<P>
After a long interval his mind moved again.
<P>
And now it was as if he looked upon his whole existence, he seemed
to see in a large, clear, cold comprehensiveness, all the wasted
days, the fruitless activities, the futilities, the perpetual
postponements that had followed his coming to London.  He saw it all
as a joyless indulgence, as a confusion of playthings and
undisciplined desires, as a succession of days that began amiably
and weakly, that became steadily more crowded with ignoble and
trivial occupations, that had sunken now to indignity and
uncleanness.  He was overwhelmed by that persuasion, which only
freshly soiled youth can feel in its extreme intensity, that life
was slipping away from him, that the sands were running out, that in
a little while his existence would be irretrievably lost.
<P>
By some trick of the imagination he saw life as an interminable Bond
Street, lit up by night lamps, desolate, full of rubbish, full of
the very best rubbish, trappings, temptations, and down it all he
drove, as the damned drive, wearily, inexplicably.
<P>
WHAT ARE WE UP TO WITH LIFE!  WHAT ARE WE MAKING OF LIFE!
<P>
But hadn't he intended to make something tremendous of life?  Hadn't
he come to London trailing a glory? . . .
<P>
He began to remember it as a project.  It was the project of a great
World-State sustained by an aristocracy of noble men.  He was to
have been one of those men, too fine and far-reaching for the dull
manoeuvers of such politics as rule the world to-day.  The project
seemed still large, still whitely noble, but now it was unlit and
dead, and in the foreground he sat in the flat of Mrs. Skelmersdale,
feeling dissipated and fumbling with his white tie.  And she was
looking tired.  "God!" he said.  "How did I get there?"
<P>
And then suddenly he reached out his arms in the darkness and prayed
aloud to the silences.
<P>
"Oh, God!  Give me back my visions!  Give me back my visions!"
<P>
He could have imagined he heard a voice calling upon him to come out
into life, to escape from the body of this death.  But it was his
own voice that called to him. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
10
<P>
<P>
The need for action became so urgent in him, that he got right out
of his bed and sat on the edge of it.  Something had to be done at
once.  He did not know what it was but he felt that there could be
no more sleep, no more rest, no dressing nor eating nor going forth
before he came to decisions.  Christian before his pilgrimage began
was not more certain of this need of flight from the life of routine
and vanities.
<P>
What was to be done?
<P>
In the first place he must get away and think about it all, think
himself clear of all these--these immediacies, these associations
and relations and holds and habits.  He must get back to his vision,
get back to the God in his vision.  And to do that he must go alone.
<P>
He was clear he must go alone.  It was useless to go to Prothero,
one weak man going to a weaker.  Prothero he was convinced could
help him not at all, and the strange thing is that this conviction
had come to him and had established itself incontestably because of
that figure at the street corner, which had for just one moment
resembled Prothero.  By some fantastic intuition Benham knew that
Prothero would not only participate but excuse.  And he knew that he
himself could endure no excuses.  He must cut clear of any
possibility of qualification.  This thing had to be stopped.  He
must get away, he must get free, he must get clean.  In the
extravagance of his reaction Benham felt that he could endure
nothing but solitary places and to sleep under the open sky.
<P>
He wanted to get right away from London and everybody and lie in the
quiet darkness and stare up at the stars.
<P>
His plans grew so definite that presently he was in his dressing-
gown and turning out the maps in the lower drawer of his study
bureau.  He would go down into Surrey with a knapsack, wander along
the North Downs until the Guildford gap was reached, strike across
the Weald country to the South Downs and then beat eastward.  The
very thought of it brought a coolness to his mind.  He knew that
over those southern hills one could be as lonely as in the
wilderness and as free to talk to God.  And there he would settle
something.  He would make a plan for his life and end this torment.
<P>
When Merkle came in to him in the morning he was fast asleep.
<P>
The familiar curtain rings awakened Benham.  He turned his head
over, stared for a moment and then remembered.
<P>
"Merkle," he said, "I am going for a walking tour.  I am going off
this morning.  Haven't I a rucksack?"
<P>
"You �ave a sort of canvas bag, sir, with pockets to it," said
Merkle.  "Will you be needing the VERY �eavy boots with �obnails--
Swiss, I fancy, sir--or your ordinary shooting boots?"
<P>
"And when may I expect you back, sir?" asked Merkle as the moment
for departure drew near.
<P>
"God knows," said Benham, "I don't."
<P>
"Then will there be any address for forwarding letters, sir?"
<P>
Benham hadn't thought of that.  For a moment he regarded Merkle's
scrupulous respect with a transient perplexity.
<P>
 "I'll let you know, Merkle," he said.  "I'll let you know."
<P>
For some days at least, notes, telephone messages, engagements, all
this fuss and clamour about nothing, should clamour for him in
vain. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
11
<P>
<P>
"But how closely," cried White, in a mood of cultivated enthusiasm;
"how closely must all the poor little stories that we tell to-day
follow in the footsteps of the Great Exemplars!  A little while ago
and the springtime freshness of Tobias irradiated the page.  Now
see! it is Christian--."
<P>
Indeed it looked extremely like Christian as Benham went up across
the springy turf from Epsom Downs station towards the crest of the
hill.  Was he not also fleeing in the morning sunlight from the City
of Destruction?  Was he not also seeking that better city whose name
is Peace?  And there was a bundle on his back.  It was the bundle, I
think, that seized most firmly upon the too literary imagination of
White.
<P>
But the analogy of the bundle was a superficial one.  Benham had not
the slightest desire to lose it from his shoulders.  It would have
inconvenienced him very greatly if he had done so.  It did not
contain his sins.  Our sins nowadays are not so easily separated.
It contained a light, warm cape-coat he had bought in Switzerland
and which he intended to wrap about him when he slept under the
stars, and in addition Merkle had packed it with his silk pyjamas,
an extra pair of stockings, tooth-brush, brush and comb, a safety
razor. . . .  And there were several sheets of the Ordnance map.
<P>
<P>
<P>
12
<P>
<P>
The urgency of getting away from something dominated Benham to the
exclusion of any thought of what he might be getting to.  That
muddle of his London life had to be left behind.  First, escape. . .
.
<P>
Over the downs great numbers of larks were singing.  It was warm
April that year and early.  All the cloud stuff in the sky was
gathered into great towering slow-sailing masses, and the rest was
blue of the intensest.  The air was so clean that Benham felt it
clean in the substance of his body.  The chestnuts down the hill to
the right were flowering, the beeches were luminously green, and the
oaks in the valley foaming gold.  And sometimes it was one lark
filled his ears, and sometimes he seemed to be hearing all the larks
for miles about him.  Presently over the crest he would be out of
sight of the grand stand and the men exercising horses, and that
brace of red-jacketed golfers. . . .
<P>
What was he to do?
<P>
For a time he could think of nothing to do except to keep up and out
of the valley.  His whole being seemed to have come to his surfaces
to look out at the budding of the year and hear the noise of the
birds.  And then he got into a long road from which he had to
escape, and trespassing southward through plantations he reached the
steep edge of the hills and sat down over above a great chalk pit
somewhere near Dorking and surveyed all the tumbled wooded spaces of
the Weald. . . .  It is after all not so great a country this
Sussex, nor so hilly, from deepest valley to highest crest is not
six hundred feet, yet what a greatness of effect it can achieve!
There is something in those downland views which, like sea views,
lifts a mind out to the skies.  All England it seemed was there to
Benham's vision, and the purpose of the English, and his own purpose
in the world.  For a long time he surveyed the large delicacy of the
detail before him, the crests, the tree-protected houses, the fields
and farmsteads, the distant gleams of water.  And then he became
interested in the men who were working in the chalk pit down below.
<P>
They at any rate were not troubled with the problem of what to do
with their lives.
<P>
<P>
<P>
13
<P>
<P>
Benham found his mind was now running clear, and so abundantly that
he could scarcely, he felt, keep pace with it.  As he thought his
flow of ideas was tinged with a fear that he might forget what he
was thinking.  In an instant, for the first time in his mental
existence, he could have imagined he had discovered Labour and seen
it plain.  A little while ago and he had seemed a lonely man among
the hills, but indeed he was not lonely, these men had been with him
all the time, and he was free to wander, to sit here, to think and
choose simply because those men down there were not free.  HE WAS
SPENDING THEIR LEISURE. . . .  Not once but many times with Prothero
had he used the phrase RICHESSE OBLIGE.  Now he remembered it.  He
began to remember a mass of ideas that had been overlaid and
stifling within him.  This was what Merkle and the club servants and
the entertainments and engagements and his mother and the artistic
touts and the theatrical touts and the hunting and the elaboration
of games and--Mrs. Skelmersdale and all that had clustered thickly
round him in London had been hiding from him.  Those men below there
had not been trusted to choose their work; they had been given it.
And he had been trusted. . . .
<P>
And now to grapple with it!  Now to get it clear!  What work was he
going to do?  That settled, he would deal with his distractions
readily enough.  Until that was settled he was lax and exposed to
every passing breeze of invitation.
<P>
"What work am I going to do?  What work am I going to do?"  He
repeated it.
<P>
It is the only question for the aristocrat.  What amusement?  That
for a footman on holiday.  That for a silly child, for any creature
that is kept or led or driven.  That perhaps for a tired invalid,
for a toiler worked to a rag.  But able-bodied amusement!  The arms
of Mrs. Skelmersdale were no worse than the solemn aimlessness of
hunting, and an evening of dalliance not an atom more reprehensible
than an evening of chatter.  It was the waste of him that made the
sin.  His life in London had been of a piece together.  It was well
that his intrigue had set a light on it, put a point to it, given
him this saving crisis of the nerves.  That, indeed, is the chief
superiority of idle love-making over other more prevalent forms of
idleness and self-indulgence; it does at least bear its proper
label.  It is reprehensible.  It brings your careless honour to the
challenge of concealment and shabby evasions and lies. . . .
<P>
But in this pellucid air things took their proper proportions again.
<P>
And now what was he to do?
<P>
"Politics," he said aloud to the turf and the sky.
<P>
Is there any other work for an aristocratic man? . . .  Science?
One could admit science in that larger sense that sweeps in History,
or Philosophy.  Beyond that whatever work there is is work for which
men are paid.  Art?  Art is nothing aristocratic except when it is a
means of scientific or philosophical expression.  Art that does not
argue nor demonstrate nor discover is merely the craftsman's
impudence.
<P>
He pulled up at this and reflected for a time with some
distinguished instances in his mind.  They were so distinguished, so
dignified, they took their various arts with so admirable a gravity
that the soul of this young man recoiled from the verdicts to which
his reasoning drove him.  "It's not for me to judge them," he
decided, "except in relation to myself.  For them there may be
tremendous significances in Art.  But if these do not appear to me,
then so far as I am concerned they do not exist for me.  They are
not in my world.  So far as they attempt to invade me and control my
attitudes or my outlook, or to judge me in any way, there is no
question of their impudence.  Impudence is the word for it.  My
world is real.  I want to be really aristocratic, really brave,
really paying for the privilege of not being a driven worker.  The
things the artist makes are like the things my private dream-artist
makes, relaxing, distracting.  What can Art at its greatest be, pure
Art that is, but a more splendid, more permanent, transmissible
reverie!  The very essence of what I am after is NOT to be an
artist. . . ."
<P>
After a large and serious movement through his mind he came back to
Science, Philosophy or Politics as the sole three justifications for
the usurpation of leisure.
<P>
So far as devotion to science went, he knew he had no specific
aptitude for any departmentalized subject, and equally he felt no
natural call to philosophy.  He was left with politics. . . .
<P>
"Or else, why shouldn't I go down there and pick up a shovel and set
to work?  To make leisure for my betters. . . ."
<P>
And now it was that he could take up the real trouble that more than
anything else had been keeping him ineffective and the prey of every
chance demand and temptation during the last ten months.  He had not
been able to get himself into politics, and the reason why he had
not been able to do so was that he could not induce himself to fit
in.  Statecraft was a remote and faded thing in the political life
of the time; politics was a choice of two sides in a game, and
either side he found equally unattractive.  Since he had come down
from Cambridge the Tariff Reform people had gone far to capture the
Conservative party.  There was little chance of a candidature for
him without an adhesion to that.  And he could find nothing he could
imagine himself working for in the declarations of the Tariff Reform
people.  He distrusted them, he disliked them.  They took all the
light and pride out of imperialism, they reduced it to a shabby
conspiracy of the British and their colonies against foreign
industrialism.  They were violent for armaments and hostile to
education.  They could give him no assurance of any scheme of growth
and unification, and no guarantees against the manifest dangers of
economic disturbance and political corruption a tariff involves.
Imperialism without noble imaginations, it seemed to him, was simply
nationalism with megalomania.  It was swaggering, it was greed, it
was German; its enthusiasm was forced, its nobility a vulgar lie.
No.  And when he turned to the opposite party he found little that
was more attractive.  They were prepared, it seemed, if they came
into office, to pull the legislature of the British Isles to pieces
in obedience to the Irish demand for Home Rule, and they were
totally unprepared with any scheme for doing this that had even a
chance of success.  In the twenty years that had elapsed since
Gladstone's hasty and disastrous essay in political surgery they had
studied nothing, learnt nothing, produced no ideas whatever in the
matter.  They had not had the time.  They had just negotiated, like
the mere politicians they were, for the Nationalist vote.  They
seemed to hope that by a marvel God would pacify Ulster.  Lord
Dunraven, Plunkett, were voices crying in the wilderness.  The sides
in the party game would as soon have heeded a poet. . . .  But
unless Benham was prepared to subscribe either to Home Rule or
Tariff Reform there was no way whatever open to him into public
life.  He had had some decisive conversations.  He had no illusions
left upon that score. . . .
<P>
Here was the real barrier that had kept him inactive for ten months.
Here was the problem he had to solve.  This was how he had been left
out of active things, a prey to distractions, excitements, idle
temptations--and Mrs. Skelmersdale.
<P>
Running away to shoot big game or explore wildernesses was no
remedy.  That was just running away.  Aristocrats do not run away.
What of his debt to those men down there in the quarry?  What of his
debt to the unseen men in the mines away in the north?  What of his
debt to the stokers on the liners, and to the clerks in the city?
He reiterated the cardinal article of his creed: The aristocrat is a
privileged man in order that he may be a public and political man.
<P>
But how is one to be a political man when one is not in politics?
<P>
Benham frowned at the Weald.  His ideas were running thin.
<P>
He might hammer at politics from the outside.  And then again how?
He would make a list of all the things that he might do.  For
example he might write.  He rested one hand on his knee and lifted
one finger and regarded it.  COULD he write?  There were one or two
men who ran papers and seemed to have a sort of independent
influence.  Strachey, for example, with his SPECTATOR; Maxse, with
his NATIONAL REVIEW.  But they were grown up, they had formed their
ideas.  He had to learn first.
<P>
He lifted a second finger.  How to learn?  For it was learning that
he had to do.
<P>
When one comes down from Oxford or Cambridge one falls into the
mistake of thinking that learning is over and action must begin.
But until one perceives clearly just where one stands action is
impossible.
<P>
How is one with no experience of affairs to get an experience of
affairs when the door of affairs is closed to one by one's own
convictions?  Outside of affairs how can one escape being flimsy?
How can one escape becoming merely an intellectual like those wordy
Fabians, those writers, poseurs, and sham publicists whose wrangles
he had attended?  And, moreover, there is danger in the leisure of
your intellectual.  One cannot be always reading and thinking and
discussing and inquiring. . . .  WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER AFTER ALL TO
MAKE A CONCESSION, SWALLOW HOME RULE OR TARIFF REFORM, AND SO AT
LEAST GET HIS HANDS ON THINGS?
<P>
And then in a little while the party conflict would swallow him up?
<P>
Still it would engage him, it would hold him.  If, perhaps, he did
not let it swallow him up.  If he worked with an eye open for
opportunities of self-assertion. . . .
<P>
The party game had not altogether swallowed "Mr. Arthur." . . .
<P>
But every one is not a Balfour. . . .
<P>
He reflected profoundly.  On his left knee his left hand rested with
two fingers held up.  By some rapid mental alchemy these fingers had
now become Home Rule and Tariff Reform.  His right hand which had
hitherto taken no part in the controversy, had raised its index
finger by imperceptible degrees.  It had been raised almost
subconsciously.  And by still obscurer processes this finger had
become Mrs. Skelmersdale.  He recognized her sudden reappearance
above the threshold of consciousness with mild surprise.  He had
almost forgotten her share in these problems.  He had supposed her
dismissed to an entirely subordinate position. . . .
<P>
Then he perceived that the workmen in the chalk pit far below had
knocked off and were engaged upon their midday meal.  He understood
why his mind was no longer moving forward with any alacrity.
<P>
Food?
<P>
The question where he should eat arose abruptly and dismissed all
other problems from his mind.  He unfolded a map.Here must be the
chalk pit, here was Dorking.  That village was Brockham Green.
Should he go down to Dorking or this way over Box Hill to the little
inn at Burford Bridge.  He would try the latter.
<P>

The April sunset found our young man talking to himself for greater
emphasis, and wandering along a turfy cart-track through a
wilderness mysteriously planted with great bushes of rhododendra on
the Downs above Shere.  He had eaten a belated lunch at Burford
Bridge, he had got some tea at a little inn near a church with a
splendid yew tree, and for the rest of the time he had wandered and
thought.  He had travelled perhaps a dozen or fifteen miles, and a
good way from his first meditations above the Dorking chalk pit.
<P>
He had recovered long ago from that remarkable conception of an
active if dishonest political career as a means of escaping Mrs.
Skelmersdale and all that Mrs. Skelmersdale symbolized.  That would
be just louting from one bad thing to another.  He had to settle
Mrs. Skelmersdale clean and right, and he had to do as exquisitely
right in politics as he could devise.  If the public life of the
country had got itself into a stupid antagonism of two undesirable
things, the only course for a sane man of honour was to stand out
from the parties and try and get them back to sound issues again.
There must be endless people of a mind with himself in this matter.
And even if there were not, if he was the only man in the world, he
still had to follow his lights and do the right.  And his business
was to find out the right. . . .
<P>
He came back from these imaginative excursions into contemporary
politics with one idea confirmed in his mind, an idea that had been
indeed already in his mind during his Cambridge days.  This was the
idea of working out for himself, thoroughly and completely, a
political scheme, a theory of his work and duty in the world, a plan
of the world's future that should give a rule for his life.  The
Research Magnificent was emerging.  It was an alarmingly vast
proposal, but he could see no alternative but submission, a
plebeian's submission to the currents of life about him.
<P>
Little pictures began to flit before his imagination of the way in
which he might build up this tremendous inquiry.  He would begin by
hunting up people, everybody who seemed to have ideas and promise
ideas he would get at.  He would travel far--and exhaustively.  He
would, so soon as the ideas seemed to indicate it, hunt out facts.
He would learn how the world was governed.  He would learn how it
did its thinking.  He would live sparingly.  ("Not TOO sparingly,''
something interpolated.)  He would work ten or twelve hours a day.
Such a course of investigation must pass almost of its own accord
into action and realization.  He need not trouble now how it would
bring him into politics.  Inevitably somewhere it would bring him
into politics.  And he would travel.  Almost at once he would
travel.  It is the manifest duty of every young aristocrat to
travel.  Here he was, ruling India.  At any rate, passively, through
the mere fact of being English, he was ruling India.  And he knew
nothing of India.  He knew nothing indeed of Asia.  So soon as he
returned to London his preparations for this travel must begin, he
must plot out the men to whom he would go, and so contrive that also
he would go round the world.  Perhaps he would get Lionel Maxim to
go with him.  Or if Maxim could not come, then possibly Prothero.
Some one surely could be found, some one thinking and talking of
statecraft and the larger idea of life.  All the world is not
swallowed up in every day. . . .
<P>
<P>

His mind shifted very suddenly from these large proposals to an
entirely different theme.  These mental landslips are not unusual
when men are thinking hard and wandering.  He found himself holding
a trial upon himself for Presumptuousness, for setting himself up
against the wisdom of the ages, and the decisions of all the
established men in the world, for being in short a Presumptuous Sort
of Ass.  He was judge and jury and prosecutor, but rather
inexplicably the defence was conducted in an irregular and
undignified way by some inferior stratum of his being.
<P>
At first the defence contented itself with arguments that did at
least aim to rebut the indictment.  The decisions of all the
established men in the world were notoriously in conflict.  However
great was the gross wisdom of the ages the net wisdom was remarkably
small.  Was it after all so very immodest to believe that the
Liberals were right in what they said about Tariff Reform, and the
Tories right in their criticism of Home Rule?
<P>
And then suddenly the defence threw aside its mask and insisted that
Benham had to take this presumptuous line because there was no other
tolerable line possible for him.
<P>
"Better die with the Excelsior chap up the mountains," the defence
interjected.
<P>
Than what?
<P>
Consider the quality Benham had already betrayed.  He was manifestly
incapable of a decent modest mediocre existence.  Already he had
ceased to be--if one may use so fine a word for genteel abstinence--
virtuous.  He didn't ride well, he hadn't good hands, and he hadn't
good hands for life.  He must go hard and harsh, high or low.  He
was a man who needed BITE in his life.  He was exceptionally capable
of boredom.  He had been bored by London.  Social occasions
irritated him, several times he had come near to gross incivilities,
art annoyed him, sport was an effort, wholesome perhaps, but
unattractive, music he loved, but it excited him.  The defendant
broke the sunset calm by uttering amazing and improper phrases.
<P>
"I can't smug about in a state of falsified righteousness like these
Crampton chaps.
<P>
"I shall roll in women.  I shall rollick in women.  If, that is, I
stay in London with nothing more to do than I have had this year
past.
<P>
"I've been sliding fast to it. . . .
<P>
"NO!  I'M DAMNED IF I DO! . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
For some time he had been bothered by a sense of something,
something else, awaiting his attention.  Now it came swimming up
into his consciousness.  He had forgotten.  He was, of course, going
to sleep out under the stars.
<P>
He had settled that overnight, that was why he had this cloak in his
rucksack, but he had settled none of the details.  Now he must find
some place where he could lie down.  Here, perhaps, in this strange
forgotten wilderness of rhododendra.
<P>
He turned off from the track and wandered among the bushes.  One
might lie down anywhere here.  But not yet; it was as yet barely
twilight.  He consulted his watch.  HALF-PAST SEVEN.
<P>
Nearly dinner-time. . . .
<P>
No doubt Christian during the earlier stages of his pilgrimage
noticed the recurrence of the old familiar hours of his life of
emptiness and vanity.  Or rather of vanity--simply.  Why drag in the
thought of emptiness just at this point? . . .
<P>
It was very early to go to bed.
<P>
He might perhaps sit and think for a time.  Here for example was a
mossy bank, a seat, and presently a bed.  So far there were only
three stars visible but more would come.  He dropped into a
reclining attitude.  DAMP!
<P>
When one thinks of sleeping out under the stars one is apt to forget
the dew.
<P>
He spread his Swiss cloak out on the soft thick carpeting of herbs
and moss, and arranged his knapsack as a pillow.  Here he would lie
and recapitulate the thoughts of the day.  (That squealing might be
a young fox.)  At the club at present men would be sitting about
holding themselves back from dinner.  Excellent the clear soup
always was at the club!  Then perhaps a Chateaubriand.  That--what
was that?  Soft and large and quite near and noiseless.  An owl!
<P>
The damp feeling was coming through his cloak.  And this April night
air had a knife edge.  Early ice coming down the Atlantic perhaps.
It was wonderful to be here on the top of the round world and feel
the icebergs away there.  Or did this wind come from Russia?  He
wasn't quite clear just how he was oriented, he had turned about so
much.  Which was east?  Anyhow it was an extremely cold wind.
<P>
What had he been thinking?  Suppose after all that ending with Mrs.
Skelmersdale was simply a beginning.  So far he had never looked sex
in the face. . . .
<P>
He sat up and sneezed violently.
<P>
It would be ridiculous to start out seeking the clue to one's life
and be driven home by rheumatic fever.  One should not therefore
incur the risk of rheumatic fever.
<P>
Something squealed in the bushes.
<P>
It was impossible to collect one's thoughts in this place.  He stood
up.  The night was going to be bitterly cold, savagely, cruelly
cold. . . .
<P>
No.  There was no thinking to be done here, no thinking at all.  He
would go on along the track and presently he would strike a road and
so come to an inn.  One can solve no problems when one is engaged in
a struggle with the elements.  The thing to do now was to find that
track again. . . .
<P>
It took Benham two hours of stumbling and walking, with a little
fence climbing and some barbed wire thrown in, before he got down
into Shere to the shelter of a friendly little inn.  And then he
negotiated a satisfying meal, with beef-steak as its central fact,
and stipulated for a fire in his bedroom.
<P>
The landlord was a pleasant-faced man; he attended to Benham himself
and displayed a fine sense of comfort.  He could produce wine, a
half-bottle of Australian hock, Big Tree brand No.  8, a virile
wine, he thought of sardines to precede the meal, he provided a
substantial Welsh rarebit by way of a savoury, he did not mind in
the least that it was nearly ten o'clock.  He ended by suggesting
coffee.  "And a liqueur?"
<P>
Benham had some Benedictine!
<P>
One could not slight such sympathetic helpfulness.  The Benedictine
was genuine.  And then came the coffee.
<P>
The cup of coffee was generously conceived and honestly made.
<P>
A night of clear melancholy ensued. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Hitherto Benham had not faced in any detail the problem of how to
break with Mrs. Skelmersdale.  Now he faced it pessimistically.  She
would, he knew, be difficult to break with.  (He ought never to have
gone there to lunch.)  There would be something ridiculous in
breaking off.  In all sorts of ways she might resist.  And face to
face with her he might find himself a man divided against himself.
That opened preposterous possibilities.  On the other hand it was
out of the question to do the business by letter.  A letter hits too
hard; it lies too heavy on the wound it has made.  And in money
matters he could be generous.  He must be generous.  At least
financial worries need not complicate her distresses of desertion.
But to suggest such generosities on paper, in cold ink, would be
outrageous.  And, in brief--he ought not to have gone there to
lunch.  After that he began composing letters at a great rate.
Delicate--explanatory.  Was it on the whole best to be
explanatory? . . .
<P>
It was going to be a tremendous job, this breaking with her.  And it
had begun so easily. . . .
<P>
There was, he remembered with amazing vividness, a little hollow he
had found under her ear, and how when he kissed her there it always
made her forget her worries and ethical problems for a time and turn
to him. . . .
<P>
"No," he said grimly, "it must end," and rolled over and stared at
the black. . . .
<P>
Like an insidious pedlar, that old rascal whom young literary
gentlemen call the Great God Pan, began to spread his wares in the
young man's memory. . . .
<P>
After long and feverish wanderings of the mind, and some talking to
himself and walking about the room, he did at last get a little away
from Mrs. Skelmersdale.
<P>
He perceived that when he came to tell his mother about this journey
around the world there would be great difficulties.  She would
object very strongly, and if that did not do then she would become
extremely abusive, compare him to his father, cry bitterly, and
banish him suddenly and heartbrokenly from her presence for ever.
She had done that twice already--once about going to the opera
instead of listening to a lecture on Indian ethnology and once about
a week-end in Kent. . . .  He hated hurting his mother, and he was
beginning to know now how easily she was hurt.  It is an abominable
thing to hurt one's mother--whether one has a justification or
whether one hasn't.
<P>
Recoiling from this, he was at once resumed by Mrs. Skelmersdale.
Who had in fact an effect of really never having been out of the
room.  But now he became penitent about her.  His penitence expanded
until it was on a nightmare scale.  At last it blotted out the
heavens.  He felt like one of those unfortunate victims of religious
mania who are convinced they have committed the Sin against the Holy
Ghost.  (Why had he gone there to lunch?  That was the key to it.
WHY had he gone there to lunch?) . . .  He began to have remorse for
everything, for everything he had ever done, for everything he he give in to
sex.
It's the same thing really.  The misleading of instinct."
<P>
This set the key of his thought throughout the afternoon--until
Amanda happened to him.
