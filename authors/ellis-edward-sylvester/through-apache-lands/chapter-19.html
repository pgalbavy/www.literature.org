<p>As he moved along, weary and worn, the memory of the horrid fight
he had seen by the camp fire, and especially the picture of those
three stark, bloody forms that lay stretched upon the earth, seemingly
watching every movement he made, followed and weighed him down
like some smothering incubus. Then he saw, more vividly than ever
before, the mountainous task ahead. With no horse, and the hundreds
of miles of mountain and prairie, with the dangers besetting him
on every hand, what possible hope had he for believing he was
ever to reach his destination? The gloom of the night, the shadow
of what he had so recently witnessed, and his own exhausted condition,
no doubt had much to do with the distress; for his prospects were
certainly as good as at morning, when he was so full of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I can't travel any further," he finally exclaimed, "and what's
the use? It won't do any good."</p>

<p>When he paused in his wearisome tramp, he happened to be close
to a tree, quite lofty, with numerous limbs, some of which were
quite near the ground. It struck him at once that it would be
a good plan to climb into this, and ensconce himself among the
branches. At any rate, he was certain to be out of the way of
the crawling snakes, and no wild animal could steal upon him while
he was unconscious.</p>

<p>Without pausing more than a moment to consider, he ascended the
tree, and, a short distance from the ground secured the very position
he wanted. Here the limbs crossed and recrossed, and gnarled themselves
in such a way, that the most pleasant kind of bed imaginable was
found, and he stretched out his weary limbs upon it, thanking
Heaven that had guided him to such a favorable place.</p>

<p>"I hope Lone Wolf won't be able to follow me here," was the wish
he expressed, as he resigned himself to slumber.</p>

<p>But gentle sleep had not yet closed his eyelids when he was alarmed
by hearing something beneath him. His first supposition was that
it was Lone Wolf, for the sound resembled the stealthy tread of
some person upon the soft earth; but after listening a few minutes
he became satisfied that it was some animal instead.</p>

<p>"It's a wolf or panther that has scented my trail," was his conclusion,
as he leaned over and peered cautiously down among the branches.</p>

<p>The moon shone more brightly than upon any night since he had
started, but the shadow of the trees themselves obscured his view
so much that his vision was of little use to him. It seemed to
him, however, when he looked downward in this fashion, that once
or twice he caught sight of a shadowy creature, whisking back
and forth, leaping about like a dog, and apparently ready to make
a bound upward among the branches.</p>

<p>But he could not make certain of what he saw, although there
could be no doubt but that he heard something, and that some kind
of a dangerous creature was close at hand.</p>

<p>"I guess he isn't going to hurt me," was his conclusion, after
watching and listening a half hour, and after finding a heavy
drowsiness was stealing over him. In this comfortable state of
mind, he soon closed his eyes, and relapsed into a deep, refreshing
sleep, which lasted an hour or more, when it ended in a peculiar
manner. Very few boys are apt to lie quiet in their beds, and
Ned Chadmund, in turning over upon his side, turned completely
out of bed, and dropped through the branches to the ground.</p>

<p>The fall was so slight that it did not hurt him, except in the
disagreeable shock that was inevitable. It flashed on him on the
instant, and, recalling those stealthy footsteps that had so frightened
him, he instantly sprang for the trunk, and began climbing with
all the haste at his command. He was almost within reach of the
limbs, when he heard a growl, and some denizen of the forest came
plunging toward him.</p>

<p>With a thrill of terror, the lad made a tremendous effort, caught
the limb with one hand, swung his leg over and drew himself up.
As he did so, he felt distinctly the wind made by the body of
the beast, as it leaped upward, and snapped with his huge jaws
at his legs, which were withdrawn from its fangs just as they
closed together. The creature, whatever it was, made a running
leap, that carried him some distance beyond, when he struck the
ground and ran a few leaps before turning about and retracing
his steps.</p>

<p>Without waiting to gain a more distinct view, the lad crept back
to his perch, where he tremblingly awaited the moment when it
was to bound up among the limbs and attack him. After gaining
his former position, he sat for a few minutes shivering like one
with the ague, forgetting even to think of the revolver with which
to defend himself in case the brute assaulted him. But it may
have been that the dumb creature believed that he was already
frightened to death, and there was no occasion for attempting
anything further. At any rate nothing more was seen or heard of
him.</p>

<p>Ned had been too thoroughly shaken up to gain any more sleep.
He sat through the remaining hours of the night without closing
his eyes a moment in slumber. They were the longest and the dreariest
that he ever spent, but when the welcome light of morning came
his foe had departed.</p>

<p>The wanderer waited a half hour or more, and carefully reconnoitered
the grounds before descending; but, assured that the coast was
clear, he came down to <em>terra firma</em> again and took up
his line of march. His fear now was that his presence in the neighborhood
might be discovered by Lone Wolf or some of his band, and, scarcely
pausing long enough to swallow a few mouthfuls of water from a
stream near at hand, he hastened forward, with his face toward
the west.</p>

<p>It became evident, after journeying a short distance, that he
was again following a distinctly-marked trail, one that was originally
made by animals, most probably buffaloes, in their migrations
from one section to another, and had been taken advantage of by
men whose business or inclinations called them in the same direction.
Here and there he saw marks that had been made by the hoofs of
horses, and more than once he was certain he observed the trail
of moccasins. The path was more direct and less laborious to travel,
and he began to believe that, if he were left alone, he might
succeed in reaching safety at some time or other.</p>

<p>For some two hours he tramped along through a section that gradually
lost its mountainous character as he neared the rolling prairie
beyond. He kept continually looking back and around him, on the
alert for Indians; but not a sign was discovered, until he approached
an exceptionally rocky place, where the trail wound round the
masses of stone at such a sharp angle that the view was less than
a dozen feet.</p>

<p>With no thought of danger, Ned walked around this corner, and
on the instant found himself face to face with a swarthy Indian
warrior who must have seen him approaching, and, dismounting from
his horse, stood back and awaited his approach. That astounded
look revealed not only this, but that the Indian was Lone Wolf.</p>

<p>Fate had brought the two together again, at the very time the
heart of the weary fugitive was beating high with hope. There
was no chance for retreat or hope of avoiding him. The eyes of
the painted Apache glowed with a demoniac light, and his fingers
twitched as he placed his right hand upon the buckhorn handle
of a knife at his girdle.</p>

<p>"You run away&mdash;you see well&mdash;you lie&mdash;now I will cut out your
eyes, and you will not see to run away again!"</p>

<p>There was no doubt that such was the purpose of the warrior,
as he advanced upon the lad, who suddenly thrust his hand into
his waistcoat for his revolver.</p>

<p>It was gone!</p>

<p>During the night it had dropped out without being noticed, and
he was absolutely defenseless. He was breathless, paralyzed with
terror.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will cut out your eyes, and then you will not see to
run away," added the chief, striding toward him.</p>

<p>"Hold on thar, my copper-colored friend! This 'ere is a little
row you kin settle with me, instead of that boy thar. Try that
knife on my eyes, and while you're doing it, I'll try mine on
yourn."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<em>THIS 'ERE IS A LITTLE ROW YOU KIN SETTLE
WITH ME, INSTEAD OF THAT BOY THAR</em>."]</p>

<p>It was Tom Hardynge, the scout, who spoke thus opportunely.</p>
