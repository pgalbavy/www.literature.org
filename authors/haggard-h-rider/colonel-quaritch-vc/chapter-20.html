<p>It was on the day following the one upon which Harold proposed to
Ida, that Edward Cossey returned to Boisingham. His father had so far
recovered from his attack as to be at last prevailed upon to allow his
departure, being chiefly moved thereto by the supposition that Cossey
and Son's branch establishments were suffering from his son's absence.
</p><p>"Well," he said, in his high, piercing voice, "business is business, and
must be attended to, so perhaps you had better go. They talk about the
fleeting character of things, but there is one thing that never changes,
and that is money. Money is immortal; men may come and men may go, but
money goes on for ever. Hee! hee! money is the honey-pot, and men are
the flies; and some get their fill and some stick their wings, but
the honey is always there, so never mind the flies. No, never mind
me either; you go and look after the honey, Edward. Money--honey,
honey--money, they rhyme, don't they? And look here, by the way, if you
get a chance--and the world is full of chances to men who have plenty
of money--mind you don't forget to pay out that half-pay Colonel--what's
his name?--Quaritch. He played our family a dirty trick, and there's
your poor Aunt Julia in a lunatic asylum to this moment and a constant
source of expense to us."
</p><p>And so Edward bade his estimable parent farewell and departed. Nor in
truth did he require any admonition from Mr. Cossey, Senior, to make
him anxious to do Colonel Quaritch an ill-turn if the opportunity should
serve. Mrs. Quest, in her numerous affectionate letters, had more
than once, possibly for reasons of her own, given him a full and vivid
<u>resume</u> of the local gossip about the Colonel and Ida, who were, she
said, according to common report, engaged to be married. Now, absence
had not by any means cooled Edward's devotion to Miss de la Molle, which
was a sincere one enough in its own way. On the contrary, the longer
he was away from her the more his passion grew, and with it a vigorous
undergrowth of jealousy. He had, it is true, Ida's implied promise that
she would marry him if he chose to ask her, but on this he put no great
reliance. Hence his hurry to return to Boisingham.
</p><p>Leaving London by an afternoon train, he reached Boisingham about
half-past six, and in pursuance of an arrangement already made, went to
dine with the Quests. When he reached the house he found Belle alone
in the drawing-room, for her husband, having come in late, was still
dressing, but somewhat to his relief he had no opportunity of private
conversation with her, for a servant was in the room, attending to the
fire, which would not burn. The dinner passed off quietly enough, though
there was an ominous look about the lady's face which, being familiar
with these signs of the feminine weather, he did not altogether like.
After dinner, however, Mr. Quest excused himself, saying that he
had promised to attend a local concert in aid of the funds for the
restoration of the damaged pinnacle of the parish church, and he was
left alone with the lady.
</p><p>Then it was that all her pent-up passion broke out. She overwhelmed him
with her affection, she told him that her life had been a blank while
he was away, she reproached him with the scarcity and coldness of his
letters, and generally went on in a way with which he was but too well
accustomed, and, if the truth must be told, heartily tired. His mood
was an irritable one, and to-night the whole thing wearied him beyond
bearing.
</p><p>"Come, Belle," he said at last, "for goodness' sake be a little more
rational. You are getting too old for this sort of tomfoolery, you
know."
</p><p>She sprang up and faced him, her eyes flashing and her breast heaving
with jealous anger. "What do you mean?" she said. "Are you tired of me?"
</p><p>"I did not say that," he answered, "but as you have started the subject
I must tell you that I think all this has gone far enough. Unless it is
stopped I believe we shall both be ruined. I am sure that your husband
is becoming suspicious, and as I have told you again and again, if once
the business gets to my father's ears he will disinherit me."
</p><p>Belle stood quite still till he had finished. She had assumed her
favourite attitude and crossed her arms behind her back, and her sweet
childish face was calm and very white.
</p><p>"What is the good of making excuses and telling me what is not true,
Edward?" she said. "One never hears a man who loves a woman talk like
that; prudence comes with weariness, and men grow circumspect when there
is nothing more to gain. You <u>are</u> tired of me. I have seen it a long
time, but like a blind fool I have tried not to believe it. It is not
a great reward to a woman who has given her whole life to a man, but
perhaps it is as much as she can expect, for I do not want to be unjust
to you. I am the most to blame, because we need never take a false step
except of our own free will."
</p><p>"Well, well," he said impatiently, "what of it?"
</p><p>"Only this, Edward. I have still a little pride left, and as you are
tired of me, why--<u>go</u>."
</p><p>He tried hard to prevent it, but do what he would, a look of relief
struggled into his face. She saw it, and it stung her almost to madness.
</p><p>"You need not look so happy, Edward; it is scarcely decent; and,
besides, you have not heard all that I have to say. I know what this
arises from. You are in love with Ida de la Molle. Now <u>there</u> I draw
the line. You may leave me if you like, but you shall not marry Ida
while I am alive to prevent it. That is more than I can bear. Besides,
like a wise woman, she wishes to marry Colonel Quaritch, who is worth
two of you, Edward Cossey."
</p><p>"I do not believe it," he answered; "and what right have you to say that
I am in love with Miss de la Molle? And if I am in love with her, how
can you prevent me from marrying her if I choose?"
</p><p>"Try and you will see," she answered, with a little laugh. "And now,
as the curtain has dropped, and it is all over between us, why the best
thing that we can do is to put out the lights and go to bed," and she
laughed again and courtesied with much assumed playfulness. "Good-night,
Mr. Cossey; good-night, and good-bye."
</p><p>He held out his hand. "Come, Belle," he said, "don't let us part like
this."
</p><p>She shook her head and once more put her arms behind her. "No," she
answered, "I will not take your hand. Of my own free will I shall never
touch it again, for to me it is like the hand of the dead. Good-bye,
once more; good-bye to you, Edward, and to all the happiness that I ever
had. I built up my life upon my love for you, and you have shattered it
like glass. I do not reproach you; you have followed after your nature
and I must follow after mine, and in time all things will come right--in
the grave. I shall not trouble you any more, provided that you do not
try to marry Ida, for that I will not bear. And now go, for I am very
tired," and turning, she rang the bell for the servant to show him out.
</p><p>In another minute he was gone. She listened till she heard the front
door close behind him, and then gave way to her grief. Flinging herself
upon the sofa, she covered her face with her hands and moaned bitterly,
weeping for the past, and weeping, too, for the long desolate years that
were to come. Poor woman! whatever was the measure of her sin it had
assuredly found her out, as our sins always do find us out in the end.
She had loved this man with a love which has no parallel in the hearts
of well-ordered and well-brought-up women. She never really lived till
this fatal passion took possession of her, and now that its object had
deserted her, her heart felt as though it was dead within her. In that
short half-hour she suffered more than many women do in their whole
lives. But the paroxysm passed, and she rose pale and trembling, with
set teeth and blazing eyes.
</p><p>"He had better be careful," she said to herself; "he may go, but if he
tries to marry Ida I will keep my word--yes, for her sake as well as
his."
</p><p>When Edward Cossey came to consider the position, which he did
seriously, on the following morning, he did not find it very
satisfactory. To begin with, he was not altogether a heartless man, and
such a scene as that which he had passed through on the previous evening
was in itself quite enough to upset his nerves. At one time, at any
rate, he had been much attached to Mrs. Quest; he had never borne her
any violent affection; that had all been on her side, but still he had
been fond of her, and if he could have done so, would probably have
married her. Even now he was attached to her, and would have been glad
to remain her friend if she would have allowed it. But then came the
time when her heroics began to weary him, and he on his side began
to fall in love with Ida de la Molle, and as he drew back so she came
forward, till at length he was worn out, and things culminated as has
been described. He was sorry for her too, knowing how deeply she was
attached to him, though it is probable that he did not in the least
realise the extent to which she suffered, for neither men nor women who
have intentionally or otherwise been the cause of intense mental
anguish to one of the opposite sex ever do quite realise this. They,
not unnaturally, measure the trouble by the depth of their own, and are
therefore very apt to come to erroneous conclusions. Of course this
is said of cases where all the real passion is on one side, and
indifference or comparative indifference on the other; for where it is
mutual, the grief will in natures of equal depth be mutual also.
</p><p>At any rate, Edward Cossey was quite sensitive enough to acutely feel
parting with Mrs. Quest, and perhaps he felt the manner of it even more
than the fact of the separation. Then came another consideration. He
was, it is true, free from his entanglement, in itself an enormous
relief, but the freedom was of a conditional nature. Belle had
threatened trouble in the most decisive tones should he attempt to carry
out his secret purpose of marrying Ida, which she had not been slow to
divine. For some occult reason, at least to him it seemed occult, the
idea of this alliance was peculiarly distasteful to her, though no doubt
the true explanation was that she believed, and not inaccurately, that
in order to bring it about he was bent upon deserting her. The question
with him was, would she or would she not attempt to put her threat into
execution? It certainly seemed to him difficult to imagine what steps
she could take to that end, seeing that any such steps would necessarily
involve her own exposure, and that too when there was nothing to gain,
and when all hopes of thereby securing him for herself had passed away.
Nor did he seriously believe that she would attempt anything of the
sort. It is one thing for a woman to make such threats in the acute
agony of her jealousy, and quite another for her to carry them out in
cold blood. Looking at the matter from a man's point of view, it seemed
to him extremely improbable that when the occasion came she would
attempt such a move. He forgot how much more violently, when once it has
taken possession of his being, the storm of passion sweeps through such
a woman's heart than through a man's, and how utterly reckless to all
consequence the former sometimes becomes. For there are women with whom
all things melt in that white heat of anguished jealousy--honour, duty,
conscience, and the restraint of religion--and of these Belle Quest was
one.
</p><p>But of this he was not aware, and though he recognised a risk, he saw
in it no sufficient reason to make him stay his hand. For day by day the
strong desire to make Ida his wife had grown upon him, till at last
it possessed him body and soul. For a long while the intent had been
smouldering in his breast, and the tale that he now heard, to the effect
that Colonel Quaritch had been beforehand with him, had blown it into a
flame. Ida was ever present in his thoughts; even at night he could not
be rid of her, for when he slept her vision, dark-eyed and beautiful,
came stealing down his dreams. She was his heaven, and if by any ladder
known to man he might climb thereto, thither he would climb. And so
he set his teeth and vowed that, Mrs. Quest or no Mrs. Quest, he would
stake his fortune upon the hazard of the die, aye, and win, even if he
loaded the dice.
</p><p>While he was still thinking thus, standing at his window and gazing out
on to the market place of the quiet little town, he suddenly saw Ida
herself driving in her pony-carriage. It was a wet and windy day, the
rain was on her cheek, and the wind tossed a little lock of her
brown hair. The cob was pulling, and her proud face was set, as she
concentrated her energies upon holding him. Never to Edward Cossey had
she looked more beautiful. His heart beat fast at the sight of her, and
whatever doubts might have lingered in his mind, vanished. Yes, he would
claim her promise and marry her.
</p><p>Presently the pony carriage pulled up at his door, and the boy who was
sitting behind got down and rang the bell. He stepped back from the
window, wondering what it could be.
</p><p>"Will you please give that note to Mr. Cossey," said Ida, as the door
opened, "and ask him to send an answer?" and she was gone.
</p><p>The note was from the Squire, sealed with his big seal (the Squire
always sealed his letters in the old-fashioned way), and contained an
invitation to himself to shoot on the morrow. "George wants me to do a
little partridge driving," it ended, "and to brush through one or two of
the small coverts. There will only be Colonel Quaritch besides yourself
and George, but I hope that you will have a fair rough day. If I don't
hear from you I shall suppose that you are coming, so don't trouble to
write."
</p><p>"Oh yes, I will go," said Edward. "Confound that Quaritch. At any rate I
can show him how to shoot, and what is more I will have it out with him
about my aunt."
