<p>At ten o'clock that same evening Clay began to prepare himself for the
ball at the Government palace, and MacWilliams, who was not invited,
watched him dress with critical approval that showed no sign of envy.
</p><p>The better to do honor to the President, Clay had brought out several
foreign orders, and MacWilliams helped him to tie around his neck the
collar of the Red Eagle which the German Emperor had given him, and to
fasten the ribbon and cross of the Star of Olancho across his breast,
and a Spanish Order and the Legion of Honor to the lapel of his coat.
MacWilliams surveyed the effect of the tiny enamelled crosses with his
head on one side, and with the same air of affectionate pride and
concern that a mother shows over her daughter's first ball-dress.
</p><p>"Got any more?" he asked, anxiously.
</p><p>"I have some war medals," Clay answered, smiling doubtfully. "But I'm
not in uniform."
</p><p>"Oh, that's all right," declared MacWilliams.  "Put 'em on, put 'em all
on.  Give the girls a treat.  Everybody will think they were given for
feats of swimming, anyway; but they will show up well from the front.
Now, then, you look like a drum-major or a conjuring chap."
</p><p>"I do not," said Clay.  "I look like a French Ambassador, and I hardly
understand how you find courage to speak to me at all."
</p><p>He went up the hill in high spirits, and found the carriage at the door
and King, Mr. Langham, and Miss Langham sitting waiting for him.  They
were ready to depart, and Miss Langham had but just seated herself in
the carriage when they heard hurrying across the tiled floor a quick,
light step and the rustle of silk, and turning they saw Hope standing
in the doorway, radiant and smiling.  She wore a white frock that
reached to the ground, and that left her arms and shoulders bare.  Her
hair was dressed high upon her head, and she was pulling vigorously at
a pair of long, tan-colored gloves.  The transformation was so
complete, and the girl looked so much older and so stately and
beautiful, that the two young men stared at her in silent admiration
and astonishment.
</p><p>"Why, Hope!" exclaimed her sister.  "What does this mean?"
</p><p>Hope stopped in some alarm, and clasped her hair with both hands.
</p><p>"What is it?" she asked; "is anything wrong?"
</p><p>"Why, my dear child," said her sister, "you're not thinking of going
with us, are you?"
</p><p>"Not going?" echoed the younger sister, in dismay.  "Why, Alice, why
not? I was asked."
</p><p>"But, Hope-- Father," said the elder sister, stepping out of the
carriage and turning to Mr. Langham, "you didn't intend that Hope
should go, did you?  She's not out yet."
</p><p>"Oh, nonsense," said Hope, defiantly.  But she drew in her breath
quickly and blushed, as she saw the two young men moving away out of
hearing of this family crisis.  She felt that she was being made to
look like a spoiled child.  "It doesn't count down here," she said,
"and I want to go.  I thought you knew I was going all the time.  Marie
made this frock for me on purpose."
</p><p>"I don't think Hope is old enough," the elder sister said, addressing
her father, "and if she goes to dances here, there's no reason why she
should not go to those at home."
</p><p>"But I don't want to go to dances at home," interrupted Hope.
</p><p>Mr. Langham looked exceedingly uncomfortable, and turned appealingly to
his elder daughter.  "What do you think, Alice?" he said, doubtfully.
</p><p>"I'm sorry," Miss Langham replied, "but I know it would not be at all
proper.  I hate to seem horrid about it, Hope, but indeed you are too
young, and the men here are not the men a young girl ought to meet."
</p><p>"You meet them, Alice," said Hope, but pulling off her gloves in token
of defeat.
</p><p>"But, my dear child, I'm fifty years older than you are."
</p><p>"Perhaps Alice knows best, Hope," Mr. Langham said.  "I'm sorry if you
are disappointed."
</p><p>Hope held her head a little higher, and turned toward the door.
</p><p>"I don't mind if you don't wish it, father," she said. "Good-night."
She moved away, but apparently thought better of it, and came back and
stood smiling and nodding to them as they seated themselves in the
carriage.  Mr. Langham leaned forward and said, in a troubled voice,
"We will tell you all about it in the morning.  I'm very sorry.  You
won't be lonely, will you? I'll stay with you if you wish."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" laughed Hope.  "Why, it's given to you, father; don't
bother about me.  I'll read something or other and go to bed."
</p><p>"Good-night, Cinderella," King called out to her.
</p><p>"Good-night, Prince Charming," Hope answered.
</p><p>Both Clay and King felt that the girl would not mind missing the ball
so much as she would the fact of having been treated like a child in
their presence, so they refrained from any expression of sympathy or
regret, but raised their hats and bowed a little more impressively than
usual as the carriage drove away.
</p><p>The picture Hope made, as she stood deserted and forlorn on the steps
of the empty house in her new finery, struck Clay as unnecessarily
pathetic.  He felt a strong sense of resentment against her sister and
her father, and thanked heaven devoutly that he was out of their class,
and when Miss Langham continued to express her sorrow that she had been
forced to act as she had done, he remained silent.  It seemed to Clay
such a simple thing to give children pleasure, and to remember that
their woes were always out of all proportion to the cause.  Children,
dumb animals, and blind people were always grouped together in his mind
as objects demanding the most tender and constant consideration.  So
the pleasure of the evening was spoiled for him while he remembered the
hurt and disappointed look in Hope's face, and when Miss Langham asked
him why he was so preoccupied, he told her bluntly that he thought she
had been very unkind to Hope, and that her objections were absurd.
</p><p>Miss Langham held herself a little more stiffly.  "Perhaps you do not
quite understand, Mr. Clay," she said.  "Some of us have to conform to
certain rules that the people with whom we best like to associate have
laid down for themselves.  If we choose to be conventional, it is
probably because we find it makes life easier for the greater number.
You cannot think it was a pleasant task for me.  But I have given up
things of much more importance than a dance for the sake of
appearances, and Hope herself will see to-morrow that I acted for the
best."
</p><p>Clay said he trusted so, but doubted it, and by way of re-establishing
himself in Miss Langham's good favor, asked her if she could give him
the next dance.  But Miss Langham was not to be propitiated.
</p><p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but I believe I am engaged until supper-time.
Come and ask me then, and I'll have one saved for you.  But there is
something you can do," she added.  "I left my fan in the carriage--do
you think you could manage to get it for me without much trouble?"
</p><p>"The carriage did not wait.  I believe it was sent back," said Clay,
"but I can borrow a horse from one of Stuart's men, and ride back and
get it for you, if you like."
</p><p>"How absurd!" laughed Miss Langham, but she looked pleased,
notwithstanding.
</p><p>"Oh, not at all," Clay answered.  He was smiling down at her in some
amusement, and was apparently much entertained at his idea. "Will you
consider it an act of devotion?" he asked.
</p><p>There was so little of devotion, and so much more of mischief in his
eyes, that Miss Langham guessed he was only laughing at her, and shook
her head.
</p><p>"You won't go," she said, turning away.  She followed him with her
eyes, however, as he crossed the room, his head and shoulders towering
above the native men and women.  She had never seen him so resplendent,
and she noted, with an eye that considered trifles, the orders, and his
well-fitting white gloves, and his manner of bowing in the Continental
fashion, holding his opera-hat on his thigh, as though his hand rested
on a sword.  She noticed that the little Olanchoans stopped and looked
after him, as he pushed his way among them, and she could see that the
men were telling the women who he was.  Sir Julian Pindar, the old
British Minister, stopped him, and she watched them as they laughed
together over the English war medals on the American's breast, which
Sir Julian touched with his finger.  He called the French Minister and
his pretty wife to look, too, and they all laughed and talked together
in great spirits, and Miss Langham wondered if Clay was speaking in
French to them.
</p><p>Miss Langham did not enjoy the ball; she felt injured and aggrieved,
and she assured herself that she had been hardly used.
</p><p>She had only done her duty, and yet all the sympathy had gone to her
sister, who had placed her in a trying position.  She thought it was
most inconsiderate.
</p><p>Hope walked slowly across the veranda when the others had gone, and
watched the carriage as long as it remained in sight.  Then she threw
herself into a big arm-chair, and looked down upon her pretty frock and
her new dancing-slippers.  She, too, felt badly used.
</p><p>The moonlight fell all about her, as it had on the first night of their
arrival, a month before, but now it seemed cold and cheerless, and gave
an added sense of loneliness to the silent house.  She did not go
inside to read, as she had promised to do, but sat for the next hour
looking out across the harbor.  She could not blame Alice.  She
considered that Alice always moved by rules and precedents, like a
queen in a game of chess, and she wondered why.  It made life so tame
and uninteresting, and yet people invariably admired Alice, and some
one had spoken of her as the noblest example of the modern gentlewoman.
She was sure she could not grow up to be any thing like that.  She was
quite confident that she was going to disappoint her family.  She
wondered if people would like her better if she were discreet like
Alice, and less like her brother Ted.  If Mr. Clay, for instance, would
like her better?  She wondered if he disapproved of her riding on the
engine with MacWilliams, and of her tearing through the mines on her
pony, and spearing with a lance of sugar-cane at the mongrel curs that
ran to snap at his flanks. She remembered his look of astonished
amusement the day he had caught her in this impromptu pig-sticking, and
she felt herself growing red at the recollection.  She was sure he
thought her a tomboy.  Probably he never thought of her at all.
</p><p>Hope leaned back in the chair and looked up at the stars above the
mountains and tried to think of any of her heroes and princes in
fiction who had gone through such interesting experiences as had Mr.
Clay.  Some of them had done so, but they were creatures in a book and
this hero was alive, and she knew him, and had probably made him
despise her as a silly little girl who was scolded and sent off to bed
like a disobedient child.  Hope felt a choking in her throat and
something like a tear creep to her eyes: but she was surprised to find
that the fact did not make her ashamed of herself.  She owned that she
was wounded and disappointed, and to make it harder she could not help
picturing Alice and Clay laughing and talking together in some corner
away from the ball-room, while she, who understood him so well, and who
could not find the words to tell him how much she valued what he was
and what he had done, was forgotten and sitting here alone, like
Cinderella, by the empty fireplace.
</p><p>The picture was so pathetic as Hope drew it, that for a moment she felt
almost a touch of self-pity, but the next she laughed scornfully at her
own foolishness, and rising with an impatient shrug, walked away in the
direction of her room.
</p><p>But before she had crossed the veranda she was stopped by the sound of
a horse's hoofs galloping over the hard sun-baked road that led from
the city, and before she had stepped forward out of the shadow in which
she stood the horse had reached the steps and his rider had pulled him
back on his haunches and swung himself off before the forefeet had
touched the ground.
</p><p>Hope had guessed that it was Clay by his riding, and she feared from
his haste that some one of her people were ill.  So she ran anxiously
forward and asked if anything were wrong.
</p><p>Clay started at her sudden appearance, and gave a short boyish laugh of
pleasure.
</p><p>"I'm so glad you're still up," he said.  "No, nothing is wrong."  He
stopped in some embarrassment.  He had been moved to return by the fact
that the little girl he knew was in trouble, and now that he was
suddenly confronted by this older and statelier young person, his
action seemed particularly silly, and he was at a loss to explain it in
any way that would not give offence.
</p><p>"No, nothing is wrong," he repeated.  "I came after something."
</p><p>Clay had borrowed one of the cloaks the troopers wore at night from the
same man who had lent him the horse, and as he stood bareheaded before
her, with the cloak hanging from his shoulders to the floor and the
star and ribbon across his breast, Hope felt very grateful to him for
being able to look like a Prince or a hero in a book, and to yet remain
her Mr. Clay at the same time.
</p><p>"I came to get your sister's fan," Clay explained.  "She forgot it."
</p><p>The young girl looked at him for a moment in surprise and then
straightened herself slightly.  She did not know whether she was the
more indignant with Alice for sending such a man on so foolish an
errand, or with Clay for submitting to such a service.
</p><p>"Oh, is that it?" she said at last.  "I will go and find you one."  She
gave him a dignified little bow and moved away toward the door, with
every appearance of disapproval.
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," she heard Clay say, doubtfully; "I don't have to go
just yet, do I?  May I not stay here a little while?"
</p><p>Hope stood and looked at him in some perplexity.
</p><p>"Why, yes," she answered, wonderingly.  "But don't you want to go back?
You came in a great hurry.  And won't Alice want her fan?"
</p><p>"Oh, she has it by this time.  I told Stuart to find it.  She left it
in the carriage, and the carriage is waiting at the end of the plaza."
</p><p>"Then why did you come?" asked Hope, with rising suspicion.
</p><p>"Oh, I don't know," said Clay, helplessly.  "I thought I'd just like a
ride in the moonlight.  I hate balls and dances anyway, don't you?  I
think you were very wise not to go."
</p><p>Hope placed her hands on the back of the big arm-chair and looked
steadily at him as he stood where she could see his face in the
moonlight.  "You came back," she said, "because they thought I was
crying, and they sent you to see.  Is that it?  Did Alice send you?"
she demanded.
</p><p>Clay gave a gasp of consternation.
</p><p>"You know that no one sent me," he said.  "I thought they treated you
abominably, and I wanted to come and say so.  That's all.  And I wanted
to tell you that I missed you very much, and that your not coming had
spoiled the evening for me, and I came also because I preferred to talk
to you than to stay where I was. No one knows that I came to see you.
I said I was going to get the fan, and I told Stuart to find it after
I'd left.  I just wanted to see you, that's all.  But I will go back
again at once."
</p><p>While he had been speaking Hope had lowered her eyes from his face and
had turned and looked out across the harbor.  There was a strange,
happy tumult in her breast, and she was breathing so rapidly that she
was afraid he would notice it.  She also felt an absurd inclination to
cry, and that frightened her.  So she laughed and turned and looked up
into his face again.  Clay saw the same look in her eyes that he had
seen there the day when she had congratulated him on his work at the
mines.  He had seen it before in the eyes of other women and it
troubled him.  Hope seated herself in the big chair, and Clay tossed
his cloak on the floor at her feet and sat down with his shoulders
against one of the pillars.  He glanced up at her and found that the
look that had troubled him was gone, and that her eyes were now smiling
with excitement and pleasure.
</p><p>"And did you bring me something from the ball in your pocket to comfort
me," she asked, mockingly.
</p><p>"Yes, I did," Clay answered, unabashed.  "I brought you some bonbons."
</p><p>"You didn't, really!" Hope cried, with a shriek of delight. "How absurd
of you!  The sort you pull?"
</p><p>"The sort you pull," Clay repeated, gravely.  "And also a dance-card,
which is a relic of barbarism still existing in this Southern capital.
It has the arms of Olancho on it in gold, and I thought you might like
to keep it as a souvenir."  He pulled the card from his coat-pocket and
said, "May I have this dance?"
</p><p>"You may," Hope answered.  "But you wouldn't mind if we sat it out,
would you?"
</p><p>"I should prefer it," Clay said, as he scrawled his name across the
card.  "It is so crowded inside, and the company is rather mixed."
They both laughed lightly at their own foolishness, and Hope smiled
down upon him affectionately and proudly.  "You may smoke, if you
choose; and would you like something cool to drink?" she asked,
anxiously.  "After your ride, you know," she suggested, with hospitable
intent.  Clay said that he was very comfortable without a drink, but
lighted a cigar and watched her covertly through the smoke, as she sat
smiling happily and quite unconsciously upon the moonlit world around
them.  She caught Clay's eye fixed on her, and laughed lightly.
</p><p>"What is it?" he said.
</p><p>"Oh, I was just thinking," Hope replied, "that it was much better to
have a dance come to you, than to go to the dance."
</p><p>"Does one man and a dance-card and three bonbons constitute your idea
of a ball?"
</p><p>"Doesn't it?  You see, I am not out yet, I don't know."
</p><p>"I should think it might depend a good deal upon the man," Clay
suggested.
</p><p>"That sounds as though you were hinting," said Hope, doubtfully.  "Now
what would I say to that if I were out?"
</p><p>"I don't know, but don't say it," Clay answered.  "It would probably be
something very unflattering or very forward, and in either case I
should take you back to your chaperon and leave you there."
</p><p>Hope had not been listening.  Her eyes were fixed on a level with his
tie, and Clay raised his hand to it in some trepidation. "Mr. Clay,"
she began abruptly and leaning eagerly forward, "would you think me
very rude if I asked you what you did to get all those crosses?  I know
they mean something, and I do so want to know what.  Please tell me."
</p><p>"Oh, those!" said Clay.  "The reason I put them on to-night is because
wearing them is supposed to be a sort of compliment to your host.  I
got in the habit abroad--"
</p><p>"I didn't ask you that," said Hope, severely.  "I asked you what you
did to get them.  Now begin with the Legion of Honor on the left, and
go right on until you come to the end, and please don't skip anything.
Leave in all the bloodthirsty parts, and please don't be modest."
</p><p>"Like Othello," suggested Clay.
</p><p>"Yes," said Hope; "I will be Desdemona."
</p><p>"Well, Desdemona, it was like this," said Clay, laughing.  "I got that
medal and that star for serving in the Nile campaign, under Wolseley.
After I left Egypt, I went up the coast to Algiers, where I took
service under the French in a most disreputable organization known as
the Foreign Legion--"
</p><p>"Don't tell me," exclaimed Hope, in delight, "that you have been a
Chasseur d'Afrique!  Not like the man in 'Under Two Flags'?"
</p><p>"No, not at all like that man," said Clay, emphatically.  "I was just a
plain, common, or garden, sappeur, and I showed the other
good-for-nothings how to dig trenches.  Well, I contaminated the
Foreign Legion for eight months, and then I went to Peru, where I--"
</p><p>"You're skipping," said Hope.  "How did you get the Legion of Honor?"
</p><p>"Oh, that?" said Clay.  "That was a gallery play I made once when we
were chasing some Arabs.  They took the French flag away from our
color-bearer, and I got it back again and waved it frantically around
my head until I was quite certain the Colonel had seen me doing it, and
then I stopped as soon as I knew that I was sure of promotion."
</p><p>"Oh, how can you?" cried Hope.  "You didn't do anything of the sort.
You probably saved the entire regiment."
</p><p>"Well, perhaps I did," Clay returned.  "Though I don't remember it, and
nobody mentioned it at the time."
</p><p>"Go on about the others," said Hope.  "And do try to be truthful."
</p><p>"Well, I got this one from Spain, because I was President of an
International Congress of Engineers at Madrid.  That was the ostensible
reason, but the real reason was because I taught the Spanish
Commissioners to play poker instead of baccarat.  The German Emperor
gave me this for designing a fort, and the Sultan of Zanzibar gave me
this, and no one but the Sultan knows why, and he won't tell.  I
suppose he's ashamed.  He gives them away instead of cigars.  He was
out of cigars the day I called."
</p><p>"What a lot of places you have seen," sighed Hope.  "I have been in
Cairo and Algiers, too, but I always had to walk about with a
governess, and she wouldn't go to the mosques because she said they
were full of fleas.  We always go to Homburg and Paris in the summer,
and to big hotels in London.  I love to travel, but I don't love to
travel that way, would you?"
</p><p>"I travel because I have no home," said Clay.  "I'm different from the
chap that came home because all the other places were shut.  I go to
other places because there is no home open."
</p><p>"What do you mean?" said Hope, shaking her head.  "Why have you no
home?"
</p><p>"There was a ranch in Colorado that I used to call home," said Clay,
"but they've cut it up into town lots.  I own a plot in the cemetery
outside of the town, where my mother is buried, and I visit that
whenever I am in the States, and that is the only piece of earth
anywhere in the world that I have to go back to."
</p><p>Hope leaned forward with her hands clasped in front of her and her eyes
wide open.
</p><p>"And your father?" she said, softly; "is he--is he there, too--"
</p><p>Clay looked at the lighted end of his cigar as he turned it between his
fingers.
</p><p>"My father, Miss Hope," he said, "was a filibuster, and went out on the
'Virginius' to help free Cuba, and was shot, against a stone wall.  We
never knew where he was buried."
</p><p>"Oh, forgive me; I beg your pardon," said Hope.  There was such
distress in her voice that Clay looked at her quickly and saw the tears
in her eyes.  She reached out her hand timidly, and touched for an
instant his own rough, sunburned fist, as it lay clenched on his knee.
"I am so sorry," she said, "so sorry."  For the first time in many
years the tears came to Clay's eyes and blurred the moonlight and the
scene before him, and he sat unmanned and silent before the simple
touch of a young girl's sympathy.
</p><p>An hour later, when his pony struck the gravel from beneath his hoofs
on the race back to the city, and Clay turned to wave his hand to Hope
in the doorway, she seemed, as she stood with the moonlight falling
about her white figure, like a spirit beckoning the way to a new
paradise.
