<P>
Lord and Lady Montbarry were received by the housekeeper;
the manager being absent for a day or two on business connected
with the affairs of the hotel.
<P>
The rooms reserved for the travellers on the first floor were
three in number; consisting of two bedrooms opening into each other,
and communicating on the left with a drawing-room. Complete so far,
the arrangements proved to be less satisfactory in reference
to the third bedroom required for Agnes and for the eldest daughter
of Lord Montbarry, who usually slept with her on their travels.
The bed-chamber on the right of the drawing-room was already occupied
by an English widow lady.  Other bedchambers at the other end
of the corridor were also let in every case.  There was accordingly
no alternative but to place at the disposal of Agnes a comfortable
room on the second floor.  Lady Montbarry vainly complained of this
separation of one of the members of her travelling party from the rest.
The housekeeper politely hinted that it was impossible for her
to ask other travellers to give up their rooms.  She could only
express her regret, and assure Miss Lockwood that her bed-chamber
on the second floor was one of the best rooms in that part of
the hotel.
<P>
On the retirement of the housekeeper, Lady Montbarry noticed
that Agnes had seated herself apart, feeling apparently no interest
in the question of the bedrooms.  Was she ill?  No; she felt
a little unnerved by the railway journey, and that was all.
Hearing this, Lord Montbarry proposed that she should go out with him,
and try the experiment of half an hour's walk in the cool evening air.
Agnes gladly accepted the suggestion.  They directed their steps
towards the square of St. Mark, so as to enjoy the breeze blowing
over the lagoon.  It was the first visit of Agnes to Venice.
The fascination of the wonderful city of the waters exerted its
full influence over her sensitive nature.  The proposed half-hour
of the walk had passed away, and was fast expanding to half
an hour more, before Lord Montbarry could persuade his companion
to remember that dinner was waiting for them.  As they returned,
passing under the colonnade, neither of them noticed a lady
in deep mourning, loitering in the open space of the square.
She started as she recognised Agnes walking with the new Lord Montbarry--
hesitated for a moment--and then followed them, at a discreet distance,
back to the hotel.
<P>
Lady Montbarry received Agnes in high spirits--with news of an event
which had happened in her absence.
<P>
She had not left the hotel more than ten minutes, before a little
note in pencil was brought to Lady Montbarry by the housekeeper.
The writer proved to be no less a person than the widow lady
who occupied the room on the other side of the drawing-room,
which her ladyship had vainly hoped to secure for Agnes.
Writing under the name of Mrs. James, the polite widow explained
that she had heard from the housekeeper of the disappointment
experienced by Lady Montbarry in the matter of the rooms.
Mrs. James was quite alone; and as long as her bed-chamber was airy
and comfortable, it mattered nothing to her whether she slept on
the first or the second floor of the house.  She had accordingly
much pleasure in proposing to change rooms with Miss Lockwood.
Her luggage had already been removed, and Miss Lockwood had only to
take possession of the room (Number 13 A), which was now entirely at
her disposal.
<P>
'I immediately proposed to see Mrs. James,' Lady Montbarry continued,
'and to thank her personally for her extreme kindness.
But I was informed that she had gone out, without leaving word
at what hour she might be expected to return.  I have written
a little note of thanks, saying that we hope to have the pleasure
of personally expressing our sense of Mrs. James's courtesy
to-morrow. In the mean time, Agnes, I have ordered your boxes
to be removed downstairs.  Go!--and judge for yourself, my dear,
if that good lady has not given up to you the prettiest room
in the house!'
<P>
With those words, Lady Montbarry left Miss Lockwood to make a hasty
toilet for dinner.
<P>
The new room at once produced a favourable impression on Agnes.
The large window, opening into a balcony, commanded an admirable
view of the canal.  The decorations on the walls and ceiling were
skilfully copied from the exquisitely graceful designs of Raphael
in the Vatican.  The massive wardrobe possessed compartments
of unusual size, in which double the number of dresses that Agnes
possessed might have been conveniently hung at full length.
In the inner corner of the room, near the head of the bedstead,
there was a recess which had been turned into a little dressing-room,
and which opened by a second door on the inferior staircase of
the hotel, commonly used by the servants.  Noticing these aspects
of the room at a glance, Agnes made the necessary change in her dress,
as quickly as possible.  On her way back to the drawing-room she was
addressed by a chambermaid in the corridor who asked for her key.
'I will put your room tidy for the night, Miss,' the woman said,
'and I will then bring the key back to you in the drawing-room.'
<P>
While the chambermaid was at her work, a solitary lady, loitering about
the corridor of the second storey, was watching her over the bannisters.
After a while, the maid appeared, with her pail in her hand,
leaving the room by way of the dressing-room and the back stairs.
As she passed out of sight, the lady on the second floor (no other,
it is needless to add, than the Countess herself) ran swiftly
down the stairs, entered the bed-chamber by the principal door,
and hid herself in the empty side compartment of the wardrobe.
The chambermaid returned, completed her work, locked the door
of the dressing-room on the inner side, locked the principal
entrance-door on leaving the room, and returned the key to Agnes in the
drawing-room.
<P>
The travellers were just sitting down to their late dinner,
when one of the children noticed that Agnes was not wearing her watch.
Had she left it in her bed-chamber in the hurry of changing her dress?
She rose from the table at once in search of her watch; Lady Montbarry
advising her, as she went out, to see to the security of her bed-chamber,
in the event of there being thieves in the house.  Agnes found
her watch, forgotten on the toilet table, as she had anticipated.
Before leaving the room again she acted on Lady Montbarry's advice,
and tried the key in the lock of the dressing-room door.  It was
properly secured.  She left the bed-chamber, locking the main door
behind her.
<P>
Immediately on her departure, the Countess, oppressed by the confined
air in the wardrobe, ventured on stepping out of her hiding place
into the empty room.
<P>
Entering the dressing-room, she listened at the door, until the silence
outside informed her that the corridor was empty.  Upon this,
she unlocked the door, and, passing out, closed it again softly;
leaving it to all appearance (when viewed on the inner side)
as carefully secured as Agnes had seen it when she tried the key in
the lock with her own hand.
<P>
While the Montbarrys were still at dinner, Henry Westwick joined them,
arriving from Milan.
<P>
When he entered the room, and again when he advanced to shake hands
with her, Agnes was conscious of a latent feeling which secretly
reciprocated Henry's unconcealed pleasure on meeting her again.
For a moment only, she returned his look; and in that moment her own
observation told her that she had silently encouraged him to hope.
She saw it in the sudden glow of happiness which overspread his face;
and she confusedly took refuge in the usual conventional inquiries relating
to the relatives whom he had left at Milan.
<P>
Taking his place at the table, Henry gave a most amusing account
of the position of his brother Francis between the mercenary
opera-dancer on one side, and the unscrupulous manager of the French
theatre on the other.  Matters had proceeded to such extremities,
that the law had been called on to interfere, and had decided the dispute
in favour of Francis.  On winning the victory the English manager had
at once left Milan, recalled to London by the affairs of his theatre.
He was accompanied on the journey back, as he had been accompanied
on the journey out, by his sister.  Resolved, after passing two
nights of terror in the Venetian hotel, never to enter it again,
Mrs. Norbury asked to be excused from appearing at the family festival,
on the ground of ill-health. At her age, travelling fatigued her,
and she was glad to take advantage of her brother's escort to return
to England.
<P>
While the talk at the dinner-table flowed easily onward,
the evening-time advanced to night--and it became necessary
to think of sending the children to bed.
<P>
As Agnes rose to leave the room, accompanied by the eldest girl,
she observed with surprise that Henry's manner suddenly changed.
He looked serious and pre-occupied; and when his niece wished him
good night, he abruptly said to her, 'Marian, I want to know what
part of the hotel you sleep in?'  Marian, puzzled by the question,
answered that she was going to sleep, as usual, with 'Aunt Agnes.'
Not satisfied with that reply, Henry next inquired whether the bedroom
was near the rooms occupied by the other members of the travelling party.
Answering for the child, and wondering what Henry's object could
possibly be, Agnes mentioned the polite sacrifice made to her
convenience by Mrs. James.  'Thanks to that lady's kindness,'
she said, 'Marian and I are only on the other side of the drawing-room.'
Henry made no remark; he looked incomprehensibly discontented
as he opened the door for Agnes and her companion to pass out.
After wishing them good night, he waited in the corridor
until he saw them enter the fatal corner-room--and then
he called abruptly to his brother, 'Come out, Stephen, and let
us smoke!'
<P>
As soon as the two brothers were at liberty to speak together privately,
Henry explained the motive which had led to his strange inquiries
about the bedrooms.  Francis had informed him of the meeting with
the Countess at Venice, and of all that had followed it; and Henry now
carefully repeated the narrative to his brother in all its details.
'I am not satisfied,' he added, 'about that woman's purpose in giving
up her room.  Without alarming the ladies by telling them what I
have just told you, can you not warn Agnes to be careful in securing
her door?'
<P>
Lord Montbarry replied, that the warning had been already
given by his wife, and that Agnes might be trusted to take
good care of herself and her little bed-fellow. For the rest,
he looked upon the story of the Countess and her superstitions
as a piece of theatrical exaggeration, amusing enough in itself,
but unworthy of a moment's serious attention.
<P>
While the gentlemen were absent from the hotel, the room which had
been already associated with so many startling circumstances,
became the scene of another strange event in which Lady Montbarry's
eldest child was concerned.
<P>
Little Marian had been got ready for bed as usual, and had
(so far) taken hardly any notice of the new room.  As she knelt
down to say her prayers, she happened to look up at that part
of the ceiling above her which was just over the head of the bed.
The next instant she alarmed Agnes, by starting to her feet
with a cry of terror, and pointing to a small brown spot
on one of the white panelled spaces of the carved ceiling.
'It's a spot of blood!' the child exclaimed.  'Take me away!
I won't sleep here!'
<P>
Seeing plainly that it would be useless to reason with her while she
was in the room, Agnes hurriedly wrapped Marian in a dressing-gown,
and carried her back to her mother in the drawing-room. Here,
the ladies did their best to soothe and reassure the trembling girl.
The effort proved to be useless; the impression that had been
produced on the young and sensitive mind was not to be removed
by persuasion.  Marian could give no explanation of the panic
of terror that had seized her.  She was quite unable to say why
the spot on the ceiling looked like the colour of a spot of blood.
She only knew that she should die of terror if she saw it again.
Under these circumstances, but one alternative was left.  It was
arranged that the child should pass the night in the room occupied
by her two younger sisters and the nurse.
<P>
In half an hour more, Marian was peacefully asleep with her arm
around her sister's neck.  Lady Montbarry went back with Agnes
to her room to see the spot on the ceiling which had so strangely
frightened the child.  It was so small as to be only just perceptible,
and it had in all probability been caused by the carelessness
of a workman, or by a dripping from water accidentally spilt
on the floor of the room above.
<P>
'I really cannot understand why Marian should place such a shocking
interpretation on such a trifling thing,' Lady Montbarry remarked.
<P>
'I suspect the nurse is in some way answerable for what has happened,'
Agnes suggested.  'She may quite possibly have been telling
Marian some tragic nursery story which has left its mischievous
impression behind it.  Persons in her position are sadly ignorant
of the danger of exciting a child's imagination.  You had better
caution the nurse to-morrow.'
<P>
Lady Montbarry looked round the room with admiration.  'Is it
not prettily decorated?' she said.  'I suppose, Agnes, you don't
mind sleeping here by yourself.?'
<P>
Agnes laughed.  'I feel so tired,' she replied, 'that I was thinking
of bidding you good-night, instead of going back to the drawing-room.'
<P>
Lady Montbarry turned towards the door.  'I see your jewel-case on
the table,' she resumed.  'Don't forget to lock the other door there,
in the dressing-room.'
<P>
'I have already seen to it, and tried the key myself,' said Agnes.
'Can I be of any use to you before I go to bed?'
<P>
'No, my dear, thank you; I feel sleepy enough to follow your example.
Good night, Agnes--and pleasant dreams on your first night
in Venice.'
