<p><em>NICK RIBSAM </em>might well be puzzled. Just ahead and on
his right was the most enchanting natural spring of water that
he had ever beheld. It was circular in shape, fully two yards
in diameter and ten or twelve inches deep in the middle. From
several places on the bottom the water bubbled up in a way that
tumbled the sand in miniature fountains, which hid the current
flinging the particles upward from below.</p>

<p>This basin was so clear that at first sight one was doubtful
whether there was any water there at all; but the bubbling sand
and the vigorous stream flowing away and across the trail, and
losing itself among the rocks and vegetation, removed all question
on that point.</p>

<p>The spring was partly shaded by a black bowlder leaning so far
over that it seemed on the point of tumbling in, while the scene
in the immediate vicinity was rougher than any through which they
had passed since crossing the ridge.</p>

<p>Domestic as well as wild animals are quick to discern the presence
of water, and Nick had seen proof in the actions of Jack that
he knew he was near the spring, some time before he himself knew
it. The three were so pleased that they hastened their pace, and
crowded their noses into the cool element, of which they drank
with an enjoyment beyond description.</p>

<p>The youth meant to have a deep refreshing draught himself, but
he had not the heart to check the ponies. He could wait better
than they; they were not unclean animals, and the spring would
quickly free itself of all traces of the contact with their silken
noses.</p>

<p>But while Jack was stretching his head downward and standing
with one fore leg bent at the knee, the better to reach the water,
his rider prepared to give the call for Herbert to join him, when
he was taken all aback by catching precisely the same signal from
his friend.</p>

<p>There could be no mistake about it: he had heard it too often
to confound it with any other sound.</p>

<p>He had noticed, while riding along the trail, that the divergence
became more pronounced, thus separating him from Herbert by a
greater distance than he had anticipated. As nearly as he could
judge from the whistle, his friend was nearly, if not quite an
eighth of a mile away, and between them the slope was so filled
with rocks, bowlders, and stunted vegetation that travelling with
a horse was out of the question. A trained mountaineer would find
the task anything but an easy one. Herbert, therefore, must turn
squarely about, and ride back to the fork in the trail, thus travelling
double the distance made by Nick and the pack horses.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection convinced the latter that Herbert had made
a natural mistake. The stream, winding its way in that direction,
probably formed a pool near the other part, so large and clear
and beautiful that the youth mistook it for the spring itself.</p>

<p>"But he will see his error," reflected Nick, sending out the
ringing blast by which he had summoned his friend many a time;
"he doesn’t like to own up, but, when he looks upon this, he can’t
help himself."</p>

<p>Nick was convinced that there were few such natural springs in
that section of Texas, though similar ones are found in plenty
further east and among some of the mountainous portions.</p>

<p>The horses having had their fill, stepped back, and Nick began
his preparations for spending the night. Everything was taken
from the backs and heads of the animals and placed in a pile on
the ground near at hand, while they were left to crop the grass,
which was green and quite luxuriant in the vicinity of the stream.</p>

<p>By the time everything was complete, darkness had come. The animals
were not tethered, for there was little to be feared of their
running away, unless interfered with by outsiders, of which no
one dreamed.</p>

<p>Nick now began to look for the coming of Herbert. Both paths
were so easily travelled that he ought to appear in the course
of twenty minutes, and a full half hour had gone by.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether anything could have happened to him," said
Nick, gazing down the trail in the gathering gloom, and feeling
a renewal of the fears that troubled him so much in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He once more whistled with the power of a steam engine, and paused
for the response. It was impossible, as he had learned long before,
that Herbert should have made his way on horseback across the
space separating the trails, and he, therefore, gave his attention
to the route over which he himself had just travelled.</p>

<p>Nothing was to be seen of his friend, and the suspicion came
to Nick that possibly he was pouting because of his mistake, but
the thought was dismissed the next minute as unworthy of Herbert,
who, if disposed in that direction, was in no mood to do so at
the present time.</p>

<p>"But where can he be?" repeated Nick, recalling the preceding
winter, when he went astray in the pursuit of the second moose
and caused himself and Pierre Ardeau no end of worriment of mind.
As the darkness increased, Nick Ribsam became aware of another
discomforting fact. The wind was beginning to blow, and the cold
was rapidly increasing. The norther prophesied by the Texans was
at hand.</p>

<p>This being evident, he quickly prepared for it. He had gathered
a quantity of limbs and twigs, but they were unlighted, he intending
to await the arrival of his friend Herbert; but he now started
the fire as quickly as possible, for, aside from its needed warmth,
it would do much to dispel the gloom oppressing him.</p>

<p>Few who have not experienced a Texan norther can understand their
fierce suddenness. I was once riding in a stage in the southern
part of the State, the day was mild and balmy, and a middle-aged
gentleman from New York sat in the seat with me. His overcoat
was in his trunk, which was strapped at the rear of the stage.
We were talking, when all at once a norther came howling across
the country. My friend shouted to the driver to unstrap his trunk,
so as to allow him to unlock it. The driver promptly obeyed, the
gentleman leaping out of the vehicle, hastily unfastening his
luggage, and bringing out the extra garment. Only a few minutes
were occupied, and yet his teeth were chattering and he was shivering
and blue with cold while hurriedly donning his greatcoat.</p>

<p>A young man in Dallas told me he was standing on the opposite
side of the street in his shirt sleeves; a norther arrived; he
struck diagonally for his home on a dead run; that home was less
than two blocks off; he insisted that if he had been delayed on
the way by so much as a fall he would have frozen to death; but,
somehow or other, I think he exaggerated things.</p>

<p>But by the time Nick Ribsam had the fire going, he was shivering.
He gathered his heavy blanket closely about him and sat down near
the blaze, but was still cold. The ponies felt it. They shrunk
against the rocks and wherever they could find any shelter, and
looked dismal and wretched. No blankets had been provided for
them, but the luggage of the entire party was at command and Nick’s
sympathy led him to appropriate the articles without a moment’s
hesitation. It was a kind act and did much for the comfort of
the dumb beasts.</p>

<p>What about Strubell and Lattin? They must suffer, but they were
acclimated and would find some means of warding off the full effort
of the cutting winds, without the help of extra clothing.</p>

<p>But poor Herbert! Nick fairly gasped as he thought of him. He
was in his ordinary costume, and of course had not started a fire.
He would not be likely to do so, since he was on his way to join
Nick and would depend on him for everything of that sort.</p>

<p>"Heaven save him," prayed Nick, "but if he doesn’t arrive soon
he must perish. <em>Hurry, Herbert!</em>" he called at the top
of his voice.</p>

<p>In his anxiety, Nick started down the path with the extra blanket
flung over his arm, while he was so swathed in his own that he
resembled an Indian chief, striding along the trail.</p>

<p>Night had fully come, and the sky, which had been quite clear
during most of the day, was overcast, so that he could see but
a short distance in any direction. Still he hurried on, confident
every minute that the forms of Herbert and Jill would loom to
view in the darkness.</p>

<p>But rod after rod was passed, and they did not appear. Suddenly
Nick stooped down and placed his ear against the earth.</p>

<p>"I hear his pony’s hoofs!" he exclaimed, raising his head and
peering forward, "but why is he so long on the way?"</p>

<p>Applying his ear again, the startling fact was evident: the sound
of the horse’s hoofs was fainter than before. The animal was receding
instead of approaching.</p>

<p>"Something has gone wrong with the poor fellow, and what can
I do to help him?"</p>
