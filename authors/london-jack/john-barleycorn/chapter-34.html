Back on the ranch, in the Valley of the Moon, I resumed my steady
drinking.  My programme was no drink in the morning; first drink-
time came with the completion of my thousand words.  Then, between
that and the midday meal, were drinks numerous enough to develop a
pleasant jingle.  Again, in the hour preceding the evening meal, I
developed another pleasant jingle.  Nobody ever saw me drunk, for
the simple reason that I never was drunk.  But I did get a jingle
twice each day; and the amount of alcohol I consumed every day, if
loosed in the system of one unaccustomed to drink, would have put
such a one on his back and out.
<P>
It was the old proposition.  The more I drank, the more I was
compelled to drink in order to get an effect.  The time came when
cocktails were inadequate.  I had neither the time in which to
drink them nor the space to accommodate them.  Whisky had a more
powerful jolt.  It gave quicker action with less quantity. 
Bourbon or rye, or cunningly aged blends, constituted the pre-
midday drinking.  In the late afternoon it was Scotch and soda.
<P>
My sleep, always excellent, now became not quite so excellent.  I
had been accustomed to read myself back asleep when I chanced to
awake.  But now this began to fail me.  When I had read two or
three of the small hours away and was as wide awake as ever, I
found that a drink furnished the soporific effect.  Sometimes two
or three drinks were required.
<P>
So short a period of sleep then intervened before early morning
rising that my system did not have time to work off the alcohol. 
As a result I awoke with mouth parched and dry, with a slight
heaviness of head, and with a mild nervous palpitation in the
stomach.  In fact I did not feel good.  I was suffering from the
morning sickness of the steady, heavy drinker.  What I needed was
a pick-me-up, a bracer.  Trust John Barleycorn, once he has broken
down a man's defences! So it was a drink before breakfast to put
me right for breakfast--the old poison of the snake that has
bitten one! Another custom begun at this time was that of the
pitcher of water by the bedside to furnish relief to my scorched
and sizzling membranes.
<P>
I achieved a condition in which my body was never free from
alcohol.  Nor did I permit myself to be away from alcohol.  If I
travelled to out-of-the-way places, I declined to run the risk of
finding them dry.  I took a quart, or several quarts, along in my
grip.  In the past I had been amazed by other men guilty of this
practice.  Now I did it myself unblushingly.  And when I got out
with the fellows, I cast all rules by the board.  I drank when
they drank, what they drank, and in the same way they drank.
<P>
I was carrying a beautiful alcoholic conflagration around with me. 
The thing fed on its own heat and flamed the fiercer.  There was
no time, in all my waking time, that I didn't want a drink.  I
began to anticipate the completion of my daily thousand words by
taking a drink when only five hundred words were written.  It was
not long until I prefaced the beginning of the thousand words with
a drink.
<P>
The gravity of this I realised too well.  I made new rules. 
Resolutely I would refrain from drinking until my work was done. 
But a new and most diabolical complication arose.  The work
refused to be done without drinking.  It just couldn't be done.  I
had to drink in order to do it.  I was beginning to fight now.  I
had the craving at last, and it was mastering me.  I would sit at
my desk and dally with pad and pen, but words refused to flow.  My
brain could not think the proper thoughts because continually it
was obsessed with the one thought that across the room in the
liquor cabinet stood John Barleycorn.  When, in despair, I took my
drink, at once my brain loosened up and began to roll off the
thousand words.
<P>
In my town house, in Oakland, I finished the stock of liquor and
wilfully refused to purchase more.  It was no use, because,
unfortunately, there remained in the bottom of the liquor cabinet
a case of beer.  In vain I tried to write.  Now beer is a poor
substitute for strong waters: besides, I didn't like beer, yet all
I could think of was that beer so singularly accessible in the
bottom of the cabinet.  Not until I had drunk a pint of it did the
words begin to reel off, and the thousand were reeled off to the
tune of numerous pints.  The worst of it was that the beer caused
me severe heart-burn; but despite the discomfort I soon finished
off the case.
<P>
The liquor cabinet was now bare.  I did not replenish it.  By
truly heroic perseverance I finally forced myself to write the
daily thousand words without the spur of John Barleycorn.  But all
the time I wrote I was keenly aware of the craving for a drink. 
And as soon as the morning's work was done, I was out of the house
and away down-town to get my first drink.  Merciful goodness!--if
John Barleycorn could get such sway over me, a non-alcoholic, what
must be the sufferings of the true alcoholic, battling against the
organic demands of his chemistry while those closest to him
sympathise little, understand less, and despise and deride him!
