<p>Being a most curious, hitherto unknown<br/>
history, as related by Mr. Isaac Bickerstaff<br/>
but not presented to the World of<br/>
Fashion through the pages of<br/>
The Tatler, and now for the<br/>
first time written down<br/>
by<br/>
Francis Hodgson Burnett

   Mercy; then 'tis for us--the toys of Nature--to be both just and
   merciful, for so only can the wrongs she does be undone.
