<p>Miss Lucy couldn’t be spared to go up to the hill on the second
day of the pastime, for there was some great operation going on
in the cheese room, which she had to overlook. So Mr. Warton drove
me up in the four-wheel. I was very anxious to find out, if I
could, whether there was any thing more between him and Miss Lucy
than friendship, but it wasn’t at all an easy matter. First I
began speaking of the young gentleman who had taken my place in
the four-wheel; for I thought that would be a touchstone, and
that if he were like me he would be glad to get a chance of abusing
this Jack. But he only called him a forward boy, and said he was
a cousin of the Hursts, who lived in the next parish. Then I spoke
of Miss Lucy herself, and he was quite ready to talk about her
as much as I liked, and seemed never tired of praising her. She
was a thoroughly good specimen of an English yeoman’s daughter;
perfectly natural, and therefore perfectly well bred; not above
making good puddings and preserves, and proud of the name her
brother’s cheeses had won in the market, yet not negligent of
other matters, such as the schools, and her garden; never going
into follies of dress in imitation of weak women who ought to
set better examples, yet having a proper appreciation of her own
good looks, and a thorough knowledge of the colours and shapes
which suited her best; not particularly clever or well read, but
with an open mind and a sound judgment&mdash;and so he went on; and
the longer he went on the more I was puzzled, and my belief is,
that on this subject the Parson got much more out of me than I
out of him, on that morning’s drive.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant day on the hill, but as the sports were
all the same as those of the day before (with the exception of
jumping in sacks, which was substituted for climbing the pole,
and was very good fun), I shall not give any further account of
them; especially as the gentlemen who are going to publish my
story seem to think already that I am rather too long-winded.</p>

<p>We got down home in capital time for tea, and Joe followed very
soon afterwards, in the highest spirits; for, as he said, every
thing had gone off so well, and everybody was pleased and satisfied;
so we were all very merry, and had another charming evening. I
couldn’t tell what had come to me when I got up stairs alone by
myself, for I seemed as if a new life were growing up in me, and
I were getting all of a sudden into a much bigger world, full
of all sorts of work and pleasure, which I had never dreamt of,
and of people whom I could get to love and honour, though I might
never see or speak to them.</p>

<p>I had been bred up from a child never to look beyond my own narrow
sphere. To get on in it was the purpose of my life, and I had
drilled myself into despising every thing which did not, as I
thought, help towards this end. Near relations I had none. I was
really fond of my two friends, but I don’t think I should ever
have got to be friends with them if we hadn’t been in the same
office; and I used often to be half provoked with them, and to
think myself a very wise fellow, because out of office-hours they
would read poetry and novels instead of fagging at shorthand or
accounts, as I did, and spent all their salaries instead of saving.
Except those two, I knew nobody; and though I belonged to a debating
society, it wasn’t that I cared for the members, or what they
talked about, but that I thought it might be useful to me to talk
fluently if I got on in business. Sometimes, and especially in
my yearly holidays, I had felt as if I wanted something else,
and that my way of life was after all rather a one-eyed sort of
business; but I set all such misgivings down as delusions, and
had never allowed them long to trouble me. In short I begin to
suspect that I must have been getting to be a very narrow, bigoted,
disagreeable sort of fellow, and it was high time that I should
find my way to Elm Close, or some such place, to have my eyes
opened a little, and discover that a man may work just as steadily
and honestly&mdash;aye, much more steadily and honestly&mdash;at his own
business, without shutting up his brains and his heart against
every thing else that is going on in the world around him. However,
I can’t be too thankful that my teaching came to me in the way
it did, for I might have had to learn my lesson in a very different
school from Elm Close Farm.</p>

<p>There certainly never was such a pleasant school. For the next
two or three days after ‘the Scouring,’ Mr. Warton was my chief
companion. Joe and Miss Lucy both had their work to attend to
after breakfast, and so the Parson and I were left a good deal
together; and we used to start off to see some of the old men
whom he had promised to show me, who could tell me about the old
pastimes. I never liked any thing so much as these walks&mdash;not
even the walks I afterwards used to have alone with Miss Lucy,
for they were too exciting, and half the time I was in such a
fret that I couldn’t thoroughly enjoy them. But there was no drawback
in these walks with the Parson. He was full of fun, and of all
sorts of knowledge; and he liked talking, and I think rather took
a fancy to me, and was pleased to see how I worked at collecting
all the information I could about the White Horse, for he took
a great deal of pains to help me.</p>

<p>One morning though I remember he got me into a regular puzzle
about King Alfred, for I had been reading over my notes of the
old gentleman’s story, and couldn’t make it agree with the tales
which I had read about Alfred’s hiding away in the cowherd’s hut,
and burning the cakes. So I asked Mr. Warton about it.</p>

<p>"I think," said he, "you will find that Alfred was in the cowherd’s
cottage in the year 878, after the battle at Chippenham."</p>

<p>"But, Sir," said I, "according to the old gentleman’s story,
Ashdown was Alfred’s greatest victory; and Ashdown was fought
in 871. Now it seems very odd that he should have to run away
and skulk about in such places after that."</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I’m not well enough up in the history to explain
it to you, but I’m pretty sure you’ll find I’m right about the
dates&mdash;why shouldn’t you write and ask the old gentleman?"</p>

<p>So I did, and I kept a copy of my letter; but I don’t think I
need print that, because his answer will be quite enough without
it. Here it is:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"22d September, 1857.

</p>
<p>
"My Dear Sir,<br/>
&mdash;I am favoured with yours of the 20th ult., which<br/>
came safely to hand this morning. Our post is somewhat behind<br/>
the times, and I know of hardly any town or village from which<br/>
a letter can arrive at this place under two days. I do not<br/>
myself complain of this state of things.

</p>
<p>
"With regard to the subject of your letter, I have to tell you<br/>
that your friend the clergyman is right in his dates. It was in<br/>
the year 878 that Alfred was deserted by his nobles and people<br/>
after the battle of Chippenham, which was a drawn battle. Then<br/>
he fled to the Island of Athelney, in Somersetshire, and the<br/>
incident to which you allude took place, but you have not got<br/>
the verses correctly; they run,&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"‘Casn’t mind the ke-aks mun, and doosn’t zee ’em burn?<br/>
I’ze warn thee’lt yeat ’em vast enough, zo zoon az ’tiz thy turn.’

</p>
<p>
"But you are not to believe from this, that the Danish army<br/>
ever got a hold on the kingdom of Wessex. I think that the<br/>
following passage from Asser’s ‘Life of Alfred’ will explain a<br/>
good deal to you. Referring to his sojourn in Athelney, Asser<br/>
says:&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"‘We may believe that this misfortune was brought upon the<br/>
aforesaid king, because in the beginning of his reign, when<br/>
he was a youth, and influenced by youthful feelings, he would<br/>
not listen to the petitions which his subjects made to him<br/>
for help in their necessities; but he drove them from him and<br/>
paid no heed to their requests. This particular gave much pain<br/>
to the holy man, St. Neot, who was his kinsman; and often<br/>
foretold to him in the spirit of prophecy that he would suffer<br/>
great adversity on this account; but Alfred neither attended<br/>
to the reproof of the man of God, nor listened to his true<br/>
prophecy&mdash;wherefore seeing that a man’s sins must be corrected<br/>
either in this world or the next, the true and righteous Judge<br/>
willed that his sin should not go unpunished in this world, to<br/>
the end that he might spare him in the world to come. From this<br/>
cause, therefore, Alfred often fell into such great misery,<br/>
that sometimes none of his subjects knew where he was, or what<br/>
had become of him.’

</p>
<p>
"And Alfred learned his lesson well in the next few years,<br/>
for you will find that in the year 886 <em>A.D., ‘</em>which was the<br/>
thirty-eighth year since his birth, King Alfred, after the<br/>
burning of cities and slaying of the people, honourably rebuilt<br/>
the city of London and made it again habitable, and gave it<br/>
into the custody of his son-in-law, Æthelred, Earl of Mercia;<br/>
to which King Alfred, all the Angles and Saxons, who before<br/>
had been dispersed every where, or were in captivity with the<br/>
pagans, voluntarily turned and submitted themselves to his<br/>
rule!’

</p>
<p>
"You see they had turned from his rule many of them because it<br/>
was an unjust one in those early years of his reign. But they<br/>
were never subdued by the Danes,&mdash;so that my statement which<br/>
you quote, ‘that the battle of Ashdown saved England from one<br/>
hundred years of Paganism,’ is not shaken.

</p>
<p>
"I have directed my London bookseller to leave a copy of<br/>
Asser’s ‘Life of Alfred the Great,’ for you, at Somerset<br/>
House, directed to the care of my friend, the secretary of<br/>
the Antiquaries’ Society; you will find it to be well worth a<br/>
careful perusal. I shall be always glad to hear from you upon<br/>
the subjects on which we have conversed, and heartily desiring<br/>
that the veneration for all that is old may grow upon you, and<br/>
that God may have you in his good keeping, I am faithfully<br/>
yours,

</p>
<p>
"&#11834;."

</p>
</div>
<p>But to return to my subject, from which I have been wandering
for the pleasure of putting in the old gentleman’s letter. The
Parson in our walks set me thinking about fifty subjects which
I never cared about before, because I could see that he was himself
deeply interested in them, and really believed whatever he said
to me. We used to get home by about twelve o’clock, and then I
would go away by myself, and think over what we had been talking
about till dinner. And, after dinner, Miss Lucy, and sometimes
Joe, would come out and walk with us till tea. Sometimes we went
to the village school, and I sat at the door and heard them teaching;
and as long as Mr. Warton was with us it was all right, but afterwards,
when he had gone, I could see that the schoolmistress, a young
woman of about thirty, sallow-faced and rather prudish, used to
look at me as if I had no business there.</p>

<p>When he left, Mr. Warton gave me a kind invitation to go and
see him in town, and added he had no doubt I should come, for
he could see I should soon want some such work as he could give
me to do.</p>

<p>After he was gone I tumbled fairly head over heels into the net
in which I suppose every man "as is a man" (as old Seeley would
say) gets enmeshed once in his life. I found it was no use to
struggle any longer, and gave myself up to the stream, with all
sails set. Now there is no easier thing than going down stream
somehow, when wind and tide are with you; but to steer so as to
make the most of wind and tide, isn’t so easy&mdash;at least I didn’t
find it so.</p>

<p>For as often as not, I think, I did the wrong thing, and provoked,
instead of pleasing her. I used to get up every morning before
six, to be ready to wish her good morning as she went out to the
dairy; but I don’t think she half liked it, for she was generally
in a very old gown tucked through her pocket holes, and pattens.
Then after breakfast I used to hanker round the kitchen, or still-room,
or wherever she might happen to be, like a Harry-long-legs round
a candle. And again in the afternoon I never could keep away,
but was at her side in the garden, or on her walks; in fact, to
get rid of me, she had fairly to go up to her room.</p>

<p>But I couldn’t help myself; I felt that, come what might, I must
be near her while I could; and on the whole, I think she was pleased,
and didn’t at all dislike seeing me reduced to this pitiful state.</p>

<p>When I was involuntarily out of her sight, I used to have a sort
of craving for poetry and often wished that I had spent a little
more time over such matters. I got Joe to lend me the key of the
cupboard where he kept his library, hoping to find something to
suit me there. But, besides a few old folios of divinity and travel,
and some cookery books, and the Farmer’s Magazine, there was nothing
but Watts’s Hymns and Pollock’s Course of Time, which I didn’t
find of any use to me.</p>

<p>Joe used to wonder at me at first, when I refused his offers
of a day’s coursing, or a ride with him to Farringdon or Didcot
markets; but he soon got used to it, and put it down to my cockney
bringing up, and congratulated himself that, at any rate, I was
pretty good company over a pipe in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The autumn days sped away all too quickly, but I made the most
of them as they passed, and over and over again I wondered whether
there were any but kind and hospitable and amusing people in the
Vale, for the longer I stayed there, the more I was astonished
at the kind courtesy of everybody I came across, from the highest
to the lowest, and I suppose everybody else would find it the
same as I did.</p>

<p>It seemed as if I were destined to leave Elm Close without a
single unkind thought of any body I had seen while there, for
even Jack made his peace with me. Only two days before my departure,
Miss Lucy gave out at breakfast that she was going to walk over
to see her uncle, and wanted to know if her mother or Joe had
any message. No, they hadn’t. But of course I managed to accompany
her.</p>

<p>When we came to her uncle’s farm, he was out, and in five minutes
Miss Lucy was away with her dear friend and cousin, one of the
girls I had seen at the pastime, and I was left to the tender
mercies of Jack. However, Jack at his own house, with no women
by to encourage him to make a fool of himself, was a very decent
fellow. He walked me about the homestead, and chatted away about
the pastime, and the accomplishments of his terrier dog, whom
he had got from the kennel of the Berkshire hounds, and whose
father used to run with them regularly. Then he began to inquire
about me in a patronizing way; how I came to know Joe, what I
was, and where I lived. And when he had satisfied his curiosity
about me, he took to talking about his cousins. Joe, I soon found
out, was his hero; and he looked forward to the time when he should
be able to breed a good horse, like Joe’s chestnut, and to go
about to all the markets and carry his head as high as any one,
as Joe could, as the height of human happiness. As to cousin Lu,
if he were looking out for any thing of the sort, there was no
girl within twenty miles that he knew of to whom she couldn’t
give a stone over any country. But she wasn’t likely to marry
any of the young men about; she was too full of fun, and laughed
at them too much. "I shouldn’t be a bit surprised now, if she
was to take to some town chap like you, after all’s said and done,"
said Jack, in conclusion, as we returned to the house.</p>

<p>My last day at Elm Close came swiftly and surely, and the sun
rose, and went pitilessly up into the heavens, and sank down behind
White Horse Hill, and the clocks went on striking one after another,
just as if it had been any other day. What a number of things
I had in my head that morning to say to all of them, and above
all to her; but one thing or another interfered, and I had said
not one quarter of them, and these not in the way I had intended,
before it was dark, and tea on the table. But I did go all round
the farm and the village, and took a last look at every field
and nook and corner where I had been so happy.</p>

<p>The old lady was unusually talkative at tea, and for some time
afterwards. The fact that I was not going to leave the house till
after midnight, and was to be at business, in London, at nine
o’clock the next morning, now that she had realized it, excited
her very much, and waked up all sorts of recollections of her
own travels; particularly how, when she was a child, she had been
a whole day getting to Reading by the stage, and how, even after
her marriage, she and father had had to sleep at Windsor, on the
occasion of their one visit to London. I was watching Miss Lucy
at her work all the time, and thought she seemed a little absent
and sorrowful, and when our eyes met every now and then, she looked
away directly. We hardly said a word, and left Joe to keep up
the talk with the old lady.</p>

<p>Before long she got tired and went off to bed, and then, I thought,
if something would only call Joe out&mdash;but nothing happened, and
so we sat on talking commonplaces, till prayer time; which, however,
Joe did consent to put off this evening, because it was my last,
till past ten o’clock. The three servants came in, and knelt down
as usual; and I, in a place where I could see her, and watch every
turn of her figure, and hear every breath she drew. I own I didn’t
listen to a word that Joe read &mdash;I couldn’t&mdash;and I don’t
believe any poor fellow in my state will ever be hardly judged,
whatever square-toed people may say, for not forcing himself to
attend when he hasn’t the power to do it. I only know that, though
I couldn’t listen to the prayers, I could and did thank God for
having brought me down there, and allowed me to see her and know
her; and prayed, as heartily as was in me to pray, that I might
never do any thing which might make me unworthy of one so bright,
and pure, and good as she.</p>

<p>And too soon Joe shut the book, and got up, and the servants
went out, and Joe dived off into the recess; and she lighted her
candle and came up to me, holding out her hand, but without saying
any thing, or looking up in my face.</p>

<p>I took the hand which she held out to me in both mine, but somehow,
when I thought it might be for the last time, I couldn’t let it
go. So I stood holding it, my heart beating so that I couldn’t
speak, and feeling very uncomfortable about the throat. She didn’t
take it away, and presently I got my voice again.</p>

<p>"Good bye, Miss Lucy," said I, "and God bless you. I can’t tell
you what my holiday at Elm Close has been to me&mdash;and I can’t find
words to thank you. I’m a poor lonely fellow, with nobody belonging
to me, and leading a slave of a life in the midst of the great
crowd, with all sorts of temptations to go wrong. You’ll let me
think of you, and Elm Close, and it will be like a little bright
window with the sun shining through into our musty clerks’ room.
I feel it will help to keep me straight for many a long day. You’ll
let me think of you now, won’t you?" said I, pressing the little
hand which I held in mine.</p>

<p>"Why, you see I can’t help it if I would," said she, looking
up with a merry light in her eyes; but she went on directly, "but,
indeed, I’m sure we shall think of you quite as often as you will
of us. Joe used to talk so often about you that I felt quite like
an old friend before we met, and now you’ve been here we shall
feel so dull without you."</p>

<p>"Now, you two! don’t stand talking there all night," said Joe,
coming out of the recess, where he had been rummaging out the
pipes and a black bottle; "come, come, kiss and part."</p>

<p>I felt the blood rush up to my face, when Joe said that, but
I opened my hands with a jerk, and let hers go, I hardly knew
why. If I hadn’t been so fond that I was afraid of her, I should
have taken Joe at his word. But I’m glad I didn’t; I’m sure I
was right, for I stole a look at her, and saw that she looked
vexed, and flushed up to her bright brown hair. Next moment she
held out her hand again, and shook mine heartily, and said, without
looking up, "Good-bye, you must come again soon," and then hurried
out of the room, and took away all the light with her. Heigh-ho!
when shall I see the light again.</p>

<p>Well, as I followed Joe into the kitchen, what between the sinking
I felt at having to leave, and the doubt whether I hadn’t made
a fool of myself at the last with Miss Lucy, I felt half mad,
and the first thing I made up my mind to was to have a good quarrel
with Joe.</p>

<p>So when he sat down on one side of the fire, and began lighting
his pipe, I kept standing looking at him, and thinking how I should
begin.</p>

<p>"There’s your pipe, Dick," said he, puffing away, "on the settle&mdash;why
don’t you sit down and light up?"</p>

<p>"I shan’t smoke with you to-night, Joe," said I, "you ought to
be ashamed of yourself!"</p>

<p>"Ashamed o’ myself," shouted Joe, staring up at me till I could
hardly keep from laughing, angry as I was; "what, in the name
o’ goodness, have I done to be ashamed of?"</p>

<p>"’Tisn’t what you’ve done, but what you’ve said."</p>

<p>"Said! what in the world have I said? Precious little I know,
for you always get all the talk to yourself."</p>

<p>"Why, what you said just now to me and Miss Lucy," said I.</p>

<p>"To you and Lu?" said he, looking puzzled; and then off he went
into one of his great laughs. "Oh, I take&mdash;well, that’s too much!
To be blown up by <em>you</em> for it! Why, if any one is to scold,
I should say it’s Lu."</p>

<p>"Do you think I like to be made the means of giving your sister
pain?" said I.</p>

<p>"There now, don’t be a fool, Dick&mdash;sit down like a good fellow,
and light your pipe. What I said don’t mean any thing down in
these parts. Well, I’m very sorry. She’ll never think twice about
it, bless you. And besides, you know, there can’t be any harm
done, for you didn’t take my advice."</p>

<p>Well, I began to get cool, and to think I might do something
better than quarrel with Joe the last night; so I took my pipe,
and filled it, and sat down opposite him, and he began to mix
two glasses of grog, twisting his face about all the time to keep
himself from laughing.</p>

<p>"Here’s your health, old fellow," said he, when he had done,
"and, mind you, we shall always be glad to see you here when you
can come; though I’m afraid the place must be terrible dull for
a Londoner."</p>

<p>"It’s the best place I’ve ever been in," said I, with a sigh.</p>

<p>This pleased Joe; and he went off about what he would find me
to do if I could come down in the winter or the spring; but I
didn’t listen much, for I was making up my mind to speak to him
about his sister, and I was afraid how he might take it.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped for a moment, and I thought, ‘now or never,’
and began.</p>

<p>"I want to ask you, Joe, is your sister engaged to any one?"</p>

<p>"Not she," said Joe, looking up rather surprised; "why, she’s
only eighteen come Lady-day!"</p>

<p>"What do you think of Mr. Warton?" said I.</p>

<p>"Our Parson!" laughed Joe; "that is a good ’un. Why he has got
a sweetheart of his own. Let alone that he’d know better than
to court a farmer’s daughter."</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" said I; "your sister isn’t like most girls, I
can tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, I tell you," said Joe, "he’s no more in love with our Lu
than you are."</p>

<p>"Then I’m over head and ears in love with her, and that’s all
about it," said I, and I looked straight across at him, though
it wasn’t an easy thing to do. But I felt I was in for it, and
I should be much better for having it over.</p>

<p>Joe gave a start, and a long whistle; and then a puff or two
at his pipe, staring at me right in the eyes till I felt my head
swimming. But I wasn’t going to look down just then; if he had
looked me right through he couldn’t have found any thing I was
ashamed of, so far as his sister was concerned, and I felt he
had a right to look as hard as he pleased, and that I was bound
not to shirk it.</p>

<p>Presently he got up, and took a turn or two up and down the kitchen.
Then he stopped&mdash;</p>

<p>"Spoke to her, yet?" said he.</p>

<p>"No," said I, "I haven’t."</p>

<p>"Come, give us your hand, Dick," said he, holding out his, and
looking quite bright again; "I knew you would be all on the square,
let be what might."</p>

<p>"Well, I won’t deceive you, Joe," said I, "I don’t deserve any
credit for that."</p>

<p>"How not?" said he.</p>

<p>"Why, I meant to have spoken to her half-a-dozen times, only
one little thing or another stopped it. But I’m very glad of it,
for I think you ought to know it first."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said he, coming and sitting down again, and staring
into the fire, "it’s a precious bad job. Let’s think a bit how
we be to tackle it."</p>

<p>"I know," said I, drawing up a bit&mdash;for I didn’t feel flattered
at this speech&mdash;"that I’m not in the same position you are in,
and that you’ve a right to look for a much richer man than I am
for your sister, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, bother that," said Joe, beginning to smoke again, and still
staring into the fire; "I wasn’t thinking of that. ’Twill be just
as bad for we, let who will take her. Here’s mother getting a’most
blind, and ’mazing forgetful-like about every thing. Who’s to
read her her chapter, or to find her spectacles? and what in the
world’s to become of the keys? I be no use to mother by myself,
you see," said Joe, "and I couldn’t abide to see the old lady
put about at her time of life; let alone how the pickling and
preserving is to go on."</p>

<p>I was very pleased and surprised to see him taking it so coolly,
and particularly that he seemed not to be objecting to me, but
only to losing his sister at all.</p>

<p>"Then there’s my dairy," said he; "that cow Daisy, as gives the
richest milk in all the Vale, nobody could ever get her to stand
quiet till Lu took to her; she’ll kick down a matter o’ six pail
o’ milk a week, I’ll warrant. And the poultry, too; there’s that
drattl’d old galleeny’ll be learning the Spanish hens to lay astray
up in the brake, as soon as ever Lu goes, and then the fox’ll
have ’em all. To think of the trouble I took to get that breed,
and not a mossel o’ use at last!"</p>

<p>"Well, but Joe," said I, "one would think we were going to be
married to-morrow, to hear you talk."</p>

<p>"Well, you want to be married, don’t you?" said he, looking up.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not directly," said I; "you see, I should like to have
a tidy place got all ready before I should think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, she mayn’t be agreeable after all," interrupted Joe, as
if a new light had suddenly struck him; and then he had a good
laugh at the thought, in which I didn’t join.</p>

<p>"Then, Joe," said I, "I think you don’t seem to mind my being
a cockney, and not a rich man?"</p>

<p>"I’d sooner have had a chap that knows a horse from a handspike,
and something about four-course," said he, "so I won’t tell a
lie about it, Dick. Put that out of the way, and I’d as lief call
you brother-in-law as any man. But you ain’t in any hurry you
said just now?"</p>

<p>"Well, no," said I; "but of course I should like to write to
your sister directly and tell her, and I hope you won’t object
to that, and won’t hinder me if you can’t help me."</p>

<p>"Don’t have any of that writing," said Joe, "’pend upon it, a
good-bred girl like Lu wouldn’t stand it."</p>

<p>"That’s all very well," said I, "but I’m going away to-night,
you know, and if I don’t write how’s she ever to know any thing
about it?"</p>

<p>"Look here," said Joe; "will you promise, Dick, to give me and
mother a year to turn round in from next Christmas&mdash;that is, supposing
Lu don’t say no?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," said I; "Christmas year is the earliest time
I could hope to be ready by."</p>

<p>"Then I’ll tell you what," said he; "Don’t you go writing to
her at all, and I’ll bring her up with me for Christmas cattle-show,
and you can get us lodgings, and show us some of the sights. You
can have it all out with her before we come home, and I shall
be by to see all fair."</p>

<p>"No, no, Joe, I couldn’t say a word with you by."</p>

<p>"I didn’t mean that I was to be in the room, you know, only if
any thing goes wrong&mdash;you understand," said Joe, looking round,
and nodding at me with a solemn face.</p>

<p>"Yes, I see," said I; "but somebody else&mdash;one of the young farmers
now, that I saw on the hill, may be stepping in before Christmas."</p>

<p>"Not they. It’s busy times with us these next two months. Besides,
I’ll look after that. Is it a bargain, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "only mind, Joe, that you look sharp meantime."</p>

<p>"All right," said he; and then fell to looking into the fire
again; and I sat thinking too, and wondering at my luck, which
I could hardly believe in yet.</p>

<p>"And now about the pot," said Joe; "suppose Lu says yes, what
have you got to keep the pot boiling?"</p>

<p>Then I told him what my salary was, and what I had saved, and
where I had put it out, and he nodded away, and seemed very well
satisfied.</p>

<p>"Well, Lu has got £500," said he, "under father’s will. Parson
and I are the executors. You must go and see the Parson when you
get back to London; he’s an out-and-outer, and worth more than
all the chaps at that jawing shop of yours put together. The money
is out at interest, all but £200, which we’ve never raised yet,
but for that matter I can pay it up whenever it’s wanted."</p>

<p>"Of course," said I, "I should wish all her fortune to be settled
on her."</p>

<p>"Yes, I forgot," said he; "I suppose there ought to be some sort
of tying-up done for the children. So I’ll go and see Lawyer Smith
about it next market-day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better wait till after Christmas," said I.</p>

<p>"Aye, aye," said he, "I forgot. We may be running a tail scent
after all. But, I say, Dick, if you get married, Lu can never
live in those dirty, dark streets, and you away all day; she’d
mope to death without a place for poultry, and a little bit of
turf to cool her feet on."</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "you see I’ve got a bit of ground under a freehold
land society, down the Great Northern line. It’s a very pretty
place, and only five minutes’ walk from a station. I could build
a house there in the spring, you know, and have the garden made."</p>

<p>"That’ll do," said he; "and if you want £100 or so, to finish
it off as should be, why you know where to come for it."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said I, "but I think I can manage it."</p>

<p>"I shall send her up those Spanish hens," said he, looking up
again presently from his pipe; "they won’t be no use here."</p>

<p>"I wish, Joe," said I, "you wouldn’t talk as if it was all quite
certain; it makes me feel uncomfortable. Your sister mayn’t like
me, after all."</p>

<p>"Makes no odds at all," said he; "if she don’t have you, there’ll
be some other chap on in no time. Once a young gal gets a follower
it’s all over, so fur as I see; though ’tisn’t always the first
as they takes up with as they sticks to for better for worse."</p>

<p>"Thank you for nothing, Master Joe," said I to myself; and I
smoked away opposite him for some time without saying a word,
thinking what a queer fellow he was, and how I had better let
things rest as they were, for I couldn’t see how to handle him
the least bit in the world; and I can’t tell whether I was most
glad or sorry, when we heard the fogger come to the kitchen door
to say the trap was all ready.</p>

<p>Joe knocked the ashes out of his last pipe, took off the last
drop out of his tumbler, and then put out his hand and gave me
one of his grips.</p>

<p>"It’s got to be done," said he, "there’s no mistake about that."</p>

<p>"What?" said I, "what’s to be done? Don’t look so solemn, Joe,
for goodness’ sake."</p>

<p>"It’s no laughing matter, mind you," said he; and he took the
candle and went off into the passage, and came back with his whip
and two top-coats. "Here, you get into that," he went on, handing
me one of them; "you’ll find the night rawish."</p>

<p>I buttoned myself into the coat, which was a white drab one,
about as thick as a deal board, with double seams and mother-of-pearl
buttons as big as cheese-plates, and followed Joe into the yard
with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>"Carpet-bag and hamper in?" said he, taking the reins.</p>

<p>"Ees, Sir, all right."</p>

<p>"Jump up, Dick."</p>

<p>I shook hands with the honest fogger, and gave him half-a-crown,
which he didn’t seem to know how to take; and then I got up by
Joe’s side, and we walked out of the yard at a foot’s pace, on
to the grass; he kept off the road to be more quiet. It was bright
moonlight, and a streak of white mist lay along the Close. I could
hear nothing but the soft crush of the wheels on the rich sward,
and the breathing of the great cows as we passed them in the mist.
But my heart was beating like a hammer, as I looked back over
my shoulder at one window of the old house, until it was hidden
behind the elm-trees; and when I jumped down to open the gate
into the road, I tore open the great coat, or I think I should
have been suffocated.</p>

<p>"It’s no laughing matter, mind you," said Joe, looking round,
after we had gone about half-a-mile along the road at a steady
trot.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said I. I felt much more like crying, and I thought
he was trying to comfort me, in his way.</p>

<p>"Come, you button up that coat again, Dick; I won’t have you
getting into the train at one in the morning with a chill on you.
I won’t turn my back," he went on, "on any man in the county at
sampling wheat, or buying a horse, or a lot of heifers, or a flock
of sheep. Besides, if a chap does get the blind side of me, it’s
maybe a ten-pound note lost, and there’s an end of it. But when
you come to choosing a missus, why, it seems like jumping in the
dark, for all as I can see. There’s nothing to sample ’em by,
and you can’t look in their mouths or feel ’em over. I don’t take
it as a man’s judgment of any account when he comes to that deal&mdash;and
then, if he does get the wrong sort!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Joe," said I, "but I’m not a bit afraid about getting
the wrong sort, if all goes well."</p>

<p>"No, but I be," said he; "why, one would think, Dick, that nobody
had to get a missus but you."</p>

<p>Well, that made me laugh out, I was so tickled to find he was
thinking of himself all the time; and for the rest of the drive
we were merry enough, for he went on talking about his own prospects
so funnily that it was impossible to keep sad or sentimental.</p>

<p>We drew up at the silent station five or six minutes nearly before
the train was due, and were received by the one solitary porter.</p>

<p>"What luggage, Sir?" said he to me, as I got down.</p>

<p>"One carpet-bag," I answered, "for Paddington."</p>

<p>"And a hamper," said Joe; "you’ll find a hamper in behind there.
And take care to keep it right side up, porter, for there are
some pots of jam in it."</p>

<p>"Who is it for?" said I; "can I look after it, and take it any
where for you?"</p>

<p>"Why, for you, of course," said Joe; "you don’t suppose the women
would have let you go back without some of their kickshaws; and
I’ve had a hare and a couple of chickens put in, and some bacon.
You must eat the hare this week, mind."</p>

<p>I was quite taken by surprise at this fresh instance of the thoughtful
kindness of my Vale friends, and wrung Joe’s hand, mumbling out
something which I meant for thanks.</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, old fellow," he said, "I’m very glad to think
you’ve found your way down at last, and now, don’t forget it;"
and he gave me a grip which nearly crashed all my knuckles into
a jelly, and was gathering up his reins to drive off.</p>

<p>"But Joe, here’s your coat," I called out, and was beginning
to take it off&mdash;"you’ve forgotten your coat."</p>

<p>"No, no," said he, "keep it on&mdash;’twill be very cold to-night,
and you’ll want it in the train. We’ll fetch it at Christmas,
and the hamper and the jam pots too, at the same time. Lu will
be sure to look after them, so mind you don’t lose ’em &mdash;Hullo!
What in the world are you cutting off the direction for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it’s nothing," said I, "but I often fancy parcels go safer
with only the railway label on them. Besides, I shall have it
in the carriage with me."</p>

<p>The fact was I had caught sight of the direction, which was in
her handwriting, and had quite forgotten Joe, as I was cutting
it off to put it in my pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Well, that’s a rum start," said Joe, "but every one has their
own notions about travelling;" and so, with a cheery good-bye
to me, off he drove along the dark road; and in another minute
the train came up, and I and my luggage were on our way to London.</p>

<p>We went away up through the cold night, eastward, towards the
great city which had been my home from childhood. I felt that
another man was journeying back from the one who had come down
a fortnight before; that he who was travelling eastward had learnt
to look beyond his own narrow cellar in the great world-city,
to believe in other things than cash payments and shorthand for
making his cellar liveable in, to have glimpses of and to sympathize
with the life of other men, in his own time, and in the old times
before him. These thoughts crowded on me, but all under the shadow
of and subordinated to the one great rising hope, in which I had
first found and felt my new life. Together they lifted up my heart
during the first stages of that night journey, and I opened the
window and leant out into the rushing night air, for the carriage
was too small for me, and my grand visions and resolves. But soon
it began to feel cold, and I shut up the window and squeezed myself
into a corner with my feet up on the opposite seat, and felt very
thankful that I had on Joe’s great coat. Then the lamp went out,
and it got colder as the dawn came on, and my visions and resolves
began to get less bright and firm. The other side of the picture
rose up in ugly colours, and I thought of the dirty dark clerks’
room, and the hours of oil-lamps and bad air, and the heartless
whirl and din of the great city. And to crown all came the more
than doubt whether my hope would not fade out and die in the recesses
of my own heart. What was I? and what my prospects, that any one
should ever give me a thought again of those whom I was so fast
leaving behind, much more that she, the flower of them all, should
single me out before all others? It was absurd, I should most
likely never see Elm Close, or the Vale, or the great mysterious
Hill again &mdash;I had better make up my mind to live the next
twenty years as I had the last. With some such meaning spoke the
doleful voices, but I was never much of a hand at looking at the
doleful side of things, and I made good strong fight on that night
ride; and took out my pipe, and lit it, and pressed my back firmer
into my corner.</p>

<p>Well, and if they don’t remember me, thought I, I can remember
them at any rate&mdash;they can’t help that; and I <em>will</em> remember
them too, and all their kind pleasant ways, and their manlike
games, and their queer songs and stories&mdash;and the queen of them
all, I can carry her in my heart, thank God for that, and every
word I ever heard her speak, and every smile I ever saw light
up her merry eyes or dimple round her mouth&mdash;and the country,
too, the fair rich Vale, and the glorious old Hill, they are mine
for ever, and all the memories of the slaying of dragons; and
of great battles with the Pagan. I wonder whether I shall ever
see the old gentleman again who conjured it up for me, and put
life into it, and made me feel as if King Alfred and his Saxons
were as near and dear to me as Sir Colin Campbell and the brave
lads in India!</p>

<p>Just then the train stopped at Reading, and the guard put his
head in to say we stopped for three minutes, and I could get a
glass of ale.</p>

<p>So I jumped out and had a glass of ale, and then another; and
stamped about the platform till the train started. And when I
got into my corner again, I was quite warm and jolly.</p>

<p>I have been always used to a good night’s rest, and I daresay
the ale made me more sleepy, and so I fell into a kind of doze
almost directly. But in my doze the same train of thought went
on, and all the people I had been living with and hearing of flitted
about in the oddest jumbles, with Elm Close and White Horse Hill
for a background. I went through the strangest scenes. One minute
I was first cousin to King Alfred, and trying to carry his messages
over the Hill to Æthelred, only Joe’s old brown horse would run
away with me along the Ridgeway; then I was the leader of the
Berkshire old gamesters, playing out the last tie with a highwayman,
for a gold-laced hat and pair of buckskin breeches; then I was
married &mdash;I needn’t say to whom&mdash;and we were keeping house
under the Hill, and waiting tea for St. George, when he should
come down from killing the Dragon. And so it went on, till at
last a mist came over the Hill, and all the figures got fainter
and fainter, and seemed to be fading away. But as they faded,
I could see one great figure coming out clearer through the mist,
which I had never noticed before. It was like a grand old man,
with white hair and mighty limbs; who looked as old as the hill
itself, but yet as if he were as young now as he ever had been,&mdash;and
at his feet were a pickaxe and spade, and at his side a scythe.
But great and solemn as it looked, I felt that the figure was
not a man, and I was angry with it,&mdash;why should it come in with
its great pitiful eyes and smile? why were my brothers and sisters,
the men and women, to fade away before it?</p>

<p>"The labour that a man doeth under the sun, it is all vanity.
Prince and peasant, the wise man and the fool, they all come to
me at last, and I garner them away, and their place knows them
no more!"&mdash;so the figure seemed to say to itself, and I felt melancholy
as I watched it sitting there at rest, playing with the fading
figures.</p>

<p>At last it placed one of the little figures on its knee, half
in mockery, as it seemed to me, and half in sorrow. But then all
changed; and the great figure began to fade, and the small man
came out clearer and clearer. And he took no heed of his great
neighbour, but rested there where he was placed; and his face
was quiet, and full of life, as he gazed steadily and earnestly
through the mist. And the other figures came flitting by again,
and chanted as they passed, "The work of one true man is greater
than all thy work. Thou hast nought but a seeming power, over
it, or over him. Every true man is greater than thee. Every true
man shall conquer more than thee; for he shall triumph over death,
and hell, and thee, oh, Time!"</p>

<p>And then I woke up, for the train stopped at the place where
the tickets are collected; and, in another five minutes, I was
in a cab, with my bag and the great basket of country treasures,
creeping along in the early November morning towards Gray’s Inn
Lane. And so ended my fortnight’s holiday.</p>

<p><em>THE SERMON WHICH THE PARSON SENT TO MR. JOSEPH HURST, OF
ELM CLOSE FARM, IN FULFILMENT OF HIS PROMISE</em>.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>LEVITICUS </em>xxiii. v. 1, 2.<br/>
&mdash;And the Lord spake unto Moses,<br/>
saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,<br/>
Concerning the feasts of the Lord which ye shall proclaim to be<br/>
holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

</p>
</div>
<p>"These are <em>my</em> feasts," said God to the nation He was
educating; "keep these feasts, for they are mine." Now, what was
the nature of these feasts, my brethren, which God called his?
The Bible leaves us in no doubt about them. They were certain
seasons set apart in every year, and at longer intervals, during
which the nation was "to rejoice before the Lord their God." Each
feast commemorated some event in the nation’s life; either a solemn
act of national worship, such as the dedication of the Temple;
or some great national deliverance, such as the Exodus commemorated
by the feast of Passover, or the defeat of Haman’s plot in the
reign of Ahasuerus, commemorated by the feast Purim; or the daily
care of God for his people, in giving them rain and fruitful seasons,
the harvest and vintage, the increase of corn, and wine, and oil,
commemorated by the feast of Pentecost.</p>

<p>They were <em>to rejoice</em> before the Lord their God at all
these feasts. With what outward actions they were to rejoice we
are not expressly told; probably it was left to each generation
to express their joy in their own way. In the case of the Passover
we know that they were to eat a lamb and unleavened bread; and
we gather, I think, from many places, that both songs and dancing
were freely used at the feasts; but further than this we do not
know the outward form of their rejoicing.</p>

<p>But we <em>do</em> know the spirit in which they were to keep
their feasts, the temper of mind in which God would have them
rejoice before Him. This is most fully proclaimed. They were to
keep alive in themselves and one another the memory of the great
deliverances and blessings, which had been, and were being wrought
for them. They were to remember that these deliverances had been
wrought for ignorant despised bondmen, that these blessings were
being poured down on a stiffnecked sinful people. Remembering
these things, they were to come to their feasts, and rejoice before
Him, with humble open hearts, thanking Him for all they possessed,
with love towards their brethren, ready to forgive debts, to help
the poor to his right, and to acknowledge and glory in the bond
which bound them all together in one nation.</p>

<p>Moreover, these feasts were to be feasts for the whole nation&mdash;for
the rich and the poor, the free man and the slave, "for thee,
and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant;" for those who are
in trouble and sorrow, as well as for the prosperous and happy;
"for the stranger, and fatherless, and widow who are within thy
gates."</p>

<p>One thing more I wish you to notice about the Jewish feasts;
they had all the same character, all were God’s feasts&mdash;not one
or two religious feasts, as we should say, and the rest national,
but all God’s feasts, and all national also. There is no hint
in the Bible of any distinction; all feasts ordained for the nation
are God’s feasts, and their feasts also.</p>

<p>Now such feasts&mdash;such rejoicings before the Lord&mdash;as these, you
can see at once must have had no slight influence on the nation
which kept them. Accordingly we find them interwoven with every
fibre of the national life: sometimes kept as God’s feasts&mdash;as
He had said they were to be kept&mdash;in humbleness and thankfulness,
in breaking bonds and forgiving debts; often, as though they had
been not his but the devil’s feasts, in persecuting prophets and
slaying righteous men; and no doubt also, as the natural consequence,
in debauchery, gluttony, and hard and usurious dealings with one
another; in oppression of man-servant and maid-servant, the widow,
the fatherless, and the stranger. But in whatever way the feasts
were kept they were always exercising a great power over generation
after generation.</p>

<p>I have begun by talking to you about the Jewish feasts, my brethren,
because I want to speak to you about our English feasts; and I
think if we understand their feasts we shall very likely learn
some lessons about our own which may do us good. Now we English,
my brethren, as a nation, have neglected this matter of feasts
too much. We have very few days on which we rejoice as a nation&mdash;in
fact the Queen’s birthday is almost our only national holiday,
and this day we keep as Englishmen, and not as Christians; while
the feasts which we keep as Christians, and not as Englishmen
(such as Christmas, and Easter, and Whitsuntide), have for this
very reason lost much of their worth for us; which we shall recover,
when we begin to keep them again, not the less as Christians,
but more as Englishmen.</p>

<p>It is my earnest hope and prayer that we may mend in this matter,
and that the great Christian festivals and the Queen’s birthday
may so become all, and more than all, to us and our children,
which the Passover and Pentecost were to the Jews. But that it
may be so, we must, in this as in all other matters, begin mending
at home, in our own families, and our own parishes. And so, my
brethren, let us to-day think about the feasts which we keep who
live in this parish, in the Vale of White Horse, who worship in
this church.</p>

<p>We all know well enough what these feasts are. First, there is
our village feast, a day set apart in every year which is specially
<em>the</em> feast day of this parish, and of all who belong to
it. Then there are our harvest homes, which are not parish but
family festivals; when the farmer and those who have worked with
him, rejoice together over the garnering in of the fruits which
God has given. Lastly, there is the feast which does not come
every year, but at longer intervals, the feast of Scouring the
White Horse, which is not the feast of one parish, but of the
whole country side.</p>

<p>A few words as to the meaning of these feasts of ours. The first
is the commemoration of the opening of this parish church, and
its dedication to the worship of God. Your harvest homes you know
the meaning of as well as I. The third is the commemoration of
a great victory, won a thousand years ago by the king of this
country against an army of heathen invaders. I remind you of these
things because they have been too much forgotten, and we never
can rightly use our feasts till we remember them better.</p>

<p>Well, now, remember what I have told you about the Jewish feasts,
or rather take your Bibles and look for yourselves, whether I
tell you the truth, when I say, that our feasts are just such
feasts as those which you read of there. The feasts of the Jews
were all either feasts in remembrance of the dedication of the
Temple, or of thanksgiving for the good gifts of God, or of commemoration
for some great national deliverance.</p>

<p>And ours are the very same. Do not think I am dealing unfairly
with you in comparing our country feasts to the great national
feasts of the Jews. It is not unfair to compare small things with
great: families, parishes, nations, must stand or fall by the
same laws. A society cannot do evil or good without reaping the
fruits thereof, whether it be very small or very great. Do not
think that I ought to speak of the great Christian festivals,
Christmas and Easter; they are better understood and kept, though
very badly as yet. I believe I am taking the right way to make
you understand and keep these world-wide Christian feasts properly
by bringing you down to these common insignificant feasts of ours,
which we, the members of this parish and congregation, have power
over; which we can make good or evil; for the use or abuse of
which we shall be called to account by God.</p>

<p>For "thus saith the Lord," to us as He said to the Jews, "these
are <em>my</em> feasts." They are his, my brethren, whether we
like it or not; they are his, though we may try to make them ours,
and so make them the devil’s. There is no neutral ground, no escape
from the hard fact. Let us see now if we cannot accept them, and
use them as his. Let us see whether they will be less or more
to us if we do so. We shall find the trial worth making, I think,
in the end.</p>

<p>They are his feasts: how, then, can we come to them as his guests&mdash;guests
who will be pleasing to him, who will use his feasts as he would
have us? For if we go to a man’s feast, the first thing we have
to do is to go in such a temper and such a dress as will make
us acceptable guests; and shall we do less as the guests of God?</p>

<p>The first thing, then, we have to consider is the temper, the
state of mind in which we should go to our feasts; and here, as
I said before, the Bible tells us all we want to know. The temper
which he required of the Jews, he will require of us. At his feasts
we have specially two things to do, to remember and to rejoice.
To remember the loving-kindness which he has shown to our fathers
and to us, in delivering us many a time from the hand of enemies
who were stronger than we; in giving us a Church, where for many
hundred years the prayers of generation after generation had gone
up to him, the God of all truth; in giving us the rich increase
of his earth, year after year. Remembering these things, then,
we are to keep the feast in humility, for our own unworthiness;
in thankfulness, for his tender care and unbounded love.</p>

<p>And we are also to rejoice before him, as members of a family,
of a parish, of a country; thinking, therefore, of others, and
not of ourselves; making up quarrels, exercising hospitality to
all according to our means, seeking to do kindnesses to all who
need them, to our debtors, to the oppressed and unfortunate amongst
us, to the widows, the fatherless, and the stranger; and in all
ways strengthening and deepening the bond which binds us to one
another, and to him.</p>

<p>This, my brethren, is the temper and state of mind which he required
of the Jews of old, and which he requires of us at these times
especially. Think what our feasts would be, what our whole lives
would be, if we tried to remember and to rejoice before the Lord
thus.</p>

<p>If we come to his feasts in this temper, my brethren, it matters
comparatively little what our outward acts of rejoicing may be.
If our hearts are right towards the Lord of the feast and to one
another, our dress and actions are surely right also, or will
soon become so. Nevertheless, this is a matter of plain, practical
importance, and I am not going to shrink from it. I wish to consider
with you, how we keep his feasts and our feasts now; whether our
method of keeping them is a true expression of that temper and
spirit in which they ought to be kept, whether any thing better
can be suggested.</p>

<p>On these points, as I said above, we have not the same help which
we had before. We know very little of how the Jews rejoiced; we
may be sure that we are not meant to copy the little we do know,
such as the eating of a lamb roasted whole with unleavened bread.
It is left for us to find out, and to do, such acts as may be
done by those who are humble, and thankful, and loving in heart,
towards God and towards each other.</p>

<p>Now there is one thing which one sees at once is wanting in our
celebration of these feasts. In the times when they were established,
it was the chief act of them, that which gave meaning to them,
and kept alive that meaning. We have neglected and disused it,
and so they have become all but meaningless to us, mere seasons
in which we are to enjoy more pleasures than in ordinary times.
This thing which we have forgotten is public fellow-worship, and
it ought to be restored as soon as possible. At the yearly meetings
of many of your benefit and other clubs, the members go all together
to the church, and there worship before attending to their business
and their pleasure. Why should not a parish do the same? I know
nothing which would so easily and so effectually raise the tone
of our village feast as the regular celebration of worship on
that day, in the Church, the dedication and consecration of which,
to the worship of God, was the cause of the holiday.</p>

<p>In one respect I believe that we are, to some extent, still keeping
the feast as we ought. I believe that on that day young people
who were born in the parish and have left it, make a point, if
possible, of getting back to see their fathers and mothers, and
friends, and to revive old associations, often bringing with them
part of their wages or some present; that many of the silly quarrels
and feuds which have arisen during the year are then set to rest;
that the residents in the parish make some exertion to welcome
their visitors hospitably, and that a general kindly feeling is
common throughout the parish. I believe that this is still so,
to some extent; but I fear that it is becoming less and less so.
My brethren, all this is right, and true, and honest; this is
the way to keep God’s feasts; you can’t go too far in this direction
(except by spending more money than you can afford, which is always
wrong). But the more you can deepen old family and local ties
on these occasions, the more you can heal up quarrels, and forgive
debts (both other debts, and money debts&mdash;remember that there
is no duty more insisted on in God’s Word than this of forgiving
money debts at these times), and exercise hospitality one to another
without grudging, the more will you be keeping God’s feasts as
he would have you keep them.</p>

<p>Then there are the sports for which prizes are given. There is
no need to specify them all, and I shall therefore only speak
of the one which is considered the most objectionable&mdash;which many
people think should be stopped altogether &mdash;I mean wrestling.
Whatever I may say on this will apply to all the rest. Now, my
brethren, are wrestling matches a proper way of keeping God’s
feasts? That is the question we have to answer.</p>

<p>The object of wrestling and of all other athletic sports is to
strengthen men’s bodies, and to teach them to use their strength
readily, to keep their tempers, to endure fatigue and pain. These
are all noble ends, my brethren. God gives us few more valuable
gifts than strength of body, and courage, and endurance&mdash;to you
labouring men they are beyond all price. We ought to cultivate
them in all right ways, for they are given us to protect the weak,
to subdue the earth, to fight for our homes and country if necessary.</p>

<p>Therefore I say that wrestling, inasmuch as it is a severe trial
of strength, temper, and endurance, may be, and ought to be, one
of many right and proper ways of rejoicing before God at these
feasts. And I say to any man who has strength for it, and can
keep his temper, and carries away no vain or proud thoughts if
he wins, and no angry or revengeful thoughts if he loses, play
by all means. No doubt there are men who ought not to play, who
ought to abstain wholly from these games, as some men ought to
abstain wholly from drink, who cannot use such things temperately,
which is the more worthy and manly way&mdash;men so constituted that
these sort of games rouse all that is brutal in their natures,
others who become braggarts and bullies from success in them.
To such men (and each of you can easily find out whether he is
such a man) I say abstain wholly.</p>

<p>Having said this, brethren, I must add that great changes should
be made in the conduct or management of these games. They should
never, on any pretence or plea whatever, be left in the hands
of publicans. You should always endeavour to play in sides (as
is, I believe, the most common custom) for your county or your
parish, and not for yourselves, as you are much more likely in
that way to play bravely and fairly. Money prizes should be if
possible avoided, for money is the lowest motive for which men
can undertake any work or any game. And lastly, every one of you
should exercise his whole strength and influence in putting down
at once all brutality and bluster and foul play.</p>

<p>As to the rest of the amusements, the visiting shows, the eating
and drinking, the dancing and music, I believe them all in themselves
to be lawful and right in the sight of God, and fit things to
do when we are rejoicing before Him. But, my brethren, I do <em>not</em>
think them lawful and right, or fit things to be done before anybody
but the devil, when they end in such scenes as, I fear&mdash;as I know&mdash;they
often do end in at our feasts. No wonder that the feasts are falling
off year by year; that they cease to interest decent and respectable
people who used to care about them, when they are deliberately
turned by some into scenes of drunkenness and profligacy, which
can scarcely be surpassed amongst savages and heathens.</p>

<p>I need not dwell on this, for you all know well enough what I
mean. You all know, too&mdash;the voice within you tells each of you
plainly enough&mdash;the moment you are going beyond the proper limits
in these matters. It is no use to lay down rules on such subjects.
Every man and every woman must be a law to themselves. One can
do safely what would ruin another. And here again I say, as I
said before, the use of these things is right and good, and what
God approves of, who in his infinite love has given us the power
of enjoying all these things, and the things themselves to enjoy&mdash;music,
and dancing, and pleasant company, and food and drink. The abuse
of them is of the devil, and destroys body and soul.</p>

<p>I beseech you all to think of what I have said, and endeavour,
each in your own way, to retain, or to bring back, if necessary,
God’s feasts into your own parishes. You, old and grown-up men
and women, by living soberly and righteously; never making mischief,
or quarrelling; treating your children with forbearance and love,
doing your own work, and helping others to do theirs. To you young
men, I say, as Solomon said, rejoice in your youth; rejoice in
your strength of body, and elasticity of spirits, and the courage
which follows from these; but remember that for these gifts you
will be judged&mdash;not condemned, mind, but judged. You will have
to show before a Judge who knoweth your inmost hearts, that you
have used these his great gifts well; that you have been pure,
and manly, and true.</p>

<p>And to you, young women, I can but say the same. Beauty, and
purity, and youth, and merry light hearts, and all the numberless
attractions which have been poured upon you, are tremendous influences
for good or evil,&mdash;gifts for which you will have to give an account.
Rejoice in them; use them freely; but avoid, as you would death
itself, all rivalry with one another, all attempts to exercise
power over men you do not care for, every light thought, and word,
and look. For the light word or look is but a step from the impure,
and the experience of the whole world is telling you</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"How mirth can into folly glide,<br/>
And folly into sin."

</p>
</div>
<p>But now to conclude. You may ask, how are we all to keep these
things in mind? how, when we are all met together to enjoy ourselves,
can we be ever on the watch for this evil, which you say is so
near us? You cannot, my brethren; but One is with you, is in you,
who can and will, if you will let him.</p>

<p>Men found this out in the old time, and have felt it and known
it ever since. Three thousand years ago this truth dawned upon
the old Psalmist, and struck him with awe. He struggled with it;
he tried to escape from it, but in vain. "Whither shall I go then,"
he says, "from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee then from thy
presence? If I go up to heaven, Thou art there: if I go down to
hell, Thou art there also. If I take the wings of the morning,
and reside in the uttermost parts of the sea; even there also
shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me."</p>

<p>Is any of us stronger or wiser than the Psalmist? Is there any
place for us to flee to, which was not open to him? My brethren,
had we not better make up our minds to accept and acknowledge
the truth, to which our own consciences bear witness; that, not
only in heaven, and in hell, and in the uttermost parts of sea
and earth, He is present, but that in the inmost recesses of our
own hearts there is no escape from his Spirit&mdash;that He is there
also, sustaining us, pleading with us, punishing us.</p>

<p>We know it by the regret we feel for time wasted and opportunities
neglected; by the loathing coming back to us, time after time,
for our every untrue or mean thought, word, or deed; by every
longing after truth, and righteousness, and purity, which stirs
our sluggish souls. By all these things, and in a thousand other
ways, we feel it, we know it.</p>

<p>Let us, then, come to our feasts owning this, and giving ourselves
up to his guidance. At first it will be hard work; our will and
spirits will be like a lump of ice in a man’s hand, which yields
but slowly to the warm pressure. But do not despair; throw yourselves
on his guidance, and he will guide you, he will hide you under
his wings, you shall be safe under his feathers, his faithfulness
and truth shall be your shield and buckler.</p>

<p>The ice will melt into water, and the water will lie there in
the hollow of the hand, moving at the slightest motion, obeying
every impulse which is given to it.</p>

<p>My brethren, the Spirit of God which is in every one of us&mdash;the
Spirit of truth and love unchangeable&mdash;will take possession of
our spirits, if we will but let him, and turn not only our feasts
into feasts of the Lord, but our whole lives into the lives of
children of God, and joint-heirs of heaven with his Son.</p>

<p><em>NOTE I</em>.</p>

<p>The earliest authentic historical notices of the White Horse
are, so far as I am aware,&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. A Cartulary of the Abbey of Abingdon, now in the British
Museum, of the time of Henry <em>II., </em>the exact date of it
being, it is believed, <em>A.D. 1171. </em>It runs as follows:
"Consuetudinis apud Anglos tunc erat, ut monachi qui vellent pecuniarum
patrimoniorum qui forent susceptibiles, ipsisque fruentes quomodo
placeret dispensarent. Unde et in Abbendonia duo, Leofricus et
Godricus Cild appellati, quorum unus Godricus, Spersholt juxta
locum qui vulgo mons Albi Equi nuncupatur, alter Leofricus Hwitceorce
super flumen Tamisie maneria sita patrimoniali jure obtinebant,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>2dly. Another Cartulary of the same Abbey, of the reign of Richard
I., which runs as follows: "Prope montem ubi ad Album Equum scanditur,
ab antiquo tempore Ecclesia ista manerium Offentum appellatum
in dominio possidet, juxta quod villa X hidarum adjacet ex jure
Ecclesiæ quam Speresholt nominavit," &amp;c.</p>

<p>3dly. An entry on the Close Rolls, 42 Ed. <em>III., </em>or <em>A.D.
1368-9:&mdash;"</em>Gerard de l’Isle tient en la vale de White Horse
one fee," &amp;c. See Archæologia, vol. xxxi. p. 290. Letter from
William Thoms, Esq. to J. Y. Ackerman, Esq., Secretary.</p>

<p>Coming down to comparatively modern times, it is curious that
so little notice should have been taken of the White Horse by
our antiquaries. Wise, in his Letter to Dr. Mead (1738), which
has been already quoted from in the text, regrets this, and then
adds: "Leland’s journey does not seem to have carried him this
way, nor does Camden here go out of the other’s track; though
he mentions, upon another occasion, and by the bye, <em>The White
Horse</em>; but in such a manner, that I could wish, for his own
sake, he had passed it over in silence with the rest. For his
own account is altogether so unbecoming so faithful and accurate
an author, insinuating to his readers that it has no existence
but in the imagination of country people. ‘<em>The Thames</em>,’
says he, ‘<em>falls into a valley, which they call</em> The Vale
of White Horse, <em>from I know not what shape of a Horse fancied
on the side of a whitish Hill</em>.’ Much nearer to the truth
is Mr. Aubrey, however wide of the mark, who, in the additions
to the Britannia, says: ‘I leave others to determine, whether
the White Horse on the Hill was made by Hengist, since the Horse
was the arms or figure in Hengist’s standard.’ The author of a
‘Tour through England,’ is a little more particular, though he
leaves us as much in the dark about the antiquity and design of
it. ‘Between this town of Marlborow and Abingdon, is the Vale
of White Horse. The inhabitants tell a great many fabulous stories
of the original of its name; but there is nothing of foundation
in them, that I could find. The whole of the story is this: Looking
south from the Vale, we see a trench cut on the side of a high,
green hill, in the shape of a horse, and not ill-shaped neither;
the trench is about a yard deep, and filled almost up with chalk,
so that at a distance you see the exact shape of a White Horse,
but so large, as to take up near an acre of ground, some say almost
two acres. From this figure, the Hill is called in our maps, White
Horse Hill, and the low or flat country under it the Vale of White
Horse.’ (See pp. 30, 31.)</p>

<p><em>NOTE II</em>.</p>

<p>Medeshamstede, however, was restored with great splendour in
the year 963. The account in the Saxon Chronicle is so illustrative
of what was going on in England at the time, that I think I may
be allowed to give it, especially as the restoration was the work
of a Vale of White Horse man, Ethelwold, Abbot of Abingdon, who
was in this year made Bishop of Winchester.</p>

<p>Edgar was king, and Dunstan Archbishop of Canterbury &mdash;Ethelwold,
after strong measures at Winchester, (where "he drove the clerks
out of the bishopric because they would not observe any rule,
and he set the monks there,") "went to the king and begged of
him that he would give him all the minsters which heathen men
had of old time broken down, because he would restore them; and
the king joyfully granted it." Then he restored Ely, and "after
that came Bishop Ethelwold to the minster which was called Medeshamstede,
which of old time had been destroyed by heathen men. He found
nothing there but old walls and wild woods. There found he hidden
in the old walls writings that Abbot Hudda had erewhile written,
how king Wulfhere and Ethelred his brother had built it, and how
they had freed it against king and against bishop, and against
all secular service, and how the pope Agatho had confirmed the
same by his rescript, and the archbishop ‘deo dedit.’ Then caused
he the minster to be built, and set there an abbot who was called
Adulf, and caused monks to be there where before was nothing.
Then came he to the king and caused him to look at the writings
which before were found, and the king answered then and said,
I, Edgar, grant and give to-day before God and before the Archbishop
Dunstan, freedom to St. Peter’s minster, from king and from bishop,
and all the villages that lie thereto, that is to say, Eastfield,
and Dodthorp, and Eye, and Paxton. And thus I free it, that no
bishop have there any command without the abbot of the minster.
And I give the town which is called Oundle, with all which thereto
lieth, that is to say, that which is called ‘the eight hundreds,’
and market and toll so freely that neither king, nor bishop, nor
earl, nor sheriff have there any command, nor any man except the
Abbot alone and him whom he thereto appointeth"&mdash;and after giving
other lands to Christ and St. Peter through the prayer of Bishop
Ethelwold, "with sack and sock, toll and team, and infangthief,"
and willing "that a market be in the same town, and no other be
between Stamford and Huntingdon," the king ends: "And I will that
all liberties and all the remissions that my predecessors have
given, that they stand, and I sign and confirm it with Christ’s
rood token. ✠" "Then Dunstan the Archbishop of Canterbury answered
and said, I grant that all the things which are here given and
spoken of, and all the things which thy predecessors and mine
have conceded, those will I that they stand; and whosoever this
breaketh, then give I him the curse of God, and of all saints,
and of all ordained heads, and of myself, unless he come to repentance.
And I give in acknowledgment to St. Peter my mass-hackel, and
my stole, and my reef, for the service of Christ." "I, Oswald,
Archbishop of York, assent to all these words, by the holy rood
which Christ suffered on. ✠" "I, Ethelwold, bless all who shall
observe this, and I excommunicate all who shall break this, unless
he come to repentance." So the minster at Medeshamstede was set
up again under Adulf, who bought lands and greatly enriched it,
till Oswald died, and he was chosen Archbishop of York, and was
succeeded as abbot by Kenulph, who "first made the wall about
the minster; then gave he that to name Peterborough which was
before called Medeshamstede."&mdash;<em>Saxon Chronicle</em> <em>A.D.
963</em>.</p>

<p><em>NOTE III</em>.</p>

<p><em>SITE OF THE BATTLE OF ASHDOWN</em>.</p>

<p>There are four spots in Berkshire which claim the honour of being
the Œscendun of the chroniclers, where Æthelred and Alfred gained
their great victory; they are Ilsley, Ashamstead, Aston in the
parish of Bluberry, and Ashdown, close to White Horse Hill. Now
it seems clear that Ashdown was, in Saxon times, the name of a
district stretching over a considerable portion of the Berkshire
chalk range, and it is quite possible that all of the above sites
may have been included in that district; therefore, I do not insist
much upon the name, though whatever weight is to be attached to
it, must tell in favour of the latter site, that of Ashdown. Let
us, however, consider the other qualifications of the rival sites.</p>

<p>That of Ilsley is supported, so far as I know, only by Hewitt
in his antiquities of the Hundred of Compton (1844); and his argument
rests chiefly on the fitness of the ground for the scene of a
great battle. He tells us that the detachments of three Waterloo
regiments, marching through Ilsley in 1816, when they came to
the spot, stopped and called out, "Waterloo! Waterloo!" to one
another. He also states that the name Ilsley is, in fact, "Hilde
læg," the field of battle; but as he has no tradition in his favour,
and cannot, so far as I know, point to any remains in the neighbourhood
in support of his theory, I think his case must fail, and only
mention it to show that I have not overlooked the claim.</p>

<p>Ashamstead, situate five miles to the southeast of Ilsley, is
named by the Lysons in their topographical account of Berkshire
as the probable site of the battle, but they give no reasons,
and are unsupported by tradition or remains.</p>

<p>Aston has a stronger case. It is situate between Wallingford
and Ilsley. The range of chalk hills rises just above it, and
one detached hill is here thrown out into the vale, on which are
still visible considerable earthworks. There is a chapel called
Thorn Chapel on the eastern slope of this hill, and I am told
there is a tradition that this chapel was built on the spot where
some Saxon king heard mass on the morning of a battle. It is suggested
by Mr. Lousley and others, that the Saxons occupied this outlying
hill, the Danes the opposite range; and that the battle was fought
in the valley between, where, when the road was recently altered,
a number of bones were found, apparently thrown in together without
care, as would be the case after a battle. There are, however,
no regular barrows or other remains. Bishop Gibson is in favour
of this spot, on account, as it would seem, of a passage in the
Saxon Chronicle for the year 1006, which runs as follows: "They"
(the Danes) "destroyed Wallingford, and passed a night at Cholsey."
Then they "turned <em>along Ashdown</em> to Cwichelmes Low."</p>

<p>The bishop says, that Cwichelmes Low (the <em>low</em> or hill
of King Cwichelm, who reigned in these parts, and died in the
year 636 <em>A.D.) </em>is Cuckhamsley Hill, or Scuchamore Knob,
as it is generally called; a high hill in the same chalk range,
about ten miles east of White Horse Hill; and he argues that,
as the Danes went <em>from</em> Wallingford, <em>by</em> Ashdown,
<em>to</em> Cwichelmes Low, we must look for Ashdown between Wallingford
and Cuckhamsley Hill. Now Aston lies directly between the two,
therefore Aston is Ashdown, and the site of the battle. But the
place now called Ashdown is on the further side of Cuckhamsley
Hill from Wallingford&mdash;therefore the Danes could not have passed
it in getting from Wallingford to Cuckhamsley Hill&mdash;therefore
the modern Ashdown cannot be the site of the battle.</p>

<p>To this I answer, <em>First</em>, the Bishop <em>assumes</em>
that Cwichelmes Low is Cuckhamsley Hill, without giving any reason.</p>

<p><em>Secondly</em>, assuming Cwichelmes Low and Cuckhamsley Hill
to be identical; yet, as Ashdown was clearly a large tract of
country, the Danes might go from Wallingford, <em>along</em> a
part of it, <em>to</em> Cwichelmes Low without passing the battle-field.</p>

<p><em>Thirdly</em>, the name Aston is written "Estone" in Domesday
Book; meaning "East town," or enclosure, and not "Mons fraxini,"
the "Hill of the Ash-tree."</p>

<p><em>Fourthly</em>, Æthelred and Alfred would have kept to the
hills in their retreat, and never have allowed the Danes to push
them out into the Thames-valley, where the Pagan cavalry would
have been invaluable; but this must have been the case, if we
suppose Aston to be the site of the battle. Lastly, all the above
sites are too near to Reading, the farthest being only sixteen
miles from that town. But Æthelred and Alfred had been retreating
three days, and would therefore much more probably be found at
Ashdown by White Horse Hill, which is ten miles farther along
the range of hills.</p>

<p>Ashdown, the remaining site, and the one which I believe to be
the true one, is the down which surrounds White Horse Hill, in
the parish of Uffington. On the highest point of the hill, which
is 893 feet above the level of the sea, stands Uffington Castle,
a plain of more than eight acres in extent, surrounded by earthworks,
and a single deep ditch, which Camden, and other high authorities,
say are Danish.</p>

<p>There is another camp, with earthworks, called Hardwell Camp,
about a mile <em>W.N.W. </em>of Uffington Castle, and a third
smaller circular camp, called King Alfred’s camp, about a mile
to the <em>S.W., </em>which may still be made out, close to the
wall of Ashdown Park, Lord Craven’s seat, although Aubrey says,
that in his time the works were "almost quite defaced, by digging
for the Sarsden stones to build my Lord Craven’s house in the
Park." Wise suggests that the Danes held Uffington Castle; that
Æthelred was in Hardwell-camp, and Alfred in Alfred’s camp. A
mile and a half to the eastward, in which direction the battle
must have rolled, as the Saxons slowly gained the day, is a place
called the Seven Barrows, where are seven circular burial-mounds,
and several other large irregularly-shaped mounds, full of bones;
the light soil which covers the chalk is actually black around
them. The site agrees in all points with the description in the
chroniclers; it is the proper distance from Reading; the name
is the one used by the chroniclers,&mdash;"Ash-down," "Mons Fraxini,"
"Æscendun;" it is likely that Æthelred would have fought somewhere
hereabouts to protect Wantage, a royal burg, and his birthplace,
which would have been otherwise at the mercy of the enemy; and
lastly, there&mdash;and not at Cuckhamsley Hill, or elsewhere&mdash;is carved
the White Horse, which has been from time immemorial held to be
a monument of the great victory of Ashdown. For the above reasons,
I think we are justified in claiming this as the site of the battle.</p>

<p><em>NOTE IV</em>.</p>

<p><em>WAYLAND SMITH’S CAVE</em>.</p>

<p>Wise (see p. 35) says he thinks he has discovered the place of
burial of King Basreg, Bagseeg (or whatever his name might be,
for it is given in seven or eight different ways in the chroniclers),
in Wayland Smith’s cave, which place he describes as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The place is distinguished by a parcel of stones set on edge,
and enclosing a piece of ground raised a few feet above the common
level, which every one knows was the custom of the Danes, as well
as of some other northern nations. And Wormius observes, that
if any Danish chief was slain in a foreign country, they took
care to bury him as pompously as if he had died in his own. Mr.
Aubrey’s account of it is this: ‘About a mile [or less] from the
Hill [White Horse Hill] there are a great many large stones, which,
though very confused, must yet be laid there on purpose. Some
of them are placed edgewise, but the rest are so disorderly that
one would imagine they were tumbled out of a cart.’ The disorder
which Mr. Aubrey speaks of is occasioned by the people having
thrown down some of the stones (for they all seem originally to
have been set on edge), and broken them to pieces to mend their
highways. Those that are left enclose a piece of ground of an
irregular figure at present, but which formerly might have been
an oblong square, extending only north and south.</p>

<p>"On the east side of the southern extremity stand three squarish
flat stones of about four or five feet over each way, set on edge,
and supporting a fourth of much larger dimensions, lying flat
upon them. These altogether form a cavern or sheltering-place,
resembling pretty exactly those described by Wormius, Bartholine,
and others, except in the dimensions of the stones; for whereas
this may shelter only ten or a dozen sheep from a storm, Wormius
mentions one in Denmark that would shelter a hundred.</p>

<p>"I know of no other monument of this sort in England; but in
Wales and the Isle of Anglesey there are several not unlike it,
called by the natives <em>Cromlechs</em>. The Isle of Anglesey
having been the chief seat of the Druids, induced its learned
antiquary to ascribe them to the ancient Britons; an assertion
that I will not take upon me to contradict, but shall only at
this time observe, that I find sufficient authorities to convince
me that ours must be Danish.</p>

<p>"Whether this remarkable piece of antiquity ever bore the name
of the person here buried is not now to be learned, the true meaning
of it being long since lost in ignorance and fable. All the account
which the country people are able to give of it is, ‘At this place
lived formerly an invisible smith; and if a traveller’s horse
had lost a shoe upon the road, he had no more to do than to bring
the horse to this place, with a piece of money, and leaving both
there for some little time, he might come again and find the money
gone, but the horse new shod.’ The stones standing upon the <em>Rudgeway</em>,
as it is called (which was the situation that they chose for burial
monuments), I suppose gave occasion to the whole being called
Wayland Smith, which is the name it was always known by to the
country people.</p>

<p>"An English antiquary might find business enough who should attempt
to unriddle all the fabulous traditions of the vulgar, which ascribe
these works of unknown antiquity to demons and invisible powers.</p>

<p>"Leaving, therefore, the story of the invisible smith to be discussed
by those who have more leisure, I only remark, that these stones
are, according to the best Danish antiquaries, a burial altar;
that their being raised in the midst of a plain field, near the
great road, seems to indicate some person there slain and buried,
and that this person was probably a chief or king; there being
no monument of this sort near that place, perhaps not in England,
beside." (See pp. 35, 36, 37.)</p>

<p>I have given Wise’s statement of his own case, but the better
opinion amongst antiquaries seems to be that he is wrong, and
that the cromlech, called Wayland Smith’s Cave, is of much earlier
date than 871 <em>A.D</em>.</p>

<p>I insert here the note from Kenilworth (note B, p. 218) in which
Sir Walter Scott mentions Wayland Smith’s Cave:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The great defeat given by Alfred to the Danish invaders, is
said by Mr. Gough to have taken place near Ashdown in Berkshire.
The burial-place of Bœreg, the Danish chief who was slain in this
fight, is distinguished by a parcel of stones, less than a mile
from the hill, set on edge, enclosing a piece of ground somewhat
raised. On the east side of the southern extremity, stand three
squarish flat stones, of about four or five feet over either way,
supporting a fourth, and now called by the vulgar Wayland Smith,
from an idle tradition about an invisible smith replacing lost
horseshoes there." (Gough’s edition of Camden’s <em>Britannica</em>.
Vol. I. p. 221.)</p>

<p>"The popular belief still retains memory of this wild legend,
which, connected as it is with the site of a Danish sepulchre,
may have arisen from some legend concerning the northern Duergar,
who resided in the rocks, and were cunning workers in steel and
iron. It was believed that Wayland Smith’s fee was sixpence, and
that, unlike other workmen, he was offended if more was offered.
Of late his offices have been again called to memory; but fiction
has in this, as in other cases, taken the liberty to pillage the
stores of oral tradition. This monument must be very ancient,
for it has been kindly pointed out to me that it is referred to
in an ancient Saxon charter as a landmark. The monument has been
of late cleared out, and made considerably more conspicuous."</p>

<p>It will be seen from this that Sir Walter assumes the view of
Wise to be correct, but he never saw the place.</p>

<p><em>NOTE V</em>.</p>

<p>As an illustration of one of the methods by which traditions
are kept up in the country, I insert some verses written by Job
Cork, an Uffington man of two generations back, who was a shepherd
on White Horse Hill for fifty years.</p>

A watching of his fleecy herd,<br/>
With threadbare coat and downcast eye,<br/>
To which the stranger did draw nigh.

</p>
<p>
"‘O noble shepherd, can you tell<br/>
How long you kept sheep on this hill?’<br/>
‘Zeven yeur in Zundays I have been<br/>
A shepherd on this hill so green.’

</p>
<p>
"‘That is a long time, I must own,<br/>
You have kept sheep upon this down;<br/>
I think that you must have been told<br/>
Of things that have been done of old.’

</p>
<p>
"‘Ah, Zur, I can remember well<br/>
The stories the old voke do tell&mdash;<br/>
Upon this hill which here is seen<br/>
Many a battle there have been.

</p>
<p>
"‘If it is true as I heard zay,<br/>
King Gaarge did here the dragon slay,<br/>
And down below on yonder hill<br/>
They buried him as I heard tell.

</p>
<p>
"‘If you along the Rudgeway go,<br/>
About a mile for aught I know,<br/>
There Wayland’s Cave then you may see<br/>
Surrounded by a group of trees.

</p>
<p>
"‘They say that in this cave did dwell<br/>
A smith that was invisible;<br/>
At last he was found out, they say,<br/>
He blew up the place and vlod away.

</p>
<p>
"‘To Devonshire then he did go,<br/>
Full of sorrow, grief, and woe,<br/>
Never to return again,<br/>
So here I’ll add the shepherd’s name&mdash;

</p>
<p>
"<em>JOB CORK</em>.’"

</p>
</div>
<p>There is no merit in the lines beyond quaintness; but they are
written in the sort of jingle which the poor remember; they have
lived for fifty years and more, and will probably, in quiet corners
of the Vale, outlive the productions of much more celebrated versemakers
than Job Cork, though probably they were never reduced into writing
until written out at my request.</p>

<p>Job Cork was a village humorist, and stories are still told of
his sayings, some of which have a good deal of fun in them; I
give one example in the exact words in which it was told to me:&mdash;</p>

<p>"One night as Job Cork came off the downs, drough-wet to his
very skin, it happened his wife had been a baking. So, when he
went to bed, his wife took his leather breeches, and put ’em in
the oven to dry ’em. When he woke in the morning he began to feel
about for his thengs, and he called out, and zed, ‘Betty, where
be mee thengs?’ ‘In the oven,’ zed his wife. Zo he looked in the
oven and found his leather breeches all cockled up together like
a piece of parchment, and he bawled out, ‘O Lard! O Lard! what
be I to do? Was ever man plagued as I be?’ ‘Patience, Job, patience,
Job,’ zed his wife; ‘remember thy old namesake, how he was plagued.’
‘Ah!’ zed the old man, ‘’a was plagued surely; but his wife never
baked his breeches.’"</p>

<p>Other shepherds of the Hill have been poets in a rough sort of
way. I add one of their home-made songs, as I am anxious to uphold
the credit of my countrymen as a tuneful race.</p>

"Come, all you shepherds as minds for to be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You must have a gallant heart,<br/>
You must not be down-hearted,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You must a-bear the smart;<br/>
You must a-bear the smart, my boys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let it hail or rain or snow,<br/>
For there is no ale to be had on the Hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the wintry wind doth blow.

</p>
<p>
"When I kept sheep on White Horse Hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart began to ache,<br/>
My old ewes all hung down their heads,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my lambs began to bleat.<br/>
Then I cheered up with courage bold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the Hill did go,<br/>
For there is no ale to be had on the Hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wintry wind doth blow.

</p>
<p>
"I drive my sheep into the fold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep them safe all night,<br/>
For drinking of good ale, my boys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my heart’s delight.<br/>
I drove my sheep into the fold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And homeward I did go,<br/>
For there is no ale to be had on the Hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wintry wind doth blow.

</p>
<p>
"We shepherds are the liveliest lads<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As ever trod English ground,<br/>
If we drops into an ale-house<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We values not a crownd.<br/>
We values not a crownd, my boys,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ll pay before we go,<br/>
For there is no ale to be had on the Hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When the wintry wind doth blow."
