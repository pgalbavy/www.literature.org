<P>The next morning, after breakfast, Tom, East, and Gower met as
usual to learn their second lesson together.  Tom had been
considering how to break his proposal of giving up the crib to
the others, and having found no better way (as indeed none
better can ever be found by man or boy), told them simply what
had happened; how he had been to see Arthur, who had talked to
him upon the subject, and what he had said, and for his part he
had made up his mind, and wasn't going to use cribs any more;
and not being quite sure of his ground, took the high and
pathetic tone, and was proceeding to say &quot;how that, having
learnt his lessons with them for so many years, it would grieve
him much to put an end to the arrangement, and he hoped, at any
rate, that if they wouldn't go on with him, they should still be
just as good friends, and respect one another's motives; but - &quot;</P>
<P>Here the other boys, who had been listening with open eyes and
ears, burst in, -</P>
<P>&quot;Stuff and nonsense!&quot; cried Gower.  &quot;Here, East, get down the
crib and find the place.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;O Tommy, Tommy!&quot; said East, proceeding to do as he was bidden,
&quot;that it should ever have come to this!  I knew Arthur'd be the
ruin of you some day, and you of me.  And now the time's come.&quot;
And he made a doleful face.</P>
<P>&quot;I don't know about ruin,&quot; answered Tom; &quot;I know that you and I
would have had the sack long ago if it hadn't been for him.  And
you know it as well as I.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, we were in a baddish way before he came, I own; but this
new crotchet of his is past a joke.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let's give it a trial, Harry; come.  You know how often he has
been right and we wrong.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, don't you two be jawing away about young Square-toes,&quot;
struck in Gower.  &quot;He's no end of a sucking wiseacre, I dare
say; but we've no time to lose, and I've got the fives court at
half-past nine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say, Gower,&quot; said Tom appealingly, &quot;be a good fellow, and
let's try if we can't get on without the crib.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! in this chorus?  Why, we shan't get through ten lines.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say, Tom,&quot; cried East, having hit on a new idea, &quot;don't you
remember, when we were in the upper fourth, and old Momus caught
me construing off the leaf of a crib which I'd torn out and put
in my book, and which would float out on to the floor, he sent
me up to be flogged for it?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I remember it very well.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, the Doctor, after he'd flogged me, told me himself that
he didn't flog me for using a translation, but for taking it in
to lesson, and using it there when I hadn't learnt a word before
I came in.  He said there was no harm in using a translation to
get a clue to hard passages, if you tried all you could first to
make them out without.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did he, though?&quot; said Tom; &quot;then Arthur must be wrong,&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course he is,&quot; said Gower - &quot;the little prig.  We'll only
use the crib when we can't construe without it.  - Go ahead,
East.&quot;</P>
<P>And on this agreement they started - Tom, satisfied with having
made his confession, and not sorry to have a locus penitentiae,
and not to be deprived altogether of the use of his old and
faithful friend.</P>
<P>The boys went on as usual, each taking a sentence in turn, and
the crib being handed to the one whose turn it was to construe.
Of course Tom couldn't object to this, as, was it not simply
lying there to be appealed to in case the sentence should prove
too hard altogether for the construer?  But it must be owned
that Gower and East did not make very tremendous exertions to
conquer their sentences before having recourse to its help. Tom,
however, with the most heroic virtue and gallantry, rushed into
his sentence, searching in a high-minded manner for nominative
and verb, and turning over his dictionary frantically for the
first hard word that stopped him.  But in the meantime Gower,
who was bent on getting to fives, would peep quietly into the
crib, and then suggest, &quot;Don't you think this is the meaning?&quot;
&quot;I think you must take it this way, Brown.&quot;  And as Tom didn't
see his way to not profiting by these suggestions, the lesson
went on about as quickly as usual, and Gower was able to start
for the fives court within five minutes of the half-hour.</P>
<P>When Tom and East were left face to face, they looked at one
another for a minute, Tom puzzled, and East chokefull of fun,
and then burst into a roar of laughter.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Tom,&quot; said East, recovering himself, &quot;I don t see any
objection to the new way.  It's about as good as the old one, I
think, besides the advantage it gives one of feeling virtuous,
and looking down on one's neighbours.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom shoved his hand into his back hair.  &quot;I ain't so sure,&quot; said
he; &quot;you two fellows carried me off my legs.  I don't think we
really tried one sentence fairly.  Are you sure you remember
what the Doctor said to you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.  And I'll swear I couldn't make out one of my sentences
to-day - no, nor ever could.  I really don't remember,&quot; said
East, speaking slowly and impressively, &quot;to have come across one
Latin or Greek sentence this half that I could go and construe
by the light of nature.  Whereby I am sure Providence intended
cribs to be used.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The thing to find out,&quot; said Tom meditatively, &quot;is how long one
ought to grind at a sentence without looking at the crib.  Now I
think if one fairly looks out all the words one don't know, and
then can't hit it, that's enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To be sure, Tommy,&quot; said East demurely, but with a merry
twinkle in his eye.  &quot;Your new doctrine too, old fellow,&quot; added
he, &quot;when one comes to think of it, is a cutting at the root of
all school morality.  You'll take away mutual help, brotherly
love, or, in the vulgar tongue, giving construes, which I hold
to be one of our highest virtues.  For how can you distinguish
between getting a construe from another boy and using a crib?
Hang it, Tom, if you're going to deprive all our school-fellows
of the chance of exercising Christian benevolence and being good
Samaritans, I shall cut the concern.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish you wouldn't joke about it, Harry; it's hard enough to
see one's way - a precious sight harder than I thought last
night.  But I suppose there's a use and an abuse of both, and
one'll get straight enough somehow.  But you can't make out,
anyhow, that one has a right to use old vulgus-books and copy-
books.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo, more heresy!  How fast a fellow goes downhill when he
once gets his head before his legs.  Listen to me, Tom. Not use
old vulgus-books!  Why, you Goth, ain't we to take the benefit
of the wisdom and admire and use the work of past generations?
Not use old copy-books!  Why, you might as well say we ought to
pull down Westminster Abbey, and put up a go-to-meeting shop
with churchwarden windows; or never read Shakespeare, but only
Sheridan Knowles.  Think of all the work and labour that our
predecessors have bestowed on these very books; and are we to
make their work of no value?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I say, Harry, please don't chaff; I'm really serious.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And then, is it not our duty to consult the pleasure of others
rather than our own, and above all, that of our masters?  Fancy,
then, the difference to them in looking over a vulgus which has
been carefully touched and retouched by themselves and others,
and which must bring them a sort of dreamy pleasure, as if
they'd met the thought or expression of it somewhere or another
&mdash; before they were born perhaps - and that of cutting up, and
making picture-frames round all your and my false quantities,
and other monstrosities.  Why, Tom, you wouldn't be so cruel as
never to let old Momus hum over the 'O genus humanum' again, and
then look up doubtingly through his spectacles, and end by
smiling and giving three extra marks for it - just for old
sake's sake, I suppose.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; said Tom, getting up in something as like a huff as he
was capable of, &quot;it's deuced hard that when a fellow's really
trying to do what he ought, his best friends'll do nothing but
chaff him and try to put him down.&quot;  And he stuck his books
under his arm and his hat on his head, preparatory to rushing
out into the quadrangle, to testify with his own soul of the
faithlessness of friendships.</P>
<P>&quot;Now don't be an ass, Tom,&quot; said East, catching hold of him;
&quot;you know me well enough by this time; my bark's worse than my
bite.  You can't expect to ride your new crotchet without
anybody's trying to stick a nettle under his tail and make him
kick you off - especially as we shall all have to go on foot
still.  But now sit down, and let's go over it again.  I'll be
as serious as a judge.&quot;</P>
<P>Then Tom sat himself down on the table, and waxed eloquent about
all the righteousnesses and advantages of the new plan, as was
his wont whenever he took up anything, going into it as if his
life depended upon it, and sparing no abuse which he could think
of, of the opposite method, which he denounced as ungentlemanly,
cowardly, mean, lying, and no one knows what besides.  &quot;Very
cool of Tom,&quot; as East thought, but didn't say, &quot;seeing as how he
only came out of Egypt himself last night at bedtime.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Tom,&quot; said he at last, &quot;you see, when you and I came to
school there were none of these sort of notions.  You may be
right - I dare say you are.  Only what one has always felt about
the masters is, that it's a fair trial of skill and last between
us and them - like a match at football or a battle.  We're
natural enemies in school - that's the fact.  We've got to learn
so much Latin and Greek, and do so many verses, and they've got
to see that we do it.  If we can slip the collar and do so much
less without getting caught, that's one to us.  If they can get
more out of us, or catch us shirking, that's one to them.  All's
fair in war but lying.  If I run my luck against theirs, and go
into school without looking at my lessons, and don't get called
up, why am I a snob or a sneak?  I don't tell the master I've
learnt it.  He's got to find out whether I have or not.  What's
he paid for?  If he calls me up and I get floored, he makes me
write it out in Greek and English.  Very good.  He's caught me,
and I don't grumble.  I grant you, if I go and snivel to him,
and tell him I've really tried to learn it, but found it so hard
without a translation, or say I've had a toothache, or any
humbug of that kind, I'm a snob.  That's my school morality;
it's served me, and you too, Tom, for the matter of that, these
five years.  And it's all clear and fair, no mistake about it.
We understand it, and they understand it, and I don't know what
we're to come to with any other.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom looked at him pleased and a little puzzled.  He had never
heard East speak his mind seriously before, and couldn't help
feeling how completely he had hit his own theory and practice up
to that time.</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, old fellow,&quot; said he.  &quot;You're a good old brick to
be serious, and not put out with me.  I said more than I meant,
I dare say, only you see I know I'm right.  Whatever you and
Gower and the rest do, I shall hold on.  I must.  And as it's
all new and an uphill game, you see, one must hit hard and hold
on tight at first.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Very good,&quot; said East; &quot;hold on and hit away, only don't hit
under the line.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But I must bring you over, Harry, or I shan't be comfortable.
Now, I'll allow all you've said.  We've always been honourable
enemies with the masters.  We found a state of war when we came,
and went into it of course.  Only don't you think things are
altered a good deal?  I don't feel as I used to the masters.
They seem to me to treat one quite differently.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, perhaps they do,&quot; said East; &quot;there's a new set you see,
mostly, who don't feel sure of themselves yet.  They don't want
to fight till they know the ground.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think it's only that,&quot; said Tom.  &quot;And then the Doctor,
he does treat one so openly, and like a gentleman, and as if one
was working with him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, so he does,&quot; said East; &quot;he's a splendid fellow, and when
I get into the sixth I shall act accordingly.  Only you know he
has nothing to do with our lessons now, except examining us.  I
say, though,&quot; looking at his watch, &quot;it's just the quarter.
Come along.&quot;</P>
<P>As they walked out they got a message, to say that Arthur was
just starting, and would like to say goodbye.  So they went down
to the private entrance of the School-house, and found an open
carriage, with Arthur propped up with pillows in it, looking
already better, Tom thought.</P>
<P>They jumped up on to the steps to shake hands with him, and Tom
mumbled thanks for the presents he had found in his study, and
looked round anxiously for Arthur's mother.</P>
<P>East, who had fallen back into his usual humour, looked quaintly
at Arthur, and said, -</P>
<P>&quot;So you've been at it again, through that hot-headed convert of
yours there.  He's been making our lives a burden to us all the
morning about using cribs.  I shall get floored to a certainty
at second lesson, if I'm called up.&quot;</P>
<P>Arthur blushed and looked down.  Tom struck in, -</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, it's all right.  He's converted already; he always comes
through the mud after us, grumbling and sputtering.&quot;</P>
<P>The clock struck, and they had to go off to school, wishing
Arthur a pleasant holiday, Tom, lingering behind a moment to
send his thanks and love to Arthur's mother.</P>
<P>Tom renewed the discussion after second lesson, and succeeded so
far as to get East to promise to give the new plan a fair trial.</P>
<P>Encouraged by his success, in the evening, when they were
sitting alone in the large study, where East lived now almost,
&quot;vice Arthur on leave,&quot; after examining the new fishing-rod,
which both pronounced to be the genuine article (&quot;play enough to
throw a midge tied on a single hair against the wind, and
strength enough to hold a grampus&quot;), they naturally began
talking about Arthur.  Tom, who was still bubbling over with
last night's scene and all the thoughts of the last week, and
wanting to clinch and fix the whole in his own mind, which he
could never do without first going through the process of
belabouring somebody else with it all, suddenly rushed into the
subject of Arthur's illness, and what he had said about death.</P>
<P>East had given him the desired opening.  After a serio-comic
grumble, &quot;that life wasn't worth having, now they were tied to a
young beggar who was always 'raising his standard;' and that he,
East, was like a prophet's donkey, who was obliged to struggle
on after the donkey-man who went after the prophet; that he had
none of the pleasure of starting the new crotchets, and didn't
half understand them, but had to take the kicks and carry the
luggage as if he had all the fun,&quot; he threw his legs up on to
the sofa, and put his hands behind his head, and said, -</P>
<P>&quot;Well, after all, he's the most wonderful little fellow I ever
came across.  There ain't such a meek, humble boy in the school.
Hanged if I don't think now, really, Tom, that he believes
himself a much worse fellow than you or I, and that he don't
think he has more influence in the house than Dot Bowles, who
came last quarter, and isn't ten yet.  But he turns you and me
round his little finger, old boy - there's no mistake about
that.&quot;  And East nodded at Tom sagaciously.</P>
<P>&quot;Now or never!&quot; thought Tom; so, shutting his eyes and hardening
his heart, he went straight at it, repeating all that Arthur had
said, as near as he could remember it, in the very words, and
all he had himself thought.  The life seemed to ooze out of it
as he went on, and several times he felt inclined to stop, give
it all up, and change the subject.  But somehow he was borne on;
he had a necessity upon him to speak it all out, and did so.  At
the end he looked at East with some anxiety, and was delighted
to see that that young gentleman was thoughtful and attentive.
The fact is, that in the stage of his inner life at which Tom
had lately arrived, his intimacy with and friendship for East
could not have lasted if he had not made him aware of, and a
sharer in, the thoughts that were beginning to exercise him.
Nor indeed could the friendship have lasted if East had shown no
sympathy with these thoughts; so that it was a great relief to
have unbosomed himself, and to have found that his friend could
listen.</P>
<P>Tom had always had a sort of instinct that East's levity was
only skin-deep, and this instinct was a true one.  East had no
want of reverence for anything he felt to be real; but his was
one of those natures that burst into what is generally called
recklessness and impiety the moment they feel that anything is
being poured upon them for their good which does not come home
to their inborn sense of right, or which appeals to anything
like self-interest in them.  Daring and honest by nature, and
outspoken to an extent which alarmed all respectabilities, with
a constant fund of animal health and spirits which he did not
feel bound to curb in any way, he had gained for himself with
the steady part of the school (including as well those who
wished to appear steady as those who really were so) the
character of a boy with whom it would be dangerous to be
intimate; while his own hatred of everything cruel, or
underhand, or false, and his hearty respect for what he would
see to be good and true, kept off the rest.</P>
<P>Tom, besides being very like East in many points of character,
had largely developed in his composition the capacity for taking
the weakest side.  This is not putting it strongly enough:  it
was a necessity with him; he couldn't help it any more than he
could eating or drinking.  He could never play on the strongest
side with any heart at football or cricket, and was sure to make
friends with any boy who was unpopular, or down on his luck.</P>
<P>Now, though East was not what is generally called unpopular, Tom
felt more and more every day, as their characters developed,
that he stood alone, and did not make friends among their
contemporaries, and therefore sought him out.  Tom was himself
much more popular, for his power of detecting humbug was much
less acute, and his instincts were much more sociable.  He was
at this period of his life, too, largely given to taking people
for what they gave themselves out to be; but his singleness of
heart, fearlessness, and honesty were just what East
appreciated, and thus the two had been drawn into great
intimacy.</P>
<P>This intimacy had not been interrupted by Tom's guardianship of
Arthur.</P>
<P>East had often, as has been said, joined them in reading the
Bible; but their discussions had almost always turned upon the
characters of the men and women of whom they read, and not
become personal to themselves.  In fact, the two had shrunk from
personal religious discussion, not knowing how it might end, and
fearful of risking a friendship very dear to both, and which
they felt somehow, without quite knowing why, would never be the
same, but either tenfold stronger or sapped at its foundation,
after such a communing together.</P>
<P>What a bother all this explaining is!  I wish we could get on
without it.  But we can't.  However, you'll all find, if you
haven't found it out already, that a time comes in every human
friendship when you must go down into the depths of yourself,
and lay bare what is there to your friend, and wait in fear for
his answer.  A few moments may do it; and it may be (most likely
will be, as you are English boys) that you will never do it but
once.  But done it must be, if the friendship is to be worth the
name.  You must find what is there, at the very root and bottom
of one another's hearts; and if you are at one there, nothing on
earth can or at least ought to sunder you.</P>
<P>East had remained lying down until Tom finished speaking, as if
fearing to interrupt him; he now sat up at the table, and leant
his head on one hand, taking up a pencil with the other, and
working little holes with it in the table-cover.  After a bit he
looked up, stopped the pencil, and said, &quot;Thank you very much,
old fellow.  There's no other boy in the house would have done
it for me but you or Arthur.  I can see well enough,&quot; he went
on, after a pause, &quot;all the best big fellows look on me with
suspicion; they think I'm a devil-may-care, reckless young
scamp.  So I am - eleven hours out of twelve, but not the
twelfth.  Then all of our contemporaries worth knowing follow
suit, of course:  we're very good friends at games and all that,
but not a soul of them but you and Arthur ever tried to break
through the crust, and see whether there was anything at the
bottom of me; and then the bad ones I won't stand and they know
that.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't you think that's half fancy, Harry?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not a bit of it,&quot; said East bitterly, pegging away with his
pencil.  &quot;I see it all plain enough.  Bless you, you think
everybody's as straightforward and kindhearted as you are.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, but what's the reason of it?  There must be a reason.
You can play all the games as well as any one and sing the best
song, and are the best company in the house.  You fancy you're
not liked, Harry.  It's all fancy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I only wish it was, Tom.  I know I could be popular enough with
all the bad ones, but that I won't have, and the good ones won't
have me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why not?&quot; persisted Tom; &quot;you don't drink or swear, or get out
at night; you never bully, or cheat at lessons.  If you only
showed you liked it, you'd have all the best fellows in the
house running after you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not I,&quot; said East.  Then with an effort he went on, &quot;I'll tell
you what it is.  I never stop the Sacrament.  I can see, from
the Doctor downwards, how that tells against me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, I've seen that,&quot; said Tom, &quot;and I've been very sorry for
it, and Arthur and I have talked about it.  I've often thought
of speaking to you, but it's so hard to begin on such subjects.
I'm very glad you've opened it.  Now, why don't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've never been confirmed,&quot; said East.</P>
<P>&quot;Not been confirmed!&quot; said Tom, in astonishment.  &quot;I never
thought of that.  Why weren't you confirmed with the rest of us
nearly three years ago?  I always thought you'd been confirmed
at home.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; answered East sorrowfully; &quot;you see this was how it
happened.  Last Confirmation was soon after Arthur came, and you
were so taken up with him I hardly saw either of you.  Well,
when the Doctor sent round for us about it, I was living mostly
with Green's set.  You know the sort.  They all went in.  I dare
say it was all right, and they got good by it; I don't want to
judge them.  Only all I could see of their reasons drove me just
the other way.  'Twas 'because the Doctor liked it;' 'no boy got
on who didn't stay the Sacrament;' it was the 'correct thing,'
in fact, like having a good hat to wear on Sundays.  I couldn't
stand it.  I didn't feel that I wanted to lead a different life.
I was very well content as I was, and I wasn't going to sham
religious to curry favour with the Doctor, or any one else.&quot;</P>
<P>East stopped speaking, and pegged away more diligently than ever
with his pencil.  Tom was ready to cry.  He felt half sorry at
first that he had been confirmed himself.  He seemed to have
deserted his earliest friend - to have left him by himself at
his worst need for those long years.  He got up and went and sat
by East, and put his arm over his shoulder.</P>
<P>&quot;Dear old boy,&quot; he said, &quot;how careless and selfish I've been.
But why didn't you come and talk to Arthur and me?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish to Heaven I had,&quot; said East, &quot;but I was a fool.  It's
too late talking of it now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why too late?  You want to be confirmed now, don't you?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I think so,&quot; said East.  &quot;I've thought about it a good deal;
only, often I fancy I must be changing, because I see it's to do
me good here - just what stopped me last time.  And then I go
back again.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I'll tell you now how 'twas with me,&quot; said Tom warmly.  &quot;If it
hadn't been for Arthur, I should have done just as you did.  I
hope I should.  I honour you for it.  But then he made it out
just as if it was taking the weak side before all the world - 
going in once for all against everything that's strong and rich,
and proud and respectable, a little band of brothers against the
whole world.  And the Doctor seemed to say so too, only he said
a great deal more.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah!&quot; groaned East, &quot;but there again, that's just another of my
difficulties whenever I think about the matter.  I don't want to
be one of your saints, one of your elect, whatever the right
phrase is.  My sympathies are all the other way - with the many,
the poor devils who run about the streets and don't go to
church.  Don't stare, Tom; mind, I'm telling you all that's in
my heart - as far as I know it - but it's all a muddle.  You
must be gentle with me if you want to land me.  Now I've seen a
deal of this sort of religion; I was bred up in it, and I can't
stand it.  If nineteen-twentieths of the world are to be left to
uncovenanted mercies, and that sort of thing, which means in
plain English to go to hell, and the other twentieth are to
rejoice at it all, why - &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! but, Harry, they ain't, they don't,&quot; broke in Tom, really
shocked.  &quot;Oh, how I wish Arthur hadn't gone!  I'm such a fool
about these things.  But it's all you want too, East; it is
indeed.  It cuts both ways somehow, being confirmed and taking
the Sacrament.  It makes you feel on the side of all the good
and all the bad too, of everybody in the world.  Only there's
some great dark strong power, which is crushing you and
everybody else.  That's what Christ conquered, and we've got to
fight.  What a fool I am!  I can't explain.  If Arthur were only
here!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I begin to get a glimmering of what you mean,&quot; said East.</P>
<P>&quot;I say, now,&quot; said Tom eagerly, &quot;do you remember how we both
hated Flashman?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Of course I do,&quot; said East; &quot;I hate him still.  What then?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, when I came to take the Sacrament, I had a great struggle
about that.  I tried to put him out of my head; and when I
couldn't do that, I tried to think of him as evil - as something
that the Lord who was loving me hated, and which I might hate
too.  But it wouldn't do.  I broke down; I believe Christ
Himself broke me down.  And when the Doctor gave me the bread
and wine, and leant over me praying, I prayed for poor Flashman,
as if it had been you or Arthur.&quot;</P>
<P>East buried his face in his hands on the table.  Tom could feel
the table tremble.  At last he looked up.  &quot;Thank you again,
Tom,&quot; said he; &quot;you don't know what you may have done for me to-
night.  I think I see now how the right sort of sympathy with
poor devils is got at.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And you'll stop the Sacrament next time, won't you?&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Can I, before I'm confirmed?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go and ask the Doctor.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will.&quot;</P>
<P>That very night, after prayers, East followed the Doctor, and
the old verger bearing the candle, upstairs.  Tom watched, and
saw the Doctor turn round when he heard footsteps following him
closer than usual, and say, &quot;Hah, East!  Do you want to speak to
me, my man?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If you please, sir.&quot;  And the private door closed, and Tom went
to his study in a state of great trouble of mind.</P>
<P>It was almost an hour before East came back.  Then he rushed in
breathless.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, it's all right,&quot; he shouted, seizing Tom by the hand.  &quot;I
feel as if a ton weight were off my mind.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hurrah,&quot; said Tom.  &quot;I knew it would be; but tell us all about
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I just told him all about it.  You can't think how kind
and gentle he was, the great grim man, whom I've feared more
than anybody on earth.  When I stuck, he lifted me just as if
I'd been a little child.  And he seemed to know all I'd felt,
and to have gone through it all.  And I burst out crying - more
than I've done this five years; and he sat down by me, and
stroked my head; and I went blundering on, and told him all - 
much worse things than I've told you.  And he wasn't shocked a
bit, and didn't snub me, or tell me I was a fool, and it was all
nothing but pride or wickedness, though I dare say it was.  And
he didn't tell me not to follow out my thoughts, and he didn't
give me any cut-and-dried explanation.  But when I'd done he
just talked a bit.  I can hardly remember what he said yet; but
it seemed to spread round me like healing, and strength, and
light, and to bear me up, and plant me on a rock, where I could
hold my footing and fight for myself.  I don't know what to do,
I feel so happy.  And it's all owing to you, dear old boy!&quot;  And
he seized Tom's hand again.</P>
<P>&quot;And you're to come to the Communion?&quot; said Tom.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, and to be confirmed in the holidays.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom's delight was as great as his friend's.  But he hadn't yet
had out all his own talk, and was bent on improving the
occasion:  so he proceeded to propound Arthur's theory about not
being sorry for his friends' deaths, which he had hitherto kept
in the background, and by which he was much exercised; for he
didn't feel it honest to take what pleased him, and throw over
the rest, and was trying vigorously to persuade himself that he
should like all his best friends to die off-hand.</P>
<P>But East's powers of remaining serious were exhausted, and in
five minutes he was saying the most ridiculous things he could
think of, till Tom was almost getting angry again.</P>
<P>Despite of himself, however, he couldn't help laughing and
giving it up, when East appealed to him with, &quot;Well, Tom, you
ain't going to punch my head, I hope, because I insist upon
being sorry when you got to earth?&quot;</P>
<P>And so their talk finished for that time, and they tried to
learn first lesson, with very poor success, as appeared next
morning, when they were called up and narrowly escaped being
floored, which ill-luck, however, did not sit heavily on either
of their souls.</P>
