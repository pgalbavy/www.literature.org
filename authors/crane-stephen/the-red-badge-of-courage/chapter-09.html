<P>
THE youth fell back in the procession until
the tattered soldier was not in sight.  Then he
started to walk on with the others.
<P>
But he was amid wounds.  The mob of men
was bleeding.  Because of the tattered soldier's
question he now felt that his shame could be
viewed.  He was continually casting sidelong
glances to see if the men were contemplating the
letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.
<P>
At times he regarded the wounded soldiers
in an envious way.  He conceived persons with
torn bodies to be peculiarly happy.  He wished
that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of cour-
age.
<P>
The spectral soldier was at his side like a
stalking reproach.  The man's eyes were still
fixed in a stare into the unknown.  His gray,
appalling face had attracted attention in the
crowd, and men, slowing to his dreary pace, were
walking with him.  They were discussing his
plight, questioning him and giving him advice.
<P>
91
In a dogged way he repelled them, signing to them
to go on and leave him alone.  The shadows of
his face were deepening and his tight lips seemed
holding in check the moan of great despair.
There could be seen a certain stiffness in the
movements of his body, as if he were taking
infinite care not to arouse the passion of his
wounds.  As he went on, he seemed always look-
ing for a place, like one who goes to choose a
grave.
<P>
Something in the gesture of the man as he
waved the bloody and pitying soldiers away
made the youth start as if bitten.  He yelled in
horror.  Tottering forward he laid a quivering
hand upon the man's arm.  As the latter slowly
turned his waxlike features toward him, the
youth screamed:
<P>
"Gawd!  Jim Conklin!"
<P>
The tall soldier made a little commonplace
smile.  "Hello, Henry," he said.
<P>
The youth swayed on his legs and glared
strangely.  He stuttered and stammered.  "Oh,
Jim--oh, Jim--oh, Jim--"
<P>
The tall soldier held out his gory hand.  There
was a curious red and black combination of new
blood and old blood upon it.  "Where yeh been,
Henry?" he asked.  He continued in a monoto-
nous voice, "I thought mebbe yeh got keeled
over.  There 's been thunder t' pay t'-day.  I was
worryin' about it a good deal."
<P>
The youth still lamented.  "Oh, Jim--oh, Jim
--oh, Jim--"
<P>
"Yeh know," said the tall soldier, "I was out
there."  He made a careful gesture.  "An',
Lord, what a circus!  An', b'jiminey, I got shot--
I got shot.  Yes, b'jiminey, I got shot."  He
reiterated this fact in a bewildered way, as if he
did not know how it came about.
<P>
The youth put forth anxious arms to assist
him, but the tall soldier went firmly on as if pro-
pelled.  Since the youth's arrival as a guardian
for his friend, the other wounded men had ceased
to display much interest.  They occupied them-
selves again in dragging their own tragedies
toward the rear.
<P>
Suddenly, as the two friends marched on, the
tall soldier seemed to be overcome by a terror.
His face turned to a semblance of gray paste.
He clutched the youth's arm and looked all about
him, as if dreading to be overheard.  Then he
began to speak in a shaking whisper:
<P>
"I tell yeh what I'm 'fraid of, Henry--I 'll tell
yeh what I 'm 'fraid of.  I 'm 'fraid I 'll fall down
--an' then yeh know--them damned artillery
wagons--they like as not 'll run over me.  That 's
what I 'm 'fraid of--"
<P>
The youth cried out to him hysterically: "I 'll
take care of yeh, Jim!  I'll take care of yeh!  I
swear t' Gawd I will!"
<P>
"Sure--will yeh, Henry?" the tall soldier
beseeched.
<P>
"Yes--yes--I tell yeh--I'll take care of yeh,
Jim!" protested the youth.  He could not speak
accurately because of the gulpings in his throat.
<P>
But the tall soldier continued to beg in a
lowly way.  He now hung babelike to the
youth's arm.  His eyes rolled in the wildness of
his terror.  "I was allus a good friend t' yeh,
wa'n't I, Henry?  I 've allus been a pretty good
feller, ain't I?  An' it ain't much t' ask, is it?  Jest
t' pull me along outer th' road?  I 'd do it fer you,
Wouldn't I, Henry?"
<P>
He paused in piteous anxiety to await his
friend's reply.
<P>
The youth had reached an anguish where the
sobs scorched him.  He strove to express his
loyalty, but he could only make fantastic gestures.
<P>
However, the tall soldier seemed suddenly to
forget all those fears.  He became again the
grim, stalking specter of a soldier.  He went
stonily forward.  The youth wished his friend to
lean upon him, but the other always shook his
head and strangely protested.  "No--no--no--
leave me be--leave me be--"
<P>
His look was fixed again upon the unknown.
He moved with mysterious purpose, and all of
the youth's offers he brushed aside.  "No--no--
leave me be--leave me be--"
<P>
The youth had to follow.
<P>
Presently the latter heard a voice talking
softly near his shoulders.  Turning he saw that it
belonged to the tattered soldier.  "Ye 'd better
take 'im outa th' road, pardner.  There 's a batt'ry
comin' helitywhoop down th' road an' he 'll git
runned over.  He 's a goner anyhow in about five
minutes--yeh kin see that.  Ye 'd better take 'im
outa th' road.  Where th' blazes does he git his
stren'th from?"
<P>
"Lord knows!" cried the youth.  He was
shaking his hands helplessly.
<P>
He ran forward presently and grasped the
tall soldier by the arm.  "Jim!  Jim!" he coaxed,
"come with me."
<P>
The tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself
free.  "Huh," he said vacantly.  He stared at the
youth for a moment.  At last he spoke as if dimly
comprehending.  "Oh!  Inteh th' fields?  Oh!"
<P>
He started blindly through the grass.
<P>
The youth turned once to look at the lashing
riders and jouncing guns of the battery.  He was
startled from this view by a shrill outcry from
the tattered man.
<P>
"Gawd!  He's runnin'!"
<P>
Turning his head swiftly, the youth saw his
friend running in a staggering and stumbling
way toward a little clump of bushes.  His heart
seemed to wrench itself almost free from his
body at this sight.  He made a noise of pain.
He and the tattered man began a pursuit.  There
was a singular race.
<P>
When he overtook the tall soldier he began
to plead with all the words he could find.  "Jim
--Jim--what are you doing--what makes you do
this way--you 'll hurt yerself."
<P>
The same purpose was in the tall soldier's face.
He protested in a dulled way, keeping his eyes
fastened on the mystic place of his intentions.
"No--no--don't tech me--leave me be--leave
me be--"
<P>
The youth, aghast and filled with wonder at the
tall soldier, began quaveringly to question him.
"Where yeh goin', Jim?  What you thinking
about?  Where you going?  Tell me, won't you,
Jim?"
<P>
The tall soldier faced about as upon relentless
pursuers.  In his eyes there was a great appeal.
"Leave me be, can't yeh?  Leave me be fer a
minnit."
<P>
The youth recoiled.  "Why, Jim," he said, in
a dazed way, "what's the matter with you?"
<P>
The tall soldier turned and, lurching danger-
ously, went on.  The youth and the tattered
soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling
unable to face the stricken man if he should again
confront them.  They began to have thoughts of
a solemn ceremony.  There was something rite-
like in these movements of the doomed soldier.
And there was a resemblance in him to a devotee
of a mad religion, blood-sucking, muscle-wrench-
ing, bone-crushing.  They were awed and afraid.
They hung back lest he have at command a
dreadful weapon.
<P>
At last, they saw him stop and stand motion-
less.  Hastening up, they perceived that his face
wore an expression telling that he had at last
found the place for which he had struggled.  His
spare figure was erect; his bloody hands were
quietly at his side.  He was waiting with patience
for something that he had come to meet.  He was
at the rendezvous.  They paused and stood, ex-
pectant.
<P>
There was a silence.
<P>
Finally, the chest of the doomed soldier began
to heave with a strained motion.  It increased in
violence until it was as if an animal was within
and was kicking and tumbling furiously to be
free.
<P>
This spectacle of gradual strangulation made
the youth writhe, and once as his friend rolled his
eyes, he saw something in them that made him
sink wailing to the ground.  He raised his voice
in a last supreme call.
<P>
"Jim--Jim--Jim--"
<P>
The tall soldier opened his lips and spoke.
He made a gesture.  "Leave me be--don't tech
me--leave me be--"
<P>
There was another silence while he waited.
<P>
Suddenly, his form stiffened and straightened.
Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague.  He
stared into space.  To the two watchers there
was a curious and profound dignity in the firm
lines of his awful face.
<P>
He was invaded by a creeping strangeness
that slowly enveloped him.  For a moment the
tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of
hideous hornpipe.  His arms beat wildly about
his head in expression of implike enthusiasm.
<P>
His tall figure stretched itself to its full height.
There was a slight rending sound.  Then it began
to swing forward, slow and straight, in the man-
ner of a falling tree.  A swift muscular contortion
made the left shoulder strike the ground first.
<P>
The body seemed to bounce a little way from
the earth.  "God!" said the tattered soldier.
<P>
The youth had watched, spellbound, this
ceremony at the place of meeting.  His face
had been twisted into an expression of every
agony he had imagined for his friend.
<P>
He now sprang to his feet and, going closer,
gazed upon the pastelike face.  The mouth was
open and the teeth showed in a laugh.
<P>
As the flap of the blue jacket fell away from
the body, he could see that the side looked as if it
had been chewed by wolves.
<P>
The youth turned, with sudden, livid rage,
toward the battlefield.  He shook his fist.  He
seemed about to deliver a philippic.
<P>
"Hell--"
<P>
The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.
