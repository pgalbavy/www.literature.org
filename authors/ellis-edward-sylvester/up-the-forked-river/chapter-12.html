<p>But the fly was still in the ointment. General Yozarro showed
in innumerable ways that his passion swayed him more absolutely,
if possible, than before. It appeared in the touch of his hand
when assisting Miss Starland to mount or alight from her horse
on which she rode with her friends through the picturesque country
that surrounded the capital,&mdash;in the glance of his ardent black
eyes, in the sigh which he pretended to try to keep from her,
and in the many hints which he dropped of his lonely life since
the death of his wife. The young woman could not touch upon these
themes, lest he accept it as encouragement; so she contented herself
with parrying them. She began to long for the time when she should
turn her back upon Atlamalco forever.</p>

<p>On a certain balmy forenoon, General Yozarro, his niece and Miss
Starland rode out from the town and over the trail leading into
the Rubio Mountains. They were on their way to <em>Castillo Descanso</em>,
which had been the cause of much fighting between the republics,
and which had finally fallen into the possession of the Dictator
of Atlamalco. It was a considerable way in the mountains and stood
upon an elevation that brought it out in clear view from the capital.</p>

<p>"It is fully three centuries old," explained Señorita Estacardo
to her friend, "and is unlike anything I have ever seen in this
part of the world. I suppose there are plenty of similar buildings
along the Rhine and perhaps on your own Hudson, which has been
called the Rhine of America."</p>

<p>"How came it to be built?"</p>

<p>"I can only repeat the legends that have come down to us. Some
great pirate or general of Spain or Portugal &mdash;I don't know
which&mdash;came up the river in quest of gold mines of which he had
heard stories from the natives. You know that the first Spaniards
who crossed the ocean to our continent cared more for gold than
any or everything else, and stopped at no crimes to obtain it."</p>

<p>"That was the case with many other nations."</p>

<p>"Well, this buccaneer landed his crew here and tramped inland
to the mountains, where the gold was reported to be. He took with
him several hundred native prisoners to work the mines. He is
said to have been very successful, and while his slaves were digging
in the mountains, he set many others to work building him a home.</p>

<p>"Oh, there was no element of romance lacking, for he brought
with him a young and beautiful bride and it was for her that the
Castle was built. He must have learned from Columbus, Balboa,
Pizarro and the other early explorers that the worm sometimes
turns and that it was wise for him to make his position safe against
any revolt of the Indians. So the house which you are about to
visit was put up. It is of solid stone and three stories high,&mdash;something
almost unknown in an earthquake country like ours."</p>

<p>"But what became of this fine old gentleman?"</p>

<p>"I declare I forgot that. He lived there for years and then found
that the danger against which he had made such full preparations
was not the one that threatened him. The natives did not revolt,
though why they did not I do not understand, for he treated them
like beasts of burden and killed many in mere wantonness. It was
his own men who rose against him. They had gathered a great deal
of gold, but grew homesick. They hated the country and begged
him again and again to leave or allow them to go, since they had
enough wealth for all. He swore that not one should depart till
the store of gold was increased ten-fold. Then, and not until
then, would he weigh anchor, spread sail and pass down the river
to the ocean and so homeward.</p>

<p>"Well, although I suppose the men were able to gather more gold,
it is not to be supposed they could have gotten as much as he
wished. So they took the shortest way to close up the business.
They killed the captain and his bride, carried aboard ship all
the wealth they had collected, set sail and passed out from further
chronicle. What do you think of the story, Warrenia?"</p>

<p>"It has the true flavor and makes me anxious to look through
the Castle."</p>

<p>General Yozarro, who was riding in advance along the narrow trail,
and listening to the words of his niece at the rear, called over
his shoulder:</p>

<p>"That privilege shall be yours in a brief time, Miss Starland;
I am glad you are interested."</p>

<p>"How could any one help it? Is the Castle yours, General?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it may be said to be a part of the spoils of war. The boundary
line between Atlamalco and Zalapata runs through these mountains,
but its precise course has never been defined. The Castle rightfully
belonged to Atlamalco, but General Bambos claimed that it stood
on his territory. Since he was deaf to argument and reason nothing
remained but to refer it to the arbitrament of arms, with the
result that General Bambos is quite sure not to open the dispute
again."</p>

<p>"Did those visitors of the long ago take away all the gold in
the mountains?"</p>

<p>"That is quite impossible."</p>

<p>"Why do <em>you</em> not dig or mine for what is left?"</p>

<p>"I have thought of that, but it seems wise to wait until I gain
some one to share my lonely life with me."</p>

<p>"Would it not be more considerate to finish the work before that
time, so that you both will be at leisure to enjoy it? How much
better than waging war with your neighbors!"</p>

<p>"I have sufficient gold for me and mine. You mean it would be
better for my neighbors to refrain from waging war against me.
I made a religious vow long since never to go to war except in
the defence of my rights, and that you know is one's solemn duty."</p>

<p>It was the same old argument that General Bambos had used in
discussing the question with Major Jack Starland.</p>

<p>The young woman made no reply, for she saw it would be useless,
and her escort added:</p>

<p>"Your counsel is good, Miss Starland, but suppose General Bambos
should construe such action on my part as unfriendly?"</p>

<p>"Surely he cannot do so, unless you enter his territory, and
that I am sure you have no thought of doing."</p>

<p>"You know not the perfidy of that man," was the commentary of
the Dictator, his words inspired by jealousy.</p>

<p>When the Castle of Rest was reached it justified all that Señorita
Estacardo had said of it, though it lacked moat and drawbridge
and the other feudal accessories. It was of massive rock and stone,
sixty or more feet in length and almost as broad. The lowest floor
consisted of two large rooms, with broad openings instead of doors,
rough and unfurnished and with walls several feet in thickness.
At the time of its building, it would have resisted any armament
that could have been brought to bear against it. The crevices
between the stones throughout the structure had been filled with
clay or adobe, which in the course of centuries had hardened to
the consistency of rock itself. The second and third stories contained
each four apartments, whose walls were of less thickness, but
the whole constituted a veritable Gibraltar. Sloping stone steps
connected each story, but only the rooms of the second contained
anything in the nature of furniture.</p>

<p>It was evident that General Yozarro had given this portion recent
attention, for the windows, tall, narrow and paneless, had been
screened by netting with the finest of meshes, though none can
be fine enough to wholly exclude the infinitesimal insects like
the coloradilla, or red flea, whose bite is as the point of a
red hot needle, the sand fly, and other devilish insects beyond
enumeration. Matting was spread on the smooth stone floors, there
were imported chairs of costly make, stands, a bureau and much
of what constitutes the appointments of a modern residence in
a tropical country. The doors were made of a species of wood,
beautifully carved, but showing no effects of the tooth of time,
except in the gray faded color, for paint had never touched them.
They were powerful enough to defy a battering ram, fitted with
enormous locks and heavy bars that could be slipped into the massive
iron receptacles.</p>

<p>"Had that old buccaneer been given notice of the attack by his
men," said Miss Starland, when the building had been inspected
from top to bottom, "he might have shut himself in one of these
rooms and bade them do their worst."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he did," suggested General Yozarro.</p>

<p>"And yet the legend says he fell."</p>

<p>"Starvation and thirst are enemies to whom the bravest must surrender."</p>

<p>"It looks, General, as if you had been rejuvenating this fine
old Castle."</p>

<p>"I have done so to a certain extent in honor of your coming.
Besides I thought my niece would find a stay here pleasant during
the oppressive weather and I prepared it partly for her. You observe
how much cooler it is here than in the capital."</p>
