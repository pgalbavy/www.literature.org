<p>Nothing could have been more painful to my sensitiveness than
to occupy myself, confused with blushes, at the center of the
whole world as a living advertisement of the least amusing ballet
in Paris.</p>

<p>To be the day's sensation of the boulevards one must possess
an eccentricity of appearance conceived by nothing short of genius;
and my misfortunes had reduced me to present such to all eyes
seeking mirth. It was not that I was one of those people in uniform
who carry placards and strange figures upon their backs, nor that
my coat was of rags; on the contrary, my whole costume was delicately
rich and well chosen, of soft grey and fine linen (such as you
see worn by a marquis in the pe'sage at Auteuil) according well
with my usual air and countenance, sometimes esteemed to resemble
my father's, which were not wanting in distinction.</p>

<p>To add to this my duties were not exhausting to the body. I was
required only to sit without a hat from ten of the morning to
midday, and from four until seven in the afternoon, at one of
the small tables under the awning of the Cafe' de la Paix at the
corner of the Place de l'Opera&mdash;that is to say, the centre of
the inhabited world. In the morning I drank my coffee, hot in
the cup; in the afternoon I sipped it cold in the glass. I spoke
to no one; not a glance or a gesture of mine passed to attract
notice.</p>

<p>Yet I was the centre of that centre of the world. All day the
crowds surrounded me, laughing loudly; all the voyous making those
jokes for which I found no repartee. The pavement was sometimes
blocked; the passing coachmen stood up in their boxes to look
over at me, small infants were elevated on shoulders to behold
me; not the gravest or most sorrowful came by without stopping
to gaze at me and go away with rejoicing faces. The boulevards
rang to their laughter&mdash;all Paris laughed!</p>

<p>For seven days I sat there at the appointed times, meeting the
eye of nobody, and lifting my coffee with fingers which trembled
with embarrassment at this too great conspicuosity! Those mournful
hours passed, one by the year, while the idling bourgeois and
the travellers made ridicule; and the rabble exhausted all effort
to draw plays of wit from me.</p>

<p>I have told you that I carried no placard, that my costume was
elegant, my demeanour modest in all degree.</p>

<p>"How, then, this excitement?" would be your disposition to inquire.
"Why this sensation?"</p>

<p>It is very simple. My hair had been shaved off, all over my ears,
leaving only a little above the back of the neck, to give an appearance
of far-reaching baldness, and on my head was painted, in ah! so
brilliant letters of distinctness:</p>

<p>Such was the necessity to which I was at that time reduced! One
has heard that the North Americans invent the most singular advertising,
but I will not believe they surpass the Parisian. Myself, I say
I cannot express my sufferings under the notation of the crowds
that moved about the Cafe' de la Paix! The French are a terrible
people when they laugh sincerely. It is not so much the amusing
things which cause them amusement; it is often the strange, those
contrasts which contain something horrible, and when they laugh
there is too frequently some person who is uncomfortable or wicked.
I am glad that I was born not a Frenchman; I should regret to
be native to a country where they invent such things as I was
doing in the Place de l'Opera; for, as I tell you, the idea was
not mine.</p>

<p>As I sat with my eyes drooping before the gaze of my terrible
and applauding audiences, how I mentally formed cursing words
against the day when my misfortunes led me to apply at the Theatre
Folie-Rouge for work! I had expected an audition and a role of
comedy in the Revue; for, perhaps lacking any experience of the
stage, I am a Neapolitan by birth, though a resident of the Continent
at large since the age of fifteen. All Neapolitans can act; all
are actors; comedians of the greatest, as every traveller is cognizant.
There is a thing in the air of our beautiful slopes which makes
the people of a great instinctive musicalness and deceptiveness,
with passions like those burning in the old mountain we have there.
They are ready to play, to sing&mdash;or to explode, yet, imitating
that amusing Vesuvio, they never do this last when you are in
expectancy, or, as a spectator, hopeful of it.</p>

<p>How could any person wonder, then, that I, finding myself suddenly
destitute in Paris, should apply at the theatres? One after another,
I saw myself no farther than the director's door, until (having
had no more to eat the day preceding than three green almonds,
which I took from a cart while the good female was not looking)
I reached the Folie-Rouge. Here I was astonished to find a polite
reception from the director. It eventuated that they wished for
a person appearing like myself a person whom they would outfit
with clothes of quality in all parts, whose external presented
a gentleman of the great world, not merely of one the galant-uomini,
but who would impart an air to a table at a cafe' where he might
sit and partake. The contrast of this with the emplacement of
the establishment on his bald head-top was to be the success of
the idea. It was plain that I had no baldness, my hair being very
thick and I but twenty-four years of age, when it was explained
that my hair could be shaved. They asked me to accept, alas! not
a part in the Revue, but a specialty as a sandwich-man. Knowing
the English tongue as I do, I may afford the venturesomeness to
play upon it a little: I asked for bread, and they offered me
not a role, but a sandwich!</p>

<p>It must be undoubted that I possessed not the disposition to
make any fun with my accomplishments during those days that I
spent under the awning of the Cafe' de la Paix. I had consented
to be the advertisement in greatest desperation, and not considering
what the reality would be. Having consented, honour compelled
that I fulfil to the ending. Also, the costume and outfittings
I wore were part of my emolument. They had been constructed for
me by the finest tailor; and though I had impulses, often, to
leap up and fight through the noisy ones about me and run far
to the open country, the very garments I wore were fetters binding
me to remain and suffer. It seemed to me that the hours were spent
not in the centre of a ring of human persons, but of un-well-made
pantaloons and ugly skirts. Yet all of these pantaloons and skirts
had such scrutinous eyes and expressions of mirth to laugh like
demons at my conscious, burning, painted head; eyes which spread
out, astonished at the sight of me, and peered and winked and
grinned from the big wrinkles above the gaiters of Zouaves, from
the red breeches of the gendarmes, the knickerbockers of the cyclists,
the white ducks of sergents de ville, and the knees of the boulevardiers,
bagged with sitting cross-legged at the little tables. I could
not escape these eyes;&mdash;how scornfully they twinkled at me from
the spurred and glittering officers' boots! How with amaze from
the American and English trousers, both turned up and creased
like folded paper, both with some dislike for each other but for
all other trousers more.</p>

<p>It was only at such times when the mortifications to appear so
greatly embarrassed became stronger than the embarrassment itself
that I could by will power force my head to a straight construction
and look out upon my spectators firmly. On the second day of my
ordeal, so facing the laughers, I found myself facing straight
into the monocle of my half-brother and ill-wisher, Prince Caravacioli.</p>

<p>At this, my agitation was sudden and very great, for there was
no one I wished to prevent perceiving my condition more than that
old Antonio Caravacioli! I had not known that he was in Paris,
but I could have no doubt it was himself: the monocle, the handsome
nose, the toupee', the yellow skin, the dyed-black moustache,
the splendid height&mdash;it was indeed Caravacioli! He was costumed
for the automobile, and threw but one glance at me as he crossed
the pavement to his car, which was in waiting. There was no change,
not of the faintest, in that frosted tragic mask of a countenance,
and I was glad to think that he had not recognized me.</p>

<p>And yet, how strange that I should care, since all his life he
had declined to recognize me as what I was! Ah, I should have
been glad to shout his age, his dyes, his artificialities, to
all the crowd, so to touch him where it would most pain him! For
was he not the vainest man in the whole world? How well I knew
his vulnerable point: the monstrous depth of his vanity in that
pretense of youth which he preserved through superhuman pains
and a genius of a valet, most excellently! I had much to pay Antonio
for myself, more for my father, most for my mother. This was why
that last of all the world I would have wished that old fortune-hunter
to know how far I had been reduced!</p>

<p>Then I rejoiced about that change which my unreal baldness produced
in me, giving me a look of forty years instead of twenty-four,
so that my oldest friend must take at least three stares to know
me. Also, my costume would disguise me from the few acquaintances
I had in Paris (if they chanced to cross the Seine), as they had
only seen me in the shabbiest; while, at my last meeting with
Antonio, I had been as fine in the coat as now.</p>

<p>Yet my encouragement was not so joyful that my gaze lifted often.
On the very last day, in the afternoon when my observances were
most and noisiest, I lifted my eyes but once during the final
half-hour&mdash;but such a one that was!</p>

<p>The edge of that beautiful grey pongee skirt came upon the lid
of my lowered eyelid like a cool shadow over hot sand. A sergent
had just made many of the people move away, so there remained
only a thin ring of the laughing pantaloons about me, when this
divine skirt presented its apparition to me. A pair of North-American
trousers accompanied it, turned up to show the ankle-bones of
a rich pair of stockings; neat, enthusiastic and humorous, I judged
them to be; for, as one may discover, my only amusement during
my martyrdom&mdash;if this misery can be said to possess such alleviatings&mdash;had
been the study of feet, pantaloons, and skirts. The trousers in
this case detained my observation no time. They were but the darkest
corner of the chiaroscuro of a Rembrandt&mdash;the mellow glow of gold
was all across the grey skirt.</p>

<p>How shall I explain myself, how make myself understood? Shall
I be thought sentimentalistic or but mad when I declare that my
first sight of the grey pongee skirt caused me a thrill of excitation,
of tenderness, and&mdash;oh-i-me!&mdash;of self-consciousness more acute
than all my former mortifications. It was so very different from
all other skirts that had shown themselves to me those sad days,
and you may understand that, though the pantaloons far outnumbered
the skirts, many hundreds of the latter had also been objects
of my gloomy observation.</p>

<p>This skirt, so unlike those which had passed, presented at once
the qualifications of its superiority. It had been constructed
by an artist, and it was worn by a lady. It did not pine, it did
not droop; there was no more an atom of hanging too much than
there was a portion inflated by flamboyancy; it did not assert
itself; it bore notice without seeking it. Plain but exquisite,
it was that great rarity&mdash;goodness made charming.</p>

<p>The peregrination of the American trousers suddenly stopped as
they caught sight of me, and that precious skirt paused, precisely
in opposition to my little table. I heard a voice, that to which
the skirt pertained. It spoke the English, but not in the manner
of the inhabitants of London, who seem to sing undistinguishably
in their talking, although they are comprehensible to each other.
To an Italian it seems that many North-Americans and English seek
too often the assistance of the nose in talking, though in different
manners, each equally unagreeable to our ears. The intelligent
among our lazzaroni of Naples, who beg from tourists, imitate
this, with the purpose of reminding the generous traveller of
his home, in such a way to soften his heart. But there is some
difference: the Italian, the Frenchman, or German who learns English
sometimes misunderstands the American: the Englishman he sometimes
understands.</p>

<p>This voice that spoke was North-American. Ah, what a voice! Sweet
as the mandolins of Sorento! Clear as the bells of Capri! To hear
it, was like coming upon sight of the almond-blossoms of Sicily
for the first time, or the tulip-fields of Holland. Never before
was such a voice!</p>

<p>"Why did you stop, Rufus?" it said.</p>

<p>"Look!" replied the American trousers; so that I knew the pongee
lady had not observed me of herself.</p>

<p>Instantaneously there was an exclamation, and a pretty grey parasol,
closed, fell at my feet. It is not the pleasantest to be an object
which causes people to be startled when they behold you; but I
blessed the agitation of this lady, for what caused her parasol
to fall from her hand was a start of pity.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she cried. "The poor man!"</p>

<p>She had perceived that I was a gentleman.</p>

<p>I bent myself forward and lifted the parasol, though not my eyes
I could not have looked up into the face above me to be Caesar!
Two hands came down into the circle of my observation; one of
these was that belonging to the trousers, thin, long, and white;
the other was the grey-gloved hand of the lady, and never had
I seen such a hand&mdash;the hand of an angel in a suede glove, as
the grey skirt was the mantle of a saint made by Doucet. I speak
of saints and angels; and to the large world these may sound like
cold words. &mdash;It is only in Italy where some people are found
to adore them still.</p>

<p>I lifted the parasol toward that glove as I would have moved
to set a candle on an altar. Then, at a thought, I placed it not
in the glove, but in the thin hand of the gentleman. At the same
time the voice of the lady spoke to me &mdash;I was to have the
joy of remembering that this voice had spoken four words to me.</p>

<p>"Je vous remercie, monsieur," it said.</p>

<p>"Pas de quoi!" I murmured.</p>

<p>The American trousers in a loud tone made reference in the idiom
to my miserable head: "Did you ever see anything to beat it?"</p>

<p>The beautiful voice answered, and by the gentleness of her sorrow
for me I knew she had no thought that I might understand. "Come
away. It is too pitiful!"</p>

<p>Then the grey skirt and the little round-toed shoes beneath it
passed from my sight, quickly hidden from me by the increasing
crowd; yet I heard the voice a moment more, but fragmentarily:
"Don't you see how ashamed he is, how he must have been starving
before he did that, or that someone dependent on him needed&mdash;"</p>

<p>I caught no more, but the sweetness that this beautiful lady
understood and felt for the poor absurd wretch was so great that
I could have wept. I had not seen her face; I had not looked up&mdash;even
when she went.</p>

<p>"Who is she?" cried a scoundrel voyous, just as she turned. "Madame
of the parasol? A friend of monsieur of the ornamented head?"</p>

<p>"No. It is the first lady in waiting to his wife, Madame la Duchesse,"
answered a second. "She has been sent with an equerry to demand
of monseigneur if he does not wish a little sculpture upon his
dome as well as the colour decorations!"</p>

<p>"'Tis true, my ancient?" another asked of me.</p>

<p>I made no repartee, continuing to sit with my chin dependent
upon my cravat, but with things not the same in my heart as formerly
to the arrival of that grey pongee, the grey glove, and the beautiful
voice.</p>

<p>Since King Charles the Mad, in Paris no one has been completely
free from lunacy while the spring-time is happening. There is
something in the sun and the banks of the Seine. The Parisians
drink sweet and fruity champagne because the good wines are already
in their veins. These Parisians are born intoxicated and remain
so; it is not fair play to require them to be like other human
people. Their deepest feeling is for the arts; and, as everyone
had declared, they are farceurs in their tragedies, tragic in
their comedies. They prepare the last epigram in the tumbril;
they drown themselves with enthusiasm about the alliance with
Russia. In death they are witty; in war they have poetic spasms;
in love they are mad.</p>

<p>The strangest of all this is that it is not only the Parisians
who are the insane ones in Paris; the visitors are none of them
in behaviour as elsewhere. You have only to go there to become
as lunatic as the rest. Many travellers, when they have departed,
remember the events they have caused there as a person remembers
in the morning what he has said and thought in the moonlight of
the night.</p>

<p>In Paris it is moonlight even in the morning; and in Paris one
falls in love even more strangely than by moonlight.</p>

<p>It is a place of glimpses: a veil fluttering from a motor-car,
a little lace handkerchief fallen from a victoria, a figure crossing
a lighted window, a black hat vanishing in the distance of the
avenues of the Tuileries. A young man writes a ballade and dreams
over a bit of lace. Was I not, then, one of the least extravagant
of this mad people? Men have fallen in love with photographs,
those greatest of liars; was I so wild, then, to adore this grey
skirt, this small shoe, this divine glove, the golden-honey voice&mdash;of
all in Paris the only one to pity and to understand? Even to love
the mystery of that lady and to build my dreams upon it?&mdash;to love
all the more because of the mystery? Mystery is the last word
and the completing charm to a young man's passion. Few sonnets
have been written to wives whose matrimony is more than five years
of age&mdash;is it not so?</p>
