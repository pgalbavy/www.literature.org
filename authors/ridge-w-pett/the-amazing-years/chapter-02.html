<p>Guard Richards called at The Croft on the Monday afternoon, and brought
a newspaper which he said contained little that was fresh and nothing
that could be reckoned as jolly; before entering into any conversation
with him, I took it to Master John.
</p>
<p>"The governor requires careful handling," he mentioned. "You
understand, Weston, I'm sure. He mustn't get too many whacks all at
once."
</p><p>"He can scarcely have anyone near him better than yourself, sir."
</p><p>"The others are not helping a great deal," he admitted. "I foresee
how much we are going to rely upon you, Weston." I expressed the
hope that he would stay as long as was possible, hinted that, in the
circumstances, he might perhaps feel disposed to give up his rooms
in town. "It will depend upon--" he began, and searched for a word.
"Circumstances," he added.
</p><p>William Richards I had known since the country days when I tried to
be a school teacher and failed in the examination, and my mother,
considerably annoyed, packed me off to service, and he, too,
disappointed his people by refusing to be educated with the view
of becoming a Wesleyan minister, and ran to London, and joined the
railway. By the time I returned to the hall, Master Edward had found
him, and Richards, with coat off in the field near the house was
sending down a swift ball at a single stump, where Master Edward in
gloves and pads endeavoured to imitate the methods of his favourite
wicket-keeper. For some reason, the spectacle annoyed me. In the case
of the boy it was easy enough to understand, but William was forty if
a day, and at a time when everyone about the place seemed more or less
worried, it was irritating to see a big hulking chap playing at games.
</p><p>"But it's Bank Holiday," he argued, when I had given my opinions.
</p><p>"You're nothing but a kid," I declared. "In everything but years."
</p><p>"Neither you or me, Mary Weston, can reckon ourselves as mere chicken.
But that's no reason why we should go about with a face as long as a
fiddle."
</p><p>"It's a reason why we should set an example to those younger than
ourselves. Are you aware that your country is likely to find itself in
the biggest difficulty it's ever encountered?"
</p><p>"A lot of passengers," he remarked, "have been telling me about it,
but I never take much notice of rumours. Up at Charing Cross, one of
the inspectors said the railways was going to be taken over by the
Government; but, there again, I don't place much dependence, for the
simple reason that it comes from a man who has give me more wrong tips
in regard to 'orses than I've had from all the rest of the staff put
together. Who's this coming up the road?"
</p><p>A woman in my position cannot possibly think of everything, especially
at a time when there is more than usual to be thinking about, and
I had clean forgotten to write to my young nephew to tell him the
Continental trip was cancelled. Here he came, looking taller than ever,
but slightly round shouldered; his leather case in one hand, and in the
other a book that he read as he walked. Herbert Millwood was never one
to waste a single moment in his studies, and we watched him as he by
chance avoided collision with other people, and by luck escaped contact
with a lamp-post. He was going past the second gate of The Croft when
I called to him. He came out of his dreams, dropped the book. Master
Edward, impatient to resume play, ran out and picked it up whilst
Herbert gave me a kiss, and offered his hand to William Richards.
</p><p>"Are you reading this too?" cried Master Edward. "I've just finished
it. Isn't it a ripper."
</p><p>"I found it," said my nephew, in his careful way of speech, "extremely
interesting. It appears to me a most accurate description of cowboy
life in Western America."
</p><p>I recognised one of the twopenny volumes with which the house was
always strewn during the period of Master Edward's holidays. Coming on
the top of Guard Richards's behaviour, the discovery did not lessen my
resentment.
</p><p>"Herbert," I said, shortly, "you can take yourself off home again. I
meant to have written to you. William Richards, perhaps you've got
sufficient intelligence to tell us when the next up train goes?"
</p><p>Miss Muriel came out of the house, walked down the steps, and along the
broad gravelled space. "Weston," she said, authoritatively, "arrange
something for me to do. The tennis party I ought to have gone to has
been put off. It's most annoying." She stared at Herbert.
</p><p>"My nephew, miss," I said, presenting him, "who was to have stayed here
if you'd all gone abroad."
</p><p>"Do you play?" she demanded.
</p><p>"Haven't a racket," he answered. "It's been sent up to Cambridge with
my luggage."
</p><p>"One can be found. And do you play?" (To William Richards.)
</p><p>"No reason why I shouldn't be learnt, Miss."
</p><p>They took the whole business out of my hands. Herbert and Miss Muriel
decided to be partners against William Richards and Master Edward. The
two visitors remembered, at the last moment, that their shoes might
damage the grass. "It doesn't matter in the least," said Miss Muriel,
with a touch of bitterness. "The general impression I gain is that we
shall be leaving here before the end of the week."
</p><p>"You don't mean that!" exclaimed my nephew.
</p><p>"Really don't know what I mean," she retorted, irritably, "or what
anybody else means. There are so many riddles about that I have given
up all attempt to answer them. And Weston, here, whose business it is
to cheer us up, and who is paid to cheer us up, has apparently gone on
strike. Just as though," addressing Guard Richards, "just as though she
were a railway man."
</p><p>"Miss Hillier," said Master Edward, "having made herself pleasant
and agreeable to most of the company present, will now show us her
celebrated imitation of Mrs. Lambert-Chambers at the net."
</p><p>"I am not a crack player," she remarked condescendingly to my nephew,
"but I have my good days."
</p><p>It appeared, later, that Miss Muriel was put off her game by the
marching by of Territorials, an insect in her eye, rays of the sun,
and one or two other discouraging incidents. Nevertheless, the game
improved her temper, and she was in a gracious mood when I sent two of
the maids out with table and trays; she admitted the victory had been a
narrow one, and that Herbert was as good as Master Edward, whilst she
was but a shade better than Guard Richards. William Richards improved
his position, and caused himself to be reckoned an efficient member
of good society by juggling dexterously with four tennis balls. "If
I could do that," declared Master Edward, "I should never trouble to
do anything else. How did you get the knack of it, guard?" William
explained that on long journeys, when parcels had been sorted, and
letters arranged, an official of his rank had plenty of time for
practising the art. He tried to make a further impression by essaying
a trick he had seen at a popular entertainment; this necessitated the
providing of a leather hat case, an open umbrella, and a cigarette,
and all these articles were readily discovered and furnished. William
Richards threw the cigarette in the air, and failed to catch it with
his mouth, the leather hat case fell upon Miss Muriel, and the open
umbrella came down upon me. William said he thought he had better catch
the next train, but Master Edward, declaring that he, too, did not
always succeed in his experiments, begged him to stay.
</p><p>I was afraid Mrs. Hillier, when she came out, would be annoyed at the
sight of the mixed group, but she was so eager to obtain opinions
concerning the war that she seemed ready to forgive the presence of
the two visitors, and to overlook the fact that one of them was in a
uniform. My mistress, at that period, always accepted and repeated the
views of the last person consulted, and the effect of this was that
sometimes she felt certain we were not going to be involved in the
war, sometimes that France, with one hand tied behind its back, could
beat Germany, sometimes that the Kaiser would be at Buckingham Palace
by the end of August. William Richards took care from her shoulders
by alluding to the numerous occasions, within his knowledge, when
inaccuracies had appeared in the journals of the day.
</p><p>"If they spelt your name wrongly in the Board of Trade inquiry you are
speaking of," she said, "why it stands to reason that the newspapers
are capable of making even greater blunders in regard to more important
subjects."
</p><p>"Exactly my argument, lady," he said.
</p><p>"I must get you to talk to my husband, guard."
</p><p>"If the gentleman has made up his mind, perhaps it wouldn't be much
use."
</p><p>"That," she said, addressing the group, "is just what I complain of
in regard to Mr. Hillier. He's obstinate. He's self-willed. He won't
listen to reason. He doesn't understand as I do that no reliance can
be placed on what one reads. I wonder whether we shall get an evening
paper?"
</p><p>I mentioned that Guard Richards had brought one, and went in search of
it. On the way back I glanced at the stop press column, which William
apparently had over-looked. It seemed a pity to spoil the comfort of
the party, and I tore the portion off, and held it in my fist.
</p><p>"This time next week," said Mrs. Hillier, after glancing at the head
lines, "we shall be laughing at the way people have allowed themselves
to be upset over trifles."
</p><p>My dodge did enable them to enjoy an hour of composure; I regretted,
in a way, that the others were not present, if only to see how well
my nephew could comport himself when he encountered his betters.
William Richards was telling the old story of the flustered young woman
passenger, who on the platform kissed the guard, and gave her husband
threepence, when Colonel Edgington came along the drive, flourishing a
newspaper.
</p><p>"The bounders have invaded Belgium," he shouted.
</p><p>"I don't believe it," declared Mrs. Hillier at once. "It's probably a
misprint."
</p><p>"Weston," he said, ignoring my mistress, "where is the governor?" I
hurried towards him, and explained that Mr. Hillier was out with Master
John and Miss Katherine; I hoped that if Colonel Edgington happened
to meet them he would be careful to soften down any bad news he had
to communicate. "War is a man's business," he retorted. "All that you
women have to do is to just stand outside the ropes, and look on."
</p><p>"I think you'll find us doing a lot more than that, sir."
</p><p>"Ah," he said, "you mean nursing. Well, we may allow you to take a
share in nursing, but nothing else, mind."
</p><p>"It probably won't rest with either you or me, sir."
</p><p>"It certainly won't rest with you, Weston. If I miss the governor, say
that I am going up to the War Office to-morrow morning early. I shall
most likely catch his train. But I daresay it will slip your memory.
Never met a woman yet who could be depended upon to do as she was
ordered."
</p><p>"Perhaps your experience of them has been limited, sir."
</p><p>"Weston," he said, rolling up the newspaper, and pointing it at me,
"I've often heard it said about here that you were treated as one of
the family. I've denied the statement. I've always pointed out that you
are treated as the head of the family."
</p><hr/>
<p>There was telephoning to and fro, and the local shops were kept in
attendance on the instruments, town establishments were harried and
badgered by the same means of communication. I looked through the stock
room, and at first decided that no great additions were necessary;
if the worst came to the worst, The Croft could stand a siege of
reasonable length, and the kitchen gardens would furnish supplies. But
the shop-people at Sidcup alarmed me, and another housekeeper I met
there induced me to believe I was failing to take wise precautions.
The shop folk spoke of the immense orders they were receiving from
customers who had the fear that either prices would go up with a
tremendous jump, or that articles of food might be unobtainable; my
friend assured me, with gleeful confidence, that whatever happened to
other households in the neighbourhood, her's, at any rate, was safe.
</p><p>"They made me pay cash for everything, Miss Weston," she went on, "but
that was only reasonable. Paper money is not of much use at times like
this. What I'm anxious about is the number of hands that will be thrown
out of work. I told my girls, only to-day, they'll all be starving
before the month is up."
</p><p>"That ought to have pleased them."
</p><p>"We've got to face the facts," she declared, earnestly. "There's not
the slightest use in burying our heads in the sand. Everyone will be
getting rid of servants, and what the poor souls are to do doesn't
bear thinking of. I suppose your people are like the rest, talking of
cutting down expenses."
</p><p>"Hints. Nothing more!"
</p><p>"Fortunately," she said, "I have been able to put by, just as you, no
doubt, have managed to do. Eh?"
</p><p>"I didn't say anything."
</p><p>"And my notion is that when it becomes too hot, I shall rush off to a
quiet place I've got my eye on in Wales where the Germans won't trouble
to come, and if they do, all my money will be safely buried in the
flower garden, and I shall pretend I'm too silly to understand anything
that's said to me."
</p><p>"You'll find that easy enough."
</p><p>"You wouldn't care, I suppose, Miss Weston--I've always had a great
respect for you--to join forces with me, so to speak, and----"
</p><p>"No," promptly. "Got work to do here. Folk to look after."
</p><p>"The time will come," she prophesied, in going, "when you'll want to
kick yourself for not having listened to friendly advice."
</p><p>It occurred to me that even if there existed little risk of a shortage
in supplies, the fact that so many people were making large purchases
might have serious results, and I resolved to concentrate my thoughts
on the subject of flour. Flour became an obsession with me. Flour, for
the space of at least one morning, was the one article that I desired.
I had, the previous night, dreamt of flour; sacks of it, cellar-fulls
of it, and the dream finished with the perturbing discovery that the
bags on being opened contained nothing but wooden shavings. It is
easy enough now to look back upon those very early days of the war,
and to smile at the flurried anxieties and the nervous agitation; I
can say truthfully that, being ordinarily as calm as most people,
I nevertheless caught the epidemic and came as near as I have ever
been to losing my head. My most extravagant act was to induce William
Richards, by wire, to make himself responsible for bringing, whilst
off duty on the Tuesday, two hundred-weight of flour from London; he
conveyed it from the station to The Croft on a luggage trolley.
</p><p>"Your thanks, Mary Weston," he said, "amply repay me, they do, for all
the trouble. Came in, I did, for a fair amount of chaff on the way down
from humorous colleagues of mine, and it's been a warmish business
getting the stuff here, on a day like this, but this glass of cider,
and your kind remarks--"
</p><p>"When I wrote off in a hurry to you last night, I never thought you'd
be able to do it."
</p><p>William finished his glass, and appeared to be forming words in his
mind. Altering the intention, he hummed the first lines of "Auld Lang
Syne."
</p><p>"There's a good deal of extra work going on," he remarked, "with the
railways, and I can't always call my hours my own. But anything I
can do for you, Mary Weston, I'm prepared to do. If I may offer a
suggestion it is that your next orders should be such as not to make my
uniform look quite so dusty."
</p><p>I found a brush and dispersed the white marks. As I went up and down
the sleeve, he took my hand and kissed it, and, at once, rushed from
the kitchen, leaving the second glass that had been poured out for him.
Going down to the tradesmen's gate, I caught sight of William Richards
sprinting along the tarred road, more as one under the impression the
Germans were after him than as though he had given an impetuous sign of
affection.
</p><p>My housekeeper acquaintance was not the only person who held the view
that the war would throw folk out of employment. Everybody seemed to be
furnishing everybody with the same idea. The most cheerful anticipation
was that there were always the workhouses, and in any case the
Government would have to do something. The disturbing fact that, as my
acquaintance hinted, cheques were not being accepted, was, in itself,
enough to startle and to alarm. Master Edward went on his bicycle a
dozen times in the course of the day to pick up news at the station,
and never returned without something like an arm-full; the trouble was
to sift the correct from the undependable, and to keep one's mind clear
of inaccuracies, but appetite for particulars was so keen that nothing
was refused. Our old gardener with whom, owing to his partiality for
alcohol, I had hitherto been on remote terms, appeared flattered to
discover that I listened to his muddle-headed rumours with an attentive
ear.
</p><p>"They do tell me, ma'am," he said, confidentially, "that these 'ere
foreigners drink a kind of beer that don't have no effect on you, like
what our stuff does. Nice cheerful sort of prospect, ain't it, for
those on us that are what you may call settled in our 'abits? Dang my
old eyes," the gardener went on with vehemence, "if it ain't nearly
enough to induce a man to turn teetotal!"
</p><p>Mr. Hillier made no attempt to catch his usual train. Instead of
doing this, or cultivating his hobby in the workshop, he walked up
and down on the lawn, tweed cap at the back of head, and when I sent
Miss Katherine out to him, she returned with the announcement that he
wished to be alone; Master John was similarly repulsed. My nephew had
been asked to stay the night, and he and Master John were consulting
together with serious countenances. Two of the maids came to me with
telegrams, and asked to be permitted to leave at once. In one case a
father belonging to the Naval Reserve had been called out, and the
mother wanted her daughter's company at home; in the other, the girl
wished to say good-bye to her sweetheart, a Territorial who was leaving
with his battalion for a sea coast town. I allowed them to go, and went
to mention the circumstance to Mrs. Hillier. She never objected to any
decision of mine, but I generally kept her informed of anything that
happened.
</p><p>"I was just going out," she said, "to liven your master up, Weston.
If you have a few minutes to spare, you might come with me. I've got
rather a good idea, and you will come in handy to support it. Get the
rose basket, and my leather gloves, and the scissors."
</p><p>No pretence that my mistress adopted would have taken in a fly, and
when she affected to be surprised at discovering her husband on the
lawn, he glanced at her without speaking. She submitted the good idea,
without delay. Mr. Hillier was to take advantage of the brief holiday
from Basinghall Street, and start upon the task of learning to play
golf. "I'd sooner walk about on my head," he declared. She begged him
not to come to a hasty decision, and pointed out first, that no one
walked about on the head; second, that a great many folk did play golf,
and if one could judge by their conversation, found enjoyment in it.
</p><p>"You want something, James," she argued, "to take you out of yourself.
You're getting into a habit of brooding and that never yet did any good
to man, woman or child. Try to follow my example, and take cheerful
views. Think of the people who are worse off than yourself."
</p><p>"I wouldn't mind so much," he said, "if I were twenty years younger."
</p><p>"Now I appeal to you, Weston," she remarked, looking up at me. "Isn't
that a foolish thing to say? Why, if he were twenty years younger he
wouldn't be living in this large house, and these fine grounds, and
with plenty of servants about to do everything that's wanted." The
under-gardener came across to ask some question; I signalled to him to
stay where he was.
</p><p>"The large house," said Mr. Hillier, with deliberation, "and the fine
grounds, and the plenty of servants, will soon be nothing but a memory."
</p><p>"Wandering in his speech," she whispered to me.
</p><p>"It's time," he went on, speaking carefully, "that you knew the truth,
and there's no reason why Weston should not hear it. If it hadn't been
for this war, I might have pulled matters round, but as it is--Well,
I'm done for!"
</p><p>"You've been smoking too much."
</p><p>"My pipe is the only real comfort I have left."
</p><p>"James," she cried, expostulatingly, "you forget me!"
</p><p>"There was a time," he said, "when you were my good companion, but that
takes me back a long, long while ago. And the children are not children
now, and altogether--I beg pardon, my dear. I ought not to be saying
anything likely to hurt."
</p><p>"If matters are so bad, we must try a little economy." Mrs. Hillier had
a sudden inspiration. "I've sent off a couple of the maids already."
</p><p>"You'll have to do more than that."
</p><p>"You don't mean," she cried, alarmedly, "that we shall have to do
without Weston?"
</p><p>He gave a half smile at me; I waited anxiously to hear what he would
say. "We shall have to do without everybody," he said. "It's like
this. I've been working all these years to make money for you and the
kiddies. I've never saved, partly because you gave no help in that
direction, partly because I wanted to look on and see everyone having a
capital time."
</p><p>"How selfish of you, James!" I touched her arm reprovingly.
</p><p>"The sooner we get away from here," he said, "the better for my good
name. I want to keep that because--because it's about all I shall have
left. The only question that's worrying me is this. What sort of a part
are you going to play?"
</p><p>"I shall go," she replied, with an air, "wherever destiny calls me."
</p><p>"Well then," rather doubtfully, "that, I suppose, is all right then.
If you set an example to the children, they'll follow on. Explain it
all to them--or perhaps Weston here will do that, as one of her last
jobs before leaving--and make it clear to them that I'm sorry. And she
might contrive to hint that it isn't altogether my fault."
</p><p>I gave the two gardeners their notice at once. The younger one, it
appeared, wanted to leave and was ready to go instantly; the other who
always made a grievance of everything, took it very ill. "Me just in
the middle of a lot of clearin' up, and now I'm called upon to go and
look for another situation! Hard lines; that's what I call it, miss."
I pointed out that he was not the only person who suffered. "I'm the
only one that interests me," he said, doggedly. "People don't seem
to remember that I'm getting on in years. Be rights, I ought to be
pensioned off, or dumped into an almshouse, or some'ing of the kind."
I reminded him that he was fortunate in having no wife or children.
"There's some advantage in being a bachelor," he agreed, "because
there's no one to nag at you when you reach home at night a bit late,
and a trifle comfortable. On the other hand, you've got no one to 'elp
earn your living for you. And that reminds me. I shall chuck work for
a hower or two, and go along, and take a glass o' beer. Just in order
to stiddy my nerves." He came back later singing, and told one of the
dogs that there were many worlds inferior to this, and that he proposed
to celebrate the occasion by arranging a good old hang-it-all bonfire.
Master John and my nephew had gone from the house (without mentioning
where they were bound for), otherwise I should have asked one of them
to order the elderly chap to go home. I might have done this myself,
but I never care to argue with men when they are in drink. It is
impossible to tell whether they are going to be extremely abusive, or
aggressively affectionate.
</p><p>The master seemed more like himself now that he had made a full
statement of the position. At his request, I went over the house with
the two of them, and we made something like an inventory; I estimated
the prices, and Mr. Hillier was quite cheered when he eventually
reckoned up.
</p><p>"Might have been worse," he said. "The money we've spent hasn't all
been wasted."
</p><p>"I've never bought any furniture," remarked Mrs. Hillier, "without
first taking Weston's advice. She's an excellent judge."
</p><p>"It's hard to be treating her as a criminal," he mentioned, "after all
these years."
</p><p>"Don't you trouble about me, sir," I said.
</p><p>"I foresee," he remarked genially, "that a certain official on the
railway will shortly send in an application for holiday leave, and
passes for himself and wife."
</p><p>"If Richards has got any such idea in his head," I declared sharply,
"he's in for a big disappointment. My intentions are entirely
different."
</p><p>"I must go and find a good auctioneer," he said, "And at once."
</p><p>In this way it happened that when the fire at The Croft broke out,
there were women folk only in the house. For over an hour there had
been a smell of burning, and when I spoke of it, one of the maids said
the old gardener had set light to rubbish, but that the flames were
now out; in the quiet summer evening air the scent remained. It was at
about eight o'clock when the alarm came that the garage was on fire.
Dinner was half over; the ladies were wondering at the delay in the
return of Master John and of Herbert, and hoped they would soon appear
with the latest news. Directly I caught sight of the blaze I recognised
that here was a serious matter, and I ran off to the telephone, and
called up the Brigade. Then I beckoned from the doorway of the dining
room to young Master Edward, told him what had happened, and begged
him to rush around and get together all the able-bodied men he could
find in the neighbourhood. Downstairs the maids were hysterical, and
one had fainted; I spoke to them with an abruptness that made them
come to their senses, and gave directions. I collected hats and coats
belonging to my mistress and the young ladies and, saying that there
was no danger and that the fire would soon burn itself out, told them
to go on the lawn, and to watch for the engine. Miss Muriel began to
talk excitedly and protestingly; her sister and mother interposed.
</p><p>"Weston knows best!" they said.
</p><p>Even if there had been a man about the place, I doubt whether it would
have been possible to save the car. The bemused gardener had set his
mound of rubbish near to the wooden doors, and these were the first to
catch alight. The billiard room was overhead, and when an explosion
came from the garage I knew that nobody would ever play on that table
again. There was not much wind, but all that existed was blowing in the
direction of the house. The master's workshop, where he had spent many
Saturday afternoons, was the next to go.
</p><p>Master Edward (enjoying it all tremendously) ran up the drive with
his party of a dozen men, Colonel Edgington amongst them and clearly
determined to take charge, and to extinguish the fire in his own
style; he gasped out orders that no one could understand, and no one
felt called upon to obey. The men rushed through the dark path at
the side of the house, where Colonel Edgington had the misfortune to
step upon a rake that instantly--as is the habit of rakes when thus
treated--instantly sprang up, and gave him a blow in the face which
put him temporarily out of action. His language included several words
quite new to me.
</p><p>"Pails, Weston!" shouted Master Edward.
</p><p>We had a number of pails but, despite the efforts of the helpers, they
were of little more use than a soda water syphon would have been. For
one thing, the fire was now so scorching that the men could not get
near; the water when thrown fell with a slight hiss and had no other
result. I called them into the house, disregarding Master Edward's
appeal, and asked them to do their best to save the furniture. Their
best, I am willing to admit, was very good. Colonel Edgington came up
the staircase and again endeavoured to assume command: I told him to
go down, and look after the ladies, and keep them out of the way of
the articles that were being flung from the windows. It was no time
for being civil, and it was no time either for careful and delicate
handling of furniture. A cheval glass came down on the sun dial, and
cracked in all directions. Articles in silver from dressing tables
rained upon the grass; a jewel case danced about on the gravel,
distributing its contents. I felt glad to see two constables inside the
gate, keeping back folk who wanted a good view.
</p><p>The house was alight when the fire engine came, and everyone was out,
and gathering up the property that had been strewn around; Mrs. Hillier
and the two young ladies worked as hard as the men, and with the
maids--the early fright over--I had no reason to discover any fault.
Master John and my nephew Herbert arrived when the hose was playing on
the flames; the supply of water, owing to the recent fine weather, was
not too good, and the pond, that might at other times have assisted,
was almost empty. The two young men accepted the condition of affairs
without a word; threw off jackets, and dashed into the task of salvage.
Despite all the efforts it was not a great amount that could be saved:
the fire chased the men from room to room. A drizzling rain came
on, and the lads found tarpaulins and canvas to serve as protection
to the rescued furniture. Colonel Edgington had vanished, and I was
congratulating myself on this, when he returned with his car.
</p><p>"Come along now, Mrs. Hillier," he said, authoritatively. "And the two
girls. And the small boy. And any of the servants who can find room.
I'm going to take you all over to my place, and you'll stay there as
long as you like. Weston," he said to me, "I'll come back for you."
</p><p>"Sorry, sir, if I was rather rude to you, just now."
</p><p>"Rude?" he echoed. "Bless my soul, that was nothing. I'm rather rude to
everybody. But I mean well, Weston: indeed, and I mean well!"
</p><p>The brigade superintendent, making his way across pools of water, at
the finish, asked me whether the house and the fittings were insured,
and I said, "Why, of course!" The men assisted in returning furniture
to the two or three rooms that had not been touched by the fire. The
beer cask in the cellar was safe, and I told them to find tumblers and
help themselves. Master John and my Herbert came up to me, so begrimed
that I kissed Master John by mistake; he declared it was a full sixteen
years since I had thought of paying him such an attention.
</p><p>"Wish we had been here at the start," he remarked. "We should have
been, only that there were so many others waiting to enlist."
</p><p>"Others?"
</p><p>"We've both joined," he announced. "Is that the governor out in the
road?"
</p><p>Mr. Hillier was gazing at the damaged house. We went across, and I put
the question to him that the superintendent had put to me. He mentioned
that he had experienced a difficulty in finding the auctioneer, and was
describing this at some length when I repeated the inquiry.
</p><p>"I wish you'd tell me, sir, about the insurance," I begged. "Just yes
or no."
</p><p>"The answer is no, Weston," he replied, in a quiet voice. "I allowed
the policy to lapse at midsummer in order to give the job to a hard-up
man who was starting as an agent. I heard last week he had disappeared."
</p><p>"You don't seem very much upset about the fire."
</p><p>"Dreamt that it happened," said Mr. Hillier, "these three nights past."
He turned to his son. "Anything fresh about the war, my lad?"
