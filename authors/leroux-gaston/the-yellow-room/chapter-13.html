<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>A week after the occurrence of the events I have just recounted&mdash;on
the 2nd of November, to be exact &mdash;I received at my home
in Paris the following telegraphic message: "Come to the Glandier
by the earliest train. Bring revolvers. Friendly greetings. Rouletabille."</p>

<p>I have already said, I think, that at that period, being a young
barrister with but few briefs, I frequented the Palais de Justice
rather for the purpose of familiarising myself with my professional
duties than for the defence of the widow and orphan. I could,
therefore, feel no surprise at Rouletabille disposing of my time.
Moreover, he knew how keenly interested I was in his journalistic
adventures in general and, above all, in the murder at the Glandier.
I had not heard from him for a week, nor of the progress made
with that mysterious case, except by the innumerable paragraphs
in the newspapers and by the very brief notes of Rouletabille
in the "Epoque." Those notes had divulged the fact that traces
of human blood had been found on the mutton-bone, as well as fresh
traces of the blood of Mademoiselle Stangerson&mdash;the old stains
belonged to other crimes, probably dating years back.</p>

<p>It may be easily imagined that the crime engaged the attention
of the press throughout the world. No crime known had more absorbed
the minds of people. It appeared to me, however, that the judicial
inquiry was making but very little progress; and I should have
been very glad, if, on the receipt of my friend’s invitation to
rejoin him at the Glandier, the despatch had not contained the
words, "Bring revolvers."</p>

<p>That puzzled me greatly. Rouletabille telegraphing for revolvers
meant that there might be occasion to use them. Now, I confess
it without shame, I am not a hero. But here was a friend, evidently
in danger, calling on me to go to his aid. I did not hesitate
long; and after assuring myself that the only revolver I possessed
was properly loaded, I hurried towards the Orleans station. On
the way I remembered that Rouletabille had asked for two revolvers;
I therefore entered a gunsmith’s shop and bought an excellent
weapon for my friend.</p>

<p>I had hoped to find him at the station at Epinay; but he was
not there. However, a cab was waiting for me and I was soon at
the Glandier. Nobody was at the gate, and it was only on the threshold
of the chateau that I met the young man. He saluted me with a
friendly gesture and threw his arms about me, inquiring warmly
as to the state of my health.</p>

<p>When we were in the little sitting-room of which I have spoken,
Rouletabille made me sit down.</p>

<p>"It’s going badly," he said.</p>

<p>"What’s going badly?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>He came nearer to me and whispered:</p>

<p>"Frederic Larsan is working with might and main against Darzac."</p>

<p>This did not astonish me. I had seen the poor show Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s fiance had made at the time of the examination of
the footprints. However, I immediately asked:</p>

<p>"What about that cane?"</p>

<p>"It is still in the hands of Frederic Larsan. He never lets go
of it."</p>

<p>"But doesn’t it prove the alibi for Monsieur Darzac?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Gently questioned by me, Darzac denied having, on
that evening, or on any other, purchased a cane at Cassette’s.
However,"  said Rouletabille, "I’ll not swear to anything; Monsieur
Darzac has such strange fits of silence that one does not know
exactly what to think of what he says."</p>

<p>"To Frederic Larsan this cane must mean a piece of very damaging
evidence. But in what way? The time when it was bought shows it
could not have been in the murderer’s possession."</p>

<p>"The time doesn’t worry Larsan. He is not obliged to adopt my
theory which assumes that the murderer got into "The Yellow Room"
between five and six o’clock. But there’s nothing to prevent him
assuming that the murderer got in between ten and eleven o’clock
at night. At that hour Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson, assisted
by Daddy Jacques, were engaged in making an interesting chemical
experiment in the part of the laboratory taken up by the furnaces.
Larsan says, unlikely as that may seem, that the murderer may
have slipped behind them. He has already got the examining magistrate
to listen to him. When one looks closely into it, the reasoning
is absurd, seeing that the ‘intimate’&mdash;if there is one&mdash;must have
known that the professor would shortly leave the pavilion, and
that the ‘friend’ had only to put off operating till after the
professor’s departure. Why should he have risked crossing the
laboratory while the professor was in it? And then, when he had
got into "The Yellow Room"?</p>

<p>"There are many points to be cleared up before Larsan’s theory
can be admitted. I sha’n’t waste my time over it, for my theory
won’t allow me to occupy myself with mere imagination. Only, as
I am obliged for the moment to keep silent, and Larsan sometimes
talks, he may finish by coming out openly against Monsieur Darzac,&mdash;if
I’m not there," added the young reporter proudly. "For there are
surface evidences against Darzac, much more convincing than that
cane, which remains incomprehensible to me, all the more so as
Larsan does not in the least hesitate to let Darzac see him with
it! &mdash;I understand many things in Larsan’s theory, but I
can’t make anything of that cane.</p>

<p>"Is he still at the chateau?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he hardly ever leaves it! &mdash;He sleeps there, as I
do, at the request of Monsieur Stangerson, who has done for him
what Monsieur Robert Darzac has done for me. In spite of the accusation
made by Larsan that Monsieur Stangerson knows who the murderer
is he yet affords him every facility for arriving at the truth,&mdash;just
as Darzac is doing for me."</p>

<p>"But you are convinced of Darzac’s innocence?"</p>

<p>"At one time I did believe in the possibility of his guilt. That
was when we arrived here for the first time. The time has come
for me to tell you what has passed between Monsieur Darzac and
myself."</p>

<p>Here Rouletabille interrupted himself and asked me if I had brought
the revolvers. I showed him them. Having examined both, he pronounced
them excellent, and handed them back to me.</p>

<p>"Shall we have any use for them?" I asked.</p>

<p>"No doubt; this evening. We shall pass the night here&mdash;if that
won’t tire you?"</p>

<p>"On the contrary," I said with an expression that made Rouletabille
laugh.</p>

<p>"No, no," he said, "this is no time for laughing. You remember
the phrase which was the ‘open sesame’ of this chateau full of
mystery?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, "perfectly,&mdash;‘The presbytery has lost nothing
of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.’ It was the phrase
which you found on the half-burned piece of paper amongst the
ashes in the laboratory."</p>

<p>"Yes; at the bottom of the paper, where the flame had not reached,
was this date: 23rd of October. Remember this date, it is highly
important. I am now going to tell you about that curious phrase.
On the evening before the crime, that is to say, on the 23rd,
Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson were at a reception at the
Elysee. I know that, because I was there on duty, having to interview
one of the savants of the Academy of Philadelphia, who was being
feted there. I had never before seen either Monsieur or Mademoiselle
Stangerson. I was seated in the room which precedes the Salon
des Ambassadeurs, and, tired of being jostled by so many noble
personages, I had fallen into a vague reverie, when I scented
near me the perfume of the lady in black.</p>

<p>"Do you ask me what is the ‘perfume of the lady in black’? It
must suffice for you to know that it is a perfume of which I am
very fond, because it was that of a lady who had been very kind
to me in my childhood,&mdash;a lady whom I had always seen dressed
in black. The lady who, that evening, was scented with the perfume
of the lady in black, was dressed in white. She was wonderfully
beautiful. I could not help rising and following her. An old man
gave her his arm and, as they passed, I heard voices say: ‘Professor
Stangerson and his daughter.’ It was in that way I learned who
it was I was following.</p>

<p>"They met Monsieur Robert Darzac, whom I knew by sight. Professor
Stangerson, accosted by Mr. Arthur William Rance, one of the American
savants, seated himself in the great gallery, and Monsieur Robert
Darzac led Mademoiselle Stangerson into the conservatory. I followed.
The weather was very mild that evening; the garden doors were
open. Mademoiselle Stangerson threw a fichu shawl over her shoulders
and I plainly saw that it was she who was begging Monsieur Darzac
to go with her into the garden. I continued to follow, interested
by the agitation plainly exhibited by the bearing of Monsieur
Darzac. They slowly passed along the wall abutting on the Avenue
Marigny. I took the central alley, walking parallel with them,
and then crossed over for the purpose of getting nearer to them.
The night was dark, and the grass deadened the sound of my steps.
They had stopped under the vacillating light of a gas jet and
appeared to be both bending over a paper held by Mademoiselle
Stangerson, reading something which deeply interested them. I
stopped in the darkness and silence.</p>

<p>"Neither of them saw me, and I distinctly heard Mademoiselle
Stangerson repeat, as she was refolding the paper: ‘The presbytery
has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness!’
&mdash;It was said in a tone at once mocking and despairing, and
was followed by a burst of such nervous laughter that I think
her words will never cease to sound in my ears. But another phrase
was uttered by Monsieur Robert Darzac: ‘Must I commit a crime,
then, to win you?’ He was in an extraordinarily agitated state.
He took the hand of Mademoiselle Stangerson and held it for a
long time to his lips, and I thought, from the movement of his
shoulders, that he was crying. Then they went away.</p>

<p>"When I returned to the great gallery," continued Rouletabille,
"I saw no more of Monsieur Robert Darzac, and I was not to see
him again until after the tragedy at the Glandier. Mademoiselle
was near Mr. Rance, who was talking with much animation, his eyes,
during the conversation, glowing with a singular brightness. Mademoiselle
Stangerson, I thought, was not even listening to what he was saying,
her face expressing perfect indifference. His face was the red
face of a drunkard. When Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson
left, he went to the bar and remained there. I joined him, and
rendered him some little service in the midst of the pressing
crowd. He thanked me and told me he was returning to America three
days later, that is to say, on the 26th (the day after the crime).
I talked with him about Philadelphia; he told me he had lived
there for five-and-twenty years, and that it was there he had
met the illustrious Professor Stangerson and his daughter. He
drank a great deal of champagne, and when I left him he was very
nearly drunk.</p>

<p>"Such were my experiences on that evening, and I leave you to
imagine what effect the news of the attempted murder of Mademoiselle
Stangerson produced on me,&mdash;with what force those words pronounced
by Monsieur Robert Darzac, ‘Must I commit a crime, then, to win
you?’ recurred to me. It was not this phrase, however, that I
repeated to him, when we met here at Glandier. The sentence of
the presbytery and the bright garden sufficed to open the gate
of the chateau. If you ask me if I believe now that Monsieur Darzac
is the murderer, I must say I do not. I do not think I ever quite
thought that. At the time I could not really think seriously of
anything. I had so little evidence to go on. But I needed to have
at once the proof that he had not been wounded in the hand.</p>

<p>"When we were alone together, I told him how I had chanced to
overhear a part of his conversation with Mademoiselle Stangerson
in the garden of the Elysee; and when I repeated to him the words,
‘Must I commit a crime, then, to win you?’ he was greatly troubled,
though much less so than he had been by hearing me repeat the
phrase about the presbytery. What threw him into a state of real
consternation was to learn from me that the day on which he had
gone to meet Mademoiselle Stangerson at the Elysee, was the very
day on which she had gone to the Post Office for the letter. It
was that letter, perhaps, which ended with the words: ‘The presbytery
has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness.’
My surmise was confirmed by my finding, if you remember, in the
ashes of the laboratory, the fragment of paper dated October the
23rd. The letter had been written and withdrawn from the Post
Office on the same day.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt that, on returning from the Elysee that
night, Mademoiselle Stangerson had tried to destroy that compromising
paper. It was in vain that Monsieur Darzac denied that that letter
had anything whatever to do with the crime. I told him that in
an affair so filled with mystery as this, he had no right to hide
this letter; that I was persuaded it was of considerable importance;
that the desperate tone in which Mademoiselle Stangerson had pronounced
the prophetic phrase,&mdash;that his own tears, and the threat of a
crime which he had professed after the letter was read&mdash;all these
facts tended to leave no room for me to doubt. Monsieur Darzac
became more and more agitated, and I determined to take advantage
of the effect I had produced on him. ‘You were on the point of
being married, Monsieur,’ I said negligently and without looking
at him, ‘and suddenly your marriage becomes impossible because
of the writer of that letter; because as soon as his letter was
read, you spoke of the necessity for a crime to win Mademoiselle
Stangerson. Therefore there is someone between you and her&mdash;someone
who is preventing your marriage with her&mdash;someone who has attempted
to kill her, so that she should not be able to marry!’ And I concluded
with these words: ‘Now, monsieur, you have only to tell me in
confidence the name of the murderer!’ &mdash;The words I had uttered
must have struck him ominously, for when I turned my eyes on him,
I saw that his face was haggard, the perspiration standing on
his forehead, and terror showing in his eyes.</p>

<p>"‘Monsieur,’ he said to me, ‘I am going to ask of you something
which may appear insane, but in exchange for which I place my
life in your hands. You must not tell the magistrates of what
you saw and heard in the garden of the Elysee,&mdash;neither to them
nor to anybody. I swear to you, that I am innocent, and I know,
I feel, that you believe me; but I would rather be taken for the
guilty man than see justice go astray on that phrase, "The presbytery
has lost nothing of its charm, nor the garden its brightness."
The judges must know nothing about that phrase. All this matter
is in your hands. Monsieur, I leave it there; but forget the evening
at the Elysee. A hundred other roads are open to you in your search
for the criminal. I will open them for you myself. I will help
you. Will you take up your quarters here? &mdash;You may remain
here to do as you please. &mdash;Eat&mdash;sleep here&mdash;watch my actions&mdash;the
actions of all here. You shall be master of the Glandier, Monsieur;
but forget the evening at the Elysee.’"</p>

<p>Rouletabille here paused to take breath. I now understood what
had appeared so unexplainable in the demeanour of Monsieur Robert
Darzac towards my friend, and the facility with which the young
reporter had been able to install himself on the scene of the
crime. My curiosity could not fail to be excited by all I had
heard. I asked Rouletabille to satisfy it still further. What
had happened at the Glandier during the past week? &mdash;Had
he not told me that there were surface indications against Monsieur
Darzac much more terrible than that of the cane found by Larsan?</p>

<p>"Everything seems to be pointing against him," replied my friend,
"and the situation is becoming exceedingly grave. Monsieur Darzac
appears not to mind it much; but in that he is wrong. I was interested
only in the health of Mademoiselle Stangerson, which was daily
improving, when something occurred that is even more mysterious
than&mdash;than the mystery of "The Yellow Room"!"</p>

<p>"Impossible!" I cried, "What could be more mysterious than that?"</p>

<p>"Let us first go back to Monsieur Robert Darzac," said Rouletabille,
calming me. "I have said that everything seems to be pointing
against him. The marks of the neat boots found by Frederic Larsan
appear to be really the footprints of Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
fiance. The marks made by the bicycle may have been made by his
bicycle. He had usually left it at the chateau; why did he take
it to Paris on that particular occasion? Was it because he was
not going to return again to the chateau? Was it because, owing
to the breaking off of his marriage, his relations with the Stangersons
were to cease? All who are interested in the matter affirm that
those relations were to continue unchanged.</p>

<p>"Frederic Larsan, however, believes that all relations were at
an end. From the day when Monsieur Darzac accompanied Mademoiselle
Stangerson to the Grands Magasins de la Louvre until the day after
the crime, he had not been at the Glandier. Remember that Mademoiselle
Stangerson lost her reticule containing the key with the brass
head while she was in his company. From that day to the evening
at the Elysee, the Sorbonne professor and Mademoiselle Stangerson
did not see one another; but they may have written to each other.
Mademoiselle Stangerson went to the Post Office to get a letter,
which Larsan says was written by Robert Darzac; for knowing nothing
of what had passed at the Elysee, Larsan believes that it was
Monsieur Darzac himself who stole the reticule with the key, with
the design of forcing her consent, by getting possession of the
precious papers of her father&mdash;papers which he would have restored
to him on condition that the marriage engagement was to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>"All that would have been a very doubtful and almost absurd hypothesis,
as Larsan admitted to me, but for another and much graver circumstance.
In the first place here is something which I have not been able
to explain &mdash;Monsieur Darzac had himself, on the 24th, gone
to the Post Office to ask for the letter which Mademoiselle had
called for and received on the previous evening. The description
of the man who made application tallies in every respect with
the appearance of Monsieur Darzac, who, in answer to the questions
put to him by the examining magistrate, denies that he went to
the Post Office. Now even admitting that the letter was written
by him&mdash;which I do not believe&mdash;he knew that Mademoiselle Stangerson
had received it, since he had seen it in her hands in the garden
at the Elysee. It could not have been he, then, who had gone to
the Post Office, the day after the 24th, to ask for a letter which
he knew was no longer there.</p>

<p>"To me it appears clear that somebody, strongly resembling him,
stole Mademoiselle Stangerson’s reticule and in that letter, had
demanded of her something which she had not sent him. He must
have been surprised at the failure of his demand, hence his application
at the Post Office, to learn whether his letter had been delivered
to the person to whom it had been addressed. Finding that it had
been claimed, he had become furious. What had he demanded? Nobody
but Mademoiselle Stangerson knows. Then, on the day following,
it is reported that she had been attacked during the night, and,
the next day, I discovered that the Professor had, at the same
time, been robbed by means of the key referred to in the poste
restante letter. It would seem, then, that the man who went to
the Post Office to inquire for the letter must have been the murderer.
All these arguments Larsan applies as against Monsieur Darzac.
You may be sure that the examining magistrate, Larsan, and myself,
have done our best to get from the Post Office precise details
relative to the singular personage who applied there on the 24th
of October. But nothing has been learned. We don’t know where
he came from&mdash;or where he went. Beyond the description which makes
him resemble Monsieur Darzac, we know nothing.</p>

<p>"I have announced in the leading journals that a handsome reward
will be given to a driver of any public conveyance who drove a
fare to No. 40, Post Office, about ten o’clock on the morning
of the 24th of October. Information to be addressed to ‘M. R.,’
at the office of the ‘Epoque’; but no answer has resulted. The
man may have walked; but, as he was most likely in a hurry, there
was a chance that he might have gone in a cab. Who, I keep asking
myself night and day, is the man who so strongly resembles Monsieur
Robert Darzac, and who is also known to have bought the cane which
has fallen into Larsan’s hands?</p>

<p>"The most serious fact is that Monsieur Darzac was, at the very
same time that his double presented himself at the Post Office,
scheduled for a lecture at the Sorbonne. He had not delivered
that lecture, and one of his friends took his place. When I questioned
him as to how he had employeeed the time, he told me that he had
gone for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne. What do you think of
a professor who, instead of giving his lecture, obtains a substitute
to go for a stroll in the Bois de Boulogne? When Frederic Larsan
asked him for information on this point, he quietly replied that
it was no business of his how he spent his time in Paris. On which
Fred swore aloud that he would find out, without anybody’s help.</p>

<p>"All this seems to fit in with Fred’s hypothesis, namely, that
Monsieur Stangerson allowed the murderer to escape in order to
avoid a scandal. The hypothesis is further substantiated by the
fact that Darzac was in "The Yellow Room" and was permitted to
get away. That hypothesis I believe to be a false one. &mdash;Larsan
is being misled by it, though that would not displease me, did
it not affect an innocent person. Now does that hypothesis really
mislead Frederic Larsan? That is the question&mdash;that is the question."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is right," I cried, interrupting Rouletabille. "Are
you sure that Monsieur Darzac is innocent? &mdash;It seems to
me that these are extraordinary coincidences&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coincidences," replied my friend, "are the worst enemies to
truth."</p>

<p>"What does the examining magistrate think now of the matter?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur de Marquet hesitates to accuse Monsieur Darzac, in
the absence of absolute proofs. Not only would he have public
opinion wholly against him, to say nothing of the Sorbonne, but
Monsieur and Mademoiselle Stangerson. She adores Monsieur Robert
Darzac. Indistinctly as she saw the murderer, it would be hard
to make the public believe that she could not have recognised
him, if Darzac had been the criminal. No doubt The "Yellow Room"
was very dimly lit; but a night-light, however small, gives some
light. Here, my boy, is how things stood when, three days, or
rather three nights ago, an extraordinarily strange incident occurred."</p>
