<p>Critically, in the glasses of Mr. Bojanus’s fitting-room, Gumbril
examined his profile, his back view. Inflated, the Patent Small-Clothes
bulged, bulged decidedly, though with a certain gracious opulence
that might, in a person of the other sex, have seemed only deliciously
natural. In him, however, Gumbril had to admit, the opulence seemed
a little misplaced and paradoxical. Still, if one has to suffer
in order to be beautiful, one must also expect to be ugly in order
not to suffer. Practically, the trousers were a tremendous success.
He sat down heavily on the hard wooden bench of the fitting-room
and was received as though on a lap of bounding resiliency; the
Patent Small-Clothes, there was no doubt, would be proof even
against marble. And the coat, he comforted himself, would mask
with its skirts the too decided bulge. Or if it didn’t, well,
there was no help for it. One must resign oneself to bulging,
that was all.</p>

<p>"Very nice," he declared at last.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus, who had been watching his client in silence and
with a polite but also, Gumbril could not help feeling, a somewhat
ironical smile, coughed. "It depends," he said, "precisely what
you mean by ‘nice.’" He cocked his head on one side, and the fine
waxed end of his moustache was like a pointer aimed up at some
remote star.</p>

<p>Gumbril said nothing, but catching sight once more of his own
side view, nodded a dubious agreement.</p>

<p>"If by nice," continued Mr. Bojanus, "you mean comfortable, well
and good. If, however, you mean elegant, then, Mr. Gumbril, I
fear I must disagree."</p>

<p>"But elegance," said Gumbril, feebly playing the philosopher,
"is only relative, Mr. Bojanus. There are certain African negroes,
among whom it is considered elegant to pierce the lips and distend
them with wooden plates, until the mouth looks like a pelican’s
beak."</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus placed his hand in his bosom and slightly bowed.
"Very possibly, Mr. Gumbril," he replied. "But if you’ll pardon
my saying so, we are not African negroes."</p>

<p>Gumbril was crushed, deservedly. He looked at himself again in
the mirrors. "Do you object," he asked after a pause, "to all
eccentricities in dress, Mr. Bojanus? Would you put us all into
your elegant uniform?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied Mr. Bojanus. "There are certain walks
of life in which eccentricity in appearance is positively a <em>sine
qua non</em>, Mr. Gumbril, and I might almost say <em>de rigueur</em>."</p>

<p>"And which walks of life, Mr. Bojanus, may I ask? You refer,
perhaps, to the artistic walks? Sombreros and Byronic collars
and possibly velveteen trousers? Though all that sort of thing
is surely a little out of date, nowadays."</p>

<p>Enigmatically Mr. Bojanus smiled, a playful Sphinx. He thrust
his right hand deeper into his bosom and with his left twisted
to a finer needle the point of his moustache. "Not artists, Mr.
Gumbril." He shook his head. "In practice they may show themselves
a little eccentric and negleejay. But they have no need to look
unusual on principle. It’s only the politicians who need do it
on principle. It’s only <em>de rigueur</em>, as one might say,
in the political walks, Mr. Gumbril."</p>

<p>"You surprise me," said Gumbril. "I should have thought that
it was to the politician’s interest to look respectable and normal."</p>

<p>"But it is still more to his interest as a leader of men to look
distinguished," Mr. Bojanus replied. "Well, not precisely distinguished,"
he corrected himself, "because that implies that politicians look
<em>distangay</em>, which I regret to say, Mr. Gumbril, they very
often don’t. Distinguishable, is more what I mean."</p>

<p>"Eccentricity is their badge of office?" suggested Gumbril. He
sat down luxuriously on the Patent Small-Clothes.</p>

<p>"That’s more like it," said Mr. Bojanus, tilting his moustaches.
"The leader has got to look different from the other ones. In
the good old days they always wore their official badges. The
leader ’ad his livery, like every one else, to show who he was.
That was sensible, Mr. Gumbril. Nowadays he has no badge—at least
not for ordinary occasions—for I don’t count Privy Councillors’
uniforms and all that sort of once-a-year fancy dress. ’E’s reduced
to dressing in some eccentric way or making the most of the peculiarities
of ’is personal appearance. A very ’apazard method of doing things,
Mr. Gumbril, very ’apazard."</p>

<p>Gumbril agreed.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus went on, making small, neat gestures as he spoke.
"Some of them," he said, "wear ’uge collars, like Mr. Gladstone.
Some wear orchids and eyeglasses, like Joe Chamberlain. Some let
their ’air grow, like Lloyd George. Some wear curious ’ats, like
Winston Churchill. Some put on black shirts, like this Mussolini,
and some put on red ones, like Garibaldi. Some turn up their moustaches,
like the German Emperor. Some turn them down, like Clemenceau.
Some grow whiskers, like Tirpitz. I don’t speak of all the uniforms,
orders, ornaments, ’ead-dresses, feathers, crowns, buttons, tattooings,
ear-rings, sashes, swords, trains, tiaras, urims, thummims and
what not, Mr. Gumbril, that ’ave been used in the past and in
other parts of the world to distinguish the leader. We, ’oo know
our ’istory, Mr. Gumbril, we know all about that."</p>

<p>Gumbril made a deprecating gesture. "You speak for yourself,
Mr. Bojanus," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus bowed.</p>

<p>"Pray continue," said Gumbril.</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus bowed again. "Well, Mr. Gumbril," he said, "the point
of all these things, as I’ve already remarked, is to make the
leader look different, so that ’e can be recognized at the first
<em>coop d’oil</em>, as you might say, by the ’erd ’e ’appens
to be leading. For the ’uman ’erd, Mr. Gumbril, is an ’erd which
can’t do without a leader. Sheep, for example: I never noticed
that they ’ad a leader; nor rooks. Bees, on the other ’and, I
take it, ’ave. At least when they’re swarming. Correct me, Mr.
Gumbril, if I’m wrong. Natural ’istory was never, as you might
say, my <em>forty</em>."</p>

<p>"Nor mine," protested Gumbril.</p>

<p>"As for elephants and wolves, Mr. Gumbril, I can’t pretend to
speak of them with first-’and knowledge. Nor llamas, nor locusts,
nor squab pigeons, nor lemmings. But ’uman beings, Mr. Gumbril,
those I can claim to talk of with authority, if I may say so in
all modesty, and not as the scribes. I ’ave made a special study
of them, Mr. Gumbril. And my profession ’as brought me into contact
with very numerous specimens."</p>

<p>Gumbril could not help wondering where precisely in Mr. Bojanus’s
museum he himself had his place.</p>

<p>"The ’uman ’erd," Mr. Bojanus went on, "must have a leader. And
a leader must have something to distinguish him from the ’erd.
It’s important for ’is interests that he should be recognized
easily. See a baby reaching out of a bath and you immediately
think of Pears’ Soap; see the white ’air waving out behind and
think of Lloyd George. That’s the secret. But in my opinion, Mr.
Gumbril, the old system was much more sensible, give them regular
uniforms and badges, I say; make Cabinet Ministers wear feathers
in their ’air. Then the people will be looking to a real fixed
symbol of leadership, not to the peculiarities of the mere individuals.
Beards and ’air and funny collars change; but a good uniform is
always the same. Give them feathers, that’s what I say, Mr. Gumbril.
Feathers will increase the dignity of the State and lessen the
importance of the individual. And that," concluded Mr. Bojanus
with emphasis, "that, Mr. Gumbril, will be all to the good."</p>

<p>"But you don’t mean to tell me," said Gumbril, "that if I chose
to show myself to the multitude in my inflated trousers, I could
become a leader—do you?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said Mr. Bojanus. "You’d ’ave to ’ave the talent for
talking and ordering people about, to begin with. Feathers wouldn’t
give the genius, but they’d magnify the effect of what there was."</p>

<p>Gumbril got up and began to divest himself of the Small-Clothes.
He unscrewed the valve and the air whistled out, dyingly. He too
sighed. "Curious," he said pensively, "that I’ve never felt the
need for a leader. I’ve never met any one I felt I could whole-heartedly
admire or believe in, never any one I wanted to follow. It must
be pleasant, I should think, to hand oneself over to somebody
else. It must give you a warm, splendid, comfortable feeling."</p>

<p>Mr. Bojanus smiled and shook his head. "You and I, Mr. Gumbril,"
he said, "we’re not the sort of people to be impressed with feathers
or even by talking and ordering about. We may not be leaders ourselves.
But at any rate we aren’t the ’erd."</p>

<p>"Not the main herd, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Not any ’erd," Mr. Bojanus insisted proudly.</p>

<p>Gumbril shook his head dubiously and buttoned up his trousers.
He was not sure, now he came to think of it, that he didn’t belong
to all the herds—by a sort of honorary membership and temporarily,
as occasion offered, as one belongs to the Union at the sister
university or to the Naval and Military Club while one’s own is
having its annual clean-out. Shearwater’s herd, Lypiatt’s herd,
Mr. Mercaptan’s herd, Mrs. Viveash’s herd, the architectural herd
of his father, the educational herd (but that, thank God! was
now bleating on distant pastures), the herd of Mr. Bojanus—he
belonged to them all a little, to none of them completely. Nobody
belonged to his herd. How could they? No chameleon can live with
comfort on a tartan. He put on his coat.</p>

<p>"I’ll send the garments this evening," said Mr. Bojanus. Gumbril
left the shop. At the theatrical wig-maker’s in Leicester Square
he ordered a blond fan-shaped beard to match his own hair and
moustache. He would, at any rate, be his own leader; he would
wear a badge, a symbol of authority. And Coleman had said that
there were dangerous relations to be entered into by the symbol’s
aid.</p>

<p>Ah, now he was provisionally a member of Coleman’s herd. It was
all very depressing. </p>
