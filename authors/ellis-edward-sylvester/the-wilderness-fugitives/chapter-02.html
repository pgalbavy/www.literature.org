<p>At the mention of suspected danger, Clinton sprang up and moved
in the direction whence he supposed it came, though he heard nothing
of it himself. It was so dark that he could see but a little way
in the woods. After stealing a few paces, rifle in hand, he paused
and listened, thinking that if any enemies were at hand, they
would be sure to betray themselves by attempting to advance. But
the stillness remained unbroken, and he suspected that Rosa had
been mistaken. Even though he knew not where Jo and the Mohawk
were just then, he was sure that they were at no great distance,
and the redskin was certain to discover the approach of any foe.
When five or ten minutes passed he turned about and rejoined his
fair friend.</p>

<p>"You must have been in error," said he.</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> mistaken," she said, with a laugh; "and I was
on the point of calling and telling you what it was."</p>

<p>"Well, what was it?"</p>

<p>"Lena-Wingo; he was here a minute ago, and said he had come to
see if all was right, after which he went back to where Jo is
waiting for him."</p>

<p>"How long before they will be here again?"</p>

<p>"Not very long," said Rosa. "He told me they were not quite ready
to start, but would be shortly; he made a little noise when he
was coming, so as to let us know he was near!"</p>

<p>"And I didn't hear him. If it hadn't been for you, he would have
come right upon us."</p>

<p>Ned sat down on the fallen tree beside Rosa. Somehow or other,
the space between the two was reduced almost to no space at all.
It may have been that the young scout was so absent-minded, that
he forgot about the respectable gap that existed a short time
before. But be that as it may, Rosa herself was so absent-minded,
also, that she forgot to remind him of it. So they sat, so near
that they could afford to understand each other without speaking
above a whisper.</p>

<p>Having resumed his seat, Ned sat a while trying to think of something
appropriate to say, but it seemed that all his ideas were scattered
to the winds. When that interruption broke in upon them, he flattered
himself that he was getting along very well&mdash;that is, for him&mdash;but
now&mdash;why, he was never so put to it in all his life. If the innocent
cause of all this misery had not come to his relief, there is
no telling how long the oppressive silence would have lasted.
But Rosa was merciful, or else she became tired of waiting.</p>

<p>"Edward," said she, in that low, winning voice that was hers
alone, "when Colonel Butler and his Tories and Indians leave the
valley, what are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Whatever seems the best for our country. I cannot exactly say
what that will be, but I have thought I would join the Continental
Army under Washington. I so love and revere that great man, that
I can fight better if near him, where I can see his face and hear
his voice now and then."</p>

<p>"I have often thought the same thing myself, but I have never
seen him. Lena-Wingo told me that he has spoken to him many times,
and he looks upon him as if he were some one sent by the Great
Spirit to save our country."</p>

<p>"He means Heaven when he speaks of the Great Spirit, and he is
right; for he is the man of all others to carry the colonies to
their independence."</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen Washington?"</p>

<p>"No. That great pleasure is before me. But I have talked with
many who have, and they have raised my eagerness to the highest
point. But," he added, more thoughtfully, "it would not be right
for me to go to his army and enlist just to fight under him, when
I may be needed somewhere else!"</p>

<p>"You cannot go anywhere that you will not be needed," said Rosa,
in the same thoughtful voice. "There are too many Tories and Britons,
and too few patriots, in this country. If ever I wished that I
was a man it is now, that I might shoulder a musket, and help
fight the battles of my country."</p>

<p>"That you cannot do, of course, but you can encourage all who
are at home and able to bear a hand to do so; if I were the greatest
coward that ever lived, your words would drive me into the army,
for it would take more courage to brave them than to face the
cannon's mouth, or cross bayonets with the British regulars."</p>

<p>"You seem to place great value on my counsel, Edward."</p>

<p>"So I do; I would rather die than displease you in anything."</p>

<p>These fervent words were uttered in a low, earnest tone, that
Ned would not have dared to use a few minutes before, when he
first took his seat so close to the idol of his heart. As was
perhaps natural, it was the girl who seemed never to lose her
self-command, and who parried every attempt to broach the subject
that was evidently clamoring for utterance in the heart of the
youth.</p>

<p>"Well, if you value my opinion so highly," she answered, in that
half-frivolous and half-serious tone that was especially tantalizing
to one of his ardent temperament, "I shall be very careful of
the advice I give."</p>

<p>"You couldn't advise me to do anything except that which is best
for myself and country."</p>

<p>"I can reply as you did a moment ago&mdash;that I could easily do
so, but I have no intention of trying it. Jo tells me that you
and he are to go together?"</p>

<p>"Of course we shall. We have been friends all our lives, and
we may as well stick together in the army."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that, for it has many advantages&mdash;but why
talk of those things now?"</p>

<p>The girl looked around in the darkness, as if she wondered at
the continued absence of Lena-Wingo and her brother.</p>

<p>"I am half tempted to lose my patience with Jack!" she said,
after a minute of waiting and listening. "He doesn't seem to be
in a hurry at all; we ought to have been in Wilkesbarre before
daylight this morning, and here it is dark again, and there is
no telling when he will be ready to start."</p>

<p>"I have no fear of the Mohawk," replied Ned, who thought they
might find a much more interesting subject to talk about. "He
will be here in due time, and is sure to do his part in whatever
needs to be done. I think he has gone in search of that supply
of food he was talking about a while ago. When he gets it he will
bring us a good supper, which will not come amiss to any of us,
although I should have preferred to eat it in Wilkesbarre."</p>

<p>"We may as well content ourselves here until Jack is ready,"
said Ned, keeping his seat as close to Rosa as he conveniently
could. "Until then, remember that I am here, ready to defend you
with my life."</p>

<p>"I know you would, Edward," she responded in a softer, tenderer
voice than the last few words had been spoken. "But I do not want
to see the occasion come."</p>

<p>"I should welcome it, Rosa, to prove my devotion to you."</p>

<p>"I need no proof," she answered, speaking so low that he barely
caught the words.</p>

<p>"How happy your words have made me! Hello! here comes some one
at last!"</p>
