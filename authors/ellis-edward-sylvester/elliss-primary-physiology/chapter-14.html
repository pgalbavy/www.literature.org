<p>This little book is not intended to take the place of the physician,
but is meant to help you to get along without him. We are all
liable to accidents, and you should know what to do in such cases,
before the doctor reaches you. Besides, you can often help yourself,
and will not need the doctor.</p>

<em>HABITS TO CULTIVATE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Cultivate regularity in all good habits. The hour for going to
bed, and for rising, for eating your meals, for study, and for
play, indeed, the time for every duty relating to your body, should,
as nearly as possible, be just the same, day after day.</p>

<p>
<em>BLISTERS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If a blister forms anywhere on the body, do not prick it. If
you do, a sore will form. Leave it alone until it breaks of itself.
By that time (generally in two or three days) a new skin will
have formed, and the blister will pass away almost unnoticed.</p>

<p>
<em>BOILS, STINGS OF INSECTS, AND BURNS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The skin of a boiled egg is a good remedy for boils. Peel it
carefully, wet and apply to the part affected. The stings of insects
may be covered with moistened earth. Slight burns will cause little
pain, if the air is shut out by means of paste or anything of
that nature.</p>

<p>
<em>BLEEDING OF THE NOSE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>For continued bleeding at the nose, apply ice or cold water to
the back of the neck and push a plug of cotton, or soft rag covered
with powdered alum up the nose. The "door-key" is good, because
it is cold; any other piece of cold metal will do as well.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>FIRE</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If your clothing should catch fire, keep your senses about you.
Do not start on a run, unless the distance is very short to open
water, into which you can plunge. An overcoat, blanket or piece
of carpet, wrapped closely about the body, will smother the flames.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>FAINTING</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If a person faints he should be laid flat on his back, given
fresh air, and water sprinkled in his face. The clothing about
the neck should be thrown open, and people prevented from crowding
around.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
<em>FROST-BITTEN FEET AND EARS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes when a boy uses his skates too long, or he is exposed
for a good while to bitterly cold weather, his feet or ears become
frost-bitten. When this mishap takes place, he is apt to do the
very thing he ought not to do.</p>

<p>He must not approach a fire, enter a warm room, nor use warm
water or clothing. When any part of the body is frozen, snow should
be constantly applied to it. If no snow is at hand, the coldest
water that can be obtained must be used with cloths, until the
frozen member is gradually thawed out.</p>

<p>
<em>SLIGHT CUTS AND WOUNDS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>All boys use jack-knives, and now and then inflict cuts upon
themselves. As a rule, these do not amount to much, and only require
to be washed with cold water and bound up with a clean rag; but,
if a vein or artery is severed, there is great danger.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;(k) <em>the Pulmonary Artery</em>, (c) <em>the Great Aorta</em>.]

</p>
<p>
<em>HOW TO TREAT A BLEEDING ARTERY</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>If an artery is cut, the blood will be bright red, and will come
out in jets, corresponding with the throbbing of the heart. As
the arteries take the blood from the heart, the proper thing to
do is to press the thumb strongly upon the artery just above the
wound. Then a handkerchief should be knotted around the arm or
leg, as the case may be, above the hurt; a stick placed under
the bandage, and twisted about until the flow of blood is stopped.
This will answer until the surgeon can be brought.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
<em>CUT VEINS AND BROKEN LIMBS</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>The veins carry the blood back to the heart. If one is cut the
blood is dark and flows steadily. It is managed more easily than
an artery; all that need be done is to place some lint over the
wound and bandage it firmly. This, of course, you will do as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>If you should be so unfortunate as to break or dislocate a limb,
assume an easy position and calmly await the coming of the surgeon.
If a finger only is fractured you can walk to his office.</p>
