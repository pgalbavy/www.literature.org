<p>How he knew he was safe, Lightfoot the Deer couldn't have told
you. He just knew it, that was all. He couldn't understand a word
said by the man in whose yard he found himself when he climbed
the bank after his long swim across the Big River. But he didn't
have to understand words to know that he had found a friend. So
he allowed the man to drive him gently over to an open shed where
there was a pile of soft hay and there he lay down, so tired that
it seemed to him he couldn't move another step.</p>

<p>It was only a few minutes later that the hunter who had followed
Lightfoot across the River reached the bank and scrambled out
of his boat. Lightfoot's friend was waiting just at the top of
the bank. Of course the hunter saw him at once.</p>

<p>"Hello, Friend!" cried the hunter. "Did you see a Deer pass this
way a few minutes ago? He swam across the river, and if I know
anything about it he's too tired to travel far now. I've been
hunting that fellow for several days, and if I have any luck at
all I ought to get him this time."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you won't have any luck at all," said Lightfoot's
friend. "You see, I don't allow any hunting on my land."</p>

<p>The hunter looked surprised, and then his surprise gave way to
anger. "You mean," said he, "that you intend to get that Deer
yourself."</p>

<p>Lightfoot's friend shook his head. "No," said he, "I don't mean
anything of the kind. I mean that that Deer is not to be killed
if I can prevent it, and while it is on my land, I think I can.
The best thing for you to do, my friend, is to get into your boat
and row back where you came from. Are those your hounds barking
over there?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the hunter promptly. "I know the law just as well
as you do, and it is against the law to hunt Deer with dogs. I
don't even know who owns those two hounds over there."</p>

<p>"That may be true," replied Lightfoot's friend. "I don't doubt
it is true. But you are willing to take advantage of the fact
that the dogs of some one else have broken the law. You knew that
those dogs had driven that Deer into the Big River and you promptly
took advantage of the fact to try to reach that Deer before he
could get across. You are not hunting for the pleasure of hunting
but just to kill. You don't know the meaning of justice or fairness.
Now get off my land. Get back into your boat and off my land as
quick as you can. That Deer is not very far from here and so tired
that he cannot move. Just as long as he will stay here, he will
be safe, and I hope he will stay until this miserable hunting
season is ended. Now go."</p>

<p>Muttering angrily, the hunter got back into his boat and pushed
off, but he didn't row back across the river.</p>
