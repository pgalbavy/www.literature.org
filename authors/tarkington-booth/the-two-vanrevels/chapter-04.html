<p>If it be true that love is the great incentive to the useless
arts, the number of gentlemen who became poets for the sake of
Miss Betty Carewe need not be considered extraordinary. Of all
that was written of her dancing, Tom Vanrevel's lines, "I Danced
with Her beneath the Lights"  (which he certainly had not done
when he wrote them) were, perhaps, next to Crailey Gray's in merit,
though Tom burned his rhymes after reading them to Crailey. Other
troubadours were not so modest, and the Rouen Journal found no
lack of tuneful offering, that spring, generously print-ing all
of it, even at the period when it became epidemic. The public
had little difficulty in recognizing the work of Mr. Francis Chenoweth
in an anonymous "Sonnet" (of twenty-three lines) which appeared
in the issue following Miss Carewe's debut. Mr. Chenoweth wrote
that while dancing the mazourka with a Lovely Being, the sweetest
feelings of his soul, in a celestial stream, bore him away beyond
control, in a seraphic dream; and he untruthfully stated that
at the same time he saw her wipe the silent tear, omitting, however,
to venture any explanation of the cause of her emotion. Old General
Trumble boldly signed his poem in full. It was called "An Ode
upon Miss <em>C&mdash;'</em>s Waltzing," and it began:</p>

<p>"When Bettina found fair Rouen's shore, And her aged father to
us bore Her from the cloister neat, She waltzed upon the ball-room
floor, And lightly twirled upon her feet."</p>

<p>Mr. Carewe was rightfully indignant, and refused to acknowledge
the General's salutation at their next meeting: Trumble was fifteen
years older than he.</p>

<p>As Crailey Gray never danced with Miss Carewe, it is somewhat
singular that she should have been the inspiration of his swinging
verses in waltz measure, "Heart-strings on a Violin," the sense
of which was that when a violin had played for her dancing, the
instrument should be shattered as wine-glasses are after a great
toast. However, no one, except the author himself, knew that Betty
was the subject; for Crailey certainly did not mention it to Miss
Bareaud, nor to his best friend, Vanrevel.</p>

<p>It was to some degree a strange comradeship between these two
young men; their tastes led them so often in opposite directions.
They had rooms to-gether over their offices in the "Madrillon
Block" on Main Street, and the lights shone late from their windows
every night in the year. Sometimes that would mean only that the
two friends were talking, for they never reached a silent intimacy,
but, even after several years of companionship, were rarely seen
together when not in interested, often eager, conversation, so
that people wondered what in the world they still found to say
to each other. But many a night the late-shining lamp meant that
Tom sat alone, with a brief or a book, or wooed the long hours
with his magical guitar. For he never went to bed until the other
came home.</p>

<p>And if daylight came without Crailey, Vanrevel would go out,
yawning mightily, to look for him; and when there was no finding
him, Tom would come back, sleepless, to the day's work. Crailey
was called "peculiar"  and he explained, with a kind of jovial
helplessness, that he was always prepared for the unexpected in
himself, nor did such a view detract from his picturesqueness
to his own perusal of himself; though it was not only to himself
that he was interesting. To the vision of the lookers-on in Rouen,
quiet souls who hovered along the walls at merry-makings and cheerfully
counted themselves spectators at the play, Crailey Gray held the
centre of the stage and was the chief comedian of the place. Wit,
poet, and scapegrace, the small society sometimes seemed the mere
background set for his performances, spectacles which he, also,
enjoyed, and from the best seat in the house; for he was not content
as the actor, but must be the Prince in the box as well.</p>

<p>His friendship for Tom Vanrevel was, in a measure, that of the
vine for the oak. He was full of levities at Tom's expense, which
the other bore with a grin of sympathetic comprehension, or, at
long intervals, returned upon Crailey with devastating effect.
Vanrevel was the one steadying thing in his life, and, at the
same time, the only one of the young men upon whom he did not
have an almost mesmeric influence. In good truth, Crailey was
the ringleader in all the devilries of the town. Many a youth
swore to avoid the roisterer's company for all time, and, within
two hours of the vow, found himself, flagon in hand, engaged in
a bout that would last the night, with Mr. Gray out-bumpering
the hardiest, at the head of the table. And, the next morning,
the fevered, scarlet-eyed perjurer might creep shaking to his
wretched tasks, only to behold the cause of his folly and headache
tripping merrily along the street, smiling, clean-shaven, and
fresh as a dew-born primrose, with, perchance, two or three of
the prettiest girls in town at his elbow to greet his sallies
with approving laughter.</p>

<p>Crailey had been so long in the habit of following every impulse,
no matter how mad, that he enjoyed an almost perfect immunity
from condemnation, and, whatever his deeds, Rouen had learned
to say, with a chuckle, that it was "only Crailey Gray again."
But his followers were not so privileged. Thus, when Mr. Gray,
who in his libations sometimes developed the humor of an urchin,
went to the Pound at three in the morning of New Year's Day, hung
sleigh-bells about the necks of the cattle and drove them up and
down the streets, himself hideously blowing a bass horn from the
back of a big brown steer, those roused from slumber ceased to
rage, and accepted the exploit as a rare joke, on learning that
it was "only Crailey Gray;" but the unfortunate young Chenoweth
was heavily frowned upon and properly upbraided because he had
followed in the wake of the bovine procession, mildly attempting
to play upon a flageolet.</p>

<p>Crailey never denied a folly nor defended an escapade. The latter
was always done for him, because he talked of his "graceless misdoings"
(so he was wont, smilingly, to call them) over cups of tea in
the afternoons with old ladies, lamenting, in his musical voice,
the lack of female relatives to guide him. He was charmingly attentive
to the elderly women, not from policy, but because his manner
was uncontrollably chivalrous; and, ever a gallant listener, were
the speaker young, old, great or humble, he never forgot to catch
the last words of a sentence, and seldom suffered for a reply,
even when he had drowsed through a question. Moreover, no one
ever heard him speak a sullen word, nor saw him wear a brow of
depression. The single creed to which he was constant was that
of good cheer; he was the very apostle of gayety, preaching it
in parlor and bar; and made merry friends with battered tramps
and homeless dogs in the streets at night.</p>

<p>Now and then he would spend several days in the offices of Gray
&amp; Vanrevel, Attorneys and Counsellors-at-Law, wearing an air
of unassailable virtue; though he did not far overstate the case
when he said, "Tom does all the work and gives me all the money
not to bother him when he's getting up a case."</p>

<p>The working member of the firm got up cases to notable effect,
and few lawyers in the State enjoyed having Tom Vanrevel on the
other side. There was nothing about him of the floridity prevalent
at that time; he withered "oratory" before the court; he was the
foe of jury pathos; and, despising noise and the habitual voice-dip
at the end of a sentence, was, nevertheless, at times an almost
fearfully effective orator. So, by degrees the firm of Gray &amp;
Vanrevel, young as it was, and in spite of the idle apprentice,
had grown to be the most prosperous in the district. For this
eminence Crailey was never accused of assuming the credit. Nor
did he ever miss an opportunity of making known how much he owed
to his partner. What he owed, in brief, was everything. How well
Vanrevel worked was demonstrated every day, but how hard he worked,
only Crailey knew. The latter had grown to depend upon him for
even his political beliefs, and lightly followed his partner into
Abolitionism; though that was to risk unpopularity, bitter hatred,
and worse. Fortunately, on certain occasions, Vanrevel had made
himself (if not his creed) respected, at least so far that there
was no longer danger of mob-violence for an Abolitionist in Rouen.
He was a cool-headed young man ordinarily, and possessed of an
elusive forcefulness not to be trifled with, though he was a quiet
man, and had what they called a "fine manner." And, not in the
latter, but in his dress, there was an echo of the Beau, which
afforded Mr. Gray a point of attack for sallies of wit; there
was a touch of the dandy about Vanrevel; he had a large and versatile
wardrobe, and his clothes always fit him not only in line but
in color; even women saw how nobly they were fashioned.</p>

<p>These two young men were members of a cheerful band, who feasted,
laughed, wrangled over politics, danced, made love, and sang terrible
chords on summer evenings, together, as young men will. Will Cummings,
editor of the Rouen Journal, was one of these; a tall, sallow
man, very thin, very awkward and very gentle. Mr. Cummings proved
himself always ready with a loud and friendly laugh for the poorest
joke in the world, his countenance shining with such kindness
that no one ever had the heart to reproach him with the evils
of his journalistic performances, or for the things he broke when
he danced. Another was Tappingham Marsh, an exceedingly handsome
person, somewhat languid in appearance, dainty in manner with
women, offhand with men; almost as reckless as Crailey, and often
the latter's companion and assistant in dissipation. Young Francis
Chenoweth never failed to follow both into whatever they planned;
he was short and pink, and the uptilt of his nose was coherent
with the appealing earnest-ness which was habitual with him. Eugene
Madrillon was the sixth of these intimates; a dark man, whose
Latin eyes and color advertised his French ancestry as plainly
as his emotionless mouth and lack of gesture betrayed the mingling
of another strain.</p>

<p>All these, and others of the town, were wont to "talk politics"
a great deal at the little club on Main Street and all were apt
to fall foul of Tom Vanrevel or Crailey Gray before the end of
any discussion. For those were the days when they twisted the
Lion's tail in vehement and bitter earnest; when the eagle screamed
in mixed figures; when few men knew how to talk, and many orated;
when party strife was savagely personal; when intolerance was
called the "pure fire of patriotism;" when criticism of the existing
order of things surely incurred fiery anathema and black invective;
and brave was he, indeed, who dared to hint that his country,
as a whole and politically, did lack some two or three particular
virtues, and that the first step toward obtaining them would be
to help it to realize their absence.</p>

<p>This latter point-of-view was that of the firm of Gray &amp;
Vanrevel, which was a unit in such matters. Crailey did most of
the talking&mdash;quite beautifully, too&mdash;and both had to stand against
odds in many a sour argument, for they were not only Abolitionists,
but opposed the attitude of their country in its difficulty with
Mexico; and, in common with other men of the time who took their
stand, they had to grow accustomed to being called Disloyal Traitors,
Foreign Toadies, Malignants, and Traducers of the Flag. Tom had
long been used to epithets of this sort, suffering their sting
in quiet, and was glad when he could keep Crailey out of worse
employment than standing firm for an unpopular belief.</p>

<p>There was one place to which Vanrevel, seeking his friend and
partner, when the latter did not come home at night, could not
go; this was the Tower Chamber, and it was in that mysterious
apartment of the Carewe cupola that Crailey was apt to be deeply
occupied when he remained away until daylight. Strange as it appears,
Mr. Gray maintained peculiar relations of intimacy with Robert
Carewe, in spite of the feud between Carewe and his own best friend.
This intimacy, which did not necessarily imply any mutual fondness
(though Crailey seemed to dislike nobody), was betokened by a
furtive understanding, of a sort, between them. They held brief,
earnest conversations on the street, or in corners when they met
at other people's houses, always speaking in voices too low to
be overheard; and they exercised a mysterious symbolism, somewhat
in the manner of fellow members of a secret society: they had
been observed to communicate across crowded rooms, by lifted eyebrow,
nod of head, or a surreptitious turn of the wrist: so that those
who observed them knew that a question had been asked and answered.</p>

<p>It was noticed, also, that there were five other initiates to
this masonry: Eugene Madrillon, the elder Chenoweth, General Trumble,
Tappingham Marsh, and Jefferson Bareaud. Thus, on the afternoon
following Miss Betty's introduction to Rouen's favorite sons and
daughters, Mr. Carewe, driving down Main Street, held up one forefinger
to Madrillon as he saw the young man turning in at the club. Eugene
nodded gravely, and, as he went in, discovering Marsh, the General,
and others, listening to Mr. Gray's explanation of his return
from the river with no fish, stealthily held up one finger in
his turn. Trumble replied with a wink, Tappingham nodded, but
Crailey slightly shook his head. Marsh and the General started
with surprise, and stared incredulously. That Crailey should shake
his head! If the signal had been for a church-meeting they might
have understood.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray's conduct was surprising two other people at about the
same time: Tom Vanrevel and Fanchon Bareaud; the former by his
sudden devotion to the law; the latter by her sudden devotion
to herself. In a breath, he became almost a domestic character.
No more did he spend his afternoons between the club and the Rouen
House bar, nor was his bay mare so often seen stamping down the
ground about Mrs. McDougal's hitching-post while McDougal was
out on the prairie with his engineering squad. The idle apprentice
was at his desk, and in the daytime he displayed an aversion for
the streets, which was more than his partner did, for the industrious
Tom, undergoing quite as remarkable an alteration of habit, became,
all at once, little better than a corner-loafer. His favorite
lounging-place was a small drug-store where Carewe Street debouched
upon Main; nevertheless, so adhesive is a reputation once fastened,
his air of being there upon business deceived everyone except
Mr. Gray.</p>

<p>Miss Bareaud was even happier than she was astonished (and she
was mightily astonished) to find her betrothed developing a taste
for her society alone. Formerly, she had counted upon the gayeties
of her home to keep Crailey near her; now, however, he told her
tenderly he wished to have her all to himself. This was not like
him, but Fanchon did not question; and it was very sweet to her
that he began to make it his custom to come in by a side gate
and meet her under an apple-tree in the dusk, where they would
sit quietly together through the evening, listening to the noise
and laughter from the lighted house.</p>

<p>That house was the most hospitable in Rouen. Always cheerfully
"full of company," as they said, it was the sort of house where
a carpet-dance could be arranged in half an hour; a house with
a sideboard like the widow's cruse; the young men always found
more. Mrs. Bareaud, a Southerner, loving to persuade the visitor
that her home was his, not hers, lived only for her art, which
was that of the table. Evil cooks, taking service with her, became
virtuous, dealt with nectar and ambrosia, and grew fit to pander
to Olympus, learning of their mistress secrets to make the ill-disposed
as genial gods ere they departed. Mr. Bareaud at fifty had lived
so well that he gave up walking, which did not trouble him; but
at sixty he gave up dancing, which did trouble him. His only hope,
he declared, was in Crailey Gray's promise to invent for him:
a concave partner.</p>

<p>There was a thin, quizzing shank of a son, Jefferson, who lived
upon quinine, ague and deviltry; and there were the two daughters,
Fanchon and Virginia. The latter was three years older than Fanchon,
as dark as Fanchon was fair, though not nearly so pretty: a small,
good-natured, romping sprite of a girl, who had handed down the
heart and hand of Crailey Gray to her sister with the best grace
in the world. For she had been the heroine of one of Mr. Gray's
half-dozen or so most serious affairs, and, after a furious rivalry
with Mr. Carewe, the victory was generally conceded to Crailey.
His triumph had been of about a fort-night's duration when Fanchon
returned from St. Mary's; and, with the advent of the younger
sister, the elder, who had decided that Crailey was the incomparable
she had dreamed of since infancy, was generously allowed to discover
that he was not that vision&mdash;that she had fallen in love with
her own idea of him; whereas Fanchon cared only that he be Crailey
Gray, whatever kind of vision that was. And Fanchon discovered
that it was a great many kinds.</p>

<p>The transfer was made comfortably, with nice judgment of a respectable
interregnum, and to the greater happiness of each of the three
young people; no objection ensuing from the easy-going parents,
who were devotedly fond of Crailey, while the town laughed and
said it was only that absurd Crailey Gray again. He and Virginia
were the best of friends, and accepted their new relation with
a preposterous lack of embarrassment.</p>

<p>To be in love with Crailey became Fanchon's vocation; she spent
all her time at it, and produced a blurred effect upon strangers.
The only man with whom she seemed quite alive was Vanrevel: a
little because Tom talked of Crailey, and a great deal because
she could talk of Crailey to Tom; could tell him freely, as she
could tell no one else, how wonderful Crailey was, and explain
to him her lover's vagaries on the ground that it was a necessity
of geniuses to be unlike the less gifted. Nor was she alone in
suspecting Mr. Gray of genius: in the first place, he was so odd;
in the second, his poems were "already attracting more than local
attention," as the Journal remarked, generously, for Crailey had
ceased to present his rhymes to that valuable paper. Ay! Boston,
no less, was his mart.</p>

<p>He was rather radical in his literary preferences, and hurt the
elder Chenoweth's feelings by laughing heartily at some poems
of the late Lord Byron; offended many people by disliking the
style of Sir Edward Bulwer, and even refused to admit that James
Fenimore Cooper was the greatest novelist that ever lived. But
these things were as nothing compared with his unpatriotic defence
of Charles Dickens. Many Americans had fallen into a great rage
over the vivacious assault upon the United States in "Martin Chuzzlewit;"
nevertheless, Crailey still boldly hailed him (as everyone had
heretofore agreed) the most dexterous writer of his day and the
most notable humorist of any day. Of course the Englishman had
not visited and thoroughly studied such a city as Rouen, Crailey
confessed, twinklingly; but, after all, wasn't there some truth
in "Martin Chuzzlewit?" Mr. Dickens might have been far from a
clear understanding of our people; but didn't it argue a pretty
ticklish vanity in ourselves that we were so fiercely resentful
of satire; and was not this very heat over "Martin Chuzzlewit"
a confirmation of one of the points the book had presented against
us? General Trumble replied to this suggestion with a personal
one to the effect that a man capable of saying a good word for
so monstrous a slander, that a man, sir, capable of declaring
his native country to be vain or sensitive ought to be horsewhipped,
and at this Crailey laughed consumedly.</p>

<p>Trumble retorted with the names of Benedict Arnold and Aaron
Burr. "And if it comes to a war with these Greasers," he spluttered
apoplectically, "and it is coming, mighty soon, we'll find Mr.
Gray down in Mexico, throwing mud on the Stars and Stripes and
cheering for that one-legged horse-thief, Santa Anna! Anything
to seek out something foolish amongst your own people!"</p>

<p>"Don't have to seek far, sometimes, General," murmured Crailey,
from the depths of the best chair in the club, whereupon Trumble,
not trusting himself to answer, went out to the street.</p>

<p>And yet, before that same evening was over, the General had shed
honest tears of admiration and pity for Crailey Gray; and Miss
Betty saw her Incroyable again, for that night (the second after
the Carewe dance) Rouen beheld the great warehouse tire.</p>
