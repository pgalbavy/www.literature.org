<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Betty never forgot her first sight of the old friend of her family.
Returning with a sad heart, she was walking the colt slowly through
the carriage-gates, when an extravagantly stout lady, in green
muslin illustrated with huge red flowers, came out upon the porch
and waved a fat arm to the girl. The visitor wore a dark-green
turban and a Cashmere shawl, while the expanse of her skirts was
nothing short of magnificent: some cathedral-dome seemed to have
been misplaced and the lady dropped into it. Her outstretched
hand terrified Betty: how was she to approach near enough to take
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry was about sixty, looked forty, and at first you
might have guessed she weighed nearly three hundred, but the lightness
of her smile and the actual buoyancy which she somehow imparted
to her whole dominion lessened that by at least a hundred-weight.
She ballooned out to the horse-block with a billowy rush somewhere
between bounding and soaring; and Miss Betty slid down from the
colt, who shied violently, to find herself enveloped, in spite
of the dome, in a vast surf of green and red muslin.</p>

<p>"My charming girl!" exclaimed the lady vehemently, in a voice
of such husky richness, of such merriment and unction of delight,
that it fell upon Miss Betty's ear with more of the quality of
sheer gayety than any she had ever heard. "Beautiful child! What
a beautiful child you are!"</p>

<p>She kissed the girl resoundingly on both cheeks; stepped back
from her and laughed, and clapped her fat hands, which were covered
with flashing rings. "Oh, but you are a true blue Beauty! You're
a Princess! I am Mrs. Tanberry, Jane Tanberry, young Janie Tanberry.
I haven't seen you since you were a baby and your pretty mother
was a girl like us!"</p>

<p>"You are so kind to come," said Betty hesitatingly. "I shall
try to be very obedient."</p>

<p>"Obedient!" Mrs. Tanberry uttered the word with a shriek. "You'll
be nothing of the kind. I am the light-mindedest woman in the
universe, and anyone who obeyed me would be embroiled in everlasting
trouble every second in the day. You'll find that I am the one
that needs looking after, my charmer!"</p>

<p>She tapped Miss Betty's cheek with her jeweled fingers as the
two mounted the veranda steps. "It will be worry enough for you
to obey yourself; a body sees that at the first blush. You have
conscience in your forehead and rebellion in your chin. Ha, ha,
ha!" Here Mrs. Tanberry sat upon, and obliterated, a large chair,
Miss Carewe taking a stool at her knee.</p>

<p>"People of our age oughtn't to be bothered with obeying; there'll
be time enough for that when we get old and can't enjoy anything.
Ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry punctuated her observations with short volleys
of husky laughter, so abrupt in both discharge and cessation that,
until Miss Betty became accustomed to the habit, she was apt to
start slightly at each salvo. "I had a husband&mdash;once," the lady
resumed, "but only once, my friend! He had ideas like your father's&mdash;your
father is such an imbecile!&mdash;and he thought that wives, sisters,
daughters, and such like ought to be obedient: that is, the rest
of the world was wrong unless it was right; and right was just
his own little, teeny-squeeny prejudices and emotions dressed
up for a crazy masquerade as Facts. Poor man! He only lasted about
a year!" And Mrs. Tanberry laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"They've been at me time and again to take another." She lowered
her voice and leaned toward Betty confidentially. "Not I! I'd
be willing to engage myself to Crailey Gray (though Crailey hasn't
got round to me yet) for I don't mind just being engaged, my dear;
but they'll have to invent something better than a man before
I marry any one of 'em again! But I love 'em, I do, the Charming
Billies! And you'll see how they follow me!" She patted the girl's
shoulder, her small eyes beaming quizzically. "We'll have the
gayest house in Rouen, ladybird! The young men all go to the Bareauds',
but they'll come here now, and we'll have the Bareauds along with
'em. I've been away a long time, just finished unpacking yesterday
night when your father came in after the fire &mdash;Whoo! what
a state he was in with that devilish temper of his! Didn't I snap
him up when he asked me to come and stay with you? Ha, ha! I'd
have come, even if you hadn't been beautiful; but I was wild to
be your playmate, for I'd heard nothing but 'Miss Betty Carewe,
Miss Betty Carewe' from everybody I saw, since the minute my stage
came in. You set 'em all mad at your ball, and I knew we'd make
a glorious house-full, you and I! Some of the vagabonds will turn
up this very evening, you'll see if they don't. Ha, ha! The way
they follow me!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry was irresistible: she filled the whole place otherwise
than by the mere material voluminousness of her; bubbling over
with froth of nonsense which flew through the house, driven by
her energy, like sea-foam on a spring gale; and the day, so discordantly
begun for Miss Betty, grew musical with her own laughter, answering
the husky staccato of the vivacious newcomer. Nelson waited upon
them at table, radiant, his smile like the keyboard of an ebony
piano, and his disappearances into the kitchen were accomplished
by means of a surreptitious double-shuffle, and followed by the
cachinnating echoes of the vain Mamie's reception of the visitor's
sallies, which Nelson hastily retailed in passing.</p>

<p>Nor was Mrs. Tanberry's prediction allowed to go unfulfilled
regarding the advent of those persons whom she had designated
as vagabonds. It may have been out of deference to Mr. Carewe's
sense of decorum (or from a cautious regard of what he was liable
to do when he considered that sense outraged) that the gallants
of Rouen had placed themselves under the severe restraint of allowing
three days to elapse after their introduction to Miss Carewe before
they "paid their respects at the house;" but, be that as it may,
the dictator was now safely under way down the Rouen River, and
Mrs. Tanberry reigned in his stead. Thus, at about eight o'clock
that evening, the two ladies sat in the library engaged in conversation&mdash;though,
for the sake of accuracy, it should be said that Mrs. Tanberry
was engaged in conversation, Miss Betty in giving ear&mdash;when their
attention was arrested by sounds of a somewhat musical nature
from the lawn, which sounds were immediately identified as emanating
from a flute and violin.</p>

<p>Mrs. Tanberry bounded across the room like a public building
caught by a cyclone, and, dashing at the candles, "Blow 'em out,
blow 'em out!" she exclaimed, suiting the action to the word in
a fluster of excitement.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Miss Carewe, startled, as she rose to her feet.
The candles were out before the question.</p>

<p>"'Why!" repeated the merry, husky voice in the darkness. "My
goodness, child precious, those vagabonds are here! To think of
your never having been serenaded before!"</p>

<p>She drew the girl to the window and pointed to a group of dim
figures near the iliac bushes. "The dear, delightful vagabonds!"
she chuckled. "I knew they'd come! It's the beautiful Tappingham
Marsh with his fiddle, and young Jeff Bareaud with his flute,
and 'Gene Madrillon and little Frank Chenowith and thin Will Cummings
to sing. Hark to the rascals!"</p>

<p>It is perfectly truthful to say that the violin and flute executed
the prelude, and then the trio sounded full on the evening air,
the more effective chords obligingly drawn out as long as the
breath in the singers could hold them, in order to allow the two
fair auditors complete benefit of the harmony. They sang "The
Harp that Once Thro' Tara's Halls," and followed it with "Long,
Long Ago."</p>

<p>"That," Mrs. Tanberry whispered, between stifled gusts of almost
uncontrollable laughter, "is meant for just me!"</p>

<p>"Tell me the tales that to me were so dear," entreated the trio.</p>

<p>"I told 'em plenty!" gurgled the enlivening widow. "And I expect
between us we can get up some more." "Now you are come my grief
is removed,"  they sang.</p>

<p>"They mean your father is on his way to St. Louis," remarked
Mrs. Tanberry.</p>

<p>"Let me forget that so long you have roved, Let me believe that
you love as you loved, Long, long ago, long ago."</p>

<p>"Applaud, applaud!" whispered Mrs. Tanberry, encouraging the
minstrels by a hearty clapping of hands.</p>

<p>Hereupon dissension arose among the quintet, evidently a dispute
in regard to their next selection; one of the gentlemen appearing
more than merely to suggest a solo by himself, while the others
too frankly expressed adverse opinions upon the value of the offering.
The argument became heated, and in spite of many a "Sh!" and "Not
so loud!" the ill-suppressed voice of the intending soloist, Mr.
Chenoweth, could be heard vehemently to exclaim: "I will! I learned
it especially for this occasion. I will sing it!"</p>

<p>His determination, patently, was not to be balked without physical
encounter, consequently he was permitted to advance some paces
from the lilac bushes, where he delivered himself, in an earnest
and plaintive tenor, of the following morbid instructions, to
which the violin played an obligato in tremulo, so execrable,
and so excruciatingly discordant, that Mr. Chenoweth's subsequent
charge that it was done with a deliberately evil intention could
never be successfully opposed:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Go! Forget me!<br/>
Why should Sorrow<br/>
O'er that brow a shadow fling?<br/>
Go! Forget me, and, to-morrow,<br/>
Brightly smile and sweetly sing!

</p>
<p>
"Smile! tho' I may not be near thee;<br/>
Smile! tho' I may never see thee;<br/>
May thy soul with pleasure shine<br/>
Lasting as this gloom of mine!"

</p>
</div>
<p>Miss Carewe complied at once with the request; while her companion,
unable to stop with the slight expression of pleasure demanded
by the songster, threw herself upon a sofa and gave way to the
mirth that consumed her.</p>

<p>Then the candles were relit, the serenaders invited within; Nelson
came bearing cake and wine, and the house was made merry. Presently,
the romp, Virginia Bareaud, making her appearance on the arm of
General Trumble, Mrs. Tanberry led them all in a hearty game of
Blind-man's Buff, followed by as hearty a dancing of Dan Tucker.
After that, a quadrille being proposed, Mrs. Tanberry suggested
that Jefferson should run home and bring Fanchon for the fourth
lady. However, Virginia explained that she had endeavored to persuade
both her sister and Mr. Gray to accompany the General and herself,
but that Mr. Gray had complained of indisposition, having suffered
greatly from headache, on account of inhaling so much smoke at
the warehouse fire; and, of course, Fanchon would not leave him.
(Miss Carewe permitted herself the slightest shrug of the shoulders.)</p>

<p>So they danced the quadrille with Jefferson at the piano and
Mr. Marsh performing in the character of a lady, a proceeding
most unacceptable to the General, whom Mrs. Tanberry forced to
be his partner. And thus the evening passed gayly away, and but
too quickly, to join the ghosts of all the other evenings since
time began; and each of the little company had added a cheerful
sprite to the long rows of those varied shades that the after
years bring to revisit us, so many with pathetic reproach, so
many bearing a tragic burden of faces that we cannot make even
to weep again, and so few with simple merriment and lightheartedness.
Tappingham Marsh spoke the truth, indeed, when he exclaimed in
parting, "O rare Mrs. Tanberry!"</p>

<p>But the house had not done with serenades that night. The guests
had long since departed; the windows were still and dark under
the wan old moon, which had risen lamely, looking unfamiliar and
not half itself; the air bore an odor of lateness, and nothing
moved; when a delicate harmony stole out of the shadows beyond
the misty garden. Low but resonant chords sounded on the heavier
strings of a guitar, while above them, upon the lighter wires,
rippled a slender, tinkling melody that wooed the slumberer to
a delicious half-wakefulness, as dreamily, as tenderly, as the
croon of rain on the roof soothes a child to sleep. Under the
artist's cunning touch the instrument was both the accompaniment
and the song; and Miss Betty, at first taking the music to be
a wandering thread in the fabric of her own bright dreams, drifted
gradually to consciousness to find herself smiling. Her eyes opened
wide, but half closed again with the ineffable sweetness of the
sound.</p>

<p>Then a voice was heard, eerily low, yet gallant and clear, a
vibrant baritone, singing to the guitar.</p>

<p>"My lady's hair, That dark delight, Is both as fair And dusk
as night. I know some lovelorn hearts that beat In time to moonbeam
twinklings fleet, That dance and glance like jewels there, Emblazoning
the raven hair!</p>

<p>"Ah, raven hair! So dark and bright, What loves lie there Enmeshed,
to-night? I know some sighing lads that say Their hearts were
snared and torn away; And now as pearls one fate they share, Entangled
in the raven hair.</p>

<p>"Ah, raven hair, From such a plight Could you not spare One acolyte?
I know a broken heart that went To serve you but as ornament.
Alas! a ruby now you wear, Ensanguining the raven hair!"</p>

<p>The song had grown fainter and fainter, the singer moving away
as he sang, and the last lines were almost inaudible in the distance
The guitar could be heard for a moment or two more, then silence
came again. It was broken by a rustling in the room next to Miss
Betty's, and Mrs. Tanberry called softly through the open door:</p>

<p>"Princess, are you awake? Did you hear that serenade?"</p>

<p>After a pause the answer came hesitatingly in a small, faltering
voice: "Yes&mdash;if it was one. I thought perhaps he was only singing
as he passed along the street."</p>

<p>"Aha!" ejaculated Mrs. Tanberry, abruptly, as though she had
made an unexpected discovery. "You knew better; and this was a
serenade that you did not laugh at. Beautiful, I wouldn't let
it go any farther, even while your father is gone. Something might
occur that would bring him home without warning&mdash;such things have
happened. Tom Vanrevel ought to be kept far away from this house."</p>

<p>"Oh, it was not he," returned Miss Betty, quickly. "It was Mr.
Gray. Didn't you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear," interrupted the other, "Crailey Gray's specialty is
talking. Most of the vagabonds can sing and play a bit, and so
can Crailey, particularly when he's had a few bowls of punch;
but when Tom Vanrevel touches the guitar and lifts up his voice
to sing, there isn't an angel in heaven that wouldn't quit the
place and come to hear him! Crailey wrote those words to Virginia
Bareaud. (Her hair is even darker than yours, you know.) That
was when he was being engaged to her; and Tom must have set the
music to 'em lately, and now comes here to sing 'em to you; and
well enough they fit you! But you must keep him away, Princess."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Betty knew the voice was not that which had bid
her look to the stars, and she remained convinced that it belonged
to Mr. Crailey Gray, who had been too ill, a few hours earlier,
to leave the Bareaud house, and now, with Fanchon's kisses on
his lips, came stealing into her garden and sang to her a song
he had made for another girl!</p>

<p>And the angels would leave heaven to listen when he sang, would
they? Poor Fanchon! No wonder she held him so tightly in leading
strings! He might risk his life all he wished at the end of a
grappling-ladder, dangling in a fiery cloud above nothing; but
when it came to&mdash;ah, well, poor Fanchon! Did she invent the headaches
for him, or did she make him invent them for himself?</p>

<p>If there was one person in the world whom Miss Betty held in
bitter contempt and scorn, it was the owner of that voice and
that guitar.</p>
