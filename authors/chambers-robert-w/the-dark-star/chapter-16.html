<p>At the Orangeville garage Neeland stopped his car, put on his
straw hat, got out carrying suitcase and box, entered the office,
and turned over the care of the machine to an employee with orders
to drive it back to Neeland's Mills the next morning.</p>

<p>Then he leisurely returned to his prisoner who had given him
her name as Ilse Dumont and who was standing on the sidewalk beside
the car.</p>

<p>"Well, Scheherazade," he said, smiling, "teller of marvellous
tales, I don't quite believe your stories, but they were extremely
entertaining. So I won't bowstring you or cut off your unusually
attractive head! No! On the contrary, I thank you for your wonder-tales,
and for not murdering me. And, furthermore, I bestow upon you
your liberty. Have you sufficient cash to take you where you desire
to waft yourself?"</p>

<p>All the time her dark, unsmiling eyes remained fixed on him,
calmly unresponsive to his badinage.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry I had to be rough with you, Scheherazade," he continued,
"but when a young lady sews her clothes full of papers which don't
belong to her, what, I ask you, is a modest young man to do?"</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>"It becomes necessary for that modest young man to can his modesty&mdash;and
the young lady's. Is there anything else he could do?" he repeated
gaily.</p>

<p>"He had better return those papers," she replied in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Scheherazade, but it isn't done in ultra-crooked
circles. Are you sure you have enough money to go where destiny
and booty call you?"</p>

<p>"I have what I require," she answered dryly.</p>

<p>"Then good-bye, Pearl of the Harem! Without rancour, I offer
you the hand that reluctantly chastened you."</p>

<p>They remained facing each other in silence for a moment; his
expression was mischievously amused; hers inscrutable. Then, as
he patiently and good-humouredly continued to offer her his hand,
very slowly she laid her own in it, still looking him directly
in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"For what? For not shooting me?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for <em>you</em>, Mr. Neeland.... You're only a boy,
after all. You know nothing. And you refuse to learn.... I'm sorry....
Good-bye."</p>

<p>"Could I take you anywhere? To the Hotel Orange? I've time. The
station is across the street."</p>

<p>"No," she said.</p>

<p>She walked leisurely along the poorly lighted street and turned
the first corner as though at hazard. The next moment her trim
and graceful figure had disappeared.</p>

<p>With his heart still gay from the night's excitement, and the
drop of Irish blood in him lively as champagne, he crossed the
square briskly, entered the stuffy station, bought a ticket, and
went out to the wooden platform beside the rails.</p>

<p>Placing box and suitcase side by side, he seated himself upon
them and lighted a cigarette.</p>

<p>Here was an adventure! Whether or not he understood it, here
certainly was a real, story-book adventure at last. And he began
to entertain a little more respect for those writers of romance
who have so persistently attempted to convince an incredulous
world that adventures are to be had anywhere and at any time for
the mere effort entailed in seeking them.</p>

<p>In his case, however, he had not sought adventure. It had been
thrust upon him by cable.</p>

<p>And now the drop of Irish in him gratefully responded. He was
much obliged to Fate for his evening's entertainment; he modestly
ventured to hope for favours to come. And, considering the coolly
veiled threats of this young woman whom he had treated with scant
ceremony, he had some reason to expect a sequel to the night's
adventure.</p>

<p>"She," he thought to himself, "had nothing on Godiva&mdash;except
a piano cover!"</p>

<p>Recollection of the absurd situation incited his reprehensible
merriment to the point of unrestrained laughter; and he clasped
his knees and rocked to and fro, where he sat on his suitcase,
all alone under the stars.</p>

<p>The midnight express was usually from five to forty minutes late
at Orangeville; but from there east it made up time on the down
grade to Albany.</p>

<p>And now, as he sat watching, far away along the riverside a star
came gliding into view around an unseen curve&mdash;the headlight of
a distant locomotive.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was in his drawing-room, seated on the
edge of the couch, his door locked, the shade over the window
looking on the corridor drawn down as far as it would go; and
the train rushing through the starry night on the down grade toward
Albany.</p>

<p>He could not screen the corridor window entirely; the shade seemed
to be too short; but it was late, the corridor dark, all the curtains
in the car closed tightly over the berths, and his privacy was
not likely to be disturbed. And when the conductor had taken both
tickets and the porter had brought him a bottle of mineral water
and gone away, he settled down with great content.</p>

<p>Neeland was in excellent humour. He had not the slightest inclination
to sleep. He sat on the side of his bed, smoking, the olive-wood
box lying open beside him, and its curious contents revealed.</p>

<p>But now, as he carefully examined the papers, photographs, and
drawings, he began to take the affair a little more seriously.
And the possibility of further trouble raised his already high
spirits and caused that little drop of Irish blood to sing agreeably
in his veins.</p>

<p>Dipping into Herr Wilner's diary added a fillip to the increasing
fascination that was possessing him.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned," he thought, "if it doesn't really look as
though the plans of these Turkish forts might be important! I'm
not very much astonished that the Kaiser and the Sultan desire
to keep for themselves the secrets of these fortifications. They
really belong to them, too. They were drawn and planned by a German."
He shrugged. "A rotten alliance!" he muttered, and picked up the
bronze Chinese figure to examine it.</p>

<p>"So you're the Yellow Devil I've heard about!" he said. "Well,
you certainly are a pippin!"</p>

<p>Inspecting him with careless curiosity, he turned the bronze
over and over between his hands, noticing a slight rattling sound
that seemed to come from within but discovering no reason for
it. And, as he curiously considered the scowling demon, he hummed
an old song of his father's under his breath:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Wan balmy day in May<br/>
Th' ould Nick come to the dure;<br/>
Sez I 'The divil's to pay,<br/>
An' the debt comes harrd on the poor!'<br/>
His eyes they shone like fire<br/>
An' he gave a horrid groan;<br/>
Sez I to me sister Suke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Suke!!!!<br/>
Tell him I ain't at home!'

</p>
<p>
"He stood forninst the dure,<br/>
His wings were wings of a bat,<br/>
An' he raised his voice to a roar,<br/>
An' the tail of him switched like a cat,<br/>
'O wirra the day!' sez I,<br/>
'Ochone I'll no more roam!'<br/>
Sez I to me brother Luke,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Luke!!!!<br/>
Tell him I ain't at home!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>As he laid the bronze figure away and closed, locked and strapped
the olive-wood box, an odd sensation crept over him as though
somebody were overlooking what he was doing. Of course it could
not be true, but so sudden and so vivid was the impression that
he rose, opened the door, and glanced into the private washroom&mdash;even
poked under the bed and the opposite sofa; and of course discovered
that only a living skeleton could lie concealed in such spaces.</p>

<p>His courage, except moral courage, had never been particularly
tested. He was naturally quite fearless, even carelessly so, and
whether it was the courage of ignorance or a constitutional inability
to be afraid never bothered his mind because he never thought
about it.</p>

<p>Now, amused at his unusual fit of caution, he stretched himself
out on his bed, still dressed, debating in his mind whether he
should undress and try to sleep, or whether it were really worth
while before he boarded the steamer.</p>

<p>And, as he lay there, a cigarette between his lips, wakeful,
his restless gaze wandering, he suddenly caught a glimpse of something
moving&mdash;a human face pressed to the dark glass of the corridor
window between the partly lowered shade and the cherry-wood sill.</p>

<p>So amazed was he that the face had disappeared before he realised
that it resembled the face of Ilse Dumont. The next instant he
was on his feet and opening the door of the drawing-room; but
the corridor between the curtained berths was empty and dark and
still; not a curtain fluttered.</p>

<p>He did not care to leave his doorway, either, with the box lying
there on his bed; he stood with one hand on the knob, listening,
peering into the dusk, still excited by the surprise of seeing
her on the same train that he had taken.</p>

<p>However, on reflection, he quite understood that she could have
had no difficulty in boarding the midnight train for New York
without being noticed by him; because he was not expecting her
to do such a thing and he had paid no attention to the group of
passengers emerging from the waiting room when the express rolled
in.</p>

<p>"This is rather funny," he thought. "I wish I could find her.
I wish she'd be friendly enough to pay me a visit. Scheherazade
is certainly an entertaining girl. And it's several hours to New
York."</p>

<p>He lingered a while longer, but seeing and hearing nothing except
darkness and assorted snores, he stepped into his stateroom and
locked the door again.</p>

<p>Sleep was now impossible; the idea of Scheherazade prowling in
the dark corridor outside amused him intensely, and aroused every
atom of his curiosity. Did the girl really expect an opportunity
to steal the box? Or was she keeping a sinister eye on him with
a view to summoning accomplices from vasty metropolitan deeps
as soon as the train arrived? Or, having failed at Brookhollow,
was she merely going back to town to report "progress backward"?</p>

<p>He finished his mineral water, and, still feeling thirsty, rang,
on the chance that the porter might still be awake and obliging.</p>

<p>Something about the entire affair was beginning to strike him
as intensely funny, and the idea of foreign spies slinking about
Brookhollow; the seriousness with which this young girl took herself
and her mission; her amateur attempts at murder; her solemn mention
of the Turkish Embassy&mdash;all these excited his sense of the humorous.
And again incredulity crept in; and presently he found himself
humming Irwin's immortal Kaiser refrain:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Hi-lee! Hi-lo!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Der vinds dey blow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joost like die wacht am Rhine!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Und vot iss mine belongs to me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Und vot iss yours iss mine!"

</p>
</div>
<p>There came a knock at his door; he rose and opened it, supposing
it to be the porter; and was seized in the powerful grasp of two
men and jerked into the dark corridor.</p>

<p>One of them had closed his mouth with a gloved hand, crushing
him with an iron grip around the neck; the other caught his legs
and lifted him bodily; and, as they slung him between them, his
startled eyes caught sight of Ilse Dumont entering his drawing-room.</p>

<p>It was a silent, fierce struggle through the corridor to the
front platform of the vestibule train; it took both men to hold,
overpower, and completely master him; but they tried to do this
and, at the same time, lift the trap that discloses the car steps.
And could not manage it.</p>

<p>The instant Neeland realised what they were trying to do, he
divined their shocking intention in regard to himself, and the
struggle became terrible there in the swaying vestibule. Twice
he nearly got at the automatic pistol in his breast pocket, but
could not quite grasp it. They slammed him and thrashed him around
between them, apparently determined to open the trap, fling him
from the train, and let him take his chances with the wheels.</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, came a change in the fortunes of war; they
were trying to drag him over the chain sagging between the forward
mail-car and the Pullman, when one of them caught his foot on
it and stumbled backward, releasing Neeland's right arm. In the
same instant he drove his fist into the face of his other assailant
so hard that the man's head jerked backward as though his neck
were broken, and he fell flat on his back.</p>

<p>Already the train was slowing down for the single stop between
Albany and New York &mdash;Hudson. Neeland got out his pistol
and pointed it shakily at the man who had fallen backward over
the chain.</p>

<p>"Jump!" he panted. "Jump quick!"</p>

<p>The man needed no other warning; he opened the trap, scrambled
and wriggled down the mail-car steps, and was off the train like
a snake from a sack.</p>

<p>The other man, bloody and ghastly white, crept under the chain
after his companion. He was a well-built, good-looking man of
forty, with blue eyes and a golden beard all over blood. He seemed
sick from the terrific blow dealt him; but as the train had almost
stopped, Neeland pushed him off with the flat of his foot.</p>

<p>Drenched in perspiration, dishevelled, bruised, he slammed both
traps and ran back into the dark corridor, and met Ilse Dumont
coming out of his stateroom carrying the olive-wood box.</p>

<p>His appearance appeared to stupefy her; he took the box from
her without resistance, and, pushing her back into the stateroom,
locked the door.</p>

<p>Then, still savagely excited, and the hot blood of battle still
seething in his veins, he stood staring wickedly into her dazed
eyes, the automatic pistol hanging from his right fist.</p>

<p>But after a few moments something in her naïve astonishment&mdash;her
amazement to see him alive and standing there before her&mdash;appealed
to him as intensely ludicrous; he dropped on the edge of the bed
and burst into laughter uncontrolled.</p>

<p>"Scheherazade! Oh, Scheherazade!" he said, weak with laughter,
"if you could only see your face! If you could only <em>see</em>
it, my dear child! It's too funny to be true! It's too funny to
be a real face! Oh, dear, I'll die if I laugh any more. You'll
assassinate me with your face!"</p>

<p>She seated herself on the lounge opposite, still gazing blankly
at him in his uncontrollable mirth.</p>

<p>After a while he put back the automatic into his breast pocket,
took off coat and waistcoat, without paying the slightest heed
to her or to convention; opened his own suitcase, selected a fresh
shirt, tie, and collar, and, taking with him his coat and the
olive-wood box, went into the little washroom.</p>

<p>He scarcely expected to find her there when he emerged, cooled
and refreshed; but she was still there, seated as he had left
her on the lounge.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask you," she said in a low voice, "did you <em>kill</em>
them?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, Scheherazade," he replied gaily. "The Irish don't
kill; they beat up their friends; that's all. Fist and blackthorn,
my pretty lass, but nix for the knife and gun."</p>

<p>"How&mdash;did you do it?"</p>

<p>"Well, I got tired having a ham-fisted Dutchman pawing me and
closing my mouth with his big splay fingers. So I asked him to
slide overboard and shoved his friend after him."</p>

<p>"Did you shoot them?"</p>

<p>"No, I tell you!" he said disgustedly. "I hadn't a chance in
hot blood, and I couldn't do it in cold. No, Scheherazade, I didn't
shoot. I pulled a gun for dramatic effect, that's all."</p>

<p>After a silence she asked him in a low voice what he intended
to do with her.</p>

<p>"Do? Nothing! Chat affably with you until we reach town, if you
don't mind. Nothing more violent than that, Scheherazade."</p>

<p>The girl, sitting sideways on the sofa, leaned her head against
the velvet corner as though very tired. Her small hands lay in
her lap listlessly, palms up-turned.</p>

<p>"Are you really tired?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, a little."</p>

<p>He took the two pillows from his bed and placed them on the sofa.</p>

<p>"You may lie down if you like, Scheherazade."</p>

<p>"Won't you need them?"</p>

<p>"Sunburst of my soul, if I pillow my head on anything while you
are in the vicinity, it will be on that olive-wood box!"</p>

<p>For the first time the faintest trace of a smile touched her
lips. She turned, settled the pillows to her liking, and stretched
out her supple figure on the sofa with a slight sigh.</p>

<p>"Shall I talk to you, Scheherazade, or let you snuggle into the
chaste arms of Morpheus?"</p>

<p>"I can't sleep."</p>

<p>"Is it a talk-fest, then?"</p>

<p>"I am listening."</p>

<p>"Then, were the two recent gentlemen who so rudely pounced upon
me the same gentlemen who so cheerfully chased me in an automobile
when you made red fire?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I was betting on it. Nice-looking man&mdash;the one with the classical
map and the golden Frick."</p>

<p>She said nothing.</p>

<p>"Scheherazade," he continued with smiling malice, "do you realise
that you are both ornamental and young? Why so young and murderous,
fair houri? Why delight in manslaughter in any degree? Why cultivate
assault and battery? Why swipe the property of others?"</p>

<p>She closed her eyes on the pillow, but, as he remained silent,
presently opened them again.</p>

<p>"I asked them not to hurt you," she said irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"Who? Oh, your strenuous friends with the footpad technique?
Well, they obeyed you unwillingly."</p>

<p>"Did they hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. But the car-wheels might have."</p>

<p>"The car-wheels?"</p>

<p>"Yes. They were all for dumping me down the steps of the vestibule.
But I've got a nasty disposition, Scheherazade, and I kicked and
bit and screamed so lustily that I disgusted them and they simply
left the train and concluded to cut my acquaintance."</p>

<p>It was evident that his good-humoured mockery perplexed her.
Once or twice the shadow of a smile passed over her dark eyes,
but they remained uncertain and watchful.</p>

<p>"You really were astonished to see me alive again, weren't you?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I was surprised to see you, of course."</p>

<p>"Alive?"</p>

<p>"I told you that I asked them not to really hurt you."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I believe <em>that</em>, after your pistol practice
on me?"</p>

<p>"It is true," she replied, her eyes resting on him.</p>

<p>"You wished to reserve me for more pistol practice?"</p>

<p>"I have no&mdash;enmity&mdash;for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, Scheherazade!" he protested, laughing.</p>

<p>"You are wrong, Mr. Neeland."</p>

<p>"After all I did to you?"</p>

<p>To his surprise a bright blush spread over her face where it
lay framed by the pillows; she turned her head abruptly and lay
without speaking.</p>

<p>He sat thinking for a few minutes, then leaning forward from
where he sat on the bed's edge:</p>

<p>"After a man's been shot at and further intimidated with a large,
unpleasantly rusty Kurdish dagger, he is likely to proceed without
ceremony. All the same, I am sorry I had to humiliate you, Scheherazade."</p>

<p>She lay silent, unstirring.</p>

<p>"A girl would never forgive that, I know," he said. "So I shall
look for a short shrift from you if your opportunity ever comes."</p>

<p>The girl appeared to be asleep. He stood up and looked down at
her. The colour had faded from the one cheek visible. For a while
he listened to her quiet breathing, then, the imp of perversity
seizing him, and intensely diverted by the situation, he bent
over her, touched her cheek with his lips, put on his hat, took
box and suitcase, and went out to spend the remaining hour or
two in the smoking room, leaving her to sleep in peace.</p>

<p>But no sooner had he closed the door on her than the girl sat
straight up on the sofa, her face surging in colour, and her eyes
brilliant with starting tears.</p>

<p>When the train arrived at the Grand Central Station, in the grey
of a July morning, Neeland, finding the stateroom empty, lingered
to watch for her among the departing passengers.</p>

<p>But he lingered in vain; and presently a taxicab took him and
his box to the Cunard docks, and deposited him there. And an hour
later he was in his cabin on board that vast ensemble of machinery
and luxury, the Cunarder <em>Volhynia</em>, outward bound, and
headed straight at the dazzling disc of the rising sun.</p>

<p>And thought of Scheherazade faded from his mind as a tale that
is told.</p>
