<p>Clay believed that Alice Langham's visit to the mines had opened his
eyes fully to vast differences between them.  He laughed and railed at
himself for having dared to imagine that he was in a position to care
for her.  Confident as he was at times, and sure as he was of his
ability in certain directions, he was uneasy and fearful when he
matched himself against a man of gentle birth and gentle breeding, and
one who, like King, was part of a world of which he knew little, and to
which, in his ignorance concerning it, he attributed many advantages
that it did not possess.  He believed that he would always lack the
mysterious something which these others held by right of inheritance.
He was still young and full of the illusions of youth, and so gave
false values to his own qualities, and values equally false to the
qualities he lacked.  For the next week he avoided Miss Langham, unless
there were other people present, and whenever she showed him special
favor, he hastily recalled to his mind her failure to sympathize in his
work, and assured himself that if she could not interest herself in the
engineer, he did not care to have her interested in the man.  Other
women had found him attractive in himself; they had cared for his
strength of will and mind, and because he was good to look at.  But he
determined that this one must sympathize with his work in the world, no
matter how unpicturesque it might seem to her.  His work was the best
of him, he assured himself, and he would stand or fall with it.
</p><p>It was a week after the visit to the mines that President Alvarez gave
a great ball in honor of the Langhams, to which all of the important
people of Olancho, and the Foreign Ministers were invited.  Miss
Langham met Clay on the afternoon of the day set for the ball, as she
was going down the hill to join Hope and her father at dinner on the
yacht.
</p><p>"Are you not coming, too?" she asked.
</p><p>"I wish I could," Clay answered.  "King asked me, but a steamer-load of
new machinery arrived to-day, and I have to see it through the
Custom-House."
</p><p>Miss Langham gave an impatient little laugh, and shook her head. "You
might wait until we were gone before you bother with your machinery,"
she said.
</p><p>"When you are gone I won't be in a state of mind to attend to machinery
or anything else," Clay answered.
</p><p>Miss Langham seemed so far encouraged by this speech that she seated
herself in the boathouse at the end of the wharf.  She pushed her
mantilla back from her face and looked up at him, smiling brightly.
</p><p>"'The time has come, the walrus said,'" she quoted, "'to talk of many
things.'"
</p><p>Clay laughed and dropped down beside her.  "Well?" he said.
</p><p>"You have been rather unkind to me this last week," the girl began,
with her eyes fixed steadily on his.  "And that day at the mines when I
counted on you so, you acted abominably."
</p><p>Clay's face showed so plainly his surprise at this charge, which he
thought he only had the right to make, that Miss Langham stopped.
</p><p>"I don't understand," said Clay, quietly.  "How did I treat you
abominably?"
</p><p>He had taken her so seriously that Miss Langham dropped her lighter
tone and spoke in one more kindly:
</p><p>"I went out there to see your work at its best.  I was only interested
in going because it was your work, and because it was you who had done
it all, and I expected that you would try to explain it to me and help
me to understand, but you didn't.  You treated me as though I had no
interest in the matter at all, as though I was not capable of
understanding it.  You did not seem to care whether I was interested or
not.  In fact, you forgot me altogether."
</p><p>Clay exhibited no evidence of a reproving conscience.  "I am sorry you
had a stupid time," he said, gravely.
</p><p>"I did not mean that, and you know I didn't mean that," the girl
answered.  "I wanted to hear about it from you, because you did it.  I
wasn't interested so much in what had been done, as I was in the man
who had accomplished it."
</p><p>Clay shrugged his shoulders impatiently, and looked across at Miss
Langham with a troubled smile.
</p><p>"But that's just what I don't want," he said.  "Can't you see? These
mines and other mines like them are all I have in the world.  They are
my only excuse for having lived in it so long. I want to feel that I've
done something outside of myself, and when you say that you like me
personally, it's as little satisfaction to me as it must be to a woman
to be congratulated on her beauty, or on her fine voice.  That is
nothing she has done herself.  I should like you to value what I have
done, not what I happen to be."
</p><p>Miss Langham turned her eyes to the harbor, and it was some short time
before she answered.
</p><p>"You are a very difficult person to please," she said, "and most
exacting.  As a rule men are satisfied to be liked for any reason.  I
confess frankly, since you insist upon it, that I do not rise to the
point of appreciating your work as the others do.  I suppose it is a
fault," she continued, with an air that plainly said that she
considered it, on the contrary, something of a virtue.  "And if I knew
more about it technically, I might see more in it to admire.  But I am
looking farther on for better things from you.  The friends who help us
the most are not always those who consider us perfect, are they?" she
asked, with a kindly smile.  She raised her eyes to the great ore-pier
that stretched out across the water, the one ugly blot in the scene of
natural beauty about them.  "I think that is all very well," she said;
"but I certainly expect you to do more than that.  I have met many
remarkable men in all parts of the world, and I know what a strong man
is, and you have one of the strongest personalities I have known.  But
you can't mean that you are content to stop with this.  You should be
something bigger and more wide-reaching and more lasting.  Indeed, it
hurts me to see you wasting your time here over my father's interests.
You should exert that same energy on a broader map.  You could make
yourself anything you chose.  At home you would be your party's leader
in politics, or you could be a great general, or a great financier.  I
say this because I know there are better things in you, and because I
want you to make the most of your talents.  I am anxious to see you put
your powers to something worth while."
</p><p>Miss Langham's voice carried with it such a tone of sincerity that she
almost succeeded in deceiving herself.  And yet she would have hardly
cared to explain just why she had reproached the man before her after
this fashion.  For she knew that when she spoke as she had done, she
was beating about to find some reason that would justify her in not
caring for him, as she knew she could care--as she would not allow
herself to care.  The man at her side had won her interest from the
first, and later had occupied her thoughts so entirely, that it
troubled her peace of mind.  Yet she would not let her feeling for him
wax and grow stronger, but kept it down.  And she was trying now to
persuade herself that she did this because there was something lacking
in him and not in her.
</p><p>She was almost angry with him for being so much to her and for not
being more acceptable in little things, like the other men she knew.
So she found this fault with him in order that she might justify her
own lack of feeling.
</p><p>But Clay, who only heard the words and could not go back of them to
find the motive, could not know this.  He sat perfectly still when she
had finished and looked steadily out across the harbor.  His eyes fell
on the ugly ore-pier, and he winced and uttered a short grim laugh.
</p><p>"That's true, what you say," he began, "I haven't done much. You are
quite right.  Only--" he looked up at her curiously and smiled--"only
you should not have been the one to tell me of it."
</p><p>Miss Langham had been so far carried away by her own point of view that
she had not considered Clay, and now that she saw what mischief she had
done, she gave a quick gasp of regret, and leaned forward as though to
add some explanation to what she had said.  But Clay stopped her.  "I
mean by that," he said, "that the great part of the inspiration I have
had to do what little I have done came from you.  You were a sort of
promise of something better to me.  You were more of a type than an
individual woman, but your picture, the one I carry in my watch, meant
all that part of life that I have never known, the sweetness and the
nobleness and grace of civilization,--something I hoped I would some
day have time to enjoy.  So you see," he added, with an uncertain
laugh, "it's less pleasant to hear that I have failed to make the most
of myself from you than from almost any one else."
</p><p>"But, Mr. Clay," protested the girl, anxiously, "I think you have done
wonderfully well.  I only said that I wanted you to do more.  You are
so young and you have--"
</p><p>Clay did not hear her.  He was leaning forward looking moodily out
across the water, with his folded arms clasped across his knees.
</p><p>"I have not made the most of myself," he repeated; "that is what you
said."  He spoke the words as though she had delivered a sentence.
"You don't think well of what I have done, of what I am."
</p><p>He drew in his breath and shook his head with a hopeless laugh, and
leaned back against the railing of the boat-house with the weariness in
his attitude of a man who has given up after a long struggle.
</p><p>"No," he said with a bitter flippancy in his voice, "I don't amount to
much.  But, my God!" he laughed, and turning his head away, "when you
think what I was!  This doesn't seem much to you, and it doesn't seem
much to me now that I have your point of view on it, but when I
remember!"  Clay stopped again and pressed his lips together and shook
his head.  His half-closed eyes, that seemed to be looking back into
his past, lighted as they fell on King's white yacht, and he raised his
arm and pointed to it with a wave of the hand.  "When I was sixteen I
was a sailor before the mast," he said, "the sort of sailor that King's
crew out there wouldn't recognize in the same profession.  I was of so
little account that I've been knocked the length of the main deck at
the end of the mate's fist, and left to lie bleeding in the scuppers
for dead.  I hadn't a thing to my name then but the clothes I wore, and
I've had to go aloft in a hurricane and cling to a swinging rope with
my bare toes and pull at a wet sheet until my finger-nails broke and
started in their sockets; and I've been a cowboy, with no companions
for six months of the year but eight thousand head of cattle and men as
dumb and untamed as the steers themselves.  I've sat in my saddle night
after night, with nothing overhead but the stars, and no sound but the
noise of the steers breathing in their sleep.  The women I knew were
Indian squaws, and the girls of the sailors' dance-houses and the
gambling-hells of Sioux City and Abilene, and Callao and Port Said.
That was what I was and those were my companions.  Why!" he laughed,
rising and striding across the boat-house with his hands locked behind
him, "I've fought on the mud floor of a Mexican shack, with a naked
knife in my hand, for my last dollar.  I was as low and as desperate as
that.  And now--" Clay lifted his head and smiled.  "Now," he said, in
a lower voice and addressing Miss Langham with a return of his usual
grave politeness, "I am able to sit beside you and talk to you.  I have
risen to that.  I am quite content."
</p><p>He paused and looked at Miss Langham uncertainly for a few moments as
though in doubt as to whether she would understand him if he continued.
</p><p>"And though it means nothing to you," he said, "and though as you say I
am here as your father's employee, there are other places, perhaps,
where I am better known.  In Edinburgh or Berlin or Paris, if you were
to ask the people of my own profession, they could tell you something
of me.  If I wished it, I could drop this active work tomorrow and
continue as an adviser, as an expert, but I like the active part
better.  I like doing things myself.  I don't say, 'I am a salaried
servant of Mr. Langham's;' I put it differently.  I say, 'There are
five mountains of iron. You are to take them up and transport them from
South America to North America, where they will be turned into
railroads and ironclads.'  That's my way of looking at it.  It's better
to bind a laurel to the plough than to call yourself hard names.  It
makes your work easier--almost noble.  Cannot you see it that way, too?"
</p><p>Before Miss Langham could answer, a deprecatory cough from one side of
the open boat-house startled them, and turning they saw MacWilliams
coming toward them.  They had been so intent upon what Clay was saying
that he had approached them over the soft sand of the beach without
their knowing it.  Miss Langham welcomed his arrival with evident
pleasure.
</p><p>"The launch is waiting for you at the end of the pier," MacWilliams
said.  Miss Langham rose and the three walked together down the length
of the wharf, MacWilliams moving briskly in advance in order to enable
them to continue the conversation he had interrupted, but they followed
close behind him, as though neither of them were desirous of such an
opportunity.
</p><p>Hope and King had both come for Miss Langham, and while the latter was
helping her to a place on the cushions, and repeating his regrets that
the men were not coming also, Hope started the launch, with a brisk
ringing of bells and a whirl of the wheel and a smile over her shoulder
at the figures on the wharf.
</p><p>"Why didn't you go?" said Clay; "you have no business at the
Custom-House."
</p><p>"Neither have you," said MacWilliams.  "But I guess we both understand.
There's no good pushing your luck too far."
</p><p>"What do you mean by that--this time?"
</p><p>"Why, what have we to do with all of this?" cried MacWilliams. "It's
what I keep telling you every day.  We're not in that class, and you're
only making it harder for yourself when they've gone.  I call it
cruelty to animals myself, having women like that around.  Up North,
where everybody's white, you don't notice it so much, but down
here--Lord!"
</p><p>"That's absurd," Clay answered.  "Why should you turn your back on
civilization when it comes to you, just because you're not going back
to civilization by the next steamer?  Every person you meet either
helps you or hurts you.  Those girls help us, even if they do make the
life here seem bare and mean."
</p><p>"Bare and mean!" repeated MacWilliams incredulously.  "I think that's
just what they don't do.  I like it all the better because they're
mixed up in it.  I never took so much interest in your mines until she
took to riding over them, and I didn't think great shakes of my old
ore-road, either, but now that she's got to acting as engineer, it's
sort of nickel-plated the whole outfit.  I'm going to name the new
engine after her--when it gets here--if her old man will let me."
</p><p>"What do you mean?  Miss Langham hasn't been to the mines but once, has
she?"
</p><p>"Miss Langham!" exclaimed MacWilliams. "No, I mean the other, Miss
Hope.  She comes out with Ted nearly every day now, and she's learning
how to run a locomotive.  Just for fun, you know," he added,
reassuringly.
</p><p>"I didn't suppose she had any intention of joining the Brotherhood,"
said Clay.  "So she's been out every day, has she?  I like that," he
commented, enthusiastically.  "She's a fine, sweet girl."
</p><p>"Fine, sweet girl!" growled MacWilliams.  "I should hope so. She's the
best.  They don't make them any better than that, and just think, if
she's like that now, what will she be when she's grown up, when she's
learned a few things?  Now her sister.  You can see just what her
sister will be at thirty, and at fifty, and at eighty.  She's
thoroughbred and she's the most beautiful woman to look at I ever
saw--but, my son--she is too careful.  She hasn't any illusions, and no
sense of humor.  And a woman with no illusions and no sense of humor is
going to be monotonous.  You can't teach her anything.  You can't
imagine yourself telling her anything she doesn't know.  The things we
think important don't reach her at all.  They're not in her line, and
in everything else she knows more than we could ever guess at.  But
that Miss Hope!  It's a privilege to show her about.  She wants to see
everything, and learn everything, and she goes poking her head into
openings and down shafts like a little fox terrier. And she'll sit
still and listen with her eyes wide open and tears in them, too, and
she doesn't know it--until you can't talk yourself for just looking at
her."
</p><p>Clay rose and moved on to the house in silence.  He was glad that
MacWilliams had interrupted him when he did.  He wondered whether he
understood Alice Langham after all.  He had seen many fine ladies
before during his brief visits to London, and Berlin, and Vienna, and
they had shown him favor.  He had known other women not so fine.
Spanish-American senoritas through Central and South America, the wives
and daughters of English merchants exiled along the Pacific coast,
whose fair skin and yellow hair whitened and bleached under the hot
tropical suns.  He had known many women, and he could have quoted
</p><p>    "Trials and troubles amany,
</p><pre>
        Have proved me;
      One or two women, God bless them!
        Have loved me."</pre>
<p>But the woman he was to marry must have all the things he lacked.
</p><p>She must fill out and complete him where he was wanting.  This woman
possessed all of these things.  She appealed to every ambition and to
every taste he cherished, and yet he knew that he had hesitated and
mistrusted her, when he should have declared himself eagerly and
vehemently, and forced her to listen with all the strength of his will.
</p>
<p>Miss Langham dropped among the soft cushions of the launch with a sense
of having been rescued from herself and of delight in finding refuge
again in her own environment.  The sight of King standing in the bow
beside Hope with his cigarette hanging from his lips, and peering with
half-closed eyes into the fading light, gave her a sense of restfulness
and content.  She did not know what she wished from that other strange
young man.  He was so bold, so handsome, and he looked at life and
spoke of it in such a fresh, unhackneyed spirit.  He might make himself
anything he pleased.  But here was a man who already had everything, or
who could get it as easily as he could increase the speed of the
launch, by pulling some wire with his finger.
</p><p>She recalled one day when they were all on board of this same launch,
and the machinery had broken down, and MacWilliams had gone forward to
look at it.  He had called Clay to help him, and she remembered how
they had both gone down on their knees and asked the engineer and
fireman to pass them wrenches and oil-cans, while King protested
mildly, and the rest sat helplessly in the hot glare of the sea, as the
boat rose and fell on the waves.  She resented Clay's interest in the
accident, and his pleasure when he had made the machinery right once
more, and his appearance as he came back to them with oily hands and
with his face glowing from the heat of the furnace, wiping his grimy
fingers on a piece of packing.  She had resented the equality with
which he treated the engineer in asking his advice, and it rather
surprised her that the crew saluted him when he stepped into the launch
again that night as though he were the owner.  She had expected that
they would patronize him, and she imagined after this incident that she
detected a shade of difference in the manner of the sailors toward
Clay, as though he had cheapened himself to them--as he had to her.
