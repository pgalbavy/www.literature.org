<p>Marche, pacing the shabby sitting room after supper, an unlighted
cigarette between his fingers, listened to Jim recite his Latin
lesson.</p>

<p>"<em>Atque ea qui ad efeminandos animos pertinent important</em>,"
repeated the boy; and Marche nodded absently.</p>

<p>"Do you understand what that means, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly, sir."</p>

<p>Marche explained, then added smilingly: "But there is nothing
luxurious to corrupt manhood among the coast marshes down here.
Barring fever and moccasins, Jim, you ought to emerge, some day,
into the larger world equipped for trouble."</p>

<p>"I shall go out some day," said the boy.</p>

<p>Marche glanced up at the portrait of the boy's mother in its
pale-gilt oval. Near it, another nail had been driven, and on
the faded wall paper was an oval discoloration, as though another
picture had once hung there.</p>

<p>"I wish I might see your father before I go North," said Marche,
half to himself. "Isn't he well enough to let me talk to him for
a few minutes?"</p>

<p>"I will ask him," said the boy.</p>

<p>Marche paced the ragged carpet until the return of Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Father is sorry, and asks you to please excuse him," he said.</p>

<p>Marche had picked up the boy's schoolbook and was looking at
the writing on the flyleaf again. Then he raised his head, eyes
narrowing on the boy as though searching for some elusive memory
connected with him&mdash;with his name in the Latin book&mdash;perhaps with
the writing, which, somehow, had stirred in him, once more, the
same odd and uncomfortable sensation which he had experienced
when he first saw it.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Jim,' he said, 'where did you live?'"]</p>

<p>"Jim," he said, "where did you live when you lived in New York?"</p>

<p>"In Eighty-seventh Street."</p>

<p>"West?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the house&mdash;the number?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Was it a private house?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It was very tall. We lived on one floor and used
an elevator."</p>

<p>"I see. It was an apartment house."</p>

<p>The boy stood, with blonde head lowered, silently turning over
the leaves of an old magazine.</p>

<p>Marche walked out to the porch; his brows were bent slightly
inward, and he bit the end of his unlighted cigarette until the
thing became useless. Then he flung it away. A few stars watched
him above the black ramparts of the pines; a gentle wind was abroad,
bringing inland the restless voice of the sea.</p>

<p>In Marche's mind a persistent thought was groping in darkness,
vainly striving to touch and awaken memories of things forgotten.
What was it he was trying to remember? What manner of episode,
and how connected with this place, with the boy's book, with the
portrait of his mother in its oval frame? Had he seen that portrait
before? Perhaps he had seen it here, five years ago; yet that
could not be, because Herold had not been here then.</p>

<p>Was it the writing on the flyleaf that had stirred some forgotten
memory? It had seemed to him familiar, somehow&mdash;yet not like the
handwriting in Herold's business letters to him. Yet it <em>was</em>
Herold's writing&mdash;"Jim, from Daddy"&mdash;that was the inscription.
And that inscription had riveted his attention from the first
moment he saw it.</p>

<p>Who was Herold? Who was this man whose undoubtable breeding and
personal cultivation had stamped his children with the same unmistakable
distinction?</p>

<p>Somehow or other there had been a great fall in the world for
him&mdash;a terrible tumble from higher estate to land him here in
this desolation of swamp-bound silence&mdash;here where only the dark
pines broke the vast sky line, where the only sound was the far
rumor of the sea. Sick, probably with coast fever, poor, dependent,
no doubt, on the salary Marche paid him, isolated from all in
the world that made the world endurable to intelligence, responsible
for two growing children&mdash;one already a woman&mdash;what must be the
thoughts of such a man on a night like this, for instance?</p>

<p>"I want to see that man," he kept repeating to himself. "I want
to see him; and I'm going to."</p>

<p>Restless, but now always listening for the sound of a light tread
which he had come to know so well&mdash;alas!&mdash;he began to walk to
and fro, with keen glances toward the illuminated kitchen window
every time he passed it. Sometimes his mind was chaotic; sometimes
clear. The emotions which had awakened in him within the week
were complex enough to stagger a more intelligent man. And Marche
was not a fool; he was the typical product of his environment&mdash;the
result of school and college, and a New York business life carried
on in keenest competition with men as remorseless in business
as the social code permitted. Also, he went to church on Sundays,
read a Republican newspaper, and belonged to several unexceptionable
clubs.</p>

<p>That was the kind of a man he had been only a week ago&mdash;a good
fellow in the usual sense among men, acceptable to women, kind
hearted, not too cynical, and every idea in his head modeled upon
the opinions he heard expressed in that limited area wherein he
had been born and bred.</p>

<p>That was the kind of a man he had been a week ago. What was he
now&mdash;to-night&mdash;here in this waste corner of the world with the
light from a kitchen window blazing on him as though it were the
flashing splendor streaming through the barred portals of paradise?
Was it possible that he, John Benton Marche, could be actually
in love&mdash;in love with the daughter of his own game warden&mdash;with
a girl who served him at supper in apron and gingham, who served
him further in hip boots and ragged jacket&mdash;this modern Rosalind
of the marshes, as fresh and innocent, as modest and ardent, as
she of the Arden glades?</p>

<p>The kitchen door opened, and Molly Herold came down the steps
and straight toward him, unthinkingly, almost instinctively, laying
her hands in his as he met her under the leafless China tree in
the yard.</p>

<p>"I was longer than usual to-night," she said, "trying to soften
my hands with that cold cream you so kindly sent for." She lifted
them in the starlight with a little laugh. "They're a trifle better,
I think," she said, "but they're always in water, you know, either
there," she glanced around at the kitchen, "or yonder with the
decoys. But thank you all the same," she added brightly. "Are
you going to have another delightful talk, now?"</p>

<p>"Do you care to?"</p>

<p>"Of course. The idea of my not caring to talk to you," she said,
laughing at the absurdity. "Shall we go into the sitting room,
or walk in the starlight? There are no snakes out, yet," she assured
him, "though if this weather holds, the moccasins will come out."</p>

<p>"We'll walk down to the shore," he said.</p>

<p>"One moment, then." She turned and sped to the house, reappearing,
after a few minutes, wearing her ragged shooting coat.</p>

<p>"Is your father comfortable?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you."</p>

<p>"Do you think he might want you?"</p>

<p>"No. Jim sleeps next to him, and he is preparing for bed, now."
She smiled. "What a darling my brother is, isn't he, Mr. Marche?"</p>

<p>"He's a fine boy."</p>

<p>They moved on together, down the rutted lane, between dismantled
fences and ragged, leafless hedges. She was lithe and light and
sure footed, but once or twice, as they skirted puddles, he supported
her; and the touch of his hand on her body almost unnerved him.
Never had he dreamed that contact with any woman could so thrill,
so exquisitely shock. And every instant he was falling deeper
and deeper in love with her. He knew it&mdash;realized it&mdash;made no
effort to avoid it, fight it off, control it. It was only his
speech and manner that he held desperately under bit and curb,
letting his heart go to everlasting smash and his reason run riot.
And what on earth would be the end he could not imagine, for he
was leaving for the North in the morning, and he had not yet told
her.</p>

<p>As they came out upon the shore, the dory loomed up, beached,
a dark silhouette against the starlit water. She laid her hands
on the stern and vaulted lightly to her perch, sliding along to
make room for Marche.</p>

<p>From far away in the sound came the confused murmur of wild fowl
feeding. Except for that, and the ceaseless monotone of the outer
sea, there was no sound, not even the lap of water against the
bow.</p>

<p>Marche, who had been leaning forward, head bent as though watching
the water, turned to the girl abruptly. "I want to do something
for &mdash;Jim," he said.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him, not understanding.</p>

<p>"Will your father let me?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"I mean that I want to send him to a good school&mdash;a good boys'
school in the North."</p>

<p>She caught her breath, was silent for a moment, then, amazed:
"<em>Would</em> you do that? Oh, I've wished for it&mdash;dreamed of
it! But&mdash;how can you? You are so kind&mdash;so good to us&mdash;but how
could we&mdash;accept?"</p>

<p>"That's why I want to see your father."</p>

<p>"For <em>that</em>! Was it really for that, Mr. Marche?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;partly." He swallowed and looked the other way, for the
girl's excited face was very near his own as she bent forward
to search his eyes for the least change of expression&mdash;bent nearer
as though to reassure herself that he meant it seriously. For
an instant her soft breath made the night air fragrant; he felt
it, faint and fresh on his cheek, and turned sharply, biting his
lips lest he lose all self-control.</p>

<p>"Could you and your father spare him?" he asked carelessly.</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only would give him that chance!" she cried. "But&mdash;tell
me&mdash;<em>how</em> can we accept such a thing of you? Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"Would <em>you</em> accept it?" he asked, turning toward her.</p>

<p>The question startled her. She looked at him, striving to think
clearly, trying to see this offered miracle through calm, impartial
eyes.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I would do anything&mdash;almost&mdash;for Jim," she said. "I'd
have no pride left, if his chances lay in the balance. But men&mdash;my
father&mdash;may be different."</p>

<p>He said slowly: "Suppose I offered the same chance to you?"</p>

<p>"What!" she said crisply.</p>

<p>"Suppose I offered you a college finishing, Miss Herold. Would
you accept?"</p>

<p>She slowly grew scarlet under his gaze. "That would be insulting,"
she said, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Why, when only kindness is meant&mdash;as I mean it for Jim?"</p>

<p>"It is not the same. I am a grown woman capable of caring for
myself. Such an offer, however kindly meant, could only hurt me,
humiliate me&mdash;and &mdash;I thought you found me companionable
as I am. Friends do not offer to better each other&mdash;in such a
way."</p>

<p>"I have not offered it to you, Miss Herold."</p>

<p>She looked up, still flushed and brilliant eyed; then her face
changed softly. "I know it. I was foolishly sensitive. I know
you couldn't offer such a thing to me. But I wish I knew whether
we could accept for Jim. He is such a darling&mdash;so intelligent
and perfectly crazy for an education. I've saved a little&mdash;that's
why I wanted you to hire me for your bayman. You see I don't spend
anything on myself," she added, with a blush.</p>

<p>Marche was fighting hard for self-restraint; he was young and
romantic, and his heart was very full. "What I'd like to do,"
he said, "would be to send Jim to some first-rate school until
he is ready for college. Then I'd like to see him through college,
and, if he cared for it, start him with me in business."</p>

<p>"Oh," she cried softly, "is it possible! Is there&mdash;can any man
really do such heavenly things? Have you any idea what you are
saying? Do you realize what you are doing to me&mdash;with every word
you utter?"</p>

<p>"What am I doing to&mdash;to you?" he asked unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Making me your slave," she said, in a low voice, thrilling with
generous passion. "Even for the thought&mdash;even if father will not
accept&mdash;what you have said to me to-night has put me in your debt
forever. Truly&mdash;truly, I know what friendship is, now."</p>

<p>She clasped her hands tightly and said something else, sweetly
incoherent; and, in the starlight, Marche saw the tears sparkling
on her lashes.</p>

<p>With that he sprang nervously to the shore and began to tramp
up and down the shingle, his mind in a whirl, every sense, common
or the contrary, clamoring for finality&mdash;urging him to tell her
the truth&mdash;tell her that he loved her, that he wanted her&mdash;her
alone, out of all the world of women&mdash;that it was for love and
for her, and for love of her, that he offered anything, did anything,
thought anything now under the high stars or under the circling
sun.</p>

<p>And now, as he tramped savagely to and fro, he realized that
he had begun wrong; that he should have told her he loved her
first of all, and then acted, not promised.</p>

<p>Would she look on his offer scornfully, now? Would she see, in
what he asked of her, a bribe desired for the offer he had made
in her brother's behalf? She did not love him. How could she,
in a week? Never had there been even a hint of sentiment between
them. What would she think&mdash;this young girl, so tranquilly confident
in her friendship for him&mdash;what would she think of him and his
love? He knew there was nothing mercenary or material in her character;
he knew she was young, sweet tempered, reticent concerning herself,
clean hearted, and proud. How could he come blundering through
the boundaries of her friendship with such an avowal, at a moment's
notice?</p>

<p>He returned slowly to the boat and stood looking up at her; and
he saw that she was smiling down at him in the starlight.</p>

<p>"Why did you start off so abruptly and tramp up and down?" she
asked.</p>

<p>He looked up at her. "Shall we walk back, now?" he said.</p>

<p>She extended her hands to him, and he swung her to the beach.
For a moment he retained her hands; she looked at him, smiling,
thrilling with all that he had said, meeting his eyes frankly
and tenderly.</p>

<p>"You are like some glorious magic prince to me," she said, "appearing
among us here to win our hearts with a word."</p>

<p>"Have I won yours with what I have said?"</p>

<p>"Mine? Oh, don't you know it? Do you think&mdash;even if it doesn't
come true&mdash;that I can ever forget what you have wished to do for
Jim?"</p>

<p>Still holding her hands, he lifted them, joined her fingers,
and laid his lips to them. She bent her head and caught her breath
in surprise.</p>

<p>"I am going North to-morrow," he said.</p>

<p>For a moment she did not comprehend his words. Then, a trifle
dazed, she looked up at him. "To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Are you coming back?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;next year."</p>

<p>"<em>Next&mdash;year!</em>"</p>

<p>"Do you&mdash;find it&mdash;a long time?"</p>

<p>Her straight brows bent inward a little, the startled gray eyes
became clear and steady. "Of course I knew that you must go&mdash;some
time. But I had no idea that it would be so soon. Somehow, I have
thought of you as being&mdash;here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Do you care?"</p>

<p>Her honest eyes widened. "Care?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes. How greatly do you care?"</p>

<p>The straight brows contracted still more as she stood considering
him&mdash;so close that the fresh and subtle youth of her freshened
the night again with its faint perfume.</p>

<p>Again he touched her hands with his lips, she watching him palely,
out of clear, gray eyes; then, as they turned away together, he
encircled her slender waist with his arm.</p>

<p>That she was conscious of it, and not disturbed by it, was part
of her new mystery to him. Only once, as they walked, when his
circling clasp tightened, did she rest her own hand over his where
it held her body imprisoned. But she said nothing; nor had he
spoken when the belt of pines loomed against the stars once more.</p>

<p>Then, though neither had spoken, they stopped. He turned to face
her, drew her into his arms, and the beating of his heart almost
suffocated him as he looked into her eyes, clear, unshrinking
eyes of gray, with a child's question in their starry depths.</p>

<p>And he answered the question as in a dream: "I love you. I want
you for my wife. I want you to love me. You are the first woman
I have cared for. All that you are I want&mdash;no more than you are.
You, as you are now, are all that I care for in the world. Life
is young for us both, yet. Let us grow up together&mdash;if you can
love me. Can you?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Can you not care for me a little, Molly?"</p>

<p>"I do. I know&mdash;nothing about&mdash;love&mdash;real love."</p>

<p>"Can you not imagine it, dear?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>it is what I <em>have</em> imagined&mdash;a man&mdash;like
you&mdash;coming this way into my loneliness. I recognize it. I have
dreamed that it was like this. What is it that I should do&mdash;if
this is really to come true?"</p>

<p>"Love me."</p>

<p>"I would&mdash;if I knew how. I don't know how," she said wistfully.
"My heart is so full&mdash;already&mdash;of your goodness &mdash;<em>I&mdash;</em>and
then this dream I have dreamed&mdash;that a man like you should come
here and say this to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Is it in you to love me?"</p>

<p>"I'll try&mdash;if you'll tell me what to do&mdash;how to show it&mdash;to understand&#11834;"</p>

<p>He drew her closer, unresisting, and looked deep into her young
eyes, and kissed them, and then her lips, till they grew warmer
and her breath came fragrant and uneven.</p>

<p>"Can you love me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>For a moment's exquisite silence she rested her flushed face
against his shoulder, then lifted it, averted, and stepped aside,
out of the circle of his arms. Head lowered, she stood there,
motionless in the starlight, arms hanging straight; then, as he
came to her, she lifted her proud little head and laid both her
hands in his.</p>

<p>"Of those things," she said, "that a woman should be to the man
she loves, and say to that man, I am ignorant. Even how to speak
to you&mdash;now &mdash;I do not know. It is all a dream to me&mdash;except
that, in my heart, I know that I do love you. But I think that
was so from the beginning, and after you have gone away I should
have realized it some day."</p>

<p>"You darling!" he whispered. Again she surrendered to him, exquisite
in her ignorance, passive at first, then tremulously responsive.
And at last her head drooped and fell on his shoulder, and he
held her for a little longer, then released her.</p>

<p>Trembling, she crept up the stairway to her room, treading lightly
along the dark entry, dazed, fatigued, with the wonder of it all.
Then, as she laid her hand on the knob of her bedroom door, the
door of her father's room opened abruptly.</p>

<p>"Molly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she answered vaguely.</p>

<p>He stood staring at her on the threshold, fully dressed, and
she looked back at him, her eyes slightly confused by the light.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he said.</p>

<p>"With Mr. Marche."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To the dory&mdash;and back."</p>

<p>"What did he say to you, child?"</p>

<p>She came silently across the threshold and put her arms around
his neck; and the man lost every atom of his color.</p>

<p>"What did he say?" he repeated harshly.</p>

<p>"That he loves me."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"It is true, father."</p>

<p>The man held her at arm's length roughly. "Good God!" he groaned,
"how long has this been going on?"</p>

<p>"Only to-night. What do you mean, father?"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'He tells you that he&mdash;he is in love with you?'"]</p>

<p>"He tells you that he&mdash;he is in love with you? With <em>you</em>?"
repeated Herold unsteadily.</p>

<p>"Yes. It is true, too."</p>

<p>"You mean he asked you to marry him!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And I said I would."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> love <em>him</em>!"</p>

<p>The man's pallor frightened her silent. Then he dropped her arms,
which he had been clutching, and stood staring at nothing, gnawing
at his colorless lips.</p>

<p>The girl watched him with dawning terror and finally ventured
to speak. "Dear, what is the matter? Are you displeased with me?
Do you think that he is not a man I should care for? You don't
know him, dear. You have only to see him, to speak with him, hear
his voice, look into his eyes&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Good God!" groaned Herold, closing his sunken eyes. Then, almost
feeling his way out and along the dark passageway, he descended
the stairs, heavily.</p>

<p>Marche, cleaning his gun in the sitting-room, looked up in surprise,
then rose, laying aside stock, fore-end, and barrel, as Herold
came into the room. The next instant, stepping nearer, he stared
into Herold's face in silence. And so they met and confronted
each other after many years.</p>

<p>"Are <em>you</em> Herold?" said the young man, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"That is my name&mdash;now."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> have been in my employment&mdash;for five years?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Judge Gilkins gave me the chance. I could not suppose that
the club would ever become your property."</p>

<p>The younger man's face hardened. "But when it did become my property,
why had you the indecency to stay?"</p>

<p>"Where else could I go?"</p>

<p>"You had the whole world to&mdash;operate in."</p>

<p>Herold's thin face flushed. "It was fitter that I should work
for you," he said. "I have served you faithfully for five years."</p>

<p>"And unfaithfully for ten! Wasn't it enough that Vyse and I let
you go without prosecuting you? Wasn't it enough that we pocketed
our loss for your wife's sake?"</p>

<p>He checked himself in a flash of memory, turned, and looked at
the picture on the wall. Now he knew, now he understood why his
former associate's handwriting had seemed familiar after all these
years.</p>

<p>And suddenly he remembered that this man was Jim's father&mdash;and
the father of the young girl he was in love with; and the shock
drove every drop of blood out of his heart and cheeks. Ghastly,
staring, he stood confronting Herold; and the latter, leaning
heavily, shoulder against the wall, stared back at him.</p>

<p>"I could have gone on working for you," he said, "trying to save
enough to make restitution&mdash;some day. I <em>have</em> already
saved part of it. Look at me&mdash;look at my children&mdash;at the way
we live, and you'll understand how I have saved. But I <em>have</em>
saved part of what I took. I'll give you that much before you
go&mdash;before I go, too."</p>

<p>His breath came heavily, unevenly; he cleared his eyes with a
work-stained hand, fashioned for pens and ledgers.</p>

<p>"You were abroad when <em>I&mdash;</em>did what I did. Vyse was merciless.
I told him I could put it back if he'd give me the chance. But
a thief was a thief to him&mdash;particularly when his own pocket was
involved. He meant to send me to prison. The judge held him&mdash;he
was his father-in-law&mdash;and he was an old man with a wife and children
of his own."</p>

<p>Herold was silent for a moment, and his gaze became vague and
remote, then he lifted his head sharply:</p>

<p>"A man makes one slip like that and the world damns him forever.
And I tell you, Marche, that I am not dishonest by nature or in
my character. God alone knows why I took those securities, meaning,
of course, to return them, as all the poor, damned fools do mean
when they do what I did. But Vyse made it a condition that I was
to leave the country, and there was no chance of restitution unless
I could remain in New York and do what I knew how to do&mdash;no chance,
Marche&mdash;and so fortune ebbed, and my wife died, and the old judge
saw me working on the water-front in Norfolk one day, and gave
me this place. That is all."</p>

<p>"Why did you feign illness?" asked Marche, in an altered voice.</p>

<p>"You know why."</p>

<p>"You thought I'd discharge you?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>Marche stepped nearer. "Why did you come to me here to-night?"</p>

<p>Herold flushed deeply. "It was your right to know&mdash;and my daughter's
right&mdash;before she broke her heart."</p>

<p>"I see. You naturally suppose that I would scarcely care to marry
the daughter of a&#11834;" He stopped short, and Herold set his teeth.</p>

<p>"Say it," he said, "and let this end matters for all of us. Except
that I have saved seven thousand dollars toward&mdash;what I took.
I will draw you a check for it now."</p>

<p>He walked steadily to the table, laid out a thin checkbook, and
with his fountain-pen wrote out a check for seven thousand dollars
on a Norfolk bank.</p>

<p>"There you are, Marche," he said wearily. "I made most of it
buying and selling pine timber in this district. It seemed a little
like expiation, too, working here for you, unknown to you. I won't
stay, now, of course. I'll try to pay back the rest&mdash;little by
little&mdash;somehow."</p>

<p>"The way to pay it back," said Marche, "is to do the work you
are fitted for."</p>

<p>Herold looked up. "How can I?"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I could not go back to New York. I have no money to go with,
even if I could find a place for myself again."</p>

<p>"Your place is open to you."</p>

<p>Herold stared at him.</p>

<p>Marche repeated the assertion profanely. "Damnation," he said,
"if you'd talked this way to me five years ago, I'd never have
stood in your way. All I heard of the matter was what Vyse told
me. I'm not associated with him any more; I'll stand for his minding
his own affairs. The thing for you to do, Courtney, is to get
into the game again and clean up what you owe Vyse. Here's seven
thousand; you can borrow the rest from me. And then we'll go into
things again and hustle. It was a good combination, Courtney&mdash;we'd
have been rich men&mdash;except for the slip you made. Come on in with
me again. Or would you rather continue to inhabit your own private
hell?"</p>

<p>"Do you know what you are saying, Marche?" said the other hoarsely.</p>

<p>"Sure, I do. I guess you've done full time for a first offense.
Clean off the slate, Courtney. You and Vyse and I know it&mdash;nobody
else &mdash;Gilkins is dead. Come on, man! That boy of yours is
a corker! I love him&mdash;that little brother, Jim, of mine; and as
for &mdash;Molly&#11834;" His voice broke and he turned sharply aside,
saying: "It's certainly blue-bird weather, Courtney, and we all
might as well go North. Come out under the stars, and we'll talk
it over."</p>

<p>It was almost dawn when they returned. Marche's hand lay lightly
on Courtney's shoulder for a moment, as they parted.</p>

<p>Above, as Courtney stood feeling blindly for his door, Molly's
door swung softly ajar, and the girl came out in her night-dress.</p>

<p>"Father," she whispered, "is it all right?"</p>

<p>"All right, thank God, little daughter."</p>

<p>"And &mdash;I may care for him?"</p>

<p>"Surely&mdash;surely, darling, because he is the finest specimen of
manhood that walks this merciless earth."</p>

<p>"I knew it," she whispered gaily. "If you'll lend me your wrapper
a moment, I'll go to his door and say good-night to him again."</p>

<p>Her father looked at her, picked up his tattered dressing-gown
from his bed, and wrapped her in it to the chin, then kissed her
forehead.</p>

<p>So she trotted away to Marche's door and tapped softly; and when
he came and opened the door, she put her arms around his neck
and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Good night," she whispered. "I do love you, and I shall pray
all night that I may be everything that you would wish to have
me. Good night, once more&mdash;dearest of men&mdash;good night."</p>
