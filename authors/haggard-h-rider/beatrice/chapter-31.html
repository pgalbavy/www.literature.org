<p>Geoffrey reached Town a little before eleven o’clock that night--a
haunted man--haunted for life by a vision of that face still lovely
in death, floating alone upon the deep, and companioned only by the
screaming mews--or perchance now sinking or sunk to an unfathomable
grave. Well might such a vision haunt a man, the man whom alone of all
men those cold lips had kissed, and for whose dear sake this dreadful
thing was done.
</p><p>He took a cab directing the driver to go to Bolton Street and to stop
at his club as he passed. There might be letters for him there, he
thought--something which would distract his mind a little. As it chanced
there was a letter, marked “private,” and a telegram; both had been
delivered that evening, the porter said, the former about an hour ago by
hand.
</p><p>Idly he opened the telegram--it was from his lawyers: “Your cousin, the
child George Bingham, is, as we have just heard, dead. Please call on us
early to-morrow morning.”
</p><p>He started a little, for this meant a good deal to Geoffrey. It meant a
baronetcy and eight thousand a year, more or less. How delighted Honoria
would be, he thought with a sad smile; the loss of that large income had
always been a bitter pill to her, and one which she had made him swallow
again and again. Well, there it was. Poor boy, he had always been
ailing--an old man’s child!
</p><p>He put the telegram in his pocket and got into the hansom again. There
was a lamp in it and by its light he read the letter. It was from the
Prime Minister and ran thus:
</p><p>“My dear Bingham,--I have not seen you since Monday to thank you for
the magnificent speech you made on that night. Allow me to add my
congratulations to those of everybody else. As you know, the Under
Secretaryship of the Home Office is vacant. On behalf of my colleagues
and myself I write to ask if you will consent to fill it for a time,
for we do not in any way consider that the post is one commensurate with
your abilities. It will, however, serve to give you practical experience
of administration, and us the advantage of your great talents to an even
larger extent than we now enjoy. For the future, it must of course take
care of itself; but, as you know, Sir ----‘s health is not all that
could be desired, and the other day he told me that it was doubtful if
he would be able to carry on the duties of the Attorney-Generalship for
very much longer. In view of this contingency I venture to suggest that
you would do well to apply for silk as soon as possible. I have spoken
to the Lord Chancellor about it, and he says that there will be no
difficulty, as although you have only been in active practice for so
short a while, you have a good many years’ standing as a barrister. Or
if this prospect does not please doubtless some other opening to the
Cabinet can be found in time. The fact is, that we cannot in our own
interest overlook you for long.”
</p><p>Geoffrey smiled again as he finished this letter. Who could have
believed a year ago that he would have been to-day in a position to
receive such an epistle from the Prime Minister of England? Ah, here was
the luck of the Drowned One’s shoe with a vengeance. And what was it all
worth to him now?
</p><p>He put the letter in his pocket with the telegram and looked out. They
were turning into Bolton Street. How was little Effie, he wondered? The
child seemed all that was left him to care for. If anything happened to
her--bah, he would not think of it!
</p><p>He was there now. “How is Miss Effie?” he asked of the servant who
opened the door. At that moment his attention was attracted by the dim
forms of two people, a man and a woman, who were standing not far from
the area gate, the man with his arm round the woman’s waist. Suddenly
the woman appeared to catch sight of the cab and retired swiftly down
the area. It crossed his mind that her figure was very like that of
Anne, the French nurse.
</p><p>“Miss Effie is doing nicely, sir, I’m told,” answered the man.
</p><p>Geoffrey breathed more freely. “Where is her ladyship?” he asked. “In
Effie’s room?”
</p><p>“No, sir,” answered the man, “her ladyship has gone to a ball. She left
this note for you in case you should come in.”
</p><p>He took the note from the hall table and opened it.
</p><p>“Dear Geoffrey,” it ran, “Effie is so much better that I have made up my
mind to go to the duchess’s ball after all. She would be so disappointed
if I did not come, and my dress is quite <u>lovely</u>. Had your mysterious
business anything to do with <u>Bryngelly</u>?--
</p><p>“Yours, Honoria.”
</p><p>“She would go on to a ball from her mother’s funeral,” said Geoffrey to
himself, as he walked up to Effie’s room; “well, it is her nature and
there’s an end of it.”
</p><p>He knocked at the door of Effie’s room. There was no answer, so he
walked in. The room was lit but empty--no, not quite! On the floor,
clothed only in her white night-shirt, lay his little daughter, to all
appearance dead.
</p><p>With something like an oath he sprang to her and lifted her. The face
was pale and the small hands were cold, but the breast was still hot and
fevered, and the heart beat. A glance showed him what had happened. The
child being left alone, and feeling thirsty, had got out of bed and gone
to the water bottle--there was the tumbler on the floor. Then weakness
had overcome her and she had fainted--fainted upon the cold floor with
the inflammation still on her.
</p><p>At that moment Anne entered the room sweetly murmuring, “Ça va bien,
chérie?”
</p><p>“Help me to put the child into bed,” said Geoffrey sternly. “Now ring
the bell--ring it again.
</p><p>“And now, woman--go. Leave this house at once, this very night. Do you
hear me? No, don’t stop to argue. Look here! If that child dies I will
prosecute you for manslaughter; yes, I saw you in the street,” and he
took a step towards her. Then Anne fled, and her face was seen no more
in Bolton Street or indeed in this country.
</p><p>“James,” said Geoffrey to the servant, “send the cook up here--she is
a sensible woman; and do you take a hansom and drive to the doctor, and
tell him to come here at once, and if you cannot find him go for another
doctor. Then go to the Nurses’ Home, near St. James’ Station, and get a
trained nurse--tell them one must be had from somewhere instantly.”
</p><p>“Yes, sir. And shall I call for her ladyship at the duchess’s, sir?”
</p><p>“No,” he answered, frowning heavily, “do not disturb her ladyship. Go
now.”
</p><p>“That settles it,” said Geoffrey, as the man went. “Whatever happens,
Honoria and I must part. I have done with her.”
</p><p>He had indeed, though not in the way he meant. It would have been
well for Honoria if her husband’s contempt had not prevented him from
summoning her from her pleasure.
</p><p>The cook came up, and between them they brought the child back to life.
</p><p>She opened her eyes and smiled. “Is that you, daddy,” she whispered, “or
do I dreams?”
</p><p>“Yes, dear, it is I.”
</p><p>“Where has you been, daddy--to see Auntie Beatrice?”
</p><p>“Yes, love,” he said, with a gasp.
</p><p>“Oh, daddy, my head do feel funny; but I don’t mind now you is come
back. You won’t go away no more, will you, daddy?”
</p><p>“No, dear, no more.”
</p><p>After that she began to wander a little, and finally dropped into a
troubled sleep.
</p><p>Within half an hour both the doctor and the nurse arrived. The former
listened to Geoffrey’s tale and examined the child.
</p><p>“She may pull through it,” he said, “she has got a capital constitution;
but I’ll tell you what it is--if she had lain another five minutes in
that draught there would have been an end of her. You came in the nick
of time. And now if I were you I should go to bed. You can do no good
here, and you look dreadfully ill yourself.”
</p><p>But Geoffrey shook his head. He said he would go downstairs and smoke a
pipe. He did not want to go to bed at present; he was too tired.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile the ball went merrily. Lady Honoria never enjoyed herself
more in her life. She revelled in the luxurious gaiety around her like
a butterfly in the sunshine. How good it all was--the flash of diamonds,
the odour of costly flowers, the homage of well-bred men, the envy of
other women. Oh! it was a delightful world after all--that is when one
did not have to exist in a flat near the Edgware Road. But Heaven be
praised! thanks to Geoffrey’s talents, there was an end of flats and
misery. After all, he was not a bad sort of husband, though in many ways
a perfect mystery to her. As for his little weakness for the Welsh girl,
really, provided that there was no scandal, she did not care twopence
about it.
</p><p>“Yes, I am so glad you admire it. I think it is rather a nice dress,
but then I always say that nobody in London can make a dress like Madame
Jules. Oh, no, Geoffrey did not choose it; he thinks of other things.”
</p><p>“Well, I’m sure you ought to be proud of him, Lady Honoria,” said the
handsome Guardsman to whom she was talking; “they say at mess that he is
one of the cleverest men in England. I only wish I had a fiftieth part
of his brains.”
</p><p>“Oh, please do not become clever, Lord Atleigh; please don’t, or I
shall really give you up. Cleverness is all very well, but it isn’t
everything, you know. Yes, I will dance if you like, but you must go
slowly; to be quite honest, I am afraid of tearing my lace in this
crush. Why, I declare there is Garsington, my brother, you know,” and
she pointed to a small red-haired man who was elbowing his way towards
them. “I wonder what he wants; it is not at all in his line to come to
balls. You know him, don’t you? he is always racing horses, like you.”
</p><p>But the Guardsman had vanished. For reasons of his own he did not wish
to meet Garsington. Perhaps he too had been a member of a certain club.
</p><p>“Oh, there you are, Honoria,” said her brother, “I thought that I should
be sure to find you somewhere in this beastly squash. Look here, I have
something to tell you.”
</p><p>“Good news or bad?” said Lady Honoria, playing with her fan. “If it is
bad, keep it, for I am enjoying myself very much, and I don’t want my
evening spoilt.”
</p><p>“Trust you for that, Honoria; but look here, it’s jolly good, about as
good as can be for that prig of a husband of yours. What do you think?
that brat of a boy, the son of old Sir Robert Bingham and the cook or
some one, you know, is----”
</p><p>“Not dead, not dead?” said Honoria in deep agitation.
</p><p>“Dead as ditch-water,” replied his lordship. “I heard it at the club.
There was a lawyer fellow there dining with somebody there, and they
got talking about Bingham, when the lawyer said, ‘Oh, he’s Sir Geoffrey
Bingham now. Old Sir Robert’s heir is dead. I saw the telegram myself.’”
</p><p>“Oh, this is almost too good to be true,” said Honoria. “Why, it means
eight thousand a year to us.”
</p><p>“I told you it was pretty good,” said her brother. “You ought to stand
me a commission out of the swag. At any rate, let’s go and drink to the
news. Come on, it is time for supper and I am awfully done. I must screw
myself up.”
</p><p>Lady Honoria took his arm. As they walked down the wide flower-hung
stair they met a very great Person indeed, coming up.
</p><p>“Ah, Lady Honoria,” said the great Person, “I have something to say that
will please you, I think,” and he bent towards her, and spoke very low,
then, with a little bow, passed on.
</p><p>“What is the old boy talking about?” asked her brother.
</p><p>“Why, what do you think? We are in luck’s way to-night. He says that
they are offering Geoffrey the Under Secretaryship of the Home Office.”
</p><p>“He’ll be a bigger prig than ever now,” growled Lord Garsington. “Yes,
it is luck though; let us hope it won’t turn.”
</p><p>They sat down to supper, and Lord Garsington, who had already been
dining, helped himself pretty freely to champagne. Before them was a
silver candelabra and on each of the candles was fixed a little painted
paper shade. One of them got wrong, and a footman tried to reach over
Lord Garsington’s head to put it straight.
</p><p>“I’ll do it,” said he.
</p><p>“No, no; let the man,” said Lady Honoria. “Look! it is going to catch
fire!”
</p><p>“Nonsense,” he answered, rising solemnly and reaching his arm towards
the shade. As he touched it, it caught fire; indeed, by touching it he
caused it to catch fire. He seized hold of it, and made an effort to put
it out, but it burnt his fingers.
</p><p>“Curse the thing!” he said aloud, and threw it from him. It fell flaming
in his sister’s dress among the thickest of the filmy laces; they
caught, and instantly two wreathing snakes of fire shot up her. She
sprang from her seat and rushed screaming down the room, an awful mass
of flame!
</p>
<p>In ten more minutes Lady Honoria had left this world and its pleasures
to those who still lived to taste them.
</p>
<p>An hour passed. Geoffrey still sat brooding heavily over his pipe in the
study in Bolton Street and waiting for Honoria, when a knock came to his
door. The servants had all gone to bed, all except the sick nurse.
He rose and opened it himself. A little red-haired, pale-faced man
staggered in.
</p><p>“Why, Garsington, is it you? What do you want at this hour?”
</p><p>“Screw yourself up, Bingham, I’ve something to tell you,” he answered in
a thick voice.
</p><p>“What is it? another disaster, I suppose. Is somebody else dead?”
</p><p>“Yes; somebody is. Honoria’s dead. Burnt to death at the ball.”
</p><p>“Great God! Honoria burnt to death. I had better go----”
</p><p>“I advise you not, Bingham. I wouldn’t go to the hospital if I were you.
Screw yourself up, and if you can, give me something to drink--I’m about
done--I must screw myself up.”
</p>
<p>And here we may leave this most fortunate and gifted man. Farewell to
Geoffrey Bingham.
</p>
<p><strong>ENVOL</strong>
</p><p>Thus, then, did these human atoms work out their destinies, these little
grains of animated dust, blown hither and thither by a breath which came
they knew not whence.
</p><p>If there be any malicious Principle among the Powers around us that
deigns to find amusement in the futile vagaries of man, well might it
laugh, and laugh again, at the great results of all this scheming,
of all these desires, loves and hates; and if there be any pitiful
Principle, well might it sigh over the infinite pathos of human
helplessness. Owen Davies lost in his own passion; Geoffrey crowned with
prosperity and haunted by undying sorrow; Honoria perishing wretchedly
in her hour of satisfied ambition; Beatrice sacrificing herself in love
and blindness, and thereby casting out her joy.
</p><p>Oh, if she had been content to humbly trust in the Providence above her;
if she had but left that deed undared for one short week!
</p><p>But Geoffrey still lived, and the child recovered, after hanging for
a while between life and death, and was left to comfort him. May she
survive to be a happy wife and mother, living under conditions more
favourable to her well-being than those which trampled out the life of
that mistaken woman, the ill-starred, great-souled Beatrice, and broke
her father’s heart.
</p>
<p>Say--what are we? We are but arrows winged with fears and shot from
darkness into darkness; we are blind leaders of the blind, aimless
beaters of this wintry air; lost travellers by many stony paths ending
in one end. Tell us, you, who have outworn the common tragedy and passed
the narrow way, what lies beyond its gate? You are dumb, or we cannot
hear you speak.
</p>
<p>But Beatrice knows to-day!
