<p>When at last they were in the hut and the door-board had been safely
closed, Rachel took Noie in her arms and kissed her. But Noie did not kiss
her back; she only pressed her hand against her forehead.
</p><p>“Why do you not kiss me, Noie?” asked Rachel.
</p><p>“How can I kiss you, Inkosazana,” replied the girl humbly, “I who am but
the dog at your feet, the dog whom twice it has pleased you to save from
death.”
</p><p>“Inkosazana!” exclaimed Rachel. “I weary of that name. I am but a woman
like yourself, and I hate this part which I must play.”
</p><p> “Yet it is a high part, and you play it very well. While I listened to
you to-night, Zoola, twice and thrice I wondered if you are not something
more than you deem yourself to be. That beautiful body of yours is but a
cup like those of other women, but say, who fills the cup with the wine of
wisdom? Why do kings and councillors fear you, and why do you fear
nothing? Why did dead Seyapi talk to me of you in dreams? What strange
chance gave you that name of yours and made you holy in these men’s eyes?
What power teaches you the truth and gives you wit and strength to speak
it? Why are you different from the rest of maidens, white or black?”
</p><p>“I do not know, Noie. Something tells me what to do and say. Also, I
understand these Zulus, and you have taught me much. You told me all the
hidden tale of yonder Mopo a year gone by, or more, as you have told me
many of the darkest secrets of this people that you had from your father,
who knew them all. At the pinch I remembered it, no more, and played upon
them by my knowledge.”
</p><p>“What was it you said to Mopo under your cloak, Lady?”
</p><p>Rachel smiled as she answered:
</p><p>“I only asked him if it were not in his mind, having killed one king, to
kill another also, and that spear went home.”
</p><p>“Ah!” exclaimed Noie in admiration, “at least I never told you that.”
</p><p>“No; I read it in his eyes; for a moment all his heart was open to
me--yes, and the heart of Dingaan also. He fears Mopo, and Mopo hates him,
and one day hate and fear will come together.”
</p><p>“Ah!” said Noie again, “you know much.”
</p><p>“Yes,” answered Rachel with sudden passion, “more than I wish to know.
Noie, you are right, I am not altogether as others are; there is a power
in my blood. I see and hear what should not be seen and heard; at times
fears fill me, or joys lift me up, and I think that I draw hear to another
world than ours. No; it is folly. I am over-wrought. Who would not be that
must endure so much and be set upon this throne, a goddess among
barbarians with life and death upon my lips? Oh! when the King asked me
his riddle I knew not what to answer, who feared lest ten thousand lives
might pay the price of a girl’s incautious words. Then that meteor broke;
there have been several this night, but none noted them till I looked
upwards, and you know the rest. Let them guess its meaning, which they
cannot, for it has none.”
</p><p>“Why did you not speak more plainly, Zoola?”
</p><p>“Oh! because I dared not. Who am I to meddle with such matters, who came
here but to save you? I warned them not to make war upon the Boers; what
more could I do? Moreover, it is useless, for fight they must and will and
pay the price. Of that I am sure. I feel it here,” and she pressed her
hand upon her heart. “Yes, and other nearer things! Oh! Noie, I would that
I were back at home. Say, can we start to-morrow at the dawn?”
</p><p>Noie shook her head.
</p><p>“I do not think that they will let you go; they will keep you to be their
great doctoress. You should not have come. I sent you word--what did my
life matter?”
</p><p>“Keep me,” answered Rachel, stamping her foot. “They dare not; here at
least I am the Inkosazana, and I will be obeyed.”
</p><p>Noie made no answer; only she said:
</p><p>“Ishmael is here. I have seen him. He wished to have me killed at once
because he is afraid of me. But when he was sure that you were coming,
Dingaan would not break his word which he had sent to you.”
</p><p>Rachel’s face fell.
</p><p>“Ishmael!” she exclaimed in dismay, then recovered herself and added:
“Well, I am not afraid of Ishmael, for here his life is in my hand. Oh! I
am worn out; I cannot talk of the man to-night. I must sleep, Noie, I must
sleep. Come, lie at my side and let us sleep.”
</p><p>“Nay,” answered the girl; “my place is at the door. But drink this milk
and lay you down without fear, for I will watch.”
</p><p>Rachel obeyed, and Noie sat by her, holding her hand, till presently her
eyes shut and she slept. But Noie did not sleep. All that night she sat
there watching and listening, till at length the dawn came and she lay
down also by the door and rested.
</p><p>The sun was high in the heavens when Rachel woke.
</p><p>“Good morrow to you, Zoola,” said the sweet voice of Noie. “You have slept
well. Now you must rise, bathe yourself and eat, for already messengers
from the King have been to the outer gate, saying that they wait to escort
you to a better house that has been made ready for you.”
</p><p>“I hoped that they waited to escort me out of Zululand,” answered Rachel.
</p><p>“I asked them of that, Zoola, but they declared it must not be, as the
council of the doctors had been summoned to consider your sayings, and two
days will pass before it can meet. Also they declare that your horse is
sick and not fit to travel, meaning that they will not let you go.”
</p><p> “But I have the right to go, Noie.”
</p><p>“The bird has the right to fly, but what if it is in a cage, Zoola?”
</p><p>“I am queen here, Noie; the bars will burst at my word.”
</p><p>“It may be so, Zoola, but what if the bird should find that it has no nest
to fly to?”
</p><p>“What do you mean?” asked Rachel, paling.
</p><p>“Only that it seems best that you should not anger these Zulus, Lady, lest
it should come into their minds to destroy your nest, thinking that so you
might come to love this cage. No, no, I have heard nothing, but I guess
their thoughts. You need rest; bide here, where you are safe, a day or
two, and let us see what happens.”
</p><p>“Speak plainly, Noie. I do not understand your parable of birds and
cages.”
</p><p>“Zoola, I obey. I think that if you say you will go, none, not the King
himself, would dare to stay you, though you would have to go on foot, for
then that horse would die. But an impi would go with you, or before you,
and woe betide those who held you from returning to Zululand! Do you
understand me now?”
</p><p>“Yes,” answered Rachel. “You mean!--oh! I cannot speak it. I will remain
here a few days.”
</p><p>So she rose and bathed herself and was dressed by Noie, and ate of the
food that had been brought to the door of the hut. Then she went out, and
in the little courtyard found a litter waiting that was hung round with
grass mats.
</p><p>“The King’s word is that you should enter the litter,” said Noie.
</p><p>She did so, whereon Noie clapped her hands and girls in bead dresses ran
in, and having prostrated themselves before the litter, lifted it up and
carried it away, Noie walking at its side.
</p><p>Rachel, peeping between the mats, saw that she was borne out of the town,
surrounded, but at a distance, by a guard of hundreds of armed men.
Presently they began to ascend a hill, whereon grew many trees, and after
climbing it for a while, reached a large kraal with huts between the outer
and inner fence, and in its centre a great space of park-like land through
which ran a stream.
</p><p>Here, by the banks of the stream, stood a large new hut, and behind at a
little distance two or three other huts. In front of this great hut the
litter was set down by, the bearers, who at once went away. Then at Noie’s
bidding Rachel came out of it and looked at the place which had been given
her in which to dwell.
</p><p>It was a beautiful spot, away from the dust and the noises of the Great
Kraal, and so placed upon a shoulder of the hillside that the soldiers who
guarded this House of the Inkosazana, as it was called, could not be seen
or heard. Yet Rachel looked at it with distaste, feeling that it was that
cage of which Noie had spoken,
</p><p>A cage it proved indeed, a solitary cage, for here Rachel abode in regal
seclusion and in state that could only be called awful. No man might
approach her house unbidden, and the maidens who waited upon her did so
with downcast eyes, never speaking, and falling on to their knees if
addressed. On the first day of her imprisonment, for it was nothing less,
an unhappy Zulu, through ignorance or folly, slipped through the outer
guard and came near to the inner fence. Rachel, who was seated above,
heard some shouts of rage and horror, and saw soldiers running towards
him, and in another minute a body being carried away upon a shield. He had
died for his sacrilege.
</p><p>Once a day ambassadors came to her from the King to ask of her health, and
if she had orders to give, but now even these, men were not allowed to
look upon her. They were led in by the women, each of them with a piece of
bark cloth over his head, and from beneath this cloth they addressed her
as though she were in truth divine. On the first day she bade them tell
the King that her mission being ended, it was her desire to depart to her
own home beyond the river. They heard her words in silence, then asked if
she had anything to add. She replied--yes, it was her will that they
should cease to wear veils in her presence, also that no more men should
be killed upon her account as had happened that morning. They said that
they would convey the order at once, as several were under sentence of
death who had argued as to whether she were really the Inkosazana, So she
sent them away instantly, fearing lest they should be too late, and they
were led off backwards bowing and giving the royal salute. Afterwards she
rejoiced to hear that her commands had arrived just in time, and that the
blood of these poor people was not upon her head.
</p><p>Next day the messengers returned at the same hour, unveiled as she
desired, bearing the answer of the King and his council. It was to the
effect that the Inkosazana had no need to ask permission to come or to go.
Her Spirit, they knew, was mighty and could wander where it willed; all
the impis of the Zulus could not hold her Sprint. But--and here came the
sting of this clever answer--it was necessary, until her sayings had been
considered, that the body in which that Spirit abode should remain with
them a while. Therefore the King and his counsellors and the whole nation
of the Zulus prayed her to be satisfied with the sending of her Spirit
across the Tugela, leaving her body to dwell a space in the House of the
Inkosazana.
</p><p>Rachel looked at them in despair, for what was she to reply to such
reasoning as this? Before she could make up her mind, their spokesman said
that a white man, Ibubesi, who said that he had often spoken with her,
asked leave to visit her in her house.
</p><p>Now Rachel thought a while. Ishmael was the last person in the whole world
whom she wished to see. After the interview when they parted, and all that
had happened since, it could not be otherwise. She remembered the threats
he had uttered then, and to her father afterwards, the brutal and
revolting threats. Some of these had been directed against Noie, and
subsequently Noie was kidnapped by the Zulus. That those directed at
herself had not been fulfilled was, she felt sure, due to a lack of
opportunity alone.
</p><p>Little wonder, then, that she feared and hated the man. Still he was of
white blood, and perhaps for this reason had authority among the Zulus,
who, as she knew, often consulted him. Moreover, notwithstanding his
vapourings, like the Zulus whose superstitions he had contracted, he
looked upon herself with something akin to fear. If she saw him she had no
cause to dread anything that he could do to her, at any rate in this
country where she was supreme, whereas on the other hand she might obtain
information from him which would be very useful, or make use of him to
enable her to escape from Zululand. On the whole, then, it seemed wisest
to grant him an interview, especially as she gathered from the fact that
the question was raised by Dingaan’s indunas, that for some reason of his
own, the King hoped that she would do so.
</p><p>Still she hesitated, loathing and despising him as she did.
</p><p>“You have heard,” she said in English to Noie, who stood behind her. “Now
what shall I say?”
</p><p>“Say--come,” answered Noie in the same tongue.
</p><p>“Read his black heart and find out truth; he no can keep it from you.
Say--come with soldiers. If he behave bad, tell them kill him. They obey
you. No mind me. I not afraid of that wild beast now.”
</p><p>Then Rachel said to the indunas:
</p><p>“I hear the King’s word, and understand that he wishes me to receive this
Ibubesi. Yet I know that man, as I know all men, white and black. He is an
evil man, and it is not my pleasure to speak with him alone. Let him come
with a guard of six captains, and let the captains be armed with spears,
so that if I give the word there may be an end of this Ibubesi.”
</p><p>Then the messengers saluted and departed as before.
</p><p> On the morrow at about the same hour a praiser, or herald, arrived
outside the inner fence of the kraal, and after he had shouted out
Rachel’s titles, attributes, beauties and supernatural powers for at least
ten minutes, never repeating himself, announced that the indunas of the
King were without accompanied by the white man, Ibubesi, awaiting her
permission to enter. She gave it through Noie; and, the horn wand in her
hand, seated herself upon a carved stool in front of the great hut.
Presently an altercation arose upon the further side of the reed fence in
which she recognised Ishmael’s strident voice, mingled with the deeper
tones of the Zulus, who seemed to be insisting upon something.
</p><p>“They command him to take off his headdress,” said Noie, “and threaten to
beat him if he will not.”
</p><p>“Go, tell them to admit him as he is, that I may see his face, and learn
if he be the white man whom I knew, or another,” answered Rachel, and she
went.
</p><p>Then the gate was opened and the messengers were led in by women. After
these came six captains, carrying broad spears, as she had commanded, and
last of all Ishmael himself. Rachel’s whole nature shrank at the sight of
his dark, handsome features. She loathed the man now as always; her
instinct warned her of danger at his hands. Also she remembered his
threats when last they met and she rejected him, and what had passed
between him and her father on the following day. But of all this she
showed nothing, remaining seated in silence with calm, set face.
</p><p>Ishmael was advancing with a somewhat defiant air. Except for a kaross
upon his shoulders he wore European dress, and the ridiculous hat with the
white ostrich feather in it, both of them now much the worse for wear,
which she remembered so well. Also he had a lighted pipe in his mouth.
Presently one of the captains appeared to become suddenly aware of this
pipe, for, stretching out his hand, he snatched it away, and the hat with
it, throwing them upon the ground. Ishmael, whose teeth and lips were
hurt, turned on the man with an oath and struck him, whereon instantly he
was seized, and would perhaps have been killed before Rachel could
interfere had it not been unlawful to shed blood in her presence. As it
was, with a motion of her wand, she signified that he was to be loosed, a
command that Noie interpreted to them. At any rate, they let him go,
though a captain placed his feet on the hat and pipe. Then Ishmael came
forward and said awkwardly:
</p><p>“How do you do? I did not expect to see you here,” and he devoured her
beauty with his bold, greedy eyes, though not without doubt and dread, or
so thought Rachel.
</p><p> Taking no notice of his greeting, she said in a cold voice:
</p><p>“I have sent for you here to ask if you have any reason as to why I should
not order you to be killed for your crime against my servant, Noie, and
therefore against me?”
</p><p>Now Ishmael paled, for he had not expected such a welcome, and began to
deny the thing.
</p><p>“Spare your falsehoods,” went on Rachel. “I have it from the King’s lips,
and from my own knowledge. Remember only that here I am the Inkosazana,
with power of life and death. If I speak the word, or point at you with
this wand, in a minute you will have gone to your account.”
</p><p>“Inkosazana or not,” he answered in a cowed voice, “you know too much.
Well, then, she was taken that you might follow her to Zululand to ask her
life, and you see that the plan was good, for you came; and,” he added,
recovering some of his insolence and familiarity: “we are here together,
two white people among all these silly niggers.”
</p><p>Rachel looked him up and down; then she looked at the indunas seated in
silence before her, at the great limbed captains with their broad spears
beyond, reminding her in their plumes and attitudes of some picture that
she had seen of Roman gladiators about to die. Lastly she looked at the
delicately shaped Noie by her side, with her sweet, inscrutable face, the
woman whose parents and kin this outcast had brought to a bloody death,
the woman whom to forward his base ends he had vilely striven to murder.
Slowly she looked at them all and at him, and said:
</p><p>“Shall I explain to these nobles and captains what you call them, and what
you are called among your own people? Shall I tell them something of your
story, Mr. Ishmael?”
</p><p>“You can do what you like,” he answered sullenly. “You know why I got you
here--because I love you: I told you that many months ago. While you were
down at Ramah I had no chance with you, because of that old hypocrite of a
father of yours, and this black girl,” and he looked at Noie viciously.
“Here I thought that it would be different--that you would be glad of my
company, but you have turned yourself into a kind of goddess and hold me
off,” and he paused.
</p><p>“Go on,” said Rachel.
</p><p>“All right, I will. You may think yourself a goddess, as I do myself
sometimes. But I know that you are a woman too, and that soon you will get
tired of this business. You want to go home to your father and mother,
don’t you? Well, you can’t. You are a prisoner here, for these fools have
got it into their heads that you are their Spirit, and that it would be
unlucky to let you out of the country. So here you must stop, for years
perhaps, or till they are sick of you and kill you. Just understand,
Rachel, that nobody can help you to escape except me, and that I shan’t do
so for nothing.”
</p><p>Rachel straightened herself upon her seat, gripping the edge of it with
her hands, for her temper was rising, while Noie bent forward and said
something in her ear.
</p><p>“What is that black devil whispering to you?” he asked. “Telling you to
have me killed, I expect. Well, you daren’t, for what would your holy
parents say? It would be murder, wouldn’t it, and you would go to hell,
where I daresay you come from, for otherwise how could you be such a
witch? Look here,” he went on, changing his tone, “don’t let’s squabble.
Make it up with me. I’ll get you clear of this and marry you afterwards on
the square. If you won’t, it will be the worse for you--and everybody
else, yes, everybody else.”
</p><p>“Mr. Ishmael,” answered Rachel calmly, “you are making a very great
mistake, about my scruples as to taking life I mean, amongst other things.
Once when it was necessary you saw me kill a man. Well, if I am forced to
it, what I did then I will do again, only not with my own hand. Mr.
Ishmael, you said just now that you could get me out of Zululand. I take
you at your word, not for my own sake, for I am comfortable enough here,
but for that of my father and mother, who will be anxious,” and her voice
weakened a little as she spoke of them.
</p><p>“Do you? Well, I won’t. I am comfortable here also, and shall be more so
as the husband of the Inkosazana. This is a very pretty kraal, and it is
quite big enough for two,” he added with an amorous sneer.
</p><p>Now for a minute at least Rachel sat still and rigid. When she spoke again
it was in a kind of gasp:
</p><p>“Never,” she said, “have you gone nearer to your death, you wanderer
without name or shame. Listen now. I give you one week to arrange my
escape home. If it is not done within that time, I will pay you back for
those words. Be silent, I will hear no more.”
</p><p>Then she called out:
</p><p>“Rise, men, and bear the message of the Inkosazana to Dingaan, King of the
Zulus. Say to Dingaan that this wandering white dog whom he has sent into
my house has done me insult. Say that he has asked me, the
Inkosazana-y-Zoola, to be one of his wives.”
</p><p>At these words the counsellors and captains uttered a shout of rage, and
two of the latter seized Ishmael by the arm, lifting their spears to
plunge them into him. Rachel waved her wand and they let them fall again.
</p><p>“Not yet,” she said. “Take him to the King, and if my word comes to the
King, then he dies, and not till then. I would not have his vile blood on
my hands. Unless I speak, I, Queen of the Heavens, leave him to the
vengeance of the Heavens. My mantle is over him, lead him back to the King
and let me see his face no more.”
</p><p>“We hear and it shall be so,” they answered with one voice, then
forgetting their ceremony hustled Ishmael from the kraal.
</p><p>“Have I done well?” asked Rachel of Noie, when they were alone.
</p><p>“No, Zoola,” she answered, “you should have killed the snake while you
were hot against him, since when your blood grows cold you can never do
it, and he will live to bite you.”
</p><p>“I have no right to kill a man, Noie, just because he makes love to me,
and I hate him. Also, if I did so he could not help me to escape from
Zululand, which he will do now because he is afraid of me.”
</p><p>“Will he be afraid of you when you are both across the Tugela?” asked
Noie. “Inkosazana, give me power and ask no questions. Ibubesi killed my
father and mother and brethren, and has tried to kill me. Therefore my
heart would not be sore if, after the fashion of this land, I paid him
spears for battle-axes, for he deserves to die.”
</p><p>“Perhaps, Noie, but not by my word.”
</p><p>“Perhaps by your hand, then,” said Noie, looking at her curiously. “Well,
soon or late he will die a red death--the reddest of deaths, I learned
that from the spirit of my father.”
</p><p>“The spirit of your father?” said Rachel, looking at her.
</p><p>“Certainly, it speaks to me often and tells me many things, though I may
not repeat them to you till they are accomplished. Thus I was not afraid
in the hands of Dingaan, for it told me that you would save me.”
</p><p>“I wish it would speak to me and tell me when I can go home,” said Rachel
with a sigh.
</p><p>“It would if it could, Zoola, but it cannot because the curtain is too
thick. Had all you loved been slain before your eyes, then the veil would
be worn thin as mine is, and through it, you who are akin to them, would
hear the talk of the ghosts, and dimly see them wandering beneath their
trees.”
</p><p>“Beneath their trees----!”
</p><p>“Yes, the trees of their life, of which all the boughs are deeds and all
the leaves are words, under the shadow of which they must abide for ever.
My people could tell you of those trees, and perhaps they will one day
when we visit them together. Nay, pay no heed, I was wandering in my talk.
It is the sight of that wild beast, Ibubesi. You will not let me kill him!
Well, doubtless it is fated so. I think one day you will be sorry--but too
late.”
