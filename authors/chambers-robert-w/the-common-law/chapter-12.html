<p>Mrs. Hind-Willet, born to the purple&mdash;or rather entitled to a
narrow border of discreet mauve on all occasions of ceremony in
Manhattan, was a dreamer of dreams. One of her dreams concerned
her hyphenated husband, and she put him away; another concerned
Penrhyn Cardemon; and she woke up. But the persistent visualisation,
which had become obsession, of a society to be formed out of the
massed intellects of Manhattan regardless of race, morals, or
previous condition of social servitude&mdash;a gentle intellectual
affinity which knew no law of art except individual inspiration,
haunted her always. And there was always her own set to which
she could retreat if desirable.</p>

<p>She had begun with a fashionable and semi-fashionable nucleus
which included Mrs. Atherstane, the Countess d'Enver, Latimer
Varyck, Olaf Dennison, and Pedro Carrillo, and then enlarged the
circle from those perpetual candidates squatting anxiously upon
the social step-ladder all the way from the bottom to the top.</p>

<p>The result was what Ogilvy called intellectual local option;
and though he haunted this agglomeration at times, particularly
when temporarily smitten by a pretty face or figure, he was under
no illusions concerning it or the people composing it.</p>

<p>Returning one afternoon from a reception at Mrs. Atherstane's
he replied to Annan's disrespectful inquiries and injurious observations:</p>

<p>"You're on to that joint, Henry; it's a saloon, not a salon;
and Art is the petrified sandwich. Fix me a very, ve-ry high one,
dearie, because little sunshine is in love again."</p>

<p>"Who drew the lucky number?" asked Annan with a shrug.</p>

<p>"The Countess d'Enver. She's the birdie."</p>

<p>"Intellectually?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she's an intellectual four-flusher, bless her heart! But
she was the only woman there who didn't try to mentally frisk
me. We lunch together soon, Henry."</p>

<p>"Where's Count hubby?"</p>

<p>"Aloft. She's a bird," he repeated, fondly reminiscent over his
high-ball&mdash;"and I myself am the real ornithological thing&mdash;the
species that Brooklyn itself would label 'boid' ... She has such
pretty, confiding ways, Harry."</p>

<p>"You'd both better join the Audubon Society for Mutual Protection,"
observed Annan dryly.</p>

<p>"I'll stand for anything she stands for except that social Tenderloin;
I'll join anything she joins except the 'classes now forming'
in that intellectual dance hall. By the way, who do you suppose
was there?"</p>

<p>"The police?"</p>

<p>"Naw&mdash;the saloon wasn't raided, though 'Professor' Carrillo's
poem was <em>assez raide</em>. Mek-mek-k-k-k! But oh, the ginky
pictures! Oh, the Art Beautiful! Aniline rainbows exploding in
a physical culture school couldn't beat that omelette!... And
guess who was pouring tea in the centre of the olio, Harry!"</p>

<p>"You?" inquired Annan wearily.</p>

<p>"Valerie West."</p>

<p>"What in God's name has that bunch taken her up for?"</p>

<p>For the last few weeks Valerie's telephone had rung intermittently
summoning her to conversation with Mrs. Hind-Willet.</p>

<p>At first the amiable interest displayed by Mrs. Hind-Willet puzzled
Valerie until one day, returning to her rooms for luncheon, she
found the Countess d'Enver's brougham standing in front of the
house and that discreetly perfumed lady about to descend.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Valerie, stopping on the sidewalk and offering
her hand with a frank smile.</p>

<p>"I came to call on you," said the over-dressed little countess;
"may I?"</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you. Will you come upstairs? There is no
elevator."</p>

<p>The pretty bejewelled countess arrived in the living room out
of breath, and seated herself, flushed, speechless, overcome,
her little white gloved hand clutching her breast.</p>

<p>Valerie, accustomed to the climb, was in nowise distressed; and
went serenely about her business while the countess was recovering.</p>

<p>"I am going to prepare luncheon; may I hope you will remain and
share it with me?" she asked.</p>

<p>The countess nodded, slowly recovering her breath and glancing
curiously around the room.</p>

<p>"You see I have only an hour between poses," observed Valerie,
moving swiftly from cupboard to kitchenette, "so luncheon is always
rather simple. Miss Tevis, with whom I live, never lunches here,
so I take what there is left from breakfast."</p>

<p>[Illustration: The Countess d'Enver.]</p>

<p>A little later they were seated at a small table together, sipping
chocolate. There was cold meat, a light salad, and fruit. The
conversation was as haphazard and casual as the luncheon, until
the pretty countess lighted a cigarette and tasted her tiny glass
of Port&mdash;the latter a gift from Querida. "Do you think it odd
of me to call on you uninvited?" she asked, with that smiling
abruptness which sometimes arises from embarrassment.</p>

<p>"I think it is very sweet of you," said Valerie, "I am very happy
to know that you remember me."</p>

<p>The countess flushed up: "Do you really feel that way about it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Valerie, smiling, "or I would not say so."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;you give me courage to tell you that since I first met
you I've been&mdash;quite mad about you."</p>

<p>"About <em>me</em>!" in smiling surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. I wanted to know you. I told Mrs. Hind-Willet to ask you
to the club. She did. But you never came.... And I <em>did</em>
like you so much."</p>

<p>Valerie said in a sweet, surprised way: "Do you know what I am?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you sit for artists."</p>

<p>"I am a professional model," said Valerie. "I don't believe you
understood that, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," said the countess. "You pose for the ensemble,
too."</p>

<p>Valerie looked at her incredulously:</p>

<p>"Do you think you would really care to know me? I, an artist's
model, and you, the Countess d'Enver?"</p>

<p>"I was Nellie Jackson before that." She leaned across the table,
smiling, with heightened colour; "I believe I'd never have to
pretend with you. The minute I saw you I liked you. Will you let
me talk to you?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes."</p>

<p>There was a constrained silence; Hélène d'Enver touched the water
in the bowl with her finger-tips, dried them, looked up at Valerie,
who rose. Under the window there was a tufted seat; and here they
found places together.</p>

<p>"Do you know why I came?" asked Hélène d'Enver. "I was lonely."</p>

<p>"<em>You!</em>"</p>

<p>"My dear, I am a lonely woman; I'm lonely to desperation. I don't
belong in New York and I don't belong in France, and I don't like
Pittsburgh. I'm lonely! I've always been lonely ever since I left
Pittsburgh. There doesn't seem to be any definite place anywhere
for me. And I haven't a real woman friend in the world!"</p>

<p>"How in the world can you say that?" exclaimed Valerie, astonished.</p>

<p>The countess lighted another cigarette and wreathed her pretty
face in smoke.</p>

<p>"You think because I have a title and am presentable that I can
go anywhere?" She smiled. "The society I might care for hasn't
the slightest interest in me. There is in this city a kind of
society recruited largely from the fashionable hotels and from
among those who have no fixed social position in New York&mdash;people
who are never very far outside or inside the edge of things&mdash;but
who never penetrate any farther." She laughed. "This society camps
permanently at the base of the Great Wall of China. But it never
scales it."</p>

<p>"Watch the men on Fifth Avenue," she went on. "Some walk there
as though they do not belong there; some walk as though they do
belong there; some, as though they lived there. I move about as
though I belonged where I am occasionally seen; but I'm tired
of pretending that I live there."</p>

<p>She leaned back among the cushions, dropping one knee over the
other and tossing away her cigarette. And her little suede shoe
swung nervously to and fro.</p>

<p>"You're the first girl I've seen in New York who, I believe,
really doesn't care what I am&mdash;and I don't care what she is. Shall
we be friends? I'm lonely."</p>

<p>Valerie looked at her, diffidently:</p>

<p>"I haven't had very much experience in friendship&mdash;except with
Rita Tevis," she said.</p>

<p>"Will you let me take you to drive sometimes?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to, only you see I am in business."</p>

<p>"Of course I mean after hours."</p>

<p>"Thank you.... But I usually am expected&mdash;to tea&mdash;and dinner&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hélène lay back among the cushions, looking at her.</p>

<p>"Haven't you any time at all for me?" she asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>Valerie was thinking of Neville: "Not&mdash;very&mdash;much I am afraid&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Can't you spare me an hour now and then?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>yes; I'll try."</p>

<p>There was a silence. The mantel clock struck, and Valerie glanced
up. Hélène d'Enver rose, stood still a moment, then stepped forward
and took both of Valerie's hands:</p>

<p>"Can't we be friends? I do need one; and I like you so much.
You've the eyes that make a woman easy. There are none like yours
in New York."</p>

<p>Valerie laughed, uncertainly.</p>

<p>"Your friends wouldn't care for me," she said. "I don't believe
there is any real place at all for me in this city except among
the few men and women I already know."</p>

<p>"Won't you include me among the number? There is a place for
you in my heart."</p>

<p>Touched and surprised, the girl stood looking at the older woman
in silence.</p>

<p>"May I drive you to your destination?" asked Hélène gently.</p>

<p>"You are very kind.... It is Mr. Burleson's studio&mdash;if it won't
take you too far out of your way."</p>

<p>By the end of March Valerie had driven with the Countess d'Enver
once or twice; and once or twice had been to see her, and had
met, in her apartment, men and women who were inclined to make
a fuss over her&mdash;men like Carrillo and Dennison, and women like
Mrs. Hind-Willet and Mrs. Atherstane. It was her unconventional
profession that interested them.</p>

<p>To Neville, recounting her experiences, she said with a patient
little smile:</p>

<p>"It's rather nice to be liked and to have some kind of a place
among people who live in this city. Nobody seems to mind my being
a model. Perhaps they <em>have</em> taken merely a passing fancy
to me and are exhibiting me to each other as a wild thing just
captured and being trained&mdash;" She laughed&mdash;"but they do it so
pleasantly that I don't mind.... And anyway, the Countess d'Enver
is genuine; I am sure of that."</p>

<p>"A genuine countess?"</p>

<p>"A genuine woman, sincere, lovable, and kind &mdash;I am becoming
very fond of her.... Do you mind my abandoning you for an afternoon
now and then? Because it <em>is</em> nice to have as a friend
a woman older and more experienced."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you're going off with her this afternoon?"</p>

<p>"I <em>was</em> going. But I won't if you feel that I'm deserting
you."</p>

<p>He laid aside his palette and went over to where she was standing.</p>

<p>"You darling," he said, "go and drive in the Park with your funny
little friend."</p>

<p>"She was going to take me to the Plaza for tea. There are to
be some very nice women there who are interested in the New Idea
Home." She added, shyly, "I have subscribed ten dollars."</p>

<p>He kissed her, lightly, humorously. "And what, sweetheart, may
the New Idea Home be?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's an idea of Mrs. Hind-Willet's about caring for wayward
girls. Mrs. Willet thinks that it is cruel and silly to send them
into virtual imprisonment, to punish them and watch them and confront
them at every turn with threats and the merciless routine of discipline.
She thinks that the thing to do is to give them a chance for sensible
and normal happiness; not to segregate them one side of a dead
line; not to treat them like criminals to be watched and doubted
and suspected."</p>

<p>She linked her arms around his neck, interested, earnest, sure
of his sympathy and approval:</p>

<p>"We want to build a school in the country&mdash;two schools, one for
girls who have misbehaved, one for youths who are similarly delinquent.
And, during recreation, we mean to let them meet in a natural
manner&mdash;play games together, dance, mingle out of doors in a wholesome
and innocent way&mdash;of course, under necessary and sympathetic supervision&mdash;and
learn a healthy consideration and respect for one another which
the squalid, crowded, irresponsible conditions of their former
street life in the slums and tenements made utterly impossible."</p>

<p>He looked into the pretty, eager face with its honest, beautiful
eyes and sensitive mouth&mdash;and touched his lips to her hair.</p>

<p>"It sounds fine, sweetheart," he said: "and I won't be lonely
if you go to the Plaza and settle the affairs of this topsy-turvy
world.... Do you love me?"</p>

<p>"Louis! Can you ask?"</p>

<p>"I do ask."</p>

<p>She smiled, faintly; then her young face grew serious, and a
hint of passion darkened her eyes as her arms tightened around
his neck and her lips met his.</p>

<p>"All I care for in the world, or out of it, is you, Louis. If
I find pleasure in anything it is because of you; if I take a
little pride in having people like me, it is only for your sake&mdash;for
the sake of the pride you may feel in having others find me agreeable
and desirable. I wish it were possible that your, own world could
find me agreeable and desirable&mdash;for your sake, my darling, more
than for mine. But it never will&mdash;never could. There is a wall
around your world which I can never scale. And it does not make
me unhappy &mdash;I only wish you to know that I want to be what
you would have me&mdash;and if I can't be all that you might wish,
I love and adore you none the less&mdash;am none the less willing to
give you all there is to me&mdash;all there is to a girl named Valerie
West who finds this life a happy one because you have made it
so for her."</p>

<p>She continued to see Hélène d'Enver, poured tea sometimes at
the Five-Minute-Club, listened to the consultations over the New
Idea Home, and met a great many people of all kinds, fashionable
women with a passion for the bizarre and unconventional, women
of gentle breeding and no social pretence, who worked to support
themselves; idle women, ambitious women, restless women; but the
majority formed part of the floating circles domiciled in apartments
and at the great hotels&mdash;people who wintered in New York and were
a part of its social and civic life to that extent, but whose
duties and responsibilities for the metropolitan welfare were
self-imposed, and neither hereditary nor constant.</p>

<p>As all circles in New York have, at certain irregular periods,
accidental points of temporary contact, Valerie now and then met
people whom she was scarcely ever likely to see again. And it
was at a New Idea Home conference, scheduled for five o'clock
in the red parlour of the ladies' waiting room in the great Hotel
Imperator, that Valerie, arriving early as delegated substitute
for Mrs. Hind-Willet, found herself among a small group of beautifully
gowned strangers&mdash;the sort of women whom she had never before
met in this way.</p>

<p>They all knew each other; others who arrived seemed to recognise
with more or less intimacy everybody in the room excepting herself.</p>

<p>She was sitting apart by the crimson-curtained windows, perfectly
self-possessed and rather interested in watching the arrivals
of women whose names, as she caught them, suggested social positions
which were vaguely familiar to her, when an exceedingly pretty
girl detached herself from the increasing group and came across
to where Valerie was sitting alone.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'May I sit here with you until she arrives? I
am Stephanie Swift.'"]</p>

<p>"I was wondering whether you had met any of the new committee,"
she said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I <em>had</em> expected to meet the Countess d'Enver here,"
said Valerie, smiling.</p>

<p>The girl's expression altered slightly, but she nodded amiably;
"May I sit here with you until she arrives? I am Stephanie Swift."</p>

<p>Valerie said: "It is very amiable of you. I am Valerie West."</p>

<p>Stephanie remained perfectly still for a moment; then, conscious
that she was staring, calmly averted her gaze while the slow fire
died out in her cheeks. And in a moment she had decided:</p>

<p>"I have heard so pleasantly about you through Mrs. Collis," she
said with perfect composure. "You remember her, I think."</p>

<p>Valerie, startled, lifted her brown eyes. Then very quietly:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Collis is very kind. I remember her distinctly."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Collis retains the most agreeable memories of meeting you....
<em>I&mdash;" </em>she looked at Valerie, curiously&mdash;"I have heard
from others how charming and clever you are&mdash;from Mr. Ogilvy?&mdash;and
Mr. Annan?"</p>

<p>"They are my friends," said Valerie briefly.</p>

<p>"And Mr. Querida, and Mr. Burleson, and &mdash;Mr. Neville."</p>

<p>"They are my friends," repeated Valerie.... After a second she
added: "They also employ me."</p>

<p>Stephanie looked away: "Your profession must be most interesting,
Miss West."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;exacting."</p>

<p>"Very."</p>

<p>Neither made any further effort. A moment later, however, Hélène
d'Enver came in. She knew some of the women very slightly, none
intimately; and, catching sight of Valerie, she came across the
room with a quick smile of recognition:</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully late, dear&mdash;how do you do, Miss Swift"&mdash;to Stephanie,
who had risen. And to Valerie: "Mr. Ogilvy came; just as I had
my furs on&mdash;and you know how casually a man takes his leave when
you're in a tearing hurry!"</p>

<p>She laughed and took Valerie's gloved hands in her own; and Stephanie,
who had been looking at the latter, came to an abrupt conclusion
that amazed her; and she heard herself saying:</p>

<p>"It has been most interesting to meet you, Miss West. I have
heard of you so pleasantly that I had hoped to meet you some time.
And I hope I shall again."</p>

<p>Valerie thanked her with a self-possession which she did not
entirely feel, and turned away with Hélène d'Enver.</p>

<p>"That's the girl who is supposed to be engaged to Louis Neville,"
whispered the pretty countess.</p>

<p>Valerie halted, astounded.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know it?" asked the other, surprised.</p>

<p>For a moment Valerie remained speechless, then the wild absurdity
of it flashed over her and she laughed her relief.</p>

<p>"No, I didn't know it," she said.</p>

<p>"Hasn't anybody ever told you?"</p>

<p>"No," said Valerie, smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it isn't so, then," said the countess naïvely.
"I know very few people of that set, but I've heard it talked
about&mdash;outside."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it is so," said Valerie demurely. Her little
heart was beating confidently again and she seated herself beside
Hélène d'Enver in the prim circle of delegates intent upon their
chairman, who was calling the meeting to order.</p>

<p>The meeting was interesting and there were few feminine clashes&mdash;merely
a smiling and deadly exchange of amenities between a fashionable
woman who was an ardent advocate of suffrage, and an equally distinguished
lady who was scornfully opposed to it. But the franchise had nothing
at all to do with the discussion concerning the New Idea Home,
which is doubtless why it was mentioned; and the meeting of delegates
proceeded without further debate.</p>

<p>After it was ended Valerie hurried away to keep an appointment
with Neville at Burleson's studio, and found the big sculptor
lying on the sofa, neck swathed in flannel, and an array of medicine
bottles at his elbow.</p>

<p>"Can't go to dinner with you," he said; "Rita won't have it.
There's nothing the matter with me, but she made me lie down here,
and I've promised to stay here until she returns."</p>

<p>"John, you don't look very well," said Valerie, coming over and
seating herself by his side.</p>

<p>"I'm all right, except that I catch cold now and then," he insisted
obstinately.</p>

<p>Valerie looked at the pink patches of colour burning in his cheeks.
There was a transparency to his skin, too, that troubled her.
He was one of those big, blond, blue-eyed fellows whose vivid
colour and fine-grained, delicate skin caused physicians to look
twice.</p>

<p>He had been reading when Valerie entered; now he laid his ponderous
book away, doubled his arms back under his head and looked at
Valerie with the placid, bovine friendliness which warmed her
heart but always left a slight smile in the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>"Why do you always smile at me, Valerie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because you're good, John, and I like you."</p>

<p>"I know you do. You're a fine woman, Valerie.... So is Rita."</p>

<p>"Rita is a darling."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'John, you don't look very well,' said Valerie."]</p>

<p>"She's all right," he nodded. A moment later he added: "She comes
from Massachusetts."</p>

<p>Valerie laughed: "The sacred codfish smiled on your cradle, too,
didn't it, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank God," he said seriously.... "I was born in the old
town of Hitherford."</p>

<p>"How funny!" exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"What is there funny about that?" demanded John.</p>

<p>"Why, Rita was born in Hitherford."</p>

<p>"Hitherford Centre," corrected John. "Her father was a clergyman
there."</p>

<p>"Oh; so you knew it?"</p>

<p>"I knew, of course, that she was from Massachusetts," said John,
"because she speaks English properly. So I asked her where she
was born and she told me.... My grandfather knew hers."</p>

<p>"Isn't it&mdash;curious," mused the girl.</p>

<p>"What's curious?"</p>

<p>"Your meeting this way&mdash;as sculptor and model."</p>

<p>"Rita is a very fine girl," he said. "Would you mind handing
me my pipe? No, don't. I forgot that Rita won't let me. You see
my chest is rather uncomfortable."</p>

<p>He glanced at the clock, leaned over and gulped down some medicine,
then placidly folding his hands, lay back:</p>

<p>"How's Kelly?"</p>

<p>"I haven't seen him to-day, John."</p>

<p>"Well, he ought to be here very soon. He can take you and Rita
to dinner."</p>

<p>"I'm so sorry you can't come."</p>

<p>"So am I."</p>

<p>Valerie laid a cool hand on his face; he seemed slightly feverish.
Rita came in at that moment, smiled at Valerie, and went straight
to Burleson's couch:</p>

<p>"Have you taken your medicine?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>She glanced at the bottles. "Men are so horridly untruthful,"
she remarked to Valerie; "and this great, lumbering six-footer
hasn't the sense of a baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have, too!" roared John, indignantly; and Valerie laughed
but Rita scarcely smiled.</p>

<p>"He's always working in a puddle of wet clay and he's always
having colds and coughing, and there's always more or less fever,"
she said, looking down at the huge young fellow. "I know that
he ought to give up his work and go away for a while&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Burleson indignantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, somewhere&mdash;where there's plenty of&mdash;air. Like Arizona, and
Colorado."</p>

<p>"Do you think there's anything the matter with my lungs?" he
roared.</p>

<p>"No!&mdash;you perfect idiot!" said Rita, seating herself; "and if
you shout that way at me again I'll go to dinner with Kelly and
Valerie and leave you here alone. I will not permit you to be
uncivil, John. Please remember it."</p>

<p>Neville arrived in excellent spirits, greeted everybody, and
stood beside Valerie, carelessly touching the tip of his fingers
to hers where they hung at her side.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with <em>you</em>, John? Rita, isn't he coming?
I've a taxi outside ruining me."</p>

<p>"John has a bad cold and doesn't care to go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" growled John.</p>

<p>"And he doesn't care to risk contracting pneumonia," continued
Rita icily, "and he isn't going, anyway. And if he behaves like
a man instead of an overgrown baby, I have promised to stay and
dine with him here. Otherwise I'll go with you."</p>

<p>"Sure. You'd better stay indoors, John. You ought to buck up
and get rid of that cold. It's been hanging on all winter."</p>

<p>Burleson rumbled and grumbled and shot a mutinous glance at Rita,
who paid it no attention.</p>

<p>"Order us a nice dinner at the Plaza, Kelly&mdash;if you don't mind,"
she said cheerfully, going with them to the door. She added under
her breath: "I wish he'd see a doctor, but the idea enrages him.
I don't see why he has such a cold all the time&mdash;and such flushed
cheeks&mdash;" Her voice quivered and she checked herself abruptly.</p>

<p>"Suppose I ring up Dr. Colbert on my own hook?" whispered Neville.</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. And you can tell John that I did it on my own responsibility."</p>

<p>Neville and Valerie went away together, and Rita returned to
the studio. Burleson was reading again, and scowling; and he scarcely
noticed her. She seated herself by the fire and looked into the
big bare studio beyond where the electric light threw strange
shadows over shrouded shapes of wet clay and blocks of marble
in the rough or partly hewn into rough semblance of human figures.</p>

<p>It was a damp place at best; there were always wet sponges, wet
cloths, pails of water, masses of moist clay about. Her blue eyes
wandered over it with something approaching fear&mdash;almost the fear
of hatred.</p>

<p>"John," she said, "why won't you go to a dry climate for a few
months and get rid of your cold?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean Arizona?"</p>

<p>"Or some similar place: yes."</p>

<p>"Well, how am I to do any work out there? I've got commissions
on hand. Where am I going to find any place to work out in Arizona?"</p>

<p>"Build a shanty."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but there are no models to be had out
there."</p>

<p>"Why don't you do some Indians?"</p>

<p>"Because," said John wrathfully, "I haven't any commissions that
call for Indians. I've two angels, a nymph and a Diana to do;
and I can't do them unless I have a female model, can I?"</p>

<p>After a silence Rita said carelessly:</p>

<p>"I'll go with you if you like."</p>

<p>"You! Out there!"</p>

<p>"I said so."</p>

<p>"To Arizona! You wouldn't stand for it!"</p>

<p>"John Burleson!" she said impatiently, "I've told you once that
I'd go with you if you need a model! Don't you suppose I know
what I am saying?"</p>

<p>He lay placidly staring at her, the heavy book open across his
chest. Presently he coughed and Rita sprang up and removed the
book.</p>

<p>"You'd go with me to Arizona," he repeated, as though to himself&mdash;"just
to pose for me.... That's very kind of you, Rita. It's thoroughly
nice of you. But you couldn't stand it. You'd find it too cruelly
stupid out there alone&mdash;entirely isolated in some funny town.
I couldn't ask it of you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You haven't. I've asked it&mdash;of you."</p>

<p>But he only began to grumble and fret again, thrashing about
restlessly on the lounge; and the tall young girl watched him
out of lowered eyes, silent, serious, the lamplight edging her

<p>The month sped away very swiftly for Valerie. Her companionship
with Rita, her new friendship for Hélène d'Enver, her work, filled
all the little moments not occupied with Neville. It had been
a happy, exciting winter; and now, with the first days of spring,
an excitement and a happiness so strange that it even resembled
fear at moments, possessed her, in the imminence of the great
change.</p>

<p>Often, in these days, she found herself staring at Neville with
a sort of fixed fascination almost bordering on terror;&mdash;there
were moments when alone with him, and even while with him among
his friends and hers, when there seemed to awake in her a fear
so sudden, so inexplicable, that every nerve in her quivered apprehension
until it had passed as it came. What those moments of keenest
fear might signify she had no idea. She loved, and was loved,
and was not afraid.</p>

<p>In early April Neville went to Ashuelyn. Ogilvy was there, also
Stephanie Swift.</p>

<p>His sister Lily had triumphantly produced a second sample of
what she could do to perpetuate the House of Collis, and was much
engrossed with nursery duties; so Stephanie haunted the nursery,
while Ogilvy, Neville, and Gordon Collis played golf over the
April pastures, joining them only when Lily was at liberty.</p>

<p>Why Stephanie avoided Neville she herself scarcely knew; why
she clung so closely to Lily's skirts seemed no easier to explain.
But in her heart there was a restlessness which no ignoring, no
self-discipline could suppress&mdash;an unease which had been there
many days, now&mdash;a hard, tired, ceaseless inquietude that found
some little relief when she was near Lily Collis, but which, when
alone, became a dull ache.</p>

<p>She had grown thin and spiritless within the last few months.
Lily saw it and resented it hotly.</p>

<p>"The child," she said to her husband, "is perfectly wretched
over Louis and his ignominious affair with that West girl. I don't
know whether she means to keep her word to me or not, but she's
with him every day. They're seen together everywhere except where
Louis really belongs."</p>

<p>"It looks to me," said Gordon mildly, "as though he were really
in love with her."</p>

<p>"Gordon! How <em>can</em> you say such a thing in such a sympathetic
tone!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;aren't you sorry for them?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry for Louis&mdash;and perfectly disgusted. I <em>was</em>
sorry for her; an excess of sentimentality. But she hasn't kept
her word to me."</p>

<p>"Did she promise not to gad about with him?"</p>

<p>"That was the spirit of the compact; she agreed not to marry
him."</p>

<p>"Sometimes they&mdash;don't marry," observed Gordon, twirling his
thumbs.</p>

<p>Lily looked up quickly; then flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Gordon?"</p>

<p>"Nothing specific; anything in general."</p>

<p>"You mean to hint that&mdash;that Louis &mdash;Louis Neville could
be&mdash;permit himself to be so common&mdash;so unutterably low&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Better men have taken the half-loaf."</p>

<p>"Gordon!" she exclaimed, scarlet with amazement and indignation.</p>

<p>"Personally," he said, unperturbed, "I haven't much sympathy
with such affairs. If a man can't marry a girl he ought to leave
her alone; that's my idea of the game. But men play it in a variety
of ways. Personally, I'd as soon plug a loaded shot-gun with mud
and then fire it, as block a man who wants to marry."</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em> block it!" said Lily with angry decision; "and
I am glad I did."</p>

<p>"Look out for the explosion then," he said philosophically, and
strolled off to see to the setting out of some young hemlocks,
headed in the year previous.</p>

<p>Lily Collis was deeply disturbed&mdash;more deeply than her pride
and her sophistication cared to admit. She strove to believe that
such a horror as her husband had hinted at so coolly could never
happen to a Neville; she rejected it with anger, with fear, with
a proud and dainty fastidiousness that ought to have calmed and
reassured her. It did not.</p>

<p>Once or twice she reverted to the subject, haughtily; but Gordon
merely shrugged:</p>

<p>"You can't teach a man of twenty-eight when, where, and how to
fall in love," he said. "And it's all the more hopeless when the
girl possesses the qualities which you once told me this girl
possesses."</p>

<p>Lily bit her lip, angry and disconcerted, but utterly unable
to refute him or find anything in her memory of Valerie to criticise
and condemn, except the intimacy with her brother which had continued
and which, she had supposed, would cease on Valerie's promise
to her.</p>

<p>"It's very horrid of her to go about with him under the circumstances&mdash;knowing
she can't marry him if she keeps her word," said Lily.</p>

<p>"Why? Stephanie goes about with him."</p>

<p>"Do you think it is good taste to compare those two people?"</p>

<p>"Why not. From what you told me I gather that Valerie West is
as innocent and upright a woman as Stephanie&mdash;and as proudly capable
of self-sacrifice as any woman who ever loved."</p>

<p>"Gordon," she said, exasperated, "do you actually wish to see
my brother marry a common model?"</p>

<p>"<em>Is</em> she common? I thought you said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you annoy me," said Lily; and began to cry.</p>

<p>Stephanie, coming into the nursery that afternoon, found Lily
watching the sleeping children and knitting a tiny sweater. Mrs.
Collis was pale, but her eyes were still red.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, Stephanie?"</p>

<p>"Helping Gordon set hemlocks."</p>

<p>"Where is Louis?"</p>

<p>The girl did not appear to hear the question.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard him telephoning a few minutes ago," added
Lily. "Look over the banisters, dear, and see if he's still there."</p>

<p>"He is," said Stephanie, not stirring.</p>

<p>"Telephoning all this time? Is he talking to somebody in town?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>Lily suddenly looked up. Stephanie was quietly examining some
recently laundered clothing for the children.</p>

<p>"To whom is Louis talking; do you happen to know?" asked Lily
abruptly.</p>

<p>Stephanie's serious gaze encountered hers.</p>

<p>"Does that concern us, Lily?"</p>

<p>After a while, as Mrs. Collis sat in silence working her ivory
needles, a tear or two fell silently upon the little white wool
garment on her lap.</p>

<p>And presently Stephanie went over and touched her forehead with
gentle lips; but Lily did not look up&mdash;could not&mdash;and her fingers
and ivory needles flew the faster.</p>

<p>"Do you know," said Stephanie in a low voice, "that she is a
modest, well-bred, and very beautiful girl?"</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Lily, staring at her in grief and amazement.
"Of whom are you speaking, Stephanie?"</p>

<p>"Of Valerie West, dear."</p>

<p>"W-what do you know about her?"</p>

<p>"I have met her."</p>

<p>"<em>You</em>!"</p>

<p>"Yes. She came, with that rather common countess, as substitute
delegate for Mrs. Hind-Willet, to a New Idea meeting. I spoke
to her, seeing she was alone and seemed to know nobody; I had
no suspicion of who she was until she told me."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hind-Willet is a busybody!" said Lily, furious. "Let her
fill her own drawing-room with freaks if it pleases her, but she
has no right to send them abroad among self-respecting people
who are too unsuspicious to protect themselves!"</p>

<p>Stephanie said: "Until one has seen and spoken with Valerie West
one can scarcely understand how a man like your brother could
care so much for her&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How do you know Louis cares for her?"</p>

<p>"He told me."</p>

<p>Lily looked into the frank, gray eyes in horror unutterable.
The crash had come. The last feeble hope that her brother might
come to his senses and marry this girl was ended forever.</p>

<p>"How&mdash;could he!" she stammered, outraged. "How could he tell&mdash;tell
<em>you</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because he and I are old and close friends, Lily.... And will
remain so, God willing."</p>

<p>Lily was crying freely now.</p>

<p>"He had no business to tell you. He knows perfectly well what
his father and mother think about it and what I think. He can't
marry her! He shall not. It is too cruel&mdash;too wicked&mdash;too heartless!
And anyway&mdash;she promised me not to marry him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Lily brushed the tears from her eyes, heedless now of how much
Stephanie might learn.</p>

<p>"I wrote her &mdash;I went to see her in behalf of my own family
as I had a perfect right to. She promised me not to marry Louis."</p>

<p>"Does Louis know this?"</p>

<p>"Not unless she's told him.... I don't care whether he does or
not! He has disappointed me&mdash;he has embittered life for me&mdash;and
for his parents. We&mdash;I &mdash;I had every reason to believe that
he and&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something in Stephanie's gray eyes checked her. When breeding
goes to pieces it makes a worse mess of it than does sheer vulgarity.</p>

<p>"If I were Louis I would marry her," said Stephanie very quietly.
"I gave him that advice."</p>

<p>She rose, looking down at Lily where she sat bowed over her wool-work,
her face buried in her hands.</p>

<p>"Think about it; and talk patiently with Louis," she said gently.</p>

<p>Passing the stairs she glanced toward the telephone. Louis was
still talking to somebody in New York.</p>

<p>It was partly fear of what her husband had hinted, partly terror
of what she considered worse still&mdash;a legal marriage&mdash;that drove
Lily Collis to write once more to Valerie West:</p>

<p>"<em>DEAR MISS WEST: </em>It is not that I have any disposition
to doubt your word to me, but, in view of the assurance you have
given me, do you consider it wise to permit my brother's rather
conspicuous attentions to you?</p>

<p>"Permit me, my dear Miss West, as an older woman with wider experience
which years must bring, to suggest that it is due to yourself
to curtail an intimacy which the world&mdash;of course mistakenly in
your case&mdash;views always uncharitably.</p>

<p>"No man&mdash;and I include my brother as severely as I do any man&mdash;has
a right to let the world form any misconception as to his intentions
toward any woman. If he does he is either ignorant or selfish
and ruthless; and it behooves a girl to protect her own reputation.</p>

<p>"I write this in all faith and kindliness for your sake as well
as for his. But a man outlives such things, a woman never. And,
for the sake of your own future I beg you to consider this matter
and I trust that you may not misconstrue the motive which has
given me the courage to write you what has caused me deepest concern.</p>

<p>"Very sincerely yours,</p>

<p>"<em>LILY COLLIS</em>."</p>

<p>To which Valerie replied:</p>

<p>"MY <em>DEAR, MRS. COLLIS: I </em>have to thank you for your
excellent intentions in writing me. But with all deference to
your wider experience I am afraid that I must remain the judge
of my own conduct. Pray, believe that, in proportion to your sincerity,
I am grateful to you; and that I should never dream of being discourteous
to Mr. Neville's sister if I venture to suggest to her that liberty
of conscience is a fundamental scarcely susceptible of argument
or discussion.</p>

<p>"I assume that you would not care to have Mr. Neville know of
this correspondence, and for that reason I am returning to you
your letter so that you may be assured of its ultimate destruction.</p>

<p>"Very truly yours,</p>

<p>"<em>VALERIE WEST</em>."</p>

<p>Which letter and its reply made Valerie deeply unhappy; and she
wrote Neville a little note saying that she had gone to the country
with Hélène d'Enver for a few days' rest.</p>

<p>The countess had taken a house among the hills at Estwich; and
as chance would have it, about eight miles from Ashuelyn and Penrhyn
Cardemon's great establishment, El Naúar.</p>

<p>Later Valerie was surprised and disturbed to learn of the proximity
of Neville's family, fearing that if Mrs. Collis heard of her
in the neighbourhood she might misunderstand.</p>

<p>But there was only scant and rough communication between Ashuelyn
and Estwich; the road was a wretched hill-path passable only by
buck-boards; Westwich was the nearest town to Ashuelyn and El
Naúar and the city of Dartford, the county seat most convenient
to Estwich.</p>

<p>Spring was early; the Estwich hills bloomed in May; and Hélène
d'Enver moved her numerous household from the huge Castilione
Apartment House to Estwich and settled down for a summer of mental
and physical recuperation.</p>

<p>Valerie, writing to Neville the first week in May, said:</p>

<p>"Louis, the country here is divine. I thought the shaggy, unkempt
hills of Delaware County were heavenly&mdash;and they <em>were</em>
when you came and made them so&mdash;but this rich, green, well-ordered
country with its hills and woods and meadows of emerald&mdash;its calm
river, its lovely little brooks, its gardens, hedges, farms, is
to me the most wonderful land I ever looked upon.</p>

<p>"Hélène has a pretty house, white with green blinds and verandas,
and the loveliest lawns you ever saw&mdash;unless the English lawns
are lovelier.</p>

<p>"To my city-wearied eyes the region is celestial in its horizon-wide
quiet. Only the ripple of water in leafy ravines&mdash;only the music
of birds breaks the silence that is so welcome, so blessed.</p>

<p>"To-day Hélène and I picked strawberries for breakfast, then
filled the house with great fragrant peonies, some of which are
the colour of Brides' roses, some of water-lilies.</p>

<p>"I'm quite mad with delight; I love the farm with its ducks and
hens and pigeons; I adore the cattle in the meadow. They are fragrant.
Hélène laughs at me because I follow the cows about, sniffing
luxuriously. They smell like the clover they chew.</p>

<p>"Louis, dear, I have decided to remain a week here, if you don't
mind. I'm a little tired, I think. John Burleson, poor boy, does
not need me. I'm terribly worried about him. Rita writes that
there is no danger of pneumonia, but that Dr. Colbert is making
a careful examination. I hope it is not lung trouble. It would
be too tragic. He is only twenty-seven. Still, they cure such
things now, don't they? Rita is hoping he will go to Arizona,
and has offered to go with him as his model. That means&mdash;if she
does go&mdash;that she'll nurse him and take care of him. She is devoted
to him. What a generous girl she is!</p>

<p>"Dear, if you don't need me, or are not too lonely without seeing
me come fluttering into your studio every evening at tea-time,
I would really like to remain here a few days longer. I have arranged
business so that I can stay if it is agreeable to you. Tell me
exactly how you feel about it and I will do exactly as you wish&mdash;which,
please God &mdash;I shall always do while life lasts.</p>

<p>"Sam came up over Sunday, lugging Harry Annan and a bulldog&mdash;a
present for Hélène. Sam is <em>so</em> sentimental about Hélène!</p>

<p>"And he's so droll about it. But I've seen him that way before;
haven't you? And Hélène, bless her heart, lets him make eyes at
her and just laughs in that happy, wholesome way of hers.</p>

<p>"She's a perfect dear, Louis; so sweet and kind to me, so unaffected,
so genuine, so humorous about herself and her funny title. She
told me that she would gladly shed it if she were not obliged
to shed her legacy with it. I don't blame her. What an awful title&mdash;when
you translate it!</p>

<p>"Sam is temporarily laid up. He attempted to milk a cow and she
kicked him; and he's lying in a hammock and Hélène is reading
to him, while Harry paints her portrait. Oh, dear &mdash;I <em>love</em>
Harry Annan, but he can't paint!</p>

<p>"Dearest&mdash;as I sit here in my room with the chintz curtains blowing
and the sun shining on the vines outside my open windows, I am
thinking of you; and my girl's heart is very full&mdash;very humble
in the wonder of your love for me&mdash;a miracle ever new, ever sweeter,
ever holier.</p>

<p>"I pray that it be given to me to see the best way for your happiness
and your welfare; I pray that I may not be confused by thought
of self.</p>

<p>"Dear, the spring is going very swiftly. I can scarcely believe
that May is already here&mdash;is already passing&mdash;and that the first
of June is so near.</p>

<p>"Will you <em>always</em> love me? Will you always think tenderly
of me&mdash;happily&mdash;! Alas, it is a promise nobody can honestly make.
One can be honest only in wishing it may be so.</p>

<p>"Dearest of men, the great change is near at hand&mdash;nearer than
I can realise. Do you still want me? Is the world impossible without
me? Tell me so, Louis; tell me so now&mdash;and in the years to come&mdash;very
often&mdash;very, very often. I shall need to hear you say it; I understand
now how great my need will be to hear you say it in the years
to come."</p>

<p>Writing to him in a gayer mood a week later:</p>

<p>"It is perfectly dear of you to tell me to remain. I <em>do</em>
miss you; I'm simply wild to see you; but I am getting so strong,
so well, so deliciously active and vigorous again. I <em>was</em>
rather run down in town. But in the magic of this air and sunshine
I have watched the reincarnation of myself. I swim, I row, I am
learning to sit a horse; I play tennis&mdash;<em>and</em> I flirt,
Monsieur&mdash;shamelessly, with Sam and Harry. Do you object&mdash;</p>

<p>"We had such a delightful time&mdash;a week-end party, perfectly informal
and crazy; Mrs. Hind-Willet&mdash;who is such a funny woman, considering
the position she might occupy in society&mdash;and José Querida&mdash;just
six of us, until&mdash;and this I'm afraid you may not like &mdash;Mrs.
Hind-Willet telephoned Penrhyn Cardemon to come over.</p>

<p>"You know, Louis, he <em>seems</em> a gentleman, though it is
perfectly certain that he isn't. I hate and despise him; and have
been barely civil to him. But in a small company one has to endure
such things with outward equanimity; and I am sure that nobody
suspects my contempt for him and that my dislike has not caused
one awkward moment."</p>

<p>She wrote again:</p>

<p>"I beg of you not to suggest to your sister that she call on
me. Try to be reasonable, dear. Mrs. Collis does not desire to
know me. Why should she? Why should you wish to have me meet her?
If you have any vague ideas that my meeting her might in any possible
way alter a situation which must always exist between your family
and myself, you are utterly mistaken, dearest.</p>

<p>"And my acquaintance with Miss Swift is so slight &mdash;I never
saw her but once, and then only for a moment!&mdash;that it would be
only painful and embarrassing to her if you asked her to call
on me. Besides, you are a man and you don't understand such things.
Also, Mrs. Collis and Miss Swift have only the slightest and most
formal acquaintance with Hélène; and it is very plain that they
are as content with that acquaintance as is Hélène. And in addition
to that, you dear stupid boy, your family has carefully ignored
Mr. Cardemon for years, although he is their neighbour; and Mr.
Cardemon is here. And to cap the climax, your father and mother
are at Ashuelyn. <em>Can't</em> you understand?</p>

<p>"Dearest of men, don't put your family and yourself&mdash;and me&mdash;into
such a false position. I know you won't when I have explained
it; I know you trust me; I know you love me dearly.</p>

<p>"We had a straw ride. There's no new straw, of course, so we
had a wagon filled with straw from one of the barns and we drove
to Lake Gentian and Querida was glorious in the moonlight with
his guitar.</p>

<p>"He's so nice to me now&mdash;so like himself. But I <em>hate</em>
Penrhyn Cardemon and I wish he would go; and he's taken a fancy
to me, and for Hélène's sake I don't snub him&mdash;the unmitigated
cad!</p>

<p>"However, it takes all kinds to make even the smallest of house
parties; and I continue to be very happy and to write to you every
day.</p>

<p>"Sam is queer. I'm beginning to wonder whether he is really in
love with Hélène. If he isn't he ought to have his knuckles rapped.
Of course, Hélène will be sensible about it. But, Louis, when
a really nice man behaves as though he were in love with a woman,
no matter how gaily she laughs over it, it is bound to mean <em>something</em>
to her. And men don't seem to understand that."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Hind-Willet departs to-morrow. Sam and Harry go to Ashuelyn;
Mr. Cardemon to his rural palace, I devoutly trust; which will
leave José to Hélène and me; and he's equal to it.</p>

<p>"How long may I stay, dear? I am having a heavenly time&mdash;which
is odd because heaven is in New York just now."</p>

<p>Another letter in answer to one of his was briefer:</p>

<p>"My Darling:</p>

<p>"Certainly you must go to Ashuelyn if your father and mother
wish it. They are old, dear; and it is a heartless thing to thwart
the old.</p>

<p>"Don't think of attempting to come over here to see me. The chances
are that your family would hear of it and it would only pain them.
Any happiness that you and I are ever to have must not be gained
at any expense to them.</p>

<p>"So keep your distance, Monsieur; make your parents and your
sister happy for the few days you are to be there; and on Thursday
I will meet you on the 9.30 train and we will go back to town
together.</p>

<p>"I am going anyway, for two reasons; I have been away from you
entirely too long, and&mdash;the First of June is very, very near.</p>

<p>"I love you with all my heart, Louis.</p>

<p>"Valerie West."</p>
