The Queen threw three of the red and gold embroidered cushions
off the throne on to the marble steps that led up to it.</p>

<p>'Just make yourselves comfortable there,' she said.  'I'm simply
dying to talk to you, and to hear all about your wonderful
country and how you got here, and everything, but I have to do
justice every morning.  Such a bore, isn't it?  Do you do justice
in your own country?'</p>

<p>'No, said Cyril; 'at least of course we try to, but not in this
public sort of way, only in private.' 'Ah, yes,' said the Queen,
'I should much prefer a private audience myself - much easier to
manage.  But public opinion has to be considered.  Doing justice
is very hard work, even when you're brought up to it.'</p>

<p>'We don't do justice, but we have to do scales, Jane and me,'
said Anthea, 'twenty minutes a day.  It's simply horrid.'</p>

<p>'What are scales?' asked the Queen, 'and what is Jane?'</p>

<p>'Jane is my little sister.  One of the guards-at-the-gate's wife
is taking care of her.  And scales are music.'</p>

<p>'I never heard of the instrument,' said the Queen.  'Do you
sing?'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes.  We can sing in parts,' said Anthea.</p>

<p>'That IS magic,' said the Queen.  'How many parts are you each
cut into before you do it?'</p>

<p>'We aren't cut at all,' said Robert hastily.  'We couldn't sing
if we were.  We'll show you afterwards.'</p>

<p>'So you shall, and now sit quiet like dear children and hear me
do justice.  The way I do it has always been admired.  I oughtn't
to say that ought I?  Sounds so conceited.  But I don't mind with
you, dears.  Somehow I feel as though I'd known you quite a long
time already.'</p>

<p>The Queen settled herself on her throne and made a signal to her
attendants.  The children, whispering together among the cushions
on the steps of the throne, decided that she was very beautiful
and very kind, but perhaps just the least bit flighty.</p>

<p>The first person who came to ask for justice was a woman whose
brother had taken the money the father had left for her.  The
brother said it was the uncle who had the money.  There was a
good deal of talk and the children were growing rather bored,
when the Queen suddenly clapped her hands, and said - </p>

<p>'Put both the men in prison till one of them owns up that the
other is innocent.'</p>

<p>'But suppose they both did it?' Cyril could not help
interrupting.</p>

<p>'Then prison's the best place for them,' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'But suppose neither did it.'</p>

<p>'That's impossible,' said the Queen; 'a thing's not done unless
someone does it.  And you mustn't interrupt.'</p>

<p>Then came a woman, in tears, with a torn veil and real ashes on
her head - at least Anthea thought so, but it may have been only
road-dust.  She complained that her husband was in prison.</p>

<p>'What for?' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'They SAID it was for speaking evil of your Majesty,' said the
woman, 'but it wasn't.  Someone had a spite against him.  That
was what it was.'</p>

<p>'How do you know he hadn't spoken evil of me?' said the Queen.</p>

<p>'No one could,' said the woman simply, 'when they'd once seen
your beautiful face.'</p>

<p>'Let the man out,' said the Queen, smiling.  'Next case.'</p>

<p>The next case was that of a boy who had stolen a fox.  'Like the
Spartan boy,' whispered Robert.  But the Queen ruled that nobody
could have any possible reason for owning a fox, and still less
for stealing one.  And she did not believe that there were any
foxes in Babylon; she, at any rate, had never seen one.  So the
boy was released.</p>

<p>The people came to the Queen about all sorts of family quarrels
and neighbourly misunderstandings - from a fight between brothers
over the division of an inheritance, to the dishonest and
unfriendly conduct of a woman who had borrowed a cooking-pot at
the last New Year's festival, and not returned it yet.</p>

<p>And the Queen decided everything, very, very decidedly indeed. 
At last she clapped her hands quite suddenly and with extreme
loudness, and said - </p>

<p>'The audience is over for today.'</p>

<p>Everyone said, 'May the Queen live for ever!' and went out.</p>

<p>And the children were left alone in the justice-hall with the
Queen of Babylon and her ladies.</p>

<p>'There!' said the Queen, with a long sigh of relief.  'THAT'S
over! I couldn't have done another stitch of justice if you'd
offered me the crown of Egypt!  Now come into the garden, and
we'll have a nice, long, cosy talk.'</p>

<p>She led them through long, narrow corridors whose walls they
somehow felt, were very, very thick, into a sort of garden
courtyard.  There were thick shrubs closely planted, and roses
were trained over trellises, and made a pleasant shade - needed,
indeed, for already the sun was as hot as it is in England in
August at the seaside.</p>

<p>Slaves spread cushions on a low, marble terrace, and a big man
with a smooth face served cool drink in cups of gold studded with
beryls.  He drank a little from the Queen's cup before handing it
to her.</p>

<p>'That's rather a nasty trick,' whispered Robert, who had been
carefully taught never to drink out of one of the nice, shiny,
metal cups that are chained to the London drinking fountains
without first rinsing it out thoroughly.</p>

<p>The Queen overheard him.</p>

<p>'Not at all,' said she.  'Ritti-Marduk is a very clean man.  And
one has to have SOME ONE as taster, you know, because of poison.'</p>

<p>The word made the children feel rather creepy; but Ritti-Marduk
had tasted all the cups, so they felt pretty safe.  The drink was
delicious - very cold, and tasting like lemonade and partly like
penny ices.</p>

<p>'Leave us,' said the Queen.  And all the Court ladies, in their
beautiful, many-folded, many-coloured, fringed dresses, filed out
slowly, and the children were left alone with the Queen.</p>

<p>'Now,' she said, 'tell me all about yourselves.'</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>'You, Bobs,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'No - Anthea,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'No - you - Cyril,' said Anthea.  'Don't you remember how pleased
the Queen of India was when you told her all about us?'</p>

<p>Cyril muttered that it was all very well, and so it was.  For
when he had told the tale of the Phoenix and the Carpet to the
Ranee, it had been only the truth - and all the truth that he had
to tell.  But now it was not easy to tell a convincing story
without mentioning the Amulet - which, of course, it wouldn't have
done to mention - and without owning that they were really living
in London, about 2,500 years later than the time they were
talking in.</p>

<p>Cyril took refuge in the tale of the Psammead and its wonderful
power of making wishes come true.  The children had never been
able to tell anyone before, and Cyril was surprised to find that
the spell which kept them silent in London did not work here. 
'Something to do with our being in the Past, I suppose,' he said
to himself.</p>

<p>'This is MOST interesting,' said the Queen.  'We must have this
Psammead for the banquet tonight.  Its performance will be one of
the most popular turns in the whole programme.  Where is it?'</p>

<p>Anthea explained that they did not know; also why it was that
they did not know.</p>

<p>'Oh, THAT'S quite simple,' said the Queen, and everyone breathed
a deep sigh of relief as she said it.</p>

<p>'Ritti-Marduk shall run down to the gates and find out which
guard your sister went home with.'</p>

<p>'Might he' - Anthea's voice was tremulous - 'might he - would it
interfere with his meal-times, or anything like that, if he went
NOW?'</p>

<p>'Of course he shall go now.  He may think himself lucky if he
gets his meals at any time,' said the Queen heartily, and clapped
her hands.</p>

<p>'May I send a letter?' asked Cyril, pulling out a red-backed
penny account-book, and feeling in his pockets for a stump of
pencil that he knew was in one of them.</p>

<p>'By all means.  I'll call my scribe.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I can scribe right enough, thanks,' said Cyril, finding the
pencil and licking its point.  He even had to bite the wood a
little, for it was very blunt.</p>

<p>'Oh, you clever, clever boy!' said the Queen.  'DO let me watch
you do it!'</p>

<p>Cyril wrote on a leaf of the book - it was of rough, woolly paper,
with hairs that stuck out and would have got in his pen if he had
been using one, and ruled for accounts.</p>

<p>'Hide IT most carefully before you come here,' he wrote, 'and
don't mention it - and destroy this letter.  Everything is going
A1.  The Queen is a fair treat.  There's nothing to be afraid
of.'</p>

<p>'What curious characters, and what a strange flat surface!' said
the Queen.  'What have you inscribed?'</p>

<p>'I've 'scribed,' replied Cyril cautiously, 'that you are fair,
and a - and like a - like a festival; and that she need not be
afraid, and that she is to come at once.'</p>

<p>Ritti-Marduk, who had come in and had stood waiting while Cyril
wrote, his Babylonish eyes nearly starting out of his Babylonish
head, now took the letter, with some reluctance.</p>

<p>'O Queen, live for ever!  Is it a charm?' he timidly asked.  'A
strong charm, most great lady?'</p>

<p>'YES,' said Robert, unexpectedly, 'it IS a charm, but it won't
hurt anyone until you've given it to Jane.  And then she'll
destroy it, so that it CAN'T hurt anyone.  It's most awful
strong! - as strong as - Peppermint!' he ended abruptly.</p>

<p>'I know not the god,' said Ritti-Marduk, bending timorously.</p>

<p>'She'll tear it up directly she gets it,' said Robert, 'That'll
end the charm.  You needn't be afraid if you go now.'</p>

<p>Ritti-Marduk went, seeming only partly satisfied; and then the
Queen began to admire the penny account-book and the bit of
pencil in so marked and significant a way that Cyril felt he
could not do less than press them upon her as a gift.  She
ruffled the leaves delightedly.</p>

<p>'What a wonderful substance!' she said.  'And with this style you
make charms?  Make a charm for me!  Do you know,' her voice sank
to a whisper, 'the names of the great ones of your own far
country?'</p>

<p>'Rather!' said Cyril, and hastily wrote the names of Alfred the
Great, Shakespeare, Nelson, Gordon, Lord Beaconsfield, Mr Rudyard
Kipling, and Mr Sherlock Holmes, while the Queen watched him with
'unbaited breath', as Anthea said afterwards.</p>

<p>She took the book and hid it reverently among the bright folds of
her gown.</p>

<p>'You shall teach me later to say the great names,' she said. 
'And the names of their Ministers - perhaps the great Nisroch is
one of them?'</p>

<p>'I don't think so,' said Cyril.  'Mr Campbell Bannerman's Prime
Minister and Mr Burns a Minister, and so is the Archbishop of
Canterbury, I think, but I'm not sure - and Dr Parker was one, I
know, and - '</p>

<p>'No more,' said the Queen, putting her hands to her ears.  'My
head's going round with all those great names.  You shall teach
them to me later - because of course you'll make us a nice long
visit now you have come, won't you?  Now tell me - but no, I am
quite tired out with your being so clever.  Besides, I'm sure
you'd like ME to tell YOU something, wouldn't you?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Anthea.  'I want to know how it is that the King has
gone - '</p>

<p>'Excuse me, but you should say &quot;the King may-he-live-for-ever&quot;,'
said the Queen gently.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' Anthea hastened to say - 'the King
may-he-live-for-ever has gone to fetch home his fourteenth wife? 
I don't think even Bluebeard had as many as that.  And, besides,
he hasn't killed YOU at any rate.'</p>

<p>The Queen looked bewildered.</p>

<p>'She means,' explained Robert, 'that English kings only have one
wife - at least, Henry the Eighth had seven or eight, but not all
at once.'</p>

<p>'In our country,' said the Queen scornfully, 'a king would not
reign a day who had only one wife.  No one would respect him, and
quite right too.'</p>

<p>'Then are all the other thirteen alive?' asked Anthea.</p>

<p>'Of course they are - poor mean-spirited things!  I don't
associate with them, of course, I am the Queen: they're only the
wives.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Anthea, gasping.</p>

<p>'But oh, my dears,' the Queen went on, 'such a to-do as there's
been about this last wife!  You never did!  It really was TOO
funny.  We wanted an Egyptian princess.  The King
may-he-live-for-ever has got a wife from most of the important
nations, and he had set his heart on an Egyptian one to complete
his collection.  Well, of course, to begin with, we sent a
handsome present of gold.  The Egyptian king sent back some
horses - quite a few; he's fearfully stingy! - and he said he liked
the gold very much, but what they were really short of was lapis
lazuli, so of course we sent him some.  But by that time he'd
begun to use the gold to cover the beams of the roof of the
Temple of the Sun-God, and he hadn't nearly enough to finish the
job, so we sent some more.  And so it went on, oh, for years. 
You see each journey takes at least six months.  And at last we
asked the hand of his daughter in marriage.'</p>

<p>'Yes, and then?' said Anthea, who wanted to get to the princess
part of the story.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' said the Queen, 'when he'd got everything out of us
that he could, and only given the meanest presents in return, he
sent to say he would esteem the honour of an alliance very
highly, only unfortunately he hadn't any daughter, but he hoped
one would be born soon, and if so, she should certainly be
reserved for the King of Babylon!'</p>

<p>'What a trick!' said Cyril.</p>

<p>'Yes, wasn't it?  So then we said his sister would do, and then
there were more gifts and more journeys; and now at last the
tiresome, black-haired thing is coming, and the King
may-he-live-for-ever has gone seven days' journey to meet her at
Carchemish.  And he's gone in his best chariot, the one inlaid
with lapis lazuli and gold, with the gold-plated wheels and
onyx-studded hubs - much too great an honour in my opinion. 
She'll be here tonight; there'll be a grand banquet to celebrate
her arrival.  SHE won't be present, of course.  She'll be having
her baths and her anointings, and all that sort of thing.  We
always clean our foreign brides very carefully.  It takes two or
three weeks.  Now it's dinnertime, and you shall eat with me, for
I can see that you are of high rank.' She led them into a dark,
cool hall, with many cushions on the floor.  On these they sat
and low tables were brought - beautiful tables of smooth, blue
stone mounted in gold.  On these, golden trays were placed; but
there were no knives, or forks, or spoons.  The children expected
the Queen to call for them; but no.  She just ate with her
fingers, and as the first dish was a great tray of boiled corn,
and meat and raisins all mixed up together, and melted fat poured
all over the tray, it was found difficult to follow her example
with anything like what we are used to think of as good table
manners.  There were stewed quinces afterwards, and dates in
syrup, and thick yellowy cream.  It was the kind of dinner you
hardly ever get in Fitzroy Street.</p>

<p>After dinner everybody went to sleep, even the children.</p>

<p>The Queen awoke with a start.</p>

<p>'Good gracious!' she cried, 'what a time we've slept!  I must
rush off and dress for the banquet.  I shan't have much more than
time.'</p>

<p>'Hasn't Ritti-Marduk got back with our sister and the Psammead
yet?' Anthea asked.</p>

<p>'I QUITE forgot to ask.  I'm sorry,' said the Queen.  'And of
course they wouldn't announce her unless I told them to, except
during justice hours.  I expect she's waiting outside.  I'll
see.'</p>

<p>Ritti-Marduk came in a moment later.</p>

<p>'I regret,' he said, 'that I have been unable to find your
sister.  The beast she bears with her in a basket has bitten the
child of the guard, and your sister and the beast set out to come
to you.  The police say they have a clue.  No doubt we shall have
news of her in a few weeks.'  He bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>The horror of this threefold loss - Jane, the Psammead, and the
Amulet - gave the children something to talk about while the Queen
was dressing.  I shall not report their conversation; it was very
gloomy.  Everyone repeated himself several times, and the
discussion ended in each of them blaming the other two for having
let Jane go.  You know the sort of talk it was, don't you?  At
last Cyril said - </p>

<p>'After all, she's with the Psammead, so SHE'S all right.  The
Psammead is jolly careful of itself too.  And it isn't as if we
were in any danger.  Let's try to buck up and enjoy the banquet.'</p>

<p>They did enjoy the banquet.  They had a beautiful bath, which was
delicious, were heavily oiled all over, including their hair, and
that was most unpleasant.  Then, they dressed again and were
presented to the King, who was most affable.  The banquet was
long; there were all sorts of nice things to eat, and everybody
seemed to eat and drink a good deal.  Everyone lay on cushions
and couches, ladies on one side and gentlemen on the other; and
after the eating was done each lady went and sat by some
gentleman, who seemed to be her sweetheart or her husband, for
they were very affectionate to each other.  The Court dresses had
gold threads woven in them, very bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>The middle of the room was left clear, and different people came
and did amusing things.  There were conjurers and jugglers and
snake-charmers, which last Anthea did not like at all.</p>

<p>When it got dark torches were lighted.  Cedar splinters dipped in
oil blazed in copper dishes set high on poles.</p>

<p>Then there was a dancer, who hardly danced at all, only just
struck attitudes.  She had hardly any clothes, and was not at all
pretty.  The children were rather bored by her, but everyone else
was delighted, including the King.</p>

<p>'By the beard of Nimrod!' he cried, 'ask what you like girl, and
you shall have it!'</p>

<p>'I want nothing,' said the dancer; 'the honour of having pleased
the King may-he-live-for-ever is reward enough for me.'</p>

<p>And the King was so pleased with this modest and sensible reply
that he gave her the gold collar off his own neck.</p>

<p>'I say!' said Cyril, awed by the magnificence of the gift.</p>

<p>'It's all right,' whispered the Queen, 'it's not his best collar
by any means.  We always keep a stock of cheap jewellery for
these occasions.  And now - you promised to sing us something. 
Would you like my minstrels to accompany you?'</p>

<p>'No, thank you,' said Anthea quickly.  The minstrels had been
playing off and on all the time, and their music reminded Anthea
of the band she and the others had once had on the fifth of
November - with penny horns, a tin whistle, a tea-tray, the tongs,
a policeman's rattle, and a toy drum.  They had enjoyed this band
very much at the time.  But it was quite different when someone
else was making the same kind of music.  Anthea understood now
that Father had not been really heartless and unreasonable when
he had told them to stop that infuriating din.</p>

<p>'What shall we sing?' Cyril was asking.</p>

<p>'Sweet and low?' suggested Anthea.</p>

<p>'Too soft - I vote for &quot;Who will o'er the downs&quot;.  Now then - one,
two, three.</p>

<blockquote><div>'Oh, who will o'er the downs so free,<br />
Oh, who will with me ride,<br />
Oh, who will up and follow me,<br />
To win a blooming bride?<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>Her father he has locked the door,<br />
Her mother keeps the key;<br />
But neither bolt nor bar shall keep<br />
My own true love from me.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Jane, the alto, was missing, and Robert, unlike the mother of the
lady in the song, never could 'keep the key', but the song, even
so, was sufficiently unlike anything any of them had ever heard
to rouse the Babylonian Court to the wildest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>'More, more,' cried the King; 'by my beard, this savage music is
a new thing.  Sing again!'</p>

<p>So they sang:</p>

<blockquote><div>'I saw her bower at twilight gray,<br />
'Twas guarded safe and sure.<br />
I saw her bower at break of day,<br />
'Twas guarded then no more.<br />
</div></blockquote>

<blockquote><div>The varlets they were all asleep,<br />
And there was none to see<br />
The greeting fair that passed there<br />
Between my love and me.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Shouts of applause greeted the ending of the verse, and the King
would not be satisfied till they had sung all their part-songs
(they only knew three) twice over, and ended up with 'Men of
Harlech' in unison.  Then the King stood up in his royal robes
with his high, narrow crown on his head and shouted - </p>

<p>'By the beak of Nisroch, ask what you will, strangers from the
land where the sun never sets!'</p>

<p>'We ought to say it's enough honour, like the dancer did,'
whispered Anthea</p>

<p>'No, let's ask for IT,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'No, no, I'm sure the other's manners,' said Anthea.  But Robert,
who was excited by the music, and the flaring torches, and the
applause and the opportunity, spoke up before the others could
stop him.</p>

<p>'Give us the half of the Amulet that has on it the name UR HEKAU
SETCHEH,' he said, adding as an afterthought, 'O King,
live-for-ever.'</p>

<p>As he spoke the great name those in the pillared hall fell on
their faces, and lay still.  All but the Queen who crouched amid
her cushions with her head in her hands, and the King, who stood
upright, perfectly still, like the statue of a king in stone.  It
was only for a moment though.  Then his great voice thundered
out - </p>

<p>'Guard, seize them!'</p>

<p>Instantly, from nowhere as it seemed, sprang eight soldiers in
bright armour inlaid with gold, and tunics of red and white. 
Very splendid they were, and very alarming.</p>

<p>'Impious and sacrilegious wretches!' shouted the King.  'To the
dungeons with them!  We will find a way, tomorrow, to make them
speak.  For without doubt they can tell us where to find the lost
half of It.'</p>

<p>A wall of scarlet and white and steel and gold closed up round
the children and hurried them away among the many pillars of the
great hall.  As they went they heard the voices of the courtiers
loud in horror.</p>

<p>'You've done it this time,' said Cyril with extreme bitterness.</p>

<p>'Oh, it will come right.  It MUST.  It always does,' said Anthea
desperately.</p>

<p>They could not see where they were going, because the guard
surrounded them so closely, but the ground under their feet,
smooth marble at first, grew rougher like stone, then it was
loose earth and sand, and they felt the night air.  Then there
was more stone, and steps down.</p>

<p>'It's my belief we really ARE going to the deepest dungeon below
the castle moat this time,' said Cyril.</p>

<p>And they were.  At least it was not below a moat, but below the
river Euphrates, which was just as bad if not worse.  In a most
unpleasant place it was.  Dark, very, very damp, and with an odd,
musty smell rather like the shells of oysters.  There was a
torch - that is to say, a copper basket on a high stick with oiled
wood burning in it.  By its light the children saw that the walls
were green, and that trickles of water ran down them and dripped
from the roof.  There were things on the floor that looked like
newts, and in the dark corners creepy, shiny things moved
sluggishly, uneasily, horribly.</p>

<p>Robert's heart sank right into those really reliable boots of
his.  Anthea and Cyril each had a private struggle with that
inside disagreeableness which is part of all of us, and which is
sometimes called the Old Adam - and both were victors.  Neither of
them said to Robert (and both tried hard not even to think it),
'This is YOUR doing.'  Anthea had the additional temptation to
add, 'I told you so.'  And she resisted it successfully.</p>

<p>'Sacrilege, and impious cheek,' said the captain of the guard to
the gaoler.  'To be kept during the King's pleasure.  I expect he
means to get some pleasure out of them tomorrow!  He'll tickle
them up!'</p>

<p>'Poor little kids,' said the gaoler.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said the captain.  'I've got kids of my own too.  But
it doesn't do to let domestic sentiment interfere with one's
public duties.  Good night.'</p>

<p>The soldiers tramped heavily off in their white and red and steel
and gold.  The gaoler, with a bunch of big keys in his hand,
stood looking pityingly at the children.  He shook his head twice
and went out.</p>

<p>'Courage!' said Anthea.  'I know it will be all right.  It's only
a dream REALLY, you know.  It MUST be!  I don't believe about
time being only a something or other of thought.  It IS a dream,
and we're bound to wake up all right and safe.'</p>

<p>'Humph,' said Cyril bitterly.  And Robert suddenly said - </p>

<p>'It's all my doing.  If it really IS all up do please not keep a
down on me about it, and tell Father -  Oh, I forgot.'</p>

<p>What he had forgotten was that his father was 3,000 miles and
5,000 or more years away from him.</p>

<p>'All right, Bobs, old man,' said Cyril; and Anthea got hold of
Robert's hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>Then the gaoler came back with a platter of hard, flat cakes made
of coarse grain, very different from the cream-and-juicy-date
feasts of the palace; also a pitcher of water.</p>

<p>'There,' he said.</p>

<p>'Oh, thank you so very much.  You ARE kind,' said Anthea
feverishly.</p>

<p>'Go to sleep,' said the gaoler, pointing to a heap of straw in a
corner; 'tomorrow comes soon enough.'</p>

<p>'Oh, dear Mr Gaoler,' said Anthea, 'whatever will they do to us
tomorrow?'</p>

<p>'They'll try to make you tell things,' said the gaoler grimly,
'and my advice is if you've nothing to tell, make up something. 
Then perhaps they'll sell you to the Northern nations.  Regular
savages THEY are.  Good night.'</p>

<p>'Good night,' said three trembling voices, which their owners
strove in vain to render firm.  Then he went out, and the three
were left alone in the damp, dim vault.</p>

<p>'I know the light won't last long,' said Cyril, looking at the
flickering brazier.</p>

<p>'Is it any good, do you think, calling on the name when we
haven't got the charm?' suggested Anthea.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't think so.  But we might try.'</p>

<p>So they tried.  But the blank silence of the damp dungeon
remained unchanged.</p>

<p>'What was the name the Queen said?' asked Cyril suddenly. 
'Nisbeth - Nesbit - something?  You know, the slave of the great
names?'</p>

<p>'Wait a sec,' said Robert, 'though I don't know why you want it. 
Nusroch - Nisrock - Nisroch - that's it.'</p>

<p>Then Anthea pulled herself together.  All her muscles tightened,
and the muscles of her mind and soul, if you can call them that,
tightened too.</p>

<p>'UR HEKAU SETCHEH,' she cried in a fervent voice.  'Oh, Nisroch,
servant of the Great Ones, come and help us!'</p>

<p>There was a waiting silence.  Then a cold, blue light awoke in
the corner where the straw was - and in the light they saw coming
towards them a strange and terrible figure.  I won't try to
describe it, because the drawing shows it, exactly as it was, and
exactly as the old Babylonians carved it on their stones, so that
you can see it in our own British Museum at this day.  I will
just say that it had eagle's wings and an eagle's head and the
body of a man.</p>

<p>It came towards them, strong and unspeakably horrible.</p>

<p>'Oh, go away,' cried Anthea; but Cyril cried, 'No; stay!'</p>

<p>The creature hesitated, then bowed low before them on the damp
floor of the dungeon.</p>

<p>'Speak,' it said, in a harsh, grating voice like large rusty keys
being turned in locks.  'The servant of the Great Ones is YOUR
servant.  What is your need that you call on the name of
Nisroch?'</p>

<p>'We want to go home,' said Robert.</p>

<p>'No, no,' cried Anthea; 'we want to be where Jane is.'</p>

<p>Nisroch raised his great arm and pointed at the wall of the
dungeon.  And, as he pointed, the wall disappeared, and instead
of the damp, green, rocky surface, there shone and glowed a room
with rich hangings of red silk embroidered with golden
water-lilies, with cushioned couches and great mirrors of
polished steel; and in it was the Queen, and before her, on a red
pillow, sat the Psammead, its fur hunched up in an irritated,
discontented way.  On a blue-covered couch lay Jane fast asleep.</p>

<p>'Walk forward without fear,' said Nisroch.  'Is there aught else
that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak
that name?'</p>

<p>'No - oh, no,' said Cyril.  'It's all right now.  Thanks ever so.'</p>

<p>'You are a dear,' cried Anthea, not in the least knowing what she
was saying.  'Oh, thank you thank you.  But DO go NOW!'</p>

<p>She caught the hand of the creature, and it was cold and hard in
hers, like a hand of stone.</p>

<p>'Go forward,' said Nisroch.  And they went.</p>

<p>'Oh, my good gracious,' said the Queen as they stood before her. 
'How did you get here?  I KNEW you were magic.  I meant to let
you out the first thing in the morning, if I could slip away - but
thanks be to Dagon, you've managed it for yourselves.  You must
get away.  I'll wake my chief lady and she shall call
Ritti-Marduk, and he'll let you out the back way, and - '</p>

<p>'Don't rouse anybody for goodness' sake,' said Anthea, 'except
Jane, and I'll rouse her.'</p>

<p>She shook Jane with energy, and Jane slowly awoke.</p>

<p>'Ritti-Marduk brought them in hours ago, really,' said the Queen,
'but I wanted to have the Psammead all to myself for a bit. 
You'll excuse the little natural deception? - it's part of the
Babylonish character, don't you know?  But I don't want anything
to happen to you.  Do let me rouse someone.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no,' said Anthea with desperate earnestness.  She
thought she knew enough of what the Babylonians were like when
they were roused.  'We can go by our own magic.  And you will
tell the King it wasn't the gaoler's fault.  It was Nisroch.'</p>

<p>'Nisroch!' echoed the Queen.  'You are indeed magicians.'</p>

<p>Jane sat up, blinking stupidly.</p>

<p>'Hold It up, and say the word,' cried Cyril, catching up the
Psammead, which mechanically bit him, but only very slightly.</p>

<p>'Which is the East?' asked Jane.</p>

<p>'Behind me,' said the Queen.  'Why?'</p>

<p>'Ur Hekau Setcheh,' said Jane sleepily, and held up the charm.</p>

<p>And there they all were in the dining-room at 300, Fitzroy
Street.</p>

<p>'Jane,' cried Cyril with great presence of mind, 'go and get the
plate of sand down for the Psammead.'</p>

<p>Jane went.</p>

<p>'Look here!' he said quickly, as the sound of her boots grew less
loud on the stairs, 'don't let's tell her about the dungeon and
all that.  It'll only frighten her so that she'll never want to
go anywhere else.'</p>

<p>'Righto!' said Cyril; but Anthea felt that she could not have
said a word to save her life.</p>

<p>'Why did you want to come back in such a hurry?' asked Jane,
returning with the plate of sand.  'It was awfully jolly in
Babylon, I think!  I liked it no end.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said Cyril carelessly.  'It was jolly enough, of
course, but I thought we'd been there long enough.  Mother always
says you oughtn't to wear out your welcome!'</p>
