<p>Deerfoot made known his purpose to take his friends across the
Mississippi on the morrow in his canoe, after which he would keep
them company for some distance along the trail, though he would
be forced to leave them long before reaching their destination.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton naturally felt a deep interest in the youthful
warrior, and expected him to give some facts in his wonderful
history, as well as an intimation of what his life was likely
to be in the new country to which he had removed, but much to
the young Kentuckian's disappointment, he carefully avoided all
reference to himself.  His conversation being of such a nature
that it is hardly worth recording in this place.</p>

<p>When the evening was well along, Otto threw more wood on the
flames which crackled and gave out a cheerful glow.  Deerfoot
rose to his feet, and without a word passed out into the gloom. 
The hour for retiring was close at hand, and he preferred to make
a reconnaissance before trusting themselves to slumber.</p>

<p>He returned as noiselessly as he went, remarking as he resumed
his seat that no danger whatever threatened them, and they could
slumber in peace.  While speaking, he drew from a pocket within
the skirt of his bunting-shirt, the little Bible which had been
presented to him months before by Mrs. Preston of Wild Oaks, after
the other volume was destroyed by the bullet that was aimed at
the heart of the youth, by the hostile chieftain.</p>

<p>Adjusting himself in an easy posture on the ground, so that the
ruddy fire-light came over his shoulders and fell upon the page
with its minute letters, the young Shawanoe read for several minutes
to himself.  The others held their peace, impressed with the singular
sight.  Neither could doubt that he clearly comprehended every
word of the sublime volume, and they felt that it was wrong to
break in upon his meditation.</p>

<p>All at once he raised his head and asked, "Would my brothers
wish to hear Deerfoot read?"</p>

<p>"We would, indeed," was the reply of Jack Carleton; "I never
saw an Indian who could read from a, printed book, but I have
been told that you can write an excellent hand."</p>

<p>Deerfoot shook his head disparagingly.</p>

<p>"My brother mistakes, but Deerfoot will try and read the words
which the Great Spirit speaks to all his people, whether they
are pale faces or red men."</p>

<p>And then, in a low musical voice, tremulous with emotion and
impressive beyond description, the Shawanoe read an entire chapter
from the book of Revelations, his favorite portion of the blessed
Book, the others listening spellbound.  Even Otto Relstaub, who
saw and heard little of genuine Christian teachings in his cheerless
home, was touched as never before by the indescribably solemn
story of the apocalyptic vision.</p>

<p>The silence which succeeded lasted several minutes, when Jack
said in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, I wish you would speak some sentences from the Bible
in your own tongue."</p>

<p>"Does my brother wish to learn the Shawanoe language?"</p>

<p>"I have heard Shawanoes, Hurons and Miamis talk, but I can't
understand a word; I have a curiosity to know how it will sound
to hear some parts of the Bible with which I am familiar tittered
in an unknown tongue."</p>

<p>"What part of the book can my brother repeat without reading
the words?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;that is &mdash;I don't know," replied Jack, confused by
the question of Deerfoot, who fixed his eyes inquiringly upon
him; "I mean any sentence."</p>

<p>"Does my brother not read the Bible every day?" asked the Indian,
in a grieved rather than a reproving voice; "he must know the
Lord's Prayer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"O yes, yes," replied Jack, desperately clutching at the single
straw.  "I meant to ask you to repeat that."</p>

<p>In the same low, reverent voice he had used while reading, the
warrior uttered the inspired petition, which shall last through
all time.  When he had finished, he said:</p>

<p>"My brother would like to remember the words as Deerfoot has
spoken them; Deerfoot will print them for him."</p>

<p>And drawing a species of red chalk from the same pocket which
held the Bible, he wrote for several minutes on one of the fly-leaves
of the bock.  When he had finished he glanced over the words,
carefully tore out the leaf and handed it across to Jack.</p>

<p>The latter examined the paper, and saw written in a fine, delicate
hand the following words, which are preserved to this day, and
which, when properly pronounced, constitute the Lord's Prayer
as it has been uttered many a time by the dusky lips of the Shawanoe
warrior, when his fiery nature was subdued by its blessed teachings:</p>

<p>"Coe-thin-a, spim-i-key yea-taw-yan-ee, O wes-sa-yeg yey-sey-tho-yan-ae;
Day-pale-i-tum-any-pay-itch tha-key, yea-issi-tay-hay-yon-ae,
issi-nock-i-key, yoe-ma assis-key-kie pie-sey spin-I-key.  Me-li-na-key
oe noo-ki cos-si-kie ta-wa-it-ihin oe yea-wap-a-ki tuck-whan-a;
puck-i-tum-I-wa-loo kne-won-ot-i-they-way.  Yea-se-puck-I-tum-a-ma-chil-i-tow-e-ta
thick-i na-chaw-ki tussy-neigh-puck-sin-a wa-pun-si-loo wau po
won-ot-i-they ya key-la tay pale-i-tum-any way wis-sa kie was-si-sut-i-we-way
thay-pay-wo-way."</p>

<p>Jack studied the singular words several minutes, and then, with
some hesitation, undertook to pronounce them.  He did only fairly,
even when corrected by Deerfoot, who added the rebuke:</p>

<p>"Let my brother say them over many times in his own language,
for the Great Spirit knows all tongues when he who speaks the
words speaks them with his heart."</p>

<p>The consciousness that these words were uttered by one who belonged
to what is generally regarded its a pagan race, brought a blush
to the face of the sturdy youth that had listened to the same
appeal more than once from the lips of his mother.</p>

<p>Under the assurance of Deerfoot, the boys stretched themselves
on the leaves and branches and soon sunk into a refreshing slumber.
Jack recalled that his last remembrance was of Deerfoot resting
his head on his elbow, while he seemed absorbed in his book. 
He lay as motionless as a figure in bronze, but no matter how
much he might be enchained by the words, he could not be insensible
of what was going on around him.</p>

<p>Both Jack and Otto slept until the light of morning was stealing
through the woods.  Then, when they arose to their feet, they
saw the Shawanoe broiling a couple of whitefish which he had managed
to coax from the Mississippi.  He had almost finished before his
friends suspected what was doing.</p>

<p>After greeting the warrior, the others passed through the woods
to the margin of the mighty river, where they bathed their faces
and hands, took a slight swallow of the somewhat muddy water and
then rejoined Deerfoot, who had their breakfast ready.</p>

<p>"Did my brothers see any signs that frightened them?" asked Deerfoot,
when the three had seated themselves on the ground and were partaking
of their meal.</p>

<p>"I took the best survey I could of the river," replied Jack,
"but saw nothing of friend or foe.  I don't suppose, as a rule,
there are many Indians in this section."</p>

<p>"The Shawanoes often hunt to the river, but do not cross; the
Miamis come down from the north, and Deerfoot sees their footprints
in the Woods."</p>

<p>"What tribes are we likely to meet on the other side of the Mississippi?"
asked the young Kentuckian, who naturally felt much interest in
the land wherein he expected to make his home.</p>

<p>"There are many red men, even to the mountains which stretch
far beyond the rivers and prairies, and raise their heads among
the clouds."</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was surprised at this reference, which, he believed,
was to the Rocky Mountains, of which little more than their simple
existence was known to the rest of the Union at that day.  But
the words which followed astonished him still more:</p>

<p>"Beyond the mountains opens the great sea, wider than that which
the pale faces came across from the Old World; beyond that great
sea lies the land where He died for you and me; all the way to
the shore, of the great water you will find the red men; they
are like the leaves in the woods, and Deerfoot and his friends
will die without ever hearing their names."</p>

<p>"But you have spent some time on the other side the Mississippi,
and must know something of your race there."</p>

<p>"Deerfoot has seen the Osages hunting among the mountains and
in the forest; has seen the Miamis, and, to the northward, may
be met the Sacs and Foxes.  Far toward the ice of the North is
the land of the Assiniboine and the Dacotah."</p>

<p>"I should like to know where you gathered all that information?"
remarked the amazed Jack Carleton; "the country beyond the Mississippi
is greater than that on this side, and one of these days it will
overflow with population, then what a country ours will be!" exclaimed
the young patriot, with kindling eye.  "But you and I, Deerfoot,
can never live to see that time, which is for those that come
after us."</p>

<p>"Yaw," said Otto, seeming to feel it his duty to say something;
"dere is enough land over dere, I 'spose, for that horse to hide
a week before I don't catch him."</p>

<p>Jack intimated that he was likely to find his search extended
beyond that time, while Deerfoot smiled over the simplicity of
the lad, whose information was so small compared with his opportunities.</p>

<p>Conversing in this pleasant manner, the meal was soon finished,
and they made ready to cross the river.</p>

<p>When the three emerged from the woods they were close to the
swiftly flowing current.  Jack and Otto paused, while Deerfoot
walked the few rods necessary to find the canoe that had been
drawn up the bank.</p>

<p>Both the boys could swim the Mississippi if necessary, though,
with their rifles and clothing to take care of, it was anything
but a light task.  Had they been without any boat at command,
they would have divested themselves of their garments and placed
them and their "luggage" on it small float, while they swam behind
and pushed it forward.</p>

<p>When the emigrants moved westward they halted long enough on
the bank to construct a raft, sufficient to carry everything in
the course of several trips back and forth.  Otto made preparation
when he reached the river some days before on horseback, and,
forcing the animal into the current, slipped back, grasped his
tail and allowed himself to be towed across.  He might have done
the same on the preceding day had he been given a few minutes
in which to make preparation, and had he not been unwilling to
leave his friend behind.</p>

<p>"But it will beat all that," remarked Jack Carleton, after they
had discussed the different plans, "to be paddled over in the
canoe of Deerfoot."</p>

<p>"Yaw, but I dinks dot we should go across last, night."</p>

<p>"What would we have gained by that?"</p>

<p>"Then we wouldn't have to go ober agin dis mornings."</p>

<p>"True, but there is no haste called for; if it was not that I
am so anxious to see mother, I would as lief spend a week on the
road."</p>

<p>"Dot wouldn't do for me, for mine fader would be looking for
me wid two big gads to him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Helloa!  Here comes Deerfoot.  What can be the matter?  He is
excited over something."</p>

<p>Such was the fact, indeed, for the sagacious Shawanoe had made
an annoying if not alarming discovery.</p>
