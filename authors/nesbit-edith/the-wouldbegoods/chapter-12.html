The author of these few lines really does hope to goodness that no
one will be such an owl as to think from the number of things we
did when we were in the country, that we were wretched, neglected
little children, whose grown-up relations sparkled in the bright
haunts of pleasure, and whirled in the giddy what's-its-name of
fashion, while we were left to weep forsaken at home.  It was
nothing of the kind, and I wish you to know that my father was with
us a good deal - and Albert's uncle (who is really no uncle of ours,
but only of Albert next door when we lived in Lewisham) gave up a
good many of his valuable hours to us.  And the father of Denny and
Daisy came now and then, and other people, quite as many as we
wished to see.  And we had some very decent times with them; and
enjoyed ourselves very much indeed, thank you.  In some ways the
good times you have with grown-ups are better than the ones you
have by yourselves.  At any rate they are safer.  It is almost
impossible, then, to do anything fatal without being pulled up
short by a grown-up ere yet the deed is done.  And, if you are
careful, anything that goes wrong can be looked on as the
grown-up's fault.  But these secure pleasures are not so
interesting to tell about as the things you do when there is no one
to stop you on the edge of the rash act.</p>

<p>It is curious, too, that many of our most interesting games
happened when grown-ups were far away.  For instance when we were
pilgrims.</p>

<p>It was just after the business of the Benevolent Bar, and it was a
wet day.  It is not easy to amuse yourself indoors on a wet day as
older people seem to think, especially when you are far removed
from your own home, and haven't got all your own books and things. 
The girls were playing Halma - which is a beastly game - Noel was
writing poetry, H. O. was singing 'I don't know what to do' to the
tune of  'Canaan's happy shore'.  It goes like this, and is very
tiresome to listen to - </p>

<blockquote class="hft-blockquotes"><div>'I don't know what to do - oo - oo - oo!<br />
I don't know what to do - oo - oo!<br />
It IS a beastly rainy day<br />
And I don't know what to do.'<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>The rest of us were trying to make him shut up.  We put a carpet
bag over his head, but he went on inside it; and then we sat on
him, but he sang under us; we held him upside down and made him
crawl head first under the sofa, but when, even there, he kept it
up, we saw that nothing short of violence would induce him to
silence, so we let him go.  And then he said we had hurt him, and
we said we were only in fun, and he said if we were he wasn't, and
ill feeling might have grown up even out of a playful brotherly act
like ours had been, only Alice chucked the Halma and said - </p>

<p>'Let dogs delight.  Come on - let's play something.'</p>

<p>Then Dora said, 'Yes, but look here.  Now we're together I do want
to say something.  What about the Wouldbegoods Society?'</p>

<p>Many of us groaned, and one said, 'Hear! hear!' I will not say
which one, but it was not Oswald.</p>

<p>'No, but really,' Dora said, 'I don't want to be preachy - but you
know we DID say we'd try to be good.  And it says in a book I was
reading only yesterday that NOT being naughty is not enough.  You
must BE good.  And we've hardly done anything.  The Golden Deed
book's almost empty.'</p>

<p>'Couldn't we have a book of leaden deeds?' said Noel, coming out of
his poetry, 'then there'd be plenty for Alice to write about if she
wants to, or brass or zinc or aluminium deeds?  We shan't ever fill
the book with golden ones.'</p>

<p>H. O. had rolled himself in the red tablecloth and said Noel was
only advising us to be naughty, and again peace waved in the
balance.  But Alice said, 'Oh, H. O., DON'T - he didn't mean that;
but really and truly, I wish wrong things weren't so interesting. 
You begin to do a noble act, and then it gets so exciting, and
before you know where you are you are doing something wrong as hard
as you can lick.'</p>

<p>'And enjoying it too' Dick said.</p>

<p>'It's very curious,' Denny said, 'but you don't seem to be able to
be certain inside yourself whether what you're doing is right if
you happen to like doing it, but if you don't like doing it you
know quite well.  I only thought of that just now.  I wish Noel
would make a poem about it.'</p>

<p>'I am,' Noel said; 'it began about a crocodile but it
is finishing itself up quite different from what I meant it to at
first.  just wait a minute.'</p>

<p>He wrote very hard while his kind brothers and sisters and his
little friends waited the minute he had said, and then he read:</p>

<p>'The crocodile is very wise,
He lives in the Nile with little eyes,
He eats the hippopotamus too,
And if he could he would eat up you.</p>

<p>'The lovely woods and starry skies
He looks upon with glad surprise!
He sees the riches of the east,
And the tiger and lion, kings of beast.</p>

<p>'So let all be good and beware
Of saying shan't and won't and don't care;
For doing wrong is easier far
Than any of the right things I know about are.</p>

<p>And I couldn't make it king of beasts because of it not rhyming
with east, so I put the s off beasts on to king.  It comes even in
the end.'</p>

<p>We all said it was a very nice piece of poetry.  Noel gets really
ill if you don't like what he writes, and then he said, 'If it's
trying that's wanted, I don't care how hard we TRY to be good, but
we may as well do it some nice way.  Let's be Pilgrim's Progress,
like I wanted to at first.'</p>

<p>And we were all beginning to say we didn't want to, when suddenly
Dora said, 'Oh, look here! I know.  We'll be the Canterbury
Pilgrims.  People used to go pilgrimages to make themselves good.'</p>

<p>'With peas in their shoes,' the Dentist said.  'It's in a piece of
poetry - only the man boiled his peas - which is quite unfair.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes,' said H. O., 'and cocked hats.'</p>

<p>'Not cocked - cockled' - it was Alice who said this.  'And they had
staffs and scrips, and they told each other tales.  We might as
well.'</p>

<p>Oswald and Dora had been reading about the Canterbury Pilgrims in
a book called A Short History of the English People.  It is not at
all short really - three fat volumes - but it has jolly good
pictures.  It was written by a gentleman named Green.  So Oswald
said - </p>

<p>'All right.  I'll be the Knight.'</p>

<p>'I'll be the wife of Bath,' Dora said.  'What will you be, Dicky?'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't care, I'll be Mr Bath if you like.'</p>

<p>'We don't know much about the people,' Alice said.  'How many were
there?'</p>

<p>'Thirty,' Oswald replied, 'but we needn't be all of them.  There's
a Nun-Priest.'</p>

<p>'Is that a man or a woman?'</p>

<p>Oswald said he could not be sure by the picture, but Alice and Noel
could be it between them.  So that was settled.  Then we got the
book and looked at the dresses to see if we could make up dresses
for the parts.  At first we thought we would, because it would be
something to do, and it was a very wet day; but they looked
difficult, especially the Miller's.  Denny wanted to be the Miller,
but in the end he was the Doctor, because it was next door to
Dentist, which is what we call him for short.  Daisy was to be the
Prioress - because she is good, and has 'a soft little red mouth',
and H. O. WOULD be the Manciple (I don't know what that is),
because the picture of him is bigger than most of the others, and
he said Manciple was a nice portmanteau word - half mandarin and
half disciple.</p>

<p>'Let's get the easiest parts of the dresses ready first.'  Alice
said - 'the pilgrims' staffs and hats and the cockles.'</p>

<p>So Oswald and Dicky braved the fury of the elements and went into
the wood beyond the orchard to cut ash-sticks.  We got eight jolly
good long ones.  Then we took them home, and the girls bothered
till we changed our clothes, which were indeed sopping with the
elements we had faced.</p>

<p>Then we peeled the sticks.  They were nice and white at first, but
they soon got dirty when we carried them.  It is a curious thing:
however often you wash your hands they always seem to come off on
anything white.  And we nailed paper rosettes to the tops of them. 
That was the nearest we could get to cockle-shells.</p>

<p>'And we may as well have them there as on our hats,' Alice said. 
'And let's call each other by our right names to-day, just to get
into it.  Don't you think so, Knight?'</p>

<p>'Yea, Nun-Priest,' Oswald was replying, but Noel said she was only
half the Nun-Priest, and again a threat of unpleasantness darkened
the air.  But Alice said - </p>

<p>'Don't be a piggy-wiggy, Noel, dear; you can have it all, I don't
want it.  I'll just be a plain pilgrim, or Henry who killed
Becket.'</p>

<p>So she was called the Plain Pilgrim, and she did not mind.</p>

<p>We thought of cocked hats, but they are warm to wear, and the big
garden hats that make you look like pictures on the covers of
plantation songs did beautifully.  We put cockle-shells on them. 
Sandals we did try, with pieces of oil-cloth cut the shape of soles
and fastened with tape, but the dust gets into your toes so, and we
decided boots were better for such a long walk.  Some of the
pilgrims who were very earnest decided to tie their boots with
white tape crossed outside to pretend sandals.  Denny was one of
these earnest palmers.  As for dresses, there was no time to make
them properly, and at first we thought of nightgowns; but we
decided not to, in case people in Canterbury were not used to that
sort of pilgrim nowadays.  We made up our minds to go as we
were - or as we might happen to be next day.</p>

<p>You will be ready to believe we hoped next day would be fine.  It
was.</p>

<p>Fair was the morn when the pilgrims arose and went down to
breakfast.  Albert's uncle had had brekker early and was hard at
work in his study.  We heard his quill pen squeaking when we
listened at the door.  It is not wrong to listen at doors when
there is only one person inside, because nobody would tell itself
secrets aloud when it was alone.</p>

<p>We got lunch from the housekeeper, Mrs Pettigrew.  She seems almost
to LIKE us all to go out and take our lunch with us.  Though I
should think it must be very dull for her all alone.  I remember,
though, that Eliza, our late general at Lewisham, was just the
same.  We took the dear dogs of course.  Since the Tower of Mystery
happened we are not allowed to go anywhere without the escort of
these faithful friends of man.  We did not take Martha, because
bull-dogs do not like walks.  Remember this if you ever have one of
those valuable animals.</p>

<p>When we were all ready, with our big hats and cockle-shells, and
our staves and our tape sandals, the pilgrims looked very nice.</p>

<p>'Only we haven't any scrips,' Dora said.  'What is a scrip?'</p>

<p>'I think it's something to read.  A roll of parchment or
something.'</p>

<p>So we had old newspapers rolled up, and carried them in our hands. 
We took the Globe and the Westminster Gazette because they are pink
and green.  The Dentist wore his white sandshoes, sandalled with
black tape, and bare legs.  They really looked almost as good as
bare feet.</p>

<p>'We OUGHT to have peas in our shoes,' he said.  But we did not
think so.  We knew what a very little stone in your boot will do,
let alone peas.</p>

<p>Of course we knew the way to go to Canterbury, because the old
Pilgrims' Road runs just above our house.  It is a very pretty
road, narrow, and often shady.  It is nice for walking, but carts
do not like it because it is rough and rutty; so there is grass
growing in patches on it.</p>

<p>I have said that it was a fine day, which means that it was not
raining, but the sun did not shine all the time.</p>

<p>''Tis well, O Knight,' said Alice, 'that the orb of day shines not
in undi - what's-its-name? - splendour.'</p>

<p>'Thou sayest sooth, Plain Pilgrim,' replied Oswald.  ''Tis jolly
warm even as it is.'</p>

<p>'I wish I wasn't two people,' Noel said, 'it seems to make me
hotter.  I think I'll be a Reeve or something.'</p>

<p>But we would not let him, and we explained that if he hadn't been
so beastly particular Alice would have been half of him, and he had
only himself to thank if being all of a Nun-Priest made him hot.</p>

<p>But it WAS warm certainly, and it was some time since we'd gone so
far in boots.  Yet when H. O. complained we did our duty as
pilgrims and made him shut up.  He did as soon as Alice said that
about whining and grizzling being below the dignity of a Manciple.</p>

<p>It was so warm that the Prioress and the wife of Bath gave up
walking with their arms round each other in their usual silly way
(Albert's uncle calls it Laura Matildaing), and the Doctor and Mr
Bath had to take their jackets off and carry them.</p>

<p>I am sure if an artist or a photographer, or any person who liked
pilgrims, had seen us he would have been very pleased.  The paper
cockle-shells were first-rate, but it was awkward having them on
the top of the staffs, because they got in your way when you wanted
the staff to use as a walking-stick.</p>

<p>We stepped out like a man all of us, and kept it up as well as we
could in book-talk, and at first all was merry as a dinner-bell;
but presently Oswald, who was the 'very perfect gentle knight',
could not help noticing that one of us was growing very silent and
rather pale, like people are when they have eaten something that
disagrees with them before they are quite sure of the fell truth.</p>

<p>So he said, 'What's up, Dentist, old man?' quite kindly and like a
perfect knight, though, of course, he was annoyed with Denny.  It
is sickening when people turn pale in the middle of a game and
everything is spoiled, and you have to go home, and tell the
spoiler how sorry you are that he is knocked up, and pretend not to
mind about the game being spoiled.</p>

<p>Denny said, 'Nothing', but Oswald knew better.</p>

<p>Then Alice said, 'Let's rest a bit, Oswald, it IS hot.'</p>

<p>'Sir Oswald, if you please, Plain Pilgrim,' returned her brother
dignifiedly.  'Remember I'm a knight.'</p>

<p>So then we sat down and had lunch, and Denny looked better.  We
played adverbs, and twenty questions, and apprenticing your son,
for a bit in the shade, and then Dicky said it was time to set sail
if we meant to make the port of Canterbury that night.  Of course,
pilgrims reck not of ports, but Dicky never does play the game
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>We went on.  I believe we should have got to Canterbury all right
and quite early, only Denny got paler and paler, and presently
Oswald saw, beyond any doubt, that he was beginning to walk lame.</p>

<p>'Shoes hurt you, Dentist?' he said, still with kind striving
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>'Not much - it's all right,' returned the other.</p>

<p>So on we went - but we were all a bit tired now - and the sun was
hotter and hotter; the clouds had gone away.  We had to begin to
sing to keep up our spirits.  We sang 'The British Grenadiers' and
'John Brown's Body', which is grand to march to, and a lot of
others.  We were just starting on 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys
are marching', when Denny stopped short.  He stood first on one
foot and then on the other, and suddenly screwed up his face and
put his knuckles in his eyes and sat down on a heap of stones by
the roadside.  When we pulled his hands down he was actually
crying.  The author does not wish to say it is babyish to cry.</p>

<p>'Whatever is up?' we all asked, and Daisy and Dora petted him to
get him to say, but he only went on howling, and said it was
nothing, only would we go on and leave him, and call for him as we
came back.</p>

<p>Oswald thought very likely something had given Denny the
stomach-ache, and he did not like to say so before all of us, so he
sent the others away and told them to walk on a bit.</p>

<p>Then he said, 'Now, Denny, don't be a young ass.  What is it?  Is
it stomach-ache?'</p>

<p>And Denny stopped crying to say 'No!' as loud as he could.</p>

<p>'Well, then,' Oswald said, 'look here, you're spoiling the whole
thing.  Don't be a jackape, Denny.  What is it?'</p>

<p>'You won't tell the others if I tell you?'</p>

<p>'Not if you say not,' Oswald answered in kindly tones.</p>

<p>'Well, it's my shoes.'</p>

<p>'Take them off, man.'</p>

<p>'You won't laugh?'</p>

<p>'NO!' cried Oswald, so impatiently that the others looked back to
see why he was shouting.  He waved them away, and with humble
gentleness began to undo the black-tape sandals.  </p>

<p>Denny let him, crying hard all the time.</p>

<p>When Oswald had got off the first shoe the mystery was made plain
to him.</p>

<p>'Well!  Of all the - ' he said in proper indignation.</p>

<p>Denny quailed - though he said he did not - but then he doesn't know
what quailing is, and if Denny did not quail then Oswald does not
know what quailing is either.</p>

<p>For when Oswald took the shoe off he naturally chucked it down and
gave it a kick, and a lot of little pinky yellow things rolled out.
And Oswald look closer at the interesting sight.  And the little
things were SPLIT peas.</p>

<p>'Perhaps you'll tell me,' said the gentle knight, with the
politeness of despair, 'why on earth you've played the goat like
this?'</p>

<p>'Oh, don't be angry,' Denny said; and now his shoes were off, he
curled and uncurled his toes and stopped crying.  'I KNEW pilgrims
put peas in their shoes - and - oh, I wish you wouldn't laugh!'</p>

<p>'I'm not,' said Oswald, still with bitter politeness.</p>

<p>'I didn't want to tell you I was going to, because I wanted to be
better than all of you, and I thought if you knew I was going to
you'd want to too, and you wouldn't when I said it first.  So I
just put some peas in my pocket and dropped one or two at a time
into my shoes when you weren't looking.'</p>

<p>In his secret heart Oswald said, 'Greedy young ass.'  For it IS
greedy to want to have more of anything than other people, even
goodness.</p>

<p>Outwardly Oswald said nothing.</p>

<p>'You see' - Denny went on - 'I do want to be good.  And if pilgriming
is to do you good, you ought to do it properly.  I shouldn't mind
being hurt in my feet if it would make me good for ever and ever. 
And besides, I wanted to play the game thoroughly.  You always say
I don't.'</p>

<p>The breast of the kind Oswald was touched by these last words.</p>

<p>'I think you're quite good enough,' he said.  'I'll fetch back the
others - no, they won't laugh.'</p>

<p>And we all went back to Denny, and the girls made a fuss with him. 
But Oswald and Dicky were grave and stood aloof.  They were old
enough to see that being good was all very well, but after all you
had to get the boy home somehow.</p>

<p>When they said this, as agreeably as they could, Denny said - </p>

<p>'It's all right - someone will give me a lift.'</p>

<p>'You think everything in the world can be put right with a lift,'
Dicky said, and he did not speak lovingly.</p>

<p>'So it can,' said Denny, 'when it's your feet.  I shall easily get
a lift home.'</p>

<p>'Not here you won't,' said Alice.  'No one goes down this road; but
the high road's just round the corner, where you see the telegraph
wires.'</p>

<p>Dickie and Oswald made a sedan chair and carried Denny to the high
road, and we sat down in a ditch to wait.  For a long time nothing
went by but a brewer's dray.  We hailed it, of course, but the man
was so sound asleep that our hails were vain, and none of us
thought soon enough about springing like a flash to the horses'
heads, though we all thought of it directly the dray was out of
sight.</p>

<p>So we had to keep on sitting there by the dusty road, and more than
one pilgrim was heard to say it wished we had never come.  Oswald
was not one of those who uttered this useless wish.</p>

<p>At last, just when despair was beginning to eat into the vital
parts of even Oswald, there was a quick tap-tapping of horses' feet
on the road, and a dogcart came in sight with a lady in it all
alone.</p>

<p>We hailed her like the desperate shipwrecked mariners in the
long-boat hail the passing sail.</p>

<p>She pulled up.  She was not a very old lady - twenty-five we found
out afterwards her age was - and she looked jolly.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'what's the matter?'</p>

<p>'It's this poor little boy,' Dora said, pointing to the Dentist,
who had gone to sleep in the dry ditch, with his mouth open as
usual.  'His feet hurt him so, and will you give him a lift?'</p>

<p>'But why are you all rigged out like this?' asked the lady, looking
at our cockle-shells and sandals and things.  We told her.</p>

<p>'And how has he hurt his feet?' she asked.  And we told her that.</p>

<p>She looked very kind.  'Poor little chap,' she said.  'Where do you
want to go?'</p>

<p>We told her that too.  We had no concealments from this lady.</p>

<p>'Well,' she said, 'I have to go on to - what is its name?'</p>

<p>'Canterbury,' said H. O.</p>

<p>'Well, yes, Canterbury,' she said; 'it's only about half a mile. 
I'll take the poor little pilgrim - and, yes, the three girls.  You
boys must walk.  Then we'll have tea and see the sights, and I'll
drive you home - at least some of you.  How will that do?'</p>

<p>We thanked her very much indeed, and said it would do very nicely.</p>

<p>Then we helped Denny into the cart, and the girls got up, and the
red wheels of the cart spun away through the dust.</p>

<p>'I wish it had been an omnibus the lady was driving,' said H. O.,
'then we could all have had a ride.'</p>

<p>'Don't you be so discontented,' Dicky said.  And Noel said - </p>

<p>'You ought to be jolly thankful you haven't got to carry Denny all
the way home on your back.  You'd have had to if you'd been out
alone with him.'</p>

<p>When we got to Canterbury it was much smaller than we expected, and
the cathedral not much bigger than the Church that is next to the
Moat House.  There seemed to be only one big street, but we
supposed the rest of the city was hidden away somewhere.
There was a large inn, with a green before it, and the red-wheeled
dogcart was standing in the stableyard and the lady, with Denny and
the others, sitting on the benches in the porch, looking out for
us.  The inn was called the 'George and Dragon', and it made me
think of the days when there were coaches and highwaymen and
foot-pads and jolly landlords, and adventures at country inns, like
you read about.</p>

<p>'We've ordered tea,' said the lady.  'Would you like to wash your
hands?'</p>

<p>We saw that she wished us to, so we said yes, we would.  The girls
and Denny were already much cleaner than when we parted from them.</p>

<p>There was a courtyard to the inn and a wooden staircase outside the
house.  We were taken up this, and washed our hands in a big room
with a fourpost wooden bed and dark red hangings - just the sort of
hangings that would not show the stains of gore in the dear old
adventurous times.</p>

<p>Then we had tea in a great big room with wooden chairs and tables,
very polished and old.</p>

<p>It was a very nice tea, with lettuces, and cold meat, and three
kinds of jam, as well as cake, and new bread, which we are not
allowed at home.</p>

<p>While tea was being had, the lady talked to us.  She was very kind.</p>

<p>There are two sorts of people in the world, besides others; one
sort understand what you're driving at, and the other don't.  This
lady was the one sort.</p>

<p>After everyone had had as much to eat as they could possibly want,
the lady said, 'What was it you particularly wanted to see at
Canterbury?'</p>

<p>'The cathedral,' Alice said, 'and the place where Thomas A Becket
was murdered.'</p>

<p>'And the Danejohn,' said Dicky.</p>

<p>Oswald wanted to see the walls, because he likes the Story of St
Alphege and the Danes.</p>

<p>'Well, well,' said the lady, and she put on her hat; it was a
really sensible one - not a blob of fluffy stuff and feathers put on
sideways and stuck on with long pins, and no shade to your face,
but almost as big as ours, with a big brim and red flowers, and
black strings to tie under your chin to keep it from blowing off.</p>

<p>Then we went out all together to see Canterbury.  Dicky and Oswald
took it in turns to carry Denny on their backs.  The lady called
him 'The Wounded Comrade'.</p>

<p>We went first to the church.  Oswald, whose quick brain was easily
aroused to suspicions, was afraid the lady might begin talking in
the church, but she did not.  The church door was open.  I remember
mother telling us once it was right and good for churches to be
left open all day, so that tired people could go in and be quiet,
and say their prayers, if they wanted to.  But it does not seem
respectful to talk out loud in church.  (See Note A.)</p>

<p>When we got outside the lady said, 'You can imagine how on the
chancel steps began the mad struggle in which Becket, after hurling
one of his assailants, armour and all, to the ground - '</p>

<p>'It would have been much cleverer,' H. O. interrupted, 'to hurl him
without his armour, and leave that standing up.'</p>

<p>'Go on,' said Alice and Oswald, when they had given H. O. a
withering glance.  And the lady did go on.  She told us all about
Becket, and then about St Alphege, who had bones thrown at him till
he died, because he wouldn't tax his poor people to please the
beastly rotten Danes.</p>

<p>And Denny recited a piece of poetry he knows called 'The Ballad of
Canterbury'.</p>

<p>It begins about Danish warships snake-shaped, and ends about doing
as you'd be done by.  It is long, but it has all the beef-bones in
it, and all about St Alphege.</p>

<p>Then the lady showed us the Danejohn, and it was like an
oast-house.  And Canterbury walls that Alphege defied the Danes
from looked down on a quite common farmyard.  The hospital was like
a barn, and other things were like other things, but we went all
about and enjoyed it very much.  The lady was quite amusing,
besides sometimes talking like a real cathedral guide I met
afterwards.  (See Note B.) When at last we said we thought
Canterbury was very small considering, the lady said - </p>

<p>'Well, it seemed a pity to come so far and not at least hear
something about Canterbury.'</p>

<p>And then at once we knew the worst, and Alice said - </p>

<p>'What a horrid sell!' But Oswald, with immediate courteousness,
said - </p>

<p>'I don't care.  You did it awfully well.'  And he did not say,
though he owns he thought of it - </p>

<p>'I knew it all the time,' though it was a great temptation. 
Because really it was more than half true.  He had felt from the
first that this was too small for Canterbury.  (See Note C.)</p>

<p>The real name of the place was Hazelbridge, and not Canterbury at
all.  We went to Canterbury another time.  (See Note D.)
We were not angry with the lady for selling us about it being
Canterbury, because she had really kept it up first-rate.  And she
asked us if we minded, very handsomely, and we said we liked it. 
But now we did not care how soon we got home.  The lady saw this,
and said - </p>

<p>'Come, our chariots are ready, and our horses caparisoned.'</p>

<p>That is a first-rate word out of a book.  It cheered Oswald up, and
he liked her for using it, though he wondered why she said
chariots.  When we got back to the inn I saw her dogcart was there,
and a grocer's cart too, with B. Munn, grocer, Hazelbridge, on it. 
She took the girls in her cart, and the boys went with the grocer. 
His horse was a very good one to go, only you had to hit it with
the wrong end of the whip.  But the cart was very bumpety.</p>

<p>The evening dews were falling - at least, I suppose so, but you do
not feel dew in a grocer's cart - when we reached home.  We all
thanked the lady very much, and said we hoped we should see her
again some day.  She said she hoped so.</p>

<p>The grocer drove off, and when we had all shaken hands with the
lady and kissed her, according as we were boys or girls, or little
boys, she touched up her horse and drove away.</p>

<p>She turned at the corner to wave to us, and just as we had done
waving, and were turning into the house, Albert's uncle came into
our midst like a whirling wind.  He was in flannels, and his shirt
had no stud in at the neck, and his hair was all rumpled up and his
hands were inky, and we knew he had left off in the middle of a
chapter by the wildness of his eye.</p>

<p>'Who was that lady?' he said.  'Where did you meet her?'</p>

<p>Mindful, as ever, of what he was told, Oswald began to tell the
story from the beginning.</p>

<p>'The other day, protector of the poor,' he began; 'Dora and I were
reading about the Canterbury pilgrims ...'</p>

<p>Oswald thought Albert's uncle would be pleased to find his
instructions about beginning at the beginning had borne fruit, but
instead he interrupted.</p>

<p>'Stow it, you young duffer!  Where did you meet her?'</p>

<p>Oswald answered briefly, in wounded accents, 'Hazelbridge.'</p>

<p>Then Albert's uncle rushed upstairs three at a time, and as he went
he called out to Oswald - </p>

<p>'Get out my bike, old man, and blow up the back tyre.'</p>

<p>I am sure Oswald was as quick as anyone could have been, but long
ere the tyre was thoroughly blowed Albert's uncle appeared, with a
collar-stud and tie and blazer, and his hair tidy, and wrenching
the unoffending machine from Oswald's surprised fingers.</p>

<p>Albert's uncle finished pumping up the tyre, and then flinging
himself into the saddle he set off, scorching down the road at a
pace not surpassed by any highwayman, however black and
high-mettled his steed.  We were left looking at each other.
'He must have recognized her,' Dicky said.</p>

<p>'Perhaps,' Noel said, 'she is the old nurse who alone knows the
dark secret of his highborn birth.'</p>

<p>'Not old enough, by chalks,' Oswald said.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't wonder,' said Alice, 'if she holds the secret of the
will that will make him rolling in long-lost wealth.'</p>

<p>'I wonder if he'll catch her,' Noel said.  'I'm quite certain all
his future depends on it.  Perhaps she's his long-lost sister, and
the estate was left to them equally, only she couldn't be found, so
it couldn't be shared up.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps he's only in love with her,' Dora said, 'parted by cruel
Fate at an early age, he has ranged the wide world ever since
trying to find her.'</p>

<p>'I hope to goodness he hasn't - anyway, he's not ranged since we
knew him - never further than Hastings,' Oswald said.  'We don't
want any of that rot.'</p>

<p>'What rot?' Daisy asked.  And Oswald said - </p>

<p>'Getting married, and all that sort of rubbish.'</p>

<p>And Daisy and Dora were the only ones that didn't agree with him. 
Even Alice owned that being bridesmaids must be fairly good fun. 
It's no good.  You may treat girls as well as you like, and give
them every comfort and luxury, and play fair just as if they were
boys, but there is something unmanly about the best of girls.  They
go silly, like milk goes sour, without any warning.</p>

<p>When Albert's uncle returned he was very hot, with a beaded brow,
but pale as the Dentist when the peas were at their worst.</p>

<p>'Did you catch her?' H. O. asked.</p>

<p>Albert's uncle's brow looked black as the cloud that thunder will
presently break from.  'No,'he said.</p>

<p>'Is she your long-lost nurse?' H. O. went on, before we could stop
him.</p>

<p>'Long-lost grandmother!  I knew the lady long ago in India,' said
Albert's uncle, as he left the room, slamming the door in a way we
should be forbidden to.</p>

<p>And that was the end of the Canterbury Pilgrimage.</p>

<p>As for the lady, we did not then know whether she was his long-lost
grandmother that he had known in India or not, though we thought
she seemed youngish for the part.  We found out afterwards whether
she was or not, but that comes in another part.  His manner was not
the one that makes you go on asking questions.  The Canterbury
Pilgriming did not exactly make us good, but then, as Dora said, we
had not done anything wrong that day.  So we were twenty-four hours
to the good.</p>

<p>     Note A. - Afterwards we went and saw real Canterbury.  It is
very large.  A disagreeable man showed us round the cathedral, and
jawed all the time quite loud as if it wasn't a church.  I remember
one thing he said.  It was this:</p>

<p>'This is the Dean's Chapel; it was the Lady Chapel in the wicked
days when people used to worship the Virgin Mary.'</p>

<p>And H. O. said, 'I suppose they worship the Dean now?'</p>

<p>Some strange people who were there laughed out loud.  I think this
is worse in church than not taking your cap off when you come in,
as H. O. forgot to do, because the cathedral was so big he didn't
think it was a church.</p>
