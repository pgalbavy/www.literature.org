<p>Fred Godfrey did not stop to reload his pistol. He had another
ready for use, and he unshipped his rifle in a twinkling, and
hurried for the point where he hoped to gain some tidings of his
loved ones. Everything was in a swirl, and of his own knowledge
he could not tell the proper course to take.</p>

<p>He ran through the wood toward the point for which he was making
at the moment the Seneca Indian shot his horse, but, short as
was the distance, all sounds of conflict were over by the time
he reached his destination.</p>

<p>Among the parties dashing hither and thither, in the blind effort
to escape the Tories and Indians, who seemed to be everywhere,
Fred recognized several friends and neighbors. Indeed, since Wyoming
was his native place, it may be said that nearly all the fugitives
were known to him.</p>

<p>"Why ain't you with your folks?" suddenly asked a middle-aged
farmer, who stopped for a moment in his panting flight to exchange
a few words and to gain breath.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me where they are?" asked Fred in turn.</p>

<p>"They're well on their way across the Susquehanna by this time,
if they haven't reached the other shore."</p>

<p>"How do you know that?" asked Fred, his heart bounding with hope
at the news which he was afraid could not be true.</p>

<p>"I saw them go down to the river bank before the fighting begun:
Gravity told me that just as soon as he saw how things were going
he meant to run to where they were waiting and take them over
in his scow."</p>

<p>"How do you know that he has done so?"</p>

<p>"I don't know it of a certainty, but I saw Gravity making for
the river bank a while ago, and I've no doubt he did what he set
out to do."</p>

<p>This news was not quite so good as Fred supposed from the first
remark of his friend, but it was encouraging. Before he could
ask anything more, the other made a break and was gone.</p>

<p>"Oh, if they only <em>did</em> get across the river," muttered
Fred, making haste thither; "it is their only hope."</p>

<p>And now it is time that you were told something about those in
whom the young patriot felt such painful interest.</p>

<p>They were Maggie Brainerd, whose father, a leading settler from
Connecticut, had gone out with the company to fight the invaders
of Wyoming; Eva, her eight-year-old sister, and Aunt Peggy Carey,
the sister of the dead parent, and who had been the best of mothers
to the children for the last three years. Maggie and Eva were
the half-sisters of Fred Godfrey, between whom existed the sweetest
affection.</p>

<p>Maggie was a year younger than Fred, and Aunt Peggy was a peppery
lady in middle life, who detested Tories as much as she did the
father of all evil himself. When Mr. Brainerd bade each an affectionate
good-bye and hurried away with the others to take part in the
disastrous fight, they huddled close to the river bank, hoping
he would soon return to them with the news that the invaders had
been routed and driven away.</p>

<p>Side by side with the patriotic father marched the servant of
the family &mdash;Gravity Gimp, an enormous African, powerful,
good-natured, and so devoted to every member of his household
that he gladly risked his life for them.</p>

<p>Gravity went into the battle with his gun on his shoulder and
with the resolve to do his part like a man. He loaded and fired
many times, but at the first sign of panic he broke and made for
the river side, determined to save the women folks there, or die
in the attempt. He lost sight of his master, whom he left loading
and firing with the coolness of a veteran. It did not occur to
Gravity that he might do good service by giving some attention
to the head of the family, who had not half the strength and endurance
of himself.</p>

<p>Aunt Peggy, Maggie, and Eva waited on the river bank, with throbbing
hearts, the issue of the battle. When it became certain that the
patriots had suffered a check, they hoped that it was only for
a brief time, and that they would speedily regain the lost ground.</p>

<p>While they waited, the smoke from blazing Fort Wintermoot was
wafted down the valley, and became perceptible to the taste as
well as to the sight. The fugitives were seen to be taking to
the river, fields, and woods, and the painted Iroquois were rushing
hither and thither, gathering in their fearful harvest of death.</p>

<p>"Aunt," said Maggie, taking the hand of Eva, "it won't do to
wait another minute."</p>

<p>"But what will become of your father and Gravity?"</p>

<p>"They are in the hands of God," was the reverential reply of
the courageous girl, who had asked herself the same question.</p>

<p>When her loved parent had kissed her good-bye he made her promise
that on the very moment she became assured of the defeat of the
patriots she would lose no time in getting as far away as possible.
She would have felt justified in breaking that pledge could she
have believed there was any hope of helping her father, but she
knew there was none.</p>

<p>Eva was in sore distress, for now that she understood, in her
vague way, the whole peril, her heart went out to the absent ones.</p>

<p>"Where's papa and Gravity?" she asked, holding back, with the
tears running down her cheeks.</p>

<p>"They are doing their best to keep the bad Indians away," replied
Maggie, restraining by a great effort her own feelings.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go till papa comes," pleaded the broken-hearted
little one.</p>

<p>"But he wants us to go; he told me so, Eva."</p>

<p>"Did he? Then I'll go with you, but I feel dreadful bad."</p>

<p>And she ran forward, now that she knew she was doing what her
father wished her to do.</p>
