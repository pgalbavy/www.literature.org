<p>It was at this juncture that Jared Long, peering out from the
shadow of the wood, observed a larger log than any he had yet
noticed, sweeping by within a short distance of shore.</p>

<p>It was without any branches, except a few near the top, but there
seemed to be a number of big knots projecting from the upper side. 
He counted seven and they were all of the same size.  Furthermore,
unless he was mistaken, the huge tree, from some cause, was working
closer to land.</p>

<p><em>Suddenly one of the knots moved</em>!</p>

<p>The sentinel uttered an exclamation, for the startling truth
flashed upon him with the quickness of lightning.</p>

<p>Each apparent knot was the head of a native!</p>

<p>With amazing coolness, the New Englander brought his Winchester
to a level, and <em>bang, bang, bang</em>, he shattered three
of the knots in quick succession.</p>

<p>He would not have stopped the frightful work even then, had not
the other targets disappeared.</p>

<p>Awaking to their danger, the warriors, dropped down so low in
the water that the log intervened between them and the deadly
marksman.</p>

<p>Still the tree with its terrible load was approaching land. 
The natives were swimming toward shore and pushing it in front
of them.</p>

<p>Long stepped back and roused the professor, placing his mouth
so close to his ear that he was able to apprise him of what was
going on, without being heard by their enemies.</p>

<p>Grimcke bounded to his feet, rifle in hand.</p>

<p>"We'll take them as they come out!" he replied, instantly grasping
the situation.</p>

<p>The log was drifting lower down at the same time that it neared
the land.  Determined to confront the savages the instant they
came forth, the explorers hurried along the edge of the wood,
so as to be on the spot when the landing should be made.  It was
well they did so, for a more astounding discovery than the first,
instantly followed the movement.</p>

<p>More than one of the trees that had floated by carried its human
freight, and nearly a score of savages were crouching in the edge
of the river, so flat on their faces that not one was visible
from the spot where the sentinel was standing a moment before.</p>

<p>The natives, with a cunning that was never suspected, had crossed
the Xingu above the rapids, where, as they knew, such a proceeding
would not be anticipated by the explorers.  Then, stealthily making
their way to the bottom of the rapids, they first launched a number
of trees and logs until, as may be said, the white man on guard
should become so accustomed to them that they would cause no distrust.</p>

<p>If he should be tempted to scrutinize the first, he would learn
that nothing was amiss and would let the rest go by unquestioned.</p>

<p>As a result, the natives had floated past the canoe and under
the very nose of the sentinel without his detecting it.</p>

<p>The savage who swung the torch on the other side of the river
probably meant it as a command for the daring raiders to make
no further delay in their attack.</p>

<p>The group lying against the shore must have been puzzled by the
sudden bombardment from the edge of the wood.  They were so disconcerted,
that instead of springing to their feet and charging upon the
two defenders of the camp, half of them turned about, and diving
deep into the stream, began furiously swimming for the other shore.</p>

<p>They must have concluded that there was a hitch somewhere in
the programme, and the time for disappearing had arrived.</p>

<p>The other half, however, leaped to their feet, and, brandishing
their spears and yelling at the top of their voices, ran swiftly
in the direction of the whites, who were still firing their Winchesters.</p>

<p>"Get behind a tree!" shouted the professor, who had a wholesome
dread of the poisoned weapons, and who lost no time in availing
himself of the nearest shelter.</p>

<p>But he did not cease to use his rifle.  The cartridges in his
magazine were running low, and it was necessary to exercise care
in aiming, for a few precious seconds must be consumed in extracting
an additional supply from the belt at his waist.</p>

<p>But Jared Long declined to follow the sensible advice and example
of his friend.  Scorning to seek shelter, even from such terrible
weapons, he blazed away, making nearly every shot tell.</p>

<p>It was not until he saw a knot of savages working round with
a view of getting behind him, that he fell back a few paces, though
still exposed.  The wonder was that he had not already been pierced
by more than one of the fatal missiles.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was jerked almost off his feet.  The impatient professor
had seized his arm and yanked him behind the tree at his side
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>The New Englander would have been a zany to expose himself again,
after being provided in this summary fashion with a shield.</p>

<p>But he, too, had about emptied the magazine of his Winchester.
Although he could have brought out more cartridges from his belt
in a twinkling, he coolly leaned his rifle against the tree and
whipped out his revolver.</p>

<p>"After that is emptied," he reflected, "my knife is left."</p>

<p>The action of the natives suggested that it was their wish to
take both the men prisoners instead of killing them.  They had
done too much to be let off with such an easy death: they were
wanted for torture.</p>

<p>But, in making such a contract, it may be said that the assailants
found it exceedingly difficult to deliver the goods.</p>

<p>They might as well have tried to seize and hold a couple of diminutive
volcanoes, as to lay hands on the men whose supply of fire and
death seemed without limit.</p>

<p>In the midst of the frightful struggle, with the shrieking figures
falling, dashing forward and retreating, as if in wild bewilderment,
Quincal rushed out of the wood with a shout brandishing his spear
and making straight for the ferocious savages.</p>

<p>With a daring and strength that surprised the latter no more
than it did his white friends, he drove the head of the weapon
sheer through one of the assailants, who went over backward with
a screech that drowned all other noises.</p>

<p>Quincal still grasped his weapon with both hands, and with amazing
power, extricated it, as his victim fell, and turned upon the
others.</p>

<p>But, by this time, he was surrounded and his fate was sealed.</p>

<p>Anxious to save the brave fellow, the professor and Long emptied
their revolvers among his enemies, but were unable to scatter
them until the fellow sank to the ground, pierced deep and fatally
in a dozen places by the poisoned javelins.</p>

<p>Instinctively, the two white men filled their magazines from
their belts, as quickly as they could, and by the time Quincal
was no more, they opened again on the savages.</p>

<p>The latter had already lost fearfully, and this renewed assault
was more than they could stand.  If, instead of trying to make
the white men prisoners, they had contented themselves with hurling
their spears, when they first sprang from the ground, nothing
could have saved Grimcke and Long.</p>

<p>Now, when they launched the missiles, it was too late.  The white
men were each protected by the trunk of a large tree, and standing
back in the shadow, their faces could not be seen.  The only way
of locating them was by the flash of their guns.</p>

<p>They sent a shower of the javelins into the wood, and then were
seized with that strange, aimless panic which sometimes comes
over the bravest men in the crisis of a conflict.  The survivors
made a wild break for the river, into which they sprang as far
as they could leap, diving deep, swimming as far as possible beneath
the surface, then coming up an instant for breath and diving again.</p>

<p>The blood of the Professor and the American was at fever heat. 
They felt it wrong to show mercy, after what had taken place,
and were in no mood for any further weakness of that nature.</p>

<p>Both ran down to the edge of the stream, and, standing almost
in the water, took deliberate aim at every black head as it rose
to the surface.  They kept popping up here and there, at varying
distances, only to drop out of sight again, the instant the swimmer
caught breath; but in many instances, when they went down the
second or third time, they did not come up again.</p>

<p>Professor Grimcke and Jared Long were throwing away no ammunition.</p>

<p>Finally, the dark forms began rising from the river on the other
shore, where they darted into the wood, fearful of the dreadful
messengers which followed them even there.</p>

<p>The repulse was decisive and there was little fear of the attack
on the camp being renewed that night.</p>

<p>The shocking evidences of the disastrous repulse were on every
hand, with the body of poor Quincal lying at the feet of the assailant
whom he had slain, and with nearly a score of dusky bodies stretched
in every conceivable attitude.</p>
