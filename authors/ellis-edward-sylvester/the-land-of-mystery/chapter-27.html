<p>The situation in which the visitors to the dominions of King
Haffgo were placed, was such as to sharpen their wits to the keenest
edge.</p>

<p>After the departure of Fred Ashman, Ziffak talked more plainly
with the Professor and New Englander.  The head chieftain told
his white friends what they had suspected; Haffgo was enraged
at Ashman's presumption with his daughter.  He was in that mood
indeed, in which, but for his promise, he would have hurled his
javelin at the youth before he left the audience chamber.</p>

<p>Ziffak, however, was hopeful that the anger of his royal brother
would cool sufficiently to allow the visitors to remain there
two days; but he doubted whether, after all, they would want to
stay that long under the strained condition of things.</p>

<p>When the chieftain took his departure, it was without any hint
that he wished to have an eye to the young gentleman, but Grimcke
and Long suspected it, and their conversation became of the gravest
character, for they fully realized their peril.</p>

<p>They regretted the mad infatuation of their young friend with
Ariel the princess, and yet they did not blame him, for, as the
New Englander remarked, could they have believed there was any
hope for them, they would have fallen as irrestrainably in love
as he.</p>

<p>But they did not, and, therefore, were in a frame of mind to
consider the situation more coolly than the hot-headed lover.</p>

<p>Both agreed that the stroll taken by Ashman was likely to bring
about trouble, but they were powerless to do anything.  Ziffak
was the only individual who could manage matters in such an emergency.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that night had fully come at the time of
the chieftain's departure.  The interior of the room would have
been wrapped in gloom, had not the mother of Ziffak made her appearance
and started a fire on the hearth at the further end of the apartment.</p>

<p>The white men watched her closely to see how the Murhapas were
accustomed to secure ignition.  But they were disappointed.  She
raked aside the ashes until some embers were disclosed beneath,
which were readily fanned into a flame.  This caused the apartment
to shine with a light like that at mid-day.</p>

<p>She had brought in an earthen vessel of water and began broiling
several thin slices of meat on the coals.  They were quickly finished,
and she then handed to each of her guests the prepared meat on
an earthen plate.  All ate heartily, using their fingers for knives
and forks, while the cool water could not have been more refreshing.</p>

<p>Bippo and Pedros had been sleeping and resting so long that they
desired to get out doors.  Since they were not likely to be recognized
in the night, if they used caution, Grimcke and Long told them
to go, but to take care they did not lose themselves.</p>

<p>They had hardly departed when their hostess also left, passing
out by the rear way.  She did not speak, but as she was disappearing,
gave the two men such a strange look that their suspicions were
awakened.  Both at that moment were reflecting upon the ominous
news brought them by Ziffak.</p>

<p>By a common impulse, both hastened to the rear to learn all they
could about the building in which they might be compelled to fight
for their lives.</p>

<p>The result was rather pleasing.  The structure was heavier and
more compact than the ordinary buildings, and, in addition to
the usual opening in front, had one at the rear, through which
the woman undoubtedly passed on her way to her royal son.</p>

<p>Neither of these openings were provided with anything in the
nature of a door that could be closed.  Whenever the rare occasions
arose for such a sealing of the inhabitants of a house, it was
done by means of furs suspended in front of the entrance.</p>

<p>The white men noted this with quick eyes, and then went back
to the front apartment.</p>

<p>"In the event of attack," said the Professor with the utmost
coolness, "you can take the rear door and I the front."</p>

<p>Long nodded his head; he understood and was ready.</p>

<p>They had hardly entered the front apartment, when both were struck
by the unusual chatter of voices on the outside.  There must have
been a large gathering of people who were growing excited about
something.</p>

<p>The Professor was about to step into the opening to learn what
it meant, when Bippo burst into the apartment, the picture of
fright and terror.</p>

<p>"Going to kill us!" was his alarming exclamation; "make me run&mdash;almost
kill me!"</p>

<p>"Where's Pedros?" asked Long.</p>

<p>"He scared&mdash;run into woods&mdash;won't come back&mdash;run all way to Am'zon!"</p>

<p>"I think he'll have to stop once or twice to get breath before
he reaches there," was the characteristic comment of the Professor,
who standing near the door, listened more closely to the threatening
words and exclamations on the outside.</p>

<p>It sounded singular to recognize more than one expression uttered
in English by these people, who, until a few years before were
unaware that such people were living.</p>

<p>But for the proof Ziffak had given of his loyalty the whites
might have connected his absence with the ugly signs outside;
but the confidence even of Jared Long in his friendship was unshaken.</p>

<p>"Bippo," said the Professor, speaking with the same quiet self-possession
he had shown in the first place, "they are going to attack us;
more than likely we shall be killed, but there is a chance for
you, because you are dressed like these people, and, so long as
you can keep in the shadow, you can pass for one of them; you
can slip out by the opening at the rear without being noticed;
steal away, find Pedros if you can, and leave."</p>

<p>The eyes of the servant seemed to protrude from his head, as
he grasped the fearful meaning of these words.  Then, clutching
his spear in his hand, he whisked like a shadow into the rear
apartment beyond sight.</p>

<p>Grimcke and Long smiled in each other's face; they could not
blame the fellow for thinking of his own safety.</p>

<p>"The music will begin in a few minutes," added the Professor. 
"I think you had better guard the rear; you understand, Jared,
that it's no time to throw away any powder."</p>

<p>"I don't propose to waste my ammunition," muttered the New Englander,
as he stepped softly into the rear apartment.</p>

<p>Only a slight reflection from the fire on the hearth found its
way into that part of the house, which had no window; but by the
dim light Jared Long saw a dusky figure come rapidly from the
door toward him.  He was on the point of raising his gun, when
it spoke:</p>

<p>"It's me &mdash;Bippo."</p>

<p>"I thought you had left.  Why didn't you go?"</p>

<p>"Love my white folks&mdash;can't leave 'em, stay die wid 'em."</p>

<p>This sounded very fine, but the New Englander was incredulous. 
He believed that their servant was more afraid to leave than to
stay.  He had probably taken a look outside and decided that he
was safer under the shelter of those three Winchesters (for the
weapon of poor Aaron Johnston was still in the possession of his
friends).</p>

<p>Long was inclined to ask him to take charge of the extra rifle,
and use it in helping to defend themselves; but, recalling the
antipathy of the fellow against handling firearms, he decided
that he would only throw away his cartridges.</p>

<p>He, therefore, cautioned him to keep out of the reach of any
of the missiles that were likely to come flying into the apartment,
and urged him, in case he saw any opening, to dart out among the
people and do his best to escape.</p>

<p>Professor Grimcke firmly believed that the impending fight would
be to the death, and that the only issue would be the slaying
of himself and companion.  It was the same danger they had faced
many times, with the difference that this was to be the last.</p>

<p>He surveyed his surroundings, like a general making ready to
receive the assault of a foe, and die fighting in the last ditch.</p>

<p>There was the door in front and the two windows, through which
the attack could be made.  He could cover all three with his repeating
rifle, and, when the last struggle came, appeal to his revolver
and knife.  He smiled, grimly at the reflection, that he had every
ground for believing, that the victory of the Murhapas would prove
the most costly they had ever won.  Jared Long was his equal in
markmanship and coolness, and, as he coolly remarked, there would
be no ammunition wasted, by either.</p>
