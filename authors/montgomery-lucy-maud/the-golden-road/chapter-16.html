Felicity, and Cecily, Dan, Felix, Sara Ray and I were sitting one
evening on the mossy stones in Uncle Roger's hill pasture, where
we had sat the morning the Story Girl told us the tale of the
Wedding Veil of the Proud Princess.  But it was evening now and
the valley beneath us was brimmed up with the glow of the
afterlight.  Behind us, two tall, shapely spruce trees rose up
against the sunset, and through the dark oriel of their sundered
branches an evening star looked down.  We sat on a little strip of
emerald grassland and before us was a sloping meadow all white
with daisies.
<P>
We were waiting for Peter and the Story Girl.  Peter had gone to
Markdale after dinner to spend the afternoon with his reunited
parents because it was his birthday.  He had left us grimly
determined to confess to his father the dark secret of his
Presbyterianism, and we were anxious to know what the result had
been.  The Story Girl had gone that morning with Miss Reade to
visit the latter's home near Charlottetown, and we expected soon
to see her coming gaily along over the fields from the Armstrong
place.
<P>
Presently Peter came jauntily stepping along the field path up the
hill.
<P>
"Hasn't Peter got tall?" said Cecily.
<P>
"Peter is growing to be a very fine looking boy," decreed
Felicity.
<P>
"I notice he's got ever so much handsomer since his father came
home," said Dan, with a killing sarcasm that was wholly lost on
Felicity, who gravely responded that she supposed it was because
Peter felt so much freer from care and responsibility.
<P>
"What luck, Peter?" yelled Dan, as soon as Peter was within earshot.
<P>
"Everything's all right," he shouted jubilantly.  "I told father
right off, licketty-split, as soon as I got home," he added when
he reached us.  "I was anxious to have it over with.  I says,
solemn-like, 'Dad, there's something I've got to tell you, and I
don't know how you'll take it, but it can't be helped,' I says. 
Dad looked pretty sober, and he says, says he, 'What have you been
up to, Peter?  Don't be afraid to tell me.  I've been forgiven to
seventy times seven, so surely I can forgive a little, too?'
'Well,' I says, desperate-like, 'the truth is, father, I'm a
Presbyterian.  I made up my mind last summer, the time of the
Judgment Day, that I'd be a Presbyterian, and I've got to stick to
it.  I'm sorry I can't be a Methodist, like you and mother and
Aunt Jane, but I can't and that's all there is to it,' I says. 
Then I waited, scared-like.  But father, he just looked relieved
and he says, says he, 'Goodness, boy, you can be a Presbyterian or
anything else you like, so long as it's Protestant.  I'm not
caring,' he says.  'The main thing is that you must be good and do
what's right.' I tell you," concluded Peter emphatically, "father
is a Christian all right."
<P>
"Well, I suppose your mind will be at rest now," said Felicity. 
"What's that you have in your buttonhole?"
<P>
"That's a four-leaved clover," answered Peter exultantly.  "That
means good luck for the summer.  I found it in Markdale.  There
ain't much clover in Carlisle this year of any kind of leaf.  The
crop is going to be a failure.  Your Uncle Roger says it's because
there ain't enough old maids in Carlisle.  There's lots of them in
Markdale, and that's the reason, he says, why they always have
such good clover crops there."
<P>
"What on earth have old maids to do with it?" cried Cecily.
<P>
"I don't believe they've a single thing to do with it, but Mr.
Roger says they have, and he says a man called Darwin proved it. 
This is the rigmarole he got off to me the other day.  The clover
crop depends on there being plenty of bumble-bees, because they
are the only insects with tongues long enough to--to--fer--
fertilize--I think he called it the blossoms.  But mice eat
bumble-bees and cats eat mice and old maids keep cats.  So your
Uncle Roger says the more old maids the more cats, and the more
cats the fewer field-mice, and the fewer field-mice the more
bumble-bees, and the more bumble-bees the better clover crops."
<P>
"So don't worry if you do get to be old maids, girls," said Dan. 
"Remember, you'll be helping the clover crops."
<P>
"I never heard such stuff as you boys talk," said Felicity, "and
Uncle Roger is no better."
<P>
"There comes the Story Girl," cried Cecily eagerly.  "Now we'll
hear all about Beautiful Alice's home."
<P>
The Story Girl was bombarded with eager questions as soon as she
arrived.  Miss Reade's home was a dream of a place, it appeared. 
The house was just covered with ivy and there was a most
delightful old garden--"and," added the Story Girl, with the joy
of a connoisseur who has found a rare gem, "the sweetest little
story connected with it.  And I saw the hero of the story too."
<P>
"Where was the heroine?" queried Cecily.
<P>
"She is dead."
<P>
"Oh, of course she'd have to die," exclaimed Dan in disgust.  "I'd
like a story where somebody lived once in awhile."
<P>
"I've told you heaps of stories where people lived," retorted the
Story Girl.  "If this heroine hadn't died there wouldn't have been
any story.  She was Miss Reade's aunt and her name was Una, and I
believe she must have been just like Miss Reade herself.  Miss
Reade told me all about her.  When we went into the garden I saw
in one corner of it an old stone bench arched over by a couple of
pear trees and all grown about with grass and violets.  And an old
man was sitting on it--a bent old man with long, snow-white hair
and beautiful sad blue eyes.  He seemed very lonely and sorrowful
and I wondered that Miss Reade didn't speak to him.  But she never
let on she saw him and took me away to another part of the garden. 
After awhile he got up and went away and then Miss Reade said,
'Come over to Aunt Una's seat and I will tell you about her and
her lover--that man who has just gone out.'
<P>
"'Oh, isn't he too old for a lover?' I said.
<P>
"Beautiful Alice laughed and said it was forty years since he had
been her Aunt Una's lover.  He had been a tall, handsome young man
then, and her Aunt Una was a beautiful girl of nineteen.
<P>
"We went over and sat down and Miss Reade told me all about her. 
She said that when she was a child she had heard much of her Aunt
Una--that she seemed to have been one of those people who are not
soon forgotten, whose personality seems to linger about the scenes
of their lives long after they have passed away."
<P>
"What is a personality?  Is it another word for ghost?" asked Peter.
<P>
"No," said the Story Girl shortly.  "I can't stop in a story to
explain words."
<P>
"I don't believe you know what it is yourself," said Felicity.
<P>
The Story Girl picked up her hat, which she had thrown down on the
grass, and placed it defiantly on her brown curls.
<P>
"I'm going in," she announced.  "I have to help Aunt Olivia ice a
cake tonight, and you all seem more interested in dictionaries
than stories."
<P>
"That's not fair," I exclaimed.  "Dan and Felix and Sara Ray and
Cecily and I have never said a word.  It's mean to punish us for
what Peter and Felicity did.  We want to hear the rest of the
story.  Never mind what a personality is but go on--and, Peter,
you young ass, keep still."
<P>
"I only wanted to know," muttered Peter sulkily.
<P>
"I DO know what personality is, but it's hard to explain," said
the Story Girl, relenting.  "It's what makes you different from
Dan, Peter, and me different from Felicity or Cecily.  Miss
Reade's Aunt Una had a personality that was very uncommon.  And
she was beautiful, too, with white skin and night-black eyes and
hair--a 'moonlight beauty,' Miss Reade called it.  She used to
keep a kind of a diary, and Miss Reade's mother used to read parts
of it to her.  She wrote verses in it and they were lovely; and
she wrote descriptions of the old garden which she loved very
much.  Miss Reade said that everything in the garden, plot or
shrub or tree, recalled to her mind some phrase or verse of her
Aunt Una's, so that the whole place seemed full of her, and her
memory haunted the walks like a faint, sweet perfume.
<P>
"Una had, as I've told you, a lover; and they were to have been
married on her twentieth birthday.  Her wedding dress was to have
been a gown of white brocade with purple violets in it.  But a
little while before it she took ill with fever and died; and she
was buried on her birthday instead of being married.  It was just
in the time of opening roses.  Her lover has been faithful to her
ever since; he has never married, and every June, on her birthday,
he makes a pilgrimage to the old garden and sits for a long time
in silence on the bench where he used to woo her on crimson eves
and moonlight nights of long ago.  Miss Reade says she always
loves to see him sitting there because it gives her such a deep
and lasting sense of the beauty and strength of love which can
thus outlive time and death.  And sometimes, she says, it gives
her a little eerie feeling, too, as if her Aunt Una were really
sitting there beside him, keeping tryst, although she has been in
her grave for forty years."
<P>
"It would be real romantic to die young and have your lover make a
pilgrimage to your garden every year," reflected Sara Ray.
<P>
"It would be more comfortable to go on living and get married to
him," said Felicity.  "Mother says all those sentimental ideas are
bosh and I expect they are.  It's a wonder Beautiful Alice hasn't
a beau herself.  She is so pretty and lady-like."
<P>
"The Carlisle fellows all say she is too stuck up," said Dan.
<P>
"There's nobody in Carlisle half good enough for her," cried the
Story Girl, "except--ex-cept--"
<P>
"Except who?" asked Felix.
<P>
"Never mind," said the Story Girl mysteriously.
