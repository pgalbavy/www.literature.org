<p>"Are you sure you're a cousin of mine?" Chirpy Cricket inquired of Mr.
Mole Cricket. "Don't you think that perhaps you are mistaken? I'm almost
certain you are."
</p>
<p>"No!" said Mr. Mole Cricket. "I can't be wrong. Why do you ask me such a
question?"
</p><p>"Your forefeet"--Chirpy told him--"your forefeet are so big! I've always
understood that all our family had small ones."
</p><p>Mr. Mole Cricket smiled.
</p><p>"Don't let the size of my feet trouble you!" he replied. "I couldn't be a
Mole Cricket if my feet were like yours. You see, I use my forefeet for
digging. And if they weren't big and strong I never could burrow in this
garden, nor anywhere else."
</p><p>Still Chirpy Cricket had his doubts.
</p><p>"I'm inclined to believe," he continued, "that you're related to
Grandfather Mole, and not to me. For your feet are very much like his."
</p><p>"Oh, no!" Mr. Mole Cricket cried. "And for pity's sake don't ever let
Grandfather Mole hear you say that! He'd be so angry that he'd eat me, as
likely as not. You see, he objects to my name. He says I have no right to
call myself Mr. Mole Cricket. But that's the name my family has always
had. And I can't very well change it."
</p><p>The poor fellow acted so alarmed that Chirpy Cricket hastened to promise
him that he would never mention his likeness to Grandfather Mole again.
</p><p>"Very well!" said Mr. Mole Cricket. "That's kind of you, I'm sure. And
now, if you want to make me quite happy, there's one more thing to which
you will agree."
</p><p>"What's that?" Chirpy Cricket asked. He felt sorry for Mr. Mole Cricket,
who had never known the pleasure of fiddling with a thousand other
musicians under the stars on a warm summer night. "If there is anything I
can do to make you happy, just tell me!"
</p><p>"Then call me 'Cousin'!" Mr. Mole Cricket begged him.
</p><p>Chirpy Cricket cast one glance at Mr. Mole Cricket's huge feet. In spite
of everything their owner had told him, Chirpy still found it difficult
to believe that Mr. Mole Cricket could be even a very distant relation.
</p><p>"I'll do it!" he said at last. "If it will make you any happier I'll call
you 'Cousin'--though you can't be any nearer than a hundred times
removed."
</p><p>It was easy to see that Mr. Mole Cricket was delighted.
</p><p>"Thank you! Thank you!" he exclaimed. "But permit me to correct you. I'm
your cousin a good many thousand times removed. But that's no reason why
we shouldn't be the best of friends. And now," he added, "won't you come
home with me? I'd like you to meet my wife."
</p><p>While thanking him for the invitation, Chirpy Cricket couldn't help
wondering whether Mr. Mole Cricket's wife had as big feet as her
husband.
