<P>
THE instant Isabel was out of hearing, Old Sharon slapped Moody
on the shoulder to rouse his attention. "I've got her out of the
way," he said, "now listen to me. My business with the young
angel is done--I may go back to London."
<P>
Moody looked at him with astonishment.
<P>
"Lord! how little you know of thieves!" exclaimed Old Sharon.
"Why, man alive, I have tried her with two plain tests! If you
wanted a proof of her innocence, there it was, as plain as the
nose in your face. Did you hear me ask her how she came to seal
the letter--just when her mind was running on something else?"
<P>
"I heard you," said Moody.
<P>
"Did you see how she started and stared  at me?"
<P>
"I di d."
<P>
"Well, I can tell you this--if she _had_ stolen the money she
would neither have started nor stared. She would have had her
answer ready beforehand in her own mind, in case of accidents.
There's only one thing in my experience that you can never do
with a thief, when a thief happens to be a woman--you can never
take her by surprise. Put that remark by in your mind; one day
you may find a use for remembering it. Did you see her blush, and
look quite hurt in her feelings, pretty dear, when I asked about
her sweetheart? Do you think a thief, in her place, would have
shown such a face as that? Not she! The thief would have been
relieved. The thief would have said to herself, 'All right! the
more the old fool talks about sweethearts the further he is from
tracing the robbery to Me!' Yes! yes! the ground's cleared now,
Master Moody. I've reckoned up the servants; I've questioned Miss
Isabel; I've made my inquiries in all the other quarters that may
be useful to us--and what's the result? The advice I gave, when
you and the lawyer first came to me--I hate that fellow!--remains
as sound and good advice as ever. I have got the thief in my
mind," said Old Sharon, closing his cunning eyes and then opening
them again, "as plain as I've got you in my eye at this minute.
No more of that now," he went on, looking round sharply at the
path that led to the farmhouse. "I've something particular to say
to you--and there's barely time to say it before that nice girl
comes back. Look here! Do you happen to be acquainted with
Mr.-Honorable-Hardyman's valet?"
<P>
Moody's eyes rested on Old Sharon with a searching and doubtful
look.
<P>
"Mr. Hardyman's valet?" he repeated. "I wasn't prepared to hear
Mr. Hardyman's name."
<P>
Old Sharon looked at Moody, in his turn, with a flash of sardonic
triumph.
<P>
"Oho!" he said. "Has my good boy learned his lesson? Do you see
the thief through my spectacles, already?"
<P>
"I began to see him," Moody answered, "when you gave us the
guinea opinion at your lodgings."
<P>
"Will you whisper his name?" asked Old Sharon.
<P>
"Not yet. I distrust my own judgment. I wait till time proves
that you are right."
<P>
Old Sharon knitted his shaggy brows and shook his head. "If you
had only a little more dash and go in you," he said, "you would
be a clever fellow. As it is--!" He finished the sentence by
snapping his fingers with a grin of contempt. "Let's get to
business. Are you going back by the next train along with me? or
are you going to stop with the young lady?"
<P>
"I will follow you by a later train," Moody answered.
<P>
"Then I must give you my instructions at once," Sharon continued.
"You get better acquainted with Hardyman's valet. Lend him money
if he wants it--stick at nothing to make a bosom friend of him. I
can't do that part of it; my appearance would be against me.
_You_ are the man--you are respectable from the top of your hat
to the tips of your boots; nobody would suspect You. Don't make
objections! Can you fix the valet? Or can't you?"
<P>
"I can try," said Moody. "And what then?"
<P>
Old Sharon put his gross lips disagreeably close to Moody's ear.
<P>
"Your friend the valet can tell you who his master's bankers
are," he said; "and he can supply you with a specimen of his
master's handwriting."
<P>
Moody drew back, as suddenly as if his vagabond companion had put
a knife to his throat. "You old villain!" he said. "Are you
tempting me to forgery?"
<P>
"You infernal fool!" retorted Old Sharon. "_Will_ you hold that
long tongue of yours, and hear what I have to say. You go to
Hardyman's bankers, with a note in Hardyman's handwriting
(exactly imitated by me) to this effect:--'Mr. H. presents his
compliments to Messrs. So-and-So, and is not quite certain
whether a payment of five hundred pounds has been made within the
last week to his account. He will be much obliged if Messrs.
So-and-So will inform him by a line in reply, whether there is
such an entry to his credit in their books, and by whom the
payment has been made.' You wait for the bankers' answer, and
bring it to me. It's just possible that the name you're afraid to
whisper may appear in the letter. If it does, we've caught our
man. Is _that_ forgery, Mr. Muddlehead Moody? I'll tell you
what--if I had lived to be your age, and knew no more of the
world than you do, I'd go and hang myself. Steady! here's our
charming friend with the milk. Remember your instructions, and
don't lose heart if my notion of the payment to the bankers comes
to nothing. I know what to do next, in that case--and, what's
more, I'll take all the risk and trouble on my own shoulders. Oh,
Lord! I'm afraid I shall be obliged to drink the milk, now it's
come!"
<P>
With this apprehension in his mind, he advanced to relieve Isabel
of the jug that she carried.
<P>
"Here's a treat!" he burst out, with an affectation of joy, which
was completely belied by the expression of his dirty face.
"Here's a kind and dear young lady, to help an old man to a drink
with her own pretty hands." He paused, and looked at the milk
very much as he might have looked at a dose of physic. "Will
anyone take a drink first?" he asked, offering the jug piteously
to Isabel and Moody. "You see, I'm not wed to genuine milk; I'm
used to chalk and water. I don't know what effect the
unadulterated cow might have on my poor old inside." He tasted
the milk with the greatest caution. "Upon my soul, this is too
rich for me! The unadulterated cow is a deal too strong to be
drunk alone. If you'll allow me I'll qualify it with a drop of
gin. Here, Puggy, Puggy!" He set the milk down before the dog;
and, taking a flask out of his pocket, emptied it at a draught.
"That's something like!" he said, smacking his lips with an air
of infinite relief. "So sorry, Miss, to have given you all your
trouble for nothing; it's my ignorance that's to blame, not me. I
couldn't know I was unworthy of genuine milk till I tried--could
l? And do you know," he proceeded, with his eyes directed slyly
on the way back to the station, "I begin to think I'm not worthy
of the fresh air, either. A kind of longing seems to come over me
for the London stink. I'm home-sick already for the soot of my
happy childhood and my own dear native mud. The air here is too
thin for me, and the sky's too clean; and--oh, Lord!--when you're
wed to the roar of the traffic--the 'busses and the cabs and what
not--the silence in these parts is downright awful. I'll wish you
good evening, miss; and get back to London."
<P>
Isabel turned to Moody with disappointment plainly expressed in
her face and manner.
<P>
"Is that all he has to say?" she asked. "You told me he could
help us. You led me to suppose he could find the guilty person."
<P>
Sharon heard her. "I could name the guilty person," he answered,
"as easily, miss, as I could name you."
<P>
"Why don't you do it then?" Isabel inquired, not very patiently
<P>
"Because the time's not ripe for it yet, miss--that's one reason.
Because, if I mentioned the thief's name, as things are now, you,
Miss Isabel, would think me mad; and you would tell Mr. Moody I
had cheated him out of his money--that's another reason. The
matter's in train, if you will only wait a little longer."
<P>
"So you say," Isabel rejoined. "If you really could name the
thief, I believe you would do it now."
<P>
She turned away with a frown on her pretty face. Old Sharon
followed her. Even his coarse sensibilities appeared to feel the
irresistible ascendancy of beauty and youth.
<P>
"I say!" he began, "we must part friends, you know--or I shall
break my heart over it. They have got milk at the farmhouse. Do
you think they have got pen, ink, and paper too?"
<P>
Isabel answered, without turning to look at him, "Of course they
have!"
<P>
"And a bit of sealing-wax?"
<P>
"I daresay!"
<P>
Old Sharon laid his dirty claws on her shoulder and forced her to
face him as the best means of shaking them off.
<P>
"Come along!" he said. "I am going to pacify you with some
information in writing."
<P>
"Why should you write it?" Isabel asked suspiciously.
<P>
"Because I mean to make my own conditions, my dear, before I let
you into the secret."
<P>
In ten minutes more they were all three in the farmhouse parlor.
Nobody but the farmer's wife was at home. The good  woman trembled
from head to foot at the sight of Old Sharon. In all her harmless
life she had never yet seen humanity under the aspect in which it
was now presented to her. "Mercy preserve us, Miss!" she
whispered to Isabel, "how come you to be in such company as
_that?_" Instructed by Isabel, she produced the necessary
materials for writing and sealing--and, that done, she shrank
away to the door. "Please to excuse me, miss," she said with a
last horrified look at her venerable visitor; "I really can't
stand the sight of such a blot of dirt as that in my nice clean
parlor." With those words she disappeared, and was seen no more.
<P>
Perfectly indifferent to his reception, Old Sharon wrote,
inclosed what he had written in an envelope; and sealed it (in
the absence of anything better fitted for his purpose) with the
mouthpiece of his pipe.
<P>
"Now, miss," he said, "you give me your word of honor"--he
stopped and looked round at Moody with a grin--"and you give me
yours, that you won't either of you break the seal on this
envelope till the expiration of one week from the present day.
There are the conditions, Miss Isabel, on which I'll give you
your information. If you stop to dispute with me, the candle's
alight, and I'll burn it!"
<P>
It was useless to contend with him. Isabel and Moody gave him the
promise that he required. He handed the sealed envelope to Isabel
with a low bow. "When the week's out," he said, "you will own I'm
a cleverer fellow than you think me now. Wish you good evening,
Miss. Come along, Puggy! Farewell to the horrid clean country,
and back again to the nice London stink!"
<P>
He nodded to Moody--he leered at Isabel--he chuckled to
himself--he left the farmhouse.
