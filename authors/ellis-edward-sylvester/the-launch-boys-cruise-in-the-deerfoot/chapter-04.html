<p>The elder Murphy looked at his son with a quizzical expression
and then glanced at the hat which had been hung on a peg behind
the door.</p>

<p>"And where did ye get that?"</p>

<p>"Traded me owld one for it, but I had to go through a foight
before the ither chap would give his consint."</p>

<p>The father's face brightened.</p>

<p>"So ye've been in anither foight, have ye, and only well landed
in Ameriky."</p>

<p>"I niver had a foiner one," replied the son, still standing in
the open door which led to the kitchen; "it makes me heart glad
when I think of the same."</p>

<p>"And which licked?"</p>

<p>Mike was quick to seize the opportunity for which he was waiting.
With a downcast expression, he humbly asked:</p>

<p>"Do ye expict me to win <em>ivery</em> time, dad?"</p>

<p>"Av coorse I do; haven't I trained ye up to that shtyle of fightin'?"</p>

<p>"Suppose, dad, the ither chap is bigger and stronger&mdash;what do
ye ixpict of me?"</p>

<p>"Ye know yoursilf what to expict when ye disgraces the name of
Murphy."</p>

<p>Laying his pipe on the table beside which his wife was sitting,
the parent grimly rose and moved toward the door on the other
side of the room that opened into the small apartment where the
firewood was stored from wetting by rain. The three knew the meaning
of the movement: he was seeking the heavy strap that was looped
over a big spike. He had brought it from Tipperary two years before
and must have kept it against the coming of his heir, knowing
he would have use for it.</p>

<p>"Have done wid yer supper," he said to Mike, "and after the same,
I'll do me dooty by ye."</p>

<p>The grinning lad was still standing in the kitchen door. The
action of his father turned his back toward the youth, who winked
at Alvin, stepped across the threshold and sat down at the end
of the table where he was in sight, but the greater portion of
the table itself was hidden.</p>

<p>Although the moonlight had given the visitor a good view of his
young friend, the glow of the lamp now showed his face and features
with the distinctness of midday. Alvin was sure he had never seen
so homely a youth. The countenance was broad and covered with
so many freckles that they showed on the tips of his large ears.
The nose was an emphatic pug, and the mouth wide and filled with
large white teeth, upon which no dentist could have found a pin
speck. His short hair was the color of a well burned brick, stood
straight up from the crown and projected like quills from the
sides of his head, his complexion being of the same hue as the
hair.</p>

<p>Although of stocky build, being hardly as tall as Alvin, the
frame of the Irish youth was a model of strength and grace. There
were few of his age who in a rough and tumble bout could hold
their own with him. The night being sultry, he wore no coat or
waistcoat, but the shirt, guiltless of tie, was clean, as were
the trousers supported by a belt encircling the sturdy waist.
His dusty tan shoes were neatly tied and the yellow socks which
matched them could not have been less soiled.</p>

<p>The best "feature" about Mike Murphy was his good nature. His
spirits were irrepressible, and he was always ready with quip
and wit. Looking into the broad shining face one was reminded
of the remark made about Abraham Lincoln: he was so homely that
he crossed the line and became handsome.</p>

<p>Alvin's chair being near the front door with Mike in plain sight,
he kept his eyes upon him for a minute or two. He saw him reach
his fork across the table and bring a huge baked potato to his
plate. He twisted it apart in the middle so as to expose the flaky
whiteness and then snapped the fingers of both hands at his sides.
With a grin he looked at Alvin and asked:</p>

<p>"Do ye know what's the hottest thing in the wurruld?"</p>

<p>"How about a live coal of fire?"</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, it's the inside of a baked pratie; a coal of fire
is a cooling breeze alongside the same. Be the same towken, can
ye tell me the cowldest thing on airth?"</p>

<p>"A piece of ice will do very well."</p>

<p>"Ye're off: it's the handle of a pitchfork on a frosty mornin';
if ye don't belave it try the expirimint for yersilf. But I must
attind to plaisure, as me cousin said whin he grabbed his shillaleh
and attacked his loved brother."</p>

<p>Mike now gave his whole attention to the meal. When it is remembered
that he was ravenously hungry and the provision bountiful, enough
is said. His father came back into the sitting room, tossed the
heavy strap on the stand, beside which his wife was still serenely
sewing, picked up his pipe and by sucking vigorously upon it renewed
the fire that had nearly gone out. He crossed his legs and slowly
rocked to and fro, glancing hospitably at Alvin.</p>

<p>While the latter was greatly amused by what he had seen and heard,
he was also distressed for his friend Mike, whose idea of a joke
was unique. There could be no mistaking the meaning of his father's
actions. The son was due for a sharp castigation and was certain
to receive it unless the caller interposed with a truthful statement
of the recent occurrence.</p>

<p>Alvin rose from his chair and stepping to the kitchen door, gently
closed it. Mrs. Murphy looked up through her spectacles.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that ye wants to shet out the noise Mike makes
whin aiting, fur the same is scand'lous."</p>

<p>"It isn't that, but I don't wish him to hear what I say to you."</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him to hold a finger of aich hand in his ears while
he's aiting?" asked the mother without a smile.</p>

<p>"He might find that inconvenient. Mike told you the truth when
he said he was in a fight to-night."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt the same, but I demands to know why he 'lowed
himself to git licked?" said the father, with no little heat.</p>

<p>"He wasn't licked: it was the other fellow who got the worst
of it."</p>

<p>"Why, thin, did the spalpeen say it was himself that was bested?"</p>

<p>"Begging your pardon, Pat, he did not. He stated a general truth,
which no one can deny, to the effect that a fellow like him takes
a chance of being defeated now and then. Listen to my story."</p>

<p>Thereupon Alvin related the incidents with which you are familiar,
adding:</p>

<p>"If it hadn't been for Mike's arrival and his brave fight in
my behalf, I should have been badly beaten and robbed. The first
wretch even fired a pistol during the rumpus."</p>

<p>"Did he kill aither of ye?" asked the startled father.</p>

<p>"The shot was not aimed at me or him, but was meant to scare
me into stopping and giving up. If I had thought of it I should
have taken the weapon from him and given it to Mike. Let me tell
you," added Alvin impressively, "both of you ought to be proud
of such a son as Mike."</p>

<p>"So we are," quietly remarked the mother, without looking up
or checking her flying needle.</p>

<p>"There isn't a pluckier lad in the world. He came to my help
like a whirlwind, and the way he sailed into the fellow who struck
me from behind showed Mike to be a hero."</p>

<p>The father reached out and grasped the loop of leather lying
on the stand. Rising to his feet he passed into the small room
where the stove wood was piled and hung the strap again upon the
metal peg. As he came back and resumed his seat he sighed. It
looked as if he was disappointed.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do with him, Pat?"</p>

<p>"Train him up in the way he should go. Whin the school opens
at Southport he will attind there, and whin he's at home I'll
find enough to kaap him out of mischief."</p>

<p>"School will not open until September, which is several weeks
away. I want you to lend Mike to me until then."</p>

<p>Mrs. Murphy stopped her sewing for the moment and looked at their
visitor. Her husband removed the pipe from his mouth and also
stared at him.</p>

<p>"Lind him to ye!" he repeated. "And phwat would you do wid him?"</p>

<p>"You know father bought me a motor boat, which arrived a few
days ago. Chester Haynes and I have had great fun cruising up
the Kennebec and different bays and streams, and we are going
to keep at it until we have to go home. We want Mike to join us
and share our sport, just as long as Chester and I are in this
part of the world. You won't refuse me the favor?"</p>

<p>It was evident that the parents were pleased with the request.
The proud mother said:</p>

<p>"Mike is so gintle that he'll be a good companion for anyone."</p>

<p>"Yis; because of his gintleness," repeated the father grimly.
"But it saams to me ye're too kind, Alvin; he won't be able to
airn his kaap and the indulgence ye'll give him."</p>

<p>"Won't earn them! Why, we don't intend to hire him; it's the
pleasure we shall have in the company of such a good fellow as
Mike. Besides," added Alvin, lowering his voice, "I have a feeling
that we're not through with those two fellows who attacked me
to-night. Mike won't be satisfied until he has paid the one who
ran away from him and left his hat behind."</p>

<p>"Ye're wilcome to the lad," assented his father, "and I take
it as very good on yer part, which is what ivery one has a right
to ixpict from yersilf and father."</p>

<p>"No blarneying, Pat," protested their caller. "I am obliged to
you for granting my request, for the favor will be wholly given
to us."</p>

<p>"Now it's yersilf that's blarneying," said Pat.</p>

<p>The kitchen door softly opened and the grinning, red-faced Mike
came into the room and sat down near his young friend.</p>

<p>"I overheerd ivery word that was said, Captain, and it's Mike
Murphy that's thankful for yer kindness. I'm wid ye to the ind."</p>

<p>The others laughed at the use of the title by the Irish youth,
who explained:</p>

<p>"Av coorse it's 'Captain Landon,' being that ye're the owner
of the motor boat, as ye calls the same."</p>

<p>"And you shall be my first mate," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"Won't Chister, as ye name him, be jealous and indulge in mootiny?"</p>

<p>"No fear of that; we'll satisfy him by making him second mate,
while all three will form the crew. And now I must bid you good
night. I shall call for you as soon as we are through breakfast
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>With which our young friend went to his own home.</p>
