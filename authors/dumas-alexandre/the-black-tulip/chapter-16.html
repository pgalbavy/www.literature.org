<P>The worthy Master Gryphus, as the reader may have seen, was 
far from sharing the kindly feeling of his daughter for the 
godson of Cornelius de Witt.</P>
<P>There being only five prisoners at Loewestein, the post of 
turnkey was not a very onerous one, but rather a sort of 
sinecure, given after a long period of service.</P>
<P>But the worthy jailer, in his zeal, had magnified with all 
the power of his imagination the importance of his office. 
To him Cornelius had swelled to the gigantic proportions of 
a criminal of the first order. He looked upon him, 
therefore, as the most dangerous of all his prisoners. He 
watched all his steps, and always spoke to him with an angry 
countenance; punishing him for what he called his dreadful 
rebellion against such a clement prince as the Stadtholder.</P>
<P>Three times a day he entered Van Baerle's cell, expecting to 
find him trespassing; but Cornelius had ceased to 
correspond, since his correspondent was at hand. It is even 
probable that, if Cornelius had obtained his full liberty, 
with permission to go wherever he liked, the prison, with 
Rosa and his bulbs, would have appeared to him preferable to 
any other habitation in the world without Rosa and his 
bulbs.</P>
<P>Rosa, in fact, had promised to come and see him every 
evening, and from the first evening she had kept her word.</P>
<P>On the following evening she went up as before, with the 
same mysteriousness and the same precaution. Only she had 
this time resolved within herself not to approach too near 
the grating. In order, however, to engage Van Baerle in a 
conversation from the very first which would seriously 
occupy his attention, she tendered to him through the 
grating the three bulbs, which were still wrapped up in the 
same paper.</P>
<P>But to the great astonishment of Rosa, Van Baerle pushed 
back her white hand with the tips of his fingers.</P>
<P>The young man had been considering about the matter.</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to me,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we should risk too much by 
embarking our whole fortune in one ship. Only think, my dear 
Rosa, that the question is to carry out an enterprise which 
until now has been considered impossible, namely, that of 
making the great black tulip flower. Let us, therefore, take 
every possible precaution, so that in case of a failure we 
may not have anything to reproach ourselves with. I will now 
tell you the way I have traced out for us.&quot;</P>
<P>Rosa was all attention to what he would say, much more on 
account of the importance which the unfortunate 
tulip-fancier attached to it, than that she felt interested 
in the matter herself.</P>
<P>&quot;I will explain to you, Rosa,&quot; he said. &quot;I dare say you have 
in this fortress a small garden, or some courtyard, or, if 
not that, at least some terrace.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We have a very fine garden,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;it runs along the 
edge of the Waal, and is full of fine old trees.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Could you bring me some soil from the garden, that I may 
judge?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will do so to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Take some from a sunny spot, and some from a shady, so that 
I may judge of its properties in a dry and in a moist 
state.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Be assured I shall.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;After having chosen the soil, and, if it be necessary, 
modified it, we will divide our three bulbs; you will take 
one and plant it, on the day that I will tell you, in the 
soil chosen by me. It is sure to flower, if you tend it 
according to my directions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will not lose sight of it for a minute.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will give me another, which I will try to grow here in 
my cell, and which will help me to beguile those long weary 
hours when I cannot see you. I confess to you I have very 
little hope for the latter one, and I look beforehand on 
this unfortunate bulb as sacrificed to my selfishness. 
However, the sun sometimes visits me. I will, besides, try 
to convert everything into an artificial help, even the heat 
and the ashes of my pipe, and lastly, we, or rather you, 
will keep in reserve the third sucker as our last resource, 
in case our first two experiments should prove a failure. In 
this manner, my dear Rosa, it is impossible that we should 
not succeed in gaining the hundred thousand guilders for 
your marriage portion; and how dearly shall we enjoy that 
supreme happiness of seeing our work brought to a successful 
issue!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I know it all now,&quot; said Rosa. &quot;I will bring you the soil 
to-morrow, and you will choose it for your bulb and for 
mine. As to that in which yours is to grow, I shall have 
several journeys to convey it to you, as I cannot bring much 
at a time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There is no hurry for it, dear Rosa; our tulips need not be 
put into the ground for a month at least. So you see we have 
plenty of time before us. Only I hope that, in planting your 
bulb, you will strictly follow all my instructions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I promise you I will.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And when you have once planted it, you will communicate to 
me all the circumstances which may interest our nursling; 
such as change of weather, footprints on the walks, or 
footprints in the borders. You will listen at night whether 
our garden is not resorted to by cats. A couple of those 
untoward animals laid waste two of my borders at Dort.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will listen.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;On moonlight nights have you ever looked at your garden, my 
dear child?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The window of my sleeping-room overlooks it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, on moonlight nights you will observe whether any rats 
come out from the holes in the wall. The rats are most 
mischievous by their gnawing everything; and I have heard 
unfortunate tulip-growers complain most bitterly of Noah for 
having put a couple of rats in the ark.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will observe, and if there are cats or rats  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You will apprise me of it,  -  that's right. And, moreover,&quot; 
Van Baerle, having become mistrustful in his captivity, 
continued, &quot;there is an animal much more to be feared than 
even the cat or the rat.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What animal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Man. You comprehend, my dear Rosa, a man may steal a 
guilder, and risk the prison for such a trifle, and, 
consequently, it is much more likely that some one might 
steal a hundred thousand guilders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No one ever enters the garden but myself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, thank you, my dear Rosa. All the joy of my life 
has still to come from you.&quot;</P>
<P>And as the lips of Van Baerle approached the grating with 
the same ardor as the day before, and as, moreover, the hour 
for retiring had struck, Rosa drew back her head, and 
stretched out her hand.</P>
<P>In this pretty little hand, of which the coquettish damsel 
was particularly proud, was the bulb.</P>
<P>Cornelius kissed most tenderly the tips of her fingers. Did 
he do so because the hand kept one of the bulbs of the great 
black tulip, or because this hand was Rosa's? We shall leave 
this point to the decision of wiser heads than ours.</P>
<P>Rosa withdrew with the other two suckers, pressing them to 
her heart.</P>
<P>Did she press them to her heart because they were the bulbs 
of the great black tulip, or because she had them from 
Cornelius?</P>
<P>This point, we believe, might be more readily decided than 
the other.</P>
<P>However that may have been, from that moment life became 
sweet, and again full of interest to the prisoner.</P>
<P>Rosa, as we have seen, had returned to him one of the 
suckers.</P>
<P>Every evening she brought to him, handful by handful, a 
quantity of soil from that part of the garden which he had 
found to be the best, and which, indeed, was excellent.</P>
<P>A large jug, which Cornelius had skilfully broken, did 
service as a flower-pot. He half filled it, and mixed the 
earth of the garden with a small portion of dried river mud, 
a mixture which formed an excellent soil.</P>
<P>Then, at the beginning of April, he planted his first sucker 
in that jug.</P>
<P>Not a day passed on which Rosa did not come to have her chat 
with Cornelius.</P>
<P>The tulips, concerning whose cultivation Rosa was taught all 
the mysteries of the art, formed the principal topic of the 
conversation; but, interesting as the subject was, people 
cannot always talk about tulips.</P>
<P>They therefore began to chat also about other things, and 
the tulip-fancier found out to his great astonishment what a 
vast range of subjects a conversation may comprise.</P>
<P>Only Rosa had made it a habit to keep her pretty face 
invariably six inches distant from the grating, having 
perhaps become distrustful of herself.</P>
<P>There was one thing especially which gave Cornelius almost 
as much anxiety as his bulbs  -  a subject to which he always 
returned  -  the dependence of Rosa on her father.</P>
<P>Indeed, Van Baerle's happiness depended on the whim of this 
man. He might one day find Loewestein dull, or the air of 
the place unhealthy, or the gin bad, and leave the fortress, 
and take his daughter with him, when Cornelius and Rosa 
would again be separated.</P>
<P>&quot;Of what use would the carrier pigeons then be?&quot; said 
Cornelius to Rosa, &quot;as you, my dear girl, would not be able 
to read what I should write to you, nor to write to me your 
thoughts in return.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; answered Rosa, who in her heart was as much afraid 
of a separation as Cornelius himself, &quot;we have one hour 
every evening, let us make good use of it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I don't think we make such a bad use of it as it is.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us employ it even better,&quot; said Rosa, smiling. &quot;Teach 
me to read and write. I shall make the best of your lessons, 
believe me; and, in this way, we shall never be separated 
any more, except by our own will.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, then, we have an eternity before us,&quot; said Cornelius.</P>
<P>Rosa smiled, and quietly shrugged her shoulders.</P>
<P>&quot;Will you remain for ever in prison?&quot; she said, &quot;and after 
having granted you your life, will not his Highness also 
grant you your liberty? And will you not then recover your 
fortune, and be a rich man, and then, when you are driving 
in your own coach, riding your own horse, will you still 
look at poor Rosa, the daughter of a jailer, scarcely better 
than a hangman?&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius tried to contradict her, and certainly he would 
have done so with all his heart, and with all the sincerity 
of a soul full of love.</P>
<P>She, however, smilingly interrupted him, saying, &quot;How is 
your tulip going on?&quot;</P>
<P>To speak to Cornelius of his tulip was an expedient resorted 
to by her to make him forget everything, even Rosa herself.</P>
<P>&quot;Very well, indeed,&quot; he said, &quot;the coat is growing black, 
the sprouting has commenced, the veins of the bulb are 
swelling, in eight days hence, and perhaps sooner, we may 
distinguish the first buds of the leaves protruding. And 
yours Rosa?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, I have done things on a large scale, and according to 
your directions.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Now, let me hear, Rosa, what you have done,&quot; said 
Cornelius, with as tender an anxiety as he had lately shown 
to herself.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; she said, smiling, for in her own heart she could 
not help studying this double love of the prisoner for 
herself and for the black tulip, &quot;I have done things on a 
large scale; I have prepared a bed as you described it to 
me, on a clear spot, far from trees and walls, in a soil 
slightly mixed with sand, rather moist than dry without a 
fragment of stone or pebble.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well done, Rosa, well done.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am now only waiting for your further orders to put in the 
bulb, you know that I must be behindhand with you, as I have 
in my favour all the chances of good air, of the sun, and 
abundance of moisture.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;All true, all true,&quot; exclaimed Cornelius, clapping his 
hands with joy, &quot;you are a good pupil, Rosa, and you are 
sure to gain your hundred thousand guilders.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't forget,&quot; said Rosa, smiling, &quot;that your pupil, as you 
call me, has still other things to learn besides the 
cultivation of tulips.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes, and I am as anxious as you are, Rosa, that you 
should learn to read.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;When shall we begin?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At once.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why to-morrow?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Because to-day our hour is expired, and I must leave you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Already? But what shall we read?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh,&quot; said Rosa, &quot;I have a book,  -  a book which I hope will 
bring us luck.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow, then.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, to-morrow.&quot;</P>
<P>On the following evening Rosa returned with the Bible of 
Cornelius de Witt. </P></article>
