<p>The report of the gun reached the ears of Otto and Jack, and
naturally caused them alarm.  They hurriedly made their way to
the edge of the river and peered out from cover, not forgetting
the warnings previously given by Deerfoot.</p>

<p>They had but to look a short distance down stream to see the
Shawanoe paddling the large Indian canoe toward the other shore.</p>

<p>"Well, dere!" exclaimed Otto.  "Deerfoot dinks as how I ain'ty
forgotful, but don't he forget more than I does, when he dinks
he has us in the canoe and we be here?"</p>

<p>"There is no danger of that," said Jack; "he knows it would not
do for him to come after us, for the Indians would shoot him from
this side."'</p>

<p>"Why would dey do dem things?"</p>

<p>"Because it is the nature of Indians to revenge themselves that
way. Don't you see he has taken their canoe, and I shouldn't wonder
if he killed one or two of their warriors before he was able to
get off with it.  That shot which we heard was probably fired
at him."</p>

<p>But in this instance the ears of the German proved more correct
than those of the American.  He had noticed that the gun was discharged
from the river, establishing the fact that it was fired by Deerfoot,
though Jack Carleton could not understand the reason why it was
done.</p>

<p>It was manifest that the Shawanoe meant to cross to the other
side the Mississippi, in order to throw the Miamis "off the trail
"&mdash;that is, he would keep out of their sight until he gained a
chance to return for his friends.</p>

<p>It occurred at once to the young Kentuckian that such being the
case, the situation of himself and Otto was one of considerable
danger.</p>

<p>The high-handed course of the Shawanoe would rouse the enmity
of the Miamis to the highest point.  Revenge is one of the most
marked characteristics of the American Indian, who is eager to
retaliate upon the innocent when he cannot reach the guilty. 
The three who had suffered the indignity could easily follow the
trail of the boys, wheresoever it might lead, excepting through
water.  What, therefore, was more likely than that they would
seek to adjust matters by slaying those who had taken no hand
in the capture of the canoe?</p>

<p>Jack knew that there were only three Miamis directly concerned,
but Deerfoot had spoken of others in the neighborhood, beside
which the young Kentuckian himself had seen a couple of Shawanoes,
only a few hours before, at no great distance from that very spot.</p>

<p>When he made known his fears to Otto, the latter agreed they
were in great peril, and the utmost care was necessary to keep
clear of the red men.</p>

<p>The precise course best to adopt was hard to determine, but they
began a guarded departure from the spot, stepping as carefully
and lightly as possible.</p>

<p>Though Otto Relstaub, like his, parents, had never been able
to handle the English language intelligently, and though he was
afflicted with a forgetfulness all too common with most boys of
his age, yet his life on the frontier had not been without its
lessons to him.  At times he showed a shrewdness and knowledge
of woodcraft which surprised Jack Carleton, who often became impatient
with his shortsightedness.  The manner in which he seconded the
efforts of his companion to mislead the Indians, known to be close
at hand, certainly was deserving of high praise.</p>

<p>The friends advanced some twenty rods or more, Otto keeping close
behind Jack, without seeing or hearing anything of their enemies.
Looking across the Mississippi, nothing was observed of Deerfoot
or his canoe, so that no help was to be expected for many hours
from him.  Indeed, Jack was confident that nothing of the kind
could be done before night, when the matchless Shawanoe would
have the darkness to help him.  To the young Kentuckian, the advent
of Deerfoot was of that nature that he failed to see that it had
accomplished any good.  If he and Otto could gain a suitable start,
they would swim across.</p>

<p>"Sh!" whispered the German, reaching forward and catching the
arm of his friend; "waits one, two, dree smond."</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked the alarmed Jack, as he turned hastily
about.</p>

<p>"Let you go dot way and me go dot way, and it leetle ways off
we comes togedder agin once more."</p>

<p>Rather curiously, the leader was asking himself at that moment
whether something could not be gained by him and Otto separating
and afterward meeting at some point further up stream.</p>

<p>Such, as is well known, is the practice of the Apaches when hotly
pursued to their mountain fastnesses.  A large company will dissolve
into its "original elements," as may be said, rendering pursuit
out of the question.</p>

<p>The wisdom of this course on the part of Jack and Otto might
well be questioned, but, without giving the matter any thought,
the young Kentuckian acted upon the suggestion.</p>

<p>"You keep close to the river," he said, "while I turn to the
right, and will come back to the shore a few hundred yards above. 
We'll use our old signal if we have anything to say to each other."</p>

<p>Otto nodded his bead to signify that he understood the arrangement,
and, without another word, the two diverged, speedily losing sight
of each other in the wood, which showed more under growth than
that through which they passed the day before.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Jack to himself, before he had gone far, "I
much misgive myself whether this is going to help matters; it
must be a good deal easier for the Indians to pick up one of us
at a time, than it is to take the two together.  It may be best
after all," he added a minute later, with the natural hopefulness
of his nature, "for I learned long ago that if two or three hunters
separate while in the Indian country, they can take better care
of themselves than if they stay together."</p>

<p>He stood still and looked and listened.  The wood, as has been
said, was denser than that to which he had been accustomed, and,
when he used his eyes to the utmost, he saw nothing to cause alarm. 
The lynx-eyed Miamis could follow his trail with little trouble,
no matter how much be sought to conceal it, and the fact that
he saw and heard nothing could be no proof that danger itself
was not near.</p>

<p>"I am sure those were Shawanoes that I saw yesterday," he muttered,
"and yet Deerfoot insists they were Miamis who broke up his canoe.
Wonder whether there's a war party of both&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bright eyes of the youth at that very moment told him a singular
fact: only a short distance in front of him stood two red men
in their war paint.  They were talking together and had their
backs toward him.  Indeed, they were so motionless, that he had
failed to see them in the first place, and would have failed again
but for the low, guttural murmur of their voices.</p>

<p>Jack instantly stepped behind the large trunk of a tree and peered
out with an interest that may well be understood.  It was curious
that the youth should have approached so close without detection,
but it was complimentary to his woodcraft that such was the fact.</p>

<p>Whatever the subject of conversation between the Indians, they
speedily became absorbed in it, their arms sawed the air, and
their voices rose to it pitch that carried the sound far beyond
where he stood.</p>

<p>Their interest in the discussion frequently brought the profile
of the further one into view and showed so much of his front,
that his tribal character was settled beyond question; he was
a Shawanoe, one of the dreaded people who did more than any other
to earn the name of Dark and Bloody Ground for one section of
the Union.</p>

<p>It was established, therefore, that there were two distinct parties
in that particular section.  The Miamis and Shawanoes were natural
allies, and there could be no question that a perfect understanding
existed between those who gave our friends so much concern.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton was debating with himself whether it would be a
safe undertaking for him to withdraw, and, venturing further into
the woods, seek to flank the warriors who had risen so unexpectedly
in his path.  He had already been so delayed that his agreement
with Otto was likely to be disarranged, and it would not do to
stay too long where he had halted.</p>

<p>Before a conclusion was formed, the interview between the couple
ended.  They abruptly ceased talking, and one started north and
the other south.</p>

<p>As they did so Jack learned another significant fact&mdash;they belonged
to different tribes.  The one who went northward looked squarely
in the face of his friend, just before moving out, and, in doing
so, gave the best view of his countenance that the boy had yet
obtained. That view revealed him as a Miami beyond all question.</p>

<p>The other wheeled about and advanced almost in a direct line
toward Jack, who felt that his situation was becoming very delicate
and peculiar.  There could be no mistaking the tribe of that warrior,
who was a splendid' specimen of physical vigor and manhood.  Jack
suspected that he was not only a Shawanoe, but was a chief or
leader.  The hideous paint which was smeared over his repulsive
face, was more elaborate than in the case of the two from whom
the youth effected such a narrow escape.</p>

<p>That which Jack saw confirmed his belief of a perfect understanding
between the different parties.  They probably numbered a dozen
altogether, and had determined to bring the friendly Indian and
two white men to account for the outrage of the young Shawanoe&mdash;for,
brief as was the time mince it had been perpetrated, it was more
than probable that it was known to all.</p>

<p>"I wish that heathen would take it into his head to move some
other way," thought Jack to himself, as he drew his head back,
fearful of being seen.  "If he comes straight on, he'll bump his
forehead against this tree, and, if he turns out, he will pass
so close to the trunk that I've got to be lively if he doesn't
run against me."</p>

<p>Listening intently, he was able to hear the soft footfall of
the warrior upon the leaves, scarcely louder than the faint tipping
of the claw of a small bird.  Had the Shawanoe suspected there
was the slightest need for care, his tread would have been silent.</p>

<p>A few seconds passed when the delicate sound ceased.  What could
it mean?  Did the Indian suspect the truth?  Was he standing motionless,
or was he advancing with that noiseless step which the ear of
the listening Indian himself fails to note?</p>

<p>These were the questions which the young Kentuckian asked, and
which for the time he could not answer.  He shrank close to the
bark of the tree, with his gun clasped and the hammer raised ready
to fire at an instant's notice.   Knowing so well the subtlety
of the red men, it occurred to Jack that his foe perhaps was stealthily
flanking him.  He was moving to one side and the moment he could
gain a shot he would fire.</p>

<p>The suspense became more trying than disaster itself could be,
and Jack determined to end it by learning the precise situation
of the Shawanoe, and what he was likely to attempt to do in the
way of hostilities.</p>
