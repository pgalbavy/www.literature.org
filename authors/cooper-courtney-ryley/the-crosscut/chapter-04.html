<p>Wonderment which got nowhere.  The sheriff's car returned before
Fairchild reached the bottom of the grade, and again stopped to survey
the scene of defeat, while Fairchild once more told his story, deleting
items which, to him, appeared unnecessary for consumption by officers
of the law.  Carefully the sheriff surveyed the winding road before him
and scratched his head.
</p>
<p>"Don't guess it would have made much difference which way he went,"
came ruefully at last, "I never saw a fellow turn loose with so much
speed on a mountain road.  We never could have caught him!"
</p><p>"Dangerous character?"  Fairchild hardly knew why he asked the
question.  The sheriff smiled grimly.
</p><p>"If it was the fellow we were after, he was plenty dangerous.  We were
trailing him on word from Denver--described the car and said he 'd
pulled a daylight hold-up on a pay-wagon for the Smelter Company--so
when the car went through Golden, we took up the trail a couple of
blocks behind.  He kept the same speed for a little while until one of
my deputies got a little anxious and took a shot at a tire.  Man, how
he turned on the juice!  I thought that thing was a jack rabbit the way
it went up the hill!  We never had a chance after that!"
</p><p>"And you 're sure it was the same person?"
</p><p>The sheriff toyed with the gear shift.
</p><p>"You never can be sure about nothing in this business," came finally.
"But there 's this to think about: if that fellow was n't guilty of
something, why did he run?"
</p><p>"It might have been a kid in a stolen machine," came from the back seat.
</p><p>"If it was, we 've got to wait until we get a report on it.  I guess
it's us back to the office."
</p><p>The automobile went its way then, and Fairchild his, still wondering;
the sheriff's question, with a different gender, recurring again and
again:
</p><p>"If she was n't guilty of something, why did she run?"
</p><p>And why had she?  More, why had she been willing to give ten dollars in
payment for the mere changing of a tire?  And why had she not offered
some explanation of it all?  It was a problem which almost wiped out
for Robert Fairchild the zest of the new life into which he was going,
the great gamble he was about to take.  And so thoroughly did it
engross him that it was not until a truck had come to a full stop
behind him, and a driver mingled a shout with the tooting of his horn,
that he turned to allow its passage.
</p><p>"Did n't hear you, old man," he apologized.  "Could you give a fellow a
lift?"
</p><p>"Guess so."  It was friendly, even though a bit disgruntled; "hop on."
</p><p>And Fairchild hopped, once more to sit on the tailboard, swinging his
legs, but this time his eyes saw the ever-changing scenery without
noticing it.  In spite of himself, Fairchild found himself constantly
staring at a vision of a pretty girl in a riding habit, with dark-brown
hair straying about equally dark-brown eyes, almost frenzied in her
efforts to change a tire in time to elude a pursuing sheriff.  Some
way, it all did n't blend.  Pretty girls, no doubt, could commit
infractions of the law just as easily as ones less gifted with good
looks.  Yet if this particular pretty girl had held up a pay wagon, why
did n't the telephoned notice from Denver state the fact, instead of
referring to her as a man?  And if she had n't committed some sort of
depredation against the law, why on earth was she willing to part with
ten dollars, merely to save a few moments in changing a tire and thus
elude a sheriff?  If there had been nothing wrong, could not a moment
of explanation have satisfied any one of the fact?  Anyway, were n't
the officers looking for a man instead of for a woman?  And yet:
</p><p>"If she was n't guilty of something, why did she run?"
</p><p>It was too much for any one, and Fairchild knew it.  Yet he clung
grimly to the mystery as the truck clattered on, mile after mile, while
the broad road led along the sides of the hills, finally to dip
downward and run beside the bubbling Clear Creek,--clear no longer in
the memory of the oldest inhabitant; but soiled by the silica from ore
deposits that, churned and rechurned, gave to the stream a whitish,
almost milk-like character, as it twisted in and out of the tortuous
cañon on its turbulent journey to the sea.  But Fairchild failed to
notice either that or the fact that ancient, age-whitened water wheels
had begun to appear here and there, where gulch miners, seekers after
gold in the silt of the creek's bed, had abandoned them years before;
that now and then upon the hills showed the gaunt scars of mine
openings,--reminders of dreams of a day long past; or even the more
important fact that in the distance, softened by the mellowing rays of
a dying sun, a small town gradually was coming into view.  A mile more,
then the truck stopped with a jerk.
</p><p>"Where you bound for, pardner?"
</p><p>Fairchild turned absently, then grinned in embarrassment.
</p><p>"Ohadi."
</p><p>"That's it, straight ahead.  I turn off here.  Stranger?"
</p><p>"Yep."
</p><p>"Miner?"
</p><p>Fairchild shrugged his shoulders and nodded noncommittally.  The truck
driver toyed with his wheel.
</p><p>"Just thought I 'd ask.  Plenty of work around here for single and
double jackers.  Things are beginning to look up a bit--at least in
silver.  Gold mines ain't doing much yet--but there 's a good deal
happening with the white stuff."
</p><p>"Thanks.  Do you know a good place to stop?"
</p><p>"Yeh.  Mother Howard's Boarding House.  Everybody goes there, sooner or
later.  You 'll see it on the left-hand side of the street before you
get to the main block.  Good old girl; knows how to treat anybody in
the mining game from operators on down.  She was here when mining was
mining!"
</p><p>Which was enough recommendation for Mother Howard.  Fairchild lifted
his bag from the rear of the vehicle, waved a farewell to the driver
and started into the village.  And then--for once--the vision of the
girl departed, momentarily, to give place to other thoughts, other
pictures, of a day long gone.
</p><p>The sun was slanting low, throwing deep shadows from the hills into the
little valley with its chattering, milk-white stream, softening the
scars of the mountains with their great refuse dumps; reminders of
hopes of twenty years before and as bare of vegetation as in the days
when the pick and gad and drill of the prospector tore the rock loose
from its hiding place under the surface of the ground.  Nature, in the
mountainous country, resents any outrage against her dignity; the scars
never heal; the mine dumps of a score of years ago remain the same,
without a single shrub or weed or blade of grass growing in the big
heaps of rocky refuse to shield them.
</p><p>But now it was all softened and aglow with sunset.  The deep red
buildings of the Argonaut tunnel--a great, criss-crossing hole through
the hills that once connected with more than thirty mines and their
feverish activities--were denuded of their rust and lack of repair.
The steam from the air-compressing engine, furnishing the necessary
motive power for the drills that still worked in the hills, curled
upward in billowy, rainbow-like coloring.  The scrub pines of the
almost barren mountains took on a fluffier, softer tone; the jutting
rocks melted away into their own shadows, it was a picture of peace and
of memories.
</p><p>And it had been here that Thornton Fairchild, back in the nineties, had
dreamed his dreams and fought his fight.  It had been here--somewhere
in one of the innumerable cañons that led away from the little town on
every side--that Thornton Fairchild had followed the direction of
"float ore" to its resting place, to pursue the vagrant vein through
the hills, to find it at last, to gloat over it in his letters to
Beamish and then to--what?
</p><p>A sudden cramping caught the son's heart, and it pounded with something
akin to fear.  The old foreboding of his father's letter had come upon
him, the mysterious thread of that elusive, intangible Thing, great
enough to break the will and resistance of a strong man and turn him
into a weakling--silent, white-haired--sitting by a window, waiting for
death.  What had it been?  Why had it come upon his father?  How could
it be fought?  All so suddenly, Robert Fairchild had realized that he
was in the country of the invisible enemy, there to struggle against it
without the slightest knowledge of what it was or how it could be
combated.  His forehead felt suddenly damp and cold.  He brushed away
the beady perspiration with a gesture almost of anger, then with a look
of relief, turned in at a small white gate toward a big, rambling
building which proclaimed itself, by the sign on the door, to be Mother
Howard's Boarding House.
</p><p>A moment of waiting, then he faced a gray-haired, kindly faced woman,
who stared at him with wide-open eyes as she stood, hands on hips,
before him.
</p><p>"Don't you tell me I don't know you!" she burst forth at last.
</p><p>"I 'm afraid you don't."
</p><p>"Don't I?" Mother Howard cocked her head.  "If you ain't a Fairchild, I
'll never feed another miner corned beef and cabbage as long as I live.
Ain't you now?" she persisted, "ain't you a Fairchild?"
</p><p>The man laughed in spite of himself.  "You guessed it."
</p><p>"You 're Thornton Fairchild's boy!"  She had reached out for his
handbag, and then, bustling about him, drew him into the big "parlor"
with its old-fashioned, plush-covered chairs, its picture album, its
glass-covered statuary on the old, onyx mantel.  "Did n't I know you
the minute I saw you?  Land, you're the picture of your dad!  Sakes
alive, how is he?"
</p><p>There was a moment of silence.  Fairchild found himself suddenly
halting and boyish as he stood before her.
</p><p>"He 's--he 's gone, Mrs. Howard."
</p><p>"Dead?"  She put up both hands.  "It don't seem possible.  And me
remembering him looking just like you, full of life and strong and--"
</p><p>"Our pictures of him are a good deal different.  I--I guess you knew
him when everything was all right for him.  Things were different after
he got home again."
</p><p>Mother Howard looked quickly about her, then with a swift motion closed
the door.
</p><p>"Son," she asked in a low voice, "did n't he ever get over it?"
</p><p>"It?"  Fairchild felt that he stood on the threshold of discoveries.
"What do you mean?"
</p><p>"Didn't he ever tell you anything, Son?"
</p><p>"No.  I--"
</p><p>"Well, there was n't any need to."  But Mother Howard's sudden
embarrassment, her change of color, told Fairchild it was n't the
truth.  "He just had a little bad luck out here, that was all.
His--his mine pinched out just when he thought he 'd struck it rich--or
something like that."
</p><p>"Are you sure that is the truth?"
</p><p>For a second they faced each other, Robert Fairchild serious and
intent, Mother Howard looking at him with eyes defiant, yet
compassionate.  Suddenly they twinkled, the lips broke from their
straight line into a smile, and a kindly old hand reached out to take
him by the arm.
</p><p>"Don't you stand there and try to tell Mother Howard she don't know
what she 's talking about!" came in tones of mock severity.  "Hear me?
Now, you get up them steps and wash up for dinner.  Take the first room
on the right.  It's a nice, cheery place.  And get that dust and grime
off of you.  The dinner bell will ring in about fifteen minutes, and
they 's always a rush for the food.  So hurry!"
</p><p>In his room, Fairchild tried not to think.  His brain was becoming too
crammed with queries, with strange happenings and with the aggravating
mysticisms of the life into which his father's death had thrown him to
permit clearness of vision.  Even in Mother Howard, he had not been
able to escape it; she told all too plainly, both by her actions and
her words, that she knew something of the mystery of the past,--and had
falsified to keep the knowledge from him.
</p><p>It was too galling for thought.  Robert Fairchild hastily made his
toilet, then answered the ringing of the dinner bell, to be introduced
to strong-shouldered men who gathered about the long tables;
Cornishmen, who talked an "h-less" language, ruddy-faced Americans, and
a sprinkling of English, all of whom conversed about things which were
to Fairchild as so much Greek,--of "levels" and "stopes" and "winzes",
of "skips" and "manways" and "raises", which meant nothing to the man
who yet must master them all, if he were to follow his ambition.  Some
ate with their knives, meeting the food halfway from their plates; some
acted and spoke in a manner revealing a college education and the poise
that it gives.  But all were as one, all talking together; the operator
no more enthusiastic than the man whose sole recompense was the five
dollars a day he received for drilling powder holes; all happy, all
optimistic, all engrossed in the hopes and dreams that only mining can
give.  And among them Mother Howard moved, getting the latest gossip
from each, giving her views on every problem and incidentally seeing
that the plates were filled to the satisfaction of even the hungriest.
</p><p>As for Robert Fairchild, he spoke but seldom, except to acknowledge the
introductions as Mother Howard made him known to each of his table
mates.  But it was not aloofness; it was the fact that these men were
talking of things which Fairchild longed to know, but failed, for the
moment, to master.  From the first, the newcomer had liked the men
about him, liked the ruggedness, the mingling of culture with the lack
of it, liked the enthusiasm, the muscle and brawn, liked them all,--all
but two.
</p><p>Instinctively, from the first mention of his name, he felt they were
watching him, two men who sat far in the rear of the big dining room,
older than the other occupants, far less inviting in appearance.  One
was small, though chunky in build, with sandy hair and eyebrows; with
weak, filmy blue eyes over which the lids blinked constantly.  The
other, black-haired with streaks of gray, powerful in his build, and
with a walrus-like mustache drooping over hard lips, was the sort of
antithesis naturally to be found in the company of the smaller, sandy
complexioned man.  Who they were, what they were, Fairchild did not
know, except from the general attributes which told that they too
followed the great gamble of mining.  But one thing was certain; they
watched him throughout the meal; they talked about him in low tones and
ceased when Mother Howard came near; they seemed to recognize in him
some one who brought both curiosity and innate enmity to the surface.
And more; long before the rest had finished their meal, they rose and
left the room, intent, apparently, upon some important mission.
</p><p>After that, Fairchild ate with less of a relish.  In his mind was the
certainty that these two men knew him--or at least knew about him--and
that they did not relish his presence.  Nor were his suspicions long in
being fulfilled.  Hardly had he reached the hall, when the beckoning
eyes of Mother Howard signaled to him.  Instinctively he waited for the
other diners to pass him, then looked eagerly toward Mother Howard as
she once more approached.
</p><p>"I don't know what you 're doing here," came shortly, "but I want to."
</p><p>Fairchild straightened.  "There is n't much to tell you," he answered
quietly.  "My father left me the Blue Poppy mine in his will.  I 'm
here to work it."
</p><p>"Know anything about mining?"
</p><p>"Not a thing."
</p><p>"Or the people you 're liable to have to buck up against?"
</p><p>"Very little."
</p><p>"Then, Son," and Mother Howard laid a kindly hand on his arm, "whatever
you do, keep your plans to yourself and don't talk too much.  And
what's more, if you happen to get into communication with Blindeye
Bozeman and Taylor Bill, lie your head off.  Maybe you saw 'em, a
sandy-haired fellow and a big man with a black mustache, sitting at the
back of the room?"  Fairchild nodded.  "Well, stay away from them.
They belong to 'Squint' Rodaine.  Know him?"
</p><p>She shot the question sharply.  Again Fairchild nodded.
</p><p>"I 've heard the name.  Who is he?"
</p><p>A voice called to Mother Howard from the dining room.  She turned away,
then leaned close to Robert Fairchild.  "He 's a miner, and he 's
always been a miner.  Right now, he 's mixed up with some of the
biggest people in town.  He 's always been a man to be afraid of--and
he was your father's worst enemy!"
</p><p>Then, leaving Fairchild staring after her, she moved on to her duties
in the kitchen.
