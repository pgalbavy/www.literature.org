<p>She continued to be thoughtful until after lunch, when, upon
the sun's disappearance behind a fat cloud, Jane and the heavens
exchanged dispositions for the time&mdash;the heavens darkened and
Jane brightened. She was in the front hall, when the sunshine
departed rather abruptly, and she jumped for joy, pointing to
the open door. "Look! Looky there!" she called to her brother.
Richly ornamented, he was descending the front stairs, his embellishments
including freshly pressed white trousers, a new straw hat, unusual
shoes, and a blasphemous tie. "I'm goin' to get to sail my boat,"
Jane shouted. "It's goin' to rain."</p>

<p>"It is not," said William, irritated. "It's not going to anything
like rain. I s'pose you think it ought to rain just to let you
sail that chunk of wood!"</p>

<p>"It's goin' to rain&mdash;it's goin' to rain!" (Jane made a little
singsong chant of it.) "It's goin' to rain&mdash;it gives Willie a
pain&mdash;it's goin' to rain&mdash;it gives Willie a pain&mdash;it's goin' to&mdash;"</p>

<p>He interrupted her sternly. "Look here! You're old enough to
know better. I s'pose you think there isn't anything as important
in the world as your gettin' the chance to sail that little boat!
I s'pose you think business and everything else has got to stop
and get ruined, maybe, just to please you!" As he spoke he walked
to an umbrella-stand in the hall and deliberately took therefrom
a bamboo walking-stick of his father's. Indeed, his denunciation
of Jane's selfishness about the weather was made partly to reassure
himself and settle his nerves, strained by the unusual procedure
he contemplated, and partly to divert Jane's attention. In the
latter effort he was unsuccessful; her eyes became strange and
unbearable.</p>

<p>She uttered a shriek:</p>

<p>"Willie's goin' to carry a <em>CANE</em>!"</p>

<p>"You hush up!" he said, fiercely, and hurried out through the
front door. She followed him to the edge of the porch; she stood
there while he made his way to the gate, and she continued to
stand there as he went down the street, trying to swing the cane
in an accustomed and unembarrassed manner.</p>

<p>Jane made this difficult.</p>

<p>"Willie's got a <em>CANE!" </em>she screamed. "He's got papa's
<em>CANE!"  </em>Then, resuming her little chant, she began to
sing: "It's goin' to rain&mdash;Willie's got papa's cane&mdash;it's goin'
to rain &mdash;Willie's got papa's cane!" She put all of her voice
into a final effort. "<em>MISS PRATT'LL GET WET IF YOU DON'T TAKE
AN UMBERELLER-R-R</em>!"</p>

<p>The attention of several chance pedestrians had been attracted,
and the burning William, breaking into an agonized half-trot,
disappeared round the corner. Then Jane retired within the house,
feeling that she had done her duty. It would be his own fault
if he got wet.</p>

<p>Rain was coming. Rain was in the feel of the air&mdash;and in Jane's
hope.</p>

<p>She was not disappointed. Mr. Genesis, so secure of fair weather
in the morning, was proved by the afternoon to be a bad prophet.
The fat cloud was succeeded by others, fatter; a corpulent army
assailed the vault of heaven, heavy outriders before a giant of
evil complexion and devastating temper.</p>

<p>An hour after William had left the house, the dust in the streets
and all loose paper and rubbish outdoors rose suddenly to a considerable
height and started for somewhere else. The trees had colic; everything
became as dark as winter twilight; streaks of wildfire ran miles
in a second, and somebody seemed to be ripping up sheets of copper
and tin the size of farms. The rain came with a swish, then with
a rattle, and then with a roar, while people listened at their
garret doorways and marveled. Window-panes turned to running water;&mdash;it
poured.</p>

<p>Then it relented, dribbled, shook down a few last drops; and
passed on to the countryside. Windows went up; eaves and full
gutters plashed and gurgled; clearer light fell; then, in a moment,
sunshine rushed upon shining green trees and green grass; doors
opened&mdash;and out came the children!</p>

<p>Shouting, they ran to the flooded gutters. Here were rivers,
lakes, and oceans for navigation; easy pilotage, for the steersman
had but to wade beside his craft and guide it with a twig. Jane's
timely boat was one of the first to reach the water.</p>

<p>Her mother had been kind, and Jane, with shoes and stockings
left behind her on the porch, was a happy sailor as she waded
knee-deep along the brimming curbstones. At the corner below the
house of the Baxters, the street was flooded clear across, and
Jane's boat, following the current, proceeded gallantly onward
here, sailed down the next block, and was thoughtlessly entering
a sewer when she snatched it out of the water. Looking about her,
she perceived a gutter which seemed even lovelier than the one
she had followed. It was deeper and broader and perhaps a little
browner, wherefore she launched her ship upon its dimpled bosom
and explored it as far as the next sewer-hole or portage. Thus
the voyage continued for several blocks with only one accident&mdash;which
might have happened to anybody. It was an accident in the nature
of a fall, caused by the sliding of Jane's left foot on some slippery
mud. This treacherous substance, covered with water, could not
have been anticipated; consequently Jane's emotions were those
of indignation rather than of culpability. Upon rising, she debated
whether or not she should return to her dwelling, inclining to
the opinion that the authorities there would have taken the affirmative;
but as she was wet not much above the waist, and the guilt lay
all upon the mud, she decided that such an interruption of her
journey would be a gross injustice to herself. Navigation was
reopened.</p>

<p>Presently the boat wandered into a miniature whirlpool, grooved
in a spiral and pleasant to see. Slowly the water went round and
round, and so did the boat without any assistance from Jane. Watching
this movement thoughtfully, she brought forth from her drenched
pocket some sodden whitish disks, recognizable as having been
crackers, and began to eat them. Thus absorbed, she failed at
first to notice the approach of two young people along the sidewalk.</p>

<p>They were the entranced William and Miss Pratt; and their appearance
offered a suggestive contrast in relative humidity. In charming
and tender-colored fabrics, fluffy and cool and summery, she was
specklessly dry; not a drop had touched even the little pink parasol
over her shoulder, not one had fallen upon the tiny white doglet
drowsing upon her arm. But William was wet&mdash;he was still more
than merely damp, though they had evidently walked some distance
since the rain had ceased to fall. His new hat was a mucilaginous
ruin; his dank coat sagged; his shapeless trousers flopped heavily,
and his shoes gave forth marshy sounds as he walked.</p>

<p>No brilliant analyst was needed to diagnose this case. Surely
any observer must have said: "Here is a dry young lady, and at
her side walks a wet young gentleman who carries an umbrella in
one hand and a walking-stick in the other. Obviously the young
lady and gentleman were out for a stroll for which the stick was
sufficient, and they were caught by the rain. Before any fell,
however, he found her a place of shelter&mdash;such as a corner drug-store
and then himself gallantly went forth into the storm for an umbrella.
He went to the young lady's house, or to the house where she may
be visiting, for, if he had gone to his own he would have left
his stick. It may be, too, that at his own, his mother would have
detained him, since he is still at the age when it is just possible
sometimes for mothers to get their sons into the house when it
rains. He returned with the umbrella to the corner drug-store
at probably about the time when the rain ceased to fall, because
his extreme moistness makes necessary the deduction that he was
out in all the rain that rained. But he does not seem to care."</p>

<p>The fact was that William did not even know that he was wet.
With his head sidewise and his entranced eyes continuously upon
the pretty face so near, his state was almost somnambulistic.
Not conscious of his soggy garments or of the deluged streets,
he floated upon a rosy cloud, incense about him, far-away music
enchanting his ears.</p>

<p>If Jane had not recognized the modeling of his features she might
not have known them to be William's, for they had altered their
grouping to produce an expression with which she was totally unfamiliar.
To be explicit, she was unfamiliar with this expression in that
place&mdash;that is to say, upon William, though she had seen something
like it upon other people, once or twice, in church.</p>

<p>William's thoughts might have seemed to her as queer as his expression,
could she have known them. They were not very definite, however,
taking the form of sweet, vague pictures of the future. These
pictures were of married life; that is, married life as William
conceived it for himself and Miss Pratt&mdash;something strikingly
different from that he had observed as led by his mother and father,
or their friends and relatives. In his rapt mind he beheld Miss
Pratt walking beside him "through life," with her little parasol
and her little dog&mdash;her exquisite face always lifted playfully
toward his own (with admiration underneath the playfulness), and
he heard her voice of silver always rippling "baby-talk" throughout
all the years to come. He saw her applauding his triumphs&mdash;though
these remained indefinite in his mind, and he was unable to foreshadow
the business or profession which was to provide the amazing mansion
(mainly conservatory) which he pictured as their home. Surrounded
by flowers, and maintaining a private orchestra, he saw Miss Pratt
and himself growing old together, attaining to such ages as thirty
and even thirty-five, still in perfect harmony, and always either
dancing in the evenings or strolling hand in hand in the moonlight.
Sometimes they would visit the nursery, where curly-headed, rosy
cherubs played upon a white-bear rug in the firelight. These were
all boys and ready-made, the youngest being three years old and
without a past.</p>

<p>They would be beautiful children, happy with their luxurious
toys on the bear rug, and they would <em>NEVER </em>be seen in
any part of the house except the nursery. Their deportment would
be flawless, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>WILL-EE</em>!"</p>

<p>The aviator struck a hole in the air; his heart misgave him.
Then he came to earth&mdash;a sickening drop, and instantaneous.</p>

<p>"<em>WILL-EE</em>!"</p>

<p>There was Jane, a figurine in a plastic state and altogether
disgraceful;&mdash;she came up out of the waters and stood before them
with feet of clay, indeed; pedestaled upon the curbstone.</p>

<p>"Who IS that <em>CURIOUS </em>child?" said Miss Pratt, stopping.</p>

<p>William shuddered.</p>

<p>"Was she calling <em>YOU?" </em>Miss Pratt asked, incredulously.</p>

<p>"Willie, I told you you better take an umbereller," said Jane,
"instead of papa's cane." And she added, triumphantly, "Now you
see!"</p>

<p>Moving forward, she seemed to have in mind a dreadful purpose;
there was something about her that made William think she intended
casually to accompany him and Miss Pratt.</p>

<p>"You go home!" he commanded, hoarsely.</p>

<p>Miss Pratt uttered a little scream of surprise and recognition.
"It's your little sister!" she exclaimed, and then, reverting
to her favorite playfulness of enunciation, "'Oor ickle sissa!"
she added, gaily, as a translation. Jane misunderstood it; she
thought Miss Pratt meant "<em>OUR </em>little sister."</p>

<p>"Go home!" said William.</p>

<p>"No'ty, no'ty!" said Miss Pratt, shaking her head. "Me 'fraid
oo's a no'ty, no'ty ickle dirl! All datie!"</p>

<p>Jane advanced. "I wish you'd let me carry Flopit for you," she
said.</p>

<p>Giving forth another gentle scream, Miss Pratt hopped prettily
backward from Jane's extended hands. "Oo-oo!" she cried, chidingly.
"Mustn't touch! P'eshus Flopit all soap-water-wash clean. Ickle
dirly all muddy-nassy! Ickle dirly must doe home, det all soap-water-wash
clean like <em>NICE </em>ickle sissa. Evabody will love 'oor ickle
sissa den," she concluded, turning to William. "Tell 'oor ickle
sissa <em>MUS' </em>doe home det soap-water-wash!"</p>

<p>Jane stared at Miss Pratt with fixed solemnity during the delivery
of these admonitions, and it was to be seen that they made an
impression upon her. Her mouth slowly opened, but she spake not.
An extraordinary idea had just begun to make itself at home in
her mind. It was an idea which had been hovering in the neighborhood
of that domain ever since William's comments upon the conversation
of Mr. Genesis, in the morning.</p>

<p>"Go home!" repeated William, and then, as Jane stood motionless
and inarticulate, transfixed by her idea, he said, almost brokenly,
to his dainty companion, "I <em>DON'T </em>know what you'll think
of my mother! To let this child&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Pratt laughed comfortingly as they started on again. "Isn't
mamma's fault, foolish boy Baxter. Ickle dirlies will det datie!"</p>

<p>The profoundly mortified William glanced back over his shoulder,
bestowing upon Jane a look in which bitterness was mingled with
apprehension. But she remained where she was, and did not follow.
That was a little to be thankful for, and he found some additional
consolation in believing that Miss Pratt had not caught the frightful
words, "papa's cane," at the beginning of the interview. He was
encouraged to this belief by her presently taking from his hand
the decoration in question and examining it with tokens of pleasure.
"'Oor pitty walk'-'tick," she called it, with a tact he failed
to suspect. And so he began to float upward again; glamors enveloped
him and the earth fell away.</p>

<p>He was alone in space with Miss Pratt once more.</p>
