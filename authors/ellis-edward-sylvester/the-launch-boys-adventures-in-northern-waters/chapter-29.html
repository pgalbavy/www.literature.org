<p>Detective Stockham Calvert was quick to make deductions and as
quick in adapting himself to circumstances. He had said he did
not expect to have the help of Orestes Noxon&mdash;as we must continue
to call him&mdash;in capturing the two criminals, but ten minutes later
he made a radical change of plans. He meant to make use of the
young man, in his pursuit of the post office robbers.</p>

<p>"We must leave here at once," he announced in his crisp manner.
"Searching parties are out and some of them are likely to call
here at any time. Since Noxon worked with his face masked, except
when the slip occurred last night, it is not likely, he would
be recognized by any of those who are looking for him. But there
is a risk which we must avoid."</p>

<p>Mrs. McCaffry made strong objection to their leaving before the
dinner hour, but the officer assured her it could not be helped.
He and Noxon compelled her to accept liberal tips, but she refused
to take the last remaining quarter of Mike.</p>

<p>"The same would bring me bad luck," she said, with a shake of
her head.</p>

<p>"How could it do that whin it brought me the bist of luck, being
I came to your door?" asked the youth, trying to press it upon
her; but she would not consent.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, "it's mesilf that's of no more account than a
naught wid no circle round it."</p>

<p>Instead of following the path that led to the highway and so
on to Beartown, Calvert turned into the woods through which his
companions had made their way to the humble but hospitable home.</p>

<p>"We'll keep clear of the village," he explained, "for every one
there is in a fever of excitement, and although I can do my part
in the way of prevarication, I don't wish to be driven to the
limit, when it might not, after all, avert trouble."</p>

<p>The fogs which often plague the coast of Maine and vicinity have
a habit of sometimes leaving as suddenly as they come. It was
a great relief to the party when they dived in among the pines
and firs to find that the gloomy dampness had lifted and the sun
was again shining from a clear sky. It impressed all as a good
omen.</p>

<p>Noxon's rest and care for his injured leg had been of great benefit.
The rising inflammation had gone and the pain was trifling. If
they did not walk fast, he was sure it would give him no anxiety.</p>

<p>Calvert took the lead, with Noxon next and Mike Murphy at the
rear. The last was highly pleased to see his young friend walk
without a perceptible limp.</p>

<p>The leader kept his bearings so well that when within an hour
he reached the shore of the Back River, it was at the spot he
had in mind. There was the runabout in which he and Warner Hagan
had come from Wiscasset, and the owner was calmly smoking his
brier wood pipe, content to wait indefinitely when he was well
paid for so doing. He lay a few rods south of the landing, and
just below him was the <em>Water Witch</em>, with Alvin Landon
and Chester Haynes on board, wondering what in the world had become
of Mike Murphy. The youths had tried to open communication with
the master of the runabout, but he had been warned by his two
passengers to tell nothing to anyone, and he glumly refused to
talk. Chester had set out in quest of the missing Mike, going
as far as the village. All he could learn there was that his friend
had left a good while before and no one knew anything of him.
The second mate went back to his Captain, and the two were so
impatient that they were half inclined to leave without him, when
lo! he appeared with Calvert and Noxon, coming from among the
trees as if he had been absent only a few minutes.</p>

<p>Then followed full explanations, and you can imagine the astonishment
of Alvin and Chester. They were sure of the identity of Noxon
when he first appeared, but were considerate and said never a
word that could hurt his feelings.</p>

<p>"You ran away with their launch," added Calvert. "They ran away
with yours, and you and they met as you were coming back. But
for the fog you would have seen each other, for you must have
passed quite close. The beauty of it is," said the officer, with
a flash of his keen eyes, "that while they have gone far away
we know exactly where. My friend Hagan and I, with Noxon as our
guide, are going to scoop them in."</p>

<p>He thought it best not to affect too much mystery.</p>

<p>"They passed down Montsweag Bay clear to Knubble, through Goose
Rock Passage into the Sheepscot, and up that to the Beautiful
Isle of Somewhere. Most folks don't know the exact location of
that sweet spot, but we know&mdash;thanks to Noxon&mdash;the latitude and
longitude of ours, which the same is the port we are heading for."</p>

<p>The plan was simple. Noxon, who was familiar with the running
of the <em>Water Witch</em>, was to act as engineer and steersman.
Calvert and Hagan would be the only passengers, and the prize
would be Kit Woodford and Graff Miller.</p>

<p>"And phwat's to become of us?" asked Mike.</p>

<p>"That depends upon how you behave yourself. If you grow tired
of waiting, take a walk up to Beartown, have dinner with Mrs.
Friestone and then come back and wait for a few days and nights
till you see us again."</p>

<p>"That's aisy, as I told me taicher whin she asked me how much
two and two made and I informed her the same was five."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Hagan isn't here," reminded Chester.</p>

<p>"He will be very soon. Meanwhile, I'll say a word to my man."</p>

<p>He walked to the runabout, where he told its owner he might return
to Wiscasset as he was not needed further. He added a dollar to
the price agreed upon and the man bade him good-by. Hagan, who
had gone off on what might be called a reconnaissance, justified
the faith of his partner, for he came forward, and thus the party
was complete.</p>

<p>The distance was shorter by way of the Narrows and down the Sheepscot
than by the route just named. Accordingly, the <em>Water Witch</em>
headed north, while the <em>Deerfoot</em> it will be remembered
went south. The difference was not much, the real reason why the
course was taken being of another nature. If the <em>Water Witch</em>
had set out to search for the other boat, with no knowledge of
its destination, it would have prowled to the southward, inspecting
all likely hiding places on the way, with a strong chance that
she herself would be detected and her purpose read before she
discovered the fugitive. By taking the northern route this handicap
would be avoided. They could make much better progress and not
be seen until it was too late for the criminals to escape.</p>

<p>Thus Alvin Landon, Chester Haynes and Mike Murphy were left on
the shore of the Back River, near Beartown landing, without any
launch and compelled to pass the time as best they could. They
decided to spend a few hours in the village.</p>

<p>They appreciated the reason why Calvert would not have their
company. He was plunging into a venture where deadly weapons were
likely to be used, and their lives would be endangered. The affair
was really none of theirs. Besides, their presence would be a
serious handicap and might prove fatal to success.</p>

<p>The <em>Water Witch</em> soon shot past Cushman Point, passing
the runabout so close that the officers exchanged salutations
with the man who had brought them from Wiscasset. Calvert and
Hagan sat side by side, both puffing heavy black cigars, the smoke
of which as it streamed astern might have suggested that the launch
was impelled by steam instead of gasoline. She ran smoothly, and
Noxon, with a pale face, his hands grasping the wheel, steered
as skilfully as Alvin Landon had directed the swifter <em>Deerfoot</em>.
He had done it many times and had no fear. The young man had come
to the parting of the ways, and nothing could turn him back. His
resolution was due to the wound, which had distressed him so much
when he hobbled to the home of Mrs. McCaffry that he believed
for a time he was near the end of life, and when one reaches <em>that</em>
point he is sure to do some serious thinking.</p>

<p>Just above Clough Point, marking the northern extremity of the
large island of Westport, the <em>Water Witch</em> turned eastward
through the Narrows and headed straight south down the Sheepscot
River to its destination some ten miles away. Noxon seated with
his hands upon the wheel remained silent. The officers spoke to
each other now and then in low tones, but most of the time left
him to his meditations. He held the boat to moderate speed, for
there was no call for haste. She was running easily, but a glance
by the young man into the gasoline tank showed the supply was
low, and he wished to avoid stopping at any of the landings to
renew it. Besides, high speed is always a strain upon an engine,
and he was nervously anxious to prevent a breakdown at a critical
point in the enterprise. His familiarity with the launch made
him cautious.</p>

<p>While Calvert and Hagan were following a clearly defined plan,
they knew "there's many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip." They
had high hopes of finding the other boat at the spot which Calvert
had facetiously named the Beautiful Isle of Somewhere, but it
might well happen that they would be disappointed. At the first
sign of danger the <em>Deerfoot</em> would run away and her superior
fleetness would leave her pursuers hopelessly behind. Above all,
it was important that the criminals should not discover their
peril in time to get away.</p>

<p>"Noxon," said Calvert, leaning forward, "let us know when we
are near the cove."</p>

<p>"We are within less than a mile of it now. It is just ahead on
the right."</p>

<p>Each officer flung his stump of a cigar overboard and slipped
from his chair to the bottom of the boat. Inasmuch as their interest
was centred on one side of the boat, they crowded each other a
little. They removed their headgear and permitted only their crowns
to show a few inches above the rail as they peered over. They
held themselves ready at the same time to duck into complete invisibility.</p>

<p>"The cove is in sight," announced Noxon, slightly turning his
head. "Better keep down."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they felt the change in the course of the
launch. They were entering the inlet and the officers raised their
heads barely enough to peer alongside of the steersman, over the
front and beyond the flagstaff with its fluttering bunting.</p>

<p>"There it is!" whispered Calvert to his friend.</p>

<p>"I see it," said the other, "the Beautiful Isle of Somewhere;
we are closer to it than I supposed."</p>
