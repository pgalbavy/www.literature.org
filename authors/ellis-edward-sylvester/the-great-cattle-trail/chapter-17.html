<p>Captain Shirril was never so outwitted in all his life. With
never a suspicion that the Comanche, dashing over the roof, had
any other purpose than to assail him, he was holding his revolver
pointed, reflecting at the same time on the blind folly of the
red man in rushing to his fate, when he dropped through the scuttle
and closed it after him.</p>

<p>With a muttered exclamation of chagrin the Texan leaped to his
feet, reaching the spot in a couple of bounds, and let fly with
two chambers of his weapon. The bullets skimmed over the door,
the inimitable dexterity of the Indian saving him as by a hair's
breadth.</p>

<p>Thus the fellow had entered the cabin after all, by a piece of
strategy as brilliant as it was daring, and the only man who was
a defender of the place found himself shut out and a prisoner,
as may be said, on the roof.</p>

<p>Unwilling to believe the astounding logic of facts, the captain
stooped down and tried to lift the door; but it had been placed
there with the view of being raised only from below. It was impossible
to get anything but the slightest hold upon it, and when he tried
to lift it upward, it could not be moved.</p>

<p>The Comanche was either holding it, or had fastened it in place
by means of the iron hook.</p>

<p>Thinking only of the safety of his wife and servant, the Texan
bent over, and, putting his mouth as close to the edge as he could,
shouted:</p>

<p>"Look out down there, Edna! There's an Indian on the upper floor,
and I am fastened on the roof."</p>

<p>Provided his wife heard the warning, this particular Comanche
was liable, after all, to find that, in undertaking his contract,
he would be unable to deliver the goods. But, if the warning reached
the ears of the women, would they comprehend its significance?
<em>That</em> was the question which must soon be answered.</p>

<p>The meaning of the peculiar strategy of the Comanches was now
fully understood by the victim. With a humiliation beyond description,
he comprehended how he had fallen into the trap that had been
set so cunningly for his feet.</p>

<p>All this trifling at one corner of the roof was intended to hold
his attention, while one of the warriors stealthily climbed over
the eaves at another portion and reached the inside by dropping
through the scuttle.</p>

<p>The plan, simple as it might seem, had worked to perfection.</p>

<p>The moment the captain comprehended that he was shut out as effectually
as the miscreant was shut in, he glared around in quest of others
who might be trying to work his own death by a continuation of
their cunning. Aware, too, of his exposure to their shots, he
quickly sank on his face, with his head nigh enough to the peak
to hold the entire surface under his eye.</p>

<p>It was well he did so; for from the same corner that the successful
Indian had come, he discerned a second climbing over the eaves.
He was doing so with an eagerness that showed he was discounting
his own chances.</p>

<p>"Whether you are bogus or not, here goes!"</p>

<p>The Texan did not rely upon his revolver to serve him in the
crisis, but hastily aiming his Winchester, pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>The Comanche, whose body was half over the roof, threw up his
arms with a wild screech and disappeared backward, as abruptly
as his companion had gone down the scuttle. There could be no
doubt of the success of <em>that</em> shot.</p>

<p>"I would like to have a few more of you try it," muttered the
defender, compressing his lips and glancing right and left. His
blood was up and he was in a desperate mood.</p>

<p>But his own situation was one of extreme peril. The Comanches
must be aware of his singular dilemma, and were not likely to
leave him undisputed master of the situation, at least as long
as he remained on the outside.</p>

<p>That this supposition was right was proven the next minute, when,
from a point several rods distant, a gun was fired and the bullet
skipped over the surface within a few inches of where he was crouching.
A second shot followed still closer, and the captain crept a little
farther from the scuttle.</p>

<p>But for fear of alarming his friends below, he would have uttered
a cry, as if of pain, with a view of convincing the Comanches
that their shots had proven fatal. Then they would be tempted
to send more of their number over the roof, where they would fall
victims to his marksmanship.</p>

<p>It looked as if the assailants were in doubt on this point, for
after the two shots they ceased firing, and everything remained
silent for several minutes.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril, even in his anxiety for himself, could not forget
the inmates of his home. Two women and a fierce warrior were inside,
and matters were sure to become lively there before long.</p>

<p>In the midst of this oppressive stillness, occurred Avon Burnet's
adventure which has been told elsewhere. It was impossible for
the captain to understand what the confusion on the prairie meant,
but he saw that it was a diversion of some kind which, fortunately
for himself, held the attention of his enemies for a while longer.</p>

<p>He felt a vague suspicion that the Indian in the room below would
try to get a shot at him through the scuttle door. He could raise
it for an inch or more, and, provided the white man was in his
line of range, fire with quick and unerring accuracy. It is singular
that he did not do this in the first place, after reaching the
roof, and before the Texan discovered his presence so near him.</p>

<p>Lying extended as flat as before, Captain Shirril placed his
ear close to the door and listened.</p>

<p>Within the first minute he caught a sound, but it was so faint
and indefinite that he could not tell what it meant. It might
have been caused by someone moving about in the room directly
below, but he was inclined to believe that the Comanche was still
near the scuttle and was trying to get his range.</p>

<p>All at once the heart of the Texan gave a start. He was sure
the door was pushed upward the slightest possible distance. It
looked as if the Comanche was endeavoring to do the very thing
suspected&mdash;that is, he was seeking to gain sight of the white
man in order to give him a stealthy shot.</p>

<p>"If he will but raise that door a single inch," was the exultant
thought of the captain, "I will get my fingers under the edge
and yank it back in spite of all he can do, and just about that
time the band will begin to play."</p>

<p>But would the Indian be rash enough to do this? The first glimpse
through the slightest crevice would tell him that his intended
victim had shifted his position. He would be shrewd enough to
suspect its meaning, and would take care that he did not throw
away the golden opportunity he had so brilliantly won.</p>

<p>Ah, if his wife and Dinah could but learn the exact truth! They
would quickly prove potent factors in the scheme. Their familiarity
with the house would enable them to eliminate that wretch who
just then seemed to be master of the situation.</p>

<p>Yes; the door moved again. The Indian must be beneath, and was
striving to do something with the covering, which at present shielded
him from the vengeance of the white man whom he had foiled.</p>

<p>The latter silently extended his hand to the edge of the door,
hoping that the purchase for which he was waiting was within reach.
He was disappointed. If the structure had been moved, it was to
such a slight extent as to afford no advantage.</p>

<p>He held his hand in the same position, intent on seizing the
chance the instant it presented itself, but the Indian was wonderfully
cunning. It would seem that having introduced himself into the
ranchman's home, he would have been content to follow the purpose
that had taken him thither, without giving more attention to the
white man, whom he had certainly spared for the time, when he
was in his power. The captain could not understand the logic which
appeared to be controlling this warrior from the moment he climbed
over the edge of the roof.</p>
