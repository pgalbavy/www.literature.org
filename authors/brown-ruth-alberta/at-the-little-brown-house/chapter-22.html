<p>"Why, Gail, what are you doing?" asked Faith one cold, dull November
day, as she hurried into the kitchen from her village trip, and
found the older sister picking two plump hens.</p>

<p>"Can't you see?" smiled the girl, glancing up from her task with
an excited, happy sparkle in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see, but what is the occasion? Has Peace made another
raid on the hen-house with poison or rat-traps? I shouldn't suppose
we could afford chicken unless by accident. Thanksgiving is more
than two weeks off."</p>

<p>"What day is tomorrow? Am I the only one who remembers?"</p>

<p>"November tenth&mdash;your birthday! Oh, Gail, it had slipped my mind
for the minute! No wonder you are getting up a celebration if
everyone forgets like that."</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't on account of the birthday, Faith; that just happened.
It's the mortgage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course, I knew it was due soon, but the relief at being able
to get the money made me overlook the exact date, I guess. So
that is the cause of your excitement!"</p>

<p>"Partly, and then we are to have company for dinner, too."</p>

<p>"Who?" demanded Faith, again surprised.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Strong and Glen and Mrs. Grinnell."</p>

<p>"What in the world will we do with them all? Eight is a tight
fit for our dining-room."</p>

<p>"It will crowd us a little, but I have it all planned nicely.
Glen must sit in his daddy's lap&mdash;he often does at home when they
have company and haven't room at the table for his high-chair&mdash;and
of course I will wait on the people, so there will be room for
all."</p>

<p>"Of course you <em>won't</em> wait on the people! What waiting
there is to attend to I shall look after. You are mistress of
this house. Oh, I can't help hugging myself every other minute
to think Mr. Strong was able to get the money for the mortgage
and we won't have to leave this dear little brown house after
all."</p>

<p>"Do you care so much?" asked Gail, with such a curious wistfulness
in her voice that Faith stopped her ecstatic prancing to study
the thin, flushed face.</p>

<p>"I should say I do!" she exclaimed emphatically. "Someway, in
these last six months it has grown ever so much dearer than I
ever dreamed it could. I used to think I hated farm life, and
it fretted me because we couldn't live in Pendennis or Martindale,
and have things like other folks. I did want a piano so much,
instead of a worn-out, wheezy old organ."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you still like all that?" questioned the older girl,
keeping her eyes fixed on the half-picked fowl in her lap, as
if afraid of betraying some delightful secret.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed! But I gave up thinking about such things a
long time ago. The farm is all we have, and there is the mortgage
to pay on that; so I just shut up my high-falutin notions, as
Mrs. Grinnell calls them, and mean to be happy doing my part in
the home. I have wasted too much time already."</p>

<p>"You have done your part splendidly," cried Gail with brimming
eyes, letting the chicken slip unnoticed from her hands as she
threw one arm around Faith's waist; "and now that&mdash;" She bit her
tongue just in time to keep the wonderful secret from tumbling
off, and flushed furiously.</p>

<p>"And now that what?" questioned the other girl, without the faintest
trace of suspicion in her voice.</p>

<p>"Now that this hard year is over, we are going to do a little
celebrating even if we can't afford it," answered Gail, thinking
rapidly. "Will you make a caramel cake for our dinner? Mrs. Grinnell
is so fond of it, and I know it will hit the right spot with the
minister. It was his suggestion that he tell&mdash;" Again she stopped
in confusion.</p>

<p>"About the mortgage money," Faith finished. "Well, he certainly
has earned the right. We have a lot to thank him for. Do you know
who is loaning the money, or is that still a secret from you,
too?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Strong told me, but he wants the privilege of telling
the rest of you, so I promised to keep still."</p>

<p>"Oh!" There was a long pause, during which both girls busied
themselves with the chickens; and then Faith ventured the question,
"Is it Judge Abbott?" Gail smilingly shook her head. "Nor Dr.
Bainbridge?" Again the brown head shook. "Then it is Mrs. Grinnell.
I thought of her in the first place&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are wrong again. All the money she has is tied up in her
farm and in the house in Martindale."</p>

<p>"Is it anyone in town?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Faith was plainly puzzled. "Man or woman?"</p>

<p>"Both," answered Gail after a slight hesitation.</p>

<p>"Do I know them?"</p>

<p>"About as well as I do."</p>

<p>"Where do they live?"</p>

<p>"In Martindale."</p>

<p>"Who can it be?" pondered the girl.</p>

<p>"You might guess all night and never get it right," laughed Gail.
"You better give it up. Tomorrow is time enough for little girls
to know."</p>

<p>"For little girls to know what?" demanded Peace, as the noisy
quartette burst breathlessly in from school.</p>

<p>"What we are to have for dinner tomorrow night," answered Gail,
glancing warningly at Faith.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow night? We have dinner at noon."</p>

<p>"Tomorrow we don't. We'll have lunch at noon and dinner in the
evening."</p>

<p>"Bet there's comp'ny coming!" shouted the smaller girls.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked Hope, almost as much excited.</p>

<p>"The minister and his family, and Mrs. Grinnell."</p>

<p>"What for?" questioned Cherry, for company was rare at the little
brown house.</p>

<p>"Why, to eat up those chickens, of course," answered Peace. "Will
there be enough to go around? Hadn't I better hack the head off
from another?"</p>

<p>"Don't you fret! Mike weighed the hens after he killed them,
and one is a seven-pounder, and the other weighs eight. That surely
ought to be enough to satisfy your appetites."</p>

<p>"Well, I bony a drumstick! There'll be four this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, but suppose we have to wait," suggested Cherry. "The others
may eat them all up."</p>

<p>"Oh, Gail, must we wait?" cried Peace in alarm, suddenly remembering
how tiny the dining-room was.</p>

<p>"No, dear, there will be room for all," answered the mother-sister.
"But I shall expect all of you to be little ladies and not quarrel
over drumsticks or wishbones. One's guests must always be served
first, you know."</p>

<p>"Isn't it too bad," sighed the child pensively, "that we can't
be our own guests sometimes and have just the piece we want?"</p>

<p>"You ought to be thankful to have any part of it," Faith spoke
up. "If company wasn't coming, we shouldn't have killed the hens."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> as thankful as I can be," answered Peace, brightening
visibly. "Cherry, come help me scour the silver. I forgot it last
night, and if comp'ny is coming, we want everything fine. Besides,
the time goes faster when you're busy, and already I can hardly
wait for tomorrow night to come. Seems 's if it never would get
here with those roasted hens."</p>

<p>But in due time the eventful night arrived, and with it the select
company who were to join in the little celebration. With eager,
shining eyes, Peace ushered in the guests, who chanced to come
all together, and as she relieved them of their wraps and led
them into the shabby parlor, she chattered excitedly.</p>

<p>"You don't like drumsticks the best, do you, Mr. Strong? And
neither does Mrs. Grinnell. I heard her say so lots of times.
She likes the wings. I want something that ain't so skinny. That's
why I always choose drumsticks. There are four in this affair&mdash;four
drumsticks, I mean. You didn't think I meant comp'ny, did you?
Each hen had two legs, you know; but there are nine people to
eat, counting Glen, though, of course, he is too little for such
things yet; and the drumsticks won't anywhere near go around,
s'posing every one of you should want one. When we have only one
hen, Cherry and Allee and me always fight over who is to have
the drumsticks. Last time Gail settled it by eating one herself,
and giving the other to Hope. That won't happen today, though,
'cause there is company."</p>

<p>"Aren't you giving away family secrets?" interrupted Mrs. Grinnell,
trying to look severe.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! You already know about it, and the minister ain't s'prised
at anything. I just thought I'd speak about it, 'cause I've bonied
one drumstick myself, if someone else doesn't eat them all up
first. And say, folks, if any of you get a wishbone in your meat,
will you save it for me? Cherry's making a c'lection and has six
already. I haven't but the one I asked Mr. Hartman for, and they
make the cutest penwipers for Christmas. Supper&mdash;dinner is 'most
ready, I guess. Gail made <em>lots</em> of stuffing&mdash;dressing,
I mean. And Faith's cake is just fine, and the custard pies are
the beautifulest she ever made. They are all extra, 'cause you
are here. We don't often get such nice things to eat, but this
is a special 'casion. When supper is over the rest of the girls
will help me do the talking, but now they are every one busy except
Allee and me, and Allee's getting dressed. There's someone at
the door. I hope it ain't more comp'ny. S'posing it is, wouldn't
that be the worst luck,&mdash;the very night we have roast chicken!"</p>

<p>Before Peace could reach the door to see who was there, however,
Mr. Strong swung it wide open, and reaching out into the dusk,
drew in a sweet-faced, motherly, old lady with silvery hair, and
the familiar tall, gray man of the broker's office, exclaiming
in his hearty, boyish fashion, "Mrs. Campbell, Doctor, I am so
glad you have come! I was beginning to fear you had missed the
place."</p>

<p>"Missed the place? Now, Brother Strong, I am insulted,&mdash;after
the number of times I have been here! Good evening, ladies. Mother,
I want you to meet Mrs. Strong and Mrs. Grinnell. Hello, Peace,
where is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you come for dinner?" demanded that young lady, with frigid
dignity, wondering where she had seen that kindly face before,
and secretly wishing they had delayed their coming until a more
convenient time.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have," he answered decidedly, "and I am as hungry as
a bear!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," thought Peace, "there goes a drumstick! Hungry folks
always want them." But though her face lengthened, she did not
voice such sentiments, and started for the kitchen, saying, "I
must tell Gail, so's she'll set you a plate for sup&mdash;dinner. Is
that lady going to stay?"</p>

<p>"That lady is my wife. If you have any fault to find with us
for dropping in unannounced, just scrap it out with Brother Strong,
for he invited us."</p>

<p>"<em>I'm</em> not finding fault," Peace answered haughtily, turning
once more toward the door, "but there's no telling what Faith
will do. I better warn them now."</p>

<p>"And at the same time you might tell Abigail that someone in
the parlor wants to see her," laughed the genial voice.</p>

<p>Peace disappeared through the door like a flash, and they heard
her shrill voice call, "Oh, Gail, Faith, there are some folks
here for supper what weren't invited. Do you s'pose there is hen
enough now? And, oh, yes, he wants to see you right away, Gail!"</p>

<p>The oldest sister paused in the act of lifting the beautifully
browned birds from their nest of dressing, dropped the carving
set, shoved the pan back into the oven, and with flushed cheeks
and glowing eyes, hurried for the parlor with such a buoyant step
that the other sisters followed wonderingly. She paused an instant
in the doorway, smiled at the little company within, and then
straight to the white-haired lady she went, and kissed her, saying
happily, "I have never seen you before, Mrs. Campbell, but I shall
love you dearly."</p>

<p>"Not that, Gail," tenderly answered the stranger, holding the
tall girl close. "Call me Grandma."</p>

<p>"And me Grandpa," added the gray man, drawing Gail out of the
woman's arms and kissing her blushing cheek.</p>

<p>"Now she'll give him a drumstick sure," sighed Peace; "and s'posing
he should ask for four!"</p>

<p>"This is Faith, the baker and my right-hand man," she heard Gail
saying, "and Hope, our sunbeam; Charity, the scholar; and Peace,
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mischief-maker, heart captivator, and worth her weight in gold,"
finished the familiar voice which Peace could not quite place
in her memory. "Kiss me!"</p>

<p>Passively she allowed him to embrace her as he had greeted the
other sisters, and then squirming out of his arms, she backed
into a corner, where she frowned impartially on the excited group,
all talking at once, while she tried to puzzle out how this man
could be "Grandpa" when all her own relatives had long since been
carried away by the angels.</p>

<p>"I'll bet he is a make-believe," she told herself; "and he's
got them all fooled proper. Maybe he wants the farm, seeing old
Skinflint didn't get it. I am going to ask Mrs. Grinnell. She
had sense enough to run when the kissing began."</p>

<p>Peace slipped noiselessly through the nearby door, and fled to
the kitchen, where their kind neighbor was busy dishing up the
forgotten dinner, demanding, "Is he really a grandpa we didn't
know anything about, or is he a make-believe <em>frog</em>?"</p>

<p>"Make-believe frog!" echoed matter-of-fact Mrs. Grinnell. "Do
you mean fraud? Well, he certainly ain't a fraud, Peace Greenfield!
He's a big man. Everyone in the state knows him, pretty near.
He is Dr. Campbell of the University. 'Tisn't every little girl
that can have an adopted &mdash;Peace, I am afraid you and Cherry
will have to wait until the rest are through eating."</p>

<p>"That's where you are mistaken," returned Peace with energy.
"Gail said only last night that there was room for all."</p>

<p>"But she wasn't expecting the Campbells for supper."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, if that ain't always the way! Gail, must I wait?"</p>

<p>Gail had just hurriedly entered the kitchen, fearful lest the
forgotten dinner was spoiled, but seeing the great bowl of gravy
on the table, and Mrs. Grinnell busy mashing the potatoes, she
sighed in relief and stopped to answer, "I am afraid you must,
dear."</p>

<p>"After you said we wouldn't have to?"</p>

<p>"I didn't look for Grandpa and Grandma Campbell until later,
Peace. We can't ask <em>them</em> to wait."</p>

<p>"Faith and Hope might for once. They <em>never</em> have to!"</p>

<p>"Faith is to serve dinner, and Hope is needed at the table."</p>

<p>"Which I s'pose means Cherry and me ain't needed," cried the
disappointed child.</p>

<p>"Peace! I am ashamed of such a little pig."</p>

<p>"It ain't piggishness, Gail. I don't want a whole hen, I want
just a drumstick," protested Peace, with two real tears in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, now we are in for a scene," sighed the older girl,
anxious to avert the storm. "Now be reasonable, Peace. If you
will wait like a good little girl, you shall have a drumstick.
Look at Cherry,&mdash;she doesn't make a fuss at all. You will be sorry
by and by if you cry and get your eyes all red."</p>

<p>"Is there to be a s'prise?" asked Peace in animated curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>such</em> a splendid one!"</p>

<p>"I'm not going to cry, Gail. Those two tears just got loose 'fore
I knew it. I will stay in the parlor with Cherry all right, but
don't take too long a time eating dinner, and <em>don't</em> forget
my drumstick."</p>

<p>With this parting warning she flew back into the front room and
announced, "Dinner is ready, folkses! Faith, tell them where to
sit; and say, you all better eat fast, 'cause Gail says there
is a big s'prise coming."</p>

<p>Slamming the door behind them as they filed out into the dining-room,
she sat down in the nearest chair and faced Cherry with a droll
look of resignation, saying, "Well, Charity Greenfield, how do
you like being one of the children and having to wait every time
we have comp'ny? When I have a family of my own, I'll make the
visitors do the waiting."</p>

<p>"I don't mind it much," answered Cherry, serenely. "There is
a heap of victuals cooked. Mrs. Grinnell said she guessed we must
have been expecting a regiment."</p>

<p>Peace sniffed the air hungrily, rose with deliberation from the
rocker, tiptoed to the door, opened it a crack and peeked out
at the merry diners. Then she let go of the knob with a jerk,
wheeled toward Cherry and whispered, "Just as I 'xpected! That
man <em>has</em> got a drumstick and he just gave Allee one. He's
stuffing her for all he's worth. First thing we know, she will
be sick."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you banged that door, too, so they must have heard
you," said Cherry indignantly.</p>

<p>"Maybe 'twill hurry them up. I don't see <em>how</em> I can wait."</p>

<p>"Get a book and read. Then the time will seem shorter."</p>

<p>Peace rocked idly back and forth a few turns, patching her companion
in misery, who seemed so absorbed in her story that even the thoughts
of no dinner did not disturb her; then she stalked over to the
battered bookcase, drew out a big, green-covered book which evidently
had been often read, for the binding was in rags, and sat down
on the rug to digest its contents.</p>

<p>"'Bright was the summer of 1296. The war which had desolated
Scotland was then at an end,'" read Peace slowly, spelling out
the long, unfamiliar words and finding it dry reading. She turned
the yellowed pages rapidly in search of pictures, but found none.
She skipped several lines and began again to read, "'But while
the courts of Edward, or of his representatives, were crowded&mdash;'
oh, dear, what does it mean? There ain't a mite of sense in using
such long words. Cherry, what is this book about?"</p>

<p>"'Scottish Chiefs?'" said the sister, looking up indifferently.
"I don't know. Ask Hope. She had to read it last year when they
studied English history."</p>

<p>"I thought maybe 'twas about Indians. I didn't know other things
were called chiefs. My, I can smell dinner awfully plain! They've
been at it long enough to have finished, seems to me. I'm going
to peek again."</p>

<p>"You better not let that door slam," warned Cherry, "or Gail
will be getting after you."</p>

<p>"I don't intend to. It slipped the other time. There goes another
drumstick!" she wailed dismally, forgetting to speak in whispers;
and the amazed guests beheld a flushed, distressed face popped
through the wide crack of the door, as rebellious Peace called
in bitter indignation, "Remember, all the family haven't had dinner
yet, and chickens don't grow on every bush!"</p>

<p>"Peace!" gasped poor, mortified Gail.</p>

<p>"Ha-ha-ha!" roared the minister, and President Campbell called
after the little figure which had vanished behind the closed door
once more, "That is right, Peace! You needn't stay in there another
minute. Here is plenty of room for you and Cherry in my lap."</p>

<p>The only answer was the sound of a choking sob from the adjoining
room, and the college president started to his feet with remorse
in his heart, pleading, "Let me get her! It's too bad to shut
them off there to wait for us older folks to eat dinner. I know
from experience."</p>

<p>But Gail stopped him, saying firmly, "No, it was very naughty
of her to do that, and she can't have any dinner at all now until
she has apologized."</p>

<p>"You are hard on her."</p>

<p>"She must remember her manners. I resign my authority to you
and Grandma in a few hours," she answered laughingly, "but until
then she must mind me."</p>

<p>"<em>Please</em> let me bring them out here with us, anyway,"
he urged. "She will apologize; and around the table is a good
place for the big 's'prise' she is expecting."</p>

<p>"Very well," she answered reluctantly.</p>

<p>Excusing himself to the little dinner party, he disappeared behind
the parlor door, whispered a few words to the conscience-stricken
culprit in the corner, and in a surprisingly short time reappeared
with two smiling little girls.</p>

<p>Peace's eyes were red, and one lone tear stood on the rosy cheek,
but she marched up to the table, bowed, and said with some embarrassment,
but in all sincerity, "Ladies and gentlemen, I've already told
Grandpa, and he said it was all right &mdash;I apologize. I s'pose
you are hungry, same as I, and that's what has kept you busy eating
for so long. I shouldn't have hollered at you from the door like
I did, but if you wanted that drumstick as bad as I do, you'd
have hollered, too. Now can I have my dinner? Cherry, you sit
in half of Allee's chair. Faith, Hope will give you a piece of
her place, and I am to have half of Grandpa's. That's all his
plan, so come along, Faith. Please pass me my drumstick. You've
already blessed it, haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Peace!"</p>

<p>"Now, Gail, please don't scold! This is the last day in the little
brown house, you know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What!" burst forth, a chorus of dismayed voices.</p>

<p>"Ain't that <em>mordige</em> settled yet?" demanded Peace.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I had a long talk with Mr. Strong, and we settled that
question forever and all time, I hope. Nevertheless, you aren't
going to stay here any longer."</p>

<p>A hush fell over the five younger girls, though Gail was smiling
happily with the rest of the little company, and even Baby Glen
seemed to appreciate the situation, and cooed gleefully, as he
pounded the table with his spoon.</p>

<p>"It's just as I 'xpected," Peace blurted out at length. "I said
I bet you wanted the farm yourself, seeing that old Skin &mdash;Mr.
Skinflint didn't get it."</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed loud and long; then the old
face sobered, and he said, "No, it isn't that, Peace. We &mdash;Grandma
and <em>I&mdash;</em>want you to come and live with us. Gail says yes.
What is your answer?"</p>

<p>"All of us?" whispered Hope in awestruck tones, remembering with
fresh fear the midnight conference of a few weeks before.</p>

<p>"All of you!"</p>

<p>"Gail, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!"</p>

<p>"Haven't you any children yourself?" asked Allee, not exactly
understanding the drift of remarks.</p>

<p>"No, dear. The angels came and took away our two little girlies
before they were as big as you are."</p>

<p>"But six is an awful many to raise at once," sighed Peace. "Do
you think you can do it?"</p>

<p>"I will try if you will come."</p>

<p>"Do you live in Martindale?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is your house big enough?"</p>

<p>"It has ten big rooms and an attic. Won't that do?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>es. Do you lick?"</p>

<p>"Do I lick?" he echoed in surprise.</p>

<p>"When we are bad, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh! Well, I can, but I don't very often. I am pretty easy to
get along with; but folks have to mind. I am fond of <em>good</em>
children."</p>

<p>"I'm <em>usually</em> good. I have been bad today, but I am ever
so sorry now. I always am when it's too late to mend matters.
But I don't want you to think I am always such a pig and have
to 'pologize for my dinner. Yes, I'll come to live with you, and
of course the others will. Mrs. Grinnell says you are an awfully
nice man."</p>

<p>"I am sure I thank Mrs. Grinnell," he answered with twinkling
eyes, bowing gravely to the embarrassed lady across the table.</p>

<p>"But what I can't see is how you came to pick us out to take
home with you,&mdash;<em>Mr. Tramp!</em>" She started to her feet in
astonishment, having suddenly fitted the familiar face into its
place in her memory.</p>

<p>"At your service, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Ain't you my tramp?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then you are just fooling about our going to live with, you."</p>

<p>"Not at all. I mean every word of it. Ask Grandma, ask Brother
Strong, ask Gail, any of them."</p>

<p>"But what about the tramp?" she half whispered, still too dazed
to understand.</p>

<p>"That is rather a long story," he smiled, stroking the tight
ringlets of brown on one side of him, and the bright, golden curls
on the other. "A year ago last spring I tried to be ill&mdash;play
sick, you know; and the doctor told me a vacation of tramping
was what I needed to put me in tune again. Having some pet theories
in regard to the tramp problem of this country, I decided to take
his words literally, so I turned tramp myself&mdash;just for a little
time, you see. That is how you saw me first. I told my wife it
was a case of love at first sight, and I became so much interested
in this brave little family that I have kept watch ever since.</p>

<p>"Here was a family without any father and mother, and there were
a father and mother without any family. You needed the one and
we needed the other. But at first the way didn't seem clear. I
was given to understand that you didn't want to be adopted, and
as I found that Gail was legally old enough to take care of the
family, I was just on the point of preparing to play guardian
angel instead of grandfather, when I chanced upon some old church
records telling about your own grandfather's death. It gave a
brief account of his life, and I was astonished to find that I
knew him well,&mdash;in fact, as my big brother."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it," pleaded Hope, as he paused reminiscently.</p>

<p>"When I was a little shaver my father was a seaman, captain of
a ship; but his whole fortune consisted of his vessel, his wife
and son. Mother and I often used to go with him on his trips,
but for some reason he left me at home the last time he set sail,
and he never came back. New Orleans was his port. Yellow fever
broke out while he was there, and so far as I have been able to
find out, every soul of his crew died of it. I had been left with
a neighbor who had her hands full looking after her own children;
so, when word came that my parents were both dead, she sent for
the town officers, and told them I must go to the poor-farm. I
was only about the size of Allee, here, but I knew that the poor-farm
was a place much dreaded, and rather than be taken there, I tried
to run away. Your grandfather found me. He was one of our nearest
neighbors and knew me well, so when I sobbed out the whole terrible
story into his sympathetic ears, he adopted me on the spot. He
wasn't more than a dozen years old himself, but he had a heart
big enough to take in the whole world, and when he had coaxed
me home with him and told his mother about my misfortune, I knew
I was safe. They would never send me away again. So Hiram Allen
became my big brother, and the Allen home was mine for ten long
years. Then an uncle of mine whom everyone had thought was dead
put in appearance and took me to sea on a long voyage which covered
the greater part of four years. When I returned, Mother and Father
Allen were dead and the younger fry had gone West,&mdash;no one seemed
to know where. Then and there I completely lost sight of them,
and it was only by chance that I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grandpa's name wasn't Hi Allen," mused Faith aloud, with a puzzled
look in her eyes. "It was Greenfield, just like ours."</p>

<p>"Yes; that is one reason, I suppose, why I never found my big
brother of my boyhood days. You see, he had a stepfather. His
own parent was drowned at sea when he was a tiny baby, and his
mother married again; so he was known all over the place as Hi
Allen instead of Hi Greenfield, which was his real name. When
he grew to manhood and entered the ministry he decided to take
his own name. But, though I dimly remembered having heard people
say that Mr. Allen wasn't Hi's own father, I never heard his real
name spoken, to my knowledge, and I never once thought of the
possibility of his assuming it in place of his stepfather's.</p>

<p>"When I discovered your grandfather's identity only a few days
ago, the way seemed suddenly open to me. Hi Allen had shared his
home with me when I was an orphan; I would share my home with
his little granddaughters, alone in the world and in trouble,&mdash;for
by this time I had heard about the mortgage and the battle being
fought in the little brown house to keep the family together.
Mothering this big brood is too great a task for Gail. She needs
mothering herself. We want to adopt you, mother and I. Will you
let us; for the sake of the dear grandfather who did so much for
me?"</p>

<p>His face was so full of yearning tenderness that tears came to
the eyes of the older members of the queer little party, and even
the children had to swallow hard.</p>

<p>"I have talked the matter over with Gail, and she agrees if the
rest of you will consent. I am not a millionaire, but we are pretty
well fixed in a material way and can give you a great many pleasures
and advantages that the little town of Parker can never offer.
There are fine schools in the city, and college for Gail. We have
a piano and violin and all sorts of music, a horse and buggy,
a big barn, and a splendid yard in a nice locality, with plenty
of room for tennis or any other kind of gymnastics. Maybe some
day there will be an automobile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't care about pianos and nautomobiles," interrupted Peace.
"It's the kind of people you are that I am thinking about. Mrs.
Grinnell says you're the president of a big college and everyone
knows you. If that's so, you ought to be pretty nice, I sh'd think.
<em>I</em> like you, anyhow, and I b'lieve you'll like us, too.
But I'm an awful case, even when I don't mean to be. Maybe you
would rather&mdash;didn't <em>I&mdash;</em>weren't you &mdash;I saw you
in Swift &amp; Smart's store!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lady! Twice in the city I have seen you and Allee, and
both times I thought surely you knew me, but I don't believe you
did."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I 'member now. It was you who gave us that gold
money when we were selling flowers. But you look different with
new clothes on and a clean face."</p>

<p>"Why, you little rascal! Wasn't my face clean when I came here
to get something to eat?"</p>

<p>"It might have been, but it was prickly looking with the mustache
all over your chin, and I like you lots better this way. I almost
didn't know you the night you got supper for us, either."</p>

<p>"And the rice burned."</p>

<p>"And I broke Bossy's leg and you sent us Queenie to take her
place, and Faith said I was worse than Jack of the Bean Stalk,
and &mdash;I bet you <em>are</em> the fellow that pinned the money
to the gatepost and grain sacks! Now, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid I am."</p>

<p>"You told me once before that you weren't."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I just asked you if it wouldn't be a queer kind
of <em>tramp</em> who could do such a thing. Isn't that what I
said?"</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>es," she finally acknowledged. Then the puzzled
frown in her forehead smoothed itself away and she wheeled toward
the oldest sister with the triumphant shout, "There, Gail, didn't
I tell you he was a prince in disgus&mdash;disguise? Now ain't you
sorry you didn't spend the money? She has got it all saved away
yet. I must kiss you for that, Grandpa, even if it didn't do us
any good." She threw her arms, drumstick and all, about his neck
and gave him a greasy smack, immediately rubbing her lips with
the back of one hand.</p>

<p>"Aha! That's no fair," he protested. "You rubbed that off."</p>

<p>"No, I didn't. I just rubbed it in. Thank you, I don't care for
any pie tonight. Somehow this drumstick filled me up full. I can't
eat a bite more. Have you been waiting all this time for me? Well,
let's go back into the parlor then, and do the rest of our talking.
I've sat on the tip edge of nothing until I am tired. There's
more space in the front room."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Peace Greenfield," cried Mr. Campbell, pretending
to feel insulted at her intimation that he had not given her a
large enough share of his chair, "the first time I ever called
at your house, I found you sitting on the gatepost,&mdash;the <em>gatepost</em>,
mind you,&mdash;about so square," measuring with his hands; "and just
as I turned in from the road, you began to sing, 'The Campbells
are coming, oho, oho!' What kind of a reception do you call that?
And tonight you weren't even going to give me any supper."</p>

<p>"Oh," she hastily assured him, "I didn't mean you by that song.
I used to think that the Campbells were little striped bugs that
eat up the cucumber plants, and the very morning that you came
here for breakfast I found two in the garden. What are you laughing
at? I know better now, but I truly didn't have a notion what your
name was then. You must have known I didn't. But I am awfully
glad you came and that you kept coming even when I was bad and
made you work so hard. I am sorry, but never mind, I am <em>deformed</em>
now."</p>

<p>"Deformed, child? Where?"</p>

<p>"Right here in my heart! I am going to be as good as gold all
the time after this. I think the angels must have sent you. We've
always wanted a first-class grandfather and grandmother, but we
never 'xpected to get 'em until we found our own inside the Gates
some day. Just the same, I spoke to God about it, and He probably
had the angels hunt you up. So I have <em>deformed</em> and now
I'll be real good. I'm truly sorry I was such a selfish pig about
wanting a drumstick tonight. I s'pose that's why the drumstick
filled me up so quick and didn't leave any room for pie. Custard
is my favorite."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is the reason," he agreed, quite as serious as
she. "We always are happiest when we are unselfish. Now, let's
forget all about the badness and just remember the goodness. I
have some of the most splendid plans for what we shall do when
I have my six girls at home with me. What beautiful times we shall
have, mother!"</p>

<p>"How can we ever thank them?" whispered bright-eyed Gail to Mrs.
Strong, under cover of the lively conversation at the other end
of the table.</p>

<p>"By loving them," promptly answered the little woman, offering
up a prayer of thanksgiving that the brave little orphan band
had found such a beautiful home. "They are noble people and have
hungered all their lives for just that very thing."</p>

<p>"But love seems such a little thing to give for the blessings
we shall enjoy from their hands."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear, that is where you are mistaken, Love is <em>everything</em>."</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
