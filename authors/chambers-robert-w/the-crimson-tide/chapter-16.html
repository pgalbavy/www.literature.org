<p>"Are you worried about this Dumont girl?" asked Shotwell Senior
abruptly.</p>

<p>His wife did not look up from her book. After an interval:</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I am."</p>

<p>Her husband watched her over the top of his newspaper.</p>

<p>"I can't believe there's anything in it," he said. "But it's
a shame that Jim should worry you so."</p>

<p>"He doesn't mean to."</p>

<p>"Probably he doesn't, but what's the difference? You're unhappy
and he's the reason of it. And it isn't as though he were a cub
any longer, either. He's old enough to know what he's about. He's
no Willy Baxter."</p>

<p>"That is what makes me anxious," said Helen Shotwell. "Do you
know, dear, that he hasn't dined here once this week, yet he seems
to go nowhere else&mdash;nowhere except to her."</p>

<p>"What sort of woman is she?" he demanded, wiping his eyeglasses
as though preparing to take a long-distance look at Palla.</p>

<p>"I know her only at the Red Cross."</p>

<p>"Well, is she at all common?"</p>

<p>"No.... That is why it is difficult for me to talk to Jim about
her. There's nothing of that sort to criticise."</p>

<p>"No social objections to the girl?"</p>

<p>"None. She's an unusual girl."</p>

<p>"Attractive?"</p>

<p>"Unfortunately."</p>

<p>"Well, then&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, James, I <em>want</em> him to marry Elorn! And if he's going
to make himself conspicuous over this Dumont girl, I don't think
I can bear it!"</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the objection to the girl, Helen?" he asked,
flinging his paper onto a table and drawing nearer the fire.</p>

<p>"She isn't at all our kind, James&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But you just said&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean socially. And still, as far as that goes, she seems
to care nothing whatever for position or social duties or obligations."</p>

<p>"That's not so unusual in these days," he remarked. "Lots of
nice girls are fed up on the social aspects of life."</p>

<p>"Well, for example, she has not made the slightest effort to
know anybody worth knowing. Janet Speedwell left cards and then
asked her to dinner, and received an amiable regret for her pains.
No girl can afford to decline invitations from Janet, even if
her excuse is a club meeting.</p>

<p>"And two or three other women at the Red Cross have asked her
to lunch at the Colony Club, and have made advances to her on
Leila Vance's account, but she hasn't responded. Now, you know
a girl isn't going to get on by politely ignoring the advances
of such women. But she doesn't even appear to be aware of their
importance."</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her to something?" suggested her husband.</p>

<p>"I did," she said, a little sharply. "I asked her and Leila Vance
to dine with us. I intended to ask Elorn, too, and let Jim realise
the difference if he isn't already too blind to see."</p>

<p>"Did she decline?"</p>

<p>"She did," said Helen curtly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It happened that she had asked somebody to dine with her that
evening. And I have a horrid suspicion it was Jim. If it was,
she could have postponed it. Of course it was a valid excuse,
but it annoyed me to have her decline. That's what I tell you,
James, she has a most disturbing habit of declining overtures
from everybody&mdash;even from&#11834;"</p>

<p>Helen checked herself, looked at her husband with an odd smile,
in which there was no mirth; then:</p>

<p>"You probably are not aware of it, dear, but that girl has also
declined Jim's overtures."</p>

<p>"Jim's what?"</p>

<p>"Invitation."</p>

<p>"Invitation to do what?"</p>

<p>"Marry him."</p>

<p>Shotwell Senior turned very red.</p>

<p>"The devil she did! How do you know?"</p>

<p>"Jim told me."</p>

<p>"That she turned him down?"</p>

<p>"She declined to marry him."</p>

<p>Her husband seemed unable to grasp such a fact. Never had it
occurred to Shotwell Senior that any living, human girl could
decline such an invitation from his only son.</p>

<p>After a painful silence: "Well," he said in a perplexed and mortified
voice, "she certainly seems to be, as you say, a most unusual
girl.... But&mdash;if it's settled&mdash;why do you continue to worry, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Because Jim is very deeply in love with her.... And I'm sore
at heart."</p>

<p>"Hard hit, is he?"</p>

<p>"Very unhappy."</p>

<p>Shotwell Senior reddened again: "He'll have to face it," he said....
"But that girl seems to be a fool!"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>wonder."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"A girl may change her mind." She lifted her head and looked
with sad humour at her husband, whom she also had kept dangling
for a while. Then:</p>

<p>"James, dear, our son <em>is</em> as fine as we think him. But
he's just a splendid, wholesome, everyday, unimaginative New York
business man. And he's fallen in love with his absolute antithesis.
Because this girl is all ardent imagination, full of extravagant
impulses, very lovely to look at, but a perfectly illogical fanatic!</p>

<p>"Mrs. Vance has told me all about her. She really belongs in
some exotic romance, not in New York. She's entirely irresponsible,
perfectly unstable. There is in her a generous sort of recklessness
which is quite likely to drive her headlong into any extreme.
And what sort of mate would such a girl be for a young man whose
ambition is to make good in the real estate business, marry a
nice girl, have a pleasant home and agreeable children, and otherwise
conform to the ordinary conventions of civilisation?"</p>

<p>"I think," remarked her husband grimly, "that she'd keep him
guessing."</p>

<p>"She would indeed! And that's not all, James. For I've got to
tell you that the girl entertains some rather weird and dreadful
socialistic notions. She talks socialism&mdash;a mild variety&mdash;from
public platforms. She admits very frankly that she entertains
no respect for accepted conventions. And while I have no reason
to doubt her purity of mind and personal chastity, the unpleasant
and startling fact remains that she proposes that humanity should
dispense with the marriage ceremony and discard it and any orthodox
religion as obsolete superstitions."</p>

<p>Her husband stared at her.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake," he began, then got frightfully red in the
face once more. "What that girl needs is a plain spanking!" he
said bluntly. "I'd like to see her or any other girl try to come
into this family on any such ridiculous terms!"</p>

<p>"She doesn't seem to want to come in on any terms," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Then what are you worrying about?"</p>

<p>"I am worrying about what might happen if she ever changed her
mind."</p>

<p>"But you say she doesn't believe in marriage!"</p>

<p>"She doesn't."</p>

<p>"Well, that boy of ours isn't crazy," insisted Shotwell Senior.</p>

<p>But his mother remained silent in her deep misgiving concerning
the sanity of the simpler sex, when mentally upset by love. For
it seemed very difficult to understand what to do&mdash;if, indeed,
there was anything for her to do in the matter.</p>

<p>To express disapproval of Palla to Jim or to the girl herself&mdash;to
show any opposition at all&mdash;would, she feared, merely defeat its
own purpose and alienate her son's confidence.</p>

<p>The situation was certainly a most disturbing one, though not
at present perilous.</p>

<p>And Helen would not permit herself to believe that it could ever
really become an impossible situation&mdash;that this young girl would
deliberately slap civilisation in the face; or that her only son
would add a kick to the silly assault and take the ruinous consequences
of social ostracism.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The young girl in question was at that moment seated before her
piano, her charming head uplifted, singing in the silvery voice
of an immaculate angel, to her own accompaniment, the heavenly
Mass of Saint Hild√©:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Love me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorable Mother!<br/>
Mary,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worship no other.<br/>
Save me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, graciously save me<br/>
I pray!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let my Darkness be turned into Day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Light of Thy Grace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thy Face,<br/>
I pray!"

</p>
</div>
<p>She continued the exquisite refrain on the keys for a while,
then slowly turned to the man beside her.</p>

<p>"The one Mass I still love," she murmured absently, "&mdash;memories
of childhood, I suppose&mdash;when the Sisters made me sing the solo
&mdash;I was only ten years old." ... She shrugged her shoulders:
"You know, in those days, I was a little devil," she said seriously.</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>"I really was, Jim,&mdash;all over everything and wild as a swallow.
I led the pack; Shadow Hill held us in horror. I remember I fought
our butcher's boy once&mdash;right in the middle of the street&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"He did something to a cat which I couldn't stand."</p>

<p>"Did you whip him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jim, it was horrid. We both were dreadfully battered. And
the constable caught us both, and I shall never, never forget
my mother's face!&#11834;"</p>

<p>She gazed down at the keys of the piano, touched them pensively.</p>

<p>"The very deuce was in me," she sighed. "Even now, unless I'm
occupied with all my might, something begins&mdash;to simmer in me&#11834;"</p>

<p>She turned and looked at him: " &mdash;A sort of enchanted madness
that makes me wild to seize the whole world and set it right!&mdash;take
it into my arms and defend it&mdash;die for it&mdash;or slay it and end
its pain."</p>

<p>"Too much of an armful," he said with great gravity. "The thing
to do is to select an individual and take <em>him</em> to your
heart."</p>

<p>"And slay him?" she inquired gaily.</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;like the feminine mantis&mdash;if you find you don't like
him. Individual suitors must take their chances of being either
eaten or adored."</p>

<p>"Jim, you're so funny."</p>

<p>She swung her stool, rested her elbow on the piano, and gazed
at him interrogatively, the odd, half-smile edging her lips and
eyes. And, after a little <em>duetto</em> of silence:</p>

<p>"Do you suppose I shall ever come to care for you&mdash;imprudently?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't let you."</p>

<p>"How could you help it? And, as far as that goes, how could I,
if it happened?"</p>

<p>"If you ever come to care at all," he said, "you'll care enough."</p>

<p>"That is the trouble with you," she retorted, "you don't care
enough."</p>

<p>A slight flush stained his cheek-bones: "Sometimes," he said,
"I almost wish I cared less. And that would be what you call enough."</p>

<p>Colour came into her face, too:</p>

<p>"Do you know, Jim, I really don't know how much I do care for
you? It sounds rather silly, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Do you care more than you did at first?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Much more?"</p>

<p>"I told you I don't know how much."</p>

<p>"Not enough to marry me?"</p>

<p>"Must we discuss that again?"</p>

<p>He got up, went out to the hall, pulled a book from his overcoat
pocket, and returned.</p>

<p>"Would you care to hear what the greatest American says on the
subject, Palla?"</p>

<p>"On the subject of marriage?"</p>

<p>"No; he takes the marriage for granted. It's what he has to say
concerning the obligations involved."</p>

<p>"Proceed, dear," she said, laughingly.</p>

<p>He read, eliminating what was not necessary to make his point:</p>

<p>"'A race is worthless and contemptible if its men cease to work
hard and, at need, to fight hard; and if its women cease to breed
freely. If the best classes do not reproduce themselves the nation
will, of course, go down.</p>

<p>"'When the ordinary decent man does not understand that to marry
the woman he loves, as early as he can, is the most desirable
of all goals; when the ordinary woman does not understand that
all other forms of life are but makeshift substitutes for the
life of the wife, the mother of healthy children; then the State
is rotten at heart.</p>

<p>"'The woman who shrinks from motherhood is as low a creature
as a man of the professional pacifist, or poltroon, type, who
shirks his duty as a soldier.</p>

<p>"'The only full life for man or woman is led by those men and
women who together, with hearts both gentle and valiant, face
lives of love and duty, who see their children rise up to call
them blessed, and who leave behind them their seed to inherit
the earth.</p>

<p>"'No celibate life approaches such a life in usefulness. The
mother comes ahead of the nun.</p>

<p>"'But if the average woman does not marry and become the mother
of enough healthy children to permit the increase of the race;
and if the average man does not marry in times of peace and do
his full duty in war if need arises, then the race is decadent
and should be swept aside to make room for a better one.</p>

<p>"'Only that nation has a future whose sons and daughters recognise
and obey the primary laws of their racial being!'"</p>

<p>He closed the book and laid it on the piano.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "either we're really a rotten and decadent race,
and might as well behave like one, or we're sound and sane."</p>

<p>Something unusual in his voice&mdash;in the sudden grim whiteness
of his face&mdash;disturbed Palla.</p>

<p>"I want you to marry me," he said. "You care for no other man.
And if you don't love me enough to do it, you'll learn to afterward."</p>

<p>"Jim," she said gently, and now rather white herself, "that is
an outrageous thing to say to me. Don't you realise it?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. But I love you &mdash;I need you so that I'm fit
for nothing else. I can't keep my mind on my work; I can't think
of anybody&mdash;anything but you.... If you didn't care for me more
or less I wouldn't come whining to you. I wouldn't come now until
I'd entirely won your heart&mdash;except that&mdash;if I did&mdash;and if you
refused me marriage and offered the other thing &mdash;I'd be
about through with everything! And I'd know damned well that the
nation wasn't worth the powder to blow it to hell if such women
as you betray it!"</p>

<p>The girl flushed furiously; but her voice seemed fairly under
control.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better go, Jim, before you say anything more?"</p>

<p>"Will you marry me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He stood up very straight, unstirring, for a long time, not looking
at her.</p>

<p>Then he said "good-bye," in a low voice, and went out leaving
her quite pale again and rather badly scared.</p>

<p>As the lower door closed, she sprang to the landing and called
his name in a frightened voice that had no carrying power.</p>

</div>
<p>Later she telephoned to his several clubs. At eleven she called
each club again; and finally telephoned to his house.</p>

<p>At midnight he had not telephoned in reply to the messages she
had left requesting him to call her.</p>

<p>Her anxiety had changed to a vague bewilderment. Her dismayed
resentment at what he had said to her was giving place to a strange
and unaccustomed sense of loneliness.</p>

<p>Suddenly an overwhelming desire to be with Ilse seized her, and
she would have called a taxi and started immediately, except for
the dread that Jim might telephone in her absence.</p>

<p>Yet, she didn't know what it was that she wanted of him, except
to protest at his attitude toward her. Such a protest was due
them both&mdash;an appeal in behalf of the friendship which meant so
much to her&mdash;which, she had abruptly discovered, meant far more
to her than she supposed.</p>

<p>At midnight she telephoned to Ilse. A sleepy maid replied that
Miss Westgard had not yet returned.</p>

<p>So Palla called a taxi, pinned on her hat and struggled into
her fur coat, and, taking her latch-key, started for Ilse's apartment,
feeling need of her in a blind sort of way&mdash;desiring to listen
to her friendly voice, touch her, hear her clear, sane laughter.</p>

<p>A yawning maid admitted her. Miss Westgard had dined out with
Mr. Estridge, but had not yet returned.</p>

<p>So Palla, wondering a little, laid aside her coat and went into
the pretty living room.</p>

<p>There were books and magazines enough, but after a while she
gave up trying to read and sat staring absently at a photograph
of Estridge in uniform, which stood on the table at her elbow.</p>

<p>Across it was an inscription, dated only a few days back: "To
Ilse from Jack, on the road to Asgard."</p>

<p>Then, as she gazed at the man's handsome features, for the first
time a vague sense of uneasiness invaded her.</p>

<p>Of a gradually growing comradeship between these two she had
been tranquilly aware. And yet, now, it surprised her to realise
that their comradeship had drifted into intimacy.</p>

<p>Lying back in her armchair, her thoughts hovered about these
two; and she went back in her mind to recollect something of the
beginning of this intimacy;&mdash;and remembered various little incidents
which, at the time, seemed of no portent.</p>

<p>And, reflecting, she recollected now what Ilse had said to her
after the last party she had given&mdash;and which Palla had not understood.</p>

<p>What had Ilse meant by asking her to "wait"? Wait for what?...
Where was Ilse, now? Why did she remain out so late with John
Estridge? It was after one o'clock.</p>

<p>Of course they must be dancing somewhere or other. There were
plenty of dances to go to.</p>

<p>Palla stirred restlessly in her chair. Evidently Ilse had not
told her maid that she meant to be out late, for the girl seemed
to have expected her an hour ago.</p>

<p>Palla's increasing restlessness finally drove her to the windows,
where she pulled aside the shades and stood looking out into the
silent night.</p>

<p>The night was cold and clear and very still. Rarely a footfarer
passed; seldom a car. And the stillness of the dark city increased
her nervousness.</p>

<p>New York has rare phases of uncanny silence, when, for a space,
no sound disturbs the weird stillness.</p>

<p>The clang of trains, the feathery whirr of motors, the echo of
footsteps, the immense, indefinable breathing vibration of the
iron monster, drowsing on its rock between three rivers and the
sea, ceases utterly. And a vast stillness reigns, mournful, ominous,
unutterably sad.</p>

<p>Palla looked down into the empty street. The dark chill of it
seemed to rise and touch her; and she shivered unconsciously and
turned back into the lighted room.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>It was two o'clock. Her eyes were heavy, her heart heavier. Why
should everything suddenly happen to her in that way? Where had
Jim gone when he left her? And who was it answered the telephone
at his house when she had called up and asked to speak to him?
It was a woman's voice&mdash;a maid, no doubt&mdash;yet, for an instant,
she had fancied that the voice resembled his mother's.</p>

<p>But it couldn't have been, for Palla had given her name, and
Mrs. Shotwell would have spoken to her&mdash;unless&mdash;perhaps his mother&mdash;disapproved
of something&mdash;of her calling Jim at such an hour.... Or of something
... perhaps of their friendship ... of herself, perhaps&#11834;</p>

<p>She heard the clock strike and looked across at the mantel.</p>

<p>What was Ilse doing at half-past two in the morning? Where could
she be?</p>

<p>Palla involuntarily turned her head and looked at the photograph.
Of course Ilse was safe with a man like John Estridge.... That
is to say ...</p>

<p>Without warning, her face grew hot and the crimson tide mounted
to the roots of her hair, dyeing throat and temples.</p>

<p>A sort of stunning reaction followed as the tide ebbed; she found
herself stupidly repeating the word "safe," as though to interpret
what it meant.</p>

<p>Safe? Yes, Ilse was safe. She knew how to take care of herself
... unless....</p>

<p>Again the crimson tide invaded her skin to the temples.... A
sudden and haunting fear came creeping after it had ebbed once
more, leaving her gazing fixedly into space through the tumult
of her thoughts. And always in dull, unmeaning repetition the
word "safe" throbbed in her ears.</p>

<p>Safe? Safe from what? From the creed they both professed? From
their common belief? From the consequences of living up to it?</p>

<p>At the thought, Palla sprang to her feet and stood quivering
all over, both hands pressed to her throat, which was quivering
too.</p>

<p>Where was Ilse? What had happened? Had she suddenly come face
to face with that creed of theirs&mdash;that shadowy creed which they
believed in, perhaps because it seemed so unreal!&mdash;because the
ordeal by fire seemed so vague, so far away in that ghostly bourne
which is called the future, and which remains always so inconceivably
distant to the young&mdash;star-distant, remote as inter-stellar dust&mdash;aloof
as death.</p>

<p>It was three o'clock. There were velvet-dark smears under Palla's
eyes, little colour in her lips. The weight of fatigue lay heavily
on her young shoulders; on her mind, too, partly stupefied by
the violence of her emotions.</p>

<p>Once she had risen heavily, had gone into the maid's room and
had told her to go to bed, adding that she herself would wait
for Miss Westgard.</p>

<p>That, already, was nearly an hour ago, and the gilt hands of
the clock were already creeping around the gilded dial toward
the half hour.</p>

<p>As it struck on the clear French bell, a key turned in the outside
door; then the door closed; and Palla rose trembling from her
chair as Ilse entered, her golden hair in lovely disorder, the
evening cloak partly flung from her shoulders.</p>

<p>There was a moment's utter silence. Then Ilse stepped swiftly
forward and took Palla in her arms.</p>

<p>"My darling! What has happened?" she asked. "Why are you here
at this hour? You look dreadfully ill!&#11834;"</p>

<p>Palla's head dropped on her breast.</p>

<p>"What is it?" whispered Ilse. "Darling&mdash;darling&mdash;you did&mdash;you
did wait&mdash;didn't you?"</p>

<p>Palla's voice was scarcely audible: "I don't know what you mean....
I was only frightened about you.... I've been so unhappy.... And
Jim said&mdash;good-bye&mdash;and I can't&mdash;find him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I want you to answer me! Are you in love with him?"</p>

<p>"No.... I don't&mdash;think so&#11834;"</p>

<p>Ilse drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>"It's all right, then," she said.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Palla seemed to understand what Ilse had meant
when she had said, "Wait!"</p>

<p>And she lifted her head and looked blindly into the sea-blue
eyes&mdash;blindly, desperately, striving to see through those clear
soul-windows what it might be that was looking out at her.</p>

<p>And, gazing, she knew that she dared not ask Ilse where she had
been.</p>

<p>The latter smiled; but her voice was very tender when she spoke.</p>

<p>"We'll telephone your maid in the morning. You must go to bed,
Palla."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>Ilse turned carelessly and laid her cloak across a chair. There
was a second chamber beyond her own. She went into it, turned
down the bed and called Palla, who came slowly after her.</p>

<p>They kissed each other in silence. Then Ilse went back to her
own room.</p>
