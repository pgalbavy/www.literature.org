Margaret had already taken a little house in Radnor Square, 
Westminster, before our marriage, a house that seemed particularly 
adaptable to our needs as public-spirited efficients; it had been 
very pleasantly painted and papered under Margaret's instructions, 
white paint and clean open purples and green predominating, and now 
we set to work at once upon the interesting business of arranging 
and--with our Venetian glass as a beginning--furnishing it.  We had 
been fairly fortunate with our wedding presents, and for the most 
part it was open to us to choose just exactly what we would have and 
just precisely where we would put it.
<P>
Margaret had a sense of form and colour altogether superior to mine, 
and so quite apart from the fact that it was her money equipped us, 
I stood aside from all these matters and obeyed her summons to a 
consultation only to endorse her judgment very readily.  Until 
everything was settled I went every day to my old rooms in Vincent 
Square and worked at a series of papers that were originally 
intended for the FORTNIGHTLY REVIEW, the papers that afterwards 
became my fourth book, "New Aspects of Liberalism."
<P>
I still remember as delightful most of the circumstances of getting 
into 79, Radnor Square.  The thin flavour of indecision about 
Margaret disappeared altogether in a shop; she had the precisest 
ideas of what she wanted, and the devices of the salesman did not 
sway her.  It was very pleasant to find her taking things out of my 
hands with a certain masterfulness, and showing the distinctest 
determination to make a house in which I should be able to work in 
that great project of "doing something for the world."
<P>
"And I do want to make things pretty about us," she said.  "You 
don't think it wrong to have things pretty?"
<P>
"I want them so."
<P>
"Altiora has things hard."
<P>
"Altiora," I answered, "takes a pride in standing ugly and 
uncomfortable things.  But I don't see that they help her.  Anyhow 
they won't help me."
<P>
So Margaret went to the best shops and got everything very simple 
and very good.  She bought some pictures very well indeed; there was 
a little Sussex landscape, full of wind and sunshine, by Nicholson, 
for my study, that hit my taste far better than if I had gone out to 
get some such expression for myself.
<P>
"We will buy a picture just now and then," she said, "sometimes--
when we see one."
<P>
I would come back through the January mire or fog from Vincent 
Square to the door of 79, and reach it at last with a quite childish 
appreciation of the fact that its solid Georgian proportions and its 
fine brass furnishings belonged to MY home; I would use my latchkey 
and discover Margaret in the warm-lit, spacious hall with a 
partially opened packing-case, fatigued but happy, or go up to have 
tea with her out of the right tea things, "come at last," or be told 
to notice what was fresh there.  It wasn't simply that I had never 
had a house before, but I had really never been, except in the most 
transitory way, in any house that was nearly so delightful as mine 
promised to be.  Everything was fresh and bright, and softly and 
harmoniously toned.  Downstairs we had a green dining-room with 
gleaming silver, dark oak, and English colour-prints; above was a 
large drawing-room that could be made still larger by throwing open 
folding doors, and it was all carefully done in greys and blues, for 
the most part with real Sheraton supplemented by Sheraton so 
skilfully imitated by an expert Margaret had discovered as to be 
indistinguishable except to a minute scrutiny.  And for me, above 
this and next to my bedroom, there was a roomy study, with specially 
thick stair-carpet outside and thick carpets in the bedroom overhead 
and a big old desk for me to sit at and work between fire and 
window, and another desk specially made for me by that expert if I 
chose to stand and write, and open bookshelves and bookcases and 
every sort of convenient fitting.  There were electric heaters 
beside the open fire, and everything was put for me to make tea at 
any time--electric kettle, infuser, biscuits and fresh butter, so 
that I could get up and work at any hour of the day or night.  I 
could do no work in this apartment for a long time, I was so 
interested in the perfection of its arrangements.  And when I 
brought in my books and papers from Vincent Square, Margaret seized 
upon all the really shabby volumes and had them re-bound in a fine 
official-looking leather.
<P>
I can remember sitting down at that desk and looking round me and 
feeling with a queer effect of surprise that after all even a place 
in the Cabinet, though infinitely remote, was nevertheless in the 
same large world with these fine and quietly expensive things.
<P>
On the same floor Margaret had a "den," a very neat and pretty den 
with good colour-prints of Botticellis and Carpaccios, and there was 
a third apartment for sectarial purposes should the necessity for 
them arise, with a severe-looking desk equipped with patent files.  
And Margaret would come flitting into the room to me, or appear 
noiselessly standing, a tall gracefully drooping form, in the wide 
open doorway.  "Is everything right, dear?" she would ask.
<P>
"Come in," I would say, "I'm sorting out papers."
<P>
She would come to the hearthrug.
<P>
"I mustn't disturb you," she would remark.
<P>
"I'm not busy yet."
<P>
"Things are getting into order.  Then we must make out a time-table 
as the Baileys do, and BEGIN!"
<P>
Altiora came in to see us once or twice, and a number of serious 
young wives known to Altiora called and were shown over the house, 
and discussed its arrangements with Margaret.  They were all 
tremendously keen on efficient arrangements.
<P>
"A little pretty," said Altiora, with the faintest disapproval, 
"still--"
<P>
It was clear she thought we should grow out of that.  From the day 
of our return we found other people's houses open to us and eager 
for us.  We went out of London for week-ends and dined out, and 
began discussing our projects for reciprocating these hospitalities.  
As a single man unattached, I had had a wide and miscellaneous 
social range, but now I found myself falling into place in a set.  
For a time I acquiesced in this.  I went very little to my clubs, 
the Climax and the National Liberal, and participated in no bachelor 
dinners at all.  For a time, too, I dropped out of the garrulous 
literary and journalistic circles I had frequented.  I put up for 
the Reform, not so much for the use of the club as a sign of serious 
and substantial political standing.  I didn't go up to Cambridge, I 
remember, for nearly a year, so occupied was I with my new 
adjustments.
<P>
The people we found ourselves among at this time were people, to put 
it roughly, of the Parliamentary candidate class, or people already 
actually placed in the political world.  They ranged between very 
considerable wealth and such a hard, bare independence as old 
Willersley and the sister who kept house for him possessed.  There 
were quite a number of young couples like ourselves, a little 
younger and more artless, or a little older and more established.  
Among the younger men I had a sort of distinction because of my 
Cambridge reputation and my writing, and because, unlike them, I was 
an adventurer and had won and married my way into their circles 
instead of being naturally there.  They couldn't quite reckon upon 
what I should do; they felt I had reserves of experience and 
incalculable traditions.  Close to us were the Cramptons, Willie 
Crampton, who has since been Postmaster-General, rich and very 
important in Rockshire, and his younger brother Edward, who has 
specialised in history and become one of those unimaginative men of 
letters who are the glory of latter-day England.  Then there was 
Lewis, further towards Kensington, where his cousins the Solomons 
and the Hartsteins lived, a brilliant representative of his race, 
able, industrious and invariably uninspired, with a wife a little in 
revolt against the racial tradition of feminine servitude and 
inclined to the suffragette point of view, and Bunting Harblow, an 
old blue, and with an erratic disposition well under the control of 
the able little cousin he had married.  I had known all these men, 
but now (with Altiora floating angelically in benediction) they 
opened their hearts to me and took me into their order.  They were 
all like myself, prospective Liberal candidates, with a feeling that 
the period of wandering in the wilderness of opposition was drawing 
near its close.  They were all tremendously keen upon social and 
political service, and all greatly under the sway of the ideal of a 
simple, strenuous life, a life finding its satisfactions in 
political achievements and distinctions.  The young wives were as 
keen about it as the young husbands, Margaret most of all, and I--
whatever elements in me didn't march with the attitudes and habits 
of this set were very much in the background during that time.
<P>
We would give little dinners and have evening gatherings at which 
everything was very simple and very good, with a slight but 
perceptible austerity, and there was more good fruit and flowers and 
less perhaps in the way of savouries, patties and entrees than was 
customary.  Sherry we banished, and Marsala and liqueurs, and there 
was always good home-made lemonade available.  No men waited, but 
very expert parlourmaids.  Our meat was usually Welsh mutton--I 
don't know why, unless that mountains have ever been the last refuge 
of the severer virtues.  And we talked politics and books and ideas 
and Bernard Shaw (who was a department by himself and supposed in 
those days to be ethically sound at bottom), and mingled with the 
intellectuals--I myself was, as it were, a promoted intellectual.
<P>
The Cramptons had a tendency to read good things aloud on their less 
frequented receptions, but I have never been able to participate 
submissively in this hyper-digestion of written matter, and 
generally managed to provoke a disruptive debate.  We were all very 
earnest to make the most of ourselves and to be and do, and I wonder 
still at times, with an unassuaged perplexity, how it is that in 
that phase of utmost earnestness I have always seemed to myself to 
be most remote from reality.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I look back now across the detaching intervention of sixteen crowded 
years, critically and I fancy almost impartially, to those 
beginnings of my married life.  I try to recall something near to 
their proper order the developing phases of relationship.  I am 
struck most of all by the immense unpremeditated, generous-spirited 
insincerities upon which Margaret and I were building.
<P>
It seems to me that here I have to tell perhaps the commonest 
experience of all among married educated people, the deliberate, 
shy, complex effort to fill the yawning gaps in temperament as they 
appear, the sustained, failing attempt to bridge abysses, level 
barriers, evade violent pressures.  I have come these latter years 
of my life to believe that it is possible for a man and woman to be 
absolutely real with one another, to stand naked souled to each 
other, unashamed and unafraid, because of the natural all-glorifying 
love between them.  It is possible to love and be loved untroubling, 
as a bird flies through the air.  But it is a rare and intricate 
chance that brings two people within sight of that essential union, 
and for the majority marriage must adjust itself on other terms.  
Most coupled people never really look at one another.  They look a 
little away to preconceived ideas.  And each from the first days of 
love-making HIDES from the other, is afraid of disappointing, afraid 
of offending, afraid of discoveries in either sense.  They build not 
solidly upon the rock of truth, but upon arches and pillars and 
queer provisional supports that are needed to make a common 
foundation, and below in the imprisoned darknesses, below the fine 
fabric they sustain together begins for each of them a cavernous 
hidden life.  Down there things may be prowling that scarce ever 
peep out to consciousness except in the grey half-light of sleepless 
nights, passions that flash out for an instant in an angry glance 
and are seen no more, starved victims and beautiful dreams bricked 
up to die.  For the most of us there is no jail delivery of those 
inner depths, and the life above goes on to its honourable end.
<P>
I have told how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her.  
Perhaps already unintentionally I have indicated the quality of the 
injustice our marriage did us both.  There was no kindred between us 
and no understanding.  We were drawn to one another by the 
unlikeness of our quality, by the things we misunderstood in each 
other.  I know a score of couples who have married in that fashion.
<P>
Modern conditions and modern ideas, and in particular the intenser 
and subtler perceptions of modern life, press more and more heavily 
upon a marriage tie whose fashion comes from an earlier and less 
discriminating time.  When the wife was her husband's subordinate, 
meeting him simply and uncritically for simple ends, when marriage 
was a purely domestic relationship, leaving thought and the vivid 
things of life almost entirely to the unencumbered man, mental and 
temperamental incompatibilities mattered comparatively little.  But 
now the wife, and particularly the loving childless wife, 
unpremeditatedly makes a relentless demand for a complete 
association, and the husband exacts unthought of delicacies of 
understanding and co-operation.  These are stupendous demands.  
People not only think more fully and elaborately about life than 
they ever did before, but marriage obliges us to make that ever more 
accidented progress a three-legged race of carelessly assorted 
couples. . . .
<P>
Our very mental texture was different.  I was rough-minded, to use 
the phrase of William James, primary and intuitive and illogical; 
she was tender-minded, logical, refined and secondary.  She was 
loyal to pledge and persons, sentimental and faithful; I am loyal to 
ideas and instincts, emotional and scheming.  My imagination moves 
in broad gestures; her's was delicate with a real dread of 
extravagance.  My quality is sensuous and ruled by warm impulses; 
hers was discriminating and essentially inhibitory.  I like the 
facts of the case and to mention everything; I like naked bodies and 
the jolly smells of things.  She abounded in reservations, in 
circumlocutions and evasions, in keenly appreciated secondary 
points.  Perhaps the reader knows that Tintoretto in the National 
Gallery, the Origin of the Milky Way.  It is an admirable test of 
tempera-mental quality.  In spite of my early training I have come 
to regard that picture as altogether delightful; to Margaret it has 
always been "needlessly offensive."  In that you have our 
fundamental breach.  She had a habit, by no means rare, of damning 
what she did not like or find sympathetic in me on the score that it 
was not my "true self," and she did not so much accept the universe 
as select from it and do her best to ignore the rest.  And also I 
had far more initiative than had she.  This is no catalogue of 
rights and wrongs, or superiorities and inferiorities; it is a 
catalogue of differences between two people linked in a relationship 
that constantly becomes more intolerant of differences.
<P>
This is how we stood to each other, and none of it was clear to 
either of us at the outset.  To begin with, I found myself reserving 
myself from her, then slowly apprehending a jarring between our 
minds and what seemed to me at first a queer little habit of 
misunderstanding in her. . . .
<P>
It did not hinder my being very fond of her. . . .
<P>
Where our system of reservation became at once most usual and most 
astounding was in our personal relations.  It is not too much to say 
that in that regard we never for a moment achieved sincerity with 
one another during the first six years of our life together.  It 
goes even deeper than that, for in my effort to realise the ideal of 
my marriage I ceased even to attempt to be sincere with myself.  I 
would not admit my own perceptions and interpretations.  I tried to 
fit myself to her thinner and finer determinations.  There are 
people who will say with a note of approval that I was learning to 
conquer myself.  I record that much without any note of approval. . . .
<P>
For some years I never deceived Margaret about any concrete fact 
nor, except for the silence about my earlier life that she had 
almost forced upon me, did I hide any concrete fact that seemed to 
affect her, but from the outset I was guilty of immense spiritual 
concealments, my very marriage was based, I see now, on a spiritual 
subterfuge; I hid moods from her, pretended feelings. . . .
<P>

The interest and excitement of setting-up a house, of walking about 
it from room to room and from floor to floor, or sitting at one's 
own dinner table and watching one's wife control conversation with a 
pretty, timid resolution, of taking a place among the secure and 
free people of our world, passed almost insensibly into the interest 
and excitement of my Parliamentary candidature for the Kinghamstead 
Division, that shapeless chunk of agricultural midland between the 
Great Western and the North Western railways.  I was going to "take 
hold" at last, the Kinghamstead Division was my appointed handle.  I 
was to find my place in the rather indistinctly sketched 
constructions that were implicit in the minds of all our circle.  
The precise place I had to fill and the precise functions I had to 
discharge were not as yet very clear, but all that, we felt sure, 
would become plain as things developed.
<P>
A few brief months of vague activities of "nursing" gave place to 
the excitements of the contest that followed the return of Mr. 
Camphell-Bannerman to power in 1905.  So far as the Kinghamstead 
Division was concerned it was a depressed and tepid battle.  I went 
about the constituency making three speeches that were soon 
threadbare, and an odd little collection of people worked for me; 
two solicitors, a cheap photographer, a democratic parson, a number 
of dissenting ministers, the Mayor of Kinghamstead, a Mrs. Bulger, 
the widow of an old Chartist who had grown rich through electric 
traction patents, Sir Roderick Newton, a Jew who had bought 
Calersham Castle, and old Sir Graham Rivers, that sturdy old 
soldier, were among my chief supporters.  We had headquarters in 
each town and village, mostly there were empty shops we leased 
temporarily, and there at least a sort of fuss and a coming and 
going were maintained.  The rest of the population stared in a state 
of suspended judgment as we went about the business.  The country 
was supposed to be in a state of intellectual conflict and 
deliberate decision, in history it will no doubt figure as a 
momentous conflict.  Yet except for an occasional flare of bill-
sticking or a bill in a window or a placard-plastered motor-car or 
an argumentative group of people outside a public-house or a 
sluggish movement towards the schoolroom or village hall, there was 
scarcely a sign that a great empire was revising its destinies.  Now 
and then one saw a canvasser on a doorstep.  For the most part 
people went about their business with an entirely irresponsible 
confidence in the stability of the universe.  At times one felt a 
little absurd with one's flutter of colours and one's air of saving 
the country.
<P>
My opponent was a quite undistinguished Major-General who relied 
upon his advocacy of Protection, and was particularly anxious we 
should avoid "personalities" and fight the constituency in a 
gentlemanly spirit.  He was always writing me notes, apologising for 
excesses on the part of his supporters, or pointing out the 
undesirability of some course taken by mine.
<P>
My speeches had been planned upon broad lines, but they lost touch 
with these as the polling approached.  To begin with I made a real 
attempt to put what was in my mind before the people I was to supply 
with a political voice.  I spoke of the greatness of our empire and 
its destinies, of the splendid projects and possibilities of life 
and order that lay before the world, of all that a resolute and 
constructive effort might do at the present time.  "We are building 
a state," I said, "secure and splendid, we are in the dawn of the 
great age of mankind."  Sometimes that would get a solitary "'Ear! 
'ear!"  Then having created, as I imagined, a fine atmosphere, I 
turned upon the history of the last Conservative administration and 
brought it into contrast with the wide occasions of the age; 
discussed its failure to control the grasping financiers in South 
Africa, its failure to release public education from sectarian 
squabbles, its misconduct of the Boer War, its waste of the world's 
resources. . . .
<P>
It soon became manifest that my opening and my general spaciousness 
of method bored my audiences a good deal.  The richer and wider my 
phrases the thinner sounded my voice in these non-resonating 
gatherings.  Even the platform supporters grew restive 
unconsciously, and stirred and coughed.  They did not recognise 
themselves as mankind.  Building an empire, preparing a fresh stage 
in the history of humanity, had no appeal for them.  They were 
mostly everyday, toiling people, full of small personal solicitudes, 
and they came to my meetings, I think, very largely as a relaxation.  
This stuff was not relaxing.  They did not think politics was a 
great constructive process, they thought it was a kind of dog-fight.  
They wanted fun, they wanted spice, they wanted hits, they wanted 
also a chance to say "'Ear', 'ear!" in an intelligent and honourable 
manner and clap their hands and drum with their feet.  The great 
constructive process in history gives so little scope for clapping 
and drumming and saying "'Ear, 'ear!"  One might as well think of 
hounding on the solar system.
<P>
So after one or two attempts to lift my audiences to the level of 
the issues involved, I began to adapt myself to them.  I cut down my 
review of our imperial outlook and destinies more and more, and 
developed a series of hits and anecdotes and--what shall I call 
them?--"crudifications" of the issue.  My helper's congratulated me 
on the rapid improvement of my platform style.  I ceased to speak of 
the late Prime Minister with the respect I bore him, and began to 
fall in with the popular caricature of him as an artful rabbit-
witted person intent only on keeping his leadership, in spite of the 
vigorous attempts of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain to oust him therefrom.  
I ceased to qualify my statement that Protection would make food 
dearer for the agricultural labourer.  I began to speak of Mr. 
Alfred Lyttelton as an influence at once insane and diabolical, as a 
man inspired by a passionate desire to substitute manacled but still 
criminal Chinese for honest British labourers throughout the world.  
And when it came to the mention of our own kindly leader, of Mr. 
John Burns or any one else of any prominence at all on our side I 
fell more and more into the intonation of one who mentions the high 
gods.  And I had my reward in brighter meetings and readier and 
readier applause.
<P>
One goes on from phase to phase in these things.
<P>
"After all," I told myself, "if one wants to get to Westminster one 
must follow the road that leads there," but I found the road 
nevertheless rather unexpectedly distasteful.  "When one gets 
there," I said, "then it is one begins."
<P>
But I would lie awake at nights with that sore throat and headache 
and fatigue which come from speaking in ill-ventilated rooms, and 
wondering how far it was possible to educate a whole people to great 
political ideals.  Why should political work always rot down to 
personalities and personal appeals in this way?  Life is, I suppose, 
to begin with and end with a matter of personalities, from 
personalities all our broader interests arise and to personalities 
they return.  All our social and political effort, all of it, is 
like trying to make a crowd of people fall into formation.  The 
broader lines appear, but then come a rush and excitement and 
irrelevancy, and forthwith the incipient order has vanished and the 
marshals must begin the work over again!
<P>
My memory of all that time is essentially confusion.  There was a 
frightful lot of tiresome locomotion in it; for the Kinghamstead 
Division is extensive, abounding in ill-graded and badly metalled 
cross-roads and vicious little hills, and singularly unpleasing to 
the eye in a muddy winter.  It is sufficiently near to London to 
have undergone the same process of ill-regulated expansion that made 
Bromstead the place it is.  Several of its overgrown villages have 
developed strings of factories and sidings along the railway lines, 
and there is an abundance of petty villas.  There seemed to be no 
place at which one could take hold of more than this or that element 
of the population.  Now we met in a meeting-house, now in a Masonic 
Hall or Drill Hall; I also did a certain amount of open-air speaking 
in the dinner hour outside gas-works and groups of factories.  Some 
special sort of people was, as it were, secreted in response to each 
special appeal.  One said things carefully adjusted to the 
distinctive limitations of each gathering.  Jokes of an incredible 
silliness and shallowness drifted about us.  Our advisers made us 
declare that if we were elected we would live in the district, and 
one hasty agent had bills printed, "If Mr. Remington is elected he 
will live here."  The enemy obtained a number of these bills and 
stuck them on outhouses, pigstyes, dog-kennels; you cannot imagine 
how irksome the repetition of that jest became.  The vast drifting 
indifference in between my meetings impressed me more and more.  I 
realised the vagueness of my own plans as I had never done before I 
brought them to the test of this experience.  I was perplexed by the 
riddle of just how far I was, in any sense of the word, taking hold 
at all, how far I wasn't myself flowing into an accepted groove.
<P>
Margaret was troubled by no such doubts.  She was clear I had to go 
into Parliament on the side of Liberalism and the light, as against 
the late Government and darkness.  Essential to the memory of my 
first contest, is the memory of her clear bright face, very resolute 
and grave, helping me consciously, steadfastly, with all her 
strength.  Her quiet confidence, while I was so dissatisfied, worked 
curiously towards the alienation of my sympathies.  I felt she had 
no business to be so sure of me.  I had moments of vivid resentment 
at being thus marched towards Parliament.
<P>
I seemed now always to be discovering alien forces of character in 
her.  Her way of taking life diverged from me more and more.  She 
sounded amazing, independent notes.  She bought some particularly 
costly furs for the campaign that roused enthusiasm whenever she 
appeared.  She also made me a birthday present in November of a 
heavily fur-trimmed coat and this she would make me remove as I went 
on to the platform, and hold over her arm until I was ready to 
resume it.  It was fearfully heavy for her and she liked it to be 
heavy for her.  That act of servitude was in essence a towering 
self-assertion.  I would glance sideways while some chairman 
floundered through his introduction and see the clear blue eye with 
which she regarded the audience, which existed so far as she was 
concerned merely to return me to Parliament.  It was a friendly eye, 
provided they were not silly or troublesome.  But it kindled a 
little at the hint of a hostile question.  After we had come so far 
and taken so much trouble!
<P>
She constituted herself the dragoman of our political travels.  In 
hotels she was serenely resolute for the quietest and the best, she 
rejected all their proposals for meals and substituted a severely 
nourishing dietary of her own, and even in private houses she 
astonished me by her tranquil insistence upon special comforts and 
sustenance.  I can see her face now as it would confront a hostess, 
a little intent, but sweetly resolute and assured.
<P>
Since our marriage she had read a number of political memoirs, and 
she had been particularly impressed by the career of Mrs. Gladstone.  
I don't think it occurred to her to compare and contrast my quality 
with that of Mrs. Gladstone's husband.  I suspect her of a 
deliberate intention of achieving parallel results by parallel 
methods.  I was to be Gladstonised.  Gladstone it appeared used to 
lubricate his speeches with a mixture--if my memory serves me right--
of egg beaten up in sherry, and Margaret was very anxious I should 
take a leaf from that celebrated book.  She wanted, I know, to hold 
the glass in her hand while I was speaking.
<P>
But here I was firm.  "No," I said, very decisively, "simply I won't 
stand that.  It's a matter of conscience.  I shouldn't feel--
democratic.  I'll take my chance of the common water in the carafe 
on the chairman's table."
<P>
"I DO wish you wouldn't," she said, distressed.
<P>
It was absurd to feel irritated; it was so admirable of her, a 
little childish, infinitely womanly and devoted and fine--and I see 
now how pathetic.  But I could not afford to succumb to her.  I 
wanted to follow my own leading, to see things clearly, and this 
reassuring pose of a high destiny, of an almost terribly efficient 
pursuit of a fixed end when as a matter of fact I had a very 
doubtful end and an aim as yet by no means fixed, was all too 
seductive for dalliance. . . .
<P>

And into all these things with the manner of a trifling and casual 
incident comes the figure of Isabel Rivers.  My first impressions of 
her were of a rather ugly and ungainly, extraordinarily interesting 
schoolgirl with a beautiful quick flush under her warm brown skin, 
who said and did amusing and surprising things.  When first I saw 
her she was riding a very old bicycle downhill with her feet on the 
fork of the frame--it seemed to me to the public danger, but 
afterwards I came to understand the quality of her nerve better--and 
on the third occasion she was for her own private satisfaction 
climbing a tree.  On the intervening occasion we had what seems now 
to have been a long sustained conversation about the political 
situation and the books and papers I had written.
<P>
I wonder if it was.
<P>
What a delightful mixture of child and grave woman she was at that 
time, and how little I reckoned on the part she would play in my 
life!  And since she has played that part, how impossible it is to 
tell now of those early days!  Since I wrote that opening paragraph 
to this section my idle pen has been, as it were, playing by itself 
and sketching faces on the blotting pad--one impish wizened visage 
is oddly like little Bailey--and I have been thinking cheek on fist 
amidst a limitless wealth of memories.  She sits below me on the low 
wall under the olive trees with our little child in her arms.  She 
is now the central fact in my life.  It still seems a little 
incredible that that should be so.  She has destroyed me as a 
politician, brought me to this belated rebeginning of life.  When I 
sit down and try to make her a girl again, I feel like the Arabian 
fisherman who tried to put the genius back into the pot from which 
it had spread gigantic across the skies. . . .
<P>
I have a very clear vision of her rush downhill past our labouring 
ascendant car--my colours fluttered from handle-bar and shoulder-
knot--and her waving hand and the sharp note of her voice.  She 
cried out something, I don't know what, some greeting.
<P>
"What a pretty girl!" said Margaret.
<P>
Parvill, the cheap photographer, that industrious organiser for whom 
by way of repayment I got those magic letters, that knighthood of 
the underlings, "J. P." was in the car with us and explained her to 
us.  "One of the best workers you have," he said. . . .
<P>
And then after a toilsome troubled morning we came, rather cross 
from the strain of sustained amiability, to Sir Graham Rivers' 
house.  It seemed all softness and quiet--I recall dead white 
panelling and oval mirrors horizontally set and a marble fireplace 
between white marble-blind Homer and marble-blind Virgil, very grave 
and fine--and how Isabel came in to lunch in a shapeless thing like 
a blue smock that made her bright quick-changing face seem yellow 
under her cloud of black hair.  Her step-sister was there, Miss 
Gamer, to whom the house was to descend, a well-dressed lady of 
thirty, amiably disavowing responsibility for Isabel in every phrase 
and gesture.  And there was a very pleasant doctor, an Oxford man, 
who seemed on excellent terms with every one.  It was manifest that 
he was in the habit of sparring with the girl, but on this occasion 
she wasn't sparring and refused to be teased into a display in spite 
of the taunts of either him or her father.  She was, they discovered 
with rising eyebrows, shy.  It seemed an opportunity too rare for 
them to miss.  They proclaimed her enthusiasm for me in a way that 
brought a flush to her cheek and a look into her eye between appeal 
and defiance.  They declared she had read my books, which I thought 
at the time was exaggeration, their dry political quality was so 
distinctly not what one was accustomed to regard as schoolgirl 
reading.  Miss Gamer protested to protect her, "When once in a blue 
moon Isabel is well-behaved. . . .!"
<P>
Except for these attacks I do not remember much of the conversation 
at table; it was, I know, discursive and concerned with the sort of 
topographical and social and electioneering fact natural to such a 
visit.  Old Rivers struck me as a delightful person, modestly 
unconscious of his doubly-earned V. C. and the plucky defence of 
Kardin-Bergat that won his baronetcy.  He was that excellent type, 
the soldier radical, and we began that day a friendship that was 
only ended by his death in the hunting-field three years later.  He 
interested Margaret into a disregard of my plate and the fact that I 
had secured the illegal indulgence of Moselle.  After lunch we went 
for coffee into another low room, this time brown panelled and 
looking through French windows on a red-walled garden, graceful even 
in its winter desolation.  And there the conversation suddenly 
picked up and became good.  It had fallen to a pause, and the 
doctor, with an air of definitely throwing off a mask and wrecking 
an established tranquillity, remarked: "Very probably you Liberals 
will come in, though I'm not sure you'll come in so mightily as you 
think, but what you do when you do come in passes my comprehension."
<P>
"There's good work sometimes," said Sir Graham, "in undoing."
<P>
"You can't govern a great empire by amending and repealing the Acts 
of your predecessors," said the doctor.
<P>
There came that kind of pause that happens when a subject is 
broached too big and difficult for the gathering.  Margaret's blue 
eyes regarded the speaker with quiet disapproval for a moment, and 
then came to me in the not too confident hope that I would snub him 
out of existence with some prompt rhetorical stroke.  A voice spoke 
out of the big arm-chair.
<P>
"We'll do things," said Isabel.
<P>
The doctor's eye lit with the joy of the fisherman who strikes his 
fish at last.  "What will you do?" he asked her.
<P>
"Every one knows we're a mixed lot," said Isabel.
<P>
"Poor old chaps like me!" interjected the general.
<P>
"But that's not a programme," said the doctor.
<P>
"But Mr. Remington has published a programme," said Isabel.
<P>
The doctor cocked half an eye at me.
<P>
"In some review," the girl went on.  "After all, we're not going to 
elect the whole Liberal party in the Kinghamstead Division.  I'm a 
Remington-ite!"
<P>
"But the programme," said the doctor, "the programme--"
<P>
"In front of Mr. Remington!"
<P>
"Scandal always comes home at last," said the doctor.  "Let him hear 
the worst."
<P>
"I'd like to hear," I said.  "Electioneering shatters convictions 
and enfeebles the mind."
<P>
"Not mine," said Isabel stoutly.  "I mean--Well, anyhow I take it 
Mr. Remington stands for constructing a civilised state out of this 
muddle."
<P>
"THIS muddle," protested the doctor with an appeal of the eye to the 
beautiful long room and the ordered garden outside the bright clean 
windows.
<P>
"Well, THAT muddle, if you like!  There's a slum within a mile of us 
already.  The dust and blacks get worse and worse, Sissie?"
<P>
"They do," agreed Miss Gamer.
<P>
"Mr. Remington stands for construction, order, education, discipline."
<P>
"And you?" said the doctor.
<P>
"I'm a good Remington-ite."
<P>
"Discipline!" said the doctor.
<P>
"Oh!" said Isabel.  "At times one has to be--Napoleonic.  They want 
to libel me, Mr. Remington.  A political worker can't always be in 
time for meals, can she?  At times one has to make--splendid cuts."
<P>
Miss Gamer said something indistinctly.
<P>
"Order, education, discipline," said Sir Graham.  "Excellent things!  
But I've a sort of memory--in my young days--we talked about 
something called liberty."
<P>
"Liberty under the law," I said, with an unexpected approving murmur 
from Margaret, and took up the defence.  "The old Liberal definition 
of liberty was a trifle uncritical.  Privilege and legal 
restrictions are not the only enemies of liberty.  An uneducated, 
underbred, and underfed propertyless man is a man who has lost the 
possibility of liberty.  There's no liberty worth a rap for him.  A 
man who is swimming hopelessly for life wants nothing but the 
liberty to get out of the water; he'll give every other liberty for 
it--until he gets out."
<P>
Sir Graham took me up and we fell into a discussion of the changing 
qualities of Liberalism.  It was a good give-and-take talk, 
extraordinarily refreshing after the nonsense and crowding secondary 
issues of the electioneering outside.  We all contributed more or 
less except Miss Gamer; Margaret followed with knitted brows and 
occasional interjections.  "People won't SEE that," for example, and 
"It all seems so plain to me."  The doctor showed himself clever but 
unsubstantial and inconsistent.  Isabel sat back with her black mop 
of hair buried deep in the chair looking quickly from face to face.  
Her colour came and went with her vivid intellectual excitement; 
occasionally she would dart a word, usually a very apt word, like a 
lizard's tongue into the discussion.  I remember chiefly that a 
chance illustration betrayed that she had read Bishop Burnet. . . .
<P>
After that it was not surprising that Isabel should ask for a lift 
in our car as far as the Lurky Committee Room, and that she should 
offer me quite sound advice EN ROUTE upon the intellectual 
temperament of the Lurky gasworkers.
<P>
On the third occasion that I saw Isabel she was, as I have said, 
climbing a tree--and a very creditable tree--for her own private 
satisfaction.  It was a lapse from the high seriousness of politics, 
and I perceived she felt that I might regard it as such and attach 
too much importance to it.  I had some difficulty in reassuring her.  
And it's odd to note now--it has never occurred to me before--that 
from that day to this I do not think I have ever reminded Isabel of 
that encounter.
<P>
And after that memory she seems to be flickering about always in the 
election, an inextinguishable flame; now she flew by on her bicycle, 
now she dashed into committee rooms, now she appeared on doorsteps 
in animated conversation with dubious voters; I took every chance I 
could to talk to her--I had never met anything like her before in 
the world, and she interested me immensely--and before the polling 
day she and I had become, in the frankest simplicity, fast 
friends. . . .
<P>
That, I think, sets out very fairly the facts of our early 
relationship.  But it is hard to get it true, either in form or 
texture, because of the bright, translucent, coloured, and 
refracting memories that come between.  One forgets not only the 
tint and quality of thoughts and impressions through that 
intervening haze, one forgets them altogether.  I don't remember now 
that I ever thought in those days of passionate love or the 
possibility of such love between us.  I may have done so again and 
again.  But I doubt it very strongly.  I don't think I ever thought 
of such aspects.  I had no more sense of any danger between us, 
seeing the years and things that separated us, than I could have had 
if she had been an intelligent bright-eyed bird.  Isabel came into 
my life as a new sort of thing; she didn't join on at all to my 
previous experiences of womanhood.  They were not, as I have 
laboured to explain, either very wide or very penetrating 
experiences, on the whole, "strangled dinginess" expresses them, but 
I do not believe they were narrower or shallower than those of many 
other men of my class.  I thought of women as pretty things and 
beautiful things, pretty rather than beautiful, attractive and at 
times disconcertingly attractive, often bright and witty, but, 
because of the vast reservations that hid them from me, wanting, 
subtly and inevitably wanting, in understanding.  My idealisation of 
Margaret had evaporated insensibly after our marriage.  The shrine I 
had made for her in my private thoughts stood at last undisguisedly 
empty.  But Isabel did not for a moment admit of either idealisation 
or interested contempt.  She opened a new sphere of womanhood to me.  
With her steady amber-brown eyes, her unaffected interest in 
impersonal things, her upstanding waistless blue body, her energy, 
decision and courage, she seemed rather some new and infinitely 
finer form of boyhood than a feminine creature, as I had come to 
measure femininity.  She was my perfect friend.  Could I have 
foreseen, had my world been more wisely planned, to this day we 
might have been such friends.
<P>
She seemed at that time unconscious of sex, though she has told me 
since how full she was of protesting curiosities and restrained 
emotions.  She spoke, as indeed she has always spoken, simply, 
clearly, and vividly; schoolgirl slang mingled with words that 
marked ample voracious reading, and she moved quickly with the free 
directness of some graceful young animal.  She took many of the easy 
freedoms a man or a sister might have done with me.  She would touch 
my arm, lay a hand on my shoulder as I sat, adjust the lapel of a 
breast-pocket as she talked to me.  She says now she loved me always 
from the beginning.  I doubt if there was a suspicion of that in her 
mind those days.  I used to find her regarding me with the clearest, 
steadiest gaze in the world, exactly like the gaze of some nice 
healthy innocent animal in a forest, interested, inquiring, 
speculative, but singularly untroubled. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Polling day came after a last hoarse and dingy crescendo.  The 
excitement was not of the sort that makes one forget one is tired 
out.  The waiting for the end of the count has left a long blank 
mark on my memory, and then everyone was shaking my hand and 
repeating: "Nine hundred and seventy-six."
<P>
My success had been a foregone conclusion since the afternoon, but 
we all behaved as though we had not been anticipating this result 
for hours, as though any other figures but nine hundred and seventy-
six would have meant something entirely different.  "Nine hundred 
and seventy-six!" said Margaret.  "They didn't expect three 
hundred."
<P>
"Nine hundred and seventy-six," said a little short man with a 
paper.  "It means a big turnover.  Two dozen short of a thousand, 
you know."
<P>
A tremendous hullaboo began outside, and a lot of fresh people came 
into the room.
<P>
Isabel, flushed but not out of breath, Heaven knows where she had 
sprung from at that time of night! was running her hand down my 
sleeve almost caressingly, with the innocent bold affection of a 
girl.  "Got you in!" she said.  "It's been no end of a lark."
<P>
"And now," said I, "I must go and be constructive."
<P>
"Now you must go and be constructive," she said.
<P>
"You've got to live here," she added.
<P>
"By Jove! yes," I said.  "We'll have to house hunt."
<P>
"I shall read all your speeches."
<P>
She hesitated.
<P>
"I wish I was you," she said, and said it as though it was not 
exactly the thing she was meaning to say.
<P>
"They want you to speak," said Margaret, with something unsaid in 
her face.
<P>
"You must come out with me," I answered, putting my arm through 
hers, and felt someone urging me to the French windows that gave on 
the balcony.
<P>
"If you think--" she said, yielding gladly
<P>
"Oh, RATHER!" said I.
<P>
The Mayor of Kinghamstead, a managing little man with no great 
belief in my oratorical powers, was sticking his face up to mine.
<P>
"It's all over," he said, " and you've won.  Say all the nice things 
you can and say them plainly."
<P>
I turned and handed Margaret out through the window and stood 
looking over the Market-place, which was more than half filled with 
swaying people.  The crowd set up a roar of approval at the sight of 
us, tempered by a little booing.  Down in one corner of the square a 
fight was going on for a flag, a fight that even the prospect of a 
speech could not instantly check.  "Speech!" cried voices, "Speech!" 
and then a brief "boo-oo-oo" that was drowned in a cascade of shouts 
and cheers.  The conflict round the flag culminated in the smashing 
of a pane of glass in the chemist's window and instantly sank to 
peace.
<P>
"Gentlemen voters of the Kinghamstead Division," I began.
<P>
"Votes for Women!" yelled a voice, amidst laughter--the first time I 
remember hearing that memorable war-cry.
<P>
"Three cheers for Mrs. Remington!"
<P>
"Mrs. Remington asks me to thank you," I said, amidst further uproar 
and reiterated cries of "Speech!"
<P>
Then silence came with a startling swiftness.
<P>
Isabel was still in my mind, I suppose.  "I shall go to 
Westminster," I began.  I sought for some compelling phrase and 
could not find one.  "To do my share," I went on, "in building up a 
great and splendid civilisation."
<P>
I paused, and there was a weak gust of cheering, and then a renewal 
of booing.
<P>
"This election," I said, " has been the end and the beginning of 
much.  New ideas are abroad--"
<P>
"Chinese labour," yelled a voice, and across the square swept a 
wildfire of booting and bawling.
<P>
It is one of the few occasions when I quite lost my hold on a 
speech.  I glanced sideways and saw the Mayor of Kinghamstead 
speaking behind his hand to Parvill.  By a happy chance Parvill 
caught my eye.
<P>
"What do they want?" I asked.
<P>
"Eh?"
<P>
"What do they want?"
<P>
"Say something about general fairness--the other side," prompted 
Parvill, flattered but a little surprised by my appeal.  I pulled 
myself hastily into a more popular strain with a gross eulogy of my 
opponent's good taste.
<P>
"Chinese labour!" cried the voice again.
<P>
"You've given that notice to quit," I answered.
<P>
The Market-place roared delight, but whether that delight expressed 
hostility to Chinamen or hostility to their practical enslavement no 
student of the General Election of 1906 has ever been able to 
determine.  Certainly one of the most effective posters on our side 
displayed a hideous yellow face, just that and nothing more.  There 
was not even a legend to it.  How it impressed the electorate we did 
not know, but that it impressed the electorate profoundly there can 
be no disputing.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
Kinghamstead was one of the earliest constituencies fought, and we 
came back--it must have been Saturday--triumphant but very tired, to 
our house in Radnor Square.  In the train we read the first 
intimations that the victory of our party was likely to be a 
sweeping one.
<P>
Then came a period when one was going about receiving and giving 
congratulations and watching the other men arrive, very like a boy 
who has returned to school with the first batch after the holidays.  
The London world reeked with the General Election; it had invaded 
the nurseries.  All the children of one's friends had got big maps 
of England cut up into squares to represent constituencies and were 
busy sticking gummed blue labels over the conquered red of Unionism 
that had hitherto submerged the country.  And there were also orange 
labels, if I remember rightly, to represent the new Labour party, 
and green for the Irish.  I engaged myself to speak at one or two 
London meetings, and lunched at the Reform, which was fairly tepid, 
and dined and spent one or two tumultuous evenings at the National 
Liberal Club, which was in active eruption.  The National Liberal 
became feverishly congested towards midnight as the results of the 
counting came dropping in.  A big green-baize screen had been fixed 
up at one end of the large smoking-room with the names of the 
constituencies that were voting that day, and directly the figures 
came to hand, up they went, amidst cheers that at last lost their 
energy through sheer repetition, whenever there was record of a 
Liberal gain.  I don't remember what happened when there was a 
Liberal loss; I don't think that any were announced while I was 
there.
<P>
How packed and noisy the place was, and what a reek of tobacco and 
whisky fumes we made!  Everybody was excited and talking, making 
waves of harsh confused sound that beat upon one's ears, and every 
now and then hoarse voices would shout for someone to speak.  Our 
little set was much in evidence.  Both the Cramptons were in, Lewis, 
Bunting Harblow.  We gave brief addresses attuned to this excitement 
and the late hour, amidst much enthusiasm.
<P>
Now we can DO things!" I said amidst a rapture of applause.  Men I 
did not know from Adam held up glasses and nodded to me in solemn 
fuddled approval as I came down past them into the crowd again.
<P>
Men were betting whether the Unionists would lose more or less than 
two hundred seats.
<P>
"I wonder just what we shall do with it all," I heard one sceptic 
speculating. . . .
<P>
After these orgies I would get home very tired and excited, and find 
it difficult to get to sleep.  I would lie and speculate about what 
it was we WERE going to do.  One hadn't anticipated quite such a 
tremendous accession to power for one's party.  Liberalism was 
swirling in like a flood. . . .
<P>
I found the next few weeks very unsatisfactory and distressing.  I 
don't clearly remember what it was I had expected; I suppose the 
fuss and strain of the General Election had built up a feeling that 
my return would in some way put power into my hands, and instead I 
found myself a mere undistinguished unit in a vast but rather vague 
majority.  There were moments when I felt very distinctly that a 
majority could be too big a crowd altogether.  I had all my work 
still before me, I had achieved nothing as yet but opportunity, and 
a very crowded opportunity it was at that.  Everyone about me was 
chatting Parliament and appointments; one breathed distracting and 
irritating speculations as to what would be done and who would be 
asked to do it.  I was chiefly impressed by what was unlikely to be 
done and by the absence of any general plan of legislation to hold 
us all together.  I found the talk about Parliamentary procedure and 
etiquette particularly trying.  We dined with the elder Cramptons 
one evening, and old Sir Edward was lengthily sage about what the 
House liked, what it didn't like, what made a good impression and 
what a bad one.  "A man shouldn't speak more than twice in his first 
session, and not at first on too contentious a topic," said Sir 
Edward.  "No."
<P>
"Very much depends on manner.  The House hates a lecturer.  There's 
a sort of airy earnestness--"
<P>
He waved his cigar to eke out his words.
<P>
"Little peculiarities of costume count for a great deal.  I could 
name one man who spent three years living down a pair of 
spatterdashers.  On the other hand--a thing like that--if it catches 
the eye of the PUNCH man, for example, may be your making."
<P>
He went off into a lengthy speculation of why the House had come to 
like an originally unpopular Irishman named Biggar. . . .
<P>
The opening of Parliament gave me some peculiar moods.  I began to 
feel more and more like a branded sheep.  We were sworn in in 
batches, dozens and scores of fresh men, trying not to look too 
fresh under the inspection of policemen and messengers, all of us 
carrying new silk hats and wearing magisterial coats.  It is one of 
my vivid memories from this period, the sudden outbreak of silk hats 
in the smoking-room of the National Liberal Club.  At first I 
thought there must have been a funeral.  Familiar faces that one had 
grown to know under soft felt hats, under bowlers, under liberal-
minded wide brims, and above artistic ties and tweed jackets, 
suddenly met one, staring with the stern gaze of self-consciousness, 
from under silk hats of incredible glossiness.  There was a 
disposition to wear the hat much too forward, I thought, for a good 
Parliamentary style.
<P>
There was much play with the hats all through; a tremendous 
competition to get in first and put hats on coveted seats.  A memory 
hangs about me of the House in the early afternoon, an inhumane 
desolation inhabited almost entirely by silk hats.  The current use 
of cards to secure seats came later.  There were yards and yards of 
empty green benches with hats and hats and hats distributed along 
them, resolute-looking top hats, lax top hats with a kind of shadowy 
grin under them, sensible top bats brim upward, and one scandalous 
incontinent that had rolled from the front Opposition bench right to 
the middle of the floor.  A headless hat is surely the most soulless 
thing in the world, far worse even than a skull. . . .
<P>
At last, in a leisurely muddled manner we got to the Address; and I 
found myself packed in a dense elbowing crowd to the right of the 
Speaker's chair; while the attenuated Opposition, nearly leaderless 
after the massacre, tilted its brim to its nose and sprawled at its 
ease amidst its empty benches.
<P>
There was a tremendous hullaboo about something, and I craned to see 
over the shoulder of the man in front.  ''Order, order, order!"
<P>
"What's it about?" I asked.
<P>
The man in front of me was clearly no better informed, and then I 
gathered from a slightly contemptuous Scotchman beside me that it 
was Chris Robinson had walked between the bonourable member in 
possession of the house and the Speaker.  I caught a glimpse of him 
blushingly whispering about his misadventure to a colleague.  He was 
just that same little figure I had once assisted to entertain at 
Cambridge, but grey-haired now, and still it seemed with the same 
knitted muffler he had discarded for a reckless half-hour while he 
talked to us in Hatherleigh's rooms.
<P>
It dawned upon me that I wasn't particularly wanted in the House, 
and that I should get all I needed of the opening speeches next day 
from the TIMES.
<P>
I made my way out and was presently walking rather aimlessly through 
the outer lobby.
<P>
I caught myself regarding the shadow that spread itself out before 
me, multiplied itself in blue tints of various intensity, shuffled 
itself like a pack of cards under the many lights, the square 
shoulders, the silk hat, already worn with a parliamentary tilt 
backward; I found I was surveying this statesmanlike outline with a 
weak approval.  "A MEMBER!" I felt the little cluster of people that 
were scattered about the lobby must be saying.
<P>
"Good God!" I said in hot reaction, "what am I doing here?"
<P>
It was one of those moments infinitely trivial in themselves, that 
yet are cardinal in a man's life.  It came to me with extreme 
vividness that it wasn't so much that I had got hold of something as 
that something had got hold of me.  I distinctly recall the rebound 
of my mind.  Whatever happened in this Parliament, I at least would 
attempt something.  "By God!" I said, "I won't be overwhelmed.  I am 
here to do something, and do something I will!"
<P>
But I felt that for the moment I could not remain in the House.
<P>
I went out by myself with my thoughts into the night.  It was a 
chilling night, and rare spots of rain were falling.  I glanced over 
my shoulder at the lit windows of the Lords.  I walked, I remember, 
westward, and presently came to the Grosvenar Embankment and 
followed it, watching the glittering black rush of the river and the 
dark, dimly lit barges round which the water swirled.  Across the 
river was the hunched sky-line of Doulton's potteries, and a kiln 
flared redly.  Dimly luminous trams were gliding amidst a dotted 
line of lamps, and two little trains crawled into Waterloo station.  
Mysterious black figures came by me and were suddenly changed to the 
commonplace at the touch of the nearer lamps.  It was a big confused 
world, I felt, for a man to lay his hands upon.
<P>
I remember I crossed Vauxhall Bridge and stood for a time watching 
the huge black shapes in the darkness under the gas-works.  A shoal 
of coal barges lay indistinctly on the darkly shining mud and water 
below, and a colossal crane was perpetually hauling up coal into 
mysterious blacknesses above, and dropping the empty clutch back to 
the barges.  Just one or two minute black featureless figures of men 
toiled amidst these monster shapes.  They did not seem to be 
controlling them but only moving about among them.  These gas-works 
have a big chimney that belches a lurid flame into the night, a 
livid shivering bluish flame, shot with strange crimson streaks. . . .
<P>
On the other side of Lambeth Bridge broad stairs go down to the 
lapping water of the river; the lower steps are luminous under the 
lamps and one treads unwarned into thick soft Thames mud.  They seem 
to be purely architectural steps, they lead nowhere, they have an 
air of absolute indifference to mortal ends.
<P>
Those shapes and large inhuman places--for all of mankind that one 
sees at night about Lambeth is minute and pitiful beside the 
industrial monsters that snort and toil there--mix up inextricably 
with my memories of my first days as a legislator.  Black figures 
drift by me, heavy vans clatter, a newspaper rough tears by on a 
motor bicycle, and presently, on the Albert Embankment, every seat 
has its one or two outcasts huddled together and slumbering.
<P>
"These things come, these things go," a whispering voice urged upon 
me, "as once those vast unmeaning Saurians whose bones encumber 
museums came and went rejoicing noisily in fruitless lives." . . .
<P>
Fruitless lives!--was that the truth of it all? . . .
<P>
Later I stood within sight of the Houses of Parliament in front of 
the colonnades of St Thomas's Hospital.  I leant on the parapet 
close by a lamp-stand of twisted dolphins--and I prayed!
<P>
I remember the swirl of the tide upon the water, and how a string of 
barges presently came swinging and bumping round as high-water 
turned to ebb.  That sudden change of position and my brief 
perplexity at it, sticks like a paper pin through the substance of 
my thoughts.  It was then I was moved to prayer.  I prayed that 
night that life might not be in vain, that in particular I might not 
live in vain.  I prayed for strength and faith, that the monstrous 
blundering forces in life might not overwhelm me, might not beat me 
back to futility and a meaningless acquiescence in existent things.  
I knew myself for the weakling I was, I knew that nevertheless it 
was set for me to make such order as I could out of these disorders, 
and my task cowed me, gave me at the thought of it a sense of 
yielding feebleness.
<P>
"Break me, O God," I prayed at last, "disgrace me, torment me, 
destroy me as you will, but save me from self-complacency and little 
interests and little successes and the life that passes like the 
shadow of a dream."
