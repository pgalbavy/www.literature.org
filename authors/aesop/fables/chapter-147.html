A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried to
capture him.  But the Mouse reached his hole in safety.  Though
the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he
could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep
outside the hole.  The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his
flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole.  The Bull
rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed.  At
which the Mouse said, "The great do not always prevail.  There
are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do
mischief."
