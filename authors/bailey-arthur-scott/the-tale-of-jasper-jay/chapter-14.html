<p>"WHAT can you do?" the other feathered folk asked Buddy Brown-Thrasher,
when he complained about Jasper Jay's rudeness in interrupting his
singing. "You don't intend to <u>fight</u> Jasper, do you?"
</p>
<p>"I think--" replied Buddy--"I think I can find a better way than that."
And that was all he would say.
</p><p>As usual, Jasper came to Buddy Brown-Thrasher's thicket that evening and
screamed his loudest, when Buddy began to sing. Again Buddy's
evening-song was spoiled. And even before the noisy Jasper had left,
Buddy Brown-Thrasher began to lay his plans for putting a stop to
Jasper's unpleasant trick. By the time he fell asleep Buddy knew exactly
what he was going to do the next day.
</p><hr/>
<p>The following morning Buddy Brown-Thrasher was up bright and early--even
earlier than was his habit. And for once in his life he did not pause to
sing his morning-song from his favorite perch in the tree-top. He did
not even wait to have his breakfast, but flew straight to the clump of
young pines where--as he knew--Jasper Jay made his home.
</p><p>It was so early in the morning that a gray light half veiled the
mountains; and a white mist hung over the river. The Jay family was just
beginning to awaken. And soon Buddy heard Jasper's harsh voice calling
to some friend who lived a little distance away.
</p><p>Jasper was still somewhat sleepy. Though Buddy Brown-Thrasher could not
see him, he could hear Jasper talking to his wife in a low tone, which
was quite different from the noisy squawk that people at once thought of
at the mere mention of Jasper Jay's name. And soon a few sweet,
flute-like notes came floating out from Jasper's tree and fell upon the
ears of Buddy Brown-Thrasher, where he lay snugly hidden among the
boughs of a young pine.
</p><p>Buddy was delighted. You see, he was a real music-lover; and seldom had
he heard any sound so beautiful as those rare notes of Jasper Jay's.
</p><p>"Bravo!" Buddy cried, without thinking what he was doing. And in the
next instant Jasper Jay thrust a towsled head through the pine-needles
that screened his sleeping-place.
</p><p>"Who's there?" he shouted in a hoarse and angry voice.
</p><p>Buddy Brown-Thrasher did not answer. He kept still as a mouse. And
waited for some time--hoping to hear Jasper's sweet notes again--but he
waited in vain.
</p><p>But Buddy had heard them once. And since it was for that very purpose
that he had gone without both his breakfast and his morning-song, he was
satisfied. He went home a little later, feeling well pleased, so far,
with his plan for putting an end to Jasper Jay's rudeness.
</p><p>The first thing that Buddy Brown-Thrasher did then was to seek his
favorite perch in the very top of his own special tree and sing a
morning-song that was more joyous than ever. That was because he was
happier than he had been for a long time--ever since Jasper Jay had been
annoying him.
</p><p>When he had sung his song fourteen times, Buddy ate a hearty breakfast.
Feeling as sprightly as he did, he found his appetite unusually keen.
And when at last he had finished his meal he went straight off to make
calls upon his friends.
</p><p>Now, it was no accident that all those upon whom Buddy Brown-Thrasher
called that morning belonged to the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. You
see, Buddy needed help in order to teach Jasper Jay a lesson. And as
soon as his friends heard his plan, they all told him that it was a good
one and that they would be glad to do what they could to teach Jasper
Jay better manners.
