<p>Billy Woodchuck knew that the Great Horned Owl was a dangerous
person. His mother had often told him that. But he had never yet
seen the Great Horned Owl; and Billy wondered how he should know
him if he should ever happen to meet him. So Billy Woodchuck went
indoors and asked his mother to tell him how the Great Horned Owl
looked.
</p>
<p>"He's a big fellow," said Mrs. Woodchuck--"almost as big as the
Great Gray Owl and the Snowy Owl. But you can tell him from them by
his ear-tufts, which stick up from his head like horns."
</p><p>"What color is he?" Billy inquired.
</p><p>"Buff and black," Mrs. Woodchuck answered. "He's mottled--that
means about the same as spotted," she explained. "I've heard him
called the 'tiger among birds.' But whether it's because of the
spots, or because he's so fierce, I really don't know."
</p><p>"Maybe it's <u>both</u>," Billy suggested.
</p><p>"Perhaps!" his mother said. "He has a deep voice," she continued.
"And he calls '_Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, whoo, whoo!<u>' If you heard him
in the woods you might almost think it was old dog Spot barking.
But when he screams"--Mrs. Woodchuck shuddered--"</u>then_ you'll know
him. For his scream is the most dreadful sound that was ever
heard."
</p><p>"I wish you would scream like him once," said Billy.
</p><p>"Bless your heart!" said his mother. "My voice may not be very
sweet, but I never could screech like him."
</p><p>"Why doesn't Johnnie Green shoot him?" Billy asked. "If he only
would, the Great Horned Owl could never trouble us any more."
</p><p>"Why, there's more than just <u>one</u>!" his mother exclaimed. "When I
say 'the Great Horned Owl,' I don't mean just <u>one</u>!"
</p><p>"Oh!" said Billy. That was different. And then he went out to play
again.
</p><p>For a long time he couldn't get the Great Horned Owl out of his
mind. Every time he heard the leaves rustle in the trees he jumped
as if forty Great Horned Owls were after him. But since nothing of
the sort happened, at last he forgot all about that danger. It was
late in the afternoon when a horrid call sent him scurrying off:
</p><p>"_Whoo, hoo-hoo-hoo, whoo, whoo!_"
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck was sure that the Great Horned Owl had found him at
last. He ran a little way as fast as he could; and then he crouched
down in the grass.
</p><p>Again came that deep, long-drawn call. It sent Billy off on another
short run.
</p><p>And after that had happened three times, he was so scared that he
thrust his head under a heap of dried leaves. So long as he
couldn't see the Great Horned Owl, he thought that the Great Horned
Owl couldn't see him.
</p><p>Then Billy heard his mother's voice. She was calling him. And he
looked up quickly. There she was, right beside him!
</p><p>"Did you drive him away, Mother?" he asked.
</p><p>"Whom do you mean?" she inquired.
</p><p>"Why, the Great Horned Owl!" Billy said.
</p><p>"I was the only one that called," she told him. "I wanted to see
what you would do. And I must say, you behaved very foolishly.
Don't ever cover up your head like that. First, you must try to get
away. And if you should get caught, remember that your teeth are
sharp. But they won't be of any use to you with your head buried
under a pile of leaves."
</p><p>Billy Woodchuck saw that he had a great deal to learn. But he was
glad that his mother had taught him that much, though he was
ashamed that he had been so silly.
