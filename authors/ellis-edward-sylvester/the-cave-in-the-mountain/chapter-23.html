<p>As the scout uttered these words, the Apache whirled like lightning
and drew his knife. His swarthy, painted face glowed with passion,
and his black eyes twinkled with a deadly light. Seeing that he
had no weapon but the knife, Sut Simpson, with a certain rude
chivalry that did him credit, left his rifle leaning against the
tree, while he advanced with a weapon corresponding to that of
his enemy, so that both stood upon the same footing.</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf is glad to meet the white dog that he has hunted so
long," said the chieftain, speaking English like a native.</p>

<p>With a sardonic grin Sut replied:</p>

<p>"That's played out, old Pockared"&mdash;alluding to the chieftain's
pitted face. "I'm just as mad at yer as I kin be, without yer
getting up any fancy didoes to upset my nerves. I've come for
yer this time, and the best thing yer kin do is to proceed to
business."</p>

<p>They were facing each other with drawn knives&mdash;almost toe to
toe, and each waiting for the other to lead off. It would have
been hard to tell which stood the best chance of winning.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf suddenly sprang forward like a panther, and made a
vicious lunge with his knife, Sut easily avoiding it by leaping
back, when, in turn, he made a similar attempt upon his adversary,
who escaped in precisely the same manner. But the scout noticed
an unaccountable thing. Lone Wolf had dropped his knife!</p>

<p>True, he picked it up like a flash, and put himself on guard,
but how it was that a veteran like him could have made such a
slip was totally inexplainable to his foe. But the explanation
came the next moment, when the chief, without removing his eyes
from those of the white man, cautiously changed the knife to his
left hand. His right arm was injured in some way, so that it was
unreliable. He had shown this, first by dropping the weapon while
attempting to use it, and he showed it again by shifting it to
his left hand, thus placing himself at a frightful disadvantage.</p>

<p>Sut saw no wound, yet there could be no doubt of the truth, and
his feelings changed on the instant. He felt himself the meanest
of men to attempt to overcome an almost helpless foe.</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf," said he, still looking him straight in the eyes,
"why don't yer hold yer knife in the hand that yer generally do?"</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf can slay the dog of a white man with which hand he
may choose."</p>

<p>"Yer haven't been able to do it with both hands during all these
years that you've been tryin', when yer've had yer whole tribe
to help yer; but don't make a fool of yerself, Lone Wolf. Are
your right arm hurt?"</p>

<p>"Lone Wolf will fight the white dog with his strong arm."</p>

<p>"No, yer don't&mdash;that's played out," growled the scout, shoving
his knife back in his girdle. "I don't love yer 'any more than
I love the devil, and I felt happy to think that I had got a chance
at last to git square with yer; but when I lift the top-knot of
Lone Wolf and slide him under, he's got to have the same chance
that I have. I don't believe you'd act that way toward me; but,
then, you're a redskin, and that makes the difference. Lone Wolf,
we'll adjourn the fight till you're yerself agin."</p>

<p>And, deliberately turning away, the scout vaulted upon the back
of the mustang, cutting the lariat that held him by a sweep of
the knife.</p>

<p>"I s'pose you'll own I've got some claim on this beast; so good-by."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "I S'<em>POSE YOU'LL OWN I'VE GOT SOME CLAIM ON
THIS BEAST</em>."]</p>

<p>And, without turning to look at him again, he rode deliberately
away.</p>

<p>The Apache stood like a statute staring at him until he was hidden
from view by the intervening trees. Then he turned and walked
slowly in the opposite direction, no doubt with strange thoughts
in his brain.</p>

<p>"I don't know how that scamp will take it," muttered Sut, as
he rode along. "He's one of the ugliest dogs that ever wore a
painted face; and if he could catch me with a broken arm or head,
he wouldn't want anything better than to chop me up into mincemeat;
but, as I told the old varmint himself, he's an Injin and I ain't,
and that's what's the matter."</p>

<p>The wood was too dense and the ground too uneven to permit him
to ride at a faster gait than a walk, but long before the appointed
hour was up, he rejoined his friends, who were as surprised as
pleased at his prompt reappearance.</p>

<p>"But where are the bastes that ye promised to furnish us?" inquired
Mickey, who had very little relish for the prospect of walking
any portion of the distance homeward.</p>

<p>"That's what I'll have for yer before the sun goes down," was
the confident reply. "I'll get you one hoss, anyway, which, maybe,
is just as good as two, for the weight of the younker don't make
no difference, and we kin git along with one beast better than
two."</p>

<p>"I submit to your suparior judgment," said the Irishman, deferentially,
"and would suggist that the sooner the same quadruped is procured
the better all round. I hope the thing won't be delayed, as me
aunt obsarved when the joodge sintenced her husband to be hung."</p>

<p>Sut explained that his plan was to ride some distance further,
to a spot which he had in mind, where they would be safer against
being trailed. There, consequently, they could wait with more
security while he went for the much-needed horse. Time was precious,
and no one realized it more than Sut Simpson. He turned the head
of his mustang toward the left, and, after he had started, leaped
to the ground and walked ahead, acting the part of a guide for
the horse as well as for his friends.</p>

<p>The surface over which they journeyed was of the roughest nature.
The fact of it was, the scout was working the party out toward
the open prairie, without availing himself of the pass&mdash;an undertaking
which would have been almost impossible to any one else. At the
same time, by picking his way over the rocky surface, and using
all means possible to conceal their trail, he hoped to baffle
any pursuit that might be attempted.</p>

<p>Lone Wolf was not the redskin to allow such a formidable enemy
as Sut Simpson to walk away unmolested, even though he had received
an unexpected piece of magnanimity at his hands. He had learned
that it was he who had played such havoc among his warriors the
day before, who had deceived them by cunningly uttered signals,
and had drawn away the redskins sufficiently to permit his two
intended victims to walk out of his clutches. It had been a series
of unparalleled exploits, the results of which would have exasperated
the mildest tempered Indian ever known.</p>

<p>These thoughts were constantly in the mind of the scout as he
picked out the path for his equine and human companions. He took
unusual pains, for a great deal depended upon his success in hiding
the trail as much as possible. Perhaps it is not correct to say
that the Apaches could be thrown entirely off the scent, if they
should set themselves to work to run the fugitives under cover.
None knew this better than Sut himself, but he knew also that
the thing could be partially done, and a partial success could
be made a perfect one. That is, by adopting all the artifices
at his command, the work of trailing could be rendered so difficult
that it would be greatly delayed&mdash;so that it would require hours
for the Apaches to unearth the hiding-place. And Sut meant to
accomplish his self-imposed task during those few hours, so as
to rejoin his friends, and resume their flight before the sharp-witted
pursuers could overhaul them.</p>

<p>The journey, therefore, was made one of the most difficult imaginable.
The mustang was unshod, and yet he clambered up steep places,
and over rocks, and through gravelly gullies, where the ordinary
horse would have been powerless. The animal seemed to enter into
the spirit of the occasion and his performances again and again
excited the wonder and admiration of Mickey and Fred. The creature
had undergone the severest kind of training at the hands of an
unsurpassed veteran of the frontier.</p>

<p>This laborious journeying continued for a couple of hours, during
which it seemed to the man and lad that they passed over several
miles of the roughest traveling they had ever witnessed. The mustang
had fallen several times, but he sprang up again like a dog and
showed no signs of injury or fatigue. Finally Sut made a halt,
just as Mickey was on the point of protesting, and, turning about,
so as to face his companions, he smiled in his peculiar way as
he spoke.</p>

<p>"You've stood it pretty well for greenhorns, and now I'm going
to give yer a good rest."</p>

<p>"Do you maan to go into camp for a week or a month, or until
the warm season is over?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to leave yer here, while I go for some hoss flesh,
and it'll take longer time than before."</p>

<p>But the Irishman insisted that he should be allowed to accompany
the scout upon this dangerous expedition.</p>

<p>"For the raison that ye are going to pick out this animal for
<em>me</em>," he added, "how do I know but what ye'll pick out
some ring-boned, spavined critter that trots sideways, and is
blind in both eyes?"</p>

<p>Fred, who dreaded the long spell of dreary waiting which seemed
before him, asked that he might make one of the company; but Sut
would not consent, and he objected to both. He finally compromised
by agreeing to take the Irishman, but insisted that the lad should
stay behind with his mustang.</p>

<p>"A younker like you couldn't do us a bit of good," added Sut,
by way of explanation, "and like as not yer'd get us into the
worst kind of difficulty. Better stay whar you be, rest and be
ready to mount your new animal as soon as we're back, and scoot
away for New Boston."</p>

<p>"How soon will you be back?" he asked, feeling that he ought
to make no objection to the decision.</p>

<p>The forenoon was about half gone, and the scout looked up at
the sky, removed his coon-skin cap, and thoughtfully wrinkled
his brows, as though he were solving some important mental problem.</p>

<p>"Yer may skulp me, younker, but it's a mighty hard thing to tell.
Now I got back with my own animile a good deal sooner than I expected,
but that same thing ain't likely to happen agin. More likely it'll
be t'other way, and we may be gone all day, and p'raps all night."</p>

<p>"And what am I to do all that time?"</p>

<p>"Wait; that'll be easy enough, arter such a rough tramp as I've
given yer."</p>

<p>"But suppose some of the Indians come here; I haven't got any
gun or pistol, so what shall I do?"</p>

<p>"The hoss thar will let you know when any of the varmints come
sneaking round, and he'll do it, too, afore they know whar yer
be, so you'll have time to dig out. I ain't much in the way of
using a knife," added the scout. "I depends on me gun for a long
range, and when I gets into close quarters, I throw this yer (tapping
the handle of his knife), round careless like; but I've got a
little plaything yer that has stood me well, once or twice, and
if it's any help to yer, why, yer are welcome to it. It was give
to me by an officer down at Fort Massachusetts."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the scout drew a small revolver, beautifully mounted
and ornamented with silver, which he handed to the lad, who, as
may be supposed, was delighted with the weapon.</p>

<p>"Just the thing, exactly," he said, as he turned it over in his
hand. "There are five barrels."</p>

<p>"And every one is loaded," added the scout. "The pill which it
gives a redskin ain't very big, but it's sure, and it'll hunt
for him a good ways off; so the dog is apt to bite better than
you expect."</p>

<p>Sut told him that he expected to return by nightfall, and possible
before, but they might be kept away until morning. Under any circumstances,
whether successful or not, they would be back within twenty-four
hours, for they could better afford to wait and repeat the attempt
than to stay away longer than that. The reason for this decision
was that if any of the Apaches should attempt to trail them, and
there was every reason to believe that they would, they would
not need more than twenty-four hours to track them to this hiding
place. It was especially necessary that a collision with them
should be avoided as long as possible, for the whites had everything
to gain by such a course. As time was valuable, Sut did not delay
the departure, and, as he and Mickey gave the lad a cheery good-by,
they turned off to the right, and a minute later disappeared from
view.</p>

<p>"Here I am alone again," he said to himself, "excepting the horse,
and I've got a loaded revolver. Sut don't think those Apaches
can get here before to-morrow morning, and he knows more than
I do about it, so I hope he's right. We've got thus far on our
way home, and it would be a pity if we should fail."</p>

<p>As he looked around, he saw nothing in the place or surroundings
which would have commended it to him. There was water in the shape
of a trickling stream, and that was plenty everywhere, but there
was scarcely a spear of grass visible. The vegetation was stunted
and unthrifty in appearance. There were stones and rocks everywhere,
with nothing that could serve as a shelter in case of storm. He
searched for a considerable distance around, but was unable to
find even a shelving rock, beneath which he might creep and gather
himself up if one of those terrific tempests peculiar to this
region should happen to strike him. Nor did there seem to be any
suitable refuge if the Apaches should attack him before he could
retreat.</p>

<p>He might crouch down behind some of the boulders and rocks, but
the make-up of the surface around him was so similar that three
red skins could surround him with perfect ease and without any
danger to themselves. Fred therefore made up his mind that he
was in about as uncomfortable a situation as a fugitive could
well be.</p>
