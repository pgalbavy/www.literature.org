<p>Major Starland thrust his hand through the window of the pilot
house.</p>

<p>"Give me the pleasure, Captain."</p>

<p>The other smilingly returned the pressure. Each saluted and the
American passed back into the cabin, where his sister awaited
him. He explained the situation.</p>

<p>"Do you know who he is, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I believe his name is Captain Ramon Ortega."</p>

<p>"Have you never heard it before?"</p>

<p>"It seems to have a familiar sound, but I cannot identify it."</p>

<p>"He is the betrothed of Manuela."</p>

<p>"Why didn't I remember it? I can't help admiring the fellow,
for he is the soul of honor."</p>

<p>"She could have told you that."</p>

<p>"You and he are acquaintances, but he does not seem to recognize
you."</p>

<p>"He cannot fail to know me, for we have met, but I think he prefers
to be a stranger, while our relations are so peculiar. He will
not allow me to leave without a few words."</p>

<p>"Great heavens! I came near shooting him, but I guess it wasn't
any nearer than he came to shooting me. He is as brave as he is
high minded."</p>

<p>The young woman had removed the remnants of the feast left by
General Yozarro and his guests so that the small, richly furnished
apartment looked tidy and attractive. She reclined on the silken
covered lounge placed against the side of the cabin, and her brother
bade her good night and returned to his comrades, seated at the
front and talking in low tones. To them the Major told of his
talk with Captain Ortega.</p>

<p>"You do not doubt what he told you, Major?" said Guzman inquiringly.</p>

<p>"It is impossible."</p>

<p>"General Yozarro has not a braver or more honorable officer in
his army. Three years ago, when we were at war with Atlamalco,
and neither republic owned a fleet, we had a fight with three
hundred Atlamalcans in the mountains. Each force was about the
same and it was one of the hottest fights I ever saw, for the
respective forces were commanded by Generals Bambos and Yozarro."</p>

<p>"Did each take a personal part in it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Captain Guzman with a grin and shrug of the shoulders,
"that is to say, so far as directing matters was concerned. I
saw Bambos peeping out from behind a big rock, swinging his sword,
shouting and yawping till he seemed ready to burst, but taking
good care when the bullets were whistling near that he was out
of reach. I didn't see anything of Yozarro, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I did," interrupted Martella; "he was in a deep hollow and made
sure his head never rose a half inch above the edge. He did his
part too in bellowing orders, but I don't suppose he commanded
any more attention than Bambos, Captain."</p>

<p>"Both forces fought independently of their leaders."</p>

<p>"You commanded yours, Captain, and did it well."</p>

<p>"Not so well as Captain Ortega, for it was that thundergust flank
movement which drove us headlong out of the mountains, with some
of the men never halting till they reached Zalapata. Captain Ortega
and no one else won that battle."</p>

<p>"General Yozarro knows his worth," said Martella; "he would have
made him a general long ago if it was not that he is jealous of
him. He is the only one I know who doesn't fear General Yozarro.
They often quarrel, for the Captain is plain of speech to every
one. Yozarro has announced that he means to make him admiral of
the fleet which he intends to build up. That I suppose is why
he has placed him in charge of the gunboat, so that he shall have
all the training and experience he can."</p>

<p>"How does he feel toward you, Martella?"</p>

<p>The native gave his usual shrug and grinned.</p>

<p>"I know enough to keep away from him. He will never forgive me
for deserting. He knows my grievance and may pity me, but he would
be glad to shoot me, if he had a fair excuse for doing so. I don't
mean to tempt him, even if he has given you his pledge of neutrality
and is the most honorable of men. If General Yozarro finds fault
with him, it will be just like Captain Ortega to say right before
all the other officers 'I gave you a chance, but you had not the
courage to use it and I would not waste any more effort on you.'"</p>

<p>None of the three could make a satisfactory forecast of the policy
of General Yozarro. It seemed to the American that he might be
able to secure two or three pieces of cannon and open a bombardment
of the boat from the shore, but this presupposed an unreasonable
delay. Captain Guzman said:</p>

<p>"He has no way of getting cannon this side of Atlamalco, and
that would take a day or two; he has no wish to destroy his own
property, and, if he had such a wish, he couldn't do it, for only
by accident would he hit the boat."</p>

<p>"That squelches my theory, which I didn't believe in myself.
I'll have another talk with the Captain, though his sense of honor
isn't likely to allow him to say much."</p>

<p>It was beyond midnight and the two were conversing in a friendly
way, but without anything important being said, when they looked
in each other's face with a pleased expression. A welcome fact
had become known to both at the same moment.</p>

<p>"The boat is moving," whispered the American.</p>

<p>With the screw motionless, she had been lifted clear by the tide
and now swung clear. The Captain drew out his watch and held it
so the moonlight lit up the face.</p>

<p>"There is no reaching Zalapata until toward noon, provided we
get there with this gunboat, Major."</p>

<p>The significant intonation and smile which accompanied these
words puzzled the American, who would have given much to have
had them explained. But it was useless to question the Captain
and the only comfort was in the thought that he was an honorable
foe.</p>

<p>"Now for Zalapata!" he added.</p>

<p>"I assume, Captain, that you are familiar with all the windings
and dangers of the river."</p>

<p>"Didn't I prove it by running aground? But there will be no more
mishaps of that nature while I hold the wheel."</p>

<p>"Your pledge is sufficient," remarked the American, who again
passed to the lower deck and joined his friends. He told them
of the curious remark of Captain Ortega, but none of the three
could guess his meaning.</p>

<p>"The only thing that is certain," said Captain Guzman, "is that
General Yozarro and the rest are somewhere down the river and
we shall hear more from them."</p>

<p>No one felt any disposition to sleep and none really needed rest.
The engineer and firemen caught cat naps whenever they could.
Captain Ortega was probably in the same state with his three male
passengers. His duties did not require long runs as a rule, but
the present demand having arisen, he was equal to twenty hours
or more at a stretch.</p>
