<p>IN A WAY Miss Kitty Cat was a patient creature. She could play a waiting
game. She spent hours watching rat-holes without growing restless.
</p>
<p>So after her talk with Rusty Wren and his wife, when she urged them to
give up their boxlike house and build themselves an open nest like most
other birds, Miss Kitty left them.
</p><p>"I'll let my words sink in," Miss Kitty muttered to herself. "Of course
they'll want to talk things over privately."
</p><p>It wasn't often that she made herself so agreeable to any of the bird
people. Indeed, she had been so pleasant that Rusty Wren began to think
that Miss Kitty was a much kinder creature than he had always supposed.
</p><p>"Miss Kitty's very agreeable," Rusty Wren remarked to his wife. "Did you
notice how sweetly she spoke of our children?"
</p><p>"Huh!" said Mrs. Wren. "She may fool you; but she can't fool me. She's a
mealy-mouthed animal, if ever I met one."
</p><p>"I don't see how you can say that about Miss Kitty Cat," Rusty replied.
"She doesn't eat meal."
</p><p>"I suppose you'll be saying next that she doesn't eat birds!" his wife
exclaimed.
</p><p>"I fear you've been listening to gossip," Rusty ventured. "If Miss Kitty
Cat comes back I hope you'll be cordial to her."
</p><p>He could have bitten his tongue a moment later for saying that, because
Mrs. Wren began to scold him. And he flew away and left her as soon as
he could think of a good excuse.
</p><p>He went over to the orchard, where he flitted about for some time. And
at last he met Jolly Robin, who appeared most doleful.
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Rusty Wren asked. "You look terribly upset."
</p><p>"So I am," Jolly Robin admitted. "We had a caller yesterday."
</p><p>"Well, well!" said Rusty Wren. "That's nothing to be glum about."
</p><p>"You'd think so if you were I. It was Miss Kitty Cat. And when she left
she took one of our nestlings with her."
</p><p>"Perhaps she only borrowed it," Rusty Wren suggested. "Maybe she'll
return it to-day."
</p><p>"No!" Jolly Robin told him. "If she comes back again it will only be to
take another one."
</p><p>Suddenly Rusty Wren remembered that he had urged his wife to be cordial
to Miss Kitty Cat the next time she called at the cherry tree where they
lived.
</p><p>"I must hurry home!" he cried. "I must warn my wife."
</p><p>"But your youngsters are safe," Jolly Robin assured him. "Miss Kitty Cat
can't reach them inside the tin can where you built your nest."
</p><p>"That's true," Rusty Wren admitted. "But there's my wife! Miss Kitty
might harm her, if she caught her unawares." So he started for home at
top speed.
