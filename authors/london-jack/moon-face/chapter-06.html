<P>
WHEN I look back, I realize what a peculiar friendship it was. First, there
was Lloyd Inwood, tall, slender, and finely knit, nervous and dark. And then
Paul Tichlorne, tall, slender, and finely knit, nervous and blond. Each was
the replica of the other in everything except color. Lloyd's eyes were black;
Paul's were blue. Under stress of excitement, the blood coursed olive in the
face of Lloyd, crimson in the face of Paul. But outside this matter of
coloring they were as like as two peas. Both were high-strung, prone to
excessive tension and endurance, and they lived at concert pitch.
<P>
But there was a trio involved in this remarkable friendship, and the third was
short, and fat, and chunky, and lazy, and, loath to say, it was I. Paul and
Lloyd seemed born to rivalry with each other, and I to be peacemaker between
them. We grew up together, the three of us, and full often have I received the
angry blows each intended for the other. They were always competing, striving
to outdo each other, and when entered upon some such struggle there was no
limit either to their endeavors or passions.
<P>
This intense spirit of rivalry obtained in their studies and their games. If
Paul memorized one canto of "Marmion," Lloyd memorized two cantos, Paul came
back with three, and Lloyd again with four, till each knew the whole poem by
heart. I remember an incident that occurred at the swimming hole--an incident
tragically significant of the life-struggle between them. The boys had a game
of diving to the bottom of a ten-foot pool and holding on by submerged roots
to see who could stay under the longest. Paul and Lloyd allowed themselves to
be bantered into making the descent together. When I saw their faces, set and
determined, disappear in the water as they sank swiftly down, I felt a
foreboding of something dreadful. The moments sped, the ripples died away, the
face of the pool grew placid and untroubled, and neither black nor golden head
broke surface in quest of air. We above grew anxious. The longest record of
the longest-winded boy had been exceeded, and still there was no sign. Air
bubbles trickled slowly upward, showing that the breath had been expelled from
their lungs, and after that the bubbles ceased to trickle upward. Each second
became interminable, and, unable longer to endure the suspense, I plunged into
the water.
<P>
I found them down at the bottom, clutching tight to the roots, their heads not
a foot apart, their eyes wide open, each glaring fixedly at the other. They
were suffering frightful torment, writhing and twisting in the pangs of
voluntary suffocation; for neither would let go and acknowledge himself
beaten. I tried to break Paul's hold on the root, but he resisted me fiercely.
Then I lost my breath and came to the surface, badly scared. I quickly
explained the situation, and half a dozen of us went down and by main strength
tore them loose. By the time we got them out, both were unconscious, and it
was only after much barrel-rolling and rubbing and pounding that they finally
came to their senses. They would have drowned there, had no one rescued them.
<P>
When Paul Tichlorne entered college, he let it be generally understood that he
was going in for the social sciences. Lloyd Inwood, entering at the same time,
elected to take the same course. But Paul had had it secretly in mind all the
time to study the natural sciences, specializing on chemistry, and at the last
moment he switched over. Though Lloyd had already arranged his year's work and
attended the first lectures, he at once followed Paul's lead and went in for
the natural sciences and especially for chemistry. Their rivalry soon became a
noted thing throughout the university. Each was a spur to the other, and they
went into chemistry deeper than did ever students before--so deep, in fact,
that ere they took their sheepskins they could have stumped any chemistry or
"cow college" professor in the institution, save "old" Moss, head of the
department, and even him they puzzled and edified more than once. Lloyd's
discovery of the "death bacillus" of the sea toad, and his experiments on it
with potassium cyanide, sent his name and that of his university ringing round
the world; nor was Paul a whit behind when he succeeded in producing
laboratory colloids exhibiting amoeba-like activities, and when he cast new
light upon the processes of fertilization through his startling experiments
with simple sodium chlorides and magnesium solutions on low forms of marine
life.
<P>
It was in their undergraduate days, however, in the midst of their profoundest
plunges into the mysteries of organic chemistry, that Doris Van Benschoten
entered into their lives. Lloyd met her first, but within twenty-four hours
Paul saw to it that he also made her acquaintance. Of course, they fell in
love with her, and she became the only thing in life worth living for. They
wooed her with equal ardor and fire, and so intense became their struggle for
her that half the student-body took to wagering wildly on the result. Even
"old" Moss, one day, after an astounding demonstration in his private
laboratory by Paul, was guilty to the extent of a month's salary of backing
him to become the bridegroom of Doris Van Benschoten.
<P>
In the end she solved the problem in her own way, to everybody's satisfaction
except Paul's and Lloyd's. Getting them together, she said that she really
could not choose between them because she loved them both equally well; and
that, unfortunately, since polyandry was not permitted in the United States
she would be compelled to forego the honor and happiness of marrying either of
them. Each blamed the other for this lamentable outcome, and the bitterness
between them grew more bitter.
<P>
But things came to a head enough. It was at my home, after they had taken
their degrees and dropped out of the world's sight, that the beginning of the
end came to pass. Both were men of means, with little inclination and no
necessity for professional life. My friendship and their mutual animosity were
the two things that linked them in any way together. While they were very
often at my place, they made it a fastidious point to avoid each other on such
visits, though it was inevitable, under the circumstances, that they should
come upon each other occasionally.
<P>
On the day I have in recollection, Paul Tichlorne had been mooning all morning
in my study over a current scientific review. This left me free to my own
affairs, and I was out among my roses when Lloyd Inwood arrived. Clipping and
pruning and tacking the climbers on the porch, with my mouth full of nails,
and Lloyd following me about and lending a hand now and again, we fell to
discussing the mythical race of invisible people, that strange and vagrant
people the traditions of which have come down to us. Lloyd warmed to the talk
in his nervous, jerky fashion, and was soon interrogating the physical
properties and possibilities of invisibility. A perfectly black object, he
contended, would elude and defy the acutest vision.
<P>
"Color is a sensation," he was saying. "It has no objective reality. Without
light, we can see neither colors nor objects themselves. All objects are black
in the dark, and in the dark it is impossible to see them. If no light strikes
upon them, then no light is flung back from them to the eye, and so we have no
vision-evidence of their being."
<P>
"But we see black objects in daylight," I objected.
<P>
"Very true," he went on warmly. "And that is because they are not perfectly
black. Were they perfectly black, absolutely black, as it were, we could not
see them--ay, not in the blaze of a thousand suns could we see them! And so I
say, with the right pigments, properly compounded, an absolutely black paint
could be produced which would render invisible whatever it was applied to."
<P>
"It would be a remarkable discovery," I said non-committally, for the whole
thing seemed too fantastic for aught but speculative purposes.
<P>
"Remarkable!" Lloyd slapped me on the shoulder. "I should say so. Why, old
chap, to coat myself with such a paint would be to put the world at my feet.
The secrets of kings and courts would be mine, the machinations of diplomats
and politicians, the play of stock-gamblers, the plans of trusts and
corporations. I could keep my hand on the inner pulse of things and become the
greatest power in the world. And I--" He broke off shortly, then added, "Well,
I have begun my experiments, and I don't mind telling you that I'm right in
line for it."
<P>
A laugh from the doorway startled us. Paul Tichlorne was standing there, a
smile of mockery on his lips.
<P>
"You forget, my dear Lloyd," he said.
<P>
"Forget what?"
<P>
"You forget," Paul went on--"ah, you forget the shadow."
<P>
I saw Lloyd's face drop, but he answered sneeringly, "I can carry a sunshade,
you know." Then he turned suddenly and fiercely upon him. "Look here, Paul,
you'll keep out of this if you know what's good for you."
<P>
A rupture seemed imminent, but Paul laughed good-naturedly. "I wouldn't lay
fingers on your dirty pigments. Succeed beyond your most sanguine
expectations, yet you will always fetch up against the shadow. You can't get
away from it. Now I shall go on the very opposite tack. In the very nature of
my proposition the shadow will be eliminated--"
<P>
"Transparency!" ejaculated Lloyd, instantly. "But it can't be achieved."
<P>
"Oh, no; of course not." And Paul shrugged his shoulders and strolled off down
the briar-rose path.
<P>
This was the beginning of it. Both men attacked the problem with all the
tremendous energy for which they were noted, and with a rancor and bitterness
that made me tremble for the success of either. Each trusted me to the utmost,
and in the long weeks of experimentation that followed I was made a party to
both sides, listening to their theorizings and witnessing their
demonstrations. Never, by word or sign, did I convey to either the slightest
hint of the other's progress, and they respected me for the seal I put upon my
lips.
<P>
Lloyd Inwood, after prolonged and unintermittent application, when the tension
upon his mind and body became too great to bear, had a strange way of
obtaining relief. He attended prize fights. It was at one of these brutal
exhibitions, whither he had dragged me in order to tell his latest results,
that his theory received striking confirmation.
<P>
"Do you see that red-whiskered man?" he asked, pointing across the ring to the
fifth tier of seats on the opposite side. "And do you see the next man to him,
the one in the white hat? Well, there is quite a gap between them, is there
not?"
<P>
"Certainly," I answered. "They are a seat apart. The gap is the unoccupied
seat."
<P>
He leaned over to me and spoke seriously. "Between the red-whiskered man and
the white-hatted man sits Ben Wasson. You have heard me speak of him. He is
the cleverest pugilist of his weight in the country. He is also a Caribbean
negro, full-blooded, and the blackest in the United State;. He has on a black
overcoat buttoned up. I saw him when he came in and took that seat. As soon as
he sat down he disappeared. Watch closely; he may smile."
<P>
I was for crossing over to verify Lloyd's statement, but he restrained me.
"Wait," he said.
<P>
I waited and watched, till the red-whiskered man turned his head as though
addressing the unoccupied seat; and then, in that empty space, I saw the
rolling whites of a pair of eyes and the white double-crescent of two rows of
teeth, and for the instant I could make out a negro's face. But with the
passing of the smile his visibility passed, and the chair seemed vacant as
before.
<P>
"Were he perfectly black, you could sit alongside him and not see him," Lloyd
said; and I confess the illustration was apt enough to make me well-nigh
convinced.
<P>
I visited Lloyd's laboratory a number of times after that, and found him
always deep in his search after the absolute black. His experiments covered
all sorts Of pigments, such as lamp-blacks, tars, carbonized vegetable
matters, soots of oils and fats, and the various carbonized animal substances.
<P>
"White light is composed of the seven primary colors," he argued to me. "But
it is itself, of itself, invisible. Only by being reflected from objects do it
and the objects become visible. But only that portion of it that is reflected
becomes visible. For instance, here is a blue tobacco-box. The white light
strikes against it, and, with one exception, all its component colors--violet,
indigo, green, yellow, orange, and red--are absorbed. The one exception is
BLUE. It is not absorbed, but reflected.Therefore the tobacco-box gives us a
sensation of blueness. We do not see the other colors because they are
absorbed. We see only the blue. For the same reason grass is GREEN. The green
waves of white light are thrown upon our eyes."
<P>
"When we paint our houses, we do not apply color to them," he said at another
time. "What we do is to apply certain substances that have the property of
absorbing from white light all the colors except those that we would have our
houses appear. When a substance reflects all the colors to the eye, it seems
to us white. When it absorbs all the colors, it is black. But, as I said
before, we have as yet no perfect black. All the colors are not absorbed. The
perfect black, guarding against high lights, will be utterly and absolutely
invisible. Look at that, for example."
<P>
He pointed to the palette lying on his work-table. Different shades of black
pigments were brushed on it. One, in particular, I could hardly see. It gave
my eyes a blurring sensation, and I rubbed them and looked again.
<P>
"That," he said impressively, "is the blackest black you or any mortal man
ever looked upon. But just you wait, and I'll have a black so black that no
mortal man will be able to look upon it--and see it!"
<P>
On the other hand, I used to find Paul Tichlorne plunged as deeply into the
study of light polarization, diffraction, and interference, single and double
refraction, and all manner of strange organic compounds.
<P>
"Transparency: a state or quality of body which permits all rays of light to
pass through," he defined for me. "That is what I am seeking. Lloyd blunders
up against the shadow with his perfect opaqueness. But I escape it. A
transparent body casts no shadow; neither does it reflect light-waves--that
is, the perfectly transparent does not. So, avoiding high lights, not only
will such a body cast no shadow, but, since it reflects no light, it will also
be invisible."
<P>
We were standing by the window at another time. Paul was engaged in polishing
a number of lenses, which were ranged along the sill. Suddenly, after a pause
in the conversation, he said, "Oh! I've dropped a lens. Stick your head out,
old man, and see where it went to."
<P>
Out I started to thrust my head, but a sharp blow on the forehead caused me to
recoil. I rubbed my bruised brow and gazed with reproachful inquiry at Paul,
who was laughing in gleeful, boyish fashion.
<P>
"Well?" he said.
<P>
"Well?" I echoed.
<P>
"Why don't you investigate?" he demanded. And investigate I did. Before
thrusting out my head, my senses, automatically active, had told me there was
nothing there, that nothing intervened between me and out-of-doors, that the
aperture of the window opening was utterly empty. I stretched forth my hand
and felt a hard object, smooth and cool and flat, which my touch, out of its
experience, told me to be glass. I looked again, but could see positively
nothing.
<P>
"White quartzose sand," Paul rattled off, "sodic carbonate, slaked lime,
cutlet, manganese peroxide--there you have it, the finest French plate glass,
made by the great St. Gobain Company, who made the finest plate glass in the
world, and this is the finest piece they ever made. It cost a king's ransom.
But look at it I You can't see it. You don't know it's there till you run your
head against it.
<P>
"Eh, old boy! That's merely an object-lesson--certain elements, in themselves
opaque, yet so compounded as to give a resultant body which is transparent.
But that is a matter of inorganic chemistry, you say. Very true. But I dare to
assert, standing here on my two feet, that in the organic I can duplicate
whatever occurs in the inorganic.
<P>
"Here!" He held a test-tube between me and the light, and I noted the cloudy
or muddy liquid it contained. He emptied the contents of another test-tube
into it, and almost instantly it became clear and sparkling.
<P>
"Or here!" With quick, nervous movements among his array of test-tubes, he
turned a white solution to a wine color, and a light yellow solution to a dark
brown. He dropped a piece of litmus paper into an acid, when it changed
instantly to red, and on floating it in an alkali it turned as quickly to
blue.
<P>
"The litmus paper is still the litmus paper," he enunciated in the formal
manner of the lecturer. "I have not changed it into something else. Then what
did I do? I merely changed the arrangement of its molecules. Where, at first,
it absorbed all colors from the light but red, its molecular structure was so
changed that it absorbed red and all colors except blue. And so it goes, AD
INFINITUM. Now, what I purpose to do is this." He paused for a space. "I
purpose to seek--ay, and to find--the proper reagents, which, acting upon the
living organism, will bring about molecular changes analogous to those you
have just witnessed. But these reagents, which I shall find, and for that
matter, upon which I already have my hands, will not turn the living body to
blue or red or black, but they will turn it to transparency. All light will
pass through it. It will be invisible. It will cast no shadow."
<P>
A few weeks later I went hunting with Paul. He had been promising me for some
time that I should have the pleasure of shooting over a wonderful dog--the
most wonderful dog, in fact, that ever man shot over, so he averred, and
continued to aver till my curiosity was aroused. But on the morning in
question I was disappointed, for there was no dog in evidence.
<P>
"Don't see him about," Paul remarked unconcernedly, and we set off across the
fields.
<P>
I could not imagine, at the time, what was ailing me, but I had a feeling of
some impending and deadly illness. My nerves were all awry, and, from the
astounding tricks they played me, my senses seemed to have run riot. Strange
sounds disturbed me. At times I heard the swish-swish of grass being shoved
aside, and once the patter of feet across a patch of stony ground.
<P>
"Did you hear anything, Paul?" I asked once.
<P>
But he shook his head, and thrust his feet steadily forward.
<P>
While climbing a fence, I heard the low, eager whine of a dog, apparently from
within a couple of feet of me; but on looking about me I saw nothing.
<P>
I dropped to the ground, limp and trembling.
<P>
"Paul," I said, "we had better return to the house. I am afraid I am going to
be sick."
<P>
"Nonsense, old man," he answered. "The sunshine has gone to your head like
wine. You'll be all right. It's famous weather."
<P>
But, passing along a narrow path through a clump of cottonwoods, some object
brushed against my legs and I stumbled and nearly fell. I looked with sudden
anxiety at Paul.
<P>
"What's the matter?" he asked. "Tripping over your own feet?"
<P>
I kept my tongue between my teeth and plodded on, though sore perplexed and
thoroughly satisfied that some acute and mysterious malady had attacked my
nerves. So far my eyes had escaped; but, when we got to the open fields again,
even my vision went back on me. Strange flashes of vari-colored, rainbow light
began to appear and disappear on the path before me. Still, I managed to keep
myself in hand, till the vari-colored lights persisted for a space of fully
twenty seconds, dancing and flashing in continuous play. Then I sat down, weak
and shaky.
<P>
"It's all up with me," I gasped, covering my eyes with my hands. "It has
attacked my eyes. Paul, take me home."
<P>
But Paul laughed long and loud. "What did I tell you?--the most wonderful dog,
eh? Well, what do you think?"
<P>
He turned partly from me and began to whistle. I heard the patter of feet, the
panting of a heated animal, and the unmistakable yelp of a dog. Then Paul
stooped down and apparently fondled the empty air.
<P>
"Here! Give me your fist."
<P>
And he rubbed my hand over the cold nose and jowls of a dog. A dog it
certainly was, with the shape and the smooth, short coat of a pointer.
<P>
Suffice to say, I speedily recovered my spirits and control. Paul put a collar
about the animal's neck and tied his handkerchief to its tail. And then was
vouchsafed us the remarkable sight of an empty collar and a waving
handkerchief cavorting over the fields. It was something to see that collar
and handkerchief pin a bevy of quail in a clump of locusts and remain rigid
and immovable till we had flushed the birds.
<P>
Now and again the dog emitted the vari-colored light-flashes I have mentioned.
The one thing, Paul explained, which he had not anticipated and which he
doubted could be overcome.
<P>
"They're a large family," he said, "these sun dogs, wind dogs, rainbows,
halos, and parhelia. They are produced by refraction of light from mineral and
ice crystals, from mist, rain, spray, and no end of things; and I am afraid
they are the penalty I must pay for transparency. I escaped Lloyd's shadow
only to fetch up against the rainbow flash."
<P>
A couple of days later, before the entrance to Paul's laboratory, I
encountered a terrible stench. So overpowering was it that it was easy to
discover the source‹a mass of putrescent matter on the doorstep which in
general outlines resembled a dog.
<P>
Paul was startled when he investigated my find. It was his invisible dog, or
rather, what had been his invisible dog, for it was now plainly visible. It
had been playing about but a few minutes before in all health and strength.
Closer examination revealed that the skull had been crushed by some heavy
blow. While it was strange that the animal should have been killed, the
inexplicable thing was that it should so quickly decay.
<P>
"The reagents I injected into its system were harmless," Paul explained. "Yet
they were powerful, and it appears that when death comes they force
practically instantaneous disintegration. Remarkable! Most remarkable! Well,
the only thing is not to die. They do not harm so long as one lives. But I do
wonder who smashed in that dog's head."
<P>
Light, however, was thrown upon this when a frightened housemaid brought the
news that Gaffer Bedshaw had that very morning, not more than an hour back,
gone violently insane, and was strapped down at home, in the huntsman's lodge,
where he raved of a battle with a ferocious and gigantic beast that he had
encountered in the Tichlorne pasture. He claimed that the thing, whatever it
was, was invisible, that with his own eyes he had seen that it was invisible;
wherefore his tearful wife and daughters shook their heads, and wherefore he
but waxed the more violent, and the gardener and the coachman tightened the
straps by another hole.
<P>
Nor, while Paul Tichlorne was thus successfully mastering the problem of
invisibility, was Lloyd Inwood a whit behind. I went over in answer to a
message of his to come and see how he was getting on. Now his laboratory
occupied an isolated situation in the midst of his vast grounds. It was built
in a pleasant little glade, surrounded on all sides by a dense forest growth,
and was to be gained by way of a winding and erratic path. But I have
travelled that path so often as to know every foot of it, and conceive my
surprise when I came upon the glade and found no laboratory. The quaint shed
structure with its red sandstone chimney was not. Nor did it look as if it
ever had been. There were no signs of ruin, no debris, nothing.
<P>
I started to walk across what had once been its site. "This," I said to
myself, "should be where the step went up to the door." Barely were the words
out of my mouth when I stubbed my toe on some obstacle, pitched forward, and
butted my head into something that FELT very much like a door. I reached out
my hand. It WAS a door. I found the knob and turned it. And at once, as the
door swung inward on its hinges, the whole interior of the laboratory impinged
upon my vision. Greeting Lloyd, I closed the door and backed up the path a few
paces. I could see nothing of the building. Returning and opening the door, at
once all the furniture and every detail of the interior were visible. It was
indeed startling, the sudden transition from void to light and form and color.
<P>
"What do you think of it, eh?" Lloyd asked, wringing my hand. "I slapped a
couple of coats of absolute black on the outside yesterday afternoon to see
how it worked. How's your head? you bumped it pretty solidly, I imagine."
<P>
"Never mind that," he interrupted my congratulations. "I've something better
for you to do."
<P>
While he talked he began to strip, and when he stood naked before me he thrust
a pot and brush into my hand and said, "Here, give me a coat of this."
<P>
It was an oily, shellac-like stuff, which spread quickly and easily over the
skin and dried immediately.
<P>
"Merely preliminary and precautionary," he explained when I had finished; "but
now for the real stuff."
<P>
I picked up another pot he indicated, and glanced inside, but could see
nothing.
<P>
"It's empty," I said.
<P>
"Stick your finger in it."
<P>
I obeyed, and was aware of a sensation of cool moistness. On withdrawing my
hand I glanced at the forefinger, the one I had immersed, but it had
disappeared. I moved and knew from the alternate tension and relaxation of the
muscles that I moved it, but it defied my sense of sight. To all appearances I
had been shorn of a finger; nor could I get any visual impression of it till I
extended it under the skylight and saw its shadow plainly blotted on the
floor.
<P>
Lloyd chuckled. "Now spread it on, and keep your eyes open."
<P>
I dipped the brush into the seemingly empty pot, and gave him a long stroke
across his chest. With the passage of the brush the living flesh disappeared
from beneath. I covered his right leg, and he was a one-legged man defying all
laws of gravitation. And so, stroke by stroke, member by member, I painted
Lloyd Inwood into nothingness. It was a creepy experience, and I was glad when
naught remained in sight but his burning black eyes, poised apparently
unsupported in mid-air.
<P>
"I have a refined and harmless solution for them," he said. "A fine spray with
an air-brush, and presto! I am not."
<P>
This deftly accomplished, he said, "Now I shall move about, and do you tell me
what sensations you experience."
<P>
"In the first place, I cannot see you," I said, and I could hear his gleeful
laugh from the midst of the emptiness. "Of course," I continued, "you cannot
escape your shadow, but that was to be expected. When you pass between my eye
and an object, the object disappears, but so unusual and incomprehensible is
its disappearance that it seems to me as though my eyes had blurred. When you
move rapidly, I experience a bewildering succession of blurs. The blurring
sensation makes my eyes ache and my brain tired."
<P>
"Have you any other warnings of my presence?" he asked.
<P>
"No, and yes," I answered. "When you are near me I have feelings similar to
those produced by dank warehouses, gloomy crypts, and deep mines. And as
sailors feel the loom of the land on dark nights, so I think I feel the loom
of your body. But it is all very vague and intangible."
<P>
Long we talked that last morning in his laboratory; and when I turned to go,
he put his unseen hand in mine with nervous grip, and said, "Now I shall
conquer the world!" And I could not dare to tell him of Paul Tichlorne's equal
success.
<P>
At home I found a note from Paul, asking me to come up immediately, and it was
high noon when I came spinning up the driveway on my wheel. Paul called me
from the tennis court, and I dismounted and went over. But the court was
empty. As I stood there, gaping open-mouthed, a tennis ball struck me on the
arm, and as I turned about, another whizzed past my ear. For aught I could see
of my assailant, they came whirling at me from out of space, and right well
was I peppered with them. But when the balls already flung at me began to come
back for a second whack, I realized the situation. Seizing a racquet and
keeping my eyes open, I quickly saw a rainbow flash appearing and disappearing
and darting over the ground. I took out after it, and when I laid the racquet
upon it for a half-dozen stout blows, Paul's voice rang out:
<P>
"Enough! Enough! Oh! Ouch! Stop! You're landing on my naked skin, you know!
Ow! O-w-w! I'll be good! I'll be good! I only wanted you to see my
metamorphosis," he said ruefully, and I imagined he was rubbing his hurts.
<P>
A few minutes later we were playing tennis--a handicap on my part, for I could
have no knowledge of his position save when all the angles between himself,
the sun, and me, were in proper conjunction. Then he flashed, and only then.
But the flashes were more brilliant than the rainbow--purest blue, most
delicate violet, brightest yellow, and all the intermediary shades, with the
scintillant brilliancy of the diamond, dazzling, blinding, iridescent.
<P>
But in the midst of our play I felt a sudden cold chill, reminding me of deep
mines and gloomy crypts, such a chill as I had experienced that very morning.
The next moment, close to the net, I saw a ball rebound in mid-air and empty
space, and at the same instant, a score of feet away, Paul Tichlorne emitted a
rainbow flash. It could not be he from whom the ball had rebounded, and with
sickening dread I realized that Lloyd Inwood had come upon the scene. To make
sure, I looked for his shadow, and there it was, a shapeless blotch the girth
of his body, (the sun was overhead), moving along the ground. I remembered his
threat, and felt sure that all the long years of rivalry were about to
culminate in uncanny battle.
<P>
I cried a warning to Paul, and heard a snarl as of a wild beast, and an
answering snarl. I saw the dark blotch move swiftly across the court, and a
brilliant burst of vari-colored light moving with equal swiftness to meet it;
and then shadow and flash came together and there was the sound of unseen
blows. The net went down before my frightened eyes. I sprang toward the
fighters, crying:
<P>
"For God's sake!"
<P>
But their locked bodies smote against my knees, and I was overthrown.
<P>
"You keep out of this, old man!"! heard the voice of Lloyd Inwood from out of
the emptiness. And then Paul's voice crying, "Yes, we've had enough of
peacemaking!"
<P>
From the sound of their voices I knew they had separated. I could not locate
Paul, and so approached the shadow that represented Lloyd. But from the other
side came a stunning blow on the point of my jaw, and I heard Paul scream
angrily, "Now will you keep away?"
<P>
Then they came together again, the impact of their blows, their groans and
gasps, and the swift flashings and shadow-movings telling plainly of the
deadliness of the struggle.
<P>
I shouted for help, and Gaffer Bedshaw came running into the court. I could
see, as he approached, that he was looking at me strangely, but he collided
with the combatants and was hurled headlong to the ground. With despairing
shriek and a cry of "O Lord, I've got 'em!" he sprang to his feet and tore
madly out of the court.
<P>
I could do nothing, so I sat up, fascinated and powerless, and watched the
struggle. The noonday sun beat down with dazzling brightness on the naked
tennis court. And it was naked. All I could see was the blotch of shadow and
the rainbow flashes, the dust rising from the invisible feet, the earth
tearing up from beneath the straining foot-grips, and the wire screen bulge
once or twice as their bodies hurled against it. That was all, and after a
time even that ceased. There were no more flashes, and the shadow had become
long and stationary; and I remembered their set boyish faces when they clung
to the roots in the deep coolness of the pool.
<P>
They found me an hour afterward. Some inkling of what had happened got to the
servants and they quitted the Tichlorne service in a body. Gaffer Bedshaw
never recovered from the second shock he received, and is confined in a
madhouse, hopelessly incurable. The secrets of their marvellous discoveries
died with Paul and Lloyd, both laboratories being destroyed by grief-stricken
relatives. As for myself, I no longer care for chemical research, and science
is a tabooed topic in my household. I have returned to my roses. Nature's
colors are good enough for me.
