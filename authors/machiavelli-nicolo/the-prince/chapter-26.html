<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Having carefully considered the subject of the above discourses,
and wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious
to a new prince, and whether there were elements that would give
an opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order
of things which would do honour to him and good to the people
of this country, it appears to me that so many things concur to
favour a new prince that I never knew a time more fit than the
present.</p>

<p>And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people of Israel
should be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses;
that the Persians should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover
the greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should
be dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at
the present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian
spirit, it was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity
that she is now in, that she should be more enslaved than the
Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than
the Athenians; without head, without order, beaten, despoiled,
torn, overrun; and to have endured every kind of desolation.</p>

<p>Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which
made us think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless
it was afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune
rejected him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him
who shall yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and
plundering of Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom
and of Tuscany, and cleanse those sores that for long have festered.
It is seen how she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver
her from these wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also
that she is ready and willing to follow a banner if only someone
will raise it.</p>

<p>Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place
more hope than in your illustrious house,[1] with its valour and
fortune, favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now
the chief, and which could be made the head of this redemption.
This will not be difficult if you will recall to yourself the
actions and lives of the men I have named. And although they were
great and wonderful men, yet they were men, and each one of them
had no more opportunity than the present offers, for their enterprises
were neither more just nor easier than this, nor was God more
their friend than He is yours.</p>

<p> [1] Giuliano de Medici. He had just been created a cardinal
by Leo X.  In 1523 Giuliano was elected Pope, and took the title
of Clement <em>VII</em>.</p>

<p>With us there is great justice, because that war is just which
is necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope
but in them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where
the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you
will only follow those men to whom I have directed your attention.
Further than this, how extraordinarily the ways of God have been
manifested beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led
the way, the rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna,
everything has contributed to your greatness; you ought to do
the rest. God is not willing to do everything, and thus take away
our free will and that share of glory which belongs to us.</p>

<p>And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named Italians
have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your illustrious
house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so many
campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were exhausted,
this has happened because the old order of things was not good,
and none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing honours
a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances when
he himself was newly risen. Such things when they are well founded
and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in Italy
there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in
every form.</p>

<p>Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the
head. Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats,
how superior the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety.
But when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this
springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since
those who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to
himself to know, there having never been any one so distinguished
above the rest, either by valour or fortune, that others would
yield to him. Hence it is that for so long a time, and during
so much fighting in the past twenty years, whenever there has
been an army wholly Italian, it has always given a poor account
of itself; the first witness to this is Il Taro, afterwards Allesandria,
Capua, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna, Mestri.[2]</p>

<p> [2] The battles of Il Taro, 1495; Alessandria, 1499; Capua,
1501;  Genoa, 1507; Vaila, 1509; Bologna, 1511; Mestri, 1513.</p>

<p>If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow these
remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary
before all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise,
to be provided with your own forces, because there can be no more
faithful, truer, or better soldiers. And although singly they
are good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves
commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at
his expense. Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such
arms, so that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian
valour.</p>

<p>And although Swiss and Spanish infantry may be considered very
formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason
of which a third order would not only be able to oppose them,
but might be relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards
cannot resist cavalry, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry
whenever they encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as
has been and may again be seen, the Spaniards are unable to resist
French cavalry, and the Switzers are overthrown by Spanish infantry.
And although a complete proof of this latter cannot be shown,
nevertheless there was some evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna,
when the Spanish infantry were confronted by German battalions,
who follow the same tactics as the Swiss; when the Spaniards,
by agility of body and with the aid of their shields, got in under
the pikes of the Germans and stood out of danger, able to attack,
while the Germans stood helpless, and, if the cavalry had not
dashed up, all would have been over with them. It is possible,
therefore, knowing the defects of both these infantries, to invent
a new one, which will resist cavalry and not be afraid of infantry;
this need not create a new order of arms, but a variation upon
the old. And these are the kind of improvements which confer reputation
and power upon a new prince.</p>

<p>This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass
for letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one
express the love with which he would be received in all those
provinces which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings,
with what thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what
devotion, with what tears. What door would be closed to him? Who
would refuse obedience to him? What envy would hinder him? What
Italian would refuse him homage? To all of us this barbarous dominion
stinks. Let, therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge
with that courage and hope with which all just enterprises are
undertaken, so that under its standard our native country may
be ennobled, and under its auspices may be verified that saying
of Petrarch:</p>

<p><em>DESCRIPTION OF THE METHODS ADOPTED BY THE DUKE VALENTINO
WHEN MURDERING VITELLOZZO VITELLI, OLIVEROTTO DA FERMO, THE SIGNOR
PAGOLO, AND THE DUKE DI GRAVINA ORSINI</em></p>

<p>BY <em>NICOLO MACHIAVELLI</em></p>

<p>The Duke Valentino had returned from Lombardy, where he had been
to clear himself with the King of France from the calumnies which
had been raised against him by the Florentines concerning the
rebellion of Arezzo and other towns in the Val di Chiana, and
had arrived at Imola, whence he intended with his army to enter
upon the campaign against Giovanni Bentivogli, the tyrant of Bologna:
for he intended to bring that city under his domination, and to
make it the head of his Romagnian duchy.</p>

<p>These matters coming to the knowledge of the Vitelli and Orsini
and their following, it appeared to them that the duke would become
too powerful, and it was feared that, having seized Bologna, he
would seek to destroy them in order that he might become supreme
in Italy. Upon this a meeting was called at Magione in the district
of Perugia, to which came the cardinal, Pagolo, and the Duke di
Gravina Orsini, Vitellozzo Vitelli, Oliverotto da Fermo, Gianpagolo
Baglioni, the tyrant of Perugia, and Messer Antonio da Venafro,
sent by Pandolfo Petrucci, the Prince of Siena. Here were discussed
the power and courage of the duke and the necessity of curbing
his ambitions, which might otherwise bring danger to the rest
of being ruined. And they decided not to abandon the Bentivogli,
but to strive to win over the Florentines; and they sent their
men to one place and another, promising to one party assistance
and to another encouragement to unite with them against the common
enemy. This meeting was at once reported throughout all Italy,
and those who were discontented under the duke, among whom were
the people of Urbino, took hope of effecting a revolution.</p>

<p>Thus it arose that, men’s minds being thus unsettled, it was
decided by certain men of Urbino to seize the fortress of San
Leo, which was held for the duke, and which they captured by the
following means. The castellan was fortifying the rock and causing
timber to be taken there; so the conspirators watched, and when
certain beams which were being carried to the rock were upon the
bridge, so that it was prevented from being drawn up by those
inside, they took the opportunity of leaping upon the bridge and
thence into the fortress. Upon this capture being effected, the
whole state rebelled and recalled the old duke, being encouraged
in this, not so much by the capture of the fort, as by the Diet
at Magione, from whom they expected to get assistance.</p>

<p>Those who heard of the rebellion at Urbino thought they would
not lose the opportunity, and at once assembled their men so as
to take any town, should any remain in the hands of the duke in
that state; and they sent again to Florence to beg that republic
to join with them in destroying the common firebrand, showing
that the risk was lessened and that they ought not to wait for
another opportunity.</p>

<p>But the Florentines, from hatred, for sundry reasons, of the
Vitelli and Orsini, not only would not ally themselves, but sent
Nicolo Machiavelli, their secretary, to offer shelter and assistance
to the duke against his enemies. The duke was found full of fear
at Imola, because, against everybody’s expectation, his soldiers
had at once gone over to the enemy and he found himself disarmed
and war at his door. But recovering courage from the offers of
the Florentines, he decided to temporize before fighting with
the few soldiers that remained to him, and to negotiate for a
reconciliation, and also to get assistance. This latter he obtained
in two ways, by sending to the King of France for men and by enlisting
men-at-arms and others whom he turned into cavalry of a sort:
to all he gave money.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this, his enemies drew near to him, and approached
Fossombrone, where they encountered some men of the duke and,
with the aid of the Orsini and Vitelli, routed them. When this
happened, the duke resolved at once to see if he could not close
the trouble with offers of reconciliation, and being a most perfect
dissembler he did not fail in any practices to make the insurgents
understand that he wished every man who had acquired anything
to keep it, as it was enough for him to have the title of prince,
whilst others might have the principality.</p>

<p>And the duke succeeded so well in this that they sent Signor
Pagolo to him to negotiate for a reconciliation, and they brought
their army to a standstill. But the duke did not stop his preparations,
and took every care to provide himself with cavalry and infantry,
and that such preparations might not be apparent to the others,
he sent his troops in separate parties to every part of the Romagna.
In the meanwhile there came also to him five hundred French lancers,
and although he found himself sufficiently strong to take vengeance
on his enemies in open war, he considered that it would be safer
and more advantageous to outwit them, and for this reason he did
not stop the work of reconciliation.</p>

<p>And that this might be effected the duke concluded a peace with
them in which he confirmed their former covenants; he gave them
four thousand ducats at once; he promised not to injure the Bentivogli;
and he formed an alliance with Giovanni; and moreover he would
not force them to come personally into his presence unless it
pleased them to do so. On the other hand, they promised to restore
to him the duchy of Urbino and other places seized by them, to
serve him in all his expeditions, and not to make war against
or ally themselves with any one without his permission.</p>

<p>This reconciliation being completed, Guido Ubaldo, the Duke of
Urbino, again fled to Venice, having first destroyed all the fortresses
in his state; because, trusting in the people, he did not wish
that the fortresses, which he did not think he could defend, should
be held by the enemy, since by these means a check would be kept
upon his friends. But the Duke Valentino, having completed this
convention, and dispersed his men throughout the Romagna, set
out for Imola at the end of November together with his French
men-at-arms: thence he went to Cesena, where he stayed some time
to negotiate with the envoys of the Vitelli and Orsini, who had
assembled with their men in the duchy of Urbino, as to the enterprise
in which they should now take part; but nothing being concluded,
Oliverotto da Fermo was sent to propose that if the duke wished
to undertake an expedition against Tuscany they were ready; if
he did not wish it, then they would besiege Sinigalia. To this
the duke replied that he did not wish to enter into war with Tuscany,
and thus become hostile to the Florentines, but that he was very
willing to proceed against Sinigalia.</p>

<p>It happened that not long afterwards the town surrendered, but
the fortress would not yield to them because the castellan would
not give it up to any one but the duke in person; therefore they
exhorted him to come there. This appeared a good opportunity to
the duke, as, being invited by them, and not going of his own
will, he would awaken no suspicions. And the more to reassure
them, he allowed all the French men-at-arms who were with him
in Lombardy to depart, except the hundred lancers under Mons.
di Candales, his brother-in-law. He left Cesena about the middle
of December, and went to Fano, and with the utmost cunning and
cleverness he persuaded the Vitelli and Orsini to wait for him
at Sinigalia, pointing out to them that any lack of compliance
would cast a doubt upon the sincerity and permanency of the reconciliation,
and that he was a man who wished to make use of the arms and councils
of his friends. But Vitellozzo remained very stubborn, for the
death of his brother warned him that he should not offend a prince
and afterwards trust him; nevertheless, persuaded by Pagolo Orsini,
whom the duke had corrupted with gifts and promises, he agreed
to wait.</p>

<p>Upon this the duke, before his departure from Fano, which was
to be on 30th December 1502, communicated his designs to eight
of his most trusted followers, among whom were Don Michele and
the Monsignor d’Euna, who was afterwards cardinal; and he ordered
that, as soon as Vitellozzo, Pagolo Orsini, the Duke di Gravina,
and Oliverotto should arrive, his followers in pairs should take
them one by one, entrusting certain men to certain pairs, who
should entertain them until they reached Sinigalia; nor should
they be permitted to leave until they came to the duke’s quarters,
where they should be seized.</p>

<p>The duke afterwards ordered all his horsemen and infantry, of
which there were more than two thousand cavalry and ten thousand
footmen, to assemble by daybreak at the Metauro, a river five
miles distant from Fano, and await him there. He found himself,
therefore, on the last day of December at the Metauro with his
men, and having sent a cavalcade of about two hundred horsemen
before him, he then moved forward the infantry, whom he accompanied
with the rest of the men-at-arms.</p>

<p>Fano and Sinigalia are two cities of La Marca situated on the
shore of the Adriatic Sea, fifteen miles distant from each other,
so that he who goes towards Sinigalia has the mountains on his
right hand, the bases of which are touched by the sea in some
places. The city of Sinigalia is distant from the foot of the
mountains a little more than a bow-shot and from the shore about
a mile. On the side opposite to the city runs a little river which
bathes that part of the walls looking towards Fano, facing the
high road. Thus he who draws near to Sinigalia comes for a good
space by road along the mountains, and reaches the river which
passes by Sinigalia. If he turns to his left hand along the bank
of it, and goes for the distance of a bow-shot, he arrives at
a bridge which crosses the river; he is then almost abreast of
the gate that leads into Sinigalia, not by a straight line, but
transversely. Before this gate there stands a collection of houses
with a square to which the bank of the river forms one side.</p>

<p>The Vitelli and Orsini having received orders to wait for the
duke, and to honour him in person, sent away their men to several
castles distant from Sinigalia about six miles, so that room could
be made for the men of the duke; and they left in Sinigalia only
Oliverotto and his band, which consisted of one thousand infantry
and one hundred and fifty horsemen, who were quartered in the
suburb mentioned above. Matters having been thus arranged, the
Duke Valentino left for Sinigalia, and when the leaders of the
cavalry reached the bridge they did not pass over, but having
opened it, one portion wheeled towards the river and the other
towards the country, and a way was left in the middle through
which the infantry passed, without stopping, into the town.</p>

<p>Vitellozzo, Pagolo, and the Duke di Gravina on mules, accompanied
by a few horsemen, went towards the duke; Vitellozo, unarmed and
wearing a cape lined with green, appeared very dejected, as if
conscious of his approaching death—a circumstance which, in view
of the ability of the man and his former fortune, caused some
amazement. And it is said that when he parted from his men before
setting out for Sinigalia to meet the duke he acted as if it were
his last parting from them. He recommended his house and its fortunes
to his captains, and advised his nephews that it was not the fortune
of their house, but the virtues of their fathers that should be
kept in mind. These three, therefore, came before the duke and
saluted him respectfully, and were received by him with goodwill;
they were at once placed between those who were commissioned to
look after them.</p>

<p>But the duke noticing that Oliverotto, who had remained with
his band in Sinigalia, was missing—for Oliverotto was waiting
in the square before his quarters near the river, keeping his
men in order and drilling them—signalled with his eye to Don Michelle,
to whom the care of Oliverotto had been committed, that he should
take measures that Oliverotto should not escape. Therefore Don
Michele rode off and joined Oliverotto, telling him that it was
not right to keep his men out of their quarters, because these
might be taken up by the men of the duke; and he advised him to
send them at once to their quarters and to come himself to meet
the duke. And Oliverotto, having taken this advice, came before
the duke, who, when he saw him, called to him; and Oliverotto,
having made his obeisance, joined the others.</p>

<p>So the whole party entered Sinigalia, dismounted at the duke’s
quarters, and went with him into a secret chamber, where the duke
made them prisoners; he then mounted on horseback, and issued
orders that the men of Oliverotto and the Orsini should be stripped
of their arms. Those of Oliverotto, being at hand, were quickly
settled, but those of the Orsini and Vitelli, being at a distance,
and having a presentiment of the destruction of their masters,
had time to prepare themselves, and bearing in mind the valour
and discipline of the Orsinian and Vitellian houses, they stood
together against the hostile forces of the country and saved themselves.</p>

<p>But the duke’s soldiers, not being content with having pillaged
the men of Oliverotto, began to sack Sinigalia, and if the duke
had not repressed this outrage by killing some of them they would
have completely sacked it. Night having come and the tumult being
silenced, the duke prepared to kill Vitellozzo and Oliverotto;
he led them into a room and caused them to be strangled. Neither
of them used words in keeping with their past lives: Vitellozzo
prayed that he might ask of the pope full pardon for his sins;
Oliverotto cringed and laid the blame for all injuries against
the duke on Vitellozzo. Pagolo and the Duke di Gravina Orsini
were kept alive until the duke heard from Rome that the pope had
taken the Cardinal Orsino, the Archbishop of Florence, and Messer
Jacopo da Santa Croce. After which news, on 18th January 1502,
in the castle of Pieve, they also were strangled in the same way.</p>

<p><em>THE LIFE OF CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI OF LUCCA</em></p>

<p><em>WRITTEN BY NICOLO MACHIAVELLI</em></p>

<p>And sent to his friends <em>ZANOBI BUONDELMONTI </em>And <em>LUIGI
ALAMANNI</em></p>

<p><em>CASTRUCCIO CASTRACANI 1284-1328</em></p>

<p>It appears, dearest Zanobi and Luigi, a wonderful thing to those
who have considered the matter, that all men, or the larger number
of them, who have performed great deeds in the world, and excelled
all others in their day, have had their birth and beginning in
baseness and obscurity; or have been aggrieved by Fortune in some
outrageous way. They have either been exposed to the mercy of
wild beasts, or they have had so mean a parentage that in shame
they have given themselves out to be sons of Jove or of some other
deity. It would be wearisome to relate who these persons may have
been because they are well known to everybody, and, as such tales
would not be particularly edifying to those who read them, they
are omitted. I believe that these lowly beginnings of great men
occur because Fortune is desirous of showing to the world that
such men owe much to her and little to wisdom, because she begins
to show her hand when wisdom can really take no part in their
career: thus all success must be attributed to her. Castruccio
Castracani of Lucca was one of those men who did great deeds,
if he is measured by the times in which he lived and the city
in which he was born; but, like many others, he was neither fortunate
nor distinguished in his birth, as the course of this history
will show. It appeared to be desirable to recall his memory, because
I have discerned in him such indications of valour and fortune
as should make him a great exemplar to men. I think also that
I ought to call your attention to his actions, because you of
all men I know delight most in noble deeds.</p>

<p>The family of Castracani was formerly numbered among the noble
families of Lucca, but in the days of which I speak it had somewhat
fallen in estate, as so often happens in this world. To this family
was born a son Antonio, who became a priest of the order of San
Michele of Lucca, and for this reason was honoured with the title
of Messer Antonio. He had an only sister, who had been married
to Buonaccorso Cenami, but Buonaccorso dying she became a widow,
and not wishing to marry again went to live with her brother.
Messer Antonio had a vineyard behind the house where he resided,
and as it was bounded on all sides by gardens, any person could
have access to it without difficulty. One morning, shortly after
sunrise, Madonna Dianora, as the sister of Messer Antonio was
called, had occasion to go into the vineyard as usual to gather
herbs for seasoning the dinner, and hearing a slight rustling
among the leaves of a vine she turned her eyes in that direction,
and heard something resembling the cry of an infant. Whereupon
she went towards it, and saw the hands and face of a baby who
was lying enveloped in the leaves and who seemed to be crying
for its mother. Partly wondering and partly fearing, yet full
of compassion, she lifted it up and carried it to the house, where
she washed it and clothed it with clean linen as is customary,
and showed it to Messer Antonio when he returned home. When he
heard what had happened and saw the child he was not less surprised
or compassionate than his sister. They discussed between themselves
what should be done, and seeing that he was priest and that she
had no children, they finally determined to bring it up. They
had a nurse for it, and it was reared and loved as if it were
their own child. They baptized it, and gave it the name of Castruccio
after their father. As the years passed Castruccio grew very handsome,
and gave evidence of wit and discretion, and learnt with a quickness
beyond his years those lessons which Messer Antonio imparted to
him. Messer Antonio intended to make a priest of him, and in time
would have inducted him into his canonry and other benefices,
and all his instruction was given with this object; but Antonio
discovered that the character of Castruccio was quite unfitted
for the priesthood. As soon as Castruccio reached the age of fourteen
he began to take less notice of the chiding of Messer Antonio
and Madonna Dianora and no longer to fear them; he left off reading
ecclesiastical books, and turned to playing with arms, delighting
in nothing so much as in learning their uses, and in running,
leaping, and wrestling with other boys. In all exercises he far
excelled his companions in courage and bodily strength, and if
at any time he did turn to books, only those pleased him which
told of wars and the mighty deeds of men. Messer Antonio beheld
all this with vexation and sorrow.</p>

<p>There lived in the city of Lucca a gentleman of the Guinigi family,
named Messer Francesco, whose profession was arms and who in riches,
bodily strength, and valour excelled all other men in Lucca. He
had often fought under the command of the Visconti of Milan, and
as a Ghibelline was the valued leader of that party in Lucca.
This gentleman resided in Lucca and was accustomed to assemble
with others most mornings and evenings under the balcony of the
Podesta, which is at the top of the square of San Michele, the
finest square in Lucca, and he had often seen Castruccio taking
part with other children of the street in those games of which
I have spoken. Noticing that Castruccio far excelled the other
boys, and that he appeared to exercise a royal authority over
them, and that they loved and obeyed him, Messer Francesco became
greatly desirous of learning who he was. Being informed of the
circumstances of the bringing up of Castruccio he felt a greater
desire to have him near to him. Therefore he called him one day
and asked him whether he would more willingly live in the house
of a gentleman, where he would learn to ride horses and use arms,
or in the house of a priest, where he would learn nothing but
masses and the services of the Church. Messer Francesco could
see that it pleased Castruccio greatly to hear horses and arms
spoken of, even though he stood silent, blushing modestly; but
being encouraged by Messer Francesco to speak, he answered that,
if his master were agreeable, nothing would please him more than
to give up his priestly studies and take up those of a soldier.
This reply delighted Messer Francesco, and in a very short time
he obtained the consent of Messer Antonio, who was driven to yield
by his knowledge of the nature of the lad, and the fear that he
would not be able to hold him much longer.</p>

<p>Thus Castruccio passed from the house of Messer Antonio the priest
to the house of Messer Francesco Guinigi the soldier, and it was
astonishing to find that in a very short time he manifested all
that virtue and bearing which we are accustomed to associate with
a true gentleman. In the first place he became an accomplished
horseman, and could manage with ease the most fiery charger, and
in all jousts and tournaments, although still a youth, he was
observed beyond all others, and he excelled in all exercises of
strength and dexterity. But what enhanced so much the charm of
these accomplishments, was the delightful modesty which enabled
him to avoid offence in either act or word to others, for he was
deferential to the great men, modest with his equals, and courteous
to his inferiors. These gifts made him beloved, not only by all
the Guinigi family, but by all Lucca. When Castruccio had reached
his eighteenth year, the Ghibellines were driven from Pavia by
the Guelphs, and Messer Francesco was sent by the Visconti to
assist the Ghibellines, and with him went Castruccio, in charge
of his forces. Castruccio gave ample proof of his prudence and
courage in this expedition, acquiring greater reputation than
any other captain, and his name and fame were known, not only
in Pavia, but throughout all Lombardy.</p>

<p>Castruccio, having returned to Lucca in far higher estimation
than he left it, did not omit to use all the means in his power
to gain as many friends as he could, neglecting none of those
arts which are necessary for that purpose. About this time Messer
Francesco died, leaving a son thirteen years of age named Pagolo,
and having appointed Castruccio to be his son’s tutor and administrator
of his estate. Before he died Francesco called Castruccio to him,
and prayed him to show Pagolo that goodwill which he (Francesco)
had always shown to <em>HIM, </em>and to render to the son the
gratitude which he had not been able to repay to the father. Upon
the death of Francesco, Castruccio became the governor and tutor
of Pagolo, which increased enormously his power and position,
and created a certain amount of envy against him in Lucca in place
of the former universal goodwill, for many men suspected him of
harbouring tyrannical intentions. Among these the leading man
was Giorgio degli Opizi, the head of the Guelph party. This man
hoped after the death of Messer Francesco to become the chief
man in Lucca, but it seemed to him that Castruccio, with the great
abilities which he already showed, and holding the position of
governor, deprived him of his opportunity; therefore he began
to sow those seeds which should rob Castruccio of his eminence.
Castruccio at first treated this with scorn, but afterwards he
grew alarmed, thinking that Messer Giorgio might be able to bring
him into disgrace with the deputy of King Ruberto of Naples and
have him driven out of Lucca.</p>

<p>The Lord of Pisa at that time was Uguccione of the Faggiuola
of Arezzo, who being in the first place elected their captain
afterwards became their lord. There resided in Paris some exiled
Ghibellines from Lucca, with whom Castruccio held communications
with the object of effecting their restoration by the help of
Uguccione. Castruccio also brought into his plans friends from
Lucca who would not endure the authority of the Opizi. Having
fixed upon a plan to be followed, Castruccio cautiously fortified
the tower of the Onesti, filling it with supplies and munitions
of war, in order that it might stand a siege for a few days in
case of need. When the night came which had been agreed upon with
Uguccione, who had occupied the plain between the mountains and
Pisa with many men, the signal was given, and without being observed
Uguccione approached the gate of San Piero and set fire to the
portcullis. Castruccio raised a great uproar within the city,
calling the people to arms and forcing open the gate from his
side. Uguccione entered with his men, poured through the town,
and killed Messer Giorgio with all his family and many of his
friends and supporters. The governor was driven out, and the government
reformed according to the wishes of Uguccione, to the detriment
of the city, because it was found that more than one hundred families
were exiled at that time. Of those who fled, part went to Florence
and part to Pistoia, which city was the headquarters of the Guelph
party, and for this reason it became most hostile to Uguccione
and the Lucchese.</p>

<p>As it now appeared to the Florentines and others of the Guelph
party that the Ghibellines absorbed too much power in Tuscany,
they determined to restore the exiled Guelphs to Lucca. They assembled
a large army in the Val di Nievole, and seized Montecatini; from
thence they marched to Montecarlo, in order to secure the free
passage into Lucca. Upon this Uguccione assembled his Pisan and
Lucchese forces, and with a number of German cavalry which he
drew out of Lombardy, he moved against the quarters of the Florentines,
who upon the appearance of the enemy withdrew from Montecarlo,
and posted themselves between Montecatini and Pescia. Uguccione
now took up a position near to Montecarlo, and within about two
miles of the enemy, and slight skirmishes between the horse of
both parties were of daily occurrence. Owing to the illness of
Uguccione, the Pisans and Lucchese delayed coming to battle with
the enemy. Uguccione, finding himself growing worse, went to Montecarlo
to be cured, and left the command of the army in the hands of
Castruccio. This change brought about the ruin of the Guelphs,
who, thinking that the hostile army having lost its captain had
lost its head, grew over-confident. Castruccio observed this,
and allowed some days to pass in order to encourage this belief;
he also showed signs of fear, and did not allow any of the munitions
of the camp to be used. On the other side, the Guelphs grew more
insolent the more they saw these evidences of fear, and every
day they drew out in the order of battle in front of the army
of Castruccio. Presently, deeming that the enemy was sufficiently
emboldened, and having mastered their tactics, he decided to join
battle with them. First he spoke a few words of encouragement
to his soldiers, and pointed out to them the certainty of victory
if they would but obey his commands. Castruccio had noticed how
the enemy had placed all his best troops in the centre of the
line of battle, and his less reliable men on the wings of the
army; whereupon he did exactly the opposite, putting his most
valiant men on the flanks, while those on whom he could not so
strongly rely he moved to the centre. Observing this order of
battle, he drew out of his lines and quickly came in sight of
the hostile army, who, as usual, had come in their insolence to
defy him. He then commanded his centre squadrons to march slowly,
whilst he moved rapidly forward those on the wings. Thus, when
they came into contact with the enemy, only the wings of the two
armies became engaged, whilst the center battalions remained out
of action, for these two portions of the line of battle were separated
from each other by a long interval and thus unable to reach each
other. By this expedient the more valiant part of Castruccio’s
men were opposed to the weaker part of the enemy’s troops, and
the most efficient men of the enemy were disengaged; and thus
the Florentines were unable to fight with those who were arrayed
opposite to them, or to give any assistance to their own flanks.
So, without much difficulty, Castruccio put the enemy to flight
on both flanks, and the centre battalions took to flight when
they found themselves exposed to attack, without having a chance
of displaying their valour. The defeat was complete, and the loss
in men very heavy, there being more than ten thousand men killed
with many officers and knights of the Guelph party in Tuscany,
and also many princes who had come to help them, among whom were
Piero, the brother of King Ruberto, and Carlo, his nephew, and
Filippo, the lord of Taranto. On the part of Castruccio the loss
did not amount to more than three hundred men, among whom was
Francesco, the son of Uguccione, who, being young and rash, was
killed in the first onset.</p>

<p>This victory so greatly increased the reputation of Castruccio
that Uguccione conceived some jealousy and suspicion of him, because
it appeared to Uguccione that this victory had given him no increase
of power, but rather than diminished it. Being of this mind, he
only waited for an opportunity to give effect to it. This occurred
on the death of Pier Agnolo Micheli, a man of great repute and
abilities in Lucca, the murderer of whom fled to the house of
Castruccio for refuge. On the sergeants of the captain going to
arrest the murderer, they were driven off by Castruccio, and the
murderer escaped. This affair coming to the knowledge of Uguccione,
who was then at Pisa, it appeared to him a proper opportunity
to punish Castruccio. He therefore sent for his son Neri, who
was the governor of Lucca, and commissioned him to take Castruccio
prisoner at a banquet and put him to death. Castruccio, fearing
no evil, went to the governor in a friendly way, was entertained
at supper, and then thrown into prison. But Neri, fearing to put
him to death lest the people should be incensed, kept him alive,
in order to hear further from his father concerning his intentions.
Ugucionne cursed the hesitation and cowardice of his son, and
at once set out from Pisa to Lucca with four hundred horsemen
to finish the business in his own way; but he had not yet reached
the baths when the Pisans rebelled and put his deputy to death
and created Count Gaddo della Gherardesca their lord. Before Uguccione
reached Lucca he heard of the occurrences at Pisa, but it did
not appear wise to him to turn back, lest the Lucchese with the
example of Pisa before them should close their gates against him.
But the Lucchese, having heard of what had happened at Pisa, availed
themselves of this opportunity to demand the liberation of Castruccio,
notwithstanding that Uguccione had arrived in their city. They
first began to speak of it in private circles, afterwards openly
in the squares and streets; then they raised a tumult, and with
arms in their hands went to Uguccione and demanded that Castruccio
should be set at liberty. Uguccione, fearing that worse might
happen, released him from prison. Whereupon Castruccio gathered
his friends around him, and with the help of the people attacked
Uguccione; who, finding he had no resource but in flight, rode
away with his friends to Lombardy, to the lords of Scale, where
he died in poverty.</p>

<p>But Castruccio from being a prisoner became almost a prince in
Lucca, and he carried himself so discreetly with his friends and
the people that they appointed him captain of their army for one
year. Having obtained this, and wishing to gain renown in war,
he planned the recovery of the many towns which had rebelled after
the departure of Uguccione, and with the help of the Pisans, with
whom he had concluded a treaty, he marched to Serezzana. To capture
this place he constructed a fort against it, which is called to-day
Zerezzanello; in the course of two months Castruccio captured
the town. With the reputation gained at that siege, he rapidly
seized Massa, Carrara, and Lavenza, and in a short time had overrun
the whole of Lunigiana. In order to close the pass which leads
from Lombardy to Lunigiana, he besieged Pontremoli and wrested
it from the hands of Messer Anastagio Palavicini, who was the
lord of it. After this victory he returned to Lucca, and was welcomed
by the whole people. And now Castruccio, deeming it imprudent
any longer to defer making himself a prince, got himself created
the lord of Lucca by the help of Pazzino del Poggio, Puccinello
dal Portico, Francesco Boccansacchi, and Cecco Guinigi, all of
whom he had corrupted; and he was afterwards solemnly and deliberately
elected prince by the people. At this time Frederick of Bavaria,
the King of the Romans, came into Italy to assume the Imperial
crown, and Castruccio, in order that he might make friends with
him, met him at the head of five hundred horsemen. Castruccio
had left as his deputy in Lucca, Pagolo Guinigi, who was held
in high estimation, because of the people’s love for the memory
of his father. Castruccio was received in great honour by Frederick,
and many privileges were conferred upon him, and he was appointed
the emperor’s lieutenant in Tuscany. At this time the Pisans were
in great fear of Gaddo della Gherardesca, whom they had driven
out of Pisa, and they had recourse for assistance to Frederick.
Frederick created Castruccio the lord of Pisa, and the Pisans,
in dread of the Guelph party, and particularly of the Florentines,
were constrained to accept him as their lord.</p>

<p>Frederick, having appointed a governor in Rome to watch his Italian
affairs, returned to Germany. All the Tuscan and Lombardian Ghibellines,
who followed the imperial lead, had recourse to Castruccio for
help and counsel, and all promised him the governorship of his
country, if enabled to recover it with his assistance. Among these
exiles were Matteo Guidi, Nardo Scolari, Lapo Uberti, Gerozzo
Nardi, and Piero Buonaccorsi, all exiled Florentines and Ghibellines.
Castruccio had the secret intention of becoming the master of
all Tuscany by the aid of these men and of his own forces; and
in order to gain greater weight in affairs, he entered into a
league with Messer Matteo Visconti, the Prince of Milan, and organized
for him the forces of his city and the country districts. As Lucca
had five gates, he divided his own country districts into five
parts, which he supplied with arms, and enrolled the men under
captains and ensigns, so that he could quickly bring into the
field twenty thousand soldiers, without those whom he could summon
to his assistance from Pisa. While he surrounded himself with
these forces and allies, it happened at Messer Matteo Visconti
was attacked by the Guelphs of Piacenza, who had driven out the
Ghibellines with the assistance of a Florentine army and the King
Ruberto. Messer Matteo called upon Castruccio to invade the Florentines
in their own territories, so that, being attacked at home, they
should be compelled to draw their army out of Lombardy in order
to defend themselves. Castruccio invaded the Valdarno, and seized
Fucecchio and San Miniato, inflicting immense damage upon the
country. Whereupon the Florentines recalled their army, which
had scarcely reached Tuscany, when Castruccio was forced by other
necessities to return to Lucca.</p>

<p>There resided in the city of Lucca the Poggio family, who were
so powerful that they could not only elevate Castruccio, but even
advance him to the dignity of prince; and it appearing to them
they had not received such rewards for their services as they
deserved, they incited other families to rebel and to drive Castruccio
out of Lucca. They found their opportunity one morning, and arming
themselves, they set upon the lieutenant whom Castruccio had left
to maintain order and killed him. They endeavoured to raise the
people in revolt, but Stefano di Poggio, a peaceable old man who
had taken no hand in the rebellion, intervened and compelled them
by his authority to lay down their arms; and he offered to be
their mediator with Castruccio to obtain from him what they desired.
Therefore they laid down their arms with no greater intelligence
than they had taken them up. Castruccio, having heard the news
of what had happened at Lucca, at once put Pagolo Guinigi in command
of the army, and with a troop of cavalry set out for home. Contrary
to his expectations, he found the rebellion at an end, yet he
posted his men in the most advantageous places throughout the
city. As it appeared to Stefano that Castruccio ought to be very
much obliged to him, he sought him out, and without saying anything
on his own behalf, for he did not recognize any need for doing
so, he begged Castruccio to pardon the other members of his family
by reason of their youth, their former friendships, and the obligations
which Castruccio was under to their house. To this Castruccio
graciously responded, and begged Stefano to reassure himself,
declaring that it gave him more pleasure to find the tumult at
an end than it had ever caused him anxiety to hear of its inception.
He encouraged Stefano to bring his family to him, saying that
he thanked God for having given him the opportunity of showing
his clemency and liberality. Upon the word of Stefano and Castruccio
they surrendered, and with Stefano were immediately thrown into
prison and put to death. Meanwhile the Florentines had recovered
San Miniato, whereupon it seemed advisable to Castruccio to make
peace, as it did not appear to him that he was sufficiently secure
at Lucca to leave him. He approached the Florentines with the
proposal of a truce, which they readily entertained, for they
were weary of the war, and desirous of getting rid of the expenses
of it. A treaty was concluded with them for two years, by which
both parties agreed to keep the conquests they had made. Castruccio
thus released from this trouble, turned his attention to affairs
in Lucca, and in order that he should not again be subject to
the perils from which he had just escaped, he, under various pretences
and reasons, first wiped out all those who by their ambition might
aspire to the principality; not sparing one of them, but depriving
them of country and property, and those whom he had in his hands
of life also, stating that he had found by experience that none
of them were to be trusted. Then for his further security he raised
a fortress in Lucca with the stones of the towers of those whom
he had killed or hunted out of the state.</p>

<p>Whilst Castruccio made peace with the Florentines, and strengthened
his position in Lucca, he neglected no opportunity, short of open
war, of increasing his importance elsewhere. It appeared to him
that if he could get possession of Pistoia, he would have one
foot in Florence, which was his great desire. He, therefore, in
various ways made friends with the mountaineers, and worked matters
so in Pistoia that both parties confided their secrets to him.
Pistoia was divided, as it always had been, into the Bianchi and
Neri parties; the head of the Bianchi was Bastiano di Possente,
and of the Neri, Jacopo da Gia. Each of these men held secret
communications with Castruccio, and each desired to drive the
other out of the city; and, after many threatenings, they came
to blows. Jacopo fortified himself at the Florentine gate, Bastiano
at that of the Lucchese side of the city; both trusted more in
Castruccio than in the Florentines, because they believed that
Castruccio was far more ready and willing to fight than the Florentines,
and they both sent to him for assistance. He gave promises to
both, saying to Bastiano that he would come in person, and to
Jacopo that he would send his pupil, Pagolo Guinigi. At the appointed
time he sent forward Pagolo by way of Pisa, and went himself direct
to Pistoia; at midnight both of them met outside the city, and
both were admitted as friends. Thus the two leaders entered, and
at a signal given by Castruccio, one killed Jacopo da Gia, and
the other Bastiano di Possente, and both took prisoners or killed
the partisans of either faction. Without further opposition Pistoia
passed into the hands of Castruccio, who, having forced the Signoria
to leave the palace, compelled the people to yield obedience to
him, making them many promises and remitting their old debts.
The countryside flocked to the city to see the new prince, and
all were filled with hope and quickly settled down, influenced
in a great measure by his great valour.</p>

<p>About this time great disturbances arose in Rome, owing to the
dearness of living which was caused by the absence of the pontiff
at Avignon. The German governor, Enrico, was much blamed for what
happened—murders and tumults following each other daily, without
his being able to put an end to them. This caused Enrico much
anxiety lest the Romans should call in Ruberto, the King of Naples,
who would drive the Germans out of the city, and bring back the
Pope. Having no nearer friend to whom he could apply for help
than Castruccio, he sent to him, begging him not only to give
him assistance, but also to come in person to Rome. Castruccio
considered that he ought not to hesitate to render the emperor
this service, because he believed that he himself would not be
safe if at any time the emperor ceased to hold Rome. Leaving Pagolo
Guinigi in command at Lucca, Castruccio set out for Rome with
six hundred horsemen, where he was received by Enrico with the
greatest distinction. In a short time the presence of Castruccio
obtained such respect for the emperor that, without bloodshed
or violence, good order was restored, chiefly by reason of Castruccio
having sent by sea from the country round Pisa large quantities
of corn, and thus removed the source of the trouble. When he had
chastised some of the Roman leaders, and admonished others, voluntary
obedience was rendered to Enrico. Castruccio received many honours,
and was made a Roman senator. This dignity was assumed with the
greatest pomp, Castruccio being clothed in a brocaded toga, which
had the following words embroidered on its front: "I am what God
wills." Whilst on the back was: "What God desires shall be."</p>

<p>During this time the Florentines, who were much enraged that
Castruccio should have seized Pistoia during the truce, considered
how they could tempt the city to rebel, to do which they thought
would not be difficult in his absence. Among the exiled Pistoians
in Florence were Baldo Cecchi and Jacopo Baldini, both men of
leading and ready to face danger. These men kept up communications
with their friends in Pistoia, and with the aid of the Florentines
entered the city by night, and after driving out some of Castruccio’s
officials and partisans, and killing others, they restored the
city to its freedom. The news of this greatly angered Castruccio,
and taking leave of Enrico, he pressed on in great haste to Pistoia.
When the Florentines heard of his return, knowing that he would
lose no time, they decided to intercept him with their forces
in the Val di Nievole, under the belief that by doing so they
would cut off his road to Pistoia. Assembling a great army of
the supporters of the Guelph cause, the Florentines entered the
Pistoian territories. On the other hand, Castruccio reached Montecarlo
with his army; and having heard where the Florentines’ lay, he
decided not to encounter it in the plains of Pistoia, nor to await
it in the plains of Pescia, but, as far as he possibly could,
to attack it boldly in the Pass of Serravalle. He believed that
if he succeeded in this design, victory was assured, although
he was informed that the Florentines had thirty thousand men,
whilst he had only twelve thousand. Although he had every confidence
in his own abilities and the valour of his troops, yet he hesitated
to attack his enemy in the open lest he should be overwhelmed
by numbers. Serravalle is a castle between Pescia and Pistoia,
situated on a hill which blocks the Val di Nievole, not in the
exact pass, but about a bowshot beyond; the pass itself is in
places narrow and steep, whilst in general it ascends gently,
but is still narrow, especially at the summit where the waters
divide, so that twenty men side by side could hold it. The lord
of Serravalle was Manfred, a German, who, before Castruccio became
lord of Pistoia, had been allowed to remain in possession of the
castle, it being common to the Lucchese and the Pistoians, and
unclaimed by either—neither of them wishing to displace Manfred
as long as he kept his promise of neutrality, and came under obligations
to no one. For these reasons, and also because the castle was
well fortified, he had always been able to maintain his position.
It was here that Castruccio had determined to fall upon his enemy,
for here his few men would have the advantage, and there was no
fear lest, seeing the large masses of the hostile force before
they became engaged, they should not stand. As soon as this trouble
with Florence arose, Castruccio saw the immense advantage which
possession of this castle would give him, and having an intimate
friendship with a resident in the castle, he managed matters so
with him that four hundred of his men were to be admitted into
the castle the night before the attack on the Florentines, and
the castellan put to death.</p>

<p>Castruccio, having prepared everything, had now to encourage
the Florentines to persist in their desire to carry the seat of
war away from Pistoia into the Val di Nievole, therefore he did
not move his army from Montecarlo. Thus the Florentines hurried
on until they reached their encampment under Serravalle, intending
to cross the hill on the following morning. In the meantime, Castruccio
had seized the castle at night, had also moved his army from Montecarlo,
and marching from thence at midnight in dead silence, had reached
the foot of Serravalle: thus he and the Florentines commenced
the ascent of the hill at the same time in the morning. Castruccio
sent forward his infantry by the main road, and a troop of four
hundred horsemen by a path on the left towards the castle. The
Florentines sent forward four hundred cavalry ahead of their army
which was following, never expecting to find Castruccio in possession
of the hill, nor were they aware of his having seized the castle.
Thus it happened that the Florentine horsemen mounting the hill
were completely taken by surprise when they discovered the infantry
of Castruccio, and so close were they upon it they had scarcely
time to pull down their visors. It was a case of unready soldiers
being attacked by ready, and they were assailed with such vigour
that with difficulty they could hold their own, although some
few of them got through. When the noise of the fighting reached
the Florentine camp below, it was filled with confusion. The cavalry
and infantry became inextricably mixed: the captains were unable
to get their men either backward or forward, owing to the narrowness
of the pass, and amid all this tumult no one knew what ought to
be done or what could be done. In a short time the cavalry who
were engaged with the enemy’s infantry were scattered or killed
without having made any effective defence because of their unfortunate
position, although in sheer desperation they had offered a stout
resistance. Retreat had been impossible, with the mountains on
both flanks, whilst in front were their enemies, and in the rear
their friends. When Castruccio saw that his men were unable to
strike a decisive blow at the enemy and put them to flight, he
sent one thousand infantrymen round by the castle, with orders
to join the four hundred horsemen he had previously dispatched
there, and commanded the whole force to fall upon the flank of
the enemy. These orders they carried out with such fury that the
Florentines could not sustain the attack, but gave way, and were
soon in full retreat—conquered more by their unfortunate position
than by the valour of their enemy. Those in the rear turned towards
Pistoia, and spread through the plains, each man seeking only
his own safety. The defeat was complete and very sanguinary. Many
captains were taken prisoners, among whom were Bandini dei Rossi,
Francesco Brunelleschi, and Giovanni della Tosa, all Florentine
noblemen, with many Tuscans and Neapolitans who fought on the
Florentine side, having been sent by King Ruberto to assist the
Guelphs. Immediately the Pistoians heard of this defeat they drove
out the friends of the Guelphs, and surrendered to Castruccio.
He was not content with occupying Prato and all the castles on
the plains on both sides of the Arno, but marched his army into
the plain of Peretola, about two miles from Florence. Here he
remained many days, dividing the spoils, and celebrating his victory
with feasts and games, holding horse races, and foot races for
men and women. He also struck medals in commemoration of the defeat
of the Florentines. He endeavoured to corrupt some of the citizens
of Florence, who were to open the city gates at night; but the
conspiracy was discovered, and the participators in it taken and
beheaded, among whom were Tommaso Lupacci and Lambertuccio Frescobaldi.
This defeat caused the Florentines great anxiety, and despairing
of preserving their liberty, they sent envoys to King Ruberto
of Naples, offering him the dominion of their city; and he, knowing
of what immense importance the maintenance of the Guelph cause
was to him, accepted it. He agreed with the Florentines to receive
from them a yearly tribute of two hundred thousand florins, and
he sent his son Carlo to Florence with four thousand horsemen.</p>

<p>Shortly after this the Florentines were relieved in some degree
of the pressure of Castruccio’s army, owing to his being compelled
to leave his positions before Florence and march on Pisa, in order
to suppress a conspiracy that had been raised against him by Benedetto
Lanfranchi, one of the first men in Pisa, who could not endure
that his fatherland should be under the dominion of the Lucchese.
He had formed this conspiracy, intending to seize the citadel,
kill the partisans of Castruccio, and drive out the garrison.
As, however, in a conspiracy paucity of numbers is essential to
secrecy, so for its execution a few are not sufficient, and in
seeking more adherents to his conspiracy Lanfranchi encountered
a person who revealed the design to Castruccio. This betrayal
cannot be passed by without severe reproach to Bonifacio Cerchi
and Giovanni Guidi, two Florentine exiles who were suffering their
banishment in Pisa. Thereupon Castruccio seized Benedetto and
put him to death, and beheaded many other noble citizens, and
drove their families into exile. It now appeared to Castruccio
that both Pisa and Pistoia were thoroughly disaffected; he employed
much thought and energy upon securing his position there, and
this gave the Florentines their opportunity to reorganize their
army, and to await the coming of Carlo, the son of the King of
Naples. When Carlo arrived they decided to lose no more time,
and assembled a great army of more than thirty thousand infantry
and ten thousand cavalry—having called to their aid every Guelph
there was in Italy. They consulted whether they should attack
Pistoia or Pisa first, and decided that it would be better to
march on the latter—a course, owing to the recent conspiracy,
more likely to succeed, and of more advantage to them, because
they believed that the surrender of Pistoia would follow the acquisition
of Pisa.</p>

<p>In the early part of May 1328, the Florentines put in motion
this army and quickly occupied Lastra, Signa, Montelupo, and Empoli,
passing from thence on to San Miniato. When Castruccio heard of
the enormous army which the Florentines were sending against him,
he was in no degree alarmed, believing that the time had now arrived
when Fortune would deliver the empire of Tuscany into his hands,
for he had no reason to think that his enemy would make a better
fight, or had better prospects of success, than at Pisa or Serravalle.
He assembled twenty thousand foot soldiers and four thousand horsemen,
and with this army went to Fucecchio, whilst he sent Pagolo Guinigi
to Pisa with five thousand infantry. Fucecchio has a stronger
position than any other town in the Pisan district, owing to its
situation between the rivers Arno and Gusciana and its slight
elevation above the surrounding plain. Moreover, the enemy could
not hinder its being victualled unless they divided their forces,
nor could they approach it either from the direction of Lucca
or Pisa, nor could they get through to Pisa, or attack Castruccio’s
forces except at a disadvantage. In one case they would find themselves
placed between his two armies, the one under his own command and
the other under Pagolo, and in the other case they would have
to cross the Arno to get to close quarters with the enemy, an
undertaking of great hazard. In order to tempt the Florentines
to take this latter course, Castruccio withdrew his men from the
banks of the river and placed them under the walls of Fucecchio,
leaving a wide expanse of land between them and the river.</p>

<p>The Florentines, having occupied San Miniato, held a council
of war to decide whether they should attack Pisa or the army of
Castruccio, and, having weighed the difficulties of both courses,
they decided upon the latter. The river Arno was at that time
low enough to be fordable, yet the water reached to the shoulders
of the infantrymen and to the saddles of the horsemen. On the
morning of 10 June 1328, the Florentines commenced the battle
by ordering forward a number of cavalry and ten thousand infantry.
Castruccio, whose plan of action was fixed, and who well knew
what to do, at once attacked the Florentines with five thousand
infantry and three thousand horsemen, not allowing them to issue
from the river before he charged them; he also sent one thousand
light infantry up the river bank, and the same number down the
Arno. The infantry of the Florentines were so much impeded by
their arms and the water that they were not able to mount the
banks of the river, whilst the cavalry had made the passage of
the river more difficult for the others, by reason of the few
who had crossed having broken up the bed of the river, and this
being deep with mud, many of the horses rolled over with their
riders and many of them had stuck so fast that they could not
move. When the Florentine captains saw the difficulties their
men were meeting, they withdrew them and moved higher up the river,
hoping to find the river bed less treacherous and the banks more
adapted for landing. These men were met at the bank by the forces
which Castruccio had already sent forward, who, being light armed
with bucklers and javelins in their hands, let fly with tremendous
shouts into the faces and bodies of the cavalry. The horses, alarmed
by the noise and the wounds, would not move forward, and trampled
each other in great confusion. The fight between the men of Castruccio
and those of the enemy who succeeded in crossing was sharp and
terrible; both sides fought with the utmost desperation and neither
would yield. The soldiers of Castruccio fought to drive the others
back into the river, whilst the Florentines strove to get a footing
on land in order to make room for the others pressing forward,
who if they could but get out of the water would be able to fight,
and in this obstinate conflict they were urged on by their captains.
Castruccio shouted to his men that these were the same enemies
whom they had before conquered at Serravalle, whilst the Florentines
reproached each other that the many should be overcome by the
few. At length Castruccio, seeing how long the battle had lasted,
and that both his men and the enemy were utterly exhausted, and
that both sides had many killed and wounded, pushed forward another
body of infantry to take up a position at the rear of those who
were fighting; he then commanded these latter to open their ranks
as if they intended to retreat, and one part of them to turn to
the right and another to the left. This cleared a space of which
the Florentines at once took advantage, and thus gained possession
of a portion of the battlefield. But when these tired soldiers
found themselves at close quarters with Castruccio’s reserves
they could not stand against them and at once fell back into the
river. The cavalry of either side had not as yet gained any decisive
advantage over the other, because Castruccio, knowing his inferiority
in this arm, had commanded his leaders only to stand on the defensive
against the attacks of their adversaries, as he hoped that when
he had overcome the infantry he would be able to make short work
of the cavalry. This fell out as he had hoped, for when he saw
the Florentine army driven back across the river he ordered the
remainder of his infantry to attack the cavalry of the enemy.
This they did with lance and javelin, and, joined by their own
cavalry, fell upon the enemy with the greatest fury and soon put
him to flight. The Florentine captains, having seen the difficulty
their cavalry had met with in crossing the river, had attempted
to make their infantry cross lower down the river, in order to
attack the flanks of Castruccio’s army. But here, also, the banks
were steep and already lined by the men of Castruccio, and this
movement was quite useless. Thus the Florentines were so completely
defeated at all points that scarcely a third of them escaped,
and Castruccio was again covered with glory. Many captains were
taken prisoners, and Carlo, the son of King Ruberto, with Michelagnolo
Falconi and Taddeo degli Albizzi, the Florentine commissioners,
fled to Empoli. If the spoils were great, the slaughter was infinitely
greater, as might be expected in such a battle. Of the Florentines
there fell twenty thousand two hundred and thirty-one men, whilst
Castruccio lost one thousand five hundred and seventy men.</p>

<p>But Fortune growing envious of the glory of Castruccio took away
his life just at the time when she should have preserved it, and
thus ruined all those plans which for so long a time he had worked
to carry into effect, and in the successful prosecution of which
nothing but death could have stopped him. Castruccio was in the
thick of the battle the whole of the day; and when the end of
it came, although fatigued and overheated, he stood at the gate
of Fucecchio to welcome his men on their return from victory and
personally thank them. He was also on the watch for any attempt
of the enemy to retrieve the fortunes of the day; he being of
the opinion that it was the duty of a good general to be the first
man in the saddle and the last out of it. Here Castruccio stood
exposed to a wind which often rises at midday on the banks of
the Arno, and which is often very unhealthy; from this he took
a chill, of which he thought nothing, as he was accustomed to
such troubles; but it was the cause of his death. On the following
night he was attacked with high fever, which increased so rapidly
that the doctors saw it must prove fatal. Castruccio, therefore,
called Pagolo Guinigi to him, and addressed him as follows:</p>

<p>"If I could have believed that Fortune would have cut me off
in the midst of the career which was leading to that glory which
all my successes promised, I should have laboured less, and I
should have left thee, if a smaller state, at least with fewer
enemies and perils, because I should have been content with the
governorships of Lucca and Pisa. I should neither have subjugated
the Pistoians, nor outraged the Florentines with so many injuries.
But I would have made both these peoples my friends, and I should
have lived, if no longer, at least more peacefully, and have left
you a state without a doubt smaller, but one more secure and established
on a surer foundation. But Fortune, who insists upon having the
arbitrament of human affairs, did not endow me with sufficient
judgment to recognize this from the first, nor the time to surmount
it. Thou hast heard, for many have told thee, and I have never
concealed it, how I entered the house of thy father whilst yet
a boy—a stranger to all those ambitions which every generous soul
should feel—and how I was brought up by him, and loved as though
I had been born of his blood; how under his governance I learned
to be valiant and capable of availing myself of all that fortune,
of which thou hast been witness. When thy good father came to
die, he committed thee and all his possessions to my care, and
I have brought thee up with that love, and increased thy estate
with that care, which I was bound to show. And in order that thou
shouldst not only possess the estate which thy father left, but
also that which my fortune and abilities have gained, I have never
married, so that the love of children should never deflect my
mind from that gratitude which I owed to the children of thy father.
Thus I leave thee a vast estate, of which I am well content, but
I am deeply concerned, inasmuch as I leave it thee unsettled and
insecure. Thou hast the city of Lucca on thy hands, which will
never rest contented under thy government. Thou hast also Pisa,
where the men are of nature changeable and unreliable, who, although
they may be sometimes held in subjection, yet they will ever disdain
to serve under a Lucchese. Pistoia is also disloyal to thee, she
being eaten up with factions and deeply incensed against thy family
by reason of the wrongs recently inflicted upon them. Thou hast
for neighbours the offended Florentines, injured by us in a thousand
ways, but not utterly destroyed, who will hail the news of my
death with more delight than they would the acquisition of all
Tuscany. In the Emperor and in the princes of Milan thou canst
place no reliance, for they are far distant, slow, and their help
is very long in coming. Therefore, thou hast no hope in anything
but in thine own abilities, and in the memory of my valour, and
in the prestige which this latest victory has brought thee; which,
as thou knowest how to use it with prudence, will assist thee
to come to terms with the Florentines, who, as they are suffering
under this great defeat, should be inclined to listen to thee.
And whereas I have sought to make them my enemies, because I believed
that war with them would conduce to my power and glory, thou hast
every inducement to make friends of them, because their alliance
will bring thee advantages and security. It is of the greatest
important in this world that a man should know himself, and the
measure of his own strength and means; and he who knows that he
has not a genius for fighting must learn how to govern by the
arts of peace. And it will be well for thee to rule thy conduct
by my counsel, and to learn in this way to enjoy what my life-work
and dangers have gained; and in this thou wilt easily succeed
when thou hast learnt to believe that what I have told thee is
true. And thou wilt be doubly indebted to me, in that I have left
thee this realm and have taught thee how to keep it."</p>

<p>After this there came to Castruccio those citizens of Pisa, Pistoia,
and Lucca, who had been fighting at his side, and whilst recommending
Pagolo to them, and making them swear obedience to him as his
successor, he died. He left a happy memory to those who had known
him, and no prince of those times was ever loved with such devotion
as he was. His obsequies were celebrated with every sign of mourning,
and he was buried in San Francesco at Lucca. Fortune was not so
friendly to Pagolo Guinigi as she had been to Castruccio, for
he had not the abilities. Not long after the death of Castruccio,
Pagolo lost Pisa, and then Pistoia, and only with difficulty held
on to Lucca. This latter city continued in the family of Guinigi
until the time of the great-grandson of Pagolo.</p>

<p>From what has been related here it will be seen that Castruccio
was a man of exceptional abilities, not only measured by men of
his own time, but also by those of an earlier date. In stature
he was above the ordinary height, and perfectly proportioned.
He was of a gracious presence, and he welcomed men with such urbanity
that those who spoke with him rarely left him displeased. His
hair was inclined to be red, and he wore it cut short above the
ears, and, whether it rained or snowed, he always went without
a hat. He was delightful among friends, but terrible to his enemies;
just to his subjects; ready to play false with the unfaithful,
and willing to overcome by fraud those whom he desired to subdue,
because he was wont to say that it was the victory that brought
the glory, not the methods of achieving it. No one was bolder
in facing danger, none more prudent in extricating himself. He
was accustomed to say that men ought to attempt everything and
fear nothing; that God is a lover of strong men, because one always
sees that the weak are chastised by the strong. He was also wonderfully
sharp or biting though courteous in his answers; and as he did
not look for any indulgence in this way of speaking from others,
so he was not angered with others did not show it to him. It has
often happened that he has listened quietly when others have spoken
sharply to him, as on the following occasions. He had caused a
ducat to be given for a partridge, and was taken to task for doing
so by a friend, to whom Castruccio had said: "You would not have
given more than a penny." "That is true," answered the friend.
Then said Castruccio to him: "A ducat is much less to me." Having
about him a flatterer on whom he had spat to show that he scorned
him, the flatterer said to him: "Fisherman are willing to let
the waters of the sea saturate them in order that they may take
a few little fishes, and I allow myself to be wetted by spittle
that I may catch a whale"; and this was not only heard by Castruccio
with patience but rewarded. When told by a priest that it was
wicked for him to live so sumptuously, Castruccio said: "If that
be a vice then you should not fare so splendidly at the feasts
of our saints." Passing through a street he saw a young man as
he came out of a house of ill fame blush at being seen by Castruccio,
and said to him: "Thou shouldst not be ashamed when thou comest
out, but when thou goest into such places." A friend gave him
a very curiously tied knot to undo and was told: "Fool, do you
think that I wish to untie a thing which gave so much trouble
to fasten." Castruccio said to one who professed to be a philosopher:
"You are like the dogs who always run after those who will give
them the best to eat," and was answered: "We are rather like the
doctors who go to the houses of those who have the greatest need
of them." Going by water from Pisa to Leghorn, Castruccio was
much disturbed by a dangerous storm that sprang up, and was reproached
for cowardice by one of those with him, who said that he did not
fear anything. Castruccio answered that he did not wonder at that,
since every man valued his soul for what is was worth. Being asked
by one what he ought to do to gain estimation, he said: "When
thou goest to a banquet take care that thou dost not seat one
piece of wood upon another." To a person who was boasting that
he had read many things, Castruccio said: "He knows better than
to boast of remembering many things." Someone bragged that he
could drink much without becoming intoxicated. Castruccio replied:
"An ox does the same." Castruccio was acquainted with a girl with
whom he had intimate relations, and being blamed by a friend who
told him that it was undignified for him to be taken in by a woman,
he said: "She has not taken me in, I have taken her." Being also
blamed for eating very dainty foods, he answered: "Thou dost not
spend as much as I do?" and being told that it was true, he continued:
"Then thou art more avaricious than I am gluttonous." Being invited
by Taddeo Bernardi, a very rich and splendid citizen of Luca,
to supper, he went to the house and was shown by Taddeo into a
chamber hung with silk and paved with fine stones representing
flowers and foliage of the most beautiful colouring. Castruccio
gathered some saliva in his mouth and spat it out upon Taddeo,
and seeing him much disturbed by this, said to him: "I knew not
where to spit in order to offend thee less." Being asked how Caesar
died he said: "God willing I will die as he did." Being one night
in the house of one of his gentlemen where many ladies were assembled,
he was reproved by one of his friends for dancing and amusing
himself with them more than was usual in one of his station, so
he said: "He who is considered wise by day will not be considered
a fool at night." A person came to demand a favour of Castruccio,
and thinking he was not listening to his plea threw himself on
his knees to the ground, and being sharply reproved by Castruccio,
said: "Thou art the reason of my acting thus for thou hast thy
ears in thy feet," whereupon he obtained double the favour he
had asked. Castruccio used to say that the way to hell was an
easy one, seeing that it was in a downward direction and you travelled
blindfolded. Being asked a favour by one who used many superfluous
words, he said to him: "When you have another request to make,
send someone else to make it." Having been wearied by a similar
man with a long oration who wound up by saying: "Perhaps I have
fatigued you by speaking so long," Castruccio said: "You have
not, because I have not listened to a word you said." He used
to say of one who had been a beautiful child and who afterwards
became a fine man, that he was dangerous, because he first took
the husbands from the wives and now he took the wives from their
husbands. To an envious man who laughed, he said: "Do you laugh
because you are successful or because another is unfortunate?"
Whilst he was still in the charge of Messer Francesco Guinigi,
one of his companions said to him: "What shall I give you if you
will let me give you a blow on the nose?" Castruccio answered:
"A helmet." Having put to death a citizen of Lucca who had been
instrumental in raising him to power, and being told that he had
done wrong to kill one of his old friends, he answered that people
deceived themselves; he had only killed a new enemy. Castruccio
praised greatly those men who intended to take a wife and then
did not do so, saying that they were like men who said they would
go to sea, and then refused when the time came. He said that it
always struck him with surprise that whilst men in buying an earthen
or glass vase would sound it first to learn if it were good, yet
in choosing a wife they were content with only looking at her.
He was once asked in what manner he would wish to be buried when
he died, and answered: "With the face turned downwards, for I
know when I am gone this country will be turned upside down."
On being asked if it had ever occurred to him to become a friar
in order to save his soul, he answered that it had not, because
it appeared strange to him that Fra Lazerone should go to Paradise
and Uguccione della Faggiuola to the Inferno. He was once asked
when should a man eat to preserve his health, and replied: "If
the man be rich let him eat when he is hungry; if he be poor,
then when he can." Seeing one of his gentlemen make a member of
his family lace him up, he said to him: "I pray God that you will
let him feed you also." Seeing that someone had written upon his
house in Latin the words: "May God preserve this house from the
wicked," he said, "The owner must never go in." Passing through
one of the streets he saw a small house with a very large door,
and remarked: "That house will fly through the door." He was having
a discussion with the ambassador of the King of Naples concerning
the property of some banished nobles, when a dispute arose between
them, and the ambassador asked him if he had no fear of the king.
"Is this king of yours a bad man or a good one?" asked Castruccio,
and was told that he was a good one, whereupon he said, "Why should
you suggest that I should be afraid of a good man?"</p>

<p>I could recount many other stories of his sayings both witty
and weighty, but I think that the above will be sufficient testimony
to his high qualities. He lived forty-four years, and was in every
way a prince. And as he was surrounded by many evidences of his
good fortune, so he also desired to have near him some memorials
of his bad fortune; therefore the manacles with which he was chained
in prison are to be seen to this day fixed up in the tower of
his residence, where they were placed by him to testify forever
to his days of adversity. As in his life he was inferior neither
to Philip of Macedon, the father of Alexander, nor to Scipio of
Rome, so he died in the same year of his age as they did, and
he would doubtless have excelled both of them had Fortune decreed
that he should be born, not in Lucca, but in Macedonia or Rome.</p>
