<p>As Lightfoot the Deer and the big stranger from the Great Mountain
fought in the little opening near the pond of Paddy the Beaver,
neither knew or cared who saw them. Each was filled fully with
rage and determined to drive the other from the Green Forest.
Each was fighting for the right to win the love of Miss Daintyfoot.</p>

<p>Neither of them knew that Miss Daintyfoot herself was watching
them. But she was. She had heard the clash of their great antlers
as they had come together the first time, and she had known exactly
what it meant. Timidly she had stolen forward to a thicket where,
safely hidden, she could watch that terrible fight. She knew that
they were fighting for her. Of course. She knew it just as she
had known how both had been hunting for her. What she didn't know
for some time was which one she wanted to win that fight.</p>

<p>Both Lightfoot and the big stranger were handsome. Yes, indeed,
they were very handsome. Lightfoot was just a little bit the bigger
and it seemed to her just a little bit the handsomer. She almost
wanted him to win. Then, when she saw how bravely the big stranger
was fighting and how well he was holding his own, even though
he was a little smaller than Lightfoot, she almost hoped he would
win.</p>

<p>That great fight lasted a long time. To pretty Miss Daintyfoot
it seemed that it never would end. But after a while Lightfoot's
greater size and strength began to tell. Little by little the
big stranger was forced back towards the edge of the open place.
Now he would be thrown to his knees when Lightfoot wasn't. As
Lightfoot saw this, he seemed to gain new strength. At last he
caught the stranger in such a way that he threw him over. While
the stranger struggled to get to his feet again, Lightfoot's sharp
antlers made long tears in his gray coat. The stranger was beaten
and he knew it. The instant he succeeded in getting to his feet
he turned tail and plunged for the shelter of the Green Forest.
With a snort of triumph, Lightfoot plunged after him.</p>

<p>But now that he was beaten, fear took possession of the stranger.
All desire to fight left him. His one thought was to get away,
and fear gave him speed. Straight back towards the Great Mountain
from which he had come the stranger headed. Lightfoot followed
only a short distance. He knew that that stranger was going for
good and would not come back. Then Lightfoot turned back to the
open place where they had fought. There he threw up his beautiful
head, crowned by its great antlers, and whistled a challenge to
all the Green Forest. As she looked at him, Miss Daintyfoot knew
that she had wanted him to win. She knew that there simply couldn't
be anybody else so handsome and strong and brave in all the Great
World.</p>
