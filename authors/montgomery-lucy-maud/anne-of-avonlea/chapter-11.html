"Teaching is really very interesting work," wrote Anne to a Queen's
Academy chum.  "Jane says she thinks it is monotonous but I don't
find it so.  Something funny is almost sure to happen every day,
and the children say such amusing things.  Jane says she punishes
her pupils when they make funny speeches, which is probably why she
finds teaching monotonous.  This afternoon little Jimmy Andrews was
trying to spell `speckled' and couldn't manage it.  `Well,' he said
finally, `I can't spell it but I know what it means.'
<P>
"`What?' I asked.
<P>
"`St. Clair Donnell's face, miss.'
<P>
"St. Clair is certainly very much freckled, although I try to
prevent the others from commenting on it. . .for I was freckled
once and well do I remember it.  But I don't think St. Clair minds.
It was because Jimmy called him `St. Clair' that St. Clair pounded
him on the way home from school.  I heard of the pounding, but not
officially, so I don't think I'll take any notice of it.

"Yesterday I was trying to teach Lottie Wright to do addition.
I said, `If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other,
how many would you have altogether?' `A mouthful,' said Lottie. 
And in the nature study class, when I asked them to give me a good
reason why toads shouldn't be killed, Benjie Sloane gravely answered,
`Because it would rain the next day.'
<P>
"It's so hard not to laugh, Stella.  I have to save up all my amusement
until I get home, and Marilla says it makes her nervous to hear wild shrieks
of mirth proceeding from the east gable without any apparent cause.
She says a man in Grafton went insane once and that was how it began.
<P>
"Did you know that Thomas a Becket was canonized as a SNAKE?
Rose Bell says he was. . .also that William Tyndale WROTE the
New Testament.  Claude White says a `glacier' is a man who puts
in window frames!
<P>
"I think the most difficult thing in teaching, as well as the most
interesting, is to get the children to tell you their real thoughts
about things.  One stormy day last week I gathered them around me
at dinner hour and tried to get them to talk to me just as if I
were one of themselves.  I asked them to tell me the things
they most wanted.  Some of the answers were commonplace enough
. . . dolls, ponies, and skates.  Others were decidedly original. 
Hester Boulter wanted `to wear her Sunday dress every day and eat
in the sitting room.'  Hannah Bell wanted `to be good without having
to take any trouble about it.'  Marjory White, aged ten, wanted to
be a WIDOW.  Questioned why, she gravely said that if you weren't
married people called you an old maid, and if you were your husband
bossed you; but if you were a widow there'd be no danger of either. 
The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell's.  She wanted a 'honeymoon.'
I asked her if she knew what it was and she said she thought it was
an extra nice kind of bicycle because her cousin in Montreal went on
a honeymoon when he was married and he had always had the very latest
in bicycles!
<P>
"Another day I asked them all to tell me the naughtiest thing they
had ever done.  I couldn't get the older ones to do so, but the
third class answered quite freely.  Eliza Bell had `set fire to her
aunt's carded rolls.'  Asked if she meant to do it she said, `not
altogether.'  She just tried a little end to see how it would burn
and the whole bundle blazed up in a jiffy.  Emerson Gillis had
spent ten cents for candy when he should have put it in his
missionary box.  Annetta Bell's worst crime was `eating some
blueberries that grew in the graveyard.'  Willie White had `slid
down the sheephouse roof a lot of times with his Sunday trousers on.'
`But I was punished for it 'cause I had to wear patched pants
to Sunday School all summer, and when you're punished for a thing
you don't have to repent of it,' declared Willie.
<P>
"I wish you could see some of their compositions. . .so much do
I wish it that I'll send you copies of some written recently.
Last week I told the fourth class I wanted them to write me letters
about anything they pleased, adding by way of suggestion that they
might tell me of some place they had visited or some interesting
thing or person they had seen.  They were to write the letters on
real note paper, seal them in an envelope, and address them to me,
all without any assistance from other people.  Last Friday morning
I found a pile of letters on my desk and that evening I realized
afresh that teaching has its pleasures as well as its pains.  Those
compositions would atone for much.  Here is Ned Clay's, address,
spelling, and grammar as originally penned.

than most people ever knowed.  he lets it sleep on his rocking
chare and my aunt says he thinks more of it than he does of his

them new milk but we ought not be better to them than to our

"St. Clair Donnell's is, as usual, short and to the point.  St.
Clair never wastes words.  I do not think he chose his subject or
added the postscript out of malice aforethought.  It is just that
he has not a great deal of tact or imagination.
<P>
<P>
"`Dear Miss Shirley
<P>
You told us to describe something strange we have seen.  I will
describe the Avonlea Hall.  It has two doors, an inside one and an
outside one.  It has six windows and a chimney.  It has two ends
and two sides.  It is painted blue.  That is what makes it strange. 
It is built on the lower Carmody road.  It is the third most
important building in Avonlea.  The others are the church and the
blacksmith shop.  They hold debating clubs and lectures in it and
concerts.
<P>
                                    Yours truly,

P.S.  The hall is a very bright blue.'"

"Annetta Bell's letter was quite long, which surprised me, for
writing essays is not Annetta's forte, and hers are generally as
brief as st. Clair's.  Annetta is a quiet little puss and a model
of good behavior, but there isn't a shadow of orginality in her. 
Here is her letter.  --
<P>
<P>
"`Dearest teacher,
<P>
I think I will write you a letter to tell you how much I love you.
I love you with my whole heart and soul and mind. . .with all
there is of me to love. . .and I want to serve you for ever. 
It would be my highest privilege.  That is why I try so hard to be
good in school and learn my lessuns.
<P>
"`You are so beautiful, my teacher.  Your voice is like music and
your eyes are like pansies when the dew is on them.  You are like a
tall stately queen.  Your hair is like rippling gold.  Anthony Pye
says it is red, but you needn't pay any attention to Anthony.
<P>
"`I have only known you for a few months but I cannot realize that
there was ever a time when I did not know you. . .when you had not
come into my life to bless and hallow it.  I will always look back
to this year as the most wonderful in my life because it brought
you to me.  Besides, it's the year we moved to Avonlea from
Newbridge.  My love for you has made my life very rich and it has
kept me from much of harm and evil.  I owe this all to you, my
sweetest teacher.
<P>
"`I shall never forget how sweet you looked the last time I saw
you in that black dress with flowers in your hair.  I shall see you
like that for ever, even when we are both old and gray.  You will
always be young and fair to me, dearest teacher.  I am thinking of
you all the time. . .in the morning and at the noontide and at the
twilight.  I love you when you laugh and when you sigh. . .even
when you look disdainful.  I never saw you look cross though
Anthony Pye says you always look so but I don't wonder you look
cross at him for he deserves it.  I love you in every dress. . .you
seem more adorable in each new dress than the last.
<P>
"`Dearest teacher, good night.  The sun has set and the stars are
shining. . .stars that are as bright and beautiful as your eyes. 
I kiss your hands and face, my sweet.  May God watch over you and
protect you from all harm.

                                Your afecksionate pupil

<P>
<P>
"This extraordinary letter puzzled me not a little.  I knew Annetta
couldn't have composed it any more than she could fly.  When I went
to school the next day I took her for a walk down to the brook at
recess and asked her to tell me the truth about the letter. 
Annetta cried and 'fessed up freely.  She said she had never
written a letter and she didn't know how to, or what to say, but
there was bundle of love letters in her mother's top bureau drawer
which had been written to her by an old `beau.'
<P>
"`It wasn't father,' sobbed Annetta, `it was someone who was
studying for a minister, and so he could write lovely letters, but
ma didn't marry him after all.  She said she couldn't make out what
he was driving at half the time.  But I thought the letters were
sweet and that I'd just copy things out of them here and there to
write you.  I put "teacher" where he put "lady" and I put in
something of my own when I could think of it and I changed some words.
I put "dress" in place of "mood."  I didn't know just what a "mood"
was but I s'posed it was something to wear.  I didn't s'pose you'd
know the difference.  I don't see how you found out it wasn't
all mine.  You must be awful clever, teacher.'
<P>
"I told Annetta it was very wrong to copy another person's letter
and pass it off as her own.  But I'm afraid that all Annetta
repented of was being found out.
<P>
"`And I do love you, teacher,' she sobbed.  `It was all true, even
if the minister wrote it first.  I do love you with all my heart.'
<P>
"It's very difficult to scold anybody properly under such circumstances.

"Here is Barbara Shaw's letter.  I can't reproduce the blots of the original.
<P>
"`Dear teacher,
<P>
You said we might write about a visit.  I never visited but once.
It was at my Aunt Mary's last winter.  My Aunt Mary is a very particular
woman and a great housekeeper.  The first night I was there we were at tea.
I knocked over a jug and broke it.  Aunt Mary said she had had that jug
ever since she was married and nobody had ever broken it before.
When we got up I stepped on her dress and all the gathers tore out
of the skirt.  The next morning when I got up I hit the pitcher against
the basin and cracked them both and I upset a cup of tea on the tablecloth
at breakfast.  When I was helping Aunt Mary with the dinner dishes I
dropped a china plate and it smashed.  That evening I fell downstairs
and sprained my ankle and had to stay in bed for a week.  I heard Aunt Mary
tell Uncle Joseph it was a mercy or I'd have broken everything in the house.
When I got better it was time to go home.  I don't like visiting very much.
I like going to school better, especially since I came to Avonlea.
<P>
                                          Yours respectfully,
                                            Barbara.  Shaw.'"
<P>
"Willie White's began,
<P>
Respected Miss,
<P>
I want to tell you about my Very Brave Aunt.  She lives in Ontario
and one day she went out to the barn and saw a dog in the yard.
The dog had no business there so she got a stick and whacked
him hard and drove him into the barn and shut him up.  Pretty soon
a man came looking for an inaginary lion' (Query; -- Did Willie
mean a menagerie lion?)  `that had run away from a circus.  And it
turned out that the dog was a lion and my Very Brave Aunt had druv
him into the barn with a stick.  It was a wonder she was not et up
but she was very brave.  Emerson Gillis says if she thought it was
a dog she wasn't any braver than if it really was a dog.  But
Emerson is jealous because he hasn't got a Brave Aunt himself,
nothing but uncles.'"

"I have kept the best for the last.  You laugh at me because I
think Paul is a genius but I am sure his letter will convince you
that he is a very uncommon child.  Paul lives away down near the
shore with his grandmother and he has no playmates. . .no real
playmates.  You remember our School Management professor told us
that we must not have `favorites' among our pupils, but I can't
help loving Paul Irving the best of all mine.  I don't think it
does any harm, though, for everybody loves Paul, even Mrs. Lynde,
who says she could never have believed she'd get so fond of a Yankee.
The other boys in school like him too.  There is nothing weak or
girlish about him in spite of his dreams and fancies.  He is very
manly and can hold his own in all games.  He fought St. Clair
Donnell recently because St. Clair said the Union Jack was away
ahead of the Stars and Stripes as a flag.  The result was a drawn
battle and a mutual agreement to respect each other's patriotism
henceforth.  St. Clair says he can hit the HARDEST but Paul can
hit the OFTENEST.
<P>
<P>
"Paul's Letter.
<P>
My dear teacher,
<P>
You told us we might write you about some interesting people we knew.
I think the most interesting people I know are my rock people and I
mean to tell you about them.  I have never told anybody about them
except grandma and father but I would like to have you know about
them because you understand things.  There are a great many people
who do not understand things so there is no use in telling them.
<P>
My rock people live at the shore.  I used to visit them almost
every evening before the winter came.  Now I can't go till spring,
but they will be there, for people like that never change. . .that
is the splendid thing about them.  Nora was the first one of them I
got acquainted with and so I think I love her the best.  She lives
in Andrews' Cove and she has black hair and black eyes, and she
knows all about the mermaids and the water kelpies.  You ought to
hear the stories she can tell.  Then there are the Twin Sailors.
They don't live anywhere, they sail all the time, but they often
come ashore to talk to me.  They are a pair of jolly tars and they
have seen everything in the world. . .and more than what is in the
world.  Do you know what happened to the youngest Twin Sailor
once?  He was sailing and he sailed right into a moonglade.  A
moonglade is the track the full moon makes on the water when it is
rising from the sea, you know, teacher.  Well, the youngest Twin
Sailor sailed along the moonglade till he came right up to the
moon, and there was a little golden door in the moon and he opened
it and sailed right through.  He had some wonderful adventures in
the moon but it would make this letter too long to tell them.
<P>
Then there is the Golden Lady of the cave.  One day I found a big
cave down on the shore and I went away in and after a while I found
the Golden Lady.  She has golden hair right down to her feet and
her dress is all glittering and glistening like gold that is alive.
And she has a golden harp and plays on it all day long. . .you can
hear the music any time along shore if you listen carefully but
most people would think it was only the wind among the rocks.
I've never told Nora about the Golden Lady.  I was afraid it
might hurt her feelings.  It even hurt her feelings if I talked
too long with the Twin Sailors.
<P>
I always met the Twin Sailors at the Striped Rocks.  The youngest
Twin Sailor is very good-tempered but the oldest Twin Sailor can
look dreadfully fierce at times.  I have my suspicions about that
oldest Twin.  I believe he'd be a pirate if he dared.  There's really
something very mysterious about him.  He swore once and I told him
if he ever did it again he needn't come ashore to talk to me because
I'd promised grandmother I'd never associate with anybody that swore.
He was pretty well scared, I can tell you, and he said if I would
forgive him he would take me to the sunset.  So the next evening
when I was sitting on the Striped Rocks the oldest Twin came
sailing over the sea in an enchanted boat and I got in her.  The
boat was all pearly and rainbowy, like the inside of the mussel
shells, and her sail was like moonshine.  Well, we sailed right
across to the sunset.  Think of that, teacher, I've been in the
sunset.  And what do you suppose it is?  The sunset is a land
all flowers.  We sailed into a great garden, and the clouds are beds
of flowers.  We sailed into a great harbor, all the color of gold,
and I stepped right out of the boat on a big meadow all covered with
buttercups as big as roses.  I stayed there for ever so long.  It
seemed nearly a year but the Oldest Twin says it was only a few
minutes.  You see, in the sunset land the time is ever so much
longer than it is here.
<P>
                                     Your loving pupil
                                            Paul Irving.
<P>
P.  S.  of course, this letter isn't really true, teacher.
                                                    P.I.'"
