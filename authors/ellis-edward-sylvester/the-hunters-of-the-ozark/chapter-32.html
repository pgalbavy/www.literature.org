<p>"Do obsarve where the trail comes down to that big bowl?" asked
Terry, pointing to the huge, circular cavity below them.</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Well, that's a mistake; <em>that isn't the right trail</em>."</p>

<p>Fred turned about, and jumped and ran back to the Devil's Punch
Bowl, at a rate that threatened his neck. Stooping over, he carefully
examined the path. He saw that his companion was right; the trail
which they had followed to the edge of the stream was one that
had been worn by animals in coming to and going from the Punch
Bowl. You will admit that no better punch in the wide world could
be furnished the dumb beasts than that which was thus freely given
to them.</p>

<p>As if to confirm that which did not need confirming, a large
buck at that moment appeared in the path, within a hundred feet
of where Fred had straightened up, after examining the trail.
He threw up his head on catching sight of the young hunter, gave
one quick, inquiring stare and then whirled about and was off
like a flash.</p>

<p>Fred Linden could have brought him down at the moment he wheeled
had he chosen to do so, but he recalled his own proposition to
Terry some time before, about firing such a shot. Indeed, since
they had some of the cooked buffalo steak left, there was no call
to use any more ammunition for game.</p>

<p>Terry Clark came laughing down the rocks, looking upon the whole
business as one of the funniest of incidents, but to Fred it was
any thing but a laughing matter. Time was becoming of the utmost
value, and this divergence from the trail meant delay&mdash;a delay,
too, whose length could not be guessed. If they had turned aside
several miles back, it was more than likely that they would lose
all the advantage gained by the laborious travel of the night
before.</p>

<p>"How could we have made such a blunder?" asked Fred, his eyes
wandering back over the path, as though searching for an explanation
of the mistake; "I suppose at the point where the trails cross
the direction isn't changed much and this is more distinct than
the other. Terry, I can't see any thing about this to laugh at."</p>

<p>"I don't obsarve much of the same mesilf," said the other, whose
face nevertheless was on abroad grin; "I wasn't laughing at yersilf,
or the mistake we made."</p>

<p>"What was it then that amused you so much?"</p>

<p>"I was thinkin' how funny it looked to see the deer and bears
and buffaloes and foxes and panthers all standing round that big
bowl and winkin' at each ither while they drank their health."</p>

<p>"Terry, there's going to be trouble because of this blunder."</p>

<p>"What do ye signify be the same?"</p>

<p>"I believe that all the advantage we gained by traveling so hard
last night is lost. When we follow this trail back until it reaches
the main one, more than likely we shall meet the Winnebagos at
that point, if they will not actually be between us and the camp
in the Ozarks."</p>

<p>"I'm afeard it's not all a falsehood that ye are telling me,"
said Terry, with an expression in which there was nothing like
a jest.</p>

<p>"Let's be off then."</p>

<p>At this juncture the Irish lad made a proposition which his companion
accepted, for he thought it promised them much saving in time
and travel.</p>

<p>It was quite certain that the false trail followed pretty much
the same direction as the true one: at any rate there could be
no doubt that it crossed the stream which had stopped them, so
instead of picking their way back for several miles, they decided
to keep along the edge of the water itself until they struck the
path.</p>

<p>To make sure of avoiding another blunder, one should have gone
up and the other down stream, for manifestly they could not be
certain they were above or below the true path; but each felt
too strong a misgiving about such a course. Their surroundings
required mutual support.</p>

<p>Beside this, they were convinced that the trail which they wished
to recover lay above instead of below, so that, when making their
way they were not held back by any doubt, though each could not
fail to see that it was only a piece of guess-work.</p>

<p>Fortunately for their peace of mind, they were right, and the
plan saved them much time and travel. They had not gone very far,
when they came upon the path, marked so distinctly that there
could be no possible mistake.</p>

<p>The width of the stream was about the same as below. The water
was smooth, deep, clear and sluggish. The bank sloped gently down
from each side and on the other shore were plainly seen the prints
of the hoofs where the animals had left the water. It was so deep
that whoever went over there had done so by floating or swimming.</p>

<p>The crossing was so far above the point where the cascades began,
that nothing was to be feared from them. The clumsiest raft could
be ferried over by a child before it would drift into danger,
while in case of swimming, the peril was still less.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't so chilly," said Fred, "I would propose that we
swim the stream."</p>

<p>Terry shivered and shook his head.</p>

<p>"We must go over on a raft; it is not only cowld, but is gittin'
cowlder."</p>

<p>"There's a storm brewing; it looks as black as ink off yonder."</p>

<p>At this moment the boys made a discovery which both pleased and
alarmed them. Such a float as they needed was at their call. There
lay a half dozen logs and trees fastened together by several withes,
and with enough buoyancy to bear them to the other side. Even
the pole to be used in propulsion lay upon the heavy timbers that
were pulled just far enough against the bank to prevent them floating
off with the current.</p>

<p>While it was pleasant to know that they would not have to go
through the labor of constructing any thing of the kind, yet there
was a cause for fear in the presence of the structure which led
them to hesitate several minutes before using it.</p>

<p>It proved that some one had crossed from the other side upon
it, while the withes were so white and fresh at the angles, where
they were twisted open, as to show that the raft had been made
but a short time.</p>

<p>The natural question was as to who could have been coming from
the other way.</p>

<p>"I know," said Terry, compressing his lips and shaking his head.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Winnebagos; they're so plintiful that it couldn't have been
any one ilse, for they wouldn't have had a chance."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," remarked Fred thoughtfully, "for they
do seem to be almost everywhere, though I can't understand why
they should be coming this way."</p>

<p>"Suppose there was but one of the spalpeens, and he'd been out
on a scout, and was on his way back to the rist of the spalpeens
with the news, would it be onraisonable to think he would take
a little pains to kaap his leggins and moccasins from gittin'
damp enough to give him cowld?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can think of no better reason than that, and am willing
to believe it is correct, but don't you see, Terry, that all this
goes to prove that we have lost a dangerous amount of time? We
ought to have been many miles further on the road than we are."</p>

<p>"The buffalo bull had a good deal to do with our impolite tarryin',
and as he is slaapin' with his four mithers, I maan his forefathers,
let him rist in pace."</p>

<p>The boys did not allow their words to delay their hands. The
raft was shoved clear, and the two took their positions upon it,
Fred holding the pole, while his companion looked after the guns.
They were astonished to find, directly after leaving land, that
the pole, which was nearly twenty feet in length, would not reach
bottom.</p>

<p>This compelled them to use it as a paddle. The progress was slow,
but the distance was so slight that it did not take them long
to reach the other bank, where they set the structure adrift,
so that it could not be used by any one else.</p>

<p>Looking directly up stream, where the sky was in plain sight,
its blackness startled even the boys, who were used to seeing
the most violent changes of temperature. The hue was not of the
dark blue which often gives warning of the coming tempest, but
there was a greenish tinge to the blackness that would have awed
any one.</p>

<p>While they looked, a zigzag ribbon of flame fluttered across
the darkened portion, accompanied by a crash that seemed to shiver
the earth. Fred Linden, who happened to be staring straight at
the fiery burst, saw the upper part of a large cypress that leaned
over the water, leap from the trunk as though it had been sawn
short off and flung into the water.</p>

<p>It was all ablaze, and, falling upright into the current, kept
its equilibrium, that is, it did not fall to any side, but swept
slowly downward as upright as when on the tree, and suggested
that some giant as big as the Statue of Liberty was walking beneath,
with an enormous torch held above his head to light his path.</p>

<p>"Did ye iver see the like?" asked Terry.</p>

<p>"No; it is wonderful."</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Did ye iver see the like?" asked Terry.]</p>

<p>Although it was about mid-day, the heavens were so overcast that
the gloom was like night itself. At the same time the darkness
had a ghastly tinge which made the faces of the boys, when they
looked at each other, livid and unearthly.</p>

<p>The scene was so impressive that they stood motionless, watching
the flaming tree and the inky heavens beyond. Suddenly in the
sky they saw a figure that resembled a vast balloon slightly inclined
to one side, and spinning on its axis with inconceivable swiftness.</p>

<p>At the bottom the snout-like appendage wavered off to one side
as though the amazing velocity of the upper part was twisting
it loose. A similar formation appeared a few minutes after a short
distance behind.</p>

<p>And now began the most extraordinary exhibition of all. Imagine
two whirling balloons, a hundred feet in height, and so black
that they stood out from the surrounding gloom, showing like pitch
against the dimly lit sky behind. They began a witches' waltz
in the firmament, sometimes leaning far backward, then dancing
forward, as if saluting each other, then "balancing," then dancing
up and down, then so far away from each other that one would pass
out of the field of vision, soon to reappear, however. At times
they seemed as if about to rush into each other's arms, and then
they coquetted away again and resumed the weird dance in the skies.</p>

<p>You understand that I am trying to describe one of those terrible
visitations of the west known as a cyclone. Little was heard of
them a century ago, and the balloon to which I have compared the
form of the ghostly dancers, was unknown to the lads, who watched
the exhibition with an interest that was not turned into terror,
as it would have been to-day, by the knowledge of the awful power
for death and destruction that lies within that concentration
of electricity in its most fateful form.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time that this strange scene lasted, though
it could not have been many seconds. Suddenly, while the balloon-like
forms were saluting each other, they rushed together. There was
no shock perceivable when they met, but there were vivid flashes
from within the murky folds, as the heat lightning sometimes plays
among the clouds at the close of a warm day.</p>

<p>Having met, the forms engaged in a wrestling bout. Round and
round they spun with the same bewildering swiftness, leaning far
to one side, as though about to fall, and all the time whirling
with such speed on the one spiral leg that it seemed unable to
keep pace with the bulkier part above.</p>
