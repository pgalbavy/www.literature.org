<p>"It is over thirty years ago," said Uncle Elk that evening to
the listening Boy Scouts who were gathered in the bungalow, "that
the whole country was thrown into excitement by accounts of a
stupendous sea serpent which was repeatedly seen off the Isle
of Shoals. You know that returning mariners have brought home
stories of encounters in distant seas with similar monstrous reptiles.
The reputation of many of these men for truthfulness, and the
fact that more than one of them insisted that their eyes had not
deceived them, led a good many to believe what they told. Nor
am I prepared to say that some of the accounts were not founded
on fact. In the remote past the land and sea were inhabited by
creatures of such vast size that our largest quadrupeds are pygmies
in comparison. While the land giants became extinct ages ago,
it is not unreasonable to think that the oceans which cover three-fourths
of the earth’s surface still hold inhabitants of tremendous growth.</p>

<p>"But leaving all this discussion for the present, I am now about
to tell you the true story of one of the greatest fakes that ever
astounded thousands of persons and amused the dozen or so who
were in the secret. In the summer of 1879—perhaps a year earlier
or later—people everywhere became interested in the reports that
an enormous sea serpent had been seen off the Isle of Shoals.
These stories were repeated so often and so circumstantially that
it was evident there was something in them. General attention
was drawn to that famous resort, and hundreds of guests visited
the Appledore Hotel for the first time and remained for weeks.
The serpent was said to be fifty or seventy feet long, its tapering
neck, tail and general conformation were so natural in appearance
that there could be no doubt of its reality. It was black in color
and moved through the water just as a creature of its kind might
be supposed to do. The newspapers sent their reporters thither
and some of them saw it. You may be sure that they did justice
to the theme. No one dared approach the monster near enough to
make a photograph, for none had the temerity to run the risk of
rousing the ire of the monster. Excursion steamers from Boston
were crowded with thousands eager to get a glimpse of the terrifying
creature without incurring any peril, for whoever heard of a sea
serpent attacking a ship? It may crush a small boat in its prodigious
jaws, as the hippopotamus of the upper Nile has been known to
do,—but a steamer is beyond its capacity. Many of the passengers
carried revolvers, and a number had rifles. They begged the captain
to take them close enough to give a chance for bagging such royal
game, and he was more than willing to oblige, but somehow or other
the opportunity did not offer. It was said that so many craft
cruising about his haunts scared him off, and he did not show
himself for days. Then, when the search grew less ardent, he would
reappear and the excitement would be greater than ever.</p>

<p>"Picture the piazza of the hotel, the upper windows, and even
the roof swarming with people, nearly all with small or large
glasses pointed out over the water, searching and waiting minute
after minute for a sight of the terrific creature. Maybe after
the scrutiny had lasted for hours some one would shout:</p>

<p>"‘<em>I see him! Yonder he is!</em>’</p>

<p>"And every glass would be focussed upon the point a half mile
or more away, and wild exclamations would follow. The serpent
was in plain sight of every eye. The fore part was upreared three
or four feet, and the most powerful binoculars revealed the enormous
eyes and vast mouth, while at varying distances to the rear could
be seen bulging curvings of the stupendous body, as thick as a
cask. Its hideous head slowly circled about on the neck as if
the creature enjoyed the sensation he created. Then he dropped
lower in the water, and seemed to be reposing, occasionally disporting
himself lazily, but often displaying his terrifying convolutions.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile the news had been telegraphed far and near, and thousands
of eager people hurried to the Isle of Shoals for a sight which
they would remember all their lives. If they arrived before darkness
set in they probably were gratified, for the serpent appeared
to be fond of showing itself by daylight, but it invariably vanished
before morning and probably would not be seen again for a week,
when the former scenes would be repeated.</p>

<p>"Scores took up quarters at the hotel, which they had never visited
before, and stayed until the close of the season. Most of these
were rewarded by a glimpse or two of the serpent, though a few
were disappointed and in their resentment declared there was no
such thing.</p>

<p>"Not the papers alone, but many of the magazines contained disquisitions
on the bogy of the sea. Startling pictures based on the numerous
descriptions were given, and caused many a shudder among those
who had to depend upon such sources of information.</p>

<p>"One day a dudish youth loudly announced that any man was a fool
who was afraid of a sea serpent. He intended to row out in a boat
and to go nigh enough to empty his revolver into the frightful
head. Incidentally he let it fall that he had a record as a pistol
expert, and he invited any one who had the ‘sand’ to go with him
for a near view of his fight with the creature that was making
a deuced bore of itself.</p>

<p>"To the breathless amazement of the awe-smitten listeners, two
young women, pretty of feature and with mischievous eyes, volunteered.
He warned them of the risk they ran, but they replied that they
were not afraid of anything that failed to alarm him, and any
way they didn’t believe the horrid creature would get a chance
to harm them before their escort would pierce its brain with several
bullets. This tribute to the young man’s skill and bravery caused
him to set his hat at a greater angle and thrust out his chest
still more. Many of the spectators thought it their duty to protest,
but the girls would not be dissuaded, and a few minutes later
the boat put off with its three occupants, while every glass or
unaided eye followed the movements of the craft.</p>

<p>"This was one of the times when the serpent was in plain sight
a half mile away, and the young hero headed directly toward it.
The girls laughed and chatted and were sure it was the greatest
lark in which they had ever engaged.</p>

<p>"They noticed that as they drew near the creature their escort
showed lees enthusiasm and kept looking over his shoulder. It
is not to be supposed they were free from a few tremors themselves,
but, if so, they did not allow him to see it. They kept up their
laughter and commented freely upon the timidity of the thousands
who remained upon the hotel porch and watched the sea serpent
from afar.</p>

<p>"More slowly the oars swayed until probably a couple of hundred
yards separated the boat from that awful undulating monster. The
young man ceased toiling and laid his hand upon the revolver in
his hip pocket.</p>

<p>"‘You are not near enough to reach him,’ said one of the misses.</p>

<p>"‘I am best on long shots,’ he replied with another glance at
that fearful head.</p>

<p>"‘Why, he has seen us! He is looking this way!’ exclaimed the
other.</p>

<p>"‘Are you sure of that?’ he asked with chattering teeth.</p>

<p>"‘Yes; he’s coming toward us! Isn’t that splendid? All you will
have to do is to wait until he is near enough and then shoot the
horrid thing through the head as you said you would.’</p>

<p>"But the young man had heard enough. He whirled the boat around
and rowed with might and main, never pausing until he reached
the wharf, when he sprang out, and amid the laughter and jeers
of the spectators rushed to his room, which he kept until the
time came for him to leave the hotel.</p>

<p>"The sea serpent was seen at intervals all through the summer.
It did not make itself too cheap, and a week or more would pass
without its showing itself. It was observed late in the season,
but finally disappeared for good. The Appledore House was crowded
as never before, and ran to its fullest capacity for the two following
summers because of the general expectation that the sea serpent
would show up again, but it never did, and in due time became
only a memory or was forgotten entirely.</p>

<p>"When you land at the dock at Boothbay Harbor and come up the
slope to Commercial Street, turn to the left, walk only a little
way and you will come to the large grocery store of Simpson and
Perkins. In the upper hall of that store, as it used to be, the
sea serpent of which I have been telling you was born and attained
its full growth, preliminary to its removal to the Isle of Shoals.</p>

<p>"The author of its being was William Wilson, who died about ten
years ago. He was an English sailor, who in middle life gave up
the sea and settled in Boothbay Harbor, where for years he was
the only rigger in the little town. He possessed great natural
mechanical ability, and it was said of him that he could make
anything. He was unusually skilful in plain and fancy sewing and
in constructing all sorts of knickknacks. He turned his attention
to house painting and in that developed real artistic taste. In
short, he was a Jack-of-all-trades and good in each.</p>

<p>"One day a stranger who had heard of Wilson’s versatility came
to him with a proposition that he should construct him a sea serpent,
for which he was willing to pay two hundred dollars. He explained
its purpose and impressed upon the artist the necessity of keeping
the thing an absolute secret,—since the discovery that it was
a fake would defeat the very object of its being, which was to
build up business for the hotel at the Isle of Shoals.</p>

<p>"Wilson agreed to construct the sea serpent in accordance with
his own ideas of what it should be. His employer was quite willing
to accept this proviso, for he knew the man’s ingenuity and so
the verbal contract was made.</p>

<p>"Wilson had a partner in the work, a Swede named Robert Alson,
who is still living. These two used to saunter upstairs into the
long hall which was their workshop, lock the door and devote themselves
to the task, upon which they spent their spare hours throughout
the winter. Like a true artist, Wilson would not hurry, and gave
careful attention to the smaller details,—a fact which accounts
for the perfect success of the extraordinary fraud.</p>

<p>"The sea serpent was exactly thirty-five feet long, and for convenience
of shipment was made in three sections, which overlapped and could
be readily sewn together. The material was strong canvas, painted
a black color, with proper proportions. The tail tapered, as did
the neck, the largest part of the body being about two feet in
diameter. The head, eyes and mouth were not exaggerated, as would
have been the fact with almost any amateur at the job. It was
stuffed with cork and oak shavings, so nicely adjusted that it
would float partly on or just below the surface, with the curving
neck lifting the hideous head two or three feet above the water.
The small waves gave a lifelike motion to the thing, which made
it seem to be moving slowly through the water, when in fact it
never progressed forward or backward, for its position was held
immovably by an anchor.</p>

<p>"When the serpent was at last completed it was securely boxed
and shipped to Portsmouth, six miles from the Isle of Shoals.
Then it was towed at night to the right place, anchored and left
to do its duty, which, as I have told you, it succeeded in doing
to perfection. It is strange that the imposture was kept up for
month after-month, and that it was seen and inspected by thousands,
and yet no one really penetrated the clever deception. It was
towed to the anchorage at night, and taken away again the next
night to a secure hiding place. Those who had it in charge were
too shrewd to overdo the trick. When the attention of the crowds
threatened to become too warm, the serpent disappeared and was
not again seen for a week or more. The general belief was that
it had gone out to sea, but after a time some strange attraction
drew it back into the field of vision of the swarms of visitors
to the Appledore Hotel. As I said, the sea serpent disappeared
for good in the autumn and this particular one was never seen
again—that is, in its native element. I do not know what ultimately
became of it."</p>

<p>At this point in the narrative Uncle Elk paused, and it could
be seen that he was smiling behind his beard.</p>

<p>"I now want to say something to you in confidence. You must be
sure not to repeat it in the hearing of others. I gave you the
names of the two men who built the sea serpent, but I have good
reason to believe a third person had a hand in it. If you will
question Keyes H. Richards, the proprietor of the Samoset House
on Mouse Island, you will find that he knows all about it. I once
asked him point blank if he did not have something to do with
its construction, but I could not draw a direct answer from him.
Therefore, I retain my suspicions.</p>

<p>"Last spring the twin brothers, Asa and Bige Carter of Boothbay,
persuaded themselves that they could make a tidy sum of money
by introducing a new sea serpent to the public. After they had
completed it, they decided to make a preliminary test by bringing
it to Gosling Lake and trying it on you Boy Scouts. They let me
into the secret, and though much interested, I discouraged it.
They lacked the artistic cleverness of Wilson and the trick was
sure to be detected and quickly exposed. I met them on the shore
of the lake and saw them tow it out a little way, and anchor it.
It was not properly balanced, and while the body sank, the head
rose to within a foot of the surface, but would not come any higher.
When those two tramps happened to look over the edge of their
canoe, you may perhaps imagine their terror at sight of the gently
swaying monstrosity that seemed on the point of crushing the boat
or them in its jaws. Never again will they be so overcome with
blind panic.</p>

<p>"This incident, together with my earnest persuasions, induced
the Carter boys to give up their scheme and to take away their
sea serpent and consign it to oblivion." </p>
