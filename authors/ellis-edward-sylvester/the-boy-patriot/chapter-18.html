<p>The East Indiaman was too important a prize to be trusted to
any other than the skilful sailor and brave officer, Derry Duck.
He was at once ordered to prepare to take her into an American
port, with all due formalities.</p>

<p>Derry's sea-chest contained more than his scanty wardrobe, his
golden gains during this long cruise were garnered there. Yet
he trusted it to the hands of unscrupulous men, while his own
arms found a more welcome burden. Tenderly as a mother bears her
sleeping infant, Derry clasped a slender figure to his rough bosom,
and would suffer no one to give him aid in his office of love.
There was a gentle pulsation in the heart so near to his. There
was a growing warmth in the form which was so precious to the
mate of the Molly.</p>

<p>Blair was still alive, and Derry would allow no duty to interfere
with the sacred privilege of caring for the wounded youth, and
bearing him home, living or dead, to his mother.</p>

<p>On a couch of Indian luxury Derry laid the prostrate figure of
Blair Robertson, and as he turned to leave the cabin, the face
of the once hardened tar was softened into womanly gentleness
as he said, "God help him, and bring him to, sound and well."</p>

<p>The excessive faintness and exhaustion of the wound had indeed
seemed to Blair like the lingering, reluctant parting of soul
and body; and he might well have adopted the words of that hymn,
honored by the murmured breathings of many a dying saint:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"What is this absorbs me quite,<br/>
Steals my senses, shuts my sight,<br/>
Drowns my spirit, draws my breath?<br/>
Tell me, my soul, can this be death?<br/>
The world recedes, it disappears:<br/>
Heaven opens on my eyes, my ears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sounds seraphic ring:<br/>
Lend, lend your wings: I mount, I fly;<br/>
O grave, where is thy victory!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O death, where is thy sting!"

</p>

<p>The curtain which separates this lower world from the glories
of the unseen bliss above, had grown thin and almost transparent
to the eyes of the Christian boy, thus brought to the gates of
death. Near, very near to him seemed the face of the Saviour who
had of late been his realized and beloved companion. It was as
the mother bows down to her suffering child, that this glimpse
of the dear Redeemer was made so plain to the weakened, prostrate
boy. He was still in the flesh, and to know weary waiting and
suffering, ere health should once more send the glad blood bounding
along his veins.</p>

<p>Yet there was work for Blair Robertson on his couch of pain,
work to do for his heavenly Master. Blair was not the only sufferer
on board the prize.</p>

<p>Often during the homeward voyage, a settee was placed beside
the soft couch which Derry had appropriated to Blair's especial
use. The occupant of the settee was a huge, muscular, repulsive
young man, whose yellow hair lay uncombed on his pillow, while
his pale, freckle-marked face was distorted with pain, rage, and
the torture of a rebellious spirit, when sorely smitten by the
hand of God.</p>

<p>Many of Brimstone's fierce shipmates had been hurried into eternity
in the midst of the struggle on the deck of the East Indiaman.
Blair's coarse tormentor, however, had escaped with his life,
but with one leg so wounded and bruised that it was promptly cut
off, as the only way of preventing ultimate death. Brimstone ground
his teeth and swore fearful imprecations at each movement that
reminded him of his loss. It was in vain that Derry bade him be
quiet, and rather thank God that time was left him for repentance.
In Brimstone's hardened heart there seemed no resting-place for
good seed, no soil prepared for the heavenly plant.</p>

<p>His only relief was in forgetfulness of his misfortune, when
he was wiled from thoughts of himself by one of Blair's stirring
tales of adventure, or ballads of the olden time. Blair would
weary out his little strength for the benefit of his companion,
and yet win not one word of thanks for his kindly endeavors. Yet
he persevered, ever mingling in his stories and songs whispers
of the only source of comfort for the afflicted, the only balm
for the suffering soul.</p>

<p>Brimstone's wild and wicked life had poisoned the very sources
and flow of his life's blood. His was no flesh to heal, like that
of a healthy child.</p>

<p>While Blair was daily making long strides towards health, fierce
pains and burning inflammation seized on Brimstone's stunted limb.
Then no voice could soothe him, no words of comfort reach his
ear. He chafed and tossed upon his narrow couch like a wounded
beast of the forest, and finally refused to suffer any hand to
dress or touch the afflicted part.</p>

<p>Pain ceased at last, the end was near. Death would soon claim
the loathsome body, and bring the polluted soul before the judgment-bar.
Blair gently told the sufferer the awful truth, yet not from the
lips of the lad would he believe such an announcement. It was
not until Derry's blunt confirmation made sure the fearful tidings,
that the dying man would believe that he stood on the brink of
eternity.</p>

<p>We draw the curtain on the horrors of the scenes that followed.
May it never be the reader's lot to hear the desperate cries of
a ruined soul about to meet its God.</p>

<p>The transgressor must eat of the fruit of his choice, and sink
into the pit towards which his face has been resolutely set. The
<em>wages</em> of sin is death.</p>

<p>Vain were the pleadings of Blair, and the rougher urgency of
Derry, calling on the dying man to lift his eyes to the cross
of Christ, trust, and be saved.</p>

<p>With a fearful howl of anguish the condemned soul took its flight;
while his companions, awe-struck, prayed God to spare them such
a doom.</p>

<p>On the dark waters the body of Brimstone was cast, to be seen
no more until it should rise at the last day, we fear, to the
resurrection of damnation.</p>

<p>Lost seemed the labors of Blair Robertson for the good of his
worthless shipmate; but no prayerful effort for the holy cause
is vain. Blair had other listeners than the ear to which he spoke.
Unconscious of all around him, he had but striven to touch and
uplift the soul of the dying man. The group of sailors gathered
round the departing wretch would soon be scattered far and wide
on the rolling seas, thousands of miles from the home of Blair
Robertson, and the solemn truths he had spoken might spring up
in their hearts and bear fruit unto eternal life.</p>
