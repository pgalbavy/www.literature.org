My formal education began in a small preparatory school in 
Bromstead.  I went there as a day boy.  The charge for my 
instruction was mainly set off by the periodic visits of my father 
with a large bag of battered fossils to lecture to us upon geology.  
I was one of those fortunate youngsters who take readily to school 
work, I had a good memory, versatile interests and a considerable 
appetite for commendation, and when I was barely twelve I got a 
scholarship at the City Merchants School and was entrusted with a 
scholar's railway season ticket to Victoria.  After my father's 
death a large and very animated and solidly built uncle in tweeds 
from Staffordshire, Uncle Minter, my mother's sister's husband, with 
a remarkable accent and remarkable vowel sounds, who had plunged 
into the Bromstead home once or twice for the night but who was 
otherwise unknown to me, came on the scene, sold off the three gaunt 
houses with the utmost gusto, invested the proceeds and my father's 
life insurance money, and got us into a small villa at Penge within 
sight of that immense facade of glass and iron, the Crystal Palace.  
Then he retired in a mood of good-natured contempt to his native 
habitat again.  We stayed at Penge until my mother's death.
<P>
School became a large part of the world to me, absorbing my time and 
interest, and I never acquired that detailed and intimate knowledge 
of Penge and the hilly villadom round about, that I have of the town 
and outskirts of Bromstead.
<P>
It was a district of very much the same character, but it was more 
completely urbanised and nearer to the centre of things; there were 
the same unfinished roads, the same occasional disconcerted hedges 
and trees, the same butcher's horse grazing under a builder's 
notice-board, the same incidental lapses into slum.  The Crystal 
Palace grounds cut off a large part of my walking radius to the west 
with impassable fences and forbiddingly expensive turnstiles, but it 
added to the ordinary spectacle of meteorology a great variety of 
gratuitous fireworks which banged and flared away of a night after 
supper and drew me abroad to see them better.  Such walks as I took, 
to Croydon, Wembledon, West Wickham and Greenwich, impressed upon me 
the interminable extent of London's residential suburbs; mile after 
mile one went, between houses, villas, rows of cottages, streets of 
shops, under railway arches, over railway bridges.  I have forgotten 
the detailed local characteristics--if there were any--of much of 
that region altogether.  I was only there two years, and half my 
perambulations occurred at dusk or after dark.  But with Penge I 
associate my first realisations of the wonder and beauty of twilight 
and night, the effect of dark walls reflecting lamplight, and the 
mystery of blue haze-veiled hillsides of houses, the glare of shops 
by night, the glowing steam and streaming sparks of railway trains 
and railway signals lit up in the darkness.  My first rambles in the 
evening occurred at Penge--I was becoming a big and independent-
spirited boy--and I began my experience of smoking during these 
twilight prowls with the threepenny packets of American cigarettes 
then just appearing in the world.
<P>
My life centred upon the City Merchants School.  Usually I caught 
the eight-eighteen for Victoria, I had a midday meal and tea; four 
nights a week I stayed for preparation, and often I was not back 
home again until within an hour of my bedtime.  I spent my half 
holidays at school in order to play cricket and football.  This, and 
a pretty voracious appetite for miscellaneous reading which was 
fostered by the Penge Middleton Library, did not leave me much 
leisure for local topography.  On Sundays also I sang in the choir 
at St. Martin's Church, and my mother did not like me to walk out 
alone on the Sabbath afternoon, she herself slumbered, so that I 
wrote or read at home.  I must confess I was at home as little as I 
could contrive.
<P>
Home, after my father's death, had become a very quiet and 
uneventful place indeed.  My mother had either an unimaginative 
temperament or her mind was greatly occupied with private religious 
solicitudes, and I remember her talking to me but little, and that 
usually upon topics I was anxious to evade.  I had developed my own 
view about low-Church theology long before my father's death, and my 
meditation upon that event had finished my secret estrangement from 
my mother's faith.  My reason would not permit even a remote chance 
of his being in hell, he was so manifestly not evil, and this 
religion would not permit him a remote chance of being out yet.  
When I was a little boy my mother had taught me to read and write 
and pray and had done many things for me, indeed she persisted in 
washing me and even in making my clothes until I rebelled against 
these things as indignities.  But our minds parted very soon.  She 
never began to understand the mental processes of my play, she never 
interested herself in my school life and work, she could not 
understand things I said; and she came, I think, quite insensibly to 
regard me with something of the same hopeless perplexity she had 
felt towards my father.
<P>
Him she must have wedded under considerable delusions.  I do not 
think he deceived her, indeed, nor do I suspect him of mercenariness 
in their union; but no doubt he played up to her requirements in the 
half ingenuous way that was and still is the quality of most wooing, 
and presented himself as a very brisk and orthodox young man.  I 
wonder why nearly all lovemaking has to be fraudulent.  Afterwards 
he must have disappointed her cruelly by letting one aspect after 
another of his careless, sceptical, experimental temperament appear.  
Her mind was fixed and definite, she embodied all that confidence in 
church and decorum and the assurances of the pulpit which was 
characteristic of the large mass of the English people--for after 
all, the rather low-Church section WAS the largest single mass--in 
early Victorian times.  She had dreams, I suspect, of going to 
church with him side by side; she in a little poke bonnet and a 
large flounced crinoline, all mauve and magenta and starched under a 
little lace-trimmed parasol, and he in a tall silk hat and peg-top 
trousers and a roll-collar coat, and looking rather like the Prince 
Consort,--white angels almost visibly raining benedictions on their 
amiable progress.  Perhaps she dreamt gently of much-belaced babies 
and an interestingly pious (but not too dissenting or fanatical) 
little girl or boy or so, also angel-haunted.  And I think, too, she 
must have seen herself ruling a seemly "home of taste," with a 
vivarium in the conservatory that opened out of the drawing-room, or 
again, making preserves in the kitchen.  My father's science-
teaching, his diagrams of disembowelled humanity, his pictures of 
prehistoric beasts that contradicted the Flood, his disposition 
towards soft shirts and loose tweed suits, his inability to use a 
clothes brush, his spasmodic reading fits and his bulldog pipes, 
must have jarred cruelly with her rather unintelligent 
anticipations.  His wild moments of violent temper when he would 
swear and smash things, absurd almost lovable storms that passed 
like summer thunder, must have been starkly dreadful to her.  She 
was constitutionally inadaptable, and certainly made no attempt to 
understand or tolerate these outbreaks.  She tried them by her 
standards, and by her standards they were wrong.  Her standards hid 
him from her.  The blazing things he said rankled in her mind 
unforgettably.
<P>
As I remember them together they chafed constantly.  Her attitude to 
nearly all his moods and all his enterprises was a sceptical 
disapproval.  She treated him as something that belonged to me and 
not to her.  "YOUR father," she used to call him, as though I had 
got him for her.
<P>
She had married late and she had, I think, become mentally self-
subsisting before her marriage.  Even in those Herne Hill days I 
used to wonder what was going on in her mind, and I find that old 
speculative curiosity return as I write this.  She took a 
considerable interest in the housework that our generally 
servantless condition put upon her--she used to have a charwoman in 
two or three times a week--but she did not do it with any great 
skill.  She covered most of our furniture with flouncey ill-fitting 
covers, and she cooked plainly and without very much judgment.  The 
Penge house, as it contained nearly all our Bromstead things, was 
crowded with furniture, and is chiefly associated in my mind with 
the smell of turpentine, a condiment she used very freely upon the 
veneered mahogany pieces.  My mother had an equal dread of "blacks" 
by day and the "night air," so that our brightly clean windows were 
rarely open.
<P>
She took a morning paper, and she would open it and glance at the 
headlines, but she did not read it until the afternoon and then, I 
think, she was interested only in the more violent crimes, and in 
railway and mine disasters and in the minutest domesticities of the 
Royal Family.  Most of the books at home were my father's, and I do 
not think she opened any of them.  She had one or two volumes that 
dated from her own youth, and she tried in vain to interest me in 
them; there was Miss Strickland's QUEENS OF ENGLAND, a book I 
remember with particular animosity, and QUEECHY and the WIDE WIDE 
WORLD.  She made these books of hers into a class apart by sewing 
outer covers upon them of calico and figured muslin.  To me in these 
habiliments they seemed not so much books as confederated old 
ladies.
<P>
My mother was also very punctual with her religious duties, and 
rejoiced to watch me in the choir.
<P>
On winter evenings she occupied an armchair on the other side of the 
table at which I sat, head on hand reading, and she would be darning 
stockings or socks or the like.  We achieved an effect of rather 
stuffy comfortableness that was soporific, and in a passive way I 
think she found these among her happy times.  On such occasions she 
was wont to put her work down on her knees and fall into a sort of 
thoughtless musing that would last for long intervals and rouse my 
curiosity.  For like most young people I could not imagine mental 
states without definite forms.
<P>
She carried on a correspondence with a number of cousins and 
friends, writing letters in a slanting Italian hand and dealing 
mainly with births, marriages and deaths, business starts (in the 
vaguest terms) and the distresses of bankruptcy.
<P>
And yet, you know, she did have a curious intimate life of her own 
that I suspected nothing of at the time, that only now becomes 
credible to me.  She kept a diary that is still in my possession, a 
diary of fragmentary entries in a miscellaneous collection of pocket 
books.  She put down the texts of the sermons she heard, and queer 
stiff little comments on casual visitors,--" Miss G. and much noisy 
shrieking talk about games and such frivolities and CROQUAY.  A. 
delighted and VERY ATTENTIVE."  Such little human entries abound.  
She had an odd way of never writing a name, only an initial; my 
father is always "A.," and I am always "D."  It is manifest she 
followed the domestic events in the life of the Princess of Wales, 
who is now Queen Mother, with peculiar interest and sympathy.  "Pray 
G. all may be well," she writes in one such crisis.
<P>
But there are things about myself that I still find too poignant to 
tell easily, certain painful and clumsy circumstances of my birth in 
very great detail, the distresses of my infantile ailments.  Then 
later I find such things as this: "Heard D.  s----."  The "s" is 
evidently "swear "--"  G. bless and keep my boy from evil."  And 
again, with the thin handwriting shaken by distress: "D. would not 
go to church, and hardened his heart and said wicked infidel things, 
much disrespect of the clergy.  The anthem is tiresome!!!  That men 
should set up to be wiser than their maker!!!"  Then trebly 
underlined: "I FEAR HIS FATHER'S TEACHING."  Dreadful little tangle 
of misapprehensions and false judgments!  More comforting for me to 
read, "D. very kind and good.  He grows more thoughtful every day."  
I suspect myself of forgotten hypocrisies.
<P>
At just one point my mother's papers seem to dip deeper.  I think 
the death of my father must have stirred her for the first time for 
many years to think for herself.  Even she could not go on living in 
any peace at all, believing that he had indeed been flung headlong 
into hell.  Of this gnawing solicitude she never spoke to me, never, 
and for her diary also she could find no phrases.  But on a loose 
half-sheet of notepaper between its pages I find this passage that 
follows, written very carefully.  I do not know whose lines they are 
nor how she came upon them.  They run:--
<P>
     "And if there be no meeting past the grave;
      If all is darkness, silence, yet 'tis rest.
      Be not afraid ye waiting hearts that weep,
      For God still giveth His beloved sleep,
      And if an endless sleep He wills, so best."
<P>
That scrap of verse amazed me when I read it.  I could even wonder 
if my mother really grasped the import of what she had copied out.  
It affected me as if a stone-deaf person had suddenly turned and 
joined in a whispered conversation.  It set me thinking how far a 
mind in its general effect quite hopelessly limited, might range.  
After that I went through all her diaries, trying to find something 
more than a conventional term of tenderness for my father.  But I 
found nothing.  And yet somehow there grew upon me the realisation 
that there had been love. . . .  Her love for me, on the other hand, 
was abundantly expressed.
<P>
I knew nothing of that secret life of feeling at the time; such 
expression as it found was all beyond my schoolboy range.  I did not 
know when I pleased her and I did not know when I distressed her.  
Chiefly I was aware of my mother as rather dull company, as a mind 
thorny with irrational conclusions and incapable of explication, as 
one believing quite wilfully and irritatingly in impossible things.  
So I suppose it had to be; life was coming to me in new forms and 
with new requirements.  It was essential to our situation that we 
should fail to understand.  After this space of years I have come to 
realisations and attitudes that dissolve my estrangement from her, I 
can pierce these barriers, I can see her and feel her as a loving 
and feeling and desiring and muddle-headed person.  There are times 
when I would have her alive again, if only that I might be kind to 
her for a little while and give her some return for the narrow 
intense affection, the tender desires, she evidently lavished so 
abundantly on me.  But then again I ask how I could make that 
return?  And I realise the futility of such dreaming.  Her demand 
was rigid, and to meet it I should need to act and lie.
<P>
So she whose blood fed me, whose body made me, lies in my memory as 
I saw her last, fixed, still, infinitely intimate, infinitely 
remote. . . .
<P>
My own case with my mother, however, does not awaken the same regret 
I feel when I think of how she misjudged and irked my father, and 
turned his weaknesses into thorns for her own tormenting.  I wish I 
could look back without that little twinge to two people who were 
both in their different quality so good.  But goodness that is 
narrow is a pedestrian and ineffectual goodness.  Her attitude to my 
father seems to me one of the essentially tragic things that have 
come to me personally, one of those things that nothing can 
transfigure, that REMAIN sorrowful, that I cannot soothe with any 
explanation, for as I remember him he was indeed the most lovable of 
weak spasmodic men.  But my mother had been trained in a hard and 
narrow system that made evil out of many things not in the least 
evil, and inculcated neither kindliness nor charity.  All their 
estrangement followed from that.
<P>
These cramping cults do indeed take an enormous toll of human love 
and happiness, and not only that but what we Machiavellians must 
needs consider, they make frightful breaches in human solidarity.  I 
suppose I am a deeply religious man, as men of my quality go, but I 
hate more and more, as I grow older, the shadow of intolerance cast 
by religious organisations.  All my life has been darkened by 
irrational intolerance, by arbitrary irrational prohibitions and 
exclusions.  Mahometanism with its fierce proselytism, has, I 
suppose, the blackest record of uncharitableness, but most of the 
Christian sects are tainted, tainted to a degree beyond any of the 
anterior paganisms, with this same hateful quality.  It is their 
exclusive claim that sends them wrong, the vain ambition that 
inspires them all to teach a uniform one-sided God and be the one 
and only gateway to salvation.  Deprecation of all outside the 
household of faith, an organised undervaluation of heretical 
goodness and lovableness, follows, necessarily.  Every petty 
difference is exaggerated to the quality of a saving grace or a 
damning defect.  Elaborate precautions are taken to shield the 
believer's mind against broad or amiable suggestions; the faithful 
are deterred by dark allusions, by sinister warnings, from books, 
from theatres, from worldly conversation, from all the kindly 
instruments that mingle human sympathy.  For only by isolating its 
flock can the organisation survive.
<P>
Every month there came to my mother a little magazine called, if I 
remember rightly, the HOME CHURCHMAN, with the combined authority of 
print and clerical commendation.  It was the most evil thing that 
ever came into the house, a very devil, a thin little pamphlet with 
one woodcut illustration on the front page of each number; now the 
uninviting visage of some exponent of the real and only doctrine and 
attitudes, now some coral strand in act of welcoming the 
missionaries of God's mysterious preferences, now a new church in 
the Victorian Gothic.  The vile rag it was!  A score of vices that 
shun the policeman have nothing of its subtle wickedness.  It was an 
outrage upon the natural kindliness of men.  The contents were all 
admirably adjusted to keep a spirit in prison.  Their force of 
sustained suggestion was tremendous.  There would be dreadful 
intimations of the swift retribution that fell upon individuals for 
Sabbath-breaking, and upon nations for weakening towards Ritualism, 
or treating Roman Catholics as tolerable human beings; there would 
be great rejoicings over the conversion of alleged Jews, and 
terrible descriptions of the death-beds of prominent infidels with 
boldly invented last words,--the most unscrupulous lying; there 
would be the appallingly edifying careers of "early piety" 
lusciously described, or stories of condemned criminals who traced 
their final ruin unerringly to early laxities of the kind that leads 
people to give up subscribing to the HOME CHURCHMAN.
<P>
Every month that evil spirit brought about a slump in our mutual 
love.  My mother used to read the thing and become depressed and 
anxious for my spiritual welfare, used to be stirred to 
unintelligent pestering. . . .
<P>
<P>

<P>
A few years ago I met the editor of this same HOME CHURCHMAN.  It 
was at one of the weekly dinners of that Fleet Street dining club, 
the Blackfriars.
<P>
I heard the paper's name with a queer little shock and surveyed the 
man with interest.  No doubt he was only a successor of the purveyor 
of discords who darkened my boyhood.  It was amazing to find an 
influence so terrible embodied in a creature so palpably petty.  He 
was seated some way down a table at right angles to the one at which 
I sat, a man of mean appearance with a greyish complexion, thin, 
with a square nose, a heavy wiry moustache and a big Adam's apple 
sticking out between the wings of his collar.  He ate with 
considerable appetite and unconcealed relish, and as his jaw was 
underhung, he chummed and made the moustache wave like reeds in the 
swell of a steamer.  It gave him a conscientious look.  After dinner 
he a little forced himself upon me.  At that time, though the shadow 
of my scandal was already upon me, I still seemed to be shaping for 
great successes, and he was glad to be in conversation with me and 
anxious to intimate political sympathy and support.  I tried to make 
him talk of the HOME CHURCHMAN and the kindred publications he ran, 
but he was manifestly ashamed of his job so far as I was concerned.
<P>
"One wants," he said, pitching himself as he supposed in my key, "to 
put constructive ideas into our readers, but they are narrow, you 
know, very narrow.  Very."  He made his moustache and lips express 
judicious regret.  "One has to consider them carefully, one has to 
respect their attitudes.  One dare not go too far with them.  One 
has to feel one's way."
<P>
He chummed and the moustache bristled.
<P>
A hireling, beyond question, catering for a demand.  I gathered 
there was a home in Tufnell Park, and three boys to be fed and 
clothed and educated. . . .
<P>
I had the curiosity to buy a copy of his magazine afterwards, and it 
seemed much the same sort of thing that had worried my mother in my 
boyhood.  There was the usual Christian hero, this time with mutton-
chop whiskers and a long bare upper lip.  The Jesuits, it seemed, 
were still hard at it, and Heaven frightfully upset about the Sunday 
opening of museums and the falling birth-rate, and as touchy and 
vindictive as ever.  There were two vigorous paragraphs upon the 
utter damnableness of the Rev. R. J. Campbell, a contagious 
damnableness I gathered, one wasn't safe within a mile of Holborn 
Viaduct, and a foul-mouthed attack on poor little Wilkins the 
novelist--who was being baited by the moralists at that time for 
making one of his big women characters, not being in holy wedlock, 
desire a baby and say so. . . .
<P>
The broadening of human thought is a slow and complex process.  We 
do go on, we do get on.  But when one thinks that people are living 
and dying now, quarrelling and sulking, misled and misunderstanding, 
vaguely fearful, condemning and thwarting one another in the close 
darknesses of these narrow cults--Oh, God! one wants a gale out of 
Heaven, one wants a great wind from the sea!
<P>
<P>

<P>
While I lived at Penge two little things happened to me, trivial in 
themselves and yet in their quality profoundly significant.  They 
had this in common, that they pierced the texture of the life I was 
quietly taking for granted and let me see through it into realities--
realities I had indeed known about before but never realised.  Each 
of these experiences left me with a sense of shock, with all the 
values in my life perplexingly altered, attempting readjustment.  
One of these disturbing and illuminating events was that I was 
robbed of a new pocket-knife and the other that I fell in love.  It 
was altogether surprising to me to be robbed.  You see, as an only 
child I had always been fairly well looked after and protected, and 
the result was an amazing confidence in the practical goodness of 
the people one met in the world.  I knew there were robbers in the 
world, just as I knew there were tigers; that I was ever likely to 
meet robber or tiger face to face seemed equally impossible.
<P>
The knife as I remember it was a particularly jolly one with all 
sorts of instruments in it, tweezers and a thing for getting a stone 
out of the hoof of a horse, and a corkscrew; it had cost me a 
carefuly accumulated half-crown, and amounted indeed to a new 
experience in knives.  I had had it for two or three days, and then 
one afternoon I dropped it through a hole in my pocket on a footpath 
crossing a field between Penge and Anerley.  I heard it fall in the 
way one does without at the time appreciating what had happened, 
then, later, before I got home, when my hand wandered into my pocket 
to embrace the still dear new possession I found it gone, and 
instantly that memory of something hitting the ground sprang up into 
consciousness.  I went back and commenced a search.  Almost 
immediately I was accosted by the leader of a little gang of four or 
five extremely dirty and ragged boys of assorted sizes and slouching 
carriage who were coming from the Anerley direction.
<P>
"Lost anythink, Matey?" said he.
<P>
I explained.
<P>
"'E's dropped 'is knife," said my interlocutor, and joined in the 
search.
<P>
"What sort of 'andle was it, Matey?" said a small white-faced 
sniffing boy in a big bowler hat.
<P>
I supplied the information.  His sharp little face scrutinised the 
ground about us.
<P>
"GOT it," he said, and pounced.
<P>
"Give it 'ere," said the big boy hoarsely, and secured it.
<P>
I walked towards him serenely confident that he would hand it over 
to me, and that all was for the best in the best of all possible 
worlds.
<P>
"No bloomin' fear!" he said, regarding me obliquely.  "Oo said it 
was your knife?"
<P>
Remarkable doubts assailed me.  "Of course it's my knife," I said.  
The other boys gathered round me.
<P>
"This ain't your knife," said the big boy, and spat casually.
<P>
"I dropped it just now."
<P>
"Findin's keepin's, I believe," said the big boy.
<P>
"Nonsense," I said.  "Give me my knife."
<P>
"'Ow many blades it got?"
<P>
"Three."
<P>
"And what sort of 'andle?"
<P>
"Bone."
<P>
"Got a corkscrew like?"
<P>
"Yes."
<P>
"Ah!  This ain't your knife no'ow.  See?"
<P>
He made no offer to show it to me.  My breath went.
<P>
"Look here!" I said.  "I saw that kid pick it up.  It IS my knife."
<P>
"Rot!" said the big boy, and slowly, deliberately put my knife into 
his trouser pocket.
<P>
I braced my soul for battle.  All civilisation was behind me, but I 
doubt if it kept the colour in my face.  I buttoned my jacket and 
clenched my fists and advanced on my antagonist--he had, I suppose, 
the advantage of two years of age and three inches of height.  "Hand 
over that knife," I said.
<P>
Then one of the smallest of the band assailed me with extraordinary 
vigour and swiftness from behind, had an arm round my neck and a 
knee in my back before I had the slightest intimation of attack, and 
so got me down.  "I got 'im, Bill," squeaked this amazing little 
ruffian.  My nose was flattened by a dirty hand, and as I struck out 
and hit something like sacking, some one kicked my elbow.  Two or 
three seemed to be at me at the same time.  Then I rolled over and 
sat up to discover them all making off, a ragged flight, footballing 
my cap, my City Merchants' cap, amongst them.  I leapt to my feet in 
a passion of indignation and pursued them.
<P>
But I did not overtake them.  We are beings of mixed composition, 
and I doubt if mine was a single-minded pursuit.  I knew that honour 
required me to pursue, and I had a vivid impression of having just 
been down in the dust with a very wiry and active and dirty little 
antagonist of disagreeable odour and incredible and incalculable 
unscrupulousness, kneeling on me and gripping my arm and neck.  I 
wanted of course to be even with him, but also I doubted if catching 
him would necessarily involve that.  They kicked my cap into the 
ditch at the end of the field, and made off compactly along a cinder 
lane while I turned aside to recover my dishonoured headdress.  As I 
knocked the dust out of that and out of my jacket, and brushed my 
knees and readjusted my very crumpled collar, I tried to focus this 
startling occurrence in my mind.
<P>
I had vague ideas of going to a policeman or of complaining at a 
police station, but some boyish instinct against informing prevented 
that.  No doubt I entertained ideas of vindictive pursuit and 
murderous reprisals.  And I was acutely enraged whenever I thought 
of my knife.  The thing indeed rankled in my mind for weeks and 
weeks, and altered all the flavour of my world for me.  It was the 
first time I glimpsed the simple brute violence that lurks and peeps 
beneath our civilisation.  A certain kindly complacency of attitude 
towards the palpably lower classes was qualified for ever
<P>
<P>

<P>
But the other experience was still more cardinal.  It was the first 
clear intimation of a new motif in life, the sex motif, that was to 
rise and increase and accumulate power and enrichment and interweave 
with and at last dominate all my life.
<P>
It was when I was nearly fifteen this happened.  It is inseparably 
connected in my mind with the dusk of warm September evenings.  I 
never met the girl I loved by daylight, and I have forgotten her 
name.  It was some insignificant name.
<P>
Yet the peculiar quality of the adventure keeps it shining darkly 
like some deep coloured gem in the common setting of my memories.  
It came as something new and strange, something that did not join on 
to anything else in my life or connect with any of my thoughts or 
beliefs or habits; it was a wonder, a mystery, a discovery about 
myself, a discovery about the whole world.  Only in after years did 
sexual feeling lose that isolation and spread itself out to 
illuminate and pervade and at last possess the whole broad vision of 
life.
<P>
It was in that phase of an urban youth's development, the phase of 
the cheap cigarette, that this thing happened.  One evening I came 
by chance on a number of young people promenading by the light of a 
row of shops towards Beckington, and, with all the glory of a 
glowing cigarette between my lips, I joined their strolling number.  
These twilight parades of young people, youngsters chiefly of the 
lower middle-class, are one of the odd social developments of the 
great suburban growths--unkindly critics, blind to the inner 
meanings of things, call them, I believe, Monkeys' Parades--the shop 
apprentices, the young work girls, the boy clerks and so forth, 
stirred by mysterious intimations, spend their first-earned money 
upon collars and ties, chiffon hats, smart lace collars, walking-
sticks, sunshades or cigarettes, and come valiantly into the vague 
transfiguring mingling of gaslight and evening, to walk up and down, 
to eye meaningly, even to accost and make friends.  It is a queer 
instinctive revolt from the narrow limited friendless homes in which 
so many find themselves, a going out towards something, romance if 
you will, beauty, that has suddenly become a need--a need that 
hitherto has lain dormant and unsuspected.  They promenade.
<P>
Vulgar!--it is as vulgar as the spirit that calls the moth abroad in 
the evening and lights the body of the glow-worm in the night.  I 
made my way through the throng, a little contemptuously as became a 
public schoolboy, my hands in my pockets--none of your cheap canes 
for me!--and very careful of the lie of my cigarette upon my lips.  
And two girls passed me, one a little taller than the other, with 
dim warm-tinted faces under clouds of dark hair and with dark eyes 
like pools reflecting stars.
<P>
I half turned, and the shorter one glanced back at me over her 
shoulder--I could draw you now the pose of her cheek and neck and 
shoulder--and instantly I was as passionately in love with the girl 
as I have ever been before or since, as any man ever was with any 
woman.  I turned about and followed them, I flung away my cigarette 
ostentatiously and lifted my school cap and spoke to them.
<P>
The girl answered shyly with her dark eyes on my face.  What I said 
and what she said I cannot remember, but I have little doubt it was 
something absolutely vapid.  It really did not matter; the thing was 
we had met.  I felt as I think a new-hatched moth must feel when 
suddenly its urgent headlong searching brings it in tremulous 
amazement upon its mate.
<P>
We met, covered from each other, with all the nets of civilisation 
keeping us apart.  We walked side by side.
<P>
It led to scarcely more than that.  I think we met four or five 
times altogether, and always with her nearly silent elder sister on 
the other side of her.  We walked on the last two occasions arm in 
arm, furtively caressing each other's hands, we went away from the 
glare of the shops into the quiet roads of villadom, and there we 
whispered instead of talking and looked closely into one another's 
warm and shaded face.  "Dear," I whispered very daringly, and she 
answered, "Dear!"  We had a vague sense that we wanted more of that 
quality of intimacy and more.  We wanted each other as one wants 
beautiful music again or to breathe again the scent of flowers.
<P>
And that is all there was between us.  The events are nothing, the 
thing that matters is the way in which this experience stabbed 
through the common stuff of life and left it pierced, with a light, 
with a huge new interest shining through the rent.
<P>
When I think of it I can recall even now the warm mystery of her 
face, her lips a little apart, lips that I never kissed, her soft 
shadowed throat, and I feel again the sensuous stir of her 
proximity. . . .
<P>
Those two girls never told me their surname nor let me approach 
their house.  They made me leave them at the corner of a road of 
small houses near Penge Station.  And quite abruptly, without any 
intimation, they vanished and came to the meeting place no more, 
they vanished as a moth goes out of a window into the night, and 
left me possessed of an intolerable want. . . .
<P>
The affair pervaded my existence for many weeks.  I could not do my 
work and I could not rest at home.  Night after night I promenaded 
up and down that Monkeys' Parade full of an unappeasable desire, 
with a thwarted sense of something just begun that ought to have 
gone on.  I went backwards and forwards on the way to the vanishing 
place, and at last explored the forbidden road that had swallowed 
them up.  But I never saw her again, except that later she came to 
me, my symbol of womanhood, in dreams.  How my blood was stirred!  I 
lay awake of nights whispering in the darkness for her.  I prayed 
for her.
<P>
Indeed that girl, who probably forgot the last vestiges of me when 
her first real kiss came to her, ruled and haunted me, gave a Queen 
to my imagination and a texture to all my desires until I became a 
man.
<P>
I generalised her at last.  I suddenly discovered that poetry was 
about her and that she was the key to all that had hitherto seemed 
nonsense about love.  I took to reading novels, and if the heroine 
could not possibly be like her, dusky and warm and starlike, I put 
the book aside. . . .
<P>
I hesitate and add here one other confession.  I want to tell this 
thing because it seems to me we are altogether too restrained and 
secretive about such matters.  The cardinal thing in life sneaks in 
to us darkly and shamefully like a thief in the night.
<P>
One day during my Cambridge days--it must have been in my first year 
before I knew Hatherleigh--I saw in a print-shop window near the 
Strand an engraving of a girl that reminded me sharply of Penge and 
its dusky encounter.  It was just a half length of a bare-
shouldered, bare-breasted Oriental with arms akimbo, smiling 
faintly.  I looked at it, went my way, then turned back and bought 
it.  I felt I must have it.  The odd thing is that I was more than a 
little shamefaced about it.  I did not have it framed and hung in my 
room open to the criticism of my friends, but I kept it in the 
drawer of my writing-table.  And I kept that drawer locked for a 
year.  It speedily merged with and became identified with the dark 
girl of Penge.  That engraving became in a way my mistress.  Often 
when I had sported my oak and was supposed to be reading, I was 
sitting with it before me.
<P>
Obeying some instinct I kept the thing very secret indeed.  For a 
time nobody suspected what was locked in my drawer nor what was 
locked in me.  I seemed as sexless as my world required.
<P>
<P>

<P>
These things stabbed through my life, intimations of things above 
and below and before me.  They had an air of being no more than 
incidents, interruptions.
<P>
The broad substance of my existence at this time was the City 
Merchants School.  Home was a place where I slept and read, and the 
mooning explorations of the south-eastern postal district which 
occupied the restless evenings and spare days of my vacations mere 
interstices, giving glimpses of enigmatical lights and distant 
spaces between the woven threads of a school-boy's career.  School 
life began for me every morning at Herne Hill, for there I was 
joined by three or four other boys and the rest of the way we went 
together.  Most of the streets and roads we traversed in our 
morning's walk from Victoria are still intact, the storms of 
rebuilding that have submerged so much of my boyhood's London have 
passed and left them, and I have revived the impression of them 
again and again in recent years as I have clattered dinnerward in a 
hansom or hummed along in a motor cab to some engagement.  The main 
gate still looks out with the same expression of ancient well-
proportioned kindliness upon St. Margaret's Close.  There are 
imposing new science laboratories in Chambers Street indeed, but the 
old playing fields are unaltered except for the big electric trams 
that go droning and spitting blue flashes along the western 
boundary.  I know Ratten, the new Head, very well, but I have not 
been inside the school to see if it has changed at all since I went 
up to Cambridge.
<P>
I took all they put before us very readily as a boy, for I had a 
mind of vigorous appetite, but since I have grown mentally to man's 
estate and developed a more and more comprehensive view of our 
national process and our national needs, I am more and more struck 
by the oddity of the educational methods pursued, their aimless 
disconnectedness from the constructive forces in the community.  I 
suppose if we are to view the public school as anything more than an 
institution that has just chanced to happen, we must treat it as 
having a definite function towards the general scheme of the nation, 
as being in a sense designed to take the crude young male of the 
more or less responsible class, to correct his harsh egotisms, 
broaden his outlook, give him a grasp of the contemporary 
developments he will presently be called upon to influence and 
control, and send him on to the university to be made a leading and 
ruling social man.  It is easy enough to carp at schoolmasters and 
set up for an Educational Reformer, I know, but still it is 
impossible not to feel how infinitely more effectually--given 
certain impossibilities perhaps--the job might be done.
<P>
My memory of school has indeed no hint whatever of that quality of 
elucidation it seems reasonable to demand from it.  Here all about 
me was London, a vast inexplicable being, a vortex of gigantic 
forces, that filled and overwhelmed me with impressions, that 
stirred my imagination to a perpetual vague enquiry; and my school 
not only offered no key to it, but had practically no comment to 
make upon it at all.  We were within three miles of Westminster and 
Charing Cross, the government offices of a fifth of mankind were all 
within an hour's stroll, great economic changes were going on under 
our eyes, now the hoardings flamed with election placards, now the 
Salvation Army and now the unemployed came trailing in procession 
through the winter-grey streets, now the newspaper placards outside 
news-shops told of battles in strange places, now of amazing 
discoveries, now of sinister crimes, abject squalor and poverty, 
imperial splendour and luxury, Buckingham Palace, Rotten Row, 
Mayfair, the slums of Pimlico, garbage-littered streets of bawling 
costermongers, the inky silver of the barge-laden Thames--such was 
the background of our days.  We went across St. Margaret's Close and 
through the school gate into a quiet puerile world apart from all 
these things.  We joined in the earnest acquirement of all that was 
necessary for Greek epigrams and Latin verse, and for the rest 
played games.  We dipped down into something clear and elegantly 
proportioned and time-worn and for all its high resolve of stalwart 
virility a little feeble, like our blackened and decayed portals by 
Inigo Jones.
<P>
Within, we were taught as the chief subjects of instruction, Latin 
and Greek.  We were taught very badly because the men who taught us 
did not habitually use either of these languages, nobody uses them 
any more now except perhaps for the Latin of a few Levantine 
monasteries.  At the utmost our men read them.  We were taught these 
languages because long ago Latin had been the language of 
civilisation; the one way of escape from the narrow and localised 
life had lain in those days through Latin, and afterwards Greek had 
come in as the vehicle of a flood of new and amazing ideas.  Once 
these two languages had been the sole means of initiation to the 
detached criticism and partial comprehension of the world.  I can 
imagine the fierce zeal of our first Heads, Gardener and Roper, 
teaching Greek like passionate missionaries, as a progressive 
Chinaman might teach English to the boys of Pekin, clumsily, 
impatiently, with rod and harsh urgency, but sincerely, 
patriotically, because they felt that behind it lay revelations, the 
irresistible stimulus to a new phase of history.  That was long ago.  
A new great world, a vaster Imperialism had arisen about the school, 
had assimilated all these amazing and incredible ideas, had gone on 
to new and yet more amazing developments of its own.  But the City 
Merchants School still made the substance of its teaching Latin and 
Greek, still, with no thought of rotating crops, sowed in a dream 
amidst the harvesting.
<P>
There is no fierceness left in the teaching now.  Just after I went 
up to Trinity, Gates, our Head, wrote a review article in defence of 
our curriculum.  In this, among other indiscretions, he asserted 
that it was impossible to write good English without an illuminating 
knowledge of the classic tongues, and he split an infinitive and 
failed to button up a sentence in saying so.  His main argument 
conceded every objection a reasonable person could make to the City 
Merchants' curriculum.  He admitted that translation had now placed 
all the wisdom of the past at a common man's disposal, that scarcely 
a field of endeavour remained in which modern work had not long 
since passed beyond the ancient achievement.  He disclaimed any 
utility.  But there was, he said, a peculiar magic in these 
grammatical exercises no other subjects of instruction possessed.  
Nothing else provided the same strengthening and orderly discipline 
for the mind.
<P>
He said that, knowing the Senior Classics he did, himself a Senior 
Classic!
<P>
Yet in a dim confused way I think be was making out a case.  In 
schools as we knew them, and with the sort of assistant available, 
the sort of assistant who has been trained entirely on the old 
lines, he could see no other teaching so effectual in developing 
attention, restraint, sustained constructive effort and various yet 
systematic adjustment.  And that was as far as his imagination could 
go.
<P>
It is infinitely easier to begin organised human affairs than end 
them; the curriculum and the social organisation of the English 
public school are the crowning instances of that.  They go on 
because they have begun.  Schools are not only immortal institutions 
but reproductive ones.  Our founder, Jabez Arvon, knew nothing, I am 
sure, of Gates' pedagogic values and would, I feel certain, have 
dealt with them disrespectfully.  But public schools and university 
colleges sprang into existence correlated, the scholars went on to 
the universities and came back to teach the schools, to teach as 
they themselves had been taught, before they had ever made any real 
use of the teaching; the crowd of boys herded together, a crowd 
perpetually renewed and unbrokenly the same, adjusted itself by 
means of spontaneously developed institutions.  In a century, by its 
very success, this revolutionary innovation of Renascence public 
schools had become an immense tradition woven closely into the 
fabric of the national life.  Intelligent and powerful people ceased 
to talk Latin or read Greek, they had got what was wanted, but that 
only left the schoolmaster the freer to elaborate his point.  Since 
most men of any importance or influence in the country had been 
through the mill, it was naturally a little difficult to persuade 
them that it was not quite the best and most ennobling mill the wit 
of man could devise.  And, moreover, they did not want their 
children made strange to them.  There was all the machinery and all 
the men needed to teach the old subjects, and none to teach whatever 
new the critic might propose.  Such science instruction as my father 
gave seemed indeed the uninviting alternative to the classical 
grind.  It was certainly an altogether inferior instrument at that 
time.
<P>
So it was I occupied my mind with the exact study of dead languages 
for seven long years.  It was the strangest of detachments.  We 
would sit under the desk of such a master as Topham like creatures 
who had fallen into an enchanted pit, and he would do his 
considerable best to work us up to enthusiasm for, let us say, a 
Greek play.  If we flagged he would lash himself to revive us.  He 
would walk about the class-room mouthing great lines in a rich roar, 
and asking us with a flushed face and shining eyes if it was not 
"GLORIOUS."  The very sight of Greek letters brings back to me the 
dingy, faded, ink-splashed quality of our class-room, the banging of 
books, Topham's disordered hair, the sheen of his alpaca gown, his 
deep unmusical intonations and the wide striding of his creaking 
boots.  Glorious!  And being plastic human beings we would consent 
that it was glorious, and some of us even achieved an answering 
reverberation and a sympathetic flush.  I at times responded freely.   
We all accepted from him unquestioningly that these melodies, these 
strange sounds, exceeded any possibility of beauty that lay in the 
Gothic intricacy, the splash and glitter, the jar and recovery, the 
stabbing lights, the heights and broad distances of our English 
tongue.  That indeed was the chief sin of him.  It was not that he 
was for Greek and Latin, but that he was fiercely against every 
beauty that was neither classic nor deferred to classical canons.
<P>
And what exactly did we make of it, we seniors who understood it 
best?  We visualised dimly through that dust and the grammatical 
difficulties, the spectacle of the chorus chanting grotesquely, 
helping out protagonist and antagonist, masked and buskined, with 
the telling of incomprehensible parricides, of inexplicable incest, 
of gods faded beyond symbolism, of that Relentless Law we did not 
believe in for a moment, that no modern western European can believe 
in.  We thought of the characters in the unconvincing wigs and 
costumes of our school performance.  No Gilbert Murray had come as 
yet to touch these things to life again.  It was like the ghost of 
an antiquarian's toy theatre, a ghost that crumbled and condensed 
into a gritty dust of construing as one looked at it.
<P>
Marks, shindies, prayers and punishments, all flavoured with the 
leathery stuffiness of time-worn Big Hall. . . .
<P>
And then out one would come through our grey old gate into the 
evening light and the spectacle of London hurrying like a cataract, 
London in black and brown and blue and gleaming silver, roaring like 
the very loom of Time.  We came out into the new world no teacher 
has yet had the power and courage to grasp and expound.  Life and 
death sang all about one, joys and fears on such a scale, in such an 
intricacy as never Greek nor Roman knew.  The interminable 
procession of horse omnibuses went lumbering past, bearing countless 
people we knew not whence, we knew not whither.  Hansoms clattered, 
foot passengers jostled one, a thousand appeals of shop and boarding 
caught the eye.  The multi-coloured lights of window and street 
mingled with the warm glow of the declining day under the softly 
flushing London skies; the ever-changing placards, the shouting 
news-vendors, told of a kaleidoscopic drama all about the globe.  
One did not realise what had happened to us, but the voice of Topham 
was suddenly drowned and lost, he and his minute, remote 
gesticulations. . . .
<P>
That submerged and isolated curriculum did not even join on to 
living interests where it might have done so.   We were left 
absolutely to the hints of the newspapers, to casual political 
speeches, to the cartoons of the comic papers or a chance reading of 
some Socialist pamphlet for any general ideas whatever about the 
huge swirling world process in which we found ourselves.  I always 
look back with particular exasperation to the cessation of our 
modern history at the year 1815.  There it pulled up abruptly, as 
though it had come upon something indelicate. . . .
<P>
But, after all, what would Topham or Flack have made of the huge 
adjustments of the nineteenth century?  Flack was the chief 
cricketer on the staff; he belonged to that great cult which 
pretends that the place of this or that county in the struggle for 
the championship is a matter of supreme importance to boys.  He 
obliged us to affect a passionate interest in the progress of county 
matches, to work up unnatural enthusiasms.  What a fuss there would 
be when some well-trained boy, panting as if from Marathon, appeared 
with an evening paper!  "I say, you chaps, Middlesex all out for a 
hundred and five!"
<P>
Under Flack's pressure I became, I confess, a cricket humbug of the 
first class.  I applied myself industriously year by year to 
mastering scores and averages; I pretended that Lords or the Oval 
were the places nearest Paradise for me.  (I never went to either.)  
Through a slight mistake about the county boundary I adopted Surrey 
for my loyalty, though as a matter of fact we were by some five 
hundred yards or so in Kent.  It did quite as well for my purposes.  
I bowled rather straight and fast, and spent endless hours acquiring 
the skill to bowl Flack out.  He was a bat in the Corinthian style, 
rich and voluminous, and succumbed very easily to a low shooter or 
an unexpected Yorker, hut usually he was caught early by long leg.  
The difficulty was to bowl him before he got caught.  He loved to 
lift a ball to leg.  After one had clean bowled him at the practice 
nets one deliberately gave him a ball to leg just to make him feel 
nice again.
<P>
Flack went about a world of marvels dreaming of leg hits.  He has 
been observed, going across the Park on his way to his highly 
respectable club in Piccadilly, to break from profound musings into 
a strange brief dance that ended with an imaginary swipe with his 
umbrella, a roofer, over the trees towards Buckingham Palace.  The 
hit accomplished, Flack resumed his way.
<P>
Inadequately instructed foreigners would pass him in terror, 
needlessly alert.
<P>
<P>

<P>
These schoolmasters move through my memory as always a little 
distant and more than a little incomprehensible.  Except when they 
wore flannels, I saw them almost always in old college caps and 
gowns, a uniform which greatly increased their detachment from the 
world of actual men.  Gates, the head, was a lean loose-limbed man, 
rather stupid I discovered when I reached the Sixth and came into 
contact with him, but honest, simple and very eager to be liberal-
minded.  He was bald, with an almost conical baldness, with a 
grizzled pointed beard, small featured and, under the stresses of a 
Zeitgeist that demanded liberality, with an expression of puzzled 
but resolute resistance to his own unalterable opinions.  He made a 
tall dignified figure in his gown.  In my junior days he spoke to me 
only three or four times, and then he annoyed me by giving me a 
wrong surname; it was a sore point because I was an outsider and not 
one of the old school families, the Shoesmiths, the Naylors, the 
Marklows, the Tophams, the Pevises and suchlike, who came generation 
after generation.  I recall him most vividly against the background 
of faded brown book-backs in the old library in which we less 
destructive seniors were trusted to work, with the light from the 
stained-glass window falling in coloured patches on his face.  It 
gave him the appearance of having no colour of his own.  He had a 
habit of scratching the beard on his cheek as he talked, and he used 
to come and consult us about things and invariably do as we said.  
That, in his phraseology, was "maintaining the traditions of the 
school."
<P>
He had indeed an effect not of a man directing a school, but of a 
man captured and directed by a school.  Dead and gone Elizabethans 
had begotten a monster that could carry him about in its mouth.
<P>
Yet being a man, as I say, with his hair a little stirred by a 
Zeitgeist that made for change, Gates did at times display a 
disposition towards developments.  City Merchants had no modern 
side, and utilitarian spirits were carping in the PALL MALL GAZETTE 
and elsewhere at the omissions from our curriculum, and particularly 
at our want of German.   Moreover, four classes still worked 
together with much clashing and uproar in the old Big Hall that had 
once held in a common tumult the entire school.  Gates used to come 
and talk to us older fellows about these things.
<P>
"I don't wish to innovate unduly," he used to say.  But we ought to 
get in some German, you know,--for those who like it.  The army men 
will be wanting it some of these days."
<P>
He referred to the organisation of regular evening preparation for 
the lower boys in Big Hall as a "revolutionary change," but he 
achieved it, and he declared he began the replacement of the hacked 
wooden tables, at which the boys had worked since Tudor days, by 
sloping desks with safety inkpots and scientifically adjustable 
seats, "with grave misgivings."  And though he never birched a boy 
in his life, and was, I am convinced, morally incapable of such a 
scuffle, he retained the block and birch in the school through all 
his term of office, and spoke at the Headmasters' Conference in 
temperate approval of corporal chastisement, comparing it, dear 
soul! to the power of the sword. . . .
<P>
I wish I could, in some measure and without tediousness, convey the 
effect of his discourses to General Assembly in Big Hall.  But that 
is like trying to draw the obverse and reverse of a sixpence worn to 
complete illegibility.  His tall fine figure stood high on the days, 
his thoughtful tenor filled the air as he steered his hazardous way 
through sentences that dragged inconclusive tails and dropped 
redundant prepositions.  And he pleaded ever so urgently, ever so 
finely, that what we all knew for Sin was sinful, and on the whole 
best avoided altogether, and so went on with deepening notes and 
even with short arresting gestures of the right arm and hand, to 
stir and exhort us towards goodness, towards that modern, 
unsectarian goodness, goodness in general and nothing in particular, 
which the Zeitgeist seemed to indicate in those transitional years.
<P>

<P>
The school never quite got hold of me.  Partly I think that was 
because I was a day-boy and so freer than most of the boys, partly 
because of a temperamental disposition to see things in my own way 
and have my private dreams, partly because I was a little 
antagonised by the family traditions that ran through the school.  I 
was made to feel at first that I was a rank outsider, and I never 
quite forgot it.  I suffered very little bullying, and I never had a 
fight--in all my time there were only three fights--but I followed 
my own curiosities.  I was already a very keen theologian and 
politician before I was fifteen.  I was also intensely interested in 
modern warfare.  I read the morning papers in the Reading Room 
during the midday recess, never missed the illustrated weeklies, and 
often when I could afford it I bought a PALL MALL GAZETTE on my way 
home.
<P>
I do not think that I was very exceptional in that; most intelligent 
boys, I believe, want naturally to be men, and are keenly interested 
in men's affairs.  There is not the universal passion for a 
magnified puerility among them it is customary to assume.  I was 
indeed a voracious reader of everything but boys' books--which I 
detested--and fiction.  I read histories, travel, popular science 
and controversy with particular zest, and I loved maps.  School work 
and school games were quite subordinate affairs for me.  I worked 
well and made a passable figure at games, and I do not think I was 
abnormally insensitive to the fine quality of our school, to the 
charm of its mediaeval nucleus, its Gothic cloisters, its scraps of 
Palladian and its dignified Georgian extensions; the contrast of the 
old quiet, that in spite of our presence pervaded it everywhere, 
with the rushing and impending London all about it, was indeed a 
continual pleasure to me.  But these things were certainly not the 
living and central interests of my life.
<P>
I had to conceal my wider outlook to a certain extent--from the 
masters even more than from the boys.  Indeed I only let myself go 
freely with one boy, Britten, my especial chum, the son of the 
Agent-General for East Australia.  We two discovered in a chance 
conversation A PROPOS of a map in the library that we were both of 
us curious why there were Malays in Madagascar, and how the Mecca 
pilgrims came from the East Indies before steamships were available.  
Neither of us had suspected that there was any one at all in the 
school who knew or cared a rap about the Indian Ocean, except as 
water on the way to India.  But Britten had come up through the Suez 
Canal, and his ship had spoken a pilgrim ship on the way.  It gave 
him a startling quality of living knowledge.  From these pilgrims we 
got to a comparative treatment of religions, and from that, by a 
sudden plunge, to entirely sceptical and disrespectful confessions 
concerning Gates' last outbreak of simple piety in School Assembly.  
We became congenial intimates from that hour.
<P>
The discovery of Britten happened to me when we were both in the 
Lower Fifth.  Previously there had been a watertight compartment 
between the books I read and the thoughts they begot on the one hand 
and human intercourse on the other.  Now I really began my higher 
education, and aired and examined and developed in conversation the 
doubts, the ideas, the interpretations that had been forming in my 
mind.  As we were both day-boys with a good deal of control over our 
time we organised walks and expeditions together, and my habit of 
solitary and rather vague prowling gave way to much more definite 
joint enterprises.  I went several times to his house, he was the 
youngest of several brothers, one of whom was a medical student and 
let us assist at the dissection of a cat, and once or twice in 
vacation time he came to Penge, and we went with parcels of 
provisions to do a thorough day in the grounds and galleries of the 
Crystal Palace, ending with the fireworks at close quarters.  We 
went in a river steamboat down to Greenwich, and fired by that made 
an excursion to Margate and back; we explored London docks and 
Bethnal Green Museum, Petticoat Lane and all sorts of out-of-the-way 
places together.
<P>
We confessed shyly to one another a common secret vice, "Phantom 
warfare."  When we walked alone, especially in the country, we had 
both developed the same practice of fighting an imaginary battle 
about us as we walked.  As we went along we were generals, and our 
attacks pushed along on either side, crouching and gathering behind 
hedges, cresting ridges, occupying copses, rushing open spaces, 
fighting from house to house.  The hillsides about Penge were 
honeycombed in my imagination with the pits and trenches I had 
created to cheek a victorious invader coming out of Surrey.  For him 
West Kensington was chiefly important as the scene of a desperate 
and successful last stand of insurrectionary troops (who had seized 
the Navy, the Bank and other advantages) against a royalist army--
reinforced by Germans--advancing for reasons best known to 
themselves by way of Harrow and Ealing.  It is a secret and solitary 
game, as we found when we tried to play it together.  We made a 
success of that only once.  All the way down to Margate we schemed 
defences and assailed and fought them as we came back against the 
sunset.  Afterwards we recapitulated all that conflict by means of a 
large scale map of the Thames and little paper ironclads in plan cut 
out of paper.
<P>
A subsequent revival of these imaginings was brought about by 
Britten's luck in getting, through a friend of his father's, 
admission for us both to the spectacle of volunteer officers 
fighting the war game in Caxton Hall.  We developed a war game of 
our own at Britten's home with nearly a couple of hundred lead 
soldiers, some excellent spring cannons that shot hard and true at 
six yards, hills of books and a constantly elaborated set of rules.  
For some months that occupied an immense proportion of our leisure.  
Some of our battles lasted several days.  We kept the game a 
profound secret from the other fellows.  They would not have 
understood.
<P>
And we also began, it was certainly before we were sixteen, to 
write, for the sake of writing.  We liked writing.  We had 
discovered Lamb and the best of the middle articles in such weeklies 
as the SATURDAY GAZETTE, and we imitated them.  Our minds were full 
of dim uncertain things we wanted to drag out into the light of 
expression.  Britten had got hold of IN MEMORIAM, and I had 
disinterred Pope's ESSAY ON MAN and RABBI BEN EZRA, and these things 
had set our theological and cosmic solicitudes talking.  I was 
somewhere between sixteen and eighteen, I know, when he and I walked 
along the Thames Embankment confessing shamefully to one another 
that we had never read Lucretius.  We thought every one who mattered 
had read Lucretius.
<P>
When I was nearly sixteen my mother was taken ill very suddenly, and 
died of some perplexing complaint that involved a post-mortem 
examination; it was, I think, the trouble that has since those days 
been recognised as appendicitis.  This led to a considerable change 
in my circumstances; the house at Penge was given up, and my 
Staffordshire uncle arranged for me to lodge during school terms 
with a needy solicitor and his wife in Vicars Street, S. W., about a 
mile and a half from the school.  So it was I came right into 
London; I had almost two years of London before I went to Cambridge.
<P>
Tehose were our great days together.  Afterwards we were torn apart; 
Britten went to Oxford, and our circumstances never afterwards threw 
us continuously together until the days of the BLUE WEEKLY.
<P>
As boys, we walked together, read and discussed the same books, 
pursued the same enquiries.  We got a reputation as inseparables and 
the nickname of the Rose and the Lily, for Britten was short and 
thick-set with dark close curling hair and a ruddy Irish type of 
face; I was lean and fair-haired and some inches taller than he.  
Our talk ranged widely and yet had certain very definite 
limitations.  We were amazingly free with politics and religion, we 
went to that little meeting-house of William Morris's at Hammersmith 
and worked out the principles of Socialism pretty thoroughly, and we 
got up the Darwinian theory with the help of Britten's medical-
student brother and the galleries of the Natural History Museum in 
Cromwell Road.  Those wonderful cases on the ground floor 
illustrating mimicry, dimorphism and so forth, were new in our 
times, and we went through them with earnest industry and tried over 
our Darwinism in the light of that.  Such topics we did 
exhaustively.  But on the other hand I do not remember any 
discussion whatever of human sex or sexual relationships.  There, in 
spite of intense secret curiosities, our lips were sealed by a 
peculiar shyness.  And I do not believe we ever had occasion either 
of us to use the word "love."  It was not only that we were 
instinctively shy of the subject, but that we were mightily ashamed 
of the extent of our ignorance and uncertainty in these matters.  We 
evaded them elaborately with an assumption of exhaustive knowledge.
<P>
We certainly had no shyness about theology.  We marked the 
emancipation of our spirits from the frightful teachings that had 
oppressed our boyhood, by much indulgence in blasphemous wit.  We 
had a secret literature of irreverent rhymes, and a secret art of 
theological caricature.  Britten's father had delighted his family 
by reading aloud from Dr. Richard Garnett's TWILIGHT OF THE GODS, 
and Britten conveyed the precious volume to me.  That and the BAB 
BALLADS were the inspiration of some of our earliest lucubrations.
<P>
For an imaginative boy the first experience of writing is like a 
tiger's first taste of blood, and our literary flowerings led very 
directly to the revival of the school magazine, which had been 
comatose for some years.  But there we came upon a disappointment.
<P>
<P>

<P>
In that revival we associated certain other of the Sixth Form boys, 
and notably one for whom our enterprise was to lay the foundations 
of a career that has ended in the House of Lords, Arthur Cossington, 
now Lord Paddockhurst.  Cossington was at that time a rather heavy, 
rather good-looking boy who was chiefly eminent in cricket, an 
outsider even as we were and preoccupied no doubt, had we been 
sufficiently detached to observe him, with private imaginings very 
much of the same quality and spirit as our own.  He was, we were 
inclined to think, rather a sentimentalist, rather a poseur, he 
affected a concise emphatic styl, played chess very well, betrayed 
a belief in will-power, and earned Britten's secret hostility, 
Britten being a sloven, by the invariable neatness of his collars 
and ties.  He came into our magazine with a vigour that we found 
extremely surprising and unwelcome.
<P>
Britten and I had wanted to write.  We had indeed figured our 
project modestly as a manuscript magazine of satirical, liberal and 
brilliant literature by which in some rather inexplicable way the 
vague tumult of ideas that teemed within us was to find form and 
expression; Cossington, it was manifest from the outset, wanted 
neither to write nor writing, but a magazine.  I remember the 
inaugural meeting in Shoesmith major's study--we had had great 
trouble in getting it together--and how effectually Cossington 
bolted with the proposal.
<P>
"I think we fellows ought to run a magazine," said Cossington.  "The 
school used to have one.  A school like this ought to have a 
magazine."
<P>
"The last one died in '84," said Shoesmith from the hearthrug.  
"Called the OBSERVER.  Rot rather."
<P>
"Bad title," said Cossington.
<P>
"There was a TATLER before that," said Britten, sitting on the 
writing table at the window that was closed to deaden the cries of 
the Lower School at play, and clashing his boots together.
<P>
"We want something suggestive of City Merchants."
<P>
"CITY MERCHANDIZE," said Britten.
<P>
"Too fanciful.  What of ARVONIAN?  Richard Arvon was our founder, 
and it seems almost a duty--"
<P>
"They call them all -usians or -onians," said Britten.
<P>
"I like CITY MERCHANDIZE," I said.  "We could probably find a 
quotation to suggest--oh! mixed good things."
<P>
Cossington regarded me abstractedly.
<P>
Don't want to put the accent on the City, do we?" said Shoesmith, 
who had a feeling for county families, and Naylor supported him by a 
murmur of approval.
<P>
"We ought to call it the ARVONIAN," decided Cossington, "and we 
might very well have underneath, 'With which is incorporated the 
OBSERVER.'  That picks up the old traditions, makes an appeal to old 
boys and all that, and it gives us something to print under the 
title."
<P>
I still held out for CITY MERCHANDIZE, which had taken my fancy.  
"Some of the chaps' people won't like it," said Naylor, "certain not 
to.  And it sounds Rum."
<P>
"Sounds Weird," said a boy who had not hitherto spoken.
<P>
"We aren't going to do anything Queer," said Shoesmith, pointedly 
not looking at Britten.
<P>
The question of the title had manifestly gone against us.  "Oh! HAVE 
it ARVONIAN," I said.
<P>
"And next, what size shall we have?" said Cossington.
<P>
"Something like MACMILLAN'S MAGAZINE--or LONGMANS'; LONGMANS' is 
better because it has a whole page, not columns.  It makes no end of 
difference to one's effects."
<P>
"What effects?" asked Shoesmith abruptly.
<P>
"Oh! a pause or a white line or anything.  You've got to write 
closer for a double column.  It's nuggetty.  You can't get a swing 
on your prose."  I had discussed this thoroughly with Britten.
<P>
"If the fellows are going to write--" began Britten.
<P>
"We ought to keep off fine writing," said Shoesmith.  "It's cheek.  
I vote we don't have any."
<P>
"We sha'n't get any," said Cossington, and then as an olive branch 
to me, "unless Remington does a bit.  Or Britten.  But it's no good 
making too much space for it."
<P>
"We ought to be very careful about the writing," said Shoesmith.   
"We don't want to give ourselves away."
<P>
"I vote we ask old Topham to see us through," said Naylor.
<P>
Britten groaned aloud and every one regarded him.  "Greek epigrams 
on the fellows' names," he said.  " Small beer in ancient bottles.  
Let's get a stuffed broody hen to SIT on the magazine."
<P>
"We might do worse than a Greek epigram," said Cossington.  "One in 
each number.  It--it impresses parents and keeps up our classieal 
tradition.  And the masters CAN help.  We don't want to antagonise 
them.  Of course--we've got to dcpartmentalise.  Writing is only one 
section of the thing.  The ARVONIAN has to stand for the school.  
There's questions of space and questions of expense.  We can't turn 
out a great chunk of printed prose like--like wet cold toast and 
call it a magazine."
<P>
Britten writhed, appreciating the image.
<P>
"There's to be a section of sports.  YOU must do that."
<P>
"I'm not going to do any fine writing," said Shoesmith.
<P>
"What you've got to do is just to list all the chaps and put a note 
to their play:--'Naylor minor must pass more.  Football isn't the 
place for extreme individualism.'  'Ammersham shapes well as half-
back.'  Things like that."
<P>
"I could do that all right," said Shoesmith, brightening and 
manifestly hecoming pregnant with judgments.
<P>
"One great thing about a magazine of this sort," said Cossington, 
"is to mention just as many names as you can in each number.  It 
keeps the interest alive.  Chaps will turn it over looking for their 
own little bit.  Then it all lights up for them."
<P>
"Do you want any reports of matches?" Shoesmith broke from his 
meditation.
<P>
"Rather.  With comments."
<P>
"Naylor surpassed himself and negotiated the lemon safely home," 
said Shoesmith.
<P>
"Shut it," said Naylor modestly.
<P>
"Exactly," said Cossington.  "That gives us three features," 
touching them off on his fingers, "Epigram, Literary Section, 
Sports.  Then we want a section to shove anything into, a joke, a 
notice of anything that's going on.  So on.  Our Note Book."
<P>
"Oh, Hell!" said Britten, and clashed his boots, to the silent 
disapproval of every one.
<P>
"Then we want an editorial."
<P>
"A WHAT?" cried Britten, with a note of real terror in his voice.
<P>
"Well, don't we?  Unless we have our Note Book to begin on the front 
page.  It gives a scrappy effect to do that.  We want something 
manly and straightforward and a bit thoughtful, about Patriotism, 
say, or ESPRIT DE CORPS, or After-Life."
<P>
I looked at Britten.  Hitherto we had not considered Cossington 
mattered very much in the world.
<P>
He went over us as a motor-car goes over a dog.  There was a sort of 
energy about him, a new sort of energy to us; we had never realised 
that anything of the sort existed in the world.  We were hopelessly 
at a disadvantage.  Almost instantly we had developed a clear and 
detailed vision of a magazine made up of everything that was most 
acceptable in the magazines that flourished in the adult world about 
us, and had determined to make it a success.  He had by a kind of 
instinct, as it were, synthetically plagiarised every successful 
magazine and breathed into this dusty mixture the breath of life.  
He was elected at his own suggestion managing director, with the 
earnest support of Shoesmith and Naylor, and conducted the magazine 
so successfully and brilliantly that he even got a whole back page 
of advertisements from the big sports shop in Holborn, and made the 
printers pay at the same rate for a notice of certain books of their 
own which they said they had inserted by inadvertency to fill up 
space.  The only literary contribution in the first number was a 
column by Topham in faultless stereotyped English in depreciation of 
some fancied evil called Utilitarian Studies and ending with that 
noble old quotation:--
<P>
<P>
"To the glory that was Greece and the grandeur that was Rome."
<P>
<P>
And Flack crowded us out of number two with a bright little paper on 
the "Humours of Cricket," and the Head himself was profusely 
thoughtful all over the editorial under the heading of "The School 
Chapel; and How it Seems to an Old Boy."
<P>
Britten and I found it difficult to express to each other with any 
grace or precision what we felt about that magazine.
