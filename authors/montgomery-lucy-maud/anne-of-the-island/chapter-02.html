<P>
The following week sped swiftly, crowded with innumerable "last things,"
as Anne called them.  Good-bye calls had to be made and received, being
pleasant or otherwise, according to whether callers and called-upon were
heartily in sympathy with Anne's hopes, or thought she was too much
puffed-up over going to college and that it was their duty to "take her
down a peg or two."
<P>
The A.V.I.S. gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert
one evening at the home of Josie Pye, choosing that place, partly
because Mr. Pye's house was large and convenient, partly because
it was strongly suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing
to do with the affair if their offer of the house for the party
was not accepted.  It was a very pleasant little time, for the
Pye girls were gracious, and said and did nothing to mar the
harmony of the occasion -- which was not according to their wont.
Josie was unusually amiable -- so much so that she even remarked
condescendingly to Anne,
<P>
"Your new dress is rather becoming to you, Anne.  Really, you
look ALMOST PRETTY in it."
<P>
"How kind of you to say so," responded Anne, with dancing eyes.
Her sense of humor was developing, and the speeches that would
have hurt her at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement
now.  Josie suspected that Anne was laughing at her behind those
wicked eyes; but she contented herself with whispering to Gertie,
as they went downstairs, that Anne Shirley would put on more airs
than ever now that she was going to college -- you'd see!
<P>
All the "old crowd" was there, full of mirth and zest and
youthful lightheartedness.  Diana Barry, rosy and dimpled,
shadowed by the faithful Fred; Jane Andrews, neat and sensible
and plain; Ruby Gillis, looking her handsomest and brightest in a
cream silk blouse, with red geraniums in her golden hair; Gilbert
Blythe and Charlie Sloane, both trying to keep as near the
elusive Anne as possible; Carrie Sloane, looking pale and
melancholy because, so it was reported, her father would not
allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place; Moody Spurgeon
MacPherson, whose round face and objectionable ears were as round
and objectionable as ever; and Billy Andrews, who sat in a corner all
the evening, chuckled when any one spoke to him, and watched Anne
Shirley with a grin of pleasure on his broad, freckled countenance.
<P>
Anne had known beforehand of the party, but she had not known
that she and Gilbert were, as the founders of the Society, to be
presented with a very complimentary "address" and "tokens of
respect" -- in her case a volume of Shakespeare's plays, in
Gilbert's a fountain pen.  She was so taken by surprise and
pleased by the nice things said in the address, read in Moody
Spurgeon's most solemn and ministerial tones, that the tears
quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes.  She had worked
hard and faithfully for the A.V.I.S., and it warmed the cockles
of her heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely.
And they were all so nice and friendly and jolly -- even the Pye
girls had their merits; at that moment Anne loved all the world.
<P>
She enjoyed the evening tremendously, but the end of it rather
spoiled all.  Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something
sentimental to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit
verandah; and Anne, to punish him, was gracious to Charlie Sloane
and allowed the latter to walk home with her.  She found,
however, that revenge hurts nobody quite so much as the one who
tries to inflict it.  Gilbert walked airily off with Ruby Gillis,
and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as they
loitered along in the still, crisp autumn air.  They were
evidently having the best of good times, while she was horribly
bored by Charlie Sloane, who talked unbrokenly on, and never,
even by accident, said one thing that was worth listening to.
Anne gave an occasional absent "yes" or "no," and thought how
beautiful Ruby had looked that night, how very goggly Charlie's
eyes were in the moonlight -- worse even than by daylight -- and
that the world, somehow, wasn't quite such a nice place as she
had believed it to be earlier in the evening.
<P>
"I'm just tired out -- that is what is the matter with me,"
she said, when she thankfully found herself alone in her own room.
And she honestly believed it was.  But a certain little gush of joy,
as from some secret, unknown spring, bubbled up in her heart
the next evening, when she saw Gilbert striding down through the
Haunted Wood and crossing the old log bridge with that firm,
quick step of his.  So Gilbert was not going to spend this last
evening with Ruby Gillis after all!
<P>
"You look tired, Anne," he said.
<P>
"I am tired, and, worse than that, I'm disgruntled.  I'm tired
because I've been packing my trunk and sewing all day.  But I'm
disgruntled because six women have been here to say good-bye to
me, and every one of the six managed to say something that seemed
to take the color right out of life and leave it as gray and
dismal and cheerless as a November morning."
<P>
"Spiteful old cats!" was Gilbert's elegant comment.
<P>
"Oh, no, they weren't," said Anne seriously.  "That is just the
trouble.  If they had been spiteful cats I wouldn't have minded
them.  But they are all nice, kind, motherly souls, who like me
and whom I like, and that is why what they said, or hinted, had
such undue weight with me.  They let me see they thought I was
crazy going to Redmond and trying to take a B.A., and ever since
I've been wondering if I am.  Mrs. Peter Sloane sighed and said
she hoped my strength would hold out till I got through; and at
once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the
end of my third year; Mrs. Eben Wright said it must cost an awful
lot to put in four years at Redmond; and I felt all over me that
it was unpardonable of me to squander Marilla's money and my own
on such a folly.  Mrs. Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldn't let
college spoil me, as it did some people; and I felt in my bones
that the end of my four Redmond years would see me a most
insufferable creature, thinking I knew it all, and looking down
on everything and everybody in Avonlea; Mrs. Elisha Wright said
she understood that Redmond girls, especially those who belonged
to Kingsport, were 'dreadful dressy and stuck-up,' and she
guessed I wouldn't feel much at home among them; and I saw
myself, a snubbed, dowdy, humiliated country girl, shuffling
through Redmond's classic halls in coppertoned boots."
<P>
Anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled.  With her sensitive
nature all disapproval had weight, even the disapproval of those
for whose opinions she had scant respect.  For the time being life
was savorless, and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle.
<P>
"You surely don't care for what they said," protested Gilbert.
"You know exactly how narrow their outlook on life is, excellent
creatures though they are.  To do anything THEY have never done
is anathema maranatha.  You are the first Avonlea girl who has
ever gone to college; and you know that all pioneers are considered
to be afflicted with moonstruck madness."
<P>
"Oh, I know.  But FEELING is so different from KNOWING.  My common
sense tells me all you can say, but there are times when common
sense has no power over me.  Common nonsense takes possession of
my soul.  Really, after Mrs. Elisha went away I hardly had the
heart to finish packing."
<P>
"You're just tired, Anne.  Come, forget it all and take a walk
with me -- a ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh.
There should be something there I want to show you."
<P>
"Should be!  Don't you know if it is there?"
<P>
"No.  I only know it should be, from something I saw there in spring.
Come on.  We'll pretend we are two children again and we'll go the
way of the wind."
<P>
They started gaily off.  Anne, remembering the unpleasantness of
the preceding evening, was very nice to Gilbert; and Gilbert, who
was learning wisdom, took care to be nothing save the schoolboy
comrade again.  Mrs. Lynde and Marilla watched them from the
kitchen window.
<P>
"That'll be a match some day," Mrs. Lynde said approvingly.
<P>
Marilla winced slightly.  In her heart she hoped it would, but it
went against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in Mrs. Lynde's
gossipy matter-of-fact way.
<P>
"They're only children yet," she said shortly.
<P>
Mrs. Lynde laughed good-naturedly.
<P>
"Anne is eighteen; I was married when I was that age.  We old
folks, Marilla, are too much given to thinking children never
grow up, that's what.  Anne is a young woman and Gilbert's a man,
and he worships the ground she walks on, as any one can see.
He's a fine fellow, and Anne can't do better.  I hope she won't
get any romantic nonsense into her head at Redmond.  I don't
approve of them coeducational places and never did, that's what.
I don't believe," concluded Mrs. Lynde solemnly, "that the
students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt."
<P>
"They must study a little," said Marilla, with a smile.
<P>
"Precious little," sniffed Mrs. Rachel.  "However, I think Anne
will.  She never was flirtatious.  But she doesn't appreciate
Gilbert at his full value, that's what.  Oh, I know girls!
Charlie Sloane is wild about her, too, but I'd never advise her
to marry a Sloane.  The Sloanes are good, honest, respectable people,
of course.  But when all's said and done, they're SLOANES."
<P>
Marilla nodded.  To an outsider, the statement that Sloanes were
Sloanes might not be very illuminating, but she understood.
Every village has such a family; good, honest, respectable people
they may be, but SLOANES they are and must ever remain, though
they speak with the tongues of men and angels.
<P>
Gilbert and Anne, happily unconscious that their future was thus
being settled by Mrs. Rachel, were sauntering through the shadows
of the Haunted Wood.  Beyond, the harvest hills were basking in
an amber sunset radiance, under a pale, aerial sky of rose and blue.
The distant spruce groves were burnished bronze, and their long shadows
barred the upland meadows.  But around them a little wind sang among
the fir tassels, and in it there was the note of autumn.
<P>
"This wood really is haunted now -- by old memories," said Anne,
stooping to gather a spray of ferns, bleached to waxen whiteness
by frost.  "It seems to me that the little girls Diana and I used
to be play here still, and sit by the Dryad's Bubble in the
twilights, trysting with the ghosts.  Do you know, I can never go
up this path in the dusk without feeling a bit of the old fright
and shiver?  There was one especially horrifying phantom which we
created -- the ghost of the murdered child that crept up behind
you and laid cold fingers on yours.  I confess that, to this day,
I cannot help fancying its little, furtive footsteps behind me
when I come here after nightfall.  I'm not afraid of the White
Lady or the headless man or the skeletons, but I wish I had never
imagined that baby's ghost into existence.  How angry Marilla
and Mrs. Barry were over that affair," concluded Anne, with
reminiscent laughter.
<P>
The woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas,
threaded with gossamers.  Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces
and a maple-fringed, sun-warm valley they found the "something"
Gilbert was looking for.
<P>
"Ah, here it is," he said with satisfaction.
<P>
"An apple tree -- and away back here!" exclaimed Anne delightedly.
<P>
"Yes, a veritable apple-bearing apple tree, too, here in the very
midst of pines and beeches, a mile away from any orchard.  I was
here one day last spring and found it, all white with blossom.
So I resolved I'd come again in the fall and see if it had been
apples.  See, it's loaded.  They look good, too -- tawny as
russets but with a dusky red cheek.  Most wild seedlings are
green and uninviting."
<P>
"I suppose it sprang years ago from some chance-sown seed," said
Anne dreamily."  And how it has grown and flourished and held its
own here all alone among aliens, the brave determined thing!"
<P>
"Here's a fallen tree with a cushion of moss.  Sit down, Anne --
it will serve for a woodland throne.  I'll climb for some apples.
They all grow high -- the tree had to reach up to the sunlight."
<P>
The apples proved to be delicious.  Under the tawny skin was a
white, white flesh, faintly veined with red; and, besides their
own proper apple taste, they had a certain wild, delightful tang
no orchard-grown apple ever possessed.
<P>
"The fatal apple of Eden couldn't have had a rarer flavor,"
commented Anne.  "But it's time we were going home.  See, it was
twilight three minutes ago and now it's moonlight.  What a pity
we couldn't have caught the moment of transformation.  But such
moments never are caught, I suppose."
<P>
"Let's go back around the marsh and home by way of Lover's Lane.
Do you feel as disgruntled now as when you started out, Anne?"
<P>
"Not I.  Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul.  I feel
that I shall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there."
<P>
"And after those four years -- what?"
<P>
"Oh, there's another bend in the road at their end," answered
Anne lightly.  "I've no idea what may be around it -- I don't
want to have.  It's nicer not to know."
<P>
Lover's Lane was a dear place that night, still and mysteriously
dim in the pale radiance of the moonlight.  They loitered through
it in a pleasant chummy silence, neither caring to talk.
<P>
"If Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and
simple everything would be," reflected Anne.
<P>
Gilbert was looking at Anne, as she walked along.  In her light dress,
with her slender delicacy, she made him think of a white iris.
<P>
"I wonder if I can ever make her care for me," he thought, with a
pang of self-destruct.
