<P>
THE three vessels had been sweeping swiftly westwards, the cog
still well to the front, although the galleys were slowly drawing
in upon either quarter.  To the left was a hard skyline unbroken
by a sail.  The island already lay like a cloud behind them,
while right in front was St. Alban's Head, with Portland looming
mistily in the farthest distance.  Alleyne stood by the tiller,
looking backwards, the fresh wind full in his teeth, the crisp
winter air tingling on his face and blowing his yellow curls from
under his bassinet.  His cheeks were flushed and his eyes
shining, for the blood of a hundred fighting Saxon ancestors was
beginning to stir in his veins.
<P>
"What was that?" he asked, as a hissing, sharp-drawn voice seemed
to whisper in his ear.  The steersman smiled, and pointed with
his foot to where a short heavy cross-bow quarrel stuck quivering
in the boards.  At the same instant the man stumbled forward upon
his knees, and lay lifeless upon the deck, a blood-stained
feather jutting out from his back.  As Alleyne stooped to raise
him, the air seemed to be alive with the sharp zip-zip of the
bolts, and he could hear them pattering on the deck like apples
at a tree-shaking.
<P>
"Raise two more mantlets by the poop lanthorn," said Sir Nigel
quietly.
<P>
"And another man to the tiller," cried the master-shipman.
<P>
"Keep them in play, Aylward, with ten of your men," the knight
continued.  "And let ten of Sir Oliver's bowmen do as much for
the Genoese.  I have no mind as yet to show them how much they
have to fear from us."
<P>
Ten picked shots under Aylward stood in line across the broad
deck, and it was a lesson to the young squires who had seen
nothing of war to note how orderly and how cool were these old
soldiers, how quick the command, and how prompt the carrying out,
ten moving like one.  Their comrades crouched beneath the
bulwarks, with many a rough jest and many a scrap of criticism or
advice.  "Higher, Wat, higher!" "Put thy body into it, Will!"
"Forget not the wind, Hal!" So ran the muttered chorus, while
high above it rose the sharp avanging of the strings, the hiss of
the shafts, and the short "Draw your arrow! Nick your arrow!
Shoot wholly together!" from the master-bowman.
<P>
And now both mangonels were at work from the galleys, but so
covered and protected that, save at the moment of discharge, no
glimpse could be caught of them.  A huge brown rock from the
Genoese sang over their heads, and plunged sullenly into the
slope of a wave.  Another from the Norman whizzed into the waist,
broke the back of a horse, and crashed its way through the side
of the vessel.  Two others, flying together, tore a great gap in
the St. Christopher upon the sail, and brushed three of Sir
Oliver's men-at-arms from the forecastle.  The master-shipman
looked at the knight with a troubled face.
<P>
"They keep their distance from us," said he.  "Our archery is
over-good, and they will not close.  What defence can we make
against the stones?"
<P>
"I think I may trick them," the knight answered cheerfully, and
passed his order to the archers.  Instantly five of them threw up
their hands and fell prostrate upon the deck.  One had already
been slain by a bolt, so that there were but four upon their
feet.
<P>
"That should give them heart," said Sir Nigel, eyeing the
galleys, which crept along on either side, with a slow, measured
swing of their great oars, the water swirling and foaming under
their sharp stems.
<P>
"They still hold aloof," cried Hawtayne.
<P>
"Then down with two more," shouted their leader.  "That will do.
Ma foi! but they come to our lure like chicks to the fowler.  To
your arms, men!  The pennon behind me, and the squires round the
pennon.  Stand fast with the anchors in the waist, and be ready
for a cast.  Now blow out the trumpets, and may God's benison be
with the honest men!"
<P>
As he spoke a roar of voices and a roll of drums came from either
galley, and the water was lashed into spray by the hurried beat
of a hundred oars.  Down they swooped, one on the right, one on
the left, the sides and shrouds black with men and bristling with
weapons.  In heavy clusters they hung upon the forecastle all
ready for a spring-faces white, faces brown, faces yellow, and
faces black, fair Norsemen, swarthy Italians, fierce rovers from
the Levant, and fiery Moors from the Barbary States, of all hues
and countries, and marked solely by the common stamp of a wild-
beast ferocity.  Rasping up on either side, with oars trailing to
save them from snapping, they poured in a living torrent with
horrid yell and shrill whoop upon the defenceless merchantman.
<P>
But wilder yet was the cry, and shriller still the scream, when
there rose up from the shadow of those silent bulwarks the long
lines of the English bowmen, and the arrows whizzed in a deadly
sleet among the unprepared masses upon the pirate decks.  From
the higher sides of the cog the bowmen could shoot straight down,
at a range which was so short as to enable a cloth-yard shaft to
pierce through mail-coats or to transfix a shield, though it were
an inch thick of toughened wood.  One moment Alleyne saw the
galley's poop crowded with rushing figures, waving arms, exultant
faces; the next it was a blood-smeared shambles, with bodies
piled three deep upon each other, the living cowering behind the
dead to shelter themselves from that sudden storm-blast of
death.  On either side the seamen whom Sir Nigel had chosen for
the purpose had cast their anchors over the side of the galleys,
so that the three vessels, locked in an iron grip, lurched
heavily forward upon the swell.
<P>
And now set in a fell and fierce fight, one of a thousand of
which no chronicler has spoken and no poet sung.  Through all the
centuries and over all those southern waters nameless men have
fought in nameless places, their sole monuments a protected coast
and an unravaged country-side.
<P>
Fore and aft the archers had cleared the galleys' decks, but from
either side the rovers had poured down into the waist, where the
seamen and bowmen were pushed back and so mingled with their foes
that it was impossible for their comrades above to draw string to
help them.  It was a wild chaos where axe and sword rose and
fell, while Englishman, Norman, and Italian staggered and reeled
on a deck which was cumbered with bodies and slippery with blood.
The clang of blows, the cries of the stricken, the short, deep
shout of the islanders, and the fierce whoops of the rovers, rose
together in a deafening tumult, while the breath of the panting
men went up in the wintry air like the smoke from a furnace.  The
giant Tete-noire, towering above his fellows and clad from head
to foot in plate of proof, led on his boarders, waving a huge
mace in the air, with which he struck to the deck every man who
approached him.  On the other side, Spade-beard, a dwarf in
height, but of great breadth of shoulder and length of arm, had
cut a road almost to the mast, with three-score Genoese men-at-
arms close at his heels.  Between these two formidable assailants
the seamen were being slowly wedged more closely together, until
they stood back to back under the mast with the rovers raging
upon every side of them.
<P>
But help was close at hand.  Sir Oliver Buttesthorn with his
men-at-arms had swarmed down from the forecastle, while Sir
Nigel, with his three squires, Black Simon, Aylward, Hordle John,
and a score more, threw themselves from the poop and hurled
themselves into the thickest of the fight.  Alleyne, as in duty
bound, kept his eyes fixed ever on his lord and pressed forward
close at his heels.  Often had he heard of Sir Nigel's prowess
and skill with all knightly weapons, but all the tales that had
reached his ears fell far short of the real quickness and
coolness of the man.  It was as if the devil was in him, for he
sprang here and sprang there, now thrusting and now cutting,
catching blows on his shield, turning them with his blade,
stooping under the swing of an axe, springing over the sweep of a
sword, so swift and so erratic that the man who braced himself
for a blow at him might find him six paces off ere he could bring
it down.  Three pirates had fallen before him, and he had wounded
Spade-beard in the neck, when the Norman giant sprang at him from
the side with a slashing blow from his deadly mace.  Sir Nigel
stooped to avoid it, and at the same instant turned a thrust from
the Genoese swordsman, but, his foot slipping in a pool of blood,
he fell heavily to the ground.  Alleyne sprang in front of the
Norman, but his sword was shattered and he himself beaten to the
ground by a second blow from the ponderous weapon.  Ere the
pirate chief could repeat it, however, John's iron grip fell upon
his wrist, and he found that for once he was in the hands of a
stronger man than himself.
<P>
Fiercely he strove to disengage his weapon, but Hordle John bent
his arm slowly back until, with a sharp crack, like a breaking
stave, it turned limp in his grasp, and the mace dropped from the
nerveless fingers.  In vain he tried to pluck it up with the
other hand.  Back and back still his foeman bent him, until, with
a roar of pain and of fury, the giant clanged his full length
upon the boards, while the glimmer of a knife before the bars of
his helmet warned him that short would be his shrift if he moved.
<P>
Cowed and disheartened by the loss of their leader, the Normans
had given back and were now streaming over the bulwarks on to
their own galley, dropping a dozen at a time on to her deck, But
the anchor still held them in its crooked claw, and Sir Oliver
with fifty men was hard upon their heels.  Now, too, the archers
had room to draw their bows once more, and great stones from the
yard of the cog came thundering and crashing among the flying
rovers.  Here and there they rushed with wild screams and curses,
diving under the sail, crouching behind booms, huddling into
corners like rabbits when the ferrets are upon them, as helpless
and as hopeless.  They were stern days, and if the honest
soldier, too poor for a ransom, had no prospect of mercy upon the
battle-field, what ruth was there for sea robbers, the enemies of
humankind, taken in the very deed, with proofs of their crimes
still swinging upon their yard-arm.
<P>
But the fight had taken a new and a strange turn upon the other
side.  Spade-beard and his men had given slowly back, hard
pressed by Sir Nigel, Aylward, Black Simon, and the poop-guard.
Foot by foot the Italian had retreated, his armor running blood
at every joint, his shield split, his crest shorn, his voice
fallen away to a mere gasping and croaking.  Yet he faced his
foemen with dauntless courage, dashing in, springing back, sure-
footed, steady-handed, with a point which seemed to menace three
at once.  Beaten back on to the deck of his own vessel, and
closely followed by a dozen Englishmen, he disengaged himself
from them, ran swiftly down the deck, sprang back into the cog
once more, cut the rope which held the anchor, and was back in an
instant among his crossbow-men.  At the same time the Genoese
sailors thrust with their oars against the side of the cog, and a
rapidly widening rift appeared between the two vessels.
<P>
"By St. George!" cried Ford, "we are cut off from Sir Nigel."
<P>
"He is lost," gasped Terlake.  "Come, let us spring for it." The
two youths jumped with all their strength to reach the departing
galley.  Ford's feet reached the edge of the bulwarks, and his
hand clutching a rope he swung himself on board.  Terlake fell
short, crashed in among the oars, and bounded off into the sea.
Alleyne, staggering to the side, was about to hurl himself after
him, but Hordle John dragged him back by the girdle.
<P>
"You can scarce stand, lad, far less jump," said he.  "See how
the blood rips from your bassinet."
<P>
"My place is by the flag," cried Alleyne, vainly struggling to
break from the other's hold.
<P>
"Bide here, man.  You would need wings ere you could reach Sir
Nigel's side."
<P>
The vessels were indeed so far apart now that the Genoese could
use the full sweep of their oars, and draw away rapidly from the
cog.
<P>
"My God, but it is a noble fight!" shouted big John, clapping his
hands.  "They have cleared the poop, and they spring into the
waist.  Well struck, my lord!  Well struck, Aylward!  See to
Black Simon, how he storms among the shipmen!  But this Spade-
beard is a gallant warrior.  He rallies his men upon the
forecastle.  He hath slain an archer.  Ha! my lord is upon him.
Look to it, Alleyne!  See to the whirl and glitter of it!"
<P>
"By heaven, Sir Nigel is down!" cried the squire.
<P>
"Up!" roared John.  "It was but a feint.  He bears him back.  He
drives him to the side.  Ah, by Our Lady, his sword is through
him!  They cry for mercy.  Down goes the red cross, and up
springs Simon with the scarlet roses!"
<P>
The death of the Genoese leader did indeed bring the resistance
to an end.  Amid a thunder of cheering from cog and from galleys
the forked pennon fluttered upon the forecastle, and the galley,
sweeping round, came slowly back, as the slaves who rowed it
learned the wishes of their new masters.
<P>
The two knights had come aboard the cog, and the grapplings
having been thrown off, the three vessels now moved abreast
through all the storm and rush of the fight Alleyne had been
aware of the voice of Goodwin Hawtayne, the master-shipman, with
his constant "Hale the bowline!  Veer the sheet!" and strange it
was to him to see how swiftly the blood-stained sailors turned
from the strife to the ropes and back.  Now the cog's head was
turned Francewards, and the shipman walked the deck, a peaceful
master-mariner once more.
<P>
There is sad scath done to the cog, Sir Nigel," said he.  "Here
is a hole in the side two ells across, the sail split through the
centre, and the wood as bare as a friar's poll.  In good sooth, I
know not what I shall say to Master Witherton when I see the
Itchen once more."
<P>
"By St. Paul! it would be a very sorry thing if we suffered you
to be the worse of this day's work," said Sir Nigel.  "You shall
take these galleys back with you, and Master Witherton may sell
them.  Then from the moneys he shall take as much as may make
good the damage, and the rest he shall keep until our home-
coming, when every man shall have his share.  An image of silver
fifteen inches high I have vowed to the Virgin, to be placed in
her chapel within the Priory, for that she was pleased to allow
me to come upon this Spade-beard, who seemed to me from what I
have seen of him to be a very sprightly and valiant gentleman.
But how fares it with you, Edricson?"
<P>
"It is nothing, my fair lord," said Alleyne, who had now loosened
his bassinet, which was cracked across by the Norman's blow.
Even as he spoke, however, his head swirled round, and he fell to
the deck with the blood gushing from his nose and mouth.
<P>
"He will come to anon," said the knight, stooping over him and
passing his fingers through his hair.  "I have lost one very
valiant and gentle squire this day.  I can ill afford to lose
another.  How many men have fallen?"
<P>
"I have pricked off the tally," said Aylward, who had come aboard
with his lord.  "There are seven of the Winchester men, eleven
seamen, your squire, young Master Terlake, and nine archers."
<P>
"And of the others?"
<P>
"They are all dead--save only the Norman knight who stands behind
you.  What would you that we should do with him?"
<P>
"He must hang on his own yard," said Sir Nigel.  "It was my vow
and must be done."
<P>
The pirate leader had stood by the bulwarks, a cord round his
arms, and two stout archers on either side.  At Sir Nigel's words
he started violently, and his swarthy features blanched to a
livid gray.
<P>
"How, Sir Knight?" he cried in broken English.  "Que ditesvous?
To hang, le mort du chien!  To hang!"
<P>
"It is my vow," said Sir Nigel shortly.  "From what I hear, you
thought little enough of hanging others."
<P>
"Peasants, base roturiers," cried the other.  "It is their
fitting death.  Mais Le Seigneur d'Andelys, avec le sang des rois
dans ses veins!  C'est incroyable!"
<P>
Sir Nigel turned upon his heel, while two seamen cast a noose
over the pirate's neck.  At the touch of the cord he snapped the
bonds which bound him, dashed one of the archers to the deck, and
seizing the other round the waist sprang with him into the sea.
<P>
"By my hilt, he is gone!" cried Aylward, rushing to the side.
"They have sunk together like a stone."
<P>
"I am right glad of it," answered Sir Nigel; "for though it was
against my vow to loose him, I deem that he has carried himself
like a very gentle and debonnaire cavalier."
