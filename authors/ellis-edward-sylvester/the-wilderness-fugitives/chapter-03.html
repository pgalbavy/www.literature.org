<p>Both supposed that they heard the footsteps of Lena-Wingo and
Jo Minturn; but a habit taught by the hard experience of the last
few days caused them to cease speaking and to listen. Only a second
was needed to tell them that strangers were approaching them,
although, fortunately they were not heading in a direct line for
the place where the lovers were sitting. Had it been otherwise,
it is hard to see how they could have escaped observation. The
men were issuing from the wood and making for the shore of the
river, aiming at a point a few yards above where Ned and Rosa
were stationed. They were walking at a leisurely gait, evidently
with no suspicion that any white persons were within earshot.
Judging from the sound of feet upon the leaves, a half dozen persons
were proceeding without any caution at all, talking as freely
as if together at their own homes.</p>

<p>The feelings of Rosa Minturn, when she recognized the voice of
the Tory colonel, Butler, may be imagined. He was accompanied
by another white man, probably one of his officers, and several
Indians, and he was talking more freely. In the stillness of the
summer night, while they were so close at hand, it was as easy
to distinguish every word uttered as if the speech was intended
for the ears of the eavesdroppers.</p>

<p>"We have heard so much of the smartness of that Mohawk scout
that I began to think there was something in him," said the principal
member of the party, Rosa identifying him as the detested Butler.
"But I have never seen anything myself that showed up very well
on his part. Here he is on this side of the Susquehanna, when
he ought to have been at Wilkesbarre before daylight this morning."</p>

<p>"We ought to have been there before that time, even," replied
his companion. "I am sure we could have played the deuce with
that place, a confounded sight better than with Wyoming, for they
were so scared that they were on the run and that's just the time
to strike, you know, colonel."</p>

<p>"Yes; we might have done something if we had gone over at once,
but it was some time before we learned what was going on."</p>

<p>"I hear they are not much better yet, and it seems to me that
it is not too late to slip our men across and clean 'em out."</p>

<p>But Colonel Butler was too wily to consent to any such project,
although there was reason to believe that it might have succeeded,
even though deferred till that rather late hour.</p>

<p>"It isn't worth our while. There's only one more of the rebels
that I want to lay hands on. Let me get that one and the rest
may go."</p>

<p>"I think I know who it is, colonel."</p>

<p>"No doubt you do," was the prompt reply. "Any one who has heard
me speak within the last twenty-four hours has found it out. I
tell you, captain, that you don't often see as pretty a rebel
as that young Minturn. She slipped off last night because she
found I admired her so much that I couldn't keep my eyes from
her."</p>

<p>"You're right there, colonel, when you speak of her beauty, for
I have never seen one that could surpass her; I wonder that she
don't turn the heads of all she meets. Perhaps she does, though,
and, if you hadn't foreclosed there, I would be tempted to make
a claim myself."</p>

<p>"It will be dangerous for any man to interfere with me."</p>

<p>The individual whom he addressed as a captain was heard to laugh
at the words of his superior officer, and he replied:</p>

<p>"I am sure there is no fear of my trying to intrude myself in
that direction, for I am opposed to the thing on principle."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that," replied the colonel, the party having halted
on the edge of the river, as if awaiting the coming of some one.
"Of course I had no reference to <em>you</em> when I spoke, but
I feel especially angry toward Red Jack, or Lena-Wingo, and I
will give a good deal for his scalp. He has played the mischief
with our plans more than once, and now, when everything is going
along just as I want it to, he comes in and walks off with the
prize."</p>

<p>"But don't you suppose he was set up to do it?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; and Colonel Denison was the man who put it into his
head. I can see it all now, though I didn't suspect it at the
time."</p>

<p>"Why don't you shoot him?"</p>

<p>"I was mad enough to do that; and I believe that if I had met
him last night, after the Mohawk escaped so narrowly being cut
through by my sword, I would have done it. But I have thought
the matter over to-day, and made up my mind that it won't pay.
There have already been some things about this Wyoming business
that will make trouble. The Indians ought to have killed every
rebel that wasn't shot down in battle; but they let so many get
away that they will tell all sorts of stories about us, and when
they get to England, they may interfere with some little plans
of my own."[A]</p>

<p>"Well, if you catch the bird that flew away, you can afford to
forgive the well-intended schemes; for when she is once in your
hands, what care you for others? You tell me, colonel, that the
Mohawk did not reach Wilkesbarre with her to-day?"</p>

<p>"No. I had word from there at sunset, and they had not been seen
anywhere in the neighborhood; and, as the Mohawk was observed
on this side of the stream near noon to-day, he must still be
here."</p>

<p>"It has been dark quite awhile, and he may have slipped across
since the sun went down."</p>

<p>"He may, it is true, but it is hardly likely, for the redskins,
as a rule, don't like to do their work until the latter part of
the night. People are too apt to be wide awake in the earlier
portion of the evening; and I am quite sure Red Jack will wait
till beyond midnight before he makes a move in the business."</p>

<p>"The night promises to be dark, so that when he undertakes to
paddle to the other shore, he will be pretty apt to do it."</p>

<p>"It isn't likely we could hinder him, if he was on the watch,
as I suppose he will be," growled Butler, reluctant to concede
to the redskin the skill and prowess that he knew properly belonged
to him. "But I have figured on the supposition that he will get
safely across with the girl, so it won't make much difference
whether he does set foot on the other shore or not. If he <em>does</em>
get there, though, he will find there is more than one lion in
the path between him and Wilkesbarre. I have some of the best
runners and scouts of the Iroquois on the hunt for the couple,
and it is scarcely possible that they can fail. I go across myself,
so as to be ready to take charge of matters the minute a competent
guiding hand is needed."</p>

<p>"And you want me to go with you?"</p>

<p>"You may as well, for matters are dull behind us, and are likely
to stay so for the few days that we shall yet remain. Come along
with us, Captain Bagley, and you will be likely to see some sport
before you get back."</p>

<p>"That reminds me," said the officer, whose name was just spoken,
"that I heard somewhere from some one that this pretty rebel has
an ardent admirer and lover in the person of a young soldier of
Denison's forces, and that he and a brother of the girl fought
like the very deuce in the battle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And was killed?" struck in the Tory, with an eagerness that
showed how intense was his hate for the one who dared to love
with a pure and holy affection her whom he had selected as the
object of his sinful admiration.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say I cannot give you that information," said
the captain, with a half-laugh at the colonel's eagerness. "Both
young men, I have been told, managed to get through the battle
without a scratch, and are probably somewhere in the valley at
this moment&mdash;perhaps trying to help the young lady to get to Wilkesbarre."</p>

<p>Colonel Butler broke in with an imprecation, as he recalled the
accounts he had received of the affair at the settler's house
that same day, and which left no doubt in his mind that the two
young rebels referred to were acting in concert with the Mohawk
scout, Lena-Wingo.</p>

to obtain the honor of knighthood from the King of Great Britain,
but failed.]</p>
