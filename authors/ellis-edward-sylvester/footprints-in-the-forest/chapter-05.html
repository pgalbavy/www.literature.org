<p>Why it was Deerfoot sought a quarrel with the Pawnee can not
be made fully clear. I incline to believe that his quick penetration
detected signs among the warriors that they did not mean to let
him withdraw, when he should seek to do so, and his plan was to
use the quarrel as a shield to thwart their purpose. This may
seem a strained explanation but let us see how it worked.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that the wonderful young warrior brought
about the disturbance in what may be called pure wantonness; that
is, his confidence in his own prowess led him to invite a contest,
which scarcely any other person would dare seek.</p>

<p>His last words were the spark to the magazine. The knife griped
by Lone Bear was snatched from his girdle, and he sprang forward,
striking with lightning-like viciousness at the chest of the Shawanoe,
who avoided him with half an effort.</p>

<p>In dodging the blow, the youth moved backward and to one side,
so as to bring all the warriors in front, and to leave open his
line of retreat. He had been as quick as Lone Bear to draw his
weapon, but he did not counter the blow&mdash;that is to an effective
extent. He struck his antagonist in the face, but only with the
handle of the weapon. Perhaps a pugilist would have said that
the younger "heeled" the other.</p>

<p>The stroke was a smart one, and delivered as it was on the nose,
intensified, by its indignity, the fury of Lone Bear. He lost
all self-control, as Deerfoot meant he should do.</p>

<p>This flurry, as may be supposed, centred the interest of the
others upon the two. The quarrel started as suddenly as it sometimes
does among a group of fowl, and, before it was understood, the
combatants, with drawn knives were facing each other. Few sights
are more entertaining to men than that of a fight. The Pawnees
in an instant were on their feet, with eyes fixed on the scene.</p>

<p>It must be believed that every one of the eleven Pawnees was
sure it was out of Deerfoot's power to elude the vengeance of
Lone Bear. The only fear of the ten was that he would dispatch
the youth so quickly that much of their enjoyment would be lost.
When they saw him strike Lone Bear in the face, a general shout
of derision went up at the elder antagonist, for permitting such
an outrage. This did not add to the good temper of Lone Bear,
who compressed his lips, while his eyes seemed to shoot lightning,
as he bounded at Deerfoot, intending to crush him to the earth
and to stamp life from him.</p>

<p>But even though the youth seemed to be lame, he leaped backward
and again escaped him. Lone Bear dashed forward, to force him
down, but Deerfoot kept limping away just fast enough to continue
beyond the reach of his enemy.</p>

<p>"Lone Bear runs like the fowl that has but one leg," was the
odd remark of Deerfoot, who pointed the finger of his left hand
at the other's face by way of tantalizing him.</p>

<p>But the fierce Pawnee was now pursuing so swiftly that Deerfoot
had to whirl about and run with his face from him. He still limped,
though had any one studied his gait, the trick would have been
detected; but the sight of Lone Bear chasing a lame youth and
failing to overtake him, did not calm his rage.</p>

<p>The warrior, however, was fleet, and marvellous as was the speed
of the young Shawanoe, he was compelled to put forth considerable
exertion to keep beyond his reach. His course took him quite close
to the edge of the wood, along which he ran, so that, should it
become necessary, he could leap among the trees. He watched his
pursuer over his shoulder, to prevent his coming too close. His
plan was to keep just beyond his reach and tempt him to the utmost
effort.</p>

<p>Faster and faster went the fugitive, while the pursuer desperately
put forth every effort, maddened beyond expression that the outstretched
hand failed only by a few inches to grasp the flying Deerfoot.
The spectators were amused to the last degree. Expecting quite
a chase, they ran forward, as persons along shore follow a boat
race, so as not to lose a phase of the struggle.</p>

<p>In the depths of his wrath, Lone Bear regained something of his
self-command, and called to mind the stories he had heard of the
fleetness of the young Shawanoe. That, with the fact that there
was no longer the least halt in his gait, told the disadvantage
in which the pursuer was placed.</p>

<p>If he could not reach the Shawanoe with his knife, he could with
his tomahawk or his rifle. Hastily thrusting back the knife, he
whipped out his tomahawk and raising it over his shoulder, hurled
it with might and main at the crown surmounted by the stained
eagle feathers and streaming black hair. At that moment, pursuer
and fugitive were scarcely ten feet apart.</p>

<p>But Deerfoot knew what was coming, and the instant the missile
left the hand of Lone Bear, he dropped flat on his side, as if
smitten by a thunderbolt. The shouting Pawnees, who were some
distance behind, supposed his skull had been cloven by the fiercely-driven
tomahawk, but it was not so.</p>

<p>Lone Bear did not see the trick of Deerfoot in time to escape
its purpose. The fall was so sudden, that before he could check
himself, his moccasin struck the prostrate figure, and he sprawled
headlong over him, heels in the air, and with a momentum almost
violent enough to cause him to overtake the tomahawk that had
sped end over end several rods in advance.</p>

<p>Before the Pawnee could rise, Deerfoot bounded up, sprang forward,
and, placing one foot on the head of Lone Bear, leaped high in
the air and spun around so as to face the party. Brandishing his
bow aloft, he emitted a shout of defiance and called out:</p>

<p>"Why do not the Pawnees run? Is none of their warriors fleet
enough to seize Deerfoot when he is lame?"</p>

<p>The only one of the company who could understand these questions
was the slightly stunned Lone Bear, who just then was climbing
to his feet; but the gestures and manner of the fugitive told
the meaning of the performance.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe stood still on the edge of the wood, as if
to show his contempt for the Pawnees, who before Lone Bear could
recover from his discomfiture, sped forward in pursuit. One of
them emitted several whoops, which Deerfoot half suspected were
meant as a signal, though of course he could not be sure of their
meaning.</p>

<p>It seemed like tempting fate to stand motionless, when only a
few seconds were required to bring his enemies to the spot, but
Deerfoot waited till Lone Bear was erect again, when he called
to him,</p>

<p>"The heart of Deerfoot is sad because Lone Bear can not run without
falling; let him go to the lodges of the Pawnees and ask the squaws
to teach him how to run."</p>

<p>Lone Bear made no reply, for it is safe to say he could not "do
justice to his feelings". Few Indian tongues contain words that
answer for expletives, which in one sense was fortunate and in
another unfortunate for Lone Bear.</p>

<p>When several of the pursuers brought their guns to their shoulders,
Deerfoot shot like an arrow among the trees and vanished. It was
time to do so, for his enemies were close upon him.</p>

<p>Though the Pawnees had learned of the swiftness of the young
Shawanoe, they had no thought of abandoning the attempt to capture
him. The flying tresses would make the most tempting of scalps
to dangle from the ridge-pole of the wigwam, and because he could
outrun all their warriors was no proof that he could not be overcome
by strategy.</p>

<p>When the fugitive disappeared, the same signal of which I have
spoken was repeated, and the Pawnees scattered&mdash;that is to say
they plunged into the wood at different points: they did not try
to overhaul him by direct pursuit.</p>

<p>Two of the Indians declined to join in the chase, but walked
toward Lone Bear, who having assumed the perpendicular again,
was looking around, as if uncertain of the best course to pursue.</p>

<p>The American Indian, as a rule, is melancholy and doesn't enjoy
innocent fun as much as he ought, but, as I have shown, there
are few or none in which the element of humor is altogether wanting.
The two of whom I am just now speaking, shook with laughter, as
they saw Lone Bear sprawl over Deerfoot, his heels flying in air,
and their mirth became so great when the young Shawanoe used his
crown as a stepping stone, that they paused from weakness.</p>

<p>Lone Bear knew nothing of this, and when he saw them approaching,
their faces were as long and grave as if on the way to attend
the funeral of their dearest friend. Perhaps he expected to receive
a little sympathy, but he must have felt some misgiving.</p>

<p>"Lone Bear runs like the wild buck," was the remark of one of
the warriors, though the observation itself did not amount to
much, nor could the one to whom it was addressed see why it should
be made at all. He, therefore, remained silent, feeling as though
he would like to rub some of the bruised portions of his body,
but too dignified to do so.</p>

<p>"If the wolf or buffalo crosses the path of Lone Bear, he does
not turn aside."</p>

<p>"No; he runs over him."</p>

<p>"Even though he be a warrior, Lone Bear goes over him, as though
he were not there."</p>

<p>The party of the third part began to see the drift of these comments,
and he glared as though debating which one to slay first.</p>

<p>"Lone Bear has a kind heart; it is like that of the squaw that
presses her pappoose to her heart."</p>

<p>"He is kinder than the squaw, for he lies still and lets the
Shawanoe rest his weary foot on his head."</p>

<p>Lone Bear glowered from one to the other, as they spoke in turn,
and kept his hand on his knife at his girdle, as if to warn them
they were going too far. They seemed to hold him in little fear,
however, and continued their mock sympathy. One walked to where
the tomahawk had lain untouched since it left the hand of the
Pawnee, and, picking it up, examined it with much care.</p>

<p>"There is no blood on it," he remarked, as if talking to himself,
but making sure he spoke loud enough for the other to hear; "we
were mistaken when we thought it went through the body of the
Shawanoe; the hand of Lone Bear trembles like that of an old man,
and he can not drive his tomahawk into the tree which he reaches
with his hand."</p>

<p>The black eyes of the Pawnees sparkled, and they seemed on the
point several times of breaking into laughter, but managed to
restrain themselves.</p>

<p>Still resting his hand on his knife, Lone Bear directed his first
remark to the last speaker.</p>

<p>"Let Red Wolf keep his tongue; he talks like the pappoose."</p>

<p>Red Wolf, however, did not seem to be alarmed. He glanced into
the face of his companion and added:</p>

<p>"Though Red Wolf talks like the pappoose, his heart is not so
faint that he lies on the ground, that his enemy may have a <em>soft
place</em> where he may rest his moccasin."</p>

<p>This, beyond question, was a severe remark, and, as the two broke
again into laughter, Lone Bear was almost as angry as when he
took a header over the body of the Shawanoe; but the warriors
were as brave as he; without reply, he turned sullenly away, and
walked toward the camp fire which he had left a short time before.</p>
