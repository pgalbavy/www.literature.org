<p>After gently tossing the stick in his hand, like one who endeavors
to ascertain its weight, Mickey smelled of it, and finally bit
his teeth into it, with a very satisfactory result.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what I call lucky, as the old miser obsarved when
he found he was going to save his dinner by dying in the forenoon.
Do you mind that shtick&mdash;big enough to sarve as a respictable
shillalah at Donnybrook Fair? Well, my laddy, that has done duty
as a lantern in this very place."</p>

<p>"As a torch, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Precisely; just heft it." As he tossed it into Fred's hand,
the latter was astonished to note its weight.</p>

<p>"What's the cause of that?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"It's a piece of pine, and its chuck full of pitch. That's why
it's so heavy. It'll burn like the biggest kind of a candle, and
me plan, me laddy, is to set that afire, and then start out to
larn something about this new house."</p>

<p>Nothing could have suited the boy better. He sprang to his feet
and took the gun from Mickey, so as to leave him free to carry
the torch. One end of the latter was thrust into the fire, and
it caught as readily as if it were smeared with alcohol. It was
a bit of pine, as fat as it could be, and, as a torch, could not
have been improved upon.</p>

<p>Then Mickey elevated it above his head, it gave forth a long
yellow smoke blaze, which answered admirably the purpose for which
it was required.</p>

<p>"I'll take the lead," said he to his young friend, when they
were ready to start. "You follow a few yards behind and look as
sharp as you can to find out all there is to be found out. You
know there is much that depends on this."</p>

<p>There was no possibility of Fred failing to use all his senses
to the utmost, and he told his friend to go ahead and do the same.</p>

<p>Mickey first headed toward the cascade, as he had some hope of
learning something in that direction. Reaching the base of the
falls, they paused a while to contemplate them. There was nothing
noteworthy about them, except their location underneath the ground.</p>

<p>The water fell with such a gentle sound that the two were able
to converse in ordinary tones when standing directly at the base.
Both knelt down and tasted the cool and refreshing element, and
then Mickey, torch in hand, led the way up stream again.</p>

<p>Through this world of gloom the two made their way with considerable
care. Mickey cherished a lingering suspicion that there might
be some one else in the cave besides themselves, in which case
he and Fred would offer the best target possible; but he was willing
to incur the risk, and, although he moved slowly, it was with
a decision to see the thing through, and learn all that was to
be learned about the cave. The stream was followed about a hundred
yards above the falls, when the explorers reached the point where
it entered the cave, and the two made the closest examination
possible.</p>

<p>On the way to the point the two had acquired considerable information.
The roof of their underground residence had a varying height from
the floor of from twenty to fifty feet. The floor itself was regular,
but not sufficiently so to prevent their walking over it with
comparative ease. The stream was only five or six feet in width
and wherever examined was found to be quite shallow. It flowed
at a moderate rate, and it entered the cavern from beneath a rock
that ascended continuously from the floor to the roof.</p>

<p>"Freddy, my laddy; do you take this torch and walk off aways,
so that it will be dark here," said Mickey to his companion.</p>

<p>The latter obeyed, and the man made as critical an examination
as he could. His object was to learn whether the water came into
the cave from the outer world, or whether its source was beneath
the rock. If the former, there was possibly a way out by means
of the stream, provided the distance intervening was not too great.
Mickey thought that if this distance were passable, there would
be some glimmer of light to indicate it. But, when left alone
in the darkness, he found that there was not the slightest approach
to anything of the kind, and he was compelled to acknowledge that
all escape by that direction was utterly out of the question.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he called Fred to him, and they began the descent
of the stream. When they reached the falls, they paused below
them, and Micky held the torch close to the water, where it was
quiet enough for them to observe the bottom.</p>

<p>"Tell me whether ye can see anything resimbling fishes?"</p>

<p>The lad peered into the water a minute, and them caught a flash
of silver several times.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's plenty of them!" he exclaimed, as the number increased,
and they shot forward from every direction, drawn to the one point
by the glare of the torch. "There's enough fish for us, if we
can only find some way to get them out."</p>

<p>"That's the rub," said Mickey, scratching his head in perplexity.
"I don't notice any fishlines and hooks about here. Howsumever,
we can wait awhile, being as our venizon isn't all gone, and we'll
look down stream, for there's where our main chance must be."</p>

<p>The Irishman, somehow or other, had formed the idea that the
outlet of the water would show them a way of getting out of the
cavern. Despite his careless and indifferent disposition, he showed
considerable anxiety, as he led the way along the bank, holding
the smoking torch far above his head, and lighting up the gloom
and darkness for a long distance on every hand.</p>

<p>"When your eye rists on anything interesting, call me attention
to the same," he cautioned him.</p>

<p>"I'll be sure to do that," replied Fred, who let nothing escape
him.</p>

<p>The scenery was gloomy and oppressive, but acquired a certain
monotony as they advanced. The dark water, throwing back the light
of the torch; the towering, massive rocks overhead and on every
hand; the jagged, irregular roof and floor&mdash;these were the characteristics
of the scene which was continually opening before and closing
behind them. In several places the brook spread out into a slowly
flowing pond of fifty or a hundred feet in width; but it maintained
its progress all the time.</p>

<p>At no point which they examined did the depth of the water appear
greater than three feet, while in most places it was less than
that. It preserved its crystal-like clearness at all times, and
in all respects was a beautiful stream.</p>

<p>When they had advanced a hundred yards or so, the camp-fire which
they had left behind them took on a strange and unnatural appearance.
It seemed far away and burned with a pale yellow glare that would
have seemed supernatural, had it been contemplated by any one
of a superstitious turn.</p>

<p>As near as Mickey could estimate, they had gone over a hundred
and fifty yards when the point was reached where the stream gathered
itself and passed from view. Its width was no greater than four
feet, while its rapidity was correspondingly increased.</p>

<p>After Mickey had contemplated it awhile by the light of the torch,
he handed the latter to Fred, and told him to go off so far that
he would be left in total darkness. This being done, the man set
to work to study out the problem before him.</p>

<p>His theory was that, if the passage of the stream from the cavern
to the outside world were brief, the evidence of it could be seen,
perhaps, in the faintest tinge of light in the water, The sun
was shining brightly on the outside, and unless the stream flowed
quite a distance under ground, a portion of the refracted light
would reach his eye.</p>

<p>Mickey peered at the base of the rock for a few minutes, and
then exclaimed, with considerable excitement:</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but it's there!"</p>

<p>It was dim and faint, as light is sometimes seen through a translucent
substance, but he saw it so plainly that there could be no error.
When he looked aloft at the impenetrable gloom, he was sensible
of the same dim light upon the water. He tested his accuracy of
vision by looking in different directions, but the result was
the same every time.</p>

<p>The almost invisible illumination being there, the Irishman wanted
no philosopher to tell him that it was the sun striking the water
as it reached the outside, and the outer world, which he was so
desirous of re-entering, was close at hand.</p>

<p>Mickey was in high glee at the discovery, but when he regained
his mental poise, he could not shut his eyes to the fact that
if he attempted to reach the outer world by means of the stream,
he ran a terrible risk of losing his life. There was no vacancy
between the water and the stone which shut down upon it. The outlet
was like an open faucet to a full barrel. The escaping fluid filled
up all the space at command.</p>

<p>No one can live long without air. A few seconds of suspended
respiration is fatal to the strongest swimmer. If the distance
traveled by Mickey, when he should attempt to dive or float through
to the outer world, should prove a trifle too long, the stream
would cast out a dead man instead of a live one.</p>

<p>But he was a person of thorough grit, and before he would consent
to see himself and Fred imprisoned in this cavern, he would make
the attempt, perilous as it was.</p>

<p>Was there no other way of escape? Was there not some opening
which had been used by those who had entered this cave ahead of
him? Or was it possible that the imprisoning walls were to thin
and shell-like in some places that there was a means of forcing
their way out? Or was there no plan of climbing up the side of
the prison and reaching an opening in the roof, through which
they could clamber to safety?</p>

<p>These and other thoughts were surging through the mind of Mickey
O'Rooney, when an exclamation from Fred caused him to turn his
head. The boy was running toward him, apparently in great excitement.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, me laddy?" asked Mickey, cocking his rifle,
which he had taken from him at the time of handing him the torch.
"Oh, Mickey, Mickey! I saw a man just now!"</p>
