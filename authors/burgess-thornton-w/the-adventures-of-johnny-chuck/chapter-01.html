<p>"Good news, good news for every one, above or down below, For
Master Winsome Bluebird's come to whistle off the snow!"</p>

<p>All the Green Meadows and all the Green Forest had heard the
news. Peter Rabbit had seen to that. And just as soon as each
of the little meadow and forest folks heard it, he hurried out
to listen for himself and make sure that it was true. And each,
when he heard that sweet voice of Winsome Bluebird, had kicked
up his heels and shouted "Hurrah!"</p>

<p>You see they all knew that Winsome Bluebird never is very far
ahead of gentle Sister South Wind, and that when she arrives,
blustering, rough Brother North Wind is already on his way back
to the cold, cold land where the ice never melts.</p>

<p>Of course Winsome Bluebird doesn't really whistle off the snow,
but after he comes, the snow disappears so fast that it seems
as if he did. It is surprising what a difference a little good
news makes. Of course nothing had really changed that first day
when Winsome Bluebird's whistle was heard on the Green Meadows
and in the Green Forest, but it seemed as if everything had changed.
And it was all because that sweet whistle was a promise, a promise
that every one knew would come true. And so there was joy in all
the hearts on the Green Meadows and in the Green Forest. Even
grim old Granny Fox felt it, and as for Reddy Fox, why, Reddy
even shouted good-naturedly to Peter Rabbit and hoped he was feeling
well.</p>

<p>And then gentle Sister South Wind arrived. She came in the night,
and in the morning there she was, hard at work making the Green
Meadows and the Green Forest ready for Mistress Spring. She broke
the icy bands that had bound the Smiling Pool and the Laughing
Brook so long; and the Smiling Pool began to smile once more,
and the Laughing Brook to gurgle and then to laugh and finally
to sing merrily.</p>

<p>She touched the little banks of snow that remained, and straightway
they melted and disappeared. She kissed the eight babies of Unc'
Billy Possum, and they kicked off the bedclothes under which old
Mrs. Possum had tucked them and scrambled out of the big hollow
tree to play.</p>

<p>She peeped in at the door of Johnny Chuck and called softly,
and Johnny Chuck awoke from his long sleep and yawned and began
to think about getting up. She knocked at the door of Digger the
Badger, and Digger awoke. She tickled the nose of Striped Chipmunk,
who was about half awake, and Striped Chipmunk sneezed and then
he hopped out of bed and hurried up to his doorway to shout good
morning after her, as she hurried over to see if Bobby Coon was
still sleeping.</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit followed her about. He couldn't understand it at
all. Peter had smiled to himself when he heard how softly she
had called at the doorway of Johnny Chuck's house, for many and
many a time during the long winter Peter had stopped at Johnny
Chuck's house and shouted down the long hall at the top of his
voice without once waking Johnny Chuck. Now Peter nearly tumbled
over with surprise, as he heard Johnny Chuck yawn at the first
low call of gentle Sister South Wind.</p>

<p>"How does she do it? I don't understand it at all," said Peter,
as he scratched his long left ear with his long left hind leg.</p>

<p>Gentle Sister South Wind smiled at Peter. "There are a lot of
things in this world that you will never understand, Peter Rabbit.
You will just have to believe them without understanding them
and be content to know that they are so," she said, and hurried
over to the Green Forest to tell Unc' Billy Possum that his old
friend, Ol' Mistah Buzzard, was on his way up from ol' Virginny.</p>
