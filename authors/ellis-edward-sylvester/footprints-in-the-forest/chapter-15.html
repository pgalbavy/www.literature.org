<p>Three separate times Jack Carleton noticed a peculiar jar of
the tree in which he was perched. He felt no alarm, but some curiosity
to know the cause.</p>

<p>Peering downward between the limbs, he could see nothing to explain
the occurrence. The first time he concluded it was imagination,
but when it was repeated twice he knew there was "something in
it". Still, as the most careful search failed to reveal the cause,
he was at a loss to explain it. His first thought was that some
animal might be chafing his body against the trunk, but that was
unlikely, because no creature was visible. Then, when he noticed
there was enough air stirring to cause a gentle swaying of the
branches, he concluded that the disturbance was due to the friction
of some of the limbs against others. The theory was more ingenious
than reasonable, but was accepted in lieu of a better one, and
once more the lad fixed his eyes on the open space across the
stream.</p>

<p>The other Pawnees had not put in an appearance, and before they
did so, the young gentleman in the tree-top found he had something
on hand which required his whole attention.</p>

<p>A fourth time a jar went through the trunk from base to summit,
and the disturbance was more marked than before.</p>

<p>"There must be some animal down there&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jack Carleton grasped a limb above him, leaned far over and peered
among the branches below, but his examination was not finished
when he saw the hand of an Indian warrior reach around the trunk,
at a point half way between the top and the base, and grasp the
rifle which the young Kentuckian had skewered between several
supports. The stock caught slightly, and, while disengaging it,
the savage brought his head into view.</p>

<p>He wore no scalp-lock, as was the fashion among many tribes,
but the long, coarse hair dangled about his shoulders, and yellow,
crimson and blue paint were mixed in that on his crown. There
were no feathers, however, such as Deerfoot was fond of displaying,
and the body was covered with a thin shirt of deerskin above the
waist.</p>

<p>The Indian must have glanced aloft from the ground and taken
in the situation at once. He had climbed with great care, and,
when he stopped, was slightly below the point were rested the
rifle of the youth. Had the latter taken the alarm, when he felt
the first jar, he could have scrambled down and secured his gun
ahead of the Indian. It would have been a stirring race between
them, but as I have shown, the first knowledge of the truth came
to Jack when he descried the extended arm and saw the coppery
fingers in the very act of closing about his property.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the dusky thief was forced to reach upward to seize
the weapon, his face was lifted enough for the lad to gain a partial
view of his countenance. It was similar to many he had seen among
the Sauks and elsewhere. The forehead was broad at the base and
narrow at the top (which was close to the forehead) and very retreating.
The protuberant temples, small eyes, heavy nose, wide mouth and
retreating chin&mdash;the whole smeared with daubs of paint, such as
soiled the horsehair-like covering of his head, rendered the features
the most repulsive on which the lad had ever looked. He certainly
had never beheld a more unwelcome visitor.</p>

<p>Having secured the property of the lad, the warrior now threw
his head further back, and looked directly up at him. The face,
ugly as it was, appeared the worse because of the grin that split
it in twain and displayed the white teeth which gleamed like those
of a ravenous beast. The expression and action said as plainly
as could the words themselves:</p>

<p>"It's no use, young gentleman; you may as well come down."</p>

<p>The Indian did not speak, and his frightful smile gradually relaxed
until his mouth assumed its normal width. Then, holding the captured
rifle in one hand, he began descending, Jack Carleton remained
astride of the upper limb, watching the warrior, who went down
with the nimbleness of a monkey. Viewed from above, the sight
was odd. He seemed to see nothing but a mass of dangling hair
and an indefinite number of arms and legs which were sawing back
and forth, and moving up and down, while the body to which they
were attached, remained stationary. The illusion, however, was
dispelled, when the Indian made a slight leap and landed on the
ground.</p>

<p>Immediately he turned, and standing close to the trunk (the better
to see among the limbs), fixed his eyes on Jack Carleton, and
solemnly beckoned with his arm for him to descend.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" thought the latter, "I don't believe there's any
help for it. Ah, if Deerfoot only knew!"</p>

<p>It occurred to the youth that possibly the Shawanoe could be
reached by signal. He hastily drew aside the leaves and looked
toward the spot where he saw him but a short time before. But
the scene had changed. Deerfoot was gone, and the Pawnees were
swarming back to camp, a number listening with rapt attention
to the monumental yarns which Lone Bear and Red Wolf were pouring
into the ears of their credulous listeners, whose experience having
been what it was, prepared them to believe almost any thing.</p>

<p>"No help from <em>there</em>," concluded the youth with a sigh,
as he let the leaves come together and shut out his view of the
other shore; "I wonder what this warrior will do with me; I suppose
he will run me over to the rest, and they'll even up matters by
taking their vengeance on <em>me</em>&mdash;helloa! there's no need
of <em>that</em>!"</p>

<p>Looking downward, Jack saw that his captor was no longer beckoning
for him to descend. Like the old farmer, who, finding there was
no virtue in grass, resorted to stones, the Indian had substituted
the gun, and held it pointed at the youngster, who was slow in
moving from his lofty perch.</p>

<p>There was no call to fire; the youth grasped the situation at
once and began lowering himself with great promptness. While doing
so, he occasionally took a peep between his feet, and each time
saw the warrior standing erect and following his movements with
the gun, as a hunter does when aiming at a gyrating bird.</p>

<p>"I hope I'm giving satisfaction," muttered Jack, who felt the
cold perspiration breaking out all over his body; "if he isn't
satisfied, I'll let go and drop. I wish I could do it, so as to
fall on his head and break his neck." When almost to the ground,
Jack was relieved to observe the red man lower his weapon. He
heard the click of the lock, as he let the flint down in place.
It was a vast relief from suspense, but it may be doubted whether,
after all, Jack's danger was any less than before. Whatever sinister
thoughts were in the mind of the red man remained when the young
Kentuckian stood before him an unresisting prisoner.</p>

<p>I need not say that while Jack Carleton was descending the tree
he thought hard and fast. He was in a situation of the gravest
peril, and there was no human arm on which he could rely for help.
His hot Kentucky blood was aroused, and he resolved that if his
captor offered him harm or indignity, he would give him the hottest
fight of which he was capable. The youth still had his knife and
he meant to keep it. While coming down the tree, he quietly shoved
it inside of his coat where it could not be seen, but was available
for instant use.</p>

<p>He feared the warrior had several comrades with him, but was
relieved to find that such was not the case.</p>

<p>"He must have seen me from the other side," was the conclusion
of the youth, "and slipped across without my noticing him, just
as those Sauks got behind Otto and me when we never dreamed of
danger. He ain't the Indian that was looking at me; I suppose
that one who tumbled over Deerfoot told this dog, and here he
is."</p>

<p>Dropping the stock of the captured rifle on the ground, the red
skin grasped the barrel near the muzzle, standing in an easy attitude,
with the weight of his body resting on one foot, and looked into
the eyes of Jack Carleton, as if trying to read the secrets of
his breast.</p>

<p>The youth was almost as tall as his captor, and he returned the
scrutiny. He did not assume any defiant manner, for he was far
from wishing to exasperate him who was master of the situation.</p>

<p>"I think I could give him a pretty good tussle," was the conclusion
of Jack, "and whenever he chooses to sail in, I am ready, but
I wish things were nearer even between us."</p>

<p>It was noticeable that the only rifle in sight was the one belonging
to the prisoner. It seemed incredible that the warrior should
have left camp without the indispensable weapon, though, if he
had brought it away, it was now invisible.</p>

<p>But, in addition to the stolen piece, he carried the tomahawk
and knife at his girdle, and there could be no question that he
was an adept in their use.</p>

<p>When Jack looked down from his place in the tree top on the countenance
of his captor, he perceived a curious distortion, which was now
explained. At some time in his history the Indian had received
a slash across the face, which clove the bone and cartilage of
the nose and laid one of the cheeks open. The cicatrice, combined
with the natural ugliness of the features, and the greasy ocher
and paint, daubed and smeared over the skin, rendered the countenance
of the warrior as frightful as can be conceived.</p>

<p>But Jack Carleton had met too many hideous Indians to be disturbed
by their appearance. It was the <em>action</em> of this one in
which he felt interest.</p>

<p>It was a noteworthy feature of the young Kentuckian's capture,
that he was angered by the evidence that the Indian had brought
no gun with him. Such a course implied that the youth was held
in light regard, and not deemed the equal of a warrior in a hand-to-hand
struggle.</p>

<p>"They think I am nothing but a boy," he thought, "and so they
sent a warrior so horrible of face that they hope he will scare
me out of my wits; at any rate, they don't believe it worth while
for him to bring a gun; may be he'll regret that before he is
through."</p>

<p>Having scrutinized the captive from head to foot, the captor
seemed to be satisfied. Without attempting any words, he beckoned
as before for Jack to follow him. The gesture was made at the
moment the warrior turned and began walking over the course parallel
to the river and leading toward its mouth.</p>

<p>The action placed Jack behind his master, instead of in front,
and it could not but suggest several desperate expedients to him,
who was resolved not to allow himself to be taken across the river.
He had witnessed enough from his elevated lookout to convince
him that the stream on his right was his Rubicon; if he once passed
<em>that</em>, there would be no return.</p>
