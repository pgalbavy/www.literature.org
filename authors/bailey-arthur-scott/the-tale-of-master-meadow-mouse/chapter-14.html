<p>IT was no wonder that Master Meadow Mouse was startled. He cowered
inside his nest in the top of the shock of corn. The whole shock shook.
There was a terrible rustle of dry leaves as Fatty Coon tore away stalk
after stalk.
</p>
<p>"Old Mr. Crow never did this!" Master Meadow Mouse stammered. "He never
disturbed my rest. But this awful Fatty Coon means to catch me. And I
don't know what to do."
</p><p>Meanwhile Fatty Coon was muttering horribly to himself as he worked.
</p><p>"This fellow must be fat," he grunted, as he wrenched at a stubborn
stalk with claws and teeth. "With all this corn to feast on he must be
in fine trim. Mm! He ought to be just right to top off a good meal of
corn."
</p><p>"My goodness!" Master Meadow Mouse gasped. "How annoying! He intends to
eat me!"
</p><p>For a few moments Master Meadow Mouse wondered whether he ought to fight
or run. "I wish," he thought, "that I'd brought my old sign with me when
I moved to this new home. If I had hung it outside my door Fatty Coon
wouldn't have bothered me. When he read that notice, 'Gone to lunch.
Back To-morrow,' he would have shuffled off about his business." But
idle thoughts and wishes were of no use at a time like that. Master
Meadow Mouse soon realized that he must act--and act quickly.
</p><p>"Maybe I'll bite his nose," he said to himself. "But I want to peep at
him first."
</p><p>So Master Meadow Mouse left his nest and crept a short distance until he
could peer out from a chink between two cornstalks. In the moonlight he
had a fine view of Fatty Coon. And as he stared at the intruder Meadow
Mouse shuddered.
</p><p>"No!" he exclaimed. "No! I never could fight him. I wouldn't dare bite
his nose. He's far, far too big for me to tackle."
</p><p>There was no denying that Fatty Coon looked both huge and dangerous.
Across his face was a black mask which only added to his horrid
appearance. And through the mask his eyes shone green and greedy right
into the frightened ones of Master Meadow Mouse.
</p><p>One good look was enough for Master Meadow Mouse. He drew back
hurriedly. Through his mind there flashed a saying of his mother's that
he had not thought of for a long time: "He that fights and runs away
will live to fight another day."
</p><p>"I'll run first," Master Meadow Mouse decided. "Then perhaps I shan't
have to fight at all."
</p><p>Then he stole out of the shock of corn, on the opposite side. And when
Fatty Coon pawed his way through to the nest he found it empty.
</p><p>He gave a wail of anger and dismay.
</p><p>"He's gone! The Meadow Mouse has gone!" Fatty bawled. "And I'll warrant
he was a fat one, too. It's always the fattest ones that get away. And
nobody can deny that this one was living high."
