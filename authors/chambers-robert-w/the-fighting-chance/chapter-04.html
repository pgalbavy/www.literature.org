<p>Breakfast at Shotover, except for the luxurious sluggards to
whom trays were sent, was served in the English fashion&mdash;any other
method or compromise being impossible.</p>

<p>Ferrall, reasonable in most things, detested customs exotic,
and usually had an Englishman or two about the house to tell them
so, being unable to jeer in any language except his own. Which
is partly why Alderdene and Voucher were there. And this British
sideboard breakfast was a concession wrung from him through force
of sheer necessity, although the custom had already become practically
universal in American country houses where guests were entertained.</p>

<p>But at the British breakfast he drew the line. No army of servants,
always in evidence, would he tolerate, either; no highly ornamented
human bric-à-brac decorating halls and corners; no exotic pheasants
hustled into covert and out again; no fusillade at the wretched,
frightened, bewildered aliens dumped by the thousand into unfamiliar
cover and driven toward the guns by improvised beaters.</p>

<p>"We walk up our game or we follow a brace of good dogs in this
white man's country," he said with unnecessary emphasis whenever
his bad taste and his wife's absence gave him an opportunity to
express to the casual foreigner his personal opinions on field
sport. "You'll load your own guns and you'll use your own legs
if you shoot with me; and your dogs will do their own retrieving,
too. And if anybody desires a Yankee's opinion on shooting driven
birds from rocking-chairs or potting tame deer from grand-stands,
they can have it right now!"</p>

<p>Usually nobody wanted his further opinion; and sometimes they
got it and sometimes not, if his wife was within earshot. Otherwise
Ferrall appeared to be a normal man, energetically devoted to
his business, his pleasures, his friends, and comfortably in love
with his wife. And if some considered his vigour in business to
be lacking in mercy, that vigour was always exercised within the
law. He never transgressed the rules of war, but his headlong
energy sometimes landed him close to the dead line. He had already
breakfasted, when the earliest risers entered the morning room
to saunter about the sideboards and investigate the simmering
contents of silver-covered dishes on the warmers.</p>

<p>The fragrance of coffee was pleasantly perceptible; men in conventional
shooting attire roamed about the room, selected what they cared
for, and carried it to the table. Mrs. Mortimer was there consuming
peaches that matched her own complexion; Marion Page, always more
congruous in field costume and belted jacket than in anything
else, and always, like her own hunters, minutely groomed, was
preparing a breakfast for her own consumption with the leisurely
precision characteristic of her whether in the saddle, on the
box, or grassing her brace of any covey that ever flushed.</p>

<p>Captain Voucher and Lord Alderdene discussed prospects between
bites, attentive to the monosyllabic opinions of Miss Page. Her
twin brothers, Gordon and Willis, shyly consuming oatmeal, listened
respectfully and waited on their sister at the slightest lifting
of her thinly arched eyebrows.</p>

<p>Into this company sauntered Siward, apparently no worse for wear.
For as yet the Enemy had set upon him no proprietary insignia
save a rather becoming pallor and faint bluish shadows under the
eyes. He strolled about, exchanging amiable greetings, and presently
selected a chilled grape fruit as his breakfast. Opposite him
Mortimer, breakfasting upon his own dreadful bracer of an apple
soaked in port, raised his heavy inflamed eyes with a significant
leer at the iced grape fruit. For he was always ready to make
room upon his own level for other men; but the wordless grin and
the bloodshot welcome were calmly ignored, for as yet that freemasonry
evoked no recognition from the pallid man opposite, whose hands
were steady as though that morning's sun had wakened him from
pleasant dreams.</p>

<p>"The most difficult shot in the world," Alderdene was explaining,
"is an incoming pheasant, sailing on a slant before a gale."</p>

<p>"A woodcock in alders doing a jack-snipe twist is worse," grunted
Mortimer, drenching another apple in port.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Page tersely.</p>

<p>"Or a depraved ruffed cock-grouse in the short pines; isn't that
the limit?" asked Mortimer of Siward.</p>

<p>But Siward only shrugged his comment and glanced out through
the leaded casements into the brilliant September sunshine.</p>

<p>Outside he could see Major Belwether, pink skinned, snowy chop
whiskers brushed rabbit fashion, very voluble with Sylvia Landis,
who listened absently, head partly averted. Quarrier in tweeds
and gaiters, his morning cigar delicately balanced in his gloved
fingers, strolled near enough to be within ear-shot; and when
Sylvia's inattention to Major Belwether's observations became
marked to the verge of rudeness, he came forward and spoke. But
whatever it was that he said appeared to change her passive inattention
to quiet displeasure, for, as Siward rose from the table, he saw
her turn on her heel and walk slowly toward a group of dogs presided
over by some kennel men and gamekeepers.</p>

<p>She was talking to the head gamekeeper when he emerged from the
house, but she saw him on the terrace and gave him a bright nod
of greeting, so close to an invitation that he descended the stone
steps and crossed the dew-wet lawn.</p>

<p>"I am asking Dawson to explain just exactly what a 'Shotover
Drive' resembles," she said, turning to include Siward in an animated
conference with the big, scraggy, head keeper. "You know, Mr.
Siward, that it is a custom peculiar to Shotover House to open
the season with what is called a Shotover Drive?"</p>

<p>"I heard Alderdene talking about it," he said, smilingly inspecting
the girl's attire of khaki with its buttoned pockets, gun pads,
and Cossack cartridge loops, and the tan knee-kilts hanging heavily
pleated over gaiters and little thick-soled shoes. He had never
cared very much to see women afield, for, in a rare case where
there was no affectation, there was something else inborn that
he found unpleasant&mdash;something lacking about a woman who could
take life from frightened wild things, something shocking that
a woman could look, unmoved, upon a twitching, blood-soiled heap
of feathers at her feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dawson, dog-whip at salute, stood knee deep among his
restless setters, explaining the ceremony with which Mr. Ferrall
ushered in the opening of each shooting season:</p>

<p>"It's our own idee, Miss Landis," he said proudly; "onc't a season
Mr. Ferrall and his guests likes it for a mixed bag. 'Tis a sort
of picnic, Miss; the guns is in pairs, sixty yards apart in line,
an' the rules is, walk straight ahead, dogs to heel until first
cover is reached; fire straight or to quarter, never blankin'
nor wipin' no eyes; and ground game counts as feathers for the
Shotover Cup."</p>

<p>"Oh! It's a skirmish line that walks straight ahead?" said Siward,
nodding.</p>

<p>"Straight ahead, Sir. No stoppin', no turnin' for hedges, fences,
water or rock. There is boats f'r deep water and fords marked
and corduroy f'r to pass the Seven Dreens. Luncheon at one, Miss&mdash;an
hour's rest&mdash;then straight on over hill, valley, rock, and river
to the rondyvoo atop Osprey Ledge. You'll see the poles and the
big nests, Sir. It's there they score for the cup, and there when
the bag is counted, the traps are ready to carry you home again."
… And to Siward: "Will you draw for your lady, Sir? It is the
custom."</p>

<p>"Are you my 'lady'?" he asked, turning to Sylvia.</p>

<p>"Do you want me?"</p>

<p>In the smiling lustre of her eyes the tiniest spark flashed out
at him&mdash;a hint of defiance for somebody, perhaps for Major Belwether
who had taken considerable pains to enlighten her as to Siward's
condition the night before; perhaps also for Quarrier, who had
naturally expected to act as her gun-bearer in emergencies. But
the gaily veiled malice of the one had annoyed her, and the cold
assumption of the other had irritated her, and she had, scarcely
knowing why, turned her shoulder to both of these gentlemen with
an indefinite idea of escaping a pressure, amounting almost to
critical importunity.</p>

<p>"I'm probably a poor shot?" she said, looking smilingly, straight
into Siward's eyes. "But if you'll take me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will with pleasure," he said; "Dawson, do we draw for position?
Very well then"; and he drew a slip of paper from the box offered
by the head keeper.</p>

<p>"Number seven!" said Sylvia, looking over his shoulder. "Come
out to the starting line, Mr. Siward. All the positions are marked
with golf-discs. What sort of ground have we ahead, Dawson?"</p>

<p>"Kind o' stiff, Miss," grinned the keeper. "Pity your gentleman
ain't drawed the meadows an' Sachem Hill line. Will you choose
your dog, Sir?"</p>

<p>"You have your dog, you know," observed Sylvia demurely. And
Siward, glancing among the impatient setters, saw one white, heavily
feathered dog, straining at his leash, and wagging frantically,
brown eyes fixed on him.</p>

<p>The next moment Sagamore was free, devouring his master with
caresses, the girl looking on in smiling silence; and presently,
side by side, the man, the girl, and the dog were strolling off
to the starting line where already people were gathering in groups,
selecting dogs, fowling-pieces, comparing numbers, and discussing
the merits of their respective lines of advance.</p>

<p>Ferrall, busily energetic, and in high spirits, greeted them
gaily, pointing out the red disc bearing their number, seven,
where it stood out distinctly above the distant scrub of the foreland.</p>

<p>"You two are certainly up against it!" he said, grinning. "There's
only one rougher line, and you're in for thorns and water and
a scramble across the back-bone of the divide!"</p>

<p>"Is it any good?" asked Siward.</p>

<p>"Good&mdash;if you've got the legs and Sylvia doesn't play baby&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I?" she said indignantly. "Kemp, you annoy me. And I will bet
you now,"  she added, flushing, "that your old cup is ours."</p>

<p>"Wait," said Siward, laughing, "we may not shoot straight."</p>

<p>"You will! Kemp, I'll wager whatever you dare!"</p>

<p>"Gloves? Stockings?&mdash;against a cigarette case?" he suggested.</p>

<p>"Done," she said disdainfully, moving forward along the skirmish
line with a nod and smile for the groups now disintegrating into
couples, the Page boys with Eileen Shannon and Rena Bonnesdel,
Marion Page followed by Alderdene, Mrs. Vendenning and Major Belwether
and the Tassel girl convoyed by Leroy Mortimer. Farther along
the line, taking post, she saw Quarrier and Miss Caithness, Captain
Voucher with Mrs. Mortimer, and others too distant to recognise,
moving across country with glitter and glint of sunlight on slanting
gun barrels.</p>

<p>And now Ferrall was climbing into his saddle beside his pretty
wife, who sat her horse like a boy, the white flag lifted high
in the sunshine, watching the firing line until the last laggard
was in position.</p>

<p>"All right, Grace!" said Ferrall briskly. Down went the white
flag; the far-ranged line started into motion straight across
country, dogs at heel.</p>

<p>From her saddle Mrs. Ferrall could see the advance, strung out
far afield from the dark spots moving along the Fells boundary,
to the two couples traversing the salt meadows to north. Crack!
A distant report came faintly over the uplands against the wind.</p>

<p>"Voucher," observed Ferrall; "probably a snipe. Hark! he's struck
them again, Grace."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ferrall, watching curiously, saw Siward's gun fly up as
two big dark spots floated up from the marsh and went swinging
over his head. Crack! Crack! Down sheered the black spots, tumbling
earthward out of the sky.</p>

<p>"Duck," said Ferrall; "a double for Stephen. Lord Harry! how
that man can shoot! Isn't it a pity that&mdash;"</p>

<p>He said no more; his pretty wife astride her thoroughbred sat
silent, grey eyes fixed on the distant figures of Sylvia Landis
and Siward, now shoulder deep in the reeds.</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;very bad last night?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>Ferrall shrugged. "He was not offensive; he walked steadily enough
up-stairs. When I went into his room he lay on the bed as if he'd
been struck by lightning. And yet&mdash;you see how he is this morning?"</p>

<p>"After a while," his wife said, "it is going to alter him some
day&mdash;dreadfully&mdash;isn't it, Kemp?"</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;like Mortimer?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;only Leroy was always a pig."</p>

<p>As they turned their horses toward the high-road Mrs. Ferrall
said: "Do you know why Sylvia isn't shooting with Howard?"</p>

<p>"No," replied her husband indifferently; "do you?"</p>

<p>"No." She looked out across the sunlit ocean, grave grey eyes
brightening with suppressed mischief. "But I half suspect."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Oh, all sorts of things, Kemp."</p>

<p>"What's one of 'em?" asked Ferrall, looking around at her; but
his wife only laughed.</p>

<p>"You don't mean she's throwing her flies at Siward&mdash;now that
you've hooked Quarrier for her! I thought she'd played him to
the gaff&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please don't be coarse, Kemp," said Mrs. Ferrall, sending her
horse forward. Her husband spurred to her side, and without turning
her head she continued: "Of course Sylvia won't be foolish. If
they were only safely married; but Howard is such a pill&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does Sylvia expect with Howard's millions? A man?"</p>

<p>Grace Ferrall drew bridle. "The curious thing is, Kemp, that
she liked him."</p>

<p>"Likes him?"</p>

<p>"No, liked him. I saw how it was; she took his silences for intellectual
meditation, his gallery, his library, his smatterings for expressions
of a cultivated personality. Then she remembered how close she
came to running off with that cashiered Englishman, and that scared
her into clutching the substantial in the shape of Howard. … Still,
I wish I hadn't meddled."</p>

<p>"Meddled how?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I told her to do it. We had talks until daylight. … She
may marry him &mdash;I don't know&mdash;but if you think any live woman
could be contented with a muff like that!"</p>

<p>"That's immoral."</p>

<p>"Kemp, I'm not. She'd be mad not to marry him; but I don't know
what I'd do to a man like that, if I were his wife. And you know
what a terrific capacity for mischief there is in Sylvia. Some
day she's going to love somebody. And it isn't likely to be Howard.
And, oh, Kemp! I do grow so tired of that sort of thing. Do you
suppose anybody will ever make decency a fashion?"</p>

<p>"You're doing your best," said Ferrall, laughing at his wife's
pretty, boyish face turned back toward him over her shoulder;
"you're presenting your cousin and his millions to a girl who
can dress the part&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Kemp! I don't know why I meddled! … I wish I hadn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I do. You can't let Howard alone! You're perfectly possessed
to plague him when he's with you, and now you've arranged for
another woman to keep it up for the rest of his lifetime. What
does Sylvia want with a man who possesses the instincts and intellect
of a coachman? She is asked everywhere, she has her own money.
Why not let her alone? Or is it too late?"</p>

<p>"You mean let her make a fool of herself with Stephen Siward?
That is where she is drifting."</p>

<p>"Do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. She has a perfect genius for selecting the wrong
man; and she's already sorry for this one. I'm sorry for Stephen,
too; but it's safe for me to be."</p>

<p>"She might make something of him."</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well no woman ever did make anything of a
doomed man. He'd kill her &mdash;I mean it, Kemp! He would literally
kill her with grief. She isn't like Leila Mortimer; she isn't
like most girls of her sort. You men think her a rather stunning,
highly tempered, unreasonable young girl, with a reserve of sufficiently
trained intelligence to marry the best our market offers&mdash;and
close her eyes;&mdash;a thoroughbred with the caprices of one, but
also with the grafted instinct for proper mating."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right, isn't it?" asked Ferrall. "That's the
way I size her up. Isn't it correct?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in a way. She has all the expensive training of the thoroughbred&mdash;and
all the ignorance, too. She is cold-blooded because wholesome;
a trifle sceptical because so absolutely unawakened. She never
experienced a deep emotion. Impulses have intoxicated her once
or twice&mdash;as when she asked my opinion about running off with
Cavendish, and that boy and girl escapade with Rivington; nothing
at all except high mettle, the innocent daring lurking in all
thoroughbreds, and a great deal of very red blood racing through
that superb young body. But," Ferrall reined in to listen, "but
if ever a man awakens her &mdash;I don't care who he is&mdash;you'll
see a girl you never knew, a brand-new creature emerge with the
last rags and laces of conventionality dropping from her; a woman,
Kemp, heiress to every generous impulse, every emotion, every
vice, every virtue of all that brilliant race of hers."</p>

<p>"You seem to know," he said, amused and curious.</p>

<p>"I know. Major Belwether told me that he had thought of Howard
as an anchor for her. It seemed a pity &mdash;Howard with all
his cold, heavy negative inertia. … I said I'd do it. I did. And
now I don't know; I wish, almost wish I hadn't."</p>

<p>"What has changed your ideas?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Howard is safer than Stephen Siward, already in
the first clutches of his master-vice. Would you mate what she
inherits from her mother and her mother's mother, with what is
that poor boy's heritage from the Siwards?"</p>

<p>"After all," observed Ferrall dryly, "we're not in the angel-breeding
business."</p>

<p>"We ought to be. Every decent person ought to be. If they were,
inherited vice would be as rare in this country as smallpox!"</p>

<p>"People don't inherit smallpox, dear."</p>

<p>"Never mind! You know what I mean. In our stock farms and kennels,
we weed out, destroy, exterminate hereditary weakness in everything.
We pay the greatest attention to the production of all offspring
except our own. Look at Stephen! How dared his parents bring him
into the world? Look at Sylvia! And now, suppose they marry!"</p>

<p>"Dearest," said Ferrall, "my head is a whirl and my wits are
spinning like five toy tops. Your theories are all right; but
unless you and I are prepared to abandon several business enterprises
and take to the lecture platform, I'm afraid people are going
to be wicked enough to marry whom they like, and the human race
will he run as usual with money the favourite, and love a case
of 'also-ran.' … By the way, how dared you marry me, knowing the
sort of demon I am?"</p>

<p>The gathering frown on Mrs. Ferrall's brow faded; she raised
her clear grey eyes and met her husband's gaze, gay, humourous,
and with a hint of tenderness&mdash;enough to bring the colour into
her pretty face.</p>

<p>"You know I'm right, Kemp."</p>

<p>"Always, dear. And now that we have the world off our hands for
a few minutes, suppose we gallop?"</p>

<p>But she held her horse to a walk, riding forward, grave, thoughtful,
preoccupied with a new problem, only part of which she had told
her husband.</p>

<p>For that night she had been awakened in her bed to find standing
beside her a white, wide-eyed figure, shivering, limbs a-chill
beneath her clinging lace. She had taken the pallid visitor to
her arms and warmed her and soothed her and whispered to her,
murmuring the thousand little words and sounds, the breathing
magic mothers use with children. And Sylvia lay there, chilled,
nerveless, silent, ignorant why her sleeplessness had turned to
restlessness, to loneliness, to an awakening perception of what
she lacked and needed and began to desire. For that sad void,
peopled at intervals through her brief years with a vague mother-phantom,
had, in the new crisis of her career, become suddenly an empty
desolation, frightening her with her own utter isolation. Fill
it now she could not, now that she needed that ghost of child-comfort,
that shadowy refuge, that sweet shape she had fashioned out of
dreams to symbolise a mother she had never known.</p>

<p>Driven she knew not why, she had crept from her room in search
of the still, warm, fragrant nest and the whispered reassurance
and the caress she had never before endured. Yes, now she craved
it, invited it, longed for safe arms around her, the hovering
hand on her hair. Was this Sylvia?</p>

<p>And Grace Ferrall, clearing her sleepy eyes, amazed, incredulous
of the cold, child-like hands upon her shoulders, caught her in
her arms with a little laugh and sob and drew her to her breast,
to soothe and caress and reassure, to make up to her all she could
of what is every child's just heritage.</p>

<p>And for a long while Sylvia, lying there, told her nothing&mdash;because
she did not know how&mdash;merely a word, a restless question half
ashamed, barely enough to shadow forth the something stirring
her toward an awakening in a new world, where with new eyes she
might catch glimpses of those dim and splendidly misty visions
that float through sunlit silences when a young girl dreams awake.</p>

<p>And at length, gravely, innocently, she spoke of her engagement,
and the worldly possibilities before her; of the man she was to
marry, and her new and unexpected sense of loneliness in his presence,
now that she had seen him again after months.</p>

<p>She spoke, presently, of Siward&mdash;a fugitive question or two,
offered indifferently at first, then with shy persistence and
curiosity, knowing nothing of the senseless form flung face downward
across the sheets in a room close by. And thereafter the murmured
burden of the theme was Siward, until one, heavy eyed, turned
from the white dawn silvering the windows, sighed, and fell asleep;
and one lay silent, head half buried in its tangled gold, wide
awake, thinking vague thoughts that had no ending, no beginning.
And at last a rosy bar of light fell across the wall, and the
warm shadows faded from corner and curtain; and, turning on the
pillow, her face nestled in her hair, she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Nothing of this had Mrs. Ferrall told her husband.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life had Sylvia suffered the caresses
most women invite or naturally lavish; for the first time had
she attempted confidences, failing because she did not know how,
but curiously contented with the older woman's arms around her.</p>

<p>There was a change in Sylvia, a great change stealing in upon
her as she lay there, breathing like a child, flushed lips scarcely
parted. Through the early slanting sunlight the elder woman, leaning
on one arm, looked down at her, grey eyes very grave and tender&mdash;wise,
sweet eyes that divined with their pure clairvoyance all that
might happen or might fail to come to pass in this great change
stealing over Sylvia.</p>

<p>Nothing of this could her husband understand had she words to
convey it. There was nothing he need understand except that his
wife, meaning well, had meddled and regretted.</p>

<p>And now, turning in her saddle with a pretty gesture of her shoulders:</p>

<p>"I meddle no more! Those who need me may come to me. Now laugh
at my tardy wisdom, Kemp!"</p>

<p>"It's no laughing matter," he said, "if you're going to stand
back and let this abandoned world spin itself madly to the bow-wows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid. I repent. The mischief take Howard Quarrier!"</p>

<p>"Amen! Come on, Grace."</p>

<p>She gathered bridle. "Do you suppose Stephen Siward is going
to make trouble?"</p>

<p>"How can he unless she helps him? Nonsense! All's well with Siward
and Sylvia. Shall we gallop?"</p>

<p>All was very well with Siward and Sylvia. They had passed the
rabbit-brier country scathless, with two black mallard, a jack-snipe,
and a rabbit to the credit of their score, and were now advancing
through that dimly lit enchanted land of tall grey alders where,
in the sudden twilight of the leaves, woodcock after woodcock
fluttered upward twittering, only to stop and drop, transformed
at the vicious crack of Siward's gun to fluffy balls of feather
whirling earthward from mid-air.</p>

<p>Sagamore came galloping back with a soft, unsoiled mass of chestnut
and brown feathers in his mouth. Siward took the dead cock, passed
it back to the keeper who followed them, patted the beautiful
eager dog and signalled him forward once more.</p>

<p>"You should have fired that time," he said to Sylvia&mdash;"that is,
if you care to kill anything."</p>

<p>"But I don't seem to be able to," she said. "It isn't a bit like
shooting at clay targets. The twittering whirr takes me by surprise&mdash;it's
all so charmingly sudden&mdash;and my heart seems to stop in one beat,
and I look and look and then&mdash;whisk! the woodcock is gone, leaving
me breathless&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her voice ceased; the white setter, cutting up his ground ahead,
had stopped, rigid, one leg raised, jaws quivering and locking
alternately.</p>

<p>"Isn't that a stunning picture!" said Siward in a low voice.
"What a beauty he is&mdash;like a statue in white and blue-veined marble.
You may talk, Miss Landis; woodcock don't flush at the sound of
the human voice as grouse do."</p>

<p>"See his brown eyes roll back at us! He wonders why we don't
do something!" whispered the girl. "Look, Mr. Siward! Now his
head is moving&mdash;oh so gradually to the left!"</p>

<p>"The bird is moving on the ground," nodded Siward; "now the bird
has stopped."</p>

<p>"I do wish I could see a woodcock on the ground," she breathed.
"Do you think we might by any chance?"</p>

<p>Siward noiselessly sank to his knees and crouched, keen eyes
minutely busy among the shadowy browns and greys of wet earth
and withered leaf. And after a while, cautiously, he signalled
the girl to kneel beside him, and stretched out one arm, forefinger
extended.</p>

<p>"Sight straight along my arm," he said, "as though it were a
rifle barrel."</p>

<p>Her soft cheek rested against his shoulder; a stray strand of
shining hair brushing his face.</p>

<p>"Under that bunch of fern," he whispered; "just the colour of
the dead leaves. Do you see? … Don't you see that big woodcock
squatted flat, bill pointed straight out and resting on the leaves?"</p>

<p>After a long while she saw, suddenly, and an exquisite little
shock tightened her fingers on Siward's extended arm.</p>

<p>"Oh, the feathered miracle!" she whispered; "the wonder of its
cleverness to hide like that! You look and look and stare, seeing
it all the while and not knowing that you see it. Then in a flash
it is there, motionless, a brown-shaped shadow among shadows.
… The dear little thing! … Mr. Siward, do you think&mdash;are you going
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I won't shoot it."</p>

<p>"Thank you. … Might I sit here a moment to watch it?"</p>

<p>She seated herself soundlessly among the dead leaves; he sank
into place beside her, laying his gun aside.</p>

<p>"Rather rough on the dog," he said with a grimace.</p>

<p>"I know. It is very good of you, Mr. Siward to do this for my
pleasure. Oh&mdash;h! Do you see! Oh, the little beauty!"</p>

<p>The woodcock had risen, plumage puffed out, strutting with wings
bowed and tail spread, facing the dog. The sudden pigmy defiance
thrilled her. "Brave! Brave!" she exclaimed, enraptured; but at
the sound of her voice the bird crouched like a flash, large dark
liquid eyes shining, long bill pointed straight toward them.</p>

<p>"He'll fly the way his bill points," said Siward. "Watch!"</p>

<p>He rose; she sprang lightly to her feet; there came a whirring
flutter, a twittering shower of sweet notes, soft wings beating
almost in their very faces, a distant shadow against the sky,
and the woodcock was gone.</p>

<p>Quieting the astounded dog, gun cradled in the hollow of his
left arm, he turned to the girl beside him: "That sort of thing
wins no cups," he said.</p>

<p>"It wins something else, Mr. Siward,&mdash;my very warm regard for
you."</p>

<p>"There is no choice between that and the Shotover Cup," he admitted,
considering her.</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, vigorously!"</p>

<p>"Then you are much nicer than I thought you. … And after all,
if the price of a cup is the life of that brave little bird, I
had rather shoot clay pigeons. Now you will scorn me I suppose.
Begin!"</p>

<p>"My ideal woman has never been a life-taker," he said coolly.
"Once, when I was a boy, there was a girl&mdash;very lovely&mdash;my first
sweetheart. I saw her at the traps once, just after she had killed
her seventh pigeon straight, 'pulling it down' from overhead,
you know&mdash;very clever&mdash;the little thing was breathing on the grass,
and it made sounds&mdash;" He shrugged and walked on. "She killed her
twenty-first bird straight; it was a handsome cup, too."</p>

<p>And after a silence, "So you didn't love her any more, Mr. Siward?"&mdash;mockingly
sweet.</p>

<p>They laughed, and at the sound of laughter the tall-stemmed alders
echoed with the rushing roar of a cock-grouse thundering skyward.
Crack! Crack! Whirling over and over through a cloud of floating
feathers, a heavy weight struck the springy earth. There lay the
big mottled bird, splendid silky ruffs spread, dead eyes closing,
a single tiny crimson bead twinkling like a ruby on the gaping
beak.</p>

<p>"Dead!" said Siward to the dog who had dropped to shot; "Fetch!"
And, signalling the boy behind, he relieved the dog of his burden
and tossed the dead weight of ruffled plumage toward him. Then
he broke his gun, and, as the empty shells flew rattling backward,
slipped in fresh cartridges, locked the barrels, and walked forward,
the flush of excitement still staining his sunburnt face.</p>

<p>"You deal death mercifully," said the girl in a low voice. "I
wonder what your ci-devant sweetheart would think of you."</p>

<p>"A bungler had better stick to the traps," he assented, ignoring
the badinage.</p>

<p>"I am wondering," she said thoughtfully, "what I think of men
who kill."</p>

<p>He turned sharply, hesitated, shrugged. "Wild things' lives are
brief at best&mdash;fox or flying-tick, wet nests or mink, owl, hawk,
weasel or man. But the death man deals is the most merciful. Besides,"
he added, laughing, "ours is not a case of sweethearts."</p>

<p>"My argument is purely in the abstract, Mr. Siward. I am asking
you whether the death men deal is more justifiable than a woman's
gift of death?"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, life-taking, the giving of life&mdash;there can be only
one answer to the mystery; and I don't know it," he replied smiling.</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Tell me then," he said, still amused.</p>

<p>They had passed swale after swale of silver birches waist deep
in perfumed fern and brake; the big timber lay before them. She
moved forward, light gun swung easily across her leather-padded
shoulder; and on the wood's sunny edge she seated herself, straight
young back against a giant pine, gun balanced across her flattened
knees.</p>

<p>"You are feeling the pace a little," he said, coming up and standing
in front of her.</p>

<p>"The pace? No, Mr. Siward."</p>

<p>"Are you a trifle&mdash;bored?" She considered him in silence, then
leaned back luxuriously, rounded arms raised, wrists crossed to
pillow her head.</p>

<p>"This is charmingly new to me," she said simply.</p>

<p>"What? Not the open?"</p>

<p>"No; I have camped and done the usual roughing it with only three
guides apiece and the champagne inadequately chilled. I have endured
that sort of hardship several times, Mr. Siward. … What is that
furry hunch up there in that tall thin tree?"</p>

<p>"A raccoon," he said presently. "Can you see the foxy head peeping
so slyly down at us? Look at Sagamore nosing the air in that droll
blind mole-like way. He knows there's something furry up aloft
somewhere; and he knows it's none of his business."</p>

<p>They watched the motionless ball of fur in the crotch of a slim
forest elm. Presently it uncurled, cautiously; a fluffy ringed
tail unfolded; the rounded furry back humped up, and the animal,
moving slowly into the tangent foliage of an enormous oak, vanished
amid bronzing leafy depths.</p>

<p>In the silence the birds began to reappear. A jay screamed somewhere
deep in the yellowing woods; black-capped chickadees dropped from
twig to twig, cheeping inquiringly.</p>

<p>She sat listening, bright head pillowed in her arms, idly attentive
to his low running comment on beast and bird and tree, on forest
stillness and forest sounds, on life and the wild laws of life
and death governing the great out-world 'twixt sky and earth.
Sunlight and shadows moving, speech and silence, waxed and waned.
A listless contentment lay warm upon her, weighting the heavy
white lids. The blue of her eyes was very dark now&mdash;almost purple
like the colour of the sea when the wind-flaws turn the blue to
violet.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of the 'Lesser Children'?" she asked. "Listen
then:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Multitudes, multitudes, under the moon they stirred!<br/>
The weakerbrothers of our earthly breed;<br/>
All came about my head and at my feet<br/>
A thousand thousand sweet,<br/>
With starry eyes not even raised to plead:<br/>
Bewildered, driven, hiding, fluttering, mute!<br/>
And I beheld and saw them one by one<br/>
Pass, and become as nothing in the night.'

</p>
</div>
<p>"Do you know what it means?</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Winged mysteries of song that from the sky<br/>
Once dashed long music down&mdash;'

</p>
</div>
<p>"Do you understand?" she asked, smiling.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"'Who has not seen in the high gulf of light<br/>
What, lower, was a bird!'"

</p>
</div>
<p>She ceased, and, raising her eyes to his: "Do you know that plea
for mercy on the lesser children who die all day to-day because
the season opens for your pleasure, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Is it a woodland sermon?" he inquired, too politely.</p>

<p>"The poem? No; it is the case for the prosecution. The prisoner
may defend himself if he can."</p>

<p>"The defence rests," he said. "The prisoner moves that he be
discharged."</p>

<p>"Motion denied," she interrupted promptly.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the woodland world the crows were holding a noisy
session, and she told him that was the jury debating the degree
of his guilt.</p>

<p>"Because you're guilty of course," she continued. "I wonder what
your sentence is to be?"</p>

<p>"I'll leave it to you," he suggested lazily.</p>

<p>"Suppose I sentenced you to slay no more?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd appeal&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No use; I am the tribunal of last resort."</p>

<p>"Then I throw myself upon the mercy of the court."</p>

<p>"You do well, Mr. Siward. This court is very merciful. … How
much do you care for bird murder? Very much? Is there anything
you care for more? Yes? And could this court grant it to you in
compensation?"</p>

<p>He said, deliberately, roused by the level challenge of her gaze:
"The court is incompetent to compensate the prisoner or offer
any compromise."</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"Because the court herself is already compromised in her future
engagements."</p>

<p>"But what has my&mdash;engagement to do with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You offered compensation for depriving me of my shooting. There
could be only one adequate compensation."</p>

<p>"And that?" she asked, coolly enough.</p>

<p>"Your continual companionship."</p>

<p>"But you have it, Mr. Siward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have it for a day. The season lasts three months you know."</p>

<p>"And you and I are to play a continuous vaudeville for three
months? Is that your offer?"</p>

<p>"Partly."</p>

<p>"Then one day with me is not worth those many days of murder?"
she asked in pretended astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ask yourself why those many days would be doubly empty," he
said so seriously that the pointless game began to confuse her.</p>

<p>"Then"&mdash;she turned lightly from uncertain ground&mdash;"then perhaps
we had better be about that matter of the cup you prize so highly.
Are you ready, Mr. Siward? There is much to be killed yet&mdash;including
time, you know."</p>

<p>But the hinted sweetness of the challenge had aroused him, and
he made no motion to rise. Nor did she.</p>

<p>"I am not sure," he reflected, "just exactly what I should ask
of you if you insist on taking away&mdash;" he turned and looked about
him through the burnt gold foliage, "&mdash;if you took away all this
out of my life."</p>

<p>"I shall not take it; because I have nothing in exchange to offer
… you say," she answered imprudently.</p>

<p>"I did not say so," he retorted.</p>

<p>"You did&mdash;reminding me that the court is already engaged for
a continuous performance."</p>

<p>"Was it necessary to remind you?" he asked with deliberate malice.</p>

<p>She flushed up, vexed, silent, then looked directly at him with
beautiful hostile eyes. "What do you mean, Mr. Siward? Are you
taking our harmless, idle badinage as warrant for an intimacy
unwarranted?"</p>

<p>"Have I offended?" he asked, so impassively that a flash of resentment
brought her to her feet, angry and self-possessed.</p>

<p>"How far have we to go?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, turned, hailing the keeper, repeating the
question. And at the answer they both started forward, the dog
ranging ahead through a dense growth of beech and chestnut, over
a high brown ridge, then down, always down along a leafy ravine
to the water's edge&mdash;a forest pond set in the gorgeous foliage
of ripening maples.</p>

<p>"I don't see," said Sylvia impatiently, "how we are going to
obey instructions and go straight ahead. There must be a stupid
boat somewhere!"</p>

<p>But the game-laden keeper shook his head, pulled up his hip boots,
and pointed out a line of alder poles set in the water to mark
a crossing.</p>

<p>"Am I expected to wade?" asked the girl anxiously.</p>

<p>"This here," observed the keeper, "is one of the most sportin'
courses on the estate. Last season I seen Miss Page go through
it like a scared deer&mdash;the young lady, sir, that took last season's
cup"&mdash;in explanation to Siward, who stood doubtfully at the water's
edge, looking back at Sylvia.</p>

<p>Raising her dismayed eyes she encountered his; there was a little
laugh between them. She stepped daintily across the stones to
the water's edge, instinctively gathering her kilts in one hand.</p>

<p>"Miles and I could chair you over," suggested Siward.</p>

<p>"Is that fair&mdash;under the rules?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Miss; as long as you go straight," said the keeper.</p>

<p>So they laid aside the guns and the guide's game-sack, and formed
a chair with their hands, and, bearing the girl between them,
they waded out along the driven alder stakes, knee-deep in brown
water.</p>

<p>Before them herons rose into heavy flapping flight, broad wings
glittering in the sun; a diver, distantly afloat among the lily
pads, settled under the water to his eyes as a submarine settles
till the conning-tower is awash.</p>

<p>Her arm, lightly resting around his neck, tightened a trifle
as the water rose to his thighs; then the faint pressure relaxed
as they thrashed shoreward through the shallows, ankle deep once
more, and landed among the dry reeds on the farther bank.</p>

<p>Miles, the keeper, went back for the guns. Siward stamped about
in the sun, shaking the drops from water-proof breeches and gaiters,
only to be half drenched again when Sagamore shook himself vigorously.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Sylvia, looking sideways at Siward, "your contempt
for my sporting accomplishments has not decreased. I'm sorry;
I don't like to walk in wet shoes … even to gain your approval."</p>

<p>And, as the keeper came splashing across the shallows: "Miles,
you may carry my gun. I shall not need it any longer&mdash;"</p>

<p>The upward roar of a bevey of grouse drowned her voice; poor
Sagamore, pointing madly in the blackberry thicket all unperceived,
cast a dismayed glance aloft where the sunlit air quivered under
the winnowing rush of heavy wings. Siward flung up his gun, heading
a big quartering bird; steadily the glittering barrels swept in
the arc of fire, hesitated, wavered; then the possibility passed;
the young fellow lowered the gun, slowly, gravely; stood a moment
motionless with bent head until the rising colour in his face
had faded.</p>

<p>And that was all, for a while. The astonished and disgusted keeper
stared into the thicket; the dog lay quivering, impatient for
signal. Sylvia's heart, which had seemed to stop with her voice,
silenced in the gusty thunder of heavy wings, began beating too
fast. For the ringing crack of a gun shot could have spoken no
louder to her than the glittering silence of the suspended barrels;
nor any promise of his voice sound as the startled stillness sounded
now about her. For he had made something a trifle more than mere
amends for his rudeness. He was overdoing everything&mdash;a little.</p>

<p>He stood on the thicket's edge, absently unloading the weapon,
scarcely understanding what he had done and what he had not done.</p>

<p>A moment later a far hail sounded across the uplands, and against
the sky figures moved distantly.</p>

<p>"Alderdene and Marion Page," said Siward. "I believe we lunch
yonder, do we not, Miles?"</p>

<p>They climbed the hill in silence, arriving after a few minutes
to find others already at luncheon&mdash;the Page boys, eager, enthusiastic,
recounting adventure by flood and field; Rena Bonnesdel tired
and frankly bored and decorated with more than her share of mud;
Eileen Shannon, very pretty, very effective, having done more
execution with her eyes than with the dainty fowling-piece beside
her.</p>

<p>Marion Page nodded to Sylvia and Siward with a crisp, business-like
question or two, then went over to inspect their bag, nodding
approbation as Miles laid the game on the grass.</p>

<p>"Eight full brace," she commented. "We have five, and an odd
cock-pheasant&mdash;from Black Fells, I suppose. The people to our
left have been blazing away like Coney Island, but Rena's guide
says the ferns are full of rabbits that way, and Major Belwether
can't hit fur afoot. You,"  she added frankly to Siward, "ought
to take the cup. The birches ahead of you are full of woodcock.
If you don't, Howard Quarrier will. He's into a flight of jack-snipe
I hear."</p>

<p>Siward's eyes had suddenly narrowed; then he laughed, patting
Sagamore's cheeks. "I don't believe I shall shoot very steadily
this afternoon,"  he said, turning toward the group at luncheon
under the trees. "I wish Quarrier well&mdash;with the cup."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Marion Page curtly; "you are the cleanest shot
I ever knew." And she raised her glass to him, frankly, and emptied
it with the precision characteristic of her: "Your cup! With all
my heart!"</p>

<p>"I also drink to your success, Mr. Siward," said Sylvia in a
low voice, lifting her champagne glass in the sunlight. "To the
Shotover Cup&mdash;if you wish it." And as other glasses sparkled aloft
amid a gay tumult of voices wishing him success, Sylvia dropped
her voice, attuning it to his ear alone: "Success for the cup,
if you wish it&mdash;or, whatever you wish&mdash;success!" and she meant
it very kindly.</p>

<p>His hand resting on his glass he sat, smiling silent acknowledgment
to the noisy generous toasts; he turned and looked at Sylvia when
her low voice caught his ear&mdash;looked at her very steadily, unsmiling.</p>

<p>Then to the others, brightening again, he said a word or two,
wittily, with a gay compliment well placed and a phrase to end
it in good taste. And, in the little gust of hand-clapping and
laughter, he turned again to Sylvia, smilingly, saying under his
breath: "As though winning the cup could compensate me now for
losing it!"</p>

<p>She leaned involuntarily nearer: "You mean that you will not
try for it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That is not fair&mdash;to me!"</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because I do not ask it of you."</p>

<p>"You need not, now that I know your wish."</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward, <em>I&mdash;</em>my wish&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she had no chance to finish; already Rena Bonnesdel was looking
at them, and there was a hint of amused surprise in Eileen Shannon's
mischievous eyes, averted instantly, with malicious ostentation.</p>

<p>Then Marion Page took possession of him so exclusively, so calmly,
that something in her cool certainty vaguely irritated Sylvia,
who had never liked her. Besides, the girl showed too plainly
her indifference to other people; which other people seldom find
amusing.</p>

<p>"Stephen," called out Alderdene, anxiously counting the web loops
in his khaki vest, "what do you call fair shooting at these damnable
ruffed grouse? You needn't be civil about it, you know."</p>

<p>"Five shells to a bird is good shooting," answered Siward. "Don't
you think so, Miss Page?"</p>

<p>"You have a better score, Mr. Siward," said Marion Page with
a hostile glance at Alderdene, who had not made good.</p>

<p>"That was chance&mdash;and this year's birds. I've taken ten shells
to an old drummer in hard wood or short pines." He smiled to himself,
adding: "A drove of six in the open got off scot free a little
while ago. Miss Landis saw it."</p>

<p>That he was inclined to turn it all to banter relieved her at
once. "It was pitiable," she nodded gravely to Marion; "his nerve
left him when they made such a din in the briers."</p>

<p>Miss Page glanced at her indifferently.</p>

<p>"What I need is practice like the chasseurs of Tarascon," admitted
Siward.</p>

<p>"I willingly offer my hat, monsieur," said Sylvia.</p>

<p>Marion Page, impatient to start, had turned her tailor-made back
to the company, and was instructing his crestfallen lordship very
plainly: "You fire too quickly, Blinky; two seconds is what you
must count when a grouse flushes. You must say 'Mark! Right!'
or 'Mark! Left! Bang!'"</p>

<p>"I might as well say 'Bang!' for all I've done to-day," he muttered,
adjusting his shooting-goggles and snapping his eyes like fury.
Then exploding into raucous laughter he moved off southward with
Marion Page, who had exchanged a swift handshake with Siward;
the twins followed, convoying Eileen and Rena, neither maiden
excitedly enthusiastic. And so the luncheon party, lord and lady,
twins and maidens, guides and dogs, trailed away across the ridge,
distant silhouettes presently against the sky, then gone. And
after a little while the far, dry, accentless report of smokeless
powder announced that the opening of the season had been resumed
and the Lesser Children were dying fast in the glory of a perfect
day.</p>

<p>"Are you ready, Mr. Siward?" She stood waiting for him at the
edge of the thicket; Miles resumed his game sack and her fowling-piece;
the dog came up, looking him anxiously in the eyes.</p>

<p>So he walked forward beside her into the dappled light of the
thicket.</p>

<p>Within a few minutes the dog stood twice; and twice the whirring
twitter of woodcock startled her, echoed by the futile crack of
his gun.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miles," with a glint of humour.</p>

<p>"Overshot, sir,&mdash;excusin' the liberty, Mr. Siward. Both marked
down forty yard to the left if you wish to start 'em again."</p>

<p>"No," he said indifferently, "I had my chance at them. They're
exempt."</p>

<p>Then Sagamore, tail wildly whipping, came smack on the trail
of an old stager of a cock-grouse&mdash;on, on over rock, log, wet
gully, and dry ridge, twisting, doubling, circling, every wile,
every trick employed and met, until the dog crawling noiselessly
forward, trembled and froze, and Siward, far to left, wheeled
at the muffled and almost noiseless rise. For an instant the slanting
barrels wavered, grew motionless; but only a stray sunbeam glinting
struck a flash of cold fire from the muzzle, only the feathery
whirring whisper broke the silence of suspense. Then far away
over sunny tree tops a big grouse sailed up, rocketing into the
sky on slanted wings, breasting the height of green; dipped, glided
downward with bowed wings stiffened, and was engulfed in the misty
barriers of purpling woods.</p>

<p>"Vale!" said Siward aloud, "I salute you!"</p>

<p>He came strolling back across the crisp leaves, the dappled sunshine
playing over his face like the flicker of a smile.</p>

<p>"Miles," he said, "my nerve is gone. Such things happen. I'm
all in. Come over here, my friend, and look at the sun with me."</p>

<p>The discomfited keeper obeyed.</p>

<p>"Where ought that refulgent luminary to scintilate when I face
Osprey Ledge?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"The sun. How do I hold it?"</p>

<p>"On the p'int of your right shoulder, sir. &mdash;You ain't quittin',
Mr. Siward, sir!" anxiously; "that Shotover Cup is easy yours,
sir!"  eagerly; "Wot's a miss on a old drummer, Mr. Siward? Wot's
twice over-shootin' cock, sir, when a blind dropper can see you
are the cleanest, fastest, hard-shootin' shot in the null county!"</p>

<p>But Siward shook his head with an absent glance at the dog, and
motioned the astonished keeper forward.</p>

<p>"Line the easiest trail for us," he said; "I think we are already
a trifle tired. Twigs will do in short cover; use a hatchet in
the big timber. … And go slow till we join you."</p>

<p>And when the unwilling and perplexed keeper had started, Siward,
unlocking his gun, drew out the smooth yellow cartridges and pocketed
them.</p>

<p>Sylvia looked up as the sharp metallic click of the locked breech
rang out in the silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you do this, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; really I am honest; I don't know."</p>

<p>"It could not be because I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, of course not," he said, too seriously to reassure her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward," in quick displeasure.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"What you do for your amusements cannot concern me."</p>

<p>"Right as usual," he said so gaily that a reluctant smile trembled
on her lips.</p>

<p>"Then why have you done this? It is unreasonable&mdash;if you don't
feel as I do about killing things that are having a good time
in the world."</p>

<p>He stood silent, absently looking at the fowling-piece cradled
in his left arm. "Shall we sit here a moment and talk it over?"
he suggested listlessly.</p>

<p>Her blue gaze swept him; his vague smile was indifferently bland.</p>

<p>"If you are determined not to shoot, we might as well start for
Osprey Ledge," she suggested; "otherwise, what reason is there
for our being here together, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>Awaiting his comment&mdash;perhaps expecting a counter-proposition&mdash;she
leaned against the tree beside which he stood. And after a while,
as his absent-minded preoccupation continued:</p>

<p>"Do you think the leaves are dry enough to sit on?"</p>

<p>He slipped off his shooting-coat and placed it at the base of
the tree. She waited for a second, uncertain how to meet an attitude
which seemed to take for granted matters which might, if discussed,
give her at least the privilege of yielding. However, to discuss
a triviality meant forcing emphasis where none was necessary.
She seated herself; and, as he continued to remain standing, she
stripped off her shooting-gloves and glanced up at him inquiringly:
"Well, Mr. Siward, I am literally at your feet."</p>

<p>"Which redresses the balance a little," he said, finding a place
near her.</p>

<p>"That is very nice of you. Can I always count on you for civil
platitudes when I stir you out of your day-dreams?"</p>

<p>"You can always count on stirring me without effort."</p>

<p>"No, I can't. Nobody can. You are never to be counted on; you
are too absent-minded. Like a veil you wrap yourself in a brown
study, leaving everybody outside to consider the pointed flattery
of your withdrawal. What happens to you when you are inside that
magic veil? Do you change into anything interesting?"</p>

<p>He sat there, chin propped on his linked fingers, elbows on knees;
and, though there was always the hint of a smile in his pleasant
eyes, always the indefinable charm of breeding in voice and attitude,
something now was lacking. And after a moment she concluded that
it was his attention. Certainly his wits were wool-gathering again;
his eyes, edged with the shadow of a smile, saw far beyond her,
far beyond the sunlit shadows where they sat.</p>

<p>In his preoccupation she had found him negatively attractive.
She glanced at him now from time to time, her eyes returning always
to the beauty of the subdued light where all about them silver-stemmed
birches clustered like slim shining pillars, crowned with their
autumn canopy of crumpled gold.</p>

<p>"Enchantment!" she said under her breath. "Surely an enchanted
sleeper lies here somewhere."</p>

<p>"You," he observed, "unawakened."</p>

<p>"Asleep? I?" She looked around at him. "You are the dreamer here.
Your eyes are full of dreaming even now. What is your desire?"</p>

<p>He leaned on one arm, watching her; she had dropped her ungloved
hand, searching among the newly fallen gold of the birch leaves
drifted into heaps. On the third finger a jewel glittered; he
saw it, conscious of its meaning&mdash;but his eyes followed the hand
idly heaping up autumn gold, a white slim hand, smoothly fascinating.
Then the little, restless hand swept near to his, almost touching
it; and then instinctively he took it in his own, curiously, lifting
it a little to consider its nearer loveliness. Perhaps it was
the unexpectedness of it, perhaps it was sheer amazement that
left her hand lying idly relaxed like a white petalled blossom
in his. His bearing, too, was so blankly impersonal that for a
moment the whole thing appeared inconsequent. Then, as her hand
lay there, scarcely imprisoned, their eyes encountered,&mdash;and hers,
intensely blue now, considered him without emotion, studied him
impersonally without purpose, incuriously acquiescent, indifferently
expectant.</p>

<p>After a little while the consciousness of the contact disconcerted
her; she withdrew her fingers with an involuntary shiver.</p>

<p>"Is there no chance?" he asked.</p>

<p>Perplexed with her own emotion, the meaning of his low-voiced
question at first escaped her; then, like its own echo, came ringing
back in her ears, re-echoed again as he repeated it:</p>

<p>"Is there no chance for me, Miss Landis?"</p>

<p>The very revulsion of self-possession returning chilled her;
then anger came, quick and hot; then pride. She deliberated, choosing
her words coolly enough: "What chance do you mean, Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"A fighting chance. Can you give it to me?"</p>

<p>"A fighting chance? For what?"&mdash;very low, very dangerous.</p>

<p>"For you."</p>

<p>Then, in spite of her, her senses became unsteady; a sudden ringing
confusion seemed to deafen her, through which his voice, as if
very far away, sounded again:</p>

<p>"Men who are worth a fighting chance ask for it sometimes&mdash;but
take it always. I take it."</p>

<p>Her pallor faded under the flood of bright colour; the blue of
her eyes darkened ominously to velvet.</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward," she said, very distinctly and slowly, "I am not&mdash;even&mdash;sorry&mdash;for
you."</p>

<p>"Then my chance is desperate indeed," he retorted coolly.</p>

<p>"Chance! Do you imagine&mdash;" Her anger choked her.</p>

<p>"Are you not a little hard?" he said, paling under his tan. "I
supposed women dismissed men more gently&mdash;even such a man as I
am."</p>

<p>For a full minute she strove to comprehend.</p>

<p>"Such a man as you!" she repeated vaguely; "you mean&mdash;" a crimson
wave dyed her skin to the temples and she leaned toward him in
horror-stricken contrition; "I didn't mean that, Mr. Siward! I
&mdash;I never thought of that! It had no weight, it was not in
my thoughts. I meant only that you had assumed what is unwarranted&mdash;that
you&mdash;your question humiliated me, knowing that I am engaged&mdash;knowing
me so little&mdash;so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew everything. Ask yourself why I risk everything to
say this to you? There can be only one answer."</p>

<p>Then after a long silence: "Have I ever&mdash;" she began tremblingly&mdash;"ever
by word or look&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Have I even&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. I've simply discovered how I feel. That's what I was dreaming
about when you asked me. I was afraid I might do this too soon;
but I meant to do it anyway before it became too late."</p>

<p>"It was too late from the very moment we met, Mr. Siward." And,
as he reddened painfully again, she added quickly: "I mean that
I had already decided. Why will you take what I say so dreadfully
different from the way I intend it? Listen to me. I &mdash;I believe
I am not very experienced yet; I was a&mdash;astonished&mdash;quite stunned
for a moment. Then it hurt me&mdash;and I said that I was not sorry
for you … I am sorry, now."</p>

<p>And, as he said nothing: "You were a little rough, a little sudden
with me, Mr. Siward. Men have asked me that question&mdash;several
times; but never so soon, so unreasonably soon&mdash;never without
some preliminary of some sort, so that I could foresee, be more
or less prepared. … But you gave me no warning. <em>I&mdash;</em>if
you had, I would have known how to be gentle. I &mdash;I wish
to be now. I like you&mdash;enough to say this to you, enough to be
seriously sorry; if I could bring myself to really believe this&mdash;feeling&mdash;"</p>

<p>Still he said nothing; he sat there listlessly studying the sun
spots glowing, waxing, waning on the carpet of dead leaves at
his feet.</p>

<p>"As for&mdash;what you have said," she added, a little smile curving
the sensitive mouth, "it is impulsive, unconsidered, a trifle
boyish, Mr. Siward. I pay myself the compliment of your sincerity;
it is rather nice to be a girl who can awaken the romance in a
man within a day or two's acquaintance. … And that is all it is&mdash;a
romantic impulse with a pretty girl. You see I am frank; I am
really glad that you find me attractive. Tell me so, if you wish.
We shall not misunderstand each other again. Shall we?"</p>

<p>He raised his head, considering her, forcing the smile to meet
her own.</p>

<p>"We shall be better friends than ever," she asserted confidently.</p>

<p>"Yes, better than ever."</p>

<p>"Because what you have done means the nicest sort of friendship,
you see. You can't escape its duties and responsibilities now,
Mr. Siward. I shall expect you to spend the greater part of your
life in devotedly doing things for me. Besides, I am now privileged
to worry you with advice. Oh, you have invested me with all sorts
of powers now!"</p>

<p>He nodded.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet, flushed, smiling, a trifle excited.</p>

<p>"Is it all over, and are we the very ideals of friends?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"The very ideals."</p>

<p>"You are nice!" she said impulsively, holding out both gloveless
hands. He held them, she looking at him very sweetly, very confidently.</p>

<p>"Allons! Without malice?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Without malice."</p>

<p>"Without afterthoughts?"</p>

<p>"Without afterthoughts."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you are content?" persuasively.</p>

<p>"Of course not," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you must be."</p>

<p>"I must be," he repeated obediently.</p>

<p>"And you are! Say it!"</p>

<p>"But it does not make me unhappy not to be contented&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say it, please; or&mdash;do you desire me to be unhappy?"</p>

<p>Her small, smooth hands lying between his, they stood confronting
one another in the golden light. She might easily have brought
the matter to an end; and why she did not, she knew no more than
a kitten waking to consciousness under its first caress.</p>

<p>"Say it," she repeated, laughing uncertainly back into his smiling
eyes of a boy.</p>

<p>"Say what?"</p>

<p>"That you are contented."</p>

<p>"I can't."</p>

<p>"Mr. Siward, it is unkind, it is shameless&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it; I am that sort."</p>

<p>"Then I am sorry for you. Look at that!" turning her left hand
in his so that the jewel on the third finger caught the light.</p>

<p>"I see it."</p>

<p>"And yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And yet."</p>

<p>"That," she observed with composure, "is sheer obstinacy. … Isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It is what I said it was: a hopeful discontent."</p>

<p>"How can it be?" impatiently now, for the long, unaccustomed
contact was unnerving her&mdash;yet she made no motion to withdraw
her hands. "How can you really care for me? Do you actually believe
that&mdash;devotion&mdash;comes like that?"</p>

<p>"Exactly like that."</p>

<p>"So suddenly? It is impossible!" with a twist of her pretty shoulders.</p>

<p>"How did it come&mdash;to you?" he asked between his teeth.</p>

<p>Then her face grew scarlet and her eyes grew dark, and her hands
contracted in his&mdash;tightened, twisted fingers entangled, until,
with a little sob, she swayed toward him and he caught her. An
instant, a minute&mdash;more, perhaps, she did not know&mdash;she half lay
in his arms, her untaught lips cold against his. Lassitude, faint
consciousness, then tiny shock on shock came the burning revulsion;
and her voice came back, too, sounding strangely to her, a colourless,
monotonous voice.</p>

<p>He had freed her; she remembered that somebody had asked him
to&mdash;perhaps herself. That was well; she needed to breathe, to
summon strength and common-sense, find out what had been done,
what reasonless madness she had committed in the half-light of
the silver-stemmed trees clustering in shameful witness on every
hand.</p>

<p>Suddenly the hot humiliation of it overwhelmed her, and she covered
her face with her hands, standing, almost swaying, as wave on
wave of incredulous shame seemed to sweep her from knee to brow.
That phase passed after a while; out of it she emerged, flushed,
outwardly composed, into another phase, in full self-possession
once more, able to understand what had happened without the disproportion
of emotional exaggeration. After all, she had only been kissed.
Besides she was a novice, which probably accounted, in a measure,
for the unreasonable emotion coincident with a caress to which
she was unaccustomed. Without looking up at him she found herself
saying coolly enough to surprise herself: "I never supposed I
was capable of that. It appears that I am. I haven't anything
to say for myself … except that I feel fearfully humiliated. …
Don't say anything now … I do not blame you, truly I do not. It
was contemptible of me&mdash;to do it&mdash;wearing this&mdash;" she stretched
out her slender left hand, not looking at him; "it was contemptible!"
… She slowly raised her eyes, summoning all her courage to face
him.</p>

<p>But he only saw in the pink confusion of her lovely face the
dawning challenge of a coquette saluting her adversary in gay
acknowledgment of his fleeting moment of success. And as his face
fell, then hardened into brightness, instantly she divined how
he rated her, and in a flash realized her weapons and her security,
and that the control of the situation was hers, not in the control
of this irresolute young man who stood so silently considering
her. Strange that she should be ashamed of her own innocence,
willing that he believe her accomplished in such arts, enchanted
that he no longer perhaps suspected genuine emotion in the swift,
confused sweetness of her first kiss. If only all that were truly
hidden from him, if he dare not in his heart convict her of anything
save perfection in a gay, imprudent rôle, what a weight lifted,
what relief, what hot self-contempt cooled! What vengeance, too,
she would take on him for the agony of her awakening&mdash;the dazed
chagrin, the dread of his wise, amused eyes&mdash;eyes that she feared
had often looked upon such scenes; eyes no doubt familiar with
such unimportant details as the shamed demeanour of a novice.</p>

<p>"Why do you take it so seriously?" she said, laughing and studying
him, certain now of herself in this new disguise.</p>

<p>"Do you take it lightly?" he asked, striving to smile.</p>

<p>"I? Ah, I must, you know. You don't expect to marry me … do you,
Mr. Siward?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;" </em>He choked up at that, grimly for a while.</p>

<p>Walking slowly forward together she fell into step frankly beside
him, near him&mdash;too near. "Try to be sensible," she was saying
gaily; "I like you so much&mdash;and it would be horrid to have you
mope, you know. And besides, even if I cared for you, there are
reasons, you know&mdash;reasons for any girl to marry the man I am
going to marry. Does my cynicism shock you? What am I to do?"
with a shrug. "Such marriages are reasonable, and far likelier
to be agreeable than when fancy is the sole motive&mdash;certainly
far more agreeable than an ill-considered yielding to abstract
emotion with nothing concrete in view. … So, you see, I could
not marry you even if <em>I&mdash;" </em>her voice was inclined to
tremble, but she controlled it. Would she never learn her rôle?
"even if I loved you&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then her tongue stumbled and was silent; and they walked on,
side by side, through the fading splendour of the year, exchanging
no further speech.</p>

<p>Toward sunset their guide hailed them, standing high among the
rocks, a silhouette against the sky. And beyond him they saw the
poles crowned with the huge nests of the fish-hawks, marking the
last rendezvous at Osprey Ledge.</p>

<p>She turned to him as they started up the last incline, thanking
him in a sweet, natural voice for his care of her&mdash;quite innocently&mdash;until
in the questioning, unconvinced gaze that met hers she found her
own eyes softening and growing dim; and she looked away suddenly,
lest he read her ere she had dared turn the first page in the
book of self&mdash;ere she had studied, pried, probed among the pages
of a new chapter whose familiar title, so long meaningless to
her, had taken on a sudden troubling significance. And for the
first time in her life she glanced uneasily at the new page in
the book of self, numbered according to her years with the figures
23, and headed with the unconvincing chapter title, "Love."</p>
