If it were done, when 'tis done, then 'twere well<br/>
It were done quickly.<br/>
&mdash;<em>MACBETH</em>.

</p>
</div>
<p>"Quick, boys, and be careful that they don't see your heads."</p>

<p>Four men were moving along under the bank of the Miami, with
their bodies bent, at a gait that was almost rapid enough to be
called a run. They were constantly raising their heads and peering
over the bank, as though watching something in the wood, which
in this section was quite open. All four were attired in the garb
of hunters, and were evidently men whose homes were in the great
wilderness. They had embrowned faces, and sinewy limbs, and the
<em>personnel</em> of the woodman&mdash;of the men who hovered only
upon the confines of civilization, rarely, if ever, venturing
within the crowded city or village. It is hardly necessary to
say that each carried his rifle and his hunting-knife.</p>

<p>Between the three foremost was a striking resemblance; it appeared
impossible that more than five years divided them in age. Two
were brothers, George and Lewis Dernor, while the third answered
to the <em>sobriquet</em> of Dick&mdash;his real name being Richard
Allmat. The fourth&mdash;he who brought up the rear&mdash;possessed an individuality
which must have marked him in any situation. Barely more than
five feet in height, and with bowed legs, instead of owning a
jovial temper, as one would have a right to expect from his jolly-looking
face, he was, in reality, a most irascible fellow. Never known
to express satisfaction at any occurrence, gift or suggestion,
he was constantly finding fault, and threatening dire vengeance
upon those who surrounded him. These threats never being carried
out, attracted little attention. "Tom" (as he was called) was
considered a privileged individual, and, in spite of his disposition,
was a favorite with those who knew him. This may seem strange
when we add that, in addition to his sour temper, the natural
defect of his legs prevented him from placing any dependence upon
them. At his best speed he was but an ordinary runner. A stranger
well might wonder that he should adopt a life where fleetness
of foot was so necessary&mdash;in fact, so almost indispensable. Tom
O'Hara turned ranger from pure love for the wild, adventurous
life; and, despite the natural defects to which we have referred,
possessed accomplishments that rendered him a most valuable ally
and companion. He never had met his superior with the rifle, and
his knowledge of woodcraft was such that, although he had spent
ten years on the border, his slowness of foot had never operated
against him; nor once had he been outwitted by the red-men of
the woods. Besides this, he had the enviable reputation of being
a <em>lucky individual</em>&mdash;one whose rifle never missed fire,
or sped wide of its mark&mdash;one to whom no unfortunate accident
over occurred; so that, take him all in all, few hunters were
safer in the wood than this same Tom O'Hara.</p>

<p>These four were known as the <em>Riflemen of the Miami</em>,
of whom Lewis Dernor was the leader. Another member, then a long
way off, will be referred to hereafter.</p>

<p>"Quick, boys, and be careful that they don't see your heads,"
admonished Lewis, ducking his own and gesticulating to those behind
him. "<em>Sh!</em> look quick! there they go!"</p>

<p>The four stretched their necks, glancing over the bank, out into
a small clearing in the wood.</p>

<p>"They'll cross that in a minute," whispered the first speaker.
"Don't raise your heads too high or you'll be seen."</p>

<p>"You don't appear to think nobody knows nothing but you," growled
Tom, with a savage look.</p>

<p>"<em>Quiet!</em> There they go!"</p>

<p>One Indian strode into the clearing, followed by another, then
by two abreast, between whom a woman was walking, her head bent
as if in despair, with steps painful and labored. Behind these
came three other savages. They passed across the clearing&mdash;the
whole seven, with their captive like the moving figures in a panorama,
and entered the wood upon the opposite side.</p>

<p>"Every mother's son of them is in his war-paint," said Lewis&mdash;who,
by the way, divided his words with Tom, the other two rarely speaking
except when directly appealed to.</p>

<p>"Who said they wasn't?" demanded Tom. "And what difference does
it make? They've got somebody's gal there, hain't they? eh? Say.
And what's the odds whether they've daubed themselves up with
their stuff or not?"</p>

<p>"Well, what's the next move? To set up a yell and pitch after
them?"</p>

<p>"None but a fool would want to do that."</p>

<p>"But don't you notice the bank gets so low down yonder that it
won't hide us, and we'll have to show ourselves?"</p>

<p>"It'll hide us as long as we want to be hid. Come, don't squat
here, or we'll let the rascals slip, after all."</p>

<p>Again the three moved down the bank, as rapidly, silently and
cautiously as spirits, ever and anon raising their heads as they
gained a glimpse of the Indians passing through the wood. The
latter were following a course parallel with the Miami, so that
the relative distance between the two parties remained nearly
the same. It was manifest to the hunters that the Indians intended
crossing the river with their captive at some point lower down,
and were making toward that point. It was further evident from
the deliberation in their movements, and from the fact that they
were not proceeding in "Indian file," that as yet they had no
suspicion of being pursued, although every one of their number
knew of the existence of the Riflemen of the Miami&mdash;that formidable
confederation whose very name was a word of terror even to their
savage hearts. Entirely unsuspicious of the danger which menaced
them, every thing was in favor of the hunters.</p>

<p>For several hundred yards further, the two parties maintained
their relative distance, the Indians proceeding at a usual walk,
and the whites at a very irregular one&mdash;now running rapidly a
few steps, and then halting and gazing over the bank to ascertain
the precise whereabouts of their enemies; then skulking a few
yards further, and halting as before, remaining all the time nearly
opposite the "braves." Suddenly the latter came to a stand.</p>

<p>"Now for a confab," said Lewis, as his companions gathered about
him. "I wonder what they are going to jabber about?"</p>

<p>"What do you want to know for, eh?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"It's pretty plain they're going to cross the river, but, confound
it, how can we tell where it's going to be done? I've told you
that the bank gets so low, just yonder, that it won't hide us
any longer."</p>

<p>"Who wants it to hide us? They intend to cross the river <em>here</em>,
and in about ten minutes, too. Just watch their actions, if you
can do it without showing your head."</p>

<p>The Indians stood together, conversing upon some point about
which there seemed a variance of opinion. Their deep, guttural,
ejaculatory words were plainly audible to the hunters, and their
gleaming, bedaubed visages were seen in all their hideous repulsiveness.
They gesticulated continually, pointing behind them in the direction
of their trail, and across the river, over the heads of the crouching
Riflemen, who were watching every motion. Nothing would have been
easier for the latter than to have sent four of these savages
into eternity without a moment's warning; yet, nothing was further
from their intentions, for, of all things, this would have been
the surest to defeat their chief object. The captive would have
been brained the instant the savages saw they could not hold her.
The great point was to surprise them so suddenly and completely
as to prevent this.</p>

<p>From the present appearance of matters, this seemed not very
difficult of accomplishment, as it was a foregone conclusion upon
the part of the hunters that the savages would endeavor to ford
the river at the point where they lay in ambush for them. It only
remained for the Riflemen to bide their time, and, at the proper
moment, rush upon and scatter them, and rescue the captive from
their hands.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they're going to talk all day," remarked Tom,
impatiently, after they had conversed some twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

<p>"They're in a dispute about something. It won't take them long
to get through with it."</p>

<p>"How do you know that, I should like to know? Like enough they'll
talk till dark, and keep us waiting. Confound 'em, what's the
use?"</p>

<p>No one ventured to reply to Tom's sulky observation, and, after
several impatient exclamations, he added:</p>

<p>"The longer they talk the louder they get, which is a sure sign
the dispute is getting hotter, which is another sign it'll be
considerable time before they get through."</p>

<p>"I am sure we can wait as long as they can," said Dick, mildly.</p>

<p>"My heavens! who said we couldn't? Just hear 'em jabber!"</p>

<p>The conversation of the Indians had now become so earnest, that
every word spoken was distinctly heard by the Riflemen. The latter,
from the dress and actions of the savages, understood they had
no chief with them, but were merely seven warriors, who had been
out on this barbarous expedition, and were returning to their
town with the booty and the captive they had secured.</p>

<p>"They're talking in the Shawnee tongue," said Lewis. "Can't you
understand what they're driving at?"</p>

<p>"If you only keep your jaws shut a minute or two, I could; but
if you three fellers mean to talk all the time, I should like
to know how I am going to understand any thing they say. See whether
you can keep quiet a minute, just."</p>

<p>Tom's companions did as requested, while he bent his head forward,
and seemed to concentrate all his faculties into the one of listening.
Upon the part of the Riflemen all was still as death. After several
minutes of the acutest attention, Tom raised his head, and said,
with a glowing expression:</p>

<p>"They're talking about <em>us</em>."</p>

<p>"The deuce! what are they saying?"</p>

<p>"Don't you see they're pointing up the river and across it? Well,
the meaning of all that is, that they're wondering which way we'll
come from."</p>

<p>"What seems to be the general expectation?"</p>

<p>"The trouble is just there&mdash;the expectation is altogether too
general. Some think we're on their trail, others that we're following
the other side the river down, and waiting for the chance to let
drive at 'em, while one, at least, feels certain we're <em>coming
up</em> the stream to meet 'em."</p>

<p>"Is that their dispute?"</p>

<p>"A part of it, of course, but the trouble is&mdash;what to do. Some
want to strike off in the woods and take a roundabout way to reach
home; but the greatest number want to cross the stream at this
point."</p>

<p>"They'll probably do it then."</p>

<p>"Of course they will&mdash;no; I'll be shot if they ain't going further
into the woods!" suddenly exclaimed Tom.</p>

<p>"They're going to start in a minute, too. Get ready, boys, for
a rush&mdash;it's all we can do."</p>

<p>"Hold still a minute," commanded Tom, excitedly.</p>

<p>Then dropping his rifle, he ran down to the river's edge, and
picked up several large pebbles, one of which he placed in his
right hand as if about to throw it.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with that?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>"That's none of your business; you've only to wait and see. Just
keep your heads down now, if you don't want them knocked off."</p>

<p>Tom, drawing his hand back, struck it quickly against his thigh,
accomplishing what is generally termed "jerking" the stone. The
latter went circling high over the heads of the disputing Indians,
and came down upon the other side of them, cutting its way through
the dry leaves of the trees with a peculiar <em>zip-zip</em>,
which was distinctly heard by the Riflemen themselves.</p>

<p>The unusual sound could not fail instantly to attract the attention
of the Indians. They paused in their conversation, and turned
their alarmed gaze toward it, as if in expectation of some danger.
With their instinctive caution, they separated, and partially
protecting themselves behind the trees, prepared to receive what
they supposed to be their enemies. A noticeable fact did not escape
the eyes of the Riflemen. The captive, a weak, defenseless girl,
was not allowed to screen herself, as did her captors, but was
compelled by them to stand out in full view, as an additional
safeguard against their bullets.</p>

<p>It was at this moment that Tom hurled the second stone over the
heads of the Indians, it descending with the same sharp, cutting
sound, and resolving their suspicions into a certainty that their
white enemies were indeed at hand. Lewis Dernor, now that the
moment of action had arrived, was as shrewd and far-sighted as
either Tom or any of the others. It was these very qualities,
coolness and self-reliance in the crisis of danger, that made
him nominally the leader of the Riflemen of the Miami. He saw
the great advantage gained by O'Hara's artifice in attracting
the attention of the Indians to the point opposite to that from
which the peril threatened; but, at the same time, he well knew
that those same Shawnees were too well skilled in woodcraft to
suffer their gaze to be diverted for any length of time from the
river-bank.</p>

<p>As matters now stood, the captive herself was the only one who
was looking in the direction of the latter, while her gaze was
a mere mechanical one, wandering hither and thither without resting
for a moment upon any particular object. Lewis felt that the all-important
point was to make her aware of the vicinity of friends. She being
a total stranger to them, and evidently with no hope of any immediate
rescue, made this a matter of considerable difficulty; but, without
hesitating a moment, Lewis suddenly arose to the upright position,
thereby exposing his head and shoulders, and beckoned to the girl
to approach him. The instant he had done this, he dropped on his
face and disappeared.</p>

<p>The attempt was only a partial success. At the moment of rising,
the gaze of the captive was toward a point further down-stream;
but the figure of the hunter, as it rose and sunk from view, was
in her field of vision and did not entirely escape her notice.
The unusual occurrence drew her look thither, making it certain
that a second attempt, could it be made, would succeed far better
than the first. All this Lewis comprehended, and as quick as possible
repeated his movement precisely as before.</p>

<p>This time the girl saw him and perfectly understood his meaning;
but, with a precipitancy that filled the hunters with the greatest
alarm, she started directly toward them, with outstretched arms,
as if imploring assistance. It was at this instant that Lewis
discovered a quickness of perception, coolness and promptness
of action that was absolutely wonderful. Looking out upon the
exciting drama being enacted before him, he saw with unerring
certainty how far the girl could run before being fired at by
the savages. Waiting until she had gone the distance, he raised
his head and shoulders to view, and called out in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"I say, gal, drop flat on your face and stay there."</p>

<p>The quickness with which this command was obeyed, and the almost
simultaneous crack of two rifles, might well have caused the belief
that she had fallen because shot through the heart; but such was
not the case. The command of Lewis broke upon her like a thunder-peal,
and as quick as a flash of lightning did she comprehend the fearfully
imminent peril in which she was placed. So marvelously close had
been the calculation of the hunter, that at the very instant she
obeyed him, the rifle of the nearest Indian was pointed full at
her. This did not escape the eagle eye of O'Hara, who, with the
same coolness that characterized the action of his leader, discharged
his piece at the bronzed head of the Shawnee, his aim scarcely
occupying a second. The bullet sped sure, striking the savage
at the very moment his own weapon was fired, and his death-yell
mingled with the whistle of his own harmless rifle-ball.</p>

<p>Even in this moment of terrible danger, the manner in which the
Indians shifted to the opposite side of the trees could but attract
the notice of the hunters. It was simultaneous on the part of
all, and resembled that of automata, moved by machinery. First,
every copper-colored body was exposed to full view; and the next
minute six gleaming rifle-barrels only showed where they had sheltered
themselves from the fire of the whites. They no longer doubted
the point from which their danger threatened, and a genuine strategic
Indian fight now commenced.</p>

<p>Had the captive, who was now literally between two fires, done
nothing but merely fall upon her face, her situation could not
have been improved in the least thereby. But the nature of the
ground near her was such that, by lying perfectly motionless,
the bullets of the Shawnees could not strike her, unless they
could gain a position nearer to the hunters. As matters stood,
she was safe only so long as her captors could be kept from changing
their places.</p>

<p>This was manifest to both the whites and the Indians; and while
the latter were now actuated by the desire to slay the girl, the
efforts of the former were turned toward her salvation. It was
further evident that the Shawnees were aware that they were now
opposed to the Riflemen of the Miami, and were nothing loth for
a trial of skill. The loss of one of their number was such a matter
of course, that it operated only as an incentive for exertion
and skill upon their part.</p>

<p>A portion of the dress of the girl, as she lay upon the ground,
could be seen by several of the Indians, and they fired numerous
shots at it. Finding this accomplished nothing, they resorted
to a far more dangerous expedient&mdash;that of shooting away enough
earth in front of her to allow the free passage of one of their
bullets to her body. It will be seen that great skill was required
to do this, but the expertness of the Shawnee marksmen was equal
to the task. They commenced their work by sending a ball so as
to strike the earth immediately before her, and a few inches below
the surface. The instant this was done, another fired his bullet
directly after, with such skill that it varied but the fraction
of an inch from following directly in its path. The force with
which these balls were discharged was such that the twelfth one
would most assuredly take the life of the girl.</p>

<p>None knew this better than Lewis Dernor, who, in the same trumpet-like
tone that had characterized his former command, called out:</p>

<p>"Young gal, clean away the dirt in front of you and hide yourself
better, or the imps will riddle you."</p>

<p>It required no more incentive to do this, and she used her hands
with such vigor that a few moments accomplished all she could
wish. The ground, being soft and moist, favored her, and when
she dragged herself a few feet forward, all of her dress disappeared
from the view of the Indians, and she was as safe from their bullets
as if behind the river-bank itself.</p>

<p>A few more shots convinced the Shawnees of this, and they now
sent several bullets whistling over the heads of the Riflemen
as if to remind them that they were to receive attention. So long
as the members of the two parties maintained their respective
positions, this affray could amount to nothing; accordingly, several
of the savages made an effort to change their posts in such a
manner as to outflank the whites. Despite the admirable skill
with which this attempt was made, the deadly rifle of George Dernor
brought down a warrior as he flitted from tree to tree. This,
for the present, put a stop to the movement and turned the efforts
of the savages in another direction.</p>

<p>Two brawny Shawnees, convinced that nothing could be done against
the Riflemen, renewed their attempts to secure a shot at the girl,
who all this time lay as motionless as if dead. They commenced
working their way slowly but surely toward the river, while she,
unconscious of the murderous stratagem, patiently awaited the
turn of affairs which would free her from her terrible thralldom.
Finally, an Indian, who was squatted behind a tree, gained a view
of a tuft of her hair and brought his rifle to his shoulder. The
sunlight that scintillated along the barrel of his weapon made
it resemble a burnished spear, poised in his hand, while following
it up to the stock, not only his crooked arm which supported the
gun, but his entire profile was visible. Forgetting his own peril
in his anxiety to slay the helpless girl, the Shawnee leaned several
inches further forward, thereby discovering one-half of his shaven
head. Ere he could draw it back, the whip-like crack of another
rifle broke the stillness, and he fell forward on his face, pierced
through and through the brain.</p>

<p>"I've a great notion to break your head for you!" exclaimed Tom,
in an excited whisper to Dick, for it was the latter who had fired
the fatal shot.</p>

<p>"Why, what's up now?"</p>

<p>"I'd just got that Shawnee sure when you picked him off. Don't
you serve me that trick again."</p>

<p>With this ebullition, Tom subsided, and turned his attention
once more toward their common enemy.</p>

<p>The shot of Dick really decided the affray. It convinced the
Indians that not only were they unable to shoot the girl or avenge
themselves upon the Riflemen, but the latter had so much the advantage
of them, that to prolong the contest would only be to insure their
own annihilation. Three of their number were already slain, and
the remaining four, from their respective positions, had not the
shadow of a chance to pick off any of the whites. What might naturally
be expected under the circumstances occurred. The savages commenced
a retreat, conducting it with such caution that the whites could
not gain another shot. The last seen of them was a shadowy glimpse
in a distant part of the wood, as the four fled, thereby doing
only what the Riflemen of the Miami had before compelled many
a body of Indians to do.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, Lewis rose up and said:</p>

<p>"This way, gal; there's none of the imps left."</p>

<p>The girl, timidly raising her head, glanced about her, and then,
Lewis' invitation being repeated, she arose and walked toward
him, looking furtively backward as though still fearful of her
late captors.</p>

<p>"Bless your dear soul," said Lewis, warmly welcoming her, "you've
had a skeery time with them Shawnees, but you're safe for the
present. You may set that down as a question that needn't be argued."</p>

<p>"Oh! how can I thank you for rescuing me! I can never, never
repay you," said she, with streaming eyes.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce wants you to pay us?" asked Tom, gruffly.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Tom, see whether you can't be civil once, even if
you've got to be sick for it. Don't mind him, little gal; he loves
you all the more for what he said."</p>

<p>"I know he does, or he would never have risked his life to save
a stranger as he has just done."</p>

<p>Tom, from some cause or other, was obliged to gouge his eye several
times with his crooked finger. One might have suspected that they
were more moist than usual, had he not looked particularly savage
at that moment. Dick, who, by the merest accident, glanced in
his face was nearly startled off his feet by the irascible fellow
shouting:</p>

<p>"What you looking at? Say! Can't a chap rub his eyes without
your gaping at him that way?"</p>

<p>Dick meekly removed his gaze, while Tom looked ferocious enough
to annihilate the whole party.</p>

<p>The girl, just rescued from the Shawnees, was a comely maiden.
Though attired in the homespun garb of the backwoods, she would
have attracted attention in any society. If not beautiful, she
certainly was handsome, being possessed of a countenance rich
with expression, and a form of perfect grace. Blue eyes, golden
hair, a well-turned head, small nose and a health-tinted complexion,
were characteristics to arrest the eye of the most ordinary observer.
Even under disadvantageous circumstances like the present, these
were so striking that they could but make an impression, and a
skillful reader of human nature would have seen that Lewis had
been <em>touched</em>&mdash;that, in short, the leader of the Riflemen
of the Miami had reached the incipient stages of the passion of
passions, in the short interview to which we have referred. That
he would rather have been scalped than have been suspected of
it by his companions, was very true.</p>

<p>Taking the small hands which were confidingly placed in his own,
he said;</p>

<p>"Let us hear all about this scrape, my little one."</p>

<p>"My home is, or was until night before last, many miles from
here. On that evening, I was left alone by my dearest friend,
who little dreamed of the danger which hovered over our house.
The Indians must have been aware of his absence, for, before it
was fairly dark, three of them stalked in the door without saying
a word, and led me away. They have traveled constantly ever since,
and I was almost wearied to death, when you came up, and by the
assistance of kind Heaven, saved me. How came you to be so interested
in a stranger?"</p>

<p>"As for that matter," replied Lewis, "it ain't the first time,
my little one, that <em>we've</em> been interested in strangers.
I might say we've a particular interest in all the whites and
reds of this region. The Riflemen of the Miami&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Are you the men who are known by that name?" asked the girl,
with a glowing countenance.</p>

<p>"At your service," replied Lewis, with a modest blush.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have heard of you, and have heard your name blessed
again and again by the settlers further east."</p>

<p>"Which certainly is pleasant to us. As I was going to say, we
were coming down the Miami, this morning, when we chanced to strike
the trail of these identical Indians. It was easy enough to see
that it was but a short time since they had gone along, and, as
it was in our line, of course we jogged on after them. The red
imps were taking it coolly, and in a couple of hours or so we
got sight of them going down the river. Well, we followed on after
them till they made their halt out here, when&mdash;well, you know
the rest."</p>

<p>"Of course she does," said Tom, "so what's the use of talking?
What's the gal want to do? Go back to her friends, I s'pose?"</p>

<p>"If you could take me there, I could not express my thankfulness."</p>

<p>"Where is it you belong?"</p>

<p>The girl gave the name of a settlement nearly a hundred miles
distant. Lewis bent his head a moment, as if deliberating something,
and then said:</p>

<p>"We've got a job on our hands that <em>must be done</em> this
very night, and it is going to be such a lively one that it won't
do to have you in the vicinity. Consequently, although there isn't
one of us but what would risk his life to take you back to your
friends, it can't be done <em>just now</em>."</p>

<p>"You will not leave me?" plead the girl.</p>

<p>"Leave you? that's something the <em>Riflemen</em>, I make bold
to say, never did yet. No; of course we'll not <em>leave</em>
you. I'll tell you the plan. About five miles off from the river,
lives old Caleb Smith and his two big sons, all as clever and
kind as so many babies. We've got to be back at our rendezvous
to-night, where the other member of our company is to meet us;
and on our way there, we'll leave you at Old Smith's and return
for you in a few days. Won't that be the best we can do, Tom?"</p>

<p>"S'pose so."</p>

<p>The girl herself expressed great satisfaction at this conclusion;
and, as it was getting well along in the day, the Riflemen set
out with their charge. In due time they reached "Old Smith's house,"
who was well known to them, and who received them with the most
hearty cordiality. He gladly took charge of the rescued girl,
promising that she should be guarded as much as if his own child.
Just as the shadows of evening were closing over the wood, the
Riflemen took their departure.</p>

<p>Three days later they returned to fulfill their promise to the
girl, when old Smith told them that, fearing some unexpected occurrence
had detained them, he had sent his two sons to conduct her to
her home.</p>
