<p>It is not well to dwell upon the second great affliction of Tom
Gordon. He was older now than when his mother died, and though
bowed to the earth by the loss of his cherished playmate, he was
too sensible to brood over his grief. Short as had been his stay
at the home of Farmer Pitcairn, he had made friends, and they
were abundant with the best of counsel.</p>

<p>There is no remedy for mental trouble like hard work. There's
nothing the equal of it. When the dark shadow comes, apply yourself
with might and main to some duty. Do your utmost to concentrate
your thoughts, energies, and whole being upon it. Avoid sitting
down in the gloom and bemoaning your affliction. By and by it
will soften; and, relying upon the goodness of Him who doeth all
things well, you will see the kindly providence which overrules
all the affairs of this life. With the gentle poet you will be
able to murmur:&mdash;</p>

<p>Jim Travers was laid away to rest in the beautiful country cemetery
near the home of Farmer Pitcairn, and between it and the town
of Bellemore. In due time a plain, tasteful shaft was erected
to his memory, on which, below his name, date of birth and death,
were carved the expressive words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"He was a tried and true friend."</p>

<p>It took a good deal of the earnings of Tom Gordon to erect this
tribute to the departed youth. Mr. Pitcairn and his wife insisted
upon sharing a part of the expense; and the youth could not refuse
them, though he would not permit it to be more than a trifle as
compared with his own. The placing of the shaft has led me to
anticipate events somewhat.</p>

<p>Tom Gordon was approaching young manhood. He was a tall, sturdy
boy, with a fair education, and it was high time that he set to
work at the serious business of life. Providence had ordered that
he should pass through more than one stirring experience. He had
knocked about the world a good deal more than falls to the lot
of most lads of his age, and had acquired valuable knowledge.
He had learned much of the ways of men, and had undergone a schooling,
rough of itself, but fitted to qualify him for the rebuffs of
fortune to which we must all become accustomed.</p>

<p>What should he do? This was the question which he often debated
with himself, as was befitting in a sensible youth, who feared
the danger of a mistake when standing at the "crossing of the
ways."</p>

<p>Somehow he felt a strong dislike to going back to New York. He
and Jim had met with such rough treatment there that the memory
was not pleasant. His yearning was to stay in the neighborhood
of Bellemore. The soothing flow of the beautiful Hudson, the picturesque,
restful scenery, and, above all, the sweet, sad halo that lingered
around the last abiding place of his friend, held him to the spot,
which would ever be a sacred one to him.</p>

<p>He could not fancy the life of a farmer, though nothing would
have pleased Mr. Pitcairn more than to have the strong, thoughtful
boy prepare himself to become his successor in the management
of the thrifty and well-kept place. While Tom was in this state
of incertitude, Providence opened the way, as it always does to
the one who is waiting to accept the indication.</p>

<p>It was at the close of a mild day in early summer that he was
sitting on the front porch of his new home, talking with Mr. Pitcairn
and his wife, when a carriage stopped in front, and an elderly
gentleman stepped down, tied his horse, and opened the gate.</p>

<p>"Why, that's Mr. Warmore," said Farmer Pitcairn to his wife,
as he rose to greet his visitor, who walked briskly up the graveled
path.</p>

<p>The appearance of the gentleman was prepossessing. He was tall
and spare, but with a benign expression of countenance. He was
well dressed, wore gold spectacles, and his scant hair and a tuft
of whiskers on either side of his cheeks were snowy white, while
his features were regular. He must have been an unusually handsome
man in his younger days, and would still attract admiration wherever
seen.</p>

<p>He shook hands warmly with the farmer and his wife, and was introduced
to Tom, whom he treated with the same cordiality. The youth made
haste to place a chair at his disposal, for which Mr. Warmore
thanked him, and sitting down, crossed his legs, took off his
hat, and wiped his perspiring brow with his white silken handkerchief.
The chat went on in the usual way for a time, during which Tom
discovered that the visitor showed considerable interest in him.
His eyes continually turned in his direction, and he asked him
a question now and then. The youth was too modest to intrude in
the conversation, but knew how to express himself when asked to
do so.</p>

<p>By and by the questions of Mr. Warmore became quite pointed.
Once or twice Tom was disposed to resent them; but reflecting
that the gentleman was much older than he, and could have no wrong
purpose in thus probing into his personal affairs, he replied
promptly to all he asked.</p>

<p>Finally, when this had continued until it began growing dark,
Mr. Warmore said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish to hire you to enter my store, how would you like it?"</p>

<p>The question was so unexpected that Tom was fairly taken off
his feet. He replied with a pleasing laugh,&mdash;</p>

<p>"How can I answer, when I never saw you before, and have no idea
of what your business is?"</p>

<p>"True, neither of us has seen the other until to-day; but I may
say that I have heard of you from our pastor, Dr. Williams, who
conducted the services of your young friend, that was buried a
week ago."</p>

<p>"He cannot know much about me, though we have had several talks
together."</p>

<p>"He talked, too, with Mr. Pitcairn here, as I did myself."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the farmer, "he asked me many questions about you,
and so did Mr. Warmore the other day when I was in his place."</p>

<p>"I keep the largest store in Bellemore. I have kept it for forty
years, as did my father before me. It is what may be called a
combination establishment. My father started it toward the close
of the last century, when a journey to New York meant a great
deal more than it does to-day. So he tried to provide the neighbors
with everything they could need, such as dry goods, groceries,
hardware, farmers' implements, and, as I said, about all that
a large and growing family are likely to require. I have followed
in his footsteps, expanding the business, until now my clerks
and assistants number nearly a dozen. I am in need of a large,
strong, wide awake, active boy, who can write a good hand, and
who is willing to begin at the lowest round of the ladder and
work his way up."</p>

<p>It was the personality of the man, rather than the business,
which attracted Tom Gordon. He liked Mr. Warmore so well that
he secretly resolve to go with him. But the youth was not lacking
in diplomacy.</p>

<p>"How do you know I will suit you, Mr. Warmore?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't; no one can know how another will serve him until the
trial is made. You may not suit at all. Perhaps I won't keep you
beyond a week. That's a risk we must all take. I'm willing to
take it. Are <em>you</em> ready to see how you like me and the
business?"</p>

<p>"What is to be my pay?" asked Tom, still veiling his growing
inclination to accept the proposal of the merchant.</p>

<p>"Not much at first. Five dollars a week, which shall be made
six at the end of a month if you suit. An increase will be given
at the end of every half year; I don't say provided you earn it,
for, if you don't, I won't keep you. What do you say, young man?"</p>

<p>"I'll try it; when do you wish me?"</p>

<p>"To-day is Friday. Come Monday morning. Don't be later than eight
o'clock. Good-night, all."</p>

<p>Mr. Warmore had risen to his feet and raised his hat politely
to all three. The farmer, who had hardly spoken a word during
the interview, also arose and walked to the gate with his caller,
where they talked for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Yes, I like his looks," remarked the merchant in a low voice,
as he untied his horse and flung the strap under the seat. "There
is something good in his face. He looks honest; he is well put
together; he is not afraid of work. Is he fully recovered from
his injured leg?"</p>

<p>"I never saw one get well so quick. You wouldn't know that anything
had ever happened to him. Of course one would say that coming
to my house in the strange manner he did, I haven't had much chance
to judge him. That would be the case with a man, but a boy can't
play the hypocrite for long. My wife and I are very fond of him,
and he will still be able to board with us."</p>

<p>"There is no reason why he should not. It is hardly a mile from
here to the store, and it won't trouble him to walk it summer
and winter. Now and then, when we are busy, I shall have to keep
him in the evenings, but from what I hear, he has learned how
to take care of himself. Well, Joseph, we are liable to make mistakes,
and it may be we have done so in this case, but we'll chance it.
Good-night again."</p>

<p>The merchant sprang lightly into his buggy, and drove down the
road at a rapid pace, while the farmer, gazing for a moment or
two in the direction of the cloud of dust, rejoined his wife and
Tom on the porch.</p>
