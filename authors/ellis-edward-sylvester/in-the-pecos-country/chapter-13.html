<p>Immediately after the harangue of Lone Wolf a general dismounting
of the warriors followed, and the mustangs, which showed admirable
training, were left to themselves. The halt had been made where
there was grass and water, to which the animals now paid their
attention, while their owners prepared for their morning meal.</p>

<p>There was a certain system in all this apparent confusion, and,
it being known that a halt would be made at this point, a half
dozen of the most skilful hunters of the party had scattered among
the mountains in quest of game. By the time several fires were
fairly under way, these providers began dropping in, all of them
laden with spoils of the chase, which were dressed and boiling
over the different camp-fires in an incredibly short time. The
Apaches had reduced this thing to a science, and a company of
trained soldiers could not have done the thing more expeditiously
than did they.</p>

<p>While it was all going on, Fred Munson walked to the brook near
at hand, and taking a deep draught from the icy water, he stood
somewhat apart from the others, watching the proceedings with
a strange interest.</p>

<p>At first he failed to understand one thing. He knew, from what
he had seen, that at least a dozen of the Apaches had been killed,
and as many wounded, on the night before during the fight. Yet
not one of these was visible, with the exception, perhaps, of
Lone Wolf, whose scratches from Sut Simpson's bullets were of
a superficial nature. The only explanation of the absence of these
parties was that they had gone home. Under the charge of a strong
escort they had taken another route, and were probably miles away
at that moment, and most likely in their own wigwams, receiving
the nursing and attention required.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there is any chance of my getting away?" mused
the lad, as he looked searchingly about him. "If a fellow could
only get the start, there are plenty of places where he might
hide; but there's where the trouble is."</p>

<p>On the right and left of the gorge were precipitous mountains,
evidently broken by chasms, ravines, and covered with patches
of wood, their elevation being so moderate that no snow was visible
upon their tops, while the scene was wild and forbidding in the
extreme.</p>

<p>"If I were only up there," sighed Fred, as he looked at the mountain
side, "I could crawl into some of the places, where I'm sure they
couldn't find any signs of me."</p>

<p>This might all be, provided the lad had an hour or two in which
to hunt his hiding place, but the whole difficulty lay in getting
that opportunity. It was not to be supposed that the Apaches were
so stupid as to give a young captive like him a chance to slip
from their hands in broad daylight. They were too shrewd for that
and Fred felt that he must wait for some better opportunity than
the present.</p>

<p>The meat was prepared in short order, and then the Apaches fell-to
like so many wild beasts, using only their fingers and teeth.
A large quantity of food was provided, and the redskins were rapidly
disposing of it, when the lad saw that no one was likely to offer
him any, and he struck in and helped himself.</p>

<p>This morning halt of the war-party lasted about an hour, during
which Fred felt that there was little attention being paid him.
Considerable earnest talk was indulged in by the warriors, who
were apparently discussing some important plans with Lone Wolf,
the whole thing resolving itself into a sort of council of war.
When they leaped upon the backs of their mustangs, the decision
had been made, and preparations made for carrying it out without
delay.</p>

<p>The whole party started up the gorge, Fred riding again with
the Apache Apollo, Waukko, while Lone Wolf kept himself at the
head of the force.</p>

<p>"I thought he would be mad enough to kill me," mused the boy,
as he caught sight of the notorious chief, "for the reason that
I gave him such a scare night before last. It can't be that he
has forgotten it or that he doesn't know who I am; but maybe he
is going to do something dreadful to me after he gets me home."</p>

<p>What the real purpose of Lone Wolf was could only be conjectured;
but there was reason to believe that he meant to hold his prisoner
for a ransom, as the aboriginal scamp was very partial to that
kind of business. By carrying the lad back among the mountains,
he could hold him against the army of the United States, utterly
refusing to yield him up until he should receive his price.</p>

<p>The mustangs galloped along at an easy gait, for a mile or so,
when the canon, or gorge, divided in a manner precisely like that
which is frequently observed in the highways or streets of a city.
Lone Wolf instantly turned the head of his mustang to the left,
and, without checking him in the least, continued at a sweeping
gallop in that direction, followed by all of his warriors, save
three.</p>

<p>These were Waukko and two companions scarcely less repulsive
in appearance, who wheeled their steeds to the right. Without
any exchange of word or signal, they sped down the ravine and
in less than a minute the two parties were lost to sight of each
other.</p>

<p>What this meant was a mystery as baffling as the other, but Fred
concluded that Lone Wolf had gone in quest of some other party
of his warriors, and had sent Waukko and his two companions as
an escort to conduct him to some place where he would be beyond
all danger of rescue. The shrewd Apache chief, in doing this,
only acted with ordinary discretion.</p>

<p>He knew Sut Simpson through and through, and had not a particle
of doubt that the hunter was already on their track, and that
he would use every exertion to recover the lad. Hence the most
important thing to do was to get forward without any loss of time.
He had a full night's start of the scout, who could only press
his pursuit by daylight, when the trail was visible, and there
was no reason why the three men who had the lad in charge should
allow the fleetest-footed mustang to catch up with them.</p>

<p>Fred, as may be supposed, was gratified to find his companions
so suddenly and greatly reduced in number, for it seemed to him
at once that his chances of escape were increased tenfold. It
simplified matters. It did not occur to him that three vigilant
Indians were as effective as three hundred, and that in a certain
sense his prospect of deliverance was diminished rather than increased.
He was a boy and as hopeful as his years.</p>

<p>The day remained sunshiny and pleasant, and the easy canter of
the mustangs caused just enough breeze to make the riding delightful.
Fred felt an unconquerable aversion to the Apache Waukko, whose
horrible face and appearance caused him more than once to half
suspect that he was a ghoul or demon. He again made an attempt
to open communication with him, but he uttered a sort of grunt
that Fred took as a command for silence, and he resolved that
he would die before he would repeat the attempt.</p>

<p>The gorge continued its winding course among the mountains, some
of the turns being at very sharp angles. The width of the ravine
varied from fifty to five hundred feet, the walls on either side
showing about the same difference of altitude. At times they were
perpendicular, and then again sloped at such a moderate angle
that a horse could have galloped up them without difficulty.</p>

<p>The mountainous nature of the country rather increased than diminished,
and, looking right and left, in front and rear, the jagged peaks
were forever visible, the distances varying, but the number greater
and greater. At times it seemed as if the ravine were about to
terminate suddenly against the solid wall of the mountain, but,
as they rode forward, the open way was there, albeit the angle
was sharp, and the little party suffered no interruption of progress
until near the close of the day.</p>

<p>The noon halt which Fred expected was not made.</p>

<p>He was hungry and supposed that the Apaches were; but, if so,
they manifestly considered it of more importance to get forward
than to satisfy that hunger. Once or twice they permitted their
horses to drink from the water when it was reached, but these
momentary halts were all that were made.</p>

<p>It was near the middle of the afternoon, when Waukko, who was
the leader of the little group, suddenly showed great excitement,
which speedily communicated itself to his companions. All three
of these scamps were sullen and reticent, frequently riding for
hours at a time without exchanging a word, so that this excitement
meant something. The three halted simultaneously, and talked loudly
and excitedly, so that Fred suspected that some cause for a quarrel
had abruptly sprung upon them.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they're wrangling about <em>me</em>?" was the thought
that came to the lad, who immediately recalled the fate of Miss
MacCrea during the Revolution, when the two Indians conducting
her to Fort Edward settled a quarrel over her by sinking a tomahawk
in her brain.</p>

<p>If the present excitement could be quelled only by such a remedy,
he preferred that it should go on. Otherwise, if there was a prospect
of their settling it by falling upon each other, he was in hope
of seeing it intensified. It looked as if a deadly fight were
impending, when he was tossed to the ground, and the three Apaches
instantly dropped to the earth and faced each other.</p>
