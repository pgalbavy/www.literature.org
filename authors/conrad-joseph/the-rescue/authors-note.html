<p>'Allas!' quod she, 'that ever this sholde happe! For wende I

be!' &mdash;<em>THE FRANKELEYN'S TALE</em></p>

<p><em>TO FREDERIC COURTLAND PENFIELD LAST AMBASSADOR OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA TO THE LATE AUSTRIAN EMPIRE, THIS OLD TIME TALE
IS GRATEFULLY INSCRIBED IN MEMORY OF THE RESCUE OF CERTAIN DISTRESSED
TRAVELLERS EFFECTED BY HIM IN THE WORLD'S GREAT STORM OF THE YEAR
1914</em></p>

<p><em>AUTHOR'S NOTE</em></p>

<p>Of the three long novels of mine which suffered an interruption,
"The Rescue" was the one that had to wait the longest for the
good pleasure of the Fates. I am betraying no secret when I state
here that it had to wait precisely for twenty years. I laid it
aside at the end of the summer of 1898 and it was about the end
of the summer of 1918 that I took it up again with the firm determination
to see the end of it and helped by the sudden feeling that I might
be equal to the task.</p>

<p>This does not mean that I turned to it with elation. I was well
aware and perhaps even too much aware of the dangers of such an
adventure. The amazingly sympathetic kindness which men of various
temperaments, diverse views and different literary tastes have
been for years displaying towards my work has done much for me,
has done all&mdash;except giving me that over-weening self-confidence
which may assist an adventurer sometimes but in the long run ends
by leading him to the gallows.</p>

<p>As the characteristic I want most to impress upon these short
Author's Notes prepared for my first Collected Edition is that
of absolute frankness, I hasten to declare that I founded my hopes
not on my supposed merits but on the continued goodwill of my
readers. I may say at once that my hopes have been justified out
of all proportion to my deserts. I met with the most considerate,
most delicately expressed criticism free from all antagonism and
in its conclusions showing an insight which in itself could not
fail to move me deeply, but was associated also with enough commendation
to make me feel rich beyond the dreams of avarice &mdash;I mean
an artist's avarice which seeks its treasure in the hearts of
men and women.</p>

<p>No! Whatever the preliminary anxieties might have been this adventure
was not to end in sorrow. Once more Fortune favoured audacity;
and yet I have never forgotten the jocular translation of <em>Audaces
fortuna juvat</em> offered to me by my tutor when I was a small
boy: "The Audacious get bitten." However he took care to mention
that there were various kinds of audacity. Oh, there are, there
are! . . . There is, for instance, the kind of audacity almost
indistinguishable from impudence. . . . I must believe that in
this case I have not been impudent for I am not conscious of having
been bitten.</p>

<p>The truth is that when "The Rescue" was laid aside it was not
laid aside in despair. Several reasons contributed to this abandonment
and, no doubt, the first of them was the growing sense of general
difficulty in the handling of the subject. The contents and the
course of the story I had clearly in my mind. But as to the way
of presenting the facts, and perhaps in a certain measure as to
the nature of the facts themselves, I had many doubts. I mean
the telling, representative facts, helpful to carry on the idea,
and, at the same time, of such a nature as not to demand an elaborate
creation of the atmosphere to the detriment of the action. I did
not see how I could avoid becoming wearisome in the presentation
of detail and in the pursuit of clearness. I saw the action plainly
enough. What I had lost for the moment was the sense of the proper
formula of expression, the only formula that would suit. This,
of course, weakened my confidence in the intrinsic worth and in
the possible interest of the story&mdash;that is in my invention. But
I suspect that all the trouble was, in reality, the doubt of my
prose, the doubt of its adequacy, of its power to master both
the colours and the shades.</p>

<p>It is difficult to describe, exactly as I remember it, the complex
state of my feelings; but those of my readers who take an interest
in artistic perplexities will understand me best when I point
out that I dropped "The Rescue" not to give myself up to idleness,
regrets, or dreaming, but to begin "The Nigger of the 'Narcissus'"
and to go on with it without hesitation and without a pause. A
comparison of any page of "The Rescue" with any page of "The Nigger"
will furnish an ocular demonstration of the nature and the inward
meaning of this first crisis of my writing life. For it was a
crisis undoubtedly. The laying aside of a work so far advanced
was a very awful decision to take. It was wrung from me by a sudden
conviction that <em>there</em> only was the road of salvation,
the clear way out for an uneasy conscience. The finishing of "The
Nigger" brought to my troubled mind the comforting sense of an
accomplished task, and the first consciousness of a certain sort
of mastery which could accomplish something with the aid of propitious
stars. Why I did not return to "The Rescue" at once then, was
not for the reason that I had grown afraid of it. Being able now
to assume a firm attitude I said to myself deliberately: "That
thing can wait." At the same time I was just as certain in my
mind that "Youth," a story which I had then, so to speak, on the
tip of my pen, could <em>not</em> wait. Neither could "Heart of
Darkness" be put off; for the practical reason that Mr. Wm. Blackwood
having requested me to write something for the No. M of his magazine
I had to stir up at once the subject of that tale which had been
long lying quiescent in my mind, because, obviously, the venerable
Maga at her patriarchal age of 1000 numbers could not be kept
waiting. Then "Lord Jim," with about seventeen pages already written
at odd times, put in his claim which was irresistible. Thus every
stroke of the pen was taking me further away from the abandoned
"Rescue," not without some compunction on my part but with a gradually
diminishing resistance; till at last I let myself go as if recognising
a superior influence against which it was useless to contend.</p>

<p>The years passed and the pages grew in number, and the long reveries
of which they were the outcome stretched wide between me and the
deserted "Rescue" like the smooth hazy spaces of a dreamy sea.
Yet I never actually lost sight of that dark speck in the misty
distance. It had grown very small but it asserted itself with
the appeal of old associations. It seemed to me that it would
be a base thing for me to slip out of the world leaving it out
there all alone, waiting for its fate&mdash;that would never come?</p>

<p>Sentiment, pure sentiment as you see, prompted me in the last
instance to face the pains and hazards of that return. As I moved
slowly towards the abandoned body of the tale it loomed up big
amongst the glittering shallows of the coast, lonely but not forbidding.
There was nothing about it of a grim derelict. It had an air of
expectant life. One after another I made out the familiar faces
watching my approach with faint smiles of amused recognition.
They had known well enough that I was bound to come back to them.
But their eyes met mine seriously as was only to be expected since
I, myself, felt very serious as I stood amongst them again after
years of absence. At once, without wasting words, we went to work
together on our renewed life; and every moment I felt more strongly
that They Who had Waited bore no grudge to the man who however
widely he may have wandered at times had played truant only once
in his life.</p>
