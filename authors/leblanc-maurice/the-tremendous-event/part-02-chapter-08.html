<p>"My fault! . . . Now aren't you convinced, as I am, that this is a
ramification of my fault, ending in a <u>cul-de-sac</u>? So that all the
eruptive forces immobilized in the direction of this blind alley have
found a favourable position . . . so that all these forces . . . you
grasp the idea, don't you?"
</p><p>Simon grasped it all the less inasmuch as Old Sandstone was becoming
more and more entangled in his theory, while he, Simon, was wholly
absorbed in Isabel and had ears for hardly anything but what she was
telling him.
</p><p>They were all three a little way outside the barricades, among the
groups of tents around which the soldiers, in overalls, and
fatigue-caps, were moving to and fro and preparing their meals.
Isabel's face was already more peaceful and her eyes less uneasy.
Simon gazed at her with infinite tenderness. In the course of the
morning the fog had at last dispersed. For the first time since the
day when they had travelled together on the deck of the <u>Queen Mary</u>,
the sun shone in a cloudless sky; and one might almost have thought
that nothing had occurred between that day and this to divide them.
All evil memories faded away. Isabel's torn dress, her pallor and her
bruised wrists were the reminder merely of an adventure already
remote, since the glorious future was opening out before them.
</p><p>Inside the barricades, a few soldiers scurried round the arena,
stacking the dead bodies, while others, farther back, stationed on the
wreck of the <u>Ville de Dunkerque</u>, removed the sinister shapes hanging
from their gibbets. Near the submarine, in an enclosed space guarded
by many sentries, some dozens of prisoners were herded and were joined
at every moment by fresh batches of captives.
</p><p>"Of course," resumed Old Sandstone, "there are many other obscure
points; but I shall not leave this until I have studied all the causes
of the phenomenon."
</p><p>"And I," said Simon, laughing, "should very much like to know how you
managed to get here."
</p><p>This was a question which possessed little interest for Old Sandstone,
who replied, vaguely:
</p><p>"How do I know! I followed a crowd of good people. . . ."
</p><p>"Good looters and murderers!"
</p><p>"Oh, do you think so? Yes, it may be . . . it seemed to me, sometimes.
. . . But I was so absorbed! So many observations to make! Besides, I
was not alone . . . at least, on the last day."
</p><p>"Really? Who was with you?"
</p><p>"Dolores. We made the whole of the last stage together; and it was she
who brought me here. She left me when we came in sight of the
barricades. For that matter, it was impossible to enter this enclosure
and examine the phenomena more closely. Directly I went forward,
pom-pom went the machine-gun! At last, suddenly, the crowd burst the
dike. But what puzzles me now is that these eruptions seem already to
be decreasing in violence, so that we can foresee the end of them very
shortly. True, on the other hand. . . ."
</p><p>But Simon was not listening. He had caught sight, in the arena, of the
captain commanding the detachment, with whom he had not been able to
exchange more than a few words that morning, as the officer had at
once gone in pursuit of the fugitives. Simon led Isabel to the tent,
set aside for her, in which Lord Bakefield was resting, and joined the
captain, who cried:
</p><p>"We are straightening things out, M. Dubosc. I've sent a few squads
north; and all these bands of cut-throats will fall into my hands or
into those of the English troops, who, I'm told, have arrived. But
what savages! And how glad I am that I came in time!"
</p><p>Simon thanked him in the name of Lord Bakefield and his daughter.
</p><p>"It's not I whom you should thank," he replied, "but that strange
woman, whom I know only by the name of Dolores, and who brought me
here."
</p><p>The captain related how he had been operating since three o'clock in
the out-posts of Boulogne, where he was garrisoned, when he received
from the newly-appointed military governor an order instructing him to
move towards Hastings, to take possession of the country as far as
mid-way between the two coasts and to put down all excesses
ruthlessly.
</p><p>"Well, this morning," he said, "when we were patrolling two or three
miles from there, I saw the woman ride up at a gallop. She told me in
a few words what was happening inside these barricades, which she had
not been able to pass, but behind which Simon Dubosc was in danger.
Having succeeded in catching a horse, she had come to beg me to go to
your assistance. You can imagine how quickly I marched in the
direction she gave me, as soon as I heard the name of Simon Dubosc.
And you will understand also why, when I saw that she in her turn was
in danger, I rushed in pursuit of the man who was carrying her off."
</p><p>"What then, captain?"
</p><p>"Well, she returned, quite quietly, all alone on her horse. She had
thrown the Indian, whom my men picked up in the neighbourhood, rather
the worse for his fall. He says he knows you."
</p><p>Simon briefly related the part which Antonio had played in the
tragedy.
</p><p>"Good!" cried the officer. "The mystery is clearing up!"
</p><p>"What mystery, captain?"
</p><p>"Oh, something quite in keeping with all the horrors that have been
committed!"
</p><p>He drew Simon to the wreck and down, the companion-ladder.
</p><p>The wide gangway was littered with empty bags and baskets. All the
gold had disappeared. The doors of the cabins occupied by Rolleston
had been demolished. But, outside the last of these cabins and a
little before the cupboard into which Antonio had locked Rolleston on
the previous evening, Simon, by the light of an electric torch
switched on by the officer, saw a man's body hanging from the ceiling.
The knees had been bent back and fastened to keep the feet from
touching the floor.
</p><p>"There's the wretched Rolleston," said the captain. "Obviously he has
got no more than his deserts. But, all the same. . . . Look closely.
. . ."
</p><p>He threw the rays of the lamp over the upper part of the victim's
body. The face, covered with black clotted blood, was unrecognizable.
The drooping head displayed the most hideous wound: the skull was
stripped of its skin and hair.
</p><p>"It was Antonio who did that," said Simon, remembering the Indian's
smile when he, Simon, had expressed the fear that the ruffians might
succeed in finding and releasing their chief. "After the fashion of
his ancestors, he has scalped the man whom he wished to punish. I
tell you, we're living in the midst of savagery."
</p><p>A few minutes later, on leaving the wreck, they saw Antonio who was
talking to Dolores near the spot where the submarine strengthened the
former line of defence. Dolores was holding her horse by the bridle.
The Indian was making gestures and seemed to be greatly excited.
</p><p>"She's going away," said the officer. "I've signed a safe-conduct for
her."
</p><p>Simon crossed the arena and went up to her:
</p><p>"You're going, Dolores?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Where?"
</p><p>"Where my horse chooses to take me . . . and as far as he can carry
me."
</p><p>"Won't you wait a few minutes?"
</p><p>"No."
</p><p>"I should have liked to thank you. . . . So would Miss Bakefield.
. . ."
</p><p>"Miss Bakefield has my best wishes!"
</p><p>She mounted. Antonio snatched at the bridle, as though determined to
detain her, and began to speak to her in a choking voice and in a
language which Simon did not understand.
</p><p>She did not move. Her beautiful, austere face did not change. She
waited, with her eyes on the horizon, until the Indian, discouraged,
released the bridle. Then she rode away. Not once had her eyes met
Simon's.
</p><p>She rode away, mysterious and secretive to the last. Simon's refusal,
his conduct during the night which they had passed in the prehistoric
dwelling must have humiliated her profoundly; and the best proof was
this departure without farewell. But, on the other hand, what miracles
of dogged heroism she must have wrought to cross this sinister region
by herself and to save not only the man who had spurned her but the
woman whom that man loved above all things in this world!
</p><p>A hand rested on Simon's shoulder:
</p><p>"You, Isabel!" he said.
</p><p>"Yes. . . . I was over there, a little farther on. . . . I saw Dolores
go."
</p><p>The girl seemed to hesitate. At length, she murmured, watching him
attentively:
</p><p>"You didn't tell me she was so strikingly beautiful, Simon."
</p><p>He felt slightly embarrassed. Looking her straight in the eyes, he
replied:
</p><p>"I had no occasion to tell you, Isabel."
</p><p>At five o'clock that afternoon, the French and British troops being
now in touch, it was decided that Lord Bakefield and his daughter
should make part of an English convoy which was returning to Hastings
and which had a motor-ambulance at its disposal. Simon took leave of
them, after asking Lord Bakefield's permission to call on him at an
early date.
</p><p>Simon considered that his mission was not yet completed in these days
of confusion. Indeed, before the afternoon was over, an aeroplane
alighted in sight of the camp and the captain was asked to send
immediately reinforcements, as a conflict appeared inevitable between
the French and a British detachment, both of which had planted their
colours on a ridge overlooking the whole country. Simon did not
hesitate for a moment. He took his place between the two airmen.
</p><p>It is needless to describe in all its details the part which he played
in this incident, which might have had deplorable results: the way in
which he threw himself between the adversaries, his entreaties, his
threats and, at last, the order to withdraw which he gave to the
French with such authority and such persuasive force. All this is
history; and it is enough to recall the words uttered two days later
by the British prime minister in the House of Commons:
</p><p>"I have to thank M. Simon Dubosc. But for him, there would have been a
stain upon our country's honour; French blood would have been shed by
English hands. M. Simon Dubosc, the wonderful man who crossed what was
once the Channel at one stride, understood that it would be necessary,
at least for a few hours, to exercise a little patience towards a
great nation which for so many centuries has been accustomed to feel
that it was protected by the seas and which suddenly found itself
disarmed, defenceless, deprived of its natural ramparts. Let us not
forget that Germany, that very morning, with her customary effrontery,
offered France an alliance and proposed the immediate invasion of
Great Britain by the whole of the united forces of the two countries.
_Britannia delenda est!_ Mr. Speaker, it was Simon Dubosc who gave the
reply, by achieving the miracle of a French retreat! All honour to
Simon Dubosc!"
</p><p>France at once recognized Simon's action by appointing the young man
high commissioner for the new French territories. For four days longer
he was ubiquitous, flying over the province which he had conquered,
restoring order, enforcing harmony, discipline and security. Pursued
and captured, all the bands of pillagers and spoilers were duly
brought to trial. Aeroplanes sailed the heavens. Provision-lorries ran
in all directions, assuring travellers the means of transport. Chaos
was becoming organized.
</p><p>At last one day, Simon called at Lord Bakefield's country-house near
Battle. Here too tranquillity had returned. The servants had resumed
their duties. Only a few cracks in the walls, a few gaps in the lawns
reminded them of the hours of terror.
</p><p>Lord Bakefield, who appeared to be in excellent health, received Simon
in the library and gave him the same cordial welcome as on the
Brighton golf-links:
</p><p>"Well, young man, where do we stand now?"
</p><p>"On the twentieth day after my request for your daughter's hand," said
Simon, smiling, "and as you gave me twenty days in which to perform a
certain number of exploits, I come to ask you, on the appointed date,
whether I have, in your opinion, fulfilled the conditions settled
between us."
</p><p>Lord Bakefield offered him a cigar and handed him a light.
</p><p>He made no further reply. Simon's exploits and his rescue of Lord
Bakefield when at the point of death, these obviously were interesting
things, deserving the reward of a good cigar, with Isabel's hand
perhaps thrown into the bargain. But it was asking too much to expect
thanks as well and praise and endless effusions. Lord Bakefield
remained Lord Bakefield and Simon Dubosc a nobody.
</p><p>"Well, see you later, young man . . . Oh, by the way! I have had the
marriage annulled which that reptile Rolleston forced upon Isabel.
. . . The marriage wasn't valid of course; but I've done what was
necessary just as though it had been. Isabel will tell you all about
it. You'll find her in the park."
</p><p>She was not in the park. She had heard that Simon had called and was
waiting for him on the terrace.
</p><p>He told her of his interview with Lord Bakefield.
</p><p>"Yes," she said, "my father accepts the position. He considers that
you have satisfied the ordeal."
</p><p>"And you, Isabel?"
</p><p>She smiled:
</p><p>"I have no right to be more difficult than my father. But remember
that there were not only his conditions: there was one added by
myself."
</p><p>"Which condition was that, Isabel?"
</p><p>"Have you forgotten? . . . On the deck of the <u>Queen Mary</u>?"
</p><p>"Then, Isabel, you doubt me?"
</p><p>She took both his hands and said:
</p><p>"Simon, it sometimes makes me rather sad to think that in this great
adventure it was not I but another who was your companion in danger,
the one whom you defended and who protected you."
</p><p>He shook his head:
</p><p>"No, Isabel, I never had but one companion, you, Isabel, and you
alone. You were my only aim and my only thought, my one hope and my
one desire."
</p><p>After a moment's reflection, she said:
</p><p>"I talked of her a good deal with Antonio, on the way home. Do you
know, Simon, that girl is not only very beautiful, but capable of the
noblest, loftiest feelings? I know nothing of her past; according to
Antonio, it had its unsettled moments. But since then . . . since
then . . . in spite of her present mode of life, in spite of all the
admiration which she attracts, she leads an existence apart. You alone
have really stirred her feelings. For you, from what I can see for
myself and from what Antonio told me--and he, after all, is only a
rejected and embittered lover--for you Dolores would have laid down
her life and that from the first day. Did you know that, Simon?"
</p><p>He was silent.
</p><p>"You are right," she said. "You can't answer. However, there is one
point, Simon, on which I ask you to tell me the absolute truth. I can
look you straight in the face, can I not? There is not in the depths
of your being a single memory that comes between us? . . . Not a
weakness? . . . Not a disloyal thought?"
</p><p>He pressed her to him and, with his lips on hers, said:
</p><p>"There's you, Isabel, and you alone: you in the past and you in the
future."
</p><p>"I believe you, Simon," she declared.
</p><p>The wedding took place a month later; and they went to live in the
wreck of the <u>Ville de Dunkerque</u>, the official residence of the
French high commissioner of the new territories.
</p><p>It was here that the draft agreement was signed, in accordance with
Simon Dubosc's proposal and his preliminary investigations, for the
great canal which was to bisect the Isthmus of Normandy, allotting to
each country, right and left, an almost equal portion of land.
</p><p>Here too was signed the solemn covenant by which Great Britain and
France declared eternal friendship and laid the foundations of the
United States of Europe.
</p><p>And it was here that four children were born to Isabel and Simon.
</p><p>In after years, Simon often went on horseback or by aeroplane,
accompanied by his wife, to visit his friend Edward Rolleston. When he
had recovered from his wounds, Rolleston set to work and became the
manager of a large fishing-industry on the new English coast, in which
he employed Antonio. Rolleston married. The Indian lived alone for a
long time, waiting for her who never came and of whom no one ever
spoke. But one day he received a letter and went away. Some months
later, he wrote from Mexico announcing his marriage to Dolores.
</p><p>But Isabel and Simon's favourite walk led them to Old Sandstone's
house. He lived in a little bungalow, close to the prehistoric
dwelling by the lake, where he pursued his researches into the new
land. The showers of gold, now exhausted, no longer interested him;
moreover, the problem had been solved. But what an indecipherable
riddle was this building, standing on a site of the Eocene period!
</p><p>"There were apes in those days," Old Sandstone declared. "There's no
doubt of that. But men! And men capable of building, of ornamenting
their dwellings of carving stone! No, I confess this is a phenomenon
which unsettles all one's ideas. What do you make of it, Simon?"
</p><p>Simon made no reply. A boat was rocking on the lake. He took his place
in it with Isabel and rowed with a care-free mind; nor did Dolores'
image ever rise from this limpid water, in which she had bathed on a
certain voluptuous evening. Simon was the husband of one alone and
this was the woman whom he had won.
