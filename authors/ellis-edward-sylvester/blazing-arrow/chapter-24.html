<p>At the moment when neither of the youths had a thought of such
a thing, they found themselves walking along a distinctly marked
trail in the woods, while Arqu-wao, the Shawanoe guide, turned
his head with an odd expression, as if to ask their opinion of
the manner in which he had kept his agreement.</p>

<p>This issue would have been highly pleasing but for the question
which instantly presented itself to Wharton Edwards and Larry
Murphy&mdash;were they upon the right trail?</p>

<p>Fully aware of the treacherous subtlety of the American race,
they might well doubt the answer. The Indian must have seen that
he was regarded with suspicion, and knew, therefore, that extraordinary
care was necessary on his part to bring about the ruin of his
captors and save himself.</p>

<p>What more likely to deceive them than the act of taking them
to a plainly marked path through the woods?</p>

<p>But such trails were not common at that day in the forest, and
since the boys had passed over the one connecting the block-house
with the settlement, it surely seemed that they ought to be able
to identify it. They set out to do so, and quickly succeeded.</p>

<p>Wharton was slightly in advance of his companion, and, turning
his head, he said in a low tone, over his shoulder:</p>

<p>"Larry, we're on the right track as sure as we're born."</p>

<p>"I know it. Do ye mind that tree over there to the right, beyant,
that has been knocked all to splinters by lightning? Do ye mind
that, I say?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I remember it well. We saw it last fall when we passed
here."</p>

<p>It would seem that the splintered trunk should have been an infallible
guide to the youths; but, as if fate wished to toy with them,
Wharton was positive that it was on the right side of the trail
as they faced the block-house, while Larry was equally certain
it was on the left. Neither could dissuade the other, and the
question remained as exasperating as before. One believed that
instead of going right they were walking directly contrary to
the proper course, and that sooner or later they would reach the
dangerous section where they had already met with so many narrow
escapes.</p>

<p>Had either been able to convince the other of his mistake they
would have decided what was the best thing to do, for such a decision
of necessity would have determined whether Arqu-wao was playing
them false or not.</p>

<p>It was the younger lad who believed they were going astray, and
it was this fact which caused him to examine the ground, as they
walked along, with closer scrutiny than his companion. In doing
so he made an alarming discovery; the path showed the distinct
hoofprints of two horses that had travelled in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The woodcraft of the young man told him that the animals had
passed that way quite recently, probably within a few hours. While
there could be no certainty as to who the couple were, he decided
at once that they were his father and mother on their way from
the block-house to the settlement.</p>

<p>"Larry," said he, touching the shoulder of his friend, "the Shawanoe
is acting honestly with us."</p>

<p>"How can ye know that?" asked the other in surprise.</p>

<p>"These are the footprints of father and mother's horses."</p>

<p>Larry bent his head forward and closely studied the ground for
some time, walking slowly, and allowing nothing to escape him.</p>

<p>"Ye are right," straightening up, "which means that two people
have passed this way&mdash;pretty lately, too; but how can we know
who they were?"</p>

<p>"This trail is little travelled. If the folks left the block-house
very early this morning they would have been near here by this
time. We can't know it is they, but it is certain as anything
can be."</p>

<p>"Then ye were wrong and I was right about the course we were
following."</p>

<p>"Yes; I believe the Indian is doing his best to keep his promise."</p>

<p>"I hope so, but I don't feel as sartin as yersilf of that."</p>

<p>The brief delay of the couple had allowed Arqu-wao to gain so
much on them that he was almost invisible. Discovering the fact,
he again halted and looked back, as if waiting for them to come
up.</p>

<p>"Obsarve him," said Larry. "He stands jist as he did whin we
took a drink from the brook."</p>

<p>Such was the fact. If he chose to launch an arrow, he could do
so with an instantaneousness that was sure to be fatal to one;
but now they were in a better situation than before, and the result
was so certain to be fatal to him that neither felt much fear
of any attempt.</p>

<p>Wharton beckoned to him to wait, and they hurried forward. Pointing
to the hoofprints, clearly showing in the earth, he asked:</p>

<p>"What do they mean, Arqu-wao?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe merely glanced at the ground. He had noticed the
signs before, and it was not necessary for him to scrutinize or
study them in order to know what the youth meant.</p>

<p>"Horses&mdash;so many," he said, holding up two fingers of his hand.</p>

<p>"How long ago did they pass this way?"</p>

<p>While the Indian understood the question, he was puzzled for
a moment as to how to make an intelligent answer. He fixed his
keen black eyes on the face of the questioner, then looked around
the trees as if searching for some aid. These shut out the sun,
but it was easy to locate the orb about one-third of the way between
the horizon and the zenith. He had struck the key.</p>

<p>"When sun dere," he replied, pointing low down in the sky, "den
men ride along on horses."</p>

<p>Wharton Edwards's heart gave a painful start. Of course the Shawanoe
could not know that one of the horses carried a woman instead
of a man, nor, with all the woodcraft of the American Indian,
could he determine within an hour or two the time when the animals
had passed along the trail, but he did know of a verity that the
passage had taken place since the sun went down on the night before.</p>

<p>Understanding, now, the precise distance to the block-house,
and the strong probability that the parties would not leave there
in the night time, and well aware, also, from the marks of the
hoofprints, that the horses were walking at a leisurely pace,
it became an easy matter for him to tell at what time they were
due at this particular spot. He had indicated the hour, which
was another evidence that the boys were at no great distance from
their destination.</p>

<p>"We don't want to go to the block-house," said Wharton, impetuously.
"We want to travel the other way. We must overtake those horsemen
before they reach the falls."</p>
