<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Valentine Corliss walked up Corliss Street the hottest afternoon
of that hot August, a year ago, wearing a suit of white serge
which attracted a little attention from those observers who were
able to observe anything except the heat. The coat was shaped
delicately; it outlined the wearer, and, fitting him as women's
clothes fit women, suggested an effeminacy not an attribute of
the tall Corliss. The effeminacy belonged all to the tailor, an
artist plying far from Corliss Street, for the coat would have
encountered a hundred of its fellows at Trouville or Ostende this
very day. Corliss Street is the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne, the
Park Lane, the Fifth Avenue, of Capitol City, that smoky illuminant
of our great central levels, but although it esteems itself an
established cosmopolitan thoroughfare, it is still provincial
enough to be watchful; and even in its torrid languor took some
note of the alien garment.</p>

<p>Mr. Corliss, treading for the first time in seventeen years the
pavements of this namesake of his grandfather, mildly repaid its
interest in himself. The street, once the most peaceful in the
world, he thought, had changed. It was still long and straight,
still shaded by trees so noble that they were betrothed, here
and there, high over the wide white roadway, the shimmering tunnels
thus contrived shot with gold and blue; but its pristine complete
restfulness was departed: gasoline had arrived, and a pedestrian,
even this August day of heat, must glance two ways before crossing.</p>

<p>Architectural transformations, as vital, staggered the returned
native. In his boyhood that posthumously libelled sovereign lady,
Anne, had terribly prevailed among the dwellings on this highway;
now, however, there was little left of the jig-saw's hare-brained
ministrations; but the growing pains of the adolescent city had
wrought some madness here. There had been a revolution which was
a riot; and, plainly incited by a new outbreak of the colonies,
the Goth, the Tudor, and the Tuscan had harried the upper reaches
to a turmoil attaining its climax in a howl or two from the Spanish
Moor.</p>

<p>Yet it was a pleasant street in spite of its improvements; in
spite, too, of a long, gray smoke-plume crossing the summer sky
and dropping an occasional atomy of coal upon Mr. Corliss's white
coat. The green continuous masses of tree-foliage, lawn, and shrubbery
were splendidly asserted; there was a faint wholesome odour from
the fine block pavement of the roadway, white, save where the
snailish water-wagon laid its long strips of steaming brown. Locusts,
serenaders of the heat, invisible among the branches, rasped their
interminable cadences, competing bitterly with the monotonous
chattering of lawn-mowers propelled by glistening black men over
the level swards beneath. And though porch and terrace were left
to vacant wicker chairs and swinging-seats, and to flowers and
plants in jars and green boxes, and the people sat unseen&mdash;and,
it might be guessed, unclad for exhibition, in the dimmer recesses
of their houses&mdash;nevertheless, a summery girl under an alluring
parasol now and then prettily trod the sidewalks, and did not
altogether suppress an ample consciousness of the white pedestrian's
stalwart grace; nor was his quick glance too distressingly modest
to be aware of these faint but attractive perturbations.</p>

<p>A few of the oldest houses remained as he remembered them, and
there were two or three relics of mansard and cupola days; but
the herd of cast-iron deer that once guarded these lawns, standing
sentinel to all true gentry: Whither were they fled? In his boyhood,
one specimen betokened a family of position and affluence; two,
one on each side of the front walk, spoke of a noble opulence;
two and a fountain were overwhelming. He wondered in what obscure
thickets that once proud herd now grazed; and then he smiled,
as through a leafy opening of shrubbery he caught a glimpse of
a last survivor, still loyally alert, the haughty head thrown
back in everlasting challenge and one foreleg lifted, standing
in a vast and shadowy backyard with a clothesline fastened to
its antlers.</p>

<p>Mr. Corliss remembered that backyard very well: it was an old
battlefield whereon he had conquered; and he wondered if "the
Lindley boys" still lived there, and if Richard Lindley would
hate him now as implacably as then.</p>

<p>A hundred yards farther on, he paused before a house more familiar
to him than any other, and gave it a moment's whimsical attention,
without emotion.</p>

<p>It was a shabby old brick structure, and it stood among the gayest,
the most flamboyant dwellings of all Corliss Street like a bewildered
tramp surrounded by carnival maskers. It held place full in the
course of the fury for demolition and rebuilding, but remained
unaltered&mdash;even unrepaired, one might have thought&mdash;since the
early seventies, when it was built. There was a sagging cornice,
and the nauseous brown which the walls had years ago been painted
was sooted to a repellent dinge, so cracked and peeled that the
haggard red bricks were exposed, like a beggar through the holes
in his coat. It was one of those houses which are large without
being commodious; its very tall, very narrow windows, with their
attenuated, rusty inside shutters, boasting to the passerby of
high ceilings but betraying the miserly floor spaces. At each
side of the front door was a high and cramped bay-window, one
of them insanely culminating in a little six-sided tower of slate,
and both of them girdled above the basement windows by a narrow
porch, which ran across the front of the house and gave access
to the shallow vestibule. However, a pleasant circumstance modified
the gloom of this edifice and assured it a remnant of reserve
and dignity in its ill-considered old age: it stood back a fine
hundred feet from the highway, and was shielded in part by a friendly
group of maple trees and one glorious elm, hoary, robust, and
majestic, a veteran of the days when this was forest ground.</p>

<p>Mr. Corliss concluded his momentary pause by walking up the broken
cement path, which was hard beset by plantain-weed and the long
grass of the ill-kept lawn. Ascending the steps, he was assailed
by an odour as of vehement bananas, a diffusion from some painful
little chairs standing in the long, high, dim, rather sorrowful
hall disclosed beyond the open double doors. They were stiff little
chairs of an inconsequent, mongrel pattern; armless, with perforated
wooden seats; legs tortured by the lathe to a semblance of buttons
strung on a rod; and they had that day received a streaky coat
of a gilding preparation which exhaled the olfactory vehemence
mentioned. Their present station was temporary, their purpose,
as obviously, to dry; and they were doing some incidental gilding
on their own account, leaving blots and splashes and sporadic
little round footprints on the hardwood floor.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned brass bell-handle upon the caller's right drooped
from its socket in a dead fag, but after comprehensive manipulation
on the part of the young man, and equal complaint on its own,
it was constrained to permit a dim tinkle remotely. Somewhere
in the interior a woman's voice, not young, sang a repeated fragment
of "Lead, Kindly Light," to the accompaniment of a flapping dust-cloth,
sounds which ceased upon a second successful encounter with the
bell. Ensued a silence, probably to be interpreted as a period
of whispered consultation out of range; a younger voice called
softly and urgently, "Laura!" and a dark-eyed, dark-haired girl
of something over twenty made her appearance to Mr. Corliss.</p>

<p>At sight of her he instantly restored a thin gold card-case to
the pocket whence he was in the act of removing it. She looked
at him with only grave, impersonal inquiry; no appreciative invoice
of him was to be detected in her quiet eyes, which may have surprised
him, possibly the more because he was aware there was plenty of
appreciation in his own kindling glance. She was very white and
black, this lady. Tall, trim, clear, she looked cool in spite
of the black winter skirt she wore, an effect helped somewhat,
perhaps, by the crisp freshness of her white waist, with its masculine
collar and slim black tie, and undoubtedly by the even and lustreless
light ivory of her skin, against which the strong black eyebrows
and undulated black hair were lined with attractive precision;
but, most of all, that coolness was the emanation of her undisturbed
and tranquil eyes. They were not phlegmatic: a continuing spark
glowed far within them, not ardently, but steadily and inscrutably,
like the fixed stars in winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss, of Paris and Naples, removed his white-ribboned
straw hat and bowed as no one had ever bowed in that doorway.
This most vivid salutation&mdash;accomplished by adding something to
a rather quick inclination of the body from the hips, with the
back and neck held straight expressed deference without affecting
or inviting cordiality. It was an elaborate little formality of
a kind fancifully called "foreign," and evidently habitual to
the performer.</p>

<p>It produced no outward effect upon the recipient. Such self-control
is unusual.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Madison at home? My name is Valentine Corliss."</p>

<p>"He is at home." She indicated an open doorway upon her right.
"Will you wait in there?"</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mr. Corliss, passing within. "I shall be&#11834;"
He left the sentence unfinished, for he was already alone, and
at liberty to reflect upon the extraordinary coolness of this
cool young woman.</p>

<p>The room, with its closed blinds, was soothingly dark after the
riotous sun without, a grateful obscurity which was one of two
attractions discovered in it by Mr. Corliss while he waited. It
was a depressing little chamber, disproportionately high, uncheered
by seven chairs (each of a different family, but all belonging
to the same knobby species, and all upholstered a repellent blue),
a scratched "inlaid table," likewise knobby, and a dangerous looking
small sofa&mdash;turbulent furniture, warmly harmonious, however, in
a common challenge to the visitor to take comfort in any of it.
A once-gilt gas chandelier hung from the distant ceiling, with
three globes of frosted glass, but undeniable evidence that five
were intended; and two of the three had been severely bitten.
There was a hostile little coal-grate, making a mouth under a
mantel of imitation black marble, behind an old blue-satin fire-screen
upon which red cat-tails and an owl over a pond had been roughly
embroidered in high relief, this owl motive being the inspiration
of innumerable other owls reflected in innumerable other ponds
in the formerly silver moonlight with which the walls were papered.
Corliss thought he remembered that in his boyhood, when it was
known as "the parlour" (though he guessed that the Madison family
called it "the reception room," now) this was the place where
his aunt received callers who, she justifiably hoped, would not
linger. Altogether, it struck him that it might be a good test-room
for an alienist: no incipient lunacy would remain incipient here.</p>

<p>There was one incongruity which surprised him&mdash;a wicker waste-paper
basket, so nonsensically out of place in this arid cell, where
not the wildest hare-brain could picture any one coming to read
or write, that he bestowed upon it a particular, frowning attention,
and so discovered the second attractive possession of the room.
A fresh and lovely pink rose, just opening full from the bud,
lay in the bottom of the basket.</p>

<p>There was a rustling somewhere in the house and a murmur, above
which a boy's voice became audible in emphatic but undistinguishable
complaint. A whispering followed, and a woman exclaimed protestingly,
"Cora!" And then a startlingly pretty girl came carelessly into
the room through the open door.</p>

<p>She was humming "Quand I' Amour Meurt" in a gay preoccupation,
and evidently sought something upon the table in the centre of
the room, for she continued her progress toward it several steps
before realizing the presence of a visitor. She was a year or
so younger than the girl who had admitted him, fairer and obviously
more plastic, more expressive, more perishable, a great deal more
insistently feminine; though it was to be seen that they were
sisters. This one had eyes almost as dark as the other's, but
these were not cool; they were sweet, unrestful, and seeking;
brilliant with a vivacious hunger: and not Diana but huntresses
more ardent have such eyes. Her hair was much lighter than her
sister's; it was the colour of dry corn-silk in the sun; and she
was the shorter by a head, rounder everywhere and not so slender;
but no dumpling: she was exquisitely made. There was a softness
about her: something of velvet, nothing of mush. She diffused
with her entrance a radiance of gayety and of gentleness; sunlight
ran with her. She seemed the incarnation of a caressing smile.</p>

<p>She was point-device. Her close, white skirt hung from a plainly
embroidered white waist to a silken instep; and from the crown
of her charming head to the tall heels of her graceful white suede
slippers, heels of a sweeter curve than the waist of a violin,
she was as modern and lovely as this dingy old house was belated
and hideous.</p>

<p>Mr. Valentine Corliss spared the fraction of a second for another
glance at the rose in the waste-basket.</p>

<p>The girl saw him before she reached the table, gave a little
gasp of surprise, and halted with one hand carried prettily to
her breast.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she said impulsively; "I <em>beg</em> your pardon. I didn't
know there was&#11834; I was looking for a book I thought I&#11834;"</p>

<p>She stopped, whelmed with a breath-taking shyness, her eyes,
after one quick but condensed encounter with those of Mr. Corliss,
falling beneath exquisite lashes. Her voice was one to stir all
men: it needs not many words for a supremely beautiful "speaking-voice"
to be recognized for what it is; and this girl's was like herself,
hauntingly lovely. The intelligent young man immediately realized
that no one who heard it could ever forget it.</p>

<p>"I see," she faltered, turning to leave the room; "it isn't here&mdash;the
book."</p>

<p>"There's something else of yours here," said Corliss.</p>

<p>"Is there?" She paused, hesitating at the door, looking at him
over her shoulder uncertainly.</p>

<p>"You dropped this rose." He lifted the rose from the waste-basket
and repeated the bow he had made at the front door. This time
it was not altogether wasted.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You lost it. It belongs to you."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;it does. How curious!" she said slowly. "How curious it
happened to be <em>there</em>!" She stepped to take it from him,
her eyes upon his in charming astonishment. "And how odd that&#11834;"
She stopped; then said quickly:</p>

<p>"How did you know it was <em>my</em> rose?"</p>

<p>"Any one would know!"</p>

<p>Her expression of surprise was instantaneously merged in a flash
of honest pleasure and admiration, such as only an artist may
feel in the presence of a little masterpiece by a fellow-craftsman.</p>

<p>Happily, anticlimax was spared them by the arrival of the person
for whom the visitor had asked at the door, and the young man
retained the rose in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. Madison, a shapeless hillock with a large, harassed, red
face, evidently suffered from the heat: his gray hair was rumpled
back from a damp forehead; the sleeves of his black alpaca coat
were pulled up to the elbow above his uncuffed white shirtsleeves;
and he carried in one mottled hand the ruins of a palm-leaf fan,
in the other a balled wet handkerchief which released an aroma
of camphor upon the banana-burdened air. He bore evidences of
inadequate adjustment after a disturbed siesta, but, exercising
a mechanical cordiality, preceded himself into the room by a genial
half-cough and a hearty, "Well-well-well," as if wishing to indicate
a spirit of polite, even excited, hospitality.</p>

<p>"I expected you might be turning up, after your letter," he said,
shaking hands. "Well, well, well! I remember you as a boy. Wouldn't
have known you, of course; but I expect you'll find the town about
as much changed as you are."</p>

<p>With a father's blindness to all that is really vital, he concluded
his greeting inconsequently: "Oh, this is my little girl Cora."</p>

<p>"Run along, little girl," said the fat father.</p>

<p>His little girl's radiant glance at the alert visitor imparted
her thorough comprehension of all the old man's absurdities, which
had reached their climax in her dismissal. Her parting look, falling
from Corliss's face to the waste-basket at his feet, just touched
the rose in his hand as she passed through the door.</p>
