<p>Neeland had several letters from Ruhannah Carew that autumn and
winter. The first one was written a few weeks after her arrival
in Paris:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Dear Mr. Neeland:</p>

<p>Please forgive me for writing to you, but I am homesick.</p>

<p>I have written every week to mother and have made my letters
read as though I were still married, because it would almost kill
her if she knew the truth.</p>

<p>Some day I shall have to tell her, but not yet. Could you tell
me how you think the news ought to be broken to her and father?</p>

<p><em>That man</em> was not on the steamer. I was quite ill crossing
the ocean. But the last two days I went on deck with the Princess
Mistchenka and her maid, and I enjoyed the sea.</p>

<p>The Princess has been so friendly. I should have died, I think,
without her, what with my seasickness and homesickness, and brooding
over my terrible fall. I know it is immoral to say so, but I did
not want to live any longer, truly I didn't. I even asked to be
taken. I am sorry now that I prayed that way.</p>

<p>Well, I have passed through the most awful part of my life, I
think. I feel strange and different, as though I had been very
sick, and had died, and as though it were another girl sitting
here writing to you, and not the girl who was in your studio last
August.</p>

<p>I had always expected happiness some day. Now I know I shall
never have it. Girls dream many foolish things about the future.
They have such dear, silly hopes.</p>

<p>All dreams are ended for me; all that remains in life for me
is to work very hard so that I can learn to support myself and
my parents. I should like to make a great deal of money so that
when I die I can leave it to charity. I desire to be remembered
for my good works. But of course I shall first have to learn how
to take care of myself and mother and father before I can aid
the poor. I often think of becoming a nun and going out to nurse
lepers. Only I don't know where there are any. Do you?</p>

<p>Paris is very large and a sort of silvery grey colour, full of
trees with yellowing leaves&mdash;but Oh, it is <em>so</em> lonely,
Mr. Neeland! I am determined not to cry every day, but it is quite
difficult not to. And then there are so many, many people, and
they all talk French! They talk very fast, too, even the little
children.</p>

<p>This seems such an ungrateful letter to write you, who were so
good and kind to me in my dreadful hour of trial and disgrace.
I am afraid you won't understand how full of gratitude I am, to
you and to the Princess Mistchenka.</p>

<p>I have the prettiest little bedroom in her house. There is a
pink shade on my night lamp. She insisted that I go home with
her, and I had to, because I didn't know where else to go, and
she wouldn't tell me. In fact, I can't go anywhere or find any
place because I speak no French at all. It's humiliating, isn't
it, for even the very little children speak French in Paris.</p>

<p>But I have begun to learn; a cheerful old lady comes for an hour
every day to teach me. Only it is very hard for me, because she
speaks no English and I am forbidden to utter one word of my own
language. And so far I understand nothing that she says, which
makes me more lonely than I ever was in all my life. But sometimes
it is so absurd that we both laugh.</p>

<p>I am to study drawing and painting at a studio for women. The
kind Princess has arranged it. I am also to study piano and voice
culture. This I did not suppose would be possible with the money
I have, but the Princess Mistchenka, who has asked me to let her
take charge of my money and my expenses, says that I can easily
afford it. She knows, of course, what things cost, and what I
am able to afford; and I trust her willingly because she is so
dear and sweet to me, but I am a little frightened at the dresses
she is having made for me. They <em>can't</em> be inexpensive!
&mdash;Such lovely clothes and shoes and hats&mdash;and other things
about which I never even heard in Brookhollow.</p>

<p>I ought to be happy, Mr. Neeland, but everything is so new and
strange&mdash;even Sunday is not restful; and how different is Nôtre
Dame de Paris and Saint Eustache from our church at Gayfield!
The high arches and jewelled windows and the candles and the dull
roar of the organ drove from my mind those quiet and solemn thoughts
of God which always filled my mind so naturally and peacefully
in our church at home. I couldn't think of Him; I couldn't even
try to pray; it was as though an ocean were rolling and thundering
over me where I lay drowned in a most deep place.</p>

<p>Well, I must close, because <em>déjeuner</em> is ready&mdash;you see
I know <em>one</em> French word, after all! And one other&mdash;"<em>Bonjour,
monsieur!</em>"&mdash;which counts <em>two</em>, doesn't it?&mdash;or three
in all.</p>

<p>It has made me feel better to write to you. I hope you will not
think it a presumption.</p>

<p>And now I shall say thank you for your great kindness to me in
your studio on that most frightful night of my life. It is one
of those things that a girl can never, never forget&mdash;your aid
in my hour of need. Through all my shame and distress it was your
help that sustained me; for I was so stunned by my disgrace that
I even forgot God himself.</p>

<p>But I <em>will</em> prove that I am thankful to Him, and worthy
of your goodness to me; I <em>will</em> profit by this dreadful
humiliation and devote my life to a more worthy and lofty purpose
than merely getting married just because a man asked me so persistently
and I was too young and ignorant to continue saying no! Also,
I <em>did</em> want to study art. How stupid, how immoral I was!</p>

<p>And now nobody would ever want to marry me again after this&mdash;and
also it's against the law, I imagine. But I don't care; I never,
never desire to marry another man. All I want is to learn how
to support myself by art; and some day perhaps I shall forget
what has happened to me and perhaps find a little pleasure in
life when I am very old.</p>

<p>With every wish and prayer for your happiness and success in
this world of sorrow, believe me your grateful friend,</p>

Rue Carew.

<p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Every naïve and laboured line of the stilted letter touched and
amused and also flattered Neeland; for no young man is entirely
insensible to a young girl's gratitude. An agreeable warmth suffused
him; it pleased him to remember that he had been associated in
the moral and social rehabilitation of Rue Carew.</p>

<p>He meant to write her some kind, encouraging advice; he had every
intention of answering her letter. But in New York young men are
very busy; or think they are. For youth days dawn and vanish in
the space of a fire-fly's lingering flash; and the moments swarm
by like a flight of distracted golden butterflies; and a young
man is ever at their heels in breathless chase with as much chance
of catching up with the elusive moment as a squirrel has of outstripping
the wheel in which he whirls.</p>

<p>So he neglected to reply&mdash;waited a little too long. Because,
while her childish letter still remained unanswered, came a note
from the Princess Mistchenka, enclosing a tremulous line from
Rue:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</div>
<p><em>Mon cher</em> James:</p>

<p>Doubtless you have already heard of the sad death of Ruhannah's
parents&mdash;within a few hours of each other&mdash;both stricken with
pneumonia within the same week. The local minister cabled her
as Mrs. Brandes in my care. Then he wrote to the child; the letter
has just arrived.</p>

<p>My poor little <em>protégée</em> is prostrated&mdash;talks wildly
of going back at once. But to what purpose now, <em>mon ami</em>?
Her loved ones will have been in their graves for days before
Ruhannah could arrive.</p>

<p>No; I shall keep her here. She is young; she shall be kept busy
every instant of the day. That is the only antidote for grief;
youth and time its only cure.</p>

<p>Please write to the Baptist minister at Gayfield, James, and
find out what is to be done; and have it done. Judge Gary, at
Orangeville, had charge of the Reverend Mr. Carew's affairs. Let
him send the necessary papers to Ruhannah here. I enclose a paper
which she has executed, conferring power of attorney. If a guardian
is to be appointed, I shall take steps to qualify through the
good offices of Lejeune Brothers, the international lawyers whom
I have put into communication with Judge Gary through the New
York representatives of the firm.</p>

<p>There are bound to be complications, I fear, in regard to this
mock marriage of hers. I have consulted my attorneys here and
they are not very certain that the ceremony was not genuine enough
to require further legal steps to free her entirely. A suit for
annulment is possible.</p>

<p>Please have the house at Brookhollow locked up and keep the keys
in your possession for the present. Judge Gary will have the keys
sent to you.</p>

<p>James, dear, I am very deeply indebted to you for giving to me
my little friend, Ruhannah Carew. Now, I wish to make her entirely
mine by law until the inevitable day arrives when some man shall
take her from me.</p>

<p>Write to her, James; don't be selfish.</p>

<p>The line enclosed from Ruhannah touched him deeply:</p>

<p>I cannot speak of it yet. Please, when you go to Brookhollow,
have flowers planted. You know where our plot is. Have it made
pretty for them.</p>

<p>He wrote at once exactly the sort of letter that an impulsive,
warm-hearted young man might take time to write to a bereaved
friend. He was genuinely grieved and sorry for her, but he was
glad when his letter was finished and mailed, and he could turn
his thoughts into other and gayer channels.</p>

<p>To this letter she replied, thanking him for what he had written
and for what he had done to make the plot in the local cemetery
"pretty."</p>

<p>She asked him to keep the keys to the house in Brookhollow. Then
followed a simple report of her quiet and studious daily life
in the home of the Princess Mistchenka; of her progress in her
studies; of her hopes that in due time she might become sufficiently
educated to take care of herself.</p>

<p>It was a slightly dull, laboured, almost emotionless letter.
Always willing to shirk correspondence, he persuaded himself that
the letter called for no immediate answer. After all, it was not
to be expected that a very young girl whom a man had met only
twice in his life could hold his interest very long, when absent.
However, he meant to write her again; thought of doing so several
times during the next twelve months.</p>

<p>It was a year before another letter came from her. And, reading
it, he was a little surprised to discover how rapidly immaturity
can mature under the shock of circumstances and exotic conditions
which tend toward forced growth.</p>

</div>
<p>Mon cher ami:</p>

<p>I was silly enough to hope you might write to me. But I suppose
you have far more interesting and important matters to occupy
you.</p>

<p>Still, don't you sometimes remember the girl you drove home with
in a sleigh one winter night, ages ago? Don't you sometimes think
of the girl who came creeping upstairs, half dead, to your studio
door? And don't you sometimes wonder what has become of her?</p>

<p>Why is it that a girl is always more loyal to past memories than
a man ever is? Don't answer that it is because she has less to
occupy her than a man has. You have no idea how busy I have been
during this long year in which you have forgotten me.</p>

<p>Among other things I have been busy growing. I am taller by two
inches than when last I saw you. Please be impressed by my five
feet eight inches.</p>

<p>Also, I am happy. The greatest happiness in the world is to have
the opportunity to learn about that same world.</p>

<p>I am happy because I now have that opportunity. During these
many months since I wrote to you I have learned a little French;
I read some, write some, understand pretty well, and speak a little.
What a pleasure, <em>mon ami</em>!</p>

<p>Piano and vocal music, too, occupy me; I love both, and I am
told encouraging things. But best and most delightful of all I
am learning to draw and compose and paint from life in the Académie
Julian! Think of it! It is difficult, it is absorbing, it requires
energy, persistence, self-denial; but it is fascinating, satisfying,
glorious.</p>

<p>Also, it is very trying, <em>mon ami</em>; and I descend into
depths of despair and I presently soar up out of those depressing
depths into intoxicating altitudes of aspiration and self-confidence.</p>

<p>You yourself know how it is, of course. At the criticism today
I was lifted to the seventh heaven. "<em>Pas mal</em>," he said;
"<em>continuez, mademoiselle</em>." Which is wonderful for him.
Also my weekly sketch was chosen from among all the others, and
I was given number one. That means my choice of <em>tabourets</em>
on Monday morning, <em>voyez vous</em>? So do you wonder that
I came home with Suzanne, walking on air, and that as soon as
<em>déjeuner</em> was finished I flew in here to write to you
about it?</p>

<p>Suzanne is our maid&mdash;the maid of Princess Naïa, of course&mdash;who
walks to and from school with me. I didn't wish her to follow
me about at first, but the Princess insisted, and I'm resigned
to it now.</p>

<p>The Princess Mistchenka is such a darling! I owe her more than
I owe anybody except mother and father. She simply took me as
I was, a young, stupid, ignorant, awkward country girl with no
experience, no <em>savoir-faire</em>, no clothes, and even no
knowledge of how to wear them; and she is trying to make out of
me a fairly intelligent and presentable human being who will not
offend her by <em>gaucheries</em> when with her, and who will
not disgrace her when in the circle of her friends.</p>

<p>Oh, of course I still make a <em>faux pas</em> now and then,
<em>mon ami</em>; there are dreadful pitfalls in the French language
into which I have fallen more than once. And at times I have almost
died of mortification. But everybody is so amiable and patient,
so polite, so gay about my mistakes. I am beginning to love the
French. And I am learning so much! I had no idea what a capacity
I had for learning things. But then, with Princess Naïa, and with
my kind and patient teachers and my golden opportunities, even
a very stupid girl must learn <em>something</em>. And I am not
really very stupid; I've discovered that. On the contrary, I really
seem to learn quite rapidly; and all that annoys me is that there
is so much to learn and the days are not long enough, so anxious
am I, so ambitious, so determined to get out of this wonderful
opportunity everything I possibly can extract.</p>

<p>I have lived in these few months more years than my own age adds
up! I am growing old and wise very fast. Please hasten to write
to me before I have grown so old that you would not recognize
me if you met me.</p>

<p>The letter flattered him. He was rather glad he had once kissed
the girl who could write such a letter.</p>

<p>He happened to be engaged, at that time, in drawing several illustrations
for a paper called the <em>Midweek Magazine</em>. There was a
heroine, of course, in the story he was illustrating. And, from
memory, and in spite of the model posing for him, he made the
face like the face of Ruhannah Carew.</p>

<p>But the days passed, and he did not reply to her letter. Then
there came still another letter from her:</p>

<p>Why don't you write me just one line? Have you <em>really</em>
forgotten me? You'd like me if you knew me now, I think. I am
really quite grown up. And I am <em>so</em> happy!</p>

<p>The Princess is simply adorable. Always we are busy, Princess
Naïa and I; and now, since I have laid aside mourning, we go to
concerts; we go to plays; we have been six times to the opera,
and as many more to the Théâtre Français; we have been to the
Louvre and the Luxembourg many times; to St. Cloud, Versailles,
Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Always, when my studies are over, we do something interesting;
and I am beginning to know Paris, and to care for it with real
affection; to feel secure and happy and at home in this dear,
glittering, silvery-grey city&mdash;full of naked trees and bridges
and palaces. And, sometimes when I feel homesick, and lonely,
and when Brookhollow seems very, very far away, it troubles me
a little to find that I am not nearly so homesick as I think I
ought to be. But I think it must be like seasickness; it is too
frightful to last.</p>

<p>The Princess Mistchenka has nursed me through the worst. All
I can say is that she is very wonderful.</p>

<p>On her day, which is Thursday, her pretty <em>salon</em> is thronged.
At first I was too shy and embarrassed to be anything but frightened
and self-conscious and very miserable when I sat beside her on
her Thursdays. Besides, I was in mourning and did not appear on
formal occasions.</p>

<p>Now it is different; I take my place beside her; I am not self-conscious;
I am interested; I find pleasure in knowing people who are so
courteous, so considerate, so gay and entertaining.</p>

<p>Everybody is agreeable and gay, and I am sorry that I miss so
much that is witty in what is said; but I am learning French very
rapidly.</p>

<p>The men are polite to me! At first I was so <em>gauche</em>,
so stupid and provincial, that I could not bear to have anybody
kiss my hand and pay me compliments. I've made a lot of other
mistakes, too, but I never make the same mistake twice.</p>

<p>So many interesting men come to our Thursdays; and some women.
I prefer the men, I think. There is one old French General who
is a dear; and there are young officers, too; and yesterday two
cabinet ministers and several people from the British and Russian
embassies. And the Turkish Chargé, whom I dislike.</p>

<p>The women seem to be agreeable, and they all are most beautifully
gowned. Some have titles. But all seem to be a little too much
made up. I don't know any of them except formally. But I feel
that I know some of the men better&mdash;especially the old General
and a young military attaché of the Russian Embassy, whom everybody
likes and pets, and whom everybody calls Prince Erlik&mdash;such a
handsome boy! And his real name is Alak, and I think he is very
much in love with Princess Naïa.</p>

<p>Now, something very odd has happened which I wish to tell you
about. My father, as you know, was missionary in the Vilayet of
Trebizond many years ago. While there he came into possession
of a curious sea chest belonging to a German named Conrad Wilner,
who was killed in a riot near Gallipoli.</p>

<p>In this chest were, and still are, two very interesting things&mdash;an
old bronze Chinese figure which I used to play with when I was
a child. It was called the Yellow Devil; and a native Chinese
missionary once read for us the inscription on the figure which
identified it as a Mongol demon called Erlik, the Prince of Darkness.</p>

<p>The other object of interest in the box was the manuscript diary
kept by this Herr Wilner to within a few moments of his death.
This I have often heard read aloud by my father, but I forget
much of it now, and I never understood it all, because I was too
young. Now, here is the curious thing about it all. The first
time you spoke to me of the Princess Naïa Mistchenka, I had a
hazy idea that her name seemed familiar to me. And ever since
I have known her, now and then I found myself trying to recollect
where I had heard that name, even before I heard it from you.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one evening about a week ago, it came to me that I
had heard both the names, Naïa and Mistchenka, when I was a child.
Also the name Erlik. The two former names occur in Herr Wilner's
diary; the latter I heard from the Chinese missionary years ago;
and that is why they seemed so familiar to me.</p>

<p>It is so long since I have read the diary that I can't remember
the story in which the names Naïa and Mistchenka are concerned.
As I recollect, it was a tragic story that used to thrill me.</p>

<p>At any rate, I didn't speak of this to Princess Naïa; but about
a week ago there were a few people dining here with us&mdash;among
others an old Turkish Admiral, Murad Pasha, who took me out. And
as soon as I heard <em>his</em> name I thought of that diary;
and I am sure it was mentioned in it.</p>

<p>Anyway, he happened to speak of Trebizond; and, naturally, I
said that my father had been a missionary there many years ago.</p>

<p>As this seemed to interest him, and because he questioned me,
I told him my father's name and all that I knew in regard to his
career as a missionary in the Trebizond district. And, somehow
&mdash;I don't exactly recollect how it came about &mdash;I spoke
of Herr Wilner, and his death at Gallipoli, and how his effects
came into my father's possession.</p>

<p>And because the old, sleepy-eyed Admiral seemed so interested
and amused, I told him about Herr Wilner's box and his diary and
the plans and maps and photographs with which I used to play as
a little child.</p>

<p>After dinner, Princess Naïa asked me what it was I had been telling
Murad Pasha to wake him up so completely and to keep him so amused.
So I merely said that I had been telling the Admiral about my
childhood in Brookhollow.</p>

<p>Naturally neither she nor I thought about the incident any further.
Murad did not come again; but a few days later the Turkish Chargé
d'Affaires was present at a very large dinner given by Princess
Naïa.</p>

<p>And two curious conversations occurred at that dinner:</p>

<p>The Turkish Chargé suddenly turned to me and asked me in English
whether I were not the daughter of the Reverend Wilbour Carew
who once was in charge of the American Mission near Trebizond.
I was so surprised at the question; but I answered yes, remembering
that Murad must have mentioned me to him.</p>

<p>He continued to ask me about my father, and spoke of his efforts
to establish a girls' school, first at Brusa, then at Tchardak,
and finally near Gallipoli. I told him I had often heard my father
speak of these matters with my mother, but that I was too young
to remember anything about my own life in Turkey.</p>

<p>All the while we were conversing, I noticed that the Princess
kept looking across the table at us as though some chance word
had attracted her attention.</p>

<p>After dinner, when the gentlemen had retired to the smoking room,
the Princess took me aside and made me repeat everything that
Ahmed Mirka had asked me.</p>

<p>I told her. She said that the Turkish Chargé was an old busybody,
always sniffing about for all sorts of information; that it was
safer to be reticent and let him do the talking; and that almost
every scrap of conversation with him was mentally noted and later
transcribed for the edification of the Turkish Secret Service.</p>

<p>I thought this very humorous; but going into the little <em>salon</em>
where the piano was and where the music was kept, while I was
looking for an old song by Messager, from "La Basoche," called
"Je suis aimé de la plus belle&mdash;" Ahmed Mirka's handsome attaché,
Colonel Izzet Bey, came up to where I was rummaging in the music
cabinet.</p>

<p>He talked nonsense in French and in English for a while, but
somehow the conversation led again toward my father and the girls'
school at Gallipoli which had been attacked and burned by a mob
during the first month after it had been opened, and where the
German, Herr Wilner, had been killed.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, your reverend father, must surely have told you stories
about the destruction of the Gallipoli school, mademoiselle,"
he insisted.</p>

<p>"Yes. It happened a year before the mission at Trebizond was
destroyed by the Turks." I said maliciously.</p>

<p>"So I have heard. What a pity! Our Osmanli&mdash;our peasantry are
so stupid! And it was such a fine school. A German engineer was
killed there, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes, my father said so."</p>

<p>"A certain Herr Conrad Wilner, was it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How did you hear of him, Colonel Izzet?"</p>

<p>"It was known in Stamboul. He perished by mistake, I believe&mdash;at
Gallipoli."</p>

<p>"Yes; my father said that Herr Wilner was the only man hurt.
He went out all alone into the mob and began to cut them with
his riding whip. My father tried to save him, but they killed
Herr Wilner with stones."</p>

<p>"Exactly." He spread his beautifully jewelled hands deprecatingly
and seemed greatly grieved.</p>

<p>"And Herr Wilner's&mdash;property?" he inquired. "Did you ever hear
what became of it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," I said. "My father took charge of it."</p>

<p>"Oh! It was supposed at the time that all of Herr Wilner's personal
property was destroyed when the school and compound burned. Do
you happen to know just what was saved, mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>Of course I immediately thought of the bronze demon, the box
of instruments, and the photographs and papers at home with which
I used to play as a child. I remembered my father had said that
these things were taken on board the <em>Oneida</em> when he,
my mother, and I were rescued by marines and sailors from our
guard vessel which came through the Bosporus to the Black Sea,
and which escorted us to the <em>Oneida</em>. And I was just going
to tell this to Izzet Bey when I also remembered what the Princess
had just told me about giving any information to Ahmed Pasha.
So I merely opened my eyes very innocently and gazed at Colonel
Izzet and shook my head as though I did not understand his question.</p>

<p>The next instant the Princess came in to see what I was about
so long, and she looked at Izzet Bey with a funny sort of smile,
as though she had surprised him in mischief and was not angry,
only amused. And when Colonel Izzet bowed, I saw how red his face
had grown&mdash;as red as his fez.</p>

<p>The Princess laughed and said in French: "That is the difference
between professional and amateur&mdash;between Nizam and Redif&mdash;between
Ahmed Pasha and our esteemed but very youthful attaché&mdash;who has
much yet to learn about that endless war called Peace!"</p>

<p>I didn't know what she meant, but Izzet Bey turned a bright scarlet,
bowed again, and returned to the smoking room.</p>

<p>And that night, while Suzanne was unhooking me, Princess Naïa
came into my bedroom and asked me some questions, and I told her
about the box of instruments and the diary, and the slippery linen
papers covered with drawings and German writing, with which I
used to play.</p>

<p>She said never to mention them to anybody, and that I should
never permit anybody to examine those military papers, because
it might be harmful to America.</p>

<p>How odd and how thrilling! I am most curious to know what all
this means. It seems like an exciting story just beginning, and
I wonder what such a girl as I has to do with secrets which concern
the Turkish Chargé in Paris.</p>

<p>Don't you think it promises to be romantic? Do you suppose it
has anything to do with spies and diplomacy and kings and thrones,
and terrible military secrets? One hears a great deal about the
embassies here being hotbeds of political intrigue. And of course
France is always thinking of Alsace and Lorraine, and there is
an ever-present danger of war in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. Neeland, it thrills me to pretend to myself that I am actually
living in the plot of a romance full of mystery and diplomacy
and dangerous possibilities. I <em>hope</em> something will develop,
as something always does in novels.</p>

<p>And alas, my imagination, which always has been vivid, needed
almost nothing to blaze into flame. It is on fire now; I dream
of courts and armies, and ambassadors, and spies; I construct
stories in which I am the heroine always&mdash;sometimes the interesting
and temporary victim of wicked plots; sometimes the all-powerful,
dauntless, and adroit champion of honour and righteousness against
treachery and evil!</p>

<p>Did you ever suppose that I still could remain such a very little
girl? But I fear that I shall never outgrow my imagination. And
it needs almost nothing to set me dreaming out stories or drawing
pictures of castles and princes and swans and fairies. And even
this letter seems a part of some breathlessly interesting plot
which I am not only creating but actually a living part of and
destined to act in.</p>

<p>Do you want a part in it? Shall I include you? Rather late to
ask your permission, for I have already included you. And, somehow,
I think the Yellow Devil ought to be included, too.</p>

<p>Please write to me, just once. But don't speak of the papers
which father had, and don't mention Herr Conrad Wilner's box if
you write. The Princess says your letter might be stolen.</p>

<p>I am very happy. It is rather cold tonight, and presently Suzanne
will unhook me and I shall put on such a pretty negligée, and
then curl up in bed, turn on my reading light with the pink shade,
and continue to read the new novel recommended to me by Princess
Naïa, called "Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard." It is a perfectly
darling story, and Anatole France, who wrote it, must be a darling,
too. The Princess knows him and promises that he shall dine with
us some day. I expect to fall in love with him immediately.</p>

<p>Good night, dear Mr. Neeland. I <em>hope</em> you will write
to me.</p>

<p>This letter he finally did answer, not voluminously, but with
all cordiality. And, in a few days, forgot about it and about
the girl to whom it was written. And there was nothing more from
her until early summer.</p>

<p>Then came the last of her letters&mdash;an entirely mature missive,
firm in writing, decisive, concise, self-possessed, eloquent with
an indefinite something which betrayed a calmly ordered mind already
being moulded by discipline <em>mondaine</em>:</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Neeland:</p>

<p>I had your very kind and charming letter in reply to mine written
last January. My neglect to answer it, during all these months,
involves me in explanations which, if you like, are perhaps due
you. But if you require them at all, I had rather surrender them
to you personally when we meet.</p>

<p>Possibly that encounter, so happily anticipated on my part, may
occur sooner than you believe likely. I permit myself to hope
so. The note which I enclose to you from the lady whom I love
very dearly should explain why I venture to entertain a hope that
you and I are to see each other again in the near future.</p>

<p>As you were kind enough to inquire about myself and what you
describe so flatteringly as my "amazing progress in artistic and
worldly wisdom," I venture to reply to your questions in order:</p>

<p>They seem to be pleased with me at the school. I have a life-drawing
"on the wall," a composition sketch, and a "<em>concours</em>"
study in oil. That I have not burst to atoms with pride is a miracle
inexplicable.</p>

<p>I have been told that my progress at the piano is fair. But I
am very certain I shall do no more with vocal and instrumental
music than to play and sing acceptably for such kind and uncritical
friends as do not demand much of an amateur. Without any unusual
gifts, with a rather sensitive ear, and with a very slightly cultivated
and perfectly childish voice&mdash;please do not expect anything from
me to please you.</p>

<p>In French I am already becoming fluent. You see, except for certain
lessons in it, I have scarcely heard a word of English since I
came here; the Princess will not use it to me nor permit its use
by me. And therefore, my ear being a musical one and rather accurate,
I find&mdash;now that I look back upon my abysmal ignorance&mdash;a very
decided progress.</p>

<p>Also let me admit to you&mdash;and I have already done so, I see&mdash;that,
since I have been here, I have had daily lessons in English with
a cultivated English woman; and in consequence I have been learning
to enlarge a very meagre vocabulary, and have begun to appreciate
possibilities in my own language of which I never dreamed.</p>

<p>About my personal appearance&mdash;as long as you ask me &mdash;I
think perhaps that, were I less thin, I might be rather pretty.
Dress makes such a vast difference in a plain girl. Also, intelligent
care of one's person improves mediocrity. Of course everybody
says such gracious things to a girl over here that it would not
do to accept any pretty compliment very literally. But I really
believe that you might think me rather nice to look at.</p>

<p>As for the future, the truth is that I feel much encouraged.
I made some drawings in wash and in pen and ink&mdash;just ideas of
mine. And Monsieur Bonvard, who is editor of <em>The Grey Cat</em>&mdash;a
very clever weekly&mdash;has accepted them and has paid me twenty-five
francs each for them! I was so astonished that I could not believe
it. One has been reproduced in last week's paper. I have cut it
out and pasted it in my scrapbook.</p>

<p>I think, take it all in all, that seeing my first illustrations
printed has given me greater joy than I shall ever again experience
on earth.</p>

<p>My daily intercourse with the Princess Mistchenka continues to
comfort me, inspire me, and fill me with determination so to educate
myself that when the time comes I shall be ready and able to support
myself with pen and pencil.</p>

<p>And now I must bring my letter to its end. The prospect of seeing
you very soon is agreeable beyond words. You have been very kind
to me. I do not forget it.</p>

<p>Dear Jim:</p>

<p>If in the past it has been my good fortune to add anything to
yours, may I now invoke in you the memory of our very frank and
delightful friendship?</p>

<p>When you first returned to America from Paris I found it possible
to do for you a few favours in the way of making you known to
certain editors. It was, I assure you, merely because I liked
you and believed in your work, not because I ever expected to
ask from you any favour in return.</p>

<p>Now, Fate has thrown an odd combination from her dice-box; and
Destiny has veiled herself so impenetrably that nobody can read
that awful visage to guess what thoughts possess her.</p>

<p>You, in America, have heard of the murder of the Austrian Archduke,
of course. But&mdash;have you, in America, any idea what the consequences
of that murder may lead to?</p>

<p>Enough of that. Now for the favour I ask.</p>

<p>Will you go <em>at once</em> to Brookhollow, go to Ruhannah's
house, open it, take from it a chest made of olive wood and bound
with some metal which looks like silver, lock the box, take it
to New York, place it in a safe deposit vault until you can sail
for Paris on the first steamer that leaves New York?</p>

<p>Will you do this&mdash;get the box I have described and bring it to
me yourself on the first steamer that sails?</p>

<p>And, Jim, keep your eye on the box. Don't trust anybody near
it. Rue says that, as she recollects, the box is about the size
and shape of a suitcase and that it has a canvas and leather cover
with a handle which buttons over it.</p>

<p>Therefore, you can carry it yourself exactly as though it were
your suitcase, keep it with you in the train and on shipboard.</p>

<p>Will you do this, Jim? It is much to ask of you. I break in upon
your work and cause you great inconvenience and trouble and expense.
But&mdash;will you do it for me?</p>

<p>Much depends upon your doing this. I think that possibly the
welfare of your own country might depend on your doing this for
me.</p>

<p>If you find yourself embarrassed financially, cable me just one
word, "Black," and I shall arrange matters through a New York
bank.</p>

<p>If you feel that you do not care to do me this favour, cable
the single word, "White."</p>

<p>If you have sufficient funds, and are willing to bring the box
to me yourself, cable the word, "Blue."</p>

<p>In case that you undertake this business for me, be careful of
the contents of the box. Let nobody see it open. Be certain that
the contents are absolutely secure. I dare not tell you how vitally
important to civilisation these papers already are&mdash;how much they
may mean to the world; what powers of evil they might encourage
if in any way they fall into other hands than the right ones.</p>

<p>Jim, I have seldom taken a very serious tone with you since we
have known each other. I am very serious now. And if our friendship
means anything to you, prove it!</p>

<p>As he sat there in his studio, perplexed, amazed, annoyed, yet
curious, trying to think out what he ought to do&mdash;what, in fact,
must be done somehow or other&mdash;there came a ring at his door bell.
A messenger with a cable despatch stood there; Neeland signed,
tore open the envelope, and read:</p>

<p>Please go at once to Brookhollow and secure an olive-wood box
bound with silver, containing military maps, plans, photographs,
and papers written in German, property of Ruhannah Carew. Lose
no time, I implore you, as an attempt to rob the house and steal
the papers is likely. Beware of anybody resembling a German. Have
written, but beg you not to wait for letter.</p>

<p>Twice he reread the cablegram. Then, with a half-bewildered,
half-disgusted glance around at his studio, his belongings, the
unfinished work on his easel, he went to the telephone.</p>

<p>It being July he had little difficulty in reserving a good stateroom
on the Cunarder <em>Volhynia</em>, sailing the following day.
Then, summoning the janitor, he packed a steamer trunk and gave
order to have it taken aboard that evening.</p>

<p>On his way downtown to his bank he stopped at a telegraph and
cable office and sent a cable message to the Princess Mistchenka.
The text consisted of only one word: "Blue."</p>

<p>He departed for Gayfield on the five o'clock afternoon train,
carrying with him a suitcase and an automatic pistol in his breast
pocket.</p>
