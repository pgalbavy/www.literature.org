<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Within the dim interior of the strange rocky chamber where he had
been so ruthlessly deposited, Tarzan immediately became the center
of interest to the several Alali young that crowded about him. They
examined him carefully, turned him over, pawed him, pinched him, and at
last one of the young males, attracted by the golden locket removed it
from the ape-man's neck and placed it about his own. Lowest, perhaps,
in the order of human evolution nothing held their interest over-long,
with the result that they soon tired of Tarzan and trooped out into
the sun-lit courtyard, leaving the ape-man to regain consciousness as
best he could, or not at all. It was immaterial to them which he did.
Fortunately for the Lord of the Jungle the fall through the roof of the
forest had been broken by the fortuitous occurrence of supple branches
directly in the path of his descent, with the happy result that he
suffered only from a slight concussion of the brain. Already he was
slowly regaining consciousness, and not long after the Alali young had
left him his eyes opened, rolled dully about the dim interior of his
prison, and closed again. His breathing was normal and when again he
opened his eyes it was as though he had emerged from a deep and natural
slumber, the only reminder of his accident being a dull aching of the
head.
</p>
<p>Sitting up, he looked about him, his eyes gradually accustoming
themselves to the dim light of the chamber. He found himself in a rude
shelter constructed of great slabs of rock. A single opening led into
what appeared to be another similar chamber the interior of which,
however, was much lighter than that in which he lay. Slowly he rose
to his feet and crossed to the opening. Across the second chamber he
beheld another doorway leading into the fresh air and the sunshine.
Except for filthy heaps of dead grasses on the floor the rooms both
were unfurnished and devoid of any suggestion that they were utilized
as places of human habitation. From the second doorway, to which he
crossed, he looked out upon a narrow courtyard walled by great slabs of
stone, the lower ends of which, embedded in the ground, caused them to
remain erect. Here he saw the young Alali squatting about, some in the
sun, others in the shadow. Tarzan looked at them in evident puzzlement.
What were they? What was this place in which he was, all too evidently,
incarcerated? Were these his keepers or were they his fellow prisoners?
How had he come hither?
</p><p>Running his fingers through his shock of black hair in a
characteristic gesture of perplexity, he shook his head. He recalled
the unfortunate termination of the flight; he even remembered falling
through the foliage of the great tree; but beyond that all was blank.
He stood for a moment examining the Alali, who were all unconscious of
his near presence or his gaze upon them, and then he stepped boldly
out into the courtyard before them, as a lion, fearless, ignores the
presence of jackals.
</p><p>Immediately they saw him, they rose and clustered about him, the girls
pushing the boys aside and coming boldly close, and Tarzan spoke to
them, first in one native dialect and then in another, but they seemed
not to understand, for they made no reply, and then, as a last resort,
he addressed them in the primitive language of the great apes, the
language of Manu the monkey, the first language that Tarzan had learned
when, as a babe, he suckled at the hairy breast of Kala, the she-ape,
and listened to the gutturals of the savage members of the tribe of
Kerchak; but again his auditors made no response--at least no audible
response, though they moved their hands and shoulders and bodies, and
jerked their heads in what the ape-man soon recognized as a species of
sign language, nor did they utter any vocal sounds that might indicate
that they were communicating with one another through the medium of a
spoken language. Presently they again lost interest in the newcomer
and resumed their indolent lounging about the walls of the courtyard
while Tarzan paced to and fro its length, his keen eye searching for
whatever avenue of escape chance might provide, and he saw it in the
height of the walls, to the top of which a long, running jump would
take his outstretched fingers, he was sure; but not yet--he must wait
for darkness to shield his attempt from those within the enclosure and
those without. And as darkness approached the actions of the other
occupants of the courtyard became noticeably altered; they walked back
and forth, constantly passing and repassing the entrance to the shelter
at the end of the courtyard, and occasionally entering the first room
and often passing to the second room where they listened for a moment
before the great slab that closed the outer aperture; then back into
the courtyard again and back and forth in restless movement. Finally
one stamped a foot upon the ground and this was taken up by the others
until, in regular cadence, the thud, thud, thud of their naked feet
must have been audible for some distance beyond the confines of their
narrow prison yard.
</p><p>Whatever this procedure might have been intended to accomplish,
nothing, apparently, resulted, and presently one of the girls, her
sullen face snarling in anger, seized her bludgeon more firmly in
her two hands and stepping close to one of the walls began to pound
violently upon one of its huge stone slabs. Instantly the other girls
followed her example, while the young males continued beating time with
their heels.
</p><p>For a while Tarzan was puzzled for an explanation of their behavior,
but it was his own stomach that at last suggested an answer--the
creatures were hungry and were attempting to attract the attention of
their jailers; and their method of doing so suggested something else,
as well, something of which his past brief experience with them had
already partially convinced him--the creatures were without speech,
even totally unvocal, perhaps.
</p><p>The girl who had started the pounding upon the wall suddenly stopped
and pointed at Tarzan. The others looked at him and then back at her,
whereupon she pointed at her bludgeon and then at Tarzan again, after
which she acted out a little pantomime, very quickly, very briefly,
but none the less realistically. The pantomime depicted the bludgeon
falling upon Tarzan's head, following which the pantomimist, assisted
by her fellows, devoured the ape-man. The bludgeons ceased to fall
upon the wall; the heels no longer smote the earth; the assemblage was
interested in the new suggestion. They eyed Tarzan hungrily. The mother
who should have brought them food, The First Woman, was dead. They
did not know this; all they knew was that they were hungry and that
The First Woman had brought them no food since the day before. They
were not cannibals. Only in the last stages of hunger, would they have
devoured one another, even as ship-wrecked sailors of civilized races
have been known to do; but they did not look upon the stranger as one
of their own kind. He was as unlike them as some of the other creatures
that The First Woman had brought them to feed upon. It was no more
wrong to devour him than it would have been to devour an antelope. The
thought, however, would not have occurred to most of them; the older
girl it was who had suggested it to them, nor would it have occurred
to her had there been other food, for she knew that he had not been
brought here for that purpose--he had been brought as the mate of The
First Woman, who in common with the other women of this primitive race
hunted a new mate each season among the forests and the jungles where
the timid males lived their solitary lives except for the brief weeks
that they were held captive in the stone corrals of the dominant sex,
and where they were treated with great brutality and contempt even by
the children of their temporary spouses.
</p><p>Sometimes they managed to escape, though rarely, but eventually they
were turned loose, since it was easier to hunt a new one the following
season than to feed one in captivity for a whole year. There was
nothing approximating love in the family relations of these savage
half-brutes. The young, conceived without love, knowing not their own
fathers, possessed not even an elemental affection for one another, nor
for any other living thing. A certain tie bound them to their savage
mothers, at whose breasts they suckled for a few short months and to
whom they looked for food until they were sufficiently developed to
go forth into the forests and make their own kills or secure whatever
other food bountiful Nature provided for them.
</p><p>Somewhere between the ages of fifteen and seventeen the young males
were liberated and chased into the forest, after which their mothers
knew them not from any other male and at a similar age the females
were taken to the maternal cave, where they lived, accompanying their
mothers on the daily hunt, until they had succeeded in capturing a
first mate. After that they took up their abodes in separate caves and
the tie between parent and child was cut as cleanly as though it never
had existed, and they might, the following season, even become rivals
for the same man, or at any time quarrel to the death over the spoils
of the chase.
</p><p>The building of the stone shelters and corrals in which the children
and the males were kept was the only community activity in which the
women engaged and this work they were compelled to do alone, since
the men would have escaped into the forest at the first opportunity
had they been released from the corrals to take part in the work of
construction, while the children as soon as they had become strong
enough to be of any assistance would doubtless have done likewise; but
the great shes were able to accomplish their titanic labors alone.
</p><p>Equipped by nature with mighty frames and thews of steel they quarried
the great slabs from a side-hill overlooking the amphitheater, slid
them to the floor of the little valley and pulled and pushed them into
position by main strength and awkwardness, as the homely saying of our
forefathers has it.
</p><p>Fortunately for them it was seldom necessary to add to the shelters
and corrals already built since the high rate of mortality among the
females ordinarily left plenty of vacant enclosures for maturing
girls. Jealousy, greed, the hazards of the hunt, the contingencies of
inter-tribal wars all took heavy toll among the adult shes. Even the
despised male, fighting for his freedom, sometimes slew his captor.
</p><p>The hideous life of the Alalus was the natural result of the unnatural
reversal of sex dominance. It is the province of the male to initiate
love and by his masterfulness to inspire first respect, then admiration
in the breast of the female he seeks to attract. Love itself developed
after these other emotions. The gradually increasing ascendency of
the female Alalus over the male eventually prevented the emotions of
respect and admiration for the male from being aroused, with the result
that love never followed.
</p><p>Having no love for her mate and having become a more powerful brute,
the savage Alalus woman soon came to treat the members of the opposite
sex with contempt and brutality with the result that the power, or at
least the desire, to initiate love ceased to exist in the heart of
the male--he could not love a creature he feared and hated, he could
not respect or admire the unsexed creatures that the Alali women had
become, and so he fled into the forests and the jungles and there the
dominant females hunted him lest their race perish from the earth.
</p><p>It was the offspring of such savage and perverted creatures that Tarzan
faced, fully aware of their cannibalistic intentions. The males did not
attack him at once, but busily engaged themselves in fetching dry grass
and small pieces of wood from one of the covered chambers, and while
the three girls, one of them scarce seven years of age, approached the
ape-man warily with ready bludgeons, they prepared a fire over which
they expected soon to be broiling juicy cuts from the strange creature
that their hairy dam had brought them.
</p><p>One of the males, a lad of sixteen, held back, making excited signs
with hands, head and body. He appeared to be trying to dissuade or
prevent the girls from the carrying out of their plan, he even appealed
to the other boys for backing, but they merely glanced at the girls and
continued their culinary preparations. At last however, as the girls
were deliberately approaching the ape-man he placed himself directly
in their path and attempted to stop them. Instantly the three little
demons swung their bludgeons and sprang forward to destroy him. The boy
dodged, plucked several of the feathered stones from his girdle and
flung them at his assailants. So swift and so accurate did the missiles
speed that two girls dropped, howling, to the ground. The third missed,
striking one of the other boys on the temple, killing him instantly.
He was the youth who had stolen Tarzan's locket, which, being like all
his fellow males a timid creature, he had kept continually covered by
a palm since the ape-man's return to consciousness had brought him out
into the courtyard among them.
</p><p>The older girl, nothing daunted, leaped forward, her face hideous in
a snarl of rage. The boy cast another stone at her and then turned
and ran toward the ape-man. What reception he expected he himself
probably did not know. Perhaps it was the recrudescence of a long dead
emotion of fellowship that prompted him to place himself at Tarzan's
side--possibly Tarzan himself in whom loyalty to kind was strong had
inspired this reawakening of an atrophied soul-sense. However that may
be the fact remains that the boy came and stood at Tarzan's side while
the girl, evidently sensing danger to herself in this strange, new
temerity of her brother, advanced more cautiously.
</p><p>In signs she seemed to be telling him what she would do to him if
he did not cease to interpose his weak will between her and her
gastronomic desires; but he signed back at her defiantly and stood
his ground. Tarzan reached over and patted him on the back, smiling.
The boy bared his teeth horribly, but it seemed evident that he was
trying to return the ape-man's smile. And now the girl was almost upon
them. Tarzan was quite at a loss as to how to proceed against her. His
natural chivalry restrained him from attacking her and made it seem
most repellant to injure her even in self-preservation; but he knew
that before he was done with her he might even possibly have to kill
her and so, while looking for an alternative, he steeled himself for
the deed he loathed; but yet he hoped to escape without that.
</p><p>The Third Woman, conducting her new mate from the cave to the corral
where she would keep him imprisoned for a week or two, had heard the
cadenced beating of naked heels and heavy bludgeons arising from the
corral of The First Woman and immediately guessed their import. The
welfare of the offspring of The First Woman concerned her not as an
individual. Community instinct, however, prompted her to release them
that they might search for food and their services not be lost to the
tribe through starvation. She would not feed them, of course, as they
did not belong to her, but she would open their prison gate and turn
them loose to fend for themselves, to find food or not to find it, to
survive or to perish according to the inexorable law of the survival of
the fittest.
</p><p>But The Third Woman took her time. Her powerful fingers entangled in
the hair of her snarling spouse she dragged the protesting creature to
her corral, removed the great slab from before the entrance, pushed the
man roughly within, accelerating his speed with a final kick, replaced
the slab and turned leisurely toward the nearby corral of The First
Woman. Removing the stone door she passed through the two chambers and
entered the corral at the moment that the oldest girl was advancing
upon Tarzan. Pausing by the entranceway she struck her bludgeon against
the stone wall of the shelter, evidently to attract the attention of
those within the corral. Instantly all looked in her direction. She was
the first adult female, other than their own dam, that the children of
The First Woman had seen. They shrunk from her in evident terror. The
youth at Tarzan's side slunk behind the ape-man, nor did Tarzan wonder
at their fear. The Third Woman was the first adult Alalus he had seen,
since all of the time that he had been in the hands of The First Woman
he had been unconscious.
</p><p>The girl who had been threatening him with her great club seemed now to
have forgotten him, and instead stood with snarling face and narrowed
eyes confronting the newcomer. Of all the children she seemed the least
terrified.
</p><p>The ape-man scrutinized the huge, brutish female standing at the far
end of the corral with her savage eyes upon him. She had not seen him
before as she had been in the forest hunting at the time that The First
Woman had brought her prize back to the amphitheater. She had not
known that The First Woman had any male in her corral other than her
own spawn. Here, indeed, was a prize. She would remove him to her own
corral. With this idea in mind, and knowing that, unless he succeeded
in dodging past her and reaching the entranceway ahead of her, he could
not escape her, she moved very slowly toward him, ignoring now the
other occupants of the corral.
</p><p>Tarzan, not guessing her real purpose, thought that she was about to
attack him as a dangerous alien in the sacred precincts of her home. He
viewed her great bulk, her enormous muscular development and the huge
bludgeon swinging in her hamlike hand and compared them with his own
defenseless nakedness.
</p><p>To the jungle-born flight from useless and uneven combat carries with
it no stigma of cowardice, and not only was Tarzan of the Apes jungle
born and jungle raised, but the stripping of his clothes from him
had now, as always before, stripped also away the thin and unnatural
veneer of his civilization. It was, then, a savage beast that faced the
oncoming Alalus woman--a cunning beast as well as a powerful one--a
beast that knew when to fight and when to flee.
</p><p>Tarzan cast a quick glance behind him. There crouched the Alalus lad,
trembling in fear. Beyond was the rear wall of the corral, one of the
great stone slabs of which tilted slightly outward. Slow is the mind
of man, slower his eye by comparison with the eye and the mind of the
trapped beast seeking escape. So quick was the ape-man that he was gone
before The Third Woman had guessed that he was contemplating flight,
and with him had gone the eldest Alalus boy.
</p><p>Wheeling, all in a single motion Tarzan had swung the young male to
his shoulder, leaped swiftly the few paces that had separated him from
the rear wall of the corral, and, catlike, run up the smooth surface
of the slightly tilted slab until his fingers closed upon the top,
drawn himself over without a single backward glance, dropped the youth
to the ground upon the opposite side, following him so quickly that
they alighted almost together. Then he glanced about. For the first
time he saw the natural amphitheater and the caves before several of
which women still squatted. It would soon be dark. The sun was dropping
behind the crest of the western hills. Tarzan saw but a single avenue
of escape--the opening at the lower end of the amphitheater through
which the trail led down into the valley and the forest below. Toward
this he ran, followed by the youth.
</p><p>Presently a woman, sitting before the entrance to her cave, saw him.
Seizing her cudgel she leaped to her feet and gave immediate chase.
Attracted by her another and another took up the pursuit, until five or
six of them thundered along the trail.
</p><p>The youth, pointing the way, raced swiftly ahead of the ape-man, but,
swift as he was, he could not out-distance the lithe muscles that had
so often in the past carried their master safely from the swift rush
of a maddened Numa, or won him a meal against the fleetness of Bara
the deer. The heavy, lumbering women behind them had no chance of
overhauling this swift pair if they were to depend entirely upon speed,
but that they had no intention of doing. They had their stone missiles
with which, almost from birth, they had practiced until approximate
perfection was attained by each in casting them at either stationary
or moving targets. But it was growing dark, the trail twisted and
turned and the speed of the quarry made them elusive marks at which
to cast an accurate missile that would be so timed as to stun rather
than to kill. Of course more often than not a missile intended to stun
did actually kill, but the quarry must take that chance. Instinct
warned the women against killing the males, though it did not warn them
against treating them with the utmost brutality. Had Tarzan realized
why the women were pursuing him he would have run even faster than he
did, and when the missiles began to fly past his head perhaps he did
accelerate his speed a trifle.
</p><p>Soon the ape-man reached the forest and as though he had dissolved into
thin air disappeared from the astonished view of his pursuers, for now,
indeed, was he in his own element. While they looked for him upon the
ground he swung swiftly through the lower terraces, keeping in view the
Alalus boy racing along the trail beneath him.
</p><p>But with the man escaped, the women stopped and turned back toward
their caves. The youth they did not want. For two or three years he
would roam the forests unmolested by his own kind, and if he escaped
the savage beasts and the spears and arrows of the ant-people he would
come to man's estate and be fair prey for any of the great shes during
the mating season. For the time being, at least, he would lead a
comparatively safe and happy existence.
</p><p>His chances of survival had been materially lessened by his early
escape into the forest. Had The First Woman lived she would have kept
him safely within the walls of her corral for another year at least,
when he would have been better fitted to cope with the dangers and
emergencies of the savage life of the forest and the jungle.
</p><p>The boy, his keen ears telling him that the women had given up the
pursuit, halted and looked back for the strange creature that had freed
him from the hated corral, but he could see only a short distance
through the darkness of the growing forest night. The stranger was
not in sight. The youth pricked up his great ears and listened
intently. There was no sound of human footsteps other than the rapidly
diminishing ones of the retreating women. There were other sounds,
however, unfamiliar forest sounds that filled his muddy brain with
vague terrors. Sounds that came from the surrounding underbrush; sounds
that came from the branches above his head, and, too, there were
terrifying odors.
</p><p>Darkness, complete and impenetrable, had closed in upon him with a
suddenness that left him trembling. He could almost feel it weighing
down upon him, crushing him and at the same time leaving him exposed
to nameless terrors. He looked about him and could see naught, so that
it seemed to him that he was without eyes, and being without a voice
he could not call out either to frighten his enemies or attract the
attention of the strange creature that had befriended him, and whose
presence had so strangely aroused in his own breast an inexplicable
emotion--a pleasurable emotion. He could not explain it; he had no word
for it who had no word for anything, but he felt it and it still warmed
his bosom and he wished in his muddy way that he could make a noise
that would attract that strange creature to him again. He was lonely
and much afraid.
</p><p>A crackling of the bushes nearby aroused him to new and more intimate
terror. Something large was approaching through the black night. The
youth stood with his back against a great tree. He dared not move. He
sniffed but what movement of the air there was took course from him
in the direction of the thing that was creeping upon him out of the
terrible forest, and so he could not identify it; but his instinct told
him that the creature had identified him and was doubtless creeping
closer to leap upon him and devour him.
</p><p>He knew naught of lions, unless instinct carries with it a picture
of the various creatures of which the denizens of the wild are
instinctively afraid. In all his life he had never been outside the
corral of The First Woman and as his people are without speech his dam
could have told him nothing of the outside world, yet when the lion
roared he knew that it was a lion.
