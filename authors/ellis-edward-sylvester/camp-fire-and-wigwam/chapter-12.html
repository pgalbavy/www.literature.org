<p>The canoe was made of bark, with the ends turned up in the usual
fashion. Two long paddles belonging to it lay within, and were
taken by the warriors, who paddled it down to where the party
were in waiting. All stepped carefully inside, and the same Indians
who brought it from its hiding place turned the prow toward the
other shore and began swinging the paddles with the freedom and
vigor peculiar to their people. Jack was the last to seat himself,
and he held fast as best he could, dreading some of the rude jokes
of his captors.</p>

<p>When all were in position, and the craft began moving, great
care was necessary, for it sank to the gunwales, and a slight
disturbance would be enough to overturn the frail boat. Although
Jack feared such an occurrence, yet the Indians themselves were
no more desirous it should take place than was he.</p>

<p>He naturally fixed his eyes on the line of warriors seated in
front of him. All faced the shore they were approaching, and the
couple using the paddles dipped first one end on the right and
the other end on the left of the canoe. They put forth little
exertion. Had they chosen to do so, they could have tripled the
speed, though most likely an upset would have been the consequence.</p>

<p>The middle of the stream was not reached, when a small fish leaped
out of the water in front and fell back again. Ogallah uttered
an exclamation, and, reaching his hand over the side of the boat,
held it several inches under the surface. The two Indians not
using the paddles did the same, just as a party of young people
will do when taking a pleasure sail over some calm lake.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ogallah gave a quick flirt of the submerged hand, flinging
the sparkling water over all. Something flashed in the sunlight,
and a plump fish, weighing fully a pound, dropped into the canoe.
Almost immediately the other two warriors did the same, one of
them securing a prize weighing as much as both the others. The
fact was, the boat was passing through something like a school
of fish, and the red men found no difficulty in capturing a number.</p>

<p>"That looks like dinner," thought Jack with a chuckle, as he
also dipped his hand to grope for the finny delicacies. He had
less than a minute to wait when something cold and smooth touched
his fingers. He made a desperate clutch, sinking his arm to his
elbow, but the fish was too quick, and darted beyond his reach,
just as Ogallah landed another tempting one.</p>

<p>Several more were taken, but Jack could not succeed in closing
his fingers quickly enough to keep the fish from slipping away.
By the time the other side of the stream was reached, a good supply
had been secured, and the boy forgot his sorrow in the pleasure
of anticipating that his hunger would be fully satisfied.</p>

<p>Happily he was not disappointed in this respect, for, while the
oarsmen were drawing the boat out of the water, the others were
preparing the fire with which to cook the fish, that were speedily
dressed. They were the "white" species common in the west, and
when browned to a juicy crisp, formed as luscious a meal as any
epicure could ask. Best of all, there was an abundance, and Jack
Carleton ate until he wanted no more.</p>

<p>Having tramped so many miles since the rising of the sun, Ogallah
and his warriors were disposed to enjoy a good rest.</p>

<p>Their pipes were relighted and they lolled about in the same
lazy fashion, paying no special heed to Jack, who knew the unwisdom
of making any effort to get away.</p>

<p>All this convinced the boy that the party had still a considerable
distance to travel. Had they been in the neighborhood of their
village, they would have pushed on without stopping. At any rate,
they would not have paused to kindle the camp-fire and to cook
a meal at mid-day.</p>

<p>"It must be," Jack said to himself, with several nods of his
head, "that we are to spend another night on the road: if that
is so, I'll make a break if I have to suffer for it."</p>

<p>These were vaunting words, but he was in earnest. Except for
the hope thus renewed within him, the youth would have given way
to the drowsiness which became quite common with the rest, but
a line of speculation was started which kept his mind occupied
during the full hour the party dawdled about the camp-fire.</p>

<p>At the end of the time named, the ashes were knocked from the
pipes, several stretched their limbs and yawned, and the sullen-faced
warrior who had been taking care of Jack's rifle, passed it back
to him with some surly word, which most likely meant that thereafter
the captive should bear his own burdens. The boy was glad enough
to regain his weapon, but he smiled when he observed that it had
no charge in it. His captors were determined not to put temptation
in his way.</p>

<p>It took the company a considerable time to "shake themselves
together." They straggled and kept irregular step, and finally,
when they began ascending a slope, where the ground was much broken
and covered with stones, they gave it up altogether. The ascent
continued until they found themselves on an elevation several
hundred feet high, and so devoid of vegetation that a view was
gained which covered an area of hundreds of square miles in every
direction.</p>

<p>Standing on this lookout, as it may be called, the Indians devoted
a number of minutes to such survey. No employment just then could
be more entertaining, and Jack Carleton adopted it.</p>

<p>The scene was too similar to those with which the reader of these
pages has become familiar to need any lengthened reference in
this place. It was green, billowy forest in every direction. Here
and there a stream wound like a silver ribbon through the emerald
wilderness, sometimes gleaming in the sunlight, and then disappearing
among the vegetation, to reappear miles away, and finally to vanish
from sight altogether as it wound its way toward the Gulf. At
remote points the trained eye could detect the thin, wavy column
of vapor motionless against the sky, a mute witness that beings
other than those on the hill were stealing through the vast solitude
in their quest for game or prey.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Jack Carleton readily detected these "signs," as
the hunter terms them, it followed they must have been noted by
the Indians themselves; but they gave no evidence of any excitement
on that account. It was natural that such evidences of the presence
of other persons in the immense territory should present themselves.</p>

<p>But the youth failed to find that for which he specially looked.
Observing the chieftain gazing earnestly toward the west, he did
the same, expecting to catch sight of the Indian village where
Ogallah and his warriors made their home. He descried a wooded
ridge stretching across his field of vision, but not the first
resemblance to village or wigwam could be discovered.</p>

<p>"He is not looking for <em>that</em>," thought Jack, "but is
expecting some signal which will appear on the ridge."</p>

<p>One of the other Indians was peering with equal intentness at
the same point, but the minutes passed and nothing presented itself.
Jack joined in the scrutiny, but he could not succeed where they
failed.</p>

<p>All at once the sachem seemed to lose patience. He said some
vigorous things, accompanied by equally vigorous gestures, and
then the whole party began hastily gathering wood. In a short
while this was kindled and burning strongly. When the flames were
fairly going, one of the warriors who had collected several handfuls
of damp leaves by digging under the dry ones, dropped them carefully
on the blaze. It looked at first as if the fire would be put out,
but it struggled upward, and by-and-by a column of dense black
smoke stained the sky like the smutty finger of some giant tracing
a wavy line across it.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <em>THE SIGNAL</em>]</p>

<p>Then Ogallah and one of his men held his blanket spread out so
as almost to force the thick smoke to the ground, but such was
not their purpose. The blanket was abruptly lifted, then swayed
in a peculiar fashion, the two moving in perfect unison, without
speaking, and repeating their pantomime with the regularity of
machinery, for the space of fully ten minutes.</p>

<p>The results were singular. The inky column of vapor was broken
into a number of sections, as may be said, so that when viewed
from a distance the figure was that of a black broad band of enormous
height, separated by belts of colorless air into a dozen pieces
or divisions, the upper ones gradually melting into nothingness.
Besides this, so deftly had the red men manipulated the fire and
blanket, that these divisions showed a peculiar wavy appearance,
which would have excited wondering remark, no matter by whom seen.</p>

<p>"It is a signal to some one on the ridge yonder," was the conclusion
of Jack, who watched the proceeding with much interest.</p>

<p>Having finished, Ogallah and the warrior threw the blanket on
the ground, and the whole five gazed at the ridge miles away.
For a time perfect silence reigned, and then one of the dusky
watchers uttered an exclamation, to which the chief responded
with a grunt.</p>

<p>While scanning the distant ridge, Jack detected a black brush
of vapor climbing slowly above the trees. It broke clean off,
and as it went on upward, was inclosed by clear air on all sides.
But it was not long before a second, third, fourth, and fifth
appeared. Parties were answering the signal of the chief in precisely
the same manner that he made it. The only difference was in the
number, of which there were only the five. Those, however, were
sufficient, as the parties making it were well aware.</p>

<p>This aboriginal system of telegraphy, which has been in use from
time immemorial, is still a favorite means of communication among
the Indians of the West. More than once the news of the signing
of some important treaty, or the war movement of tribes, has been
flashed by means of signal fires from mountain top to mountain
top over a distance of hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>The information given by the answering signal fire was satisfactory
to the chief Ogallah, who resumed the journey at a leisurely pace,
making no effort to walk in the close Indian file that he and
his warriors did when further away from home.</p>

<p>"If we reach the village before going into camp," concluded Jack,
"we must keep moving until after dark. The sun is setting and
the ridge is still a good ways off."</p>

<p>It soon became manifest that the red men had no purpose of tiring
themselves by walking. They were at the base of the ridge when
they came upon a small stream which dashed down the mountain side
with a musical plash, forming currents, eddies, and cascades,
while in the depths of some pebbly pool it was as silent and clear
as liquid mountain air.</p>

<p>The afternoon was more sultry than the early portion of the day,
and every member of the company quaffed his fill from the refreshing
element. Jack's heart gave a great bound of hope when he saw that
Ogallah meant to spend the night there. He was strongly convinced
that he would gain an opportunity to steal away during the darkness,
which promised to be denser than on the previous night. Although
the day had been clear and beautiful, yet the clouds gathered
after the sun went down, and there were signs of a storm. Low
mutterings of distant thunder and the fitful flashes of lightning
showed the interchange of electricity between the earth and sky,
though it might not develop to any great extent for many hours
to come.</p>

<p>No hunt was made for game, and after the abundant meal earlier
in the day, Jack could not complain if compelled to fast until
morning. A fire was kindled precisely as before, a sturdy oak
forming the background, while the others lolled around it and
smoked their long-stemmed pipes.</p>

<p>When Jack Carleton was invited to retire to his couch by the
sullen warrior, he obeyed as though pleased with the prospect
of a full night's rest. Ogallah stretched out with one of his
men, while the ill-tempered member sat down with his back against
the tree, as though desirous of imitating his leader in every
respect.</p>
