I must go back a little way with my story.  In the previous book I 
have described the kind of education that happens to a man of my 
class nowadays, and it has been convenient to leap a phase in my 
experience that I must now set out at length.  I want to tell in 
this second hook how I came to marry, and to do that I must give 
something of the atmosphere in which I first met my wife and some 
intimations of the forces that went to her making.  I met her in 
Staffordshire while I was staying with that uncle of whom I have 
already spoken, the uncle who sold my father's houses and settled my 
mother in Penge.  Margaret was twenty then and I was twenty-two.
<P>
It was just before the walking tour in Switzerland that opened up so 
much of the world to me.  I saw her once, for an afternoon, and 
circumstances so threw her up in relief that I formed a very vivid 
memory of her.  She was in the sharpest contrast with the industrial 
world about her; she impressed me as a dainty blue flower might do, 
come upon suddenly on a clinker heap.  She remained in my mind at 
once a perplexing interrogation and a symbol. . . .
<P>
But first I must tell of my Staffordshire cousins and the world that 
served as a foil for her.
<P>

<P>
<P>
I first went to stay with my cousins when I was an awkward youth of 
sixteen, wearing deep mourning for my mother.  My uncle wanted to 
talk things over with me, he said, and if he could, to persuade me 
to go into business instead of going up to Cambridge.
<P>
I remember that visit on account of all sorts of novel things, but 
chiefly, I think, because it was the first time I encountered 
anything that deserves to be spoken of as wealth.  For the first 
time in my life I had to do with people who seemed to have endless 
supplies of money, unlimited good clothes, numerous servants; whose 
daily life was made up of things that I had hitherto considered to 
be treats or exceptional extravagances.  My cousins of eighteen and 
nineteen took cabs, for instance, with the utmost freedom, and 
travelled first-class in the local trains that run up and down the 
district of the Five Towns with an entire unconsciousness of the 
magnificence, as it seemed to me, of such a proceeding.
<P>
The family occupied a large villa in Newcastle, with big lawns 
before it and behind, a shrubbery with quite a lot of shrubs, a 
coach house and stable, and subordinate dwelling-places for the 
gardener and the coachman.  Every bedroom contained a gas heater and 
a canopied brass bedstead, and had a little bathroom attached 
equipped with the porcelain baths and fittings my uncle 
manufactured, bright and sanitary and stamped with his name, and the 
house was furnished throughout with chairs and tables in bright 
shining wood, soft and prevalently red Turkish carpets, cosy 
corners, curtained archways, gold-framed landscapes, overmantels, a 
dining-room sideboard like a palace with a large Tantalus, and 
electric light fittings of a gay and expensive quality.  There was a 
fine billiard-room on the ground floor with three comfortable sofas 
and a rotating bookcase containing an excellent collection of the 
English and American humorists from THREE MEN IN A BOAT to the 
penultimate Mark Twain.  There was also a conservatory opening out 
of the dining-room, to which the gardener brought potted flowers in 
their season. . . .
<P>
My aunt was a little woman with a scared look and a cap that would 
get over one eye, not very like my mother, and nearly eight years 
her junior; she was very much concerned with keeping everything 
nice, and unmercifully bullied by my two cousins, who took after 
their father and followed the imaginations of their own hearts.  
They were tall, dark, warmly flushed girls handsome rather than 
pretty.  Gertrude, the eldest and tallest, had eyes that were almost 
black; Sibyl was of a stouter build, and her eyes, of which she was 
shamelessly proud, were dark blue.  Sibyl's hair waved, and 
Gertrude's was severely straight.  They treated me on my first visit 
with all the contempt of the adolescent girl for a boy a little 
younger and infinitely less expert in the business of life than 
herself.  They were very busy with the writings of notes and certain 
mysterious goings and comings of their own, and left me very much to 
my own devices.  Their speech in my presence was full of 
unfathomable allusions.  They were the sort of girls who will talk 
over and through an uninitiated stranger with the pleasantest sense 
of superiority.
<P>
I met them at breakfast and at lunch and at the half-past six 
o'clock high tea that formed the third chief meal of the day.  I 
heard them rattling off the compositions of Chaminade and Moskowski, 
with great decision and effect, and hovered on the edge of tennis 
foursomes where it was manifest to the dullest intelligence that my 
presence was unnecessary.  Then I went off to find some readable 
book in the place, but apart from miscellaneous popular novels, some 
veterinary works, a number of comic books, old bound volumes of THE 
ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS and a large, popular illustrated History of 
England, there was very little to be found.  My anut talked to me in 
a casual feeble way, chiefly about my motber's last illness.  The 
two bad seen very little of each other for many years; she made no 
secret of it that the ineligible qualities of my father were the 
cause of the estrangement.  The only other society in the house 
during the day was an old and rather decayed Skye terrier in 
constant conflict with what were no doubt imaginary fleas.  I took 
myself off for a series of walks, and acquired a considerable 
knowledge of the scenery and topography of the Potteries.
<P>
It puzzled my aunt that I did not go westward, where it was country-
side and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses 
and flowers.  But always I went eastward, where in a long valley 
industrialism smokes and sprawls.  That was the stuff to which I 
turned by nature, to the human effort, and the accumulation and jar 
of men's activities.  And in such a country as that valley social 
and economic relations were simple and manifest.  Instead of the 
limitless confusion of London's population, in which no man can 
trace any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in 
which everyone seems disconnected and adrift from everyone, you can 
see here the works, the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and 
here close at hand the congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a 
little distance a small middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the 
big house of the employer.  It was like a very simplified diagram--
after the untraceable confusion of London.
<P>
I prowled alone, curious and interested, through shabby back streets 
of mean little homes; I followed canals, sometimes canals of 
mysteriously heated waters with ghostly wisps of steam rising 
against blackened walls or a distant prospect of dustbin-fed 
vegetable gardens, I saw the women pouring out from the potbanks, 
heard the hooters summoning the toilers to work, lost my way upon 
slag heaps as big as the hills of the south country, dodged trains 
at manifestly dangerous level crossings, and surveyed across dark 
intervening spaces, the flaming uproar, the gnome-like activities of 
iron foundries.  I heard talk of strikes and rumours of strikes, and 
learnt from the columns of some obscure labour paper I bought one 
day, of the horrors of the lead poisoning that was in those days one 
of the normal risks of certain sorts of pottery workers.  Then back 
I came, by the ugly groaning and clanging steam tram of that period, 
to my uncle's house and lavish abundance of money and more or less 
furtive flirtations and the tinkle of Moskowski and Chaminade.  It 
was, I say, diagrammatic.  One saw the expropriator and the 
expropriated--as if Marx had arranged the picture.  It was as 
jumbled and far more dingy and disastrous than any of the confusions 
of building and development that had surrounded my youth at 
Bromstead and Penge, but it had a novel quality of being explicable.  
I found great virtue in the word "exploitation."
<P>
There stuck in my mind as if it was symbolical of the whole thing 
the twisted figure of a man, whose face had been horribly scalded--I 
can't describe how, except that one eye was just expressionless 
white--and he ground at an organ bearing a card which told in weak 
and bitterly satirical phrasing that he had been scalded by the hot 
water from the tuyeres of the blast furnace of Lord Pandram's works.  
He had been scalded and quite inadequately compensated and 
dismissed.  And Lord Pandram was worth half a million.
<P>
That upturned sightless white eye of his took possession of my 
imagination.  I don't think that even then I was swayed by any crude 
melodramatic conception of injustice.  I was quite prepared to 
believe the card wasn't a punctiliously accurate statement of fact, 
and that a case could be made out for Lord Pandram.  Still there in 
the muddy gutter, painfully and dreadfully, was the man, and he was 
smashed and scalded and wretched, and he ground his dismal 
hurdygurdy with a weary arm, calling upon Heaven and the passer-by 
for help, for help and some sort of righting--one could not imagine 
quite what.  There he was as a fact, as a by-product of the system 
that heaped my cousins with trinkets and provided the comic novels 
and the abundant cigars and spacious billiard-room of my uncle's 
house.  I couldn't disconnect him and them.
<P>
My uncle on his part did nothing to conceal the state of war that 
existed between himself and his workers, and the mingled contempt 
and animosity he felt from them.
<P>
<P>

<P>
Prosperity had overtaken my uncle.  So quite naturally he believed 
that every man who was not as prosperous as he was had only himself 
to blame.  He was rich and he had left school and gone into his 
father's business at fifteen, and that seemed to him the proper age 
at which everyone's education should terminate.  He was very anxious 
to dissuade me from going up to Cambridge, and we argued 
intermittently through all my visit.
<P>
I had remembered him as a big and buoyant man, striding 
destructively about the nursery floor of my childhood, and saluting 
my existence by slaps, loud laughter, and questions about half 
herrings and half eggs subtly framed to puzzle and confuse my mind.  
I didn't see him for some years until my father's death, and then he 
seemed rather smaller, though still a fair size, yellow instead of 
red and much less radiantly aggressive.  This altered effect was due 
not so much to my own changed perspectives, I fancy, as to the facts 
that he was suffering for continuous cigar smoking, and being taken 
in hand by his adolescent daughters who had just returned from 
school.
<P>
During my first visit there was a perpetual series of--the only word 
is rows, between them and him.  Up to the age of fifteen or 
thereabouts, he had maintamed his ascendancy over them by simple 
old-fashioned physical chastisement.  Then after an interlude of a 
year it had dawned upon them that power had mysteriously departed 
from him.  He had tried stopping their pocket money, but they found 
their mother financially amenable; besides which it was fundamental 
to my uncle's attitude that he should give them money freely.  Not 
to do so would seem like admitting a difficulty in making it.  So 
that after he had stopped their allowances for the fourth time Sybil 
and Gertrude were prepared to face beggary without a qualm.  It had 
been his pride to give them the largest allowance of any girls at 
the school, not even excepting the granddaughter of Fladden the 
Borax King, and his soul recoiled from this discipline as it had 
never recoiled from the ruder method of the earlier phase.  Both 
girls had developed to a high pitch in their mutual recriminations a 
gift for damaging retort, and he found it an altogether deadlier 
thing than the power of the raised voice that had always cowed my 
aunt.  Whenever he became heated with them, they frowned as if 
involuntarily, drew in their breath sharply, said: "Daddy, you 
really must not say --" and corrected his pronunciation.  Then, at a 
great advantage, they resumed the discussion. . . .
<P>
My uncle's views about Cambridge, however, were perfectly clear and 
definite.  It was waste of time and money.  It was all damned 
foolery.  Did they make a man a better business man?  Not a bit of 
it.  He gave instances.  It spoilt a man for business by giving him 
"false ideas."  Some men said that at college a man formed useful 
friendships.  What use were friendships to a business man?  He might 
get to know lords, but, as my uncle pointed out, a lord's 
requirements in his line of faience were little greater than a 
common  man's.  If college introduced him to hotel proprietors there 
might be something in it.  Perhaps it helped a man into Parliament, 
Parliament still being a confused retrogressive corner in the world 
where lawyers and suchlike sheltered themselves from the onslaughts 
of common-sense behind a fog of Latin and Greek and twaddle and 
tosh; but I wasn't the sort to go into Parliament, unless I meant to 
be a lawyer.  Did I mean to be a lawyer?  It cost no end of money, 
and was full of uncertainties, and there were no judges nor great 
solicitors among my relations.  "Young chaps think they get on by 
themselves," said my uncle.  It isn't so.  Not unless they take 
their coats off.  I took mine off before I was your age by nigh a 
year."
<P>
We were at cross purposes from the outset, because I did not think 
men lived to make money; and I was obtuse to the hints he was 
throwing out at the possibilities of his own potbank, not willfully 
obtuse, but just failing to penetrate his meaning.  Whatever City 
Merchants had or had not done for me, Flack, Topham and old Gates 
had certainly barred my mistaking the profitable production and sale 
of lavatory basins and bathroom fittings for the highest good.  It 
was only upon reflection that it dawned upon me that the splendid 
chance for a young fellow with my uncle, "me, having no son of my 
own," was anything but an illustration for comparison with my own 
chosen career.
<P>
I still remember very distinctly my uncle's talk,--he loved to speak 
"reet Staffordshire"--his rather flabby face with the mottled 
complexion that told of crude ill-regulated appetites, his clumsy 
gestures--he kept emphasising his points by prodding at me with his 
finger--the ill-worn, costly, grey tweed clothes, the watch chain of 
plain solid gold, and soft felt hat thrust back from his head.  He 
tackled me first in the garden after lunch, and then tried to raise 
me to enthusiasm by taking me to his potbank and showing me its 
organisation, from the dusty grinding mills in which whitened men 
worked and coughed, through the highly ventilated glazing room in 
which strangely masked girls looked ashamed of themselves,--"They'll 
risk death, the fools, to show their faces to a man," said my uncle, 
quite audibly--to the firing kilns and the glazing kilns, and so 
round the whole place to the railway siding and the gratifying 
spectacle of three trucks laden with executed orders.
<P>
Then we went up a creaking outside staircase to his little office, 
and he showed off before me for a while, with one or two 
subordinates and the telephone.
<P>
"None of your Gas," he said, "all this.  It's Real every bit of it.  
Hard cash and hard glaze."
<P>
"Yes," I said, with memories of a carelessly read pamphlet in my 
mind, and without any satirical intention, "I suppose you MUST use 
lead in your glazes?"
<P>
Whereupon I found I had tapped the ruling grievance of my uncle's 
life.  He hated leadless glazes more than he hated anything, except 
the benevolent people who had organised the agitation for their use.  
"Leadless glazes ain't only fit for buns," he said.  "Let me tell 
you, my boy--"
<P>
He began in a voice of bland persuasiveness that presently warmed to 
anger, to explain the whole matter.  I hadn't the rights of the 
matter at all.  Firstly, there was practically no such thing as lead 
poisoning.  Secondly, not everyone was liable to lead poisoning, and 
it would be quite easy to pick out the susceptible types--as soon as 
they had it--and put them to other work.  Thirdly, the evil effects 
of lead poisoning were much exaggerated.  Fourthly, and this was in 
a particularly confidential undertone, many of the people liked to 
get lead poisoning, especially the women, because it caused 
abortion.  I might not believe it, but he knew it for a fact.  
Fifthly, the work-people simply would not learn the gravity of the 
danger, and would eat with unwashed hands, and incur all sorts of 
risks, so that as my uncle put it: "the fools deserve what they 
get."  Sixthly, he and several associated firms had organised a 
simple and generous insurance scheme against lead-poisoning risks.  
Seventhly, he never wearied in rational (as distinguished from 
excessive, futile and expensive) precautions against the disease.  
Eighthly, in the ill-equipped shops of his minor competitors lead 
poisoning was a frequent and virulent evil, and people had 
generalised from these exceptional cases.  The small shops, he 
hazarded, looking out of the cracked and dirty window at distant 
chimneys, might be advantageously closed. . . .
<P>
"But what's the good of talking?" said my uncle, getting off the 
table on which he had been sitting.  "Seems to me there'll come a 
time when a master will get fined if he don't run round the works 
blowing his girls noses for them.  That's about what it'll come to."
<P>
He walked to the black mantelpiece and stood on the threadbare rug, 
and urged me not to be misled by the stories of prejudiced and 
interested enemies of our national industries.
<P>
"They'll get a strike one of these days, of employers, and then 
we'll see a bit," he said.  "They'll drive Capital abroad and then 
they'll whistle to get it back again." . . .
<P>
He led the way down the shaky wooden steps and cheered up to tell me 
of his way of checking his coal consumption.  He exchanged a 
ferocious greeting with one or two workpeople, and so we came out of 
the factory gates into the ugly narrow streets, paved with a 
peculiarly hard diapered brick of an unpleasing inky-blue colour, 
and bordered with the mean and squalid homes of his workers.  Doors 
stood open and showed grimy interiors, and dirty ill-clad children 
played in the kennel.
<P>
We passed a sickly-looking girl with a sallow face, who dragged her 
limbs and peered at us dimly with painful eyes.  She stood back, as 
partly blinded people will do, to allow us to pass, although there 
was plenty of room for us.
<P>
I glanced back at her.
<P>
"THAT'S ploombism " said my uncle casually.
<P>
"What?" said I.
<P>
"Ploombism.  And the other day I saw a fool of a girl, and what 
d'you think?  She'd got a basin that hadn't been fired, a cracked 
piece of biscuit it was, up on the shelf over her head, just all 
over glaze, killing glaze, man, and she was putting up her hand if 
you please, and eating her dinner out of it.  Got her dinner in it!
<P>
"Eating her dinner out of it," he repeated in loud and bitter tones, 
and punched me hard in the ribs.
<P>
"And then they comes to THAT--and grumbles.  And the fools up in 
Westminster want you to put in fans here and fans there--the Longton 
fools have. . . .  And then eating their dinners out of it all the 
time!" . . .
<P>
At high tea that night--my uncle was still holding out against 
evening dinner--Sibyl and Gertrude made what was evidently a 
concerted demand for a motorcar.
<P>
"You've got your mother's brougham," he said, that's good enough for 
you."  But he seemed shaken by the fact that some Burslem rival was 
launching out with the new invention.  "He spoils his girls," he 
remarked.  "He's a fool," and became thoughtful.
<P>
Afterwards he asked me to come to him into his study; it was a room 
with a writing-desk and full of pieces of earthenware and suchlike 
litter, and we had our great row about Cambridge.
<P>
"Have you thought things over, Dick?" he said.
<P>
"I think I'll go to Trinity, Uncle," I said firmly.  "I want to go 
to Trinity.  It is a great college."
<P>
He was manifestly chagrined.  "You're a fool," he said.
<P>
I made no answer.
<P>
"You're a damned fool," he said.  "But I suppose you've got to do 
it.  You could have come here--That don't matter, though, now. . .  
You'll have your time and spend your money, and be a poor half-
starved clergyman, mucking about with the women all the day and 
afraid to have one of your own ever, or you'll be a schoolmaster or 
some such fool for the rest of your life.  Or some newspaper chap.   
That's what you'll get from Cambridge.  I'm half a mind not to let 
you.  Eh?  More than half a mind. . . ."
<P>
"You've got to do the thing you can," he said, after a pause, "and 
likely it's what you're fitted for."
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
I paid several short visits to Staffordshire during my Cambridge 
days, and always these relations of mine produced the same effect of 
hardness.   My uncle's thoughts had neither atmosphere nor mystery.   
He lived in a different universe from the dreams of scientific 
construction that filled my mind.  He could as easily have 
understood Chinese poetry.  His motives were made up of intense 
rivalries with other men of his class and kind, a few vindictive 
hates springing from real and fancied slights, a habit of 
acquisition that had become a second nature, a keen love both of 
efficiency and display in his own affairs.  He seemed to me to have 
no sense of the state, no sense and much less any love of beauty, no 
charity and no sort of religious feeling whatever.  He had strong 
bodily appetites, he ate and drank freely, smoked a great deal, and 
occasionally was carried off by his passions for a "bit of a spree" 
to Birmingham or Liverpool or Manchester.  The indulgences of these 
occasions were usually followed by a period of reaction, when he was 
urgent for the suppression of nudity in the local Art Gallery and a 
harsh and forcible elevation of the superficial morals of the 
valley.  And he spoke of the ladies who ministered to the delights 
of his jolly-dog period, when he spoke of them at all, by the 
unprintable feminine equivalent.  My aunt he treated with a kindly 
contempt and considerable financial generosity, but his daughters 
tore his heart; he was so proud of them, so glad to find them money 
to spend, so resolved to own them, so instinctively jealous of every 
man who came near them.
<P>
My uncle has been the clue to a great number of men for me.  He was 
an illuminating extreme.  I have learnt what not to expect from them 
through him, and to comprehend resentments and dangerous sudden 
antagonisms I should have found incomprehensible in their more 
complex forms, if I had not first seen them in him in their feral 
state.
<P>
With his soft felt hat at the back of his head, his rather heavy, 
rather mottled face, his rationally thick boots and slouching tweed-
clad form, a little round-shouldered and very obstinate looking, he 
strolls through all my speculations sucking his teeth audibly, and 
occasionally throwing out a shrewd aphorism, the intractable 
unavoidable ore of the new civilisation.
<P>
Essentially he was simple.  Generally speaking, he hated and 
despised in equal measure whatever seemed to suggest that he 
personally was not the most perfect human being conceivable.  He 
hated all education after fifteen because he had had no education 
after fifteen, he hated all people who did not have high tea until 
he himself under duress gave up high tea, he hated every game except 
football, which he had played and could judge, he hated all people 
who spoke foreign languages because he knew no language but 
Staffordshire, he hated all foreigners because he was English, and 
all foreign ways because they were not his ways.  Also he hated 
particularly, and in this order, Londoner's, Yorkshiremen, Scotch, 
Welch and Irish, because they were not "reet Staffordshire," and he 
hated all other Staffordshire men as insufficiently "reet."  He 
wanted to have all his own women inviolate, and to fancy he had a 
call upon every other woman in the world.  He wanted to have the 
best cigars and the best brandy in the world to consume or give away 
magnificently, and every one else to have inferior ones.  (His 
billiard table was an extra large size, specially made and very 
inconvenient.)  And he hated Trade Unions because they interfered 
with his autocratic direction of his works, and his workpeople 
because they were not obedient and untiring mechanisms to do his 
bidding.  He was, in fact, a very naive, vigorous human being.  He 
was about as much civilised, about as much tamed to the ideas of 
collective action and mutual consideration as a Central African 
negro.
<P>
There are hordes of such men as he throughout all the modern 
industrial world.  You will find the same type with the slightest 
modifications in the Pas de Calais or Rhenish Prussia or New Jersey 
or North Italy.  No doubt you would find it in New Japan.  These men 
have raised themselves up from the general mass of untrained, 
uncultured, poorish people in a hard industrious selfish struggle.  
To drive others they have had first to drive themselves.  They have 
never yet had occasion nor leisure to think of the state or social 
life as a whole, and as for dreams or beauty, it was a condition of 
survival that they should ignore such cravings.  All the distinctive 
qualities of my uncle can be thought of as dictated by his 
conditions; his success and harshness, the extravagances that 
expressed his pride in making money, the uncongenial luxury that 
sprang from rivalry, and his self-reliance, his contempt for broad 
views, his contempt for everything that he could not understand.
<P>
His daughters were the inevitable children of his life.  Queer girls 
they were!  Curiously "spirited" as people phrase it, and curiously 
limited.  During my Cambridge days I went down to Staffordshire 
several times.  My uncle, though he still resented my refusal to go 
into his business, was also in his odd way proud of me.  I was his 
nephew and poor relation, and yet there I was, a young gentleman 
learning all sorts of unremunerative things in the grandest manner, 
"Latin and mook," while the sons of his neighhours, not nephews 
merely, but sons, stayed unpolished in their native town.  Every 
time I went down I found extensive changes and altered relations, 
and before I had settled down to them off I went again.  I don't 
think I was one person to them; I was a series of visitors.  There 
is a gulf of ages between a gaunt schoolboy of sixteen in unbecoming 
mourning and two vividly self-conscious girls of eighteen and 
nineteen, but a Cambridge "man" of two and twenty with a first and 
good tennis and a growing social experience, is a fair contemporary 
for two girls of twenty-three and twenty-four.
<P>
A motor-car appeared, I think in my second visit, a bottle-green 
affair that opened behind, had dark purple cushions, and was 
controlled mysteriously by a man in shiny black costume and a flat 
cap.  The high tea had been shifted to seven and rechristened 
dinner, but my uncle would not dress nor consent to have wine; and 
after one painful experiment, I gathered, and a scene, he put his 
foot down and prohibited any but high-necked dresses.
<P>
"Daddy's perfectly impossible," Sybil told me.
<P>
The foot had descended vehemently!  "My own daughters!" he had said, 
"dressed up like --"--and had arrested himself and fumbled and 
decided to say--"actresses, and showin' their fat arms for every 
fool to stare at!"  Nor would he have any people invited to dinner.  
He didn't, he had explained, want strangers poking about in his 
house when he came home tired.  So such calling as occurred went on 
during his absence in the afternoon.
<P>
One of the peculiarities of the life of these ascendant families of 
the industrial class to which wealth has come, is its tremendous 
insulations.  There were no customs of intercourse in the Five 
Towns.   All the isolated prosperities of the district sprang from 
economising, hard driven homes, in which there was neither time nor 
means for hospitality.  Social intercourse centred very largely upon 
the church or chapel, and the chapels were better at bringing people 
together than the Establishment to which my cousins belonged.  Their 
chief outlet to the wider world lay therefore through the 
acquaintances they had formed at school, and through two much less 
prosperous families of relations who lived at Longton and Hanley.  A 
number of gossiping friendships with old school mates were "kept 
up," and my cousins would "spend the afternoon" or even spend the 
day with these; such occasions led to other encounters and 
interlaced with the furtive correspondences and snatched meetings 
that formed the emotional thread of their lives.  When the billiard 
table had been new, my uncle had taken to asking in a few approved 
friends for an occasional game, but mostly the billiard-room was for 
glory and the girls.  Both of them played very well.  They never, so 
far as I know, dined out, and when at last after bitter domestic 
conflicts they began to go to dances, they went with the quavering 
connivance of my aunt, and changed into ball frocks at friends' 
houses on the way.  There was a tennis club that formed a convenient 
afternoon rendezvous, and I recall that in the period of my earlier 
visits the young bloods of the district found much satisfaction in 
taking girls for drives in dog-carts and suchlike high-wheeled 
vehicles, a disposition that died in tangled tandems at the 
apparition of motor-car's.
<P>
My aunt and uncle had conceived no plans in life for their daughters 
at all.  In the undifferentiated industrial community from which 
they had sprung, girls got married somehow, and it did not occur to 
them that the concentration of property that had made them wealthy, 
had cut their children off from the general social sea in which 
their own awkward meeting had occurred, without necessarily opening 
any other world in exchange.  My uncle was too much occupied with 
the works and his business affairs and his private vices to 
philosophise about his girls; he wanted them just to keep girls, 
preferably about sixteen, and to be a sort of animated flowers and 
make home bright and be given things.  He was irritated that they 
would not remain at this, and still more irritated that they failed 
to suppress altogether their natural interest in young men.  The 
tandems would be steered by weird and devious routes to evade the 
bare chance of his bloodshot eye.  My aunt seemed to have no ideas 
whatever about what was likely to happen to her children.  She had 
indeed no ideas about anything; she took her husband and the days as 
they came.
<P>
I can see now the pathetic difficulty of my cousins' position in 
life; the absence of any guidance or instruction or provision for 
their development.  They supplemented the silences of home by the 
conversation of schoolfellows and the suggestions of popular 
fiction.  They had to make what they could out of life with such 
hints as these.  The church was far too modest to offer them any 
advice.  It was obtruded upon my mind upon my first visit that they 
were both carrying on correspondences and having little furtive 
passings and seeings and meetings with the mysterious owners of 
certain initials, S. and L. K., and, if I remember rightly, "the R. 
N." brothers and cousins, I suppose, of their friends.  The same 
thing was going on, with a certain intensification, at my next 
visit, excepting only that the initials were different.  But when I 
came again their methods were maturer or I was no longer a 
negligible quantity, and the notes and the initials were no longer 
flaunted quite so openly in my face.
<P>
My cousins had worked it out from the indications of their universe 
that the end of life is to have a "good time."  They used the 
phrase.  That and the drives in dog-carts were only the first of 
endless points of resemblance between them and the commoner sort of 
American girl.  When some years ago I paid my first and only visit 
to America I seemed to recover my cousins' atmosphere as soon as I 
entered the train at Euston.  There were three girls in my 
compartment supplied with huge decorated cases of sweets, and being 
seen off by a company of friends, noisily arch and eager about the 
"steamer letters" they would get at Liverpool; they were the very 
soul-sisters of my cousins.  The chief elements of a good time, as 
my cousins judged it, as these countless thousands of rich young 
women judge it, are a petty eventfulness, laughter, and to feel that 
you are looking well and attracting attention.  Shopping is one of 
its leading joys.  You buy things, clothes and trinkets for yourself 
and presents for your friends.  Presents always seemed to be flying 
about in that circle; flowers and boxes of sweets were common 
currency.  My cousins were always getting and giving, my uncle 
caressed them with parcels and cheques.  They kissed him and he 
exuded sovereigns as a stroked APHIS exudes honey.  It was like the 
new language of the Academy of Lagado to me, and I never learnt how 
to express myself in it, for nature and training make me feel 
encumbered to receive presents and embarrassed in giving them.  But 
then, like my father, I hate and distrust possessions.
<P>
Of the quality of their private imagination I never learnt anything; 
I suppose it followed the lines of the fiction they read and was 
romantic and sentimental.  So far as marriage went, the married 
state seemed at once very attractive and dreadfully serious to them, 
composed in equal measure of becoming important and becoming old.  I 
don't know what they thought about children.  I doubt if they 
thought about them at all.  It was very secret if they did.
<P>
As for the poor and dingy people all about them, my cousins were 
always ready to take part in a Charitable Bazaar.  They were unaware 
of any economic correlation of their own prosperity and that 
circumambient poverty, and they knew of Trade Unions simply as 
disagreeable external things that upset my uncle's temper.  They 
knew of nothing wrong in social life at all except that there were 
"Agitators."  It surprised them a little, I think, that Agitators 
were not more drastically put down.  But they had a sort of 
instinctive dread of social discussion as of something that might 
breach the happiness of their ignorance. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
My cousins did more than illustrate Marx for me; they also undertook 
a stage of my emotional education.  Their method in that as in 
everything else was extremely simple, but it took my inexperience by 
surprise.
<P>
It must have been on my third visit that Sybil took me in hand.  
Hitherto I seemed to have seen her only in profile, but now she 
became almost completely full face, manifestly regarded me with 
those violet eyes of hers.  She passed me things I needed at 
breakfast--it was the first morning of my visit--before I asked for 
them.
<P>
When young men are looked at by pretty cousins, they become 
intensely aware of those cousins.   It seemed to me that I had 
always admired Sybil's eyes very greatly, and that there was 
something in her temperament congenial to mine.  It was odd I had 
not noted it on my previous visits.
<P>
We walked round the garden somewhen that morning, and talked about 
Cambridge.  She asked quite a lot of questions about my work and my 
ambitions.  She said she had always felt sure I was clever.
<P>
The conversation languished a little, and we picked some flowers for 
the house.  Then she asked if I could run.  I conceded her various 
starts and we raced up and down the middle garden path.   Then, a 
little breathless, we went into the new twenty-five guinea summer-
house at the end of the herbaceous border.
<P>
We sat side by side, pleasantly hidden from the house, and she 
became anxious about her hair, which was slightly and prettily 
disarranged, and asked me to help her with the adjustment of a 
hairpin.  I had never in my life been so near the soft curly hair 
and the dainty eyebrow and eyelid and warm soft cheek of a girl, and 
I was stirred--
<P>
It stirs me now to recall it.
<P>
I became a battleground of impulses and inhibitions.
<P>
"Thank you," said my cousin, and moved a little away from me.
<P>
She began to talk about friendship, and lost her thread and forgot 
the little electric stress between us in a rather meandering 
analysis of her principal girl friends.
<P>
But afterwards she resumed her purpose.
<P>
I went to bed that night with one propostion overshadowing 
everything else in my mind, namely, that kissing my cousin Sybil was 
a difficult, but not impossible, achievement.  I do not recall any 
shadow of a doubt whether on the whole it was worth doing.  The 
thing had come into my existence, disturbing and interrupting its 
flow exactly as a fever does.  Sybil had infected me with herself.
<P>
The next day matters came to a crisis in the little upstairs 
sitting-room which had been assigned me as a study during my visit.  
I was working up there, or rather trying to work in spite of the 
outrageous capering of some very primitive elements in my brain, 
when she came up to me, under a transparent pretext of looking for a 
book.
<P>
I turned round and then got up at the sight of her.  I quite forget 
what our conversation was about, but I know she led me to believe I 
might kiss her.  Then when I attempted to do so she averted her 
face.
<P>
"How COULD you?" she said; "I didn't mean that!"
<P>
That remained the state of our relations for two days.  I developed 
a growing irritation with and resentment against cousin Sybil, 
combined with an intense desire to get that kiss for which I 
hungered and thirsted.  Cousin Sybil went about in the happy 
persuasion that I was madly in love with her, and her game, so far 
as she was concerned, was played and won.  It wasn't until I had 
fretted for two days that I realised that I was being used for the 
commonest form of excitement possible to a commonplace girl; that 
dozens perhaps of young men had played the part of Tantalus at 
cousin Sybil's lips.  I walked about my room at nights, damning her 
and calling her by terms which on the whole she rather deserved, 
while Sybil went to sleep pitying "poor old Dick!"
<P>
"Damn it!" I said, "I WILL be equal with you."
<P>
But I never did equalise the disadvantage, and perhaps it's as well, 
for I fancy that sort of revenge cuts both people too much for a 
rational man to seek it. . . .   
<P>
"Why are men so silly?" said cousin Sybil next morning, wriggling 
back with down-bent head to release herself from what should have 
been a compelling embrace.
<P>
"Confound it!" I said with a flash of clear vision.  "You STARTED 
this game."
<P>
"Oh!"
<P>
She stood back against a hedge of roses, a little flushed and 
excited and interested, and ready for the delightful defensive if I 
should renew my attack.
<P>
"Beastly hot for scuffling," I said, white with anger.  "I don't 
know whether I'm so keen on kissing you, Sybil, after all.  I just 
thought you wanted me to."
<P>
I could have whipped her, and my voice stung more than my words.
<P>
Our eyes met; a real hatred in hers leaping up to meet mine.
<P>
"Let's play tennis," I said, after a moment's pause.
<P>
"No," she answered shortly, "I'm going indoors."
<P>
"Very well."
<P>
And that ended the affair with Sybil.
<P>
I was still in the full glare of this disillusionment when Gertrude 
awoke from some preoccupation to an interest in my existence.  She 
developed a disposition to touch my hand by accident, and let her 
fingers rest in contact with it for a moment,--she had pleasant soft 
hands;--she began to drift into summer houses with me, to let her 
arm rest trustfully against mine, to ask questions about Cambridge.  
They were much the same questions that Sybil had asked.  But I 
controlled myself and maintained a profile of intelligent and 
entirely civil indifference to her blandishments.
<P>
What Gertrude made of it came out one evening in some talk--I forget 
about what--with Sybil.
<P>
"Oh, Dick!" said Gertrude a little impatiently, "Dick's Pi."
<P>
And I never disillusioned her by any subsequent levity from this 
theory of my innate and virginal piety.
<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
It was against this harsh and crude Staffordshire background that I 
think I must have seen Margaret for the first time.  I say I think 
because it is quite possible that we had passed each other in the 
streets of Cambridge, no doubt with that affectation of mutual 
disregard which was once customary between undergraduates and 
Newnham girls.  But if that was so I had noted nothing of the 
slender graciousness that shone out so pleasingly against the 
bleaker midland surroundings.
<P>
She was a younger schoolfellow of my cousins', and the step-daughter 
of Seddon, a prominent solicitor of Burslem.  She was not only not 
in my cousins' generation but not in their set, she was one of a 
small hardworking group who kept immaculate note-books, and did as 
much as is humanly possible of that insensate pile of written work 
that the Girls' Public School movement has inflicted upon school-
girls.  She really learnt French and German admirably and 
thoroughly, she got as far in mathematics as an unflinching industry 
can carry any one with no great natural aptitude, and she went up to 
Bennett Hall, Newnham, after the usual conflict with her family, to 
work for the History Tripos.
<P>
There in her third year she made herself thoroughly ill through 
overwork, so ill that she had to give up Newnham altogether and go 
abroad with her stepmother.  She made herself ill, as so many girls 
do in those university colleges, through the badness of her home and 
school training.  She thought study must needs be a hard straining 
of the mind.  She worried her work, she gave herself no leisure to 
see it as a whole, she felt herself not making headway and she cut 
her games and exercise in order to increase her hours of toil, and 
worked into the night.  She carried a knack of laborious 
thoroughness into the blind alleys and inessentials of her subject.  
It didn't need the badness of the food for which Bennett Hall is 
celebrated and the remarkable dietary of nocturnal cocoa, cakes and 
soft biscuits with which the girls have supplemented it, to ensure 
her collapse.  Her mother brought her home, fretting and distressed, 
and then finding her hopelessly unhappy at home, took her and her 
half-brother, a rather ailing youngster of ten who died three years 
later, for a journey to Italy.
<P>
Italy did much to assuage Margaret's chagrin.  I think all three of 
them had a very good time there.  At home Mr. Seddon, her step-
father, played the part of a well-meaning blight by reason of the 
moods that arose from nervous dyspepsia.  They went to Florence, 
equipped with various introductions and much sound advice from 
sympathetic Cambridge friends, and having acquired an ease in Italy 
there, went on to Siena, Orvieto, and at last Rome.  They returned, 
if I remember rightly, by Pisa, Genoa, Milan and Paris.  Six months 
or more they had had abroad, and now Margaret was back in Burslem, 
in health again and consciously a very civilised person.
<P>
New ideas were abroad, it was Maytime and a spring of abundant 
flowers--daffodils were particularly good that year--and Mrs. Seddon 
celebrated her return by giving an afternoon reception at short 
notice, with the clear intention of letting every one out into the 
garden if the weather held.
<P>
The Seddons had a big old farmhouse modified to modern ideas of 
comfort on the road out towards Misterton, with an orchard that had 
been rather pleasantly subdued from use to ornament.  It had rich 
blossoming cherry and apple trees.  Large patches of grass full of 
nodding yellow trumpets had been left amidst the not too precisely 
mown grass, which was as it were grass path with an occasional lapse 
into lawn or glade.  And Margaret, hatless, with the fair hair above 
her thin, delicately pink face very simply done, came to meet our 
rather too consciously dressed party,--we had come in the motor four 
strong, with my aunt in grey silk.  Margaret wore a soft flowing 
flowered blue dress of diaphanous material, all unconnected with the 
fashion and tied with pretty ribbons, like a slenderer, unbountiful 
Primavera.
<P>
It was one of those May days that ape the light and heat of summer, 
and I remember disconnectedly quite a number of brightly lit figures 
and groups walking about, and a white gate between orchard and 
garden and a large lawn with an oak tree and a red Georgian house 
with a verandah and open French windows, through which the tea 
drinking had come out upon the moss-edged flagstones even as Mrs. 
Seddon had planned.
<P>
The party was almost entirely feminine except for a little curate 
with a large head, a good voice and a radiant manner, who was 
obviously attracted by Margaret, and two or three young husbands 
still sufficiently addicted to their wives to accompany them.  One 
of them I recall as a quite romantic figure with abundant blond 
curly hair on which was poised a grey felt hat encircled by a 
refined black band.  He wore, moreover, a loose rich shot silk tie 
of red and purple, a long frock coat, grey trousers and brown shoes, 
and presently he removed his hat and carried it in one hand.  There 
were two tennis-playing youths besides myself.  There was also one 
father with three daughters in anxious control, a father of the old 
school scarcely half broken in, reluctant, rebellious and 
consciously and conscientiously "reet Staffordshire."  The daughters 
were all alert to suppress the possible plungings, the undesirable 
humorous impulses of this almost feral guest.  They nipped his very 
gestures in the bud.  The rest of the people were mainly mothers 
with daughters--daughters of all ages, and a scattering of aunts, 
and there was a tendency to clotting, parties kept together and 
regarded parties suspiciously.  Mr. Seddon was in hiding, I think, 
all the time, though not formally absent.
<P>
Matters centred upon the tea in the long room of the French windows, 
where four trim maids went to and fro busily between the house and 
the clumps of people seated or standing before it; and tennis and 
croquet were intermittently visible and audible beyond a bank of 
rockwork rich with the spikes and cups and bells of high spring.
<P>
Mrs.  Seddon presided at the tea urn, and Margaret partly assisted 
and partly talked to me and my cousin Sibyl--Gertrude had found a 
disused and faded initial and was partnering him at tennis in a 
state of gentle revival--while their mother exercised a divided 
chaperonage from a seat near Mrs. Seddon.  The little curate, 
stirring a partially empty cup of tea, mingled with our party, and 
preluded, I remember, every observation he made by a vigorous 
resumption of stirring.
<P>
We talked of Cambridge, and Margaret kept us to it.  The curate was 
a Selwyn man and had taken a pass degree in theology, but Margaret 
had come to Gaylord's lecturers in Trinity for a term before her 
breakdown, and understood these differences.  She had the eagerness 
of an exile to hear the old familiar names of places and 
personalities.  We capped familiar anecdotes and were enthusiastic 
about Kings' Chapel and the Backs, and the curate, addressing 
himself more particularly to Sibyl, told a long confused story 
illustrative of his disposition to reckless devilry (of a pure-
minded kindly sort) about upsetting two canoes quite needlessly on 
the way to Grantchester.
<P>
I can still see Margaret as I saw her that afternoon, see her fresh 
fair face, with the little obliquity of the upper lip, and her brow 
always slightly knitted, and her manner as of one breathlessly shy 
but determined.  She had rather open blue eyes, and she spoke in an 
even musical voice with the gentlest of stresses and the ghost of a 
lisp.  And it was true, she gathered, that Cambridge still existed.  
"I went to Grantchester," she said, "last year, and had tea under 
the apple-blossom.  I didn't think then I should have to come down."  
(It was that started the curate upon his anecdote.)
<P>
"I've seen a lot of pictures, and learnt a lot about them--at the 
Pitti and the Brera,--the Brera is wonderful--wonderful places,--but 
it isn't like real study," she was saying presently. . . .  "We 
bought bales of photographs," she said.
<P>
I thought the bales a little out of keeping.
<P>
But fair-haired and quite simply and yet graciously and fancifully 
dressed, talking of art and beautiful things and a beautiful land, 
and with so much manifest regret for learning denied, she seemed a 
different kind of being altogether from my smart, hard, high-
coloured, black-haired and resolutely hatted cousin; she seemed 
translucent beside Gertrude.  Even the little twist and droop of her 
slender body was a grace to me.
<P>
I liked her from the moment I saw her, and set myself to interest 
and please her as well as I knew how.
<P>
We recalled a case of ragging that had rustled the shrubs of 
Newnham, and then Chris Robinson's visit--he had given a talk to 
Bennett Hall also--and our impression of him.
<P>
"He disappointed me, too," said Margaret.
<P>
I was moved to tell Margaret something of my own views in the matter 
of social progress, and she listened--oh! with a kind of urged 
attention, and her brow a little more knitted, very earnestly.  The 
little curate desisted from the appendices and refuse heaps and 
general debris of his story, and made himself look very alert and 
intelligent.
<P>
"We did a lot of that when I was up in the eighties," he said.  "I'm 
glad Imperialism hasn't swamped you fellows altogether."
<P>
Gertrude, looking bright and confident, came to join our talk from 
the shrubbery; the initial, a little flushed and evidently in a 
state of refreshed relationship, came with her, and a cheerful lady 
in pink and more particularly distinguished by a pink bonnet joined 
our little group.  Gertrude had been sipping admiration and was not 
disposed to play a passive part in the talk.
<P>
"Socialism!" she cried, catching the word.  "It's well Pa isn't 
here.  He has Fits when people talk of socialism.  Fits!"
<P>
The initial laughed in a general kind of way.
<P>
The curate said there was socialism AND socialism, and looked at 
Margaret to gauge whether he had been too bold in this utterance.  
But she was all, he perceived, for broad-mindness, and he stirred 
himself (and incidentally his tea) to still more liberality of 
expression.  He said the state of the poor was appalling, simply 
appalling; that there were times when he wanted to shatter the whole 
system, "only," he said, turning to me appealingly, "What have we 
got to put in its place?"
<P>
"The thing that exists is always the more evident alternative," I 
said.
<P>
The little curate looked at it for a moment.  "Precisely," he said 
explosively, and turned stirring and with his head a little on one 
side, to hear what Margaret was saying.
<P>
Margaret was saying, with a swift blush and an effect of daring, 
that she had no doubt she was a socialist.
<P>
"And wearing a gold chain!" said Gertrude, "And drinking out of 
eggshell!  I like that!"
<P>
I came to Margaret's rescue.  "It doesn't follow that because one's 
a socialist one ought to dress in sackcloth and ashes."
<P>
The initial coloured deeply, and having secured my attention by 
prodding me slightly with the wrist of the hand that held his 
teacup, cleared his throat and suggested that "one ought to be 
consistent."
<P>
I perceived we were embarked upon a discussion of the elements.  We 
began an interesting little wrangle one of those crude discussions 
of general ideas that are dear to the heart of youth.  I and 
Margaret supported one another as socialists, Gertrude and Sybil and 
the initial maintained an anti-socialist position, the curate 
attempted a cross-bench position with an air of intending to come 
down upon us presently with a casting vote.  He reminded us of a 
number of useful principles too often overlooked in argument, that 
in a big question like this there was much to be said on both sides, 
that if every one did his or her duty to every one about them there 
would be no difficulty with social problems at all, that over and 
above all enactments we needed moral changes in people themselves.  
My cousin Gertrude was a difficult controversialist to manage, being 
unconscious of inconsistency in statement and absolutely impervious 
to reply.  Her standpoint was essentially materialistic; she didn't 
see why she shouldn't have a good time because other people didn't; 
they would have a good time, she was sure, if she didn't.  She said 
that if we did give up everything we had to other people, they 
wouldn't very likely know what to do with it.  She asked if we were 
so fond of work-people, why we didn't go and live among them, and 
expressed the inflexible persuasion that if we HAD socialism, 
everything would be just the same again in ten years' time.  She 
also threw upon us the imputation of ingratitude for a beautiful 
world by saying that so far as she was concerned she didn't want to 
upset everything.  She was contented with things as they were, thank 
you.
<P>
The discussion led in some way that I don't in the least recall now, 
and possibly by abrupt transitions, to a croquet foursome in which 
Margaret involved the curate without involving herself, and then 
stood beside me on the edge of the lawn while the others played.  We 
watched silently for a moment.
<P>
"I HATE that sort of view," she said suddenly in a confidential 
undertone, with her delicate pink flush returning.
<P>
"It's want of imagination," I said.
<P>
"To think we are just to enjoy ourselves," she went on; "just to go 
on dressing and playing and having meals and spending money!"  She 
seemed to be referring not simply to my cousins, but to the whole 
world of industry and property about us.  "But what is one to do?" 
she asked.  "I do wish I had not had to come down.  It's all so 
pointless here.  There seems to be nothing going forward, no ideas, 
no dreams.  No one here seems to feel quite what I feel, the sort of 
need there is for MEANING in things.  I hate things without 
meaning."
<P>
"Don't you do--local work?"
<P>
"I suppose I shall.  I suppose I must find something.  Do you think--
if one were to attempt some sort of propaganda?"
<P>
"Could you--?" I began a little doubtfully.
<P>
"I suppose I couldn't," she answered, after a thoughtful moment.  "I 
suppose it would come to nothing.  And yet I feel there is so much 
to be done for the world, so much one ought to be doing. . . .  I 
want to do something for the world."
<P>
I can see her now as she stood there with her brows nearly frowning, 
her blue eyes looking before her, her mouth almost petulant.  "One 
feels that there are so many things going on--out of one's reach," 
she said.
<P>
I went back in the motor-car with my mind full of her, the quality 
of delicate discontent, the suggestion of exile.  Even a kind of 
weakness in her was sympathetic.  She told tremendously against her 
background.  She was, I say, like a protesting blue flower upon a 
cinder heap.  It is curious, too, how she connects and mingles with 
the furious quarrel I had with my uncle that very evening.  That 
came absurdly.  Indirectly Margaret was responsible.  My mind was 
running on ideas she had revived and questions she had set 
clamouring, and quite inadvertently in my attempt to find solutions 
I talked so as to outrage his profoundest feelings. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
7
<P>
<P>
What a preposterous shindy that was!
<P>
I sat with him in the smoking-room, propounding what I considered to 
be the most indisputable and non-contentious propositions 
conceivable--until, to my infinite amazement, he exploded and called 
me a "damned young puppy."
<P>
It was seismic.
<P>
"Tremendously interesting time," I said, "just in the beginning of 
making a civilisation."
<P>
"Ah!" he said, with an averted face, and nodded, leaning forward 
over his cigar.
<P>
I had not the remotest thought of annoying him.
<P>
"Monstrous muddle of things we have got," I said, "jumbled streets, 
ugly population, ugly factories--"
<P>
"You'd do a sight better if you had to do with it," said my uncle, 
regarding me askance.
<P>
"Not me.  But a world that had a collective plan and knew where it 
meant to be going would do a sight better, anyhow.  We're all 
swimming in a flood of ill-calculated chances--"
<P>
"You'll be making out I organised that business down there--by 
chance--next," said my uncle, his voice thick with challenge.
<P>
I went on as though I was back in Trinity.
<P>
"There's a lot of chance in the making of all great businesses," I 
said.
<P>
My uncle remarked that that showed how much I knew about businesses.   
If chance made businesses, why was it that he always succeeded and 
grew while those fools Ackroyd and Sons always took second place?  
He showed a disposition to tell the glorious history of how once 
Ackroyd's overshadowed him, and how now he could buy up Ackroyd's 
three times over.  But I wanted to get out what was in my mind.
<P>
"Oh!" I said, "as between man and man and business and business, 
some of course get the pull by this quality or that--but it's forces 
quite outside the individual case that make the big part of any 
success under modern conditions.  YOU never invented pottery, nor 
any process in pottery that matters a rap in your works; it wasn't 
YOUR foresight that joined all England up with railways and made it 
possible to organise production on an altogether different scale.  
You really at the utmost can't take credit for much more than being 
the sort of man who happened to fit what happened to be the 
requirements of the time, and who happened to be in a position to 
take advantage of them--"
<P>
It was then my uncle cried out and called me a damned young puppy, 
and became involved in some unexpected trouble of his own.
<P>
I woke up as it were from my analysis of the situation to discover 
him bent over a splendid spittoon, cursing incoherently, retching a 
little, and spitting out the end of his cigar which he had bitten 
off in his last attempt at self-control, and withal fully prepared 
as soon as he had cleared for action to give me just all that he 
considered to be the contents of his mind upon the condition of 
mine.
<P>
Well, why shouldn't I talk my mind to him?  He'd never had an 
outside view of himself for years, and I resolved to stand up to 
him.  We went at it hammer and tongs!  It became clear that he 
supposed me to be a Socialist, a zealous, embittered hater of all 
ownership--and also an educated man of the vilest, most 
pretentiously superior description.   His principal grievance was 
that I thought I knew everything; to that he recurred again and 
again. . . .
<P>
We had been maintaining an armed truce with each other since my 
resolve to go up to Cambridge, and now we had out all that had 
accumulated between us.  There had been stupendous accumulations. . . .
<P>
The particular things we said and did in that bawlmg encounter 
matter nothing at all in this story.  I can't now estimate how near 
we came to fisticuffs.  It ended with my saying, after a pungent 
reminder of benefits conferred and remembered, that I didn't want to 
stay another hour in his house.  I went upstairs, in a state of 
puerile fury, to pack and go off to the Railway Hotel, while he, 
with ironical civility, telephoned for a cab.
<P>
"Good riddance!" shouted my uncle, seeing me off into the night.

On the face of it our row was preposterous, but the underlying 
reality of our quarrel was the essential antagonism, it seemed to 
me, in all human affairs, the antagonism between ideas and the 
established method, that is to say, between ideas and the rule of 
thumb.  The world I hate is the rule-of-thumb world, the thing I and 
my kind of people exist for primarily is to battle with that, to 
annoy it, disarrange it, reconstruct it.  We question everything, 
disturb anything that cannot give a clear justification to our 
questioning, because we believe inherently that our sense of 
disorder implies the possibility of a better order.  Of course we 
are detestable.  My uncle was of that other vaster mass who accept 
everything for the thing it seems to be, hate enquiry and analysis 
as a tramp hates washing, dread and resist change, oppose 
experiment, despise science.  The world is our battleground; and all 
history, all literature that matters, all science, deals with this 
conflict of the thing that is and the speculative "if" that will 
destroy it.
<P>
But that is why I did not see Margaret Seddon again for five years.
