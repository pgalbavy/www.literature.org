<P>
When John Fox came into a country where whisky freezes solid and
may be used as a paper-weight for a large part of the year, he came
without the ideals and illusions that usually hamper the progress
of more delicately nurtured adventurers.  Born and reared on the
frontier fringe of the United States, he took with him into Canada
a primitive cast of mind, an elemental simplicity and grip on
things, as it were, that insured him immediate success in his new
career.  From a mere servant of the Hudson Bay Company, driving a
paddle with the voyageurs and carrying goods on his back across the
portages, he swiftly rose to a Factorship and took charge of a
trading post at Fort Angelus.
<P>
Here, because of his elemental simplicity, he took to himself a
native wife, and, by reason of the connubial bliss that followed,
he escaped the unrest and vain longings that curse the days of more
fastidious men, spoil their work, and conquer them in the end.  He
lived contentedly, was at single purposes with the business he was
set there to do, and achieved a brilliant record in the service of
the Company.  About this time his wife died, was claimed by her
people, and buried with savage circumstance in a tin trunk in the
top of a tree.
<P>
Two sons she had borne him, and when the Company promoted him, he
journeyed with them still deeper into the vastness of the North-
West Territory to a place called Sin Rock, where he took charge of
a new post in a more important fur field.  Here he spent several
lonely and depressing months, eminently disgusted with the
unprepossessing appearance of the Indian maidens, and greatly
worried by his growing sons who stood in need of a mother's care.
Then his eyes chanced upon Lit-lit.
<P>
"Lit-lit--well, she is Lit-lit," was the fashion in which he
despairingly described her to his chief clerk, Alexander McLean.
<P>
McLean was too fresh from his Scottish upbringing--"not dry behind
the ears yet," John Fox put it--to take to the marriage customs of
the country.  Nevertheless he was not averse to the Factor's
imperilling his own immortal soul, and, especially, feeling an
ominous attraction himself for Lit-lit, he was sombrely content to
clinch his own soul's safety by seeing her married to the Factor.
<P>
Nor is it to be wondered that McLean's austere Scotch soul stood in
danger of being thawed in the sunshine of Lit-lit's eyes.  She was
pretty, and slender, and willowy; without the massive face and
temperamental stolidity of the average squaw.  "Lit-lit," so called
from her fashion, even as a child, of being fluttery, of darting
about from place to place like a butterfly, of being inconsequent
and merry, and of laughing as lightly as she darted and danced
about.
<P>
Lit-lit was the daughter of Snettishane, a prominent chief in the
tribe, by a half-breed mother, and to him the Factor fared casually
one summer day to open negotiations of marriage.  He sat with the
chief in the smoke of a mosquito smudge before his lodge, and
together they talked about everything under the sun, or, at least,
everything that in the Northland is under the sun, with the sole
exception of marriage.  John Fox had come particularly to talk of
marriage; Snettishane knew it, and John Fox knew he knew it,
wherefore the subject was religiously avoided.  This is alleged to
be Indian subtlety.  In reality it is transparent simplicity.
<P>
The hours slipped by, and Fox and Snettishane smoked interminable
pipes, looking each other in the eyes with a guilelessness superbly
histrionic.  In the mid-afternoon McLean and his brother clerk,
McTavish, strolled past, innocently uninterested, on their way to
the river.  When they strolled back again an hour later, Fox and
Snettishane had attained to a ceremonious discussion of the
condition and quality of the gunpowder and bacon which the Company
was offering in trade.  Meanwhile Lit-lit, divining the Factor's
errand, had crept in under the rear wall of the lodge, and through
the front flap was peeping out at the two logomachists by the
mosquito smudge.  She was flushed and happy-eyed, proud that no
less a man than the Factor (who stood next to God in the Northland
hierarchy) had singled her out, femininely curious to see at close
range what manner of man he was.  Sunglare on the ice, camp smoke,
and weather beat had burned his face to a copper-brown, so that her
father was as fair as he, while she was fairer.  She was remotely
glad of this, and more immediately glad that he was large and
strong, though his great black beard half frightened her, it was so
strange.
<P>
Being very young, she was unversed in the ways of men.  Seventeen
times she had seen the sun travel south and lose itself beyond the
sky-line, and seventeen times she had seen it travel back again and
ride the sky day and night till there was no night at all.  And
through these years she had been cherished jealously by
Snettishane, who stood between her and all suitors, listening
disdainfully to the young hunters as they bid for her hand, and
turning them away as though she were beyond price.  Snettishane was
mercenary.  Lit-lit was to him an investment.  She represented so
much capital, from which he expected to receive, not a certain
definite interest, but an incalculable interest.
<P>
And having thus been reared in a manner as near to that of the
nunnery as tribal conditions would permit, it was with a great and
maidenly anxiety that she peeped out at the man who had surely come
for her, at the husband who was to teach her all that was yet
unlearned of life, at the masterful being whose word was to be her
law, and who was to mete and bound her actions and comportment for
the rest of her days.
<P>
But, peeping through the front flap of the lodge, flushed and
thrilling at the strange destiny reaching out for her, she grew
disappointed as the day wore along, and the Factor and her father
still talked pompously of matters concerning other things and not
pertaining to marriage things at all.  As the sun sank lower and
lower toward the north and midnight approached, the Factor began
making unmistakable preparations for departure.  As he turned to
stride away Lit-lit's heart sank; but it rose again as he halted,
half turning on one heel.
<P>
"Oh, by the way, Snettishane," he said, "I want a squaw to wash for
me and mend my clothes."
<P>
Snettishane grunted and suggested Wanidani, who was an old woman
and toothless.
<P>
"No, no," interposed the Factor.  "What I want is a wife.  I've
been kind of thinking about it, and the thought just struck me that
you might know of some one that would suit."
<P>
Snettishane looked interested, whereupon the Factor retraced his
steps, casually and carelessly to linger and discuss this new and
incidental topic.
<P>
"Kattou?" suggested Snettishane.
<P>
"She has but one eye," objected the Factor.
<P>
"Laska?"
<P>
"Her knees be wide apart when she stands upright.  Kips, your
biggest dog, can leap between her knees when she stands upright."
<P>
"Senatee?" went on the imperturbable Snettishane.
<P>
But John Fox feigned anger, crying:  "What foolishness is this?  Am
I old, that thou shouldst mate me with old women?  Am I toothless?
lame of leg? blind of eye?  Or am I poor that no bright-eyed maiden
may look with favour upon me?  Behold!  I am the Factor, both rich
and great, a power in the land, whose speech makes men tremble and
is obeyed!"
<P>
Snettishane was inwardly pleased, though his sphinx-like visage
never relaxed.  He was drawing the Factor, and making him break
ground.  Being a creature so elemental as to have room for but one
idea at a time, Snettishane could pursue that one idea a greater
distance than could John Fox.  For John Fox, elemental as he was,
was still complex enough to entertain several glimmering ideas at a
time, which debarred him from pursuing the one as single-heartedly
or as far as did the chief.
<P>
Snettishane calmly continued calling the roster of eligible
maidens, which, name by name, as fast as uttered, were stamped
ineligible by John Fox, with specified objections appended.  Again
he gave it up and started to return to the Fort.  Snettishane
watched him go, making no effort to stop him, but seeing him, in
the end, stop himself.
<P>
"Come to think of it," the Factor remarked, "we both of us forgot
Lit-lit.  Now I wonder if she'll suit me?"
<P>
Snettishane met the suggestion with a mirthless face, behind the
mask of which his soul grinned wide.  It was a distinct victory.
Had the Factor gone but one step farther, perforce Snettishane
would himself have mentioned the name of Lit-lit, but--the Factor
had not gone that one step farther.
<P>
The chief was non-committal concerning Lit-lit's suitability, till
he drove the white man into taking the next step in order of
procedure.
<P>
"Well," the Factor meditated aloud, "the only way to find out is to
make a try of it."  He raised his voice.  "So I will give for Lit-
lit ten blankets and three pounds of tobacco which is good
tobacco."
<P>
Snettishane replied with a gesture which seemed to say that all the
blankets and tobacco in all the world could not compensate him for
the loss of Lit-lit and her manifold virtues.  When pressed by the
Factor to set a price, he coolly placed it at five hundred
blankets, ten guns, fifty pounds of tobacco, twenty scarlet cloths,
ten bottles of rum, a music-box, and lastly the good-will and best
offices of the Factor, with a place by his fire.
<P>
The Factor apparently suffered a stroke of apoplexy, which stroke
was successful in reducing the blankets to two hundred and in
cutting out the place by the fire--an unheard-of condition in the
marriages of white men with the daughters of the soil.  In the end,
after three hours more of chaffering, they came to an agreement.
For Lit-lit Snettishane was to receive one hundred blankets, five
pounds of tobacco, three guns, and a bottle of rum, goodwill and
best offices included, which according to John Fox, was ten
blankets and a gun more than she was worth.  And as he went home
through the wee sma' hours, the three-o'clock sun blazing in the
due north-east, he was unpleasantly aware that Snettishane had
bested him over the bargain.
<P>
Snettishane, tired and victorious, sought his bed, and discovered
Lit-lit before she could escape from the lodge.
<P>
He grunted knowingly:  "Thou hast seen.  Thou has heard.  Wherefore
it be plain to thee thy father's very great wisdom and
understanding.  I have made for thee a great match.  Heed my words
and walk in the way of my words, go when I say go, come when I bid
thee come, and we shall grow fat with the wealth of this big white
man who is a fool according to his bigness."
<P>
The next day no trading was done at the store.  The Factor opened
whisky before breakfast, to the delight of McLean and McTavish,
gave his dogs double rations, and wore his best moccasins.  Outside
the Fort preparations were under way for a POTLATCH.  Potlatch
means "a giving," and John Fox's intention was to signalize his
marriage with Lit-lit by a potlatch as generous as she was good-
looking.  In the afternoon the whole tribe gathered to the feast.
Men, women, children, and dogs gorged to repletion, nor was there
one person, even among the chance visitors and stray hunters from
other tribes, who failed to receive some token of the bridegroom's
largess.
<P>
Lit-lit, tearfully shy and frightened, was bedecked by her bearded
husband with a new calico dress, splendidly beaded moccasins, a
gorgeous silk handkerchief over her raven hair, a purple scarf
about her throat, brass ear-rings and finger-rings, and a whole
pint of pinchbeck jewellery, including a Waterbury watch.
Snettishane could scarce contain himself at the spectacle, but
watching his chance drew her aside from the feast.
<P>
"Not this night, nor the next night," he began ponderously, "but in
the nights to come, when I shall call like a raven by the river
bank, it is for thee to rise up from thy big husband, who is a
fool, and come to me.
<P>
"Nay, nay," he went on hastily, at sight of the dismay in her face
at turning her back upon her wonderful new life.  "For no sooner
shall this happen than thy big husband, who is a fool, will come
wailing to my lodge.  Then it is for thee to wail likewise,
claiming that this thing is not well, and that the other thing thou
dost not like, and that to be the wife of the Factor is more than
thou didst bargain for, only wilt thou be content with more
blankets, and more tobacco, and more wealth of various sorts for
thy poor old father, Snettishane.  Remember well, when I call in
the night, like a raven, from the river bank."
<P>
Lit-lit nodded; for to disobey her father was a peril she knew
well; and, furthermore, it was a little thing he asked, a short
separation from the Factor, who would know only greater gladness at
having her back.  She returned to the feast, and, midnight being
well at hand, the Factor sought her out and led her away to the
Fort amid joking and outcry, in which the squaws were especially
conspicuous.
<P>
Lit-lit quickly found that married life with the head-man of a fort
was even better than she had dreamed.  No longer did she have to
fetch wood and water and wait hand and foot upon cantankerous
menfolk.  For the first time in her life she could lie abed till
breakfast was on the table.  And what a bed!--clean and soft, and
comfortable as no bed she had ever known.  And such food!  Flour,
cooked into biscuits, hot-cakes and bread, three times a day and
every day, and all one wanted!  Such prodigality was hardly
believable.
<P>
To add to her contentment, the Factor was cunningly kind.  He had
buried one wife, and he knew how to drive with a slack rein that
went firm only on occasion, and then went very firm.  "Lit-lit is
boss of this place," he announced significantly at the table the
morning after the wedding.  "What she says goes.  Understand?"  And
McLean and McTavish understood.  Also, they knew that the Factor
had a heavy hand.
<P>
But Lit-lit did not take advantage.  Taking a leaf from the book of
her husband, she at once assumed charge of his own growing sons,
giving them added comforts and a measure of freedom like to that
which he gave her.  The two sons were loud in the praise of their
new mother; McLean and McTavish lifted their voices; and the Factor
bragged of the joys of matrimony till the story of her good
behaviour and her husband's satisfaction became the property of all
the dwellers in the Sin Rock district.
<P>
Whereupon Snettishane, with visions of his incalculable interest
keeping him awake of nights, thought it time to bestir himself.  On
the tenth night of her wedded life Lit-lit was awakened by the
croaking of a raven, and she knew that Snettishane was waiting for
her by the river bank.  In her great happiness she had forgotten
her pact, and now it came back to her with behind it all the
childish terror of her father.  For a time she lay in fear and
trembling, loath to go, afraid to stay.  But in the end the Factor
won the silent victory, and his kindness plus his great muscles and
square jaw, nerved her to disregard Snettishane's call.
<P>
But in the morning she arose very much afraid, and went about her
duties in momentary fear of her father's coming.  As the day wore
along, however, she began to recover her spirits.  John Fox,
soundly berating McLean and McTavish for some petty dereliction of
duty, helped her to pluck up courage.  She tried not to let him go
out of her sight, and when she followed him into the huge cache and
saw him twirling and tossing great bales around as though they were
feather pillows, she felt strengthened in her disobedience to her
father.  Also (it was her first visit to the warehouse, and Sin
Rock was the chief distributing point to several chains of lesser
posts), she was astounded at the endlessness of the wealth there
stored away.
<P>
This sight and the picture in her mind's eye of the bare lodge of
Snettishane, put all doubts at rest.  Yet she capped her conviction
by a brief word with one of her step-sons.  "White daddy good?" was
what she asked, and the boy answered that his father was the best
man he had ever known.  That night the raven croaked again.  On the
night following the croaking was more persistent.  It awoke the
Factor, who tossed restlessly for a while.  Then he said aloud,
"Damn that raven," and Lit-lit laughed quietly under the blankets.
<P>
In the morning, bright and early, Snettishane put in an ominous
appearance and was set to breakfast in the kitchen with Wanidani.
He refused "squaw food," and a little later bearded his son-in-law
in the store where the trading was done.  Having learned, he said,
that his daughter was such a jewel, he had come for more blankets,
more tobacco, and more guns--especially more guns.  He had
certainly been cheated in her price, he held, and he had come for
justice.  But the Factor had neither blankets nor justice to spare.
Whereupon he was informed that Snettishane had seen the missionary
at Three Forks, who had notified him that such marriages were not
made in heaven, and that it was his father's duty to demand his
daughter back.
<P>
"I am good Christian man now," Snettishane concluded.  "I want my
Lit-lit to go to heaven."
<P>
The Factor's reply was short and to the point; for he directed his
father-in-law to go to the heavenly antipodes, and by the scruff of
the neck and the slack of the blanket propelled him on that trail
as far as the door.
<P>
But Snettishane sneaked around and in by the kitchen, cornering
Lit-lit in the great living-room of the Fort.
<P>
"Mayhap thou didst sleep over-sound last night when I called by the
river bank," he began, glowering darkly.
<P>
"Nay, I was awake and heard."  Her heart was beating as though it
would choke her, but she went on steadily, "And the night before I
was awake and heard, and yet again the night before."
<P>
And thereat, out of her great happiness and out of the fear that it
might be taken from her, she launched into an original and glowing
address upon the status and rights of woman--the first new-woman
lecture delivered north of Fifty-three.
<P>
But it fell on unheeding ears.  Snettishane was still in the dark
ages.  As she paused for breath, he said threateningly, "To-night I
shall call again like the raven."
<P>
At this moment the Factor entered the room and again helped
Snettishane on his way to the heavenly antipodes.
<P>
That night the raven croaked more persistently than ever.  Lit-lit,
who was a light sleeper, heard and smiled.  John Fox tossed
restlessly.  Then he awoke and tossed about with greater
restlessness.  He grumbled and snorted, swore under his breath and
over his breath, and finally flung out of bed.  He groped his way
to the great living-room, and from the rack took down a loaded
shot-gun--loaded with bird-shot, left therein by the careless
McTavish.
<P>
The Factor crept carefully out of the Fort and down to the river.
The croaking had ceased, but he stretched out in the long grass and
waited.  The air seemed a chilly balm, and the earth, after the
heat of the day, now and again breathed soothingly against him.
The Factor, gathered into the rhythm of it all, dozed off, with his
head upon his arm, and slept.
<P>
Fifty yards away, head resting on knees, and with his back to John
Fox, Snettishane likewise slept, gently conquered by the quietude
of the night.  An hour slipped by and then he awoke, and, without
lifting his head, set the night vibrating with the hoarse gutturals
of the raven call.
<P>
The Factor roused, not with the abrupt start of civilized man, but
with the swift and comprehensive glide from sleep to waking of the
savage.  In the night-light he made out a dark object in the midst
of the grass and brought his gun to bear upon it.  A second croak
began to rise, and he pulled the trigger.  The crickets ceased from
their sing-song chant, the wildfowl from their squabbling, and the
raven croak broke midmost and died away in gasping silence.
<P>
John Fox ran to the spot and reached for the thing he had killed,
but his fingers closed on a coarse mop of hair and he turned
Snettishane's face upward to the starlight.  He knew how a shotgun
scattered at fifty yards, and he knew that he had peppered
Snettishane across the shoulders and in the small of the back.  And
Snettishane knew that he knew, but neither referred to it
<P>
"What dost thou here?" the Factor demanded.  "It were time old
bones should be in bed."
<P>
But Snettishane was stately in spite of the bird-shot burning under
his skin.
<P>
"Old bones will not sleep," he said solemnly.  "I weep for my
daughter, for my daughter Lit-lit, who liveth and who yet is dead,
and who goeth without doubt to the white man's hell."
<P>
"Weep henceforth on the far bank, beyond ear-shot of the Fort,"
said John Fox, turning on his heel, "for the noise of thy weeping
is exceeding great and will not let one sleep of nights."
<P>
"My heart is sore," Snettishane answered, "and my days and nights
be black with sorrow."
<P>
"As the raven is black," said John Fox.
<P>
"As the raven is black," Snettishane said.
<P>
Never again was the voice of the raven heard by the river bank.
Lit-lit grows matronly day by day and is very happy.  Also, there
are sisters to the sons of John Fox's first wife who lies buried in
a tree.  Old Snettishane is no longer a visitor at the Fort, and
spends long hours raising a thin, aged voice against the filial
ingratitude of children in general and of his daughter Lit-lit in
particular.  His declining years are embittered by the knowledge
that he was cheated, and even John Fox has withdrawn the assertion
that the price for Lit-lit was too much by ten blankets and a gun.
