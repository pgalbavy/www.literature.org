<p>Mistress Spring was making everybody happy on the Green Meadows
and in the Green Forest and around the Smiling Pool. With her
gentle fingers she wakened one by one all the little sleepers
who had spent the long winter dreaming of warm summer days and
not knowing anything at all of rough, blustering Brother North
Wind or Jack Frost. As they wakened, many began to sing for joy.
But the clearest, loudest singers of all lived in the Smiling
Pool.</p>

<p>It was a long time before Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck knew
where they lived. Every night just before going to bed, Johnny
Chuck would sit on his door-step just to listen, and as he listened
somehow he felt better and happier; and he always had pleasant
dreams after listening to the sweet singers of the Smiling Pool.
Even after he had curled himself up for the night deep down in
his snug bedroom, he could hear those sweet voices, and whenever
he waked up in the night he would hear them.</p>

"Spring! Spring! Spring! Spring!<br/>
&nbsp;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!<br/>
&nbsp;So gentle, so loving, so sweet and so fair!<br/>
&nbsp;Oh, who can be cross when there's love in the air?<br/>
&nbsp;Be happy! Be joyful! And join in our song<br/>
&nbsp;And help us to send the glad tidings along!<br/>
&nbsp;Spring! Spring! Spring! Spring!<br/>
&nbsp;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!"

<p>When Johnny Chuck had first heard them, he had looked in all
the tree-tops for the singers, but not one could he see. Then
he had thought that they must be hidden in the bushes; but when
he went to look, he found that the sweet singers were not there.
It was very mysterious. Finally he asked Peter Rabbit if he knew
who the sweet singers were and where they were. Peter didn't know,
but he was willing to try to find out. Peter is always willing
to try to find out about things he doesn't already know about.
So Johnny Chuck and Peter Rabbit started out to find the sweet
singers.</p>

<p>"I believe they are down in the old bulrushes around the Smiling
Pool,"  said Peter Rabbit, as he stood listening with a hand behind
one long ear.</p>

<p>So over to the Smiling Pool they hurried. The nearer they got,
the louder became the voices singing:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Spring! Spring! Spring! Spring!<br/>
&nbsp;Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful Spring!"

</p>
</div>
<p>But look as they would, they couldn't see a single singer among
the brown bulrushes. It was very strange, very strange indeed!
It seemed as if the voices came right out of the Smiling Pool
itself!</p>

<p>When Peter Rabbit made a little noise, as he hopped out on the
bank where he could look all over the Smiling Pool, the singing
stopped. After he had sat perfectly still for a little while,
it began again. There was no doubt about it this time; those voices
came right out of the water.</p>

<p>Johnny Chuck stared at Peter Rabbit, and Peter stared at Johnny
Chuck. Nobody was to be seen in the Smiling Pool, and yet there
were those voices&mdash;oh, so many of them&mdash;coming right out of the
water.</p>

<p>"How can birds stay under water and still sing?" asked Johnny
Chuck.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck whirled around, to find Jerry Muskrat
peeping up at them from a hole in the bank almost under their
feet.</p>

<p>{Illustration: "Ho, ho, ho! That's the best joke this spring!"
shouted Jerry Muskrat.}</p>

<p>"Ho, ho, ho! That's the best joke this spring!" shouted Jerry
Muskrat, and laughed until he had to hold his sides. "Birds under
water! Ho, ho, ho!"</p>
