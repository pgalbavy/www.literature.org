<p>There is no reason to discredit the truth of the accounts given
by hunters in the west of wild beasts of prodigious activity,
strength and ferocity, and that, belonging to no distinct class
of animals, are a mixture of the fiercest. Trappers and explorers
in the wild regions of the Rocky Mountains, sometimes meet a beast
to which they have given the expressive name of "Indian devil,"
whose power and daring are such that a party of veteran hunters
have been known to withdraw from a section frequented by him,
simply to avoid a fight. While the stories about them may be exaggerated
at times, there is no doubt that such animals exist, and there
is good reason to hold them in dread.</p>

<p>The beast that Fred Linden and Terry Clark saw in the path before
them resembled a panther more than any animal they could call
to mind. It might have been described as a cross between a tiger
and panther, had that been possible. Fred had heard his father
speak of those creatures that were detested and feared, and he
was sure that they were going to have trouble with this one. How
fortunate that each boy held a loaded gun in his grasp!</p>

<p>The action of the hybrid was as peculiar as his appearance. He
seemed to have been trotting quietly along the trail with his
nose down, as though following the scent, when he became aware
that his game had stopped, and were surveying him with some interest.
The beast also came to an abrupt halt and threw up his head, as
though he was equally curious to learn something about the party
of the first part.</p>

<p>Standing thus, with his nose quite high in the air, it struck
both boys that he showed a resemblance to a wolf as well as a
panther. He was larger than either, and there could be no doubt
that he was amazingly muscular, active and courageous.</p>

<p>Thus stood the opposing parties, as they may be called, for a
full minute. Each looked steadily at the other, the space between
them being no more than fifty yards. Had it been less, both boys
would have fired at him, but they were afraid that such wounds
as they could inflict would only rouse his fury. One of the most
marked peculiarities of the "Indian devil" is his toughness, some
of the stories in this respect being almost incredible.</p>

<p>All at once the beast seemed to be overcome with disgust for
the two youngsters. He whisked squarely about and trotted away,
showing a bushy fox-like tail that almost swept the ground.</p>

<p>"I call that an insoolt!" exclaimed Terence Clark, bringing his
gun to his shoulder, taking quick aim and letting fly, before
his companion could object. He insisted that he had hit the animal,
but it is likely he was mistaken, for it gave no sign of being
touched, trotting with the same even step until it passed from
sight around a bend in the path.</p>

<p>"I hit him hard," insisted Terry, who proceeded to reload his
piece; "there's no doubt of the same."</p>

<p>"If you had done so, he would have given some evidence of it,
but there was not the slightest."</p>

<p>"Ye know that such creatures are tough," coolly remarked Terry;
"and the bullet has glanced off his side as from a rock."</p>

<p>"If I could believe that," said the other, "I would hide somewhere
until he went away, for it would be only a waste of powder and
ball to shoot at him."</p>

<p>"Hasn't he gone off? What are ye talking about?"</p>

<p>"Gone away? Yes; for awhile, but we are not done with that beast
yet; we shall have trouble with him."</p>

<p>"If we keep our guns loaded and our powder dry, we'll open on
him, and if we can't kill him we'll fill him with so much lead
that he won't be able to travel fast, and we'll bid him good-by
and walk from him."</p>

<p>The boys waited a few minutes, thinking possibly that the strange
creature would show himself again, but he did not appear, and
they turned about and resumed their journey.</p>

<p>They were now on one of the best stretches of the trail. The
ground was even, there were no bowlders or rocks in the path to
make walking difficult, and the undergrowth, which in some places
was quite an obstruction, did not interfere. By the middle of
the afternoon, Fred was confident they were twenty miles at least
on the road, and he said that if they came upon an inviting place,
they would go into camp for the night. The package which each
carried on his back was wrapped in a blanket that could be used
to lie upon by the fire, or in severe weather, though they would
have cared little had they owned nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Their good spirits continued, and they were walking at a leisurely
pace, when a rustling in the bushes on the left caused them to
look in that direction. There stood the strange beast, not fifty
feet away, head erect, and staring at them with the same inquiring
look that he showed some time before.</p>

<p>"I wonder how he likes a side view of us," said Terry, partly
amused, but somewhat frightened; "I think he is close enough for
us to fetch him this time."</p>

<p>Fred was inclined to give him a shot, but he felt some doubt,
and while he was considering the question, the beast whisked about
and vanished like a flash.</p>

<p>"He is a strange animal," said Fred, lowering his gun, which
he was in the act of raising; "and I am more satisfied now than
ever that we shall have trouble with him. The first time that
we gain a fair shot, that is, like we had just now, let's tumble
him over. He may be as daring and tough as the hunters say, but
there isn't any animal tough enough to withstand a couple of well-aimed
bullets."</p>

<p>"I agree wid ye&mdash;that is, after one was fired. That shot of mine
was well aimed and struck, but it takes somethin' more to bring
him down, as a colored friend of mine once said when a house tumbled
over on his head."</p>

<p>"You saw how spry a creature he is, and if he should happen to
drop down upon us from the branch of a tree, those sharp claws
of his would play the mischief with us."</p>

<p>Since there was no place in sight that suited for camping, Terry
reloaded, and they kept on. After the fright they had received,
you may be sure they maintained a close watch of the wood in every
direction. As yet they had seen no game from which to procure
food, but they wanted to go into camp near a spring or stream
of water. The latter is generally looked upon as one of the indispensables
by a party of campers, and it was not likely that the youths would
have to travel far before finding what they wanted.</p>

<p>The sun had not yet dropped below the horizon when they struck
the very spot. There were the bubbling brook, lined by mossy banks,
the small open space, the tall column-like trunks; and the heavy
overhanging boughs, which, late though it was in the season, would
allow but few drops of a shower to find their way through. The
air was cool, but there were no signs of a storm.</p>

<p>"There couldn't be a better place," said Fred, when he had noted
all the points; "here is every thing that a party can want, except
it be supper, which they ought to bring with them."</p>

<p>"And somebody has been here ahead of us," added Terry, kicking
apart the ashes at the base of a large tree; "there's where the
fire was kindled."</p>

<p>"No doubt it is where father and the rest of them spent the first
night after leaving home: that shows that we have made good progress,
and, if no accident happens, we shall arrive on time."</p>

<p>"There is no need of our hurryin', as I understood that a gintleman
once obsarved whin they were goin' to hang him; if we are two
or three days late in gettin' there, what's the odds?"</p>

<p>"None&mdash;though this fine weather can not last long, and when it
is over, I should like to be at the end of our journey, where
we shall have good shelter. I wonder what has become of the wild
beast?"</p>

<p>"Be the powers! but there he comes!"</p>

<p>The words had hardly passed the lips of the startled Terry Clark,
when the strange animal was seen in the path in front of them,
in precisely the same position as when first noticed. He had evidently
passed around to the front, as though determined to study the
boys from every point of view. He seemed to have been standing
for some minutes before discovered by the boys, and was now observed
approaching, as the Irish lad had announced.</p>

<p>He did not gallop or trot, but walked slowly, just as though
having made up his mind to take a select meal off the youngsters,
he was going to do so with the deliberation of an epicure that
extracts the fullest enjoyment from his delicacies.</p>

<p>There was something unnerving in the sight of the frightful animal
approaching in this noiseless fashion, his jaws parted just enough
to show his long, white teeth, but giving utterance to no growl,
or threatening act, beyond the mere advance itself. His large,
round eyes had a phosphorescent glow, and the long, sinewy body
and limbs were the repository of a strength and activity that
might well make a veteran hunter timid about encountering him.</p>

<p>"By gracious!" said Fred Linden; "we're in for it now; he doesn't
mean to wait for us to attack him, but is coming for us."</p>

<p>"If I was called on to make a wager," said Terry, as cool as
ever, "that would be the view that I would take of the same."</p>

<p>"You fire first and I will follow; take good aim, and send your
bullet right between the eyes."</p>

<p>There was no time to spare, for the beast at that instant was
within a dozen yards. Terry Clark brought his rifle to his shoulder,
sighted quickly, and pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>That he struck the creature was proven by his snarling growl
and slight upward leap; but instead of stopping, he broke into
a gallop and came straight on.</p>

<p>Then Fred Linden aimed and fired, but he also failed to check
the advance of the animal.</p>
