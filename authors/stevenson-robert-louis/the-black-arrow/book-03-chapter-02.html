<p>Thoroughly drenched and chilled, the two adventurers returned to their
position in the gorse.
</p><p>"I pray Heaven that Capper make good speed!" said Dick. "I vow a candle
to St. Mary of Shoreby if he come before the hour!"
</p><p>"Y'are in a hurry, Master Dick?" asked Greensheve.
</p><p>"Ay, good fellow," answered Dick; "for in that house lieth my lady, whom
I love, and who should these be that lie about her secretly by night?
Unfriends, for sure!"
</p><p>"Well," returned Greensheve, "an John come speedily, we shall give a
good account of them. They are not two-score at the outside--I judge so
by the spacing of their sentries--and, taken where they are, lying so
widely, one score would scatter them like sparrows. And yet, Master
Dick, an she be in Sir Daniel's power already, it will little hurt that
she should change into another's. Who should these be?"
</p><p>"I do suspect the Lord of Shoreby," Dick replied. "When came they?"
</p><p>"They began to come, Master Dick," said Greensheve, "about the time ye
crossed the wall. I had not lain there the space of a minute ere I
marked the first of the knaves crawling round the corner."
</p><p>The last light had been already extinguished in the little house when
they were wading in the wash of the breakers, and it was impossible to
predict at what moment the lurking men about the garden wall might make
their onslaught. Of two evils, Dick preferred the least. He preferred
that Joanna should remain under the guardianship of Sir Daniel rather
than pass into the clutches of Lord Shoreby; and his mind was made up,
if the house should be assaulted, to come at once to the relief of the
besieged.
</p><p>But the time passed, and still there was no movement. From quarter of an
hour to quarter of an hour the same signal passed about the garden wall,
as if the leader desired to assure himself of the vigilance of his
scattered followers; but in every other particular the neighbourhood of
the little house lay undisturbed.
</p><p>Presently Dick's reinforcements began to arrive. The night was not yet
old before nearly a score of men crouched beside him in the gorse.
</p><p>Separating these into two bodies, he took the command of the smaller
himself, and entrusted the larger to the leadership of Greensheve.
</p><p>"Now, Kit," said he to this last, "take me your men to the near angle of
the garden wall upon the beach. Post them strongly, and wait till that
ye hear me falling on upon the other side. It is those upon the
sea-front that I would fain make certain of, for there will be the
leader. The rest will run; even let them. And now, lads, let no man draw
an arrow; ye will but hurt friends. Take to the steel, and keep to the
steel; and if we have the uppermost, I promise every man of you a gold
noble when I come to mine estate."
</p><p>Out of the odd collection of broken men, thieves, murderers, and ruined
peasantry, whom Duckworth had gathered together to serve the purposes of
his revenge, some of the boldest and the most experienced in war had
volunteered to follow Richard Shelton. The service of watching Sir
Daniel's movements in the town of Shoreby had from the first been
irksome to their temper, and they had of late begun to grumble loudly
and threaten to disperse. The prospect of a sharp encounter and possible
spoils restored them to good-humour, and they joyfully prepared for
battle.
</p><p>Their long tabards thrown aside, they appeared, some in plain green
jerkins, and some in stout leathern jacks; under their hoods many wore
bonnets strengthened by iron plates; and, for offensive armour, swords,
daggers, a few stout boar-spears, and a dozen of bright bills, put them
in a posture to engage even regular feudal troops. The bows, quivers,
and tabards were concealed among the gorse, and the two bands set
resolutely forward.
</p><p>Dick, when he had reached the other side of the house, posted his six
men in a line, about twenty yards from the garden wall, and took
position himself a few paces in front. Then they all shouted with one
voice, and closed upon the enemy.
</p><p>These, lying widely scattered, stiff with cold, and taken at unawares,
sprang stupidly to their feet, and stood undecided. Before they had time
to get their courage about them, or even to form an idea of the number
and mettle of their assailants, a similar shout of onslaught sounded in
their ears from the far side of the enclosure. Thereupon they gave
themselves up for lost and ran.
</p><p>In this way the two small troops of the men of the Black Arrow closed
upon the sea-front of the garden wall, and took a part of the strangers,
as it were, between two fires; while the whole of the remainder ran for
their lives in different directions, and were soon scattered in the
darkness.
</p><p>For all that, the fight was but beginning. Dick's outlaws, although they
had the advantage of the surprise, were still considerably outnumbered
by the men they had surrounded. The tide had flowed, in the meanwhile;
the beach was narrowed to a strip; and on this wet field, between the
surf and the garden wall, there began, in the darkness, a doubtful,
furious, and deadly contest.
</p><p>The strangers were well armed; they fell in silence upon their
assailants; and the affray became a series of single combats. Dick, who
had come first into the mellay, was engaged by three; the first he cut
down at the first blow, but the other two coming upon him, hotly, he was
fain to give ground before their onset. One of these two was a huge
fellow, almost a giant for stature, and armed with a two-handed sword,
which he brandished like a switch. Against this opponent, with his reach
of arm and the length and weight of his weapon, Dick and his bill were
quite defenceless; and had the other continued to join vigorously in the
attack, the lad must have indubitably fallen. This second man, however,
less in stature and slower in his movements, paused for a moment to peer
about him in the darkness, and to give ear to the sounds of the battle.
</p><p>The giant still pursued his advantage, and still Dick fled before him,
spying for his chance. Then the huge blade flashed and descended, and
the lad, leaping on one side and running in, slashed sideways and
upwards with his bill. A roar of agony responded, and, before the
wounded man could raise his formidable weapon, Dick, twice repeating his
blow, had brought him to the ground.
</p><p>The next moment he was engaged, upon more equal terms, with his second
pursuer. Here there was no great difference in size, and though the man,
fighting with sword and dagger against a bill, and being wary and quick
of fence, had a certain superiority of arms, Dick more than made it up
by his greater agility on foot. Neither at first gained any obvious
advantage; but the older man was still insensibly profiting by the
ardour of the younger to lead him where he would; and presently Dick
found that they had crossed the whole width of the beach, and were now
fighting above the knees in the spume and bubble of the breakers. Here
his own superior activity was rendered useless; he found himself more or
less at the discretion of his foe; yet a little, and he had his back
turned upon his own men, and saw that this adroit and skilful adversary
was bent upon drawing him farther and farther away.
</p><p>Dick ground his teeth. He determined to decide the combat instantly; and
when the wash of the next wave had ebbed and left them dry, he rushed
in, caught a blow upon his bill, and leaped right at the throat of his
opponent. The man went down backwards, with Dick still upon the top of
him; and the next wave, speedily succeeding to the last, buried him
below a rush of water.
</p><p>While he was still submerged, Dick forced his dagger from his grasp, and
rose to his feet, victorious.
</p><p>"Yield ye!" he said. "I give you life."
</p><p>"I yield me," said the other, getting to his knees. "Ye fight, like a
young man, ignorantly and foolhardily; but, by the array of the saints,
ye fight bravely!"
</p><p>Dick turned to the beach. The combat was still raging doubtfully in the
night; over the hoarse roar of the breakers steel clanged upon steel,
and cries of pain and the shout of battle resounded.
</p><p>"Lead me to your captain, youth," said the conquered knight. "It is fit
this butchery should cease."
</p><p>"Sir," replied Dick, "so far as these brave fellows have a captain, the
poor gentleman who here addresses you is he."
</p><p>"Call off your dogs, then, and I will bid my villains hold," returned
the other.
</p><p>There was something noble both in the voice and manner of his late
opponent, and Dick instantly dismissed all fears of treachery.
</p><p>"Lay down your arms, men!" cried the stranger knight. "I have yielded
me, upon promise of life."
</p><p>The tone of the stranger was one of absolute command, and almost
instantly the din and confusion of the mellay ceased.
</p><p>"Lawless," cried Dick, "are ye safe?"
</p><p>"Ay," cried Lawless, "safe and hearty."
</p><p>"Light me the lantern," said Dick.
</p><p>"Is not Sir Daniel here?" inquired the knight.
</p><p>"Sir Daniel?" echoed Dick. "Now, by the rood, I pray not. It would go
ill with me if he were."
</p><p>"Ill with <u>you</u>, fair sir?" inquired the other. "Nay, then, if ye be
not of Sir Daniel's party, I profess I comprehend no longer. Wherefore,
then, fell ye upon mine ambush? in what quarrel, my young and very fiery
friend? to what earthly purpose? and, to make a clear end of
questioning, to what good gentleman have I surrendered?"
</p><p>But before Dick could answer, a voice spoke in the darkness from close
by. Dick could see the speaker's black and white badge, and the
respectful salute which he addressed to his superior.
</p><p>"My lord," said he, "if these gentlemen be unfriends to Sir Daniel, it
is pity, indeed, we should have been at blows with them; but it were
tenfold greater that either they or we should linger here. The watchers
in the house----unless they be all dead or deaf----have heard our
hammering this quarter-hour agone; instantly they will have signalled to
the town; and unless we be the livelier in our departure, we are like to
be taken, both of us, by a fresh foe."
</p><p>"Hawksley is in the right," added the lord. "How please ye, sir? Whither
shall we march?"
</p><p>"Nay, my lord," said Dick, "go where ye will for me. I do begin to
suspect we have some ground of friendship, and if, indeed, I began our
acquaintance somewhat ruggedly, I would not churlishly continue. Let us,
then, separate, my lord, you laying your right hand in mine; and at the
hour and place that ye shall name, let us encounter and agree."
</p><p>"Y'are too trustful, boy," said the other; "but this time your trust is
not misplaced. I will meet you at the point of day at St. Bride's Cross.
Come, lads, follow!"
</p><p>The strangers disappeared from the scene with a rapidity that seemed
suspicious; and while the outlaws fell to the congenial task of rifling
the dead bodies, Dick made once more the circuit of the garden wall to
examine the front of the house. In a little upper loophole of the roof
he beheld a light set; and as it would certainly be visible in town from
the back windows of Sir Daniel's mansion, he doubted not that this was
the signal feared by Hawksley, and that ere long the lances of the
Knight of Tunstall would arrive upon the scene.
</p><p>He put his ear to the ground, and it seemed to him as if he heard a
jarring and hollow noise from townward. Back to the beach he went
hurrying. But the work was already done; the last body was disarmed and
stripped to the skin, and four fellows were already wading seaward to
commit it to the mercies of the deep.
</p><p>A few minutes later, when there debouched out of the nearest lanes of
Shoreby some two-score horsemen, hastily arrayed and moving at the
gallop of their steeds, the neighbourhood of the house beside the sea
was entirely silent and deserted.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Dick and his men had returned to the alehouse of the Goat and
Bagpipes to snatch some hours of sleep before the morning tryst.
