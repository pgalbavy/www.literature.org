<p>Swinging into the broad expanse of Sheepscot Bay, the <em>Deerfoot</em>
moved smoothly up the river which bears the same name. Captain
Landon held her to the moderate speed of fifteen miles or so an
hour. There was no call for haste and he was wise not to strain
the engine unnecessarily. To increase the rate would be imitating
the man who drives his automobile at the highest clip, when he
has to concentrate his attention upon the machine, with no appreciation
of the beauties of the country through which he is plunging, and
continually threatened by fatal accidents.</p>

<p>Alvin held the wheel, while Chester and Mike, seated behind him,
kept intelligent trace of their progress by means of the fine
map of the United States Geological Survey. The first point identified
was Lower Mark Island on the right and close to Southport, then
came Cat Ledges, Jold, Cedarbrush, the Hendrick Light, on the
same side, while across loomed the pretty station known as Five
Islands, one of the regular stopping places of the steamers going
north or south. Omitting the smaller places, the next point which
interested our friends was the Isle of Springs, one of the best
known summer resorts in Sheepscot River. The landing was crowded
with passengers, waiting for the steamer <em>Gardiner</em> from
Augusta, the capital of the State, and on its way to rush through
the strait north of Southport to its destination, Ocean Point
beyond Squirrel Island.</p>

<p>The peculiarity about this plucky little steamer is that no craft
that ever plowed through those waters is so dependable. Again
and again she has made the long trip and not been out a single
minute at any of the numerous landings. She has been called the
"Pony of the Kennebec," and nothing less than an explosion of
her boiler or a collision with another craft would make her tardy
anywhere.</p>

<p>"There are many persons along the river and on the islands who
set their watches and clocks by the <em>Gardiner</em>," said Alvin,
speaking over his shoulder.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I don't know when she is due at the Isle of Springs, but as
I figure it she ought to be in sight now."</p>

<p>"And, begorrah! there she comes!" exclaimed Mike, pointing to
the left toward Goose Rock Passage, leading from Knubble Bay to
Sheepscot. The foaming billows tumbled away from the prow, as
the boat drove resistlessly forward, and the whistle sounded for
the landing. Many a time when rounding Capitol Island to the northwest
of Squirrel, with a storm raging, the spray and water have been
flung clean over the pilot house and slid over the upper deck
and streamed away off the stern.</p>

<p>Chester Haynes saluted with the whistle, but the captain of the
<em>Gardiner</em> gave no heed. His eye was upon the landing toward
which he was steaming. When the freight had been tumbled ashore
and the waiting cargo taken aboard, the gang planks were drawn
in, lines cast off, and though a dozen passengers might be pointing
toward the pier, shouting and waving hats or umbrellas, all would
be left.</p>

<p>The resinous pine trees formerly including firs, larches and
true cedars so thick that no spaces showed between, grew all the
way down the rocky hills to the water's edge. The river, without
a ripple except such as was made by passing craft, was as crystalline
as a mountain spring. Here and there a rude drawing was scratched
in the face of the cliffs, the work of the Indians who lived in
that part of Maine before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth. It
was one continuous dream which never loses its charm for those
who make the trip, no matter how often.</p>

<p>The sky remained overcast, though no rain fell, when the <em>Deerfoot</em>
drove through the Eddy, where the current narrows and is very
swift and deep. A bridge connects the mainland with Davis Island.
The launch sat so low that there was no call to the bridge tender
to open the draw. As it shot under, the peaks of the flagstaffs
showed a foot below the planking.</p>

<p>They were now approaching the pretty town of Wiscasset, from
which came the faint thrill of a locomotive whistle, as notice
that at that point a traveler could change from boats to cars.
The launch was sweeping round a bend in the river when Mike pointed
to the right with the question:</p>

<p>"Phwat's that?"</p>

<p>"It is the famous blockhouse, built in 1807 for the protection
of Wiscasset, four miles away, but it was never used because the
town was never in danger."</p>

<p>The interesting structure, which you may have seen when gliding
past in a boat, is octagonal in form, with one window on each
face of the lower story, except on the one containing a narrow
door approached by a single step of wood. As was the fashion in
building blockhouses, the second story overhangs the first and
on each face of this upper story is a square window with a long
loop-hole placed horizontally on either side. The flat roof is
surmounted by a slender cupola, also octagonal, with a window
occupying nearly all the space of each face. The whole building
is covered with shingles and for a long time after its erection
it was surrounded by an elaborate system of earthworks.</p>

<p>The <em>Deerfoot</em> slackened its speed as it came opposite.
Mike Murphy showed special interest in the old faded building.</p>

<p>"It suggists the palace of me grandfather, the Duke De Sassy,"
said he. "If ye have no great objiction, Captain, I should be
glad of a closer look at it."</p>

<p>Since the day was at their disposal, the youthful captain was
quite willing to halt and inspect the historic structure. He turned
the bow toward the bank, and stopped in deep water a few feet
from land. Mike cleared the intervening distance in an easy jump,
taking the end of the bow line which he made fast to a convenient
tree. Chester at the same time had cast out the anchor from the
stern and made fast the cable to a cleat on the after or stern
deck. The launch was thus held immovable and safe from injury.
In the meanwhile, Alvin had employed himself in shutting down
the motor, turning off the gasoline and air tank valves and making
ready to leave the launch in its usual good order.</p>

<p>Mike said:</p>

<p>"I have a brilliant suggistion to make to ye, as me uncle said
when he arranged to foight six men, by taking on one each day
instead of engaging them all at once. The same is that we indoolge
in our noon repast on shore."</p>

<p>The plans of the lads when they left home was to have dinner
at the hotel in Wiscasset, but they had been so delayed by their
leisurely ascent of the river that the meridian was past. A supply
of sandwiches, ginger ale and sarsaparilla was laid in so as to
be prepared for contingencies, and it need not be said that all
had keen appetites. Chester remarked that it was only a brief
run to the little town ahead. Moreover, it was more convenient
to eat on the launch, where they could spread the food on one
of the seats or the cover of the cockpit. But every boy would
rather chew a venison or bear steak, though tough as leather,
in preference to a tender, juicy bit of beef, and eating in the
woods is tenfold more enticing than in a house or on a boat. Besides,
they had been sitting so long that the change would be a relief.
Accordingly, Chester and Mike gathered up the big paper bags which
held the lunch, and the bottles of soft stuff, and leaped lightly
ashore.</p>

<p>The little party walked the short distance to the primitive blockhouse,
and passing a little way beyond sat down on the pine burrs and
grass and tackled the food. The clear air, the odorous breath
of the forest, and the soft ripple of the stream flowing past,
gave the repast a charm beyond that which the Waldorf-Astoria
can impart to its guests.</p>

<p>"It makes me sigh," said Mike when the last morsel of food had
disappeared and he drew the napkin across his lips, "to think
that only a few waaks are lift to us of this bliss of life."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Captain Alvin; "the days fly fast; soon I shall
have to go back to school and study so hard there will be mighty
little time left for play."</p>

<p>"The same here," added Chester in a lugubrious voice. "I don't
suppose there would be half as much fun in this sport if we took
it straight along."</p>

<p>"I'm willing to try the same for tin or twinty years; it's mesilf
that doesn't belave I'd grow weary in less time than thot. Couldn't
ye persuade your dad, you j'ining company wid him, Chister, to
give the thing a thrial for that long?"</p>

<p>Alvin shook his head.</p>

<p>"Suppose our parents should be so foolish, do you think your
father and mother would allow you to squander your time like that?"</p>

<p>Mike removed his cap and scratched his head.</p>

<p>"I'm afeard there'd be objiction from that side of the house.
Ye see that twinty years from now dad, if he's alive, which God
grant, will be an old man; thrue I'd be in me prime, and if he
was too overbearing wid me, I could lay him over me knee and spank
him, but I'd sorter hate to do that, bekase of the kindness he
had shown me in days gone by. Besides," added Mike, with a big
wink, "me mither would be sure to take dad's part, and I'm convinced
that twinty years from now she'll be bigger and stronger than
to-day. With the two united in battle array agin me, I'd hev no
ch'ice but to take to the woods. Yes; we'll have to give up the
idea which sthruck me so favorable at first. What do ye intind
to do with the <em>Deerfoot</em>, Captain, when the summer is
gone?"</p>

<p>"Draw her out on land and cover her with canvas for the winter,
so as to keep her in condition for a bigger outing next year."</p>

<p>"That maans, I 'spose, ye'll carry her in the house and put her
to bed and kiver her up the same as a sick baby?"</p>

<p>"Hardly that, but she will need and will receive the best of
care&mdash;hark!"</p>

<p>The three were silent for a minute. Faintly but distinctly all
caught the distant whirr from the exhaust of a speed launch. They
quickly noted that the sound grew less audible&mdash;proof that the
launch was speeding away from them.</p>

<p>At first it seemed to be in the direction of Wiscasset, but when
they were barely able to hear the noise, they agreed that it was
from down the river. Inasmuch as they had not met any boat on
their way to this point, they were puzzled to understand how the
craft could have passed them without being seen. The only explanation
was that it had come nearly to the blockhouse from below, and
then owing to some cause had turned about and gone back.</p>

<p>"That's queer," remarked Alvin, as a sudden suspicion flashed
over him. He sprang to his feet and ran round the building, the
others at his heels, for the same dread was with them. In a moment
Alvin halted with the exclamation:</p>

<p>"Some one has run off with our launch!"</p>

<p>Such was the fact.</p>
