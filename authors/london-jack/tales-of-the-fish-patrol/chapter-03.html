<P>
Of the fish patrolmen under whom we served at various times,
Charley Le Grant and I were agreed, I think, that Neil Partington
was the best.  He was neither dishonest nor cowardly; and while he
demanded strict obedience when we were under his orders, at the
same time our relations were those of easy comradeship, and he
permitted us a freedom to which we were ordinarily unaccustomed, as
the present story will show.
<P>
Neil's family lived in Oakland, which is on the Lower Bay, not more
than six miles across the water from San Francisco.  One day, while
scouting among the Chinese shrimp-catchers of Point Pedro, he
received word that his wife was very ill; and within the hour the
Reindeer was bowling along for Oakland, with a stiff northwest
breeze astern.  We ran up the Oakland Estuary and came to anchor,
and in the days that followed, while Neil was ashore, we tightened
up the Reindeer's rigging, overhauled the ballast, scraped down,
and put the sloop into thorough shape.
<P>
This done, time hung heavy on our hands.  Neil's wife was
dangerously ill, and the outlook was a week's lie-over, awaiting
the crisis.  Charley and I roamed the docks, wondering what we
should do, and so came upon the oyster fleet lying at the Oakland
City Wharf.  In the main they were trim, natty boats, made for
speed and bad weather, and we sat down on the stringer-piece of the
dock to study them.
<P>
"A good catch, I guess," Charley said, pointing to the heaps of
oysters, assorted in three sizes, which lay upon their decks.
<P>
Pedlers were backing their wagons to the edge of the wharf, and
from the bargaining and chaffering that went on, I managed to learn
the selling price of the oysters.
<P>
"That boat must have at least two hundred dollars' worth aboard," I
calculated.  "I wonder how long it took to get the load?"
<P>
"Three or four days," Charley answered.  "Not bad wages for two men
- twenty-five dollars a day apiece."
<P>
The boat we were discussing, the Ghost, lay directly beneath us.
Two men composed its crew.  One was a squat, broad-shouldered
fellow with remarkably long and gorilla-like arms, while the other
was tall and well proportioned, with clear blue eyes and a mat of
straight black hair.  So unusual and striking was this combination
of hair and eyes that Charley and I remained somewhat longer than
we intended.
<P>
And it was well that we did.  A stout, elderly man, with the dress
and carriage of a successful merchant, came up and stood beside us,
looking down upon the deck of the Ghost.  He appeared angry, and
the longer he looked the angrier he grew.
<P>
"Those are my oysters," he said at last.  "I know they are my
oysters.  You raided my beds last night and robbed me of them."
<P>
The tall man and the short man on the Ghost looked up.
<P>
"Hello, Taft," the short man said, with insolent familiarity.
(Among the bayfarers he had gained the nickname of "The Centipede"
on account of his long arms.)  "Hello, Taft," he repeated, with the
same touch of insolence.  "Wot 'r you growling about now?"
<P>
"Those are my oysters - that's what I said.  You've stolen them
from my beds."
<P>
"Yer mighty wise, ain't ye?" was the Centipede's sneering reply.
"S'pose you can tell your oysters wherever you see 'em?"
<P>
"Now, in my experience," broke in the tall man, "oysters is oysters
wherever you find 'em, an' they're pretty much alike all the Bay
over, and the world over, too, for that matter.  We're not wantin'
to quarrel with you, Mr. Taft, but we jes' wish you wouldn't
insinuate that them oysters is yours an' that we're thieves an'
robbers till you can prove the goods."
<P>
"I know they're mine; I'd stake my life on it!" Mr. Taft snorted.
<P>
"Prove it," challenged the tall man, who we afterward learned was
known as "The Porpoise" because of his wonderful swimming
abilities.
<P>
Mr. Taft shrugged his shoulders helplessly.  Of course he could not
prove the oysters to be his, no matter how certain he might be.
<P>
"I'd give a thousand dollars to have you men behind the bars!" he
cried.  "I'll give fifty dollars a head for your arrest and
conviction, all of you!"
<P>
A roar of laughter went up from the different boats, for the rest
of the pirates had been listening to the discussion.
<P>
"There's more money in oysters," the Porpoise remarked dryly.
<P>
Mr. Taft turned impatiently on his heel and walked away.  From out
of the corner of his eye, Charley noted the way he went.  Several
minutes later, when he had disappeared around a corner, Charley
rose lazily to his feet.  I followed him, and we sauntered off in
the opposite direction to that taken by Mr. Taft.
<P>
"Come on!  Lively!" Charley whispered, when we passed from the view
of the oyster fleet.
<P>
Our course was changed at once, and we dodged around corners and
raced up and down side-streets till Mr. Taft's generous form loomed
up ahead of us.
<P>
"I'm going to interview him about that reward," Charley explained,
as we rapidly over-hauled the oyster-bed owner.  "Neil will be
delayed here for a week, and you and I might as well be doing
something in the meantime.  What do you say?"
<P>
"Of course, of course," Mr. Taft said, when Charley had introduced
himself and explained his errand.  "Those thieves are robbing me of
thousands of dollars every year, and I shall be glad to break them
up at any price, - yes, sir, at any price.  As I said, I'll give
fifty dollars a head, and call it cheap at that.  They've robbed my
beds, torn down my signs, terrorized my watchmen, and last year
killed one of them.  Couldn't prove it.  All done in the blackness
of night.  All I had was a dead watchman and no evidence.  The
detectives could do nothing.  Nobody has been able to do anything
with those men.  We have never succeeded in arresting one of them.
So I say, Mr. -  What did you say your name was?"
<P>
"Le Grant," Charley answered.
<P>
"So I say, Mr. Le Grant, I am deeply obliged to you for the
assistance you offer.  And I shall be glad, most glad, sir, to co-
operate with you in every way.  My watchmen and boats are at your
disposal.  Come and see me at the San Francisco offices any time,
or telephone at my expense.  And don't be afraid of spending money.
I'll foot your expenses, whatever they are, so long as they are
within reason.  The situation is growing desperate, and something
must be done to determine whether I or that band of ruffians own
those oyster beds."
<P>
"Now we'll see Neil," Charley said, when he had seen Mr. Taft upon
his train to San Francisco.
<P>
Not only did Neil Partington interpose no obstacle to our
adventure, but he proved to be of the greatest assistance.  Charley
and I knew nothing of the oyster industry, while his head was an
encyclopaedia of facts concerning it.  Also, within an hour or so,
he was able to bring to us a Greek boy of seventeen or eighteen who
knew thoroughly well the ins and outs of oyster piracy.
<P>
At this point I may as well explain that we of the fish patrol were
free lances in a way.  While Neil Partington, who was a patrolman
proper, received a regular salary, Charley and I, being merely
deputies, received only what we earned - that is to say, a certain
percentage of the fines imposed on convicted violators of the fish
laws.  Also, any rewards that chanced our way were ours.  We
offered to share with Partington whatever we should get from Mr.
Taft, but the patrolman would not hear of it.  He was only too
happy, he said, to do a good turn for us, who had done so many for
him.
<P>
We held a long council of war, and mapped out the following line of
action.  Our faces were unfamiliar on the Lower Bay, but as the
Reindeer was well known as a fish-patrol sloop, the Greek boy,
whose name was Nicholas, and I were to sail some innocent-looking
craft down to Asparagus Island and join the oyster pirates' fleet.
Here, according to Nicholas's description of the beds and the
manner of raiding, it was possible for us to catch the pirates in
the act of stealing oysters, and at the same time to get them in
our power.  Charley was to be on the shore, with Mr. Taft's
watchmen and a posse of constables, to help us at the right time.
<P>
"I know just the boat," Neil said, at the conclusion of the
discussion, "a crazy old sloop that's lying over at Tiburon.  You
and Nicholas can go over by the ferry, charter it for a song, and
sail direct for the beds."
<P>
"Good luck be with you, boys," he said at parting, two days later.
"Remember, they are dangerous men, so be careful."
<P>
Nicholas and I succeeded in chartering the sloop very cheaply; and
between laughs, while getting up sail, we agreed that she was even
crazier and older than she had been described.  She was a big,
flat-bottomed, square-sterned craft, sloop-rigged, with a sprung
mast, slack rigging, dilapidated sails, and rotten running-gear,
clumsy to handle and uncertain in bringing about, and she smelled
vilely of coal tar, with which strange stuff she had been smeared
from stem to stern and from cabin-roof to centreboard.  And to cap
it all, Coal Tar Maggie was printed in great white letters the
whole length of either side.
<P>
It was an uneventful though laughable run from Tiburon to Asparagus
Island, where we arrived in the afternoon of the following day.
The oyster pirates, a fleet of a dozen sloops, were lying at anchor
on what was known as the "Deserted Beds."  The Coal Tar Maggie came
sloshing into their midst with a light breeze astern, and they
crowded on deck to see us.  Nicholas and I had caught the spirit of
the crazy craft, and we handled her in most lubberly fashion.
<P>
"Wot is it?" some one called.
<P>
"Name it 'n' ye kin have it!" called another.
<P>
"I swan naow, ef it ain't the old Ark itself!" mimicked the
Centipede from the deck of the Ghost.
<P>
"Hey!  Ahoy there, clipper ship!" another wag shouted.  "Wot's yer
port?"
<P>
We took no notice of the joking, but acted, after the manner of
greenhorns, as though the Coal Tar Maggie required our undivided
attention.  I rounded her well to windward of the Ghost, and
Nicholas ran for'ard to drop the anchor.  To all appearances it was
a bungle, the way the chain tangled and kept the anchor from
reaching the bottom.  And to all appearances Nicholas and I were
terribly excited as we strove to clear it.  At any rate, we quite
deceived the pirates, who took huge delight in our predicament.
<P>
But the chain remained tangled, and amid all kinds of mocking
advice we drifted down upon and fouled the Ghost, whose bowsprit
poked square through our mainsail and ripped a hole in it as big as
a barn door.  The Centipede and the Porpoise doubled up on the
cabin in paroxysms of laughter, and left us to get clear as best we
could.  This, with much unseaman-like performance, we succeeded in
doing, and likewise in clearing the anchor-chain, of which we let
out about three hundred feet.  With only ten feet of water under
us, this would permit the Coal Tar Maggie to swing in a circle six
hundred feet in diameter, in which circle she would be able to foul
at least half the fleet.
<P>
The oyster pirates lay snugly together at short hawsers, the
weather being fine, and they protested loudly at our ignorance in
putting out such an unwarranted length of anchor-chain.  And not
only did they protest, for they made us heave it in again, all but
thirty feet.
<P>
Having sufficiently impressed them with our general lubberliness,
Nicholas and I went below to congratulate ourselves and to cook
supper.  Hardly had we finished the meal and washed the dishes,
when a skiff ground against the Coal Tar Maggie's side, and heavy
feet trampled on deck.  Then the Centipede's brutal face appeared
in the companionway, and he descended into the cabin, followed by
the Porpoise.  Before they could seat themselves on a bunk, another
skiff came alongside, and another, and another, till the whole
fleet was represented by the gathering in the cabin.
<P>
"Where'd you swipe the old tub?" asked a squat and hairy man, with
cruel eyes and Mexican features.
<P>
"Didn't swipe it," Nicholas answered, meeting them on their own
ground and encouraging the idea that we had stolen the Coal Tar
Maggie.  "And if we did, what of it?"
<P>
"Well, I don't admire your taste, that's all," sneered he of the
Mexican features.  "I'd rot on the beach first before I'd take a
tub that couldn't get out of its own way."
<P>
"How were we to know till we tried her?" Nicholas asked, so
innocently as to cause a laugh.  "And how do you get the oysters?"
he hurried on.  "We want a load of them; that's what we came for, a
load of oysters."
<P>
"What d'ye want 'em for?" demanded the Porpoise.
<P>
"Oh, to give away to our friends, of course," Nicholas retorted.
"That's what you do with yours, I suppose."
<P>
This started another laugh, and as our visitors grew more genial we
could see that they had not the slightest suspicion of our identity
or purpose.
<P>
"Didn't I see you on the dock in Oakland the other day?" the
Centipede asked suddenly of me.
<P>
"Yep," I answered boldly, taking the bull by the horns.  "I was
watching you fellows and figuring out whether we'd go oystering or
not.  It's a pretty good business, I calculate, and so we're going
in for it.  That is," I hastened to add, "if you fellows don't
mind."
<P>
"I'll tell you one thing, which ain't two things," he replied, "and
that is you'll have to hump yerself an' get a better boat.  We
won't stand to be disgraced by any such box as this.  Understand?"
<P>
"Sure," I said.  "Soon as we sell some oysters we'll outfit in
style."
<P>
"And if you show yerself square an' the right sort," he went on,
"why, you kin run with us.  But if you don't" (here his voice
became stern and menacing), "why, it'll be the sickest day of yer
life.  Understand?"
<P>
"Sure," I said.
<P>
After that and more warning and advice of similar nature, the
conversation became general, and we learned that the beds were to
be raided that very night.  As they got into their boats, after an
hour's stay, we were invited to join them in the raid with the
assurance of "the more the merrier."
<P>
"Did you notice that short, Mexican-looking chap?" Nicholas asked,
when they had departed to their various sloops.  "He's Barchi, of
the Sporting Life Gang, and the fellow that came with him is
Skilling.  They're both out now on five thousand dollars' bail."
<P>
I had heard of the Sporting Life Gang before, a crowd of hoodlums
and criminals that terrorized the lower quarters of Oakland, and
two-thirds of which were usually to be found in state's prison for
crimes that ranged from perjury and ballot-box stuffing to murder.
<P>
"They are not regular oyster pirates," Nicholas continued.
"They've just come down for the lark and to make a few dollars.
But we'll have to watch out for them."
<P>
We sat in the cockpit and discussed the details of our plan till
eleven o'clock had passed, when we heard the rattle of an oar in a
boat from the direction of the Ghost.  We hauled up our own skiff,
tossed in a few sacks, and rowed over.  There we found all the
skiffs assembling, it being the intention to raid the beds in a
body.
<P>
To my surprise, I found barely a foot of water where we had dropped
anchor in ten feet.  It was the big June run-out of the full moon,
and as the ebb had yet an hour and a half to run, I knew that our
anchorage would be dry ground before slack water.
<P>
Mr. Taft's beds were three miles away, and for a long time we rowed
silently in the wake of the other boats, once in a while grounding
and our oar blades constantly striking bottom.  At last we came
upon soft mud covered with not more than two inches of water - not
enough to float the boats.  But the pirates at once were over the
side, and by pushing and pulling on the flat-bottomed skiffs, we
moved steadily along.
<P>
The full moon was partly obscured by high-flying clouds, but the
pirates went their way with the familiarity born of long practice.
After half a mile of the mud, we came upon a deep channel, up which
we rowed, with dead oyster shoals looming high and dry on either
side.  At last we reached the picking grounds.  Two men, on one of
the shoals, hailed us and warned us off.  But the Centipede, the
Porpoise, Barchi, and Skilling took the lead, and followed by the
rest of us, at least thirty men in half as many boats, rowed right
up to the watchmen.
<P>
"You'd better slide outa this here," Barchi said threateningly, "or
we'll fill you so full of holes you wouldn't float in molasses."
<P>
The watchmen wisely retreated before so overwhelming a force, and
rowed their boat along the channel toward where the shore should
be.  Besides, it was in the plan for them to retreat.
<P>
We hauled the noses of the boats up on the shore side of a big
shoal, and all hands, with sacks, spread out and began picking.
Every now and again the clouds thinned before the face of the moon,
and we could see the big oysters quite distinctly.  In almost no
time sacks were filled and carried back to the boats, where fresh
ones were obtained.  Nicholas and I returned often and anxiously to
the boats with our little loads, but always found some one of the
pirates coming or going.
<P>
"Never mind," he said; "no hurry.  As they pick farther and farther
away, it will take too long to carry to the boats.  Then they'll
stand the full sacks on end and pick them up when the tide comes in
and the skiffs will float to them."
<P>
Fully half an hour went by, and the tide had begun to flood, when
this came to pass.  Leaving the pirates at their work, we stole
back to the boats.  One by one, and noiselessly, we shoved them off
and made them fast in an awkward flotilla.  Just as we were shoving
off the last skiff, our own, one of the men came upon us.  It was
Barchi.  His quick eye took in the situation at a glance, and he
sprang for us; but we went clear with a mighty shove, and he was
left floundering in the water over his head.  As soon as he got
back to the shoal he raised his voice and gave the alarm.
<P>
We rowed with all our strength, but it was slow going with so many
boats in tow.  A pistol cracked from the shoal, a second, and a
third; then a regular fusillade began.  The bullets spat and spat
all about us; but thick clouds had covered the moon, and in the dim
darkness it was no more than random firing.  It was only by chance
that we could be hit.
<P>
"Wish we had a little steam launch," I panted.
<P>
"I'd just as soon the moon stayed hidden," Nicholas panted back.
<P>
It was slow work, but every stroke carried us farther away from the
shoal and nearer the shore, till at last the shooting died down,
and when the moon did come out we were too far away to be in
danger.  Not long afterward we answered a shoreward hail, and two
Whitehall boats, each pulled by three pairs of oars, darted up to
us.  Charley's welcome face bent over to us, and he gripped us by
the hands while he cried, "Oh, you joys!  You joys!  Both of you!"
<P>
When the flotilla had been landed, Nicholas and I and a watchman
rowed out in one of the Whitehalls, with Charley in the stern-
sheets.  Two other Whitehalls followed us, and as the moon now
shone brightly, we easily made out the oyster pirates on their
lonely shoal.  As we drew closer, they fired a rattling volley from
their revolvers, and we promptly retreated beyond range.
<P>
"Lot of time," Charley said.  "The flood is setting in fast, and by
the time it's up to their necks there won't be any fight left in
them."
<P>
So we lay on our oars and waited for the tide to do its work.  This
was the predicament of the pirates:  because of the big run-out,
the tide was now rushing back like a mill-race, and it was
impossible for the strongest swimmer in the world to make against
it the three miles to the sloops.  Between the pirates and the
shore were we, precluding escape in that direction.  On the other
hand, the water was rising rapidly over the shoals, and it was only
a question of a few hours when it would be over their heads.
<P>
It was beautifully calm, and in the brilliant white moonlight we
watched them through our night glasses and told Charley of the
voyage of the Coal Tar Maggie.  One o'clock came, and two o'clock,
and the pirates were clustering on the highest shoal, waist-deep in
water.
<P>
"Now this illustrates the value of imagination," Charley was
saying.  "Taft has been trying for years to get them, but he went
at it with bull strength and failed.  Now we used our heads . . ."
<P>
Just then I heard a scarcely audible gurgle of water, and holding
up my hand for silence, I turned and pointed to a ripple slowly
widening out in a growing circle.  It was not more than fifty feet
from us.  We kept perfectly quiet and waited.  After a minute the
water broke six feet away, and a black head and white shoulder
showed in the moonlight.  With a snort of surprise and of suddenly
expelled breath, the head and shoulder went down.
<P>
We pulled ahead several strokes and drifted with the current.  Four
pairs of eyes searched the surface of the water, but never another
ripple showed, and never another glimpse did we catch of the black
head and white shoulder.
<P>
"It's the Porpoise," Nicholas said.  "It would take broad daylight
for us to catch him."
<P>
At a quarter to three the pirates gave their first sign of
weakening.  We heard cries for help, in the unmistakable voice of
the Centipede, and this time, on rowing closer, we were not fired
upon.  The Centipede was in a truly perilous plight.  Only the
heads and shoulders of his fellow-marauders showed above the water
as they braced themselves against the current, while his feet were
off the bottom and they were supporting him.
<P>
"Now, lads," Charley said briskly, "we have got you, and you can't
get away.  If you cut up rough, we'll have to leave you alone and
the water will finish you.  But if you're good we'll take you
aboard, one man at a time, and you'll all be saved.  What do you
say?"
<P>
"Ay," they chorused hoarsely between their chattering teeth.
<P>
"Then one man at a time, and the short men first."
<P>
The Centipede was the first to be pulled aboard, and he came
willingly, though he objected when the constable put the handcuffs
on him.  Barchi was next hauled in, quite meek and resigned from
his soaking.  When we had ten in, our boat we drew back, and the
second Whitehall was loaded.  The third Whitehall received nine
prisoners only - a catch of twenty-nine in all.
<P>
"You didn't get the Porpoise," the Centipede said exultantly, as
though his escape materially diminished our success.
<P>
Charley laughed.  "But we saw him just the same, a-snorting for
shore like a puffing pig."
<P>
It was a mild and shivering band of pirates that we marched up the
beach to the oyster house.  In answer to Charley's knock, the door
was flung open, and a pleasant wave of warm air rushed out upon us.
<P>
"You can dry your clothes here, lads, and get some hot coffee,"
Charley announced, as they filed in.
<P>
And there, sitting ruefully by the fire, with a steaming mug in his
hand, was the Porpoise.  With one accord Nicholas and I looked at
Charley.  He laughed gleefully.
<P>
"That comes of imagination," he said.  "When you see a thing,
you've got to see it all around, or what's the good of seeing it at
all?  I saw the beach, so I left a couple of constables behind to
keep an eye on it.  That's all."
