<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The steamer <em>Polynesia</em> was steaming swiftly across the
Pacific, in the direction of Japan&mdash;bravely plunging out into
the mightiest expanse of water which spans the globe, and heading
for the port that loomed up from the ocean almost ten thousand
miles away.</p>

<p>Although but a few days out, little Inez had become the pet of
the whole ship. She was full of high spirits, bounding health&mdash;a
laughing, merry sprite, who made every portion of the steamer
her home, and who was welcome wherever she went.</p>

<p>To the bronzed and rugged Captain Strathmore she was such a reminder
of his own lost Inez that she became a second daughter to him,
and something like a pang stirred his heart when he reflected
upon his arrival at his destination and his parting from the little
one.</p>

<p>Inez, as nearly as the captain could gather, had been living
for several years with her uncle and aunt in San Francisco, from
which port her parents had sailed a considerable time before.
The stranger gave a very common name as his own &mdash;George
Smith&mdash;and said he would await the return of the <em>Polynesia</em>
with great anxiety, in order to learn the particulars of the arrival
of his niece in Japan.</p>

<p>However, the captain did not allow his mind to be annoyed by
any speculations as to the past of the little girl; but he could
not avoid a strong yearning which was growing in his heart that
something would turn up&mdash;something possibly in the shape of a
social revolution or earthquake&mdash;that would place the little girl
in his possession again.</p>

<p>And yet he trembled as he muttered the wish.</p>

<p>"How long would I keep her? I had such a girl once&mdash;her very
counterpart&mdash;the sweet Inez, my own; and yet she is gone, and
who shall say how long this one shall be mine?"</p>

<p>The weather remained all that could be wished for a number of
days after steaming out of the Golden Gate. It was in the month
of September, when a mild, dreamy languor seemed to rest upon
everything, and the passage across the Pacific was like one long-continued
dream of the Orient&mdash;excepting, perhaps, when the cyclone or hurricane,
roused from its sleep, swept over the deep with a fury such as
strews the shores with wrecks and the bottom with multitudes of
bodies.</p>

<p>What more beautiful than a moonlight night on the Pacific?</p>

<p>The <em>Polynesia</em> was plowing the vast waste of waters which
separates the two worlds, bearing upon her decks and in her cabins
passengers from the four quarters of the globe.</p>

<p>They came from, and were going to, every portion of the wide
world. Some were speeding toward their homes in Asia or Africa
or the islands of the sea; and others living in Europe or America,
or the remote corners of the earth, would finally return, after
wandering over strange places, seeing singular sights, and treading
in the footsteps of the armies who had gone before them in the
dim ages of the past.</p>

<p>Now and then the great ship rose from some mighty swell, and
then, settling down, drove ahead, cleaving the calm water and
leaving a wide wake of foam behind. The black smoke poured out
of the broad funnels, and sifted upward through the scant rigging,
and was dissipated in the clear air above. The throbbing of the
engine made its pulsations felt through the ponderous craft from
stem to stern, as a giant breathes more powerfully when gathering
his energy for the final effort of the race. A few drifting clouds
moved along the sky, while, now and then, a starlike point of
light, far away against the horizon, showed where some other caravansary
of the sea was moving toward its destination, thousands of leagues
away.</p>

<p>Although Captain Strathmore was on duty, and it was against the
rules for any passenger to approach or address him, yet there
was one who was unrestrained by rules or regulations, no matter
how sternly they were enforced in other cases.</p>

<p>The captain was standing on the bridge, when he felt some one
tugging at his coat, and he looked down.</p>

<p>There was Inez demanding his attention.</p>

<p>"Take me up, pop," said she.</p>

<p>"Bless your heart!" laughed the captain as he obeyed the little
empress; "you would ruin the discipline of a man-of-war in a month."</p>

<p>While speaking, he perched her on his shoulder, as was a favorite
custom with him.</p>

<p>The day had been unusually warm, and the night was so mild that
the steady breeze made by the motion of the steamer was scarcely
sufficient to keep one cool. Little Inez had thrown aside her
hat with the setting of the sun, and now her wealth of golden
hair streamed and fluttered in fleecy masses about her shoulders.</p>

<p>The steamer was plowing straight to the westward, cutting the
waves so keenly that a thin parabola of water continually curved
over in front of her from the knife-like prow.</p>

<p>Perched aloft on the shoulder of the captain, Inez naturally
gazed ahead, and the figure was a striking one of innocence and
infancy peering forward through the mists and clouds toward the
unknown future. But Inez was too young to have any such poetical
thoughts, and the captain was too practical to be troubled by
"Ã¦sthetic meditations."</p>

<p>He chatted with her about their arrival in Japan, saying that
she would be glad to see no more of him, when she replied:</p>

<p>"If you talk that way, I'll cry. You must go home and live with
us. Uncle Con says papa has a big dog, and if we haven't room
in the house, you can sleep with him, and I'll feed you each morning&mdash;oh,
look!"</p>
