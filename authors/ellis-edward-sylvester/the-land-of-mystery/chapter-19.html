<p>The explorers, bearing the canoe with the luggage upon their
shoulders, ascended at a steady gait the western bank of the Xingu. 
The cleared space which they had noticed on both sides of the
river, caused by the furious overflow, continued, so that the
progress was comparatively easy.</p>

<p>The din of the rapids was so loud that they could not have heard
each other, except by shouting at the top of their voices, for
which there was no call, since even Bippo and Pedros were now
able to read the full meaning of the extraordinary incidents of
the night.</p>

<p>Ashman looked around and ascertained that Ziffak was not bearing
them company.  None of the savages were in sight, though all would
have been as eager as tigers to rend the white men to shreds had
such permission been given.</p>

<p>The absence of the great leader caused no uneasiness on the part
of any one of our friends.  Strange indeed, would it have been
had they felt any distrust of him after his late interference.</p>

<p>The sun appeared while the party were still pushing forward. 
The sky was as clear as on the preceding day, and, though the
temperature was quite warm, it was not unpleasantly so.  Several
causes contributed to the delightful coolness which renders the
Matto Grosso one of the most attractive regions on the globe. 
The abundance of water, the endless stretch of forest, with few
llanos of any extent, and, above all, the elevation of the plateau
produce a moderation of temperature not met with in the lowlands,
less than twenty degrees further south.</p>

<p>But the explorers were weary and in need of rest.  It will be
recalled that they found precious little opportunity for sleep
during the preceding night, which marked the close of an unusually
hard day's labor.  They would have rested could they have done
so, and now that the chance seemed to present itself, they wisely
decided to wait a few hours before beginning the last stretch
of water which lay between them and the villages of the Murhapas.</p>

<p>The halt was made at the top of the rapids, where the boat was
carefully replaced in the river, the fracture made by Ziffak's
javelin repaired, and everything adjusted for the resumption of
their voyage. Then, with only the Professor on guard, the others
lay down on their blankets and almost immediately sank into a
deep, refreshing slumber.</p>

<p>Professor Grimcke, finding the care of the camp on his hands,
took a careful survey of his surroundings, which were quite similar
to those that had enclosed him many times before.</p>

<p>On both sides, stretched the almost endless Brazilian forest,
within which a traveller might wander for weeks and months without
coming upon any openings.  In front was the Xingu, smooth, swift,
and winding through the wilderness in such form that he could
see only a short distance up stream.  Looking in the opposite
direction, the agitation of the water was noticeable before breaking
into rapids, similar, though in a less degree, to the rapids above
Niagara Falls.  The volume still preserved its remarkable purity
and clearness, which enabled him to trace the shelving bottom
a long way from where he stood.</p>

<p>Grimcke was somewhat of a philosopher, and always eager to make
the best use of the time at his command.  There was nothing more
to be feared from the Aryks, and his situation, therefore, of
guardian of his sleeping friends might be considered a sinecure.</p>

<p>His fishing line was soon arranged, and with some of the dried
meat he had brought along serving for bait, he began piscatorial
operations.</p>

<p>It will strike the reader as incredible, but in Borne portions
of the Orinoco and other tropical rivers of South America, the
fish are so abundant that they have been known to impede the progress
of large vessels moving through the waters.  While no such overflowing
supply is found in the Xingu, yet they were so numerous that it
required but a few minutes for the Professor to haul in more than
enough to furnish the entire party with all they could eat at
a single meal.</p>

<p>His next step was to start a fire, and prepare the coals for
broiling. This was a simple task, and was completed before his
friends finished their naps.</p>

<p>No pleasanter awakening could have come to them than that of
opening their eyes and finding their breakfast awaiting their
keen appetites. They fell to with a will, and, though saddened
by the loss of two of their number, were filled with a strange
delight at the prospect of their visit to the enchanted land.</p>

<p>The boat was launched, but there was not enough wind to make
it worth while to spread the sail, which had often proven of such
assistance, but the four pairs of arms swung the paddles with
a vigor that sent the craft swiftly against the current.  The
Professor disposed of himself in the boat so that he slept while
the others were at work.</p>

<p>Naturally the craft was kept as close to the bank as possible,
so as to gain the benefit of the sluggish current.  The trees
having been swept from the margin of the Xingu, an open space
was before the explorers throughout the entire distance.</p>

<p>Despite the glowing expectations of the party, there was enough
in the prospect before them to cause serious thought.  Long and
Ashman consulted continually and saw that it would not do to felicitate
themselves with the belief that all danger was at an end.</p>

<p>Two facts must be well weighed.  Waggaman and Burkhardt were
inimical to them.  Whether they could be won over even to neutrality
could not be determined until they were seen.  For the present
they must be classed as dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>Was it unreasonable to suspect that their influence with the
terrible King Haffgo would prove superior to that of Ziffak? 
If so, what hope was there of the escape of the explorers after
once intrusting themselves within the power of the tyrant?</p>

<p>But the immediate question which faced our friends was, whether
it would do for them to reveal themselves to the Murhapas without
again seeing their native friend.  They deemed it probable that
he had pushed on to the village, with the expectation of reaching
it ahead of them and thus preparing the way for their reception.</p>

<p>This, however, was but a pretty theory which was as liable to
be wrong as right.  At any rate, Ziffak must reach his home ahead
of or simultaneously with the whites.  The latter continued using
their paddles with steady vigor, until near noon, when they knew
that considerably more than half the distance was passed.</p>

<p>They now began swaying their paddles less powerfully, for the
feeling was strong upon them that they had approached as close
as was prudent to the Murhapa village.</p>

<p>It was about this time, that they rounded a bend in the Xingu
which gave them sight of the river for fully half a mile before
another change in its course shut out all view.  Naturally, they
scanned the stream in quest of enemies, who were now likely to
be quite close.</p>

<p>The first survey showed them a canoe coming down stream.  It
was near the middle and was approaching at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Fred Ashman laid down his paddle and took up his binocular.</p>

<p>"It is Ziffak!" he exclaimed, passing the glass to Long.</p>

<p>"So it is and he is alone," was the reply of the astonished New
Englander, who added an exclamation of surprise that he should
be approaching from that direction.  The only explanation was,
that since last seeing him, he had made a journey to his home
and was now returning to meet and convoy his friends to his own
people.</p>

<p>Such proved to be the case, as he explained on joining them.</p>

<p>After the affair at the foot of the rapids, he paused long enough
to make clear to the Aryks that not one of them was to make another
offensive movement against the whites under penalty of the most
fearful punishment.  He explained that these particular white
men were the friends of all natives, and that they never would
have harmed an Aryk had they not been forced to do so to save
their own lives.</p>

<p>The cunning Ziffak dropped a hint that the newcomers were much
better persons than the couple that had made their homes among
the Murhapas for so many years.  Then, having completed his business
in that line, he struck through the forest at a high rate of speed
and soon reached his own people.</p>

<p>He expected to find Waggaman and Burkhardt there, but they had
not yet arrived.  He explained to his brother the king what had
taken place at the rapids of the Xingu and succeeded in gaining
his promise of the king that he would allow the white men to enter
the village without the sacrifice of their lives; but he was not
willing that they should remain more than a couple of days.  Indeed
he gave such assent grudgingly and probably would have refused
it altogether, but for the earnest pleading of his beloved Ariel,
who insisted that it would be a partial recompense of the crime
of three years previous.</p>

<p>This was the best that Ziffak, with all his influence at court
could do, and indeed it was as much as he expected to accomplish. 
He admitted that Waggaman and Burkhardt were likely to interfere,
but he did not believe they could do so to any serious extent,
provided the white men themselves were circumspect in their behavior.</p>

<p>While this interesting interchange was going on, the two boats
were side by side, so gently impelled that their progress was
moderate and conversation pleasant.  Thinking that the Professor
had slept long enough, and that he ought to know the news, Fred
Ashman turned to wake him; but to his surprise, the German met
his look with a smile and the remark that he had heard every word
spoken.  Then he rose to a sitting posture, saluted Ziffak and
proceeded to light his pipe.</p>

<p>The latter pleased the whites still further by explaining that
he meant to keep them company for the rest of the distance.  Despite
his encouraging statements, they felt much easier with him as
their escort.</p>

<p>By using their paddles with moderate vigor, they could reach
their destination by the middle of the afternoon.  There was no
better hour to arrive, for the king was always in his best mood
after enjoying his siesta, which was always completed by the time
the sun was half-way down the sky.</p>

<p>It was to be expected also that before that hour, Waggaman and
Burkhardt would spread the news of the expected coming of the
wonderful strangers.  They would do what they could, to excite
distrust and enmity, but Ziffak was positive that since his brother
had given his promise, it would be sacredly kept, and that for
two days at least their stay at the village would be without peril
to any one of the little company.</p>
