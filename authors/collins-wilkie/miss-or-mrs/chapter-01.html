Period: THE PRESENT TIME.  Place: ENGLAND
<P>
The night had come to an end. The new-born day waited for its
quickening light in the silence that is never known on land--the
silence before sunrise, in a calm at sea.
<P>
Not a breath came from the dead air. Not a ripple stirred on the
motionless water. Nothing changed but the softly-growing light;
nothing moved but the lazy mist, curling up to meet the sun, its
master, on the eastward sea. By fine gradations, the airy veil of
morning thinned in substance as it rose--thinned, till there
dawned through it in the first rays of sunlight the tall white
sails of a Schooner Yacht.
<P>
From stem to stern silence possessed the vessel--as silence
possessed the sea.
<P>
But one living creature was on deck--the man at the helm, dozing
peaceably with his arm over the useless tiller. Minute by minute
the light grew, and the heat grew with it; and still the helmsman
slumbered, the heavy sails hung noiseless, the quiet water lay
sleeping against the vessel's sides. The whole orb of the sun was
visible above the water-line, when the first sound pierced its
way through the morning silence. From far off over the shining
white ocean, the cry of a sea-bird reached the yacht on a sudden
out of the last airy circles of the waning mist.
<P>
The sleeper at the helm woke; looked up at the idle sails, and
yawned in sympathy with them; looked out at the sea on either
side of him, and shook his head obstinately at the superior
obstinacy of the calm.
<P>
"Blow, my little breeze!" said the man, whistling the sailor's
invocation to the wind softly between his teeth. "Blow, my little
breeze!"
<P>
"How's her head?" cried a bold and brassy voice, hailing the deck
from the cabin staircase.
<P>
"Anywhere you like, master; all round the compass."
<P>
The voice was followed by the man. The owner of the yacht
appeared on deck.
<P>
Behold Richard Turlington, Esq., of the great Levant firm of
Pizzituti, Turlington & Branca! Aged eight-and-thirty; standing
stiffly and sturdily at a height of not more than five feet six--
Mr. Turlington presented to the view of his fellow-creatures a
face of the perpendicular order of human architecture. His
forehead was a straight line, his upper lip was another, his chin
was the straightest and the longest line of all. As he turned his
swarthy countenance eastward, and shaded his light gray eyes from
the sun, his knotty hand plainly revealed that it had got him his
living by its own labor at one time or another in his life. Taken
on the whole, this was a man whom it might be easy to respect,
but whom it would be hard to love. Better company at the official
desk than at the social table. Morally and physically--if the
expression may be permitted--a man without a bend in him.
<P>
"A calm yesterday," grumbled Richard Turlington, looking with
stubborn deliberation all round him. "And a calm to-day. Ha! next
season I'll have the vessel fitted with engines. I hate this!"
<P>
"Think of the filthy coals, and the infernal vibration, and leave
your beautiful schooner as she is. We are out for a holiday. Let
the wind and the sea take a holiday too."
<P>
Pronouncing those words of remonstrance, a slim, nimble, curly-
headed young gentleman joined Richard Turlington on deck, with
his clothes under his arm, his towels in his hand, and nothing on
him but the night-gown in which he had stepped out of his bed.
<P>
"Launcelot Linzie, you have been received on board my vessel in
the capacity of medical attendant on Miss Natalie Graybrooke, at
her father's request. Keep your place, if you please. When I want
your advice, I'll ask you for it." Answering in those terms, the
elder man fixed his colorless gray eyes on the younger with an
expression which added plainly, "There won't be room enough in
this schooner much longer for me and for you."
<P>
Launcelot Linzie had his reasons (apparently) for declining to
let his host offend him on any terms whatever.
<P>
"Thank you!" he rejoined, in a tone of satirical good humor. "It
isn't easy to keep my place on board your vessel. I can't help
presuming to enjoy myself as if I was the owner. The life is such
a new one--to _me!&gt;/I&gt; It's so delightfully easy, for instance,
to wash yourself here. On shore it's a complicated question of
jugs and basins and tubs; one is always in danger of breaking
something, or spoiling something. Here you have only to jump out
of bed, to run up on deck, and to do this!"
<P>
He turned, and scampered to the bows of the vessel. In one
instant he was out of his night-gown, in another he was on the
bulwark, in a third he was gamboling luxuriously in sixty fathoms
of salt-water.
<P>
Turlington's eyes followed him with a reluctant, uneasy attention
as he swam round the vessel, the only moving object in view.
Turlington's mind, steady and slow in all its operations, set him
a problem to be solved, on given conditions, as follows:
<P>
"Launcelot Linzie is fifteen years younger than I am. Add to
that, Launcelot Linzie is Natalie Graybrooke's cousin. Given
those two advantages--Query: Has he taken Natalie's fancy?"
<P>
Turning that question slowly over and over in his mind, Richard
Turlington seated himself in a corner at the stern of the vessel.
He was still at work on the problem, when the young surgeon
returned to his cabin to put the finishing touches to his toilet.
He had not reached the solution when the steward appeared an hour
later and said, "Breakfast is ready, sir!"
<P>
They were a party of five round the cabin table.
<P>
First, Sir Joseph Graybrooke. Inheritor of a handsome fortune
made by his father and his grandfather in trade. Mayor, twice
elected, of a thriving provincial town. Officially privileged,
while holding that dignity, to hand a silver trowel to a royal
personage condescending to lay a first stone of a charitable
edifice. Knighted, accordingly, in honor of the occasion. Worthy
of the honor and worthy of the occasion. A type of his eminently
respectable class. Possessed of an amiable, rosy face, and soft,
silky white hair. Sound in his principles; tidy in his dress;
blessed with moderate politics and a good digestion--a harmless,
healthy, spruce, speckless, weak-minded old man.
<P>
Secondly, Miss Lavinia Graybrooke, Sir Joseph's maiden sister.
Personally, Sir Joseph in petticoats. If you knew one you knew
the other.
<P>
Thirdly, Miss Natalie Graybrooke--Sir Joseph's only child.
<P>
She had inherited the personal appearance and the temperament of
her mother--dead many years since. There had been a mixture of
Negro blood and French blood in the late Lady Graybrooke's
family, settled originally in Martinique. Natalie had her
mother's warm dusky color, her mother's superb black hair, and
her mother's melting, lazy, lovely brown eyes. At fifteen years
of age (dating from her last birthday) she possessed the
development of the bosom and limbs which in England is rarely
attained before twenty. Everything about the girl--except her
little rosy ears--was on a grand Amazonian scale. Her shapely
hand was long and large; her supple waist was the waist of a
woman. The indolent grace of all her movements had its motive
power in an almost masculine firmness of action and profusion of
physical resource. This remarkable bodily development was far
from being accompanied by any corresponding development of
character. Natalie's manner was the gentle, innocent manner of a
young girl. She had her father's sweet temper ingrafted on her
mother's variable Southern nature. She moved like a goddess, and
she laughed like a child. Signs of maturing too rapidly--of
outgrowing her strength, as the phr ase went--had made their
appearance in Sir Joseph's daughter during the spring. The family
doctor had suggested a sea-voyage, as a wise manner of employing
the fine summer months. Richard Turlington's yacht was placed at
her disposal, with Richard Turlington himself included as one of
the fixtures of the vessel. With her father and her aunt to keep
up round her the atmosphere of home--with Cousin Launcelot (more
commonly known as "Launce") to carry out, if necessary, the
medical treatment prescribed by superior authority on shore--the
lovely invalid embarked on her summer cruise, and sprang up into
a new existence in the life-giving breezes of the sea. After two
happy months of lazy coasting round the shores of England, all
that remained of Natalie's illness was represented by a delicious
languor in her eyes, and an utter inability to devote herself to
anything which took the shape of a serious occupation. As she sat
at the cabin breakfast-table that morning, in her quaintly-made
sailing dress of old-fashioned nankeen--her inbred childishness
of manner contrasting delightfully with the blooming maturity of
her form--the man must have been trebly armed indeed in the
modern philosophy who could have denied that the first of a
woman's rights is the right of being beautiful; and the foremost
of a woman's merits, the merit of being young!
<P>
The other two persons present at the table were the two gentlemen
who have already appeared on the deck of the yacht.
<P>
"Not a breath of wind stirring!" said Richard Turlington. "The
weather has got a grudge against us. We have drifted about four
or five miles in the last eight-and-forty hours. You will never
take another cruise with me--you must be longing to get on
shore."
<P>
He addressed himself to Natalie; plainly eager to make himself
agreeable to the young lady--and plainly unsuccessful in
producing any impression on her. She made a civil answer; and
looked at her tea-cup, instead of looking at Richard Turlington.
<P>
"You might fancy yourself on shore at this moment," said Launce.
"The vessel is as steady as a house, and the swing-table we are
eating our breakfast on is as even as your dining-room table at
home."
<P>
He too addressed himself to Natalie, but without betraying the
anxiety to please her which had been shown by the other. For all
that, _he_ diverted the girl's attention from her tea-cup; and
_his_ idea instantly awakened a responsive idea in Natalie's
mind.
<P>
"It will be so strange on shore," she said, "to find myself in a
room that never turns on one side, and to sit at a table that
never tilts down to my knees at one time, or rises up to my chin
at another. How I shall miss the wash of the water at my ear, and
the ring of the bell on deck. when I am awake at night on land!
No interest there in how the wind blows, or how the sails are
set. No asking your way of the sun, when you are lost, with a
little brass instrument and a morsel of pencil and paper. No
delightful wandering wherever the wind takes you, without the
worry of planning beforehand where you are to go. Oh how I shall
miss the dear, changeable, inconstant sea! And how sorry I am I'm
not a man and a sailor!"
<P>
This to the guest admitted on board on sufferance, and not one
word of it addressed, even by chance, to the owner of the yacht!
<P>
Richard Turlington's heavy eyebrows contracted with an
unmistakable expression of pain.
<P>
"If this calm weather holds," he went on, addressing himself to
Sir Joseph, "I am afraid, Graybrooke, I shall not be able to
bring you back to the port we sailed from by the end of the
week."
<P>
"Whenever you like, Richard," answered the old gentleman,
resignedly. "Any time will do for me."
<P>
"Any time within reasonable limits, Joseph," said Miss Lavinia,
evidently feeling that her brother was conceding too much. She
spoke with Sir Joseph's amiable smile and Sir Joseph's softly-
pitched voice. Two twin babies could hardly have been more like
one another.
<P>
While these few words were being exchanged among the elders, a
private communication was in course of progress between the two
young people under the cabin table. Natalie's smartly-slippered
foot felt its way cautiously inch by inch over the carpet till it
touched Launce's boot. Launce, devouring his breakfast, instantly
looked up from his plate, and then, at a second touch from
Natalie, looked down again in a violent hurry. After pausing to
make sure that she was not noticed, Natalie took up her knife.
Under a perfectly-acted pretense of toying with it absently, in
the character of a young lady absorbed in thought, she began
dividing a morsel of ham left on the edge of her plate, into six
tiny pieces. Launce's eye looked in sidelong expectation at the
divided and subdivided ham. He was evidently waiting to see the
collection of morsels put to some telegraphic use, previously
determined on between his neighbor and himself.
<P>
In the meanwhile the talk proceeded among the other persons at
the breakfast-table. Miss Lavinia addressed herself to Launce.
<P>
"Do you know, you careless boy, you gave me a fright this
morning? I was sleeping with my cabin window open, and I was
awoke by an awful splash in the water. I called for the
stewardess. I declare I thought somebody had fallen overboard!"
<P>
Sir Joseph looked up briskly; his sister had accidentally touched
on an old association.
<P>
"Talk of falling overboard," he began, "reminds me of an
extraordinary adventure--"
<P>
There Launce broke in, making his apologies.
<P>
"It shan't occur again, Miss Lavinia," he said. "To-morrow
morning I'll oil myself all over, and slip into the water as
silently as a seal."
<P>
"Of an extraordinary adventure," persisted Sir Joseph, "which
happened to me many years ago, when I was a young man. Lavinia?"
<P>
He stopped, and looked interrogatively at his sister. Miss
Graybrooke nodded her head responsively, and settled herself in
her chair, as if summoning her attention in anticipation of a
coming demand on it. To persons well acquainted with the brother
and sister these proceedings were ominous of an impending
narrative, protracted to a formidable length. The two always told
a story in couples, and always differed with each other about the
facts, the sister politely contradicting the brother when it was
Sir Joseph's story, and the brother politely contradicting the
sister when it was Miss Lavinia's story. Separated one from the
other, and thus relieved of their own habitual interchange of
contradiction, neither of them had ever been known to attempt the
relation of the simplest series of events without breaking down.
<P>
"It was five years before I knew you, Richard," proceeded Sir
Joseph.
<P>
"Six years," said Miss Graybrooke.
<P>
"Excuse me, Lavinia."
<P>
"No, Joseph, I have it down in my diary."
<P>
"Let us waive the point." (Sir Joseph invariably used this
formula as a means of at once conciliating his sister, and
getting a fresh start for his story.) "I was cruising off the
Mersey in a Liverpool pilot-boat. I had hired the boat in company
with a friend of mine, formerly notorious in London society,
under the nickname (derived from the peculiar brown color of his
whiskers) of 'Mahogany Dobbs.'"
<P>
"The color of his liveries, Joseph, not the color of his
whiskers."
<P>
"My dear Lavinia, you are thinking of 'Sea-green Shaw,' so called
from the extraordinary liveries he adopted for his servants in
the year when he was sheriff."
<P>
"I think not, Joseph."
<P>
"I beg your pardon, Lavinia."
<P>
Richard Turlington's knotty fingers drummed impatiently on the
table. He looked toward Natalie. She was idly arranging her
little morsels of ham in a pattern on her plate. Launcelot
Linzie, still more idly, was looking at the pattern. Seeing what
he saw now, Richard solved the problem which had puzzled him on
deck. It was simply impossible that Natalie's fancy could be
really taken by such an empty-headed fool as that!
<P>
Sir Joseph went on with his story:
<P>
"We were some ten or a dozen miles off the mouth of the Mersey--"
<P>
"Nautical miles, Joseph."
<P>
"It doesn't matter, Lavinia."
<P>
"Excuse me, brother, the late great and good Doctor Johnson said
accuracy ought always to be studied even in the most trifling
things."
<P>
"They were common miles, Lavinia."
<P>
"Th ey were nautical miles, Joseph."
<P>
"Let us waive the point. Mahogany Dobbs and I happened to be
below in the cabin, occupied--"
<P>
Here Sir Joseph paused (with his amiable smile) to consult his
memory. Miss Lavinia waited (with _her_ amiable smile) for the
coming opportunity of setting her brother right. At the same
moment Natalie laid down her knife and softly touched Launce
under the table. When she thus claimed his attention the six
pieces of ham were arranged as follows in her plate: Two pieces
were placed opposite each other, and four pieces were ranged
perpendicularly under them. Launce looked, and twice touched
Natalie under the table. Interpreted by the Code agreed on
between the two, the signal in the plate meant, "I must see you
in private." And Launce's double touch answered, "After
breakfast."
<P>
Sir Joseph proceeded with his story. Natalie took up her knife
again. Another signal coming!
<P>
"We were both down in the cabin, occupied in finishing our
dinner--"
<P>
"Just sitting down to lunch, Joseph."
<P>
"My dear! I ought to know."
<P>
"I only repeat what I heard, brother. The last time you told the
story, you and your friend were sitting down to lunch."
<P>
"We won't particularize, Lavinia. Suppose we say occupied over a
meal?"
<P>
"If it is of no more importance than that, Joseph, it would be
surely better to leave it out altogether."
<P>
"Let us waive the point. Well, we were suddenly alarmed by a
shout on deck, 'Man over-board!' We both rushed up the cabin
stairs, naturally under the impression that one of our crew had
fallen into the sea: an impression shared, I ought to add, by the
man at the helm, who had given the alarm."
<P>
Sir Joseph paused again. He was approaching one of the great
dramatic points in his story, and was naturally anxious to
present it as impressively as possible. He considered with
himself, with his head a little on one side. Miss Lavinia
considered with _herself_, with _her_ head a little on one side.
Natalie laid down her knife again, and again touched Launce under
the table. This time there were five pieces of ham ranged
longitudinally on the plate, with one piece immediately under
them at the center of the line. Interpreted by the Code, this
signal indicated two ominous words, "Bad news." Launce looked
significantly at the owner of the yacht (meaning of the look, "Is
he at the bottom of it?"). Natalie frowned in reply (meaning of
the frown, "Yes, he is"). Launce looked down again into the
plate. Natalie instantly pushed all the pieces of ham together in
a little heap (meaning of the heap, "No more to say").
<P>
"Well?" said Richard Turlington, turning sharply on Sir Joseph.
"Get on with your story. What next?"
<P>
Thus far he had not troubled himself to show even a decent
pretense of interest in his old friend's perpetually-interrupted
narrative. It was only when Sir Joseph had reached his last
sentence--intimating that the man overboard might turn out in
course of time not to be a man of the pilot-boat's crew--it was
only then that Turlington sat up in his chair, and showed signs
of suddenly feeling a strong interest in the progress of the
story.
<P>
Sir Joseph went on:
<P>
"As soon as we got on deck, we saw the man in the water, astern.
Our vessel was hove up in the wind, and the boat was lowered. The
master and one of the men took the oars. All told, our crew were
seven in number. Two away in the boat, a third at the helm, and,
to my amazement, when I looked round, the other four behind me
making our number complete. At the same moment Mahogany Dobbs,
who was looking through a telescope, called out, 'Who the devil
can he be? The man is floating on a hen-coop, and we have got
nothing of the sort on board this pilot-boat.'"
<P>
The one person present who happened to notice Richard
Turlington's face when those words were pronounced was Launcelot
Linzie. He--and he alone--saw the Levant trader's swarthy
complexion fade slowly to a livid ashen gray; his eyes the while
fixing themselves on Sir Joseph Graybrooke with a furtive glare
in them like the glare in the eyes of a wild beast. Apparently
conscious that Launce was looking at him--though he never turned
his head Launce's way--he laid his elbow on the table, lifted his
arm, and so rested his face on his hand, while the story went on,
as to screen it effectually from the young surgeon's view.
<P>
"The man was brought on board," proceeded Sir Joseph, "sure
enough, with a hen-coop--on which he had been found floating. The
poor wretch was blue with terror and exposure in the water; he
fainted when we lifted him on deck. When he came to himself he
told us a horrible story. He was a sick and destitute foreign
seaman, and he had hidden himself in the hold of an English
vessel (bound to a port in his native country) which had sailed
from Liverpool that morning. He had been discovered, and brought
before the captain. The captain, a monster in human form, if ever
there was one yet--"
<P>
Before the next word of the sentence could pass Sir Joseph's
lips, Turlington startled the little party in the cabin by
springing suddenly to his feet.
<P>
"The breeze!" he cried; "the breeze at last!"
<P>
As he spoke, he wheeled round to the cabin door so as to turn his
back on his guests, and hailed the deck.
<P>
"Which way is the wind?"
<P>
"There is not a breath of wind, sir."
<P>
Not the slightest movement in the vessel had been perceptible in
the cabin; not a sound had been audible indicating the rising of
the breeze. The owner of the yacht--accustomed to the sea,
capable, if necessary, of sailing his own vessel--had surely
committed a strange mistake! He turned again to his friends, and
made his apologies with an excess of polite regret far from
characteristic of him at other times and under other
circumstances.
<P>
"Go on," he said to Sir Joseph, when he had got to the end of his
excuses; "I never heard such an interesting story in my life.
Pray go on!"
<P>
The request was not an easy one to comply with. Sir Joseph's
ideas had been thrown into confusion. Miss Lavinia's
contradictions (held in reserve) had been scattered beyond
recall. Both brother and sister were, moreover, additionally
hindered in recovering the control of their own resources by the
look and manner of their host. He alarmed, instead of encouraging
the two harmless old people, by fronting them almost fiercely,
with his elbows squared on the table, and his face expressive of
a dogged resolution to sit there and listen, if need be, for the
rest of his life. Launce was the person who set Sir Joseph going
again. After first looking attentively at Richard, he took his
uncle straight back to the story by means of a question, thus:
<P>
"You don't mean to say that the captain of the ship threw the man
overboard?"
<P>
"That is just what he did, Launce. The poor wretch was too ill to
work his passage. The captain declared he would have no idle
foreign vagabond in his ship to eat up the provisions of
Englishmen who worked. With his own hands he cast the hen-coop
into the water, and (assisted by one of his sailors) he threw the
man after it, and told him to float back to Liverpool with the
evening tide."
<P>
"A lie!" cried Turlington, addressing himself, not to Sir Joseph,
but to Launce.
<P>
"Are you acquainted with the circumstances?" asked Launce,
quietly.
<P>
"I know nothing about the circumstances. I say, from my own
experience, that foreign sailors are even greater blackguards
than English sailors. The man had met with an accident, no doubt.
The rest of his story was a lie, and the object of it was to open
Sir Joseph's purse."
<P>
Sir Joseph mildly shook his head.
<P>
"No lie, Richard. Witnesses proved that the man had spoken the
truth."
<P>
"Witnesses? Pooh! More liars, you mean."
<P>
"I went to the owners of the vessel," pursued Sir Joseph." I got
from them the names of the officers and the crew, and I waited,
leaving the case in the hands of the Liverpool police. The ship
was wrecked at the mouth of the Amazon, but the crew and the
cargo were saved. The men belonging to Liverpool came back. They
were a bad set, I grant you. But they were examined separately
about the treatment of the foreign sailor, and they all told the
same story. They could give no account of their captain, nor of
the sailor who had been his accomplice in the crime, except that
they had not embarked in the ship which brought the rest of the
crew to England. Whatever may have become of the captain since,
he certainly never returned to Liverpool."
<P>
"Did you find out his name?"
<P>
The question was asked by Turlington. Even Sir Joseph, the least
observant of men, noticed that it was put with a perfectly
unaccountable irritability of manner.
<P>
"Don't be angry, Richard." said the old gentleman. "What is there
to be angry about?"
<P>
"I don't know what you mean. I'm not angry--I'm only curious.
_Did_ you find out who he was?"
<P>
"I did. His name was Goward. He was well known at Liverpool as a
very clever and a very dangerous man. Quite young at the time I
am speaking of, and a first-rate sailor; famous for taking
command of unseaworthy ships and vagabond crews. Report described
him to me as having made considerable sums of money in that way,
for a man in his position; serving firms, you know, with a bad
name, and running all sorts of desperate risks. A sad ruffian,
Richard! More than once in trouble, on both sides of the
Atlantic, for acts of violence and cruelty. Dead, I dare say,
long since."
<P>
"Or possibly," said Launce, "alive, under another name, and
thriving in a new way of life, with more desperate risks in it,
of some other sort."
<P>
"Are _you_ acquainted with the circumstances?" asked Turlington,
retorting Launce's question on him, with a harsh ring of defiance
in his brassy voice.
<P>
"What became of the poor foreign sailor, papa?" said Natalie,
purposely interrupting Launce before he could meet the question
angrily asked of him, by an angry reply.
<P>
"We made a subscription, and spoke to his consul, my dear. He
went back to his country, poor fellow, comfortably enough."
<P>
"And there is an end of Sir Joseph's story," said Turlington,
rising noisily from his chair. "It's a pity we haven't got a
literary man on board--he would make a novel of it." He looked up
at the skylight as he got on his feet. "Here is the breeze, this
time," he exclaimed, "and no mistake!"
<P>
It was true. At last the breeze had come. The sails flapped, the
main boom swung over with a thump, and the stagnant water,
stirred at last, bubbled merrily past the vessel's sides.
<P>
"Come on deck, Natalie, and get some fresh air," said Miss
Lavinia, leading the way to the cabin door.
<P>
Natalie held up the skirt of her nankeen dress, and exhibited the
purple trimming torn away over an extent of some yards.
<P>
"Give me half an hour first, aunt, in my cabin," she said, "to
mend this."
<P>
Miss Lavinia elevated her venerable eyebrows in amazement.
<P>
"You have done nothing but tear your dresses, my dear, since you
have been in Mr. Turlington's yacht. Most extraordinary! I have
torn none of mine during the whole cruise."
<P>
Natalie's dark color deepened a shade. She laughed, a little
uneasily. "I am so awkward on board ship," she replied, and
turned away and shut herself up in her cabin.
<P>
Richard Turlington produced his case of cigars.
<P>
"Now is the time," he said to Sir Joseph, "for the best cigar of
the day--the cigar after breakfast. Come on deck."
<P>
"You will join us, Launce?" said Sir Joseph.
<P>
"Give me half an hour first over my books," Launce replied." I
mustn't let my medical knowledge get musty at sea, and I might
not feel inclined to study later in the day."
<P>
"Quite right, my dear boy, quite right."
<P>
Sir Joseph patted his nephew approvingly on the shoulder. Launce
turned away on _his_ side, and shut himself up in his cabin.
<P>
The other three ascended together to the deck.
