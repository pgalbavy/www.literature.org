<p>From Kirkmichael on the train stopped at every station, but no
passenger seemed to leave or arrive at the little platforms white
in the moon. At Dalquharter the case of provisions was safely
transferred to the porter with instructions to take charge of
it till it was sent for. During the next ten minutes Dickson's
mind began to work upon his problem with a certain briskness.
It was all nonsense that the law of Scotland could not be summoned
to the defence. The jewels had been safely got rid of, and who
was to dispute their possession? Not Dobson and his crew, who
had no sort of title, and were out for naked robbery. The girl
had spoken of greater dangers from new enemies&mdash;kidnapping perhaps.
Well, that was felony, and the police must be brought in. Probably
if all were known the three watchers had criminal records, pages
long, filed at Scotland Yard. The man to deal with that side of
the business was Loudon the factor, and to him he was bound in
the first place. He had made a clear picture in his head of this
Loudon&mdash;a derelict old country writer, formal, pedantic, lazy,
anxious only to get an unprofitable business off his hands with
the least possible trouble, never going near the place himself,
and ably supported in his lethargy by conceited Edinburgh Writers
to the Signet. "Sich notions of business!" he murmured. "I wonder
that there's a single county family in Scotland no' in the bankruptcy
court!" It was his mission to wake up Mr. James Loudon.</p>

<p>Arrived at Auchenlochan he went first to the Salutation Hotel,
a pretentious place sacred to golfers. There he engaged a bedroom
for the night and, having certain scruples, paid for it in advance.
He also had some sandwiches prepared which he stowed in his pack,
and filled his flask with whisky. "I'm going home to Glasgow by
the first train to-morrow," he told the landlady, "and now I've
got to see a friend. I'll not be back till late." He was assured
that there would be no difficulty about his admittance at any
hour, and directed how to find Mr. Loudon's dwelling.</p>

<p>It was an old house fronting direct on the street, with a fanlight
above the door and a neat brass plate bearing the legend "Mr.
James Loudon, Writer." A lane ran up one side leading apparently
to a garden, for the moonlight showed the dusk of trees. In front
was the main street of Auchenlochan, now deserted save for a single
roysterer, and opposite stood the ancient town house, with arches
where the country folk came at the spring and autumn hiring fairs.
Dickson rang the antiquated bell, and was presently admitted to
a dark hall floored with oil-cloth, where a single gas-jet showed
that on one side was the business office and on the other the
living-rooms. Mr. Loudon was at supper, he was told, and he sent
in his card. Almost at once the door at the end on the left side
was flung open and a large figure appeared flourishing a napkin.
"Come in, sir, come in," it cried. "I've just finished a bite
of meat. Very glad to see you. Here, Maggie, what d'you mean by
keeping the gentleman standing in that outer darkness?"</p>

<p>The room into which Dickson was ushered was small and bright,
with a red paper on the walls, a fire burning and a big oil lamp
in the centre of a table. Clearly Mr. Loudon had no wife, for
it was a bachelor's den in every line of it. A cloth was laid
on a corner of the table, on which stood the remnants of a meal.
Mr. Loudon seemed to have been about to make a brew of punch,
for a kettle simmered by the fire, and lemons and sugar flanked
a pot-bellied whisky decanter of the type that used to be known
as a "mason's mell."</p>

<p>The sight of the lawyer was a surprise to Dickson and dissipated
his notions of an aged and lethargic incompetent. Mr. Loudon was
a strongly built man who could not be a year over fifty. He had
a ruddy face, clean-shaven except for a grizzled moustache; his
grizzled hair was thinning round the temples; but his skin was
unwrinkled and his eyes had all the vigour of youth. His tweed
suit was well cut, and the buff waistcoat with flaps and pockets
and the plain leather watchguard hinted at the sportsman, as did
the half-dozen racing prints on the wall. A pleasant high-coloured
figure he made; his voice had the frank ring due to much use out
of doors; and his expression had the singular candour which comes
from grey eyes with large pupils and a narrow iris.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. McCunn. Take the arm-chair by the fire. I've had
a wire from Glendonan and Speirs about you. I was just going to
have a glass of toddy&mdash;a grand thing for these uncertain April
nights. You'll join me? No? Well, you'll smoke anyway. There's
cigars at your elbow. Certainly, a pipe if you like. This is Liberty
Hall."</p>

<p>Dickson found some difficulty in the part for which he had cast
himself. He had expected to condescend upon an elderly inept and
give him sharp instructions; instead he found himself faced with
a jovial, virile figure which certainly did not suggest incompetence.
It has been mentioned already that he had always great difficulty
in looking any one in the face, and this difficulty was intensified
when he found himself confronted with bold and candid eyes. He
felt abashed and a little nervous.</p>

<p>"I've come to see you about Huntingtower House," he began.</p>

<p>"I know. So Glendonan's informed me. Well, I'm very glad to hear
it. The place has been standing empty far too long, and that is
worse for a new house than an old house. There's not much money
to spend on it either, unless we can make sure of a good tenant.
How did you hear about it?"</p>

<p>"I was taking a bit holiday and I spent a night at Dalquharter
with an old auntie of mine. You must understand I've just retired
from business, and I'm thinking of finding a country place. I
used to have the big provision shop in Mearns Street&mdash;now the
United Supply Stores, Limited. You've maybe heard of it?"</p>

<p>The other bowed and smiled. "Who hasn't? The name of Dickson
McCunn is known far beyond the city of Glasgow."</p>

<p>Dickson was not insensible of the flattery, and he continued
with more freedom. "I took a walk and got a glisk of the House
and I liked the look of it. You see, I want a quiet bit a good
long way from a town, and at the same time a house with all modern
conveniences. I suppose Huntingtower has that?"</p>

<p>"When it was built fifteen years ago it was considered a model&mdash;six
bathrooms, its own electric light plant, steam heating, an independent
boiler for hot water, the whole bag of tricks. I won't say but
what some of these contrivances will want looking to, for the
place has been some time empty, but there can be nothing very
far wrong, and I can guarantee that the bones of the house are
good."</p>

<p>"Well, that's all right," said Dickson. "I don't mind spending
a little money myself if the place suits me. But of that, of course,
I'm not yet certain, for I've only had a glimpse of the outside.
I wanted to get into the policies, but a man at the lodge wouldn't
let me. They're a mighty uncivil lot down there."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear that," said Mr. Loudon in a tone of concern.</p>

<p>"Ay, and if I take the place I'll stipulate that you get rid
of the lodgekeepers."</p>

<p>"There won't be the slightest difficulty about that, for they
are only weekly tenants. But I'm vexed to hear they were uncivil.
I was glad to get any tenant that offered, and they were well
recommended to me."</p>

<p>"They're foreigners."</p>

<p>"One of them is&mdash;a Belgian refugee that Lady Morewood took an
interest in. But the other&mdash;Spittal, they call him &mdash;I thought
he was Scotch."</p>

<p>"He's not that. And I don't like the innkeeper either. I would
want him shifted."</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon laughed. "I dare say Dobson is a rough diamond. There's
worse folk in the world all the same, but I don't think he will
want to stay. He only went there to pass the time till he heard
from his brother in Vancouver. He's a roving spirit, and will
be off overseas again."</p>

<p>"That's all right!" said Dickson, who was beginning to have horrid
suspicions that he might be on a wild-goose chase after all. "Well,
the next thing is for me to see over the House."</p>

<p>"Certainly. I'd like to go with you myself. What day would suit
you? Let me see. This is Friday. What about this day week?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of to-morrow. Since I'm down in these parts I
may as well get the job done."</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon looked puzzled. "I quite see that. But I don't think
it's possible. You see, I have to consult the owners and get their
consent to a lease. Of course they have the general purpose of
letting, but&mdash;well, they're queer folk the Kennedys," and his
face wore the half-embarrassed smile of an honest man preparing
to make confidences. "When poor Mr. Quentin died, the place went
to his two sisters in joint ownership. A very bad arrangement,
as you can imagine. It isn't entailed, and I've always been pressing
them to sell, but so far they won't hear of it. They both married
Englishmen, so it will take a day or two to get in touch with
them. One, Mrs. Stukely, lives in Devonshire. The other &mdash;Miss
Katie that was&mdash;married Sir Francis Morewood, the general, and
I hear that she's expected back in London next Monday from the
Riviera. I'll wire and write first thing to-morrow morning. But
you must give me a day or two."</p>

<p>Dickson felt himself waking up. His doubts about his own sanity
were dissolving, for, as his mind reasoned, the factor was prepared
to do anything he asked&mdash;but only after a week had gone. What
he was concerned with was the next few days.</p>

<p>"All the same I would like to have a look at the place to-morrow,
even if nothing comes of it."</p>

<p>Mr. Loudon looked seriously perplexed. "You will think me absurdly
fussy, Mr. McCunn, but I must really beg of you to give up the
idea. The Kennedys, as I have said, are&mdash;well, not exactly like
other people, and I have the strictest orders not to let any one
visit the house without their express leave. It sounds a ridiculous
rule, but I assure you it's as much as my job is worth to disregard
it."</p>

<p>"D'you mean to say not a soul is allowed inside the House?"</p>

<p>"Not a soul."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Loudon, I'm going to tell you a queer thing, which
I think you ought to know. When I was taking a walk the other
night&mdash;your Belgian wouldn't let me into the policies, but I went
down the glen&mdash;what's that they call it? the Garple Dean &mdash;I
got round the back where the old ruin stands and I had a good
look at the House. I tell you there was somebody in it."</p>

<p>"It would be Spittal, who acts as caretaker."</p>

<p>"It was not. It was a woman. I saw her on the verandah."</p>

<p>The candid grey eyes were looking straight at Dickson, who managed
to bring his own shy orbs to meet them. He thought that he detected
a shade of hesitation. Then Mr. Loudon got up from his chair and
stood on the hearthrug looking down at his visitor. He laughed,
with some embarrassment, but ever so pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I really don't know what you will think of me, Mr. McCunn. Here
are you, coming to do us all a kindness, and lease that infernal
white elephant, and here have I been steadily hoaxing you for
the last five minutes. I humbly ask your pardon. Set it down to
the loyalty of an old family lawyer. Now, I am going to tell you
the truth and take you into our confidence, for I know we are
safe with you. The Kennedys are&mdash;always have been&mdash;just a wee
bit queer. Old inbred stock, you know. They will produce somebody
like poor Mr. Quentin, who was as sane as you or me, but as a
rule in every generation there is one member of the family&mdash;or
more&mdash;who is just a little bit&#11834;" and he tapped his forehead.
"Nothing violent, you understand, but just not quite 'wise and
world-like,' as the old folk say. Well, there's a certain old
lady, an aunt of Mr. Quentin and his sisters, who has always been
about tenpence in the shilling. Usually she lives at Bournemouth,
but one of her crazes is a passion for Huntingtower, and the Kennedys
have always humoured her and had her to stay every spring. When
the House was shut up that became impossible, but this year she
took such a craving to come back, that Lady Morewood asked me
to arrange it. It had to be kept very quiet, but the poor old
thing is perfectly harmless, and just sits and knits with her
maid and looks out of the seaward windows. Now you see why I can't
take you there to-morrow. I have to get rid of the old lady, who
in any case was travelling south early next week. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," said Dickson with some fervour. He had learned exactly
what he wanted. The factor was telling him lies. Now he knew where
to place Mr. Loudon.</p>

<p>He always looked back upon what followed as a very creditable
piece of play-acting for a man who had small experience in that
line.</p>

<p>"Is the old lady a wee wizened body, with a black cap and something
like a white cashmere shawl round her shoulders?"</p>

<p>"You describe her exactly," Mr. Loudon replied eagerly.</p>

<p>"That would explain the foreigners."</p>

<p>"Of course. We couldn't have natives who would make the thing
the clash of the countryside."</p>

<p>"Of course not. But it must be a difficult job to keep a business
like that quiet. Any wandering policeman might start inquiries.
And supposing the lady became violent?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's no fear of that. Besides, I've a position in this
county &mdash;Deputy Fiscal and so forth&mdash;and a friend of the
Chief Constable. I think I may be trusted to do a little private
explaining if the need arose."</p>

<p>"I see," said Dickson. He saw, indeed, a great deal which would
give him food for furious thought. "Well, I must just possess
my soul in patience. Here's my Glasgow address, and I look to
you to send me a telegram whenever you're ready for me. I'm at
the Salutation to-night, and go home to-morrow with the first
train. Wait a minute"&mdash;and he pulled out his watch&mdash;"there's a
train stops at Auchenlochan at 10.17. I think I'll catch that....
Well, Mr. Loudon, I'm very much obliged to you, and I'm glad to
think that it'll no be long till we renew our acquaintance."</p>

<p>The factor accompanied him to the door, diffusing geniality.
"Very pleased indeed to have met you. A pleasant journey and a
quick return."</p>

<p>The street was still empty. Into a corner of the arches opposite
the moon was shining, and Dickson retired thither to consult his
map of the neighbourhood. He found what he wanted and, as he lifted
his eyes, caught sight of a man coming down the causeway. Promptly
he retired into the shadow and watched the new-comer. There could
be no mistake about the figure; the bulk, the walk, the carriage
of the head marked it for Dobson. The inn-keeper went slowly past
the factor's house; then halted and retraced his steps; then,
making sure that the street was empty, turned into the side lane
which led to the garden.</p>

<p>This was what sailors call a cross-bearing, and strengthened
Dickson's conviction. He delayed no longer, but hurried down the
side street by which the north road leaves the town.</p>

<p>He had crossed the bridge of Lochan and was climbing the steep
ascent which led to the heathy plateau separating that stream
from the Garple before he had got his mind quite clear on the
case. <em>First</em>, Loudon was in the plot, whatever it was;
responsible for the details of the girl's imprisonment, but not
the main author. That must be the Unknown who was still to come,
from whom Spidel took his orders. Dobson was probably Loudon's
special henchman, working directly under him. <em>Secondly</em>,
the immediate object had been the jewels, and they were happily
safe in the vaults of the incorruptible Mackintosh. But, <em>third</em>&mdash;and
this only on Saskia's evidence&mdash;the worst danger to her began
with the arrival of the Unknown. What could that be? Probably,
kidnapping. He was prepared to believe anything of people like
Bolsheviks. And, <em>fourth</em>, this danger was due within the
next day or two. Loudon had been quite willing to let him into
the house and to sack all the watchers within a week from that
date. The natural and right thing was to summon the aid of the
law, but, <em>fifth</em>, that would be a slow business with Loudon
able to put spokes in the wheels and befog the authorities, and
the mischief would be done before a single policeman showed his
face in Dalquharter. Therefore, <em>sixth</em>, he and Heritage
must hold the fort in the meantime, and he would send a wire to
his lawyer, Mr. Caw, to get to work with the constabulary. <em>Seventh</em>,
he himself was probably free from suspicion in both Loudon's and
Dobson's minds as a harmless fool. But that freedom would not
survive his reappearance in Dalquharter. He could say, to be sure,
that he had come back to see his auntie, but that would not satisfy
the watchers, since, so far as they knew, he was the only man
outside the gang who was aware that people were dwelling in the
House. They would not tolerate his presence in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>He formulated his conclusions as if it were an ordinary business
deal, and rather to his surprise was not conscious of any fear.
As he pulled together the belt of his waterproof he felt the reassuring
bulges in its pockets which were his pistol and cartridges. He
reflected that it must be very difficult to miss with a pistol
if you fired it at, say, three yards, and if there was to be shooting
that would be his range. Mr. McCunn had stumbled on the precious
truth that the best way to be rid of quaking knees is to keep
a busy mind.</p>

<p>He crossed the ridge of the plateau and looked down on the Garple
glen. There were the lights of Dalquharter&mdash;or rather a single
light, for the inhabitants went early to bed. His intention was
to seek quarters with Mrs. Morran, when his eye caught a gleam
in a hollow of the moor a little to the east. He knew it for the
camp-fire around which Dougal's warriors bivouacked. The notion
came to him to go there instead, and hear the news of the day
before entering the cottage. So he crossed the bridge, skirted
a plantation of firs, and scrambled through the broom and heather
in what he took to be the right direction.</p>

<p>The moon had gone down, and the quest was not easy. Dickson had
come to the conclusion that he was on the wrong road, when he
was summoned by a voice which seemed to arise out of the ground.</p>

<p>"Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"What's that you say?"</p>

<p>"Who goes there?" The point of a pole was held firmly against
his chest.</p>

<p>"I'm Mr. McCunn, a friend of Dougal's."</p>

<p>"Stand, friend." The shadow before him whistled and another shadow
appeared. "Report to the Chief that there's a man here, name o'
McCunn, seekin' for him."</p>

<p>Presently the messenger returned with Dougal and a cheap lantern
which he flashed in Dickson's face.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," said that leader, who had his jaw bound up as
if he had the toothache. "What are ye doing back here?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, Dougal," was the answer, "I couldn't stay
away. I was fair miserable when I thought of Mr. Heritage and
you laddies left to yourselves. My conscience simply wouldn't
let me stop at home, so here I am."</p>

<p>Dougal grunted, but clearly he approved, for from that moment
he treated Dickson with a new respect. Formerly when he had referred
to him at all it had been as "auld McCunn." Now it was "Mister
McCunn." He was given rank as a worthy civilian ally.</p>

<p>The bivouac was a cheerful place in the wet night. A great fire
of pine roots and old paling posts hissed in the fine rain, and
around it crouched several urchins busy making oatmeal cakes in
the embers. On one side a respectable lean-to had been constructed
by nailing a plank to two fir-trees, running sloping poles thence
to the ground, and thatching the whole with spruce branches and
heather. On the other side two small dilapidated home-made tents
were pitched. Dougal motioned his companion into the lean-to,
where they had some privacy from the rest of the band.</p>

<p>"Well, what's your news?" Dickson asked. He noticed that the
Chieftain seemed to have been comprehensively in the wars, for
apart from the bandage on his jaw, he had numerous small cuts
on his brow, and a great rent in one of his shirt sleeves. Also
he appeared to be going lame, and when he spoke a new gap was
revealed in his large teeth.</p>

<p>"Things," said Dougal solemnly, "has come to a bonny cripus.
This very night we've been in a battle."</p>

<p>He spat fiercely, and the light of war burned in his eyes.</p>

<p>"It was the tinklers from the Garple Dean. They yokit on us about
seven o'clock, just at the darkenin'. First they tried to bounce
us. We weren't wanted here, they said, so we'd better clear. I
telled them that it was them that wasn't wanted. 'Awa' to Finnick,'
says I. 'D'ye think we take our orders from dirty ne'er-do-weels
like you?' 'By God,' says they, 'we'll cut your lights out,' and
then the battle started."</p>

<p>"What happened?" Dickson asked excitedly.</p>

<p>"They were four muckle men against six laddies, and they thought
they had an easy job! Little they kenned the Gorbals Die-Hards!
I had been expectin' something of the kind, and had made my plans.
They first tried to pu' down our tents and burn them. I let them
get within five yards, reservin' my fire. The first volley&mdash;stones
from our hands and our catties&mdash;halted them, and before they could
recover three of us had got hold o' burnin' sticks frae the fire
and were lammin' into them. We kinnled their claes, and they fell
back swearin' and stampin' to get the fire out. Then I gave the
word and we were on them wi' our poles, usin' the points accordin'
to instructions. My orders was to keep a good distance, for if
they had grippit one o' us he'd ha' been done for. They were roarin'
mad by now, and twae had out their knives, but they couldn't do
muckle, for it was gettin' dark, and they didn't ken the ground
like us, and were aye trippin' and tumblin'. But they pressed
us hard, and one o' them landed me an awful clype on the jaw.
They were still aiming at our tents, and I saw that if they got
near the fire again it would be the end o' us. So I blew my whistle
for Thomas Yownie, who was in command o' the other half of us,
with instructions to fall upon their rear. That brought Thomas
up, and the tinklers had to face round about and fight a battle
on two fronts. We charged them and they broke, and the last seen
o' them they were coolin' their burns in the Garple."</p>

<p>"Well done, man. Had you many casualties?"</p>

<p>"We're a' a wee thing battered, but nothing to hurt. I'm the
worst, for one o' them had a grip o' me for about three seconds,
and Gosh! he was fierce."</p>

<p>"They're beaten off for the night, anyway?"</p>

<p>"Ay, for the night. But they'll come back, never fear. That's
why I said that things had come to a cripus."</p>

<p>"What's the news from the House?"</p>

<p>"A quiet day, and no word o' Lean or Dobson."</p>

<p>Dickson nodded. "They were hunting me."</p>

<p>"Mr. Heritage has gone to bide in the Hoose. They were watchin'
the Garple Dean, so I took him round by the Laver foot and up
the rocks. He's a grand climber, yon. We fund a road up the rocks
and got in by the verandy. Did ye ken that the lassie had a pistol?
Well, she has, and it seems that Mr. Heritage is a good shot wi'
a pistol, so there's some hope thereaways.... Are the jools safe?"</p>

<p>"Safe in the bank. But the jools were not the main thing."</p>

<p>Dougal nodded. "So I was thinkin'. The lassie wasn't muckle the
easier for gettin' rid o' them. I didn't just quite understand
what she said to Mr. Heritage, for they were aye wanderin' into
foreign langwidges, but it seems she's terrible feared o' somebody
that may turn up any moment. What's the reason I can't say. She's
maybe got a secret, or maybe it's just that she's ower bonny."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," said Dickson and proceeded to recount his
interview with the factor, to which Dougal gave close attention.
"Now the way I read the thing is this. There's a plot to kidnap
that lady, for some infernal purpose, and it depends on the arrival
of some person or persons, and it's due to happen in the next
day or two. If we try to work it through the police alone, they'll
beat us, for Loudon will manage to hang the business up till it's
too late. So we must take up the job ourselves. We must stand
a siege, Mr. Heritage and me and you laddies, and for that purpose
we'd better all keep together. It won't be extra easy to carry
her off from all of us, and if they do manage it we'll stick to
their heels.... Man, Dougal, isn't it a queer thing that whiles
law-abiding folk have to make their own laws?... So my plan is
that the lot of us get into the House and form a garrison. If
you don't, the tinklers will come back and you'll no' beat them
in the daylight."</p>

<p>"I doubt no'," said Dougal. "But what about our meat?"</p>

<p>"We must lay in provisions. We'll get what we can from Mrs. Morran,
and I've left a big box of fancy things at Dalquharter station.
Can you laddies manage to get it down here?"</p>

<p>Dougal reflected. "Ay, we can hire Mrs. Sempill's powny, the
same that fetched our kit."</p>

<p>"Well, that's your job to-morrow. See, I'll write you a line
to the station-master. And will you undertake to get it some way
into the House?"</p>

<p>"There's just the one road open&mdash;by the rocks. It'll have to
be done. It <em>can</em> be done."</p>

<p>"And I've another job. I'm writing this telegram to a friend
in Glasgow who will put a spoke in Mr. Loudon's wheel. I want
one of you to go to Kirkmichael to send it from the telegraph
office there."</p>

<p>Dougal placed the wire to Mr. Caw in his bosom. "What about yourself?
We want somebody outside to keep his eyes open. It's bad strawtegy
to cut off your communications."</p>

<p>Dickson thought for a moment. "I believe you're right. I believe
the best plan for me is to go back to Mrs. Morran's as soon as
the old body's like to be awake. You can always get at me there,
for it's easy to slip into her back kitchen without anybody in
the village seeing you.... Yes, I'll do that, and you'll come
and report developments to me. And now I'm for a bite and a pipe.
It's hungry work travelling the country in the small hours."</p>

<p>"I'm going to introjuice ye to the rest o' us," said Dougal.
"Here, men!" he called, and four figures rose from the side of
the fire. As Dickson munched a sandwich he passed in review the
whole company of the Gorbals Die-Hards, for the pickets were also
brought in, two others taking their places. There was Thomas Yownie,
the Chief of Staff, with a wrist wound up in the handkerchief
which he had borrowed from his neck. There was a burly lad who
wore trousers much too large for him, and who was known as Peer
Pairson, a contraction presumably for Peter Paterson. After him
came a lean tall boy who answered to the name of Napoleon. There
was a midget of a child, desperately sooty in the face either
from battle or from fire-tending, who was presented as Wee Jaikie.
Last came the picket who had held his pole at Dickson's chest,
a sandy-haired warrior with a snub nose and the mouth and jaw
of a pug-dog. He was Old Bill, or in Dougal's parlance "Auld Bull."</p>

<p>The Chieftain viewed his scarred following with a grim content.
"That's a tough lot for ye, Mr. McCunn. Used a' their days wi'
sleepin' in coalrees and dunnies and dodgin' the polis. Ye'll
no beat the Gorbals Die-Hards."</p>

<p>"You're right, Dougal," said Dickson. "There's just the six of
you. If there were a dozen, I think this country would be needing
some new kind of a government."</p>
