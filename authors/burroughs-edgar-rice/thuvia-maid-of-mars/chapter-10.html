As Carthoris moved through the forest toward the distant
cliffs with Thuvia's hand still tight pressed in his,
he wondered a little at the girl's continued silence,
yet the contact of her cool palm against his was so
pleasant that he feared to break the spell of her
new-found reliance in him by speaking.
<P>
Onward through the dim wood they passed until the
shadows of the quick coming Martian night commenced to
close down upon them.  Then it was that Carthoris turned
to speak to the girl at his side.
<P>
They must plan together for the future.  It was his idea
to pass through the cliffs at once if they could locate
the passage, and he was quite positive that they were now
close to it; but he wanted her assent to the proposition.
<P>
As his eyes rested upon her, he was struck by her
strangely ethereal appearance.  She seemed suddenly to
have dissolved into the tenuous substance of a dream,
and as he continued to gaze upon her, she faded slowly
from his sight.
<P>
For an instant he was dumbfounded, and then the whole
truth flashed suddenly upon him.  Jav had caused him to
believe that Thuvia was accompanying him through the
wood while, as a matter of fact, he had detained the
girl for himself!
<P>
Carthoris was horrified.  He cursed himself for his stupidity,
and yet he knew that the fiendish power which the Lotharian
had invoked to confuse him might have deceived any.
<P>
Scarce had he realized the truth than he had started to
retrace his steps toward Lothar, but now he moved at a
trot, the Earthly thews that he had inherited from his
father carrying him swiftly over the soft carpet of fallen
leaves and rank grass.
<P>
Thuria's brilliant light flooded the plain before the
walled city of Lothar as Carthoris broke from the wood
opposite the great gate that had given the fugitives egress
from the city earlier in the day.
<P>
At first he saw no indication that there was another
than himself anywhere about.  The plain was deserted.
No myriad bowmen camped now beneath the overhanging
verdure of the giant trees.  No gory heaps of tortured
dead defaced the beauty of the scarlet sward.
All was silence. All was peace.
<P>
The Heliumite, scarce pausing at the forest's verge,
pushed on across the plain toward the city, when presently
he descried a huddled form in the grass at his feet.
<P>
It was the body of a man, lying prone.  Carthoris turned
the figure over upon its back.  It was Jav, but torn and
mangled almost beyond recognition.
<P>
The prince bent low to note if any spark of life remained,
and as he did so the lids raised and dull, suffering
eyes looked up into his.
<P>
"The Princess of Ptarth!" cried Carthoris.  "Where is she?
Answer me, man, or I complete the work that another has
so well begun."
<P>
"Komal," muttered Jav.  "He sprang upon me . . . and
would have devoured me but for the girl.  Then they went
away together into the wood--the girl and the great
banth . . . her fingers twined in his tawny mane."
<P>
"Which way went they?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
"There," replied Jav faintly, "toward the passage
through the cliffs."
<P>
The Prince of Helium waited to hear no more, but
springing to his feet, raced back again into the forest.
<P>
It was dawn when he reached the mouth of the dark tunnel
that would lead him to the other world beyond this valley of
ghostly memories and strange hypnotic influences and menaces.
<P>
Within the long, dark passages he met with no accident
or obstacle, coming at last into the light of day beyond
the mountains, and no great distance from the southern
verge of the domains of the Torquasians, not more
than one hundred and fifty haad at the most.
<P>
From the boundary of Torquas to the city of Aaanthor
is a distance of some two hundred haads, so that the
Heliumite had before him a journey of more than one
hundred and fifty Earth miles between him and Aaanthor.
<P>
He could at best but hazard a chance guess that toward
Aaanthor Thuvia would take her flight.  There lay
the nearest water, and there might be expected some day
a rescuing party from her father's empire; for Carthoris
knew Thuvan Dihn well enough to know that he would
leave no stone unturned until he had tracked down the
truth as to his daughter's abduction, and learned all that
there might be to learn of her whereabouts.
<P>
He realized, of course, that the trick which had laid
suspicion upon him would greatly delay the discovery
of the truth, but little did he guess to what vast
proportions had the results of the villainy of Astok
of Dusar already grown.
<P>
Even as he emerged from the mouth of the passage to
look across the foothills in the direction of Aaanthor,
a Ptarth battle fleet was winging its majestic way slowly
toward the twin cities of Helium, while from far distant
Kaol raced another mighty armada to join forces with its ally.
<P>
He did not know that in the face of the circumstantial
evidence against him even his own people had commenced
to entertain suspicions that he might have stolen the
Ptarthian princess.
<P>
He did not know of the lengths to which the Dusarians
had gone to disrupt the friendship and alliance which
existed between the three great powers of the eastern
hemisphere--Helium, Ptarth and Kaol.
<P>
How Dusarian emissaries had found employment in important
posts in the foreign offices of the three great nations,
and how, through these men, messages from one jeddak to
another were altered and garbled until the patience and
pride of the three rulers and former friends could no
longer endure the humiliations and insults contained
in these falsified papers--not any of this he knew.
<P>
Nor did he know how even to the last John Carter,
Warlord of Mars, had refused to permit the jeddak of
Helium to declare war against either Ptarth or Kaol,
because of his implicit belief in his son, and that
eventually all would be satisfactorily explained.
<P>
And now two great fleets were moving upon Helium, while
the Dusarian spies at the court of Tardos Mors saw to it
that the twin cities remained in ignorance of their danger.
<P>
War had been declared by Thuvan Dihn, but the messenger
who had been dispatched with the proclamation had been
a Dusarian who had seen to it that no word of warning
reached the twin cities of the approach of a hostile fleet.
<P>
For several days diplomatic relations had been severed
between Helium and her two most powerful neighbors,
and with the departure of the ministers had come a
total cessation of wireless communication between the
disputants, as is usual upon Barsoom.
<P>
But of all this Carthoris was ignorant.  All that interested
him at present was the finding of Thuvia of Ptarth.  Her trail
beside that of the huge banth had been well marked to the tunnel,
and was once more visible leading southward into the foothills.
<P>
As he followed rapidly downward toward the dead sea-
bottom, where he knew he must lose the spoor in the
resilient ochre vegetation, he was suddenly surprised to
see a naked man approaching him from the north-east.
<P>
As the fellow drew closer, Carthoris halted to await his coming.
He knew that the man was unarmed, and that he was apparently
a Lotharian, for his skin was white and his hair auburn.
<P>
He approached the Heliumite without sign of fear,
and when quite close called out the cheery Barsoomian
"kaor" of greeting.
<P>
"Who are you?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
"I am Kar Komak, odwar of the bowmen," replied the other.
"A strange thing has happened to me.  For ages Tario has
been bringing me into existence as he needed the services
of the army of his mind.  Of all the bowmen it has
been Kar Komak who has been oftenest materialized.
<P>
"For a long time Tario has been concentrating his
mind upon my permanent materialization.  It has been
an obsession with him that some day this thing could
be accomplished and the future of Lothar assured.
He asserted that matter was nonexistent except in the
imagination of man--that all was mental, and so he believed
that by persisting in his suggestion he could eventually make
of me a permanent suggestion in the minds of all creatures.
<P>
"Yesterday he succeeded, but at such a time!  It must
have come all unknown to him, as it came to me without
my knowledge, as, with my horde of yelling bowmen, I
pursued the fleeing Torquasians back to their ochre plains.
<P>
"As darkness settled and the time came for us to
fade once more into thin air, I suddenly found myself
alone upon the edge of the great plain which lies yonder
at the foot of the low hills.
<P>
"My men were gone back to the nothingness from which
they had sprung, but I remained--naked and unarmed.
<P>
"At first I could not understand, but at last came a
realization of what had occurred.  Tario's long suggestions
had at last prevailed, and Kar Komak had become a reality
in the world of men; but my harness and my weapons
had faded away with my fellows, leaving me naked and
unarmed in a hostile country far from Lothar."
<P>
"You wish to return to Lothar?" asked Carthoris.
<P>
"No!" replied Kar Komak quickly.  "I have no love for Tario.
Being a creature of his mind, I know him too well.
He is cruel and tyrannical--a master I have no desire to serve.
Now that he has succeeded in accomplishing my permanent
materialization, he will be unbearable, and he will go on
until he has filled Lothar with his creatures.
I wonder if he has succeeded as well with the maid of Lothar."
<P>
"I thought there were no women there," said Carthoris.
<P>
"In a hidden apartment in the palace of Tario," replied
Kar Komak, "the jeddak has maintained the suggestion of
a beautiful girl, hoping that some day she would become
permanent.  I have seen her there.  She is wonderful!
But for her sake I hope that Tario succeeds not so well
with her as he has with me.
<P>
"Now, red man, I have told you of myself--what of you?"
<P>
Carthoris liked the face and manner of the bowman.
There had been no sign of doubt or fear in his expression
as he had approached the heavily-armed Heliumite,
and he had spoken directly and to the point.
<P>
So the Prince of Helium told the bowman of Lothar who he was
and what adventure had brought him to this far country.
<P>
"Good!" exclaimed the other, when he had done.  "Kar
Komak will accompany you.  Together we shall find the
Princess of Ptarth and with you Kar Komak will return
to the world of men--such a world as he knew in the
long-gone past when the ships of mighty Lothar ploughed
angry Throxus, and the roaring surf beat against the
barrier of these parched and dreary hills."
<P>
"What mean you?" asked Carthoris.  "Had you really a
former actual existence?"
<P>
"Most assuredly," replied Kar Komak.  "In my day I
commanded the fleets of Lothar--mightiest of all the
fleets that sailed the five salt seas.
<P>
"Wherever men lived upon Barsoom there was the name
of Kar Komak known and respected.  Peaceful were the
land races in those distant days--only the seafarers
were warriors; but now has the glory of the past faded,
nor did I think until I met you that there remained upon
Barsoom a single person of our own mould who lived and
loved and fought as did the ancient seafarers of my time.
<P>
"Ah, but it will seem good to see men once again--real men!
Never had I much respect for the landsmen of my day.
They remained in their walled cities wasting their
time in play, depending for their protection entirely
upon the sea race.  And the poor creatures who remain,
the Tarios and Javs of Lothar, are even worse than their
ancient forbears."
<P>
Carthoris was a trifle sceptical as to the wisdom
of permitting the stranger to attach himself to him.
There was always the chance that he was but the essence
of some hypnotic treachery which Tario or Jav was attempting
to exert upon the Heliumite; and yet, so sincere had been
the manner and the words of the bowman, so much the
fighting man did he seem, but Carthoris could not
find it in his heart to doubt him.
<P>
The outcome of the matter was that he gave the naked
odwar leave to accompany him, and together they set
out upon the spoor of Thuvia and Komal.
<P>
Down to the ochre sea-bottom the trail led.  There it
disappeared, as Carthoris had known that it would; but where
it entered the plain its direction had been toward Aaanthor
and so toward Aaanthor the two turned their faces.
<P>
It was a long and tedious journey, fraught with many dangers.
The bowman could not travel at the pace set by Carthoris,
whose muscles carried him with great rapidity over the
face of the small planet, the force of gravity of which
exerts so much less retarding power than that of the Earth.
Fifty miles a day is a fair average for a Barsoomian,
but the son of John Carter might easily have covered
a hundred or more miles had he cared to desert his
new-found comrade.
<P>
All the way they were in constant danger of discovery
by roving bands of Torquasians, and especially was this
true before they reached the boundary of Torquas.
<P>
Good fortune was with them, however, and although
they sighted two detachments of the savage green men,
they were not themselves seen.
<P>
And so they came, upon the morning of the third day,
within sight of the glistening domes of distant Aaanthor.
Throughout the journey Carthoris had ever strained his
eyes ahead in search of Thuvia and the great banth; but
not till now had he seen aught to give him hope.
<P>
This morning, far ahead, half-way between themselves
and Aaanthor, the men saw two tiny figures moving toward
the city.  For a moment they watched them intently.
Then Carthoris, convinced, leaped forward at a rapid run,
Kar Komak following as swiftly as he could.
<P>
The Heliumite shouted to attract the girl's attention,
and presently he was rewarded by seeing her turn and
stand looking toward him.  At her side the great banth
stood with up-pricked ears, watching the approaching man.
<P>
Not yet could Thuvia of Ptarth have recognized Carthoris,
though that it was he she must have been convinced,
for she waited there for him without sign of fear.
<P>
Presently he saw her point toward the northwest, beyond him.
Without slackening his pace, he turned his eyes in
the direction she indicated.
<P>
Racing silently over the thick vegetation, not half a
mile behind, came a score of fierce green warriors,
charging him upon their mighty thoats.
<P>
To their right was Kar Komak, naked and unarmed,
yet running valiantly toward Carthoris and shouting warning
as though he, too, had but just discovered the silent,
menacing company that moved so swiftly forward with
couched spears and ready long-swords.
<P>
Carthoris shouted to the Lotharian, warning him back,
for he knew that he could but uselessly sacrifice his
life by placing himself, all unarmed, in the path of
the cruel and relentless savages.
<P>
But Kar Komak never hesitated.  With shouts of
encouragement to his new friend, he hurried onward toward
the Prince of Helium.  The red man's heart leaped in
response to this exhibition of courage and self-sacrifice. 
He regretted now that he had not thought to give Kar Komak
one of his swords; but it was too late to attempt it, for
should he wait for the Lotharian to overtake him or return
to meet him, the Torquasians would reach Thuvia of
Ptarth before he could do so.
<P>
Even as it was, it would be nip and tuck as to who
came first to her side.
<P>
Again he turned his face in her direction, and now,
from Aaanthor way, he saw a new force hastening
toward them--two medium-sized war craft--and even at
the distance they still were from him he discerned the
device of Dusar upon their bows.
<P>
Now, indeed, seemed little hope for Thuvia of Ptarth.
With savage warriors of the hordes of Torquas charging
toward her from one direction, and no less implacable
enemies, in the form of the creatures of Astok,
Prince of Dusar, bearing down upon her from another,
while only a banth, a red warrior, and an unarmed bowman
were near to defend her, her plight was quite hopeless
and her cause already lost ere ever it was contested.
<P>
As Thuvia saw Carthoris approaching, she felt again
that unaccountable sensation of entire relief from
responsibility and fear that she had experienced upon a
former occasion.  Nor could she account for it while her mind
still tried to convince her heart that the Prince of Helium
had been instrumental in her abduction from her father's court.
She only knew that she was glad when he was by her side,
and that with him there all things seemed possible--even
such impossible things as escape from her present predicament.
<P>
Now had he stopped, panting, before her.  A brave smile of
encouragement lit his face.
<P>
"Courage, my princess," he whispered.
<P>
To the girl's memory flashed the occasion upon which
he had used those same words--in the throne-room of
Tario of Lothar as they had commenced to slip down the
sinking marble floor toward an unknown fate.
<P>
Then she had not chidden him for the use of that familiar
salutation, nor did she chide him now, though she was
promised to another.  She wondered at herself--flushing
at her own turpitude; for upon Barsoom it is a shameful
thing for a woman to listen to those two words from
another than her husband or her betrothed.
<P>
Carthoris saw her flush of mortification, and in an instant
regretted his words.  There was but a moment before the
green warriors would be upon them.
<P>
"Forgive me!" said the man in a low voice.  "Let my
great love be my excuse--that, and the belief that I have
but a moment more of life," and with the words he turned
to meet the foremost of the green warriors.
<P>
The fellow was charging with couched spear, but Carthoris
leaped to one side, and as the great thoat and its
rider hurtled harmlessly past him he swung his long-sword
in a mighty cut that clove the green carcass in twain.
<P>
At the same moment Kar Komak leaped with bare hands
clawing at the leg of another of the huge riders; the
balance of the horde raced in to close quarters, dismounting
the better to wield their favourite long-swords; the
Dusarian fliers touched the soft carpet of the ochre-clad
sea-bottom, disgorging fifty fighting men from their bowels;
and into the swirling sea of cutting, slashing swords
sprang Komal, the great banth.
