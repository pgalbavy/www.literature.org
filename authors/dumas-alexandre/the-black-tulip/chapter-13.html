<P>Whilst Cornelius was engaged with his own thoughts, a coach 
had driven up to the scaffold. This vehicle was for the 
prisoner. He was invited to enter it, and he obeyed.</P>
<P>His last look was towards the Buytenhof. He hoped to see at 
the window the face of Rosa, brightening up again.</P>
<P>But the coach was drawn by good horses, who soon carried Van 
Baerle away from among the shouts which the rabble roared in 
honour of the most magnanimous Stadtholder, mixing with it a 
spice of abuse against the brothers De Witt and the godson 
of Cornelius, who had just now been saved from death.</P>
<P>This reprieve suggested to the worthy spectators remarks 
such as the following:  - </P>
<P>&quot;It's very fortunate that we used such speed in having 
justice done to that great villain John, and to that little 
rogue Cornelius, otherwise his Highness might have snatched 
them from us, just as he has done this fellow.&quot;</P>
<P>Among all the spectators whom Van Baerle's execution had 
attracted to the Buytenhof, and whom the sudden turn of 
affairs had disagreeably surprised, undoubtedly the one most 
disappointed was a certain respectably dressed burgher, who 
from early morning had made such a good use of his feet and 
elbows that he at last was separated from the scaffold only 
by the file of soldiers which surrounded it.</P>
<P>Many had shown themselves eager to see the perfidious blood 
of the guilty Cornelius flow, but not one had shown such a 
keen anxiety as the individual just alluded to.</P>
<P>The most furious had come to the Buytenhof at daybreak, to 
secure a better place; but he, outdoing even them, had 
passed the night at the threshold of the prison, from 
whence, as we have already said, he had advanced to the very 
foremost rank, unguibus et rostro,  -  that is to say, 
coaxing some, and kicking the others.</P>
<P>And when the executioner had conducted the prisoner to the 
scaffold, the burgher, who had mounted on the stone of the 
pump the better to see and be seen, made to the executioner 
a sign which meant,  - </P>
<P>&quot;It's a bargain, isn't it?&quot;</P>
<P>The executioner answered by another sign, which was meant to 
say,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Be quiet, it's all right.&quot;</P>
<P>This burgher was no other than Mynheer Isaac Boxtel, who 
since the arrest of Cornelius had come to the Hague to try 
if he could not get hold of the three bulbs of the black 
tulip.</P>
<P>Boxtel had at first tried to gain over Gryphus to his 
interest, but the jailer had not only the snarling 
fierceness, but likewise the fidelity, of a dog. He had 
therefore bristled up at Boxtel's hatred, whom he had 
suspected to be a warm friend of the prisoner, making 
trifling inquiries to contrive with the more certainty some 
means of escape for him.</P>
<P>Thus to the very first proposals which Boxtel made to 
Gryphus to filch the bulbs which Cornelius van Baerle must 
be supposed to conceal, if not in his breast, at least in 
some corner of his cell, the surly jailer had only answered 
by kicking Mynheer Isaac out, and setting the dog at him.</P>
<P>The piece which the mastiff had torn from his hose did not 
discourage Boxtel. He came back to the charge, but this time 
Gryphus was in bed, feverish, and with a broken arm. He 
therefore was not able to admit the petitioner, who then 
addressed himself to Rosa, offering to buy her a head-dress 
of pure gold if she would get the bulbs for him. On this, 
the generous girl, although not yet knowing the value of the 
object of the robbery, which was to be so well remunerated, 
had directed the tempter to the executioner, as the heir of 
the prisoner.</P>
<P>In the meanwhile the sentence had been pronounced. Thus 
Isaac had no more time to bribe any one. He therefore clung 
to the idea which Rosa had suggested: he went to the 
executioner.</P>
<P>Isaac had not the least doubt that Cornelius would die with 
the bulbs on his heart.</P>
<P>But there were two things which Boxtel did not calculate 
upon:  - </P>
<P>Rosa, that is to say, love;</P>
<P>William of Orange, that is to say, clemency.</P>
<P>But for Rosa and William, the calculations of the envious 
neighbour would have been correct.</P>
<P>But for William, Cornelius would have died.</P>
<P>But for Rosa, Cornelius would have died with his bulbs on 
his heart.</P>
<P>Mynheer Boxtel went to the headsman, to whom he gave himself 
out as a great friend of the condemned man; and from whom he 
bought all the clothes of the dead man that was to be, for 
one hundred guilders; rather an exorbitant sum, as he 
engaged to leave all the trinkets of gold and silver to the 
executioner.</P>
<P>But what was the sum of a hundred guilders to a man who was 
all but sure to buy with it the prize of the Haarlem 
Society?</P>
<P>It was money lent at a thousand per cent., which, as nobody 
will deny, was a very handsome investment.</P>
<P>The headsman, on the other hand, had scarcely anything to do 
to earn his hundred guilders. He needed only, as soon as the 
execution was over, to allow Mynheer Boxtel to ascend the 
scaffold with his servants, to remove the inanimate remains 
of his friend.</P>
<P>The thing was, moreover, quite customary among the &quot;faithful 
brethren,&quot; when one of their masters died a public death in 
the yard of the Buytenhof.</P>
<P>A fanatic like Cornelius might very easily have found 
another fanatic who would give a hundred guilders for his 
remains.</P>
<P>The executioner also readily acquiesced in the proposal, 
making only one condition,  -  that of being paid in advance.</P>
<P>Boxtel, like the people who enter a show at a fair, might be 
disappointed, and refuse to pay on going out.</P>
<P>Boxtel paid in advance, and waited.</P>
<P>After this, the reader may imagine how excited Boxtel was; 
with what anxiety he watched the guards, the Recorder, and 
the executioner; and with what intense interest he surveyed 
the movements of Van Baerle. How would he place himself on 
the block? how would he fall? and would he not, in falling, 
crush those inestimable bulbs? had not he at least taken 
care to enclose them in a golden box,  -  as gold is the 
hardest of all metals?</P>
<P>Every trifling delay irritated him. Why did that stupid 
executioner thus lose time in brandishing his sword over the 
head of Cornelius, instead of cutting that head off?</P>
<P>But when he saw the Recorder take the hand of the condemned, 
and raise him, whilst drawing forth the parchment from his 
pocket,  -  when he heard the pardon of the Stadtholder 
publicly read out,  -  then Boxtel was no more like a human 
being; the rage and malice of the tiger, of the hyena, and 
of the serpent glistened in his eyes, and vented itself in 
his yell and his movements. Had he been able to get at Van 
Baerle, he would have pounced upon him and strangled him.</P>
<P>And so, then, Cornelius was to live, and was to go with him 
to Loewestein, and thither to his prison he would take with 
him his bulbs; and perhaps he would even find a garden where 
the black tulip would flower for him.</P>
<P>Boxtel, quite overcome by his frenzy, fell from the stone 
upon some Orangemen, who, like him, were sorely vexed at the 
turn which affairs had taken. They, mistaking the frantic 
cries of Mynheer Isaac for demonstrations of joy, began to 
belabour him with kicks and cuffs, such as could not have 
been administered in better style by any prize-fighter on 
the other side of the Channel.</P>
<P>Blows were, however, nothing to him. He wanted to run after 
the coach which was carrying away Cornelius with his bulbs. 
But in his hurry he overlooked a paving-stone in his way, 
stumbled, lost his centre of gravity, rolled over to a 
distance of some yards, and only rose again, bruised and 
begrimed, after the whole rabble of the Hague, with their 
muddy feet, had passed over him.</P>
<P>One would think that this was enough for one day, but 
Mynheer Boxtel did not seem to think so, as, in addition to 
having his clothes torn, his back bruised, and his hands 
scratched, he inflicted upon himself the further punishment 
of tearing out his hair by handfuls, as an offering to that 
goddess of envy who, as mythology teaches us, wears a 
head-dress of serpents. </P></article>
