<p>I have said that the story of Flora de Barral was imparted to
me in stages.  At this stage I did not see Marlow for some time. 
At last, one evening rather early, very soon after dinner, he
turned up in my rooms.</p>

<p>I had been waiting for his call primed with a remark which had
not occurred to me till after he had gone away.</p>

<p>"I say," I tackled him at once, "how can you be certain that
Flora de Barral ever went to sea?  After all, the wife of the
captain of the <em>Ferndale</em>&mdash;" the lady that mustn't be disturbed
"of the old ship-keeper&mdash;may not have been Flora."</p>

<p>"Well, I do know," he said, "if only because I have been keeping
in touch with Mr. Powell."</p>

<p>"You have!" I cried.  "This is the first I hear of it.  And since
when?"</p>

<p>"Why, since the first day.  You went up to town leaving me in
the inn.  I slept ashore.  In the morning Mr. Powell came in for
breakfast; and after the first awkwardness of meeting a man you
have been yarning with overnight had worn off, we discovered a
liking for each other."</p>

<p>As I had discovered the fact of their mutual liking before either
of them, I was not surprised.</p>

<p>"And so you kept in touch," I said.</p>

<p>"It was not so very difficult.  As he was always knocking about
the river I hired Dingle's sloop-rigged three-tonner to be more
on an equality. Powell was friendly but elusive.  I don't think
he ever wanted to avoid me.  But it is a fact that he used to
disappear out of the river in a very mysterious manner sometimes. 
A man may land anywhere and bolt inland&mdash;but what about his five-ton
cutter?  You can't carry that in your hand like a suit-case.</p>

<p>"Then as suddenly he would reappear in the river, after one had
given him up.  I did not like to be beaten.  That's why I hired
Dingle's decked boat.  There was just the accommodation in her
to sleep a man and a dog. But I had no dog-friend to invite. 
Fyne's dog who saved Flora de Barral's life is the last dog-friend
I had.  I was rather lonely cruising about; but that, too, on
the river has its charm, sometimes.  I chased the mystery of the
vanishing Powell dreamily, looking about me at the ships, thinking
of the girl Flora, of life's chances&mdash;and, do you know, it was
very simple."</p>

<p>"What was very simple?" I asked innocently.</p>

<p>"The mystery."</p>

<p>"They generally are that," I said.</p>

<p>Marlow eyed me for a moment in a peculiar manner.</p>

<p>"Well, I have discovered the mystery of Powell's disappearances. 
The fellow used to run into one of these narrow tidal creeks on
the Essex shore.  These creeks are so inconspicuous that till
I had studied the chart pretty carefully I did not know of their
existence.  One afternoon, I made Powell's boat out, heading into
the shore.  By the time I got close to the mud-flat his craft
had disappeared inland.  But I could see the mouth of the creek
by then.  The tide being on the turn I took the risk of getting
stuck in the mud suddenly and headed in.  All I had to guide me
was the top of the roof of some sort of small building.  I got
in more by good luck than by good management.  The sun had set
some time before; my boat glided in a sort of winding ditch between
two low grassy banks; on both sides of me was the flatness of
the Essex marsh, perfectly still.  All I saw moving was a heron;
he was flying low, and disappeared in the murk.  Before I had
gone half a mile, I was up with the building the roof of which
I had seen from the river.  It looked like a small barn.  A row
of piles driven into the soft bank in front of it and supporting
a few planks made a sort of wharf.  All this was black in the
falling dusk, and I could just distinguish the whitish ruts of
a carttrack stretching over the marsh towards the higher land,
far away.  Not a sound was to be heard.  Against the low streak
of light in the sky I could see the mast of Powell's cutter moored
to the bank some twenty yards, no more, beyond that black barn
or whatever it was.  I hailed him with a loud shout.  Got no answer. 
After making fast my boat just astern, I walked along the bank
to have a look at Powell's.  Being so much bigger than mine she
was aground already.  Her sails were furled; the slide of her
scuttle hatch was closed and padlocked.  Powell was gone.  He
had walked off into that dark, still marsh somewhere.  I had not
seen a single house anywhere near; there did not seem to be any
human habitation for miles; and now as darkness fell denser over
the land I couldn't see the glimmer of a single light.  However,
I supposed that there must be some village or hamlet not very
far away; or only one of these mysterious little inns one comes
upon sometimes in most unexpected and lonely places.</p>

<p>"The stillness was oppressive.  I went back to my boat, made
some coffee over a spirit-lamp, devoured a few biscuits, and stretched
myself aft, to smoke and gaze at the stars.  The earth was a mere
shadow, formless and silent, and empty, till a bullock turned
up from somewhere, quite shadowy too.  He came smartly to the
very edge of the bank as though he meant to step on board, stretched
his muzzle right over my boat, blew heavily once, and walked off
contemptuously into the darkness from which he had come.  I had
not expected a call from a bullock, though a moment's thought
would have shown me that there must be lots of cattle and sheep
on that marsh.  Then everything became still as before.  I might
have imagined myself arrived on a desert island.  In fact, as
I reclined smoking a sense of absolute loneliness grew on me. 
And just as it had become intense, very abruptly and without any
preliminary sound I heard firm, quick footsteps on the little
wharf.  Somebody coming along the cart-track had just stepped
at a swinging gait on to the planks.  That somebody could only
have been Mr. Powell.  Suddenly he stopped short, having made
out that there were two masts alongside the bank where he had
left only one.  Then he came on silent on the grass.  When I spoke
to him he was astonished.</p>

<p>"Who would have thought of seeing you here!" he exclaimed, after
returning my good evening.</p>

<p>"I told him I had run in for company.  It was rigorously true."</p>

<p>"You knew I was here?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Of course," I said.  "I tell you I came in for company."</p>

<p>"He is a really good fellow," went on Marlow.  "And his capacity
for astonishment is quickly exhausted, it seems.  It was in the
most matterof-fact manner that he said, 'Come on board of me,
then; I have here enough supper for two.'  He was holding a bulky
parcel in the crook of his arm.  I did not wait to be asked twice,
as you may guess.  His cutter has a very neat little cabin, quite
big enough for two men not only to sleep but to sit and smoke
in.  We left the scuttle wide open, of course. As to his provisions
for supper, they were not of a luxurious kind.  He complained
that the shops in the village were miserable.  There was a big
village within a mile and a half.  It struck me he had been very
long doing his shopping; but naturally I made no remark.  I didn't
want to talk at all except for the purpose of setting him going."</p>

<p>"And did you set him going?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I did," said Marlow, composing his features into an impenetrable
expression which somehow assured me of his success better than
an air of triumph could have done.</p>

<p>* * * * *</p>

<p>"You made him talk?" I said after a silence.</p>

<p>"Yes, I made him . . . about himself."</p>

<p>"And to the point?"</p>

<p>"If you mean by this," said Marlow, "that it was about the voyage
of the <em>Ferndale</em>, then again, yes.  I brought him to talk
about that voyage, which, by the by, was not the first voyage
of Flora de Barral.  The man himself, as I told you, is simple,
and his faculty of wonder not very great.  He's one of those people
who form no theories about facts. Straightforward people seldom
do.  Neither have they much penetration. But in this case it did
not matter.  <em>I&mdash;</em>we&mdash;have already the inner knowledge. 
We know the history of Flora de Barral.  We know something of
Captain Anthony.  We have the secret of the situation.  The man
was intoxicated with the pity and tenderness of his part.  Oh
yes! Intoxicated is not too strong a word; for you know that love
and desire take many disguises.  I believe that the girl had been
frank with him, with the frankness of women to whom perfect frankness
is impossible, because so much of their safety depends on judicious
reticences.  I am not indulging in cheap sneers.  There is necessity
in these things.  And moreover she could not have spoken with
a certain voice in the face of his impetuosity, because she did
not have time to understand either the state of her feelings,
or the precise nature of what she was doing.</p>

<p>Had she spoken ever so clearly he was, I take it, too elated
to hear her distinctly.  I don't mean to imply that he was a fool. 
Oh dear no!  But he had no training in the usual conventions,
and we must remember that he had no experience whatever of women. 
He could only have an ideal conception of his position.  An ideal
is often but a flaming vision of reality.</p>

<p>To him enters Fyne, wound up, if I may express myself so irreverently,
wound up to a high pitch by his wife's interpretation of the girl's
letter.  He enters with his talk of meanness and cruelty, like
a bucket of water on the flame.  Clearly a shock.  But the effects
of a bucket of water are diverse.  They depend on the kind of
flame.  A mere blaze of dry straw, of course . . . but there can
be no question of straw there. Anthony of the <em>Ferndale</em>
was not, could not have been, a straw-stuffed specimen of a man. 
There are flames a bucket of water sends leaping skyhigh.</p>

<p>We may well wonder what happened when, after Fyne had left him,
the hesitating girl went up at last and opened the door of that
room where our man, I am certain, was not extinguished.  Oh no! 
Nor cold; whatever else he might have been.</p>

<p>It is conceivable he might have cried at her in the first moment
of humiliation, of exasperation, "Oh, it's you!  Why are you here? 
If I am so odious to you that you must write to my sister to say
so, I give you back your word."  But then, don't you see, it could
not have been that.  I have the practical certitude that soon
afterwards they went together in a hansom to see the ship&mdash;as
agreed.  That was my reason for saying that Flora de Barral did
go to sea . . . "</p>

<p>"Yes.  It seems conclusive," I agreed.  "But even without that&mdash;if,
as you seem to think, the very desolation of that girlish figure
had a sort of perversely seductive charm, making its way through
his compassion to his senses (and everything is possible)&mdash;then
such words could not have been spoken."</p>

<p>"They might have escaped him involuntarily," observed Marlow. 
"However, a plain fact settles it.  They went off together to
see the ship."</p>

<p>"Do you conclude from this that nothing whatever was said?" I
inquired.</p>

<p>"I should have liked to see the first meeting of their glances
upstairs there," mused Marlow.  "And perhaps nothing was said. 
But no man comes out of such a 'wrangle' (as Fyne called it) without
showing some traces of it.  And you may be sure that a girl so
bruised all over would feel the slightest touch of anything resembling
coldness.  She was mistrustful; she could not be otherwise; for
the energy of evil is so much more forcible than the energy of
good that she could not help looking still upon her abominable
governess as an authority.  How could one have expected her to
throw off the unholy prestige of that long domination?  She could
not help believing what she had been told; that she was in some
mysterious way odious and unlovable.  It was cruelly true&mdash;<em>to
her</em>.  The oracle of so many years had spoken finally.  Only
other people did not find her out at once . . . I would not go
so far as to say she believed it altogether.  That would be hardly
possible.  But then haven't the most flattered, the most conceited
of us their moments of doubt?  Haven't they?  Well, I don't know. 
There may be lucky beings in this world unable to believe any
evil of themselves.  For my own part I'll tell you that once,
many years ago now, it came to my knowledge that a fellow I had
been mixed up with in a certain transaction&mdash;a clever fellow whom
I really despised&mdash;was going around telling people that I was
a consummate hypocrite.  He could know nothing of it.  It suited
his humour to say so.  I had given him no ground for that particular
calumny. Yet to this day there are moments when it comes into
my mind, and involuntarily I ask myself, 'What if it were true?' 
It's absurd, but it has on one or two occasions nearly affected
my conduct.  And yet I was not an impressionable ignorant young
girl.  I had taken the exact measure of the fellow's utter worthlessness
long before.  He had never been for me a person of prestige and
power, like that awful governess to Flora de Barral.  See the
might of suggestion?  We live at the mercy of a malevolent word. 
A sound, a mere disturbance of the air, sinks into our very soul
sometimes.  Flora de Barral had been more astounded than convinced
by the first impetuosity of Roderick Anthony.  She let herself
be carried along by a mysterious force which her person had called
into being, as her father had been carried away out of his depth
by the unexpected power of successful advertising.</p>

<p>They went on board that morning.  The <em>Ferndale</em> had just
come to her loading berth.  The only living creature on board
was the ship-keeper&mdash;whether the same who had been described to
us by Mr. Powell, or another, I don't know.  Possibly some other
man.  He, looking over the side, saw, in his own words, 'the captain
come sailing round the corner of the nearest cargo-shed, in company
with a girl.'  He lowered the accommodation ladder down on to
the jetty . . . "</p>

<p>"How do you know all this?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>Marlow interjected an impatient:</p>

<p>"You shall see by and by . . . Flora went up first, got down
on deck and stood stock-still till the captain took her by the
arm and led her aft. The ship-keeper let them into the saloon. 
He had the keys of all the cabins, and stumped in after them. 
The captain ordered him to open all the doors, every blessed door;
state-rooms, passages, pantry, fore-cabin&mdash;and then sent him away.</p>

<p>"The <em>Ferndale</em> had magnificent accommodation.  At the
end of a passage leading from the quarter-deck there was a long
saloon, its sumptuosity slightly tarnished perhaps, but having
a grand air of roominess and comfort.  The harbour carpets were
down, the swinging lamps hung, and everything in its place, even
to the silver on the sideboard.  Two large stern cabins opened
out of it, one on each side of the rudder casing. These two cabins
communicated through a small bathroom between them, and one was
fitted up as the captain's state-room.  The other was vacant,
and furnished with arm-chairs and a round table, more like a room
on shore, except for the long curved settee following the shape
of the ship's stern.  In a dim inclined mirror, Flora caught sight
down to the waist of a pale-faced girl in a white straw hat trimmed
with roses, distant, shadowy, as if immersed in water, and was
surprised to recognize herself in those surroundings.  They seemed
to her arbitrary, bizarre, strange. Captain Anthony moved on,
and she followed him.  He showed her the other cabins.  He talked
all the time loudly in a voice she seemed to have known extremely
well for a long time; and yet, she reflected, she had not heard
it often in her life.  What he was saying she did not quite follow.
He was speaking of comparatively indifferent things in a rather
moody tone, but she felt it round her like a caress.  And when
he stopped she could hear, alarming in the sudden silence, the
precipitated beating of her heart.</p>

<p>The ship-keeper dodged about the quarter-deck, out of hearing,
and trying to keep out of sight.  At the same time, taking advantage
of the open doors with skill and prudence, he could see the captain
and "that girl" the captain had brought aboard.  The captain was
showing her round very thoroughly.  Through the whole length of
the passage, far away aft in the perspective of the saloon the
ship-keeper had interesting glimpses of them as they went in and
out of the various cabins, crossing from side to side, remaining
invisible for a time in one or another of the state-rooms, and
then reappearing again in the distance.  The girl, always following
the captain, had her sunshade in her hands.  Mostly she would
hang her head, but now and then she would look up.  They had a
lot to say to each other, and seemed to forget they weren't alone
in the ship.  He saw the captain put his hand on her shoulder,
and was preparing himself with a certain zest for what might follow,
when the "old man" seemed to recollect himself, and came striding
down all the length of the saloon.  At this move the ship-keeper
promptly dodged out of sight, as you may believe, and heard the
captain slam the inner door of the passage.  After that disappointment
the ship-keeper waited resentfully for them to clear out of the
ship.  It happened much sooner than he had expected.  The girl
walked out on deck first.  As before she did not look round. 
She didn't look at anything; and she seemed to be in such a hurry
to get ashore that she made for the gangway and started down the
ladder without waiting for the captain.</p>

<p>What struck the ship-keeper most was the absent, unseeing expression
of the captain, striding after the girl.  He passed him, the ship-keeper,
without notice, without an order, without so much as a look. 
The captain had never done so before.  Always had a nod and a
pleasant word for a man.  From this slight the ship-keeper drew
a conclusion unfavourable to the strange girl.  He gave them time
to get down on the wharf before crossing the deck to steal one
more look at the pair over the rail.  The captain took hold of
the girl's arm just before a couple of railway trucks drawn by
a horse came rolling along and hid them from the shipkeeper's
sight for good.</p>

<p>Next day, when the chief mate joined the ship, he told him the
tale of the visit, and expressed himself about the girl "who had
got hold of the captain" disparagingly.  She didn't look healthy,
he explained.  "Shabby clothes, too," he added spitefully.</p>

<p>The mate was very much interested.  He had been with Anthony
for several years, and had won for himself in the course of many
long voyages, a footing of familiarity, which was to be expected
with a man of Anthony's character.  But in that slowly-grown intimacy
of the sea, which in its duration and solitude had its unguarded
moments, no words had passed, even of the most casual, to prepare
him for the vision of his captain associated with any kind of
girl.  His impression had been that women did not exist for Captain
Anthony.  Exhibiting himself with a girl!  A girl! What did he
want with a girl?  Bringing her on board and showing her round
the cabin!  That was really a little bit too much.  Captain Anthony
ought to have known better.</p>

<p>Franklin (the chief mate's name was Franklin) felt disappointed;
almost disillusioned.  Silly thing to do!  Here was a confounded
old ship-keeper set talking.  He snubbed the ship-keeper, and
tried to think of that insignificant bit of foolishness no more;
for it diminished Captain Anthony in his eyes of a jealously devoted
subordinate.</p>

<p>Franklin was over forty; his mother was still alive.  She stood
in the forefront of all women for him, just as Captain Anthony
stood in the forefront of all men.  We may suppose that these
groups were not very large.  He had gone to sea at a very early
age.  The feeling which caused these two people to partly eclipse
the rest of mankind were of course not similar; though in time
he had acquired the conviction that he was "taking care" of them
both.  The "old lady" of course had to be looked after as long
as she lived.  In regard to Captain Anthony, he used to say that:
why should he leave him?  It wasn't likely that he would come
across a better sailor or a better man or a more comfortable ship. 
As to trying to better himself in the way of promotion, commands
were not the sort of thing one picked up in the streets, and when
it came to that, Captain Anthony was as likely to give him a lift
on occasion as anyone in the world.</p>

<p>From Mr. Powell's description Franklin was a short, thick black-haired
man, bald on the top.  His head sunk between the shoulders, his
staring prominent eyes and a florid colour, gave him a rather
apoplectic appearance.  In repose, his congested face had a humorously
melancholy expression.</p>

<p>The ship-keeper having given him up all the keys and having been
chased forward with the admonition to mind his own business and
not to chatter about what did not concern him, Mr. Franklin went
under the poop.  He opened one door after another; and, in the
saloon, in the captain's stateroom and everywhere, he stared anxiously
as if expecting to see on the bulkheads, on the deck, in the air,
something unusual&mdash;sign, mark, emanation, shadow&mdash;he hardly knew
what&mdash;some subtle change wrought by the passage of a girl.  But
there was nothing.  He entered the unoccupied stern cabin and
spent some time there unscrewing the two stern ports.  In the
absence of all material evidences his uneasiness was passing away.
With a last glance round he came out and found himself in the
presence of his captain advancing from the other end of the saloon.</p>

<p>Franklin, at once, looked for the girl.  She wasn't to be seen. 
The captain came up quickly.  'Oh! you are here, Mr. Franklin.' 
And the mate said, 'I was giving a little air to the place, sir.' 
Then the captain, his hat pulled down over his eyes, laid his
stick on the table and asked in his kind way: 'How did you find
your mother, Franklin?'&mdash;'The old lady's first-rate, sir, thank
you.'  And then they had nothing to say to each other.  It was
a strange and disturbing feeling for Franklin.  He, just back
from leave, the ship just come to her loading berth, the captain
just come on board, and apparently nothing to say!  The several
questions he had been anxious to ask as to various things which
had to be done had slipped out of his mind.  He, too, felt as
though he had nothing to say.</p>

<p>The captain, picking up his stick off the table, marched into
his stateroom and shut the door after him.  Franklin remained
still for a moment and then started slowly to go on deck.  But
before he had time to reach the other end of the saloon he heard
himself called by name.  He turned round.  The captain was staring
from the doorway of his state-room. Franklin said, "Yes, sir." 
But the captain, silent, leaned a little forward grasping the
door handle.  So he, Franklin, walked aft keeping his eyes on
him.  When he had come up quite close he said again, "Yes, sir?"
interrogatively.  Still silence.  The mate didn't like to be stared
at in that manner, a manner quite new in his captain, with a defiant
and self-conscious stare, like a man who feels ill and dares you
to notice it.  Franklin gazed at his captain, felt that there
was something wrong, and in his simplicity voiced his feelings
by asking point-blank:</p>

<p>"What's wrong, sir?"</p>

<p>The captain gave a slight start, and the character of his stare
changed to a sort of sinister surprise.  Franklin grew very uncomfortable,
but the captain asked negligently:</p>

<p>"What makes you think that there's something wrong?"</p>

<p>"I can't say exactly.  You don't look quite yourself, sir," Franklin
owned up.</p>

<p>"You seem to have a confoundedly piercing eye," said the captain
in such an aggressive tone that Franklin was moved to defend himself.</p>

<p>"We have been together now over six years, sir, so I suppose
I know you a bit by this time.  I could see there was something
wrong directly you came on board."</p>

<p>"Mr. Franklin," said the captain, "we have been more than six
years together, it is true, but I didn't know you for a reader
of faces.  You are not a correct reader though.  It's very far
from being wrong.  You understand?  As far from being wrong as
it can very well be.  It ought to teach you not to make rash surmises. 
You should leave that to the shore people.  They are great hands
at spying out something wrong.  I dare say they know what they
have made of the world.  A dam' poor job of it and that's plain. 
It's a confoundedly ugly place, Mr. Franklin.  You don't know
anything of it?  Well&mdash;no, we sailors don't.  Only now and then
one of us runs against something cruel or underhand, enough to
make your hair stand on end.  And when you do see a piece of their
wickedness you find that to set it right is not so easy as it
looks . . . Oh!  I called you back to tell you that there will
be a lot of workmen, joiners and all that sent down on board first
thing to-morrow morning to start making alterations in the cabin. 
You will see to it that they don't loaf.  There isn't much time."</p>

<p>Franklin was impressed by this unexpected lecture upon the wickedness
of the solid world surrounded by the salt, uncorruptible waters
on which he and his captain had dwelt all their lives in happy
innocence.  What he could not understand was why it should have
been delivered, and what connection it could have with such a
matter as the alterations to be carried out in the cabin.  The
work did not seem to him to be called for in such a hurry.  What
was the use of altering anything?  It was a very good accommodation,
spacious, well-distributed, on a rather old-fashioned plan, and
with its decorations somewhat tarnished.  But a dab of varnish,
a touch of gilding here and there, was all that was necessary. 
As to comfort, it could not be improved by any alterations.  He
resented the notion of change; but he said dutifully that he would
keep his eye on the workmen if the captain would only let him
know what was the nature of the work he had ordered to be done.</p>

<p>"You'll find a note of it on this table.  I'll leave it for you
as I go ashore," said Captain Anthony hastily.  Franklin thought
there was no more to hear, and made a movement to leave the saloon. 
But the captain continued after a slight pause, "You will be surprised,
no doubt, when you look at it.  There'll be a good many alterations. 
It's on account of a lady coming with us.  I am going to get married,
Mr. Franklin!"</p>
