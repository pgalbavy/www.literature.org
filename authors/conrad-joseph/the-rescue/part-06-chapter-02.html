<p>Along the hot and gloomy forest path, neglected, overgrown and
strangled in the fierce life of the jungle, there came a faint
rustle of leaves. Jaffir, the servant of princes, the messenger
of great men, walked, stooping, with a broad chopper in his hand.
He was naked from the waist upward, his shoulders and arms were
scratched and bleeding. A multitude of biting insects made a cloud
about his head. He had lost his costly and ancient head-kerchief,
and when in a slightly wider space he stopped in a listening attitude
anybody would have taken him for a fugitive.</p>

<p>He waved his arms about, slapping his shoulders, the sides of
his head, his heaving flanks; then, motionless, listened again
for a while. A sound of firing, not so much made faint by distance
as muffled by the masses of foliage, reached his ears, dropping
shots which he could have counted if he had cared to. "There is
fighting in the forest already,"  he thought. Then putting his
head low in the tunnel of vegetation he dashed forward out of
the horrible cloud of flies, which he actually managed for an
instant to leave behind him. But it was not from the cruelty of
insects that he was flying, for no man could hope to drop that
escort, and Jaffir in his life of a faithful messenger had been
accustomed, if such an extravagant phrase may be used, to be eaten
alive. Bent nearly double he glided and dodged between the trees,
through the undergrowth, his brown body streaming with sweat,
his firm limbs gleaming like limbs of imperishable bronze through
the mass of green leaves that are forever born and forever dying.
For all his desperate haste he was no longer a fugitive; he was
simply a man in a tremendous hurry. His flight, which had begun
with a bound and a rush and a general display of great presence
of mind, was a simple issue from a critical situation. Issues
from critical situations are generally simple if one is quick
enough to think of them in time. He became aware very soon that
the attempt to pursue him had been given up, but he had taken
the forest path and had kept up his pace because he had left his
Rajah and the lady Immada beset by enemies on the edge of the
forest, as good as captives to a party of Tengga's men.</p>

<p>Belarab's hesitation had proved too much even for Hassim's hereditary
patience in such matters. It is but becoming that weighty negotiations
should be spread over many days, that the same requests and arguments
should be repeated in the same words, at many successive interviews,
and receive the same evasive answers. Matters of state demand
the dignity of such a procedure as if time itself had to wait
on the power and wisdom of rulers. Such are the proceedings of
embassies and the dignified patience of envoys. But at this time
of crisis Hassim's impatience obtained the upper hand; and though
he never departed from the tradition of soft speech and restrained
bearing while following with his sister in the train of the pious
Belarab, he had his moments of anger, of anxiety, of despondency.
His friendships, his future, his country's destinies were at stake,
while Belarab's camp wandered deviously over the back country
as if influenced by the vacillation of the ruler's thought, the
very image of uncertain fate.</p>

<p>Often no more than the single word "Good" was all the answer
vouchsafed to Hassim's daily speeches. The lesser men, companions
of the Chief, treated him with deference; but Hassim could feel
the opposition from the women's side of the camp working against
his cause in subservience to the mere caprice of the new wife,
a girl quite gentle and kind to her dependents, but whose imagination
had run away with her completely and had made her greedy for the
loot of the yacht from mere simplicity and innocence. What could
Hassim, that stranger, wandering and poor, offer for her acceptance?
Nothing. The wealth of his far-off country was but an idle tale,
the talk of an exile looking for help.</p>

<p>At night Hassim had to listen to the anguished doubts of Immada,
the only companion of his life, child of the same mother, brave
as a man, but in her fears a very woman. She whispered them to
him far into the night while the camp of the great Belarab was
hushed in sleep and the fires had sunk down to mere glowing embers.
Hassim soothed her gravely. But he, too, was a native of Wajo
where men are more daring and quicker of mind than other Malays.
More energetic, too, and energy does not go without an inner fire.
Hassim lost patience and one evening he declared to his sister
Immada: "To-morrow we leave this ruler without a mind and go back
to our white friend."</p>

<p>Therefore next morning, letting the camp move on the direct road
to the settlement, Hassim and Immada took a course of their own.
It was a lonely path between the jungle and the clearings. They
had two attendants with them, Hassim's own men, men of Wajo; and
so the lady Immada, when she had a mind to, could be carried,
after the manner of the great ladies of Wajo who need not put
foot to the ground unless they like. The lady Immada, accustomed
to the hardships that are the lot of exiles, preferred to walk,
but from time to time she let herself be carried for a short distance
out of regard for the feelings of her attendants. The party made
good time during the early hours, and Hassim expected confidently
to reach before evening the shore of the lagoon at a spot very
near the stranded Emma. At noon they rested in the shade near
a dark pool within the edge of the forest; and it was there that
Jaffir met them, much to his and their surprise. It was the occasion
of a long talk. Jaffir, squatting on his heels, discoursed in
measured tones. He had entranced listeners. The story of Carter's
exploit amongst the Shoals had not reached Belarab's camp. It
was a great shock to Hassim, but the sort of half smile with which
he had been listening to Jaffir never altered its character. It
was the Princess Immada who cried out in distress and wrung her
hands. A deep silence fell.</p>

<p>Indeed, before the fatal magnitude of the fact it seemed even
to those Malays that there was nothing to say and Jaffir, lowering
his head, respected his Prince's consternation. Then, before that
feeling could pass away from that small group of people seated
round a few smouldering sticks, the noisy approach of a large
party of men made them all leap to their feet. Before they could
make another movement they perceived themselves discovered. The
men were armed as if bound on some warlike expedition. Amongst
them Sentot, in his loin cloth and with unbound wild locks, capered
and swung his arms about like the lunatic he was. The others'
astonishment made them halt, but their attitude was obviously
hostile. In the rear a portly figure flanked by two attendants
carrying swords was approaching prudently. Rajah Hassim resumed
quietly his seat on the trunk of a fallen tree, Immada rested
her hand lightly on her brother's shoulder, and Jaffir, squatting
down again, looked at the ground with all his faculties and every
muscle of his body tensely on the alert.</p>

<p>"Tengga's fighters," he murmured, scornfully.</p>

<p>In the group somebody shouted, and was answered by shouts from
afar. There could be no thought of resistance. Hassim slipped
the emerald ring from his finger stealthily and Jaffir got hold
of it by an almost imperceptible movement. The Rajah did not even
look at the trusty messenger.</p>

<p>"Fail not to give it to the white man," he murmured. "Thy servant
hears, O Rajah. It's a charm of great power."</p>

<p>The shadows were growing to the westward. Everybody was silent,
and the shifting group of armed men seemed to have drifted closer.
Immada, drawing the end of a scarf across her face, confronted
the advance with only one eye exposed. On the flank of the armed
men Sentot was performing a slow dance but he, too, seemed to
have gone dumb.</p>

<p>"Now go," breathed out Rajah Hassim, his gaze levelled into space
immovably.</p>

<p>For a second or more Jaffir did not stir, then with a sudden
leap from his squatting posture he flew through the air and struck
the jungle in a great commotion of leaves, vanishing instantly
like a swimmer diving from on high. A deep murmur of surprise
arose in the armed party, a spear was thrown, a shot was fired,
three or four men dashed into the forest, but they soon returned
crestfallen with apologetic smiles; while Jaffir, striking an
old path that seemed to lead in the right direction, ran on in
solitude, raising a rustle of leaves, with a naked parang in his
hand and a cloud of flies about his head. The sun declining to
the westward threw shafts of light across his dark path. He ran
at a springy half-trot, his eyes watchful, his broad chest heaving,
and carrying the emerald ring on the forefinger of a clenched
hand as though he were afraid it should slip off, fly off, be
torn from him by an invisible force, or spirited away by some
enchantment. Who could tell what might happen? There were evil
forces at work in the world, powerful incantations, horrible apparitions.
The messenger of princes and of great men, charged with the supreme
appeal of his master, was afraid in the deepening shade of the
forest. Evil presences might have been lurking in that gloom.
Still the sun had not set yet. He could see its face through the
leaves as he skirted the shore of the lagoon. But what if Allah's
call should come to him suddenly and he die as he ran!</p>

<p>He drew a long breath on the shore of the lagoon within about
a hundred yards from the stranded bows of the Emma. The tide was
out and he walked to the end of a submerged log and sent out a
hail for a boat. Jorgenson's voice answered. The sun had sunk
behind the forest belt of the coast. All was still as far as the
eye could reach over the black water. A slight breeze came along
it and Jaffir on the brink, waiting for a canoe, shivered a little.</p>

<p>At the same moment Carter, exhausted by thirty hours of uninterrupted
toil at the head of whites and Malays in getting the yacht afloat,
dropped into Mrs. Travers' deck chair, on board the Hermit, said
to the devoted Wasub: "Let a good watch be kept to-night, old
man," glanced contentedly at the setting sun and fell asleep.</p>
