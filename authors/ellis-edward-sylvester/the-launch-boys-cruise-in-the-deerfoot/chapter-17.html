<p>Naturally the boys were curious to know the meaning of the stranger's
conduct. They could not see why anyone travelling the same way
with themselves should wish to avoid observation. It would seem
that he would have hurried forward for the sake of company in
this lonely region. Could it be he was really trying to keep out
of sight?</p>

<p>Chester's added explanation left no doubt on this point.</p>

<p>"It was accidental on my part. I happened to be looking at the
very point where the road makes a turn, when I caught a glimpse
of something moving on the edge of my field of vision as if coming
this way. Before I could do more than see it was a person, he
slipped to the side among the trees. That I think proves he does
not wish to be seen by us."</p>

<p>"He must have known <em>you</em> saw <em>him</em>."</p>

<p>"No; the chances were a hundred to one against either of us noticing
him, though we might have done so had he come two steps nearer.
Not doubting that he was secure, he whisked out of sight for the
time."</p>

<p>"He might have done that by leaping backward instead of sideways."</p>

<p>"I don't see any choice between the two methods. I am beginning
to suspect that for some reason he is interested in us. How is
it, Alvin, that we never had a suspicion of anything of that kind?"</p>

<p>"Because we had no reason for it."</p>

<p>"Now it would be odd if that man is the one who rested at one
end of the first bridge while we were doing the same at the other."</p>

<p>"And has been dogging us ever since. It is easy enough to find
out. Come on!"</p>

<p>Avoiding the manner of those who had detected anything amiss,
the youths faced south once more, and, neither hastening nor retarding
their pace, walked along the middle of the highway until they
had passed beyond the bend which hid them from the sight of the
individual whose actions were anything but reassuring.</p>

<p>"Now!" whispered Alvin.</p>

<p>As he spoke, he stepped into the wood on their right, his companion
doing the same. There was no undergrowth and they threaded their
way for several rods and then were unable to find a tree with
a trunk large enough to hide their bodies. Doing the best they
could, they fixed their gaze upon the highway, along which they
expected to see the man come within the succeeding few minutes.</p>

<p>An impulse led Alvin to glance at his watch just at the moment
he placed himself behind the trunk of a pine not more than six
inches in diameter. After waiting seemingly longer than necessary,
he examined his timepiece again. The minutes pass slowly to those
who are in suspense, but surely the interval ought to have brought
the stranger into view. But he was as yet invisible. A quarter
of an hour dragged by and still nothing was to be seen of him.
Alvin looked across at Chester, who was a few paces off, also
partially hidden from sight of anyone passing over the highway.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?" asked the puzzled Captain of the <em>Deerfoot</em>.</p>

<p>"How long have we been waiting?"</p>

<p>"A half hour."</p>

<p>"Then he isn't coming," said Chester, stepping forth and walking
toward the road; "we are throwing away time and it is already
growing dark."</p>

<p>On the edge of the highway the two halted and peered to the right
and left. Not a person was in sight.</p>

<p>"He has turned back," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"Why should he do that?"</p>

<p>"He must have known we saw him."</p>

<p>"More likely he dived into the wood and made a circle so as to
come back to the road between us and the inlet. He can't be far
off."</p>

<p>"He has had plenty of time to get out of sight."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not."</p>

<p>Led by the hope, the boys hastened to the next turn, which gave
them sight of a hundred yards or more before it wound out of view
again.</p>

<p>"There he is!" whispered Alvin excitedly.</p>

<p>"No; it is not he."</p>

<p>A large boy in a straw hat, with loose flapping linen duster
and bare feet was strolling toward them. He kept in the middle
of the road, for the walking was as good there as on either side.
With his hands in his trousers pockets and whistling softly to
himself he lounged forward. He started as the lads stepped out
from among the trees.</p>

<p>"Gosh! you give me a scare!" he exclaimed with a grin. "Who be
you?"</p>

<p>"Friends," Alvin took it upon himself to answer. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Henry Perkins," was the prompt response from the youth, whose
manner showed that he was not at ease.</p>

<p>"Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"Up the road, not fur, near this end of the bridge to Hodgdon
Island."</p>

<p>"Where are you coming from now?"</p>

<p>The youth hesitated a moment and then with his unrelaxing grin
answered:</p>

<p>"I spent the day with my cousin Burt Eggles over at Westport;
he rowed me across the Sheepscot, and as I told you I'm on my
way hum; if I don't arriv there purty blamed soon, the old man
will give me an all-fired licking."</p>

<p>"Did you meet anybody on the road?"</p>

<p>Henry Perkins shook his head several times.</p>

<p>"Didn't meet nobody; there ain't many folks in this part of the
kentry."</p>

<p>"Well," said Alvin, "you may go on home now; if your 'old man'
is cross with you tell him you were stopped on the road."</p>

<p>"Haw! haw! he mought ask how long I was stopped. Wal, I'm off."</p>

<p>He strode forward with long steps, as if anxious to get away
from the couple who asked such personal questions. He had gone
only a few paces when he abruptly halted, looked around at the
two, who were amusedly watching him, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Gosh! I furgot something &mdash;I'm sorry," he added, using
the catch phrase, which was beginning to take the place of the
conventional "excuse me," or "I beg pardon."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"I <em>did</em> meet a feller a little way down the road."</p>

<p>The youths were interested on the instant.</p>

<p>"Do you know who he was?" asked Alvin.</p>

<p>"Never seen him afore; didn't ask his name; don't spose he'd
told me if I had; I nodded and he nodded; neither of us didn't
speak; that's all."</p>

<p>"How was he dressed?"</p>

<p>"Had on a soft, light hat, gray suit and carried a handbag."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Henry, good night."</p>

<p>"I 'spose I was so rattled at fust I didn't think of him when
you asked me if I'd met anybody. Wal, so 'long."</p>

<p>"What do you make of it now?" asked Alvin of his chum, as they
resumed their walk toward the inlet.</p>

<p>"That's the man we saw pretending to rest at the further end
of the first bridge; he's the one who sat near us on the steamer
reading a newspaper, and he left the boat when we did. That swinging
of his hat and yelling for the steamer to come back and pick him
up was a bluff. He got off because <em>we</em> did and he has
been following us ever since."</p>

<p>Neither could doubt this self-evident fact, which was enough
to make them graver than usual.</p>

<p>The man in gray must have known from the actions of the youths
that one if not both had discovered him while he was passing over
the road behind them. He had, as Chester suspected, turned in
among the pines and made a circuit by which he came out in advance
of them. This might never have become known but for the meeting
between him and Henry Perkins.</p>

<p>But the disturbing question remained to be answered: who was
he and what did he mean by his actions?</p>

<p>"I believe he is one of the post office gang," said Alvin.</p>

<p>"So do I," assented his companion; "he knew from what we said
on the boat that we are hunting the stolen launch and he means
to be on the ground when we find it."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Aye, there's the rub; whatever it may be it doesn't mean any
good to us. We have another criminal to buck against and one that's
likely to get the best of us. I wish now that I had two revolvers
and you a repeating rifle."</p>

<p>"Wishing can do no good. We'll win if we can."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of these two young Americans that to neither
came a thought of turning back. It was more than probable that
they would run into personal peril, but none the less they cheerfully
took the risk.</p>

<p>When they reached the end of the highway which has its beginnings
on the southern point of Barter Island, it was fully dark. In
the single small house that stood there a light was burning, and
a form flitted between it and the curtain of the window.</p>

<p>"Alvin, I have just found out something," said his chum.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"I was never hungrier in my life."</p>

<p>"The same here and have been for an hour or two."</p>

<p>"Let's go in and get something to eat."</p>

<p>No railings or fence showed in front of the little faded structure
upon whose door Chester gently knocked. It was opened by an elderly
woman, who was engaged in setting the table. In answer to her
inquiring looks Chester said:</p>

<p>"Good evening! Can we buy something to eat?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; we don't sell food; we give it to them as needs it!"</p>
