<p>When I got back to my wagons after this semi-tragical interview with
that bombastic and self-seeking old windbag, Umbezi, it was to find
that Saduko and his warriors had already marched for the King’s kraal,
Nodwengu. A message awaited me, however, to the effect that it was
hoped that I would follow, in order to make report of the affair of the
destruction of the Amakoba. This, after reflection, I determined to
do, really, I think, because of the intense human interest of the whole
business. I wanted to see how it would work out.
</p>
<p>Also, in a way, I read Saduko’s mind and understood that at the moment
he did not wish to discuss the matter of his hideous disappointment.
Whatever else may have been false in this man’s nature, one thing
rang true, namely, his love or his infatuation for the girl Mameena.
Throughout his life she was his guiding star--about as evil a star as
could have arisen upon any man’s horizon; the fatal star that was to
light him down to doom. Let me thank Providence, as I do, that I was
so fortunate as to escape its baneful influences, although I admit that
they attracted me not a little.
</p><p>So, seduced thither by my curiosity, which has so often led me into
trouble, I trekked to Nodwengu, full of many doubts not unmingled with
amusement, for I could not rid my mind of recollections of the utter
terror of the “Eater-up-of-Elephants” when he was brought face to face
with the dreadful and concentrated rage of the robbed Saduko and the
promise of his vengeance. Ultimately I arrived at the Great Place
without experiencing any adventure that is worthy of record, and camped
in a spot that was appointed to me by some <u>induna</u> whose name I forget,
but who evidently knew of my approach, for I found him awaiting me at
some distance from the town. Here I sat for quite a long while, two or
three days, if I remember right, amusing myself with killing or missing
turtle-doves with a shotgun, and similar pastimes, until something
should happen, or I grew tired and started for Natal.
</p><p>In the end, just as I was about to trek seawards, an old friend, Maputa,
turned up at my wagons--that same man who had brought me the message
from Panda before we started to attack Bangu.
</p><p>“Greeting, Macumazahn,” he said. “What of the Amakoba? I see they did
not kill you.”
</p><p>“No,” I answered, handing him some snuff, “they did not quite kill me,
for here I am. What is your pleasure with me?”
</p><p>“O Macumazana, only that the King wishes to know whether you have any of
those little balls left in the box which I brought back to you, since,
if so, he thinks he would like to swallow one of them in this hot
weather.”
</p><p>I proffered him the whole box, but he would not take it, saying that the
King would like me to give it to him myself. Now I understood that this
was a summons to an audience, and asked when it would please Panda
to receive me and “the-little-black-stones-that-work-wonders.” He
answered--at once.
</p><p>So we started, and within an hour I stood, or rather sat, before Panda.
</p><p>Like all his family, the King was an enormous man, but, unlike Chaka and
those of his brothers whom I had known, one of a kindly countenance.
I saluted him by lifting my cap, and took my place upon a wooden stool
that had been provided for me outside the great hut, in the shadow of
which he sat within his isi-gohlo, or private enclosure.
</p><p>“Greeting, O Macumazana,” he said. “I am glad to see you safe and well,
for I understand that you have been engaged upon a perilous adventure
since last we met.”
</p><p>“Yes, King,” I answered; “but to which adventure do you refer--that
of the buffalo, when Saduko helped me, or that of the Amakoba, when I
helped Saduko?”
</p><p>“The latter, Macumazahn, of which I desire to hear all the story.”
</p><p>So I told it to him, he and I being alone, for he commanded his
councillors and servants to retire out of hearing.
</p><p>“Wow!” he said, when I had finished, “you are clever as a baboon,
Macumazahn. That was a fine trick to set a trap for Bangu and his
Amakoba dogs and bait it with his own cattle. But they tell me that you
refused your share of those cattle. Now, why was that, Macumazahn?”
</p><p>By way of answer I repeated to Panda my reasons, which I have set out
already.
</p><p>“Ah!” he exclaimed, when I had finished. “Every one seeks greatness in
his own way, and perhaps yours is better than ours. Well, the White man
walks one road--or some of them do--and the Black man another. They both
end at the same place, and none will know which is the right road till
the journey is done. Meanwhile, what you lose Saduko and his people
gain. He is a wise man, Saduko, who knows how to choose his friends, and
his wisdom has brought him victory and gifts. But to you, Macumazahn, it
has brought nothing but honour, on which, if a man feeds only, he will
grow thin.”
</p><p>“I like to be thin, O Panda,” I answered slowly.
</p><p>“Yes, yes, I understand,” replied the King, who, in common with most
natives, was quick enough to seize a point, “and I, too, like people who
keep thin on such food as yours, people, also, whose hands are always
clean. We Zulus trust you, Macumazahn, as we trust few white men, for we
have known for years that your lips say what your heart thinks, and
that your heart always thinks the thing which is good. You may be named
Watcher-by-Night, but you love light, not darkness.”
</p><p>Now, at these somewhat unusual compliments I bowed, and felt myself
colouring a little as I did so, even through my sunburn, but I made no
answer to them, since to do so would have involved a discussion of the
past and its tragical events, into which I had no wish to enter. Panda,
too, remained silent for a while. Then he called to a messenger to
summon the princes, Cetewayo and Umbelazi, and to bid Saduko, the son of
Matiwane, to wait without, in case he should wish to speak with him.
</p><p>A few minutes later the two princes arrived. I watched their coming with
interest, for they were the most important men in Zululand, and already
the nation debated fiercely which of them would succeed to the throne. I
will try to describe them a little.
</p><p>They were both of much the same age--it is always difficult to arrive
at a Zulu’s exact years--and both fine young men. Cetewayo, however, had
the stronger countenance. It was said that he resembled that fierce and
able monster, Chaka the Wild Beast, his uncle, and certainly I perceived
in him a likeness to his other uncle, Dingaan, Umpanda’s predecessor,
whom I had known but too well when I was a lad. He had the same surly
eyes and haughty bearing; also, when he was angry his mouth shut itself
in the same iron fashion.
</p><p>Of Umbelazi it is difficult for me to speak without enthusiasm. As
Mameena was the most beautiful woman I ever saw in Zululand--although
it is true that old war-dog, Umslopogaas, a friend of mine who does not
come into this story, used to tell me that Nada the Lily, whom I have
mentioned, was even lovelier--so Umbelazi was by far the most splendid
man. Indeed, the Zulus named him “Umbelazi the Handsome,” and no wonder.
To begin with, he stood at least three inches above the tallest of them;
from a quarter of a mile away I have recognised him by his great
height, even through the dust of a desperate battle, and his breadth
was proportionate to his stature. Then he was perfectly made, his great,
shapely limbs ending, like Saduko’s, in small hands and feet. His face,
too, was well-cut and open, his colour lighter than Cetewayo’s, and his
eyes, which always seemed to smile, were large and dark.
</p><p>Even before they passed the small gate of the inner fence it was easy
for me to see that this royal pair were not upon the best of terms,
for each of them tried to get through it first, to show his right of
precedence. The result was somewhat ludicrous, for they jammed in the
gateway. Here, however, Umbelazi’s greater weight told, for, putting out
his strength, he squeezed his brother into the reeds of the fence, and
won through a foot or so in front of him.
</p><p>“You grow too fat, my brother,” I heard Cetewayo say, and saw him scowl
as he spoke. “If I had held an assegai in my hand you would have been
cut.”
</p><p>“I know it, my brother,” answered Umbelazi, with a good-humoured laugh,
“but I knew also that none may appear before the King armed. Had it been
otherwise, I would rather have followed after you.”
</p><p>Now, at this hint of Umbelazi’s, that he would not trust his brother
behind his back with a spear, although it seemed to be conveyed in jest,
I saw Panda shift uneasily on his seat, while Cetewayo scowled even more
ominously than before. However, no further words passed between them,
and, walking up to the King side by side, they saluted him with raised
hands, calling out “Baba!”--that is, Father.
</p><p>“Greeting, my children,” said Panda, adding hastily, for he foresaw a
quarrel as to which of them should take the seat of honour on his right:
“Sit there in front of me, both of you, and, Macumazahn, do you come
hither,” and he pointed to the coveted place. “I am a little deaf in my
left ear this morning.”
</p><p>So these brothers sat themselves down in front of the King; nor were
they, I think, grieved to find this way out of their rivalry; but first
they shook hands with me, for I knew them both, though not well, and
even in this small matter the old trouble arose, since there was
some difficulty as to which of them should first offer me his hand.
Ultimately, I remember, Cetewayo won this trick.
</p><p>When these preliminaries were finished, Panda addressed the princes,
saying:
</p><p>“My sons, I have sent for you to ask your counsel upon a certain
matter--not a large matter, but one that may grow.” And he paused to
take snuff, whereon both of them ejaculated:
</p><p>“We hear you, Father.”
</p><p>“Well, my sons, the matter is that of Saduko, the son of Matiwane, chief
of the Amangwane, whom Bangu, chief of the Amakoba, ate up years ago by
leave of Him who went before me. Now, this Bangu, as you know, has for
some time been a thorn in my foot--a thorn that caused it to fester--and
yet I did not wish to make war on him. So I spoke a word in the ear of
Saduko, saying, ‘He is yours, if you can kill him; and his cattle are
yours.’ Well, Saduko is not dull. With the help of this white man,
Macumazahn, our friend from of old, he has killed Bangu and taken his
cattle, and already my foot is beginning to heal.”
</p><p>“We have heard it,” said Cetewayo.
</p><p>“It was a great deed,” added Umbelazi, a more generous critic.
</p><p>“Yes,” continued Panda, “I, too, think it was a great deed, seeing that
Saduko had but a small regiment of wanderers to back him--”
</p><p>“Nay,” interrupted Cetewayo, “it was not those eaters of rats who won
him the day, it was the wisdom of this Macumazahn.”
</p><p>“Macumazahn’s wisdom would have been of little use without the courage
of Saduko and his rats,” commented Umbelazi, and from this moment I saw
that the two brothers were taking sides for and against Saduko, as they
did upon every other matter, not because they cared for the right of
whatever was in question, but because they wished to oppose each other.
</p><p>“Quite so,” went on the King; “I agree with both of you, my sons. But
the point is this: I think Saduko a man of promise, and one who should
be advanced that he may learn to love us all, especially as his House
has suffered wrong from our House, since He-who-is-gone listened to
the evil counsel of Bangu, and allowed him to kill out Matiwane’s tribe
without just cause. Therefore, in order to wipe away this stain and
bind Saduko to us, I think it well to re-establish Saduko in the
chieftainship of the Amangwane, with the lands that his father held, and
to give him also the chieftainship of the Amakoba, of whom it seems
that the women and children, with some of the men, remain, although he
already holds their cattle which he has captured in war.”
</p><p>“As the King pleases,” said Umbelazi, with a yawn, for he was growing
weary of listening to the case of Saduko.
</p><p>But Cetewayo said nothing, for he appeared to be thinking of something
else.
</p><p>“I think also,” went on Panda in a rather uncertain voice, “in order to
bind him so close that the bonds may never be broken, it would be wise
to give him a woman of our family in marriage.”
</p><p>“Why should this little Amangwane be allowed to marry into the royal
House?” asked Cetewayo, looking up. “If he is dangerous, why not kill
him, and have done?”
</p><p>“For this reason, my son. There is trouble ahead in Zululand, and I do
not wish to kill those who may help us in that hour, nor do I wish
them to become our enemies. I wish that they may be our friends; and
therefore it seems to me wise, when we find a seed of greatness, to
water it, and not to dig it up or plant it in a neighbour’s garden. From
his deeds I believe that this Saduko is such a seed.”
</p><p>“Our father has spoken,” said Umbelazi; “and I like Saduko, who is a man
of mettle and good blood. Which of our sisters does our father propose
to give to him?”
</p><p>“She who is named after the mother of our race, O Umbelazi; she whom
your own mother bore--your sister Nandie” (in English, “The Sweet”).
</p><p>“A great gift, O my Father, since Nandie is both fair and wise. Also,
what does she think of this matter?”
</p><p>“She thinks well of it, Umbelazi, for she has seen Saduko and taken a
liking to him. She told me herself that she wishes no other husband.”
</p><p>“Is it so?” replied Umbelazi indifferently. “Then if the King commands,
and the King’s daughter desires, what more is there to be said?”
</p><p>“Much, I think,” broke in Cetewayo. “I hold that it is out of place that
this little man, who has but conquered a little tribe by borrowing
the wit of Macumazahn here, should be rewarded not only with a
chieftainship, but with the hand of the wisest and most beautiful of the
King’s daughters, even though Umbelazi,” he added, with a sneer, “should
be willing to throw him his own sister like a bone to a passing dog.”
</p><p>“Who threw the bone, Cetewayo?” asked Umbelazi, awaking out of his
indifference. “Was it the King, or was it I, who never heard of the
matter till this moment? And who are we that we should question the
King’s decrees? Is it our business to judge or to obey?”
</p><p>“Has Saduko perchance made you a present of some of those cattle which
he stole from the Amakoba, Umbelazi?” asked Cetewayo. “As our father
asks no lobola, perhaps you have taken the gift instead.”
</p><p>“The only gift that I have taken from Saduko,” said Umbelazi, who, I
could see, was hard pressed to keep his temper, “is that of his service.
He is my friend, which is why you hate him, as you hate all my friends.”
</p><p>“Must I then love every stray cur that licks your hand, Umbelazi? Oh, no
need to tell me he is your friend, for I know it was you who put it
into our father’s heart to allow him to kill Bangu and steal his cattle,
which I hold to be an ill deed, for now the Great House is thatched
with his reeds and Bangu’s blood is on its doorposts. Moreover, he who
wrought the wrong is to come and dwell therein, and for aught I know
to be called a prince, like you and me. Why should he not, since the
Princess Nandie is to be given to him in marriage? Certainly, Umbelazi,
you would do well to take the cattle which this white trader has
refused, for all men know that you have earned them.”
</p><p>Now Umbelazi sprang up, straightening himself to the full of his great
height, and spoke in a voice that was thick with passion.
</p><p>“I pray your leave to withdraw, O King,” he said, “since if I stay here
longer I shall grow sorry that I have no spear in my hand. Yet before I
go I will tell the truth. Cetewayo hates Saduko, because, knowing him
to be a chief of wit and courage, who will grow great, he sought him for
his man, saying, ‘Sit you in my shadow,’ after he had promised to sit in
mine. Therefore it is that he heaps these taunts upon me. Let him deny
it if he can.”
</p><p>“That I shall not trouble to do, Umbelazi,” answered Cetewayo, with a
scowl. “Who are you that spy upon my doings, and with a mouth full of
lies call me to account before the King? I will hear no more of it. Do
you bide here and pay Saduko his price with the person of our sister.
For, as the King has promised her, his word cannot be changed. Only let
your dog know that I keep a stick for him, if he should snarl at me.
Farewell, my Father. I go upon a journey to my own lordship, the land
of Gikazi, and there you will find me when you want me, which I pray
may not be till after this marriage is finished, for on that I will not
trust my eyes to look.”
</p><p>Then, with a salute, he turned and departed, bidding no good-bye to his
brother.
</p><p>My hand, however, he shook in farewell, for Cetewayo was always friendly
to me, perhaps because he thought I might be useful to him. Also, as I
learned afterwards, he was very pleased with me for the reason that I
had refused my share of the Amakoba cattle, and that he knew I had no
part in this proposed marriage between Saduko and Nandie, of which,
indeed, I now heard for the first time.
</p><p>“My Father,” said Umbelazi, when Cetewayo had gone, “is this to be
borne? Am I to blame in the matter? You have heard and seen--answer me,
my Father.”
</p><p>“No, you are not to blame this time, Umbelazi,” replied the King, with a
heavy sigh. “But oh! my sons, my sons, where will your quarrelling end?
I think that only a river of blood can quench so fierce a fire, and then
which of you will live to reach its bank?”
</p><p>For a while he looked at Umbelazi, and I saw love and fear in his eye,
for towards him Panda always had more affection than for any of his
other children.
</p><p>“Cetewayo has behaved ill,” he said at length; “and before a white man,
who will report the matter, which makes it worse. He has no right
to dictate to me to whom I shall or shall not give my daughters in
marriage. Moreover, I have spoken; nor do I change my word because he
threatens me. It is known throughout the land that I never change my
word; and the white men know it also, do they not, O Macumazana?”
</p><p>I answered yes, they did. Also, this was true, for, like most weak men,
Panda was very obstinate, and honest, too, in his own fashion.
</p><p>He waved his hand, to show that the subject was ended, then bade
Umbelazi go to the gate and send a messenger to bring in “the son of
Matiwane.”
</p><p>Presently Saduko arrived, looking very stately and composed as he lifted
his right hand and gave Panda the “Bayéte”--the royal salute.
</p><p>“Be seated,” said the King. “I have words for your ear.”
</p><p>Thereon, with the most perfect grace, without hurrying and without undue
delay, Saduko crouched himself down upon his knees, with one of his
elbows resting on the ground, as only a native knows how to do without
looking absurd, and waited.
</p><p>“Son of Matiwane,” said the King, “I have heard all the story of how,
with a small company, you destroyed Bangu and most of the men of the
Amakoba, and ate up their cattle every one.”
</p><p>“Your pardon, Black One,” interrupted Saduko. “I am but a boy, I did
nothing. It was Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night, who sits yonder. His
wisdom taught me how to snare the Amakoba, after they were decoyed from
their mountain, and it was Tshoza, my uncle, who loosed the cattle from
the kraals. I say that I did nothing, except to strike a blow or two
with a spear when I must, just as a baboon throws stones at those who
would steal its young.”
</p><p>“I am glad to see that you are no boaster, Saduko,” said Panda. “Would
that more of the Zulus were like you in that matter, for then I must not
listen to so many loud songs about little things. At least, Bangu was
killed and his proud tribe humbled, and, for reasons of state, I am glad
that this happened without my moving a regiment or being mixed up with
the business, for I tell you that there are some of my family who loved
Bangu. But I--I loved your father, Matiwane, whom Bangu butchered, for
we were brought up together as boys--yes, and served together in the
same regiment, the Amawombe, when the Wild One, my brother, ruled”
 (he meant Chaka, for among the Zulus the names of dead kings are
hlonipa--that is, they must not be spoken if it can be avoided).
“Therefore,” went on Panda, “for this reason, and for others, I am glad
that Bangu has been punished, and that, although vengeance has crawled
after him like a footsore bull, at length he has been tossed with its
horns and crushed with its knees.”
</p><p>“Yebo, Ngonyama!” (Yes, O Lion!) said Saduko.
</p><p>“Now, Saduko,” went on Panda, “because you are your father’s son, and
because you have shown yourself a man, although you are still little
in the land, I am minded to advance you. Therefore I give to you the
chieftainship over those who remain of the Amakoba and over all of the
Amangwane blood whom you can gather.”
</p><p>“Bayéte! As the King pleases,” said Saduko.
</p><p>“And I give you leave to become a kehla--a wearer of the
head-ring--although, as you have said, you are still but a boy, and with
it a place upon my Council.”
</p><p>“Bayéte! As the King pleases,” said Saduko, still apparently unmoved by
the honours that were being heaped upon him.
</p><p>“And, Son of Matiwane,” went on Panda, “you are still unmarried, are you
not?”
</p><p>Now, for the first time, Saduko’s face changed. “Yes, Black One,” he
said hurriedly, “but--”
</p><p>Here he caught my eye, and, reading some warning in it, was silent.
</p><p>“But,” repeated Panda after him, “doubtless you would like to be? Well,
it is natural in a young man who wishes to found a House, and therefore
I give you leave to marry.”
</p><p>“Yebo, Silo!” (Yes, O Wild Beast!) “I thank the King, but--”
</p><p>Here I sneezed loudly, and he ceased.
</p><p>“But,” repeated Panda, “of course, you do not know where to find a wife
between the time the hawk stoops and the rat squeaks in its claws. How
should you who have never thought of the matter? Also,” he continued,
with a smile, “it is well that you have not thought of it, since she
whom I shall give to you could not live in the second hut in your kraal
and call another ‘Inkosikazi’ [that is, head lady or chieftainess].
Umbelazi, my son, go fetch her of whom we have thought as a bride for
this boy.”
</p><p>Now Umbelazi rose, and went with a broad smile upon his face, while
Panda, somewhat fatigued with all his speech-making--for he was very
fat and the day was very hot--leaned his head back against the hut and
closed his eyes.
</p><p>“O Black One! O thou who consumeth with rage! [Dhlangamandhla]” broke
out Saduko, who, I could see, was much disturbed. “I have something to
say to you.”
</p><p>“No doubt, no doubt,” answered Panda drowsily, “but save up your thanks
till you have seen, or you will have none left afterwards,” and he
snored slightly.
</p><p>Now I, perceiving that Saduko was about to ruin himself, thought it well
to interfere, though what business of mine it was to do so I cannot say.
At any rate, if only I had held my tongue at this moment, and allowed
Saduko to make a fool of himself, as he wished to do--for where Mameena
was concerned he never could be wise--I verily believe that all the
history of Zululand would have run a different course, and that many
thousands of men, white and black, who are now dead would be alive
to-day. But Fate ordered it otherwise. Yes, it was not I who spoke, but
Fate. The Angel of Doom used my throat as his trumpet.
</p><p>Seeing that Panda dozed, I slipped behind Saduko and gripped him by the
arm.
</p><p>“Are you mad?” I whispered into his ear. “Will you throw away your
fortune, and your life also?”
</p><p>“But Mameena,” he whispered back. “I would marry none save Mameena.”
</p><p>“Fool!” I answered. “Mameena has betrayed and spat upon you. Take what
the Heavens send you and give thanks. Would you wear Masapo’s soiled
blanket?”
</p><p>“Macumazahn,” he said in a hollow voice, “I will follow your head, and
not my own heart. Yet you sow a strange seed, Macumazahn, or so you may
think when you see its fruit.” And he gave me a wild look--a look that
frightened me.
</p><p>There was something in this look which caused me to reflect that I might
do well to go away and leave Saduko, Mameena, Nandie, and the rest of
them to “dree their weirds,” as the Scotch say, for, after all, what was
my finger doing in that very hot stew? Getting burnt, I thought, and not
collecting any stew.
</p><p>Yet, looking back on these events, how could I foresee what would be the
end of the madness of Saduko, of the fearful machinations of Mameena,
and of the weakness of Umbelazi when she snared him in the net of her
beauty, thus bringing about his ruin, through the hate of Saduko and the
ambition of Cetewayo? How could I know that, at the back of all these
events, stood the old dwarf, Zikali the Wise, working night and day
to slake the enmity and fulfil the vengeance which long ago he had
conceived and planned against the royal House of Senzangakona and the
Zulu people over whom it ruled?
</p><p>Yes, he stood there like a man behind a great stone upon the brow of
a mountain, slowly, remorselessly, with infinite skill, labour, and
patience, pushing that stone to the edge of the cliff, whence at length,
in the appointed hour, it would thunder down upon those who dwelt
beneath, to leave them crushed and no more a people. How could I guess
that we, the actors in this play, were all the while helping him to push
that stone, and that he cared nothing how many of us were carried with
it into the abyss, if only we brought about the triumph of his secret,
unutterable rage and hate?
</p><p>Now I see and understand all these things, as it is easy to do, but then
I was blind; nor did the Voices reach my dull ears to warn me, as, how
or why I cannot tell, they did, I believe, reach those of Zikali.
</p><p>Oh, what was the sum of it? Just this, I think, and nothing more--that,
as Saduko and the others were Mameena’s tools, and as all of them and
their passions were Zikali’s tools, so he himself was the tool of some
unseen Power that used him and us to accomplish its design. Which, I
suppose, is fatalism, or, in other words, all these things happened
because they must happen. A poor conclusion to reach after so much
thought and striving, and not complimentary to man and his boasted
powers of free will; still, one to which many of us are often driven,
especially if we have lived among savages, where such dramas work
themselves out openly and swiftly, unhidden from our eyes by the veils
and subterfuges of civilisation. At least, there is this comfort
about it--that, if we are but feathers blown by the wind, how can the
individual feather be blamed because it did not travel against, turn or
keep back the wind?
</p><p>Well, let me return from these speculations to the history of the facts
that caused them.
</p><p>Just as--a little too late--I had made up my mind that I would go after
my own business, and leave Saduko to manage his, through the fence
gateway appeared the great, tall Umbelazi leading by the hand a woman.
As I saw in a moment, it did not need certain bangles of copper,
ornaments of ivory and of very rare pink beads, called infibinga, which
only those of the royal House were permitted to wear, to proclaim her
a person of rank, for dignity and high blood were apparent in her face,
her carriage, her gestures, and all that had to do with her.
</p><p>Nandie the Sweet was not a great beauty, as was Mameena, although
her figure was fine, and her stature like that of all the race of
Senzangakona--considerably above the average. To begin with, she was
darker in hue, and her lips were rather thick, as was her nose; nor were
her eyes large and liquid like those of an antelope. Further, she lacked
the informing mystery of Mameena’s face, that at times was broken and
lit up by flashes of alluring light and quick, sympathetic perception,
as a heavy evening sky, that seems to join the dim earth to the dimmer
heavens, is illuminated by pulsings of fire, soft and many-hued,
suggesting, but not revealing, the strength and splendour that it veils.
Nandie had none of these attractions, which, after all, anywhere upon
the earth belong only to a few women in each generation. She was a
simple, honest-natured, kindly, affectionate young woman of high birth,
no more; that is, as these qualities are understood and expressed among
her people.
</p><p>Umbelazi led her forward into the presence of the King, to whom she
bowed gracefully enough. Then, after casting a swift, sidelong glance at
Saduko, which I found it difficult to interpret, and another of inquiry
at me, she folded her hands upon her breast and stood silent, with bent
head, waiting to be addressed.
</p><p>The address was brief enough, for Panda was still sleepy.
</p><p>“My daughter,” he said, with a yawn, “there stands your husband,” and
he jerked his thumb towards Saduko. “He is a young man and a brave, and
unmarried; also one who should grow great in the shadow of our House,
especially as he is a friend of your brother, Umbelazi. I understand
also that you have seen him and like him. Unless you have anything to
say against it, for as, not being a common father, the King receives no
cattle--at least in this case--I am not prejudiced, but will listen to
your words,” and he chuckled in a drowsy fashion. “I propose that
the marriage should take place to-morrow. Now, my daughter, have you
anything to say? For if so, please say it at once, as I am tired. The
eternal wranglings between your brethren, Cetewayo and Umbelazi, have
worn me out.”
</p><p>Now Nandie looked about her in her open, honest fashion, her gaze
resting first on Saduko, then on Umbelazi, and lastly upon me.
</p><p>“My Father,” she said at length, in her soft, steady voice, “tell me, I
beseech you, who proposes this marriage? Is it the Chief Saduko, is it
the Prince Umbelazi, or is it the white lord whose true name I do not
know, but who is called Macumazahn, Watcher-by-Night?”
</p><p>“I can’t remember which of them proposed it,” yawned Panda. “Who can
keep on talking about things from night till morning? At any rate, I
propose it, and I will make your husband a big man among our people.
Have you anything to say against it?”
</p><p>“I have nothing to say, my Father. I have met Saduko, and like him
well--for the rest, you are the judge. But,” she added slowly, “does
Saduko like me? When he speaks my name, does he feel it here?” and she
pointed to her throat.
</p><p>“I am sure I do not know what he feels in his throat,” Panda replied
testily, “but I feel that mine is dry. Well, as no one says anything,
the matter is settled. To-morrow Saduko shall give the umqoliso [the
Ox of the Girl], that makes marriage--if he has not got one here I will
lend it to him, and you can take the new, big hut that I have built in
the outer kraal to dwell in for the present. There will be a dance, if
you wish it; if not, I do not care, for I have no wish for ceremony just
now, who am too troubled with great matters. Now I am going to sleep.”
</p><p>Then sinking from his stool on to his knees, Panda crawled through the
doorway of his great hut, which was close to him, and vanished.
</p><p>Umbelazi and I departed also through the gateway of the fence, leaving
Saduko and the Princess Nandie alone together, for there were no
attendants present. What happened between them I am sure I do not
know, but I gather that, in one way or another, Saduko made himself
sufficiently agreeable to the princess to persuade her to take him to
husband. Perhaps, being already enamoured of him, she was not difficult
to persuade. At any rate, on the morrow, without any great feasting or
fuss, except the customary dance, the umqoliso, the “Ox of the Girl,”
 was slaughtered, and Saduko became the husband of a royal maiden of the
House of Senzangakona.
</p><p>Certainly, as I remember reflecting, it was a remarkable rise in life
for one who, but a few months before, had been without possessions or a
home.
</p><p>I may add that, after our brief talk in the King’s kraal, while Panda
was dozing, I had no further words with Saduko on this matter of his
marriage, for between its proposal and the event he avoided me, nor did
I seek him out. On the day of the marriage also, I trekked for Natal,
and for a whole year heard no more of Saduko, Nandie, and Mameena;
although, to be frank, I must admit I thought of the last of these
persons more often, perhaps, than I should have done.
</p><p>The truth is that Mameena was one of those women who sticks in a man’s
mind even more closely than a “Wait-a-bit” thorn does in his coat.
