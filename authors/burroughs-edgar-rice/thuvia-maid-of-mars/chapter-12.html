<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Thuvia of Ptarth, battling for more than life against
the lust of Jav, cast a quick glance over her shoulder
toward the forest from which had rumbled the fierce growl.
Jav looked, too.
<P>
What they saw filled each with apprehension.  It was
Komal, the banth-god, rushing wide-jawed upon them!
<P>
Which had he chosen for his prey?  Or was it to be both?
<P>
They had not long to wait, for though the Lotharian
attempted to hold the girl between himself and the
terrible fangs, the great beast found him at last.
<P>
Then, shrieking, he attempted to fly toward Lothar,
after pushing Thuvia bodily into the face of the man-eater.
But his flight was of short duration.  In a moment Komal
was upon him, rending his throat and chest with demoniacal fury.
<P>
The girl reached their side a moment later, but it was
with difficulty that she tore the mad beast from its prey.
Still growling and casting hungry glances back upon Jav,
the banth at last permitted itself to be led away into the wood.
<P>
With her giant protector by her side Thuvia set forth
to find the passage through the cliffs, that she might
attempt the seemingly impossible feat of reaching far-
distant Ptarth across the more than seventeen thousand
haads of savage Barsoom.
<P>
She could not believe that Carthoris had deliberately
deserted her, and so she kept a constant watch for him;
but as she bore too far to the north in her search for
the tunnel she passed the Heliumite as he was returning
to Lothar in search of her.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth was having difficulty in determining
the exact status of the Prince of Helium in her heart.
She could not admit even to herself that she loved him,
and yet she had permitted him to apply to her that
term of endearment and possession to which a Barsoomian
maid should turn deaf ears when voiced by other
lips than those of her husband or fiance--"my princess."
<P>
Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to whom she was
affianced, commanded her respect and admiration.
Had it been that she had surrendered to her father's
wishes because of pique that the handsome Heliumite had
not taken advantage of his visits to her father's court to
push the suit for her hand that she had been quite sure
he had contemplated since that distant day the two had
sat together upon the carved seat within the gorgeous
Garden of the Jeddaks that graced the inner courtyard
of the palace of Salensus Oll at Kadabra?
<P>
Did she love Kulan Tith?  Bravely she tried to believe
that she did; but all the while her eyes wandered
through the coming darkness for the figure of a clean-
limbed fighting man--black-haired and grey-eyed.  Black
was the hair of Kulan Tith; but his eyes were brown.
<P>
It was almost dark when she found the entrance to the tunnel.
Safely she passed through to the hills beyond, and here,
under the bright light of Mars' two moons, she halted
to plan her future action.
<P>
Should she wait here in the hope that Carthoris
would return in search of her?  Or should she continue
her way north-east toward Ptarth?  Where, first, would
Carthoris have gone after leaving the valley of Lothar?
<P>
Her parched throat and dry tongue gave her the answer--
toward Aaanthor and water.  Well, she, too, would go
first to Aaanthor, where she might find more than
the water she needed.
<P>
With Komal by her side she felt little fear, for he
would protect her from all other savage beasts.
Even the great white apes would flee the mighty banth
in terror.  Men only need she fear, but she must take
this and many other chances before she could hope to
reach her father's court again.
<P>
When at last Carthoris found her, only to be struck
down by the long-sword of a green man, Thuvia prayed
that the same fate might overtake her.
<P>
The sight of the red warriors leaping from their fliers had,
for a moment, filled her with renewed hope--hope that Carthoris
of Helium might be only stunned and that they would rescue him;
but when she saw the Dusarian metal upon their harness,
and that they sought only to escape with her alone from
the charging Torquasians, she gave up.
<P>
Komal, too, was dead--dead across the body of the Heliumite.
She was, indeed, alone now.  There was none to protect her.
<P>
The Dusarian warriors dragged her to the deck of the
nearest flier.  All about them the green warriors surged
in an attempt to wrest her from the red.
<P>
At last those who had not died in the conflict gained
the decks of the two craft.  The engines throbbed and
purred--the propellers whirred.  Quickly the swift boats
shot heavenward.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth glanced about her.  A man stood near,
smiling down into her face.  With a gasp of recognition
she looked full into his eyes, and then with a little
moan of terror and understanding she buried her face in
her hands and sank to the polished skeel-wood deck.  It
was Astok, Prince of Dusar, who bent above her.
<P>
Swift were the fliers of Astok of Dusar, and great the
need for reaching his father's court as quickly as possible,
for the fleets of war of Helium and Ptarth and Kaol were
scattered far and wide above Barsoom.  Nor would it go
well with Astok or Dusar should any one of them discover
Thuvia of Ptarth a prisoner upon his own vessel.
<P>
Aaanthor lies in fifty south latitude, and forty east of
Horz, the deserted seat of ancient Barsoomian culture and
learning, while Dusar lies fifteen degrees north of the
equator and twenty degrees east from Horz.
<P>
Great though the distance is, the fliers covered it
without a stop.  Long before they had reached their
destination Thuvia of Ptarth had learned several things
that cleared up the doubts that had assailed her mind for
many days.  Scarce had they risen above Aaanthor than
she recognized one of the crew as a member of the crew
of that other flier that had borne her from her father's
gardens to Aaanthor.  The presence of Astok upon the
craft settled the whole question.  She had been stolen by
emissaries of the Dusarian prince--Carthoris of Helium
had had nothing to do with it.
<P>
Nor did Astok deny the charge when she accused him.
He only smiled and pleaded his love for her.
<P>
"I would sooner mate with a white ape!" she cried,
when he would have urged his suit.
<P>
Astok glowered sullenly upon her.
<P>
"You shall mate with me, Thuvia of Ptarth," he
growled, "or, by your first ancestor, you shall have
your preference--and mate with a white ape."
<P>
The girl made no reply, nor could he draw her into
conversation during the balance of the journey.
<P>
As a matter of fact Astok was a trifle awed by the
proportions of the conflict which his abduction of the
Ptarthian princess had induced, nor was he over
comfortable with the weight of responsibility which the
possession of such a prisoner entailed.
<P>
His one thought was to get her to Dusar, and there let his
father assume the responsibility.  In the meantime he would
be as careful as possible to do nothing to affront her,
lest they all might be captured and he have to account
for his treatment of the girl to one of the great jeddaks
whose interest centred in her.
<P>
And so at last they came to Dusar, where Astok hid his
prisoner in a secret room high in the east tower of
his own palace.  He had sworn his men to silence in the
matter of the identity of the girl, for until he had seen
his father, Nutus, Jeddak of Dusar, he dared not let any
one know whom he had brought with him from the south.
<P>
But when he appeared in the great audience chamber
before the cruel-lipped man who was his sire, he found
his courage oozing, and he dared not speak of the princess
hid within his palace.  It occurred to him to test his
father's sentiments upon the subject, and so he told
a tale of capturing one who claimed to know the
whereabouts of Thuvia of Ptarth.
<P>
"And if you command it, Sire," he said, "I will go and
capture her--fetching her here to Dusar."
<P>
Nutus frowned and shook his head.
<P>
"You have done enough already to set Ptarth and
Kaol and Helium all three upon us at once should they
learn your part in the theft of the Ptarth princess.
That you succeeded in shifting the guilt upon the Prince of
Helium was fortunate, and a masterly move of strategy;
but were the girl to know the truth and ever return to her
father's court, all Dusar would have to pay the penalty,
and to have her here a prisoner amongst us would be an
admission of guilt from the consequences of which naught
could save us.  It would cost me my throne, Astok, and that
I have no mind to lose.
<P>
"If we had her here--" the elder man suddenly
commenced to muse, repeating the phrase again and again.
"If we had her here, Astok," he exclaimed fiercely.
"Ah, if we but had her here and none knew that she was here!
Can you not guess, man?  The guilt of Dusar might be for ever
buried with her bones," he concluded in a low, savage whisper.
<P>
Astok, Prince of Dusar, shuddered.
<P>
Weak he was; yes, and wicked, too; but the suggestion
that his father's words implied turned him cold with horror.
<P>
Cruel to their enemies are the men of Mars; but the
word "enemies" is commonly interpreted to mean men only.
Assassination runs riot in the great Barsoomian cities;
yet to murder a woman is a crime so unthinkable that
even the most hardened of the paid assassins would shrink
from you in horror should you suggest such a thing to him.
<P>
Nutus was apparently oblivious to his son's all-too-patent
terror at his suggestion.  Presently he continued:
<P>
"You say that you know where the girl lies hid,
since she was stolen from your people at Aaanthor.
Should she be found by any one of the three powers,
her unsupported story would be sufficient to turn
them all against us.
<P>
"There is but one way, Astok," cried the older man.
"You must return at once to her hiding-place and
fetch her hither in all secrecy.  And, look you here!
Return not to Dusar without her, upon pain of death!"
<P>
Astok, Prince of Dusar, well knew his royal father's temper.
He knew that in the tyrant's heart there pulsed no single
throb of love for any creature.
<P>
Astok's mother had been a slave woman.  Nutus had never
loved her.  He had never loved another.  In youth he had
tried to find a bride at the courts of several of his
powerful neighbours, but their women would have none of him.
<P>
After a dozen daughters of his own nobility had sought
self-destruction rather than wed him he had given up.
And then it had been that he had legally wed one of his
slaves that he might have a son to stand among the jeds
when Nutus died and a new jeddak was chosen.
<P>
Slowly Astok withdrew from the presence of his father.
With white face and shaking limbs he made his way to his
own palace.  As he crossed the courtyard his glance
chanced to wander to the great east tower looming high
against the azure of the sky.
<P>
At sight of it beads of sweat broke out upon his brow.
<P>
Issus!  No other hand than his could be trusted to
do the horrid thing.  With his own fingers he must crush
the life from that perfect throat, or plunge the silent
blade into the red, red heart.
<P>
Her heart!  The heart that he had hoped would brim
with love for him!
<P>
But had it done so?  He recalled the haughty contempt
with which his protestations of love had been received.
He went cold and then hot to the memory of it.  His
compunctions cooled as the self-satisfaction of a near
revenge crowded out the finer instincts that had for a
moment asserted themselves--the good that he had inherited
from the slave woman was once again submerged in the
bad blood that had come down to him from his royal
sire; as, in the end, it always was.
<P>
A cold smile supplanted the terror that had dilated his
eyes.  He turned his steps toward the tower.  He would see
her before he set out upon the journey that was to blind
his father to the fact that the girl was already in Dusar.
<P>
Quietly he passed in through the secret way, ascending
a spiral runway to the apartment in which the Princess of
Ptarth was immured.
<P>
As he entered the room he saw the girl leaning upon
the sill of the east casement, gazing out across the roof
tops of Dusar toward distant Ptarth.  He hated Ptarth.
The thought of it filled him with rage.  Why not finish
her now and have it done with?
<P>
At the sound of his step she turned quickly toward him.
Ah, how beautiful she was!  His sudden determination
faded beneath the glorious light of her wondrous beauty. 
He would wait until he had returned from his little
journey of deception--maybe there might be some other
way then.  Some other hand to strike the blow--with
that face, with those eyes before him, he could never do it.
Of that he was positive.  He had always gloried in the
cruelty of his nature, but, Issus! he was not that cruel.
No, another must be found--one whom he could trust.
<P>
He was still looking at her as she stood there before
him meeting his gaze steadily and unafraid.  He felt 
the hot passion of his love mounting higher and higher.
<P>
Why not sue once more?  If she would relent, all might
yet be well.  Even if his father could not be persuaded,
they could fly to Ptarth, laying all the blame of the knavery
and intrigue that had thrown four great nations into war,
upon the shoulders of Nutus.  And who was there that
would doubt the justice of the charge?
<P>
"Thuvia," he said, "I come once again, for the last
time, to lay my heart at your feet.  Ptarth and Kaol
and Dusar are battling with Helium because of you.
Wed me, Thuvia, and all may yet be as it should be."
<P>
The girl shook her head.
<P>
"Wait!" he commanded, before she could speak.
"Know the truth before you speak words that may seal,
not only your own fate, but that of the thousands of
warriors who battle because of you.
<P>
"Refuse to wed me willingly, and Dusar would be laid
waste should ever the truth be known to Ptarth and Kaol
and Helium.  They would raze our cities, leaving not one
stone upon another.  They would scatter our peoples
across the face of Barsoom from the frozen north to the
frozen south, hunting them down and slaying them,
until this great nation remained only as a hated memory
in the minds of men.
<P>
"But while they are exterminating the Dusarians,
countless thousands of their own warriors must perish--
and all because of the stubbornness of a single woman
who would not wed the prince who loves her.
<P>
"Refuse, Thuvia of Ptarth, and there remains but a
single alternative--no man must ever know your fate.
Only a handful of loyal servitors besides my royal father
and myself know that you were stolen from the gardens of
Thuvan Dihn by Astok, Prince of Dusar, or that to-day
you be imprisoned in my palace.
<P>
"Refuse, Thuvia of Ptarth, and you must die to save Dusar--
there is no other way.  Nutus, the jeddak, has so decreed.
I have spoken."
<P>
For a long moment the girl let her level gaze rest full
upon the face of Astok of Dusar.  Then she spoke, and
though the words were few, the unimpassioned tone
carried unfathomable depths of cold contempt.
<P>
"Better all that you have threatened," she said, "than you."
<P>
Then she turned her back upon him and went to stand
once more before the east window, gazing with sad
eyes toward distant Ptarth.
<P>
Astok wheeled and left the room, returning after a
short interval of time with food and drink.
<P>
"Here," he said, "is sustenance until I return again.
The next to enter this apartment will be your executioner.
Commend yourself to your ancestors, Thuvia of Ptarth,
for within a few days you shall be with them."
<P>
Then he was gone.
<P>
Half an hour later he was interviewing an officer high
in the navy of Dusar.
<P>
"Whither went Vas Kor?" he asked.  "He is not at his palace."
<P>
"South, to the great waterway that skirts Torquas,"
replied the other.  "His son, Hal Vas, is Dwar of
the Road there, and thither has Vas Kor gone to
enlist recruits among the workers on the farms."
<P>
"Good," said Astok, and a half-hour more found him
rising above Dusar in his swiftest flier.
