<p>She was uneasy, perturbed to her last fibre.  She wanted to remain
clear, with no touch on her.  A wild instinct made her shrink away
from any hands which might be laid on her.</p>

<p>She was a foundling, probably of some gipsy race, brought up in a
Roman Catholic Rescue Home.  A na&iuml;ve, paganly religious being, she
was attached to the Baroness, with whom she had served for seven
years, since she was fourteen.</p>

<p>She came into contact with no one, unless it were with Ida Hesse,
the governess.  Ida was a calculating, good-natured, not very
straight-forward flirt.  She was the daughter of a poor country
doctor.  Having gradually come into connection with Emilie, more an
alliance than an attachment, she put no distinction of grade
between the two of them.  They worked together, sang together,
walked together, and went together to the rooms of Franz Brand,
Ida's sweetheart.  There the three talked and laughed together, or
the women listened to Franz, who was a forester, playing on his
violin.</p>

<p>In all this alliance there was no personal intimacy between the
young women.  Emilie was naturally secluded in herself, of a
reserved, native race.  Ida used her as a kind of weight to balance
her own flighty movement.  But the quick, shifty governess,
occupied always in her dealings with admirers, did all she could to
move the violent nature of Emilie towards some connection with men.</p>

<p>But the dark girl, primitive yet sensitive to a high degree, was
fiercely virgin.  Her blood flamed with rage when the common
soldiers made the long, sucking, kissing noise behind her as she
passed.  She hated them for their almost jeering offers.  She was
well protected by the Baroness.</p>

<p>And her contempt of the common men in general was ineffable.  But
she loved the Baroness, and she revered the Baron, and she was at
her ease when she was doing something for the service of a
gentleman.  Her whole nature was at peace in the service of real
masters or mistresses.  For her, a gentleman had some mystic
quality that left her free and proud in service.  The common
soldiers were brutes, merely nothing.  Her desire was to serve.</p>

<p>She held herself aloof.  When, on Sunday afternoon, she had looked
through the windows of the Reichshalle in passing, and had seen the
soldiers dancing with the common girls, a cold revulsion and anger
had possessed her.  She could not bear to see the soldiers taking
off their belts and pulling open their tunics, dancing with their
shirts showing through the open, sagging tunic, their movements
gross, their faces transfigured and sweaty, their coarse hands
holding their coarse girls under the arm-pits, drawing the female
up to their breasts.  She hated to see them clutched breast to
breast, the legs of the men moving grossly in the dance.</p>

<p>At evening, when she had been in the garden, and heard on the other
side of the hedge the sexual inarticulate cries of the girls in the
embraces of the soldiers, her anger had been too much for her, and
she had cried, loud and cold:</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing there, in the hedge?&quot;</p>

<p>She would have had them whipped.</p>

<p>But Bachmann was not quite a common soldier.  Fr&auml;ulein Hesse had
found out about him, and had drawn him and Emilie together.  For he
was a handsome, blond youth, erect and walking with a kind of
pride, unconscious yet clear.  Moreover, he came of a rich farming
stock, rich for many generations.  His father was dead, his mother
controlled the moneys for the time being.  But if Bachmann wanted a
hundred pounds at any moment, he could have them.  By trade he,
with one of his brothers, was a waggon-builder.  The family had the
farming, smithy, and waggon-building of their village.  They worked
because that was the form of life they knew.  If they had chosen,
they could have lived independent upon their means.</p>

<p>In this way, he was a gentleman in sensibility, though his
intellect was not developed.  He could afford to pay freely for
things.  He had, moreover, his native, fine breeding.  Emilie
wavered uncertainly before him.  So he became her sweetheart, and
she hungered after him.  But she was virgin, and shy, and needed to
be in subjection, because she was primitive and had no grasp on
civilized forms of living, nor on civilized purposes.</p>
