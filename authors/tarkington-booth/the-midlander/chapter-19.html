<p><em>HARLAN </em>laughed ruefully and told her that time, tide,
and travel failed to alter her. "You don’t change as much as—as
much as"—he looked about him for a comparison, and found one ready
to hand in the material of which the Shelbys’ veranda was made.
"You don’t change as much as this Western limestone does. It’s
made of stone, too, but years and weather take its edges off and
give it the look of being not so hard as it used to be."</p>

<p>Not defending herself from the criticism, she gazed thoughtfully
at Harlan as he sat fanning himself with his straw hat—he was
warm and flushed after their walk on this hot June morning—then
she turned her eyes again to the wide lawn stretching before her
down to the National Avenue sidewalk. Looking out from the shade
of the veranda, her eyes needed the shelter of the curved fingers
of her hand, a protection she gave them, resting her elbow on
the stone railing beside her. The trimmed grass of the lawn was
a blazing green, seen waveringly through visible pulsations of
the heated air; the fountain swan, still diligent under every
discouragement, sprayed forth no skyward rainbow mists, but ejected
a limpid rod of water of so brief an uplift that the bird seemed
to carry in his throat the curved tip of a shepherd’s crook made
of glass. The asphalt street, beyond the shade of its bordering
maples, lay steaming and smelled of tar;—drooping bicyclists rode
there, tinkling their little bells for a right of way. Surreys
and phaetons gave them courteous passage, and frequently a swifter,
noisier vehicle went by, grinding, squawking, and leaving blue
oil-smoke on the air.</p>

<p>There were many more automobiles than when she had last gone
away, Martha noticed; yet the outlook from the veranda was the
old familiar one. To her eyes, however, it bore the familiar unfamiliar
appearance that well-known things bear to the traveller at home
again, but not yet quite adjusted after a long absence. For this
was not her return from the little run she had made to England
at the time of the baby’s christening next door, though that excursion
was itself a longer one—much to her taste—than she had planned.
The bit of old hickory serving her as a father resisted stiffly,
but finally proved flexible under great pressure, and she took
him even to Russia before she got through bending him. When his
protestive squeakings at last became unbearable, she brought him
home, but did not remain herself. In the Italian Alps there was
a valley town with which she had fallen in love;—she returned
to her native land merely as an escort for Mr. Shelby, and, having
deposited him safely, hurried back to the terraced vineyards,
the whitewashed walls with strings of red peppers dangling against
them, and the frescoed old villa she had rented in the foreground
of this picture.</p>

<p>It was a commonplace, she said, that the new Twentieth Century
was the age of the annihilation of distances; people talked from
New York to Chicago over a wire; the Atlantic was crossed in six
days, the American continent in four; and her father could remember
when it took him three weeks to get to Philadelphia; he "wouldn’t
mind being taken care of by correspondence."</p>

<p>Old Hickory, well-warranted in his outburst, replied that he
didn’t "need any takin’ care of, thank you"—he was tired of being
bossed to death, and he wanted her to understand she was mighty
welcome to go and stay as long as she had a mind to! If she remained
at home, he wouldn’t know when she might be draggin’ him off again
without his exactly knowin’ how it happened. It was "curious,"
he continued; he had sense enough never to let her interfere with
him in his business; but in other matters he never knew when he
mightn’t find himself in some dog-gone place he didn’t <em>want</em>
to be in—at a plague-taken pink tea maybe, or even right spang
in the middle of Europe in some heaven-forsaken garlic heap, with
nothin’ to think about but old dead monks and nothin’ to do but
hate the smell. If Martha liked hangin’ around those old worn-out
nations that never showed a sign o’ life except advertisin’ chocolate
and keepin’ their fertilizer right under their front parlour window
for fear somebody’d steal it, why, she was certainly good and
welcome to all she wanted of ’em! For himself, he had his business
to ’tend to; and he didn’t want any aunt Ella to pester him, either;
"aunt Ella" being his widowed sister, whom Martha had proposed
as a housekeeper in substitute for herself. He was full and able—thank
you again!—to get up in the morning and eat his ham and eggs without
somebody’s pinning a bib around his neck, and he believed he knew
how to wash and go to bed at night without any fussy woman fixin’
up his bureau every other day, so as to hide his nightshirts from
him! Altogether, he was lookin’ forward to a little rest and liberty,
thank you!</p>

<p>So Martha had gone with his earnest consent; for his complaint
of her did not lack reason—she was headstrong and a compelling
daughter—and she stayed until she had her fill of Italy for that
while. Meantime, the abandoned father contentedly lived alone,
except for his negro servants, and declared that at last he was
his own man and began to feel as if he owned his own house; he
felt that way for the first time since his daughter was born,
he said. But a different view of his condition was maintained
by a member of the household next door.</p>

<p>"A fine exhibition of filial duty!" Lena cried, in one of the
irritated moods that returned upon her as the growing Henry Daniel
began to be a little boy instead of a little baby. When he was
a noisy little boy during the day his mother often became reminiscent,
not happily, by the time his father came home in the evening.
"You told me once she had a heart as big as she was," Lena went
on. "It looks like it, doesn’t it? Leaving that poor old man alone
over there, month after month and year after year!"</p>

<p>Dan listened absently, his mind on a new customer for a lot.
"Who you talkin’ about now?"</p>

<p>"You know! That big girl of yours."</p>

<p>"Martha?" he said, his tone a weary one instantly. "How often
have I told you she never was any girl of mine, big or little?
What’s started you on <em>that</em> again?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t think you’d expect it would take much to start me,"
Lena exclaimed, "when you remember you gave me your sacred promise
I should have a year in Europe——"</p>

<p>"Oh, Lordy! Have we got to go all over that again?"</p>

<p>"—And when you remember you deliberately broke your word to me,"
Lena went on, "and haven’t ever even made the slightest effort
to keep it! You hold me here, suffocating in this place, year
after year——"</p>

<p>"Now, see here," he interrupted; "just think a minute, please!
Is that fair? Haven’t you been back to New York every year for
at least two or three——"</p>

<p>But Lena almost shouted her interruption. "Yes! Two or three
<em>weeks</em>! To visit my <em>fam_ily! Do you think it means
happiness for me to be with _them</em>?—and all of ’em watching
to see how I take care of my baby! Is that keeping your word to
take me abroad? Oh," she cried, with bitter laughter, "doesn’t
it seem ironical even to you? That big creature next door was
so jealous of me because I had what she wanted she couldn’t bear
to stay where she had to look at it, so she goes away and gets
what <em>I</em> wanted! <em>Isn’t</em> it ironical, Dan? Don’t
you see it at all?"</p>

<p>"I see you’ve got your imagination all stirred up again, that’s
all."</p>

<p>"Imagination!" she cried. "Yes; I should think my imagination
<em>would</em> get ‘all stirred up!’ Why, it’s funny! She can
go and take what I want, but it can’t be any good to her; she
hasn’t culture enough to see it or to feel it or to hear it. I
can see her carrying that accent around Europe, and asking waiters
for ‘ice wat-urr’ and ‘please to pass the but-urr!’ Yet she can
go and I can’t!"</p>

<p>"But <em>I</em> didn’t send her," Dan explained, since his wife
clearly implied his responsibility. "You talk as if I——"</p>

<p>"No; but you had no right not to send <em>me</em> after giving
me your sacred——"</p>

<p>Dan interrupted her genially; he smiled and patted her pretty
little shoulder, though it twitched away from his touch. "Lena,
look here: I’ve got some big deals on, and I’m just about certain
they’re goin’ to work out the right way. You see up to now the
trouble’s been that all the money comin’ in had to be put right
out again almost before I’d get hold of it. If it hadn’t been
for that, I’d had that factory up and running long ago. But as
I look ahead now, everything is mighty good—<em>mighty</em> good!
If I can just put these deals through——"</p>

<p>"Yes; it’s always ‘if,’" she reminded him. "When have I ever
talked to you that you weren’t just about to put through some
‘mighty big deals’? You said exactly the same last year."</p>

<p>"Well, but this is a better year than last year. Why, I’ve done
twice the business—yes, better’n that; it’s more like four times
what I did last year. If Ornaby keeps on like this, why, a few
years from now——"</p>

<p>She stopped him; informing him that she’d long since heard more
than enough about "a few years from now"; whereupon, being full
of the subject, he went down to the library to tell his father
and mother what was inevitable within a few years. No skepticism
dampened his library prophecies now; Harlan was no longer there
to listen, staring with dry incredulity through his glasses.</p>

<p>Harlan had not sold Mrs. Savage’s old house, but had moved into
it, and kept as precise a routine there as she had kept, and with
the same servants. He had two bedrooms upstairs made into a library,
but changed nothing on the lower floor; and often the old lady
seemed still to be there in authority. At twilight, before Nimbus
lit the electric table lamp in the "south front parlour," the
room to which she had always descended from her afternoon nap,
it was not difficult to imagine that she was sitting in the stiff
chair beside the plate-glass window. Of course Nimbus believed
that he saw her there when he came in to light the lamp; and he
often mumbled to her—always upon the same theme. He was grateful
for the one hundred and thirty-five dollars she had left him,
but considered the sum inadequate.</p>

<p>"No’m, indeed," he said to the figure he saw in the stiff chair.
"I thank you kindly, but didn’ I used you right all my days? How
much it cost you slip down ten hunderd thirty-five on that paper,
’stead of one hunderd thirty-five? <em>You</em> ain’t got it,
are you? Ain’t doin’ <em>you</em> no good, do it? No’m, indeedy!
’Tain’t no use you bein’ sorry, neither. Make all the fuss you
want to; you too late; nobody ain’t goin’ pay no ’tention to you!"</p>

<p>And in the kitchen he would discuss the apparition with his fourth
wife, the fat cook, Myrtle. "Look to me like she can’t keep away,"
he would say. "Set there same as ever. Set up straight in that
stiff chair. See her plain as I see you, till I git that lamp
lit."</p>

<p>"Landy me, Nimbus, I wouldn’ go in that room unlessen the light
bright as day if you give me trottin’ horse an’ gole harniss!
How you keep from hollerin’?"</p>

<p>At this the tall, thin old fellow would laugh without making
a sound; deep wrinkles in the design of half of a symmetrical
cobweb appearing on each side of his face. Some profoundly interior
secret of his might have been betrayed, it seemed, if he had allowed
his merriment to become vocal; and this noiseless laugh of his
awed his wife in much the same way, no doubt, that the laugh of
a jungle witch-doctor ancestor of his had awed wives not unlike
Myrtle. "She ain’t goin’ bother me ner you," he explained. "She
ain’t settin’ there ’count o’ me ner you. She settin’ there ’cause
she so mad."</p>

<p>"Who? Who she mad at?"</p>

<p>"Mad at somep’m!" Nimbus would say, and, becoming less uncomfortably
mystic might allow a human chuckle to escape him. "Set there mad
long as she want to; ’tain’t goin’ do her no good. She ain’t <em>fixed</em>
to make no changes now!"</p>

<p>The new owner lived in the old house almost as quietly as Mrs.
Savage, in the visions of Nimbus, went on living there. Harlan
had several times thought of going to Italy, but the idea never
culminated in action.</p>

<p>"I wanted to come, though," he told Martha, as they sat on her
veranda that hot morning, the day after her return. "I wanted
to more than I ever wanted to do anything else. You see I’ve almost
stopped going to the office; I just dangle about there sometimes
to please father, but I don’t care to practise law. It’s a silly
way of spending one’s life after all, fighting the sordid disputes
of squabbling people. There was really nothing to keep me here."</p>

<p>She did not alter her attitude, but still looked out upon the
old familiar unfamiliar scene from beneath her sheltering curved
fingers. "If you wanted to come, why didn’t you?"</p>

<p>"Because I’d only have done it to see you, and I suppose I have
a remnant of pride. If you’d like a better answer, think of what
I told you about yourself. I didn’t come because I know you’re
stony. I knew you hadn’t changed."</p>

<p>"About what?"</p>

<p>"About me," he said, and added: "About anything!"</p>

<p>At this she turned her head and looked at him, for he spoke with
a sour significance. "Well, have you changed, Harlan?" she asked
gravely.</p>

<p>"About you," he answered. "I haven’t—unfortunately."</p>

<p>"But I meant: Have <em>you</em> changed about anything? Aren’t
you just what you were five or six years ago, only a little intensified—and
richer?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I knew I’d get that," he said. "I knew it would come before
I could be with you long. I told my father and mother the very
day my grandmother’s will was read that you’d hate me for it,
and mother agreed quickly enough."</p>

<p>"Why, no," Martha said, and her surprise was genuine. "Why should
I hate you because Mrs. Savage——"</p>

<p>"Because she left it to me and not to Dan, and because I didn’t
think it was right or sensible to help him with any of it."</p>

<p>"But he hasn’t needed any help," Martha said. "It’s much better
for him to be doing it without any help, and so splendidly."</p>

<p>"So splendidly?" Harlan repeated, and he stared at her. "But
you don’t take what Dan says seriously, do you? You don’t think
that just because he says——"</p>

<p>"I haven’t seen him, Harlan."</p>

<p>"But you speak as if you believe he’s actually succeeding in
making that old fantasia of his into a reality."</p>

<p>"Well," she said, "isn’t he?"</p>

<p>"What? Why, he’s still just barely keeping his head above water.
He sells vacant lots out there, yes—but to keep on selling them
he has to put all they sell for into developing the land he hasn’t
sold. It amounts precisely to the same thing as giving the property
away. His mortgages used to worry him to death, but he’s got most
of the place mortgaged now for three times what it was five years
ago. You see——"</p>

<p>"I see that the land must be worth three times as much as it
was five years ago, since he can borrow three times as much on
it."</p>

<p>"But, my dear Martha——"</p>

<p>"But, my dear Harlan!" she echoed mockingly, and thus disposed
of his argument before he could deliver it. "The truth is, you’ve
had the habit of undervaluing Dan so long that you can’t get over
it. You can’t see that at last he’s begun to make a success of
his ‘fantasia.’ Given time enough, critics who aren’t careful
to keep themselves humble-minded always lose the power to see
things as they are."</p>

<p>Harlan winced a little under this sententious assault, and laughed
at himself for wincing; then explained his rather painful laughter.
"It’s almost amusing to me to find myself still cowering away
from your humble-minded criticisms of me—just as I used to, Martha!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it," she admitted. "I hate myself for the way I
talk to you, Harlan;—somehow you always make me smug and superior.
I’m the foolish kind of person who’s always made critical by superior
criticism—critical of the critic, I mean."</p>

<p>"But I’m not more critical of Dan than other people are. Have
you asked your father what he thinks of Ornaby now, for instance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I asked him last night."</p>

<p>"What does he think of it?"</p>

<p>"He thinks the same as I do," she said. "He’s been compelled
to recognize that it’s going to be a tremendous success."</p>

<p>"Then he’s changed his mind since last week," Harlan returned,
somewhat discomfited. "He told me——"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know," she said. "He didn’t say he thought it would
be a success. He said he thought the Addition idea was just as
crazy as he ever did, and Dan Oliphant was the biggest fool in
seven states, and the noisiest! Those were his words precisely,
Harlan."</p>

<p>"But you just told me——"</p>

<p>"No," she explained;—"you asked me what he <em>thought</em>.
Do you suppose he’d admit to me that he ever made a business mistake?
He knows perfectly well that he did make one when he refused to
follow my advice and buy some of Dan’s stock when the poor boy
was trying to finance his plan at the beginning. Papa confessed
it absolutely."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," she replied. "If he’d meant what he said he’d just
have grunted it. Instead, he yelled it at me. With papa, that’s
exactly the same as a perfectly open confession."</p>

<p>Harlan shook his head, remaining more than doubtful of this interpretation.
"So you believe if Dan tried now to organize a stock company for
Ornaby——"</p>

<p>"They’d gobble it!" she said. "Papa especially! But he and others
like him wouldn’t buy a single share when poor Dan went begging
and peddling all over town; and now I’m glad they didn’t. It’s
so much better for him to have done it alone."</p>

<p>"But, my dear," Harlan insisted, not altogether without exasperation,
"he <em>hasn’t</em> done it."</p>

<p>"My dear," she returned promptly; "he’s <em>going</em> to!"</p>

<p>"But, Martha——"</p>

<p>"Listen," she said. "I’ll tell you something that you don’t understand,
because you’ve been living here all along. When I went off to
college, I spent the Christmas holidays visiting some Eastern
girls, and papa didn’t see me for a whole year. Then he nearly
fainted—I’d grown so! Yet I’d grown just as much the year before,
but he never noticed it because I was living at home where he
saw me every day. It’s the same way with a city like this, Harlan.
I haven’t been here for so long that I can see the change. Everything
is going to happen that Dan prophesied."</p>

<p>She had spoken with gravity, but Harlan laughed, not impressed.
"Yes, the boosters brag of the increase in population shown by
the last census," he said. "We’ve got a few thousand more Italians
and Polish Jews and negroes, I suppose; and some new ugly factories
and dwelling-houses of objectionable architecture. They’re beginning
to build awful little shacks they call ‘bungalows,’ hurrying them
up by the dozen. Is that the glorious cosmopolis of your hero’s
prophecies, Martha? To my mind it’s only an extension of hideousness,
and down where I live, in my grandmother’s old house, it’s getting
so smoky in winter that the air is noxious—the whole town’s dirty,
for that matter."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "Yesterday, as soon as I got here, I noticed
that even in summer the air’s smokier than it used to be. I think
the city was a cleaner place and a better-looking place when I
went away. There’s the smoke, of course, and I’ve already seen
how they’re beginning to tear old buildings down and put up bigger
ones, and no building has any thought of having the slightest
relation to the ones on each side of it. In a way, as you say,
it’s getting hideous, though some of these long, wide streets
are pleasant, even to a person who’s stayed in Europe too long
perhaps—and National Avenue is really beautiful. I don’t know
where except in towns like this you’ll find a long street of such
big, solid, comfortable houses with green trees and clean lawns
about them. This part of the town, at least, hasn’t changed; but
a change has begun, and I believe it’s the growth—I think it’s
the incredible growth that Dan predicted, Harlan. I think it’s
begun."</p>

<p>Again she had spoken gravely, though with a glinting look at
him which had in it some hint of triumph, and piqued him.</p>

<p>"Well, if this fabulous growth <em>has</em> begun," he said incautiously,
"you’re surely not hero-worshipper enough to think it’s going
to extend as far as Ornaby Addition, are you?"</p>

<p>She had hoped for this, had led him into it. "Papa’s going to
begin building an extension of the Tennessee Avenue car line next
month," she said. "I forced him to admit how far out it would
run."</p>

<p>"Not so far as the Addition?"</p>

<p>"Within an eighth of a mile of it," said Martha. "That’s what
made him so noisy!" </p>
