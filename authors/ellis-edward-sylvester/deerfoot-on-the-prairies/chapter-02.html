<p>IT was inevitable that, during the weeks and months spent by
Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la together, they talked often and long about
the journey to the Northwest. At night in the depth of the forest,
by the crackling camp-fire, or when lolling in the cavern home
of the young Shawanoe, it was the one theme in which both, and
especially the younger, was absorbingly interested.</p>

<p>You need hardly be reminded that a hundred years ago the immense
territory west of the Mississippi was an unknown region. Teeming
to-day with a bustling, progressive people numbering millions,
covered with large cities and towns, grid-ironed by railways,
honeycombed with mines, humming with industry, and the seat of
future empire, it was at the opening of the nineteenth century
a vast solitude, the home of the wild Indian and wild animal.</p>

<p>A few daring hunters and trappers had penetrated for a little
way into the "Louisiana Purchase," and they carried on a disjointed
barter with the red men, but the fragmentary knowledge brought
back by them scarcely pierced the shell of general ignorance.
Captains Lewis and Clark had not yet made their famous journey
across the continent, but they were getting ready to do so, for
President Jefferson’s heart was wrapped up in developing the largest
real estate transaction ever made.</p>

<p>It may be said that Deerfoot pumped the Blackfoot dry. Had that
enterprising traveler kept a diary of his journeyings and experiences
from the time he and his companion started eastward, it would
not have told the Shawanoe more than he gained from his friend
by his continuous questioning. Deerfoot traced with a pencil on
a sheet of paper a rude map of the western country, based wholly
on the information gained from his guest. He made many changes
and corrections before he completed and filed it away, as may
be said, for future use.</p>

<p>Several important facts were thus established, and these you
must bear in mind in order to understand the incidents I have
set out to relate.</p>

<p>In the first place, the home of the Blackfeet Indians a century
ago was not to the westward but on the east of the Rocky Mountains,
as it is to-day. In order to reach the Pacific Coast one had to
climb over that great range and enter the country of the Flatheads
and numerous other tribes. Mul-tal-la had proved his enterprise
as an explorer by doing this several years previous to making
his longer journey to the eastward.</p>

<p>When Mul-tal-la left home he and his companion rode southward
until well into the present State of Colorado. Then they turned
east, passing through what is now Kansas and Missouri, crossing
the Mississippi and entering the fringe of civilization, for they
were fairly within the Northwest Territory organized a number
of years before.</p>

<p>Deerfoot planned to take this route in reverse. Where the Blackfoot
was impressed by everything he saw, he had retained an excellent
recollection of the route, and this knowledge was sure to be of
great help to Deerfoot and his friends. The course to be followed
may be roughly outlined thus:</p>

<p>A little to the north of Woodvale the party would turn westward,
crossing the present States of Indiana and Illinois to St. Louis.
Thence they would follow the course of the Missouri to where it
makes its abrupt bend northward. At that point they intended to
leave it and push westward until the time came to head due north
and make for the Blackfoot country. This in a general way was
the route upon which took place most of the incidents recorded
in the following pages.</p>

<p>When the border settlement dropped out of sight, the company
fell into what may be called the line of march. Deerfoot was in
the lead, next rode the Blackfoot, then Zigzag the pack horse,
and last George Shelton, with Victor bringing up the rear. The
rule was to advance in Indian file except when they reached the
plains, where the topography permitted them to bunch together.
In fact this lining out of the horsemen was necessary most of
the time, for the trails used by them did not allow two to ride
abreast. However, it permitted free conversation, so long as there
was no necessity for silence.</p>

<p>Deerfoot led the way over a well-marked trail which was familiar
to him, for he had traversed it often by day and by night. As
was his custom at such times, he rode for hours without speaking
a syllable. There was no call for this, but it was his habit.
He heard the chat of the boys to the rear, George continually
turning his head to address or listen to his brother. Deerfoot
did not care, for no danger threatened any of them, and he was
pleased that the couple, especially Victor, were in such overflowing
spirits.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot showed the same peculiarity as the leader, and
which it may be said is characteristic of the American race—that
of silence and reserve when on the march, even while there is
perfect freedom to converse. The Shawanoe would not have objected
had his friends called to him, but they did not do so.</p>

<p>At the end of half an hour the trail, which led directly through
the woods, became so level and open that Deerfoot struck his horse
into a gentle trot. Bug did the same, but Zigzag did not seem
to think it was expected of him, and continued plodding forward
at his usual sluggish gait. The load, however, which he carried
was not burdensome, and George Shelton shouted to him in so startling
a voice that Zigzag broke into a trot so vigorous that it threatened
to displace his pack. It is not impossible that the animal was
planning for that, but the burden had been secured too well to
fall.</p>

<p>Suddenly Zigzag swerved to the right and pushed among the trees.
A sharp order from George brought him back, and then he displayed
a tendency to wabble to the left. To convince him that no nonsense
would be permitted, George galloped nigh enough to deliver a resounding
whack on his haunch with the stock of his gun. After that Zigzag
conducted himself properly.</p>

<p>"It seems strange, George," said Victor, as well as his jolting
horse would permit, "that only a few months ago we were in danger
of our lives in this very place, and now we needn’t have the least
fear."</p>

<p>"All due to Deerfoot," replied George; "the whole cause of the
trouble was Red Wolf, when he started to climb that rope and it
broke with him; that also broke up the plotting; with their leader
gone they had no heart to try anything further in that line."</p>

<p>"I spoke to Deerfoot about it, and he says the cause was more
than that. Tecumseh means well, and is determined to make his
warriors keep the treaty of Greenville. He did not know all the
mischief Red Wolf was up to, and was in a fury when he learned
it. About that time, too, Tecumseh got a hint from Governor Harrison
through Simon Kenton that no more such doings would be tolerated,
and he took the hint. No harm would come to us if we rode alone
into any of the Shawanoe or Miami or Wyandot villages. But," added
Victor, "I’d feel a good deal better to have Deerfoot with us."</p>

<p>"He’ll be as much a stranger as we after we get out of this country."</p>

<p>"Still he’s an Indian and knows better than anyone else how to
handle those of his race. Mul-tal-la is sure to be of good service,
too."</p>

<p>"Have you any idea how long we shall be gone?"</p>

<p>"No; and I don’t care. I feel as if I should like to spend several
years on the other side of the Mississippi."</p>

<p>"You’ll get homesick before that. I had a talk with Deerfoot
last night and found he doesn’t expect to start on the return
before next spring."</p>

<p>"Will it take us as long as that to reach the Blackfoot country?"</p>

<p>"Of course not, but Deerfoot means to look upon the Pacific Ocean
before he comes back, and that, as he figures it, is about a thousand
miles beyond the Blackfoot country. According to what Mul-tal-la
says, the biggest mountains in the world lie just west of his
country, and we have got to climb over or get through them some
way. What do you think of the plan?"</p>

<p>"It tickles me half to death. I wonder whether Deerfoot would
care if I threw up my hat and yelled."</p>

<p>"I’m sure I don’t know."</p>

<p>"Well, here goes, anyway!"</p>

<p>And what did the irrepressible youth do but fling his cap a dozen
feet above his head and emit a whoop of which Tecumseh would not
have been ashamed. Both Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la looked wonderingly
around, and each smiled. The Shawanoe’s smile grew broader when
Victor made a grasp to catch his cap as it came down, but missed
it and it fell to the earth.</p>

<p>"Plague take it!" exclaimed the lad, slipping out of the saddle
without stopping his horse, and running back to recover his headgear.</p>

<p>While he was doing so Deerfoot emitted a war-whoop himself, and
struck the heels of his moccasins against the ribs of Simon, who
instantly broke into a gallop. Bug was hardly a moment behind
him, and Zigzag, for a wonder, caught the infection. George saw
what their leader was up to, and he pretended he could not restrain
his own horse. The shouts he sent out while seeming to do his
best frightened Jack into a gallop, and Prince proved that he
did not mean to be left behind.</p>

<p>Thus when Victor had snatched his cap from the ground, replaced
it on his head and turned to trot the necessary few paces, he
saw the whole line in a gallop, with his own horse several rods
in advance of him.</p>

<p>"Whoa! Plague take you! Whoa! Don’t you hear me?" shouted the
indignant lad, breaking into a desperate run.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that all the animals as well as their
riders heard the command, which was loud enough to penetrate the
woods for half a mile. Prince being the nearest, surely must have
noted the order, but he seemed to think that, inasmuch as the
horses ahead of him increased their speed, it was proper for him
to do the same. At any rate he did it, and succeeded so well that
his owner saw the space widening between them.</p>

<p>By this time Victor knew that Deerfoot was at the bottom of it
all. No man can do his best when laughing or shouting, and the
pursuer ceased his call and bent all his energies to overtaking
the fleeing horses. He thought the leader would soon show some
consideration for him and slacken his pace, but the Shawanoe seemed
to be stern and unsympathizing that forenoon, for he maintained
the gallop, with the others doing the same, and the task of the
running youngster loomed up as impossible.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t do to get mad and sulk, for no one would pay any
attention to him—least of all Deerfoot, who liked fun as well
as anybody. Besides, the exercise promised to do the youth a world
of good.</p>

<p>But fortune came to his relief when least expected. Victor had
traveled this trail so often that he knew it almost as well as
Deerfoot. He remembered it made a sharp curve to the left not
far in advance. When he caught sight of the young Shawanoe, therefore,
calmly galloping around the bend, the lad dived among the trees
and sped at a reckless rate.</p>

<p>"They ain’t so smart as they think they are! I’ll beat ’em yet—confound
it!"</p>

<p>He thought surely his head had been lifted from his shoulders,
for at that moment a projecting maple limb, not quite as high
as his crown, slipped under his chin and almost hoisted him off
his feet. He speedily found he was intact and had suffered little
more than a shock to his feelings. He was quickly at it again
and soon caught sight of Deerfoot rising and sinking with the
motion of his horse and the others stringing behind him.</p>

<p>A moment later Victor leaped into the trail, recoiling just enough
to let the leader pass him as he stood. But Deerfoot reined up
and stared at him as if in wonder.</p>

<p>"Does my brother love to wander in the woods that he should leave
his saddle?" was the innocent query of the dusky wag.</p>

<p>"You think you know a good deal, don’t you? Wait till I get a
chance; I’ll pay you for this," was the half-impatient answer.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is so scared by the words of his brother that he may
fall off his horse," said the Shawanoe with mock alarm. "Will
he not forgive Deerfoot because he did not stop when he heard
his brother crying behind him?"</p>

<p>"You go on. I’ll catch you one of these days and make you sorry."</p>

<p>With an expression of grief Deerfoot started forward again, his
horse on a walk. Those behind had also stopped, and they now resumed
the journey. The Shawanoe kept his eye to the rear until he saw
Victor was in the saddle again, when his pace immediately rose
to a trot and all were quickly jogging forward as before.</p>

<p>George tried to look sympathetic, but he could not, and his brother
saw his shoulders shaking with laughter as he rode on, not daring
to trust himself to speak. By this time the impulsive Victor had
rallied from his partial anger, and decided that the best thing
to do was to join in the general good-nature and merriment over
his mishap.</p>

<p>Noon came and passed, but Deerfoot showed no intention of going
into camp. He humored the animals by dropping to a walk. They
were allowed to drink several times from the small streams crossed,
and occasionally were given a breathing spell of fifteen or twenty
minutes. The Shawanoe knew how to treat their kind and did not
press them too hard. When these long pauses were made the riders
dismounted, lolled at the side of the trail, talked together,
but neither Deerfoot nor Mul-tal-la made reference to food for
themselves, and the boys were too proud to hint anything of their
hunger.</p>

<p>When the afternoon was well advanced the party came to an open
space, crossed near the middle by a sparkling brook, which issued
from under some mossy rocks to the right. Early as was the season,
there was considerable growth of succulent grass, which offered
the best kind of nourishment for the horses. Deerfoot announced
that they would spend the night in this place, and, leaping from
the back of Simon, plunged into the wood in quest of game, of
which they had had more than one glimpse while on the road.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Blackfoot and the boys relieved Zigzag of his load,
removed the other saddle and bridles, and devoted themselves to
gathering wood for the night. With such an abundance on every
hand this was a light task. When the leaves were heaped up, with
a mass of dry twigs loosely arranged on top and larger sticks
above them, George Shelton took out the sun-glass which had been
presented to him by one of his neighbors. The sun was still high
enough for him to catch a few of the rays and concentrate them
upon the leaves, which speedily broke into a smoking flame that
soon spread into a roaring fire. The method was not much superior,
after all, to the old-fashioned flint and steel, but the instrument
was new so far as the present owner was concerned, and he liked
to use it.</p>

<p>One of the most treasured presents to Victor was a good spyglass
that had been used by one of General Wayne’s officers throughout
the Revolutionary War, and afterward in the Indian campaigns in
the West. The lad had not found a good chance as yet to employ
it, but when its power was explained to Mul-tal-la he was delighted
and declared it would prove beyond value to them while crossing
the plains, and he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>The fire was no more than fairly going when the report of Deerfoot’s
rifle sounded not far off in the woods. No one was surprised,
for game was plenty, though it was not the most favorable season,
and it was safe to rely upon the dusky youth for an unfailing
supply of food whenever it could possibly be secured.</p>

<p>When a few minutes later Deerfoot came in sight he was carrying
a big wild turkey, from which he had torn the feathers, plucked
the inedible portions, and washed the rest in the clear water
of the brook. All that remained to do was to broil the meat over
the fire and coals as soon as they were ready.</p>

<p>Aunt Dinah had expressed an ardent wish to stow among the bundles
of the packhorse some specimens of her best cookery in the way
of bread and cake, but the brothers protested so vigorously that
there was neither need nor room for anything of that kind that
she refrained. There was, however, considerable salt, pepper and
other condiments, though neither tea nor coffee.</p>

<p>Deerfoot broiled the turkey without help from the others. It
was cut into pieces which he toasted on green sticks skewered
through them, turned over in front of the blaze and laid for a
few minutes over the blazing coals. When the first piece was ready
he passed it to Victor.</p>

<p>"That’s ’cause he feels remorse for his meanness towards me,"
reflected the lad, sprinkling salt on the juicy flesh and then
sinking his sharp incisors into it, realizing, as many a youngster
has realized before and since, that the best sauce for any sort
of food is hunger.</p>

<p>The next portion went to George, the third to Mul-tal-la, and
last of all Deerfoot provided for himself. This was his invariable
rule, and all his friends knew it so well that they never protested.</p>

<p>Water was brought from the brook in one of the tin cups with
which they were furnished, and all made a nourishing and palatable
meal.</p>

<p>The last mouthful had been masticated to a pulp and swallowed
when Deerfoot, without a word, rose gravely to his feet and walked
to where the big pack of Zigzag lay. The corners of the huge parcel
had been gathered, and were tied over the middle with big knots.
Under these was so large a gap that Deerfoot readily thrust in
his hand without undoing the fastening. Fumbling around for several
minutes he brought out a goodly sized package wrapped about with
coarse brown paper.</p>

<p>Every eye was upon him, for all were wondering what he was seeking
and had found. He carefully unwrapped the paper and then took
from within something about a foot in diameter, of circular shape,
three or four inches in thickness, and bulging upward in the middle.
It was of a dark-brown color, the interior so full of richness
that it had burst the crust in one or two places and, pushing
outward, gave a glimpse of the slightly browned wealth within.
Raising the object in one hand, Deerfoot broke off a piece, whose
craggy sides were of a golden yellow, creamy and light as a feather.
Then the others identified it.</p>

<p>It was a "sugar cake," specially prepared by Dinah, and in mixing
and baking it she had excelled herself. It certainly was a triumph
of skill, and, despite the meal just finished, the sight of the
delicious richness—with which the brothers had become familiar
many a time—made their mouths water.</p>

<p>Deerfoot acted as if nobody else was in the neighborhood. Having
broken off the golden spongy chunk, he lifted it to his mouth,
and it was a wonder how fast it disappeared. The Shawanoe certainly
had a sweet tooth, for his eyes sparkled as he munched the soft
delicacy. In a minute or two the first segment vanished, and he
instantly set to work on the second, meanwhile looking longingly
at the mangled original, as if grudging the time he had to wait
before disposing of that.</p>

<p>"Well, did you ever?" whispered Victor. "Aunt Dinah made that
on purpose for him, and we were dunces enough not to take what
she offered us."</p>

<p>Neither of the boys was unjust enough to attribute the salute
which the young Shawanoe gave the colored woman to this cause,
for they knew that was impossible, but it was a sight, nevertheless,
to see the fellow place himself outside of the cake. When it was
about one-fourth gone he seemed to become aware that he had companions.
Looking up as if in astonishment, he broke and divided the major
portion between the boys. Some was offered to the Blackfoot, but
he shook his head. He had never tasted of such food, and, if he
knew his own heart, never would give it a chance at his interior
organization.</p>
