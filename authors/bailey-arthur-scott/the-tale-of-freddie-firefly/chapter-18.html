<p>Now, when Benjamin Bat spoke of his doing Farmer Green a good turn,
Freddie Firefly looked puzzled.
</p>
<p>"What has Farmer Green ever done for me?" he inquired.
</p><p>"What has he done?" Benjamin cried. "Hasn't he furnished you a fine
meadow in which to dance at night? And doesn't he let you come here in
his dooryard whenever you please? I should think THAT was something to
be thankful for!"
</p><p>"Now that you speak of it, I don't know but that you're right," Freddie
Firefly admitted, "though I never thought of such a thing before." And
not wishing to be ungrateful to Farmer Green, he promptly put out his
light.
</p><p>Of course, that was just what Benjamin was waiting for. And since he
could see perfectly in the dark, without a moment's warning he rushed
straight at Freddie Firefly, with his mouth wide open.
</p><p>If Freddie hadn't happened to flash his light just at that moment he
would never have flashed it again.
</p><p>As soon as Benjamin Bat saw the greenish-white gleam he was so afraid of
getting burned--not knowing that Freddie's light could not harm him--he
was so afraid that he swerved sharply to one side and zigzagged about
the yard for a few seconds.
</p><p>But he soon returned to speak to Freddie Firefly once more.
</p><p>"You made a good beginning," he told Freddie. "But you turned your light
on again too quickly. Just keep dark until I tell you to shine, and with
a little practice you'll be able to do the trick very well. And Farmer
Green will certainly be pleased. Now, just try it again!"
</p><p>But Freddie Firefly could not forget how terrible Benjamin had looked a
few moments before. And he began to suspect that Benjamin Bat was
playing a trick of his own.
</p><p>"It seems to me," said Freddie, "that you are a little too anxious about
Farmer Green."
</p><p>"Oh! no, indeed!" Benjamin Bat declared. "Farmer Green is a fine man.
He's a great friend of mine. He furnishes me a whole tree near the
swamp, in which I sleep every day. If you passed that way any time
between dawn and sunset you could see me hanging by my heels from one of
the branches."
</p><p>"Just where is your tree?" Freddie Firefly inquired.
</p><p>Having no idea that Freddie could do him the slightest harm, Benjamin
Bat explained that his special, favorite tree was a great cedar, which
stood close to the old bridge that crossed Black Creek, at the lower end
of the swamp.
</p><p>"I know where that is; and I'll go over there to-morrow and take a look
at you," Freddie Firefly remarked.
</p><p>"Do!" said Benjamin Bat.
</p><p>"And I'll bring Solomon Owl with me," Freddie added. "For I know he'd
like to see you, too."
</p><p>"Don't!" cried Benjamin Bat. "Oh, don't do that!"
</p><p>"What's the matter?" Freddie Firefly asked Benjamin Bat. "Why don't you
want me to fetch Solomon Owl to your tree, to see you hanging by your
heels when you're fast asleep?"
</p><p>"Solomon Owl is no friend of mine," Benjamin Bat explained with a
shudder. "He'd eat me in a minute, if he could catch me."
