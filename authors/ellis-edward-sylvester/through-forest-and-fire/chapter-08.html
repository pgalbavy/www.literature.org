<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the very edge of the bridge over Shark Creek, the mother of
Nellie Ribsam picked up the lunch basket which her daughter had
taken to school that morning. It lay on its side, with the snowy
napkin partly out, and within it was a piece of brown bread which
the parent had spread with golden butter, and which was partly
eaten.</p>

<p>No wonder the afflicted woman uttered a half-suppressed scream
when she picked up what seemed a memento of her dead child.</p>

<p>While the lanterns were held in a circle around the basket, which
the father took from his wife, Mr. Ribsam lifted the piece of
bread in his hand. There were the prints made by the strong white
teeth of little Nellie, and there was not a dry eye when all gazed
upon the food, which the father softly returned to the basket
and reverently covered with the napkin.</p>

<p>No one ventured to speak, but the thoughts of all were the same.</p>

<p>Stepping to the railing at the side of the bridge Mr. Layton
held his lantern over, Nick and Mr. Kilgore immediately doing
the same. The rays extended right and left and far enough downward
to reach the stream, which could be seen, dark and quiet, flowing
beneath and away through the woods to the big pond, a quarter
of a mile below.</p>

<p>In the oppressive stillness the soft rustling of the water was
heard as it eddied about a small root which grew out from the
shore, and a tiny fish, which may have been attracted by the yellow
rays, leaped a few inches above the surface and fell back with
a splash which startled those who were peering over the railing
of the structure.</p>

<p>The trees grew close to the water's edge, and as the trunks were
dimly revealed they looked as if they were keeping watch over
the deep creek that flowed between.</p>

<p>The five were now searching for that which they did not wish
to find; they dreaded, with an unspeakable dread, the sight of
the white face turned upward, with the abundant hair floating
about the dimpled shoulders.</p>

<p>Thank heaven, that sight was spared them; nothing of the kind
was seen, and a sigh escaped from each.</p>

<p>"We are all tortured by the thought that Nellie has fallen into
the creek and been drowned," said the teacher; "but I cannot see
any grounds for such fear."</p>

<p>The yearning looks of the parents and brother caused the teacher
to explain more fully.</p>

<p>"No child, unless a very stupid one, would stumble from this
bridge, and there could have been no circumstances which in my
judgment would have brought such a mishap to Nellie."</p>

<p>This sounded reasonable enough, but:</p>

<p>"De basket,&mdash;vot of dot?" asked the father.</p>

<p>"She has dropped that from some cause; but that of itself is
a favorable sign, for had she fallen accidentally into the water
she would have taken it with her."</p>

<p>This sounded as if true, but it did not remove the fears of any
one. Even he who uttered the words could not bring himself fully
to believe in their truth, for none knew better than he that the
evil one himself seems to conspire with guns and pistols that
appear to be unloaded, and with water which is thought to be harmless.</p>

<p>All wanted to place faith in the declaration, and no protest
was uttered. As nothing was to be seen or learned where they stood,
they crossed the bridge and descended the wooded slope until they
reached the edge of the stream, which wound its way through the
woods to the big pond.</p>

<p>Every heart was throbbing painfully and no one spoke: there was
no need of it, for no comfort could be gained therefrom.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton and Kilgore moved carefully up the creek, while Nick
and his parents walked toward the pond, which lay to the left.</p>

<p>The two wished to be apart from the others that they might consult
without danger of being overheard by those whose hearts were suffering
so much anguish.</p>

<p>"It's very strange," said Mr. Kilgore, "that the basket should
be found on the bridge: what do you make of it, Mr. Layton?"</p>

<p>The teacher shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is strange, indeed; had there been no water in the creek
you could have set it down as certain that the child had not fallen
from it, but, as she could not have done so without drowning,
I am inclined to think&mdash;"</p>

<p>The instructor hesitated, as if afraid to pronounce the dreadful
words.</p>

<p>"You think she is drowned?" said his friend, supplying the answer
with his own question.</p>

<p>Mr. Layton nodded his head by way of reply, and, holding the
lanterns in front, they began groping their way along the margin
of the creek.</p>

<p>By raising the lights above their heads the rays reached the
opposite bank, lighting up the water between. This was unusually
clear, and they could see the bottom some distance from shore.</p>

<p>Both felt that if the body was floating anywhere they could not
fail to see it, though the probabilities were that it was already
far below them, and would be first discovered by the parents and
brother.</p>

<p>"Halloa!" suddenly exclaimed Mr. Layton, lowering his lantern
close to the ground, "I don't like <em>that</em>."</p>

<p>By way of explanation, he pointed to the damp soil where no vegetation
grew: it was directly in front and close to the water, being that
portion which was frequently swept by the creek when above its
present level.</p>

<p>Parallel to the stream, for a distance of several rods or so,
were a number of imprints in the yielding earth, which the first
glance showed were made by some large animal.</p>

<p>"It must have been a dog," ventured the teacher, who had little
practical knowledge of the animals of the wood.</p>

<p>Mr. Kilgore shook his head.</p>

<p>"It was a bear; there can be no mistake about it. Mr. Marston
was right; it was the track of a similar animal which he saw last
March."</p>

<p>"You are not mistaken, Mr. Kilgore?"</p>

<p>The farmer answered impatiently:</p>

<p>"I have hunted bears too often to be mistaken; I can tell their
trail among a hundred others, and the one which went along here
a little while ago was one of the largest of his kind."</p>
