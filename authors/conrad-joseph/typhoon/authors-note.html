<p>Far as the mariner on highest mast Can see all around upon the
calmed vast, So wide was Neptune's hall . . . &mdash; <em>KEATS</em></p>

<p>The main characteristic of this volume consists in this, that
all the stories composing it belong not only to the same period
but have been written one after another in the order in which
they appear in the book.</p>

<p>The period is that which follows on my connection with Blackwood's
Magazine. I had just finished writing "The End of the Tether"
and was casting about for some subject which could be developed
in a shorter form than the tales in the volume of "Youth" when
the instance of a steamship full of returning coolies from Singapore
to some port in northern China occurred to my recollection. Years
before I had heard it being talked about in the East as a recent
occurrence. It was for us merely one subject of conversation amongst
many others of the kind. Men earning their bread in any very specialized
occupation will talk shop, not only because it is the most vital
interest of their lives but also because they have not much knowledge
of other subjects. They have never had the time to get acquainted
with them. Life, for most of us, is not so much a hard as an exacting
taskmaster.</p>

<p>I never met anybody personally concerned in this affair, the
interest of which for us was, of course, not the bad weather but
the extraordinary complication brought into the ship's life at
a moment of exceptional stress by the human element below her
deck. Neither was the story itself ever enlarged upon in my hearing.
In that company each of us could imagine easily what the whole
thing was like. The financial difficulty of it, presenting also
a human problem, was solved by a mind much too simple to be perplexed
by anything in the world except men's idle talk for which it was
not adapted.</p>

<p>From the first the mere anecdote, the mere statement I might
say, that such a thing had happened on the high seas, appeared
to me a sufficient subject for meditation. Yet it was but a bit
of a sea yarn after all. I felt that to bring out its deeper significance
which was quite apparent to me, something other, something more
was required; a leading motive that would harmonize all these
violent noises, and a point of view that would put all that elemental
fury into its proper place.</p>

<p>What was needed of course was Captain MacWhirr. Directly I perceived
him I could see that he was the man for the situation. I don't
mean to say that I ever saw Captain MacWhirr in the flesh, or
had ever come in contact with his literal mind and his dauntless
temperament. MacWhirr is not an acquaintance of a few hours, or
a few weeks, or a few months. He is the product of twenty years
of life. My own life. Conscious invention had little to do with
him. If it is true that Captain MacWhirr never walked and breathed
on this earth (which I find for my part extremely difficult to
believe) I can also assure my readers that he is perfectly authentic.
I may venture to assert the same of every aspect of the story,
while I confess that the particular typhoon of the tale was not
a typhoon of my actual experience.</p>

<p>At its first appearance "Typhoon," the story, was classed by
some critics as a deliberately intended storm-piece. Others picked
out MacWhirr, in whom they perceived a definite symbolic intention.
Neither was exclusively my intention. Both the typhoon and Captain
MacWhirr presented themselves to me as the necessities of the
deep conviction with which I approached the subject of the story.
It was their opportunity. It was also my opportunity; and it would
be vain to discourse about what I made of it in a handful of pages,
since the pages themselves are here, between the covers of this
volume, to speak for themselves.</p>

<p>This is a belated reflection. If it had occurred to me before
it would have perhaps done away with the existence of this Author's
Note; for, indeed, the same remark applies to every story in this
volume. None of them are stories of experience in the absolute
sense of the word. Experience in them is but the canvas of the
attempted picture. Each of them has its more than one intention.
With each the question is what the writer has done with his opportunity;
and each answers the question for itself in words which, if I
may say so without undue solemnity, were written with a conscientious
regard for the truth of my own sensations. And each of those stories,
to mean something, must justify itself in its own way to the conscience
of each successive reader.</p>

<p>"Falk"&mdash;the second story in the volume&mdash;offended the delicacy
of one critic at least by certain peculiarities of its subject.
But what is the subject of "Falk"? I personally do not feel so
very certain about it. He who reads must find out for himself.
My intention in writing "Falk"  was not to shock anybody. As in
most of my writings I insist not on the events but on their effect
upon the persons in the tale. But in everything I have written
there is always one invariable intention, and that is to capture
the reader's attention, by securing his interest and enlisting
his sympathies for the matter in hand, whatever it may be, within
the limits of the visible world and within the boundaries of human
emotions.</p>

<p>I may safely say that Falk is absolutely true to my experience
of certain straightforward characters combining a perfectly natural
ruthlessness with a certain amount of moral delicacy. Falk obeys
the law of self-preservation without the slightest misgivings
as to his right, but at a crucial turn of that ruthlessly preserved
life he will not condescend to dodge the truth. As he is presented
as sensitive enough to be affected permanently by a certain unusual
experience, that experience had to be set by me before the reader
vividly; but it is not the subject of the tale. If we go by mere
facts then the subject is Falk's attempt to get married; in which
the narrator of the tale finds himself unexpectedly involved both
on its ruthless and its delicate side.</p>

<p>"Falk" shares with one other of my stories ("The Return" in the
"Tales of Unrest" volume) the distinction of never having been
serialized. I think the copy was shown to the editor of some magazine
who rejected it indignantly on the sole ground that "the girl
never says anything." This is perfectly true. From first to last
Hermann's niece utters no word in the tale&mdash;and it is not because
she is dumb, but for the simple reason that whenever she happens
to come under the observation of the narrator she has either no
occasion or is too profoundly moved to speak. The editor, who
obviously had read the story, might have perceived that for himself.
Apparently he did not, and I refrained from pointing out the impossibility
to him because, since he did not venture to say that "the girl"
did not live, I felt no concern at his indignation.</p>

<p>All the other stories were serialized. The "Typhoon" appeared
in the early numbers of the Pall Mall Magazine, then under the
direction of the late Mr. Halkett. It was on that occasion, too,
that I saw for the first time my conceptions rendered by an artist
in another medium. Mr. Maurice Grieffenhagen knew how to combine
in his illustrations the effect of his own most distinguished
personal vision with an absolute fidelity to the inspiration of
the writer. "Amy Foster" was published in The Illustrated London
News with a fine drawing of Amy on her day out giving tea to the
children at her home, in a hat with a big feather. "To-morrow"
appeared first in the Pall Mall Magazine. Of that story I will
only say that it struck many people by its adaptability to the
stage and that I was induced to dramatize it under the title of
"One Day More"; up to the present my only effort in that direction.
I may also add that each of the four stories on their appearance
in book form was picked out on various grounds as the "best of
the lot" by different critics, who reviewed the volume with a
warmth of appreciation and understanding, a sympathetic insight
and a friendliness of expression for which I cannot be sufficiently
grateful.</p>
