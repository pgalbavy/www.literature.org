<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Down the sloping hillside browned with the summer sun strolled
Peace one afternoon late in August, gathering the purple foxgloves
which waved invitingly in the breeze. It was one of those rare
days of waning summer, clear, beautiful and cool, with just a
hint of autumn haze in the air; and it cast its magic spell over
the bare-headed, flower-laden maid, wandering dreamily through
the crisp, crackling grass, with no particular destination in
view, no particular thought in mind. She had set out an hour before
with Cherry and Allee as her companions, but had wandered away
from them without being aware of it, and was now some distance
from home, still busy pulling the gorgeous stems of bloom, still
unconscious of her loneness, still lost in her own realms of fancy.</p>

<p>This Peace was one few people knew. Allee was most familiar with
the brown-eyed dream-child, the little family at the parsonage
were quite well acquainted with her, and occasionally Gail caught
a fleeting glimpse of that hidden spirit, but to the rest of the
little world in which she lived she was a bright-eyed, gay-hearted
little romp, whose efforts to lend assistance to others were always
leading her into mischief, oftentimes with unhappy results.</p>

<p>So it is no wonder that busy Dr. Bainbridge was surprised when
he discovered her in this strange mood as he came puffing and
panting up the hill toward town, for she was so completely lost
amid her dreams that she did not see him nor hear his brusque
greeting until he stepped directly in her path and clutched her
arm. Then she started as if suddenly awakened from a sleep, and
exclaimed, "Why, Dr. Bainbridge, what do you mean by making me
jump so? I nearly lost my skin! I never saw you at all. Where
did you come from&mdash;the clouds?"</p>

<p>"No, miss. If I had been there you would have seen me before
this, for if ever anyone was walking in the clouds, it was you
just this minute. Come along, I want you, dreamer. Can you do
me a favor, a big one?"</p>

<p>"'Pends upon what it is," answered Peace, thoroughly awake now.</p>

<p>He laughed at the judicious tone of voice and the familiar cant
of the curly brown head, and answered promptly, "I want you to
play Good Samaritan for a little while, be nurse for one of my
patients&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nurse?" She looked at him with wide-open eyes, secretly wondering
whether he knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, nurse!" he thundered. "Annette Fisher is sick, very
sick, and I have told her mother time after time that she must
not be left alone, yet in spite of all my cautions, that red-headed
ignoramus has taken the rest of the caboodle and gone off to town,
leaving Annette all alone in the house until the father gets home
tonight. The child's fever has been soaring sky-high for days,
and I was just beginning to think I had it in control and could
pull her through when that old termagant-gossip of a mother, who
doesn't deserve to have chick or child, hikes off to spend the
afternoon with relatives in the city for a chance to look up bargains
at The Martindale. What are embroideries and dress goods compared
with the life of a child? Won't she get a piece of my mind the
next time I lay eyes on her?" So angry and indignant was the old
doctor that he had wholly forgotten himself, and spoke as he would
never have thought of doing under different circumstances.</p>

<p>Peace brought him to the earth by agreeing heartily, "Well, I
would 'f I was you, and I'd give her a good big piece, too. I'll
nurse Annette if you want me to. Shall I give her a bath and dose
her with medicine every few minutes, like we did mother? Does
she need to be wrapped up in wet rags or painted with <em>irondye</em>?
Or do you want me to feed her <em>grool</em> and broth?"</p>

<p>"You don't have to do a single thing but stay with her and keep
her from fretting until I can get someone from the village to
go down there. I gave her a bath just now myself, and she has
taken her medicine&mdash;all I want her to have for the present. She
isn't to eat a thing, but she can drink all the milk she wants,
and occasionally have a little water if she asks for it. Now remember,
Peace. She is too sick to pay attention to much of anything, but
sometimes she is fretful and talks a good deal. Try to be as quiet
as possible yourself,&mdash;don't say things to excite her&mdash;don't speak
at all unless she wants you to. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I'll send someone down to relieve you the minute I can get anyone.
Hurry along now, and don't forget what I have said."</p>

<p>"All right," was the cheery response; and Peace, with a curious
thrill of awe in her heart, sped down the hill as fast as her
nimble feet could carry her.</p>

<p>The door of the Fisher house stood open, so, without knocking
to make her presence known, she stepped softly inside the hall,
and crept up the stairs to the little, hot chamber, where thin-faced
Annette lay burning with fever. The invalid was awake, tossing
fretfully among her pillows, but the instant she saw Peace in
the doorway her eyes brightened, and she called in a shrill, weak
voice, "Is it really you, Peace, or has my head turned 'round
again?"</p>

<p>"It's really me. Dr. Bainbridge sent me up."</p>

<p>"That's funny. He wouldn't let you or any of the other girls
come when I asked for you before. Did you bring all those flowers
for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Peace answered readily, glancing down at the huge bouquet
in her arms, which she had entirely forgotten. "Where shall I
put them? No, don't try to tell me; I'll find a dish myself."</p>

<p>"Would you please bring me a drink, too?" Annette asked hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Sure!"</p>

<p>"Fresh from the well?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Peace disappeared down the creaking stairs again, returning quickly
with a dripping dipper full of sparkling, ice-cold water from
the well, and the sick child drank feverishly, sighing as she
relinquished the cup, "That's awful good. If only it would stay
cold all the time! But the next time I want a drink it is warm
and horrid, and ma says she can't be always chasing to the well
just to get me some water. Harry won't, either. Pa ain't here
but a little while night and morning, and Isabel is too little
to fetch it. Set the flowers here on the chair where I can see
them good. When ma comes home she'll likely throw them out. She
says she can't see the good of cluttering up the house with dishes
of weeds like that."</p>

<p>"Your mother is an old <em>turnacrank</em>, &mdash;Doctor says
so," muttered Peace indignantly, as she tugged at the heavy jar
of foxgloves she had arranged with artistic care.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" asked Annette, querulously.</p>

<p>Peace suddenly remembered the doctor's instructions. "I say I
know how to keep water cold. Gail used to do it for mother on
hot days. I'll wet a rag and wrap the dipper in that and set it
in the window where the wind will blow on it."</p>

<p>"Will that make it keep cool?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as long as the rag is wet. There is quite a little wind
today, too, and that helps."</p>

<p>"Is it cool out-doors?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I wish I could go out under the trees. It is so hot
in here cooped up like I am."</p>

<p>Peace bit her tongue. How easy it was to forget the doctor's
directions! Twice already she had said things which excited the
poor, sick prisoner, whom she had been told to keep quiet. A happy
inspiration leaped into her thought, and moving the jar of delicate
blossoms closer to the bed, she slipped a spray into Annette's
hand, saying, "S'pose we <em>minagine</em> these flowers are trees.
They would make a lovely forest, wouldn't they? I often wish the
trees had pretty flowers."</p>

<p>"Apple trees have," said Annette thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"That's so!" was the surprised ejaculation. "I forgot all about
the fruit trees. All of them have flowers, but I like the apple-blossoms
best, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are so cool looking and so sweet and smelly."</p>

<p>"That's what I like about them most. When I go to the moon I
wear a dress made of apple-blossoms and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When you go to the moon?" repeated Annette, looking bewildered
and wondering if the queer thoughts which the doctor called delirium
were coming back to haunt her again.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I really don't go, but I like to s'pose what
it would be like if I could go there. After Allee and me go to
bed at night, sometimes the moon comes and shines in at our window
and we talk to it. I don't care about the man-in-the-moon very
much, though Allee likes him. She says he must be so lonely up
there by himself all the time that she doesn't see how he can
keep on smiling so. But I love the lady in the moon."</p>

<p>"The lady in the moon?"</p>

<p>"Well, we call her the moon lady. We like to think she is a beautiful,
beau-ti-ful lady, with long, pale yellow hair that pretty nearly
drags when she walks. It would drag if she didn't wear such big
tails on her skirts. That's the kind of hair I wish I had instead
of kinky, woolly curls. Hers isn't a bit curly, but just falls
back from her face like Jennie Munn's after she has had it braided
for a long time. And it trails out behind her like a&mdash;a cloud.
Her dress is white stuff, and she never has it starched; it's
just soft and shiny and swishy, and seems to b'long just to her.
Oh, she is the prettiest lady, Annette!"</p>

<p>"What color are her eyes?" asked the invalid, much interested
in the picture Peace was drawing.</p>

<p>"Blue, just like Hope's, only you don't think of them being blue
when you look at the moon lady&mdash;they 'mind you of stars. I think
they are stars, and she wears a star in her hair."</p>

<p>"Does she have a house to live in?"</p>

<p>"Not a house, but a palace, made of soft-looking, sparkly stones
that flash like diamond dust, and inside it is white and still,&mdash;the
kind of a still that makes you feel dreamy and nice. And there
are fountains everywhere, with cool water splashing out of the
top of them. They are made of white marble&mdash;the fountains are,
I mean&mdash;and so are the <em>pillows</em> of the palace on the outside,
where the moon lady walks in her garden."</p>

<p>"Is there a garden in the moon?"</p>

<p>"In my moon there is, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ma says the moon is made of green cheese, and is full of maggots."</p>

<p>"I heard that story, too, and I look for them first thing every
time I go there, but I haven't found any yet. Big, white Easter
lilies grow along the paths, and lilies-of-the-valley blossom
the whole year round, and water lilies make the lake almost white
sometimes."</p>

<p>"Oh, a lake, too! How nice!"</p>

<p>"The moon lady's lake is the prettiest I ever saw. The water
is always silv'ry, just like our lakes look when the moon shines
down on them. You know, Annette, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the moon was shining one time when I went to Lake Marion
with pa to hear the band, and we rowed around in a little boat
and listened to the music."</p>

<p>"That's just what the moon lady does when we go to see her, only
her boats are green-pea pods, and the sails are apple-blossom
petals. We don't have to row; the boats just float of themselves,
and we pick water lilies or listen to the music&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What kind of music?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sometimes the moon lady sings by-low songs, and sometimes
it's just the frogs singing in the bottom of the lake."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you like frogs' croaking?"</p>

<p>"If I have been good I like it awfully well, but if I've made
Gail or anyone sorry, I don't want to listen to the frogs, for
they keep saying, 'Don't do it again, don't do it again,' till
it makes me mis'rable. The frogs in the moon never say such things,
though, and I like to listen to them. Sometimes we call across
the water to hear the echoes answer; and sometimes we let the
moonbeams light on our hands and hair and dresses, and talk to
them."</p>

<p>"Talk to the moonbeams? How funny!"</p>

<p>"Why, our moonbeams are lovely little fairies, with wings like
dragon-flies, and shiny, silv'ry gowns; and whenever they get
tired of flying about they settle down and glow like fireflies.
They b'long to the moon lady and are nice fairies. They make sugar
stars and moon-ice for us to eat."</p>

<p>Peace clapped her hand abruptly over her mouth. Suppose Annette
should ask for something to eat! But the sick child merely held
the spray of foxgloves nearer her face and inquired, "What is
that? Ice-cream?"</p>

<p>"No; it's shaped like icicles and has kind of a sourish taste,
either lemon or strawberry, and it doesn't melt until you get
tired of it. Then it's all gone. And it's the same way with moonbeamade.
Allee made up that name from lemonade. It is just a heap of foam
that tastes like the north-west wind and is cool and nice."</p>

<p>"S'posing things is a queer game, ain't it?" murmured Annette,
drowsily.</p>

<p>"It's lots of fun, and sometimes when we go to sleep we dream
about them,&mdash;the places we visit in the moon and the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The water and lilies and fountains and cool things?"</p>

<p>"Yes, or the mountains, where the fairies and goblins live, or
the forests, which belong to the brownies and elves, or the valleys,
where the sunbeams play, or the caves, where the wind-voices hide,
or &mdash;I do b'lieve she's asleep. Yes, sir! Both eyes are tight
shut, and she has dropped the foxglove she was holding so hard."</p>

<p>Softly Peace dropped back into her former position upon the floor,
hardly daring to breathe for fear of waking the little slumberer,
for had not the doctor said she was a very sick child, and that
she must be kept as quiet as possible?</p>

<p>At thought of the doctor she began to wonder why he had not sent
the woman from the village as he had promised to do. Already the
sun was sinking low in the west, and no one had come to watch
over the invalid. Perhaps he had forgotten, perhaps someone was
dreadfully sick and he had been called away before he could find
a nurse for Annette. Perhaps&mdash;the brown head nodded gently, the
long, dark lashes fluttered slowly over the somber brown eyes,
and Peace, too, was fast asleep, curled up against the narrow
bed, where the sick child lay in a dreamless, refreshing slumber.
The sunset faded from the sky, twilight deepened into dusk, and
the stars came out in their pale glory, but both the Good Samaritan
and her patient were unconscious of it all.</p>

<p>In the little brown house among the maple trees great anxiety
brooded. Peace had not come home with her sisters from their flower-gathering
expedition, and no one in town had seen her. The whole neighborhood
was aroused, and a search party was just being organized when
the doctor's carriage drove up to the gate, and the physician,
angry, dismayed and alarmed, hurried up the path as fast as his
avoirdupois would permit, flung open the screen and called imperiously,
"Miss Gail, girls, any of you! It's all my fault! Peace is down
at the Fisher house watching over Annette. I sent her there this
afternoon while I went after a woman to stay with the child, and
have just this minute heard that Grandma Cole sprained her ankle
on the way there and had to crawl back home again. Mrs. Fisher,
the big idiot, is moseying up the road now, well satisfied with
her bargains. I passed her and her tribe a piece back and stopped
long enough to tell her what I thought of her. Now pile in and
I'll take you back with me for that little sister of yours."</p>

<p>He had caught up a little shawl from the hat-rack as he talked,
and throwing this over Gail's shoulders, he bundled her out of
the house and into his buggy before she had recovered from her
astonishment at his outburst; and after a moment of furious riding
behind the lively bay horse, she found herself stumbling up the
dark stairs in the unlighted Fisher house, at the heels of the
panting, puffing, wrathy doctor. From somewhere he produced a
lamp, and soon the dim rays of light dispelled the gloom of the
place, and she stood beside him, looking down into the pale face
of Annette asleep among her pillows, and the rosy one of smiling
Peace, huddled in an uncomfortable bunch on the floor.</p>

<p>"What a picture!" murmured the doctor huskily, leaning over to
touch the damp forehead and feel the pulse of his little patient.
"This is the first natural sleep she has had for days. Bully for
Peace! I confess I was worried about leaving her here in the first
place. I was afraid she would fret Annette into a worse fever
than she already had. I'd have gone crazy if I'd had any notion
that the child must stay here all the afternoon, with only Peace
to look after her. Excuse me if I seem more concerned about Annette's
welfare than over Peace's long absence and your fright, Gail.
I've had a big battle to pull her through, and I was wild when
I found that fool mother had gone off and left her alone. Didn't
expect to be gone long, and here it is <em>hours</em>! There,
I won't storm any more, but we'll wake Peace up and take her home."</p>

<p>He shook the child gently by the shoulder, and as the sleepy
eyes fluttered open they saw only Gail bending over her. "It's
all right, Gail," the child said softly, still remembering her
charge. "Dr. Bainbridge asked me to be a good <em>sanatarium</em>
over Annette while that <em>negrogrampus</em> of a mother was
hunting bargains of embroid'ries and he was hunting a sure-enough
nurse. Oh, there is the doctor himself! Is Annette all right?
She talked a lot at first, but I told her about my moon lady,
and pretty soon she went fast asleep."</p>

<p>"Annette is doing splendidly, Dr. Peace, and I am tickled to
death at the good work you've done. Run along with Gail now. I'll
be down in a minute to drive you home."</p>
