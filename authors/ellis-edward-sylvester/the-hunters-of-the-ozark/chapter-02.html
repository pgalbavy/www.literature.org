<p>The examination of the shore of the creek had lasted but a few
minutes, when Terry Clark, pointing to the moist earth at their
feet, called out in some excitement:</p>

<p>"Do ye mind that now?"</p>

<p>There, sure enough, were the footprints of a cow that had entered
the stream from the same side on which the boys stood. The impressions
could be seen for some distance in the clear water, which in the
middle of the stream was no more than a yard deep, and they were
plainly observed where the animal had emerged on the other side.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose there is any difference in the tracks of cows,
but I guess, Terry, that we are safe in making up our minds we
are on the trail of Brindle."</p>

<p>"I'm thinking the same," replied the other, who was not only
looking across the creek, but into the woods beyond, as though
he expected to catch sight of the cow herself; "though it may
be the one that crossed there isn't the one that we're after."</p>

<p>Fred Linden was asking himself whether there was not some way
in which they could reach the other side without going to the
trouble of removing their shoes and leggins, and hunting a shallow
portion, or allowing their garments to become saturated. He exclaimed:
"Why didn't I think of it? There's our canoe!"</p>

<p>A number of these frail craft were owned in Greville, and Fred
had a fine one himself, which was only a short distance off. Three
minutes later the two reached it.</p>

<p>The barken structure was moored by means of a long rope to a
tree a considerable distance from the water, so that in case of
one of those sudden rises that sometimes took place, it would
not be carried away by the freshet. The boat was quickly launched,
and a few strokes of the paddle carried the two to the opposite
bank of the stream.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether there is any danger of a rise," remarked Fred,
as he carried the rope to a tree twenty feet distant and made
it fast to a limb; "there was a good deal of thunder and lightning
last night off to the east."</p>

<p>"But the creek doesn't come from that way," said the surprised
Terry; "so what is the odds, as me father said he used to ask
when the Injins was on all sides of him, and a panther in the
tree he wanted to climb, and he found himself standing on the
head of a rattlesnake."</p>

<p>"The creek winds through every point of the compass, so it doesn't
make much difference, as you say, where it rains, since it is
sure to make a rise; the only question is whether the rain was
enough to affect the creek so that it will trouble us."</p>

<p>"If it was goin' to do that, wouldn't it have done so before
this?" was the natural question of his companion.</p>

<p>"That depends on how far away the rain was."</p>

<p>The boys were not idle while talking. The canoe was soon made
fast, and then they resumed their hunt for the estray. They were
not skillful enough in woodcraft to trace the animal through the
forest by the means that an Indian would have used, but they were
hopeful that by taking a general direction they would soon find
her. If she still had the bell tied around her neck, there was
no reason why they should not be successful.</p>

<p>But while walking forward, Fred Linden asked a question of himself
that he did not repeat aloud.</p>

<p>"Has she been stolen?"</p>

<p>This query was naturally followed by others. It certainly was
unreasonable to think that a cow would leave her companions and
deliberately wander off, at the time she was milked twice daily.
She would speedily suffer such distress that she would come bellowing
homeward for relief. If she really was an estray, she had missed
two milkings&mdash;that of the previous night and the morning that
succeeded.</p>

<p>It was certain, therefore, that if she was stolen, the thief
had attended to her milking. But who could the thief be? That
was the important question that Fred confessed himself unable
to answer.</p>

<p>There had been occasional instances of white men who had stolen
horses from the frontier settlements, but the lad could recall
nothing of the kind that had taken place in that neighborhood;
all of which might be the case without affecting the present loss,
since it was evident that there must be a first theft of that
nature.</p>

<p>But, somehow or other, Fred could not help suspecting that the
red men had to do with the disappearance of the animal. I have
intimated in another place that Greville had never been harmed
by the Indians, who were scattered here and there through the
country, for there was no comparison between them and the fierce
Shawanoes, Wyandottes, Pottawatomies and other tribes, whose deeds
gave to Kentucky its impressive title of the Dark and Bloody Ground;
but among the different bands of red men who roamed through the
great wilderness west of the Mississippi, were those who were
capable of as atrocious cruelties as were ever committed by the
fierce warriors further east.</p>

<p>What more likely, therefore, than that a party of these had stolen
the cow and driven her away?</p>

<p>There were many facts that were in favor of and against the theory;
the chief one against it was that if a party of Indians had driven
off one cow, they would have taken more. Then, too, the soft earth
that had revealed the hoof tracks ought to have shown the imprint
of moccasins.</p>

<p>You will see, therefore, that Fred could speculate for hours
on the question without satisfying himself. He was sorry that
he and Terry had not brought their guns with them, and was half
inclined to go back. It was not yet noon, and they had plenty
of time in which to do so.</p>

<p>"Terry," said Fred, turning suddenly about and addressing his
friend, who was walking behind him, "we made a mistake in not
bringing our guns."</p>

<p>The Irish lad was about to answer when he raised his hand in
a warning way and said:</p>

<p>"Hist!"</p>

<p>Both stood as motionless as the tree trunks about them, all their
faculties centered in the one of hearing.</p>

<p>There was the low, deep roar which is always heard in a vast
wood, made by the soft wind stealing among the multitudinous branches,
and which is like the voice of silence itself. They were so far
from the creek that its soft ripple failed to reach them.</p>

<p>"I don't hear any thing," said Fred at the end of a full minute.</p>

<p>"Nor do I," said Terry.</p>

<p>"Why then did you ask me to listen?"</p>

<p>"I was thinkin' be that token that we might hear something."</p>

<p>"What made you think so?"</p>

<p>"The tinkle of a bell."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed the amazed Fred, "are you sure?"</p>

<p>"That I am; just as I was about to speak, I caught the faint
sound&mdash;just as we've both heard hundreds of times."</p>

<p>"From what point did it seem to come?"</p>

<p>His friend pointed due south.</p>

<p>"Strange it is that ye didn't catch the same."</p>

<p>"So I think; it may be, Terry, that you are mistaken, and you
wanted to hear the bell so much that the sound was in your fancy."</p>

<p>The lad, however, would not admit this. He was sure there had
been no mistake. Fred was about to argue further when all doubt
was set at rest by the sound of a cow-bell that came faintly but
clearly through the forest.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Fred, his face brightening up; "we are
on the track of old Brindle sure enough. It's mighty strange though
how she came to wander so far from home."</p>

<p>"She got lost I s'pose," replied Terry, repeating the theory
that had been hit upon some time before.</p>

<p>"It may be, but it is the first instance I ever heard of, where
an animal lost its way so easily."</p>

<p>The boys were in too high spirits, however, to try to explain
that which puzzled them. The cow was a valuable creature, being
the only one that belonged to the family with whom Terence lived,
and who therefore could ill afford her loss.</p>

<p>The friends had pushed perhaps a couple hundred yards further
when Terry called to Fred that he was not following the right
course.</p>

<p>"Ye're bearing too much to the lift; so much so indaad that if
ye kaap on ye'll find yersilf lift."</p>

<p>"Why, I was about to turn a little more in that direction," replied
the astonished Fred; "you are altogether wrong."</p>

<p>But the other sturdily insisted that he was right, and he was
so positive that he stopped short, and refused to go another step
in the direction that his friend was following. The latter was
just as certain that Terry was amiss, and it looked as if they
had come to a deadlock.</p>

<p>"There's only one way to settle it," said Fred, "and that is
for each of us to follow the route he thinks right. The cow can't
be far off and we shall soon find out who is wrong. The first
one that finds Brindle shall call to the other, and he'll own
up what a stupid blunder he has made."</p>

<p>"Ye are speakin' me own sentiments," replied Terry, who kept
looking about him and listening as if he expected every moment
that the cow herself would solve the question. Fred Linden read
the meaning of his action, and he, too, wondered why it was that
when both had plainly caught the tinkle of the telltale bell,
they should hear it no more. Strange that when it had spoken so
clearly it should become silent, but such was the fact.</p>

<p>Little did either suspect the cause.</p>
