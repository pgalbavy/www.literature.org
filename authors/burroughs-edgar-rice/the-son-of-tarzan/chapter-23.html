Meriem had traversed half the length of the village street
when a score of white-robed Negroes and half-castes leaped
out upon her from the dark interiors of surrounding huts.
She turned to flee, but heavy hands seized her, and when she
turned at last to plead with them her eyes fell upon the face
of a tall, grim, old man glaring down upon her from beneath
the folds of his burnous.
<P>
At sight of him she staggered back in shocked and terrified surprise. 
It was The Sheik!
<P>
Instantly all the old fears and terrors of her childhood returned
upon her.  She stood trembling before this horrible old man,
as a murderer before the judge about to pass sentence of death
upon him.  She knew that The Sheik recognized her.  The years
and the changed raiment had not altered her so much but what one
who had known her features so well in childhood would know her now.
<P>
"So you have come back to your people, eh?" snarled The Sheik. 
"Come back begging for food and protection, eh?"
<P>
"Let me go," cried the girl.  "I ask nothing of you, but that
you let me go back to the Big Bwana."
<P>
"The Big Bwana?" almost screamed The Sheik, and then followed
a stream of profane, Arabic invective against the white man
whom all the transgressors of the jungle feared and hated.
"You would go back to the Big Bwana, would you?  So that is
where you have been since you ran away from me, is it?  And who
comes now across the river after you--the Big Bwana?"
<P>
"The Swede whom you once chased away from your country
when he and his companion conspired with Nbeeda to steal me
from you," replied Meriem.
<P>
The Sheik's eyes blazed, and he called his men to approach
the shore and hide among the bushes that they might ambush
and annihilate Malbihn and his party; but Malbihn already had
landed and crawling through the fringe of jungle was at that very
moment looking with wide and incredulous eyes upon the scene
being enacted in the street of the deserted village.  He recognized
The Sheik the moment his eyes fell upon him.  There were two
men in the world that Malbihn feared as he feared the devil.
One was the Big Bwana and the other The Sheik.  A single glance
he took at that gaunt, familiar figure and then he turned tail
and scurried back to his canoe calling his followers after him. 
And so it happened that the party was well out in the stream before
The Sheik reached the shore, and after a volley and a few parting
shots that were returned from the canoes the Arab called his
men off and securing his prisoner set off toward the South.
<P>
One of the bullets from Malbihn's force had struck a black
standing in the village street where he had been left with
another to guard Meriem, and his companions had left him where
he had fallen, after appropriating his apparel and belongings. 
His was the body that Baynes had discovered when he had entered
the village.
<P>
The Sheik and his party had been marching southward along
the river when one of them, dropping out of line to fetch water,
had seen Meriem paddling desperately from the opposite shore.
The fellow had called The Sheik's attention to the strange sight--
a white woman alone in Central Africa and the old Arab had hidden
his men in the deserted village to capture her when she landed,
for thoughts of ransom were always in the mind of The Sheik. 
More than once before had glittering gold filtered through
his fingers from a similar source.  It was easy money and The
Sheik had none too much easy money since the Big Bwana had
so circumscribed the limits of his ancient domain that he dared
not even steal ivory from natives within two hundred miles of
the Big Bwana's douar.  And when at last the woman had walked
into the trap he had set for her and he had recognized her as the
same little girl he had brutalized and mal-treated years before
his gratification had been huge.  Now he lost no time in
establishing the old relations of father and daughter that had
existed between them in the past.  At the first opportunity he
struck her a heavy blow across the face.  He forced her to walk
when he might have dismounted one of his men instead, or had her
carried on a horse's rump.  He seemed to revel in the discovery of
new methods for torturing or humiliating her, and among all his
followers she found no single one to offer her sympathy, or who
dared defend her, even had they had the desire to do so.
<P>
A two days' march brought them at last to the familiar scenes
of her childhood, and the first face upon which she set her eyes
as she was driven through the gates into the strong stockade was
that of the toothless, hideous Mabunu, her one time nurse.  It was
as though all the years that had intervened were but a dream.
Had it not been for her clothing and the fact that she had grown in
stature she might well have believed it so.  All was there as she
had left it--the new faces which supplanted some of the old were
of the same bestial, degraded type.  There were a few young Arabs
who had joined The Sheik since she had been away.  Otherwise all
was the same--all but one.  Geeka was not there, and she found
herself missing Geeka as though the ivory-headed one had been a
flesh and blood intimate and friend.  She missed her ragged little
confidante, into whose deaf ears she had been wont to pour her
many miseries and her occasional joys--Geeka, of the splinter limbs
and the ratskin torso--Geeka the disreputable--Geeka the beloved.
<P>
For a time the inhabitants of The Sheik's village who had not
been upon the march with him amused themselves by inspecting
the strangely clad white girl, whom some of them had known as a
little child.  Mabunu pretended great joy at her return, baring
her toothless gums in a hideous grimace that was intended to be
indicative of rejoicing.  But Meriem could but shudder as she
recalled the cruelties of this terrible old hag in the years gone by.
<P>
Among the Arabs who had come in her absence was a tall young
fellow of twenty--a handsome, sinister looking youth--who
stared at her in open admiration until The Sheik came and
ordered him away, and Abdul Kamak went, scowling.
<P>
At last, their curiosity satisfied, Meriem was alone.  As of old,
she was permitted the freedom of the village, for the stockade
was high and strong and the only gates were well-guarded by day
and by night; but as of old she cared not for the companionship
of the cruel Arabs and the degraded blacks who formed the
following of The Sheik, and so, as had been her wont in the
sad days of her childhood, she slunk down to an unfrequented
corner of the enclosure where she had often played at house-
keeping with her beloved Geeka beneath the spreading branches
of the great tree that had overhung the palisade; but now the tree
was gone, and Meriem guessed the reason.  It was from this tree
that Korak had descended and struck down The Sheik the day
that he had rescued her from the life of misery and torture that
had been her lot for so long that she could remember no other.
<P>
There were low bushes growing within the stockade, however,
and in the shade of these Meriem sat down to think.  A little
glow of happiness warmed her heart as she recalled her first
meeting with Korak and then the long years that he had cared
for and protected her with the solicitude and purity of an
elder brother.  For months Korak had not so occupied her
thoughts as he did today.  He seemed closer and dearer now
than ever he had before, and she wondered that her heart had
drifted so far from loyalty to his memory.  And then came the
image of the Hon. Morison, the exquisite, and Meriem was troubled. 
Did she really love the flawless young Englishman?  She thought
of the glories of London, of which he had told her in such
glowing language.  She tried to picture herself admired and
honored in the midst of the gayest society of the great capital. 
The pictures she drew were the pictures that the Hon. Morison
had drawn for her.  They were alluring pictures, but through them
all the brawny, half-naked figure of the giant Adonis of the jungle
persisted in obtruding itself.
<P>
Meriem pressed her hand above her heart as she stifled a sigh,
and as she did so she felt the hard outlines of the photograph
she had hidden there as she slunk from Malbihn's tent.  Now she
drew it forth and commenced to re-examine it more carefully than
she had had time to do before.  She was sure that the baby face
was hers.  She studied every detail of the picture.  Half hidden
in the lace of the dainty dress rested a chain and locket.
Meriem puckered her brows.  What tantalizing half-memories
it awakened!  Could this flower of evident civilization be the
little Arab Meriem, daughter of The Sheik?  It was impossible,
and yet that locket?  Meriem knew it.  She could not refute the
conviction of her memory.  She had seen that locket before and it
had been hers.  What strange mystery lay buried in her past?
<P>
As she sat gazing at the picture she suddenly became aware that
she was not alone--that someone was standing close behind her--
some one who had approached her noiselessly.  Guiltily she thrust
the picture back into her waist.  A hand fell upon her shoulder. 
She was sure that it was The Sheik and she awaited in dumb terror
the blow that she knew would follow.
<P>
No blow came and she looked upward over her shoulder--into the
eyes of Abdul Kamak, the young Arab.
<P>
"I saw," he said, "the picture that you have just hidden.  It is
you when you were a child--a very young child.  May I see it again?"
<P>
Meriem drew away from him.
<P>
"I will give it back," he said.  "I have heard of you and
I know that you have no love for The Sheik, your father. 
Neither have I.  I will not betray you.  Let me see the picture."
<P>
Friendless among cruel enemies, Meriem clutched at the straw
that Abdul Kamak held out to her.  Perhaps in him she might
find the friend she needed.  Anyway he had seen the picture and
if he was not a friend he could tell The Sheik about it and it
would be taken away from her.  So she might as well grant his
request and hope that he had spoken fairly, and would deal fairly.
She drew the photograph from its hiding place and handed it to him.
<P>
Abdul Kamak examined it carefully, comparing it, feature by feature
with the girl sitting on the ground looking up into his face. 
Slowly he nodded his head.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "it is you, but where was it taken?  How does
it happen that The Sheik's daughter is clothed in the garments
of the unbeliever?"
<P>
"I do not know," replied Meriem.  "I never saw the picture
until a couple of days ago, when I found it in the tent of the
Swede, Malbihn."
<P>
Abdul Kamak raised his eyebrows.  He turned the picture over and
as his eyes fell upon the old newspaper cutting they went wide. 
He could read French, with difficulty, it is true; but he could
read it.  He had been to Paris.  He had spent six months there
with a troupe of his desert fellows, upon exhibition, and he had
improved his time, learning many of the customs, some of the
language, and most of the vices of his conquerors.  Now he
put his learning to use.  Slowly, laboriously he read the
yellowed cutting.  His eyes were no longer wide.  Instead they
narrowed to two slits of cunning.  When he had done he looked at
the girl.
<P>
"You have read this?" he asked.
<P>
"It is French," she replied, "and I do not read French."
<P>
Abdul Kamak stood long in silence looking at the girl.  She was
very beautiful.  He desired her, as had many other men who had
seen her.  At last he dropped to one knee beside her.
<P>
A wonderful idea had sprung to Abdul Kamak's mind.  It was an
idea that might be furthered if the girl were kept in ignorance
of the contents of that newspaper cutting.  It would certainly be
doomed should she learn its contents.
<P>
"Meriem," he whispered, "never until today have my eyes
beheld you, yet at once they told my heart that it must ever be
your servant.  You do not know me, but I ask that you trust me.
I can help you.  You hate The Sheik--so do I.  Let me take you
away from him.  Come with me, and we will go back to the
great desert where my father is a sheik mightier than is yours.
Will you come?"
<P>
Meriem sat in silence.  She hated to wound the only one who
had offered her protection and friendship; but she did not want
Abdul Kamak's love.  Deceived by her silence the man seized
her and strained her to him; but Meriem struggled to free herself.
<P>
"I do not love you," she cried.  "Oh, please do not make me
hate you.  You are the only one who has shown kindness toward
me, and I want to like you, but I cannot love you."
<P>
Abdul Kamak drew himself to his full height.
<P>
"You will learn to love me," he said, "for I shall take you
whether you will or no.  You hate The Sheik and so you will not
tell him, for if you do I will tell him of the picture.  I hate
The Sheik, and--"
<P>
"You hate The Sheik?" came a grim voice from behind them.
<P>
Both turned to see The Sheik standing a few paces from them.
Abdul still held the picture in his hand.  Now he thrust it
within his burnous.
<P>
"Yes," he said, "I hate the Sheik," and as he spoke he sprang
toward the older man, felled him with a blow and dashed on
across the village to the line where his horse was picketed,
saddled and ready, for Abdul Kamak had been about to ride
forth to hunt when he had seen the stranger girl alone by
the bushes.
<P>
Leaping into the saddle Abdul Kamak dashed for the village gates. 
The Sheik, momentarily stunned by the blow that had felled him,
now staggered to his feet, shouting lustily to his followers to
stop the escaped Arab.  A dozen blacks leaped forward to intercept
the horseman, only to be ridden down or brushed aside by the muzzle
of Abdul Kamak's long musket, which he lashed from side to side
about him as he spurred on toward the gate.  But here he must
surely be intercepted.  Already the two blacks stationed there
were pushing the unwieldy portals to.  Up flew the barrel of the
fugitive's weapon.  With reins flying loose and his horse at a mad
gallop the son of the desert fired once--twice; and both the keepers
of the gate dropped in their tracks.  With a wild whoop of exultation,
twirling his musket high above his head and turning in his saddle
to laugh back into the faces of his pursuers Abdul Kamak dashed
out of the village of The Sheik and was swallowed up by the jungle.
<P>
Foaming with rage The Sheik ordered immediate pursuit, and
then strode rapidly back to where Meriem sat huddled by the
bushes where he had left her.
<P>
"The picture!" he cried.  "What picture did the dog speak of? 
Where is it?  Give it to me at once!"
<P>
"He took it," replied Meriem, dully.
<P>
"What was it?" again demanded The Sheik, seizing the girl
roughly by the hair and dragging her to her feet, where he shook
her venomously.  "What was it a picture of?"
<P>
"Of me," said Meriem, "when I was a little girl.  I stole it
from Malbihn, the Swede--it had printing on the back cut from
an old newspaper."
<P>
The Sheik went white with rage.
<P>
"What said the printing?" he asked in a voice so low that she
but barely caught his words.
<P>
"I do not know.  It was in French and I cannot read French."
<P>
The Sheik seemed relieved.  He almost smiled, nor did he
again strike Meriem before he turned and strode away with the
parting admonition that she speak never again to any other than
Mabunu and himself.  And along the caravan trail galloped Abdul
Kamak toward the north.
<P>
<P>
As his canoe drifted out of sight and range of the wounded
Swede the Hon. Morison sank weakly to its bottom where he
lay for long hours in partial stupor.
<P>
It was night before he fully regained consciousness.  And then
he lay for a long time looking up at the stars and trying to
recollect where he was, what accounted for the gently rocking
motion of the thing upon which he lay, and why the position of
the stars changed so rapidly and miraculously.  For a while
he thought he was dreaming, but when he would have moved to
shake sleep from him the pain of his wound recalled to him the
events that had led up to his present position.  Then it was
that he realized that he was floating down a great African river
in a native canoe--alone, wounded, and lost.
<P>
Painfully he dragged himself to a sitting position.  He noticed
that the wound pained him less than he had imagined it would.
He felt of it gingerly--it had ceased to bleed.  Possibly it
was but a flesh wound after all, and nothing serious.  If it
totally incapacitated him even for a few days it would mean
death, for by that time he would be too weakened by hunger and
pain to provide food for himself.
<P>
From his own troubles his mind turned to Meriem's.  That she
had been with the Swede at the time he had attempted to reach
the fellow's camp he naturally believed; but he wondered what
would become of her now.  Even if Hanson died of his wounds
would Meriem be any better off?  She was in the power of equally
villainous men--brutal savages of the lowest order.  Baynes buried
his face in his hands and rocked back and forth as the hideous
picture of her fate burned itself into his consciousness.  And it
was he who had brought this fate upon her!  His wicked desire
had snatched a pure and innocent girl from the protection of
those who loved her to hurl her into the clutches of the bestial
Swede and his outcast following!  And not until it had become
too late had he realized the magnitude of the crime he himself
had planned and contemplated.  Not until it had become too late
had he realized that greater than his desire, greater than his lust,
greater than any passion he had ever felt before was the newborn
love that burned within his breast for the girl he would have ruined.
<P>
The Hon. Morison Baynes did not fully realize the change
that had taken place within him.  Had one suggested that he ever
had been aught than the soul of honor and chivalry he would
have taken umbrage forthwith.  He knew that he had done a vile
thing when he had plotted to carry Meriem away to London, yet
he excused it on the ground of his great passion for the girl
having temporarily warped his moral standards by the intensity
of its heat.  But, as a matter of fact, a new Baynes had been born.
Never again could this man be bent to dishonor by the intensity
of a desire.  His moral fiber had been strengthened by the mental
suffering he had endured.  His mind and his soul had been purged
by sorrow and remorse.
<P>
His one thought now was to atone--win to Meriem's side and
lay down his life, if necessary, in her protection.  His eyes
sought the length of the canoe in search of the paddle, for a
determination had galvanized him to immediate action despite
his weakness and his wound.  But the paddle was gone.  He turned
his eyes toward the shore.  Dimly through the darkness of a
moonless night he saw the awful blackness of the jungle, yet it
touched no responsive chord of terror within him now as it had
done in the past.  He did not even wonder that he was unafraid, for
his mind was entirely occupied with thoughts of another's danger.
<P>
Drawing himself to his knees he leaned over the edge of the
canoe and commenced to paddle vigorously with his open palm.
Though it tired and hurt him he kept assiduously at his self
imposed labor for hours.  Little by little the drifting canoe moved
nearer and nearer the shore.  The Hon. Morison could hear a
lion roaring directly opposite him and so close that he felt he
must be almost to the shore.  He drew his rifle closer to his side;
but he did not cease to paddle.
<P>
After what seemed to the tired man an eternity of time he felt
the brush of branches against the canoe and heard the swirl of
the water about them.  A moment later he reached out and
clutched a leafy limb.  Again the lion roared--very near it
seemed now, and Baynes wondered if the brute could have been
following along the shore waiting for him to land.
<P>
He tested the strength of the limb to which he clung.  It seemed
strong enough to support a dozen men.  Then he reached down
and lifted his rifle from the bottom of the canoe, slipping the
sling over his shoulder.  Again he tested the branch, and then
reaching upward as far as he could for a safe hold he drew
himself painfully and slowly upward until his feet swung clear
of the canoe, which, released, floated silently from beneath him
to be lost forever in the blackness of the dark shadows down stream.
<P>
He had burned his bridges behind him.  He must either climb aloft
or drop back into the river; but there had been no other way. 
He struggled to raise one leg over the limb, but found himself
scarce equal to the effort, for he was very weak.  For a time
he hung there feeling his strength ebbing.  He knew that he
must gain the branch above at once or it would be too late.
<P>
Suddenly the lion roared almost in his ear.  Baynes glanced up. 
He saw two spots of flame a short distance from and above him. 
The lion was standing on the bank of the river glaring at him,
and--waiting for him.  Well, thought the Hon. Morison, let
him wait.  Lions can't climb trees, and if I get into this
one I shall be safe enough from him.
<P>
The young Englishman's feet hunt almost to the surface of the
water--closer than he knew, for all was pitch dark below as
above him.  Presently he heard a slight commotion in the river
beneath him and something banged against one of his feet,
followed almost instantly by a sound that he felt he could not
have mistaken--the click of great jaws snapping together.
<P>
"By George!" exclaimed the Hon. Morison, aloud.  "The beggar
nearly got me," and immediately he struggled again to climb
higher and to comparative safety; but with that final effort
he knew that it was futile.  Hope that had survived persistently
until now began to wane.  He felt his tired, numbed fingers
slipping from their hold--he was dropping back into the river--
into the jaws of the frightful death that awaited him there.
<P>
And then he heard the leaves above him rustle to the movement of
a creature among them.  The branch to which he clung bent beneath
an added weight--and no light weight, from the way it sagged; but
still Baynes clung desperately--he would not give up voluntarily
either to the death above or the death below.
<P>
He felt a soft, warm pad upon the fingers of one of his hands
where they circled the branch to which he clung, and then
something reached down out of the blackness above and dragged
him up among the branches of the tree.
