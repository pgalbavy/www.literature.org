<p>When I came to the library the door stood partly open, and I
could see a party of gentlemen lounging within, and somewhat boisterous
over their wine and filberts; so thinking no harm to enter, I
walked in and sat down on the arm of a leather chair by the window.</p>

<p>Nobody had observed me, however, and I was on the point of respectfully
making known my presence to Sir William, when I saw Walter Butler
rise and shut the door, taking the additional precaution to lock
it. Turning to rejoin the company around the table, his dark golden
eyes fell upon me, and he stood still, one hand tightening on
the back of his chair.</p>

<p>"Well?" inquired Sir William, testily, looking up at Mr. Butler.
"When you are seated, sir, I will continue, unless I weary the
company."</p>

<p>"If Mr. Cardigan has been here all this time, I, for one, was
not aware of it," observed Mr. Butler, coldly, never taking his
unblinking eyes off me.</p>

<p>I began to explain to Sir William that I had but that moment
came in, when he interrupted querulously, and motioned Mr. Butler
to be seated.</p>

<p>"Tush! tush! Let be, let be, Captain Butler! My young kinsman
has my confidence, and it is time he should know something of
what passes in his own country."</p>

<p>"At sixteen," observed my Lord Dunmore, with a maudlin chuckle,
"I knew a thing or two, I'll warrant you&mdash;curse me if I didn't,
Sir William!"</p>

<p>Sir John Johnson regarded me without interest; Colonel Claus
never even troubled to give me a glance, but I saw the hawk's
eyes of Walter Butler watching me steadily.</p>

<p>"To resume," began Sir William, but Lord Dunmore broke out:</p>

<p>"At sixteen I had outlived you all&mdash;pierce me if I hadn't, now,
Sir William! Scratch me raw! if I hadn't put a finger in the world's
pudding, a-stirring the plums at sixteen, by God!"</p>

<p>"Doubtless, my Lord," said Sir William, dryly. "And now, gentlemen,
concerning our show of force here, I have only to say&mdash;and I say
it with all respect and submission to Governor Tryon&mdash;that I do
not believe it will produce that salutary effect on the discontented
in New York and Boston which Governor Tryon expects."</p>

<p>"Gad! I <em>do</em> expect it!" said Tryon, briskly. "Look you,
Sir William, you and your militia dominate the county, and these
rascals must be brought to understand it. Trust me, messires,
the damned Yankees will know of this militia display before the
post rides into Boston!"</p>

<p>"Add our Mohawks to the militia," observed Walter Butler, in
a colourless voice.</p>

<p>Sir William's jaw was set hard, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Add the whole Six Nations," suggested Lord Dunmore, leering
at Sir William; "come, now! curse me blind! but we shall have
the whole Six Nations, and that filthy little Red Jacket to boot."</p>

<p>"My Lord," replied Sir William, "if it lay with your Lordship
you would have Red Jacket against you."</p>

<p>This blunt rebuke almost sobered Lord Dunmore for a moment, and
he asked Sir William what he meant.</p>

<p>"I mean," said the Baronet, "that you mocked this powerful chief,
Red Jacket, at my table to-night, and he knew it. That is not
the way to gain allies, my Lord."</p>

<p>"The drunken, guzzling son of a slut!" bawled Lord Dunmore, "d'ye
think I care what the bandy-legged little beast thinks?"</p>

<p>"I only know," replied Sir William, curtly, "that if your Lordship
has so conducted in Virginia, the King cannot look for any Indian
support in that colony."</p>

<p>"Oh, choke me, Sir William, but that's too bad now!&mdash;pinch me
blue if it isn't!" protested Lord Dunmore in a pet. Then a subtle
smirk settled on his waxen cast of a face and he winked his weak
eyes at Walter Butler, a proceeding observed by me and by Sir
William.</p>

<p>Not for a moment now did I doubt that Lord Dunmore had set Colonel
Cresap to drive the Cayugas into a hatred for the colonies, nor
did I doubt but that Walter Butler knew of this plan, perhaps
had even connived at it.</p>

<p>Sir William, too, had come to some quick conclusion, for I saw
the crease deepen around his jaws, and his steady eyes strike
fire. But he said nothing to interrupt Lord Dunmore, who had now
launched into a gust of incoherent words and protestations and
hiccoughs, to which all listened sneeringly until his voice ended
with a hollow buzz inside his wine-glass.</p>

<p>There came a silence, broken by the clear sarcastic tones of
Sir William.</p>

<p>"I beg permission to submit to Governor Tryon the opinion of
a country Baronet&mdash;for what that opinion may be worth."</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said Governor Tryon, cordially, looking up from
the plate of nuts he was picking.</p>

<p>"And this is my opinion," continued Sir William, "that, firstly,
the disaffected classes in Boston and New York will not care a
fig for our conference here, nor for our show of militia; that,
secondly, if they should once entertain a suspicion that England,
in the event of war, proposes to employ savages as allies to subdue
rebellion, we would have to-morrow the thirteen colonies swarming
like thirteen hives to sting us all to death&mdash;ay&mdash;and there would
not be an Indian left twixt here and the Ohio!"</p>

<p>"What would become of them?" piped up Lord Dunmore, so innocently
that I saw Governor Tryon pass his hand over his mouth to conceal
a smile. But Walter Butler's passionless voice was sounding now,
and I saw Sir William turn his head to lose no gesture or shade
of meaning.</p>

<p>"It is come to the point where either the rebels are to win over
the Indians, or where we must take measures to secure their services.
I am not in a position to inform you, gentlemen, as to the actual
existing conditions in the Indian Department. That, Sir William
can do better than any one in America. Therefore, I beg Sir William
to kindly make it clear to us what chances we have to win the
support of the Six Nations&mdash;in the event of a rebel rising against
the King's authority."</p>

<p>The tangled knot was cut, the cat had sprung from the bag. Yet
nobody by glance or word or gesture appeared to be aware of it.</p>

<p>Sir William's manner was perfectly composed, though that deep
crease binding his chin deepened, and his brows bent in towards
his nose as he rested his chin on his hand and spoke, eyes fixed
on his wine-glass:</p>

<p>"Captain Butler believes that it has come to this: that either
those in authority or the disaffected must seek allies among these
savage hordes which hang like thunder-clouds along our frontiers.
Gentlemen, I am not of that opinion. I have said openly, and I
care not who knows it, that if war must come between England and
these colonies, let it be a white man's war; in mercy, let it
be a war between two civilized peoples, and not a butchery of
demons!</p>

<p>"I do believe&mdash;and I say so solemnly and before God&mdash;that it
is possible to so conduct that these savages will remain neutral
if war must come. Ay, more! <em>I</em> will answer for them!"</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and looked straight at Lord Dunmore, raising
his voice slightly, but betraying no passion.</p>

<p>"And, gentlemen, as I am his Majesty's intendant of Indian affairs
in North America, I shall now do all that I can to pacify my wards,
to keep them calm and orderly in the event of a war which I, for
one, regard with horror. Were I to do otherwise, I must account
to my King for a trust betrayed, and I must answer also to Him
whom King and subject alike account to."</p>

<p>On Walter Butler's lips a sneer twitched; my Lord Dunmore wiped
his bleared eyes with a rag of lace and stared at everybody with
drunken gravity.</p>

<p>"I know not," said Sir William, slowly, "what true loyalty may
be if it be not to save the honour of our King, and rebuke those
who seek to tarnish it. And if there are now those among his counsellors
or deputies who urge him to seek these savages as allies, I say
it is a monstrous thing and an inspiration from hell itself."</p>

<p>He swung on his elbow and fixed his eyes on Walter Butler.</p>

<p>"You, sir, know something of border war. How then can you propose
to let loose these Indians on the people of our colonies?"</p>

<p>"Lest they let loose these same savages on us," replied Mr. Butler,
calmly.</p>

<p>Sir William frowned.</p>

<p>"You do not know the colonists, Mr. Butler," he said. "What marvel
then that my Lord North should misunderstand them, and think to
buy their loyalty with tuppence worth o' tea?"</p>

<p>"Come, come, Sir William!" cried Governor Tryon, laughing, and
plainly anxious to break the tension ere sharp words flew. "Did
I not know you to the bone, sir, I should deem it my duty to catechise
you concerning the six articles of loyalty!"</p>

<p>"I, too, i' faith!" squeaked Lord Dunmore. "Skewer me! Sir William,
but you talk like a Boston preacher&mdash;ay&mdash;that you do, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have done, sir!" cut in Sir William, with such bitter contempt
that the faces of all present sobered quickly. Even Governor Tryon
glanced uneasily at Lord Dunmore to see how he might swallow such
a pill, but that nobleman only blinked stupidly and sucked his
thin lips, too drunk to understand how like a lackey he had been
silenced.</p>

<p>Sir John Johnson and Colonel Claus, deputies to Sir William in
the Indian Department, exchanged puzzled glances. But I noticed
that Mr. Butler never took his eyes from Sir William's darkening
visage.</p>

<p>"There is one more matter," said the Baronet, "that I may be
pardoned for introducing here amid all the perplexities of the
times; but it is a matter touching on my own stewardship, and
as that concerns my King, I deem it necessary to broach it."</p>

<p>He turned again deliberately on Lord Dunmore.</p>

<p>"It has come to my knowledge that certain unauthorized people
are tampering with a distant tribe of my Cayuga Indians. I know
not, nor do I care, what the motives of these men may be, but
I protest against it, and I shall do all in my power&mdash;without
infringing on the rights or laws of a sister colony&mdash;to protect
my Cayugas from unlawful aggression!"</p>

<p>"Damme!" gurgled Lord Dunmore, passing his jewelled hand over
his befuddled head. "Damme, Sir William, d'ye mean to accuse me?
Curse me! Skewer me! Claw me raw! but it is not fair," he snivelled.
"No, it is not fair! Take your hands off my sleeve and be done
a-twitching it, Captain Butler! Damme! I never set Cresap on.
Will ye have done a-pinching my arm, Captain Butler?"</p>

<p>The ghastly humour of the exposure, the ludicrous self-conviction
of his tipsy Lordship&mdash;for nobody had mentioned Cresap&mdash;the startling
disclosure, too, of Walter Butler's interest in the plot&mdash;for
that it was a plot no longer could anybody doubt&mdash;cast a gloom
over the company.</p>

<p>Every man present understood what Cresap's aggression meant;
no man there dared acknowledge a desire for Cresap's success.</p>

<p>Then Sir William's sarcastic voice pierced the silence.</p>

<p>"I trust your Lordship would not believe that any gentleman present
could harbour suspicions of a foul conspiracy between your Lordship
and Captain Butler, to incite my Cayugas to attack white men!"</p>

<p>Walter Butler's slow eye rested on Lord Dunmore, on Sir William,
and then on me. But his bloodless visage never changed.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, gentlemen, let us have harmony here at any cost,"
protested Governor Tryon, half in jest, half in earnest. "God
knows I have discord enough in New York town without seeking it
among the loyalists of this county. Nobody believes that my Lord
Dunmore is seeking trouble with your tame Indians, Sir William.
If this fellow Cresap, who is a notorious malcontent, too, be
imposing on the Cayugas, I doubt not that my Lord Dunmore will
recall him and deal with him severely."</p>

<p>"No, I won't! Claw my vitals if I do!" snapped his Lordship,
in the drunken sulks, and straightway fell a-squabbling with Walter
Butler, who had again laid a hand on his arm.</p>

<p>For Captain Butler knew his treachery had been discovered, and
his shameless impudence in openly attempting to muzzle his noble
partner in conspiracy passed all bounds of decency.</p>

<p>I saw the angry light glimmer in Sir William's eyes, and I knew
it boded no good to Walter Butler, as far as his hope of Silver
Heels was concerned. A fierce happiness filled me. So now, at
last, Sir William was discovering the fangs in his pet snake!</p>

<p>Lord Dunmore had succeeded in reversing a decanter of port over
himself and Colonel Claus, and the latter, mad as a wet cat, left
the room swearing audibly, while his playful Lordship threw a
few glasses after him and then collapsed in a soiled heap of silk
and jewels, feebly calling on "Billy Tryon" to try and "conduc
like er&mdash;er&mdash;gen'l-m'n, b' God!"</p>

<p>Sir William was steadily staring at Walter Butler; I, too, had
my eye on him; and, when he left the table to saunter towards
the door, Sir William rose immediately to follow him, and I after
Sir William.</p>

<p>He saw us coming as he opened the door, and surveyed us with
cool effrontery as we joined him in the hallway.</p>

<p>"I shall not require your services hereafter as my secretary,
Captain Butler," said Sir William. "Will you kindly hand your
keys to me?"</p>

<p>"At your command, Sir William," replied Mr. Butler, drawing the
keys from his pocket and presenting them with an ironical inclination.</p>

<p>The man's careless self-possession was marvellous considering
he was facing the man he had so vilely betrayed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Butler," said Sir William, with reddening face, "I consider
myself released from my consent to your union with my kinswoman,
Miss Warren!"</p>

<p>"As to that, sir," observed Captain Butler, cynically, "I shall
take my chances."</p>

<p>I heard what he said, but Sir William misunderstood him.</p>

<p>"It is your mischance, sir, to put no harsher interpretation
on it. But my decision is irrevocable, Mr. Butler, for I have
destined Miss Warren to a loyal man, my kinsman, Michael Cardigan!"</p>

<p>The spasm that jerked Mr. Butler's mouth into that ghastly grimace
I knew so well, was not lost on Sir William.</p>

<p>"I'll take that chance, too," said Mr. Butler, bowing.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?" demanded Sir William, steadying his
voice with an effort.</p>

<p>But Walter Butler only replied with such glare at me that Sir
William involuntarily turned to find me, rigid, behind him. The
next moment Captain Butler passed noiselessly out into the starlight,
wrapping his black cloak around him.</p>

<p>Sir William followed him mechanically to the door, and I at his
heels, burning for a quarrel with Walter Butler, and awaiting
only for Sir William to return to the library, and leave me free
to follow and insult Mr. Butler for the treacherous villain he
had proved himself.</p>

<p>But Sir William, seeing me slinking out, laid a hand on my shoulder
and spun me sharply round on my heels to look into my eyes.</p>

<p>"Now what the devil are <em>you</em> up to?" he broke out, half
divining the truth. "Michael! Michael! Don't be a fool! Are there
not fools enough here to-night?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," I answered, sheepishly.</p>

<p>"That is not the way to serve me, lad," said Sir William, roughly.
"Have I not sorrow enough without seeing you carried in here with
a hole in your breast, you meddlesome ass?"</p>

<p>"I have a certain score to clean off," I muttered.</p>

<p>"Oh," observed Sir William, coldly, "a selfish quarrel&mdash;eh? I
was a fond old fool to think I might count on you."</p>

<p>Tears started to my eyes; I could have bitten my tongue off.</p>

<p>"You can count on me, sir," I said, choking out the words. "I
meant no harm; I am not selfish, sir; I care only for you."</p>

<p>"I know it, lad," he said, kindly. "And mind, I do not rebuke
your spirit; I only ask you to learn discretion. This is no time
to settle private matters. No man in America has that right now,
because every man's life belongs to the country!"</p>

<p>"On which side, sir?" I faltered.</p>

<p>Sir William was silent for a while. Presently he took my arm
and we walked out under the stars.</p>

<p>"My boy," he said, sadly, "I cannot answer you, but I can place
matters in a clear light for you. The decision must remain with
yourself."</p>

<p>Then he told me how the Boston people had been taxed without
their consent, but I could not see why they should not cheerfully
give their all to their King, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Sir William, gravely. "Let us approach the
matter from your personal view. Here are you, young, vigorous,
of good lineage, and sure to succeed to your uncle's title and
estate some day. You are, at sixteen, an officer of his Majesty's
border cavalry; you have every prospect of promotion; the King
remembers your father, Governor Tryon is your friend. And I, Michael,
have decided to leave you, in my testament, sufficient to maintain
you handsomely should you desire to marry Felicity before your
uncle's death. <em>That</em>, my boy, is the <em>King's side</em>.</p>

<p>"Now suppose, from a high motive of duty, you should suddenly
resolve to embrace the cause of the plain people. Could you renounce
your commission in the King's army to shoulder a firelock, perhaps
a stable-fork, in the ranks of your countrymen? Could you give
up ease, hopes, position? Could you give up your friends and kinsmen?
Could you give up what sum I may leave you in my will? For Sir
John would never let a penny of my money go to a rebel. Could
you give up, if need be, the woman you loved? Think, and be not
in haste to answer. For <em>that</em> is the <em>other</em> side
to embrace, with perhaps a hangman's rope at the end."</p>

<p>"Am I to answer you to-night, sir?" I asked.</p>

<p>"God forbid!" he said, solemnly.</p>

<p>"I will say this," said I; "that where my heart is, I would follow
in rags. And my heart is with you, sir."</p>

<p>He stood still, drawing me closer, but said nothing more, for
there came running out of the darkness an officer with naked claymore
shining in the starlight, and when he drew near we saw it was
Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>"The Indian is gone!" he panted. "Gone away crazed with fever!
The doctor lies in the hut with a broken shoulder; Quider crushed
it in his madness!"</p>

<p>Sir William swayed as though struck.</p>

<p>"The sentries chased him to the woods," continued poor Duncan,
out of breath; "but he ran like a panther and&mdash;we had your orders
not to fire. He will die, anyhow; the doctor says he will seek
some creek or pond and die in the water like a poisoned rat. They
are bringing the doctor now."</p>

<p>Up out of the shadow loomed two soldiers, forming a litter with
their muskets, on which sat our doctor, Pierson, head hanging.
And when Sir William came to him he looked up with a sick grimace
and shook his head feebly.</p>

<p>"He broke those ropes as though they had been worsted," he said.
"I tried to hold him down, but he had the strength of delirium,
Sir William. I want that fat surgeon of the Royal Americans to
set this bone," he added, weakly, and fell a-groaning.</p>

<p>Mr. Duncan started on a run for the barracks; the soldiers and
the injured man passed on towards the guard-house, and Sir William
stood staring after them.</p>

<p>Presently he said, aloud, "God's will be done on my poor country!"</p>

<p>We walked back to the house together. Some of the guests were
leaving, but the card-room was still crowded, and in the library
my Lord Dunmore lay on the carpet cursing and vomiting and shrieking
that no man should put him to bed, and that he meant to crack
another bottle or a dozen heads.</p>

<p>Here and there, out through the orchard, drunken Indians lurched
lodgeward, followed by their patient squaws; here and there sedan-chairs
passed, the grunting bearers stepping lively in the brisk night
wind.</p>

<p>Below the hill, in Johnstown, the court-house windows were still
twinkling with lights, and when the wind set our way, we could
hear the distant strains of the brigade band playing for the dancers.</p>

<p>Sir William entered the hallway of his house and looked around.
In a corner of one window sat Mrs. Hamilton and Mr. Bevan, somewhat
close together; in another window were gathered Colonel Claus
and his lady and Sir John Johnson, whispering. Brant, surrounded
by a bevy of fine ladies, was turning over the pages of a book
and answering questions in polite monosyllables, for he had a
quiet contempt for those who regarded him as a curiosity, though
susceptible enough to real homage.</p>

<p>"And out of all my house," murmured Sir William, in a bitter
voice, "not one whom I can trust&mdash;not one!&mdash;not one!"</p>

<p>After a moment I plucked at his sleeve, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know &mdash;I know, my boy. But I need a man now&mdash;a man
of experience, a man in bodily vigour, a man in devotion."</p>

<p>"You need a man to go to Colonel Cresap," I whispered. For the
first and only time in my life I saw that I had startled Sir William.</p>

<p>"Let me go, sir?" I entreated, eagerly. "If I am keen enough
to read your purpose, I am not too stupid to carry it out. I know
what you wish. I know you cannot trust your message to paper,
nor to a living soul except me. I know what to say to Colonel
Cresap. Let me serve you, sir, for I do long so to help you?"</p>

<p>We had fallen back to the porch again while I was speaking, Sir
William holding me so tightly by the elbow that his clutch numbed
my arm.</p>

<p>"I cannot," he muttered, under his breath. "To-morrow Dunmore
will set his spies to see that Cresap remains undisturbed. The
Ohio trails will be watched for a messenger from me. Who knows
what Dunmore's and Butler's men might do to carry out their designs
on my Cayugas?"</p>

<p>"Dare they attack an officer in uniform?" I asked, astonished.</p>

<p>"What is there to prevent a shot in ambush? And are there no
renegades in Johnstown to hire?" replied Sir William, bitterly.
"Why, the town's full of them, lad; men as desperate as Jack Mount
himself."</p>

<p>"But I know the woods! You, yourself, sir, say I am a very Mohawk
in the woods!" I pleaded. "I fear no ambush, though the highwayman
Jack Mount himself were after me. Have I not been twice to the
Virginia line with Brant? Do you think I could fail to reach Cresap
with the whole forest as plain to me as the Stony Way below this
hill? And remember I carry no papers to be stolen. I could first
go with belts to the Cayugas, and tell the truth about Quider
and his party. Then I would deliver the belts as you delivered
them to Quider. Then I would find Cresap and show him what a fool
he is."</p>

<p>"And so serve the enemies of the King?" said Sir William, looking
keenly at me.</p>

<p>"And so serve you, sir," I retorted, in a flash. "Are you an
enemy to the King?"</p>

<p>"But, my boy," said Sir William, huskily, "do you understand
that you must go alone on this mission?"</p>

<p>I sprang forward and threw my arms around him with a hug like
a young bear.</p>

<p>"Then I'm going! I'm going!" I whispered, enchanted, while he
murmured brokenly that he could not spare me and that I was all
he had on earth.</p>

<p>But I would not be denied; I coaxed him to my little bedroom,
lighted the candle, and made him sit down on my cot. Then I explained
excitedly my purpose, and to prove that I knew the trails, I sharpened
my treasured Faber pencil and made a drawing for him, noting every
ford and carrying-place&mdash;which latter I proposed to avoid&mdash;and
finally hazarded a guess as to the exact spot where Colonel Cresap
might be found.</p>

<p>Also, in pantomime and whispers, I rehearsed the part I meant
to play before the Cayugas, making the speeches that Sir William
had made to Quider, as nearly as I could remember, and delivering
each belt in dumb show and with all the dignity I could command,
till I came to the last, which, by mistake, I spoke of as a <em>red</em>
instead of <em>black</em> belt.</p>

<p>"Wait," interrupted Sir William, who had become deeply interested;
"what is 'black' in the Mohawk tongue?"</p>

<p>"Kahonji," I replied, promptly.</p>

<p>"And in Onondaga?"</p>

<p>"Osuntah, sir."</p>

<p>"And in Cayuga?"</p>

<p>I hesitated, then blushed, for I did not know.</p>

<p>"Sweandaea," said Sir William, gravely; "how are you to bear
my peace-belts if you know not the red of war from the black of
good intent?"</p>

<p>"I should have said 'Hot-Kwah-Weyo'&mdash;<em>good</em>-red, not <em>war</em>-red,"
I replied, so naïvely that Sir William laughed outright.</p>

<p>"With such resourceful impudence," he said, "you cannot be misunderstood
among the Six Nations. It eases my mind to find you quick and
ingenious in a tight place, lad. But, Michael, have a care to
use no Delaware words, for that would render my Cayugas suspicious."</p>

<p>I promised eagerly, and we sat down together to go over the trail,
mile by mile, computing the circles I should be obliged to take
to avoid the carrying-places where spies were most to be feared.</p>

<p>"Dunmore rides South in a week," said Sir William. "But he will
not wait till he reaches Virginia before he sends out his emissaries
to urge Cresap on. You must beat them, lad, and go afoot at that."</p>

<p>"I can go the faster," said I. "Horses are useless in the Pennsylvania
bush until you reach Crown Gap. I take it that Lord Dunmore's
men, being Virginians, will go mounted, and that gives me double
time to reach Cresap."</p>

<p>And so we sat there together on the bed, planning, suggesting
precautions, counting the dangers and mischances only to discount
them with confidence in my knowledge of woodcraft, and the night
wore on till my candle sank into a lake of wax, trailing a long,
flaring flame.</p>

<p>"There is one thing I have thought of," said I, soberly. "It
is this: if I am going out as an enemy to the King, I cannot for
shame aid me by wearing the King's uniform. Therefore, with your
approval, sir, I will go in my buckskins, unless you believe that,
by this journey of mine, I will benefit our King."</p>

<p>"Then," said Sir William, slowly, "you must go in your buckskins,
lad."</p>

<p>The moment had come; I was face to face with it now.</p>

<p>"Am&mdash;am I to resign my commission in the Border Horse, sir?"
I faltered. The prospect of the sacrifice choked my speech, and
my heart swelled with a grief that sent the water to my eyes in
spite of me.</p>

<p>Sir William considered me in silence, then broke out: "No, no!
Not yet. Who knows but what this war may never break over us!
No, no, my boy! Your errand is an errand of justice and mercy.
I send you as my own messenger. It is my duty to protect my Cayugas,
and it is yours to obey me. You may, for the present at least,
retain your commission and your sword with honour. It is Dunmore
and Butler we are fighting now, not our King."</p>

<p>"I shall go in my buckskins, anyhow," I said, cheerfully, and
thankful that the evil moment had been put off&mdash;that evil moment
which I now understood was surely coming for us both. He knew
it, too; his face was loose and seamed and gray and haggard; the
light of the candle's smoky wick, swimming in wax, threw ghastly
shadows over brow and cheeks.</p>

<p>As we sat there, my hand in his, staring at the phantoms of that
ominous future, I heard Silver Heels come running up the stairs
and stop at my door, calling out to Sir William.</p>

<p>When I opened the door she drew back scornfully, but, catching
a glimpse of Sir William within, she marched past me and perched
herself on Sir William's knees, both arms around his neck.</p>

<p>What she whispered to him I could not hear, but he promptly shook
his head in refusal, and presently it came out that she was teasing
to be allowed to go with a certain fat dame, Lady Shelton, and
make a month's stay with her at Pittsburg.</p>

<p>"I do so long to go," pleaded Silver Heels. "I have never been
anywhere, you know. And we are to have such rare pleasures at
the June running races, and there will be horses from Virginia
and Maryland and New York, and we are to have dancing every evening
and a dinner given for me! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! I want to go so
much! I truly do, sir, and I should be so happy and so thankful
to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, stop your chatter, Felicity!" cried Sir William,
striving to undo her arms from his neck, but she only kissed him
and clung so tightly and reproachfully that he gave up in sheer
fatigue.</p>

<p>"Oh, go, then! Go, you little witch! And mind you take Betty
with you! And mind that Aunt Mary provides for you ere you go!"</p>

<p>Silver Heels embraced him rapturously with a little shout of
delight, and sped away to the nursery without a glance at me.
What did I care? I had begun to dislike her cordially; I could
afford to, now that she in her turn disliked Mr. Bevan.</p>

<p>I had also the savage satisfaction of remembering that she was
free of Walter Butler forever, and I observed her departure grimly.
As for Sir William's new desire to see us wedded, I had not at
all made up my mind. Besides, Silver Heels despised me, and I
would not endure that.</p>

<p>Presently Sir William rose and walked out into the hallway, saying,
with affected carelessness: "Then you will start before dawn,
Michael?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said I, cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I shall be in the library when you go. Stop there a moment."</p>

<p>His voice was quivering, but he did not flinch, and I heard him
descending the stairs towards the nursery where Mistress Molly
was saying: "What is all this about Felicity's journeying to Pittsburg,
Sir William? Why, the child has no clothes that befit her rank
and station, dear, and the expense&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tush! Who cares for the expense? If she's going she's got enough
to start with, and I'll send to New York, my dear. Of course I
know our little maid must outshine the rest o' them, Molly. Make
a list for York, and I'll send it by Billy Tryon."</p>

<p>Their voices were shut out with the nursery door closing, and
I stole back through the dark entry into my room and lighted another
candle.</p>

<p>In the feverish delight of preparation, I gave little thought
to Silver Heels. Excitement at the nearness of my departure proved
a lively antidote for sorrow&mdash;nay, the fever of anticipation burnt
out regret and seared with its caustic the frail unopened bud
of romance.</p>

<p>Silver Heels? Silver Heels? What did I care now? Let her live
to regret it all&mdash;after I had gone! Let her live to marvel at
my mysterious disappearance, and vainly seek to solve it until
I returned, loaded with glory and importance. Then I might see
her at Fort Pitt. But what did I care? She couldn't marry Walter
Butler; the dragoon Bevan belonged to Mrs. Hamilton; and now she
was going to Pittsburg to see the races and be rid of both Butler
and Bevan. So all was right everywhere; let the world spin on!
As for me, I was off for glory and the green delight of the woodlands
that I loved.</p>

<p>I made up my pack on the bed: a blanket, four pairs of Mohawk
moccasins, a change of flannels, a spare shirt, and three pairs
of knitted socks. Down in the store-room I found corn-meal, salt,
and pork, and tied each in its sack. Powder and ball were to be
had in the guard-house, so I ran across the grass and into the
block-house where Wraxall, our sottish Johnstown barber, stood
shaving Mr. Duncan.</p>

<p>"Better join me in a midnight shave!" he called out, as I darted
past and unhooked the keys of the magazine from the brass nail
over the fireplace.</p>

<p>When I returned with the powder and bullets I weighed them in
the guard-house scales and gave Mr. Duncan a written receipt for
them.</p>

<p>"Come! come! Mr. Cardigan," he said, "would you kill deer in
May? What the deuce do you want of all this powder? Nobody has
dug up any war-hatchets that I know of."</p>

<p>Wraxall, who was strapping his razor, looked at me curiously.
I ignored Mr. Duncan's banter and plumped myself into the chair
where he had been sitting.</p>

<p>"A close shave for Mr. Cardigan!" said Mr. Duncan, holding his
dripping face over the barber's basin. "Unless," he added, politely,
"the gentleman desires you to leave his mustachios à la Française."</p>

<p>My face being as smooth as a girl's, the barber sneered, but
I bade him lather me deep and have a care to follow grain. I cared
not a whit for Mr. Duncan's mirth, I was too happy, and when Wraxall
had scraped me well, I ordered him to shear off my hair.</p>

<p>"Piteous Heaven!" exclaimed Mr. Duncan. "Nay, barber!&mdash;spare
that queue!"</p>

<p>"Off it drops!" said I, briskly. "Now get the hair-powder out,
and trim my hair to a crop, Wraxall! Whew! man, don't breathe
on me, you malt-worm! I don't want to get drunk, I want a cropped
head!"</p>

<p>"Shaved for a wig, sir?" demanded Wraxall, sulkily, fiddling
with his shears.</p>

<p>"No, no," I replied, hastily, while Mr. Duncan roared with laughter;
"I don't desire a shaved pate, my friend. Cut it à la coureur-de-bois!"</p>

<p>"Do you expect to take the King's highway with Jack Mount?" asked
Mr. Duncan. But I refused to be drawn out, and finally he went
away with his curiosity on tenter-hooks and none the wiser.</p>

<p>When Wraxall had shorn me and removed the powder from my hair,
I gathered up my ammunition and provisions and hastened back to
the house. The place was dark save for a light in the library.
I felt my way up the stairs and into my chamber, where I first
filled bullet-pouch and powder-horn, then rolled the spare ammunition
and provisions into my pack and buckled the load tightly.</p>

<p>Now, rapidly undressing, I donned a new hunting-shirt and leggings,
first making sure that the fringe had not been weakened by mice,
to leave me without cords should I need them. Over my shoulders
I slung powder-horn and bullet-pouch, slipped hatchet and hunting-knife
into the clout pockets, and then took my rifle from the corner
and unwrapped the deer-hide case.</p>

<p>Thrice I tested the flint, pouring a little powder into the pan,
and thrice the pan flashed, and the ball of vapour shot up to
the ceiling. So all was ready. I lingered only to buckle my money-belt
under my shirt, pouch a dozen new flints and a case of wadding,
then hoisted my pack to my shoulders, strapped it on the hips,
blew out the candle, and stole into the hallway, trailing my rifle.</p>

<p>Passing the door of Silver Heels's chamber, my heart suddenly
grew tender and I hesitated. But the memory of her many misdeeds
hardened it immediately, and I went on, tasting contentedly of
a perverse resentment which smacked pleasantly of martyrdom. All
asses, they say, are born to martyrdom.</p>

<p>I crept past the nursery without accident, but barked my shins
on the stocks in the hallway. Yet Mistress Molly did not awake&mdash;or
was it that she knew what errand I was bound on? Perhaps. Still,
to this day I do not know whether or not Sir William had confided
in her. God rest her! I never saw her again.</p>

<p>I went softly through the lower hall, through the card-room,
and tapped at the library door. It was opened without a sound.</p>

<p>We gazed silently at each other for a long time. I, for one,
could not trust myself to speak. All the joy and exhilaration
of adventure had suddenly left me; I felt the straps of my pack
straining my shoulders, but the burden on my back was not as heavy
as my heart's full load.</p>

<p>He seemed so old, so tired, so gray; his eyes had acquired that
peering look which one notices in faces scored by care. What a
blight had come upon him in these few weeks! Where was that ruddy
glow, that full swell of muscle as he moved, that clear-eyed,
full-fronted presence that I knew so well! How old his hands appeared
under the cuff's limp lace; how old his loose face, all in ashy
seams; how old his slow eyes&mdash;how old, old, old!</p>

<p>He rose as though his back, instead of mine, bore the burden,
and together, without a word, we passed through the dark house
and out to the porch. Dawn silvered the east, but the moon in
its first quarter lay afloat in the western clouds, and a few
stars looked down through a sky caked with frosted fleece.</p>

<p>He embraced me in silence, holding me a long time to his breast,
yet never a word was said, and never a sound fell on the night
air save my desperate gulps to crush back the sob that strained
in my throat.</p>

<p>Presently I was conscious that I had left him, and was running
fast through the darkness, blind as a bat for the tears, breathless,
too, for, as I halted and turned to look back, far away against
the dawn I saw our house as a black mass, with a single candle
twinkling in the basement. So I knew Sir William still kept his
vigil in the library.</p>

<p>The streets of Johnstown were dark, save for the rare lanthorns
of the watchmen, but there seemed to be many people abroad, most
of them noisy and quarrelsome. To tell the truth, I had never
before seen so much swaggering and drunkenness in Johnstown, and
I marvelled at it as I hastened on. Once, as I passed a tavern,
two men, journeying in opposite directions, hailed each other
with a new phrase: "Greeting, friend! God save our country!" At
which a drunken soldier from the tavern bawled out: "God save
our country&mdash;eh? That's the Boston rebels' password! God save
the King and damn the country!&mdash;you yellow-bellied Whigs!"</p>

<p>A small crowd gathered, but I hastened on; yet behind me I heard
oaths and blows and cries of: "Lobster! Tory! Kill the red-coat!"
And everywhere along the street windows were raised and men looked
out, some shouting: "Rebel!" "Traitor!" or "Bloody-back!" "Tea-sot&mdash;toss-pot!"
and some called for the watch.</p>

<p>Many people began to rush hither and thither. A little peddler
got under my feet and fell sprawling and squealing till I picked
him up and set him on his legs. He was a small Hebrew man, Saul
Shemuel, who came a-peddling often to our servants; but in his
terror he did not know me, and he fled madly into Rideup's Tavern
with a soldier after him, vowing he'd have one rebel scalp even
though it were a Jewish one.</p>

<p>I had no time to linger, yet behind me I heard a sharp fight
begin at Rideup's Tavern, which is another pot-house much frequented
by Boston men. Presently as I climbed the hill I heard the drums
at the guard-house beating the alarm, and I knew the fray would
soon end with the patrol's arrival from their barracks.</p>

<p>But what had come over our staid towns-people and farmers and
tenants that they should damn each other for rebels and Tories?
It amazed me to see old neighbours shaking their fists out of
windows and cursing one another with such extraordinary and unnecessary
fury.</p>

<p>Truly, if in our village this question of tuppence worth o' tea
drove men mad, what wonder Sir William and Governor Tryon should
frown and shake their heads over a pinch o' snuff?</p>

<p>But I was to leave all this trouble behind me now. Already the
misty wilderness loomed up in the south, vague as a ghostly vision
in the moon's beams. Ah, my woods!&mdash;my dear, dear woods! One plunge
into that dim, sweet shadow and what cared I for King or rebel
or any woman who ever lived?</p>
