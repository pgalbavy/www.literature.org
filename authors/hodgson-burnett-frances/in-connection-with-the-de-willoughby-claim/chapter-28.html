<p>To Tom himself it seemed that it was the old, easy-going mountain life
which had receded. The days when he had sat upon the stone porch and
watched the sun rise from behind one mountain and set behind another
seemed to belong to a life lived centuries ago. But that he knew little
of occult beliefs and mysteries, he would have said to himself that all
these things must have happened in a long past incarnation.
</p>
<p>The matter of the De Willoughby claim was brought before the House. Judge
Rutherford opened the subject one day with a good deal of nervous
excitement. He had supplied himself with many notes, and found some
little difficulty in managing them, being new to the work, and he grew
hot and uncertain because he could not secure an audience. Claims had
already become old and tiresome stories, and members who were unoccupied
pursued their conversation unmovedly, giving the speaker only an
occasional detached glance. The two representatives of their country
sitting nearest to him were, not at all furtively, eating apples and
casting their cores and parings into their particular waste-paper
baskets. This was discouraging and baffling. To quote the Judge himself,
no one knew anything about Hamlin County, and certainly no one was
disturbed by any desire to be told about it.
</p><p>That night Rutherford went to the house near Dupont Circle. Big Tom was
sitting in the porch with Rupert and Sheba. Uncle Matt was digging about
the roots of a rose-bush, and the Judge caught a glimpse of Miss Burford
looking out from behind the parlour curtains.
</p><p>The Judge wore a wearied and vaguely bewildered look as he sat down and
wiped his forehead with a large, clean white handkerchief.
</p><p>"It's all different from what I thought--it's all different," he said.
</p><p>"Things often are," remarked Tom, "oftener than not."
</p><p>Rupert and Sheba glanced at each other questioningly and listened with
anxious eyes.
</p><p>"And it's different in a different way from what I expected," the Judge
went on. "They might have said and done a dozen things I should have been
sort of ready for, but they didn't. Somehow it seemed as if--as if the
whole thing didn't matter."
</p><p>Tom got up and began to walk about.
</p><p>"That's not the way things begin that are going to rush through," he
said.
</p><p>Sheba followed him and slipped her hand through his arm.
</p><p>"Do you think," she faltered, "that perhaps we shall not get the money at
all, Uncle Tom?"
</p><p>Tom folded her hand in his--which was easily done.
</p><p>"I'm afraid that if we do get it," he answered, "it will not come to us
before we want it pretty badly--the Lord knows how badly."
</p><p>For every day counts in the expenditure of a limited sum, and on days of
discouragement Tom's calculation of their resources left him a troubled
man.
</p><p>When Judge Rutherford had gone Rupert sat with Sheba in the scented
summer darkness. He drew his chair opposite to hers and took one of her
hands in both of his own.
</p><p>"Suppose I have done a wrong thing," he said. "Suppose I have dragged you
and Uncle Tom into trouble?"
</p><p>"I am glad you came," in a quick, soft voice. "I am glad you came." And
the slight, warm fingers closed round his.
</p><p>He lifted them to his lips and kissed them over and over again. "Are you
glad I came?" he murmured. "Oh, Sheba! Sheba!"
</p><p>"Why do you say 'Oh, Sheba'?" she asked.
</p><p>"Because I love you so--and I am so young--and I don't know what to do.
You know I love you, don't you?"
</p><p>She leaned forward so that he saw her lovely gazelle eyes lifted and most
innocently tender. "I want you to love me," she said; "I could not bear
you not to love me."
</p><p>He hesitated a second, and then suddenly pressed his glowing face upon
her palm.
</p><p>"But I don't love you as Uncle Tom loves you, Sheba," he said. "I love
you--young as I am--I love you--differently."
</p><p>Her swaying nearer to him was a sweetly unconscious and involuntary
thing. Their young eyes drowned themselves in each other.
</p><p>"I want you," she said, the note of a young ring-dove answering her mate
murmuring in her voice, "I want you to love me--as you love me. I love
your way of loving me."
</p><p>"Darling!" broke from him, his boy's heart beating fast and high. And
their soft young lips were, through some mystery of power, drawn so near
to each other that they met like flowers moved to touching by the summer
wind.
</p><p>Later Rupert went to Tom, who sat by an open window in his room and
looked out on the moonlit stretch of avenue. The boy's heart was still
beating fast, and, as the white light struck his face, it showed his eyes
more like Delia Vanuxem's than they had ever been. Their darkness held
just the look Tom remembered, but could never have described or explained
to himself.
</p><p>"Uncle Tom," he began, in an unsteady voice, "I couldn't go to bed
without telling you."
</p><p>Tom glanced up at him and learned a great deal. He put a big hand on his
shoulder.
</p><p>"Sit down, boy," he said, his kind eyes warming. Rupert sat down.
</p><p>"Perhaps I ought not to have done it," he broke forth. "I did not know I
was going to do it. I suppose I am too young. I did not mean to--but I
could not help it."
</p><p>"Sheba?" Tom inquired, simply.
</p><p>"Her eyes were so lovely," poured forth the boy. "She looked at me so
like an angel. Whenever she is near me, it seems as if something were
drawing us together."
</p><p>"Yes," was Tom's quiet answer.
</p><p>"I want to tell you all about it," impetuously. "I have been so lonely,
Uncle Tom, since my mother died. You don't know how I loved her--how
close we were to each other. She was so sweet and wonderful--and I had
nothing else."
</p><p>Tom nodded gently.
</p><p>"I remember," he said. "I never forgot."
</p><p>He put the big hand on the boy's knee this time. "I loved her too," he
said, "and _I_ had nothing else."
</p><p>"Then you know--you know!" cried Rupert. "You remember what it was to sit
quite near her and see her look at you in that innocent way--how you
longed to cry out and take her in your arms."
</p><p>Tom stirred in his seat. Time rolled back twenty-five years.
</p><p>"Oh, my God, yes--I remember!" he answered.
</p><p>"It was like that to-night," the young lover went on. "And I could not
stop myself. I told her I loved her--and she said she wanted me to love
her--and we kissed each other."
</p><p>Big Tom got up and stood before the open window. His hands were thrust
deep into his pockets and he stared out at the beauty of the night.
</p><p>"Good Lord!" he said. "That's what <u>ought</u> to come to every man that
lives--but it doesn't."
</p><p>Rupert poured forth his confession, restrained no more.
</p><p>"From that first night when I rode through the mountains over the white
road and stopped at your gate--since I looked up and saw her standing on
the balcony with the narcissus in her hair it has always been the same
thing. It began that very moment--it was there when she leaned forward
and spoke to me. I had never thought of a woman before--I was too poor
and sad and lonely and young. And there she was--all white--and it seemed
as if she was <u>mine</u>."
</p><p>Tom nodded his head as if to a white rose-bush in the small garden.
</p><p>"I am as poor as ever I was," said Rupert. "I am a beggar if we lose our
claim; but I am not sad, and I am not lonely--I can't be--I can't be! I
am happy--everything's happy--because she knows--and I have kissed her."
</p><p>"What did you think I would say when you told me?" Tom asked.
</p><p>"I don't know," impetuously; "but I knew I must come to you. It seems a
million years ago since that hot morning in the old garden at
Delisleville--when I had never seen her."
</p><p>"One of the things I have thought about a good deal," said Tom, with
quite a practical manner, "has been love. I had lots of time to think
over things at the Cross-roads, and I used to work them out as far as my
mind would carry me. Love's as much an element as the rest of them.
There's earth, air, fire, water--and love. It has to be calculated for.
What I've reasoned out is that it has not been calculated for enough.
It's going to <u>come</u> to all of us--and it will either come and stay, and
make the old earth bloom with flowers--or it will come and go, and leave
it like a plain swept by fire. It's not a trivial thing that only boys
and girls play with; it's better--and worse. It ought to be prepared for
and treated well. It's not often treated well. People have got into the
way of expecting trouble and tragedy to come out of it. We are always
hearing of its unhappiness in books. Poets write about it that way."
</p><p>"I suppose it is often unhappy," said Rupert; "but just now it seems as
if it <u>could</u> not be."
</p><p>"What <u>I've</u> been wanting to see," said Tom, "is young love come up like
a flower and be given its dew and sun and rain--and bloom and bloom its
best."
</p><p>He drew a big sigh.
</p><p>"That poor child who lies on the hillside under the pines," he went on,
"Sheba's mother--hers was young love--and it brought tragedy and death.
Delia," his voice was unsteady, "your mother's was young love, and her
heart was broken. No, it's not often well treated. And when you and Sheba
came to me that night with your boy and girl eyes shining with gladness
just because you had met each other, I said to myself, 'By the Lord, here
is what it springs from. Perhaps it may come to them; I wonder if it
will?'"
</p><p>"You thought it might, even then," Rupert cried.
</p><p>"Yes, I did," was Tom's answer. "You were young--you were drawn
together--it seemed natural. I used to watch you, and think it over,
making a kind of picture to myself of how it would be if two young things
could meet each other and join hands and wander on among roses until they
reached the gate of life--and it swung open for them and they passed
through and found another paradise."
</p><p>He stopped a second and turned to look at Rupert's dreamy face with a
smile not all humorous. "I'm a sentimental chap for my size," he added.
"That's what I wanted for Sheba and you--that's what I want. That sort of
thing was left out of my life; but I should like to see it before I'm
done with. Good God! why can't people be <u>happy</u>? I want people to be
<u>happy</u>."
</p><p>The boy was trembling.
</p><p>"Uncle Tom," he said, "Sheba and I are happy to-night."
</p><p>"Then God have mercy on the soul of the man who would spoil it for you,"
said Big Tom, with actual solemnity. "I'm not that man. You two just go
on being happy; try and make up for what your two mothers had to bear."
</p><p>Rupert got up from his chair and caught the big hand in his. It was a
boy's action, and he looked particularly like a boy as he did it. "It is
just like you," he broke forth. "I did not know what you would say when I
told you--but I ought to have known you would say something like this.
It's--it's as big as you are, Uncle Tom," ingenuously.
</p><p>That was his good-night. When he went away Big Tom settled into his chair
again and looked out for some time longer at the bright night. He was
going back to two other nights which lay in the years behind. One was the
night he turned his back on Delisleville and rode towards the mountain
with a weight on his kindly heart which he had grimly told himself seemed
to weigh a ton; the other was the night he had been wakened from his
sleep by the knock on the door of the bedroom behind the Cross-roads
Post-office and had ridden out under the whiteness of the moon to find in
the bare cabin at Blair's Hollow the little fair girl who had sobbed and
died as she clung to his warm hand.
