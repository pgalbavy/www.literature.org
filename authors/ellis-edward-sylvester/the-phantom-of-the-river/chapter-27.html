<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The night was well along when Missionary Finley determined to
appeal to his last recourse for saving the life of little Mabel
Ashbridge.</p>

<p>In unnumbered ways the Shawanoes showed that stoicism and indifference
which they take pains to display when in the presence of strangers,
though not always among themselves. A number lolled on the ground,
some were standing, and two had sat down on the fallen tree. Another
took upon himself the duty of keeping the fire vigorously burning.
From time to time he walked off among the trees, and came back
with sticks and brush in his arms, which were flung on the flames.
Although the air was colder than on the preceding night, the additional
warmth was not needed; it was simply the light that was required.</p>

<p>The action of all these Shawanoes was as if their chieftain and
his white visitor were one hundred miles distant. None approached,
addressed or seemed to hear a word that passed, though in the
stillness many of their words, especially those uttered by the
chieftain, were audible to the farthest point of the camp.</p>

<p>The observant eye of Finley told him a significant fact. Allowing
for those that had fallen in the attack upon the flatboat, fully
half a dozen of the warriors were absent. They were watching the
movements of the whites who had crossed the river, and would soon
report to The Panther.</p>

<p>The absence of these warriors, we say, was suggestive, but caused
the missionary no concern. With the pioneers were Daniel Boone
and his rangers, while Simon Kenton was somewhere between the
hostile forces. After the late escape of the party from The Panther
and his men, no great fear was to be entertained of them.</p>

<p>Mabel Ashbridge, wondering, distressed and sorrowful, sat on
the fallen tree, now and then looking around the camp and following
the movements of the painted men as they passed to and fro, some
of them occasionally glancing toward her with a scowl and gleam
of the black eyes, which terrified her, but most of the time her
gaze rested upon the chieftain and white man talking near her.</p>

<p>How odd their words sounded! She could hear everything said,
and yet it was in another language, and seemed as if they were
mumbling over gibberish, like a couple of children for their own
amusement, except that the chief most of the time acted as though
he was angry at the white man, who looked so pleasant and kind
that she was sure he must have a little girl at home.</p>

<p>But strange, novel and exciting as all this seemed, it soon became
monotonous to her. Unable to learn of its meaning, she became
drowsy, and, leaning over and laying her head on the log beside
her, she closed her eyes in slumber.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood when the missionary said:</p>

<p>"The white and red children of the Great Spirit, I fear, will
always fight each other. The missionary has tried to make them
live in peace, but he can do nothing. The Shawanoes have made
captive a little girl over whose head only the moons of a pappoose
have passed. A few hours ago the pale-faces made captive the great
chieftain Wa-on-mon, but the white hunter let him go free."</p>

<p>The Panther was about to interrupt angrily, when the missionary
continued, with the same calm evenness of voice:</p>

<p>"The white hunter did not set Wa-on-mon free because he loved
him, but rather because he hated him. He wished to meet him in
combat; but when he went to the place where Wa-on-mon promised
to meet him, the chieftain was not there. The great Wa-on-mon
was not afraid of the white man; therefore, he must have made
a mistake and gone elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon made haste to meet his warriors, that he might lead
them against the pale-faces and slay them all."</p>

<p>"He lost more braves than did the pale-faces, but the white hunter
must not think the mighty Wa-on-mon is afraid of him."</p>

<p>The remark was as near an untruth as the conscience of the good
man would permit him to go. No one, not even Simon Kenton, suspected
The Panther was afraid to meet any white man that lived in a personal
encounter. But the statement hit the chieftain in the most sensitive
spot.</p>

<p>"Does the white hunter think Wa-on-mon is afraid to meet him
in the depths of the wood, where no eye but that of the Great
Spirit shall see them?"</p>

<p>"How can he help thinking so when Wa-on-mon agrees to meet him,
and the white hunter goes to the spot, and waits for Wa-on-mon,
who does not come?"</p>

<p>"But Wa-on-mon has told the missionary the reason," said The
Panther, with a threatening movement and flash of his eyes.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon has not told the white hunter," returned the unruffled
Finley.</p>

<p>"The missionary can tell him."</p>

<p>"And he will do so, but what shall he tell the white hunter when
he asks whether Wa-on-mon will meet him again and prove he is
not afraid?"</p>

<p>"Tell the white hunter that Wa-on-mon will meet him!" exclaimed
The Panther, with a concentrated fury of voice and manner surpassing
that which he had yet shown. He placed his hand threateningly
upon his knife, as though in his wrath he would bury it in the
body of the good man as a means of relief for the cyclone of hate
that was aroused by his words.</p>

<p>It was the precise point for which Missionary Finley had been
playing. The preliminary conversation had been aimed to bring
The Panther to see that the only way he could save himself from
the charge of cowardice was by meeting Kenton in mortal combat.
Such an issue, in which one of the contestants must fall, was
extremely distasteful to the man of peace. There could be only
one combination of circumstances that would justify, in his judgment,
that supreme test; that combination now existed.</p>

<p>With the skill of a trained diplomat, with his perfect knowledge
of the Indian character, Finley kept matters moving.</p>

<p>"It will delight the heart of the white hunter to meet Wa-on-mon,
as they were to meet only yesterday, and I know it will make glad
the heart of Wa-on-mon to meet the white hunter in the woods,
where no one can see them. Shall I tell the white hunter that
these are the words of Wa-on-mon?"</p>

<p>"They are Wa-on-mon's words; he will meet the white hunter."</p>

<p>This was all well enough, and the negotiation was progressing
satisfactorily; but the most delicate work yet remained to be
done.</p>

<p>The arrangements for the encounter were yet to be completed,
and, above all, the stake must be fixed, or, no matter what the
issue, everything would come to naught.</p>

<p>"The white hunter and my brother, the great and mighty Wa-on-mon,
cannot meet in the darkness of the wood, for when they meet they
must see each others' faces."</p>

<p>It was the first time the missionary had ventured to speak of
the chieftain as his brother since he was angrily forbidden to
do so. He made no objection in the present instance, though possibly
it was due to his mental excitement that he did not notice it.</p>

<p>"They shall meet when the sun rises over the tree-tops; Wa-on-mon
will be there and await the white hunter, if he does not run away."</p>

<p>"The white hunter will not run away," quietly remarked the missionary,
refraining from making the stinging retort that rose to his lips;
"but my brother, the mighty Wa-on-mon, is wise, let him say how
he and the white hunter shall meet, and the missionary will see
that it is done."</p>

<p>Before the chieftain could formulate a scheme, the shrewd Finley
was ready with that which he had formed while crossing the river
in the canoe.</p>

<p>"Let Wa-on-mon go to the rock that lies yonder," he said, pointing
up the stream, "it is but a small way beyond this camp; the rock
is only the size of a canoe, and it is hardly above the surface
of the water; does my brother know it?"</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon knows where his brother, the missionary, means," replied
the chieftain, thrilling the good man by the term used.</p>

<p>"Will he be there when the sun appears above the tree-tops?"</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon will be there, armed only with his knife."</p>

<p>"It shall be the same with the white hunter."</p>

<p>But the sagacious Panther saw the difficulties that still confronted
them. His "brother" had clinched the confidence the chieftain
held in him by his selection of the battle-ground for the Kentucky
side of the Ohio, not far from the Shawanoe camp. This reduced,
as far as possible, the chances of treachery by the white men,
and conceded a most important point to those with whom treachery
has always been a cardinal virtue.</p>

<p>"The missionary will see that the white hunter is by the rocks
when it begins to grow light in the east."</p>

<p>"Then what will the missionary do?"</p>

<p>"He will come back to the camp of Wa-on-mon and await his return."</p>

<p>Had he expressed his wishes he would have added the words, "hoping
he will never come back again," but he was too wise to say anything
of that nature.</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon will not keep him waiting long," was the confident
declaration of the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"And when he returns?"</p>

<p>"Then my brother, the missionary, shall go free."</p>

<p>"And the little one asleep there?"</p>

<p>"She dies."</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon will not return until the white hunter has fallen
before his knife."</p>

<p>"No; but that will not be long."</p>

<p>"Suppose Wa-on-mon does not come back?" remarked Finley, in a
matter-of-fact, off-hand manner, but it was the crucial point
of the whole matter.</p>

<p>"He will come back," was the response of the chieftain.</p>

<p>"Does he think the white hunter will spare him? No," added the
missionary, answering his own question. "But suppose my brother,
the mighty Wa-on-mon, does not come back?"</p>

<p>"Then my brother, the missionary, shall go back to his people."</p>

<p>"But that is the promise my brother gave before; will he not
say that if Wa-on-mon does not come back, the missionary shall
return to his people and take the little captive with him?"</p>

<p>"Wa-on-mon gives his brother that pledge; he has spoken."</p>

<p>It was settled! The scheme that had been in the mind of the good
man from the moment he paddled away from the flatboat was fully
assented to by The Panther. If the latter overcame Simon Kenton
in the hand-to-hand encounter, he would return to camp and put
innocent Mabel Ashbridge to death.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the ranger overcame The Panther, or the
latter was seen no more among his warriors, then the missionary
was at liberty to take the tiny hand within his own, and make
his way back to her friends without let or hindrance from the
Shawanoes.</p>

<p>In other words, the life of the child was the stake at issue.</p>

<p>"Let my brother make known his wishes to his braves," said the
missionary, losing no time in following up the advantage he had
gained.</p>

<p>As if aware for the first time of the presence of his people
around him, The Panther now beckoned to several to approach. They
did so with a prompt readiness which suggested a camp of highly-disciplined
soldiers. The chief explained what had been agreed upon, and made
his orders so explicit that there could be no misconception on
the part of any one. Finley watched closely while he listened,
and saw that in this matter at least all was above board. The
chieftain's self-confidence was so ingrained and deeply set that
he could not doubt his own triumph.</p>

<p>But he astounded Rev. Mr. Finley by an unprecedented proof of
faith in his honor.</p>

<p>The combat was to take place as near sunrise as could be arranged.
As it was impossible to say beforehand precisely when The Panther
would be due in camp, it was his order that the decision of the
question should be left wholly with the missionary.</p>

<p>When he should declare to the leading Shawanoes that the time
that had elapsed was so great that it was certain Wa-on-mon had
been overthrown and would not come back to his warriors, then
the missionary was free to take the little captive by the hand
and walk away, and no one should say them nay.</p>

<p>It was an unprecedented compliment in respect to the integrity
and honor of the good man; but, oh, what a temptation, when it
promised to settle the question of life and death for the precious
child!</p>
