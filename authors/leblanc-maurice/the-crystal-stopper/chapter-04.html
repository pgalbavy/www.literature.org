<p>“Poor boy!” murmured Lupin, when his eyes fell on Gilbert’s letter next
morning. “How he must feel it!”
</p>
<p>On the very first day when he saw him, he had taken a liking to that
well-set-up youngster, so careless, gay and fond of life. Gilbert was
devoted to him, would have accepted death at a sign from his master.
And Lupin also loved his frankness, his good humour, his simplicity, his
bright, open face.
</p><p>“Gilbert,” he often used to say, “you are an honest man. Do you know,
if I were you, I should chuck the business and become an honest man for
good.”
</p><p>“After you, governor,” Gilbert would reply, with a laugh.
</p><p>“Won’t you, though?”
</p><p>“No, governor. An honest man is a chap who works and grinds. It’s a
taste which I may have had as a nipper; but they’ve made me lose it
since.”
</p><p>“Who’s they?”
</p><p>Gilbert was silent. He was always silent when questioned about his
early life; and all that Lupin knew was that he had been an orphan since
childhood and that he had lived all over the place, changing his name
and taking up the queerest jobs. The whole thing was a mystery which no
one had been able to fathom; and it did not look as though the police
would make much of it either.
</p><p>Nor, on the other hand, did it look as though the police would consider
that mystery a reason for delaying proceedings. They would send
Vaucheray’s accomplice for trial--under his name of Gilbert or any other
name--and visit him with the same inevitable punishment.
</p><p>“Poor boy!” repeated Lupin. “They’re persecuting him like this only
because of me. They are afraid of his escaping and they are in a hurry
to finish the business: the verdict first and then... the execution.
</p><p>“Oh, the butchers!... A lad of twenty, who has committed no murder, who
is not even an accomplice in the murder...”
</p><p>Alas, Lupin well knew that this was a thing impossible to prove and that
he must concentrate his efforts upon another point. But upon which? Was
he to abandon the trail of the crystal stopper?
</p><p>He could not make up his mind to that. His one and only diversion from
the search was to go to Enghien, where the Growler and the Masher lived,
and make sure that nothing had been seen of them since the murder at the
Villa Marie-Therese. Apart from this, he applied himself to the question
of Daubrecq and nothing else.
</p><p>He refused even to trouble his head about the problems set before him:
the treachery of the Growler and the Masher; their connection with the
gray-haired lady; the spying of which he himself was the object.
</p><p>“Steady, Lupin,” he said. “One only argues falsely in a fever. So hold
your tongue. No inferences, above all things! Nothing is more
foolish than to infer one fact from another before finding a certain
starting-point. That’s where you get up a tree. Listen to your instinct.
Act according to your instinct. And as you are persuaded, outside all
argument, outside all logic, one might say, that this business turns
upon that confounded stopper, go for it boldly. Have at Daubrecq and his
bit of crystal!”
</p><p>Lupin did not wait to arrive at these conclusions before settling his
actions accordingly. At the moment when he was stating them in his mind,
three days after the scene at the Vaudeville, he was sitting, dressed
like a retired tradesman, in an old overcoat, with a muffler round his
neck, on a bench in the Avenue Victor-Hugo, at some distance from the
Square Lamartine. Victoire had his instructions to pass by that bench at
the same hour every morning.
</p><p>“Yes,” he repeated to himself, “the crystal stopper: everything turns on
that... Once I get hold of it...”
</p><p>Victoire arrived, with her shopping-basket on her arm. He at once
noticed her extraordinary agitation and pallor:
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” asked Lupin, walking beside his old nurse.
</p><p>She went into a big grocer’s, which was crowded with people, and,
turning to him:
</p><p>“Here,” she said, in a voice torn with excitement. “Here’s what you’ve
been hunting for.”
</p><p>And, taking something from her basket, she gave it to him.
</p><p>Lupin stood astounded: in his hand lay the crystal stopper.
</p><p>“Can it be true? Can it be true?” he muttered, as though the ease of the
solution had thrown him off his balance.
</p><p>But the fact remained, visible and palpable. He recognized by its shape,
by its size, by the worn gilding of its facets, recognized beyond any
possible doubt the crystal stopper which he had seen before. He even
remarked a tiny, hardly noticeable little scratch on the stem which he
remembered perfectly.
</p><p>However, while the thing presented all the same characteristics, it
possessed no other that seemed out of the way. It was a crystal stopper,
that was all. There was no really special mark to distinguish it from
other stoppers. There was no sign upon it, no stamp; and, being cut from
a single piece, it contained no foreign object.
</p><p>“What then?”
</p><p>And Lupin received a quick insight into the depth of his mistake. What
good could the possession of that crystal stopper do him so long as he
was ignorant of its value? That bit of glass had no existence in itself;
it counted only through the meaning that attached to it. Before taking
it, the thing was to be certain. And how could he tell that, in taking
it, in robbing Daubrecq of it, he was not committing an act of folly?
</p><p>It was a question which was impossible of solution, but which forced
itself upon him with singular directness.
</p><p>“No blunders!” he said to himself, as he pocketed the stopper. “In this
confounded business, blunders are fatal.”
</p><p>He had not taken his eyes off Victoire. Accompanied by a shopman, she
went from counter to counter, among the throng of customers. She next
stood for some little while at the pay-desk and passed in front of
Lupin.
</p><p>He whispered her instructions:
</p><p>“Meet me behind the Lycee Janson.”
</p><p>She joined him in an unfrequented street:
</p><p>“And suppose I’m followed?” she said.
</p><p>“No,” he declared. “I looked carefully. Listen to me. Where did you find
the stopper?”
</p><p>“In the drawer of the table by his bed.”
</p><p>“But we had felt there already.”
</p><p>“Yes; and I did so again this morning. I expect he put it there last
night.”
</p><p>“And I expect he’ll want to take it from there again,” said Lupin.
</p><p>“Very likely.”
</p><p>“And suppose he finds it gone?”
</p><p>Victoire looked frightened.
</p><p>“Answer me,” said Lupin. “If he finds it gone, he’ll accuse you of
taking it, won’t he?”
</p><p>“Certainly.”
</p><p>“Then go and put it back, as fast as you can.”
</p><p>“Oh dear, oh dear!” she moaned. “I hope he won’t have had time to find
out. Give it to me, quick.”
</p><p>“Here you are,” said Lupin.
</p><p>He felt in the pocket of his overcoat.
</p><p>“Well?” said Victoire, holding out her hand.
</p><p>“Well,” he said, after a moment, “it’s gone.”
</p><p>“What!”
</p><p>“Yes, upon my word, it’s gone... somebody’s taken it from me.”
</p><p>He burst into a peal of laughter, a laughter which, this time, was free
from all bitterness.
</p><p>Victoire flew out at him:
</p><p>“Laugh away!... Putting me in such a predicament!...”
</p><p>“How can I help laughing? You must confess that it’s funny. It’s
no longer a tragedy that we’re acting, but a fairy-tale, as much a
fairy-tale as Puss in Boots or Jack and the Beanstalk. I must write it
when I get a few weeks to myself: The Magic Stopper; or, The Mishaps of
Poor Arsene.”
</p><p>“Well... who has taken it from you?”
</p><p>“What are you talking about?... It has flown away... vanished from my
pocket: hey presto, begone!”
</p><p>He gave the old servant a gentle push and, in a more serious tone:
</p><p>“Go home, Victoire, and don’t upset yourself. Of course, some one saw
you give me the stopper and took advantage of the crowd in the shop to
pick my pocket of it. That only shows that we are watched more closely
than I thought and by adversaries of the first rank. But, once more, be
easy. Honest men always come by their own... Have you anything else to
tell me?”
</p><p>“Yes. Some one came yesterday evening, while M. Daubrecq was out. I saw
lights reflected upon the trees in the garden.”
</p><p>“The portress’ bedroom?”
</p><p>“The portress was up.”
</p><p>“Then it was some of those detective-fellows; they are still hunting.
I’ll see you later, Victoire. You must let me in again.”
</p><p>“What! You want to...”
</p><p>“What do I risk? Your room is on the third floor. Daubrecq suspects
nothing.”
</p><p>“But the others!”
</p><p>“The others? If it was to their interest to play me a trick, they’d have
tried before now. I’m in their way, that’s all. They’re not afraid of
me. So till later, Victoire, at five o’clock exactly.”
</p><p>One further surprise awaited Lupin. In the evening his old nurse told
him that, having opened the drawer of the bedside table from curiosity,
she had found the crystal stopper there again.
</p><p>Lupin was no longer to be excited by these miraculous incidents. He
simply said to himself:
</p><p>“So it’s been brought back. And the person who brought it back and who
enters this house by some unexplained means considered, as I did, that
the stopper ought not to disappear. And yet Daubrecq, who knows that he
is being spied upon to his very bedroom, has once more left the stopper
in a drawer, as though he attached no importance to it at all! Now what
is one to make of that?”
</p><p>Though Lupin did not make anything of it, nevertheless he could not
escape certain arguments, certain associations of ideas that gave him
the same vague foretaste of light which one receives on approaching the
outlet of a tunnel.
</p><p>“It is inevitable, as the case stands,” he thought, “that there must
soon be an encounter between myself and the others. From that moment I
shall be master of the situation.”
</p><p>Five days passed, during which Lupin did not glean the slightest
particular. On the sixth day Daubrecq received a visit, in the small
hours, from a gentleman, Laybach the deputy, who, like his colleagues,
dragged himself at his feet in despair and, when all was done, handed
him twenty thousand francs.
</p><p>Two more days; and then, one night, posted on the landing of the
second floor, Lupin heard the creaking of a door, the front-door, as he
perceived, which led from the hall into the garden. In the darkness
he distinguished, or rather divined, the presence of two persons, who
climbed the stairs and stopped on the first floor, outside Daubrecq’s
bedroom.
</p><p>What were they doing there? It was not possible to enter the room,
because Daubrecq bolted his door every night. Then what were they
hoping?
</p><p>Manifestly, a handiwork of some kind was being performed, as Lupin
discovered from the dull sounds of rubbing against the door. Then words,
uttered almost beneath a whisper, reached him:
</p><p>“Is it all right?”
</p><p>“Yes, quite, but, all the same, we’d better put it off till to-morrow,
because...”
</p><p>Lupin did not hear the end of the sentence. The men were already groping
their way downstairs. The hall-door was closed, very gently, and then
the gate.
</p><p>“It’s curious, say what one likes,” thought Lupin. “Here is a house in
which Daubrecq carefully conceals his rascalities and is on his guard,
not without good reason, against spies; and everybody walks in and out
as in a booth at a fair. Victoire lets me in, the portress admits the
emissaries of the police: that’s well and good; but who is playing false
in these people’s favour? Are we to suppose that they are acting alone?
But what fearlessness! And how well they know their way about!”
</p><p>In the afternoon, during Daubrecq’s absence, he examined the door of the
first-floor bedroom. And, at the first glance, he understood: one of the
lower panels had been skilfully cut out and was only held in place by
invisible tacks. The people, therefore, who had done this work were the
same who had acted at his two places, in the Rue Matignon and the Rue
Chateaubriand.
</p><p>He also found that the work dated back to an earlier period and that, as
in his case, the opening had been prepared beforehand, in anticipation
of favourable circumstances or of some immediate need.
</p><p>The day did not seem long to Lupin. Knowledge was at hand. Not only
would he discover the manner in which his adversaries employed those
little openings, which were apparently unemployable, since they did
not allow a person to reach the upper bolts, but he would learn who the
ingenious and energetic adversaries were with whom he repeatedly and
inevitably found himself confronted.
</p><p>One incident annoyed him. In the evening Daubrecq, who had complained of
feeling tired at dinner, came home at ten o’clock and, contrary to his
usual custom, pushed the bolts of the hall-door. In that case, how would
the others be able to carry out their plan and go to Daubrecq’s room?
Lupin waited for an hour after Daubrecq put out his light. Then he went
down to the deputy’s study, opened one of the windows ajar and returned
to the third floor and fixed his rope-ladder so that, in case of need,
he could reach the study without passing though the house. Lastly, he
resumed his post on the second-floor landing.
</p><p>He did not have to wait long. An hour earlier than on the previous night
some one tried to open the hall-door. When the attempt failed, a few
minutes of absolute silence followed. And Lupin was beginning to think
that the men had abandoned the idea, when he gave a sudden start. Some
one had passed, without the least sound to interrupt the silence. He
would not have known it, so utterly were the thing’s steps deadened by
the stair-carpet, if the baluster-rail, which he himself held in his
hand, had not shaken slightly. Some one was coming upstairs.
</p><p>And, as the ascent continued, Lupin became aware of the uncanny feeling
that he heard nothing more than before. He knew, because of the rail,
that a thing was coming and he could count the number of steps climbed
by noting each vibration of the rail; but no other indication gave him
that dim sensation of presence which we feel in distinguishing movements
which we do not see, in perceiving sounds which we do not hear. And yet
a blacker darkness ought to have taken shape within the darkness and
something ought, at least, to modify the quality of the silence. No, he
might well have believed that there was no one there.
</p><p>And Lupin, in spite of himself and against the evidence of his reason,
ended by believing it, for the rail no longer moved and he thought that
he might have been the sport of an illusion.
</p><p>And this lasted a long time. He hesitated, not knowing what to do, not
knowing what to suppose. But an odd circumstance impressed him. A clock
struck two. He recognized the chime of Daubrecq’s clock. And the chime
was that of a clock from which one is not separated by the obstacle of a
door.
</p><p>Lupin slipped down the stairs and went to the door. It was closed,
but there was a space on the left, at the bottom, a space left by the
removal of the little panel.
</p><p>He listened. Daubrecq, at that moment, turned in his bed; and his
breathing was resumed, evenly and a little stertorously. And Lupin
plainly heard the sound of rumpling garments. Beyond a doubt, the thing
was there, fumbling and feeling through the clothes which Daubrecq had
laid beside his bed.
</p><p>“Now,” thought Lupin, “we shall learn something. But how the deuce did
the beggar get in? Has he managed to draw the bolts and open the door?
But, if so, why did he make the mistake of shutting it again?”
</p><p>Not for a second--a curious anomaly in a man like Lupin, an anomaly
to be explained only by the uncanny feeling which the whole adventure
produced in him--not for a second did he suspect the very simple truth
which was about to be revealed to him. Continuing his way down, he
crouched on one of the bottom steps of the staircase, thus placing
himself between the door of the bedroom and the hall-door, on the
road which Daubrecq’s enemy must inevitably take in order to join his
accomplices.
</p><p>He questioned the darkness with an unspeakable anguish. He was on
the point of unmasking that enemy of Daubrecq’s, who was also his
own adversary. He would thwart his plans. And the booty captured from
Daubrecq he would capture in his turn, while Daubrecq slept and while
the accomplices lurking behind the hall-door or outside the garden-gate
vainly awaited their leader’s return.
</p><p>And that return took place. Lupin knew it by the renewed vibration of
the balusters. And, once more, with every sense strained and every
nerve on edge, he strove to discern the mysterious thing that was coming
toward him. He suddenly realized it when only a few yards away. He
himself, hidden in a still darker recess, could not be seen. And what
he saw--in the very vaguest manner--was approaching stair by stair, with
infinite precautions, holding on to each separate baluster.
</p><p>“Whom the devil have I to do with?” said Lupin to himself, while his
heart thumped inside his chest.
</p><p>The catastrophe was hastened. A careless movement on Lupin’s part was
observed by the stranger, who stopped short. Lupin was afraid lest the
other should turn back and take to flight. He sprang at the adversary
and was stupefied at encountering nothing but space and knocking against
the stair-rail without seizing the form which he saw. But he at once
rushed forward, crossed the best part of the hall and caught up his
antagonist just as he was reaching the door opening on the garden.
</p><p>There was a cry of fright, answered by other cries on the further side
of the door.
</p><p>“Oh, hang it, what’s this?” muttered Lupin, whose arms had closed, in
the dark, round a little, tiny, trembling, whimpering thing.
</p><p>Suddenly understanding, he stood for a moment motionless and dismayed,
at a loss what to do with his conquered prey. But the others were
shouting and stamping outside the door. Thereupon, dreading lest
Daubrecq should wake up, he slipped the little thing under his jacket,
against his chest, stopped the crying with his handkerchief rolled into
a ball and hurried up the three flights of stairs.
</p><p>“Here,” he said to Victoire, who woke with a start. “I’ve brought you
the indomitable chief of our enemies, the Hercules of the gang. Have you
a feeding-bottle about you?”
</p><p>He put down in the easy-chair a child of six or seven years of age, the
tiniest little fellow in a gray jersey and a knitted woollen cap, whose
pale and exquisitely pretty features were streaked with the tears that
streamed from the terrified eyes.
</p><p>“Where did you pick that up?” asked Victoire, aghast.
</p><p>“At the foot of the stairs, as it was coming out of Daubrecq’s bedroom,”
 replied Lupin, feeling the jersey in the hope that the child had brought
a booty of some kind from that room.
</p><p>Victoire was stirred to pity:
</p><p>“Poor little dear! Look, he’s trying not to cry!... Oh, saints above,
his hands are like ice! Don’t be afraid, sonnie, we sha’n’t hurt you:
the gentleman’s all right.”
</p><p>“Yes,” said Lupin, “the gentleman’s quite all right, but there’s another
very wicked gentleman who’ll wake up if they go on making such a rumpus
outside the hall-door. Do you hear them, Victoire?”
</p><p>“Who is it?”
</p><p>“The satellites of our young Hercules, the indomitable leader’s gang.”
</p><p>“Well...?” stammered Victoire, utterly unnerved.
</p><p>“Well, as I don’t want to be caught in the trap, I shall start by
clearing out. Are you coming, Hercules?”
</p><p>He rolled the child in a blanket, so that only its head remained
outside, gagged its mouth as gently as possible and made Victoire fasten
it to his shoulders:
</p><p>“See, Hercules? We’re having a game. You never thought you’d find
gentlemen to play pick-a-back with you at three o’clock in the morning!
Come, whoosh, let’s fly away! You don’t get giddy, I hope?”
</p><p>He stepped across the window-ledge and set foot on one of the rungs of
the ladder. He was in the garden in a minute.
</p><p>He had never ceased hearing and now heard more plainly still the blows
that were being struck upon the front-door. He was astounded that
Daubrecq was not awakened by so violent a din:
</p><p>“If I don’t put a stop to this, they’ll spoil everything,” he said to
himself.
</p><p>He stood in an angle of the house, invisible in the darkness, and
measured the distance between himself and the gate. The gate was open.
To his right, he saw the steps, on the top of which the people were
flinging themselves about; to his left, the building occupied by the
portress.
</p><p>The woman had come out of her lodge and was standing near the people,
entreating them:
</p><p>“Oh, do be quiet, do be quiet! He’ll come!”
</p><p>“Capital!” said Lupin. “The good woman is an accomplice of these as
well. By Jingo, what a pluralist!”
</p><p>He rushed across to her and, taking her by the scruff of the neck,
hissed:
</p><p>“Go and tell them I’ve got the child... They can come and fetch it at my
place, Rue Chateaubriand.”
</p><p>A little way off, in the avenue, stood a taxi which Lupin presumed to be
engaged by the gang. Speaking authoritatively, as though he were one of
the accomplices, he stepped into the cab and told the man to drive him
home.
</p><p>“Well,” he said to the child, “that wasn’t much of a shake-up, was
it?... What do you say to going to bye-bye on the gentleman’s bed?”
</p><p>As his servant, Achille, was asleep, Lupin made the little chap
comfortable and stroked his hair for him. The child seemed numbed. His
poor face was as though petrified into a stiff expression made up, at
one and the same time, of fear and the wish not to show fear, of the
longing to scream and a pitiful effort not to scream.
</p><p>“Cry, my pet, cry,” said Lupin. “It’ll do you good to cry.”
</p><p>The child did not cry, but the voice was so gentle and so kind that he
relaxed his tense muscles; and, now that his eyes were calmer and
his mouth less contorted, Lupin, who was examining him closely, found
something that he recognized, an undoubted resemblance.
</p><p>This again confirmed certain facts which he suspected and which he had
for some time been linking in his mind. Indeed, unless he was mistaken,
the position was becoming very different and he would soon assume the
direction of events. After that...
</p><p>A ring at the bell followed, at once, by two others, sharp ones.
</p><p>“Hullo!” said Lupin to the child. “Here’s mummy come to fetch you. Don’t
move.”
</p><p>He ran and opened the door.
</p><p>A woman entered, wildly:
</p><p>“My son!” she screamed. “My son! Where is he?”
</p><p>“In my room,” said Lupin.
</p><p>Without asking more, thus proving that she knew the way, she rushed to
the bedroom.
</p><p>“As I thought,” muttered Lupin. “The youngish woman with the gray hair:
Daubrecq’s friend and enemy.”
</p><p>He walked to the window and looked through the curtains. Two men were
striding up and down the opposite pavement: the Growler and the Masher.
</p><p>“And they’re not even hiding themselves,” he said to himself. “That’s
a good sign. They consider that they can’t do without me any longer and
that they’ve got to obey the governor. There remains the pretty lady
with the gray hair. That will be more difficult. It’s you and I now,
mummy.”
</p><p>He found the mother and the boy clasped in each other’s arms; and
the mother, in a great state of alarm, her eyes moist with tears, was
saying:
</p><p>“You’re not hurt? You’re sure? Oh, how frightened you must have been, my
poor little Jacques!”
</p><p>“A fine little fellow,” said Lupin.
</p><p>She did not reply. She was feeling the child’s jersey, as Lupin had
done, no doubt to see if he had succeeded in his nocturnal mission; and
she questioned him in a whisper.
</p><p>“No, mummy,” said the child. “No, really.”
</p><p>She kissed him fondly and petted him, until, in a little while, the
child, worn out with fatigue and excitement, fell asleep. She remained
leaning over him for a long time. She herself seemed very much worn out
and in need of rest.
</p><p>Lupin did not disturb her contemplation. He looked at her anxiously,
with an attention which she did not perceive, and he noticed the wider
rings round her eyes and the deeper marks of wrinkles. Yet he considered
her handsomer than he had thought, with that touching beauty which
habitual suffering gives to certain faces that are more human, more
sensitive than others.
</p><p>She wore so sad an expression that, in a burst of instinctive sympathy,
he went up to her and said: “I do not know what your plans are, but,
whatever they may be, you stand in need of help. You cannot succeed
alone.”
</p><p>“I am not alone.”
</p><p>“The two men outside? I know them. They’re no good. I beseech you,
make use of me. You remember the other evening, at the theatre, in the
private box? You were on the point of speaking. Do not hesitate to-day.”
</p><p>She turned her eyes on him, looked at him long and fixedly and, as
though unable to escape that opposing will, she said:
</p><p>“What do you know exactly? What do you know about me?”
</p><p>“There are many things that I do not know. I do not know your name. But
I know...”
</p><p>She interrupted him with a gesture; and, resolutely, in her turn,
dominating the man who was compelling her to speak:
</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” she exclaimed. “What you know, after all, is not
much and is of no importance. But what are your plans? You offer me your
help: with what view? For what work? You have flung yourself headlong
into this business; I have been unable to undertake anything without
meeting you on my path: you must be contemplating some aim... What aim?”
</p><p>“What aim? Upon my word, it seems to me that my conduct...”
</p><p>“No, no,” she said, emphatically, “no phrases! What you and I want is
certainties; and, to achieve them, absolute frankness. I will set you
the example. M. Daubrecq possesses a thing of unparalleled value, not in
itself, but for what it represents. That thing you know. You have
twice held it in your hands. I have twice taken it from you. Well, I am
entitled to believe that, when you tried to obtain possession of it, you
meant to use the power which you attribute to it and to use it to your
own advantage...”
</p><p>“What makes you say that?”
</p><p>“Yes, you meant to use it to forward your schemes, in the interest of
your own affairs, in accordance with your habits as a...”
</p><p>“As a burglar and a swindler,” said Lupin, completing the sentence for
her.
</p><p>She did not protest. He tried to read her secret thoughts in the depths
of her eyes. What did she want with him? What was she afraid of? If she
mistrusted him, had he not also reasons to mistrust that woman who had
twice taken the crystal stopper from him to restore it to Daubrecq?
Mortal enemy of Daubrecq’s though she were, up to what point did she
remain subject to that man’s will? By surrendering himself to her,
did he not risk surrendering himself to Daubrecq? And yet he had never
looked upon graver eyes nor a more honest face.
</p><p>Without further hesitation, he stated:
</p><p>“My object is simple enough. It is the release of my friends Gilbert and
Vaucheray.”
</p><p>“Is that true? Is that true?” she exclaimed, quivering all over and
questioning him with an anxious glance.
</p><p>“If you knew me...”
</p><p>“I do know you... I know who you are. For months, I have taken part in
your life, without your suspecting it... and yet, for certain reasons, I
still doubt...”
</p><p>He said, in a more decisive tone:
</p><p>“You do not know me. If you knew me, you would know that there can be no
peace for me before my two companions have escaped the awful fate that
awaits them.”
</p><p>She rushed at him, took him by the shoulders and positively distraught,
said:
</p><p>“What? What did you say? The awful fate?... Then you believe... you
believe...”
</p><p>“I really believe,” said Lupin, who felt how greatly this threat upset
her, “I really believe that, if I am not in time, Gilbert and Vaucheray
are done for.”
</p><p>“Be quiet!... Be quiet!” she cried, clutching him fiercely. “Be
quiet!... You mustn’t say that... There is no reason... It’s just you
who suppose...”
</p><p>“It’s not only I, it’s Gilbert as well...”
</p><p>“What? Gilbert? How do you know?”
</p><p>“From himself?”
</p><p>“From him?”
</p><p>“Yes, from Gilbert, who has no hope left but in me; from Gilbert, who
knows that only one man in the world can save him and who, a few days
ago, sent me a despairing appeal from prison. Here is his letter.”
</p><p>She snatched the paper greedily and read in stammering accents:
</p><p>“Help, governor!... I am frightened!... I am frightened!...”
</p><p>She dropped the letter. Her hands fluttered in space. It was as though
her staring eyes beheld the sinister vision which had already so often
terrified Lupin. She gave a scream of horror, tried to rise and fainted.
