<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>When the sun shone, as it did with unusual brightness that Christmas
week, it revealed much that was faded and not altogether well-kept-up
in Stogdon House and its grounds. In truth, Sir Francis had retired
from service under the Government of India with a pension that
was not adequate, in his opinion, to his services, as it certainly
was not adequate to his ambitions. His career had not come up
to his expectations, and although he was a very fine, white-whiskered,
mahogany-colored old man to look at, and had laid down a very
choice cellar of good reading and good stories, you could not
long remain ignorant of the fact that some thunder-storm had soured
them; he had a grievance. This grievance dated back to the middle
years of the last century, when, owing to some official intrigue,
his merits had been passed over in a disgraceful manner in favor
of another, his junior.</p>

<p>The rights and wrongs of the story, presuming that they had some
existence in fact, were no longer clearly known to his wife and
children; but this disappointment had played a very large part
in their lives, and had poisoned the life of Sir Francis much
as a disappointment in love is said to poison the whole life of
a woman. Long brooding on his failure, continual arrangement and
rearrangement of his deserts and rebuffs, had made Sir Francis
much of an egoist, and in his retirement his temper became increasingly
difficult and exacting.</p>

<p>His wife now offered so little resistance to his moods that she
was practically useless to him. He made his daughter Eleanor into
his chief confidante, and the prime of her life was being rapidly
consumed by her father. To her he dictated the memoirs which were
to avenge his memory, and she had to assure him constantly that
his treatment had been a disgrace. Already, at the age of thirty-five,
her cheeks were whitening as her mother’s had whitened, but for
her there would be no memories of Indian suns and Indian rivers,
and clamor of children in a nursery; she would have very little
of substance to think about when she sat, as Lady Otway now sat,
knitting white wool, with her eyes fixed almost perpetually upon
the same embroidered bird upon the same fire-screen. But then
Lady Otway was one of the people for whom the great make-believe
game of English social life has been invented; she spent most
of her time in pretending to herself and her neighbors that she
was a dignified, important, much-occupied person, of considerable
social standing and sufficient wealth. In view of the actual state
of things this game needed a great deal of skill; and, perhaps,
at the age she had reached&mdash;she was over sixty&mdash;she played far
more to deceive herself than to deceive any one else. Moreover,
the armor was wearing thin; she forgot to keep up appearances
more and more.</p>

<p>The worn patches in the carpets, and the pallor of the drawing-room,
where no chair or cover had been renewed for some years, were
due not only to the miserable pension, but to the wear and tear
of twelve children, eight of whom were sons. As often happens
in these large families, a distinct dividing-line could be traced,
about half-way in the succession, where the money for educational
purposes had run short, and the six younger children had grown
up far more economically than the elder. If the boys were clever,
they won scholarships, and went to school; if they were not clever,
they took what the family connection had to offer them. The girls
accepted situations occasionally, but there were always one or
two at home, nursing sick animals, tending silkworms, or playing
the flute in their bedrooms. The distinction between the elder
children and the younger corresponded almost to the distinction
between a higher class and a lower one, for with only a haphazard
education and insufficient allowances, the younger children had
picked up accomplishments, friends, and points of view which were
not to be found within the walls of a public school or of a Government
office. Between the two divisions there was considerable hostility,
the elder trying to patronize the younger, the younger refusing
to respect the elder; but one feeling united them and instantly
closed any risk of a breach&mdash;their common belief in the superiority
of their own family to all others. Henry was the eldest of the
younger group, and their leader; he bought strange books and joined
odd societies; he went without a tie for a whole year, and had
six shirts made of black flannel. He had long refused to take
a seat either in a shipping office or in a tea-merchant’s warehouse;
and persisted, in spite of the disapproval of uncles and aunts,
in practicing both violin and piano, with the result that he could
not perform professionally upon either. Indeed, for thirty-two
years of life he had nothing more substantial to show than a manuscript
book containing the score of half an opera. In this protest of
his, Katharine had always given him her support, and as she was
generally held to be an extremely sensible person, who dressed
too well to be eccentric, he had found her support of some use.
Indeed, when she came down at Christmas she usually spent a great
part of her time in private conferences with Henry and with Cassandra,
the youngest girl, to whom the silkworms belonged. With the younger
section she had a great reputation for common sense, and for something
that they despised but inwardly respected and called knowledge
of the world&mdash;that is to say, of the way in which respectable
elderly people, going to their clubs and dining out with ministers,
think and behave. She had more than once played the part of ambassador
between Lady Otway and her children. That poor lady, for instance,
consulted her for advice when, one day, she opened Cassandra’s
bedroom door on a mission of discovery, and found the ceiling
hung with mulberry-leaves, the windows blocked with cages, and
the tables stacked with home-made machines for the manufacture
of silk dresses.</p>

<p>"I wish you could help her to take an interest in something that
other people are interested in, Katharine," she observed, rather
plaintively, detailing her grievances. "It’s all Henry’s doing,
you know, giving up her parties and taking to these nasty insects.
It doesn’t follow that if a man can do a thing a woman may too."</p>

<p>The morning was sufficiently bright to make the chairs and sofas
in Lady Otway’s private sitting-room appear more than usually
shabby, and the gallant gentlemen, her brothers and cousins, who
had defended the Empire and left their bones on many frontiers,
looked at the world through a film of yellow which the morning
light seemed to have drawn across their photographs. Lady Otway
sighed, it may be at the faded relics, and turned, with resignation,
to her balls of wool, which, curiously and characteristically,
were not an ivory-white, but rather a tarnished yellow-white.
She had called her niece in for a little chat. She had always
trusted her, and now more than ever, since her engagement to Rodney,
which seemed to Lady Otway extremely suitable, and just what one
would wish for one’s own daughter. Katharine unwittingly increased
her reputation for wisdom by asking to be given knitting-needles
too.</p>

<p>"It’s so very pleasant," said Lady Otway, "to knit while one’s
talking. And now, my dear Katharine, tell me about your plans."</p>

<p>The emotions of the night before, which she had suppressed in
such a way as to keep her awake till dawn, had left Katharine
a little jaded, and thus more matter-of-fact than usual. She was
quite ready to discuss her plans&mdash;houses and rents, servants and
economy&mdash;without feeling that they concerned her very much. As
she spoke, knitting methodically meanwhile, Lady Otway noted,
with approval, the upright, responsible bearing of her niece,
to whom the prospect of marriage had brought some gravity most
becoming in a bride, and yet, in these days, most rare. Yes, Katharine’s
engagement had changed her a little.</p>

<p>"What a perfect daughter, or daughter-in-law!" she thought to
herself, and could not help contrasting her with Cassandra, surrounded
by innumerable silkworms in her bedroom.</p>

<p>"Yes," she continued, glancing at Katharine, with the round,
greenish eyes which were as inexpressive as moist marbles, "Katharine
is like the girls of my youth. We took the serious things of life
seriously."  But just as she was deriving satisfaction from this
thought, and was producing some of the hoarded wisdom which none
of her own daughters, alas! seemed now to need, the door opened,
and Mrs. Hilbery came in, or rather, did not come in, but stood
in the doorway and smiled, having evidently mistaken the room.</p>

<p>"I never <em>SHALL </em>know my way about this house!" she exclaimed.
"I’m on my way to the library, and I don’t want to interrupt.
You and Katharine were having a little chat?"</p>

<p>The presence of her sister-in-law made Lady Otway slightly uneasy.
How could she go on with what she was saying in Maggie’s presence?
for she was saying something that she had never said, all these
years, to Maggie herself.</p>

<p>"I was telling Katharine a few little commonplaces about marriage,"
she said, with a little laugh. "Are none of my children looking
after you, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"Marriage," said Mrs. Hilbery, coming into the room, and nodding
her head once or twice, "I always say marriage is a school. And
you don’t get the prizes unless you go to school. Charlotte has
won all the prizes," she added, giving her sister-in-law a little
pat, which made Lady Otway more uncomfortable still. She half
laughed, muttered something, and ended on a sigh.</p>

<p>"Aunt Charlotte was saying that it’s no good being married unless
you submit to your husband," said Katharine, framing her aunt’s
words into a far more definite shape than they had really worn;
and when she spoke thus she did not appear at all old-fashioned.
Lady Otway looked at her and paused for a moment.</p>

<p>"Well, I really don’t advise a woman who wants to have things
her own way to get married," she said, beginning a fresh row rather
elaborately.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery knew something of the circumstances which, as she
thought, had inspired this remark. In a moment her face was clouded
with sympathy which she did not quite know how to express.</p>

<p>"What a shame it was!" she exclaimed, forgetting that her train
of thought might not be obvious to her listeners. "But, Charlotte,
it would have been much worse if Frank had disgraced himself in
any way. And it isn’t what our husbands <em>GET, </em>but what
they <em>ARE. I </em>used to dream of white horses and palanquins,
too; but still, I like the ink-pots best. And who knows?" she
concluded, looking at Katharine, "your father may be made a baronet
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Lady Otway, who was Mr. Hilbery’s sister, knew quite well that,
in private, the Hilberys called Sir Francis "that old Turk," and
though she did not follow the drift of Mrs. Hilbery’s remarks,
she knew what prompted them.</p>

<p>"But if you can give way to your husband," she said, speaking
to Katharine, as if there were a separate understanding between
them, "a happy marriage is the happiest thing in the world."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Katharine, "but&mdash;" She did not mean to finish her
sentence, she merely wished to induce her mother and her aunt
to go on talking about marriage, for she was in the mood to feel
that other people could help her if they would. She went on knitting,
but her fingers worked with a decision that was oddly unlike the
smooth and contemplative sweep of Lady Otway’s plump hand. Now
and then she looked swiftly at her mother, then at her aunt. Mrs.
Hilbery held a book in her hand, and was on her way, as Katharine
guessed, to the library, where another paragraph was to be added
to that varied assortment of paragraphs, the Life of Richard Alardyce.
Normally, Katharine would have hurried her mother downstairs,
and seen that no excuse for distraction came her way. Her attitude
towards the poet’s life, however, had changed with other changes;
and she was content to forget all about her scheme of hours. Mrs.
Hilbery was secretly delighted. Her relief at finding herself
excused manifested itself in a series of sidelong glances of sly
humor in her daughter’s direction, and the indulgence put her
in the best of spirits. Was she to be allowed merely to sit and
talk? It was so much pleasanter to sit in a nice room filled with
all sorts of interesting odds and ends which she hadn’t looked
at for a year, at least, than to seek out one date which contradicted
another in a dictionary.</p>

<p>"We’ve all had perfect husbands," she concluded, generously forgiving
Sir Francis all his faults in a lump. "Not that I think a bad
temper is really a fault in a man. I don’t mean a bad temper,"
she corrected herself, with a glance obviously in the direction
of Sir Francis. "I should say a quick, impatient temper. Most,
in fact <em>ALL </em>great men have had bad tempers&mdash;except your
grandfather, Katharine," and here she sighed, and suggested that,
perhaps, she ought to go down to the library.</p>

<p>"But in the ordinary marriage, is it necessary to give way to
one’s husband?" said Katharine, taking no notice of her mother’s
suggestion, blind even to the depression which had now taken possession
of her at the thought of her own inevitable death.</p>

<p>"I should say yes, certainly," said Lady Otway, with a decision
most unusual for her.</p>

<p>"Then one ought to make up one’s mind to that before one is married," 
Katharine mused, seeming to address herself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hilbery was not much interested in these remarks, which
seemed to have a melancholy tendency, and to revive her spirits
she had recourse to an infallible remedy&mdash;she looked out of the
window.</p>

<p>"Do look at that lovely little blue bird!" she exclaimed, and
her eye looked with extreme pleasure at the soft sky. at the trees,
at the green fields visible behind those trees, and at the leafless
branches which surrounded the body of the small blue tit. Her
sympathy with nature was exquisite.</p>

<p>"Most women know by instinct whether they can give it or not,"
Lady Otway slipped in quickly, in rather a low voice, as if she
wanted to get this said while her sister-in-law’s attention was
diverted. "And if not&mdash;well then, my advice would be&mdash;don’t marry."</p>

<p>"Oh, but marriage is the happiest life for a woman," said Mrs.
Hilbery, catching the word marriage, as she brought her eyes back
to the room again. Then she turned her mind to what she had said.</p>

<p>"It’s the most <em>INTERESTING </em>life," she corrected herself.
She looked at her daughter with a look of vague alarm. It was
the kind of maternal scrutiny which suggests that, in looking
at her daughter a mother is really looking at herself. She was
not altogether satisfied; but she purposely made no attempt to
break down the reserve which, as a matter of fact, was a quality
she particularly admired and depended upon in her daughter. But
when her mother said that marriage was the most interesting life,
Katharine felt, as she was apt to do suddenly, for no definite
reason, that they understood each other, in spite of differing
in every possible way. Yet the wisdom of the old seems to apply
more to feelings which we have in common with the rest of the
human race than to our feelings as individuals, and Katharine
knew that only some one of her own age could follow her meaning.
Both these elderly women seemed to her to have been content with
so little happiness, and at the moment she had not sufficient
force to feel certain that their version of marriage was the wrong
one. In London, certainly, this temperate attitude toward her
own marriage had seemed to her just. Why had she now changed?
Why did it now depress her? It never occurred to her that her
own conduct could be anything of a puzzle to her mother, or that
elder people are as much affected by the young as the young are
by them. And yet it was true that love&mdash;passion&mdash;whatever one
chose to call it, had played far less part in Mrs. Hilbery’s life
than might have seemed likely, judging from her enthusiastic and
imaginative temperament. She had always been more interested by
other things. Lady Otway, strange though it seemed, guessed more
accurately at Katharine’s state of mind than her mother did.</p>

<p>"Why don’t we all live in the country?" exclaimed Mrs. Hilbery,
once more looking out of the window. "I’m sure one would think
such beautiful things if one lived in the country. No horrid slum
houses to depress one, no trams or motor-cars; and the people
all looking so plump and cheerful. Isn’t there some little cottage
near you, Charlotte, which would do for us, with a spare room,
perhaps, in case we asked a friend down? And we should save so
much money that we should be able to travel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. You would find it very nice for a week or two, no doubt,"
said Lady Otway. "But what hour would you like the carriage this
morning?"  she continued, touching the bell.</p>

<p>"Katharine shall decide," said Mrs. Hilbery, feeling herself
unable to prefer one hour to another. "And I was just going to
tell you, Katharine, how, when I woke this morning, everything
seemed so clear in my head that if I’d had a pencil I believe
I could have written quite a long chapter. When we’re out on our
drive I shall find us a house. A few trees round it, and a little
garden, a pond with a Chinese duck, a study for your father, a
study for me, and a sitting room for Katharine, because then she’ll
be a married lady."</p>

<p>At this Katharine shivered a little, drew up to the fire, and
warmed her hands by spreading them over the topmost peak of the
coal. She wished to bring the talk back to marriage again, in
order to hear Aunt Charlotte’s views, but she did not know how
to do this.</p>

<p>"Let me look at your engagement-ring, Aunt Charlotte," she said,
noticing her own.</p>

<p>She took the cluster of green stones and turned it round and
round, but she did not know what to say next.</p>

<p>"That poor old ring was a sad disappointment to me when I first
had it,"  Lady Otway mused. "I’d set my heart on a diamond ring,
but I never liked to tell Frank, naturally. He bought it at Simla."</p>

<p>Katharine turned the ring round once more, and gave it back to
her aunt without speaking. And while she turned it round her lips
set themselves firmly together, and it seemed to her that she
could satisfy William as these women had satisfied their husbands;
she could pretend to like emeralds when she preferred diamonds.
Having replaced her ring, Lady Otway remarked that it was chilly,
though not more so than one must expect at this time of year.
Indeed, one ought to be thankful to see the sun at all, and she
advised them both to dress warmly for their drive. Her aunt’s
stock of commonplaces, Katharine sometimes suspected, had been
laid in on purpose to fill silences with, and had little to do
with her private thoughts. But at this moment they seemed terribly
in keeping with her own conclusions, so that she took up her knitting
again and listened, chiefly with a view to confirming herself
in the belief that to be engaged to marry some one with whom you
are not in love is an inevitable step in a world where the existence
of passion is only a traveller’s story brought from the heart
of deep forests and told so rarely that wise people doubt whether
the story can be true. She did her best to listen to her mother
asking for news of John, and to her aunt replying with the authentic
history of Hilda’s engagement to an officer in the Indian Army,
but she cast her mind alternately towards forest paths and starry
blossoms, and towards pages of neatly written mathematical signs.
When her mind took this turn her marriage seemed no more than
an archway through which it was necessary to pass in order to
have her desire. At such times the current of her nature ran in
its deep narrow channel with great force and with an alarming
lack of consideration for the feelings of others. Just as the
two elder ladies had finished their survey of the family prospects,
and Lady Otway was nervously anticipating some general statement
as to life and death from her sister-in-law, Cassandra burst into
the room with the news that the carriage was at the door.</p>

<p>"Why didn’t Andrews tell me himself?" said Lady Otway, peevishly,
blaming her servants for not living up to her ideals.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Hilbery and Katharine arrived in the hall, ready dressed
for their drive, they found that the usual discussion was going
forward as to the plans of the rest of the family. In token of
this, a great many doors were opening and shutting, two or three
people stood irresolutely on the stairs, now going a few steps
up, and now a few steps down, and Sir Francis himself had come
out from his study, with the "Times" under his arm, and a complaint
about noise and draughts from the open door which, at least, had
the effect of bundling the people who did not want to go into
the carriage, and sending those who did not want to stay back
to their rooms. It was decided that Mrs. Hilbery, Katharine, Rodney,
and Henry should drive to Lincoln, and any one else who wished
to go should follow on bicycles or in the pony-cart. Every one
who stayed at Stogdon House had to make this expedition to Lincoln
in obedience to Lady Otway’s conception of the right way to entertain
her guests, which she had imbibed from reading in fashionable
papers of the behavior of Christmas parties in ducal houses. The
carriage horses were both fat and aged, still they matched; the
carriage was shaky and uncomfortable, but the Otway arms were
visible on the panels. Lady Otway stood on the topmost step, wrapped
in a white shawl, and waved her hand almost mechanically until
they had turned the corner under the laurel-bushes, when she retired
indoors with a sense that she had played her part, and a sigh
at the thought that none of her children felt it necessary to
play theirs.</p>

<p>The carriage bowled along smoothly over the gently curving road.
Mrs. Hilbery dropped into a pleasant, inattentive state of mind,
in which she was conscious of the running green lines of the hedges,
of the swelling ploughland, and of the mild blue sky, which served
her, after the first five minutes, for a pastoral background to
the drama of human life; and then she thought of a cottage garden,
with the flash of yellow daffodils against blue water; and what
with the arrangement of these different prospects, and the shaping
of two or three lovely phrases, she did not notice that the young
people in the carriage were almost silent. Henry, indeed, had
been included against his wish, and revenged himself by observing
Katharine and Rodney with disillusioned eyes; while Katharine
was in a state of gloomy self-suppression which resulted in complete
apathy. When Rodney spoke to her she either said "Hum!" or assented
so listlessly that he addressed his next remark to her mother.
His deference was agreeable to her, his manners were exemplary;
and when the church towers and factory chimneys of the town came
into sight, she roused herself, and recalled memories of the fair
summer of 1853, which fitted in harmoniously with what she was
dreaming of the future.</p>
