<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The ocean beach of Apemama was our daily resort.  The coast is broken by
shallow bays.  The reef is detached, elevated, and includes a lagoon
about knee-deep, the unrestful spending-basin of the surf.  The beach is
now of fine sand, now of broken coral.  The trend of the coast being
convex, scarce a quarter of a mile of it is to be seen at once; the land
being so low, the horizon appears within a stone-cast; and the narrow
prospect enhances the sense of privacy.  Man avoids the place—even his
footprints are uncommon; but a great number of birds hover and pipe there
fishing, and leave crooked tracks upon the sand.  Apart from these, the
only sound (and I was going to say the only society), is that of the
breakers on the reef.
</p>
<p>On each projection of the coast, the bank of coral clinkers immediately
above the beach has been levelled, and a pillar built, perhaps
breast-high.  These are not sepulchral; all the dead being buried on the
inhabited side of the island, close to men’s houses, and (what is worse)
to their wells.  I was told they were to protect the isle against inroads
from the sea—divine or diabolical martellos, probably sacred to Taburik,
God of Thunder.
</p><p>The bay immediately opposite Equator Town, which we called Fu Bay, in
honour of our cook, was thus fortified on either horn.  It was well
sheltered by the reef, the enclosed water clear and tranquil, the
enclosing beach curved like a horseshoe, and both steep and broad.  The
path debouched about the midst of the re-entrant angle, the woods
stopping some distance inland.  In front, between the fringe of the wood
and the crown of the beach, there had been designed a regular figure,
like the court for some new variety of tennis, with borders of round
stones imbedded, and pointed at the angles with low posts, likewise of
stone.  This was the king’s Pray Place.  When he prayed, what he prayed
for, and to whom he addressed his supplications I could never learn.  The
ground was tapu.
</p><p>In the angle, by the mouth of the path, stood a deserted maniap’.  Near
by there had been a house before our coming, which was now transported
and figured for the moment in Equator Town.  It had been, and it would be
again when we departed, the residence of the guardian and wizard of the
spot—Tamaiti.  Here, in this lone place, within sound of the sea, he had
his dwelling and uncanny duties.  I cannot call to mind another case of a
man living on the ocean side of any open atoll; and Tamaiti must have had
strong nerves, the greater confidence in his own spells, or, what I
believe to be the truth, an enviable scepticism.  Whether Tamaiti had any
guardianship of the Pray Place I never heard.  But his own particular
chapel stood farther back in the fringe of the wood.  It was a tree of
respectable growth.  Around it there was drawn a circle of stones like
those that enclosed the Pray Place; in front, facing towards the sea, a
stone of a much greater size, and somewhat hollowed, like a piscina,
stood close against the trunk; in front of that again a conical pile of
gravel.  In the hollow of what I have called the piscina (though it
proved to be a magic seat) lay an offering of green cocoa-nuts; and when
you looked up you found the boughs of the tree to be laden with strange
fruit: palm-branches elaborately plaited, and beautiful models of canoes,
finished and rigged to the least detail.  The whole had the appearance of
a mid-summer and sylvan Christmas-tree <u>al fresco</u>.  Yet we were already
well enough acquainted in the Gilberts to recognise it, at the first
sight, for a piece of wizardry, or, as they say in the group, of
Devil-work.
</p><p>The plaited palms were what we recognised.  We had seen them before on
Apaiang, the most christianised of all these islands; where excellent Mr.
Bingham lived and laboured and has left golden memories; whence all the
education in the northern Gilberts traces its descent; and where we were
boarded by little native Sunday-school misses in clean frocks, with
demure faces, and singing hymns as to the manner born.
</p><p>Our experience of Devil-work at Apaiang had been as follows:—It chanced
we were benighted at the house of Captain Tierney.  My wife and I lodged
with a Chinaman some half a mile away; and thither Captain Reid and a
native boy escorted us by torch-light.  On the way the torch went out,
and we took shelter in a small and lonely Christian chapel to rekindle
it.  Stuck in the rafters of the chapel was a branch of knotted palm.
‘What is that?’ I asked.  ‘O, that’s Devil-work,’ said the Captain.  ‘And
what is Devil-work?’ I inquired.  ‘If you like, I’ll show you some when
we get to Johnnie’s,’ he replied.  ‘Johnnie’s’ was a quaint little house
upon the crest of the beach, raised some three feet on posts, approached
by stairs; part walled, part trellised.  Trophies of
advertisement-photographs were hung up within for decoration.  There was
a table and a recess-bed, in which Mrs. Stevenson slept; while I camped
on the matted floor with Johnnie, Mrs. Johnnie, her sister, and the
devil’s own regiment of cockroaches.  Hither was summoned an old witch,
who looked the part to horror.  The lamp was set on the floor; the crone
squatted on the threshold, a green palm-branch in her hand, the light
striking full on her aged features and picking out behind her, from the
black night, timorous faces of spectators.  Our sorceress began with a
chanted incantation; it was in the old tongue, for which I had no
interpreter; but ever and again there ran among the crowd outside that
laugh which every traveller in the islands learns so soon to
recognise,—the laugh of terror.  Doubtless these half-Christian folk were
shocked, these half-heathen folk alarmed.  Chench or Taburik thus
invoked, we put our questions; the witch knotted the leaves, here a leaf
and there a leaf, plainly on some arithmetical system; studied the result
with great apparent contention of mind; and gave the answers.  Sidney
Colvin was in robust health and gone a journey; and we should have a fair
wind upon the morrow: that was the result of our consultation, for which
we paid a dollar.  The next day dawned cloudless and breathless; but I
think Captain Reid placed a secret reliance on the sibyl, for the
schooner was got ready for sea.  By eight the lagoon was flawed with long
cat’s-paws, and the palms tossed and rustled; before ten we were clear of
the passage and skimming under all plain sail, with bubbling scuppers.
So we had the breeze, which was well worth a dollar in itself; but the
bulletin about my friend in England proved, some six months later, when I
got my mail, to have been groundless.  Perhaps London lies beyond the
horizon of the island gods.
</p><p>Tembinok’, in his first dealings, showed himself sternly averse from
superstition: and had not the <u>Equator</u> delayed, we might have left the
island and still supposed him an agnostic.  It chanced one day, however,
that he came to our maniap’, and found Mrs. Stevenson in the midst of a
game of patience.  She explained the game as well as she was able, and
wound up jocularly by telling him this was her devil-work, and if she
won, the <u>Equator</u> would arrive next day.  Tembinok’ must have drawn a
long breath; we were not so high-and-dry after all; he need no longer
dissemble, and he plunged at once into confessions.  He made devil-work
every day, he told us, to know if ships were coming in; and thereafter
brought us regular reports of the results.  It was surprising how
regularly he was wrong; but he always had an explanation ready.  There
had been some schooner in the offing out of view; but either she was not
bound for Apemama, or had changed her course, or lay becalmed.  I used to
regard the king with veneration as he thus publicly deceived himself.  I
saw behind him all the fathers of the Church, all the philosophers and
men of science of the past; before him, all those that are to come;
himself in the midst; the whole visionary series bowed over the same task
of welding incongruities.  To the end Tembinok’ spoke reluctantly of the
island gods and their worship, and I learned but little.  Taburik is the
god of thunder, and deals in wind and weather.  A while since there were
wizards who could call him down in the form of lightning.  ‘My patha he
tell me he see: you think he lie?’  Tienti—pronounced something like
‘Chench,’ and identified by his majesty with the devil—sends and removes
bodily sickness.  He is whistled for in the Paumotuan manner, and is said
to appear; but the king has never seen him.  The doctors treat disease by
the aid of Chench: eclectic Tembinok’ at the same time administering
‘pain-killer’ from his medicine-chest, so as to give the sufferer both
chances.  ‘I think mo’ betta,’ observed his majesty, with more than his
usual self-approval.  Apparently the gods are not jealous, and placidly
enjoy both shrine and priest in common.  On Tamaiti’s medicine-tree, for
instance, the model canoes are hung up <u>ex voto</u> for a prosperous voyage,
and must therefore be dedicated to Taburik, god of the weather; but the
stone in front is the place of sick folk come to pacify Chench.
</p><p>It chanced, by great good luck, that even as we spoke of these affairs, I
found myself threatened with a cold.  I do not suppose I was ever glad of
a cold before, or shall ever be again; but the opportunity to see the
sorcerers at work was priceless, and I called in the faculty of Apemama.
They came in a body, all in their Sunday’s best and hung with wreaths and
shells, the insignia of the devil-worker.  Tamaiti I knew already:
Terutak’ I saw for the first time—a tall, lank, raw-boned, serious
North-Sea fisherman turned brown; and there was a third in their company
whose name I never heard, and who played to Tamaiti the part of
<u>famulus</u>.  Tamaiti took me in hand first, and led me, conversing
agreeably, to the shores of Fu Bay.  The <u>famulus</u> climbed a tree for
some green cocoa-nuts.  Tamaiti himself disappeared a while in the bush
and returned with coco tinder, dry leaves, and a spray of waxberry.  I
was placed on the stone, with my back to the tree and my face to
windward; between me and the gravel-heap one of the green nuts was set;
and then Tamaiti (having previously bared his feet, for he had come in
canvas shoes, which tortured him) joined me within the magic circle,
hollowed out the top of the gravel-heap, built his fire in the bottom,
and applied a match: it was one of Bryant and May’s.  The flame was slow
to catch, and the irreverent sorcerer filled in the time with talk of
foreign places—of London, and ‘companies,’ and how much money they had;
of San Francisco, and the nefarious fogs, ‘all the same smoke,’ which had
been so nearly the occasion of his death.  I tried vainly to lead him to
the matter in hand.  ‘Everybody make medicine,’ he said lightly.  And
when I asked him if he were himself a good practitioner—‘No savvy,’ he
replied, more lightly still.  At length the leaves burst in a flame,
which he continued to feed; a thick, light smoke blew in my face, and the
flames streamed against and scorched my clothes.  He in the meanwhile
addressed, or affected to address, the evil spirit, his lips moving fast,
but without sound; at the same time he waved in the air and twice struck
me on the breast with his green spray.  So soon as the leaves were
consumed the ashes were buried, the green spray was imbedded in the
gravel, and the ceremony was at an end.
</p><p>A reader of the <u>Arabian Nights</u> felt quite at home.  Here was the
suffumigation; here was the muttering wizard; here was the desert place
to which Aladdin was decoyed by the false uncle.  But they manage these
things better in fiction.  The effect was marred by the levity of the
magician, entertaining his patient with small talk like an affable
dentist, and by the incongruous presence of Mr. Osbourne with a camera.
As for my cold, it was neither better nor worse.
</p><p>I was now handed over to Terutak’, the leading practitioner or medical
baronet of Apemama.  His place is on the lagoon side of the island, hard
by the palace.  A rail of light wood, some two feet high, encloses an
oblong piece of gravel like the king’s Pray Place; in the midst is a
green tree; below, a stone table bears a pair of boxes covered with a
fine mat; and in front of these an offering of food, a cocoa-nut, a piece
of taro or a fish, is placed daily.  On two sides the enclosure is lined
with maniap’s; and one of our party, who had been there to sketch, had
remarked a daily concourse of people and an extraordinary number of sick
children; for this is in fact the infirmary of Apemama.  The doctor and
myself entered the sacred place alone; the boxes and the mat were
displaced; and I was enthroned in their stead upon the stone, facing once
more to the east.  For a while the sorcerer remained unseen behind me,
making passes in the air with a branch of palm.  Then he struck lightly
on the brim of my straw hat; and this blow he continued to repeat at
intervals, sometimes brushing instead my arm and shoulder.  I have had
people try to mesmerise me a dozen times, and never with the least
result.  But at the first tap—on a quarter no more vital than my
hat-brim, and from nothing more virtuous than a switch of palm wielded by
a man I could not even see—sleep rushed upon me like an armed man.  My
sinews fainted, my eyes closed, my brain hummed, with drowsiness.  I
resisted, at first instinctively, then with a certain flurry of despair,
in the end successfully; if that were indeed success which enabled me to
scramble to my feet, to stumble home somnambulous, to cast myself at once
upon my bed, and sink at once into a dreamless stupor.  When I awoke my
cold was gone.  So I leave a matter that I do not understand.
</p><p>Meanwhile my appetite for curiosities (not usually very keen) had been
strangely whetted by the sacred boxes.  They were of pandanus wood,
oblong in shape, with an effect of pillaring along the sides like straw
work, lightly fringed with hair or fibre and standing on four legs.  The
outside was neat as a toy; the inside a mystery I was resolved to
penetrate.  But there was a lion in the path.  I might not approach
Terutak’, since I had promised to buy nothing in the island; I dared not
have recourse to the king, for I had already received from him more gifts
than I knew how to repay.  In this dilemma (the schooner being at last
returned) we hit on a device.  Captain Reid came forward in my stead,
professed an unbridled passion for the boxes, and asked and obtained
leave to bargain for them with the wizard.  That same afternoon the
captain and I made haste to the infirmary, entered the enclosure, raised
the mat, and had begun to examine the boxes at our leisure, when
Terutak’s wife bounced out of one of the nigh houses, fell upon us, swept
up the treasures, and was gone.  There was never a more absolute
surprise.  She came, she took, she vanished, we had not a guess whither;
and we remained, with foolish looks and laughter on the empty field.
Such was the fit prologue of our memorable bargaining.
</p><p>Presently Terutak’ came, bringing Tamaiti along with him, both smiling;
and we four squatted without the rail.  In the three maniap’s of the
infirmary a certain audience was gathered: the family of a sick child
under treatment, the king’s sister playing cards, a pretty girl, who
swore I was the image of her father; in all perhaps a score.  Terutak’s
wife had returned (even as she had vanished) unseen, and now sat,
breathless and watchful, by her husband’s side.  Perhaps some rumour of
our quest had gone abroad, or perhaps we had given the alert by our
unseemly freedom: certain, at least, that in the faces of all present,
expectation and alarm were mingled.
</p><p>Captain Reid announced, without preface or disguise, that I was come to
purchase; Terutak’, with sudden gravity, refused to sell.  He was
pressed; he persisted.  It was explained we only wanted one: no matter,
two were necessary for the healing of the sick.  He was rallied, he was
reasoned with: in vain.  He sat there, serious and still, and refused.
All this was only a preliminary skirmish; hitherto no sum of money had
been mentioned; but now the captain brought his great guns to bear.  He
named a pound, then two, then three.  Out of the maniap’s one person
after another came to join the group, some with mere excitement, others
with consternation in their faces.  The pretty girl crept to my side; it
was then that—surely with the most artless flattery—she informed me of my
likeness to her father.  Tamaiti the infidel sat with hanging head and
every mark of dejection.  Terutak’ streamed with sweat, his eye was
glazed, his face wore a painful rictus, his chest heaved like that of one
spent with running.  The man must have been by nature covetous; and I
doubt if ever I saw moral agony more tragically displayed.  His wife by
his side passionately encouraged his resistance.
</p><p>And now came the charge of the old guard.  The captain, making a skip,
named the surprising figure of five pounds.  At the word the maniap’s
were emptied.  The king’s sister flung down her cards and came to the
front to listen, a cloud on her brow.  The pretty girl beat her breast
and cried with wearisome iteration that if the box were hers I should
have it.  Terutak’s wife was beside herself with pious fear, her face
discomposed, her voice (which scarce ceased from warning and
encouragement) shrill as a whistle.  Even Terutak’ lost that image-like
immobility which he had hitherto maintained.  He rocked on his mat, threw
up his closed knees alternately, and struck himself on the breast after
the manner of dancers.  But he came gold out of the furnace; and with
what voice was left him continued to reject the bribe.
</p><p>And now came a timely interjection.  ‘Money will not heal the sick,’
observed the king’s sister sententiously; and as soon as I heard the
remark translated my eyes were unsealed, and I began to blush for my
employment.  Here was a sick child, and I sought, in the view of its
parents, to remove the medicine-box.  Here was the priest of a religion,
and I (a heathen millionaire) was corrupting him to sacrilege.  Here was
a greedy man, torn in twain betwixt greed and conscience; and I sat by
and relished, and lustfully renewed his torments.  <u>Ave</u>, <u>Cæsar</u>!
Smothered in a corner, dormant but not dead, we have all the one touch of
nature: an infant passion for the sand and blood of the arena.  So I
brought to an end my first and last experience of the joys of the
millionaire, and departed amid silent awe.  Nowhere else can I expect to
stir the depths of human nature by an offer of five pounds; nowhere else,
even at the expense of millions, could I hope to see the evil of riches
stand so legibly exposed.  Of all the bystanders, none but the king’s
sister retained any memory of the gravity and danger of the thing in
hand.  Their eyes glowed, the girl beat her breast, in senseless animal
excitement.  Nothing was offered them; they stood neither to gain nor to
lose; at the mere name and wind of these great sums Satan possessed them.
</p><p>From this singular interview I went straight to the palace; found the
king; confessed what I had been doing; begged him, in my name, to
compliment Terutak’ on his virtue, and to have a similar box made for me
against the return of the schooner.  Tembinok’, Rubam, and one of the
Daily Papers—him we used to call ‘the Facetiæ Column’—laboured for a
while of some idea, which was at last intelligibly delivered.  They
feared I thought the box would cure me; whereas, without the wizard, it
was useless; and when I was threatened with another cold I should do
better to rely on pain-killer.  I explained I merely wished to keep it in
my ‘outch’ as a thing made in Apemama and these honest men were much
relieved.
</p><p>Late the same evening, my wife, crossing the isle to windward, was aware
of singing in the bush.  Nothing is more common in that hour and place
than the jubilant carol of the toddy-cutter, swinging high overhead,
beholding below him the narrow ribbon of the isle, the surrounding field
of ocean, and the fires of the sunset.  But this was of a graver
character, and seemed to proceed from the ground-level.  Advancing a
little in the thicket, Mrs. Stevenson saw a clear space, a fine mat
spread in the midst, and on the mat a wreath of white flowers and one of
the devil-work boxes.  A woman—whom we guess to have been Mrs.
Terutak’—sat in front, now drooping over the box like a mother over a
cradle, now lifting her face and directing her song to heaven.  A passing
toddy-cutter told my wife that she was praying.  Probably she did not so
much pray as deprecate; and perhaps even the ceremony was one of
disenchantment.  For the box was already doomed; it was to pass from its
green medicine-tree, reverend precinct, and devout attendants; to be
handled by the profane; to cross three seas; to come to land under the
foolscap of St. Paul’s; to be domesticated within the hail of Lillie
Bridge; there to be dusted by the British housemaid, and to take perhaps
the roar of London for the voice of the outer sea along the reef.  Before
even we had finished dinner Chench had begun his journey, and one of the
newspapers had already placed the box upon my table as the gift of
Tembinok’.
</p><p>I made haste to the palace, thanked the king, but offered to restore the
box, for I could not bear that the sick of the island should be made to
suffer.  I was amazed by his reply.  Terutak’, it appeared, had still
three or four in reserve against an accident; and his reluctance, and the
dread painted at first on every face, was not in the least occasioned by
the prospect of medical destitution, but by the immediate divinity of
Chench.  How much more did I respect the king’s command, which had been
able to extort in a moment and for nothing a sacrilegious favour that I
had in vain solicited with millions!  But now I had a difficult task in
front of me; it was not in my view that Terutak’ should suffer by his
virtue; and I must persuade the king to share my opinion, to let me
enrich one of his subjects, and (what was yet more delicate) to pay for
my present.  Nothing shows the king in a more becoming light than the
fact that I succeeded.  He demurred at the principle; he exclaimed, when
he heard it, at the sum.  ‘Plenty money!’ cried he, with contemptuous
displeasure.  But his resistance was never serious; and when he had blown
off his ill-humour—‘A’ right,’ said he.  ‘You give him.  Mo’ betta.’
</p><p>Armed with this permission, I made straight for the infirmary.  The night
was now come, cool, dark, and starry.  On a mat hard by a clear fire of
wood and coco shell, Terutak’ lay beside his wife.  Both were smiling;
the agony was over, the king’s command had reconciled (I must suppose)
their agitating scruples; and I was bidden to sit by them and share the
circulating pipe.  I was a little moved myself when I placed five gold
sovereigns in the wizard’s hand; but there was no sign of emotion in
Terutak’ as he returned them, pointed to the palace, and named Tembinok’.
It was a changed scene when I had managed to explain.  Terutak’, long,
dour Scots fisherman as he was, expressed his satisfaction within bounds;
but the wife beamed; and there was an old gentleman present—her father, I
suppose—who seemed nigh translated.  His eyes stood out of his head;
‘<u>Kaupoi</u>, <u>Kaupoi</u>—rich, rich!’ ran on his lips like a refrain; and he
could not meet my eye but what he gurgled into foolish laughter.
</p><p>I might now go home, leaving that fire-lit family party gloating over
their new millions, and consider my strange day.  I had tried and
rewarded the virtue of Terutak’.  I had played the millionaire, had
behaved abominably, and then in some degree repaired my thoughtlessness.
And now I had my box, and could open it and look within.  It contained a
miniature sleeping-mat and a white shell.  Tamaiti, interrogated next day
as to the shell, explained it was not exactly Chench, but a cell, or
body, which he would at times inhabit.  Asked why there was a
sleeping-mat, he retorted indignantly, ‘Why have you mats?’  And this was
the sceptical Tamaiti!  But island scepticism is never deeper than the
lips.
