<p>Next morning, when he had once more resumed the dreadful burden
of education, it seemed infinitely duller. And yet what pleasanter
sight is there than a schoolroom well filled with children of
those sprouting years just before the 'teens? The casual visitor,
gazing from the teacher's platform upon these busy little heads,
needs only a blunted memory to experience the most agreeable and
exhilarating sensations. Still, for the greater part, the children
are unconscious of the happiness of their condition; for nothing
is more pathetically true than that we "never know when we are
well off." The boys in a public school are less aware of their
happy state than are the girls; and of all the boys in his room,
probably Penrod himself had the least appreciation of his felicity.</p>

<p>He sat staring at an open page of a textbook, but not studying;
not even reading; not even thinking. Nor was he lost in a reverie:
his mind's eye was shut, as his physical eye might well have been,
for the optic nerve, flaccid with ennui, conveyed nothing whatever
of the printed page upon which the orb of vision was partially
focused. Penrod was doing something very unusual and rare, something
almost never accomplished except by coloured people or by a boy
in school on a spring day: he was doing really nothing at all.
He was merely a state of being.</p>

<p>From the street a sound stole in through the open window, and
abhorring Nature began to fill the vacuum called Penrod Schofield;
for the sound was the spring song of a mouth-organ, coming down
the sidewalk. The windows were intentionally above the level of
the eyes of the seated pupils; but the picture of the musician
was plain to Penrod, painted for him by a quality in the runs
and trills, partaking of the oboe, of the calliope, and of cats
in anguish; an excruciating sweetness obtained only by the wallowing,
walloping yellow-pink palm of a hand whose back was Congo black
and shiny. The music came down the street and passed beneath the
window, accompanied by the care-free shuffling of a pair of old
shoes scuffing syncopations on the cement sidewalk. It passed
into the distance; became faint and blurred; was gone. Emotion
stirred in Penrod a great and poignant desire, but (perhaps fortunately)
no fairy godmother made her appearance.</p>

<p>Otherwise Penrod would have gone down the street in a black skin,
playing the mouth-organ, and an unprepared coloured youth would
have found himself enjoying educational advantages for which he
had no ambition whatever.</p>

<p>Roused from perfect apathy, the boy cast about the schoolroom
an eye wearied to nausea by the perpetual vision of the neat teacher
upon the platform, the backs of the heads of the pupils in front
of him, and the monotonous stretches of blackboard threateningly
defaced by arithmetical formulae and other insignia of torture.
Above the blackboard, the walls of the high room were of white
plaster&mdash;white with the qualified whiteness of old snow in a soft
coal town. This dismal expanse was broken by four lithographic
portraits, votive offerings of a thoughtful publisher. The portraits
were of good and great men, kind men; men who loved children.
Their faces were noble and benevolent. But the lithographs offered
the only rest for the eyes of children fatigued by the everlasting
sameness of the schoolroom. Long day after long day, interminable
week in and interminable week out, vast month on vast month, the
pupils sat with those four portraits beaming kindness down upon
them. The faces became permanent in the consciousness of the children;
they became an obsession&mdash;in and out of school the children were
never free of them. The four faces haunted the minds of children
falling asleep; they hung upon the minds of children waking at
night; they rose forebodingly in the minds of children waking
in the morning; they became monstrously alive in the minds of
children lying sick of fever. Never, while the children of that
schoolroom lived, would they be able to forget one detail of the
four lithographs: the hand of Longfellow was fixed, for them,
forever, in his beard. And by a simple and unconscious association
of ideas, Penrod Schofield was accumulating an antipathy for the
gentle Longfellow and for James Russell Lowell and for Oliver
Wendell Holmes and for John Greenleaf Whittier, which would never
permit him to peruse a work of one of those great New Englanders
without a feeling of personal resentment.</p>

<p>His eyes fell slowly and inimically from the brow of Whittier
to the braid of reddish hair belonging to Victorine Riordan, the
little octoroon girl who sat directly in front of him. Victorine's
back was as familiar to Penrod as the necktie of Oliver Wendell
Holmes. So was her gayly coloured plaid waist. He hated the waist
as he hated Victorine herself, without knowing why. Enforced companionship
in large quantities and on an equal basis between the sexes appears
to sterilize the affections, and schoolroom romances are few.</p>

<p>Victorine's hair was thick, and the brickish glints in it were
beautiful, but Penrod was very tired of it. A tiny knot of green
ribbon finished off the braid and kept it from unravelling; and
beneath the ribbon there was a final wisp of hair which was just
long enough to repose upon Penrod's desk when Victorine leaned
back in her seat. It was there now. Thoughtfully, he took the
braid between thumb and forefinger, and, without disturbing Victorine,
dipped the end of it and the green ribbon into the inkwell of
his desk. He brought hair and ribbon forth dripping purple ink,
and partially dried them on a blotter, though, a moment later
when Victorine leaned forward, they were still able to add a few
picturesque touches to the plaid waist.</p>

<p>Rudolph Krauss, across the aisle from Penrod, watched the operation
with protuberant eyes, fascinated. Inspired to imitation, he took
a piece of chalk from his pocket and wrote "<em>RATS" </em>across
the shoulder-blades of the boy in front of him, then looked across
appealingly to Penrod for tokens of congratulation. Penrod yawned.
It may not be denied that at times he appeared to be a very self-centred
boy.</p>
