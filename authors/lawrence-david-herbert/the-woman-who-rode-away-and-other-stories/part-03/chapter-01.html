&quot;Take her away, into the sun,&quot; the doctor said.  She herself was
sceptical of the sun, but she permitted herself to be carried away,
with her child, and a nurse, and her mother, over the sea.</p>

<p>The ship sailed at midnight.  And for two hours her husband stayed
with her, while the child was put to bed, and the passengers came
on board.  It was a black night, the Hudson swayed with heaving
blackness, shaken over with spilled dribbles of light.  She leaned
over the rail, and looking down thought: this is the sea; it is
deeper than one imagines, and fuller of memories.  At that moment
the sea seemed to heave like the serpent of chaos that has lived
for ever.</p>

<p>&quot;These partings are no good, you know,&quot; her husband was saying, at
her side.  &quot;They're no good.  I don't like them.&quot;</p>

<p>His tone was full of apprehension, misgiving, and there was a
certain clinging to the last straw of hope.</p>

<p>&quot;No, neither do I,&quot; she responded in a flat voice.  She remembered
how bitterly they wanted to get away from one another, he and she.
The emotion of parting gave a slight tug at her emotions, but only
caused the iron that had gone into her soul to gore deeper.</p>

<p>So, they looked at their sleeping son, and the father's eyes were
wet.  But it is not the wetting of the eyes that counts, it is the
deep iron rhythm of habit, the year-long, life-habits; the deep-set
stroke of power.</p>

<p>And in their two lives, the stroke of power was hostile, his and
hers.  Like two engines running at variance, they shattered one
another.</p>

<p>&quot;All ashore!  All ashore!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maurice, you must go.&quot;</p>

<p>And she thought to herself:  For him it is All Ashore!  For me it
is Out to Sea!</p>

<p>Well, he waved his hanky on the midnight dreariness of the pier, as
the boat inched away; one among a crowd.  One among a crowd!  C'est
&ccedil;a!</p>

<p>The ferry-boats, like great dishes piled with rows of lights, were
still slanting across the Hudson.  That black mouth must be the
Lackawanna Station.</p>

<p>The ship ebbed on between the lights, the Hudson seemed
interminable.  But at last they were round the bend, and there was
the poor harvest of lights at the Battery.  Liberty flung up her
torch in a tantrum.  There was the wash of the sea.</p>

<p>And though the Atlantic was grey as lava, they did come at last
into the sun.  Even she had a house above the bluest of seas, with
a vast garden, or vineyard, all vines and olives, dropping steeply
in terrace after terrace, to the strip of coast plain; and the
garden full of secret places, deep groves of lemon far down in the
cleft of earth, and hidden, pure green reservoirs of water; then a
spring issuing out of a little cavern, where the old Sicules had
drunk before the Greeks came; and a grey goat bleating, stabled in
an ancient tomb with the niches empty.  There was the scent of
mimosa, and beyond, the snow of the volcano.</p>

<p>She saw it all, and in a measure it was soothing.  But it was all
external.  She didn't really care about it.  She was herself just
the same, with all her anger and frustration inside her, and her
incapacity to feel anything real.  The child imitated her, and
preyed on her peace of mind.  She felt so horribly, ghastly
responsible for him: as if she must be responsible for every breath
he drew.  And that was torture to her, to the child, and to
everybody else concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Juliet, the doctor told you to lie in the sun, without
your clothes.  Why don't you?&quot; said her mother.</p>

<p>&quot;When I am fit to do so, I will.  Do you want to kill me?&quot; Juliet
flew at her.</p>

<p>&quot;To kill you, no!  Only to do you good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For God's sake, leave off wanting to do me good.&quot;</p>

<p>The mother at last was so hurt and incensed, she departed.</p>

<p>The sea went white, and then invisible.  Pouring rain fell.  It was
cold, in the house built for the sun.</p>

<p>Again a morning when the sun lifted himself molten and sparkling,
naked over the sea's rim.  The house faced south-east, Juliet lay
in her bed and watched him rise.  It was as if she had never seen
the sun rise before.  She had never seen the naked sun stand up
pure upon the sea-line, shaking the night off himself, like
wetness.  And he was full and naked.  And she wanted to come to
him.</p>

<p>So the desire sprang secretly in her, to be naked to the sun.  She
cherished her desire like a secret.  She wanted to come together
with the sun.</p>

<p>But she would have to go away from the house - away from people.
And it is not easy, in a country where every olive tree has eyes,
and every slope is seen from afar, to go hidden, and have
intercourse with the sun.</p>

<p>But she found a place: a rocky bluff shoved out to the sea and sun,
and overgrown with the large cactus called prickly pear.  Out of
this thicket of cactus rose one cypress tree, with a pallid, thick
trunk, and a tip that leaned over, flexible, in the blue.  It stood
like a guardian looking to sea; or a candle whose huge flame was
darkness against light: the long tongue of darkness licking up at
the sky.</p>

<p>Juliet sat down by the cypress tree, and took off her clothes.  The
contorted cactus made a forest, hideous yet fascinating, about her.
She sat and offered her bosom to the sun, sighing, even now, with a
certain hard pain, against the cruelty of having to give herself:
but exulting that at last it was no human lover.</p>

<p>But the sun marched in blue heaven and sent down his rays as he
went.  She felt the soft air of the sea on her breasts, that seemed
as if they would never ripen.  But she hardly felt the sun.  Fruits
that would wither and not mature, her breasts.</p>

<p>Soon, however, she felt the sun inside them, warmer than ever love
had been, warmer than milk or the hands of her baby.  At last, her
breasts were like long white grapes in the hot sun.</p>

<p>She slid off all her clothes, and lay naked in the sun, and as she
lay she looked up through her fingers at the central sun, his blue
pulsing roundness, whose outer edges streamed brilliance.  Pulsing
with marvellous blue, and alive, and streaming white fire from his
edges, the Sun!  He faced down to her with blue body of fire, and
enveloped her breasts and her face, her throat, her tired belly,
her knees, her thighs and her feet.</p>

<p>She lay with shut eyes, the colour of rosy flame through her lids.
It was too much.  She reached and put leaves over her eyes.  Then
she lay again, like a long gourd in the sun, green that must ripen
to gold.</p>

<p>She could feel the sun penetrating into her bones; nay, further,
even into her emotions and thoughts.  The dark tensions of her
emotion began to give way, the cold dark clots of her thoughts
began to dissolve.  She was beginning to be warm right through.
Turning over, she let her shoulders lie in the sun, her loins, the
backs of her thighs, even her heels.  And she lay half stunned with
the strangeness of the thing that was happening to her.  Her weary,
chilled heart was melting, and in melting, evaporating.  Only her
womb remained tense and resistant, the eternal resistance.  It
would resist even the sun.</p>

<p>When she was dressed again she lay once more and looked up at the
cypress tree, whose crest, a filament, fell this way and that in
the breeze.  Meanwhile, she was conscious of the great sun roaming
in heaven, and of her own resistance.</p>

<p>So, dazed, she went home, only half-seeing, sun-blinded and sun-
dazed.  And her blindness was like a richness to her, and her dim,
warm, heavy half-consciousness was like wealth.</p>

<p>&quot;Mummy!  Mummy!&quot; her child came running towards her, calling in
that peculiar bird-like little anguish of want, always wanting her.
She was surprised that her drowsed heart for once felt none of the
anxious love-tension in return.  She caught the child up in her
arms, but she thought:  He should not be such a lump!  If he had
any sun in him, he would spring up. - And she felt again the
unyielding resistance of her womb, against him and everything.</p>

<p>She resented, rather, his little hands clutching at her, especially
her neck.  She pulled her throat away.  She did not want him
getting hold of it.  She put the child down.</p>

<p>&quot;Run!&quot; she said.  &quot;Run in the sun!&quot;</p>

<p>And there and then she took off his clothes and set him naked on
the warm terrace.</p>

<p>&quot;Play in the sun!&quot; she said.</p>

<p>He was frightened and wanted to cry.  But she, in the warm
indolence of her body, and the complete indifference of her heart,
and the resistance of her womb, rolled him an orange across the red
tiles, and with his soft, unformed little body he toddled after it.
Then, immediately he had it, he dropped it because it felt strange
against his flesh.  And he looked back at her, wrinkling his face
to cry, frightened because he was stark.</p>

<p>&quot;Bring me the orange,&quot; she said, amazed at her own deep
indifference to his trepidation.  &quot;Bring Mummy the orange.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He shall not grow up like his father,&quot; she said to herself.  &quot;Like
a worm that the sun has never seen.&quot;</p>
