<p>"Burgess!"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>Berkley sat up in bed and viewed his environment with disgust.</p>

<p>"These new lodgings would make a fair kennel, wouldn't they,
Burgess?&mdash;if a man isn't too particular about his dog."</p>

<p>The servant entered with a nasty smirk.  "Yes, sir; I seen a
rat last night."</p>

<p>"He's not the only one, is he, Burgess," yawned Berkley.  "Oh,
hell! I've got to dress.  Did you paint that bathtub? I guess
you did, the place reeks like a paint shop.  Anyway, it kills
less desirable aromas.  Where's the water?"</p>

<p>He swung his symmetrical body to the bed's edge, dropped lightly
to the carpet, unloosed his night robe, and stretched himself.</p>

<p>"Was I very drunk, Burgess?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; you just went to sleep.  You haven't got no headache,
have you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but it was only corn whisky.  I didn't remember what I did
with it.  Is there any left?"</p>

<p>"Not much, sir."</p>

<p>The servant, ugly to the verge of deformity, and wearing invariably
the abominable smirk that disgusted others but amused Berkley,
went about his duties.</p>

<p>Berkley blinked at him reflectively, then bathed, dressed, and
sat down to a bowl of chocolate and a bit of bread.</p>

<p>"What the devil was all that row this morning, Burgess?"</p>

<p>"War, sir.  The President has called for seventy-five thousand
men. Here it is, sir."  And he laid a morning paper beside the
cup of chocolate, which Berkley studied between sips, commenting
occasionally aloud:</p>

<p>"Heavens, Burgess, why, we're a race of patriots!  Now who on
earth could have suspected that. . . .  Why, we seem to be heroes,
too! What do you think of that, Burgess?  You're a hero; I'm a
hero; everybody north of Charleston is an embattled citizen or
a hero! Isn't it funny that nobody realised all this before?"
. . .  He turned the paper leisurely sipping his chocolate. .
. .  "<em>Of</em> course&mdash;the 'dear old flag'!  That's the cheese,
isn't it, Burgess? Been insulted, hasn't it?  And we're all going
to Charleston to punch that wicked Beauregard in the nose. . .
.  Burgess, you and I are neglecting our duty as heroes; there's
much shouting to be done yet, much yelling in the streets, much
arguing to be done, many, many cocktails to be firmly and uncompromisingly
swallowed.  Are you prepared to face the serious consequences
of being a hero?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said Burgess.</p>

<p>"You merit well of the republic!  The country needs you.  Here's
half a dollar.  Do your duty unflinchingly&mdash;at the nearest bar!"</p>

<p>Burgess took the coin with a smirk.</p>

<p>"Mr. Berkley, the landlady sent word that times is hard."</p>

<p>"Bless her soul!  They <em>are</em> hard, Burgess.  Inform her
of my sentiments," said Berkley cordially.  "Now, my hat and cane,
if you please.  We're a wonderful people, Burgess; we'll beat
our walking-sticks into bayonets if Mr.  Beauregard insists on
saying boo to us too many times in succession. . . .  And, Burgess?"</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Now that you have waked up this morning to find yourself a hero,
I think you'd better find yourself another and more spectacular
master.  My heroism, for the future, is to be more or less inconspicuous;
in fact, I begin the campaign by inserting my own studs and cleaning
my own clothes, and keeping out of gaol; and the sooner I go where
that kind of glory calls me the sooner my name will be emblazoned
in the bright lexicon of youth where there's no such word as 'jail.'",</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"In simpler and more archaic phrase, I can't afford you, Burgess,
unless I pilfer for a living."</p>

<p>"I don't eat much, sir."</p>

<p>"No, you don't <em>eat</em> much."</p>

<p>"I could quit drinking, sir."</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> is really touching, Burgess.  This alcohol pickled
integument of yours covers a trusting heart.  But it won't do.
Heroics in a hall bedroom cut no coupons, my poor friend.  Our
paths to glory and the grave part just outside the door-sill yonder."</p>

<p>"<em>She</em> said I could stay, sir."</p>

<p>"Which <em>she</em>?"</p>

<p>"The landlady.  I'm to fetch coal and run errants and wait on
table.  But you'll get the best cuts, sir.  And after hours I
can see to your clothes and linen and boots and hats, and do your
errants same like the usual."</p>

<p>"Now this is nearly as pathetic as our best fiction," said Berkley;
"ruined master, faithful man&mdash;<em>won't</em> leave&mdash;starves slowly
at his master's feet&mdash;tootle music very sneaky&mdash;'transformation! 
Burgess in heaven, blinking, puzzled, stretching one wing, reflectively
scratching his halo with right hind foot.  Angel chorus.  Burgess
appears to enjoy it and lights one of my best cigars&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sir?" said Burgess, very red.</p>

<p>Berkley swung around, levelled his walking-stick, and indicated
the pit of his servant's stomach:</p>

<p>"Your face is talking now; wait till <em>that</em> begins to
yell.  It will take more than I'm earning to fill it."</p>

<p>He stood a moment, smiling, curious.  Then:</p>

<p>"You've been as faithless a valet as any servant who ever watered
wine, lost a gimcrack, or hooked a weed.  Studs, neckcloths, bootjacks,
silk socks, pins, underwear&mdash;all magically and eventually faded
from my wardrobe, wafted to those silent bournes of swag that
valets wot of.  What in hell do you want to stay <em>here</em>
for now, you amusing wastrel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir.  I'd prefer to stay with you."</p>

<p>"But there'll be no more pleasant pickings, my poor and faithless
steward!  If you should convert anything more to your own bank
account I'll be obliged to stroll about naked."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," muttered Burgess; "I brought back some things last
night&mdash;them socks, shirt-pins and studs, and the fob. . . .  Yes,
sir; I fetched 'em back, I did&mdash;"  A sudden and curious gleam
of pride crossed the smirk for an instant;&mdash;"I guess my gentleman
ain't agoing to <em>look</em> no worse than the next Fifth Avenue
swell he meets&mdash;even if he ain't et no devilled kidneys for breakfast
and he don't dine on no canvas-back at Delmonico's.  No, sir."</p>

<p>Berkley sat down on the bed's edge and laughed until he could
scarcely see the man, who observed him in patient annoyance. 
And every time Berkley looked at him he went into another fit
of uncontrollable laughter, as he realised the one delightful
weakness in this thorough-paced rogue&mdash;pride in the lustre cast
upon himself by the immaculate appearance of a fashionable master. 
But after reflection, it did not astonish him too much; the besetting
weakness of rogues is vanity in one form or another.  This happened
to be an unusual form.</p>

<p>"Burgess," he said, "I don't care how you go to hell.  Go with
me if you like or go it alone."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"You're welcome," replied Berkley gravely, and, tucking his cane
up under one arm, he went out to business, drawing on a pair of
lemon-coloured kid gloves.</p>

<p>Later he searched his pockets for the cigar he had denied himself
the evening before.  It was not there.  In fact, at that moment,
Burgess, in the boarding-house backyard, was promenading up and
down, leering at the Swedish scullion, and enjoying the last expensive
cigar that his master was likely to purchase in many a day.</p>

<p>The street, and avenue were seething with people; people stood
at their windows looking out at the news-boys who swarmed everywhere,
shouting endless extras; people were gathering on corners, in
squares, along park railings, under porticos of hotels, and every
one of them had a newspaper and was reading.</p>

<p>In front of the St. Nicholas Hotel a lank and shabby man had
mounted a cracker box, and was evidently making a speech, but
Berkley could distinguish nothing he said because of the wild
cheering.</p>

<p>Everywhere, threading the throng, hurried boys and men selling
miniature flags, red-white-and-blue rosettes, and tricoloured
cockades; and everybody was purchasing the national colours&mdash;the
passing crowd had already become bright with badges; the Union
colours floated in streamers from the throats or sleeves of pretty
girls, glinted in the lapels of dignified old gentlemen, decorated
the hats of the stage-drivers and the blinders of their horses.</p>

<p>"Certainly," said Berkley, buying a badge and pinning it in his
button-hole.  "Being a hero, I require the trade-mark.  Kindly
permit that I offer a suggestion&mdash;" a number of people waiting
to buy badges; were now listening to him&mdash;"those gentlemen gathered
there in front of the New York Hotel seem to be without these
marks which distinguish heroes from citizens.  No doubt they'll
be delighted to avail themselves of your offered cockades."</p>

<p>A quick laugh broke out from those around, but there was an undertone
of menace in it, because the undecorated gentlemen in front of
the New York Hotel were probably Southerners, and Secessionists
in principles; that hostelry being the rendezvous in New York
of everything Southern.</p>

<p>So, having bestowed his mischievous advice, Berkley strolled
on down Broadway, his destination being the offices of Craig and
Son, City and Country Real Estate, where he had a desk to himself,
a client or two in prospect, and considerable leisure to study
the street, gas, and sewer maps of New York City.</p>

<p>Tiring of this distraction, he was always at liberty to twiddle
his thumbs, twirl his pencil, yawn, blink, and look out of the
window at the City Park across the way, where excited citizens
maintained a steady yelling monotone before the neighbouring newspaper
offices all day long.</p>

<p>He was also free to reflect upon his own personal shortcomings,
a speculation perhaps less damaging than the recent one he had
indulged in; and he thought about it sometimes; and sometimes
about Ailsa Paige, whom he had not again seen since the unaccountable
madness had driven him to trample and destroy the first real inclination
he had ever had for a woman.</p>

<p>This inclination he occasionally found leisure to analyse, but,
not understanding it, never got very far, except that, superficially,
it had been more or less physical.  From the moment he saw her
he was conscious that she was different; insensibly the exquisitely
volatile charm of her enveloped him, and he betrayed it, awaking
her, first, to uneasy self-consciousness; then uneasy consciousness
of him; then, imperceptibly, through distrust, alarm, and a thousand
inexplicable psychological emotions, to a wistful interest that
faintly responded to his.  Ah! that response!&mdash;strange, childish,
ignorant, restless&mdash;but still a response; and from obscure shallows
unsuspected, uncomprehended&mdash;shallows that had never before warned
her with the echo of an evanescent ripple.</p>

<p>For him to have reflected, reasoned, halted himself, had been
useless from the beginning.  The sister-in-law of this girl knew
who and what he was and had been.  There was no hope for him. 
To let himself drift; to evoke in her, sometimes by hazard, at
times with intent, the delicate response&mdash;faint echo&mdash;pale shadow
of the virile emotions she evoked in him, that, too, was useless. 
He knew it, yet curious to try, intent on developing communication
through those exquisite and impalpable lines that threaded the
mystery from him to her&mdash;from her to him.</p>

<p>And then, when the mystery all about them was aquiver, and her
vague eyes met his through the magic, acquiescent under a sorcery
for which she had no name&mdash;then, when all things occult breathed
silence&mdash;then he had said too much!</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well that he had said it then as later&mdash;as
well perhaps that, losing self-control, defeat had moved his tongue
to boast, had fixed the empty eye and stamped the smile he wore
with a confidence dead in him for ever.</p>

<p>He had said that he would come back.  He knew that he would not.</p>

<p>It was the pitiful defiance of a boaster hopelessly hurt.</p>

<p>He no longer desired to see her again.  Never again would he
risk enduring what she had evoked in him, whatever it was of good
or of evil, of the spiritual or the impure&mdash;he did not know he
was aware only of what his eyes had beheld and his heart had begun
to desire.</p>

<p>On his way back from the office that evening he met Camilla Lent
and her uncle, the Captain, and would have passed with an amiable
salute, but the girl evinced a decided desire to speak.  So he
turned and joined them.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Camilla?  How are you, Captain Lent?  This re-conversion
of the nation's ploughshares and pruning hooks is a noisy affair,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"April 18th, 1861!" replied the Captain quickly.  "What you hear,
sir, is the attrition consequent upon the grinding together of
certain millstones belonging to the gods."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, Captain Lent; they'll probably make meal
of us all.  Are you offering your services, sir."</p>

<p>Camilla said quickly, and with gayest confidence: "Uncle has
been looking about casually.  There are so many regiments forming,
so many recruiting stations that we&mdash;we haven't decided&mdash;have
we, uncle?"  And she gave Berkley a wistful, harrowing glance
that enlightened him.</p>

<p>He said gravely: "I suppose the average age of these volunteers
will be about eighteen.  And if the militia go, too, it will be
comforting for a defenceless city to know she has men of your
experience to count on, Captain Lent."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> am going to the front," observed the Captain.</p>

<p>"There may be much to be done in New York, sir."</p>

<p>"Then let the police do it," said Captain Lent calmly.  "The
Union must and shall be preserved.  If any man attempts to haul
down the American flag, shoot him upon the spot.  Et cetera, sir,
et cetera."</p>

<p>"Certainly.  But it's a question of niggers, too, I believe."</p>

<p>"No, sir.  It is <em>not</em> a question of niggers.  It is a
question of who's at the wheel, Union or State.  I myself never
had any doubts any more than I ever doubted the Unitarian faith! 
So it is no question for me, sir.  What bothers me is to pick
out the regiment most likely to be sent first."</p>

<p>"We've walked our legs off," said Camilla, aside, "and we've
been in all kinds of frightful places where men are drilling and
smoking and swearing and yelling; and I was dreadfully afraid
a gun would go off or somebody would be impudent to uncle.  The
dear old thing," she whispered, "he is perfectly sure they want
him and that he has only to choose a regiment and offer his sword. 
Oh, dear! I'm beginning to be terribly unhappy &mdash;I'm afraid
they won't let him go and I'm deadly afraid they might!  And I'm
sure that Jim means to go.  Oh, dear!  Have you seen Ailsa Paige
lately?"</p>

<p>"No. . . .  I hope she is quite well."</p>

<p>"You are not very enthusiastic."</p>

<p>"I have every reason to be.  She is a very winsome girl."</p>

<p>"She's a dear. . . .  She has spoken of you several times."</p>

<p>"That is most amiable of her, and of you to say so."</p>

<p>"Oh, very," laughed Camilla, tossing her pretty head, "but it
evidently does not interest you very much.  In fact&mdash;" she glanced
sidewise&mdash;"it is understood that no woman ever interests you for
more than forty-eight consecutive hours."</p>

<p>"Pure slander, Camilla.  <em>You</em> do."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;not in the way I mean."</p>

<p>"Well, but you don't expect me to be interested in Mrs. Paige&mdash;in
the way <em>you</em> mean do you?"</p>

<p>"Why not?" she asked mischievously.</p>

<p>"Because, to begin properly, Mrs. Paige is not likely ever to
become interested in me."</p>

<p>"I am heartily glad of it," retorted Camilla.  "You'd forget
her in a week,"</p>

<p>"That's more than forty-eight hours," he said, laughing.  "You're
flattering me now."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Camilla, "I don't see why everybody that knows
her isn't mad about Ailsa Paige.  She has <em>such</em> high principles,
such ideals, such wonderful aspirations&mdash;"  She clasped her hands
sentimentally: "At times, Phil, she seems too ethereal, scarcely
of earth&mdash;and yet I breakfasted with her and she ate twice as
much as I did.  <em>How</em> does she keep that glorious figure!"</p>

<p>Plumpness was the bane and terror of Camilla's life.  Her smooth,
suave white skin was glossy and tight; distracting curves, entrancing
contours characterised her now; but her full red lips fairly trembled
as she gazed at her parents' portraits in her bedroom, for they
had both been of a florid texture and full habit; and she had
now long refused sugar and the comforts of sweetmeats dear to
the palate of her age and sex.  And mostly was this self-denial
practised for the sake of a young and unobservant friend, one
Stephen Craig, who had so far evinced no unusual inclination for
her, or for anything except cigars and masculine society of his
own age and condition.</p>

<p>She managed to get Philip Berkley to talk about Stephen, which
ingenuity soothed her.  But Philip was becoming bored, and he
presently escaped to retrace his steps up Broadway, up Fifth Avenue,
and then west to the exceedingly modest lodgings whither fate
and misfortune had wafted him.</p>

<p>On the way he passed Colonel Arran's big double house with a
sullen and sidelong scowl, and continued onward with a shrug. 
But he smiled no more to himself.</p>

<p>Burgess was in the room, cross-legged on the floor, ironing out
his master's best coat.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you about," said Philip ungraciously.  "Get
up. I need what floor I've got to stand on."</p>

<p>Burgess obediently laid the board and the coat on a trunk and
continued ironing; and Philip scowled at him askance.</p>

<p>"Why don't you enlist?" he said.  "Every car-driver, stage-driver,
hackman, and racing-tout can become major-generals if they yell
loud enough."</p>

<p>Burgess continued ironing, then stole a glance at his master.</p>

<p>"Are you thinking of enlisting, sir?"</p>

<p>"No; I can't pass the examination for lung power.  By the way,"
he added, laughing, "I overlooked the impudence of your question,
too. But now is your time, Burgess.  If I wanted you I'd have
to put up with your insolence, I suppose."</p>

<p>"But you don't want me, sir."</p>

<p>"Which restrains you," said Philip, laughing.  "Oh, go on, my
friend.  Don't say 'sir' to me; it's a badge of servitude pasted
onto the vernacular.  Say 'Hi!' if you like."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Hell!  I say don't behave like a servant to me."</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> a servant, sir."</p>

<p>"You're not mine."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I am.  Will you wear this coat this evening, sir?"</p>

<p>"God knows," said the young fellow, sitting down and gazing about
at the melancholy poverty of the place. . . .  "Is there any of
that corn whisky?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Damn it, you said there was this morning!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I didn't."</p>

<p>The man lied placidly; the master looked at him, then laughed.</p>

<p>"Poor old Burgess," he said aloud as though to himself; "there
wasn't a skinful in that bottle.  Well, I can't get drunk, I can't
lie here and count from six to midnight and keep my sanity, I
can't smoke&mdash;you rascal, where's my cigar?  And I certainly can't
go out anywhere because I haven't any money."</p>

<p>"You might take the air on the avenue, sir.  Your clothes are
in order."</p>

<p>"Poor Burgess!  That was your amusement, wasn't it?&mdash;to see me
go out discreetly perfumed, in fine linen and purple, brave as
the best of them in club and hall, in ballroom and supper room,
and in every lesser hell from Crystal Palace cinders to Canal.</p>

<p>"Poor Burgess!  Even the seventy-five pretty waitresses at the
Gaities would turn up their seventy-five retrousse noses at a
man with pockets as empty as mine."</p>

<p>"Your clothes are fashionable.  So is your figger, sir."</p>

<p>"That settles it?" protested the young fellow, weak with laughter.
"Burgess, <em>don't</em> go!  Don't <em>ever</em> go!  I do need
you.  Oh I <em>do</em> want you, Burgess.  Because there never
will be anybody exactly like you, and I've only one life in which
to observe you, study you, and mentally digest you.  You <em>won't</em>
go, will you?"</p>

<p>"No sir," said Burgess with dignity.</p>
