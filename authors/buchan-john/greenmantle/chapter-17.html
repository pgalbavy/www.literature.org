<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>From that moment I date the beginning of my madness. Suddenly
I forgot all cares and difficulties of the present and future
and became foolishly light-hearted. We were rushing towards the
great battle where men were busy at my proper trade. I realized
how much I had loathed the lonely days in Germany, and still more
the dawdling week in Constantinople. Now I was clear of it all,
and bound for the clash of armies. It didn’t trouble me that we
were on the wrong side of the battle line. I had a sort of instinct
that the darker and wilder things grew the better chance for us.</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said Blenkiron, bending over me, "that this joy-ride
is going to come to an untimely end pretty soon. Peter’s right.
That young man will set the telegraph going, and we’ll be held
up at the next township."</p>

<p>"He’s got to get to a telegraph office first," I answered. "That’s
where we have the pull on him. He’s welcome to the screws we left
behind, and if he finds an operator before the evening I’m the
worst kind of a Dutchman. I’m going to break all the rules and
bucket this car for what she’s worth. Don’t you see that the nearer
we get to Erzerum the safer we are?"</p>

<p>"I don’t follow," he said slowly. "At Erzerum I reckon they’ll
be waiting for us with the handcuffs. Why in thunder couldn’t
those hairy ragamuffins keep the little cuss safe? Your record’s
a bit too precipitous, Major, for the most innocent-minded military
boss."</p>

<p>"Do you remember what you said about the Germans being open to
bluff? Well, I’m going to put up the steepest sort of bluff. Of
course they’ll stop us. Rasta will do his damnedest. But remember
that he and his friends are not very popular with the Germans,
and Madame von Einem is. We’re her proteges, and the bigger the
German swell I get before the safer I’ll feel. We’ve got our passports
and our orders, and he’ll be a bold man that will stop us once
we get into the German zone. Therefore I’m going to hurry as fast
as God will let me."</p>

<p>It was a ride that deserved to have an epic written about it.
The car was good, and I handled her well, though I say it who
shouldn’t. The road in that big central plain was fair, and often
I knocked fifty miles an hour out of her. We passed troops by
a circuit over the veld, where we took some awful risks, and once
we skidded by some transport with our off wheels almost over the
lip of a ravine. We went through the narrow streets of Siwas like
a fire-engine, while I shouted out in German that we carried despatches
for headquarters. We shot out of drizzling rain into brief spells
of winter sunshine, and then into a snow blizzard which all but
whipped the skin from our faces. And always before us the long
road unrolled, with somewhere at the end of it two armies clinched
in a death-grapple.</p>

<p>That night we looked for no lodging. We ate a sort of meal in
the car with the hood up, and felt our way on in the darkness,
for the headlights were in perfect order. Then we turned off the
road for four hours’ sleep, and I had a go at the map. Before
dawn we started again, and came over a pass into the vale of a
big river. The winter dawn showed its gleaming stretches, ice-bound
among the sprinkled meadows. I called to Blenkiron:</p>

<p>"I believe that river is the Euphrates," I said.</p>

<p>"So," he said, acutely interested. "Then that’s the waters of
Babylon. Great snakes, that I should have lived to see the fields
where King Nebuchadnezzar grazed! Do you know the name of that
big hill, Major?"</p>

<p>"Ararat, as like as not," I cried, and he believed me.</p>

<p>We were among the hills now, great, rocky, black slopes, and,
seen through side glens, a hinterland of snowy peaks. I remember
I kept looking for the <em>castrol</em> I had seen in my dream.
The thing had never left off haunting me, and I was pretty clear
now that it did not belong to my South African memories. I am
not a superstitious man, but the way that little <em>kranz</em>
clung to my mind made me think it was a warning sent by Providence.
I was pretty certain that when I clapped eyes on it I would be
in for bad trouble.</p>

<p>All morning we travelled up that broad vale, and just before
noon it spread out wider, the road dipped to the water’s edge,
and I saw before me the white roofs of a town. The snow was deep
now, and lay down to the riverside, but the sky had cleared, and
against a space of blue heaven some peaks to the south rose glittering
like jewels. The arches of a bridge, spanning two forks of the
stream, showed in front, and as I slowed down at the bend a sentry’s
challenge rang out from a block-house. We had reached the fortress
of Erzingjan, the headquarters of a Turkish corps and the gate
of Armenia.</p>

<p>I showed the man our passports, but he did not salute and let
us move on. He called another fellow from the guardhouse, who
motioned us to keep pace with him as he stumped down a side lane.
At the other end was a big barracks with sentries outside. The
man spoke to us in Turkish, which Hussin interpreted. There was
somebody in that barracks who wanted badly to see us.</p>

<p>"By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept," quoted Blenkiron
softly. "I fear, Major, we’ll soon be remembering Zion."</p>

<p>I tried to persuade myself that this was merely the red tape
of a frontier fortress, but I had an instinct that difficulties
were in store for us. If Rasta had started wiring I was prepared
to put up the brazenest bluff, for we were still eighty miles
from Erzerum, and at all costs we were going to be landed there
before night.</p>

<p>A fussy staff-officer met us at the door. At the sight of us
he cried to a friend to come and look.</p>

<p>"Here are the birds safe. A fat man and two lean ones and a savage
who looks like a Kurd. Call the guard and march them off. There’s
no doubt about their identity."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Sir," I said, "but we have no time to spare and we’d
like to be in Erzerum before the dark. I would beg you to get
through any formalities as soon as possible. This man," and I
pointed to the sentry, "has our passports."</p>

<p>"Compose yourself," he said impudently; "you’re not going on
just yet, and when you do it won’t be in a stolen car." He took
the passports and fingered them casually. Then something he saw
there made him cock his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Where did you steal these?" he asked, but with less assurance
in his tone.</p>

<p>I spoke very gently. "You seem to be the victim of a mistake,
sir. These are our papers. We are under orders to report ourselves
at Erzerum without an hour’s delay. Whoever hinders us will have
to answer to General von Liman. We will be obliged if you will
conduct us at once to the Governor."</p>

<p>"You can’t see General Posselt," he said; "this is my business.
I have a wire from Siwas that four men stole a car belonging to
one of Enver Damad’s staff. It describes you all, and says that
two of you are notorious spies wanted by the Imperial Government.
What have you to say to that?"</p>

<p>"Only that it is rubbish. My good Sir, you have seen our passes.
Our errand is not to be cried on the housetops, but five minutes
with General Posselt will make things clear. You will be exceedingly
sorry for it if you delay another minute."</p>

<p>He was impressed in spite of himself, and after pulling his moustache
turned on his heel and left us. Presently he came back and said
very gruffly that the Governor would see us. We followed him along
a corridor into a big room looking out on the river, where an
oldish fellow sat in an arm-chair by a stove, writing letters
with a fountain pen.</p>

<p>This was Posselt, who had been Governor of Erzerum till he fell
sick and Ahmed Fevzi took his place. He had a peevish mouth and
big blue pouches below his eyes. He was supposed to be a good
engineer and to have made Erzerum impregnable, but the look on
his face gave me the impression that his reputation at the moment
was a bit unstable.</p>

<p>The staff-officer spoke to him in an undertone.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know," he said testily. "Are these the men? They
look a pretty lot of scoundrels. What’s that you say? They deny
it. But they’ve got the car. They can’t deny that. Here, you,"
and he fixed on Blenkiron, "who the devil are you?"</p>

<p>Blenkiron smiled sleepily at him, not understanding one word,
and I took up the parable.</p>

<p>"Our passports, Sir, give our credentials," I said. He glanced
through them, and his face lengthened.</p>

<p>"They’re right enough. But what about this story of stealing
a car?"</p>

<p>"It is quite true," I said, "but I would prefer to use a pleasanter
word. You will see from our papers that every authority on the
road is directed to give us the best transport. Our own car broke
down, and after a long delay we got some wretched horses. It is
vitally important that we should be in Erzerum without delay,
so I took the liberty of appropriating an empty car we found outside
an inn. I am sorry for the discomfort of the owners, but our business
was too grave to wait."</p>

<p>"But the telegram says you are notorious spies!"</p>

<p>I smiled. "Who sent the telegram?"</p>

<p>"I see no reason why I shouldn’t give you his name. It was Rasta
Bey. You’ve picked an awkward fellow to make an enemy of."</p>

<p>I did not smile but laughed. "Rasta!" I cried. "He’s one of Enver’s
satellites. That explains many things. I should like a word with
you alone, Sir."</p>

<p>He nodded to the staff-officer, and when he had gone I put on
my most Bible face and looked as important as a provincial mayor
at a royal visit.</p>

<p>"I can speak freely," I said, "for I am speaking to a soldier
of Germany. There is no love lost between Enver and those I serve.
I need not tell you that. This Rasta thought he had found a chance
of delaying us, so he invents this trash about spies. Those Comitadjis
have spies on the brain ... Especially he hates Frau von Einem."</p>

<p>He jumped at the name.</p>

<p>"You have orders from her?" he asked, in a respectful tone.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I answered, "and those orders will not wait."</p>

<p>He got up and walked to a table, whence he turned a puzzled face
on me. "I’m torn in two between the Turks and my own countrymen.
If I please one I offend the other, and the result is a damnable
confusion. You can go on to Erzerum, but I shall send a man with
you to see that you report to headquarters there. I’m sorry, gentlemen,
but I’m obliged to take no chances in this business. Rasta’s got
a grievance against you, but you can easily hide behind the lady’s
skirts. She passed through this town two days ago."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later we were coasting through the slush of the narrow
streets with a stolid German lieutenant sitting beside me.</p>

<p>The afternoon was one of those rare days when in the pauses of
snow you have a spell of weather as mild as May. I remembered
several like it during our winter’s training in Hampshire. The
road was a fine one, well engineered, and well kept too, considering
the amount of traffic. We were little delayed, for it was sufficiently
broad to let us pass troops and transport without slackening pace.
The fellow at my side was good-humoured enough, but his presence
naturally put the lid on our conversation. I didn’t want to talk,
however. I was trying to piece together a plan, and making very
little of it, for I had nothing to go upon. We must find Hilda
von Einem and Sandy, and between us we must wreck the Greenmantle
business. That done, it didn’t matter so much what happened to
us. As I reasoned it out, the Turks must be in a bad way, and,
unless they got a fillip from Greenmantle, would crumple up before
the Russians. In the rout I hoped we might get a chance to change
our sides. But it was no good looking so far forward; the first
thing was to get to Sandy.</p>

<p>Now I was still in the mood of reckless bravado which I had got
from bagging the car. I did not realize how thin our story was,
and how easily Rasta might have a big graft at headquarters. If
I had, I would have shot out the German lieutenant long before
we got to Erzerum, and found some way of getting mixed up in the
ruck of the population. Hussin could have helped me to that. I
was getting so confident since our interview with Posselt that
I thought I could bluff the whole outfit.</p>

<p>But my main business that afternoon was pure nonsense. I was
trying to find my little hill. At every turn of the road I expected
to see the <em>castrol</em> before us. You must know that ever
since I could stand I have been crazy about high mountains. My
father took me to Basutoland when I was a boy, and I reckon I
have scrambled over almost every bit of upland south of the Zambesi,
from the Hottentots Holland to the Zoutpansberg, and from the
ugly yellow kopjes of Damaraland to the noble cliffs of Mont aux
Sources. One of the things I had looked forward to in coming home
was the chance of climbing the Alps. But now I was among peaks
that I fancied were bigger than the Alps, and I could hardly keep
my eyes on the road. I was pretty certain that my <em>castrol</em>
was among them, for that dream had taken an almighty hold on my
mind. Funnily enough, I was ceasing to think it a place of evil
omen, for one soon forgets the atmosphere of nightmare. But I
was convinced that it was a thing I was destined to see, and to
see pretty soon.</p>

<p>Darkness fell when we were some miles short of the city, and
the last part was difficult driving. On both sides of the road
transport and engineers’ stores were parked, and some of it strayed
into the highway. I noticed lots of small details—machine-gun
detachments, signalling parties, squads of stretcher-bearers—which
mean the fringe of an army, and as soon as the night began the
white fingers of searchlights began to grope in the skies.</p>

<p>And then, above the hum of the roadside, rose the voice of the
great guns. The shells were bursting four or five miles away,
and the guns must have been as many more distant. But in that
upland pocket of plain in the frosty night they sounded most intimately
near. They kept up their solemn litany, with a minute’s interval
between each—no <em>rafale</em> which rumbles like a drum, but
the steady persistence of artillery exactly ranged on a target.
I judged they must be bombarding the outer forts, and once there
came a loud explosion and a red glare as if a magazine had suffered.</p>

<p>It was a sound I had not heard for five months, and it fairly
crazed me. I remembered how I had first heard it on the ridge
before Laventie. Then I had been half-afraid, half-solemnized,
but every nerve had been quickened. Then it had been the new thing
in my life that held me breathless with anticipation; now it was
the old thing, the thing I had shared with so many good fellows,
my proper work, and the only task for a man. At the sound of the
guns I felt that I was moving in natural air once more. I felt
that I was coming home.</p>

<p>We were stopped at a long line of ramparts, and a German sergeant
stared at us till he saw the lieutenant beside me, when he saluted
and we passed on. Almost at once we dipped into narrow twisting
streets, choked with soldiers, where it was hard business to steer.
There were few lights—only now and then the flare of a torch which
showed the grey stone houses, with every window latticed and shuttered.
I had put out my headlights and had only side lamps, so we had
to pick our way gingerly through the labyrinth. I hoped we would
strike Sandy’s quarters soon, for we were all pretty empty, and
a frost had set in which made our thick coats seem as thin as
paper.</p>

<p>The lieutenant did the guiding. We had to present our passports,
and I anticipated no more difficulty than in landing from the
boat at Boulogne. But I wanted to get it over, for my hunger pinched
me and it was fearsome cold. Still the guns went on, like hounds
baying before a quarry. The city was out of range, but there were
strange lights on the ridge to the east.</p>

<p>At last we reached our goal and marched through a fine old carved
archway into a courtyard, and thence into a draughty hall.</p>

<p>"You must see the <em>Sektionschef</em>," said our guide. I looked
round to see if we were all there, and noticed that Hussin had
disappeared. It did not matter, for he was not on the passports.</p>

<p>We followed as we were directed through an open door. There was
a man standing with his back towards us looking at a wall map,
a very big man with a neck that bulged over his collar. I would
have known that neck among a million. At the sight of it I made
a half-turn to bolt back. It was too late, for the door had closed
behind us and there were two armed sentries beside it.</p>

<p>The man slewed round and looked into my eyes. I had a despairing
hope that I might bluff it out, for I was in different clothes
and had shaved my beard. But you cannot spend ten minutes in a
death-grapple without your adversary getting to know you.</p>

<p>He went very pale, then recollected himself and twisted his features
into the old grin.</p>

<p>"So," he said, "the little Dutchmen! We meet after many days."</p>

<p>It was no good lying or saying anything. I shut my teeth and
waited.</p>

<p>"And you, Herr Blenkiron? I never liked the look of you. You
babbled too much, like all your damned Americans."</p>

<p>"I guess your personal dislikes haven’t got anything to do with
the matter," said Blenkiron, calmly. "If you’re the boss here,
I’ll thank you to cast your eye over these passports, for we can’t
stand waiting for ever."</p>

<p>This fairly angered him. "I’ll teach you manners," he cried,
and took a step forward to reach for Blenkiron’s shoulder—the
game he had twice played with me.</p>

<p>Blenkiron never took his hands from his coat pockets. "Keep your
distance," he drawled in a new voice. "I’ve got you covered, and
I’ll make a hole in your bullet head if you lay a hand on me."</p>

<p>With an effort Stumm recovered himself. He rang a bell and fell
to smiling. An orderly appeared to whom he spoke in Turkish, and
presently a file of soldiers entered the room.</p>

<p>"I’m going to have you disarmed, gentlemen," he said. "We can
conduct our conversation more pleasantly without pistols."</p>

<p>It was idle to resist. We surrendered our arms, Peter almost
in tears with vexation. Stumm swung his legs over a chair, rested
his chin on the back and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Your game is up, you know," he said. "These fools of Turkish
police said the Dutchmen were dead, but I had the happier inspiration.
I believed the good God had spared them for me. When I got Rasta’s
telegram I was certain, for your doings reminded me of a little
trick you once played me on the Schwandorf road. But I didn’t
think to find this plump old partridge," and he smiled at Blenkiron.
"Two eminent American engineers and their servant bound for Mesopotamia
on business of high Government importance! It was a good lie;
but if I had been in Constantinople it would have had a short
life. Rasta and his friends are no concern of mine. You can trick
them as you please. But you have attempted to win the confidence
of a certain lady, and her interests are mine. Likewise you have
offended me, and I do not forgive. By God," he cried, his voice
growing shrill with passion, "by the time I have done with you
your mothers in their graves will weep that they ever bore you!"</p>

<p>It was Blenkiron who spoke. His voice was as level as the chairman’s
of a bogus company, and it fell on that turbid atmosphere like
acid on grease.</p>

<p>"I don’t take no stock in high-falutin’. If you’re trying to
scare me by that dime-novel talk I guess you’ve hit the wrong
man. You’re like the sweep that stuck in the chimney, a bit too
big for your job. I reckon you’ve a talent for romance that’s
just wasted in soldiering. But if you’re going to play any ugly
games on me I’d like you to know that I’m an American citizen,
and pretty well considered in my own country and in yours, and
you’ll sweat blood for it later. That’s a fair warning, Colonel
Stumm."</p>

<p>I don’t know what Stumm’s plans were, but that speech of Blenkiron’s
put into his mind just the needed amount of uncertainty. You see,
he had Peter and me right enough, but he hadn’t properly connected
Blenkiron with us, and was afraid either to hit out at all three,
or to let Blenkiron go. It was lucky for us that the American
had cut such a dash in the Fatherland.</p>

<p>"There is no hurry," he said blandly. "We shall have long happy
hours together. I’m going to take you all home with me, for I
am a hospitable soul. You will be safer with me than in the town
gaol, for it’s a trifle draughty. It lets things in, and it might
let things out."</p>

<p>Again he gave an order, and we were marched out, each with a
soldier at his elbow. The three of us were bundled into the back
seat of the car, while two men sat before us with their rifles
between their knees, one got up behind on the baggage rack, and
one sat beside Stumm’s chauffeur. Packed like sardines we moved
into the bleak streets, above which the stars twinkled in ribbons
of sky.</p>

<p>Hussin had disappeared from the face of the earth, and quite
right too. He was a good fellow, but he had no call to mix himself
up in our troubles.</p>
