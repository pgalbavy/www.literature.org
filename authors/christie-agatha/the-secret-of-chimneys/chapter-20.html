<p>Anthony said nothing. He continued to stare out of the window.
Superintendent Battle looked for some time at his motionless back.</p>

<p>"Well, good night, sir," he said at last, and moved to the door.</p>

<p>Anthony stirred.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Battle."</p>

<p>The superintendent halted obediently. Anthony left the window.
He drew out a cigarette from his case and lighted it. Then, between
two puffs of smoke, he said:</p>

<p>"You seem very interested in this business at Staines?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t go as far as that, sir. It’s unusual, that’s all."</p>

<p>"Do you think the man was shot where he was found, or do you
think he was killed elsewhere and the body brought to that particular
spot afterwards?"</p>

<p>"I think he was shot somewhere else, and the body brought there
in a car."</p>

<p>"I think so too," said Anthony.</p>

<p>Something in the emphasis of his tone made the detective look
up sharply.</p>

<p>"Any ideas of your own, sir? Do you know who brought him there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Anthony. "I did."</p>

<p>He was a little annoyed at the absolutely unruffled calm preserved
by the other.</p>

<p>"I must say you take these shocks very well, Battle," he remarked.</p>

<p>"‘Never display emotion.’ That was a rule that was given to me
once, and I’ve found it very useful."</p>

<p>"You live up to it, certainly," said Anthony. "I can’t say I’ve
ever seen you ruffled. Well, do you want to hear the whole story?"</p>

<p>"If you please, Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>Anthony pulled up two of the chairs, both men sat down, and Anthony
recounted the events of the preceding Thursday night.</p>

<p>Battle listened immovably. There was a far-off twinkle in his
eyes as Anthony finished.</p>

<p>"You know, sir," he said, "You’ll get into trouble one of these
days."</p>

<p>"Then, for the second time, I’m not to be taken into custody?"</p>

<p>"We always like to give a man plenty of rope," said Superintendent
Battle.</p>

<p>"Very delicately put," said Anthony. "Without unduly stressing
the end of the proverb."</p>

<p>"What I can’t quite make out, sir," said Battle, "is why you
decided to come across with this now?"</p>

<p>"It’s rather difficult to explain," said Anthony. "You see, Battle,
I’ve come to have really a very high opinion of your abilities.
When the moment comes, you’re always there. Look at to-night.
And it occurred to me that, in withholding this knowledge of mine,
I was seriously cramping your style. You deserve to have access
to all the facts. I’ve done what I could, and up to now I’ve made
a mess of things. Until to-night, I couldn’t speak for Mrs. Revel’s
sake. But now that those letters have been definitely proved to
have nothing whatever to do with her, any idea of her complicity
becomes absurd. Perhaps I advised her badly in the first place,
but it struck me that her statement of having paid this man money
to suppress the letters, simply as a whim, might take a bit of
believing."</p>

<p>"It might, by a jury," agreed Battle. "Juries never have any
imagination."</p>

<p>"But you accept it quite easily?" said Anthony, looking curiously
at him.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, Mr. Cade, most of my work has lain amongst these
people. What they call the upper classes, I mean. You see, the
majority of people are always wondering what the neighbours will
think. But tramps and aristocrats don’t—they just do the first
thing that comes into their heads, and they don’t bother to think
what anyone thinks of them. I’m not meaning just the idle rich,
the people who give big parties, and so on, I mean those that
have had it born and bred in them for generations that nobody
else’s opinion counts but their own. I’ve always found the upper
classes the same—fearless, truthful and sometimes extraordinarily
foolish."</p>

<p>"This is a very interesting lecture, Battle. I suppose you’ll
be writing your Reminiscences one of these days. They ought to
be worth reading too."</p>

<p>The detective acknowledged the suggestion with a smile, but said
nothing.</p>

<p>"I’d rather like to ask you one question," continued Anthony.
"Did you connect me at all with the Staines affair? I fancied,
from your manner, that you did."</p>

<p>"Quite right. I had a hunch that way. But nothing definite to
go upon. Your manner was very good, if I may say so, Mr. Cade.
You never overdid the carelessness."</p>

<p>"I’m glad of that," said Anthony. "I’ve a feeling that ever since
I met you you’ve been laying little traps for me. On the whole
I’ve managed to avoid falling into them, but the strain has been
acute."</p>

<p>Battle smiled grimly.</p>

<p>"That’s how you get a crook in the end, sir. Keep him on the
run, to and fro, turning and twisting. Sooner or later, his nerve
goes, and you’ve got him."</p>

<p>"You’re a cheerful fellow, Battle. When will you get me, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of rope, sir," quoted the superintendent, "plenty of
rope."</p>

<p>"In the meantime," said Anthony, "I am still the amateur assistant?"</p>

<p>"That’s it, Mr. Cade."</p>

<p>"Watson to your Sherlock, in fact?"</p>

<p>"Detective stories are mostly bunkum," said Battle unemotionally.
"But they amuse people," he added, as an afterthought. "And they’re
useful sometimes."</p>

<p>"In what way?" asked Anthony curiously.</p>

<p>"They encourage the universal idea that the police are stupid.
When we get an amateur crime, such as a murder, that’s very useful
indeed."</p>

<p>Anthony looked at him for some minutes in silence. Battle sat
quite still, blinking now and then, with no expression whatsoever
on his square placid face. Presently he rose.</p>

<p>"Not much good going to bed now," he observed. "As soon as he’s
up, I want to have a few words with his lordship. Anyone who wants
to leave the house can do so now. At the same time I should be
much obliged to his lordship if he’ll extend an informal invitation
to his guests to stay on. You’ll accept it, sir, if you please,
and Mrs. Revel also."</p>

<p>"Have you ever found the revolver?" asked Anthony suddenly.</p>

<p>"You mean the one Prince Michael was shot with? No, I haven’t.
Yet it must be in the house or grounds. I’ll take a hint from
you, Mr. Cade, and send some boys up bird’s-nesting. If I could
get hold of the revolver, we might get forward a bit. That, and
the bundle of letters. You say that a letter with the heading,
Chimneys, was amongst them? Depend upon it that was the last one
written. The instructions for finding the diamond are written
in code in that letter."</p>

<p>"What’s your theory of the killing of Giuseppe?" asked Anthony.</p>

<p>"I should say he was a regular thief, and that he was got hold
of, either by King Victor or by the Comrades of the Red Hand,
and employed by them. I shouldn’t wonder at all if the Comrades
and King Victor aren’t working together. The organization has
plenty of money and power, but it isn’t very strong in brains.
Giuseppe’s task was to steal the Memoirs—they couldn’t have known
that you had the letters—it’s a very odd coincidence that you
should have, by the way."</p>

<p>"I know," said Anthony. "It’s amazing when you come to think
of it."</p>

<p>"Giuseppe gets hold of the letters instead. Is at first vastly
chagrined. Then sees the cutting from the paper and has the brilliant
idea of turning them to account on his own by blackmailing the
lady. He has, of course, no idea of their real significance. The
Comrades find out what he is doing, believe that he is deliberately
double crossing them, and decree his death. They’re very fond
of executing traitors. It has a picturesque element which seems
to appeal to them. What I can’t quite make out is the revolver
with ‘Virginia’ engraved upon it. There’s too much finesse about
that for the Comrades. As a rule, they enjoy plastering their
Red Hand sign about—in order to strike terror into other would-be
traitors. No, it looks to me as though King Victor had stepped
in there. But what his motive was, I don’t know. It looks like
a very deliberate attempt to saddle Mrs. Revel with the murder,
and, on the surface, there doesn’t seem any particular point in
that."</p>

<p>"I had a theory," said Anthony. "But it didn’t work out according
to plan."</p>

<p>He told Battle of Virginia’s recognition of Michael. Battle nodded
his head.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, no doubt as to his identity. By the way, that old Baron
has a very high opinion of you. He speaks of you in most enthusiastic
terms."</p>

<p>"That’s very kind of him," said Anthony. "Especially as I’ve
given him full warning that I mean to do my utmost to get hold
of the missing Memoirs before Wednesday next."</p>

<p>"You’ll have a job to do that," said Battle.</p>

<p>"Y—es. You think so? I suppose King Victor and Co. have got the
letters."</p>

<p>Battle nodded.</p>

<p>"Pinched them off Giuseppe that day in Pont Street. Prettily
planned piece of work, that. Yes, they’ve got ’em all right, and
they’ve decoded them, and they know where to look."</p>

<p>Both men were on the point of passing out of the room.</p>

<p>"In here?" said Anthony, jerking his head back.</p>

<p>"Exactly, in here. But they haven’t found the prize yet, and
they’re going to run a pretty risk trying to get it."</p>

<p>"I suppose," said Anthony, "that you’ve got a plan in that subtle
head of yours?"</p>

<p>Battle returned no answer. He looked particularly stolid and
unintelligent. Then, very slowly, he winked.</p>

<p>"Want my help?" asked Anthony.</p>

<p>"I do. And I shall want some one else’s."</p>

<p>"Who is that?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Revel’s. You may not have noticed it, Mr. Cade, but she’s
a lady who has a particularly beguiling way with her."</p>

<p>"I’ve noticed it all right," said Anthony.</p>

<p>He glanced at his watch.</p>

<p>"I’m inclined to agree with you about bed, Battle. A dip in the
lake and a hearty breakfast will be far more to the point."</p>

<p>He ran lightly upstairs to his bedroom. Whistling to himself,
he discarded his evening clothes, and picked up a dressing-gown
and a bath towel.</p>

<p>Then suddenly he stopped dead in front of the dressing-table,
staring at the object that reposed demurely in front of the looking-glass.</p>

<p>For a moment he could not believe his eyes. He took it up, examined
it closely. Yes, there was no mistake.</p>

<p>It was the bundle of letters signed Virginia Revel. They were
intact. Not one was missing.</p>

<p>Anthony dropped into a chair, the letters in his hand.</p>

<p>"My brain must be cracking," he murmured. "I can’t understand
a quarter of what is going on in this house. Why should the letters
reappear like a damned conjuring trick? Who put them on my dressing-table?
Why?"</p>

<p>And to all these very pertinent questions he could find no satisfactory
reply.</p>
