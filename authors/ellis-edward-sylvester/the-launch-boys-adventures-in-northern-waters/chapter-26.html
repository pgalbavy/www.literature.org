<p>She looked sharply at him through her bright blue eyes.</p>

<p>"Are ye saaking to make me belave ye are from Ireland?"</p>

<p>"Sartinly &mdash;Mike Murphy, from the town of Tipperary, County
of Tipperary, at your sarvice," and he bowed again.</p>

<p>"Arrah, poor Ireland, how many wrongs are heaped upon ye! I was
sure from yer accint that ye were a Dutchman or Frinch."</p>

<p>"May I ask yer name, me leddy?"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Maggie McCaffry, and me husband is Tam that is working
for Mr. Burns at Beartown."</p>

<p>Mike clasped his hands and with a glowing expression stepped
forward.</p>

<p>"I knowed it! I knowed it!" he exclaimed, as if overrunning with
joy.</p>

<p>"Knowed phwat?"</p>

<p>"That ye were my mither's fourth cousin that lift Tipperary fur
Noo York six years ago, but by some mistake landed in Dublin jail&mdash;bad
cess to them as made the same mistake!"</p>

<p>"It's bad enough fur ye to be born in the same counthry wid mesilf,
but I war-r-n ye to make no claim to relationship. There's some
things a respictable leddy can't stand."</p>

<p>"Did ye not almost break me heart by thinking I was a Dutchman?"
asked Mike reprovingly.</p>

<p>"I'll make the same roight by axing the pardon of ivery Dutchman
I maats for the rist of me born days. 'Twas har-r-d on the poor
haythen."</p>

<p>"Aunt Maggie, I'll give ye all me wealth if ye'll consint to
let me dry mesilf in front of yer fire."</p>

<p>"Arrah, now, what are ye saying? Five cints is no object to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then, in spite of an effort to prevent it, Mike's teeth
chattered. Now that he had ceased walking he quickly became chilled.
The woman noticed it and her warm sympathy instantly welled up.</p>

<p>"'Tis a shame that I kipt ye talking nonsense wid me while ye
was shivering. Do ye walk straight into the house and war-r-m
yersilf till I come, which will be in a jiffy whin I have the
rest of me clothes hung out. And if ye're hungry ye shall have
food."</p>

<p>"I thank ye, aunty, but I am not in need of that."</p>

<p>Two small wooden steps were in front of the only door on that
side of the neat little cottage. He pressed his thumb on the latch,
pushed open the door and the next instant faced one of the greatest
surprises of his life.</p>

<p>The lower floor consisted of two rooms, a kitchen and a general
living room. The fire in the former would have been enough for
the interior, but for the fact that a visitor had preceded Mike,
and because of his presence a roaring fire was burning on the
hearth. In front of this sat a young man leaning back in a rocking
chair, with a bandaged leg resting on a pillow laid upon a second
chair in front of him. He was smoking a cigarette, and despite
the fact that something ailed him, looked quite comfortable.</p>

<p>As the door opened, his eyes met those of Mike Murphy, who halted
with one foot over the threshold, started and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Can I belave what me eyes tell me! Is it <em>yersilf</em>?"</p>

<p>The young man sitting before him, smoking and nursing his injured
limb, was Orestes Noxon, whom Mike chased away from the Beartown
post office the night before, and who received a part of the charge
from the shotgun of Gerald Buxton.</p>

<p>The face of the injured youth flushed and he laughed nervously,
but with amazing coolness answered:</p>

<p>"I guess you don't need spectacles. You've got the best of me;
I'm down and you're up."</p>

<p>"There's an old account to be squared atween us, but that can
rist till ye become yersilf. Be the same token, are ye much hurt?"</p>

<p>Mike's Irish sympathy immediately went out to the fellow, who
certainly was at his mercy.</p>

<p>"I can't say I am. But your clothing is wet. I heard a part of
your talk with Mrs. McCaffry &mdash;God bless her splendid soul!&mdash;so
suppose you come closer where you will be in front of the fire
and can dry yourself, and we'll get on better."</p>

<p>It was good advice and Mike acted upon it. Standing with his
back to the blaze, he looked down in the face of the criminal
whose self-possession he could not help admiring.</p>

<p>"You remember our little foot race from the back of the Beartown
post office?" said Noxon, as if referring to an incident in which
he felt no particular interest.</p>

<p>"I do, but I niver won a prize at running and ye give me the
slip."</p>

<p>"Only to get in front of that beefeater with a shotgun. Why didn't
you fire when you were chasing and threatening me?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't have touched off that busted gun any more than I
could have fired a broom handle."</p>

<p>"I made the mistake of thinking the other fellow would be equally
forbearing and kept on running, till all at once, bang! he let
drive. I caught a good part of the charge in that leg below the
knee. It didn't hurt much at first, and after managing to get
hold of his gun I made him dance for me. It would have killed
you to see him," and at the recollection the young man laughed
hard.</p>

<p>"His boy Jim obsarved it all and told us and we laughed," said
Mike, with a grin. "The sight must have been very insthructive."</p>

<p>"It was, to that old codger, who won't get over his lesson for
a month. Well, as the gun wasn't of any use to me I threw it away
and started to find my friends and the boat we came on. By and
by my leg began to hurt, I suppose from walking so much and a
tumble I got by catching my foot in the root of a tree. I sat
down to rest awhile and when I got up it hurt so badly that I
thought it was all up with me. You know it was night, and somehow
I had gone astray in the infernal pine woods. The wound was bleeding,
and I sat down again intending to wait till morning. By and by
I heard a dog bark so near that I climbed to my feet again and
made by way to this house. McCaffry and his wife were asleep and
it took a good deal of banging and shouting for me to wake them.
But when they found out what was the matter they took me in, and
my own father and mother could not have been kinder."</p>

<p>"What did they do fur yer fut?"</p>

<p>"The good woman not only washed the wound, but, by the light
of the lamp which her husband held, picked out every one of the
shot that had been buried there and were making the trouble. Then
she bathed the hurt again and wrapped it about with the clean
linen, as you see for yourself. All that remains is for me to
keep quiet for a few days and nature will do the rest."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be well if I got a docther fur ye?"</p>

<p>Noxon looked up in the face of the Irish youth, who tried to
keep a grave countenance.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied the sufferer.</p>

<p>There was a world of significance in the words, and both understood.</p>

<p>Strange that these two who had never met before except as the
bitterest of enemies should talk now as comrades. Mike kept pinching
his clothing and turning every side to the blaze, thus drying
the garments quite rapidly. He was so interested in the story
of Noxon that he grew careless.</p>

<p>"I think I see smoke coming from behind you," finally said the
sitter.</p>

<p>Mike reached back to investigate and with a gasp snatched back
his fingers.</p>

<p>"I'm afire! Is there a well outside that I can dive into the
same?"</p>

<p>"Turn around; I can help you," said Noxon, laughing, dropping
his foot and sitting forward.</p>

<p>Together they quenched the twist of blaze which if left alone
would have played the mischief with Mike's garments.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking this is a little different, Mr. Noxon, from last
night."</p>

<p>"It is, and I hope it will always stay that way."</p>

<p>Mike was astonished and looked questioningly at the fellow.</p>

<p>"Phwat might ye be maaning?" he asked, lowering his voice.</p>

<p>Noxon tried to speak, but his voice broke. He snatched out his
handkerchief from the side pocket of his coat and pressed it to
his eyes. Then his breast heaved and he broke into sobbing.</p>

<p>The heart of Mike melted at the sight. He had never dreamed of
anything like this. Enmity and resentment gave way to an anguish
of sympathy for the fellow. He longed to say something comforting,
but could not think of a word, and remained mute. Very soon the
youth regained his self-control. Dropping his handkerchief in
his lap, and with eyes streaming, he exclaimed from the very depths
of his despair:</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't that man aim better and kill me! I'm not fit
to live! I'm the worst villain unhanged! I am lost&mdash;damned, and
a curse to those who love me!"</p>

<p>Mike pulled himself together sufficiently to reply:</p>

<p>"I don't think ye're quite all them things. Cheer up! cheer up,
old fellow!"</p>

<p>Noxon did not speak, but slowly swayed his head from side to
side, like one from whom all hope had departed. Mike drew a chair
beside him, and as tenderly as a mother lifted the white hand
from where it lay on the handkerchief, and held it in his own
warm grasp.</p>

<p>"Noxy, me bye, Mike Murphy is yer frind through thick and thin&mdash;don't
ye forget <em>that</em>&mdash;and I'm going to see ye through this
if I have to break a thrace in trying."</p>

<p>"<em>You!</em>" repeated the despairing one, looking up in Mike's
honest blue eyes. "No one can save a wretch like me. I'm not worth
saving!"</p>

<p>"Ye forget there's One to whom the same is aisy, me bye. Ye feel
down in the mouth jest now, as Jonah did respicting the whale,
but bimeby this fog will clear away and the sun will shine forth
again. I've been in some purty bad scrapes mesilf and He niver
desarted me. Why, it ain't two hours, since He raiched out His
hand, grabbed me by the neck and saved me from drowning. I tell
ye, Noxy, that He won't fail ye."</p>

<p>"But you never did what I have done."</p>

<p>The Irish youth bent his head as if recalling his past life.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I did, but I'm the meanest scamp that iver
lived&mdash;barring yersilf," he added, with the old twinkle in his
eyes. "Come, now, be a man and we'll have ye out of this scrape
as quick as I jumped awhile ago whin I awoke to the fact that
me trousers was afire."</p>

<p>Noxon actually smiled at the recollection.</p>

<p>"You call yourself a scamp. Why, you are an angel compared with
me&mdash;so is everybody! Kit Woodford and Graff Miller are a thousand
times better than I."</p>
