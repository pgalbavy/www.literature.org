<p>The sun was shining in heaven before men were able to get across
the Papple with ladders.  The bridge was gone.  But the flood had
abated, and the house, that leaned forwards as if it were making a
stiff bow to the stream, stood now in mud and wreckage, with a
great heap of fallen masonry and debris at the south-west corner.
Awful were the gaping mouths of rooms!</p>

<p>Inside, there was no sign of life.  But across-stream the gardener
had come to reconnoitre, and the cook appeared, thrilled with
curiosity.  She had escaped from the back door and up through the
larches to the high-road, when she saw the gipsy bound past the
house: thinking he was coming to murder somebody.  At the little
top gate she had found his cart standing.  The gardener had led the
horse away to the Red Lion up at Darley, when night had fallen.</p>

<p>This the men from Papplewick learned when at last they got across
the stream with ladders, and to the back of the house.  They were
nervous, fearing a collapse of the building, whose front was all
undermined and whose back was choked up.  They gazed with horror at
the silent shelves of the rector's rows of books, in his torn-open
study; at the big brass bedstead of Granny's room, the bed so deep
and comfortably made, but one brass leg of the bed-stead perched
tentatively over the torn void; at the wreckage of the maid's room
upstairs.  The housemaid and the cook wept.  Then a man climbed in
cautiously through a smashed kitchen window, into the jungle and
morass of the ground floor.  He found the body of the old woman: or
at least he saw her foot, in its flat black slipper, muddily
protruding from a mud-heap of debris.  And he fled.</p>

<p>The gardener said he was sure that Miss Yvette was not in the
house.  He had seen her and the gipsy swept away.  But the
policeman insisted on a search, and the Framley boys rushing up at
last, the ladders were roped together.  Then the whole party set up
a loud yell.  But without result.  No answer from within.</p>

<p>A ladder was up, Bob Framley climbed, smashed a window, and
clambered into Aunt Cissie's room.  The perfect homely familiarity
of everything terrified him like ghosts.  The house might go down
any minute.</p>

<p>They had just got the ladder up to the top floor, when men came
running from Darley, saying the old gipsy had been to the Red Lion
for the horse and cart, leaving word that his son had seen Yvette
at the top of the house.  But by that time the policeman was
smashing the window of Yvette's room.</p>

<p>Yvette, fast asleep, started from under the bed-clothes with a
scream, as the glass flew.  She clutched the sheets round her
nakedness.  The policeman uttered a startled yell, which he
converted into a cry of:  Miss Yvette!  Miss Yvette!  He turned
round on the ladder, and shouted to the faces below.</p>

<p>&quot;Miss Yvette's in bed! - in bed!&quot;</p>

<p>And he perched there on the ladder, an unmarried man, clutching the
window in peril, not knowing what to do.</p>

<p>Yvette sat up in bed, her hair in a matted tangle, and stared with
wild eyes, clutching up the sheets at her naked breast.  She had
been so very fast asleep, that she was still not there.</p>

<p>The policeman, terrified at the flabby ladder, climbed into the
room, saying:</p>

<p>&quot;Don't be frightened, Miss!  Don't you worry any more about it.
You're safe now.&quot;</p>

<p>And Yvette, so dazed, thought he meant the gipsy.  Where was the
gipsy?  This was the first thing in her mind.  Where was her gipsy
of this world's-end night?</p>

<p>He was gone!  He was gone!  And a policeman was in the room!  A
policeman!</p>

<p>She rubbed her hand over her dazed brow.</p>

<p>&quot;If you'll get dressed, Miss, we can get you down to safe ground.
The house is likely to fall.  I suppose there's nobody in the other
rooms?&quot;</p>

<p>He stepped gingerly into the passage, and gazed in terror through
the torn-out end of the house, and far-off saw the rector coming
down in a motor-car, on the sunlit hill.</p>

<p>Yvette, her face gone numb and disappointed, got up quickly,
closing the bed-clothes, and looked at herself a moment, then
opened her drawers for clothing.  She dressed herself, then looked
in a mirror, and saw her matted hair with horror.  Yet she did not
care.  The gipsy was gone, anyhow.</p>

<p>Her own clothes lay in a sodden heap.  There was a great sodden
place on the carpet where his had been, and two blood-stained
filthy towels.  Otherwise there was no sign of him.</p>

<p>She was tugging at her hair when the policeman tapped at her door.
She called him to come in.  He saw with relief that she was dressed
and in her right senses.</p>

<p>&quot;We'd better get out of the house as soon as possible, Miss,&quot; he
re-iterated.  &quot;It might fall any minute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really!&quot; said Yvette calmly.  &quot;Is it as bad as that?&quot;</p>

<p>There were great shouts.  She had to go to the window.  There,
below, was the rector, his arms wide open, tears streaming down his
face.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm perfectly all right, Daddy!&quot; she said, with the calmness of
her contradictory feelings.  She would keep the gipsy a secret from
him.  At the same time, tears ran down her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you cry, Miss, don't you cry!  The rector's lost his mother,
but he's thanking his stars to have his daughter.  We all thought
you were gone as well, we did that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is Granny drowned?&quot; said Yvette.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm afraid she is, poor lady!&quot; said the policeman, with a grave
face.</p>

<p>Yvette wept away into her hanky, which she had had to fetch from a
drawer.</p>

<p>&quot;Dare you go down that ladder, Miss?&quot; said the policeman.</p>

<p>Yvette looked at the sagging depth of it, and said promptly to
herself:  No!  Not for anything! - But then she remembered the
gipsy's saying:  &quot;Be braver in the body.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you been in all the other rooms?&quot; she said, in her keeping,
turning to the policeman.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Miss!  But you was the only person in the house, you know,
save the old lady.  Cook got away in time, and Lizzie was up at her
mother's.  It was only you and the poor old lady we was fretting
about.  Do you think you dare go down that ladder?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Yvette with indifference.  The gipsy was gone
anyway.</p>

<p>And now the rector in torment watched his tall, slender daughter
slowly stepping backwards down the sagging ladder, the policeman,
peering heroically from the smashed window, holding the ladder's
top ends.</p>

<p>At the foot of the ladder Yvette appropriately fainted in her
father's arms, and was borne away with him, in the car, by Bob, to
the Framley home.  There the poor Lucille, a ghost of ghosts, wept
with relief till she had hysterics, and even Aunt Cissie cried out
among her tears:  &quot;Let the old be taken and the young spared!  Oh I
CAN'T cry for the Mater, now Yvette is spared!&quot;</p>

<p>And she wept gallons.</p>

<p>The flood was caused by the sudden bursting of the great reservoir,
up in Papple Highdale, five miles from the rectory.  It was found
out later that an ancient, perhaps even a Roman mine tunnel,
unsuspected, undreamed of, beneath the reservoir dam, had
collapsed, undermining the whole dam.  That was why the Papple had
been, for the last day, so uncannily full.  And then the dam had
burst.</p>

<p>The rector and the two girls stayed on at the Framleys', till a new
home could be found.  Yvette did not attend Granny's funeral.  She
stayed in bed.</p>

<p>Telling her tale, she only told how the gipsy had got her inside
the porch, and she had crawled to the stairs out of the water.  It
was known that he had escaped: the old gipsy had said so, when he
fetched the horse and cart from the Red Lion.  Yvette could tell
little.  She was vague, confused, she seemed hardly to remember
anything.  But that was just like her.</p>

<p>It was Bob Framley who said:</p>

<p>&quot;You know, I think that gipsy deserves a medal.&quot;</p>

<p>The whole family was suddenly struck.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, we OUGHT to thank him!&quot; cried Lucille.</p>

<p>The rector himself went with Bob in the car.  But the quarry was
deserted.  The gipsies had lifted camp and gone, no one knew
whither.</p>

<p>And Yvette, lying in bed, moaned in her heart:  Oh, I love him!  I
love him!  I love him! - The grief over him kept her prostrate.  Yet
practically, she too was acquiescent in the fact of his
disappearance.  Her young soul knew the wisdom of it.</p>

<p>But after Granny's funeral, she received a little letter, dated
from some unknown place.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear Miss, I see in the paper you are all right after your
ducking, as is the same with me.  I hope I see you again one day,
maybe at Tideswell cattle fair, or maybe we come that way again.  I
come that day to say goodbye! and I never said it, well, the water
give no time, but I live in hopes.  Your obdt. servant Joe
Boswell.&quot;</p>

<p>And only then she realised that he had a name.</p>
