<p>This is a troublesome world enough, but thanks to that mitigating fate
which now and again interferes to our advantage, there do come to most
of us times and periods of existence which, if they do not quite fulfil
all the conditions of ideal happiness, yet go near enough to that end to
permit in after days of our imagining that they did so. I say to most of
us, but in doing so I allude chiefly to those classes commonly known as
the "upper," by which is understood those who have enough bread to put
into their mouths and clothes to warm them; those, too, who are not the
present subjects of remorseless and hideous ailments, who are not daily
agonised by the sight of their famished offspring; who are not doomed to
beat out their lives against the madhouse bars, or to see their hearts'
beloved and their most cherished hope wither towards that cold space
from whence no message comes. For such unfortunates, and for their
million-numbered kin upon the globe--the victims of war, famine, slave
trade, oppression, usury, over-population, and the curse of competition,
the rays of light must be few indeed; few and far between, only just
enough to save them from utter hopelessness. And even to the favoured
ones, the well warmed and well fed, who are to a great extent lifted by
fortune or by their native strength and wit above the degradations
of the world, this light of happiness is but as the gleam of stars,
uncertain, fitful, and continually lost in clouds. Only the utterly
selfish or the utterly ignorant can be happy with the happiness of
savages or children, however prosperous their own affairs, for to the
rest, to those who think and have hearts to feel, and imagination to
realise, and a redeeming human sympathy to be touched, the mere weight
of the world's misery pressing round them like an atmosphere, the mere
echoes of the groans of the dying and the cries of the children are
sufficient, and more than sufficient, to dull, aye, to destroy the
promise of their joys. But, even to this finer sort there do come rare
periods of almost complete happiness--little summers in the tempestuous
climate of our years, green-fringed wells of water in our desert, pure
northern lights breaking in upon our gloom. And strange as it may seem,
these breadths of happy days, when the old questions cease to torment,
and a man can trust in Providence and without one qualifying thought
bless the day that he was born, are very frequently connected with the
passion which is known as love; that mysterious symbol of our double
nature, that strange tree of life which, with its roots sucking their
strength from the dust-heap of humanity, yet springs aloft above our
level and bears its blooms in the face of heaven.
</p><p>Why it is and what it means we shall perhaps never know for certain. But
it does suggest itself, that as the greatest terror of our being lies
in the utter loneliness, the unspeakable identity, and unchanging
self-completeness of every living creature, so the greatest hope and
the intensest natural yearning of our hearts go out towards that passion
which in its fire heats has the strength, if only for a little while,
to melt down the barriers of our individuality and give to the soul
something of the power for which it yearns of losing its sense of
solitude in converse with its kind. For alone we are from infancy to
death!--we, for the most part, grow not more near together but rather
wider apart with the widening years. Where go the sympathies between the
parent and the child, and where is the close old love of brother for his
brother?
</p><p>The invisible fates are continually wrapping us round and round with the
winding sheets of our solitude, and none may know all our heart save
He who made it. We are set upon the world as the stars are set upon the
sky, and though in following our fated orbits we pass and repass, and
each shine out on each, yet are we the same lonely lights, rolling
obedient to laws we cannot understand, through spaces of which none may
mark the measure.
</p><p>Only, as says the poet in words of truth and beauty:
</p>
<p> "Only but this is rare--  When a beloved hand is laid in ours,
  When jaded with the rush and glare<br/>
  Of the interminable hours,<br/>
  Our eyes can in another's eyes read clear;
  When our world-deafened ear<br/>
  Is by the tones of a loved voice caressed
  A bolt is shot back somewhere in our breast
  And a lost pulse of feeling stirs again--  And what we mean we say and what we would we know.
</p><hr/>
<p>  And then he thinks he knows<br/>
  The hills where his life rose<br/>
  And the sea whereunto it goes."
</p>
<p>Some such Indian summer of delight and forgetfulness of trouble, and the
tragic condition of our days, was now opening to Harold Quaritch and
Ida de la Molle. Every day, or almost every day, they met and went
upon their painting expeditions and argued the point of the validity or
otherwise of the impressionist doctrines of art. Not that of all this
painting came anything very wonderful, although in the evening the
Colonel would take out his canvases and contemplate their rigid
proportions with singular pride and satisfaction. It was a little
weakness of his to think that he could paint, and one of which he was
somewhat tenacious. Like many another man he could do a number of things
exceedingly well and one thing very badly, and yet had more faith in
that bad thing than in all the good.
</p><p>But, strange to say, although he affected to believe so firmly in his
own style of art and hold Ida's in such cheap regard, it was a little
painting of the latter's that he valued most, and which was oftenest put
upon his easel for purposes of solitary admiration. It was one of those
very impressionist productions that faded away in the distance, and full
of soft grey tints, such as his soul loathed. There was a tree with a
blot of brown colour on it, and altogether (though as a matter of fact
a clever thing enough) from his point of view of art it was utterly
"anathema." This little picture in oils faintly shadowed out himself
sitting at his easel, working in the soft grey of the autumn evening,
and Ida had painted it and given it to him, and that was why he admired
it so much. For to speak the truth, our friend the Colonel was going,
going fast--sinking out of sight of his former self into the depths of
the love that possessed his soul.
</p><p>He was a very simple and pure-minded man. Strange as it may appear,
since that first unhappy business of his youth, of which he had
never been heard to speak, no living woman had been anything to him.
Therefore, instead of becoming further vulgarised and hardened
by association with all the odds and ends of womankind that a man
travelling about the globe comes into contact with, generally not
greatly to his improvement, his faith had found time to grow up stronger
even than at first. Once more he looked upon woman as a young man looks
before he has had bitter experience of the world--as a being to be
venerated and almost worshipped, as something better, brighter, purer
than himself, hardly to be won, and when won to be worn like a jewel
prized at once for value and for beauty.
</p><p>Now this is a dangerous state of mind for a man of three or four and
forty to fall into, because it is a soft state, and this is a world in
which the softest are apt to get the worst of it. At four and forty a
man, of course, should be hard enough to get the better of other people,
as indeed he generally is.
</p><p>When Harold Quaritch, after that long interval, set his eyes again upon
Ida's face, he felt a curious change come over him. All the vague ideas
and more or less poetical aspirations which for five long years had
gathered themselves about that memory, took shape and form, and in his
heart he knew he loved her. Then as the days went on and he came to know
her better, he grew to love her more and more, till at last his whole
heart went out towards his late found treasure, and she became more than
life to him, more than aught else had been or could be. Serene and
happy were those days which they spent in painting and talking as they
wandered about the Honham Castle grounds. By degrees Ida's slight but
perceptible hardness of manner wore away, and she stood out what she
was, one of the sweetest and most natural women in England, and with it
all, a woman having brains and force of character.
</p><p>Soon Harold discovered that her life had been anything but an easy one.
The constant anxiety about money and her father's affairs had worn her
down and hardened her till, as she said, she began to feel as though she
had no heart left. Then too he heard all her trouble about her dead
and only brother James, how dearly she had loved him, and what a sore
trouble he had been with his extravagant ways and his continual demands
for money, which had to be met somehow or other. At last came the
crushing blow of his death, and with it the certainty of the extinction
of the male line of the de la Molles, and she said that for a while
she had believed her father would never hold up his head again. But his
vitality was equal to the shock, and after a time the debts began to
come in, which although he was not legally bound to do so, her father
would insist upon meeting to the last farthing for the honour of the
family and out of respect for his son's memory. This increased their
money troubles, which had gone on and on, always getting worse as the
agricultural depression deepened, till things had reached their present
position.
</p><p>All this she told him bit by bit, only keeping back from him the last
development of the drama with the part that Edward Cossey had played in
it, and sad enough it made him to think of that ancient house of de la
Molle vanishing into the night of ruin.
</p><p>Also she told him something of her own life, how companionless it had
been since her brother went into the army, for she had no real friends
about Honham, and not even an acquaintance of her own tastes, which,
without being gushingly so, were decidedly artistic and intellectual. "I
should have wished," she said, "to try to do something in the world. I
daresay I should have failed, for I know that very few women meet with a
success which is worth having. But still I should have liked to try, for
I am not afraid of work. But the current of my life is against it; the
only thing that is open to me is to strive and make both ends meet upon
an income which is always growing smaller, and to save my father, poor
dear, from as much worry as I can.
</p><p>"Don't think that I am complaining," she went on hurriedly, "or that I
want to rush into pleasure-seeking, because I do not--a little of that
goes a long way with me. Besides, I know that I have many things to be
thankful for. Few women have such a kind father as mine, though we do
quarrel at times. Of course we cannot have everything our own way in
this world, and I daresay that I do not make the best of things. Still,
at times it does seem a little hard that I should be forced to lead such
a narrow life, just when I feel that I could work in a wide one."
</p><p>Harold looked up at her face and saw that a tear was gathering in her
dark eyes and in his heart he registered a vow that if by any means it
ever lay within his power to improve her lot he would give everything he
had to do it. But all he said was:
</p><p>"Don't be downhearted, Miss de la Molle. Things change in a wonderful
way, and often they mend when they look worst. You know," he went on
a little nervously, "I am an old-fashioned sort of individual, and I
believe in Providence and all that sort of thing, you see, and that
matters generally come pretty well straight in the long run if people
deserve it."
</p><p>Ida shook her head a little doubtfully and sighed.
</p><p>"Perhaps," she said, "but I suppose that we do not deserve it. Anyhow,
our good fortune is a long while coming," and the conversation dropped.
</p><p>Still her friend's strong belief in the efficacy of Providence, and
generally his masculine sturdiness, did cheer her up considerably.
Even the strongest women, if they have any element that can be called
feminine left in them, want somebody of the other sex to lean on, and
she was no exception to the rule. Besides, if Ida's society had charms
for Colonel Quaritch, his society had almost if not quite as much charm
for her. It may be remembered that on the night when they first met she
had spoken to herself of him as the kind of man whom she would like to
marry. The thought was a passing one, and it may be safely said that
she had not since entertained any serious idea of marriage in connection
with Colonel Quaritch. The only person whom there seemed to be the
slightest probability of her marrying was Edward Cossey, and the mere
thought of this was enough to make the whole idea of matrimony repugnant
to her.
</p><p>But this notwithstanding, day by day she found Harold Quaritch's society
more congenial. Herself by nature, and also to a certain degree by
education, a cultured woman, she rejoiced to find in him an entirely
kindred spirit. For beneath his somewhat rugged and unpromising
exterior, Harold Quaritch hid a vein of considerable richness. Few of
those who associated with him would have believed that the man had a
side to his nature which was almost poetic, or that he was a ripe and
finished scholar, and, what is more, not devoid of a certain dry humour.
Then he had travelled far and seen much of men and manners, gathering
up all sorts of quaint odds and ends of information. But perhaps rather
than these accomplishments it was the man's transparent honesty and
simple-mindedness, his love for what is true and noble, and his contempt
of what is mean and base, which, unwittingly peeping out through his
conversation, attracted her more than all the rest. Ida was no more a
young girl, to be caught by a handsome face or dazzled by a superficial
show of mind. She was a thoughtful, ripened woman, quick to perceive,
and with the rare talent of judgment wherewith to weigh the proceeds of
her perception. In plain, middle-aged Colonel Quaritch she found a very
perfect gentleman, and valued him accordingly.
</p><p>And so day grew into day through that lovely autumn-tide. Edward Cossey
was away in London, Quest had ceased from troubling, and journeying
together through the sweet shadows of companionship, by slow but sure
degrees they drew near to the sunlit plain of love. For it is not
common, indeed, it is so uncommon as to be almost impossible, that a man
and woman between whom there stands no natural impediment can halt for
very long in those shadowed ways. There is throughout all nature an
impulse that pushes ever onwards towards completion, and from completion
to fruition. Liking leads to sympathy, sympathy points the path to love,
and then love demands its own. This is the order of affairs, and down
its well-trodden road these two were quickly travelling.
</p><p>George the wily saw it, and winked his eye with solemn meaning. The
Squire also saw something of it, not being wanting in knowledge of the
world, and after much cogitation and many solitary walks elected to
leave matters alone for the present. He liked Colonel Quaritch, and
thought that it would be a good thing for Ida to get married, though
the idea of parting from her troubled his heart sorely. Whether or no
it would be desirable from his point of view that she should marry the
Colonel was a matter on which he had not as yet fully made up his mind.
Sometimes he thought it would, and sometimes he thought the reverse.
Then at times vague ideas suggested by Edward Cossey's behaviour about
the loan would come to puzzle him. But at present he was so much in the
dark that he could come to no absolute decision, so with unaccustomed
wisdom for so headstrong and precipitate a man, he determined to refrain
from interference, and for a while at any rate allow events to take
their natural course.
