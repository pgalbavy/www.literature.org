<p>All had observed this fact which was natural. The elevation of
the structure, which was open to every breeze that fluttered through
the mountains, made it one of the most comfortable places in that
part of the world. Another thing had been noted by the young women.
Two armed sentinels were pacing outside, and two more came forward
from the lower apartments and saluted the General and his party.
They relieved one another at regular intervals, and three of them
had their wives domiciled on the second floor. These were slatterns,
not wholly lacking in a certain comeliness, and eyed the visitors
with shy curiosity. The latter spoke to them in Spanish, to which
they smiled and replied in soft, awed monosyllables, and respectfully
watched the movements of the young women.</p>

<p>General Yozarro descended the lower stairs, leaving his young
friends on the second floor, where they lingered a few minutes
to admire the view from the windows. The broad, wooded plain,
stretching to the verge of vision, the town nestling in the lowlands
a few miles away, the sweep of the river, and the cloudless blue
sky formed a picture that would always linger in the memory of
all whose privilege it was to look upon them.</p>

<p>The two turned to descend the steps, when the Se√±orita missed
one of her gloves. Hurriedly glancing about her, she said:</p>

<p>"I must have dropped it in the story above; I'll run up and search,
while you may find it below or on the outside."</p>

<p>She darted off like a bird, and Miss Starland moved down the
sloping steps which gave back not the slightest sound. The female
servants had preceded her, so that for a brief time she was alone.
She reached the lower floor, and was passing through the opening
leading out doors, when she heard some one speaking in a low,
but excited voice. She paused and discovered that he was swearing
frightfully, the passion of the speaker being the more fearful
because of the repression of the tones. With a shock which cannot
be described, she recognized the voice as General Yozarro's, and,
more shameful than all, he was addressing one of the women.</p>

<p>In her distress, and determined not to hear the words, Miss Starland
softly ran up the steps and was looking through the rooms again
for the missing glove, when her friend, with a glowing smile,
came down holding it up in her hand. Both laughed over the insignificant
incident, and Miss Starland took care as they descended that her
own merriment continued. General Yozarro, thus warned, finished
his imprecations, and met them with his usual smiles and graciousness.
In his snowy suit, sombrero in hand, he was the acme of cool politeness
and courtesy. Had not Miss Starland identified his voice unmistakably,
she could not have believed what her ears had told her.</p>

<p>That one revelation, however, did its work. She was resolved
to leave Atlamalco on the first opportunity and never to set foot
within the Republic again. She had come to look upon this man
with a mortal horror, for, under the mask of chivalry, he carried
the blackest of hearts.</p>

<p>The return ride was trying to the last degree. General Yozarro
seemed to have forgotten his promise to his niece, and tortured
her friend with attentions which filled her with resentment. When
he assisted her to dismount, he pressed her hand for an instant
until the rings on her fingers dented the flesh and almost caused
her to cry out with pain. He uttered endearing expressions in
a voice so low that no ears except those for which they were intended
heard them, and they gave no heed. Her friend seemed to see nothing
of all this, though she must have been aware of it.</p>

<p>The irrepressible lover, more hopelessly enmeshed than ever,
insisted upon their visitor sitting with him and his niece on
the piazza in the moonlight, but in desperation, she pleaded a
headache&mdash;when she had never suffered therefrom&mdash;and kept her
room.</p>

<p>"And Jack never dreams of anything of this kind," was her thought;
"he is only a few miles away, and I shall insist that I be taken
to him on the morrow."</p>

<p>Having made her resolution, she carried it out. At the table,
which was set in the large back room of General Yozarro's city
house, and provided with the choicest fruits and every delicacy
that the fertile republic could furnish, she made known her wish.
She longed to see her brother on an important matter, and begged
that she might be taken to him with the least possible delay.
The others expressed their regret, and the General offered to
send for her relative.</p>

<p>"The one who goes to take the message can as well take me along,"
said she, determined to force the point.</p>

<p>"Do you expect to remain with him long?" inquired the General.</p>

<p>"I know of nothing to prevent our coming back quite soon."</p>

<p>"Your wish is my command; I shall be very busy today on important
matters. Suppose we take the ride to Zalapata on my gunboat this
evening?"</p>

<p>"That will be delightful!" exclaimed the niece, and though it
was not the exact arrangement her friend wished, she could offer
no objection and it was so agreed.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that the <em>General Yozarro</em> steamed
past Major Jack Starland and Captain Guzman, while the two sat
smoking in front of the native's hut on the northern shore of
the Rio Rubio, without either party suspecting how near they were
to each other.</p>

<p>The long day gave General Yozarro abundant time to perfect his
schemes which were carried out with precision and a faultless
nicety of detail.</p>

<p>Two miles beyond the hut, while the young women were partaking
of refreshments in the Captain's room, which had been specially
fitted for their reception, he came to them in great agitation.</p>

<p>"I have just discovered that General Bambos has obtained a boat
somewhere and is descending the river with the undoubted purpose
of attacking Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"Let us hasten back ahead of him," said his startled niece, who
like her friend was in dismay over the tidings.</p>

<p>"It will never do to flee before him; he must be kept from reaching
our capital; a battle with him is a necessity."</p>

<p>"With us on board?"</p>

<p>"I do not see how it can be helped&mdash;but hold! I will land you
here and send you to <em>Castillo Descanso</em>, where you will
be beyond all harm. Ah! that is it! That is it!"</p>
