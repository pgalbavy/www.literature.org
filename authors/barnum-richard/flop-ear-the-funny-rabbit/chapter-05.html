<p>Flop Ear awoke in the morning feeling hungry. All he had to do was to
reach out and eat part of his hay-bed in which he had slept. I think
that was rather funny. It isn’t every one who can get a breakfast as
easily as that.
</p><p>How would you like to reach out in the morning, when you wake up, and
eat part of the pillow case, a bit of the sheet and perhaps nibble off
one of the rosettes on the bedquilt? I guess it would not taste as good
as your breakfast orange and oatmeal; would it? No indeed!
</p><p>But a rabbit is different. They like hay, and they can sleep in it as
well as eat it. So Flop Ear had no trouble getting his breakfast. And
he knew that in the woods and fields all around him grew many other
things he could eat.
</p><p>“So, even though I am lost, I shall not go hungry,” thought Flop Ear.
“But still I don’t want to be lost. I want to find my home, my father
and my mother, and Snuggle and Pink Nose. I want to see my grandma,
Lady Munch, too. Oh, how I wish that hunter man had never come to our
woods!”
</p><p>But there was no use wishing that now. Flop Ear was far away from home,
and he must do the best he could either to find his way back to it, or
to look for a new home.
</p><p>“It is Summer now,” thought the little rabbit, “and it will be all
right to sleep out in the fields or woods without going down into an
underground burrow. But if I do not find my home before cold weather
comes I shall have to dig a new one for myself. I wonder if I have
forgotten how to dig, or burrow, as father calls it. I guess I’ll go
out and try it now.”
</p><p>Out from the warm little nest he had made for himself in the hay came
Flop Ear. He found a soft place in the field and began to dig in the
dirt, pawing it under him in a pile by scratching with his fore paws,
almost as your dog does it when he feels like digging.
</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten my digging lessons,” said Flop Ear. “So I will be
all right when Winter comes. But it is a long way off yet. Now to try
again to find my home.”
</p><p>He had just left the spot where he had dug the little hole in the
meadow, when, all at once, he heard a dog barking.
</p><p>“Ha! I wonder if that is Don or a hunter’s dog,” thought Flop Ear. He
looked quickly over his shoulder, and he saw a dog running toward him.
It was neither Don nor a hunter’s dog, but a strange one.
</p><p>“Get out of this field!” barked the dog. “Run away or I’ll bite you!”
and he spoke very crossly.
</p><p>“My! You are not as nice and polite as Don was when he let me get the
cabbage,” thought Flop Ear as he bounded away. “I’m not hurting your
field. I only dug a little hole in it, and ate some hay, and there is
a whole mountain of it left.” Flop Ear did not stop to say this to the
barking dog, but spoke as he ran on, for the dog was coming after him
very fast indeed.
</p><p>“Bow wow! Bow wow!” barked the dog. “I’ll catch you, rabbit!”
</p><p>“Oh, ho! No, you won’t!” answered Flop Ear. “You can’t catch me!”
</p><p>Rabbits can run and hop very fast you know, but of course Flop Ear was
only a little fellow, not fully grown, and the dog was a big chap.
So the rabbit, looking back, saw that the dog was getting nearer and
nearer.
</p><p>“I must fool him,” said Flop Ear to himself. “I must run in the woods
where he can not see me. Then he can only follow me by smelling, and
when I get a chance I’ll cross some water, and then the dog can’t even
smell my steps.”
</p><p>When dogs can not see rabbits, or other animals they are chasing, they
have to go by smell. They put their nose to the ground and sniff very
hard, and a dog’s nose is so good for smelling that he can tell just
which way a rabbit went, that is if it is not too long after the rabbit
has passed by. Rabbits, and other animals when they step on the ground,
leave there a sort of smell, called a scent, just as if you rubbed
onion on a dish. Though you did not see the onion rubbed on the dish,
if you smelled the dish, even in the dark, you would know the onion had
been there.
</p><p>That’s the way it is when a dog chases a rabbit. He smells the tracks
on the ground when he can not see the bunny running along.
</p><p>Pretty soon Flop Ear came to the woods. In among the bushes he jumped,
and now he was hidden from the dog.
</p><p>“Oh, but I’ll get you anyhow,” barked the dog. “I’ll smell you out with
my sharp nose.”
</p><p>“No, you won’t,” thought Flop Ear, for he did not want to talk to the
dog now, or the cross animal might find the little white rabbit.
</p><p>On and on ran Flop Ear, as fast as he could go. The dog still came
after him, for every time Flop Ear’s feet touched the ground they left
a smell there which the dog could follow.
</p><p>But, pretty soon, Flop Ear came to a brook running through the woods.
</p><p>“Now here’s where I fool that dog,” thought the rabbit. So Flop Ear
went close to the edge of the water, jumped in where it was not very
deep, and waded down stream, going as fast as he could, splashing drops
all over. But he did not mind that, as the day was warm.
</p><p>Besides it was better to be wet than to have a dog bite him.
</p><p>After going down the brook quite a distance Flop Ear went all the way
across it, to the other side, and then he felt that he need not hurry
so.
</p><p>“The dog can not smell where I am now,” he said to himself.
</p><p>And this was true. Barking and growling, the dog came to the edge of
the brook where Flop Ear had waded into the water, but the rabbit was
out of sight. Then the dog had to stop for a minute.
</p><p>“Now which way did that rabbit go?” he asked himself, for you see the
smell of rabbits’ feet, or those of other animals, will not stay on the
water. That was where the dog was puzzled.
</p><p>“I guess the rabbit jumped across the brook, and is in the woods on the
other side,” said the dog. “I’ll go over there myself.”
</p><p>So across the water went the dog, but when he got on the other side he
could neither see Flop Ear nor smell where he was. For the rabbit was
quite a way down the stream you see. The dog ran all around, trying to
get track of the rabbit smell, but he could not.
</p><p>“He got away from me after all!” said the dog. “I call that a mean
trick!”
</p><p>But for Flop Ear it was a good trick. He did not want to be bitten, any
more than that dog would like to get a nip. So Flop Ear got himself out
of one danger.
</p><p>“My! That was a long run!” said Flop Ear, as he came to a rest on a bed
of soft moss. “I thought that dog would surely get me.” He listened
very hard, but he could not hear the dog barking now. The dog had gone
back to his home in the farmhouse, near the big pile of hay.
</p><p>Flop Ear was hungry again now; so, after resting, he looked about and
found some sweet bark from a tree. He ate as much of this as he wanted,
taking a little sassafras bark as a sort of dessert――as you take
pudding or pie――and then he hopped on again, still looking for his lost
home.
</p><p>All that day Flop Ear wandered about in the woods. Then, as night was
coming on, he looked for a place to sleep. He was wondering if he had
better not go back to the pile of hay, when, all at once he saw another
rabbit just ahead of him.
</p><p>“Oh, if that is only one of my folks!” thought Flop Ear, his heart
beating very fast, “how happy I shall be! Hello there!” he called to
the other bunny.
</p><p>“Hello!” came back the answer, and then Flop Ear’s heart was sad, for
the voice was not that of any of his relatives――not Lady Munch’s, his
father’s, mother’s, Pink Nose’s, or Snuggle’s.
</p><p>“Do you live around here?” asked Flop Ear of the strange rabbit.
</p><p>“Yes,” was the answer. “My burrow is right under the place where you
are sitting, and my front door is near this rock where I am.”
</p><p>“Oh dear! I wish I were as near <u>my</u> home as you are to <u>yours</u>,” said
Flop Ear.
</p><p>“What’s the matter?” asked the other rabbit, whose name was Fluffo.
</p><p>“Oh, I’m lost!” Flop Ear said. “A hunter chased me away from my nice
home.”
</p><p>“Then come and stay with me,” suggested Fluffo. “I have plenty of room,
and there are some nice carrots and cabbages in my burrow.”
</p><p>“How good that sounds,” Flop Ear said. “I will come in and stay with
you.”
</p><p>So down into the other bunny’s burrow he went, and had a good supper,
staying there all night. He had a good breakfast, too, and then he
started off through the woods again.
</p><p>“Why don’t you stay longer with me?” asked Fluffo. “I have plenty of
room for both of us.”
</p><p>“Oh, I would like to stay,” Flop Ear said, “but I feel that I must try
to get back to my own dear home. My father and mother may be looking
for me.”
</p><p>“Well, go on then,” said Fluffo. “I hope you will find your burrow
soon.”
</p><p>“Thank you,” returned Flop Ear, “I hope I do.”
</p><p>Away he hopped, over the fields and through the woods, and pretty soon
he saw that the woods were coming to an end again. A large field was
in front of Flop Ear, and in the field was a farmhouse, with barns and
sheds.
</p><p>“I wonder if I could get anything to eat over there,” thought Flop Ear,
for he had not had anything since leaving Fluffo’s burrow, early that
morning. “I guess I’ll hop over and see,” went on the rabbit. “I hope
there are no dogs to chase me.”
</p><p>Flop Ear hopped across the field toward the farmhouse. Back of it was
a little shed, and the door of this shed was open. In went Flop Ear,
not knowing quite where he was going. He saw piles of wood in the shed,
for this was the place where the farmer’s wife kept her wood for making
fires. There were pieces of trees that had once grown in the forest.
</p><p>“Well, here is some bark I can gnaw,” thought Flop Ear, “but it is not
as nice and fresh as that which grows on the trees in the woods. I
guess I’ll――”
</p><p>And then Flop Ear stopped suddenly, for he heard some one coming into
the woodshed.
</p><p>“Oh, I hope that isn’t the hunter man!” thought the rabbit. “I’d better
hide.”
</p><p>In front of him was a basket filled with wood. There was room down
in among the sticks of wood for Flop Ear to hide. Into the basket he
jumped, and cuddled down out of sight. Then Flop Ear heard a woman
calling:
</p><p>“Jimmie! Jimmie! Bring me in a basket of wood, please!”
</p><p>“I will, Mother,” answered a boy.
</p><p>Flop Ear could understand some of our kind of talk, you know, though he
could not speak it himself.
</p><p>The rabbit heard some one walking around the shed, and then, all at
once, Flop Ear felt himself being lifted up in the basket of wood, and
being carried along.
</p><p>“Oh, I wonder what is going to happen to me now?” thought the rabbit,
whose heart was beating very fast, as he was much frightened.
</p><p>“Are you bringing the wood, Jimmie?” the boy’s mother called.
</p><p>“Yes’m, I’m coming with it.”
</p><p>There was something else in the basket besides the wood, had the boy
only known it.
</p><p>Flop Ear felt himself bouncing along, up and down, as the boy carried
him in the wood basket, and then he felt the basket being set down.
</p><p>“Take out the wood, Jimmie dear, and put it in the wood-box behind the
stove,” said the woman, and the boy did so. Stick after stick he lifted
out, and Flop Ear, who was down in the very bottom, was wondering what
would happen when the basket was empty.
</p><p>“They’ll see me, surely, then,” said the rabbit. “I wonder what they
will do to me? Oh, I seem to be getting in more and more trouble all
the while.”
</p><p>The boy who was lifting the wood out of the basket suddenly cried:
</p><p>“Oh, Mother! Look here! A rabbit!”
</p><p>“A rabbit! Where?”
</p><p>“In the wood basket!” And before Flop Ear could hop out of the way the
boy had lifted him up in his arms, holding him closely.
