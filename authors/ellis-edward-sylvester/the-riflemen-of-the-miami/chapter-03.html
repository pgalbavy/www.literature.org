<p>One cold, drizzly, sleety day, in a winter toward the latter
part of the last century, a party of Shawnee Indians crossed from
the Kentucky cane-brakes into Ohio. Penetrating its deep, labyrinthine
forests, they came upon a double cabin, where dwelt two widows,
with several children. These they inhumanly massacred, and burnt
their dwellings to the ground. Then, laden with their plunder,
they set out on their return to Kentucky.</p>

<p>It so happened that two brothers, George and Lewis Dernor, who
were upon a hunting expedition in this section, came upon the
burning cabin within an hour after the savages had left it. They
saw by the numerous tracks that the party was too large for them
to think of attacking; nevertheless, they took the trail with
the resolution of ascertaining to what tribe the savages belonged;
and, if possible, to pick off one or two, as a slight payment
for the outrage they had committed. Following on for several miles,
they gained a glimpse of them, as they crossed a ridge, and discovered,
as they had suspected all along, that they were a party of Shawnees
returning to Kentucky, although the majority of this tribe of
Indians at this time had their towns in Ohio. A half-hour later,
by signs known only to experienced woodmen, they became convinced
that some one else was also upon the trail of the Indians. After
a great amount of maneuvering and stratagetic reconnoitering,
they learned that it was a hunter like themselves, and no other
but their old friend Dick Allmat. Accompanied by him, they continued
the pursuit, and a mile further on, discovered that still another
person was dogging the Shawnees. Pretty certain that this must
also be a friend, they managed to make themselves known to him
without the tedious ceremony which had characterized their introduction
to Allmat. He proved to be Tom O'Hara, whose utmost exertions
were necessary to keep pace with the retreating savages. He was
in a perfect fury that they should proceed so fast, when he could
see no necessity for it, and was half tempted to expend some of
his wrath upon those of his friends who laughed at his discomfiture.</p>

<p>The party, now numbering four experienced hunters, felt considerable
confidence in their strength, and the proposition was made to
attack the Shawnees. The latter numbered seven or eight, and from
their deliberate and incautious movements, it was manifest, had
not learned that they were pursued. Perhaps they believed no white
man could brave the blinding, seething storm then raging, for
they neglected those precautions which seem to be second nature
with the North American Indian.</p>

<p>The proposition made by Lewis Dernor was agreed to, and the plan
matured. The conflict took place in a sort of open hollow, and
probably was one of the most sanguinary personal conflicts that
ever occurred on the frontier. The hunters came out of it with
no wounds worth mentioning, while only two of the savages escaped.
These plunged into the woods, and disappeared with the speed of
the wind, and the whites were left undisputed masters of the field.</p>

<p>This was by no means the first outrage which had been committed
by similar bands of Indians, and just at this particular time
the arm of the General Government was so weakened from the repeated
disastrous campaigns against them, that they insulted the whites
with impunity, and entertained, in reality, no fear at all of
punishment or retribution. This was the subject of conversation
with the hunters, and so impressed them, that Lewis Dernor proposed
that they should bind themselves together for an indefinite period,
(which was not intended to be over a couple of years or so at
the most,) to do their utmost to check the monstrous outrages
which were becoming so common along the border. The four hunters
mentioned were well known to each other, and had the reputation
of being the best riflemen and woodmen of any then known. In addition
to this, they were all unmarried, and without any prospects of
changing their condition; consequently they were at perfect liberty
to wander whither they pleased.</p>

<p>The proposition was considered, and received a unanimous and
enthusiastic response from all. The brothers Dernor, in their
hunting expeditions, had spent several nights in a cave along
the Miami, which they had discovered by accident, and which afforded
them not only a comfortable, but also a perfect concealment. It
was agreed that this should be their rendezvous, and in order
that all might learn its locality, and the manner of approach
to it, the following night was spent within it.</p>

<p>Now commences the history of the Riflemen of the Miami, as they
were christened by the settlers, to whom their exploits soon became
known, and as they were proud to acknowledge themselves. Instead
of disbanding at the end of two years, as was originally contemplated,
this confederation had an existence for over a dozen years. They
participated in Anthony Wayne's great battle with the Indians,
in 1794, where two of the members fell, and which concluded their
history, as the surviving members retired to private life, and
were too old to participate in the Tecumseh's war of 1812.</p>

<p>It would require a volume to detail the exploits of these Riflemen.
Unlike many other confederations that were formed about this period,
their only object was that of self-defense, and of offering protection
to the settlers who were constantly penetrating the Great West.
No innocent Indians ever suffered at their hands, and many was
the one they befriended and assisted in his extremity. But woe
betide the offender that fell into their hands. To the cruel they
were unsparing; to the merciless they showed no mercy. While their
name was loved and revered by the whites, it was feared and execrated
by the savages. The Shawnees were unusually active and vindictive
at this time, and it was with them that the most frequent encounters
took place. The incident detailed in the first chapter was but
one among many that were constantly occurring, and it scarcely
equaled in importance numerous exploits that they had before performed.</p>

<p>There was a fifth member, who joined the Riflemen only a year
or two previous to the period in which we design to notice their
actions more particularly. He was known as Ferdinand Sego, and
became a member from a part which he performed one night on the
Ohio, when the Riflemen were attacked by three times their number.
He displayed such activity, skill and courage, that he was importuned
to unite with them, although, up to this time, they had refused
to receive any accessions to their number. He consented, and from
that time forward the Riflemen of the Miami numbered five hunters.</p>

<p>Sego joined them, however, with the understanding that he should
be obliged to absent himself from time to time. At regular intervals
he left them, and was gone sometimes for over a week. As he had
no rifle, the cause of these excursions remained a mystery to
his friends until he chose to reveal it himself. It then turned
out that it was nothing less than a female that exercised such
a potent influence upon him. Sego, as he became intimately acquainted
with his friends, often spoke of this girl, and of the great affection
he bore her. One day he gave her name &mdash;Edith Sudbury. This
excited no unusual interest, until Lewis Dernor learned, on the
day that he encountered the emigrants, that he and Sego loved
the same girl!</p>

<p>This was the cause of his unusual agitation, and the pain he
felt at hearing her name pronounced. He entertained the strongest
friendship for Sego, but, until he had met Edith, he had never
known any thing, by experience, of the divine power of our nature.
When he did love, therefore, it was with his whole soul and being.
His companions, less sagacious in sentimental affairs than worldly,
failed to divine the cause of the singular actions of their leader,
who did his utmost to conceal it from them. Little did he dream,
as he listened to the enthusiastic praises of Edith by Sego, that
it was the being who constantly occupied his thoughts. But the
truth had broken upon him like a peal of thunder at midday.</p>

<p>On the day succeeding Lewis' departure from the settlers, three
of his men, O'Hara, Dernor and Allmat, stood on the banks of the
Miami, several hundred yards above their rendezvous. The sky was
clear and sunshiny, and they were making ready for a trial of
skill with their rifles. From where they stood, the most practiced
eye would have failed to discover any spot which could possibly
afford shelter for one of their number, much less for them all.
But beneath a cluster of bushes, projecting from the upper edge
of the bank, was an orifice, barely sufficient to admit the passage
of a man's body. Entering this, on his hands and knees, he was
ushered into a subterranean cave, dark, but of ample dimensions
to accommodate a dozen men. It was furnished with blankets and
the skins of different animals, and each of the Riflemen took
especial pride in decorating and fixing it up for their convenience.</p>

<p>Dick paced off two hundred yards, and then chipped a small piece
from the trunk of a beech tree along the river-bank, as a target
for their weapons. As he stepped one side, O'Hara raised his piece,
and scarcely pausing to take aim, fired. Instead of striking the
mark, he missed it by fully two inches. When this was announced,
he turned round, and with an impatient exclamation, demanded:</p>

<p>"Who fired that gun last?"</p>

<p>"I believe I did," replied Dernor.</p>

<p>"You just touch it again, and you'll never touch another rifle.
Do you know what you have done?"</p>

<p>"Know what I've done? Of course I do. I've fired it."</p>

<p>"<em>You've put a spell on it.</em>"</p>

<p>"The deuce! Try it again!"</p>

<p>O'Hara shook his head.</p>

<p>"It would never miss such a mark as that unless it was bewitched.
I've got to melt up that money of mine, or the thing will never
be worth a half-penny again."</p>

<p>When a Kentuckian's gun is bewitched, or has a "spell upon it,"
the only way in which he can free it of its enchantment, is by
firing a silver bullet from it. Unless this is done, they steadfastly
believe it can never be relied upon afterward.</p>

<p>O'Hara, accordingly, produced his bullet-mould, kindled a fire,
which required much more blowing and care to fuse the metal than
it did to melt lead or pewter. But he succeeded at last, melting
down all his spare change to make the small, shining bullet. This
was rammed down his gun, a deliberate aim taken, and Dick announced
that it had struck the mark plumb in the center. The charm was
gone!</p>

<p>It would be uninteresting to narrate the different methods by
which each of the three men demonstrated his remarkable skill
with his favorite weapon. They fired at different distances, at
objects in the air, and in each others' hands, and then discharged
their pieces on a run, wheeling as quick as thought. Although
the weapon used was the old flint-lock rifle, the dexterity exhibited
by each could scarcely be excelled by that of the most famous
sharp-shooters of the present day, with their improved guns. The
exercise was continued for over two hours, when, as O'Hara was
reloading his piece, the report of a rifle was heard upon the
opposite side of the Miami, and the bullet whizzed within an inch
of O'Hara's face. As all three looked across the river, they saw
a faint, bluish wreath rising from the shrubbery, but no signs
of the one who had fired the shot.</p>

<p>"I guess his gun has had a spell put on it," said O'Hara, sneeringly.</p>

<p>"And I guess you'll get a spell put on you, if he tries that
again," remarked Dick, carefully scrutinizing the opposite bank.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he show himself, the coward? Like enough there is
a whole party of Shawnees&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh! Something moved over there."</p>

<p>"He's going to cross, I'll be shot if he isn't."</p>

<p>A splash was now heard, as though something had been cast upon
the surface of the water, and a moment later, a small Indian canoe,
in which was seated a single person, shot from beneath the shrubbery,
skimming over the river like a swallow, and headed directly toward
the spot where the Riflemen were standing. Dick raised his rifle,
but instantly lowered it with a laugh.</p>

<p>"It's nobody but Lew himself. He just fired to scare us."</p>

<p>Propelled by a single paddle, the frail boat sped onward with
great celerity, and its prow, in a few moments, grated lightly
against the shingle at the feet of the hunters, and their leader
stepped forth.</p>

<p>"Been practicing, I see," he remarked.</p>

<p>"A little; <em>you</em> tried your hand, also."</p>

<p>Lewis smiled, as he replied:</p>

<p>"A little fun, of course; but we've got better business on hand."</p>

<p>"Let's hear it, for we are ready for any thing."</p>

<p>"A lot of settlers are going through the woods, down below, and
they need company, for the Shawnees have scented them as sure
as the world. I've promised them that we will see them through&mdash;where's
Sego?" suddenly asked the leader, looking around, as if searching
for the one mentioned.</p>

<p>"He went off yesterday."</p>

<p>"That's unlucky, for we shall need him, too. Will he be back
to-day?"</p>

<p>"He said he expected to return this afternoon."</p>

<p>"We will wait for him, then, though they need us, most certainly."</p>

<p>"It's the first time Sego has been off in a good while," said
Dick, "and I don't know what started him this time."</p>

<p>Lewis thought that he would give a good deal if he knew, although
he chose to say nothing about it. An hour or more was spent in
conversation, when the four sauntered carelessly toward the cave,
the canoe first having been pulled high enough upon the bank to
make it secure against being washed away by the current. They
did not enter the cave, but passed it, and returned after it was
fairly dark, when they were certain that no prying eyes had seen
them.</p>

<p>When morning dawned, Sego had not returned, and Lewis was undetermined
whether to wait longer for him, or to go on at once. The case
was urgent, but the need of Sego's arm was also urgent, and he
concluded to wait still further. The forenoon, the afternoon,
and finally the night came and went, without bringing any signs
of the absentee, and at daylight on this day, Lewis and his men
made ready to start, resolved not to lose another moment. As they
passed down to the river's edge, the delinquent made his appearance
and joined them. They crossed the Miami in the canoe&mdash;its lightness
rendering it necessary to make the passage twice&mdash;and plunging
in the forest, made all haste toward the settlers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the prolonged absence of the Riflemen, was the occasion
of much speculation and anxiety upon the part of the emigrants.
When Lewis had named the period at which he expected to join them
with his men, they all knew he had allowed himself the widest
limit, and fully intended to return within the time specified.</p>

<p>When, therefore, this hour passed, they certainly had sufficient
grounds for their anxiety and uneasiness, and some of the men
did not hesitate to express their conviction that the Riflemen
would not come at all. Not that they would willingly fail to keep
their appointment, but it was more than probable that circumstances
had arisen which prevented it.</p>

<p>The settlers remained encamped until thirty hours beyond the
time of the expected arrival of the Riflemen, when every one had
given up all hope of seeing them, and it was agreed to move on
to the banks of the creek. The scouts, who had been constantly
busy, reported that no signs of Indians were visible in the vicinity,
and strong hopes were entertained that they would be able to cross
without disturbance.</p>

<p>"Before venturing into that same piece of water," said Smith,
"I propose that another examination of the woods be made, and
that some of us wade over first to see how deep the stream is."</p>

<p>The latter suggestion had already been acted upon by the scouts
several times, but, as all shared the feeling of Smith, the scouts,
joined this time by the old man's two sons, set out to act upon
his proposal. After examining the bank upon which they stood,
with the greatest care, for several hundred yards both above and
below, they returned with the report that no signs of danger had
been discovered.</p>

<p>Two of them now entered the creek in front of the oxen, and commenced
wading across. It would be impossible to depict the anxiety, intense
apprehension, and almost terror with which they were regarded
by their friends upon the shore. One was Laughlin and the other
Harry Smith, and mixed with the parents' natural uneasiness, was
a pride which glowed upon his face at seeing his son so unhesitatingly
facing danger. Had he known that the most imminent peril threatened
him, the wealth of the Indias would not have tempted him to call
him back.</p>

<p>Step by step the two men advanced across the creek, the water
in no place being above their knees, until they stepped upon dry
land once more. This was the culminating point of anxiety with
their friends. This apprehension now became so intense as to be
painful and almost unbearable. Some ten or fifteen minutes (which
seemed hours to the waiting friends) was spent in reconnoitering
the shore, after which the two stepped into the station and set
out on their return. They had taken but a step or two, when they
suddenly drew back, and Laughlin made a signal of danger to the
settlers, the cause of which was instantly seen by all.</p>
