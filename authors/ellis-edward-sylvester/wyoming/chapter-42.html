<p>It is idle to attempt to picture the feelings of Jake Golcher,
when he learned from Mr. Brainerd, one of the captives, that Fred
Godfrey had escaped but a few minutes before.</p>

<p>Weakly hoping there was some mistake, he turned to one of the
Indians and demanded the truth. He got it in the shape of information
that several of the fleetest warriors were hunting for the fugitive,
and there was hope he would be brought in speedily.</p>

<p>The renegade stood a few seconds, and then began striding up
and down in front of the camp-fire, indulging in imprecations
too frightful to be recorded.</p>

<p>All this time Mr. Brainerd was so delighted that he forgot his
own grief. He knew how great was the disappointment of the man,
and he was pleased thereat, for, recalling the chastisement received
from the hands of Aunt Peggy, it can be safely said that matters
had gone ill with Golcher, since the lady began cooking for her
captors.</p>

<p>By and by he exhausted himself, and then paused in front of Habakkuk
McEwen and demanded:</p>

<p>"Why didn't you stop him when you seen him running away?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see him," was the truthful reply of the fellow, who
was mean enough to add: "If I had, you can just bet I'd stopped
him, even if my hands was tied."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you yell for me as soon as you found out he had gone?"</p>

<p>"I did yell," was the unblushing answer, "but there was so much
confusion nobody noticed me, and the Injins was off after him
as quick as he started."</p>

<p>"Just then Aunt Peggy was attending to you," Mr. Brainerd remarked,
"and you were so badly used up that you wouldn't have noticed
an earthquake had it come along."</p>

<p>Maggie looked beseechingly at her father, while the Tory glowered
on him like a thunder-cloud.</p>

<p>But for his anxiety to win the good will of the pretty maiden,
he would have struck down her parent where he stood. The latter
acted as though he had given up all hope, and was trying to retaliate
to some extent on him whom he detested.</p>

<p>"See here," said Habakkuk, with a flirt of his head and a confidential
air, "ain't you going to cut them things that are tied about my
arms?"</p>

<p>"What'll we do that for?"</p>

<p>"So's to let me loose," was the logical answer; "you know, Jakey&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, don't call me Jakey," interrupted the Tory.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Golcher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Make it plain 'Jake.'"</p>

<p>"Well, Jake, as I was going to say, I'm your friend, and have
been ever since I knowed you, and you know it; if you'll let me
loose I'll 'list under you; I'm already got up Injin style, and
will sarve as one of your advanced scouts."</p>

<p>"Shet up?" interrupted Golcher; "I don't b'leve you're anything
more than a rebel, and if we'd done as we orter, the whole caboodle
of you would have been wiped out before the sun went down."</p>

<p>While the Tory was indulging in these expressions he continually
glanced at Maggie Brainerd, occasionally taking a step toward
her. It is at such times that a woman is quick to perceive the
truth, and with the natural instinct of her sex, she looked at
him in turn, and with that smile of hers that was really resistless,
said:</p>

<p>"Jake, come here a minute, please."</p>

<p>In a flutter of surprise, he approached, with a smirking grin.</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, dear Maggie?"</p>

<p>"I'll be much obliged if you will cut those bonds which trouble
father. He has suffered so much to-day that he is irritable, and
I hope you will pardon him."</p>

<p>This was an audacious request, and took Golcher aback somewhat,
but there was no refusing the prayer.</p>

<p>So, with the best grace possible, he stepped forward, hunting-knife
in hand, and cut first the wire-like withes that held Habakkuk
McEwen fast, and then did the same with those of Mr. Brainerd.</p>

<p>"I'm very much obliged," said the grateful Habakkuk; "you're
very kind, and after this I'm your servant."</p>

<p>Angry as was Mr. Brainerd, he had better sense than to quarrel
with his good fortune, and he thanked the man who loosened his
arms, while at the same time he concluded to hold his peace for
the time.</p>

<p>"Fred is beyond their reach," he thought, "and so is Gravity
Gimp, and I judge one of them had a gun. True, that isn't much,
but there is no saying what will be done with it, for both are
as brave men as ever stood in battle.</p>

<p>"If Fred only had the chance, he would be heard from very soon.
But there is none whom he can rally to our help. Ah, if he could
but pick up a half-dozen soldiers, what a raid he would make through
this camp! But wherever there are any of our soldiers they are
wounded, killed, or so scared that they are an element of weakness.</p>

<p>"I can not help feeling some hope, and yet my reason tells me
that there is no ground on which to base it."</p>

<p>Having complied with the request of Maggie Brainerd, Golcher
felt authorized to approach her with a statement of his own proposition.
Accordingly, he walked to the farther end of the log, and motioned
for her to join him. She thought it best to comply, and did so,
sitting down within a foot or two of him.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, with his smirk, "I've done what you axed
me to do."</p>

<p>"You have, and I thank you for it."</p>

<p>"That's all right; there ain't nothin' mean about me, for all
some folks choose to slander me. Now, I s'pose you'd like to have
your father and the rest of them folks let go?"</p>

<p>"I have been praying for that ever since the Indians captured
us."</p>

<p>"Wall, I've been thinking 'bout settin' you all loose to take
care of yourselves."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you do, Mr. Golcher&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thar, thar," he interrupted, with a wave of the hand; "call
me 'Jake' when you speak to me."</p>

<p>"I'll be grateful to you, Jake, as long as I live, and so will
they."</p>

<p>"That's all very well; but gratertude ain't going to do me much
good," said Jake, with another grin. "I orter have some reward,
Maggie."</p>

<p>"So you will; the reward of an approving conscience, which is
beyond the price of rubies."</p>

<p>"I know all 'bout that," said he, slinging one leg over the other,
after which he nursed the upper knee and swayed the foot back
and forth; "but that don't satisfy me. I want more."</p>

<p>"We have a little farm, you know; I'll give you my share in that,
and father, I'm sure, will pay you everything he can get together."</p>

<p>"Yes, but that ain't enough, Maggie."</p>

<p>"What else can we do?" she asked, despairingly, while her sex's
intuition told her what he was hinting at.</p>

<p>"I want <em>you</em>," he said, bending his head close to her,
while she recoiled; "if you'll be my wife, I'll let your father,
Eva, yourself, and even Aunt Peggy, go; if you don't, the Senecas
shall tomahawk them all."</p>

<p>Maggie Brainerd knew this was coming, and she asked herself whether
it was not her duty to be offered up as a sacrifice, to save her
beloved friends. Would there be any more heroism in doing so than
had been displayed before by thousands of her sex?</p>

<p>She was prayerfully considering the question, when her indignant
father, who had heard it all, broke in with:</p>

<p>"Tell him no&mdash;a thousand times no! If you don't, you are no daughter
of mine!"</p>
