<p>The horseman rode down the narrow vennel which led to the St.
Denis gate of Paris, holding his nose like a fine lady. Behind
him the city reeked in a close August twilight. From every entry
came the smell of coarse cooking and unclean humanity, and the
heaps of garbage in the gutters sent up a fog of malodorous dust
when they were stirred by prowling dogs or hasty passengers.</p>

<p>"Another week of heat and they will have the plague here," he
muttered. Oh for Eaucourt &mdash;Eaucourt by the waters! I have
too delicate a stomach for this Paris."</p>

<p>His thoughts ran on to the country beyond the gates, the fields
about St. Denis, the Clermont downs. Soon he would be stretching
his bay on good turf.</p>

<p>But the gates were closed, though it was not yet the hour of
curfew. The lieutenant of the watch stood squarely before him
with a forbidding air, while a file of arquebusiers lounged in
the archway.</p>

<p>"There's no going out to-night," was the answer to the impatient
rider.</p>

<p>"Tut, man, I am the Sieur de Laval, riding north on urgent affairs.
My servants left at noon. Be quick. Open!"</p>

<p>"Who ordered this folly?"</p>

<p>"The Marshal Tavannes. Go argue with him, if your mightiness
has the courage."</p>

<p>The horseman was too old a campaigner to waste time in wrangling.
He turned his horse's head and retraced his path up the vennel.
"Now what in God's name is afoot to-night?" he asked himself,
and the bay tossed his dainty head, as if in the same perplexity.
He was a fine animal with the deep barrel and great shoulders
of the Norman breed, and no more than his master did he love this
place of alarums and stenches.</p>

<p>Gaspard de Laval was a figure conspicuous enough even in that
city of motley. For one thing he was well over two yards high,
and, though somewhat lean for perfect proportions, his long arms
and deep chest told of no common strength. He looked more than
his thirty years, for his face was burned the colour of teak by
hot suns, and a scar just under the hair wrinkled a broad low
forehead. His small pointed beard was bleached by weather to the
hue of pale honey. He wore a steel back and front over a doublet
of dark taffeta, and his riding cloak was blue velvet lined with
cherry satin. The man's habit was sombre except for the shine
of steel and the occasional flutter of the gay lining. In his
velvet bonnet he wore a white plume. The rich clothing became
him well, and had just a hint of foreignness, as if commonly he
were more roughly garbed. Which was indeed the case, for he was
new back from the Western Seas, and had celebrated his home-coming
with a brave suit.</p>

<p>As a youth he had fought under Conde in the religious wars, but
had followed Jean Ribaut to Florida, and had been one of the few
survivors when the Spaniards sacked St. Caroline. With de Gourgues
he had sailed west again for vengeance, and had got it. Thereafter
he had been with the privateers of Brest and La Rochelle, a hornet
to search out and sting the weak places of Spain on the Main and
among the islands. But he was not born to live continually in
outland parts, loving rather to intercalate fierce adventures
between spells of home-keeping. The love of his green Picardy
manor drew him back with gentle hands. He had now returned like
a child to his playthings, and the chief thoughts in his head
were his gardens and fishponds, the spinneys he had planted and
the new German dogs he had got for boar-hunting in the forest.
He looked forward to days of busy idleness in his modest kingdom.</p>

<p>But first he must see his kinsman the Admiral about certain affairs
of the New World which lay near to that great man's heart. Coligny
was his godfather, from whom he was named; he was also his kinsman,
for the Admiral's wife, Charlotte de Laval, was a cousin once
removed. So to Chatillon Gaspard journeyed, and thence to Paris,
whither the Huguenot leader had gone for the marriage fetes of
the King of Navarre. Reaching the city on the Friday evening,
he was met by ill news. That morning the Admiral's life had been
attempted on his way back from watching the King at tennis. Happily
the wounds were slight, a broken right forefinger and a bullet
through the left forearm, but the outrage had taken away men's
breath. That the Admiral of France, brought to Paris for those
nuptials which were to be a pledge of a new peace, should be the
target of assassins shocked the decent and alarmed the timid.
The commonwealth was built on the side of a volcano, and the infernal
fires were muttering. Friend and foe alike set the thing down
to the Guises' credit, and the door of Coligny's lodging in the
Rue de Bethisy was thronged by angry Huguenot gentry, clamouring
to be permitted to take order with the Italianate murderers.</p>

<p>On the Saturday morning Gaspard was admitted to audience with
his kinsman, but found him so weak from Monsieur Ambrose Pare's
drastic surgery that he was compelled to postpone his business.
"Get you back to Eaucourt," said Coligny, "and cultivate your
garden till I send for you. France is too crooked just now for
a forthright fellow like you to do her service, and I do not think
that the air of Paris is healthy for our house." Gaspard was fain
to obey, judging that the Admiral spoke of some delicate state
business for which he was aware he had no talent. A word with
M. de Teligny reassured him as to the Admiral's safety, for according
to him the King now leaned heavily against the Guises.</p>

<p>But lo and behold! the gates of Paris were locked to him, and
he found himself interned in the sweltering city.</p>

<p>He did not like it. There was an ugly smack of intrigue in the
air, puzzling to a plain soldier. Nor did he like the look of
the streets now dim in the twilight. On his way to the gates they
had been crammed like a barrel of salt fish, and in the throng
there had been as many armed men as if an enemy made a leaguer
beyond the walls. There had been, too, a great number of sallow
southern faces, as if the Queen-mother had moved bodily thither
a city of her countrymen. But now as the dark fell the streets
were almost empty. The houses were packed to bursting&mdash;a blur
of white faces could be seen at the windows, and every entry seemed
to be alive with silent men. But in the streets there was scarcely
a soul except priests, flitting from door to door, even stumbling
against his horse in their preoccupation. Black, brown, and grey
crows, they made Paris like Cartagena. The man's face took a very
grim set as he watched these birds of ill omen. What in God's
name had befallen his honest France?... He was used to danger,
but this secret massing chilled even his stout heart. It was like
a wood he remembered in Florida where every bush had held an Indian
arrow, but without sight or sound of a bowman. There was hell
brewing in this foul cauldron of a city.</p>

<p>He stabled his horse in the yard in the Rue du Coq, behind the
glover's house where he had lain the night before. Then he set
out to find supper. The first tavern served his purpose. Above
the door was a wisp of red wool, which he knew for the Guise colours.
Inside he looked to find a crowd, but there was but one other
guest. Paris that night had business, it seemed, which did not
lie in the taverns.</p>

<p>That other guest was a man as big as himself, clad wholly in
black, save for a stiff cambric ruff worn rather fuller than the
fashion. He was heavily booted, and sat sideways on a settle with
his left hand tucked in his belt and a great right elbow on the
board. Something in his pose, half rustic, half braggart, seemed
familiar to Gaspard. The next second the two were in each other's
arms.</p>

<p>"Gawain Champernoun!" cried Gaspard. "When I left you by the
Isle of Pines I never hoped to meet you again in a Paris inn?
What's your errand, man, in this den of thieves?"</p>

<p>"Business of state," the Englishman laughed. "I have been with
Walsingham, her Majesty's Ambassador, and looked to start home
to-night. But your city is marvellous unwilling to part with her
guests. What's toward, Gaspard?"</p>

<p>"For me, supper," and he fell with zest to the broiled fowl he
had ordered. The other sent for another flask of the wine of Anjou,
observing that he had a plaguy thirst.</p>

<p>"I think," said Gaspard, at last raising his eyes from his food,
"that Paris will be unwholesome to-night for decent folk."</p>

<p>"There's a murrain of friars about," said Champernoun, leisurely
picking his teeth.</p>

<p>"The place hums like a bee-hive before swarming. Better get back
to your Ambassador, Gawain. There's sanctuary for you under his
cloak."</p>

<p>The Englishman made a pellet of bread and flicked it at the other's
face. "I may have to box your ears, old friend. Since when have
I taken to shirking a fracas? We were together at St. John d'Ulloa,
and you should know me better."</p>

<p>"Are you armed?" was Gaspard's next question.</p>

<p>Champernoun patted his sword. "Also there are pistols in my holsters."</p>

<p>"You have a horse, then?"</p>

<p>"Stabled within twenty yards. My rascally groom carried a message
to Sir Francis, and as he has been gone over an hour, I fear he
may have come to an untimely end."</p>

<p>"Then it will be well this night for us two to hold together.
I know our Paris mob and there is nothing crueller out of hell.
The pistolling of the Admiral de Coligny has given them a taste
of blood, and they may have a fancy for killing Luteranos. Two
such as you and I, guarding each other's backs, may see sport
before morning, and haply rid the world of a few miscreants. What
say you, camerado?"</p>

<p>"Good. But what account shall we give of ourselves if someone
questions us?"</p>

<p>"Why, we are Spanish esquires in the train of King Philip's Mission.
Our clothes are dark enough for the dons' fashion, and we both
speak their tongue freely. Behold in me the Senor Juan Gonzalez
de Mendoza, a poor knight of Castile, most earnest in the cause
of Holy Church."</p>

<p>"And I," said the Englishman with the gusto of a boy in a game,
"am named Rodriguez de Bobadilla. I knew the man, who is dead,
and his brother owes me ten crowns.... But if we fall in with
the Spanish Ambassador's gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"We will outface them."</p>

<p>"But if they detect the imposture?"</p>

<p>"Why, wring their necks. You are getting as cautious as an apple-wife,
Gawain."</p>

<p>"When I set out on a business I like to weigh it, that I may
know how much is to be charged to my own wits and how much I must
leave to God. To-night it would appear that the Almighty must
hold us very tight by the hand. Well, I am ready when I have I
drunk another cup of wine." He drew his sword and lovingly fingered
its edge, whistling all the while.</p>

<p>Gaspard went to the door and looked into the street. The city
was still strangely quiet. No roysterers swaggered home along
the pavements, no tramp of cuirassiers told of the passage of
a great man. But again he had the sense that hot fires were glowing
under these cold ashes. The mist had lifted and the stars were
clear, and over the dark mass of the Louvre a great planet burned.
The air was warm and stifling, and with a gesture of impatience
he slammed the door. By now he ought to have been drinking the
cool night on the downs beyond Oise.</p>

<p>The Englishman had called for another bottle, and it was served
in the empty tavern by the landlord himself. As the wine was brought
in the two fell to talking Spanish, at the sound of which the
man visibly started. His furtive sulky face changed to a sly friendliness.
"Your excellencies have come to town for the good work," he said,
sidling and bowing.</p>

<p>With a more than Spanish gravity Gaspard inclined his head.</p>

<p>"When does it start?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, that we common folk do not know. But there will be a signal.
Father Antoine has promised us a signal. But messieurs have not
badges. Perhaps they do not need them for their faces will be
known. Nevertheless for better security it might be well...."
He stopped with the air of a huckster crying his wares.</p>

<p>Gaspard spoke a word to Champernoun in Spanish. Then to the landlord:
"We are strangers, so must bow to the custom of your city. Have
you a man to send to the Hotel de Guise?"</p>

<p>"Why trouble the Duke, my lord?" was the answer. "See, I will
make you badges."</p>

<p>He tore up a napkin, and bound two white strips crosswise on
their left arms, and pinned a rag to their bonnets. "There, messieurs,
you are now wearing honest colours for all to see. It is well,
for presently blood will be hot and eyes blind."</p>

<p>Gaspard flung him a piece of gold, and he bowed himself out.
"Bonne fortune, lordships," were his parting words. "'Twill be
a great night for our Lord Christ and our Lord King."</p>

<p>"And his lord the Devil," said Champernoun. "What madness has
taken your good France? These are Spanish manners, and they sicken
me. Cockades and signals and such-like flummery!"</p>

<p>The other's face had grown sober. "For certain hell is afoot
to-night. It is the Admiral they seek. The Guisards and their
reiters and a pack of 'prentices maddened by sermons. I would
to God he were in the Palace with the King of Navarre and the
young Conde."</p>

<p>"But he is well guarded. I heard that a hundred Huguenots' swords
keep watch by his house."</p>

<p>"Maybe. But we of the religion are too bold and too trustful.
We are not match for the Guises and their Italian tricks. I think
we will go to Coligny's lodgings. Mounted, for a man on a horse
has an advantage if the mob are out!"</p>

<p>The two left the tavern, both sniffing the air as if they found
it tainted. The streets were filling now, and men were running
as if to a rendezvous, running hot-foot without speech and without
lights. Most wore white crosses on their left sleeve. The horses
waited, already saddled, in stables not a furlong apart, and it
was the work of a minute to bridle and mount. The two as if by
a common impulse halted their beasts at the mouth of the Rue du
Coq, and listened. The city was quiet on the surface, but there
was a low deep undercurrent of sound, like the soft purring of
a lion before he roars. The sky was bright with stars. There was
no moon, but over the Isle was a faint tremulous glow.</p>

<p>"It is long past midnight," said Gaspard; "in a little it will
be dawn."</p>

<p>Suddenly a shot cracked out. It was so sharp a sound among the
muffled noises that it stung the ear like a whip-lash. It came
from the dark mass of the Louvre, from somewhere beyond the Grand
Jardin. It was followed instantly by a hubbub far down the Rue
St. Honore and a glare kindled where that street joined the Rue
d'Arbre Sec.</p>

<p>"That way lies the Admiral," Gaspard cried. "I go to him," and
he clapped spurs to his horse.</p>

<p>But as his beast leapt forward another sound broke out, coming
apparently from above their heads. It was the clanging of a great
bell.</p>

<p>There is no music so dominant as bells. Their voice occupies
sky as well as earth, and they overwhelm the senses, so that a
man's blood must keep pace with their beat. They can suit every
part, jangling in wild joy, or copying the slow pace of sorrow,
or pealing in ordered rhythm, blithe but with a warning of mortality
in their cadence. But this bell played dance music. It summoned
to an infernal jig. Blood and fever were in its broken fall, hate
and madness and death.</p>

<p>Gaspard checked his plunging horse. "By God, it is from St. Germains
l'Auxerrois! The Palace church. The King is in it. It is a plot
against our faith. They have got the pick of us in their trap
and would make an end of us."</p>

<p>From every house and entry men and women and priests were pouring
to swell the army that pressed roaring eastwards. No one heeded
the two as they sat their horses like rocks in the middle of a
torrent.</p>

<p>"The Admiral is gone," said Gaspard with a sob in his voice.
"Our few hundred spears cannot stand against the King's army.
It remains for us to die with him."</p>

<p>Champernoun was cursing steadily in a mixture of English and
Spanish, good mouth-filling oaths delivered without heat. "Die
we doubtless shall, but not before we have trounced this bloody
rabble."</p>

<p>Still Gaspard did not move. "After to-night there will be no
gentlemen left in France, for we of the religion had all the breeding."
Then he laughed bitterly. "I mind Ribaut's last words, when Menendez
slew him. 'We are of earth,' says he, 'and to earth we must return,
and twenty years more or less can matter little!' That is our
case to-night, old friend."</p>

<p>"Maybe," said the Englishman. "But why talk of dying? You and
I are Spanish caballeros. Walsingham told me that the King hated
that nation, and that the Queen-mother loved it not, but it would
appear that now we are very popular in Paris."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, this is no time to play the Nicodemite. It is the
hour for public confession. I'm off to the dead Admiral to avenge
him on his assassins."</p>

<p>"Softly, Gaspard. You and I are old companions in war, and we
do not ride against a stone wall if there be a gate. It was not
thus that Gourgues avenged Ribaut at St. John's. Let us thank
God that we hold a master card in this game. We are two foxes
in a flock of angry roosters, and by the Lord's grace we will
take our toll of them. Cunning, my friend. A stratagem of war!
We stand outside this welter and, having only the cold passion
of revenge, can think coolly. God's truth, man, have we fought
the Indian and the Spaniard for nothing? Wily is the word. Are
we two gentlemen, who fear God, to be worsted by a rabble of Papegots
and Marannes?"</p>

<p>It was the word "Marannes," or, as we say, "halfcastes," which
brought conviction to Gaspard. Suddenly he saw his enemies as
less formidable, as something contemptible&mdash;things of a lower
breed, dupers who might themselves be duped.</p>

<p>"Faith, Gawain, you are the true campaigner. Let us forward,
and trust to Heaven to show us a road."</p>

<p>They galloped down the Rue St. Honore, finding an open space
in the cobbles of the centre, but at the turning into the Rue
d'Arbre Sec they met a block. A great throng with torches was
coming in on the right from the direction of the Bourbon and d'Alencon
hotels. Yet by pressing their horses with whip and spur, and by
that awe which the two tall dark cavaliers inspired even in a
mob which had lost its wits, they managed to make their way to
the entrance of the Rue de Bethisy. There they came suddenly upon
quiet.</p>

<p>The crowd was held back by mounted men who made a ring around
the gate of a high dark building. Inside its courtyard there were
cries and the rumour of fighting, but out in the street there
was silence. Every eye was turned to the archway, which was bright
as day with the glare of fifty lanterns.</p>

<p>The two rode straight to the ring of soldiers.</p>

<p>"Make way," Gaspard commanded, speaking with a foreign accent.</p>

<p>"For whom, monsieur?" one asked who seemed to be of a higher
standing than the rest.</p>

<p>"For the Ambassador of the King of Spain."</p>

<p>The man touched his bonnet and opened up a road by striking the
adjacent horses with the flat of his sword, and the two rode into
the ring so that they faced the archway. They could see a little
way inside the courtyard, where the light gleamed on armour. The
men there were no rabble, but Guise's Swiss.</p>

<p>A priest came out, wearing the Jacobin habit, one of those preaching
friars who had been fevering the blood of Paris. The crowd behind
the men-at-arms knew him, for even in its absorption it sent up
shouts of greeting. He flitted like a bat towards Gaspard and
Champernoun and peered up at them. His face was lean and wolfish,
with cruel arrogant eyes.</p>

<p>"Hail, father!" said Gaspard in Spanish. "How goes the good work?"</p>

<p>He replied in the same tongue. "Bravely, my children. But this
is but the beginning. Are you girt and ready for the harvesting?"</p>

<p>"We are ready," said Gaspard. His voice shook with fury, but
the Jacobin took it for enthusiasm. He held up his hand in blessing
and fluttered back to the archway.</p>

<p>From inside the courtyard came the sound of something falling,
and then a great shout. The mob had jumped to a conclusion. "That
is the end of old Toothpick," a voice cried, using the Admiral's
nickname. There was a wild surge round the horsemen, but the ring
held. A body of soldiers poured out of the gate, with blood on
their bare swords. Among them was one tall fellow all in armour,
with a broken plume on his bonnet. His face was torn and disfigured
and he was laughing horribly. The Jacobin rushed to embrace him,
and the man dropped on his knees to receive a blessing.</p>

<p>"Behold our hero," the friar cried. "His good blade has rid us
of the arch-heretic," and the mob took up the shout.</p>

<p>Gaspard was cool now. His fury had become a cold thing like a
glacier.</p>

<p>"I know him!" he whispered to Champernoun. "He is the Italian
Petrucci. He is our first quarry."</p>

<p>"The second will be that damned friar," was the Englishman's
answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly the ring of men-at-arms drew inward as a horseman rode
out of the gate followed by half a dozen attendants. He was a
tall young man, very noble to look upon, with a flushed face like
a boy warm from the game of paume. His long satin coat was richly
embroidered, and round his neck hung the thick gold collar of
some Order. He was wiping a stain from his sleeve with a fine
lawn handkerchief.</p>

<p>"What is that thing gilt like a chalice?" whispered Champernoun.</p>

<p>"Henry of Guise," said Gaspard.</p>

<p>The Duke caught sight of the two men in the centre of the ring.
The lanterns made the whole place bright and he could see every
detail of their dress and bearing. He saluted them courteously.</p>

<p>"We make your Grace our compliments," said Gaspard. "We are of
the household of the Ambassador of Spain, and could not rest indoors
when great deeds were being done in the city."</p>

<p>The young man smiled pleasantly. There was a boyish grace in
his gesture.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, gentlemen. I would have every good Catholic
in Europe see with his own eyes the good work of this Bartholomew's
day. I would ask you to ride with me, but I leave the city in
pursuit of the Count of Montgomery, who is rumoured to have escaped.
There will be much for you to see on this happy Sunday. But stay!
You are not attended, and our streets are none too safe for strangers.
Presently the Huguenots will counterfeit our white cross, and
blunders may be made by the overzealous."</p>

<p>He unclasped the jewel which hung at the end of his chain. It
was a little Agnus of gold and enamel, surmounting a lozenge-shaped
shield charged with an eagle.</p>

<p>"Take this," he said, "and return it to me when the work is over.
Show it if any man dares to question you. It is a passport from
Henry of Guise.... And now forward," he cried to his followers.
"Forward for Montgomery and the Vidame."</p>

<p>The two looked after the splendid figure. "That bird is in fine
feather," said Champernoun.</p>

<p>Gaspard's jaw was very grim. "Some day he will lie huddled under
the assassin's knife. He will die as he has made my chief die,
and his body will be cast to the dog's.... But he has given me
a plan," and he spoke in his companion's ear.</p>

<p>The Englishman laughed. His stolidity had been slow to quicken,
but his eyes were now hot and he had altogether ceased to swear.</p>

<p>"First let me get back to Walsingham's lodging. I have a young
kinsman there, they call him Walter Raleigh, who would dearly
love this venture."</p>

<p>"Tut, man, be serious. We play a desperate game, and there is
no place for boys in it. We have Guise's jewel, and by the living
God we will use it. My mark is Petrucci."</p>

<p>"And the priest," said Champernoun.</p>

<p>The crowd in the Rue de Bethisy was thinning, as bands of soldiers,
each with its tail of rabble, moved off to draw other coverts.
There was fighting still in many houses, and on the roof-tops
as the pale dawn spread could be seen the hunt for fugitives.
Torches and lanterns still flickered obscenely, and the blood
in the gutters shone sometimes golden in their glare and sometimes
spread drab and horrid in the waxing daylight.</p>

<p>The Jacobin stood at their elbow. "Follow me, my lords of Spain,"
he cried. "No friends of God and the Duke dare be idle this happy
morn. Follow, and I will show you wonders."</p>

<p>He led them east to where a broader street ran to the river.</p>

<p>"Somewhere here lies Teligny," he croaked. "Once he is dead the
second head is lopped from the dragon of Babylon. Oh that God
would show us where Conde and Navarre are hid, for without them
our task is incomplete."</p>

<p>There was a great crowd about the door of one house, and into
it the Jacobin fought his way with prayers and threats. Some Huguenot
&mdash;Teligny it might be&mdash;was cornered there, but in the narrow
place only a few could join in the hunt, and the hunters, not
to be impeded by the multitude, presently set a guard at the street
door. The mob below was already drunk with blood, and found waiting
intolerable; but it had no leader and foamed aimlessly about the
causeway. There were women in it with flying hair like Maenads,
who shrilled obscenities, and drunken butchers and watermen and
grooms who had started out for loot and ended in sheer lust of
slaying, and dozens of broken desperadoes and led-captains who
looked on the day as their carnival. But to the mob had come one
of those moments of indecision when it halted and eddied like
a whirlpool.</p>

<p>Suddenly in its midst appeared two tall horsemen.</p>

<p>"Men of Paris," cried Gaspard with that masterful voice which
is born of the deep seas. "You see this jewel. It was given me
an hour back by Henry of Guise."</p>

<p>A ruffian examined it. "Ay," he murmured with reverence, "it
is our Duke's. I saw it on his breast before Coligny's house."</p>

<p>The mob was all ears. "I have the Duke's command," Gaspard went
on. "He pursues Montgomery and the Vidame of Chartres. Coligny
is dead. Teligny in there is about to die. But where are all the
others? Where is La Rochefoucault? Where is Rosny? Where is Grammont?
Where, above all, are the young Conde and the King of Navarre?"</p>

<p>The names set the rabble howling. Every eye was on the speaker.</p>

<p>Gaspard commanded silence. "I will tell you. The Huguenots are
cunning as foxes. They planned this very day to seize the King
and make themselves masters of France. They have copied your badge,"
and he glanced towards his left arm. "Thousands of them are waiting
for revenge, and before it is full day they will be on you. You
will not know them, you will take them for your friends, and you
will have your throats cut before you find out your error."</p>

<p>A crowd may be wolves one moment and chickens the next, for cruelty
and fear are cousins. A shiver of apprehension went through the
soberer part. One drunkard who shouted was clubbed on the head
by his neighbour. Gaspard saw his chance.</p>

<p>"My word to you&mdash;the Duke's word&mdash;is to forestall this devilry.
Follow me, and strike down every band of white-badged Huguenots.
For among them be sure is the cub of Navarre."</p>

<p>It was the leadership which the masterless men wanted. Fifty
swords were raised, and a shout went up which shook the windows
of that lodging where even now Teligny was being done to death.
With the two horsemen at their head the rabble poured westwards
towards the Rue d'Arbre Sec and the Louvre, for there in the vicinity
of the Palace were the likeliest coverts.</p>

<p>"Now Heaven send us Petrucci," said Gaspard. "Would that the
Little Man had been alive and with us! This would have been a
ruse after his own heart."</p>

<p>"I think the great Conde would have specially misliked yon monk,"
said the Englishman.</p>

<p>"Patience, Gawain. One foe at a time. My heart tells me that
you will get your priest."</p>

<p>The streets, still dim in the dawn, were thickly carpeted with
dead. The mob kicked and befouled the bodies, and the bravos in
sheer wantonness spiked them with their swords. There were women
there, and children, lying twisted on the causeway. Once a fugitive
darted out of an entry, to be brought down by a butcher's axe.</p>

<p>"I have never seen worse in the Indies," and Champernoun shivered.
"My stomach turns. For heaven's sake let us ride down this rabble!"</p>

<p>"Patience," said Gaspard, his eyes hard as stones. "Cursed be
he that putteth his hand to the plough and then turns back."</p>

<p>They passed several small bodies of Catholic horse, which they
greeted with cheers. That was in the Rue des Poulies; and at the
corner where it abutted on the quay before the Hotel de Bourbon,
a ferret-faced man ran blindly into them. Gaspard caught him and
drew him to his horse's side, for he recognised the landlord of
the tavern where he had supped.</p>

<p>"What news, friend?" he asked.</p>

<p>The man was in an anguish of terror, but he recognised his former
guest.</p>

<p>"There is a band on the quay," he stammered. "They are mad and
do not know a Catholic when they see him. They would have killed
me, had not the good Father Antoine held them till I made off."</p>

<p>"Who leads them?" Gaspard asked, having a premonition.</p>

<p>"A tall man in crimson with a broken plume."</p>

<p>"How many?"</p>

<p>"Maybe a hundred, and at least half are men-at-arms."</p>

<p>Gaspard turned to Champernoun.</p>

<p>"We have found our quarry," he said.</p>

<p>Then he spoke to his following, and noted with comfort that it
was now some hundred strong, and numbered many swords. "There
is a Huguenot band before us," he cried. "They wear our crosses,
and this honest fellow has barely escaped from them. They are
less than three score. On them, my gallant lads, before they increase
their strength, and mark specially the long man in red, for he
is the Devil. It may be Navarre is with them."</p>

<p>The mob needed no second bidding. Their chance had come, and
they swept along with a hoarse mutter more fearful than any shouting.</p>

<p>"Knee to knee, Gawain," said Gaspard, "as at St. John d'Ulloa.
Remember, Petrucci is for me."</p>

<p>The Italian's band, crazy with drink and easy slaying, straggled
across the wide quay and had no thought of danger till the two
horsemen were upon them. The songs died on their lips as they
saw bearing down on them an avenging army. The scared cries of
"The Huguenots!" "Montgomery!"  were to Gaspard's following a
confirmation of their treachery. The swords of the bravos and
the axes and knives of the Parisian mob made havoc with the civilian
rabble, but the men-at-arms recovered themselves and in knots
fought a stout battle. But the band was broken at the start by
the two grim horsemen who rode through it as through meadow grass,
their blades falling terribly, and then turned and cut their way
back. Yet a third time they turned, and in that last mowing they
found their desire. A tall man in crimson appeared before them.
Gaspard flung his reins to Champernoun and in a second was on
the ground, fighting with a fury that these long hours had been
stifled. Before his blade the Italian gave ground till he was
pinned against the wall of the Bourbon hotel. His eyes were staring
with amazement and dawning fear. "I am a friend," he stammered
in broken French and was answered in curt Spanish. Presently his
guard weakened and Gaspard gave him the point in his heart. As
he drooped to the ground, his conqueror bent over him. "The Admiral
is avenged," he said. "Tell your master in hell that you died
at the hands of Coligny's kinsman."</p>

<p>Gaspard remounted, and, since the fight had now gone eastward,
they rode on to the main gate of the Louvre, where they met a
company of the royal Guards coming out to discover the cause of
an uproar so close to the Palace. He told his tale of the Spanish
Embassy and showed Guise's jewel. "The streets are full of Huguenots
badged as Catholics. His Majesty will be well advised to quiet
the rabble or he will lose some trusty servants."</p>

<p>In the Rue du Coq, now almost empty, the two horsemen halted.</p>

<p>"We had better be journeying, Gawain. Guise's jewel will open
the gates. In an hour's time all Paris will be on our trail."</p>

<p>"There is still that priest," said Champernoun doggedly. He was
breathing heavily, and his eyes were light and daring. Like all
his countrymen, he was slow to kindle but slower to cool.</p>

<p>"In an hour, if we linger here, we shall be at his mercy. Let
us head for the St. Antoine gate."</p>

<p>The jewel made their way easy, for through that gate Henry of
Guise himself had passed in the small hours. "Half an hour ago,"
the lieutenant of the watch told them, "I opened to another party
which bore the Duke's credentials. They were for Amiens to spread
the good news."</p>

<p>"Had they a priest with them?"</p>

<p>"Ay, a Jacobin monk, who cried on them to hasten and not spare
their horses. He said there was much to do in the north."</p>

<p>"I think the holy man spoke truth," said Gaspard, and they rode
into open country.</p>

<p>They broke their fast on black bread and a cup of wine at the
first inn, where a crowd of frightened countrymen were looking
in the direction of Paris. It was now about seven o'clock, and
a faint haze, which promised heat, cloaked the ground. From it
rose the towers and high-peaked roofs of the city, insubstantial
as a dream.</p>

<p>"Eaucourt by the waters!" sighed Gaspard. "That the same land
should hold that treasure and this foul city!"</p>

<p>Their horses, rested and fed, carried them well on the north
road, but by ten o'clock they had overtaken no travellers, save
a couple of servants, on sorry nags, who wore the Vidame of Amiens'
livery. They were well beyond Oise ere they saw in the bottom
of a grassy vale a little knot of men.</p>

<p>"I make out six," said Champernoun, who had a falcon's eye. "Two
priests and four men-at-arms. Reasonable odds, such as I love.
Faith, that monk travels fast!"</p>

<p>"I do not think there will be much fighting," said Gaspard.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later they rode abreast of the party, which at
first had wheeled round on guard, and then had resumed its course
at the sight of the white armlets. It was as Champernoun had said.
Four lusty arquebusiers escorted the Jacobin. But the sixth man
was no priest. He was a Huguenot minister whom Gaspard remembered
with Conde's army, an elderly frail man bound with cruel thongs
to a horse's back and his legs tethered beneath its belly.</p>

<p>Recognition awoke in the Jacobin's eye. "Ah, my lords of Spain!
What brings you northward?"</p>

<p>Gaspard was by his side, while Champernoun a pace behind was
abreast the minister.</p>

<p>"To see the completion of the good work begun this morning."</p>

<p>"You have come the right road. I go to kindle the north to a
holy emulation. That heretic dog behind is a Picard, and I bring
him to Amiens that he may perish there as a warning to his countrymen."</p>

<p>"So?" said Gaspard, and at the word the Huguenot's horse, pricked
stealthily by Champernoun's sword, leaped forward and dashed in
fright up the hill, its rider sitting stiff as a doll in his bonds.
The Jacobin cried out and the soldiers made as if to follow, but
Gaspard's voice checked them. "Let be. The beast will not go far.
I have matters of importance to discuss with this reverend father."</p>

<p>The priest's face sharpened with a sudden suspicion. "Your manners
are somewhat peremptory, sir Spaniard. But speak and let us get
on."</p>

<p>"I have only the one word. I told you we had come north to see
the fruition of the good work, and you approved. We do not mean
the same. By good work I mean that about sunrise I slew with this
sword the man Petrucci, who slew the Admiral. By its fruition
I mean that I have come to settle with you."</p>

<p>"You...?" the other stammered.</p>

<p>"I am Gaspard de Laval, a kinsman and humble follower of Goligny."</p>

<p>The Jacobin was no coward. "Treason!" he cried. "A Huguenot!
Cut them down, my men," and he drew a knife from beneath his robe.</p>

<p>But Gaspard's eye and voice checked the troopers. He held in
his hand the gold trinket. "I have no quarrel with you. This is
the passport of your leader, the Duke. I show it to you, and if
you are questioned about this day's work you can reply that you
took your orders from him who carried Guise's jewel. Go your ways
back to Paris if you would avoid trouble."</p>

<p>Two of the men seemed to waver, but the maddened cry of the priest
detained them. "They seek to murder me," he screamed. "Would you
desert God's Church and burn in torment for ever?" He hurled himself
on Gaspard, who caught his wrist so that the knife tinkled on
the high road while the man overbalanced himself and fell. The
next second the mellay had begun.</p>

<p>It did not last long. The troopers were heavy fellows, cumbrously
armed, who, even with numbers on their side, stood little chance
against two swift swordsmen, who had been trained to fight together
against odds. One Gaspard pulled from the saddle so that he lay
senseless on the ground. One Champernoun felled with a sword cut
of which no morion could break the force. The two others turned
tail and fled, and the last seen of them was a dust cloud on the
road to Paris.</p>

<p>Gaspard had not drawn his sword. They stood by the bridge of
a little river, and he flung Guise's jewel far into its lilied
waters.</p>

<p>"A useful bauble," he smiled, "but its purpose is served."</p>

<p>The priest stood in the dust, with furious eyes burning in an
ashen face.</p>

<p>"What will you do with me?"</p>

<p>"This has been your day of triumph, father. I would round it
off worthily by helping you to a martyr's crown. Gawain," and
he turned to his companion, "go up the road and fetch me the rope
which binds the minister."</p>

<p>The runaway was feeding peaceably by the highway. Champernoun
cut the old man's bonds, and laid him fainting on the grass. He
brought back with him a length of stout cord.</p>

<p>"Let the brute live," he said. "Duck him and truss him up, but
don't dirty your hands with him. I'd as lief kill a woman as a
monk."</p>

<p>But Gaspard's smiling face was a rock. "This is no Englishman's
concern. To-day's shame is France's and a Frenchman alone can
judge it. Innocent blood is on this man's hands, and it is for
me to pay the first instalment of justice. The rest I leave to
God."</p>

<p>So when an hour later the stunned troopers recovered their senses
they found a sight which sent them to their knees to patter prayers.
For over the arch of the bridge dangled the corpse of the Jacobin.
And on its breast it bore a paper setting forth that this deed
had been done by Gaspard de Laval, and the Latin words "O si sic
omnes!"</p>

<p>Meantime far up in the folds of the Santerre a little party was
moving through the hot afternoon. The old Huguenot, shaken still
by his rough handling, rode as if in a trance. Once he roused
himself and asked about the monk.</p>

<p>"I hanged him like a mad dog," said Gaspard.</p>

<p>The minister shook his head. "Violence will not cure violence."</p>

<p>"Nay, but justice may follow crime. I am no Nicodemite. This
day I have made public confession of my faith, and abide the consequences.
From this day I am an exile from France so long as it pleases
God to make His Church an anvil for the blows of His enemies."</p>

<p>"I, too, am an exile," said the old man. "If I come safe to Calais
I shall take ship for Holland and find shelter with the brethren
there. You have preserved my life for a few more years in my master's
vineyard. You say truly, young sir, that God's Church is now an
anvil, but remember for your consolation that it is an anvil which
has worn out many hammers."</p>

<p>Late in the evening they came over a ridge and looked down on
a shallow valley all green and gold in the last light. A slender
river twined by alder and willow through the meadows. Gaspard
reined in his horse and gazed on the place with a hand shading
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I have slain a man to my hurt," he said. "See, there are my
new fishponds half made, and the herb garden, and the terrace
that gets the morning sun. There is the lawn which I called my
quarter-deck, the place to walk of an evening. Farewell, my little
grey dwelling."</p>

<p>Champernoun laid a kindly hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"We will find you the mate of it in Devon, old friend," he said.</p>

<p>But Gaspard was not listening. "Eaucourt by the waters," he repeated
like the refrain of a song, and his eyes were full of tears.</p>
