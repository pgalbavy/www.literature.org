<p>On the river bank at the outskirts of Marlin Town that afternoon so
primitive was the aspect of life that it seemed appropriate to say in
Scriptural form: "A great multitude was gathered together." The haze of
Indian summer lay veil-like and sweetly brooding along the ridged and
purple horizon. The mountainsides flared with torch-like fires of
autumnal splendor--and the quaint old town with its shingled roofs and
its ox-teams in the streets, lay sleepily quiet in the mid-distance.
</p>
<p>Toward the crudely constructed rostrum of the two preachers in
long-tailed coats, strained the eyes of the throng, pathetically solemn
in their tense earnestness. Men bent with labor and women broken by
toil and perennial child-bearing; children whose faces bore the stupid
vacuity of in-bred degeneracy; other children alert and keen, needing
only the chance they would never have. It was a sea of unlettered
humanity in jeans and calico, in hodden-gray and homespun--seeking a
sign from Heaven, less to save their immortal souls than to break the
tedium of their mortal weariness.
</p><p>Henderson stood with folded arms beside the preacher whose pattern of
faith differed from that of the two exhorters he had come to hear.
Blossom's cheeks were abloom and her eyes, back of their grave
courtesy, rippled with a suppressed amusement. To her mind, her father
exemplified true ministry and these others were interesting quacks, but
to Bear Cat, standing at her elbow, they were performers whose clownish
antics savored of charlatanism--and who capitalized the illiteracy of
their hearers. Lone Stacy was there, too, but with a mask-like
impassiveness of feature that betrayed neither the trend nor color of
his thought.
</p><p>Not far distant, though above and beyond the press of the crowd, stood
the Towers chief, and his four guardians, and shifting here and there,
sauntered others of his henchmen, swinging rifles at their sides and
watchful, through their seeming carelessness, for any signal from him.
Once for a moment Henderson caught a glimpse of Ratler Webb's skulking
figure with a vindictive glance bent upon Bear Cat--but in another
instant he had disappeared.
</p><p>The first of the exhorters had swung into the full tide of his
discourse. His arm swung flail-like. His eyes rolled in awe-provoking
frenzy. His voice leaped and fell after the fashion of a troubled wind
and through his pauses there came back to him the occasional low wail
of some almost convinced sinner. Gradually, under this invocation of
passionate phrase and "holy-tone," the tide of crowd-psychology was
mounting to hysteria.
</p><p>Between sentences and phrases the preacher interlarded his sermon with
grunts of emotion-laden "Oh's" and "Ah's."
</p><p>"Fer them thet denies ther faith, oh brethren--Oh! Ah! ther pits of
hell air yawnin' wide an' red! Almighty God air jest a-bidin' His time
afore He kicks 'em inter ther ragin', fiery furnace an' ther caldrons
of molten brimstone, Oh! Ah!"
</p><p>The speaker rolled his eyes skyward until only their whites remained
visible. With his upflung fingers clawing talon-wise at the air he
froze abruptly out of crescendo into grotesque and motionless silence.
</p><p>Through the close-ranked listeners ran a shuddering quaver, followed by
a sighing sound like rising wind which in turn broke into a shrieking
chorus of "Amens!" and "Hallelujahs!"
</p><p>The simple throng was an instrument upon which he played. Their naive
credulity was his keyboard. Joel Fulkerson's eyes were mirrors of
silent pain as he looked on and listened. "Lord God," he said in his
heart, "I have toiled a lifetime in Thy service and men have hardened
their hearts. Yet to these who harangue them in the market-place, they
give ear--ay, and shed abundant tears."
</p><p>Then the long-coated, long-haired preacher having exhausted the
dramatic value of the pause, launched himself afresh.
</p><p>"Ther Lord hes said thet ef a man hes faith, even so sizeable es a
mustard seed, he shell say ter thet mounting, 'move' an' hit'll plumb
move! Oh-Ah!"
</p><p>Once more the tone dwindled to a haunting whisper, then vaulted into
sudden thunder.
</p><p>"Brethren, I <u>hev</u> sich faith! Right now I could say ter thet thar
mounting thet's stood thar since ther commencement of time, 'Move,' an'
hit would roll away like a cloud afore ther wind! Right now afore ye
all, I could walk down ter thet river an' cross hits deep waters
dry-shod!"
</p><p>Jerry Henderson, looking with amusement about the overwrought crowd,
saw no spirit of skepticism on any untutored face, only a
superstitiously deep earnestness everywhere.
</p><p>Now even the hysterical "Amens!" which had been like responses to a
crazed litany were left unspoken. The hearers sat in a strained
silence; a voicelessness of bated breath--as if awed into a trance.
That stillness held hypnotically and long.
</p><p>Then like a bomb bursting in a cathedral came a clear voice, frankly
scornful and full of challenge from somewhere on the fringe of the
congregation.
</p><p>"All right--let's see ye do hit! Let's see ye walk over ther waters
dry-shod!"
</p><p>Petrified, breathlessly shocked, men and women held for a little space
their stunned poses, so that a margin of silence gave emphasis to the
sacrilege. Then, gradually gathering volume, from a gasp to a murmur,
from a murmur to a sullen roar, spoke the voice of resentment. Some
indignant person, wanting full comprehension and seeking only a
Biblical form of expression, shouted loudly: "Crucify him!" and
following that, pandemonium drowned out individual utterances.
</p><p>Kinnard Towers did not share in the general excitement. He only bit
liberally from his tobacco plug and remarked: "I reckon Bear Cat
Stacy's drunk ergin." But Bear Cat Stacy, standing at the point from
which he had interrupted the meeting, looked on with blazing eyes and
said nothing.
</p><p>"Now ye've done gone an' made another damn' fool of yourself!"
whispered his father hoarsely in his ear. "Ye've done disturbed public
worship--an' as like es not hit'll end in bloodshed."
</p><p>Turner made no reply. His fingers were tense as they gripped biceps
equally set. The fury of his face died into quiet seriousness. If the
howling mob destroyed him he had, at least, flung down the gauntlet to
these impostors who sought to victimize the helplessness of ignorance.
</p><p>About him surged a crowd with shuffling feet and murmuring undertones;
a crowd that moved and swayed like milling cattle in a corral, awaiting
only leadership for violence. Then abruptly a pistol shot ripped out,
followed instantly by another, and the edges of the throng began an
excited eddying of stampede.
</p><p>The babel of high voices, questioning, volunteering unreliable
information, swelling into a deep-throated outcry, became inarticulate.
The first impression was that some one in a moment of fanaticism had
conceived himself called upon to punish sacrilege. The second had it
that Bear Cat Stacy himself, not satisfied with his impious beginnings,
was bent on carrying his disturbance to a more sweeping conclusion.
Neither assumption was accurate.
</p><p>A few moments before Bear Cat's outbreak, Kinnard Towers had whispered
to Black Tom Carmichael, indicating with a glance of his eye the
skulking figure of Ratler Webb, "Watch him."
</p><p>Nodding in response to that whisper, Black Tom had strolled casually
over, stationing himself directly behind Bear Cat. His face wore a calm
benignity and his arms were crossed on his breast so peacefully that
one would hardly have guessed the right hand caressed the grip of an
automatic pistol and that the pistol had already been drawn half free
from its hidden holster.
</p><p>It happened that Ratler's hand, in his coat pocket, was also nursing a
weapon. Ratler was biding his time. He had read into every face a
contemptuous mockery for his surrender of the road to Turner Stacy that
morning. In his disordered brain a fixed idea had festered into the
mandate of a single word: "Revengeance."
</p><p>Then when Bear Cat had drawn down on himself the wrath of an outraged
camp-meeting Ratler thought his opportunity knocked. The crowd began to
shift and move so that the focus of men's impressions was blurred.
Availing himself of that momentary confusion, he stole a little nearer
and shifted sidewise so that he might see around Black Tom Carmichael's
bulking shoulders. He glanced furtively about him. Kinnard Towers was
looking off abstractedly--another way. No one at front or back seemed
to be noticing him.
</p><p>Ratler Webb's arm flashed up with a swiftness that was sheer
slight-of-hand and Black Tom's vigilant eye caught a dull glint of blue
metal. With a legerdemain superlatively quick, Carmichael's hand, too,
flashed from his breast. His pistol spoke, and Ratler's shot was a
harmless one into the air. When the startled faces turned that way
Ratler was staggering back with a flesh wound and Black Tom was once
more standing calmly by. On the ground between his feet and Bear Cat
Stacy's, as near to the one as the other, lay a smoking pistol.
</p><p>"Bear Cat's done shot Ratler Webb!" yelled a treble voice, and again
the agitated crowd broke into a confused roar.
</p><p>Turner bent quickly toward Blossom and spoke in a tense whisper. "Leave
hyar fer God's sake. This hain't no place fer <u>you</u> right now!"
</p><p>The girl's eyes leaped into instant and Amazonian fire and, as her chin
came up, she answered in a low voice of unamenable obduracy:
</p><p>"So long es <u>you</u> stays, I stays, too. I don't aim ter run away."
</p><p>The crowd was edging in, not swiftly but sullenly and there were faces
through whose snarls showed such yellow fangs as suggested a wolf pack.
Here and there one could see the flash of a drawn pistol or the glint
of a "dirk-knife."
</p><p>Then, coming reluctantly, yet keyed to his hard duty by the
consciousness of Kinnard Towers' scrutiny, Jud White, the town marshal,
arrived and laid a hand on Bear Cat's shoulder.
</p><p>"I reckon," he said, licking his lips, "ye'll hev ter come ter ther
jail-house with me, Bear Cat."
</p><p>"What fer, Jud?" inquired Turner quietly, though the tawny fire was
burning in his eyes. "I didn't shoot them shoots."
</p><p>"Folks ses ye did, Bear Cat."
</p><p>"Them folks lies."
</p><p>A sudden crescendo of violent outcry interrupted their debate. Through
it came shouts of: "Kill ther blasphemer!" "String him up!"
</p><p>With a sudden flash of sardonic humor in his eyes Bear Cat suggested
softly: "I reckon, Jud, hit's yore duty ter kinderly protect yore
prisoner, hain't hit?"
</p><p>A cold sweat broke out over the face of the town officer and as he
stood irresolute, the crowd, in which mob passion was spreading like
flames in dry grass, swayed in a brief indicision--and in that moment
Brother Fulkerson stood forward, raising his arms above his head.
</p><p>"Brethren," he cried in a voice that trembled, "I implores ye ter
listen ter me. I hain't never lied ter ye afore now, an' unless my
labors hev been fer naught, I des'arves ter be h'arkened to."
</p><p>Curiosity prevailed and the din subsided enough to let the evangelist
be heard.
</p><p>"I was standin' right hyar by Bear Cat Stacy when them shots war
fired," Fulkerson went on earnestly, "an' I swears ter ye, with
Almighty God fer my witness, thet he didn't hev nothin' more ter do
with hit then what I did."
</p><p>As he paused a sarcastic voice from the crowd demanded: "Will ye swear
he didn't aim ter break up ther meetin' neither?"
</p><p>"Let me answer that question," shouted Bear Cat Stacy, stepping
defiantly forward.
</p><p>There was peril in that interruption, and the young man knew it. He
realized that only a savage, cat-and-mouse spirit of prolonging
excitement had, so far, held in leash the strained wrath of a crowd
worked already to frenzy. But the mountaineer loves oratory of any
sort, and a lynching need not be hurried through. They would have
listened to Brother Fulkerson--but would they give <u>him</u> a hearing?
</p><p>For a moment Bear Cat stood there, sweeping them with a gaze that held
no fear and a great deal of open scorn. The effrontery of his attitude,
the blaze of his eyes and even the rumors of his charmed life were
having their effects. Then he spoke:
</p><p>"Any man thet charges me with blasphemin' lies! Brother Fulkerson hes
done toiled his life away amongst ye--an' ye skeercely heeds his
preachin'. I believes these fellers thet calls themselves God's
sarvents ter be false prophets. Instid of the light of knowledge, they
offers ye ther smoke of ign'rance. They hev 'lowed thet they kin work
miracles. Ef they kin, why don't they? Ef they kain't they lies an'
sich a lie as thet air blasphemy. I called on 'em ter make good thar
brag--an' now I calls on 'em ergin! Let's see a miracle."
</p><p>He ended and, as the voice of the crowd rose once more, this time a
shade less unanimous in tone, a strange thing happened. About Bear Cat
Stacy and the town marshal appeared a little knot of rifle-armed men,
and coming to their front, Kinnard Towers bellowed:
</p><p>"Men! Listen!"
</p><p>They looked at his face and his guns--and listened.
</p><p>"I was standin' whar I could see this whole matter," asserted Towers.
"Bear Cat Stacy never drawed nor fired no weepin. My friend Tom
Carmichael shot Ratler Webb in <u>dee</u>fense of his life. Ratler shot a
shoot, too. I counsels ther town marshal not ter jail Bear Cat Stacy,
an' I counsels ther rest of ye ter settle down ergin ter quiet. Mebby
Bear Cat oughtn't ter hev interrupted ther preachin', but whoever aims
ter harm him must needs take him away from me!"
</p><p>Over the sea of faces ran a wave of amazement sounding out in a
prolonged murmur. Here was the incredible situation of a Towers leader
vouching for and protecting a Stacy chieftain. Feudal blood tingled
with the drama of that realization.
</p><p>Varied excitements were breaking the drab monotony of life to-day for
Marlin Town! A voice shouted, "I reckon Ratler needs a leetle shootin'
anyhow," and the sally was greeted with laughter. The tide had turned.
</p><p>On Bear Cat's face, though, as he wheeled to his powerful rescuer was a
mingling of emotions; surprise blended with a frown of unwillingly
incurred obligation.
</p><p>"I'm obleeged ter ye, Kinnard Towers," he said dubiously, "but I reckon
I could hev keered fer myself. I hain't seekin' ter be beholden ter
ye."
</p><p>The florid man laughed. "Ye hain't none beholden ter me, son," was his
hearty disclaimer. "A man likes ter testify ter ther truth when he sees
somebody falsely accused, thet's all."
</p><p>Brother Fulkerson and his daughter started back to Little Slippery that
same evening, meaning to spend the night with friends a few miles from
town. After bidding them farewell at the edge of the town, Henderson
and Bear Cat strolled back together toward the shack tavern where Jerry
had his quarters. The younger man's eyes were brooding, and suddenly he
broke out in vehement insurgency:
</p><p>"I reckon I was a fool down thar by ther river--but I couldn't hold my
peace deespite all my effort. Hyar's a land dry-rottin' away in
ign'rance--an' no man raisin' his voice fer its real betterment." His
tone dropped and became gentle with an undernote of pain. "I looked at
Blossom, standin' thar, with a right ter ther best thar is--an' I could
foresee ther misery an' tribulation of all this makin' her old in a few
years. I jest had ter speak out."
</p><p>Henderson only nodded. He, too, had been thinking of Blossom, and he
realized that wherever he went, when he left the hills, there was going
to be an emptiness in his life. He was not going to be able to forget
her. The shield which he had always held before his heart had failed to
protect him against the dancing eyes of a girl who could not even speak
correct English--the tilted chin of a girl who would not flee from a
mob.
</p><p>"Turner," he said, drawing himself together with an effort, "come over
to the hotel with me. I'm going down to Louisville for a few days, and
I want you to help me make out a list of books for Blossom and
yourself."
</p><p>Turner's eyes lighted. One man at least sought to be, in so far as he
could, a torch-bearer.
</p><p>As they sat talking of titles and authors the boy's face softened and
glowed with imagination. Off through the window the peaks bulked
loftily against the sunset's ash-of-rose. Both men looked toward the
west and a silence fell between them, then they heard hurried footsteps
and, without knocking, Jud White the town marshal, flung open the door.
</p><p>"Bear Cat," he announced briefly, "yore paw bade me fotch ye ter him
direct. The revenue hes got him in ther jail-house, charged with
blockadin'."
