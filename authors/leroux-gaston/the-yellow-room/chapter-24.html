<p>Mademoiselle Stangerson had been almost murdered for the second
time. Unfortunately, she was in too weak a state to bear the severer
injuries of this second attack as well as she had those of the
first. She had received three wounds in the breast from the murderer’s
knife, and she lay long between life and death. Her strong physique,
however, saved her; but though she recovered physically it was
found that her mind had been affected. The slightest allusion
to the terrible incident sent her into delirium, and the arrest
of Robert Darzac which followed on the day following the tragic
death of the keeper seemed to sink her fine intelligence into
complete melancholia.</p>

<p>Robert Darzac arrived at the chateau towards half-past nine.
I saw him hurrying through the park, his hair and clothes in disorder
and his face a deadly white. Rouletabille and I were looking out
of a window in the gallery. He saw us, and gave a despairing cry:
"I’m too late!"</p>

<p>Rouletabille answered: "She lives!"</p>

<p>A minute later Darzac had gone into Mademoiselle Stangerson’s
room and, through the door, we could hear his heart-rending sobs.</p>

<p>"There’s a fate about this place!" groaned Rouletabille. "Some
infernal gods must be watching over the misfortunes of this family!
&mdash;If I had not been drugged, I should have saved Mademoiselle
Stangerson. I should have silenced him forever. And the keeper
would not have been killed!"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac came in to speak with us. His distress was terrible.
Rouletabille told him everything: his preparations for Mademoiselle
Stangerson’s safety; his plans for either capturing or for disposing
of the assailant for ever; and how he would have succeeded had
it not been for the drugging.</p>

<p>"If only you had trusted me!" said the young man, in a low tone.
"If you had but begged Mademoiselle Stangerson to confide in me!
&mdash;But, then, everybody here distrusts everybody else, the
daughter distrusts her father, and even her lover. While you ask
me to protect her she is doing all she can to frustrate me. That
was why I came on the scene too late!"</p>

<p>At Monsieur Robert Darzac’s request Rouletabille described the
whole scene. Leaning on the wall, to prevent himself from falling,
he had made his way to Mademoiselle Stangerson’s room, while we
were running after the supposed murderer. The ante-room door was
open and when he entered he found Mademoiselle Stangerson lying
partly thrown over the desk. Her dressing-gown was dyed with the
blood flowing from her bosom. Still under the influence of the
drug, he felt he was walking in a horrible nightmare.</p>

<p>He went back to the gallery automatically, opened a window, shouted
his order to fire, and then returned to the room. He crossed the
deserted boudoir, entered the drawing-room, and tried to rouse
Monsieur Stangerson who was lying on a sofa. Monsieur Stangerson
rose stupidly and let himself be drawn by Rouletabille into the
room where, on seeing his daughter’s body, he uttered a heart-rending
cry. Both united their feeble strength and carried her to her
bed.</p>

<p>On his way to join us Rouletabille passed by the desk. On the
floor, near it, he saw a large packet. He knelt down and, finding
the wrapper loose, he examined it, and made out an enormous quantity
of papers and photographs. On one of the papers he read: "New
differential electroscopic condenser. Fundamental properties of
substance intermediary between ponderable matter and imponderable
ether." Strange irony of fate that the professor’s precious papers
should be restored to him at the very time when an attempt was
being made to deprive him of his daughter’s life! What are papers
worth to him now?</p>

<p>The morning following that awful night saw Monsieur de Marquet
once more at the chateau, with his Registrar and gendarmes. Of
course we were all questioned. Rouletabille and I had already
agreed on what to say. I kept back any information as to my being
in the dark closet and said nothing about the drugging. We did
not wish to suggest in any way that Mademoiselle Stangerson had
been expecting her nocturnal visitor. The poor woman might, perhaps,
never recover, and it was none of our business to lift the veil
of a secret the preservation of which she had paid for so dearly.</p>

<p>Arthur Rance told everybody, in a manner so natural that it astonished
me, that he had last seen the keeper towards eleven o’clock of
that fatal night. He had come for his valise, he said, which he
was to take for him early next morning to the Saint-Michel station,
and had been kept out late running after poachers. Arthur Rance
had, indeed, intended to leave the chateau and, according to his
habit, to walk to the station.</p>

<p>Monsieur Stangerson confirmed what Rance had said, adding that
he had not asked Rance to dine with him because his friend had
taken his final leave of them both earlier in the evening. Monsieur
Rance had had tea served him in his room, because he had complained
of a slight indisposition.</p>

<p>Bernier testified, instructed by Rouletabille, that the keeper
had ordered him to meet at a spot near the oak grove, for the
purpose of looking out for poachers. Finding that the keeper did
not keep his appointment, he, Bernier, had gone in search of him.
He had almost arrived at the donjon, when he saw a figure running
swiftly in a direction opposite to him, towards the right wing
of the chateau. He heard revolver shots from behind the figure
and saw Rouletabille at one of the gallery windows. He heard Rouletabille
call out to him to fire, and he had fired. He believed he had
killed the man until he learned, after Rouletabille had uncovered
the body, that the man had died from a knife thrust. Who had given
it he could not imagine. "Nobody could have been near the spot
without my seeing him." When the examining magistrate reminded
him that the spot where the body was found was very dark and that
he himself had not been able to recognise the keeper before firing,
Daddy Bernier replied that neither had they seen the other body;
nor had they found it. In the narrow court where five people were
standing it would have been strange if the other body, had it
been there, could have escaped. The only door that opened into
the court was that of the keeper’s room, and that door was closed,
and the key of it was found in the keeper’s pocket.</p>

<p>However that might be, the examining magistrate did not pursue
his inquiry further in this direction. He was evidently convinced
that we had missed the man we were chasing and we had come upon
the keeper’s body in our chase. This matter of the keeper was
another matter entirely. He wanted to satisfy himself about that
without any further delay. Probably it fitted in with the conclusions
he had already arrived at as to the keeper and his intrigues with
the wife of Mathieu, the landlord of the Donjon Inn. This Mathieu,
later in the afternoon, was arrested and taken to Corbeil in spite
of his rheumatism. He had been heard to threaten the keeper, and
though no evidence against him had been found at his inn, the
evidence of carters who had heard the threats was enough to justify
his retention.</p>

<p>The examination had proceeded thus far when, to our surprise,
Frederic Larsan returned to the chateau. He was accompanied by
one of the employeeees of the railway. At that moment Rance and
I were in the vestibule discussing Mathieu’s guilt or innocence,
while Rouletabille stood apart buried, apparently, in thought.
The examining magistrate and his Registrar were in the little
green drawing-room, while Darzac was with the doctor and Stangerson
in the lady’s chamber. As Frederic Larsan entered the vestibule
with the railway employeee, Rouletabille and I at once recognised
him by the small blond beard. We exchanged meaningful glances.
Larsan had himself announced to the examining magistrate by the
gendarme and entered with the railway servant as Daddy Jacques
came out. Some ten minutes went by during which Rouletabille appeared
extremely impatient. The door of the drawing-room was then opened
and we heard the magistrate calling to the gendarme who entered.
Presently he came out, mounted the stairs and, coming back shortly,
went in to the magistrate and said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, &mdash;Monsieur Robert Darzac will not come!"</p>

<p>"What! Not come!" cried Monsieur de Marquet.</p>

<p>"He says he cannot leave Mademoiselle Stangerson in her present
state."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Monsieur de Marquet; "then we’ll go to him."</p>

<p>Monsieur de Marquet and the gendarme mounted the stairs. He made
a sign to Larsan and the railroad employeee to follow. Rouletabille
and I went along too.</p>

<p>On reaching the door of Mademoiselle Stangerson’s chamber, Monsieur
de Marquet knocked. A chambermaid appeared. It was Sylvia, with
her hair all in disorder and consternation showing on her face.</p>

<p>"Is Monsieur Stangerson within?" asked the magistrate.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Tell him that I wish to speak with him."</p>

<p>Stangerson came out. His appearance was wretched in the extreme.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he demanded of the magistrate. "May I not
be left in peace, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said the magistrate, "it is absolutely necessary
that I should see Monsieur Darzac at once. If you cannot induce
him to come, I shall be compelled to use the help of the law."</p>

<p>The professor made no reply. He looked at us all like a man being
led to execution, and then went back into the room.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after Monsieur Robert Darzac came out. He
was very pale. He looked at us and, his eyes falling on the railway
servant, his features stiffened and he could hardly repress a
groan.</p>

<p>We were all much moved by the appearance of the man. We felt
that what was about to happen would decide the fate of Monsieur
Robert Darzac. Frederic Larsan’s face alone was radiant, showing
a joy as of a dog that had at last got its prey.</p>

<p>Pointing to the railway servant, Monsieur de Marquet said to
Monsieur Darzac:</p>

<p>"Do you recognise this man, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Monsieur Darzac, in a tone which he vainly tried
to make firm. "He is an employeee at the station at Epinay-sur-Orge."</p>

<p>"This young man," went on Monsieur de Marquet, "affirms that
he saw you get off the train at Epinay-sur-Orge&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That night," said Monsieur Darzac, interrupting, "at half-past
ten&mdash;it is quite true."</p>

<p>An interval of silence followed.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac," the magistrate went on in a tone of deep emotion,
"Monsieur Darzac, what were you doing that night, at Epinay-sur-Orge&mdash;at
that time?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac remained silent, simply closing his eyes.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac," insisted Monsieur de Marquet, "can you tell
me how you employeeed your time, that night?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac opened his eyes. He seemed to have recovered
his self-control.</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Think, Monsieur! For, if you persist in your strange refusal,
I shall be under the painful necessity of keeping you at my disposition."</p>

<p>"I refuse."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Darzac!&mdash;in the name of the law, I arrest you!"</p>

<p>The magistrate had no sooner pronounced the words than I saw
Rouletabille move quickly towards Monsieur Darzac. He would certainly
have spoken to him, but Darzac, by a gesture, held him off. As
the gendarme approached his prisoner, a despairing cry rang through
the room:</p>

<p>"Robert! &mdash;Robert!"</p>

<p>We recognised the voice of Mademoiselle Stangerson. We all shuddered.
Larsan himself turned pale. Monsieur Darzac, in response to the
cry, had flown back into the room.</p>

<p>The magistrate, the gendarme, and Larsan followed closely after.
Rouletabille and I remained on the threshold. It was a heart-breaking
sight that met our eyes. Mademoiselle Stangerson, with a face
of deathly pallor, had risen on her bed, in spite of the restraining
efforts of two doctors and her father. She was holding out her
trembling arms towards Robert Darzac, on whom Larsan and the gendarme
had laid hands. Her distended eyes saw&mdash;she understood&mdash;her lips
seemed to form a word, but nobody made it out; and she fell back
insensible.</p>

<p>Monsieur Darzac was hurried out of the room and placed in the
vestibule to wait for the vehicle Larsan had gone to fetch. We
were all overcome by emotion and even Monsieur de Marquet had
tears in his eyes. Rouletabille took advantage of the opportunity
to say to Monsieur Darzac:</p>

<p>"Are you going to put in any defense?"</p>

<p>"No!" replied the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Very well, then I will, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"You cannot do it," said the unhappy man with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"I can&mdash;and I will."</p>

<p>Rouletabille’s voice had in it a strange strength and confidence.</p>

<p>"I can do it, Monsieur Robert Darzac, because I know more than
you do!"</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" murmured Darzac, almost angrily.</p>

<p>"Have no fear! I shall know only what will benefit you."</p>

<p>"You must know nothing, young man, if you want me to be grateful."</p>

<p>Rouletabille shook his head, going close up to Darzac.</p>

<p>"Listen to what I am about to say," he said in a low tone, "and
let it give you confidence. You do not know the name of the murderer.
Mademoiselle Stangerson knows it; but only half of it; but I know
his two halves; I know the whole man!"</p>

<p>Robert Darzac opened his eyes, with a look that showed he had
not understood a word of what Rouletabille had said to him. At
that moment the conveyance arrived, driven by Frederic Larsan.
Darzac and the gendarme entered it, Larsan remaining on the driver’s
seat. The prisoner was taken to Corbeil.</p>
