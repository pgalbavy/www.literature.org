For moments after that awful laugh had ceased reverberating
through the rocky room, Tars Tarkas and I stood in tense and
expectant silence.  But no further sound broke the stillness,
nor within the range of our vision did aught move.
<P>
At length Tars Tarkas laughed softly, after the manner of his
strange kind when in the presence of the horrible or terrifying.
It is not an hysterical laugh, but rather the genuine expression
of the pleasure they derive from the things that move Earth men
to loathing or to tears.
<P>
Often and again have I seen them roll upon the ground
in mad fits of uncontrollable mirth when witnessing the
death agonies of women and little children beneath the
torture of that hellish green Martian fete--the Great Games.
<P>
I looked up at the Thark, a smile upon my own lips, for here in
truth was greater need for a smiling face than a trembling chin.
<P>
"What do you make of it all?" I asked.  "Where in the deuce are we?"
<P>
He looked at me in surprise.
<P>
"Where are we?" he repeated.  "Do you tell me, John Carter,
that you know not where you be?"
<P>
"That I am upon Barsoom is all that I can guess, and but
for you and the great white apes I should not even guess
that, for the sights I have seen this day are as unlike the
things of my beloved Barsoom as I knew it ten long years
ago as they are unlike the world of my birth.
<P>
"No, Tars Tarkas, I know not where we be."
<P>
"Where have you been since you opened the mighty portals
of the atmosphere plant years ago, after the keeper had
died and the engines stopped and all Barsoom was dying,
that had not already died, of asphyxiation?  Your body even
was never found, though the men of a whole world sought
after it for years, though the Jeddak of Helium and his
granddaughter, your princess, offered such fabulous rewards
that even princes of royal blood joined in the search.
 
"There was but one conclusion to reach when all efforts to
locate you had failed, and that, that you had taken the long,
last pilgrimage down the mysterious River Iss, to await in
the Valley Dor upon the shores of the Lost Sea of Korus
the beautiful Dejah Thoris, your princess.
<P>
"Why you had gone none could guess, for your princess still lived--"
<P>
"Thank God," I interrupted him.  "I did not dare to ask you,
for I feared I might have been too late to save her--
she was very low when I left her in the royal gardens of
Tardos Mors that long-gone night; so very low that I scarcely
hoped even then to reach the atmosphere plant ere her dear
spirit had fled from me for ever.  And she lives yet?"
<P>
"She lives, John Carter."
<P>
"You have not told me where we are," I reminded him.
<P>
"We are where I expected to find you, John Carter--and
another.  Many years ago you heard the story of the woman
who taught me the thing that green Martians are reared to
hate, the woman who taught me to love.  You know the cruel
tortures and the awful death her love won for her at the
hands of the beast, Tal Hajus.
<P>
"She, I thought, awaited me by the Lost Sea of Korus.
<P>
"You know that it was left for a man from another world,
for yourself, John Carter, to teach this cruel Thark what
friendship is; and you, I thought, also roamed the care-free
Valley Dor.
<P>
"Thus were the two I most longed for at the end of the
long pilgrimage I must take some day, and so as the time
had elapsed which Dejah Thoris had hoped might bring you
once more to her side, for she has always tried to believe that
you had but temporarily returned to your own planet, I at
last gave way to my great yearning and a month since I started
upon the journey, the end of which you have this day witnessed. 
Do you understand now where you be, John Carter?"
<P>
"And that was the River Iss, emptying into the Lost Sea of
Korus in the Valley Dor?" I asked.
<P>
"This is the valley of love and peace and rest to which every
Barsoomian since time immemorial has longed to pilgrimage
at the end of a life of hate and strife and bloodshed,"
he replied.  "This, John Carter, is Heaven."
<P>
His tone was cold and ironical; its bitterness but reflecting
the terrible disappointment he had suffered.  Such a fearful
disillusionment, such a blasting of life-long hopes and aspirations,
such an uprooting of age-old tradition might have excused a vastly
greater demonstration on the part of the Thark.
<P>
I laid my hand upon his shoulder.
<P>
"I am sorry," I said, nor did there seem aught else to say.
<P>
"Think, John Carter, of the countless billions of Barsoomians
who have taken the voluntary pilgrimage down this cruel river
since the beginning of time, only to fall into the ferocious
clutches of the terrible creatures that to-day assailed us.
<P>
"There is an ancient legend that once a red man returned
from the banks of the Lost Sea of Korus, returned from the
Valley Dor, back through the mysterious River Iss, and the
legend has it that he narrated a fearful blasphemy of horrid
brutes that inhabited a valley of wondrous loveliness,
brutes that pounced upon each Barsoomian as he terminated
his pilgrimage and devoured him upon the banks of the Lost
Sea where he had looked to find love and peace and happiness;
but the ancients killed the blasphemer, as tradition has
ordained that any shall be killed who return from the bosom
of the River of Mystery.
<P>
"But now we know that it was no blasphemy, that the
legend is a true one, and that the man told only of what he
saw; but what does it profit us, John Carter, since even should
we escape, we also would be treated as blasphemers?  We
are between the wild thoat of certainty and the mad zitidar
of fact--we can escape neither."
<P>
"As Earth men say, we are between the devil and the deep sea,
Tars Tarkas," I replied, nor could I help but smile at our dilemma.
<P>
"There is naught that we can do but take things as they come,
and at least have the satisfaction of knowing that whoever
slays us eventually will have far greater numbers of their
own dead to count than they will get in return.  White ape or
plant man, green Barsoomian or red man, whosoever it shall
be that takes the last toll from us will know that it is costly
in lives to wipe out John Carter, Prince of the House of
Tardos Mors, and Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, at the same time."
<P>
I could not help but laugh at him grim humour, and he
joined in with me in one of those rare laughs of real
enjoyment which was one of the attributes of this fierce
Tharkian chief which marked him from the others of his kind.
<P>
"But about yourself, John Carter," he cried at last.  "If you
have not been here all these years where indeed have you
been, and how is it that I find you here to-day?"
<P>
"I have been back to Earth," I replied.  "For ten long Earth
years I have been praying and hoping for the day that would
carry me once more to this grim old planet of yours, for
which, with all its cruel and terrible customs, I feel a bond
of sympathy and love even greater than for the world that
gave me birth.
<P>
"For ten years have I been enduring a living death of
uncertainty and doubt as to whether Dejah Thoris lived, and
now that for the first time in all these years my prayers have
been answered and my doubt relieved I find myself, through
a cruel whim of fate, hurled into the one tiny spot of all
Barsoom from which there is apparently no escape, and if
there were, at a price which would put out for ever the last
flickering hope which I may cling to of seeing my princess
again in this life--and you have seen to-day with what pitiful
futility man yearns toward a material hereafter.
<P>
"Only a bare half-hour before I saw you battling with the
plant men I was standing in the moonlight upon the banks of
a broad river that taps the eastern shore of Earth's most
blessed land.  I have answered you, my friend.  Do you believe?"
<P>
"I believe," replied Tars Tarkas, "though I cannot understand."
<P>
As we talked I had been searching the interior of the
chamber with my eyes.  It was, perhaps, two hundred feet
in length and half as broad, with what appeared to be a
doorway in the centre of the wall directly opposite that
through which we had entered.
<P>
The apartment was hewn from the material of the cliff,
showing mostly dull gold in the dim light which a single
minute radium illuminator in the centre of the roof diffused
throughout its great dimensions.  Here and there polished
surfaces of ruby, emerald, and diamond patched the golden
walls and ceiling.  The floor was of another material, very
hard, and worn by much use to the smoothness of glass.
Aside from the two doors I could discern no sign of other
aperture, and as one we knew to be locked against us I
approached the other.
<P>
As I extended my hand to search for the controlling button,
that cruel and mocking laugh rang out once more, so
close to me this time that I involuntarily shrank back,
tightening my grip upon the hilt of my great sword.
<P>
And then from the far corner of the great chamber a hollow
voice chanted: "There is no hope, there is no hope;
the dead return not, the dead return not; nor is there
any resurrection.  Hope not, for there is no hope."
<P>
Though our eyes instantly turned toward the spot from
which the voice seemed to emanate, there was no one in
sight, and I must admit that cold shivers played along my
spine and the short hairs at the base of my head stiffened
and rose up, as do those upon a hound's neck when in the
night his eyes see those uncanny things which are hidden
from the sight of man.
<P>
Quickly I walked toward the mournful voice, but it had
ceased ere I reached the further wall, and then from the other
end of the chamber came another voice, shrill and piercing:
<P>
"Fools!  Fools!" it shrieked.  "Thinkest thou to defeat the
eternal laws of life and death?  Wouldst cheat the mysterious
Issus, Goddess of Death, of her just dues?  Did not her mighty
messenger, the ancient Iss, bear you upon her leaden bosom
at your own behest to the Valley Dor?
<P>
"Thinkest thou, O fools, that Issus wilt give up her own?
Thinkest thou to escape from whence in all the countless
ages but a single soul has fled?
<P>
"Go back the way thou camest, to the merciful maws of the
children of the Tree of Life or the gleaming fangs of the
great white apes, for there lies speedy surcease from suffering;
but insist in your rash purpose to thread the mazes of the
Golden Cliffs of the Mountains of Otz, past the ramparts
of the impregnable fortresses of the Holy Therns, and upon
your way Death in its most frightful form will overtake you
--a death so horrible that even the Holy Therns themselves,
who conceived both Life and Death, avert their eyes from
its fiendishness and close their ears against the hideous
shrieks of its victims.
<P>
"Go back, O fools, the way thou camest."
<P>
And then the awful laugh broke out from another part
of the chamber.
<P>
"Most uncanny," I remarked, turning to Tars Tarkas.
<P>
"What shall we do?" he asked.  "We cannot fight empty
air; I would almost sooner return and face foes into whose
flesh I may feel my blade bite and know that I am selling
my carcass dearly before I go down to that eternal oblivion
which is evidently the fairest and most desirable eternity that
mortal man has the right to hope for."
<P>
"If, as you say, we cannot fight empty air, Tars Tarkas,"
I replied, "neither, on the other hand, can empty air fight us.
I, who have faced and conquered in my time thousands of sinewy
warriors and tempered blades, shall not be turned back by wind;
nor no more shall you, Thark."
<P>
"But unseen voices may emanate from unseen and unseeable
creatures who wield invisible blades," answered the green warrior.
<P>
"Rot, Tars Tarkas," I cried, "those voices come from beings
as real as you or as I.  In their veins flows lifeblood that
may be let as easily as ours, and the fact that they remain
invisible to us is the best proof to my mind that they are
mortal; nor overly courageous mortals at that.  Think you,
Tars Tarkas, that John Carter will fly at the first shriek of a
cowardly foe who dare not come out into the open and face a good blade?"
<P>
I had spoken in a loud voice that there might be no
question that our would-be terrorizers should hear me, for I
was tiring of this nerve-racking fiasco.  It had occurred to me,
too, that the whole business was but a plan to frighten us
back into the valley of death from which we had escaped, that
we might be quickly disposed of by the savage creatures there.
<P>
For a long period there was silence, then of a sudden a soft,
stealthy sound behind me caused me to turn suddenly to behold
a great many-legged banth creeping sinuously upon me.
<P>
The banth is a fierce beast of prey that roams the low
hills surrounding the dead seas of ancient Mars.  Like nearly
all Martian animals it is almost hairless, having only a great
bristly mane about its thick neck.
<P>
Its long, lithe body is supported by ten powerful legs, its
enormous jaws are equipped, like those of the calot, or
Martian hound, with several rows of long needle-like fangs;
its mouth reaches to a point far back of its tiny ears, while
its enormous, protruding eyes of green add the last touch of
terror to its awful aspect.
<P>
As it crept toward me it lashed its powerful tail against
its yellow sides, and when it saw that it was discovered it
emitted the terrifying roar which often freezes its prey into
momentary paralysis in the instant that it makes its spring.
<P>
And so it launched its great bulk toward me, but its
mighty voice had held no paralysing terrors for me, and
it met cold steel instead of the tender flesh its cruel jaws
gaped so widely to engulf.
<P>
An instant later I drew my blade from the still heart of
this great Barsoomian lion, and turning toward Tars Tarkas
was surprised to see him facing a similar monster.
<P>
No sooner had he dispatched his than I, turning, as though
drawn by the instinct of my guardian subconscious mind,
beheld another of the savage denizens of the Martian wilds
leaping across the chamber toward me.
<P>
From then on for the better part of an hour one hideous
creature after another was launched upon us, springing
apparently from the empty air about us.
<P>
Tars Tarkas was satisfied; here was something tangible that
he could cut and slash with his great blade, while I, for my
part, may say that the diversion was a marked improvement
over the uncanny voices from unseen lips.
<P>
That there was nothing supernatural about our new foes was
well evidenced by their howls of rage and pain as they felt
the sharp steel at their vitals, and the very real blood
which flowed from their severed arteries as they died the
real death.
<P>
I noticed during the period of this new persecution that the
beasts appeared only when our backs were turned; we never saw
one really materialize from thin air, nor did I for an instant
sufficiently lose my excellent reasoning faculties to be once
deluded into the belief that the beasts came into the room
other than through some concealed and well-contrived doorway.
<P>
Among the ornaments of Tars Tarkas' leather harness,
which is the only manner of clothing worn by Martians other
than silk capes and robes of silk and fur for protection from
the cold after dark, was a small mirror, about the bigness
of a lady's hand glass, which hung midway between his
shoulders and his waist against his broad back.
<P>
Once as he stood looking down at a newly fallen antagonist
my eyes happened to fall upon this mirror and in its shiny
surface I saw pictured a sight that caused me to whisper:
<P>
"Move not, Tars Tarkas!  Move not a muscle!"
<P>
He did not ask why, but stood like a graven image
while my eyes watched the strange thing that meant so
much to us.
<P>
What I saw was the quick movement of a section of the
wall behind me.  It was turning upon pivots, and with it a
section of the floor directly in front of it was turning.  It was
as though you placed a visiting-card upon end on a silver
dollar that you had laid flat upon a table, so that the edge
of the card perfectly bisected the surface of the coin.
<P>
The card might represent the section of the wall that turned
and the silver dollar the section of the floor.  Both were so
nicely fitted into the adjacent portions of the floor and wall
that no crack had been noticeable in the dim light of the chamber.
<P>
As the turn was half completed a great beast was revealed
sitting upon its haunches upon that part of the revolving floor
that had been on the opposite side before the wall commenced
to move; when the section stopped, the beast was facing toward
me on our side of the partition--it was very simple.
<P>
But what had interested me most was the sight that the
half-turned section had presented through the opening that
it had made.  A great chamber, well lighted, in which were
several men and women chained to the wall, and in front of
them, evidently directing and operating the movement of the
secret doorway, a wicked-faced man, neither red as are the
red men of Mars, nor green as are the green men, but white,
like myself, with a great mass of flowing yellow hair.
<P>
The prisoners behind him were red Martians.  Chained with
them were a number of fierce beasts, such as had been turned
upon us, and others equally as ferocious.
<P>
As I turned to meet my new foe it was with a heart
considerably lightened.
<P>
"Watch the wall at your end of the chamber, Tars Tarkas,"
I cautioned, "it is through secret doorways in the wall that
the brutes are loosed upon us."  I was very close to him and
spoke in a low whisper that my knowledge of their secret
might not be disclosed to our tormentors.
<P>
As long as we remained each facing an opposite end of
the apartment no further attacks were made upon us, so it
was quite clear to me that the partitions were in some way
pierced that our actions might be observed from without.
<P>
At length a plan of action occurred to me, and backing quite
close to Tars Tarkas I unfolded my scheme in a low whisper,
keeping my eyes still glued upon my end of the room.
<P>
The great Thark grunted his assent to my proposition when I
had done, and in accordance with my plan commenced backing
toward the wall which I faced while I advanced slowly ahead of him.
<P>
When we had reached a point some ten feet from the
secret doorway I halted my companion, and cautioning him
to remain absolutely motionless until I gave the prearranged
signal I quickly turned my back to the door through which
I could almost feel the burning and baleful eyes of our
would be executioner.
<P>
Instantly my own eyes sought the mirror upon Tars Tarkas' back
and in another second I was closely watching the section of the
wall which had been disgorging its savage terrors upon us.
<P>
I had not long to wait, for presently the golden surface
commenced to move rapidly.  Scarcely had it started than I
gave the signal to Tars Tarkas, simultaneously springing for
the receding half of the pivoting door.  In like manner the
Thark wheeled and leaped for the opening being made by
the inswinging section.
<P>
A single bound carried me completely through into the
adjoining room and brought me face to face with the fellow
whose cruel face I had seen before.  He was about my own
height and well muscled and in every outward detail moulded
precisely as are Earth men.
<P>
At his side hung a long-sword, a short-sword, a dagger, and one
of the destructive radium revolvers that are common upon Mars.
<P>
The fact that I was armed only with a long-sword, and so
according to the laws and ethics of battle everywhere upon
Barsoom should only have been met with a similar or lesser weapon,
seemed to have no effect upon the moral sense of my enemy,
for he whipped out his revolver ere I scarce had touched the
floor by his side, but an uppercut from my long-sword sent it
flying from his grasp before he could discharge it.
<P>
Instantly he drew his long-sword, and thus evenly armed we set to
in earnest for one of the closest battles I ever have fought.
<P>
The fellow was a marvellous swordsman and evidently in practice,
while I had not gripped the hilt of a sword for ten long years
before that morning.
<P>
But it did not take me long to fall easily into my fighting stride,
so that in a few minutes the man began to realize that he had at last
met his match.
<P>
His face became livid with rage as he found my guard impregnable,
while blood flowed from a dozen minor wounds upon his face and body.
<P>
"Who are you, white man?" he hissed.  "That you are no
Barsoomian from the outer world is evident from your colour.
And you are not of us."
<P>
His last statement was almost a question.
<P>
"What if I were from the Temple of Issus?" I hazarded on a wild guess.
<P>
"Fate forfend!" he exclaimed, his face going white under
the blood that now nearly covered it.
<P>
I did not know how to follow up my lead, but I carefully laid
the idea away for future use should circumstances require it.
His answer indicated that for all he KNEW I might be from
the Temple of Issus and in it were men like unto myself,
and either this man feared the inmates of the temple or else
he held their persons or their power in such reverence that he
trembled to think of the harm and indignities he had heaped
upon one of them.
<P>
But my present business with him was of a different nature
than that which requires any considerable abstract reasoning;
it was to get my sword between his ribs, and this I succeeded
in doing within the next few seconds, nor was I an instant too soon.
<P>
The chained prisoners had been watching the combat in
tense silence; not a sound had fallen in the room other than
the clashing of our contending blades, the soft shuffling of
our naked feet and the few whispered words we had hissed
at each other through clenched teeth the while we continued
our mortal duel.
<P>
But as the body of my antagonist sank an inert mass to
the floor a cry of warning broke from one of the female prisoners.
<P>
"Turn!  Turn!  Behind you!" she shrieked, and as I wheeled
at the first note of her shrill cry I found myself facing a
second man of the same race as he who lay at my feet.
<P>
The fellow had crept stealthily from a dark corridor and
was almost upon me with raised sword ere I saw him.  Tars
Tarkas was nowhere in sight and the secret panel in the wall,
through which I had come, was closed.
<P>
How I wished that he were by my side now!  I had fought
almost continuously for many hours; I had passed through such
experiences and adventures as must sap the vitality of man,
and with all this I had not eaten for nearly twenty-four hours,
nor slept.
<P>
I was fagged out, and for the first time in years felt a
question as to my ability to cope with an antagonist; but
there was naught else for it than to engage my man, and
that as quickly and ferociously as lay in me, for my only
salvation was to rush him off his feet by the impetuosity of
my attack--I could not hope to win a long-drawn-out battle.
<P>
But the fellow was evidently of another mind, for he backed
and parried and parried and sidestepped until I was almost
completely fagged from the exertion of attempting to finish him.
<P>
He was a more adroit swordsman, if possible, than my previous foe,
and I must admit that he led me a pretty chase and in the end
came near to making a sorry fool of me--and a dead one into the bargain.
<P>
I could feel myself growing weaker and weaker, until at
length objects commenced to blur before my eyes and I
staggered and blundered about more asleep than awake,
and then it was that he worked his pretty little coup
that came near to losing me my life.
<P>
He had backed me around so that I stood in front of the
corpse of his fellow, and then he rushed me suddenly so that
I was forced back upon it, and as my heel struck it the
impetus of my body flung me backward across the dead man.
<P>
My head struck the hard pavement with a resounding
whack, and to that alone I owe my life, for it cleared my
brain and the pain roused my temper, so that I was equal
for the moment to tearing my enemy to pieces with my bare
hands, and I verily believe that I should have attempted it had
not my right hand, in the act of raising my body from the
ground, come in contact with a bit of cold metal.
<P>
As the eyes of the layman so is the hand of the fighting man
when it comes in contact with an implement of his vocation,
and thus I did not need to look or reason to know that
the dead man's revolver, lying where it had fallen when I
struck it from his grasp, was at my disposal.
<P>
The fellow whose ruse had put me down was springing toward me,
the point of his gleaming blade directed straight at my heart,
and as he came there rang from his lips the cruel and mocking peal
of laughter that I had heard within the Chamber of Mystery.
<P>
And so he died, his thin lips curled in the snarl of his hateful
laugh, and a bullet from the revolver of his dead companion
bursting in his heart.
<P>
His body, borne by the impetus of his headlong rush, plunged upon me.
The hilt of his sword must have struck my head, for with the impact
of the corpse I lost consciousness.
