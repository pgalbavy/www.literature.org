<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In a tiny bit of a looking-glass hung on the frame of the east
window, Peyrol, handling the unwearable English blade, was shaving
himself&mdash;for the day was Sunday. The years of political changes
ending with the proclamation of Napoleon as Consul for life had
not touched Peyrol except as to his strong thick head of hair,
which was nearly all white now. After putting the razor away carefully,
Peyrol introduced his stockinged feet into a pair of sabots of
the very best quality and clattered downstairs. His brown cloth
breeches were untied at the knee and the sleeves of his shirt
rolled up to his shoulders. That sea rover turned rustic was now
perfectly at home in that farm which, like a lighthouse, commanded
the view of two roadsteads and of the open sea. He passed through
the kitchen. It was exactly as he had seen it first&mdash;sunlight
on the floor, red copper utensils shining on the walls, the table
in the middle scrubbed snowy white; and it was only the old woman,
Aunt Catherine, who seemed to have acquired a sharper profile.
The very hen manœuvring her neck pretentiously on the doorstep,
might have been standing there for the last eight years. Peyrol
shooed her away, and going into the yard washed himself lavishly
at the pump. When he returned from the yard he looked so fresh
and hale that old Catherine complimented him in a thin voice on
his "bonne mine." Manners were changing, and she addressed him
no longer as citoyen but as Monsieur Peyrol. He answered readily
that if her heart was free he was ready to lead her to the altar
that very day. This was such an old joke that Catherine took no
notice of it whatever, but followed him with her eyes as he crossed
the kitchen into the salle, which was cool, with its tables and
benches washed clean, and no living soul in it. Peyrol passed
through to the front of the house, leaving the outer door open.
At the clatter of his clogs a young man sitting outside on a bench
turned his head and greeted him by a careless nod. His face was
rather long, sunburnt and smooth, with a slightly curved nose
and a very well-shaped chin. He wore a dark blue naval jacket
open on a white shirt and a black neckerchief tied in a slip-knot
with long ends. White breeches and stockings and black shoes with
steel buckles completed his costume. A brass-hilted sword in a
black scabbard worn on a cross-belt was lying on the ground at
his feet. Peyrol, silver-headed and ruddy, sat down on the bench
at some little distance. The level piece of rocky ground in front
of the house was not very extensive, falling away to the sea in
a declivity framed between the rises of two barren hills. The
old rover and the young seaman with their arms folded across their
chests gazed into space, exchanging no words, like close intimates
or like distant strangers. Neither did they stir when the master
of the Escampobar Farm appeared out of the yard gate with a manure
fork on his shoulder and started to cross the piece of level ground.
His grimy hands, his rolled-up shirt-sleeves, the fork over the
shoulder, the whole of his working-day aspect had somehow an air
of being a manifestation; but the patriot dragged his dirty clogs
low-spiritedly in the fresh light of the young morning, in a way
no real worker on the land would ever do at the end of a day of
toil. Yet there were no signs of debility about his person. His
oval face with rounded cheek-bones remained unwrinkled except
at the corners of his almond-shaped, shiny, visionary’s eyes,
which had not changed since the day when old Peyrol’s gaze had
met them for the first time. A few white hairs on his tousled
head and in the thin beard alone had marked the passage of years,
and you would have had to look for them closely. Amongst the unchangeable
rocks at the extreme end of the peninsula, time seemed to have
stood still and idle while the group of people poised at that
southernmost point of France had gone about their ceaseless toil,
winning bread and wine from a stony-hearted earth.</p>

<p>The master of the farm, staring straight before him, passed before
the two men towards the door of the salle, which Peyrol had left
open. He leaned his fork against the wall before going in. The
sound of a distant bell, the bell of the village where years ago
the returned rover had watered his mule and had listened to the
talk of the man with the dog, came up faint and abrupt in the
great stillness of the upper space. The violent slamming of the
salle door broke the silence between the two gazers on the sea.</p>

<p>"Does that fellow never rest?" asked the young man in a low indifferent
voice which covered the delicate tinkling of the bell, and without
moving his head.</p>

<p>"Not on Sunday anyhow," answered the rover in the same detached
manner. "What can you expect? The church bell is like poison to
him. That fellow, I verily believe, has been born a sans-culotte.
Every ‘decadi’ he puts on his best clothes, sticks a red cap on
his head and wanders between the buildings like a lost soul in
the light of day. A Jacobin, if ever there was one."</p>

<p>"Yes. There is hardly a hamlet in France where there isn’t a
sans-culotte or two. But some of them have managed to change their
skins if nothing else."</p>

<p>"This one won’t change his skin, and as to his inside he never
had anything in him that could be moved. Aren’t there some people
that remember him in Toulon? It isn’t such a long time ago. And
yet...." Peyrol turned slightly towards the young man.... "And
yet to look at him...."</p>

<p>The officer nodded and for a moment his face wore a troubled
expression which did not escape the notice of Peyrol, who went
on speaking easily:</p>

<p>"Some time ago, when the priests began to come back to the parishes,
he, that fellow" &mdash;Peyrol jerked his head in the direction
of the salle door&mdash;"would you believe it?&mdash;started for the village
with a sabre hanging to his side and his red cap on his head.
He made for the church door. What he wanted to do there I don’t
know. It surely could not have been to say the proper kind of
prayers. Well, the people were very much elated about their reopened
church, and as he went along some woman spied him out of a window
and started the alarm. ‘Eh, there! look! The Jacobin, the sans-culotte,
the blood-drinker! Look at him.’ Out rushed some of them, and
a man or two that were working in their home patches vaulted over
the low walls. Pretty soon there was a crowd, mostly women, each
with the first thing she could snatch up&mdash;stick, kitchen knife,
anything. A few men with spades and cudgels joined them by the
water-trough. He didn’t quite like that. What could he do? He
turned and bolted up the hill like a hare. It takes some pluck
to face a mob of angry women. He ran along the cart track without
looking behind him, and they after him, yelling: ‘A mort! A mort
le buveur de sang!’ He had been a horror and an abomination to
the people for years, what with one story and another, and now
they thought it was their chance. The priest over in the presbytery
hears the noise, comes to the door. One look was enough for him.
He is a fellow of about forty but a wiry, long-legged beggar,
and agile&mdash;what? He just tucked up his skirts and dashed out,
taking short cuts over the walls and leaping from boulder to boulder
like a blessed goat. I was up in my room when the noise reached
me there. I went to the window and saw the chase in full cry after
him. I was beginning to think the fool would fetch all those furies
along with him up here and that they would carry the house by
boarding and do for the lot of us, when the priest cut in just
in the nick of time. He could have tripped Scevola as easy as
anything, but he lets him pass and stands in front of his parishioners
with his arms extended. That did it. He saved the patron all right.
What he could say to quieten them I don’t know, but these were
early days and they were very fond of their new priest. He could
have turned them round his little finger. I had my head and shoulders
out of the window&mdash;it was interesting enough. They would have
massacred all the accursed lot, as they used to call us down there&mdash;and
when I drew in, behold there was the patronne standing behind
me looking on too. You have been here often enough to know how
she roams about the grounds and about the house, without a sound.
A leaf doesn’t pose itself lighter on the ground than her feet
do. Well, I suppose she didn’t know that I was upstairs, and came
into the room just in her way of always looking for something
that isn’t there, and noticing me with my head stuck out, naturally
came up to see what I was looking at. Her face wasn’t any paler
than usual but she was clawing the dress over her chest with her
ten fingers&mdash;like this. I was confounded. Before I could find
my tongue she just turned round and went out with no more sound
than a shadow."</p>

<p>When Peyrol ceased, the ringing of the church bell went on faintly
and then stopped as abruptly as it had begun.</p>

<p>"Talking about her shadow," said the young officer indolently,
"I know her shadow."</p>

<p>Old Peyrol made a really pronounced movement. "What do you mean?"
he asked. "Where?"</p>

<p>"I have got only one window in the room where they put me to
sleep last night and I stood at it looking out. That’s what I
am here for&mdash;to look out, am I not? I woke up suddenly, and being
awake I went to the window and looked out."</p>

<p>"One doesn’t see shadows in the air," growled old Peyrol.</p>

<p>"No, but you see them on the ground, pretty black too when the
moon is full. It fell across this open space here from the corner
of the house."</p>

<p>"The patronne," exclaimed Peyrol in a low voice, "impossible!"</p>

<p>"Does the old woman that lives in the kitchen roam, do the village
women roam as far as this?" asked the officer composedly. "You
ought to know the habits of the people. It was a woman’s shadow.
The moon being to the west, it glided slanting from that corner
of the house and glided back again. I know her shadow when I see
it."</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything?" asked Peyrol after a moment of visible
hesitation.</p>

<p>"The window being open, I heard somebody snoring. It couldn’t
have been you, you are too high. Moreover, from the snoring,"
he added grimly, "it must have been somebody with a good conscience.
Not like you, old skimmer of the seas, because, you know, that’s
what you are, for all your gunner’s warrant." He glanced out of
the corner of his eyes at old Peyrol. "What makes you look so
worried?"</p>

<p>"She roams, that cannot be denied," murmured Peyrol, with an
uneasiness which he did not attempt to conceal.</p>

<p>"Evidently. I know a shadow when I see it, and when I saw it,
it did not frighten me, not a quarter as much as the mere tale
of it seems to have frightened you. However, that sans-culotte
friend of yours must be a hard sleeper. Those purveyors of the
guillotine all have a first-class fireproof Republican conscience.
I have seen them at work up north when I was a boy running bare-foot
in the gutters...."</p>

<p>"The fellow always sleeps in that room," said Peyrol earnestly.</p>

<p>"But that’s neither here nor there," went on the officer, "except
that it may be convenient for roaming shadows to hear his conscience
taking its ease."</p>

<p>Peyrol, excited, lowered his voice forcibly. "Lieutenant," he
said, "if I had not seen from the first what was in your heart
I would have contrived to get rid of you a long time ago in some
way or other."</p>

<p>The lieutenant glanced sideways again and Peyrol let his raised
fist fall heavily on his thigh. "I am old Peyrol and this place,
as lonely as a ship at sea, is like a ship to me and all in it
are like shipmates. Never mind the patron. What I want to know
is whether you heard anything? Any sound at all? Murmur, footstep?"
A bitterly mocking smile touched the lips of the young man.</p>

<p>"Not a fairy footstep. Could you hear the fall of a leaf&mdash;and
with that terrorist cur trumpeting right above my head?..." Without
unfolding his arms he turned towards Peyrol, who was looking at
him anxiously.... "You want to know, do you? Well, I will tell
you what I heard and you can make the best of it. I heard the
sound of a stumble. It wasn’t a fairy either that stubbed its
toe. It was something in a heavy shoe. Then a stone went rolling
down the ravine in front of us interminably, then a silence as
of death. I didn’t see anything moving. The way the moon was then
the ravine was in black shadow. And I didn’t try to see."</p>

<p>Peyrol, with his elbow on his knee, leaned his head in the palm
of his hand. The officer repeated through his clenched teeth:
"Make the best of it."</p>

<p>Peyrol shook his head slightly. After having spoken, the young
officer leaned back against the wall, but next moment the report
of a piece of ordnance reached them as it were from below, travelling
around the rising ground to the left in the form of a dull thud
followed by a sighing sound that seemed to seek an issue amongst
the stony ridges and rocks near by.</p>

<p>"That’s the English corvette which has been dodging in and out
of Hyères Roads for the last week," said the young officer, picking
up his sword hastily. He stood up and buckled the belt on, while
Peyrol rose more deliberately from the bench, and said:</p>

<p>"She can’t be where we saw her at anchor last night. That gun
was near. She must have crossed over. There has been enough wind
for that at various times during the night. But what could she
be firing at down there in the Petite Passe? We had better go
and see."</p>

<p>He strode off, followed by Peyrol. There was not a human being
in sight about the farm and not a sound of life except for the
lowing of a cow coming faintly from behind a wall. Peyrol kept
close behind the quickly moving officer who followed the footpath
marked faintly on the stony slope of the hill.</p>

<p>"That gun was not shotted," he observed suddenly in a deep steady
voice.</p>

<p>The officer glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"You may be right. You haven’t been a gunner for nothing. Not
shotted, eh? Then a signal gun. But who to? We have been observing
that corvette now for days and we know she has no companion."</p>

<p>He moved on, Peyrol following him on the awkward path without
losing his wind and arguing in a steady voice: "She has no companion
but she may have seen a friend at daylight this morning."</p>

<p>"Bah!" retorted the officer without checking his pace. "You talk
now like a child or else you take me for one. How far could she
have seen? What view could she have had at daylight if she was
making her way to the Petite Passe where she is now? Why, the
islands would have masked for her two-thirds of the sea and just
in the direction too where the English inshore squadron is hovering
below the horizon. Funny blockade that! You can’t see a single
English sail for days and days together, and then when you least
expect them they come down all in a crowd as if ready to eat us
alive. No, no! There was no wind to bring her up a companion.
But tell me, gunner, you who boast of knowing the bark of every
English piece, what sort of gun was it?"</p>

<p>Peyrol growled in answer.</p>

<p>"Why, a twelve. The heaviest she carries. She is only a corvette."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it was fired as a recall for one of her boats somewhere
out of sight along the shore. With a coast like this, all points
and bights, there would be nothing very extraordinary in that,
would there?"</p>

<p>"No," said Peyrol, stepping out steadily. "What is extraordinary
is that she should have had a boat away at all."</p>

<p>"You are right there." The officer stopped suddenly. "Yes, it
is really remarkable that she should have sent a boat away. And
there is no other way to explain that gun."</p>

<p>Peyrol’s face expressed no emotion of any sort.</p>

<p>"There is something there worth investigating," continued the
officer with animation.</p>

<p>"If it is a matter of a boat," Peyrol said without the slightest
excitement, "there can be nothing very deep in it. What could
there be? As likely as not they sent her inshore early in the
morning with lines to try to catch some fish for the captain’s
breakfast. Why do you open your eyes like this? Don’t you know
the English? They have enough cheek for anything."</p>

<p>After uttering those words with a deliberation made venerable
by his white hair, Peyrol made the gesture of wiping his brow,
which was barely moist.</p>

<p>"Let us push on," said the lieutenant abruptly.</p>

<p>"Why hurry like this?" argued Peyrol without moving. "Those heavy
clogs of mine are not adapted for scrambling on loose stones."</p>

<p>"Aren’t they?" burst out the officer. "Well then, if you are
tired you can sit down and fan yourself with your hat. Good-bye."
And he strode away before Peyrol could utter a word.</p>

<p>The path following the contour of the hill took a turn towards
its sea-face and very soon the lieutenant passed out of sight
with startling suddenness. Then his head reappeared for a moment,
only his head, and that too vanished suddenly. Peyrol remained
perplexed. After gazing in the direction in which the officer
had disappeared, he looked down at the farm buildings, now below
him but not at a very great distance. He could see distinctly
the pigeons walking on the roof ridges. Somebody was drawing water
from the well in the middle of the yard. The patron, no doubt;
but that man, who at one time had the power to send so many luckless
persons to their death, did not count for old Peyrol. He had even
ceased to be an offence to his sight and a disturber of his feelings.
By himself he was nothing. He had never been anything but a creature
of the universal blood-lust of the time. The very doubts about
him had died out by now in old Peyrol’s breast. The fellow was
so insignificant that had Peyrol in a moment of particular attention
discovered that he cast no shadow, he would not have been surprised.
Below there he was reduced to the shape of a dwarf lugging a bucket
away from the well. But where was she? Peyrol asked himself, shading
his eyes with his hand. He knew that the patronne could not be
very far away, because he had a sight of her during the morning;
but that was before he had learned she had taken to roaming at
night. His growing uneasiness came suddenly to an end when, turning
his eyes away from the farm-buildings, where obviously she was
not, he saw her appear, with nothing but the sky full of light
at her back, coming down round the very turn of the path which
had taken the lieutenant out of sight.</p>

<p>Peyrol moved briskly towards her. He wasn’t a man to lose time
in idle wonder, and his sabots did not seem to weigh heavy on
his feet. The fermière, whom the villagers down there spoke of
as Arlette as though she had been a little girl, but in a strange
tone of shocked awe, walked with her head drooping and her feet
(as Peyrol used to say) touching the ground as lightly as falling
leaves. The clatter of the clogs made her raise her black, clear
eyes that had been smitten on the very verge of womanhood by such
sights of bloodshed and terror as to leave in her a fear of looking
steadily in any direction for long, lest she should see coming
through the empty air some mutilated vision of the dead. Peyrol
called it trying not to see something that was not there; and
this evasive yet frank mobility was so much a part of her being
that the steadiness with which she met his inquisitive glance
surprised old Peyrol for a moment. He asked without beating about
the bush:</p>

<p>"Did he speak to you?"</p>

<p>She answered with something airy and provoking in her voice,
which also struck Peyrol as a novelty: "He never stopped. He passed
by as though he had not seen me"&mdash;and then they both looked away
from each other.</p>

<p>"Now, what is it you took into your head to watch for at night?"</p>

<p>She did not expect that question. She hung her head and took
a pleat of her skirt between her fingers, embarrassed like a child.</p>

<p>"Why should I not," she murmured in a low shy note, as if she
had two voices within her.</p>

<p>"What did Catherine say?"</p>

<p>"She was asleep, or perhaps only lying on her back with her eyes
shut."</p>

<p>"Does she do that?" asked Peyrol with incredulity.</p>

<p>"Yes." Arlette gave Peyrol a queer, meaningless smile with which
her eyes had nothing to do. "Yes, she often does. I have noticed
that before. She lies there trembling under her blankets till
I come back."</p>

<p>"What drove you out last night?" Peyrol tried to catch her eyes,
but they eluded him in the usual way. And now her face looked
as though it couldn’t smile.</p>

<p>"My heart," she said. For a moment Peyrol lost his tongue and
even all power of motion. The fermière having lowered her eyelids,
all her life seemed to have gone into her coral lips, vivid and
without a quiver in the perfection of their design, and Peyrol,
giving up the conversation with an upward fling of his arm, hurried
up the path without looking behind him. But once round the turn
of the path, he approached the lookout at an easier gait. It was
a piece of smooth ground below the summit of the hill. It had
quite a pronounced slope, so that a short and robust pine growing
true out of the soil yet leaned well over the edge of the sheer
drop of some fifty feet or so. The first thing that Peyrol’s eyes
took in was the water of the Petite Passe with the enormous shadow
of the Porquerolles Island darkening more than half of its width
at this still early hour. He could not see the whole of it, but
on the part his glance embraced there was no ship of any kind.
The lieutenant, leaning with his chest along the inclined pine,
addressed him irritably.</p>

<p>"Squat! Do you think there are no glasses on board the Englishman?"</p>

<p>Peyrol obeyed without a word and for the space of a minute or
so presented the bizarre sight of a rather bulky peasant with
venerable white locks crawling on his hands and knees on a hillside
for no visible reason. When he got to the foot of the pine he
raised himself on his knees. The lieutenant, flattened against
the inclined trunk and with a pocket glass glued to his eye, growled
angrily:</p>

<p>"You can see her now, can’t you?"</p>

<p>Peyrol in his kneeling position could see the ship now. She was
less than a quarter of a mile from him up the coast, almost within
hailing effort of his powerful voice. His unaided eyes could follow
the movements of the men on board like dark dots about her decks.
She had drifted so far within Cape Esterel that the low projecting
mass of it seemed to be in actual contact with her stern. Her
unexpected nearness made Peyrol draw a sharp breath through his
teeth. The lieutenant murmured, still keeping the glass to his
eye:</p>

<p>"I can see the very epaulettes of the officers on the quarter-deck."</p>
