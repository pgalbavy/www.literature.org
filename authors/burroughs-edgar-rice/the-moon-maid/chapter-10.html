<p>Now, indeed, did I have reason to curse the stupidity that had
permitted me to cast into the abyss all of the hooked poles save one,
since even this one was now lost to me and I was utterly without
means of escape from the tunnel.
</p><p>As the fellow approached me at a rapid run I hurled my lance, but
being unaccustomed to the weapon, I missed, and then he was upon me,
dropping his own lance as he leaped for me, for it was evidently his
desire to take me alive and unharmed. I thought that I was going to
have him now, for I believed that I was more than a match for him,
but there are tricks in every method of attack and this lunar warrior
was evidently well schooled in his own methods of offense. He
scarcely seemed to touch me, and yet he managed to trip me and push
me simultaneously so that I fell heavily backward to the ground and
turning a little sideways as I fell, I must have struck my head
against the side of the tunnel, for that is the last that I remember
until I regained consciousness in the very cave that Nah-ee-lah and I
had reached when we saw the first of the Kalkars. I was surrounded by
a party of eight of the Kalkars, two of whom were half carrying, half
dragging me. I learned later that in the fight before the rostrum I
had killed four of their number.
</p><p>The fellow who had captured me was in very good humor, doubtless
because of his success, and when he discovered that I had regained
consciousness he started to converse with me.
</p><p>“You thought that you could escape from Gapth, did you?” he cried,
“but never; you might escape from the others, but not from me—no, not
from Gapth.”
</p><p>“I did the principal thing that I desired to do,” I replied, wishing
to learn if Nah-ee-lah had escaped.
</p><p>“What is that?” demanded Gapth.
</p><p>“I succeeded in accomplishing the escape of my companion,” I replied.
</p><p>He made a wry face at that. “If Gapth had been there a moment earlier
she would not have escaped, either,” he said, and by that I knew that
she had escaped, unless she had fallen back into the crater; and I
was amply repaid for my own capture if it had won freedom for Nah-eelah.

</p><p>“Although I did not escape this time,” I said, “I shall next time.”
</p><p>He laughed a nasty laugh. “There will be no next time,” he said, “for
we are taking you to the city, and once there, there is no escape,
for this is the only avenue by which you can reach the outer world
and once within the city you never can retrace your steps to the
mouth of the tunnel.”
</p><p>I was not so sure of that, myself, for my sense of direction and that
of location are very well developed within me. The degree of
perfection attained in orientation by many officers of the
International Peace Fleet has been described as almost miraculous,
and even among such as these my ability in this line was a matter of
comment. I was glad, therefore, that the fellow had warned me, since
now I should be particularly upon the watch for each slightest scrap
of information that would fix in my memory whatever route I might be
led over. From the cave in which I regained consciousness there was
but a single route to the mouth of the tunnel, but from here on into
the city I must watch every turn and fork and crossing and draw upon
the tablets of my memory an accurate and detailed map of the entire
route.
</p><p>“We do not even have to confine our prisoners,” continued Gapth,
“after we have so marked them that their ownership may always be
determined.”
</p><p>“How do you mark them?” I asked.
</p><p>“With heated irons we make the mark of the owner here,” and he
touched my forehead just above my eyes.
</p><p>“Pleasant,” I thought to myself, and then aloud: “Shall I belong to
you?”
</p><p>“I do not know,” he replied, “but you will belong to whomever The
Twentyfour allot you.”
</p><p>We moved on after we left the cave for a considerable period of time
in silence. I was busy making mental notes of every salient feature
that might be useful to me in retracing my steps, but I found nothing
other than a winding and gently ascending corridor, without crossings
or branches, until we reached the foot of a long flight of stone
steps at the summit of which we emerged into a large chamber in the
walls of which there must have been at least a dozen doorways, where,
to my great disappointment, I was immediately blindfolded. They
whirled me around then, but evidently it was done perfunctorily,
since it was exactly one full turn and I was halted in my tracks
facing precisely in the same direction that I had been before. This I
was positive of, for our powers of orientation are often tested in
this way in the air service. Then they marched me straight forward
across the room through a doorway directly opposite that at which I
had entered the chamber. I could tell when we left the larger chamber
and entered the corridor from the different sound which our footsteps
made. We advanced along this corridor ninety-seven paces, when we
turned abruptly to the right and at the end of thirty-three paces
emerged into another chamber, as I could easily tell again from the
sound of our footsteps the instant we crossed the threshold. They led
me about this chamber a couple of times with the evident intention of
bewildering me, but in this they did not succeed, for when they
turned again into a corridor I knew that it was the same corridor
from which I had just emerged and that I was retracing my steps. This
time they took me back thirty-three paces and then turned abruptly to
the right. I could not but smile to myself when I realized that we
were now continuing directly along the same corridor as that which we
had entered immediately after they had first blindfolded me, their
little excursion through the short corridor into the second chamber
having been but a ruse to bewilder me. A moment later, at the foot of
a flight of steps they removed the blind, evidently satisfied that
there was now no chance of my being able to retrace my steps and find
the main tunnel leading to the crater, while, as a matter of fact, I
could easily have retraced every foot of it blindfolded.
</p><p>From here on we climbed interminable stairways, passed through
numerous corridors and chambers, all of which were illuminated by the
radium-bearing substance which coated their walls and ceilings, and
then we emerged suddenly upon a terrace into the open air, and I
obtained my first view of a lunar city. It was built around a crater,
and the buildings were terraced back from the rim, the terraces being
generally devoted to the raising of garden truck and the principal
fruit-bearing trees and shrubs. The city extended upward several
hundred feet, the houses, as I learned later, being built one upon
another, the great majority of them, therefore, being without windows
looking upon the outer world.
</p><p>I was led along the terrace for a short distance, and during this
brief opportunity for observation I deduced that the cultivated
terraces lay upon the roofs of the tier of buildings next below. To
my right I could see the terraced steps extending downward to the rim
of the crater. Nearly all the terraces were covered with vegetation,
and in numerous places I saw what appeared to be Va-gas feeding upon
the plants, and this I later learned was the fact, and that the
Kalkars, when they are able to capture members of the race of Va-gas,
keep them in captivity and breed them as we breed cattle, for their
flesh. It is necessary, to some extent, to change the diet of the Vagas 
almost exclusively to vegetation, though this diet is
supplemented by the flesh of the Kalkars, and their Laythean slaves
who die, the Va-gas thus being compelled to serve the double purpose
of producing flesh for the Kalkars and acting as their scavengers as
well.
</p><p>Upon my left were the faces of buildings, uniformly two stories in
height, with an occasional slender tower rising fifteen, twenty or
sometimes as high as thirty feet from the terraced roofs above. It
was into one of these buildings that my captors led me after we had
proceeded a short distance along the terrace, and I found myself in a
large apartment in which were a number of male Kalkars, and at a desk
facing the entrance a large, entirely bald man who appeared to be of
considerable age. To this person I was led by Gapth, who narrated my
capture and the escape of Na-ee-lah.
</p><p>The fellow before whom I had been brought questioned me briefly. He
made no comment when I told him that I was from another world, but he
examined my garments rather carefully and then after a moment turned
to Gapth.
</p><p>“We will hold him for questioning by The Twentyfour,” he said. “If he
is not of Va-nah he is neither Kalkar nor Laythean, and consequently,
he must be flesh of a lower order and therefore may be eaten.” He
paused a moment and fell to examining a large book which seemed to be
filled with plans upon which strange hieroglyphics appeared. He
turned over several leaves, and finally coming evidently to the page
he sought, he ran a forefinger slowly over it until it came to rest
near the center of the plat. “You may confine him here,” he said to
Gapth, “in chamber eight of the twenty-fourth section, at the seventh
elevation, and you will produce him upon orders from The Twentyfour
when next they meet,” and then to me: “It is impossible for you to
escape from the city, but if you attempt it, it may be difficult for
us to find you again immediately and when we do you will be tortured
to death as an example to other slaves. Go!”
</p><p>I went; following Gapth and the others who had conducted me to the
presence of this creature. They led me back into the very corridor
from which we had emerged upon the terrace and then straight into the
heart of that amazing pile for fully half a mile, where they shoved
me roughly into an apartment at the right of the corridor with the
admonition that I stay there until I was wanted.
</p><p>I found myself in a dimly lighted, rectangular room, the air of which
was very poor, and at the first glance I discovered that I was not
alone, for upon a bench against the opposite wall sat a man. He
looked up as I entered and I saw that his features were very fine and
that he had black hair like Nah-ee-lah. He looked at me for a moment
with a puzzled expression in his eyes and then he addressed me.
</p><p>“You, too, are a slave?” he asked.
</p><p>“I am not a slave,” I replied, “I am a prisoner.”
</p><p>“It is all the same,” he said; “but from whence come you? I have
never seen your like before in Va-nah.”
</p><p>“I do not come from Va-nah,” I replied, and then I briefly explained
my origin and how I came to be in his world. He did not understand
me, I am sure, for although he seemed to be, and really was, highly
intelligent, he could not conceive of any condition concerning which
he had had no experience and in this way he did not differ materially
from intelligent and highly educated Earth Men.
</p><p>“And you,” I asked, at length—“you are not a Kalkar? From whence come
you?”
</p><p>“I am from Laythe,” he replied. “I fell outside the city and was
captured by one of their hunting parties.”
</p><p>“Why all this enmity,” I asked, “between the men of Laythe and the
Kalkars—who are the Kalkars, anyway?”
</p><p>“You are not of Va-nah,” he said, “that I can see, or you would not
ask these questions. The Kalkars derive their name from a corruption
of a word meaning The Thinkers. Ages ago we were one race, a
prosperous people living at peace with all the world of Va-nah. The
Va-gas we bred for flesh, as we do today within our own city of
Laythe and as the Kalkars do within their city. Our cities, towns and
villages covered the slopes of the mountains and stretched downward
to the sea. No corner of the three oceans but knew our ships, and our
cities were joined together by a network of routes along which passed
electrically driven trains”—he did not use the word trains, but an
expression which might be liberally translated as ships of the land—
“while other great carriers flew through the air. Our means of
communication between distant points were simplified by science
through the use of electrical energy, with the result that those who
lived in one part of Va-nah could talk with those who lived in any
other part of Va-nah, though it were to the remotest ends of the
world. There were ten great divisions, each ruled by its Jemadar, and
each division vied with all the others in the service which it
rendered to its people. There were those who held high positions and
those who held low; there were those who were rich and those who were
poor, but the favors of the state were distributed equally among
them, and the children of the poor had the same opportunities for
education as the children of the rich, and there it was that our
troubles first started. There is a saying among us that no learning
is better than a little, and I can well believe this true when I
consider the history of my world, where, as the masses became a
little educated, there developed among them a small coterie that
commenced to find fault with everyone who had achieved greater
learning or greater power than they. Finally, they organized
themselves into a secret society called The Thinkers, but known more
accurately to the rest of Va-nah as those who thought that they
thought. It is a long story, for it covers a great period of time,
but the result was that, slowly at first, and later rapidly, The
Thinkers, who did more talking than thinking, filled the people with
dissatisfaction, until at last they arose and took over the
government and commerce of the entire world. The Jemadars were
overthrown and the ruling class driven from power, the majority of
them being murdered, though some managed to escape, and it was these,
my ancestors, who founded the city of Laythe. It is believed that
there are other similar cities in remote parts of Va-nah inhabited by
the descendants of the Jemadar and noble classes, but Laythe is the
only one of which we have knowledge. The Thinkers would not work, and
the result was that both government and commerce fell into rapid
decay. They not only had neither the training nor the intelligence to
develop new things, but they could not carry out the old that had
been developed for them. The arts and sciences languished and died
with commerce and government, and Va-nah fell back into barbarism.
The Va-gas saw their chance and threw off the yoke that had held them
through countless ages. As the Kalkars had driven the noble class
into the lofty mountains, so the Va-gas drove the Kalkars.
Practically every vestige of the ancient culture and commercial
advancement of Va-nah has been wiped from the face of the world. The
Laytheans have held their own for many centuries, but their numbers
have not increased.
</p><p>“Many generations elapsed before the Laytheans found sanctuary in the
city of Laythe, and during that period they, too, lost all touch with
the science and advancement and the culture of the past. Nor was
there any way in which to rebuild what the Kalkars had torn down,
since they had destroyed every written record and every book in every
library in Va-nah. And so occupied are both races in eking out a
precarious existence that there is little likelihood that there will
ever again be any advancement made along these lines—it is beyond the
intellectual powers of the Kalkars, and the Laytheans are too weak
numerically to accomplish aught.”
</p><p>“It does look hopeless,” I said, “almost as hopeless as our
situation. There is no escape, I imagine, from this Kalkar city, is
there?”
</p><p>“No,” he said, “none whatever. There is only one avenue and we are so
confused when we are brought into the city that it would be
impossible for us to find our way out again through this labyrinth of
corridors and chambers.”
</p><p>“And if we did win our way to the outer world we would be as bad off,
I presume, for we could never find Laythe, and sooner or later would
be recaptured by the Kalkars or taken by the Va-gas. Am I not right?”
</p><p>“No,” he said, “you are not right. If I could reach the rim of the
crater beyond this city I could find my way to Laythe. I know the way
well, for I am one of Ko-tah’s hunters and am thoroughly familiar
with the country for great distances in all directions from Laythe.”
</p><p>So this was one of Ko-tah’s men. I was glad, indeed, that I had not
mentioned Nah-ee-lah or told him of her possible escape, or of my
acquaintance with her.
</p><p>“And who is Ko-tah?” I asked, feigning ignorance.
</p><p>“Ko-tah is the most powerful noble of Laythe,” he replied, “some day
he will be Jemadar, for now that Nah-ee-lah, the Princess, is dead,
and Sagroth, the Jemadar, grows old, it will not be long before there
is a change.”
</p><p>“And if the Princess should return to Laythe,” I asked, “would Ko-tah
still become Jemadar then, upon the death of Sagroth?”
</p><p>“He would become Jemadar in any event,” replied my companion, “for
had the Princess not been carried off by the air that runs away, Kotah 
would have married her, unless she refused, in which event she
might have died—people do die, you know.”
</p><p>“You feel no loyalty, then,” I asked, “for your old Jemadar, Sagroth,
or for his daughter, the Princess?”
</p><p>“On the contrary, I feel every loyalty toward them, but like many
others, I am afraid of Ko-tah, for he is very powerful and we know
that sooner or later he will become ruler of Laythe. That is why so
many of the high nobles have attached themselves to him—it is not
through love of Ko-tah, but through fear that he recruits his ranks.”
</p><p>“But the Princess!” I exclaimed, “would the nobles not rally to her
defense?”
</p><p>“What would be the use?” he asked. “We of Laythe do but exist in the
narrow confines of our prison city. There is no great future to which
we may look forward in this life, but future incarnations may hold
for us a brighter prospect. It is no cruelty, then, to kill those who
exist now under the chaotic reign of anarchy which has reduced Va-nah
to a wilderness.”
</p><p>I partially caught his rather hopeless point of view and realized
that the fellow was not bad or disloyal at heart, but like all his
race, reduced to a state of hopelessness that was the result of ages
of retrogression to which they could see no end.
</p><p>“I can find the way to the mouth of the tunnel where it opens into
the crater,” I told him. “But how can we reach it unarmed through a
city populated with our enemies who would slay us on sight?”
</p><p>“There are never very many people in the chambers or corridors far
removed from the outer terraces, and if we were branded upon the
forehead, as accepted slaves are, and your apparel was not so
noticeable, we might possibly reach the tunnel without weapons.”
</p><p>“Yes,” I said, “my clothes are a handicap. They would immediately
call attention to us; yet, it is worth risking, for I know that I can
find my way back to the crater and I should rather die than remain a
slave of the Kalkars.”
</p><p>The truth of the matter was that I was not prompted so much by
abhorrence of the fate that seemed in store for me, as by a desire to
learn if Nah-ee-lah had escaped. I was constantly haunted by the
horrid fear that her hold upon the rim of the crater had given and
that she had fallen into the abyss below. Gapth had thought that she
had escaped, but I knew that she might have fallen without either of
us having seen her, since the pole up which she had clambered had
been fastened a little beyond the opening of the tunnel, so that, had
her hold become loosened, she would not have fallen directly past the
aperture. The more I thought of it, the more anxious I became to
reach Laythe and institute a search for her.
</p><p>While we were still discussing our chances of escape, two slaves
brought us food in the shape of raw vegetables and fruit. I scanned
them carefully for weapons, but they had none, a circumstance to
which they may owe their lives. I could have used their garments, had
they been other than slaves, but I had hit upon a bolder plan than
this and must wait patiently for a favorable opportunity to put it
into practice.
</p><p>After eating I became sleepy and was about to stretch out upon the
floor of our prison when my companion, whose name was Moh-goh, told
me that there was a sleeping apartment adjoining the room in which we
were, that had been set apart for us.
</p><p>The doorway leading to the sleeping chamber was covered by heavy
hangings, and as I parted them and stepped into the adjoining
chamber, I found myself in almost total darkness, the walls and
ceiling of this room not having been treated with the illuminating
coating used in the corridors and apartments which they wished to
maintain in a lighted condition. I later learned that all their
sleeping apartments were thus naturally dark. In one corner of the
room was a pile of dried vegetation which I discovered must answer
the purpose of mattress and covering, should I require any. However,
I was not so particular, as I had been accustomed to only the
roughest of fare since I had left my luxurious stateroom aboard <u>The
Barsoom</u>. How long I slept I do not know, but I was awakened by Mohgoh 
calling me. He was leaning over me, shaking me by the shoulder.
</p><p>“You are wanted,” he whispered. “They have come to take us before The
Twentyfour.”
</p><p>“Tell them to go to the devil,” I said, for I was very sleepy and
only half awake. Of course, he did not know what devil meant, but
evidently he judged from my tone that my reply was disrespectful to
the Kalkars.
</p><p>“Do not anger them,” he said, “it will only make your fate the
harder. When The Twentyfour command, all must obey.”
</p><p>“Who are The Twentyfour?” I demanded.
</p><p>“They compose the committee that rules this Kalkar city.”
</p><p>I was thoroughly awakened now and rose to my feet, following him into
the adjoining chamber, where I saw two Kalkar warriors standing
impatiently awaiting us. As I saw them a phrase leaped to my brain
and kept repeating itself: “There are but two, there are but two.”
</p><p>They were across the room from us, standing by the entrance, and Mohgoh 
was close to me.
</p><p>“There are but two,” I whispered to him in a low voice, “you take one
and I will take the other. Do you dare?”
</p><p>“I will take the one at the right,” he replied, and together we
advanced across the room slowly toward the unsuspecting warriors. The
moment that we were in reach of them we leaped for them
simultaneously. I did not see how Moh-goh attacked his man, for I was
busy with my own, though it took me but an instant to settle him, for
I struck him a single terrific blow upon the chin and as he fell I
leaped upon him, wresting his dagger from its scabbard and plunging
it into his heart before he could regain his senses from the stunning
impact of my fist. Then I turned to assist Moh-goh, only to discover
that he needed no assistance, but was already arising from the body
of his antagonist, whose throat was cut from ear to ear with his own
weapon.
</p><p>“Quick!” I cried to Moh-goh, “drag them into the sleeping apartment
before we are discovered;” and a moment later we had deposited the
two corpses in the dimly lighted apartment adjoining.
</p><p>“We will leave the city as Kalkar warriors,” I said, commencing to
strip the accoutrements and garments from the man I had slain.
</p><p>Moh-goh grinned. “Not a bad idea,” he said. “If you can find the
route to the crater it is possible that we may yet escape.”
</p><p>It took us but a few moments to effect the change, and after we had
hidden the bodies beneath the vegetation that had served us as a bed
and stepped out into the other chamber, where we could have a good
look at one another, we realized that if we were not too closely
scrutinized we might pass safely through the corridors beneath the
Kalkar city, for the Kalkars are a mongrel breed, comprising many
divergent types. My complexion, which differed outrageously from that
of either the Kalkars or the Laytheans, constituted our greatest
danger, but we must take the chance, and at least we were armed.
</p><p>“Lead the way,” said Moh-goh, “and if you can find the crater I can
assure you that I can find Laythe.”
</p><p>“Very good,” I said, “come,” and stepping into the corridor I moved
off confidently in the direction that I knew I should find the
passageways and stairs along which I had been conducted from the
crater tunnel. I was as confident of success as though I were
traversing the most familiar precinct of my native city.
</p><p>We traveled a considerable distance without meeting anyone, and at
last reached the chamber in which I had been blindfolded. As we
entered it I saw fully a score of Kalkars lolling upon benches or
lying upon vegetation that was piled upon the floor. They looked up
as we entered, and at the same time Moh-goh stepped in front of me.
</p><p>“Who are you and where are you going?” demanded one of the Kalkars.
</p><p>“By order of The Twentyfour,” said Moh-goh, and stepped into the
room. Instantly I realized that he did not know in which direction to
go, and that by his hesitancy all might be lost.
</p><p>“Straight ahead, straight across the room,” I whispered to him, and
he stepped out briskly in the direction of the entrance to the
tunnel. Fortunately for us, the chamber was not brilliantly lighted,
and the Kalkars were at the far end of it; otherwise they must
certainly have discovered my deception, at least, since any sort of
close inspection would have revealed the fact that I was not of Vanah. 
However, they did not halt us, though I was sure that I saw one
of them eyeing me suspiciously, and I venture to say that I took the
last twenty steps without drawing a breath.
</p><p>It was quickly over, however, and we had entered the tunnel which now
led without further confusing ramifications directly to the crater.
</p><p>“We were fortunate,” I said to Moh-goh.
</p><p>“That we were,” he replied.
</p><p>In silence, then, that we might listen for pursuit, or for the sound
of Kalkars ahead of us, we hastened rapidly along the descending
passageway toward the mouth of the tunnel where it opened into the
crater; and at last, as we rounded the last turn and I saw the light
of day ahead of me, I breathed a deep sigh of relief, though almost
simultaneously my happiness turned to despair at the sudden
recollection that there were no hooked poles here to assist us to the
summit of the crater wall. What were we to do?
</p><p>“Moh-goh,” I said, turning to my companion as we halted at the end of
the tunnel, “there are no poles with which to ascend. I had forgotten
it, but in order to prevent the Kalkars from ascending after me, I
threw all but one into the abyss, and that one slipped from the rim
and was lost also, just as my pursuers were about to seize me.”
</p><p>I had not told Moh-goh that I had had a companion, since it would be
difficult to answer any questions he might propound on the subject
without revealing the identity of Nah-ee-lah.
</p><p>“Oh, we can overcome that,” replied my companion. “We have these two
spears, which are extremely stout, and inasmuch as we shall have
plenty of time, we can easily arrange them in some way that will
permit us to ascend to the summit of the crater. It is very fortunate
that we were not pursued.”
</p><p>The Kalkars' spears had a miniature crescent-shaped hook at the base
of their point similar to the larger ones effected by the Va-gas. Mohgoh 
thought that we could fasten the two spears securely together and
then catch the small hook of the upper one upon the rim of the
crater, testing its hold thoroughly before either of us attempted to
ascend. Beneath his tunic he wore a rope coiled around his waist
which he explained to me was a customary part of the equipment of all
Laytheans. It was his idea to tie one end of this around the waist of
whichever of us ascended first, the other going as far back into the
tunnel as possible and bracing himself, so that in the event that the
climber fell, he would be saved from death, though I figured that he
would get a rather nasty shaking up and some bad bruises, under the
best of circumstances.
</p><p>I volunteered to go first and began fastening one end of the rope
securely about my waist while Moh-goh made the two spears fast
together with a short length that he had cut from the other end. He
worked rapidly, with deft, nimble fingers, and seemed to know pretty
well what he was doing. In the event that I reached the summit in
safety, I was to pull up the spears and then haul Moh-goh up by the
rope.
</p><p>Having fastened the rope to my satisfaction, I stood as far out upon
the ledge before the entrance to the tunnel as I safely could, and
with my back toward the crater looked up at the rim twenty feet above
me, in a vain attempt to select from below, if possible, a reasonably
secure point upon which to hook the spear. As I stood thus upon the
edge of eternity, steadying myself with one hand against the tunnel
wall, there came down to me from out of the tunnel a noise which I
could not mistake. Moh-goh heard it, too, and looked at me, with a
rueful shake of his head and a shrug of his shoulders.
</p><p>“Everything is against us, Earth Man,” he said, for this was the name
he had given me when I told him what my world was called.
