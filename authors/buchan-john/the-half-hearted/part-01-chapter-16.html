<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>At Mrs. Montrayner's dinner parties a world of silent men is
sandwiched between a <em>monde</em> of chattering women. The hostess
has a taste for busy celebrities who eat their dinner without
thought of the cookery, and regard their fair neighbours much
as the diners think of the band in a restaurant. She chose her
company with care, and if at her table there was not the busy
clack of a fluent conversation, there was always the possibility
of <em>bons mots</em> and the off-chance of a State secret. So
to have dined with the Montrayners became a boast in a small social
set, and to the unilluminate the Montrayner banquets seemed scarce
less momentous than Cabinet meetings.</p>

<p>Wratislaw found himself staring dully at a snowy bank of flowers
and looking listlessly at the faces beyond. He was extremely worried,
and his grey face and sunken eyes showed the labour he had been
passing through. The country was approaching the throes of a crisis,
and as yet the future was a blind alley to him. There was an autumn
session, and he had been badgered all the afternoon in the Commons;
his even temper had been perilously near its limits, and he had
been betrayed unconsciously into certain ineptitudes which he
knew would grin in his face on the morrow from a dozen leading
articles. The Continent seemed on the edge of an outbreak; in
the East especially, Russia by a score of petty acts had seemed
to foreshadow an incomprehensible policy. It was a powder-barrel
waiting for the spark; and he felt dismally that the spark might
come at any moment from some unlooked-for quarter of the globe.
He ran over in his mind the position of foreign affairs. All seemed
vaguely safe; and yet he was conscious that all was vaguely unsettled.
The world was on the eve of one of its cyclic changes, and unrest
seemed to make the air murky.</p>

<p>He tried to be polite and listened attentively to the lady on
his right, who was telling him the latest gossip about a certain
famous marriage. But his air was so manifestly artificial that
she turned to the presumably more attractive topic of his doings.</p>

<p>"You look ill," she said&mdash;she was one who adopted the motherly
air towards young men, which only a pretty woman can use. "Are
they over-working you in the House?"</p>

<p>"Pretty fair," and he smiled grimly. "But really I can't complain.
I have had eight hours' sleep in the last four days, and I don't
think Beauregard could say as much. Some day I shall break loose
and go to a quiet place and sleep for a week. Brittany would do&mdash;or
Scotland."</p>

<p>"I was in Scotland last week," she said. "I didn't find it quiet.
It was at one of those theatrical Highland houses where they pipe
you to sleep and pipe you to breakfast. I used to have to sit
up all night by the fire and read Marius the Epicurean, to compose
myself. Did you ever try the specific?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, laughing. "I always soothe my nerves with Blue-books."</p>

<p>She made a mouth at the thought. "And do you know I met such
a nice man up there, who said you were a great friend of his?
His name was Haystoun."</p>

<p>"Do you remember his Christian name?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Lewis," she said without hesitation.</p>

<p>He laughed. "He is a man who should only have one name and that
his Christian one. I never heard him called 'Haystoun' in my life.
How is he?"</p>

<p>"He seemed well, but he struck me as being at rather a loose
end. What is wrong with him? You know him well and can tell me.
He seems to have nothing to do; to have fallen out of his niche,
you know. And he looks so extraordinarily clever."</p>

<p>"He <em>is</em> extraordinarily clever. But if I undertook to
tell you what was wrong with Lewie Haystoun, I should never get
to the House to-night. The vitality of a great family has run
to a close in him. He is strong and able, and yet, unless the
miracle of miracles happens, he will never do anything. Two hundred
years ago he might have led some mad Jacobite plot to success.
Three hundred and he might have been another Raleigh. Six hundred,
and there would have been a new crusade. But as it is, he is out
of harmony with his times; life is too easy and mannered; the
field for a man's courage is in petty and recondite things, and
Lewie is not fitted to understand it. And all this, you see, spells
a kind of cowardice: and if you have a friend who is a hero out
of joint, a great man smothered in the wrong sort of civilization,
and all the while one who is building up for himself with the
world and in his own heart the reputation of a coward, you naturally
grow hot and bitter."</p>

<p>The lady looked curiously at the speaker. She had never heard
the silent politician speak so earnestly before.</p>

<p>"It seems to me a clear case of <em>chercher la femme</em>,"
said she.</p>

<p>"That," said Wratislaw with emphasis, "is the needle-point of
the whole business. He has fallen in love with just the wrong
sort of woman. Very pretty, very good, a demure puritanical little
Pharisee, clever enough, too, to see Lewie's merits, too weak
to hope to remedy them, and too full of prejudice to accept them.
There you have the makings of a very pretty tragedy."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," said the lady. She was touched by this man's
anxiety for his friend, and Mr. Lewis Haystoun, whom she was never
likely to meet again, became a figure of interest in her eyes.
She turned to say something more, but Wratislaw, having unburdened
his soul to some one, and feeling a little relieved, was watching
his chief's face further down the table. That nobleman, hopelessly
ill at ease, had given up the pretence of amiability and was now
making frantic endeavours to send mute signals across the flowers
to his under secretary.</p>

<p>The Montrayner guests seldom linger. Within half an hour after
the ladies left the table Beauregard and Wratislaw were taking
leave and hurrying into their greatcoats.</p>

<p>"You are going down to the House," said the elder man, "and I'll
come too. I want to have some talk with you. I tried to catch
your eye at dinner to get you to come round and deliver me from
old Montrayner, for I had to sit on his right hand and couldn't
come round to you. Heigho-ho! I wish I was a Trappist."</p>

<p>The cab had turned out of Piccadilly into St. James's Street
before either man spoke again. The tossing lights of a windy autumn
evening were shimmering on the wet pavement, and faces looked
spectral white in the morris-dance of shine and shadow. Wratislaw,
whose soul was sick for high, clean winds and the great spaces
of the moors, was thinking of Glenavelin and Lewis and the strong,
quickening north. His companion was furrowing his brow over some
knotty problem in his duties.</p>

<p>In Pall Mall there was a lull in the noise, but neither seemed
disposed to talk.</p>

<p>"We had better wait till we get to the House," said Beauregard.
"We must have peace, for I have got the most vexatious business
to speak about." And again he wrinkled his anxious brows and stared
in front of him.</p>

<p>They entered a private room where the fire had burned itself
out, and the lights fell on heavy furniture and cheerless solitude.
Beauregard spread himself out in an arm-chair, and stared at the
ceiling. Wratislaw, knowing his chief's manners, stood before
the blackened grate and waited.</p>

<p>"Fetch me an atlas&mdash;that big one, and find the map of the Indian
frontier." Wratislaw obeyed and stretched the huge folio on the
table.</p>

<p>The elder man ran his forefinger in a circle.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;that wretched radius is the plague of my life. Our reports
stop short at that line, and reliable information begins again
some hundreds of miles north. Meanwhile&mdash;between?" And he shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I got news to-day in a roundabout way from Taghati. That's the
town just within the Russian frontier there. It seems that the
whole country is in a ferment. The hill tribes are out and the
Russian frontier line is threatened. So they say. I have the actual
names of the people who are making the row. Russian troops are
being massed along the line there. The whole place, you know,
has been for long a military beehive and absurdly over-garrisoned,
so there is no difficulty about the massing. The difficulty lies
in the reason. Three thousand square miles or so of mountain cannot
be so dangerous. One would think that the whole Afghan nation
was meditating a descent on the Amu Daria." He glanced up at his
companion, and the two men saw the same anxiety in each other's
eyes.</p>

<p>"Anything more of Marka?" asked Wratislaw.</p>

<p>"Nothing definite. He is somewhere in the Pamirs, up to some
devilry or other. Oh, by the by, there is something I have forgotten.
I found out the other day that our gentleman had been down quite
recently in south-west Kashmir. He was Arthur Marker at the time,
the son of a German count and a Scotch mother, you understand.
Immensely popular, too, among natives and Europeans alike. He
went south from Bardur, and apparently returned north by the Punjab.
At Bardur, Logan and Thwaite were immensely fascinated, Gribton
remained doubtful. Now the good Gribton is coming home, and so
he will have the place for a happy hunting-ground."</p>

<p>Wratislaw was puffing his under-lip in deep thought. "It is a
sweet business," he said. "But what can we do? Only wait?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one could wait if Marka were the only disquieting feature.
But what about Taghati and the Russian activity? What on earth
is going on or about to go on in this square inch of mountain
land to make all the pother? If it is a tribal war on a first-class
scale then we must know about it, for it is in the highest degree
our concern too. If it is anything else, things look more than
doubtful. All the rest I don't mind. It's open and obvious, and
we are on the alert. But that little bit of frontier there is
so little known and apparently so remote that I begin to be afraid
of trouble in that direction. What do you think?"</p>

<p>Wratislaw shook his head. He had no opinion to offer.</p>

<p>"At any rate, you need fear no awkward questions in the House,
for this sort of thing cannot be public for months."</p>

<p>"I am wondering whether somebody should not go out. Somebody
quite unofficial and sufficiently clever."</p>

<p>"My thought too," said Beauregard. "The pinch is where to get
our man from. I have been casting up possibilities all day, and
this one is too clever, another too dull, another too timid, and
another too hare-brained."</p>

<p>Wratislaw seemed sunk in a brown study.</p>

<p>"Do you remember my telling you once about my friend Lewis Haystoun?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I remember perfectly. What made him get so badly beaten? He
ought to have won."</p>

<p>"That's part of my point," said the other. "If I knew him less
well than I do I should say he was the man cut out by Providence
for the work. He has been to the place, he knows the ropes of
travelling, he is exceedingly well-informed, and he is uncommonly
clever. But he is badly off colour. The thing might be the saving
of him, or the ruin&mdash;in which case, of course, he would also be
the ruin of the thing."</p>

<p>"As risky as that?" Beauregard asked. "I have heard something
of him, but I thought it merely his youth. What's wrong with him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't tell. A thousand things, but all might be done away
with by a single chance like this. I tell you what I'll do. After
to-night I can be spared for a couple of days. I feel rather hipped
myself, so I shall get up to the north and see my man. I know
the circumstances and I know Lewis. If the two are likely to suit
each other I have your authority to give him your message?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear Wratislaw. I have all the confidence in the
world in your judgment. You will be back the day after to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"I shall only be out of the House one night, and I think the
game worth it. I need not tell you that I am infernally anxious
both about the business and my friend. It is just on the cards
that one might be the solution of the other."</p>

<p>"You understand everything?"</p>

<p>"Everything. I promise you I shall be exacting enough. And now
I had better be looking after my own work."</p>

<p>Beauregard stared after him as he went out of the room and remained
for a few minutes in deep thought. Then he deliberately wrote
out a foreign telegram form and rang the bell.</p>

<p>"I fancy I know the man," he said to himself. "He will go. Meantime
I can prepare things for his passage." The telegram was to the
fugitive Gribton at Florence, asking him to meet a certain Mr.
Haystoun at the Embassy in Paris within a week for the discussion
of a particular question.</p>
