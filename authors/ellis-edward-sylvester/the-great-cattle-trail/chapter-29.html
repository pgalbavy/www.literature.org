<p>Without hesitation the mustang was after the stubborn steer again,
showing less fear than before, though he maintained a sharp lookout
against a repetition of the attack. It may have been that the
dexterous manner in which he had just eluded the brute gave him
self-confidence, as it weakened that of the fugitive without lessening
his obduracy, for he took care that the line of his flight led
straight away from his own herd.</p>

<p>With the same care Thunderbolt began edging up, and, in a brief
while, his head was abreast of the haunch of the steer, and steadily
gaining. Avon now leaned over the right shoulder of his mustang,
and reaching forward and downward, seized the tail of the steer,
and in a flash twisted all that was sufficiently flexible around
the horn of his saddle. At the same instant he called sharply
to Thunderbolt, who made a vicious bound to the left, and the
steer, with a short bellow of pain, went down with fearful violence.</p>

<p>But he was not yet conquered. As full of energy and obstinacy
as ever, he seemed to leap to his feet as if made of rubber, but
without attempting to resent the indignity he had suffered, he
continued his impetuous flight.</p>

<p>The brief interval had given Avon time in which to uncoil his
rope. Instead of flinging it over the horns of the steer he dexterously
caught the loop around one of his hind legs, and jerked it taut
with the quickness of lightning. Down went the animal again, kicking
and bellowing and struggling hard to regain his feet.</p>

<p>The youth allowed him to succeed, when, with the help of the
mustang, he was thrown again. This was repeated several times,
until it was apparent that the captive was subdued. Finally, after
receiving another fall, he refused to try to regain his feet.</p>

<p>Avon now managed to loosen the loop sufficiently to slip it off
the imprisoned leg. Then, holding several coils in his grasp,
he reached over and gave the panting animal several resounding
whacks on his ribs.</p>

<p>He smiled as the brute hastily clambered up, and, turning his
nose toward the other cattle a considerable distance off, broke
into a trot after them, still bellowing as if asking them to wait
until he could join them. No refractory urchin was ever brought
to terms with more completeness than was the defiant steer.</p>

<p>Now that the disciplined animal was travelling in the right direction,
his conqueror also faced Captain Shirril, who had been watching
him with much interest, while the cattle were stringing along
at a rapid gallop in the direction of the ridge beyond which lay
the invisible camp of the cowmen.</p>

<p>The lull in the stirring proceeding led Avon to recall the mishap
of Shackaye, who had escaped the horns of the other steer by such
a narrow chance. He cast his eye toward the body of the dead animal
plainly seen across the prairie, but the young Comanche himself
was not in sight. He concluded that he must have remounted his
mustang and galloped back to camp. Possibly he had received some
injury from his fall which placed it beyond his power to help
in the work of gathering the stray members of the herd.</p>

<p>Avon turned his attention to his relative, when he was astonished
to perceive fully a dozen horsemen a short distance off between
him and the ridge.</p>

<p>The first natural thought of the youth was that the party at
the camp had ridden out to their help, but he instantly saw that
such could not be the case, since there were so many of them,
and it did not require a second glance to ascertain that each
one was a mounted Indian.</p>

<p>The first emotion following this discovery was that of a wonderment
as to what it could all mean. It was not remarkable that they
should encounter Indians, while crossing the section set apart
especially for their occupancy, nor was anything to be feared
from them unless the temptation to violence became unusually strong
on the part of the red men.</p>

<p>But there was something ominous in the sudden and singular appearance
of these dusky plainsmen. They had shown up unexpectedly, the
indication being that they had emerged from a group of hills a
short distance to the eastward. Colonel Sclevinger and his herd
were beyond sight, so that the two friends were in anything but
a pleasant situation.</p>

<p>But while it looked as if the Indians must be friendly from force
of circumstances, their conduct justified the grave alarm Avon
felt on first seeing them. Perceiving they were discovered, they
broke into a rapid gallop beyond the unsuspicious Captain Shirril,
spreading apart like a fan, as if they meant to inclose him in
the circle beyond escape.</p>

<p>A shout from the young man caused his uncle to look around, when
he discovered what was going on. He instantly touched his animal
with his spurs and sent him swiftly toward Avon, who advanced
to meet him.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked the younger as they came together.</p>

<p>"It means mischief," was the reply. "I believe some of them belong
to the party that tried to burn our house."</p>

<p>"Then they are Comanches?"</p>

<p>"Every one of them&mdash;where's Shackaye?" abruptly asked the captain,
as if the naming of the tribe had recalled that interesting youth
to his mind.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't wonder if he were among them," replied Avon, with
a certain grim pleasure, as he recalled the faith his uncle had
shown in the savage in the face of Gleeson's warnings.</p>

<p>"Like enough," remarked the captain, watching the actions of
the warriors, who had diverged so far already that it was impossible
for the couple to escape in any direction without coming in collision
with them; "we've got to stand them off."</p>

<p>Without any appearance of alarm in his manner Captain Shirril
slipped down from his saddle, his nephew being but a few seconds
behind him, and the two coolly prepared to make a stand against
the attack of the Comanches.</p>
