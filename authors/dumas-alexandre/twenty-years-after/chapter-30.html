<P>The halt at Noyon was but brief, every one there being
wrapped in profound sleep. Raoul had desired to be awakened
should Grimaud arrive, but Grimaud did not arrive.
Doubtless, too, the horses on their part appreciated the
eight hours of repose and the abundant stabling which was
granted them. The Count de Guiche was awakened at five
o'clock in the morning by Raoul, who came to wish him
good-day. They breakfasted in haste, and at six o'clock had
already gone ten miles.</P>
<P>The young count's conversation was most interesting to
Raoul, therefore he listened much, whilst the count talked
well and long. Brought up in Paris, where Raoul had been but
once; at the court, which Raoul had never seen; his follies
as page; two duels, which he had already found the means of
fighting, in spite of the edicts against them and, more
especially, in spite of his tutor's vigilance  -  these
things excited the greatest curiosity in Raoul. Raoul had
only been at M. Scarron's house; he named to Guiche the
people whom he had seen there. Guiche knew everybody  - 
Madame de Neuillan, Mademoiselle d'Aubigne, Mademoiselle de
Scudery, Mademoiselle Paulet, Madame de Chevreuse. He
criticised everybody humorously. Raoul trembled, lest he
should laugh among the rest at Madame de Chevreuse, for whom
he entertained deep and genuine sympathy, but either
instinctively, or from affection for the duchess, he said
everything in her favor. His praises increased Raoul's
friendship twofold. Then came the question of gallantry and
love affairs. Under this head, also, Bragelonne had much
more to hear than to tell. He listened attentively and
fancied that he discovered through three or four rather
frivolous adventures, that the count, like himself, had a
secret to hide in the depths of his heart.</P>
<P>De Guiche, as we have said before, had been educated at the
court, and the intrigues of this court were not unknown to
him. It was the same court of which Raoul had so often heard
the Comte de la Fere speak, except that its aspect had much
changed since the period when Athos had himself been part of
it; therefore everything which the Count de Guiche related
was new to his traveling companion. The young count, witty
and caustic, passed all the world in review; the queen
herself was not spared, and Cardinal Mazarin came in for his
share of ridicule.</P>
<P>The day passed away as rapidly as an hour. The count's
tutor, a man of the world and a bon vivant, up to his eyes
in learning, as his pupil described him, often recalled the
profound erudition, the witty and caustic satire of Athos to
Raoul; but as regarded grace, delicacy, and nobility of
external appearance, no one in these points was to be
compared to the Comte de la Fere.</P>
<P>The horses, which were more kindly used than on the previous
day, stopped at Arras at four o'clock in the evening. They
were approaching the scene of war; and as bands of Spaniards
sometimes took advantage of the night to make expeditions
even as far as the neighborhood of Arras, they determined to
remain in the town until the morrow. The French army held
all between Pont-a-Marc as far as Valenciennes, falling back
upon Douai. The prince was said to be in person at Bethune.</P>
<P>The enemy's army extended from Cassel to Courtray; and as
there was no species of violence or pillage it did not
commit, the poor people on the frontier quitted their
isolated dwellings and fled for refuge into the strong
cities which held out a shelter to them. Arras was
encumbered with fugitives. An approaching battle was much
spoken of, the prince having manoeuvred, until that
movement, only in order to await a reinforcement that had
just reached him.</P>
<P>The young men congratulated themselves on having arrived so
opportunely. The evening was employed in discussing the war;
the grooms polished their arms; the young men loaded the
pistols in case of a skirmish, and they awoke in despair,
having both dreamed that they had arrived too late to
participate in the battle. In the morning it was rumored
that Prince de Conde had evacuated Bethune and fallen back
on Carvin, leaving, however, a strong garrison in the former
city.</P>
<P>But as there was nothing positively certain in this report,
the young warriors decided to continue their way toward
Bethune, free on the road to diverge to the right and march
to Carvin if necessary.</P>
<P>The count's tutor was well acquainted with the country; he
consequently proposed to take a crossroad, which lay between
that of Lens and that of Bethune. They obtained information
at Ablain, and a statement of their route was left for
Grimaud. About seven o'clock in the morning they set out. De
Guiche, who was young and impulsive, said to Raoul, &quot;Here we
are, three masters and three servants. Our valets are well
armed and yours seems to be tough enough.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have never seen him put to the test,&quot; replied Raoul, &quot;but
he is a Breton, which promises something.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; resumed De Guiche; &quot;I am sure he can fire a
musket when required. On my side I have two sure men, who
have been in action with my father. We therefore represent
six fighting men; if we should meet a little troop of
enemies, equal or even superior in number to our own, shall
we charge them, Raoul?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, sir,&quot; replied the viscount.</P>
<P>&quot;Holloa! young people  -  stop there!&quot; said the tutor,
joining in the conversation. &quot;Zounds! how you manoeuvre my
instructions, count! You seem to forget the orders I
received to conduct you safe and sound to his highness the
prince! Once with the army you may be killed at your good
pleasure; but until that time, I warn you that in my
capacity of general of the army I shall order a retreat and
turn my back on the first red coat we come across.&quot; De
Guiche and Raoul glanced at each other, smiling.</P>
<P>They arrived at Ablain without accident. There they inquired
and learned that the prince had in reality quitted Bethune
and stationed himself between Cambria and La Venthie.
Therefore, leaving directions at every place for Grimaud,
they took a crossroad which conducted the little troop by
the bank of a small stream flowing into the Lys. The country
was beautiful, intersected by valleys as green as the
emerald. Here and there they passed little copses crossing
the path which they were following. In anticipation of some
ambuscade in each of these little woods the tutor placed his
two servants at the head of the band, thus forming the
advance guard. Himself and the two young men represented the
body of the army, whilst Olivain, with his rifle upon his
knee and his eyes upon the watch, protected the rear.</P>
<P>They had observed for some time before them, on the horizon,
a rather thick wood; and when they had arrived at a distance
of a hundred steps from it, Monsieur d'Arminges took his
usual precautions and sent on in advance the count's two
grooms. The servants had just disappeared under the trees,
followed by the tutor, and the young men were laughing and
talking about a hundred yards off. Olivain was at the same
distance in the rear, when suddenly there resounded five or
six musket-shots. The tutor cried halt; the young men
obeyed, pulling up their steeds, and at the same moment the
two valets were seen returning at a gallop.</P>
<P>The young men, impatient to learn the cause of the firing,
spurred on toward the servants. The tutor followed them.</P>
<P>&quot;Were you stopped?&quot; eagerly inquired the two youths.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; replied the servants, &quot;it is even probable that we
have not been seen; the shots were fired about a hundred
paces in advance of us, in the thickest part of the wood,
and we returned to ask your advice.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My advice is this,&quot; said Monsieur d'Arminges, &quot;and if needs
be, my will, that we beat a retreat. There may be an
ambuscade concealed in this wood.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Did you see nothing there?&quot; asked the count.</P>
<P>&quot;I thought I saw,&quot; said one of the servants, &quot;horsemen
dressed in yellow, creeping along the bed of the stream.</P>
<P>&quot;That's it,&quot; said the tutor. &quot;We have fallen in with a party
of Spaniards. Come back, sirs, back.&quot;</P>
<P>The two youths looked at each other, and at this moment a
pistol-shot and cries for help were heard. Another glance
between the young men convinced them both that neither had
any wish to go back, and as the tutor had already turned his
horse's head, they both spurred forward, Raoul crying:
&quot;Follow me, Olivain!&quot; and the Count de Guiche: &quot;Follow,
Urban and Planchet!&quot; And before the tutor could recover from
his surprise they had both disappeared into the forest.
Whilst they spurred their steeds they held their pistols
ready also. In five minutes they arrived at the spot whence
the noise had proceeded, and then restraining their horses,
they advanced cautiously.</P>
<P>&quot;Hush,&quot; whispered De Guiche, &quot;these are cavaliers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, three on horseback and three who have dismounted.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Can you see what they are doing?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, they appear to be searching a wounded or dead man.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is some cowardly assassination,&quot; said De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;They are soldiers, though,&quot; resumed De Bragelonne.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, skirmishers; that is to say, highway robbers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At them!&quot; cried Raoul. &quot;At them!&quot; echoed De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! gentlemen! gentlemen! in the name of Heaven!&quot; cried the
poor tutor.</P>
<P>But he was not listened to, and his cries only served to
arouse the attention of the Spaniards.</P>
<P>The men on horseback at once rushed at the two youths,
leaving the three others to complete the plunder of the dead
or wounded travelers; for on approaching nearer, instead of
one extended figure, the young men discovered two. De Guiche
fired the first shot at ten paces and missed his man; and
the Spaniard, who had advanced to meet Raoul, aimed in his
turn, and Raoul felt a pain in the left arm, similar to that
of a blow from a whip. He let off his fire at but four
paces. Struck in the breast and extending his arms, the
Spaniard fell back on the crupper, and the terrified horse,
turning around, carried him off.</P>
<P>Raoul at this moment perceived the muzzle of a gun pointed
at him, and remembering the recommendation of Athos, he,
with the rapidity of lightning, made his horse rear as the
shot was fired. His horse bounded to one side, losing its
footing, and fell, entangling Raoul's leg under its body.
The Spaniard sprang forward and seized the gun by its
muzzle, in order to strike Raoul on the head with the butt.
In the position in which Raoul lay, unfortunately, he could
neither draw his sword from the scabbard, nor his pistols
from their holsters. The butt end of the musket hovered over
his head, and he could scarcely restrain himself from
closing his eyes, when with one bound Guiche reached the
Spaniard and placed a pistol at his throat. &quot;Yield!&quot; he
cried, &quot;or you are a dead man!&quot; The musket fell from the
soldier's hands, who yielded on the instant. Guiche summoned
one of his grooms, and delivering the prisoner into his
charge, with orders to shoot him through the head if he
attempted to escape, he leaped from his horse and approached
Raoul.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, sir,&quot; said Raoul, smiling, although his pallor
betrayed the excitement consequent on a first affair, &quot;you
are in a great hurry to pay your debts and have not been
long under any obligation to me. Without your aid,&quot;
continued he, repeating the count's words &quot;I should have
been a dead man  -  thrice dead.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;My antagonist took flight,&quot; replied De Guiche &quot;and left me
at liberty to come to your assistance. But are you seriously
wounded? I see you are covered with blood!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I believe,&quot; said Raoul, &quot;that I have got something like a
scratch on the arm. If you will help me to drag myself from
under my horse I hope nothing need prevent us continuing our
journey.&quot;</P>
<P>Monsieur d'Arminges and Olivain had already dismounted and
were attempting to raise the struggling horse. At last Raoul
succeeded in drawing his foot from the stirrup and his leg
from under the animal, and in a second he was on his feet
again.</P>
<P>&quot;Nothing broken?&quot; asked De Guiche.</P>
<P>&quot;Faith, no, thank Heaven!&quot; replied Raoul; &quot;but what has
become of the poor wretches whom these scoundrels were
murdering?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I fear we arrived too late. They have killed them, I think,
and taken flight, carrying off their booty. My servants are
examining the bodies.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go and see whether they are quite dead, or if they
can still be helped,&quot; suggested Raoul. &quot;Olivain, we have
come into possession of two horses, but I have lost my own.
Take for yourself the better of the two and give me yours.&quot;</P>
<P>They approached the spot where the unfortunate victims lay.</P></article>
