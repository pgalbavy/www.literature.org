<p>When Dick and Lawless were suffered to steal, by a back way, out of the
house where Lord Risingham held his garrison, the evening had already
come.
</p><p>They paused in shelter of the garden wall to consult on their best
course. The danger was extreme. If one of Sir Daniel's men caught sight
of them and raised the view-hallo, they would be run down and butchered
instantly. And not only was the town of Shoreby a mere net of peril for
their lives, but to make for the open country was to run the risk of the
patrols.
</p><p>A little way off, upon some open ground, they spied a windmill standing;
and hard by that, a very large granary with open doors.
</p><p>"How if we lay there until the night fall?" Dick proposed.
</p><p>And Lawless having no better suggestion to offer, they made a straight
push for the granary at a run, and concealed themselves behind the door
among some straw. The daylight rapidly departed; and presently the moon
was silvering the frozen snow. Now or never was their opportunity to
gain the Goat and Bagpipes unobserved and change their tell-tale
garments. Yet even then it was advisable to go round by the outskirts,
and not run the gauntlet of the market-place, where, in the concourse of
people, they stood the more imminent peril to be recognised and slain.
</p><p>This course was a long one. It took them not far from the house by the
beach, now lying dark and silent, and brought them forth at last by the
margin of the harbour. Many of the ships, as they could see by the clear
moonshine, had weighed anchor, and, profiting by the calm sky, proceeded
for more distant parts; answerably to this, the rude alehouses along the
beach (although, in defiance of the curfew law, they still shone with
fire and candle) were no longer thronged with customers, and no longer
echoed to the chorus of sea-songs.
</p><p>Hastily, half running, with their monkish raiment kilted to the knee,
they plunged through the deep snow and threaded the labyrinth of marine
lumber; and they were already more than half-way round the harbour when,
as they were passing close before an alehouse, the door suddenly opened
and let out a gush of light upon their fleeting figures.
</p><p>Instantly they stopped, and made believe to be engaged in earnest
conversation.
</p><p>Three men, one after another, came out of the alehouse, and the last
closed the door behind him. All three were unsteady upon their feet, as
if they had passed the day in deep potations, and they now stood
wavering in the moonlight, like men who knew not what they would be
after. The tallest of the three was talking in a loud, lamentable
voice.
</p><p>"Seven pieces of as good Gascony as ever a tapster broached," he was
saying, "the best ship out o' the port o' Dartmouth, a Virgin Mary
parcel-gilt, thirteen pounds of good gold money----"
</p><p>"I have had losses, too," interrupted one of the others. "I have had
losses of mine own, gossip Arblaster. I was robbed at Martinmas of five
shillings and a leather wallet well worth ninepence farthing."
</p><p>Dick's heart smote him at what he heard. Until that moment he had not
perhaps thought twice of the poor skipper who had been ruined by the
loss of the <u>Good Hope</u>; so careless, in those days, were men who wore
arms of the goods and interests of their inferiors. But this sudden
encounter reminded him sharply of the high-handed manner and ill-ending
of his enterprise; and both he and Lawless turned their heads the other
way, to avoid the chance of recognition.
</p><p>The ship's dog had, however, made his escape from the wreck and found
his way back again to Shoreby. He was now at Arblaster's heels, and
suddenly sniffing and pricking his ears, he darted forward and began to
bark furiously at the two sham friars.
</p><p>His master unsteadily followed him.
</p><p>"Hey, shipmates!" he cried. "Have ye ever a penny piece for a poor old
shipman, clean destroyed by pirates? I am a man that would have paid for
you both o' Thursday morning; and now here I be, o' Saturday night,
begging for a flagon of ale! Ask my man Tom, if ye misdoubt me. Seven
pieces of good Gascon wine, a ship that was mine own, and was my
father's before me, a Blessed Mary of plane-tree wood and parcel-gilt,
and thirteen pounds in gold and silver. Hey! what say ye? A man that
fought the French, too; for I have fought the French; I have cut more
French throats upon the high seas than ever a man that sails out of
Dartmouth. Come, a penny piece."
</p><p>Neither Dick nor Lawless durst answer him a word, lest he should
recognise their voices; and they stood there as helpless as a ship
ashore, not knowing where to turn nor what to hope.
</p><p>"Are ye dumb, boy?" inquired the skipper. "Mates," he added, with a
hiccup, "they be dumb. I like not this manner of discourtesy; for an a
man be dumb, so be as he's courteous, he will still speak when he was
spoken to, methinks."
</p><p>By this time the sailor, Tom, who was a man of great personal strength,
seemed to have conceived some suspicion of these two speechless figures;
and being soberer than his captain, stepped suddenly before him, took
Lawless roughly by the shoulder, and asked him, with an oath, what ailed
him that he held his tongue. To this the outlaw, thinking all was over,
made answer by a wrestling feint that stretched the sailor on the sand,
and, calling upon Dick to follow him, took to his heels among the
lumber.
</p><p>The affair passed in a second. Before Dick could run at all, Arblaster
had him in his arms; Tom, crawling on his face, had caught him by one
foot, and the third man had a drawn cutlass brandishing above his head.
</p><p>It was not so much the danger, it was not so much the annoyance, that
now bowed down the spirits of young Shelton; it was the profound
humiliation to have escaped Sir Daniel, convinced Lord Risingham, and
now fall helpless in the hands of this old, drunken sailor; and not
merely helpless, but, as his conscience loudly told him when it was too
late, actually guilty--actually the bankrupt debtor of the man whose
ship he had stolen and lost.
</p><p>"Bring me him back into the alehouse, till I see his face," said
Arblaster.
</p><p>"Nay, nay," returned Tom; "but let us first unload his wallet, lest the
other lads cry share."
</p><p>But though he was searched from head to foot, not a penny was found upon
him; nothing but Lord Foxham's signet, which they plucked savagely from
his finger.
</p><p>"Turn me him to the moon," said the skipper; and taking Dick by the
chin, he cruelly jerked his head into the air. "Blessed Virgin!" he
cried, "it is the pirate!"
</p><p>"Hey!" cried Tom.
</p><p>"By the Virgin of Bordeaux, it is the man himself!" repeated Arblaster.
"What, sea-thief, do I hold you?" he cried. "Where is my ship? Where is
my wine? Hey! have I you in my hands? Tom, give me one end of a cord
here; I will so truss me this sea-thief, hand and foot together, like a
basting turkey--marry, I will so bind him up--and thereafter I will so
beat--so beat him!"
</p><p>And so he ran on, winding the cord meanwhile about Dick's limbs with the
dexterity peculiar to seamen, and at every turn and cross securing it
with a knot, and tightening the whole fabric with a savage pull.
</p><p>When he had done, the lad was a mere package in his hands--as helpless
as the dead. The skipper held him at arm's length, and laughed aloud.
Then he fetched him a stunning buffet on the ear; and then turned him
about, and furiously kicked and kicked him. Anger rose up in Dick's
bosom like a storm; anger strangled him, and he thought to have died;
but when the sailor, tired of this cruel play, dropped him all his
length upon the sand and turned to consult with his companions, he
instantly regained command of his temper. Here was a momentary respite;
ere they began again to torture him, he might have found some method to
escape from this degrading and fatal misadventure.
</p><p>Presently, sure enough, and while his captors were still discussing what
to do with him, he took heart of grace, and, with a pretty steady voice,
addressed them.
</p><p>"My masters," he began, "are ye gone clean foolish? Here hath Heaven put
into your hands as pretty an occasion to grow rich as ever shipman
had--such as ye might make thirty over-sea adventures and not find
again--and, by the mass! what do ye? Beat me?--nay; so would an angry
child! But for long-headed tarry-Johns, that fear not fire nor water,
and that love gold as they love beef, methinks ye are not wise."
</p><p>"Ay," said Tom, "now y'are trussed ye would cozen us."
</p><p>"Cozen you!" repeated Dick. "Nay, if ye be fools, it would be easy. But
if ye be shrewd fellows, as I trow ye are, ye can see plainly where your
interest lies. When I took your ship from you, we were many, we were
well clad and armed; but now, bethink you a little, who mustered that
array? One incontestably that hath much gold. And if he, being already
rich, continueth to hunt after more even in the face of storms--bethink
you once more--shall there not be a treasure somewhere hidden?"
</p><p>"What meaneth he?" asked one of the men.
</p><p>"Why, if ye have lost an old skiff and a few jugs of vinegary wine,"
continued Dick, "forget them, for the trash they are; and do ye rather
buckle to an adventure worth the name, that shall, in twelve hours, make
or mar you for ever. But take me up from where I lie, and let us go
somewhere near at hand and talk across a flagon, for I am sore and
frozen, and my mouth is half among the snow."
</p><p>"He seeks but to cozen us," said Tom, contemptuously.
</p><p>"Cozen! cozen!" cried the third man. "I would I could see the man that
could cozen me! He were a cozener indeed! Nay, I was not born yesterday.
I can see a church when it hath a steeple on it; and for my part, gossip
Arblaster, methinks there is some sense in this young man. Shall we go
hear him, indeed? Say, shall we go hear him?"
</p><p>"I would look gladly on a pottle of strong ale, good Master Pirret,"
returned Arblaster. "How say ye, Tom? But then the wallet is empty."
</p><p>"I will pay," said the other--"I will pay. I would fain see this matter
out; I do believe, upon my conscience, there is gold in it."
</p><p>"Nay, if ye get again to drinking, all is lost!" cried Tom.
</p><p>"Gossip Arblaster, ye suffer your fellow to have too much liberty,"
returned Master Pirret. "Would ye be led by a hired man? Fy, fy!"
</p><p>"Peace, fellow!" said Arblaster, addressing Tom. "Will ye put your oar
in? Truly a fine pass, when the crew is to correct the skipper!"
</p><p>"Well, then, go your way," said Tom; "I wash my hands of you."
</p><p>"Set him, then, upon his feet," said Master Pirret. "I know a privy
place where we may drink and discourse."
</p><p>"If I am to walk, my friends, ye must set my feet at liberty," said
Dick, when he had been once more planted upright like a post.
</p><p>"He saith true," laughed Pirret. "Truly, he could not walk accoutred as
he is. Give it a slit--out with your knife and slit it, gossip."
</p><p>Even Arblaster paused at this proposal; but as his companion continued
to insist, and Dick had the sense to keep the merest wooden indifference
of expression, and only shrugged his shoulders over the delay, the
skipper consented at last, and cut the cords which tied his prisoner's
feet and legs. Not only did this enable Dick to walk; but the whole
network of his bonds being proportionately loosened, he felt the arm
behind his back begin to move more freely, and could hope, with time and
trouble, to entirely disengage it. So much he owed already to the owlish
silliness and greed of Master Pirret.
</p><p>That worthy now assumed the lead, and conducted them to the very same
rude alehouse where Lawless had taken Arblaster on the day of the gale.
It was now quite deserted; the fire was a pile of red embers, radiating
the most ardent heat; and when they had chosen their places, and the
landlord had set before them a measure of mulled ale, both Pirret and
Arblaster stretched forth their legs and squared their elbows like men
bent upon a pleasant hour.
</p><p>The table at which they sat, like all the others in the alehouse,
consisted of a heavy, square board, set on a pair of barrels; and each
of the four curiously-assorted cronies sat at one side of the square,
Pirret facing Arblaster, and Dick opposite to the common sailor.
</p><p>"And now, young man," said Pirret, "to your tale. It doth appear,
indeed, that ye have somewhat abused our gossip Arblaster; but what
then? Make it up to him--show him but this chance to become wealthy--and
I will go pledge he will forgive you."
</p><p>So far Dick had spoken pretty much at random; but it was now necessary,
under the supervision of six eyes, to invent and tell some marvellous
story, and, if it were possible, get back into his hands the
all-important signet. To squander time was the first necessity. The
longer his stay lasted, the more would his captors drink, and the surer
should he be when he attempted his escape.
</p><p>Well, Dick was not much of an inventor, and what he told was pretty much
the tale of Ali Baba, with Shoreby and Tunstall Forest substituted for
the East, and the treasures of the cavern rather exaggerated than
diminished. As the reader is aware, it is an excellent story, and has
but one drawback--that it is not true; and so, as these three simple
shipmen now heard it for the first time, their eyes stood out of their
faces, and their mouths gaped like codfish at a fishmonger's.
</p><p>Pretty soon a second measure of mulled ale was called for; and while
Dick was still artfully spinning out the incidents a third followed the
second.
</p><p>Here was the position of the parties towards the end:
</p><p>Arblaster, three-parts drunk and one-half asleep, hung helpless on his
stool. Even Tom had been much delighted with the tale, and his vigilance
had abated in proportion. Meanwhile, Dick had gradually wormed his right
arm clear of its bonds, and was ready to risk all.
</p><p>"And so," said Pirret, "y'are one of these?"
</p><p>"I was made so," replied Dick, "against my will; but an I could but get
a sack or two of gold coin to my share, I should be a fool indeed to
continue dwelling in a filthy cave, and standing shot and buffet like a
soldier. Here be we four; good! Let us, then, go forth into the forest
to-morrow ere the sun be up. Could we come honestly by a donkey, it were
better; but an we cannot, we have our four strong backs, and I warrant
me we shall come home staggering."
</p><p>Pirret licked his lips.
</p><p>"And this magic," he said--"this password, whereby the cave is
opened--how call ye it, friend?"
</p><p>"Nay, none know the word but the three chiefs," returned Dick; "but here
is your great good fortune, that, on this very evening, I should be the
bearer of a spell to open it. It is a thing not trusted twice a year
beyond the captain's wallet."
</p><p>"A spell!" said Arblaster, half awakening, and squinting upon Dick with
one eye. "Aroint thee! no spells! I be a good Christian. Ask my man Tom,
else."
</p><p>"Nay, but this is white magic," said Dick. "It doth naught with the
devil; only the powers of numbers, herbs, and planets."
</p><p>"Ay, ay," said Pirret; "'tis but white magic, gossip. There is no sin
therein, I do assure you. But proceed, good youth. This spell--in what
should it consist?"
</p><p>"Nay, that I will incontinently show you," answered Dick. "Have ye there
the ring ye took from my finger? Good! Now hold it forth before you by
the extreme finger-ends, at the arm's length, and over against the
shining of these embers. 'Tis so exactly. Thus, then, is the spell."
</p><p>With a haggard glance, Dick saw the coast was clear between him and the
door. He put up an internal prayer. Then whipping forth his arm, he made
but one snatch of the ring, and at the same instant, levering up the
table, he sent it bodily over upon the seaman Tom. He, poor soul, went
down bawling under the ruins; and before Arblaster understood that
anything was wrong, or Pirret could collect his dazzled wits, Dick had
run to the door and escaped into the moonlit night.
</p><p>The moon, which now rode in the mid-heavens, and the extreme whiteness
of the snow, made the open ground about the harbour bright as day; and
young Shelton leaping, with kilted robe, among the lumber, was a
conspicuous figure from afar.
</p><p>Tom and Pirret followed him with shouts; from every drinking-shop they
were joined by others whom their cries aroused; and presently a whole
fleet of sailors was in full pursuit. But Jack ashore was a bad runner,
even in the fifteenth century, and Dick, besides, had a start, which he
rapidly improved, until, as he drew near the entrance of a narrow lane,
he even paused and looked laughingly behind him.
</p><p>Upon the white floor of snow, all the shipmen of Shoreby came clustering
in an inky mass, and tailing out rearward in isolated clumps. Every man
was shouting or screaming; every man was gesticulating with both arms in
air; some one was continually falling; and to complete the picture, when
one fell, a dozen would fall upon the top of him.
</p><p>The confused mass of sound which they rolled up as high as to the moon
was partly comical and partly terrifying to the fugitive whom they were
hunting. In itself, it was impotent, for he made sure no seaman in the
port could run him down. But the mere volume of noise, in so far as it
must awake all the sleepers in Shoreby and bring all the skulking
sentries to the street, did really threaten him with danger in the
front. So, spying a dark doorway at a corner, he whipped briskly into
it, and let the uncouth hunt go by him, still shouting and
gesticulating, and all red with hurry and white with tumbles in the
snow.
</p><p>It was a long while, indeed, before this great invasion of the town by
the harbour came to an end, and it was long before silence was restored.
For long, lost sailors were still to be heard pounding and shouting
through the streets in all directions and in every quarter of the town.
Quarrels followed, sometimes among themselves, sometimes with the men
of the patrols; knives were drawn, blows given and received, and more
than one dead body remained behind upon the snow.
</p><p>When, a full hour later, the last seaman returned grumblingly to the
harbour side and his particular tavern, it may fairly be questioned if
he had ever known what manner of man he was pursuing, but it was
absolutely sure that he had now forgotten. By next morning there were
many strange stories flying; and a little while after, the legend of the
devil's nocturnal visit was an article of faith with all the lads of
Shoreby.
</p><p>But the return of the last seaman did not, even yet, set free young
Shelton from his cold imprisonment in the doorway.
</p><p>For some time after, there was a great activity of patrols; and special
parties came forth to make the round of the place and report to one or
other of the great lords, whose slumbers had been thus unusually broken.
</p><p>The night was already well spent before Dick ventured from his
hiding-place and came, safe and sound, but aching with cold and bruises,
to the door of the Goat and Bagpipes. As the law required, there was
neither fire nor candle in the house; but he groped his way into a
corner of the icy guest-room, found an end of a blanket, which he
hitched around his shoulders, and creeping close to the nearest sleeper,
was soon lost in slumber.
