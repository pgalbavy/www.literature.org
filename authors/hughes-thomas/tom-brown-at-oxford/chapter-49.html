<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>My Dear Katie; &mdash;I know you will be very much pained when
you read this letter. You two have been my only confidantes, and
you have always kept me up, and encouraged me to hope that all
would come right. And after all that happened last week, Patty's
marriage, and your engagement,&mdash;the two things upon earth, with
one exception, that I most wished for, &mdash;I quite felt that
my own turn was coming. I can't tell why I had such a strong feeling
about it, but somehow all the most important changes in my life
for the last four years have been so interwoven with Patty and
Harry Winburn's history, that, now they were married, I was sure
something would happen to me as soon as I came to London. And
I was not wrong. Dear Katie, I can hardly bring myself to write
it. It is all over. I met her in the street to-day; she was riding
with her father and the man I told you about. They had to pull
up not to ride over me; so I had a good look at her, and there
can be no mistake about it. I have often tried to reason myself
into the belief that the evil day must come sooner or later, and
to prepare myself for it; but I might have spared myself, for
it could not have been worse than it is if I had never anticipated
it. My future is all a blank now. I can't stay in England; so
I have written home to ask them to let me go to New Zealand with
East, and I am sure they will consent, when they know all.</p>

<p>"I shall wait in town till I get the answer. Perhaps I may be
able to get off with East in a few weeks. The sooner the better;
but, of course, I shall not go without seeing you and dear old
Jack. You mustn't mind me calling him Jack. The only thing that
it gives me any pleasure to think about is your engagement. It
is so right; and one wants to see something going right, some
one getting their due, to keep alive one's belief in justice being
done somehow or another in the world. And I do see it, and acknowledge
it, when I think over his history and mine since we first met.
We have both got our due; and you have got yours, Katie, for you
have got the best fellow in England.</p>

<p>"Ah! if I only could think that she has got hers! If I could
only believe that the man she has chosen is worthy of her! I will
try hard to think better of him. There must be more good in him
that I have ever seen, or she would never have engaged herself
to him. But I can't bear to stop here, and see it all going on.
The sooner I am out of England the better. I send you a parcel
with this; it contains her notes, and some old flowers and other
matters which I haven't the heart to burn. You will be the best
judge what should be done with them. If you see your way to managing
it, I should like her to know that I had sent them all to you,
and that, whatever may happen to me hereafter, my love for her
has been the mainstay and the guiding-star of my life ever since
that happy time when you all came to stay with us in my first
long vacation. It found me eaten up with selfishness and conceit,
the puppet of my own lusts and vanities, and has left me&mdash;well
never mind what it has left me. At any rate, if I have not gone
from worse to worse, it is all owing to her; and she ought to
know it. It cannot be wrong to let her know what good she has
scattered unknowingly about her path. May God bless and reward
her for it, and you, too, dear cousin, for all your long love
and kindness to one who is very unworthy of, but very thankful
for them.</p>

<p>"Ever yours, affectionately,</p>

<p>"T. B."</p>

<p>The above letter, and that to his father, asking for leave to
emigrate, having been written and sent off, Tom was left, on the
afternoon of the day following his upset, making manful, if not
very successful, efforts to shake off the load of depression which
weighed on him, and to turn his thoughts resolutely forward to
a new life in a new country. East was away at the Docks. There
was no one moving in the Temple. The men who had business were
all at Westminster, or out of sight and hearing in the recesses
of their chambers. Those who had none were for the most part away
enjoying themselves, in one way or another amongst the mighty
whirl of the mighty human sea of London. There was nothing left
for him to do; he had written the only two letters he had to write,
and had only to sit still and wait for the answers, killing the
meantime as well as he could. Reading came hard to him, but it
was the best thing to do, perhaps; at any rate he was trying it
on, though his studies were constantly interrupted by long fits
of absence of mind, during which, though his body remained in
the temple, he was again in the well-kept garden of Barton, or
in the hazel wood under the lee of the Berkshire hills.</p>

<p>He was roused out of one of these reveries, and brought back
to external life and Fig-tree Court, by a single knock at the
outer door, and a shout of the newsman's boy for the paper. So
he got up, found the paper, which he had forgotten to read, and,
as he went to the door, cast his eye on it, and saw that a great
match was going on at Lord's. This gave a new turn to his thoughts.
He stood looking down stairs after the boy, considering whether
he should not start at once for the match.</p>

<p>He would be sure to see a lot of acquaintances there at any rate.
But the idea of seeing and having to talk to mere acquaintances
was more distasteful than his present solitude. He was turning
to bury himself again in his hole, when he saw a white dog walk
quietly up seven or eight stairs at the bottom of the flight,
and then turn round, and look for some one to follow.</p>

<p>"How odd!" thought Tom, as he watched him; "as like as two peas.
It can't be. No. Why, yes it is." And then he whistled, and called
"Jack," and the dog looked up, and wagged his tail, as much as
to say, "All right, I'm coming directly; but I must wait for my
master." The next moment Drysdale appeared at the bottom of the
stairs, and looking up, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh! that's you, is it? I'm all right then. So you knew the old
dog?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think so," said Tom. "I hope I never forget
a dog or horse I have once known."</p>

<p>In the short minute which Drysdale and Jack took to arrive at
his landing, Tom had time for a rush of old college memories,
in which the grave and gay, pleasant and bitter, were strangely
mingled. The light when he had been first brought to his senses
about Patty came up very vividly before him, and the commemoration
days, when he had last seen Drysdale. "How strange!" he thought,
"is my old life coming back again just now? Here, on the very
day after it is all over, comes back the man with whom I was so
intimate up to the day it began, and have never seen since. What
does it mean?"</p>

<p>There was a little touch of embarrassment in the manner of both
of them as they shook hands at the top of the stairs, and turned
into the chambers. Tom motioned to Jack to take his old place
at one end of the sofa, and began caressing him there, the dog
showing unmistakably, by gesture and whine, that delight at renewing
an old friendship for which his race are so nobly distinguished.
Drysdale threw himself down in an arm-chair and watched them.</p>

<p>"So you knew the old dog, Brown?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Knew him?&mdash;of course I did. Dear old Jack! How well he wears;
he is scarcely altered at all."</p>

<p>"Very little; only steadier. More than I can say for his master.
I'm very glad you knew Jack."</p>

<p>"Come, Drysdale; take the other end of the sofa or it won't look
like old times. There, now I can fancy myself back at St. Ambrose's."</p>

<p>"By Jove, Brown, you're a real good fellow; I always said so,
even after that last letter. You pitched it rather strong in that
though. I was very near coming back from Norway to quarrel with
you."</p>

<p>"Well, I was very angry at being left in the lurch by you and
Blake."</p>

<p>"You got the coin all right, I suppose? You never acknowledged
it."</p>

<p>"Didn't I? Then I ought to have. Yes, I got it all right about
six months afterwards. I ought to have acknowledged it, and I
thought I had. I'm sorry I didn't. Now we're all quits, and won't
talk any more about that rascally bill."</p>

<p>"I suppose I may light up," said Drysdale, dropping into his
old lounging attitude on the sofa, and pulling out his cigar-case.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Will you have anything?"</p>

<p>"A cool drink wouldn't be amiss."</p>

<p>"They make a nice tankard with cider and a lump of ice at the
'Rainbow'. What do you say to that?"</p>

<p>"It sounds touching," said Drysdale. So Tom posted off to Fleet
Street to order the liquor, and came back followed by a waiter
with the tankard. Drysdale took a long pull and smacked his lips.</p>

<p>"That's a wrinkle," he said, handing the tankard to Tom. "I suppose
the lawyers teach all the publicans about here a trick or two.
Why, one can fancy one's self back in the old quad, looking out
on this court. If it weren't such an outlandish out-of-the-way
place, I think I should take some chambers here myself. How did
you get here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, they belong to a friend of mine who is away. But how did
<em>you</em> get here?"</p>

<p>"Why, along the Strand, in a Hansom."</p>

<p>"I mean, how did you know I was here?"</p>

<p>"Grey told me."</p>

<p>"What! Grey, who was at St. Ambrose's with us?"</p>

<p>"Yes. You look puzzled."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you knew Grey."</p>

<p>"No more I do. But a stout old party I met last night&mdash;your godfather,
I should think he is&mdash;told me where he was, and said I should
get your address from him. So I looked him up this morning, in
that dog-hole in Westminster where he lives. He didn't know Jack
from Adam."</p>

<p>"But what in the world do you mean by my godfather?"</p>

<p>"I had better tell my story from the beginning, I see. Last night
I did what I don't often do, went out to a great drum. There was
an awful crush, of course, and you may guess what the heat was
in these dog-days, with gas-lights and wax-lights going, and a
jam of people in every corner. I was fool enough to get into the
rooms, so that my retreat was cut off; and I had to work right
through, and got at last into a back room, which was not so full.
The window was in a recess, and there was a balcony outside, looking
over a little bit of garden. I got into the balcony, talking with
a girl who was sensible enough to like the cool. Presently I heard
a voice I thought I knew inside. Then I heard St. Ambrose, and
then your name. Of course I listened; I couldn't help myself.
They were just inside the window, in the recess, not five feet
from us; so I heard pretty nearly ever word. Give us the tankard;
I'm as dry as an ash-heap with talking."</p>

<p>Tom, scarcely able to control his impatience, handed the tankard.
"But who was it?&mdash;you haven't told me," he said, as Drysdale put
it down at last empty.</p>

<p>"Why, that d&mdash;d St. Cloud. He was giving you a nice character,
in a sort of sneaking deprecatory way, as if he was sorry for
it. Amongst other little tales, he said you used to borrow money
from Jews&mdash;he knew it for a certainty because he had been asked
himself to join you and another man&mdash;meaning me, of course&mdash;in
such a transaction. You remember how he wouldn't acknowledge the
money I lent him at play, and the note he wrote me which upset
Blake so. I had never forgotten it. I knew I should get my chance
some day, and here it was. I don't know what the girl thought
of me, or how she got out of the balcony, but I stepped into the
recess just as he had finished his precious story, and landed
between him and a comfortable old boy, who was looking shocked.
He <em>must</em> be your godfather, or something of the kind.
I'll bet you a pony you are down for something handsome in his
will."</p>

<p>"What was his name? Did you find out?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Potter, or Porter, or something like it. I've got his card
somewhere. I just stared St. Cloud in the face, and you may depend
upon it he winched. Then I told the old boy that I had heard their
talk, and, as I was at St. Ambrose with you, I should like to
have five minutes with him when St. Cloud had done. He seemed
rather in a corner between us. However, I kept in sight till St.
Cloud was obliged to draw off; and, to cut my story short, as
the tankard is empty, I think I put you pretty straight there.
You said we were quits just now; after last night, perhaps we
are, for I told him the truth of the Benjamin story, and I think
he is squared. He seems a good sort of old boy. He's a relation
of yours, eh?"</p>

<p>"Only a distant connexion. Did anything more happen?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw that he was flurried and didn't know quite what to
think; so I asked him to let me call, and I would bring him some
one else to speak to your character. He gave me his card, and
I'm going to take Blake there today. Then I asked him where you
were, and he didn't know, but said he thought Grey could tell
me."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you, Drysdale to take so much trouble."</p>

<p>"Trouble! I'd go from here to Jericho to be even with our fine
friend. I never forget a bad turn. I met him afterwards in the
cloak-room, and went out of the door close after him, to give
him a chance if he wants to say anything. I only wish he would.
But why do you suppose he is lying about you?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell. I've never spoken to him since he left Oxford.
Never saw him till yesterday, riding with Mr. Porter. I suppose
that reminded them of me."</p>

<p>"Well, St. Cloud is bent on getting round him for some reason
or another, you may take your oath of that. Now my time's up;
I shall go and pick up Blake. I should think I had better not
take Jack to call in Eaton Square, though he'd give you a good
character if he could speak; wouldn't you Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack wagged his tail, and descended from the sofa.</p>

<p>"Does Blake live up here? What is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Burning the candle at both ends, and in the middle, as usual.
Yes, he's living near his club. He writes political articles,
devilish well I hear, too, and is reading for the bar; beside
which he is getting into society, and going out whenever he can,
and fretting his soul out that he isn't prime minister, or something
of the kind. He won't last long at the pace he's going."</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry to hear it. But you'll come here again, Drysdale;
or let me come and see you? I shall be very anxious to hear what
has happened."</p>

<p>"Here's my pasteboard; I shall be in town for another fortnight.
Drop in when you like."</p>

<p>And so Drysdale and Jack went off, leaving Tom in a chaotic state
of mind. All his old hopes were roused again as he thought over
Drysdale's narrative. He could no longer sit still; so he rushed
out, and walked up and down the river-side walk, in the Temple
gardens, where a fine breeze blowing, at a pace which astonished
the gate-keepers and the nursery-maids and children, who were
taking the air in that favorite spot. Once or twice he returned
to chambers, and at last found East reposing after his excursion
to the Docks.</p>

<p>East's quick eye saw at once that something had happened; and
he had very soon heard the whole story; upon which he deliberated
for some minutes, and rejoiced Tom's heart by saying: "Ah! all
up with New Zealand, I see. I shall be introduced after all before
we start. Come along; I must stand you a dinner on the strength
of the good news, and we'll drink her health."</p>

<p>Tom called twice that evening at Drysdale's lodgings, but he
was out. The next morning he called again. Drysdale had gone to
Hampton Court races, and had left no message. He left a note for
him, but got no answer. It was trying work. Another day passed
without any word from Drysdale, who seemed never to be at home;
and no answer to either of his letters. On the third morning he
heard from his father. It was just the answer which he had expected&mdash;as
kind a letter as could be written. Mr. Brown had suspected how
matters stood at one time, but had given up the idea in consequence
of Tom's silence; which he regretted, as possibly things might
have happened otherwise, had he known the state of the case. It
was too late now, however; and the less said the better about
what might have been. As to New Zealand, he should not oppose
Tom's going, if, after some time, he continued in his present
mind. It was very natural for him just now to wish to go. They
would talk it over as soon as Tom came home, which Mr. Brown begged
him to do at once, or, at any rate, as soon as he had seen his
friend off. Home was the best place for him.</p>

<p>Tom sighed as he folded it up; the hopes of the last three days
seemed to be fading away again. He spent another restless day;
and by night had persuaded himself that Drysdale's mission had
been a complete failure, and that he did not write and kept out
of the way out of kindness for him.</p>

<p>"Why, Tom, old fellow, you look as down in the mouth as ever
to-night," East said, when Tom opened the door for him about midnight,
on his return from his club; "cheer up; you may depend it's all
to go right."</p>

<p> "But I haven't seen Drysdale again, and he hasn't written to
me."</p>

<p>"There's nothing in that. He was glad enough to do you a good
turn, I dare say, when it came in his way, but that sort of fellow
never can keep anything up. He has been too much used to having
his own way, and following his own fancies. Don't you lose heart
because he won't put himself out for you."</p>

<p>"Well, Harry, you are the best fellow, in the world. You would
put a backbone into anyone."</p>

<p>"Now, we'll just have a quiet cheroot, and then turn in; and
see if you don't have good news to-morrow. How hot it is! The
Strand to-night is as hot as the Punjaub, and the reek of it&mdash;phah!
my throat is full of it still."</p>

<p>East took off his coat, and was just throwing it on a chair,
when he stopped, and, feeling in his pocket, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let's see, here's a note for you. The porter gave it to me as
I knocked in."</p>

<p>Tom took it carelessly, but the next moment was tearing it open
with trembling fingers. "From my cousin," he said. East watched
him read, and saw the blood rush to his face, and the light come
into his eyes.</p>

<p>"Good news, Tom, I see. Bravo, old boy. You've had a long fight
for it, and deserve to win."</p>

<p>Tom got up, tossed the note across the table, and began walking
up and down the room; his heart was too full for speech.</p>

<p>"May I read?" said East, looking up. Tom nodded, and he read&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>DEAR TOM, &</em>mdash;I am coming to town to spend a week
with them in Eaton Square. Call on me to-morrow at twelve, or,
if you are engaged then, between three and five. I have no time
to add more now, but long to see you.</p>

<p>Your loving cousin,</p>

<p><em>KATIE</em></p>

<p>"<em>P.S. &</em>mdash;I will give you your parcel back to-morrow,
and then you can <em>burn</em> the contents yourself, or do what
you like with them. Uncle bids me say he shall be glad if you
will come and dine to-morrow, and any other day you can spare
while I am here."</p>

<p>When he had read the note, East got up and shook hands heartily
with Tom, and then sat down again quietly to finish his cheroot,
watching with a humorous look his friend's march.</p>

<p>"And you think it is really all right now?" Tom asked, in one
form or another, after every few turns; and East replied in various
forms of chaffing assurance that there could not be much further
question on the point. At last, when he had finished his cheroot,
he got up, and, taking his candle, said, "Good night, Tom; when
that revolution comes, which you're always predicting, remember,
if you're not shot or hung, you'll always find a roost for you
and your wife in New Zealand."</p>

<p>"I don't feel so sure about the revolution now, Harry."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't. Mind, I bargain for the dinner in Eaton
Square. I always told you I should dine there before I started."</p>

<p>The next day Tom found that he was not engaged at twelve o'clock,
and was able to appear in Eaton Square. He was shown up into the
drawing-room, and found Katie alone there. The quiet and coolness
of the darkened room was most grateful to him after the glare
of the streets, as he sat down by her side.</p>

<p>"But Katie," he said, as soon as the first salutations and congratulations
had passed, "how did it all happen? I can't believe my senses
yet. I am afraid I may wake up any minute."</p>

<p>"Well, it was chiefly owing to two lucky coincidences; though
no doubt it would have all come right in time without them."</p>

<p>"Our meeting the other day in the street, I suppose, was one
of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Coming across you so suddenly, carrying the little girl,
reminded Mary of the day when she sprained her ankle, and you
carried her through Hazel Copse. Ah, you never told me <em>all</em>
of that adventure, either of you."</p>

<p>"All that was necessary, Katie."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have pardoned you. Uncle saw then that she was very much
moved at something, and guessed well enough what it was. He is
so very kind, and so fond of Mary, he would do anything in the
world that she wished. She was quite unwell that evening; so he
and aunt had to go out alone; and they met Mr. St. Cloud at a
party, who was said to be engaged to her."</p>

<p>"It wasn't true, then?"</p>

<p>"No, never. He is a very designing man, though I believe he was
really in love with poor Mary. At any rate he has persecuted her
for more than a year. And, it is very wicked, but I am afraid
he spread all those reports himself."</p>

<p>"Of their engagement? Just like him!"</p>

<p>"Uncle is so good-natured, you know; and he took advantage of
it, and was always coming here, and riding with them. And he made
Uncle believe dreadful stories about you, which made him seem
so unkind. He was quite afraid to have you at the house."</p>

<p>"Yes, I saw that last year; and the second coincidence?"</p>

<p>"It happened that very night. Poor uncle was very much troubled
what to do; so, when he met Mr. St. Cloud, as I told you, he took
him aside to ask him again about you. Somehow, a gentleman who
was a friend of yours at Oxford overheard what was said, and came
forward and explained everything."</p>

<p>"Yes, he came and told me."</p>

<p>"Then you know more than I about it."</p>

<p>"And you think Mr. Porter is convinced that I am not quite such
a scamp after all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and the boys are so delighted that they will see
you again. They are at home for the holidays, and so grown."</p>

<p>"And Mary?"</p>

<p>"She is very well. You will see her before long, I dare say."</p>

<p>"Is she at home?"</p>

<p>"She is out riding with uncle. Now I will go up and get your
parcel, which I had opened at home before I got aunt's note asking
me here. No wonder we could never find her boot."</p>

<p>Katie disappeared and at the same time Tom thought he heard the
sound of horses' feet. Yes, and they had stopped, too. It must
be Mary and her father. He could not see because of the blinds
and other devices for keeping the room cool. But the next moment
there were voices in the hall below, and then a light step on
the carpeted stair, which no ear but his could have heard. His
heart beat with heavy painful pulsations, and his head swam as
the door opened, and Mary in her riding-habit stood in the room.</p>
