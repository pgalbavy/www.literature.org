"The Bishop is out of hand," Ernest wrote me.  "He is clear up in
the air.  Tonight he is going to begin putting to rights this very
miserable world of ours.  He is going to deliver his message.  He
has told me so, and I cannot dissuade him.  To-night he is chairman
of the I.P.H.,* and he will embody his message in his
introductory remarks.
<P>
<P>
* There is no clew to the name of the organization for which these
initials stand.
<P>
<P>
"May I bring you to hear him?  Of course, he is foredoomed to
futility.  It will break your heart--it will break his; but for you
it will be an excellent object lesson.  You know, dear heart, how
proud I am because you love me.  And because of that I want you to
know my fullest value, I want to redeem, in your eyes, some small
measure of my unworthiness.  And so it is that my pride desires
that you shall know my thinking is correct and right.  My views are
harsh; the futility of so noble a soul as the Bishop will show you
the compulsion for such harshness.  So come to-night.  Sad though
this night's happening will be, I feel that it will but draw you
more closely to me."
<P>
The I.P.H. held its convention that night in San Francisco.*
This convention had been called to consider public immorality and
the remedy for it.  Bishop Morehouse presided.  He was very nervous
as he sat on the platform, and I could see the high tension he was
under.  By his side were Bishop Dickinson; H. H. Jones, the head of
the ethical department in the University of California; Mrs. W. W.
Hurd, the great charity organizer; Philip Ward, the equally great
philanthropist; and several lesser luminaries in the field of
morality and charity.  Bishop Morehouse arose and abruptly began:
<P>
<P>
* It took but a few minutes to cross by ferry from Berkeley to San
Francisco.  These, and the other bay cities, practically composed
one community.
<P>
<P>
"I was in my brougham, driving through the streets.  It was night-
time.  Now and then I looked through the carriage windows, and
suddenly my eyes seemed to be opened, and I saw things as they
really are.  At first I covered my eyes with my hands to shut out
the awful sight, and then, in the darkness, the question came to
me: What is to be done?  What is to be done?  A little later the
question came to me in another way: What would the Master do?  And
with the question a great light seemed to fill the place, and I saw
my duty sun-clear, as Saul saw his on the way to Damascus.
<P>
"I stopped the carriage, got out, and, after a few minutes'
conversation, persuaded two of the public women to get into the
brougham with me.  If Jesus was right, then these two unfortunates
were my sisters, and the only hope of their purification was in my
affection and tenderness.
<P>
"I live in one of the loveliest localities of San Francisco.  The
house in which I live cost a hundred thousand dollars, and its
furnishings, books, and works of art cost as much more.  The house
is a mansion.  No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
I never knew what palaces were good for.  I had thought they were
to live in.  But now I know.  I took the two women of the street to
my palace, and they are going to stay with me.  I hope to fill
every room in my palace with such sisters as they."
<P>
The audience had been growing more and more restless and unsettled,
and the faces of those that sat on the platform had been betraying
greater and greater dismay and consternation.  And at this point
Bishop Dickinson arose, and with an expression of disgust on his
face, fled from the platform and the hall.  But Bishop Morehouse,
oblivious to all, his eyes filled with his vision, continued:
<P>
"Oh, sisters and brothers, in this act of mine I find the solution
of all my difficulties.  I didn't know what broughams were made
for, but now I know.  They are made to carry the weak, the sick,
and the aged; they are made to show honor to those who have lost
the sense even of shame.
<P>
"I did not know what palaces were made for, but now I have found a
use for them.  The palaces of the Church should be hospitals and
nurseries for those who have fallen by the wayside and are
perishing."
<P>
He made a long pause, plainly overcome by the thought that was in
him, and nervous how best to express it.
<P>
"I am not fit, dear brethren, to tell you anything about morality.
I have lived in shame and hypocrisies too long to be able to help
others; but my action with those women, sisters of mine, shows me
that the better way is easy to find.  To those who believe in Jesus
and his gospel there can be no other relation between man and man
than the relation of affection.  Love alone is stronger than sin--
stronger than death.  I therefore say to the rich among you that it
is their duty to do what I have done and am doing.  Let each one of
you who is prosperous take into his house some thief and treat him
as his brother, some unfortunate and treat her as his sister, and
San Francisco will need no police force and no magistrates; the
prisons will be turned into hospitals, and the criminal will
disappear with his crime.
<P>
"We must give ourselves and not our money alone.  We must do as
Christ did; that is the message of the Church today.  We have
wandered far from the Master's teaching.  We are consumed in our
own flesh-pots.  We have put mammon in the place of Christ.  I have
here a poem that tells the whole story.  I should like to read it
to you.  It was written by an erring soul who yet saw clearly.*  It
must not be mistaken for an attack upon the Catholic Church.  It is
an attack upon all churches, upon the pomp and splendor of all
churches that have wandered from the Master's path and hedged
themselves in from his lambs.  Here it is:
<P>
<P>
     "The silver trumpets rang across the Dome;
        The people knelt upon the ground with awe;
        And borne upon the necks of men I saw,
      Like some great God, the Holy Lord of Rome.
<P>
     "Priest-like, he wore a robe more white than foam,
        And, king-like, swathed himself in royal red,
        Three crowns of gold rose high upon his head;
      In splendor and in light the Pope passed home.
<P>
     "My heart stole back across wide wastes of years
        To One who wandered by a lonely sea;
      And sought in vain for any place of rest:
     'Foxes have holes, and every bird its nest,
        I, only I, must wander wearily,
      And bruise my feet, and drink wine salt with tears.'"
<P>
<P>

century of the Christian Era.
<P>
<P>
The audience was agitated, but unresponsive.  Yet Bishop Morehouse
was not aware of it.  He held steadily on his way.
<P>
"And so I say to the rich among you, and to all the rich, that
bitterly you oppress the Masterï¿½s lambs.  You have hardened your
hearts.  You have closed your ears to the voices that are crying in
the land--the voices of pain and sorrow that you will not hear but
that some day will be heard.  And so I say--"
<P>
But at this point H. H. Jones and Philip Ward, who had already
risen from their chairs, led the Bishop off the platform, while the
audience sat breathless and shocked.
<P>
Ernest laughed harshly and savagely when he had gained the street.
His laughter jarred upon me.  My heart seemed ready to burst with
suppressed tears.
<P>
"He has delivered his message," Ernest cried.  "The manhood and the
deep-hidden, tender nature of their Bishop burst out, and his
Christian audience, that loved him, concluded that he was crazy!
Did you see them leading him so solicitously from the platform?
There must have been laughter in hell at the spectacle."
<P>
"Nevertheless, it will make a great impression, what the Bishop did
and said to-night," I said.
<P>
"Think so?" Ernest queried mockingly.
<P>
"It will make a sensation," I asserted.  "Didn't you see the
reporters scribbling like mad while he was speaking?"
<P>
"Not a line of which will appear in to-morrow's papers."
<P>
"I can't believe it," I cried.
<P>
"Just wait and see," was the answer.  "Not a line, not a thought
that he uttered.  The daily press?  The daily suppressage!"
<P>
"But the reporters," I objected.  "I saw them."
<P>
"Not a word that he uttered will see print.  You have forgotten the
editors.  They draw their salaries for the policy they maintain.
Their policy is to print nothing that is a vital menace to the
established.  The Bishop's utterance was a violent assault upon the
established morality.  It was heresy.  They led him from the
platform to prevent him from uttering more heresy.  The newspapers
will purge his heresy in the oblivion of silence.  The press of the
United States?  It is a parasitic growth that battens on the
capitalist class.  Its function is to serve the established by
moulding public opinion, and right well it serves it.
<P>
"Let me prophesy.  To-morrow's papers will merely mention that the
Bishop is in poor health, that he has been working too hard, and
that he broke down last night.  The next mention, some days hence,
will be to the effect that he is suffering from nervous prostration
and has been given a vacation by his grateful flock.  After that,
one of two things will happen: either the Bishop will see the error
of his way and return from his vacation a well man in whose eyes
there are no more visions, or else he will persist in his madness,
and then you may expect to see in the papers, couched pathetically
and tenderly, the announcement of his insanity.  After that he will
be left to gibber his visions to padded walls."
<P>
"Now there you go too far!" I cried out.
<P>
"In the eyes of society it will truly be insanity," he replied.
"What honest man, who is not insane, would take lost women and
thieves into his house to dwell with him sisterly and brotherly?
True, Christ died between two thieves, but that is another story.
Insanity?  The mental processes of the man with whom one disagrees,
are always wrong.  Therefore the mind of the man is wrong.  Where
is the line between wrong mind and insane mind?  It is
inconceivable that any sane man can radically disagree with one's
most sane conclusions.
<P>
"There is a good example of it in this evening's paper.  Mary
McKenna lives south of Market Street.  She is a poor but honest
woman.  She is also patriotic.  But she has erroneous ideas
concerning the American flag and the protection it is supposed to
symbolize.  And here's what happened to her.  Her husband had an
accident and was laid up in hospital three months.  In spite of
taking in washing, she got behind in her rent.  Yesterday they
evicted her.  But first, she hoisted an American flag, and from
under its folds she announced that by virtue of its protection they
could not turn her out on to the cold street.  What was done?  She
was arrested and arraigned for insanity.  To-day she was examined
by the regular insanity experts.  She was found insane.  She was
consigned to the Napa Asylum."
<P>
"But that is far-fetched," I objected.  "Suppose I should disagree
with everybody about the literary style of a book.  They wouldn't
send me to an asylum for that."
<P>
"Very true," he replied.  "But such divergence of opinion would
constitute no menace to society.  Therein lies the difference.  The
divergence of opinion on the parts of Mary McKenna and the Bishop
do menace society.  What if all the poor people should refuse to
pay rent and shelter themselves under the American flag?
Landlordism would go crumbling.  The Bishop's views are just as
perilous to society.  Ergo, to the asylum with him."
<P>
But still I refused to believe.
<P>
"Wait and see," Ernest said, and I waited.
<P>
Next morning I sent out for all the papers.  So far Ernest was
right.  Not a word that Bishop Morehouse had uttered was in print.
Mention was made in one or two of the papers that he had been
overcome by his feelings.  Yet the platitudes of the speakers that
followed him were reported at length.
<P>
Several days later the brief announcement was made that he had gone
away on a vacation to recover from the effects of overwork.  So far
so good, but there had been no hint of insanity, nor even of
nervous collapse.  Little did I dream the terrible road the Bishop
was destined to travel--the Gethsemane and crucifixion that Ernest
had pondered about.
