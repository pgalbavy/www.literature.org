<p>Before me stretched a black heath, over which the mist blew in
gusts, and through whose midst the road crept like an adder. Great
storm-marked hills flanked me on either side, and since I set
out I had seen their harsh outline against a thick sky, until
I longed for flat ground to rest my sight upon. The way was damp,
and the soft mountain gravel sank under my horse's feet; and ever
and anon my legs were splashed by the water from some pool which
the rain had left. Shrill mountain birds flew around, and sent
their cries through the cold air. Sometimes the fog would lift
for a moment from the face of the land and show me a hilltop or
the leaden glimmer of a loch, but nothing more&mdash;no green field
or homestead; only a barren and accursed desert.</p>

<p>Neither horse nor man was in any spirit. My back ached, and I
shivered in my sodden garments, while my eyes were dim from gazing
on flying clouds. The poor beast stumbled often, for he had traveled
far on little fodder, and a hill-road was a new thing in his experience.
Saladin I called him&mdash;for I had fancied that there was something
Turkish about his black face, with the heavy turban-like band
above his forehead&mdash;in my old fortunate days when I bought him.
He was a fine horse of the Normandy breed, and had carried me
on many a wild journey, though on none so forlorn as this.</p>

<p>But to speak of myself. I am Jean de Rohaine, at your service;
Sieur de Rohaine in the province of Touraine&mdash;a gentleman, I trust,
though one in a sorry plight. And how I came to be in the wild
highlands of the place called Galloway, in the bare kingdom of
Scotland, I must haste to tell. In the old days, when I had lived
as became my rank in my native land, I had met a Scot,&mdash;one Kennedy
by name,&mdash;a great man in his own country, with whom I struck up
an intimate friendship. He and I were as brothers, and he swore
that if I came to visit him in his own home he would see to it
that I should have the best. I thanked him at the time for his
bidding, but thought little more of it.</p>

<p>Now, by ill fortune, the time came when, what with gaming and
pleasuring, I was a beggared man, and I bethought me of the Scot's
offer. I had liked the man well, and I considered how it would
be no ill thing to abide in that country till I should find some
means of bettering my affairs. So I took ship and came to the
town of Ayr, from which 'twas but a day's ride to the house of
my friend. 'Twas in midsummer when I landed, and the place looked
not so bare as I had feared, as I rode along between green meadows
to my destination. There I found Quentin Kennedy, somewhat grown
old and more full in flesh than I remembered him in the past.
He had been a tall, black-avised man when I first knew him; now
he was grizzled,&mdash;whether from hard living or the harshness of
northern weather I know not,&mdash;and heavier than a man of action
is wont to be. He greeted me most hospitably, putting his house
at my bidding, and swearing that I should abide and keep him company
and go no more back to the South.</p>

<p>So for near a month I stayed there, and such a time of riot and
hilarity I scarce remember. <em>Mon Dieu</em>, but the feasting
and the sporting would have rejoiced the hearts of my comrades
of the Rue Margot! I had already learned much of the Scots tongue
at the college in Paris, where every second man hails from this
land, and now I was soon perfect in it, speaking it all but as
well as my host. 'Tis a gift I have, for I well remember how,
when I consorted for some months in the low countries with an
Italian of Milan, I picked up a fair knowledge of his speech.
So now I found myself in the midst of men of spirit, and a rare
life we led. The gentlemen of the place would come much about
the house, and I promise you 'twas not seldom we saw the morning
in as we sat at wine. There was, too, the greatest sport at coursing
and hunting the deer in Kennedy's lands by the Water of Doon.</p>

<p>Yet there was that I liked not among the fellows who came thither,
nay, even in my friend himself. We have a proverb in France that
the devil when he spoils a German in the making turns him into
a Scot, and for certain there was much boorishness among them,
which to my mind sits ill on gentlemen. They would jest at one
another till I thought that in a twinkling swords would be out,
and lo! I soon found that 'twas but done for sport, and with no
evil intent. They were clownish in their understanding, little
recking of the feelings of a man of honor, but quick to grow fierce
on some tittle of provocation which another would scarce notice.
Indeed, 'tis my belief that one of this nation is best in his
youth, for Kennedy, whom I well remembered as a man of courage
and breeding, had grown grosser and more sottish with his years,
till I was fain to ask where was my friend of the past.</p>

<p>And now I come to that which brought on my departure and my misfortunes.
'Twas one night as I returned weary from riding after a stag in
the haugh by the river, that Quentin cried hastily, as I entered,
that now he had found something worthy of my attention.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, Jock," says he, "you will see sport. There has been
some cursed commotion among the folk of the hills, and I am out
the morrow to redd the marches. You shall have a troop of horse
and ride with me, and, God's death, we will have a taste of better
work!"</p>

<p>I cried out that I could have asked for naught better, and, indeed,
I was overjoyed that the hard drinking and idleness were at an
end, and that the rigors of warfare lay before me. For I am a
soldier by birth and by profession, and I love the jingle of steel
and the rush of battle.</p>

<p>So, on the morrow, I rode to the mountains with a score of dragoons
behind me, glad and hopeful. <em>Diable!</em> How shall I tell
my disappointment? The first day I had seen all&mdash;and more than
I wished. We fought, not with men like ourselves, but with women
and children and unarmed yokels, and butchered like Cossacks more
than Christians. I grew sick of the work, and would have none
of it, but led my men to the rendezvous sullenly, and hot at heart.
'Twas well the night was late when we arrived, else I should have
met with Kennedy there and then, and God knows what might have
happened.</p>

<p>The next day, in a great fit of loathing, I followed my host
again, hoping that the worst was over, and that henceforth I should
have something more to my stomach. But little I knew of the men
with whom I journeyed. There was a cottage there, a shepherd's
house, and God! they burned it down, and the man they shot before
his wife and children, speaking naught to him but foul-mouthed
reproaches and jabber about some creed which was strange to me.
I could not prevent it, though 'twas all that I could do to keep
myself from a mad attack.</p>

<p>I rode up to Quentin Kennedy.</p>

<p>"Sir," I said, "I have had great kindness at your hands, but
you and I must part. I see that we are made of different stuff.
I can endure war, but not massacre."</p>

<p>He laughed at my scruples, incredulous of my purpose, until at
last he saw that I was fixed in my determination. Then he spoke
half kindly:</p>

<p>"This is a small matter to stand between me and thee. I am a
servant of the king, and but do my duty. I little thought to have
disloyalty preached from your lips; but bide with me, and I promise
that you shall see no more of it."</p>

<p>But my anger was too great, and I would have none of him. Then&mdash;and
now I marvel at the man's forbearance&mdash;he offered me money to
recompense me for my trouble. 'Twas honestly meant, and oft have
I regretted my action, but to me in my fury it seemed but an added
insult.</p>

<p>"Nay," said I angrily; "I take no payment from butchers. I am
a gentleman, if a poor one."</p>

<p>At this he flushed wrathfully, and I thought for an instant that
he would have drawn on me; but he refrained, and I rode off alone
among the moors. I knew naught of the land, and I must have taken
the wrong way, for noon found me hopelessly mazed among a tangle
of rocks and hills and peat-mosses. Verily, Quentin Kennedy had
taken the best revenge by suffering me to follow my own leading.</p>

<p>In the early hours of my journey my head was in such a whirl
of wrath and dismay, that I had little power to think settled
thoughts. I was in a desperate confusion, half angry at my own
haste, and half bitter at the coldness of a friend who would permit
a stranger to ride off alone with scarce a word of regret. When
I have thought the matter out in after days, I have been as perplexed
as ever; yet it still seems to me, though I know not how, that
I acted as any man of honor and heart would approve. Still this
thought was little present to me in my discomfort, as I plashed
through the sodden turf.</p>

<p>I had breakfasted at Kennedy's house of Dunpeel in the early
morning, and since I had no provision of any sort with me, 'twas
not long ere the biting of hunger began to set in. My race is
a hardy stock, used to much hardships and rough fare, but in this
inclement land my heart failed me wholly, and I grew sick and
giddy, what with the famishing and the cold rain. For, though
'twas late August, the month of harvest and fruit-time in my own
fair land, it seemed more like winter. The gusts of sharp wind
came driving out of the mist and pierced me to the very marrow.
So chill were they that my garments were of no avail to avert
them; being, indeed, of the thinnest, and cut according to the
fashion of fine cloth for summer wear at the shows and gallantries
of the town. A pretty change, thought I, from the gardens of Versailles
and the trim streets of Paris to this surly land; and sad it was
to see my cloak, meant for no rougher breeze than the gentle south,
tossed and scattered by a grim wind.</p>

<p>I have marked it often, and here I proved its truth, that man's
thoughts turn always to the opposites of his present state. Here
was I, set in the most uncharitable land on earth; and yet ever
before my eyes would come brief visions of the gay country which
I had forsaken. In a gap of hill I fancied that I descried a level
distance with sunny vineyards and rich orchards, to which I must
surely come if I but hastened. When I stooped to drink at a stream,
I fancied ere I drank it that the water would taste like the Bordeaux
I was wont to drink at the little hostelry in the Rue Margot;
and when the tasteless liquid once entered my mouth, the disenchantment
was severe. I met one peasant, an old man bent with toil, coarse-featured,
yet not without some gleams of kindness, and I could not refrain
from addressing him in my native tongue. For though I could make
some shape at his barbarous patois, in my present distress it
came but uneasily from my lips. He stared at me stupidly, and
when I repeated the question in the English, he made some unintelligible
reply, and stumbled onward in his way. I watched his poor figure
as he walked. Such, thought I, are the <em>canaille</em> of the
land, and 'tis little wonder if their bodies be misshapen, and
their minds dull, for an archangel would become a boor if he dwelt
here for any space of time.</p>

<p>But enough of such dreams, and God knows no man had ever less
cause for dreaming. Where was I to go, and what might my purpose
be in this wilderness which men call the world? An empty belly
and a wet skin do not tend to sedate thinking, so small wonder
if I saw little ahead. I was making for the end of the earth,
caring little in what direction, weary and sick of heart, with
sharp anger at the past, and never a hope for the morrow.</p>

<p>Yet, even in my direst days, I have ever found some grain of
expectation to console me. I had five crowns in my purse; little
enough, but sufficient to win me a dinner and a bed at some cheap
hostelry. So all through the gray afternoon I looked sharply for
a house, mistaking every monstrous bowlder for a gable-end. I
cheered my heart with thinking of dainties to be looked for; a
dish of boiled fish, or a piece of mutton from one of the wild-faced
sheep which bounded ever and anon across my path. Nay, I was in
no mood to be fastidious. I would e'en be content with a poor
fare, provided always I could succeed in swallowing it, for my
desire soon became less for the attainment of a pleasure than
for the alleviation of a discomfort. For I was ravenous as a hawk,
and had it in my heart more than once to dismount, and seek for
the sparse hill-berries.</p>

<p>And, indeed, this was like to have been my predicament, for the
day grew late and I came no nearer a human dwelling. The valley
in which I rode grew wider, about to open, as I thought, into
the dale of a river. The hills, from rising steeply by the wayside,
were withdrawn to the distance of maybe a mile, where they lifted
their faces through the network of the mist. All the land between
them, save a strip where the road lay, was filled with a black
marsh, where moor birds made a most dreary wailing. It minded
me of the cries of the innocents whom King Herod slew, as I had
seen the dead represented outside the village church of Rohaine
in my far-away homeland. My heart grew sore with longing. I had
bartered my native country for the most dismal on earth, and all
for nothing. Madman that I was, were it not better to be a beggar
in France than a horse-captain in any other place? I cursed my
folly sorely, as each fresh blast sent a shiver through my body.
Nor was my horse in any better state &mdash;Saladin, whom I had
seen gayly decked at a procession with ribbons and pretty favors,
who had carried me so often and so far, who had always fared on
the best. The poor beast was in a woeful plight, with his pasterns
bleeding from the rough stones and his head bent with weariness.
Verily, I pitied him more than myself, and if I had had a crust
we should have shared it.</p>

<p>The night came in, black as a draw-well and stormy as the Day
of Doom. I had now no little trouble in picking out the way from
among the treacherous morasses. Of a sudden my horse would have
a forefoot in a pool of black peat-water, from which I would scarce,
by much pulling, recover him. A sharp jag of stone in the way
would all but bring him to his knees. So we dragged wearifully
along, scarce fearing, caring, hoping for anything in this world
or another.</p>

<p>It was, I judge, an hour after nightfall, about nine of the clock,
when I fancied that some glimmer shot through the thick darkness.
I could have clapped my hands for joy had I been able; but alas!
these were so stiff, that clapping was as far from me as from
a man with the palsy.</p>

<p>"Courage!" said I, "courage, Saladin! There is yet hope for us!"</p>

<p>The poor animal seemed to share in my expectations. He carried
me quicker forward, so that soon the feeble gleam had grown to
a broad light. Inn or dwelling, thought I, there I stay, for I
will go not a foot further for man or devil. My sword must e'en
be my <em>fourrier</em> to get me a night's lodging. Then I saw
the house, a low, dark place, unillumined save for that front
window which shone as an invitation to travelers. In a minute
I was at the threshold. There, in truth, was the sign flapping
above the lintel. 'Twas an inn at length, and my heart leaped
out in gratitude.</p>
