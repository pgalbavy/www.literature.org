<p><em>ONE </em>morning in early spring, at the beginning of the
last century, a party of four persons left the frontier town of
Woodvale, in southern Ohio, and started on their long journey
across the continent.</p>

<p>Do you need an introduction to the little company? Hardly, and
yet it is well to recall them to mind.</p>

<p>First of all was our old friend Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, to whom
we bade good-bye at the close of the story "Deerfoot in the Forest,"
with a hint of the important expedition upon which he had decided
to enter with his companions. He was mounted on a tough, wiry
pony that had been presented to him by his friend Simon Kenton,
and which, in honor of the famous ranger, the new owner had named
"Simon."</p>

<p>This horse was provided with a bridle, but that was all. Deerfoot,
one of the finest of horsemen, never used a saddle. He said the
bare back of a well-conditioned steed was more pleasant than a
seat of leather, and he had never yet bestrode an animal that
could displace him. On this trip the Indian youth carried as his
principal weapon the handsome rifle presented by General William
H. Harrison, Governor of Indiana Territory. Deerfoot had not yielded
a bit of his faith in his bow, but that implement would not prove
so handy as the other in an excursion on horseback. Besides, his
three companions had begged him to leave his bow at home, and
he was quite willing to do so.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was dressed as he has been before described, but he
carried a long, heavy blanket that was strapped to the back of
his horse and served in lieu of a saddle. The powder horn and
bullet pouch suspended from his neck were as full as they could
carry. He looked so graceful on his animal that many expressions
of admiration were heard from the people of Woodvale who had gathered
to see the start. Deerfoot did not seem to hear any of the compliments,
though some were addressed directly to him. He was never pleased
with anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Little need be said of Mul-tal-la, the Blackfoot, who had come
from the neighborhood of the Rocky Mountains on an exploring expedition
of his own, and was now to return with the Shawanoe as his comrade.
The sturdy, shaggy horse, which he had obtained through the help
also of Simon Kenton, was accoutred like the one ridden by Deerfoot.
The blanket strapped to his back was the one brought by the owner
from that far-off region, and served him also as a saddle. The
Blackfoot, like nearly all the Indians of the Northwest, was an
excellent horseman. Through some whim, which no one understood,
Mul-tal-la had named his animal "Bug," a title so unromantic that
for a long time it was never heard without causing a smile from
his companions. Sometimes Mul-tal-la also grinned, but nothing
could induce him to change the name.</p>

<p>You remember the grief of Victor Shelton was so depressing over
the death of his father that he surely would have gone into a
decline but for the ardor roused by this proposed excursion to
the Pacific. The prospect was so fascinating that he came out
of the dark clouds that gathered about him, and was the most enthusiastic
of the four.</p>

<p>George was almost as deeply stirred and in as high spirits as
his brother, but now and then a tremor of fear passed over him
when he thought of what they would have to pass through before
their return. He would have shrunk and probably turned back but
for Deerfoot. There was no person in the world in whom he had
such faith as in the young Shawanoe; but there is a limit to human
attainment, and it might be that his dusky friend would soon reach
his when the four turned their faces westward.</p>

<p>George had named his horse "Jack," while Victor called his "Prince."
All were quite similar to one another, being strong, sturdy, docile
and enduring, but none was specially gifted in the way of speed.
More than likely they would meet many of their kind among the
Indians which would be their superior in fleetness. But, if danger
threatened, our friends would not rely upon their horses for safety.</p>

<p>Now, in setting out on so long a journey, which of necessity
must last many months, our friends had to carry some luggage with
them. This was made as light as possible, but pared to the utmost
there was enough to require a fifth horse. While of the same breed
as the others, he was of stronger build and best fitted for burdens.
He was the gift of Ralph Genther, who, you may recall, was beaten
in the turkey shoot by Deerfoot. It was Genther who named him
"Zigzag."</p>

<p>"’Cause," explained the donor, "if you let him to go as he pleases,
he’ll make the crookedest track in creation; he will beat a ram’s
horn out of sight."</p>

<p>Excepting his blanket, Mul-tal-la had no luggage which he did
not wear on his person. It must be admitted that the American
Indian as a rule is much lacking in that virtue which is said
to be next to godliness. Despite the romance that is often thrown
around the red man, it is generally more pleasant to view him
at a distance. Close companionship with him is by no means pleasant.</p>

<p>I need hardly say that it was not so with Deerfoot. He was as
dainty as any lady with his person. Kenton, Boone and others had
laughed at him many times because of his care in bathing and the
frequency with which he plunged into icy cold water for no other
reason than for tidiness and health. The material of which his
hunting shirt and leggings were made allowed them to be worn a
long time without showing the effects, but underneath them was
underclothing kept scrupulously clean by Deerfoot’s own hands.
Only his close friends knew of his care in this respect, and some
of them looked upon it as a weakness approaching effeminacy. And
you and I esteem him all the more for these traits, which harmonized
with the nobility of his character.</p>

<p>So it was that in the large package secured to the back of Zigzag
was considerable that Deerfoot himself had wrapped up, and with
the modesty of a girl carefully screened from prying eyes. Aunt
Dinah, had she been permitted, would have loaded down two horses
with articles for the twins, who, she declared, could not possibly
get on without them. As it was, it is enough to say that the boys
were far better remembered than they would have been if left to
themselves. As Victor expressed it when he saw her gathering and
tying up the goods, they had enough to last them for a journey
round the world.</p>

<p>The start was made early on Monday morning, when the sun was
shining bright and the opening spring stirred every heart into
life and filled it with thankfulness to the Giver of All Good.
Men, women and children had gathered in the clearing to the north
of the settlement to see the party start and to wish them good
speed on their journey. Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la had ridden in
from the Shawanoe’s home the day before, so that the start might
be made from the settlement.</p>

<p>There were the laughing, the jesting, the merry and earnest expressions,
with here and there a moist eye, when the travelers were seen
seated on their horses and pausing for the final words. The one
most to be pitied in all the group was Aunt Dinah, who was bravely
trying to hide her real feelings under an expansive smile, in
which there was not a shadow of mirth or pleasantry. She stood
on the outer edge of the boisterous group, her folded hands under
her apron, her eyes fixed on the boys, who were laughing, shaking
hands and exchanging wishes and jests with their friends.</p>

<p>Suddenly the colored woman walked forward, pushing her way through
the throng to the side of Deerfoot. Then she drew a piece of old-fashioned
blue writing paper from under her apron and handed it up to him.
He looked smilingly down at her, and she, without saying anything,
walked back to the fringe of people and faced around again.</p>

<p>Deerfoot opened the slip and saw some writing in pencil. During
the years when George and Victor Shelton struggled, with more
or less success, to obtain a common-school education, Aunt Dinah
had managed to pick up a bit here and there of elementary knowledge.
She had spent a long time the night before, groaning in spirit,
often sharpening her stub of a pencil, which, of course, she frequently
thrust into her mouth, rubbing out and re-writing, perspiring
and toiling with might and main to put together a message for
the young Shawanoe’s eyes alone. Not until the other members of
the household had long been sunk in slumber did she get the missive
in final shape.</p>

<p>Some of the letters were turned backward, all curiously twisted,
the lines irregular and the writing grotesque, but the youth to
whom the paper was passed made out the following:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>
"Mister Dearfut—i feal orful bad 2 hav u go orf with them preshus<br/>

<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
"p.s.—Doan forgot Ise prayin’ 4 yo. De caik am 4 yo.

</p>
<p>
"p.s.—De caik am yo’s—Ise prayin’ 4 yo."

</p>
</div>
<p>There was not the ghost of a smile on the face of the Shawanoe
while carefully tracing the meaning of this crude writing. He
gently refolded the paper, reached one hand within his hunting
shirt, and, drawing out his Bible, put the folded paper between
the leaves and replaced the book. Then, heedless of the clamor
around him, he looked over the heads of the people at the lonely
woman standing a little way off and watching him with manifest
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Turning the head of his horse toward her, he deftly directed
him through the throng and halted at the side of Aunt Dinah. She
was so confused that she was on the point of making off, for nearly
everyone was looking at the two, the action of Deerfoot having
drawn attention to the couple. Leaning over his horse he extended
his palm.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Aunt Dinah."</p>

<p>She bashfully reached up her big hard hand. He held it for a
few moments, and, looking down in the ebon countenance, spoke
in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot thanks you; he is glad that you will pray to the Great
Spirit for him, for he needs your prayers. Your promise is sweet
to Deerfoot."</p>

<p>Aunt Dinah did not speak, for with every eye upon her and the
Indian she could not think of a syllable to say. While she was
trying to do so, Deerfoot did something which no one ever saw
him do before, and which was so strange that it hushed every voice.
He leaned still farther from the back of his horse and deliberately
touched his lips to the cheek of the colored woman. Then he straightened
up, and, without a word, started his animal on a brisk walk to
the northward, the others falling into line behind him.</p>
