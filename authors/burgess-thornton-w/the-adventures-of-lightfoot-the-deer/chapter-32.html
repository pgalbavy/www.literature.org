<p>Lightfoot the Deer was unhappy. It was a strange unhappiness,
an unhappiness such as he had never known before. You see, he
had discovered that there was a stranger in the Green Forest,
a stranger of his own kind, another Deer. He knew it by dainty
footprints in the mud along the Laughing Brook and on the edge
of the pond of Paddy the Beaver. He knew it by other signs which
he ran across every now and then. But search as he would, he was
unable to find that newcomer. He had searched everywhere but always
he was just too late. The stranger had been and gone.</p>

<p>Now there was no anger in Lightfoot's desire to find that stranger.
Instead, there was a great longing. For the first time in his
life Lightfoot felt lonely. So he hunted and hunted and was unhappy.
He lost his appetite. He slept little. He roamed about uneasily,
looking, listening, testing every Merry Little Breeze, but all
in vain.</p>

<p>Then, one never-to-be-forgotten night, as he drank at the Laughing
Brook, a strange feeling swept over him. It was the feeling of
being watched. Lightfoot lifted his beautiful head and a slight
movement caught his quick eye and drew it to a thicket not far
away. The silvery light of gentle Mistress Moon fell full on that
thicket, and thrust out from it was the most beautiful head in
all the Great World. At least, that is the way it seemed to Lightfoot,
though to tell the truth it was not as beautiful as his own, for
it was uncrowned by antlers. For a long minute Lightfoot stood
gazing. A pair of wonderful, great, soft eyes gazed back at him.
Then that beautiful head disappeared.</p>

<p>With a mighty bound, Lightfoot cleared the Laughing Brook and
rushed over to the thicket in which that beautiful head had disappeared.
He plunged in, but there was no one there. Frantically he searched,
but that thicket was empty. Then he stood still and listened.
Not a sound reached him. It was as still as if there were no other
living things in all the Green Forest. The beautiful stranger
had slipped away as silently as a shadow.</p>

<p>All the rest of that night Lightfoot searched through the Green
Forest but his search was in vain. The longing to find that beautiful
stranger had become so great that he fairly ached with it. It
seemed to him that until he found her he could know no happiness.</p>
