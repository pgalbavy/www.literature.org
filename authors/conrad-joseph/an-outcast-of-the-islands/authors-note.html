<p>"An Outcast of the Islands" is my second novel in the absolute
sense of the word; second in conception, second in execution,
second as it were in its essence. There was no hesitation, half-formed
plan, vague idea, or the vaguest reverie of anything else between
it and "Almayer’s Folly." The only doubt I suffered from, after
the publication of "Almayer’s Folly," was whether I should write
another line for print. Those days, now grown so dim, had their
poignant moments. Neither in my mind nor in my heart had I then
given up the sea. In truth I was clinging to it desperately, all
the more desperately because, against my will, I could not help
feeling that there was something changed in my relation to it.
"Almayer’s Folly," had been finished and done with. The mood itself
was gone. But it had left the memory of an experience that, both
in thought and emotion was unconnected with the sea, and I suppose
that part of my moral being which is rooted in consistency was
badly shaken. I was a victim of contrary stresses which produced
a state of immobility. I gave myself up to indolence. Since it
was impossible for me to face both ways I had elected to face
nothing. The discovery of new values in life is a very chaotic
experience; there is a tremendous amount of jostling and confusion
and a momentary feeling of darkness. I let my spirit float supine
over that chaos.</p>

<p>A phrase of Edward Garnett’s is, as a matter of fact, responsible
for this book. The first of the friends I made for myself by my
pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient, at that
time, of my confidences. One evening when we had dined together
and he had listened to the account of my perplexities (I fear
he must have been growing a little tired of them) he pointed out
that there was no need to determine my future absolutely. Then
he added: "You have the style, you have the temperament; why not
write another?" I believe that as far as one man may wish to influence
another man’s life Edward Garnett had a great desire that I should
go on writing. At that time, and I may say, ever afterwards, he
was always very patient and gentle with me. What strikes me most
however in the phrase quoted above which was offered to me in
a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom.
Had he said, "Why not go on writing," it is very probable he would
have scared me away from pen and ink for ever; but there was nothing
either to frighten one or arouse one’s antagonism in the mere
suggestion to "write another." And thus a dead point in the revolution
of my affairs was insidiously got over. The word "another" did
it. At about eleven o’clock of a nice London night, Edward and
I walked along interminable streets talking of many things, and
I remember that on getting home I sat down and wrote about half
a page of "An Outcast of the Islands"  before I slept. This was
committing myself definitely, I won’t say to another life, but
to another book. There is apparently something in my character
which will not allow me to abandon for good any piece of work
I have begun. I have laid aside many beginnings. I have laid them
aside with sorrow, with disgust, with rage, with melancholy and
even with self-contempt; but even at the worst I had an uneasy
consciousness that I would have to go back to them.</p>

<p>"An Outcast of the Islands" belongs to those novels of mine that
were never laid aside; and though it brought me the qualification
of "exotic writer" I don’t think the charge was at all justified.</p>

<p>For the life of me I don’t see that there is the slightest exotic
spirit in the conception or style of that novel. It is certainly
the most <em>tropical</em> of my eastern tales. The mere scenery
got a great hold on me as I went on, perhaps because (I may just
as well confess that) the story itself was never very near my
heart.</p>

<p>It engaged my imagination much more than my affection. As to
my feeling for Willems it was but the regard one cannot help having
for one’s own creation. Obviously I could not be indifferent to
a man on whose head I had brought so much evil simply by imagining
him such as he appears in the novel&mdash;and that, too, on a very
slight foundation.</p>

<p>The man who suggested Willems to me was not particularly interesting
in himself. My interest was aroused by his dependent position,
his strange, dubious status of a mistrusted, disliked, worn-out
European living on the reluctant toleration of that Settlement
hidden in the heart of the forest-land, up that sombre stream
which our ship was the only white men’s ship to visit. With his
hollow, clean-shaved cheeks, a heavy grey moustache and eyes without
any expression whatever, clad always in a spotless sleeping suit
much be-frogged in front, which left his lean neck wholly uncovered,
and with his bare feet in a pair of straw slippers, he wandered
silently amongst the houses in daylight, almost as dumb as an
animal and apparently much more homeless. I don’t know what he
did with himself at night. He must have had a place, a hut, a
palm-leaf shed, some sort of hovel where he kept his razor and
his change of sleeping suits. An air of futile mystery hung over
him, something not exactly dark but obviously ugly. The only definite
statement I could extract from anybody was that it was he who
had "brought the Arabs into the river." That must have happened
many years before. But how did he bring them into the river? He
could hardly have done it in his arms like a lot of kittens. I
knew that Almayer founded the chronology of all his misfortunes
on the date of that fateful advent; and yet the very first time
we dined with Almayer there was Willems sitting at table with
us in the manner of the skeleton at the feast, obviously shunned
by everybody, never addressed by any one, and for all recognition
of his existence getting now and then from Almayer a venomous
glance which I observed with great surprise. In the course of
the whole evening he ventured one single remark which I didn’t
catch because his articulation was imperfect, as of a man who
had forgotten how to speak. I was the only person who seemed aware
of the sound. Willems subsided. Presently he retired, pointedly
unnoticed&mdash;into the forest maybe? Its immensity was there, within
three hundred yards of the verandah, ready to swallow up anything.
Almayer conversing with my captain did not stop talking while
he glared angrily at the retreating back. Didn’t that fellow bring
the Arabs into the river! Nevertheless Willems turned up next
morning on Almayer’s verandah. From the bridge of the steamer
I could see plainly these two, breakfasting together, tete a tete
and, I suppose, in dead silence, one with his air of being no
longer interested in this world and the other raising his eyes
now and then with intense dislike.</p>

<p>It was clear that in those days Willems lived on Almayer’s charity.
Yet on returning two months later to Sambir I heard that he had
gone on an expedition up the river in charge of a steam-launch
belonging to the Arabs, to make some discovery or other. On account
of the strange reluctance that everyone manifested to talk about
Willems it was impossible for me to get at the rights of that
transaction. Moreover, I was a newcomer, the youngest of the company,
and, I suspect, not judged quite fit as yet for a full confidence.
I was not much concerned about that exclusion. The faint suggestion
of plots and mysteries pertaining to all matters touching Almayer’s
affairs amused me vastly. Almayer was obviously very much affected.
I believe he missed Willems immensely. He wore an air of sinister
preoccupation and talked confidentially with my captain. I could
catch only snatches of mumbled sentences. Then one morning as
I came along the deck to take my place at the breakfast table
Almayer checked himself in his low-toned discourse. My captain’s
face was perfectly impenetrable. There was a moment of profound
silence and then as if unable to contain himself Almayer burst
out in a loud vicious tone:</p>

<p>"One thing’s certain; if he finds anything worth having up there
they will poison him like a dog."</p>

<p>Disconnected though it was, that phrase, as food for thought,
was distinctly worth hearing. We left the river three days afterwards
and I never returned to Sambir; but whatever happened to the protagonist
of my Willems nobody can deny that I have recorded for him a less
squalid fate.</p>
