<p>The three accomplices, who were perfectly acquainted with all the
niceties of the French language and familiar with every slang phrase,
did not for a moment mistake the true sense of that unexpected
exclamation. They were astounded.
</p><p>Vorski put the question to Conrad and Otto.
</p><p>"Eh? What does he say?"
</p><p>"What you heard . . . . That's right," said Otto.
</p><p>Vorski ended by making a fresh attack on the shoulder of the stranger,
who turned on his couch, stretched himself, yawned, seemed to fall
asleep again, and, suddenly admitting himself defeated, half sat up and
shouted:
</p><p>"When you've quite finished, please! Can't a man have a quiet snooze
these days, in this beastly hole?"
</p><p>A ray of light blinded his eyes: and he spluttered, in alarm:
</p><p>"What is it? What do you want with me?"
</p><p>Vorski put down his lantern on a projection in the wall; and the face
now stood clearly revealed. The old man, who had continued to vent his
ill temper in incoherent complaints, looked at his visitor, became
gradually calmer, even assumed an amiable and almost smiling expression
and, holding out his hand, exclaimed:
</p><p>"Well, I never! Why, it's you, Vorski! How are you, old bean?"
</p><p>Vorski gave a start. That the old man should know him and call him by
his name did not astonish him immensely, since he had the half-mystic
conviction that he was expected as a prophet might be. But to a prophet,
to a missionary clad in light and glory, entering the presence of a
stranger crowned with the double majesty of age and sacerdotal rank, it
was painful to be hailed by the name of "old bean!"
</p><p>Hesitating, ill at ease, not knowing with whom he was dealing, he asked:
</p><p>"Who are you? What are you here for? How did you get here?"
</p><p>And, when the other stared at him with a look of surprise, he repeated,
in a louder voice:
</p><p>"Answer me, can't you? Who are you?"
</p><p>"Who am I?" replied the old man, in a husky and bleating voice. "Who am
I? By Teutatès, god of the Gauls, is it you who ask me that question?
Then you don't know me? Come, try and remember . . . . Good old
Ségenax--eh, do you get me now--Velléda's father, good old Ségenax, the
law-giver venerated by the Rhedons of whom Chateaubriand speaks in the
first volume of his <u>Martyrs</u>? . . . Ah, I see your memory's reviving!"
</p><p>"What are you gassing about!" cried Vorski.
</p><p>"I'm not gassing. I'm explaining my presence here and the regrettable
events which brought me here long ago. Disgusted by the scandalous
behaviour of Velléda, who had gone wrong with that dismal blighter
Eudorus, I became what we should call a Trappist nowadays, that is to
say, I passed a brilliant exam, as a bachelor of Druid laws. Since that
time, in consequence of a few sprees--oh, nothing to speak of: three or
four jaunts to Paris, where I was attracted by Mabille and afterwards by
the Moulin Rouge--I was obliged to accept the little berth which I fill
here, a cushy job, as you see: guardian of the God-Stone, a shirker's
job, what!"
</p><p>Vorski's amazement and uneasiness increased at each word. He consulted
his companions.
</p><p>"Break his head," Conrad repeated. "That's what I say: and I stick to
it."
</p><p>"And you, Otto?"
</p><p>"I think we ought to be on our guard."
</p><p>"Of course we must be on our guard."
</p><p>But the old Druid caught the word. Leaning on a staff, he helped himself
up and exclaimed:
</p><p>"What's the meaning of this? Be on your guard . . . against me! That's
really a bit thick! Treat me as a fake! Why, haven't you seen my axe,
with the pattern of the swastika? The swastika, the leading cabalistic
symbol, eh, what? . . . And this? What do you call this?" He lifted his
string of beads. "What do you call it? Horse-chestnuts? You've got some
cheek, you have, to give a name like that to serpents' eggs, 'eggs which
they form out of slaver and the froth of their bodies mingled and which
they cast into the air, hissing the while.' It's Pliny's own words I'm
quoting! You're not going to treat Pliny also as a fake, I hope! . . .
You're a pretty customer! Putting yourself on your guard against me,
when I have all my degrees as an ancient Druid, all my diplomas, all my
patents, all my certificates signed by Pliny and Chateaubriand! The
cheek of you! . . . Upon my word, you won't find many ancient Druids of
my sort, genuine, of the period, with the bloom of age upon them and a
beard of centuries! I a fake, I, who boast every tradition and who
juggle with the customs of antiquity! . . . Shall I dance the ancient
Druid dance for you, as I did before Julius Caesar? Would you like me
to?"
</p><p>And, without waiting for a reply, the old man, flinging aside his staff,
began to cut the most extravagant capers and to execute the wildest of
jigs with perfectly astounding agility. And it was the most laughable
sight to see him jumping and twisting about, with his back bent, his
arms outstretched, his legs shooting to right and left from under his
robe, his beard following the evolutions of his frisking body, while the
bleating voice announced the successive changes in the performance:
</p><p>"The ancient Druids' dance, or Caesar's delight! Hi-tiddly, hi-tiddly,
hi-ti, hi! . . . The mistletoe dance, vulgarly known as the tickletoe!
. . . The serpents' egg waltz, music by Pliny! Hullo there! Begone, dull
care! . . . The Vorska, or the tango of the thirty coffins! . . . The
hymn of the Red Prophet! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Glory be to the
prophet!"
</p><p>He continued his furious jig a little longer and then suddenly halted
before Vorski and, in a solemn tone, said:
</p><p>"Enough of this prattle! Let us talk seriously, I am commissioned to
hand you the God-Stone. Now that you are here, are you ready to take
delivery of the goods?"
</p><p>The three accomplices were absolutely flabbergasted. Vorski did not know
what to do, was unable to make out who the infernal fellow was:
</p><p>"Oh, shut up!" he shouted, angrily. "What do you want? What's your
object?"
</p><p>"What do you mean, my object? I've just told you; to hand you the
God-Stone!"
</p><p>"But by what right? In what capacity?"
</p><p>The ancient Druid nodded his head:
</p><p>"Yes, I see what you're after. Things are not happening in the least as
you thought they would. Of course, you came here feeling jolly spry,
glad and proud of the work you had done. Just think; furnishings for
thirty coffins, four women crucified, shipwrecks, hands steeped in
blood, murders galore. Those things are no small beer; and you were
expecting an imposing reception, with an official ceremony, solemn pomp
and state, antique choirs, processions of bards and minstrels, human
sacrifices and what not; the whole Gallic bag of tricks! Instead of
which, a poor beggar of a Druid, snoozing in a corner, who just simply
offers you the goods. What a come down, my lords! Can't be helped,
Vorski; we do what we can and every man acts according to the means at
his disposal. I'm not a millionaire, you know; and I've already advanced
you, in addition to the washing of a few white robes, some thirty francs
forty for Bengal lights, fountains of fire and a nocturnal earthquake."
</p><p>Vorski started, suddenly understanding and beside himself with rage:
</p><p>"What! So it was . . ."
</p><p>"Of course it was me! Who did you think it was? St. Augustine? Unless
you believed in an intervention of the gods and supposed that they took
the trouble last night to send an archangel to the island, arrayed in a
white robe, to lead you to the hollow oak! . . . Really, you're asking
too much!"
</p><p>Vorski clenched his fists. So the man in white whom he had pursued the
night before was no other than this impostor!
</p><p>"Oh," he growled, "I'm not fond of having my leg pulled!"
</p><p>"Having your leg pulled!" cried the old man. "You've got a cheek, old
chap! Who hunted me like a wild beast, till I was quite out of breath?
And who drove bullets through my best Sunday robe? I never knew such a
fellow! It'll teach me to put my back into a job again!"
</p><p>"That'll do!" roared Vorski. "That'll do. Once more and for the last
time . . . what do you want with me?"
</p><p>"I'm sick of telling you. I am commissioned to hand you the God-Stone."
</p><p>"Commissioned by whom?"
</p><p>"Oh, hanged if I know! I've always been brought up to believe that some
day a prince of Almain would appear at Sarek, one Vorski, who would slay
his thirty victims and to whom I was to make an agreed signal when his
thirtieth victim had breathed her last. Therefore, as I'm a slave to
orders, I got together my little parcel, bought two Bengal lights at
three francs seventy-five apiece at a hardware shop in Brest, <u>plus</u> a
few choice crackers, and, at the appointed hour, took up my perch in my
observatory, taper in hand, all ready for work. When you started
howling, in the top of the tree, 'She's dead! She's dead!' I thought
that was the right moment, set fire to the lights and with my crackers
shook the bowels of the earth. There! Now you know all about it."
</p><p>Vorski stepped forward, with his fists raised to strike. That torrent of
words, that imperturbable composure, that calm, bantering voice put him
beside himself.
</p><p>"Another word and I'll knock you down!" he cried. "I've had enough of
it."
</p><p>"Is your name Vorski?"
</p><p>"Yes; and then?"
</p><p>"Are you a prince of Almain?"
</p><p>"Yes, yes; and then?"
</p><p>"Have you slain your thirty victims?"
</p><p>"Yes, yes, yes!"
</p><p>"Well, then you're my man. I have a God-Stone to hand you and I mean to
hand it you, come what may. That's the sort of hairpin I am. You've got
to pocket it, your miracle-stone."
</p><p>"But I don't care a hang for the God-Stone!" roared Vorski, stamping his
foot. "And I don't care a hang for you! I want nobody. The God-Stone!
Why, I've got it, it's mine. I've got it on me."
</p><p>"Let's have a look."
</p><p>"What do you call that?" said Vorski, taking from his pocket the little
stone disk which he had found in the pommel of the sceptre.
</p><p>"That?" asked the old man, with an air of surprise. "Where did you get
that from?"
</p><p>"From the pommel of this sceptre, when I unfastened it."
</p><p>"And what do you call it?"
</p><p>"It's a piece of the God-Stone."
</p><p>"You're mad."
</p><p>"Then what do you say it is?"
</p><p>"That's a trouser-button."
</p><p>"A what?"
</p><p>"A trouser-button."
</p><p>"How do you make that out?"
</p><p>"A trouser-button with the shaft broken off, a button of the sort which
the niggers in the Sahara wear. I've a whole set of them."
</p><p>"Prove it, damn you!"
</p><p>"I put it there."
</p><p>"What for?"
</p><p>"To take the place of the precious stone which Maguennoc sneaked, the
one which burnt him and obliged him to cut off his hand."
</p><p>Vorski was silent. He was nonplussed. He had no notion what to do next
or how to behave towards this strange adversary.
</p><p>The ancient Druid went up to him and, gently, in a fatherly voice:
</p><p>"No, my lad," he said, "you can't do without me, you see. I alone hold
the key of the safe and the secret of the casket. Why do you hesitate?"
</p><p>"I don't know you."
</p><p>"You baby! If I were suggesting something indelicate and incompatible
with your honour, I could understand your scruples. But my offer is one
of those which can't offend the nicest conscience. Well, is it a
bargain? No? Not yet? But, by Teutatès, what more do you want, you
unbelieving Vorski? A miracle perhaps? Lord, why didn't you say so
before? Miracles, forsooth: I turn 'em out thirteen to the dozen. I work
a little miracle before breakfast every morning. Just think, a Druid!
Miracles? Why, I've got my shop full of 'em! I can't find room to sit
down for them. Where will you try first? Resurrection department?
Hair-restoring department? Revelation of the future department? You can
choose where you like. Look here, at what time did your thirtieth victim
breathe her last?"
</p><p>"How should I know?"
</p><p>"Eleven fifty-two. Your excitement was so great that it stopped your
watch. Look and see."
</p><p>It was ridiculous. The shock produced by excitement has no effect on the
watch of the man who experiences the excitement. Nevertheless, Vorski
involuntarily took out his watch: it marked eight minutes to twelve. He
tried to wind it up: it was broken.
</p><p>The ancient Druid, without giving him time to recover his breath and
reply, went on:
</p><p>"That staggers you, eh? And yet there's nothing simpler for a Druid who
knows his business. A Druid sees the invisible. He does more: he makes
anyone else see it if he wants to. Vorski, would you like to see
something that doesn't exist? What's your name? I'm not speaking of your
name Vorski, but of your real name, your governor's name."
</p><p>"Silence on that subject!" Vorski commanded. "It's a secret I've
revealed to nobody."
</p><p>"Then why do you write it down?"
</p><p>"I've never written it down."
</p><p>"Vorski, your father's name is written in red pencil on the fourteenth
page of the little note-book you carry on you. Look and see."
</p><p>Acting mechanically, like an automaton whose movements are controlled
by an alien will, Vorski took from his inside pocket a case containing a
small note-book. He turned the pages till he came to the fourteenth,
when he muttered, with indescribable dismay:
</p><p>"Impossible! Who wrote this? And you know what's written here?"
</p><p>"Do you want me to prove it to you?"
</p><p>"Once more, silence! I forbid you . . ."
</p><p>"As you please, old chap! All that I do is meant for your edification.
And it's no trouble to me! Once I start working miracles, I simply can't
stop. Here's another funny little trick. You carry a locket hanging from
a silver chain round your shirt, don't you?"
</p><p>"Yes," said Vorski, his eyes blazing with fever.
</p><p>"The locket consists of a frame, without the photograph which used to be
set in it."
</p><p>"Yes, yes, a portrait of . . ."
</p><p>"Of your mother, I know: and you lost it."
</p><p>"Yes, I lost it last year."
</p><p>"You mean you <u>think</u> you've lost the portrait."
</p><p>"Nonsense, the locket is empty."
</p><p>"You <u>think</u> the locket's empty. It's not. Look and see."
</p><p>Still moving mechanically, with his eyes starting from his head, Vorski
unfastened the button of his shirt and pulled out the chain. The locket
appeared. There was the portrait of a woman in a round gold frame.
</p><p>"It's she, it's she," he muttered, completely taken aback.
</p><p>"Quite sure?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>"Then what do you say to it all, eh? There's no fake about it, no
deception. The ancient Druid's a smart chap and you're coming with him,
aren't you?"
</p><p>"Yes."
</p><p>Vorski was beaten. The man had subjugated him. His superstitious
instincts, his inherited belief in the mysterious powers, his restless
and unbalanced nature, all imposed absolute submission on him. His
suspicion persisted, but did not prevent him from obeying.
</p><p>"Is it far?" he asked.
</p><p>"Next door, in the great hall."
</p><p>Otto and Conrad had been the astounded witnesses of this dialogue.
Conrad tried to protest. But Vorski silenced him:
</p><p>"If you're afraid, go away. Besides," he added, with an affectation of
assurance, "besides, we shall walk with our revolvers ready. At the
slightest alarm, fire."
</p><p>"Fire on me?" chuckled the ancient Druid.
</p><p>"Fire on any enemy, no matter who it may be."
</p><p>"Well, you go first, Vorski . . . . What, won't you?"
</p><p>He had brought them to the very end of the crypt, in the darkest shadow,
where the lantern showed them a recess hollowed at the foot of the wall
and plunging into the rocks in a downward direction.
</p><p>Vorski hesitated and then entered. He had to crawl on his hands and
knees in this narrow, winding passage, from which he emerged, a minute
later, on the threshold of a large hall.
</p><p>The others joined him.
</p><p>"The hall of the God-Stone," the ancient Druid declared, solemnly.
</p><p>It was lofty and imposing, similar in shape and size to the broad walk
under which it lay. The same number of upright stones, which seemed to
be the columns of an immense temple, stood in the same place and formed
the same rows as the menhirs on the walk overhead: stones hewn in the
same uncouth way, with no regard for art or symmetry. The floor was
composed of huge irregular flagstones, intersected with a network of
gutters and covered with round patches of dazzling light, falling from
above at some distance one from the other.
</p><p>In the centre, under Maguennoc's garden, rose a platform of unmortared
stones, fourteen or fifteen feet high, with sides about twenty yards
long. On the top was a dolmen with two sturdy supports and a long, oval
granite table.
</p><p>"Is that it?" asked Vorski, in a husky voice.
</p><p>Without giving a direct answer, the ancient Druid said:
</p><p>"What do you think of it? They were dabs at building, those ancestors of
ours! And what ingenuity they displayed! What precautions against prying
eyes and profane enquiries! Do you know where the light comes from? For
we are in the bowels of the island and there are no windows opening on
to the sky. The light comes from the upper menhirs. They are pierced
from the top to bottom with a channel which widens as it goes down and
which sheds floods of light below. In the middle of the day, when the
sun is shining, it's like fairyland. You, who are an artist, would shout
with admiration."
</p><p>"Then that's <u>it</u>?" Vorski repeated.
</p><p>"At any rate, it's a sacred stone," declared the ancient Druid,
impassively, "since it used to overlook the place of the underground
sacrifices, which were the most important of all. But there is another
one underneath, which is protected by the dolmen and which you can't see
from here; and that is the one on which the selected victims were
offered up. The blood used to flow from the platform and along all these
gutters to the cliffs and down to the sea."
</p><p>Vorski muttered, more and more excited:
</p><p>"Then that's it? If so, let's go on."
</p><p>"No need to stir," said the old man, with exasperating coolness. "It's
not that one either. There's a third; and to see that one you have only
to lift your head a little."
</p><p>"Where? Are you sure?"
</p><p>"Of course! Take a good look . . . above the upper table, yes, in the
very vault which forms the ceiling and which is like a mosaic made of
great flagstones . . . . You can twig it from here, can't you? A
flagstone forming a separate oblong, long and narrow like the lower
table and shaped like it . . . . They might be two sisters . . . . But
there's only one good one, stamped with the trademark . . . ."
</p><p>Vorski was disappointed. He had expected a more elaborate introduction
to a more mysterious hiding-place.
</p><p>"Is that the God-Stone?" he asked. "Why, it has nothing particular about
it."
</p><p>"From a distance, no; but wait till you see it close by. There are
coloured veins in it, glittering lodes, a special grain: in short, the
God-Stone. Besides, it's remarkable not so much for its substance as for
its miraculous properties."
</p><p>"What are the miracles in question?" asked Vorski.
</p><p>"It gives life and death, as you know, and it gives a lot of other
things."
</p><p>"What sort of things?"
</p><p>"Oh, hang it, you're asking me too much! I don't know anything about
it."
</p><p>"How do you mean, you don't know?"
</p><p>The ancient Druid leant over and, in a confidential tone:
</p><p>"Listen, Vorski," he said, "I confess that I have been boasting a bit
and that my function, though of the greatest importance--keeper of the
God-Stone, you know, a first-class berth--is limited by a power which in
a manner of speaking is higher than my own."
</p><p>"What power?"
</p><p>"Velléda's."
</p><p>Vorski eyed him with renewed uneasiness:
</p><p>"Velléda?"
</p><p>"Yes, or at least the woman whom I call Velléda, the last of the
Druidesses: I don't know her real name."
</p><p>"Where is she?"
</p><p>"Here."
</p><p>"Here?"
</p><p>"Yes, on the sacrificial stone. She's asleep."
</p><p>"What, she's asleep?"
</p><p>"She's been sleeping for centuries, since all time. I've never seen her
other than sleeping: a chaste and peaceful slumber. Like the Sleeping
Beauty, Velléda is waiting for him whom the gods have appointed to
awake her; and that is . . ."
</p><p>"Who?"
</p><p>"You, Vorski, you."
</p><p>Vorski knitted his brows. What was the meaning of this improbable story
and what was his impenetrable interlocutor driving at?
</p><p>The ancient Druid continued:
</p><p>"That seems to ruffle you! Come, there's no reason, just because your
hands are red with blood and because you have thirty coffins on your
mind, why you shouldn't have the right to act as Prince Charming. You're
too modest, my young friend. Look here, Velléda is marvellously
beautiful: I tell you, hers is a superhuman beauty. Ah, my fine fellow,
you're getting excited! What? Not yet?"
</p><p>Vorski hesitated. Really he was feeling the danger increase around him
and rise like a swelling wave that is about to break. But the old man
would not leave him alone:
</p><p>"One last word, Vorski; and I'm speaking low so that your friends shan't
hear me. When you wrapped your mother in her shroud, you left on her
fore-finger, in obedience to her formal wish, a ring which she had
always worn, a magic ring made of a large turquoise surrounded by a
circle of smaller turquoises set in gold. Am I right?"
</p><p>"Yes," gasped Vorski, taken aback, "yes, you're right: but I was alone
and it is a secret which nobody knew."
</p><p>"Vorski, if that ring is on Velléda's finger, will you trust me and will
you believe that your mother, in her grave, appointed Velléda to
receive you, that she herself might hand you the miraculous stone?"
</p><p>Vorski was already walking towards the tumulus. He quickly climbed the
first few steps. His head passed the level of the platform.
</p><p>"Oh," he said, staggering back, "the ring . . . the ring is on her
finger!"
</p><p>Between the two supports of the dolmen, stretched on the sacrificial
table and clad in a spotless gown that came down to her feet, lay the
Druidess. Her body and face were turned the other way; and a veil
hanging over her forehead hid her hair. Almost bare, her shapely arm lay
along the table. On the forefinger was a turquoise ring.
</p><p>"Is that your mother's ring all right?" asked the ancient Druid.
</p><p>"Yes, there's no doubt about it."
</p><p>Vorski had hurried across the space between himself and the dolmen and,
stooping, almost kneeling, was examining the turquoises.
</p><p>"The number is complete," he whispered. "One of them is cracked. Another
is half covered by the gold setting which has worked down over it."
</p><p>"You needn't be so cautious," said the old man. "She won't hear you; and
your voice can't wake her. What you had better do is to stand up and
pass your hand lightly over her forehead. That is the magic caress which
will rouse her from her slumber."
</p><p>Vorski stood up. Nevertheless he hesitated to approach the woman, who
inspired him with ungovernable fear and respect.
</p><p>"Don't come any nearer, you two," said the ancient Druid, addressing
Otto and Conrad. "When Velléda's eyes open, they must rest on no one
but Vorski and behold no other sight. Well, Vorski, are you afraid?"
</p><p>"No, I'm not afraid."
</p><p>"Only you're not feeling comfortable. It's easier to murder people than
to bring them to life, what? Come, show yourself a man! Put aside her
veil and touch her forehead. The God-Stone is within your reach. Act and
you will be the master of the world."
</p><p>Vorski acted. Standing against the sacrificial altar, he looked down
upon the Druidess. He bent over the motionless bust. The white gown rose
and fell to the regular rhythm of the breathing. With an undecided hand
he drew back the veil and then stooped lower, so that his other hand
might touch the uncovered forehead.
</p><p>But at that moment his action remained, so to speak, suspended and he
stood without moving, like a man who does not understand but is vainly
trying to understand.
</p><p>"Well, what's up, old chap?" exclaimed the Druid. "You look petrified.
Another squabble? Something gone wrong? Must I come and help you?"
</p><p>Vorski did not answer. He was staring wildly, with an expression of
stupefaction and affright which gradually changed into one of mad
terror. Drops of perspiration trickled over his face. His haggard eyes
seemed to be gazing upon the most horrible vision.
</p><p>The old man burst out laughing:
</p><p>"Lord love us, how ugly you are! I hope the last of the Druidesses won't
raise her divine eyelids and see that hideous mug of yours! Sleep,
Velléda, sleep your pure and dreamless sleep."
</p><p>Vorski stood muttering between his teeth incoherent words which conveyed
the menace of an increasing anger. The truth became partly revealed to
him in a series of flashes. A word rose to his lips which he refused to
utter, as though, in uttering it, he feared lest he should give life to
a being who was no more, to that woman who was dead, yes, dead though
she lay breathing before him: she could not but be dead, because he had
killed her. However, in the end and in spite of himself, he spoke; and
every syllable cost him intolerable suffering:
</p><p>"Véronique . . . . Véronique . . . ."
</p><p>"So you think she's like her?" chuckled the ancient Druid. "Upon my
word, may be you are right: there is a sort of family resemblance
. . . . I dare say, if you hadn't crucified the other with your own
hands and if you hadn't yourself received her last breath, you would be
ready to swear that the two women are one and the same person . . . and
that Véronique d'Hergemont is alive and that she's not even wounded
. . . not even a scar . . . not so much as the mark of the cords round
her wrists . . . . But just look, Vorski, what a peaceful face, what
comforting serenity! Upon my word, I'm beginning to believe that you
made a mistake and that it was another woman you crucified! Just think a
bit! . . . Hullo, you're going to go for me now! Come to my rescue, O
Teutatès! The prophet wants to have my blood!"
</p><p>Vorski had drawn himself up and was now facing the ancient Druid. His
features, fashioned for hatred and fury, had surely never expressed
more of either than at this moment. The ancient Druid was not merely the
man who for an hour had been toying with him as with a child. He was the
man who had performed the most extraordinary feat and who suddenly
appeared to him as the most ruthless and dangerous foe. A man like that
must be got rid of on the spot, since the opportunity presented itself.
</p><p>"I'm done!" said the old man. "He's going to eat me up! Crikey, what an
ogre! . . . Help! Murder! Help! . . . Oh, look at his iron fingers! He's
going to strangle me! . . . Unless he uses a dagger . . . or a rope
. . . . No, a revolver! I prefer that, it's neater . . . . Fire away,
Alexis. Two of the seven bullets have already made holes in my best
Sunday robe. That leaves five. Fire away, Alexis."
</p><p>Each word aggravated Vorski's fury. He was eager to get the work over
and he shouted:
</p><p>"Otto . . . Conrad . . . are you ready?"
</p><p>He raised his arm. The two assistants likewise took aim. Four paces in
front of them stood the old man, laughingly pleading for mercy:
</p><p>"Please, kind gentlemen, have pity on a poor beggar . . . . I won't do
it again . . . . I'll be a good boy . . . . Kind gentlemen, please
. . . ."
</p><p>Vorski repeated:
</p><p>"Otto . . . Conrad . . . attention! . . . I'm counting three: one . . .
two . . . three . . . fire!"
</p><p>The three shots rang out together. The Druid whirled round with one leg
in the air, then drew himself up straight, opposite his adversaries, and
cried, in a tragic voice:
</p><p>"A hit, a palpable hit! Shot through the body! Dead, for a ducat! . . .
The ancient Druid's <u>kaput</u>! . . . A tragic development! Oh, the poor
old Druid, who was so fond of his joke!"
</p><p>"Fire!" roared Vorski. "Shoot, can't you, you idiots? Fire!"
</p><p>"Fire! Fire!" repeated the Druid. "Bang! Bang! A bull's eye! . . . Two!
. . . Three bull's eyes! . . . Your shot, Conrad: bang! . . . Yours,
Otto: bang!"
</p><p>The shots rattled and echoed through the great resounding hall. The
bewildered and furious accomplices were gesticulating before their
target, while the invulnerable old man danced and kicked, now almost
squatting on his heels, now leaping up with astounding agility:
</p><p>"Lord, what fun one can have in a cave! And what a fool you are, Vorski,
my own! You blooming old prophet! . . . What a mug! But, I say, however
could you take it all in? The Bengal lights! The crackers! And the
trouser-button! And your old mother's ring! . . . You silly juggins!
What a spoof!"
</p><p>Vorski stopped. He realized that the three revolvers had been made
harmless, but how? By what unprecedented marvel? What was at the bottom
of all this fantastic adventure? Who was that demon standing in front of
him?
</p><p>He flung away his useless weapon and looked at the old man. Was he
thinking of seizing him in his arms and crushing the life out of him? He
also looked at the woman and seemed ready to fall upon her. But he
obviously no longer felt equal to facing those two strange creatures,
who appeared to him to be remote from the world and from actuality.
</p><p>Then, quickly, he turned on his heel and, calling to his accomplices,
made for the crypts, followed by the ancient Druid's jeers:
</p><p>"Look at that now! He's slinging his hook! And the God-Stone, what about
it? What do you want me to do with it? . . . I say, isn't he showing a
clean pair of heels! . . . Hi! Are your trousers on fire? Yoicks,
tally-ho, tally-ho! Proph--et Proph--et! . . ."
