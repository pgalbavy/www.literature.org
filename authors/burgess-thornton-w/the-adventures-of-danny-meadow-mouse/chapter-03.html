<p><em>LIFE </em>is always a game of hide and seek to Danny Meadow
Mouse. You see, he is such a fat little fellow that there are
a great many other furry-coated people, and almost as many who
wear feathers, who would gobble Danny up for breakfast or for
dinner if they could. Some of them pretend to be his friends,
but Danny always keeps his eyes open when they are around and
always begins to play hide and seek. Peter Rabbit and Jimmy Skunk
and Striped Chipmunk and Happy Jack Squirrel are all friends whom
he can trust, but he always has a bright twinkling eye open for
Reddy Fox and Billy Mink and Shadow the Weasel and old Whitetail
the Marsh Hawk, and several more, especially Hooty the Owl at
night.</p>

<p>Now Danny Meadow Mouse is a stout-hearted little fellow, and
when rough Brother North Wind came shouting across the Green Meadows,
tearing to pieces the snow clouds and shaking out the snowflakes
until they covered the Green Meadows deep, deep, deep, Danny just
snuggled down in his warm coat in his snug little house of grass
and waited. Danny liked the snow. Yes, Sir, Danny Meadow Mouse
liked the snow. He just loved to dig in it and make tunnels. Through
those tunnels in every direction he could go where he pleased
and when he pleased without being seen by anybody. It was great
fun!</p>

<p>Every little way he made a little round doorway up beside a stiff
stalk of grass. Out of this he could peep at the white world,
and he could get the fresh cold air. Sometimes, when he was quite
sure that no one was around, he would scamper across on top of
the snow from one doorway to another, and when he did this, he
made the prettiest little footprints.</p>

<p>Now Reddy Fox knew all about those doorways and who made them.
Reddy was having hard work to get enough to eat this cold weather,
and he was hungry most of the time. One morning, as he came tiptoeing
softly over the meadows, what should he see just ahead of him
but the head of Danny Meadow Mouse pop out of one of those little
round doorways. Reddy’s mouth watered, and he stole forward more
softly than ever. When he got within jumping distance, he drew
his stout hind legs under him and made ready to spring. Presto!
Danny Meadow Mouse had disappeared! Reddy Fox jumped just the
same and began to dig as fast as he could make his paws go. He
could smell Danny Meadow Mouse and that made him almost frantic.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Danny popped his head out of another little doorway
and laughed at Reddy. <em>Page 12.</em>]</p>

<p>All the time Danny Meadow Mouse was scurrying along one of his
little tunnels, and when finally Reddy Fox stopped digging because
he was quite out of breath, Danny popped his head out of another
little doorway and laughed at Reddy. Of course Reddy saw him,
and of course Reddy tried to catch him there, and dug frantically
just as before. And of course Danny Meadow Mouse wasn’t there.</p>

<p>After a while Reddy Fox grew tired of this kind of a game and
tried another plan. The next time he saw Danny Meadow Mouse stick
his head out, Reddy pretended not to see him. He stretched himself
out on the ground and made believe that he was very tired and
sleepy. He closed his eyes. Then he opened them just the tiniest
bit, so that he could see Danny Meadow Mouse and yet seem to be
asleep. Danny watched him for a long time. Then he chuckled to
himself and dropped out of sight.</p>

<p>No sooner was he gone than Reddy Fox stole over close to the
little doorway and waited. "He’ll surely stick his head out again
to see if I’m asleep, and then I’ll have him," said Reddy to himself.
So he waited and waited and waited. By and by he turned his head.
There was Danny Meadow Mouse at another little doorway laughing
at him!</p>
