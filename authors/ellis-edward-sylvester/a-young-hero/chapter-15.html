<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Fred Sheldon told his good friends that inasmuch as his mother
had returned, he would stay at home hereafter, though he promised
to drop in upon them quite often and "take dinner or supper."</p>

<p>The lantern was blown out and the sisters went inside, where,
for the present, we must bid them good-night, and the lad started
homeward.</p>

<p>He had not quite reached the main highway, when, in the stillness
of the night, he caught the rattle of carriage or wagon wheels.
There was nothing unusual in this, for it was the place and time
to look for vehicles, many of which went along the road at all
hours of the day and night.</p>

<p>But so many strange things had happened to Fred during the week
now drawing to a close that he stopped on reaching the outlet
of the lane, and, standing close to the shaded trunk of a large
tree, waited until the wagon should go by.</p>

<p>As it came nearer he saw that it was what is known in some parts
of the country as a "spring-wagon," being light running, with
a straight body and without any cover, so that the driver, sitting
on the front seat, was the most conspicuous object about it.</p>

<p>As it came directly opposite Fred could see that the driver wore
a large sombrero-like hat, and was smoking a pipe. At the same
moment, too, he gave a peculiar sound, caused by an old habit
of clearing his throat, which identified him at once as Bud Heyland.</p>

<p>"That's odd," thought Fred, stepping out from his place of concealment
and following after him; "when Bud goes out at night with a strange
wagon or alone, or with Cyrus Sutton, there's something wrong
on foot."</p>

<p>Not knowing what was best for him to do, Fred walked behind the
wagon a short distance, for the horse was going so slow that this
was an easy matter. But all at once Bud struck the animal a sharp
blow, which sent him spinning forward at such a rate that he speedily
vanished in the darkness.</p>

<p>Young Sheldon continued walking toward home, his thoughts busy
until he reached the stretch of woods, where the courage of any
boy would have been tried in passing it after nightfall. Brave
as he undoubtedly was, Fred felt a little shiver, when fairly
among the dense shadows, for there were some dismal legends connected
with it, and these had grown with the passage of years.</p>

<p>But Fred had never turned back for anything of the kind, and
he was now so cheered by the prospect of being soon again with
his mother that he stepped off briskly, and would have struck
up one of his characteristic whistling tunes had he not heard
the rattle of the same wagon which Bud Heyland drove by a short
while before.</p>

<p>"That's strange," thought the lad; "he couldn't have gone very
far, or he wouldn't have come back so soon."</p>

<p>The darkness was so profound over the stretch of road leading
through the wood that Fred had no fear of being seen as he stepped
a little to one side and waited for the vehicle to pass.</p>

<p>Fortunately for night travel, the portion of the highway which
led through the forest was not long, for, without the aid of a
lantern, no one could see whither he was going, and everything
had to be left to the instinct of the horse himself.</p>

<p>The beast approached at a slow walk, while Bud no doubt was perched
on the high front seat, using his eyes for all they were worth,
which was nothing at all where the gloom was so impenetrable.
He must have refilled his pipe a short time before, for he was
smoking so vigorously that the ember-like glow of the top of the
tobacco could be seen, and the crimson reflection even revealed
the end of Bud's nose and the faintest possible glimpse of his
downy mustache and pimply cheeks, as they glided through the darkness.</p>

<p>The light from this pipe was so marked that Fred moved back a
step or two, afraid it might reveal him to his enemy.</p>

<p>His withdrawal was not entirely satisfactory to himself, as he
could not observe where to place his feet, and striking his heels
against a fallen limb, he went over backward with quite a bump.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" demanded Bud Heyland, checking his horse and glaring
about in the gloom; "is that you, Sutton?"</p>

<p>Fred thought it wiser to make no response, and he silently got
upon his feet again. Bud repeated his question in a husky undertone,
and receiving no reply muttered some profanity and started the
horse forward at the same slow, deliberate pace.</p>

<p>Wondering what it could all mean, young Sheldon stood in the
middle of the road, looking in the direction of the vanishing
wagon, of which, as a matter of course, he could not catch the
slightest glimpse, and asking himself whether it would be wise
to investigate further.</p>

<p>"There's some mischief going on, and it may be that I can&mdash;halloo!"</p>

<p>Once more Bud Heyland drew his horse to a halt, and the same
solemn stillness held reign as before. But it was only for a minute
or two, when Bud gave utterance to a low whistle, which sounded
like the tremolo notes of a flute, on the still air.</p>

<p>Fred Sheldon recalled that the bully used to indulge in that
peculiar signal when he attended school, merely because he fancied
it, and when there could be no significance at all attached to
it.</p>

<p>It was now repeated several times, with such intervals as to
show that Bud was expecting a reply, though none could be heard
by the lad, who was listening for a response.</p>

<p>All at once, yielding to a mischievous impulse, Fred Sheldon
replied, imitating Bud's call with astonishing accuracy.</p>

<p>Instantly the bully seized upon it, and the signal was exchanged
several times, when Bud sprang out of his wagon and came toward
the spot where the other stood.</p>

<p>Fred was frightened when he found there was likely to be a meeting
between him and the one he dreaded so much, and he became as silent
as the tomb.</p>

<p>Bud advanced through the gloom, continually whistling and giving
utterance to angry expressions because he was not answered, while
Fred carefully picked his way a few paces further to the rear
to escape discovery.</p>

<p>"Why don't you speak?" called out Bud; "if you can whistle you
can use your voice, can't you?"</p>

<p>Although this question could have been easily answered, Fred
Sheldon thought it best to hold his peace.</p>

<p>"If you ain't the biggest fool that ever undertook to play the
gentleman!" added the disgusted bully, groping cautiously among
the trees; "everything is ready for&#11834;"</p>

<p>Just then an outstretching limb passed under the chin of Bud
Heyland, and, though walking slowly, he thought it would lift
his head off his shoulders before he could stop himself.</p>

<p>When he did so he was in anything but an amiable mood, and Fred,
laughing, yet scared, was glad he had the friendly darkness in
which to find shelter from the ugliness of the fellow.</p>

<p>Bud had hardly regained anything like his self-possession when
he caught a similar signal to those which had been going on for
some minutes between Fred Sheldon and himself. It came from some
point beyond Fred, but evidently in the highway.</p>

<p>The angry Heyland called out:</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you? Why don't you come on, you fool?"</p>

<p>The person thus addressed hurried over the short distance until
he was close to where Bud stood rubbing his chin and muttering
all sorts of bad words at the delay and pain to which he had been
subjected.</p>

<p>"Halloo, Bud, where are you?"</p>

<p>Guarded as the voice was, Fred immediately recognized it as belonging
to Cyrus Sutton, the cattle drover.</p>

<p>"I'm here; where would I be?" growled the angry bully.</p>

<p>"Tumbling over a fence, or cracking your head against a tree,
I suppose," said Sutton, with a laugh; "when I whistled to you,
why didn't you whistle back again, as we agreed to do?"</p>

<p>It is easy to picture the scowling glare which Bud Heyland turned
upon Sutton as he answered:</p>

<p>"You're a purty one to talk about signals, ain't you? After answering
me half a dozen times, and I got close to you, you must shut up
your mouth, and while I went groping about, I came near sawing
my head off with a knotty limb. When you heard me, why did you
stop?"</p>

<p>"Heard you? What are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"Didn't you whistle to me a while ago, and didn't you keep it
up till I got here, and then you stopped? What are you talking
about, indeed!"</p>

<p>"I was a little late," said Sutton, who began to suspect the
truth, "and have just come into the wood; I whistled to you, and
then you called to me in a rather more personal style than I think
is good taste, and I came forward and here I am, and that's all
there is about it."</p>

<p>"Wasn't that you that answered my whistling a little while ago?"
asked Bud Heyland in an undertone, that fairly trembled with dread.</p>

<p>"No, sir; as I have explained to you, I signaled to find where
you were only a minute since, and I heard nothing of the kind
from you."</p>

<p>"Then we're betrayed!"</p>

<p>Words would fail to depict the tragic manner in which Bud Heyland
gave utterance to this strange remark. His voice was in that peculiar
condition, known as "changing," and at times was a deep bass,
sometimes breaking into a thin squeak.</p>

<p>He sank it to its profoundest depths as he slowly repeated the
terrifying expression, and the effect would have been very impressive,
even to Cyrus Sutton, but for the fact that on the last word his
voice broke and terminated with a sound like that made by a domestic
fowl when the farmer seizes it by the head with the intention
of wringing its neck.</p>

<p>But Cyrus Sutton seemed to think that it was anything else than
a laughing matter, and he asked the particulars of Bud, who gave
them in a stealthily modulated voice, every word of which was
plainly heard by Fred Sheldon, who began to feel somewhat uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You remember the man that was behind us listening when we sat
on the rock last night?" asked Bud.</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"Well, he's watching us still, and ain't far off this very minute.
I wish I had a chance to draw a bead on him."</p>

<p>"You drew several beads last night," said Sutton.</p>

<p>"See here," snarled Bud, "that's enough of that. I'll give you
a little advice for your own good&mdash;let it drop."</p>

<p>"Well, Bud," said the other, in an anxious voice, "it won't do
to try it on now if some one is watching us. So drive back to
Tottenville, put the horse away and we'll take a look around to-morrow
night. If the coast is clear we'll wind the business up."</p>

<p>"It's got to be wound up then," said the bully, earnestly; "it
won't do for me to wait any longer; I've got to j'ine the circus
on Monday, and I must start on Sunday to make it."</p>

<p>"Very well; then we'll take a look around to-morrow and fix things
at night."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Bud, "for you can see that if some officer is
watching us&mdash;halloo!"</p>

<p>This exclamation was caused by the sudden sound of wagon wheels,
and man and boy knew at once that Bud's horse, probably tired
of standing still, had started homeward with the enthusiasm of
a steed who believes that a good supper is awaiting him.</p>
