<p>The extinguishment of the burning roof, for the time, was complete.
Utter darkness came like the blowing out of a candle in a vault.</p>

<p>"The varmints know what it means!" muttered Jo Stinger, who made
a hurried retreat along the roof toward the trap-door, which had
been thrown wide open in readiness for his reception.</p>

<p>The Wyandots were quick to learn the cause of the sudden darkness,
and they opened a brisk fire on the roof. This necessarily was
at random, and the scout dropped through to the floor, without
so much as a scratch upon him.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston and his friends would have felt like uttering
a cheer over the success of Jo's boldness, but for the conviction
that the worst was yet to come and was close at hand.</p>

<p>One fact was so apparent that it caused a strengthening of hope:
the wind, which had been blowing almost a gale from the south,
had fallen, so that the lull was perceptible. Should the Wyandots
fire the cabin standing a short distance from the block-house,
the flames were not likely to communicate unless the gale appeared
again.</p>

<p>All was darkness once more. The wind soughed dismally through
the trees and moaned around the block-house, which was scorched
and still smoking from the burning arrows of the Wyandots. The
fine snowflakes were still sifting downward, and far overhead
was heard again the honk of wild geese flying to the milder regions
of the south.</p>

<p>From within the settler's cabin standing near the stockade came
a dull glow, but there was no other sign of life that eye could
detect. And yet the block-house was environed by hostile red men,
who were as eager as so many wolves to break into the fold.</p>

<p>Colonel Preston, Jo Stinger, Megill, Turner, and the boys were
at the loopholes watching and listening. Mrs. Preston alternated
from the side of her children to that of her husband, exchanging
words with the brave man who had been so cramped in his movements
for the last day or two that he was unable to do the service he
wished to render his friends.</p>

<p>The sounds of hurrying feet, the hoarse guttural exclamations
and the bird-like signals showed that the Wyandots were near the
fort. They had taken advantage of the Egyptian darkness to steal
up close to the sides of the building, where their presence could
only be discovered through some movement that made a noise sufficient
to reach the ears of the listeners above.</p>

<p>Several times the heavy log which they had dragged from the river
bank was carried stealthily up to within a few feet of the building,
when, having located the door, they ran forward with the battering
ram. Delivering the blow they dropped the log and scampered to
escape the shots which were sent after them in the darkness.</p>

<p>Now and then some of these bullets found their mark, and the
assailants learned to their cost that it was not simple amusement
on which they were engaged.</p>

<p>Believing they had made some impression on the door, eight Wyandots
stole forward, lifted the tree-trunk from the ground, and stepped
heavily and quietly backward several paces, where they paused
to gather breath for the fierce rush.</p>

<p>At the very moment they had concentrated their strength and were
in the act of moving, a flaming arrow sped upward like a rocket
from the other side the clearing, and, curving over, went a short
distance beyond the block-house, and, by a singular mischance,
buried its head in the log, which was held above the ground and
in the act of being plunged against the door.</p>

<p>The shaft stuck and the flaming twist of tow gave partial glimpses
of the eight swarthy figures laboring toward the building with
the timber between the two divisions. The knowledge that they
were exposed to the aim of the Kentuckians, spread consternation
among the Wyandots, who released the burden so suddenly that it
fell upon one warrior's foot.</p>

<p>The pain was so acute that, like a civilized being, he caught
the injured member in both hands and danced round and round on
the other foot, howling with torture, while the others skurried
away in the darkness, as though a bomb-shell had burst among them.</p>

<p>The crack of several well-aimed rifles hastened the steps of
these frightened warriors, and he who was nursing his bruised
foot dropped it and limped off, with a haste that would have been
impossible under other circumstances.</p>

<p>This incident, which was not without its element of comedy, was
followed by a still more singular one.</p>

<p>Despite the vigilance of the garrison, the Wyandots were constantly
tempted to efforts which, it would seem, promised no success at
all, and which exposed them to great danger from the rifles of
the Kentuckians.</p>

<p>We have described the windows on the lower story of the block-house,
which were without panes, long and so narrow that it was not deemed
possible that any person could force his body through.</p>

<p>And yet there was one warrior who had probably spent most of
the day in considering the matter, and who concluded there was
a chance for him to succeed, where all others had failed.</p>

<p>A peculiar noise on the lower floor led Colonel Preston to descend
the ladder to investigate. For some minutes he was unable to conjecture
what the disturbance could mean, but the faint glow thrown out
by the flaming arrow which drove its head into the log, showed
that the window at the right of the front door was blocked up
by an Indian, who was wedged fast, and unable to get in or out.</p>

<p>He was struggling desperately, but could not extricate himself,
and the astounded commandant concluded that, if he was attenuated
enough to enter that far, he was probably capable of going still
further, and must be a curiosity in the way of bulk which was
worth seeing.</p>

<p>The Colonel shuddered to think what would have been the result
if this savage had secured an entrance. It would have taken him
but a minute or two to remove the fastenings of the door, when
the whole horde of ferocious red men would have swarmed in.</p>

<p>The officer immediately ran forward and, catching the two arms
of the intruder, pinioned them. Then he began pulling with might
and main. That he might not throw away any strength, he placed
both feet against the logs below the window, and, leaning back,
threw all his energy in the effort.</p>

<p>So great was the force exerted that in all likelihood he would
have succeeded in drawing the exceedingly thin warrior through
the window, had not a couple of friends, at the same moment, seized
his legs, which were frantically beating vacancy, and commenced
pulling with equal ardor in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>The Wyandot was now as anxious to retreat as he had been to advance,
and he strove to help his friends; but his efforts were so handicapped
that he gave them little if any assistance.</p>

<p>The arrow which had burned so brightly for a minute or two expired,
so that all was darkness once more, and the singular tug of war
went on.</p>

<p>When Colonel Preston held his breath, compressed his lips and
did his utmost, he felt the Indian move forward several inches
in response; but there were a couple fully as muscular, and inspired
by as strong enthusiasm as the pioneer. The tug which they put
forth brought the brave back again, with probably a slight gain.</p>

<p>The warriors at the heels had the additional advantage of the
sympathies of the one over whom they were disputing, and who bid
fair to become elongated to an alarming extent by this singular
controversy. He kept twisting his hands in such a way that he
broke the hold of Colonel Preston more than once, while he quieted
his legs so as to favor his friends all he could.</p>

<p>The first flirt which the Indian made was so sudden and unexpected
that the Colonel fell backwards on the floor; but he was up on
the instant, and grappled the sinewy arms again.</p>

<p>"If this keeps on much longer," thought the officer, "something
must give way. Suppose we should pull the rascal in two, with
half inside and half out. That might be fair to us, but the Indian,
considered strictly as an Indian, would not be of much account.
I wonder whether&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Hello, Colonel, what's going on?"</p>

<p>Jo Stinger had heard the singular disturbance, and, unable to
guess its meaning, was hurrying down the ladder to inform himself.</p>

<p>The exquisite absurdity of the situation caused a momentary reaction
from the gloom which had oppressed Colonel Preston, and led him
to reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"I've got a red man here that we're using as a cross-cut saw,
and we've stretched him out to almost double&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant the individual referred to, knowing that all
depended on one supreme effort, wrenched his wrists loose and,
like a flash, struck the Colonel such a blow in the face that
he reeled backwards almost to the other side the room.</p>

<p>The Wyandots at the other end of the line were reinforced at
the critical juncture by two others, who caught hold of their
man wherever it was the most convenient, and the four gave a long
pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, that was sure to accomplish
something definite.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the elongated Indian his legs were equal to the
strain, and he shot backward through the opening like the lady
in the show, who is fired from the giant cannon by the aid of
springs alone. He and his friends rolled over in one promiscuous
heap, but were quickly on their feet and skurried away in a twinkling.</p>

<p>Jo Stinger scarcely credited the singular story when the Colonel
related it, but when the particulars were given, he could not
refuse to believe.</p>

<p>"You could have ended it, Colonel, when you had his head inside,"
said the scout.</p>

<p>"I know that, but I did not like the thought of taking such a
frightful disadvantage of an enemy."</p>

<p>"Then you ought to have done it without thinking," muttered Jo,
who was beginning to feel less mercy toward the Wyandots, since
they had made their own furious hatred so manifest.</p>

<p>"If there's any likelihood of that varmint trying the thing over
again, I'd stay here; but a chap who goes through, or tries to
go through what he did, is apt to get enough."</p>

<p>"I am sure of that," assented Colonel Preston, who was still
rubbing his face where the vigorous blow had fallen upon it.</p>

<p>There was no occasion to remain below-stairs, and the two went
up the ladder, where a consultation was held as to what was best
to do, if indeed they could do anything in their perilous situation.</p>

<p>Midnight had passed, and a hope was gaining ground that, if they
could hold out until morning, the prospect of beating off the
Wyandots would be improved. The American Indian seems incapable
of doing his best work except in darkness, and another night of
such utter gloom as the present was not likely to come.</p>

<p>It was not known, of course, that Deerfoot had escaped from his
enemies, and the belief was general that his career had been brought
to an untimely end; but, as we have shown, the young Shawanoe,
with all his fleetness, could not bring reinforcements from Wild
Oaks before the succeeding night, and it would have been a great
feat could he accomplish it in that limited time.</p>

<p>The garrison had enough food to last them a week, and the supply
of water was sufficient for the same time, unless too many draughts
should be required by the work of the torch and burning arrows.</p>

<p>A continuous assault upon the door and the frequent firing into
the loopholes and windows promised something, but the danger and
delay which attended such work were too great for the red men,
who knew the value of time as well as did the settlers themselves.</p>

<p>All within noted the direction and strength of the wind with
an anxiety which cannot be described. The space separating the
block-house and the cabin was so small that a slight gale from
the right quarter was certain to carry the flames from one to
the other. Both parties therefore were watching the indications
with an equal intensity of interest.</p>

<p>Once the wind was just right, but a lull came, as the torch was
about to be applied, and Waughtauk, after recovering from the
terror caused by the appearance of the scout at the window, must
have felt a grim impatience, as he saw the hours steadily slipping
away, with no marked change in the situation.</p>

<p>But the fiery arrows had done excellently well, although at the
critical moment a wet blanket, in the full sense of the word,
was thrown upon the prospects of the assailants. Waughtauk and
his sharpshooters knew how cleverly they had been outwitted, and
they were sure the strategy could not succeed a second time.</p>

<p>The orders were therefore given to try the blazing missiles again,
and in a few minutes a converging fire was opened, which looked
as if a miniature bombardment had begun.</p>

<p>The pyrotechnic display, under the peculiar circumstances, was
singularly striking.</p>

<p>By and by the missiles found a lodgment on the roof of the block-house,
and the twists of flame once more lit up the rough surface, scorched
and blackened in many places, and on which the flakes, instead
of sliding off, as aforetime, seemed to stick with an unusual
persistency.</p>

<p>There were broad patches of snow over the greater portion, and
although some of the arrows held, yet the major number fell over,
after striking and flickering a few minutes, and went out. The
flakes which had collected now helped blot out the flames.</p>

<p>The cause of these changed conditions was due to a number of
saturated blankets that had been carefully spread over the roof.
During the darkness which followed Jo Stinger's exploit, and after
Colonel Preston's failure to win in his tug of war with the Wyandot,
the garrison had wisely improved the time by soaking quilts with
water and laying them over the most ignitable portion of the roof.</p>

<p>Men and boys had given up those appropriated to their use; indeed
all had been taken, except those which protected the little girls
while sleeping. The mother offered those, if needed, willing to
enfold and warm her little ones with her own loving arms, and
such few extra garments as could be gathered among the company;
but the scout declined, saying he had all he could use. At the
same time he would have given anything in his possession for enough
material to plaster the entire surface.</p>

<p>Favored by the sheltering darkness, Jo then stretched these coverings
over the slabs. He fastened them together and balanced them over
the ridge, so there was no possibility of their slipping off.</p>

<p>This was done with such care that no space was lost. The temperature
was so low that in a few minutes the blankets were stiff with
frost, and, although the hunter was toughened by many years' exposure,
his hands became so benumbed he could hardly use them.</p>

<p>It was these frosty blankets which caught the snow and held it,
and which rendered useless so many of the burning shafts discharged
by the Wyandots.</p>

<p>But there were spaces where the seasoned wood was exposed. Several
of the blazing missiles, as might have been expected, lodged there
and began burning their way into the timber.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as these flames lit up the gloom, the Wyandots,
eagerly looking upon the scene from every point of the compass,
saw a sight which must have amazed them: it was the figure of
a man stretched out at full length on the roof, holding on with
one hand, while the other seemed to be occupied in giving the
finishing touches to the saturated goods, which, so far as they
went, were an effective shield against the fire.</p>

<p>Was ever such reckless daring known? It looked as if the scout
Jo Stinger deliberately invited this manner of his taking off,
in preference to torture by flame, or at the hands of his dusky
enemies.</p>

<p>If such were the fact, the Wyandots did not restrain their fire.
Every one who commanded the position immediately opened upon the
poor fellow, and the sharpshooters in the cabin near at hand discharged
their pieces with unerring accuracy.</p>

<p>Bullet after bullet struck the figure which, as it lay at full
length, was a fair target for the many rifles. Still he held on
and made no effort to lift the trap-door and drop beyond range
of the deadly sleet hurtling about him.</p>

<p>But there is a limit to the capacity of the strongest, and all
at once the hold was loosened. He seemed to catch vainly at the
steep roof, over which he began slipping; but there was nothing
which he could grasp that would stay his downward flight. Faster
and faster he went, until he shot over the eaves, and, striking
the ground, collapsed in a limp heap in which there was not a
particle of life.</p>

<p>The Wyandots, with whoops of delight, dashed forward from the
darkness, each eager to be the first to scalp the man whom they
well knew, and regarded as the most formidable member of the garrison.</p>

<p>Forgetful of the risk they ran (for the spot where the inanimate
figure fell was revealed by the burning arrows), the warriors
scrambled with each other as to who should secure the coveted
trophy.</p>

<p>Scarcely a full minute had passed when cries of rage and chagrin
were heard from the disappointed group: for that which they seized
and struck at was not a man at all, but a dummy cunningly put
together, and placed in such a position on the top of the block-house
that not a Wyandot who fired at it had the slightest suspicion
that he was throwing his ammunition away.</p>
