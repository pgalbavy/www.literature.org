<p>FOR a long time Daddy Longlegs lay inside the hollow, fallen tree and
looked out upon the wind-swept fields. If the stone wall hadn't been so
far away he would certainly have tried to return home. But the weather
was altogether too dangerous. He knew it would be risky to attempt so
long a journey.
</p>
<p>As he sat looking out of the chink in the old tree, through which he had
crept inside it, Daddy suddenly saw a reddish, brownish flash flicker
past the opening.
</p><p>"Goodness!" he exclaimed. "I wonder what that was!" And in another
moment the same bright patch of color again whisked across the hole.
</p><p>Then Daddy Longlegs heard a sound as of some one scratching upon the
tree-trunk. And being of a very curious nature, he crawled half through
the hole and peered out to see what was happening. Daddy Longlegs was
all ready for a fright. He was so upset, on account of being caught away
from home on a windy day, that he was unusually jumpy and fidgety.
But--as it often happens at such times--he met with a pleasant surprise.
For there sat Sandy Chipmunk, with his long tail curled over his back,
and something very like a smile on his bright face.
</p><p>Knowing that Sandy Chipmunk never harmed anybody that minded his own
affairs, Daddy Longlegs spoke to him at once.
</p><p>"It's a bad day, isn't it?" he called.
</p><p>Hearing that tiny voice, which seemed to come from inside the fallen
tree, Sandy Chipmunk was so startled that he leaped high into the air;
and when he came down again upon all fours he found himself staring
straight into Daddy Longlegs' beady eyes.
</p><p>"Oh! It's you, eh?" cried Sandy Chipmunk. And he looked decidedly
foolish, because he knew that he had no reason to fear anybody as mild
as Daddy Longlegs.
</p><p>"It's a bad day, isn't it!" said Daddy Longlegs once more.
</p><p>"I'm sorry I can't agree with you," Sandy replied. "I think it's the
finest weather that ever was."
</p><p>"You don't mean to say you like this wind?" Daddy Longlegs cried. "Why,
I don't see how you dare to be out in it!"
</p><p>"Oh, it's nothing when you're used to it," Sandy Chipmunk answered
lightly.
</p><p>"I shall never get used to the wind, I'm afraid," Daddy told him sadly.
"It blows me about so terribly." And he went on to explain how he had
started on a long journey the day before, and how he didn't dare go
on--nor turn around and go home, either.
</p><p>"Well, well!" Sandy Chipmunk exclaimed. "You seem to be in a fix. But
why don't you <u>ride</u> home?"
</p><p>"Ride?" Daddy Longlegs shrilled. "On what, I should like to know?"
</p><p>"On Farmer Green's wagon!" Sandy told him promptly. "I happen to know
that Johnnie Green and his grandmother drove to the miller's this
morning to have a sack of wheat ground into flour. And they'll be coming
back home this afternoon."
