<p>Nimble Deer had stopped at Brownie Beaver's pond to get a drink. Just as
he raised his head from the water he spied Brownie a little way off, on
the bank, gnawing at a box alder tree.
</p>
<p>"Good evening!" Nimble called to him.
</p><p>"Good evening!" Brownie Beaver answered.
</p><p>"I see you're busy, as usual," Nimble remarked.
</p><p>"Yes!" Brownie replied. "And what are you doing--if I may ask?"
</p><p>"Oh! I'm just rambling about," Nimble explained.
</p><p>"Then you're not doing much of anything," said Brownie Beaver.
</p><p>Nimble admitted that he wasn't.
</p><p>"Since you're not working, perhaps you'll be willing to help me,"
Brownie suggested.
</p><p>"Certainly!" Nimble cried. He liked Brownie Beaver. Everybody liked
him--unless it was Timothy Turtle, who had a grudge against the whole
Beaver tribe.
</p><p>"Maybe I can make arrangements with you to----" Brownie began.
</p><p>"Of course you can!" Nimble interrupted.
</p><p>"That's very kind of you," Brownie said. "I'm sure I'm much obliged to
you."
</p><p>"You're quite welcome," Nimble assured him.
</p><p>"You're sure you won't mind!" Brownie Beaver inquired.
</p><p>"Not at all! No, indeed! What is it you want me to do for you? Do you
want me to help you roll a log into the water, when you've finished
cutting down that tree? I might use my horns for a cant hook, such as
the lumbermen have."
</p><p>"No! It's not that--thank you!" Brownie Beaver mumbled. He had not
stopped working, while he talked. And having some chips in his mouth he
did not speak any too clearly.
</p><p>"Maybe you'd like me to walk back and forth along the top of your dam
and make it firmer," Nimble suggested.
</p><p>"No, it's not that," Brownie told him. "The dam is firm. It has been
here a great many years, ever since my great-great-grandfather's
time.... You've noticed my house, I dare say," he went on.
</p><p>"I have," Nimble answered. "It's a good one, though the chimney looks a
bit lopsided, to me. Shall I give it a push and see if I can straighten
it?"
</p><p>"No, indeed--thank you!" said Brownie hurriedly. "For mercy's sake,
don't touch my chimney! I worked a long time to make it. And if I do say
so, it's the best one in the whole village."
</p><p>Well, Nimble Deer couldn't guess what it was that Brownie Beaver wanted
him to do. He couldn't think of any other way in which he might help.
</p><p>"Then what--" he demanded--"what is it you want?"
</p><p>"There's something I need for my house," Brownie explained.
</p><p>"Shingles!" Nimble cried.
</p><p>"No!" Brownie said, as he shook his head.
</p><p>"I hope you don't want a pair of antlers to fasten over your chimney
piece!" Nimble exclaimed. "I shouldn't care to part with my
antlers--not just at present!"
</p><p>"No!" Brownie said once more.
</p><p>"I'm glad of that," Nimble replied. For a moment he had been worried.
</p><p>And then Brownie Beaver told him what he had in mind: "I need a flag to
fly over my house."
</p><p>"That would be fine," Nimble observed. "But I don't see how I could help
you with that."
</p><p>"I've heard that you have a flag. I thought perhaps you'd let me have
it--or borrow it, at least," Brownie Beaver told him.
</p><p>Nimble Deer looked puzzled.
</p><p>"I haven't any flag," he said. And then he cried, "Yes! Yes, I have
one!"
</p><p>"Ah! I was told you had," said Brownie Beaver.
</p><p>"Who told you?"
</p><p>"Old Mr. Crow!" Brownie Beaver said.
</p><p>"I might have known it," Nimble muttered. "He has played a joke on you.
It's true that I have a flag; but it's not the kind of flag you want.
Some people call my tail a flag, on account of the way I wave it in the
air when I'm startled. Of course you wouldn't care to have my tail on
the top of your house."
</p><p>And Brownie Beaver admitted that he shouldn't.
</p><p>"But I can't help being disappointed," he confessed.
