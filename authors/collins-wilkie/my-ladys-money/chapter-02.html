<P>
ROBERT MOODY was at this time nearly forty years of age. He was a
shy, quiet, dark person, with a pale, closely-shav en face,
agreeably animated by large black eyes, set deep in their orbits.
His mouth was perhaps his best feature; he had firm, well-shaped
lips, which softened on rare occasions into a particularly
winning smile. The whole look of the man, in spite of his
habitual reserve, declared him to be eminently trustworthy. His
position in Lady Lydiard's household was in no sense of the
menial sort. He acted as her almoner and secretary as well as her
steward--distributed her charities, wrote her letters on
business, paid her bills, engaged her servants, stocked her
wine-cellar, was authorized to borrow books from her library, and
was served with his meals in his own room. His parentage gave him
claims to these special favors; he was by birth entitled to rank
as a gentleman. His father had failed at a time of commercial
panic as a country banker, had paid a good dividend, and had died
in exile abroad a broken-hearted man. Robert had tried to hold
his place in the world, but adverse fortune kept him down.
Undeserved disaster followed him from one employment to another,
until he abandoned the struggle, bade a last farewell to the
pride of other days, and accepted the position considerately and
delicately offered to him in Lady Lydiard's house. He had now no
near relations living, and he had never made many friends. In the
intervals of occupation he led a lonely life in his little room.
It was a matter of secret wonder among the women in the servants'
hall, considering his personal advantages and the opportunities
which must surely have been thrown in his way, that he had never
tempted fortune in the character of a married man. Robert Moody
entered into no explanations on that subject. In his own sad and
quiet way he continued to lead his own sad and quiet life. The
women all failing, from the handsome housekeeper downward, to
make the smallest impression on him, consoled themselves by
prophetic visions of his future relations with the sex, and
predicted vindictively that "his time would come."
<P>
"Well," said Lady Lydiard, "and what have you done?"
<P>
"Your Ladyship seemed to be anxious about the dog," Moody
answered, in the low tone which was habitual to him. "I went
first to the veterinary surgeon. He had been called away into the
country; and--"
<P>
Lady Lydiard waved away the conclusion of the sentence with her
hand. "Never mind the surgeon. We must find somebody else. Where
did you go next?"
<P>
"To your Ladyship"s lawyer. Mr. Troy wished me to say that he
will have the honor of waiting on you--"
<P>
"Pass over the lawyer, Moody. I want to know about the painter's
widow. Is it true that Mrs. Tollmidge and her family are left in
helpless poverty?"
<P>
"Not quite true, my Lady. I have seen the clergyman of the
parish, who takes an interest in the case--"
<P>
Lady Lydiard interrupted her steward for the third time. "Did you
mention my name?" she asked sharply.
<P>
"Certainly not, my Lady. I followed my instructions, and
described you as a benevolent person in search of cases of real
distress. It is quite true that Mr. Tollmidge has died, leaving
nothing to his family. But the widow has a little income of
seventy pounds in her own right."
<P>
"Is that enough to live on, Moody?" her Ladyship asked.
<P>
"Enough, in this case, for the widow and her daughter," Moody
answered. "The difficulty is to pay the few debts left standing,
and to start the two sons in life. They are reported to be steady
lads; and the family is much respected in the neighborhood. The
clergyman proposes to get a few influential names to begin with,
and to start a subscription."
<P>
"No subscription!" protested Lady Lydiard. "Mr. Tollmidge was
Lord Lydiard's cousin; and Mrs. Tollmidge is related to his
Lordship by marriage. It would be degrading to my husband's
memory to have the begging-box sent round for his relations, no
matter how distant they may be. Cousins!" exclaimed her Ladyship,
suddenly descending from the lofty ranges of sentiment to the
low. "I hate the very name of them! A person who is near enough
to me to be my relation and far enough off from me to be my
sweetheart, is a double-faced sort of person that I don't like.
Let's get back to the widow and her sons. How much do they want?"
<P>
"A subscription of five hundred pounds, my Lady, would provide
for everything--if it could only be collected."
<P>
"It _shall_ be collected, Moody! I will pay the subscription out
of my own purse." Having asserted herself in those noble terms,
she spoilt the effect of her own outburst of generosity by
dropping to the sordid view of the subject in her next sentence.
"Five hundred pounds is a good bit of money, though; isn't it,
Moody?"
<P>
"It is, indeed, my Lady." Rich and generous as he knew his
mistress to be, her proposal to pay the whole subscription took
the steward by surprise. Lady Lydiard's quick perception
instantly detected what was passing in his mind.
<P>
"You don't quite understand my position in this matter," she
said. "When I read the newspaper notice of Mr. Tollmidge's death,
I searched among his Lordship's papers to see if they really were
related. I discovered some letters from Mr. Tollmidge, which
showed me that he and Lord Lydiard were cousins. One of those
letters contains some very painful statements, reflecting most
untruly and unjustly on my conduct; lies, in short," her Ladyship
burst out, losing her dignity, as usual. "Lies, Moody, for which
Mr. Tollmidge deserved to be horsewhipped. I would have done it
myself if his Lordship had told me at the time. No matter; it's
useless to dwell on the thing now," she continued, ascending
again to the forms of expression which became a lady of rank.
"This unhappy man has done me a gross injustice; my motives may
be seriously misjudged, if I appear personally in communicating
with his family. If I relieve them anonymously in their present
trouble, I spare them the exposure of a public subscription, and
I do what I believe his Lordship would have done himself if he
had lived. My desk is on the other table. Bring it here, Moody;
and let me return good for evil, while I'm in the humor for it!"
<P>
Moody obeyed in silence. Lady Lydiard wrote a check.
<P>
"Take that to the banker's, and bring back a five-hundred pound
note," she said. "I'll inclose it to the clergyman as coming from
'an unknown friend.' And be quick about it. I am only a fallible
mortal, Moody. Don't leave me time enough to take the stingy view
of five hundred pounds."
<P>
Moody went out with the check. No delay was to be apprehended in
obtaining the money; the banking-house was hard by, in St.
James's Street. Left alone, Lady Lydiard decided on occupying her
mind in the generous direction by composing her anonymous letter
to the clergyman. She had just taken a sheet of note-paper from
her desk, when a servant appeared at the door announcing a
visitor--
<P>
"Mr. Felix Sweetsir!"
