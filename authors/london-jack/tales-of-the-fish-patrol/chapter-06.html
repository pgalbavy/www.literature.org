<P>
It must not be thought, from what I have told of the Greek
fishermen, that they were altogether bad.  Far from it.  But they
were rough men, gathered together in isolated communities and
fighting with the elements for a livelihood.  They lived far away
from the law and its workings, did not understand it, and thought
it tyranny.  Especially did the fish laws seem tyrannical.  And
because of this, they looked upon the men of the fish patrol as
their natural enemies.
<P>
We menaced their lives, or their living, which is the same thing,
in many ways.  We confiscated illegal traps and nets, the materials
of which had cost them considerable sums and the making of which
required weeks of labor.  We prevented them from catching fish at
many times and seasons, which was equivalent to preventing them
from making as good a living as they might have made had we not
been in existence.  And when we captured them, they were brought
into the courts of law, where heavy cash fines were collected from
them.  As a result, they hated us vindictively.  As the dog is the
natural enemy of the cat, the snake of man, so were we of the fish
patrol the natural enemies of the fishermen.
<P>
But it is to show that they could act generously as well as hate
bitterly that this story of Demetrios Contos is told.  Demetrios
Contos lived in Vallejo.  Next to Big Alec, he was the largest,
bravest, and most influential man among the Greeks.  He had given
us no trouble, and I doubt if he would ever have clashed with us
had he not invested in a new salmon boat.  This boat was the cause
of all the trouble.  He had had it built upon his own model, in
which the lines of the general salmon boat were somewhat modified.
<P>
To his high elation he found his new boat very fast - in fact,
faster than any other boat on the bay or rivers.  Forthwith he grew
proud and boastful:  and, our raid with the Mary Rebecca on the
Sunday salmon fishers having wrought fear in their hearts, he sent
a challenge up to Benicia.  One of the local fishermen conveyed it
to us; it was to the effect that Demetrios Contos would sail up
from Vallejo on the following Sunday, and in the plain sight of
Benicia set his net and catch salmon, and that Charley Le Grant,
patrolman, might come and get him if he could.  Of course Charley
and I had heard nothing of the new boat.  Our own boat was pretty
fast, and we were not afraid to have a brush with any other that
happened along.
<P>
Sunday came.  The challenge had been bruited abroad, and the
fishermen and seafaring folk of Benicia turned out to a man,
crowding Steamboat Wharf till it looked like the grand stand at a
football match.  Charley and I had been sceptical, but the fact of
the crowd convinced us that there was something in Demetrios
Contos's dare.
<P>
In the afternoon, when the sea-breeze had picked up in strength,
his sail hove into view as he bowled along before the wind.  He
tacked a score of feet from the wharf, waved his hand theatrically,
like a knight about to enter the lists, received a hearty cheer in
return, and stood away into the Straits for a couple of hundred
yards.  Then he lowered sail, and, drifting the boat sidewise by
means of the wind, proceeded to set his net.  He did not set much
of it, possibly fifty feet; yet Charley and I were thunderstruck at
the man's effrontery.  We did not know at the time, but we learned
afterward, that the net he used was old and worthless.  It could
catch fish, true; but a catch of any size would have torn it to
pieces.
<P>
Charley shook his head and said:
<P>
"I confess, it puzzles me.  What if he has out only fifty feet?  He
could never get it in if we once started for him.  And why does he
come here anyway, flaunting his law-breaking in our faces?  Right
in our home town, too."
<P>
Charley's voice took on an aggrieved tone, and he continued for
some minutes to inveigh against the brazenness of Demetrios Contos.
<P>
In the meantime, the man in question was lolling in the stern of
his boat and watching the net floats.  When a large fish is meshed
in a gill-net, the floats by their agitation advertise the fact.
And they evidently advertised it to Demetrios, for he pulled in
about a dozen feet of net, and held aloft for a moment, before he
flung it into the bottom of the boat, a big, glistening salmon.  It
was greeted by the audience on the wharf with round after round of
cheers.  This was more than Charley could stand.
<P>
"Come on, lad," he called to me; and we lost no time jumping into
our salmon boat and getting up sail.
<P>
The crowd shouted warning to Demetrios, and as we darted out from
the wharf we saw him slash his worthless net clear with a long
knife.  His sail was all ready to go up, and a moment later it
fluttered in the sunshine.  He ran aft, drew in the sheet, and
filled on the long tack toward the Contra Costa Hills.
<P>
By this time we were not more than thirty feet astern.  Charley was
jubilant.  He knew our boat was fast, and he knew, further, that in
fine sailing few men were his equals.  He was confident that we
should surely catch Demetrios, and I shared his confidence.  But
somehow we did not seem to gain.
<P>
It was a pretty sailing breeze.  We were gliding sleekly through
the water, but Demetrios was slowly sliding away from us.  And not
only was he going faster, but he was eating into the wind a
fraction of a point closer than we.  This was sharply impressed
upon us when he went about under the Contra Costa Hills and passed
us on the other tack fully one hundred feet dead to windward.
<P>
"Whew!" Charley exclaimed.  "Either that boat is a daisy, or we've
got a five-gallon coal-oil can fast to our keel!"
<P>
It certainly looked it one way or the other.  And by the time
Demetrios made the Sonoma Hills, on the other side of the Straits,
we were so hopelessly outdistanced that Charley told me to slack
off the sheet, and we squared away for Benicia.  The fishermen on
Steamboat Wharf showered us with ridicule when we returned and tied
up.  Charley and I got out and walked away, feeling rather
sheepish, for it is a sore stroke to one's pride when he thinks he
has a good boat and knows how to sail it, and another man comes
along and beats him.
<P>
Charley mooned over it for a couple of days; then word was brought
to us, as before, that on the next Sunday Demetrios Contos would
repeat his performance.  Charley roused himself.  He had our boat
out of the water, cleaned and repainted its bottom, made a trifling
alteration about the centre-board, overhauled the running gear, and
sat up nearly all of Saturday night sewing on a new and much larger
sail.  So large did he make it, in fact, that additional ballast
was imperative, and we stowed away nearly five hundred extra pounds
of old railroad iron in the bottom of the boat.
<P>
Sunday came, and with it came Demetrios Contos, to break the law
defiantly in open day.  Again we had the afternoon sea-breeze, and
again Demetrios cut loose some forty or more feet of his rotten
net, and got up sail and under way under our very noses.  But he
had anticipated Charley's move, and his own sail peaked higher than
ever, while a whole extra cloth had been added to the after leech.
<P>
It was nip and tuck across to the Contra Costa Hills, neither of us
seeming to gain or to lose.  But by the time we had made the return
tack to the Sonoma Hills, we could see that, while we footed it at
about equal speed, Demetrios had eaten into the wind the least bit
more than we.  Yet Charley was sailing our boat as finely and
delicately as it was possible to sail it, and getting more out of
it than he ever had before.
<P>
Of course, he could have drawn his revolver and fired at Demetrios;
but we had long since found it contrary to our natures to shoot at
a fleeing man guilty of only a petty offence.  Also a sort of tacit
agreement seemed to have been reached between the patrolmen and the
fishermen.  If we did not shoot while they ran away, they, in turn,
did not fight if we once laid hands on them.  Thus Demetrios Contos
ran away from us, and we did no more than try our best to overtake
him; and, in turn, if our boat proved faster than his, or was
sailed better, he would, we knew, make no resistance when we caught
up with him.
<P>
With our large sails and the healthy breeze romping up the
Carquinez Straits, we found that our sailing was what is called
"ticklish."  We had to be constantly on the alert to avoid a
capsize, and while Charley steered I held the main-sheet in my hand
with but a single turn round a pin, ready to let go at any moment.
Demetrios, we could see, sailing his boat alone, had his hands
full.
<P>
But it was a vain undertaking for us to attempt to catch him.  Out
of his inner consciousness he had evolved a boat that was better
than ours.  And though Charley sailed fully as well, if not the
least bit better, the boat he sailed was not so good as the
Greek's.
<P>
"Slack away the sheet," Charley commanded; and as our boat fell off
before the wind, Demetrios's mocking laugh floated down to us.
<P>
Charley shook his head, saying, "It's no use.  Demetrios has the
better boat.  If he tries his performance again, we must meet it
with some new scheme."
<P>
This time it was my imagination that came to the rescue.
<P>
"What's the matter," I suggested, on the Wednesday following, "with
my chasing Demetrios in the boat next Sunday, while you wait for
him on the wharf at Vallejo when he arrives?"
<P>
Charley considered it a moment and slapped his knee.
<P>
"A good idea!  You're beginning to use that head of yours.  A
credit to your teacher, I must say."
<P>
"But you mustn't chase him too far," he went on, the next moment,
"or he'll head out into San Pablo Bay instead of running home to
Vallejo, and there I'll be, standing lonely on the wharf and
waiting in vain for him to arrive."
<P>
On Thursday Charley registered an objection to my plan.
<P>
"Everybody'll know I've gone to Vallejo, and you can depend upon it
that Demetrios will know, too.  I'm afraid we'll have to give up
the idea."
<P>
This objection was only too valid, and for the rest of the day I
struggled under my disappointment.  But that night a new way seemed
to open to me, and in my eagerness I awoke Charley from a sound
sleep.
<P>
"Well," he grunted, "what's the matter?  House afire?"
<P>
"No," I replied, "but my head is.  Listen to this.  On Sunday you
and I will be around Benicia up to the very moment Demetrios's sail
heaves into sight.  This will lull everybody's suspicions.  Then,
when Demetrios's sail does heave in sight, do you stroll leisurely
away and up-town.  All the fishermen will think you're beaten and
that you know you're beaten."
<P>
"So far, so good," Charley commented, while I paused to catch
breath.
<P>
"And very good indeed," I continued proudly.  "You stroll
carelessly up-town, but when you're once out of sight you leg it
for all you're worth for Dan Maloney's.  Take the little mare of
his, and strike out on the country road for Vallejo.  The road's in
fine condition, and you can make it in quicker time than Demetrios
can beat all the way down against the wind."
<P>
"And I'll arrange right away for the mare, first thing in the
morning," Charley said, accepting the modified plan without
hesitation.
<P>
"But, I say," he said, a little later, this time waking me out of a
sound sleep.
<P>
I could hear him chuckling in the dark.
<P>
"I say, lad, isn't it rather a novelty for the fish patrol to be
taking to horseback?"
<P>
"Imagination," I answered.  "It's what you're always preaching -
'keep thinking one thought ahead of the other fellow, and you're
bound to win out.'"
<P>
"He! he!" he chuckled.  "And if one thought ahead, including a
mare, doesn't take the other fellow's breath away this time, I'm
not your humble servant, Charley Le Grant."
<P>
"But can you manage the boat alone?" he asked, on Friday.
"Remember, we've a ripping big sail on her."
<P>
I argued my proficiency so well that he did not refer to the matter
again till Saturday, when he suggested removing one whole cloth
from the after leech.  I guess it was the disappointment written on
my face that made him desist; for I, also, had a pride in my boat-
sailing abilities, and I was almost wild to get out alone with the
big sail and go tearing down the Carquinez Straits in the wake of
the flying Greek.
<P>
As usual, Sunday and Demetrios Contos arrived together.  It had
become the regular thing for the fishermen to assemble on Steamboat
Wharf to greet his arrival and to laugh at our discomfiture.  He
lowered sail a couple of hundred yards out and set his customary
fifty feet of rotten net.
<P>
"I suppose this nonsense will keep up as long as his old net holds
out," Charley grumbled, with intention, in the hearing of several
of the Greeks.
<P>
"Den I give-a heem my old-a net-a," one of them spoke up, promptly
and maliciously,
<P>
"I don't care," Charley answered.  "I've got some old net myself he
can have - if he'll come around and ask for it."
<P>
They all laughed at this, for they could afford to be sweet-
tempered with a man so badly outwitted as Charley was.
<P>
"Well, so long, lad," Charley called to me a moment later.  "I
think I'll go up-town to Maloney's."
<P>
"Let me take the boat out?" I asked.
<P>
"If you want to," was his answer, as he turned on his heel and
walked slowly away.
<P>
Demetrios pulled two large salmon out of his net, and I jumped into
the boat.  The fishermen crowded around in a spirit of fun, and
when I started to get up sail overwhelmed me with all sorts of
jocular advice.  They even offered extravagant bets to one another
that I would surely catch Demetrios, and two of them, styling
themselves the committee of judges, gravely asked permission to
come along with me to see how I did it.
<P>
But I was in no hurry.  I waited to give Charley all the time I
could, and I pretended dissatisfaction with the stretch of the sail
and slightly shifted the small tackle by which the huge sprit
forces up the peak.  It was not until I was sure that Charley had
reached Dan Maloney's and was on the little mare's back, that I
cast off from the wharf and gave the big sail to the wind.  A stout
puff filled it and suddenly pressed the lee gunwale down till a
couple of buckets of water came inboard.  A little thing like this
will happen to the best small-boat sailors, and yet, though I
instantly let go the sheet and righted, I was cheered
sarcastically, as though I had been guilty of a very awkward
blunder.
<P>
When Demetrios saw only one person in the fish patrol boat, and
that one a boy, he proceeded to play with me.  Making a short tack
out, with me not thirty feet behind, he returned, with his sheet a
little free, to Steamboat Wharf.  And there he made short tacks,
and turned and twisted and ducked around, to the great delight of
his sympathetic audience.  I was right behind him all the time, and
I dared to do whatever he did, even when he squared away before the
wind and jibed his big sail over - a most dangerous trick with such
a sail in such a wind.
<P>
He depended upon the brisk sea breeze and the strong ebb-tide,
which together kicked up a nasty sea, to bring me to grief.  But I
was on my mettle, and never in all my life did I sail a boat better
than on that day.  I was keyed up to concert pitch, my brain was
working smoothly and quickly, my hands never fumbled once, and it
seemed that I almost divined the thousand little things which a
small-boat sailor must be taking into consideration every second.
<P>
It was Demetrios who came to grief instead.  Something went wrong
with his centre-board, so that it jammed in the case and would not
go all the way down.  In a moment's breathing space, which he had
gained from me by a clever trick, I saw him working impatiently
with the centre-board, trying to force it down.  I gave him little
time, and he was compelled quickly to return to the tiller and
sheet.
<P>
The centre-board made him anxious.  He gave over playing with me,
and started on the long beat to Vallejo.  To my joy, on the first
long tack across, I found that I could eat into the wind just a
little bit closer than he.  Here was where another man in the boat
would have been of value to him; for, with me but a few feet
astern, he did not dare let go the tiller and run amidships to try
to force down the centre-board.
<P>
Unable to hang on as close in the eye of the wind as formerly, he
proceeded to slack his sheet a trifle and to ease off a bit, in
order to outfoot me.  This I permitted him to do till I had worked
to windward, when I bore down upon him.  As I drew close, he
feinted at coming about.  This led me to shoot into the wind to
forestall him.  But it was only a feint, cleverly executed, and he
held back to his course while I hurried to make up lost ground.
<P>
He was undeniably smarter than I when it came to manoeuvring.  Time
after time I all but had him, and each time he tricked me and
escaped.  Besides, the wind was freshening, constantly, and each of
us had his hands full to avoid capsizing.  As for my boat, it could
not have been kept afloat but for the extra ballast.  I sat cocked
over the weather gunwale, tiller in one hand and sheet in the
other; and the sheet, with a single turn around a pin, I was very
often forced to let go in the severer puffs.  This allowed the sail
to spill the wind, which was equivalent to taking off so much
driving power, and of course I lost ground.  My consolation was
that Demetrios was as often compelled to do the same thing.
<P>
The strong ebb-tide, racing down the Straits in the teeth of the
wind, caused an unusually heavy and spiteful sea, which dashed
aboard continually.  I was dripping wet, and even the sail was wet
half-way up the after leech.  Once I did succeed in outmanoeuvring
Demetrios, so that my bow bumped into him amidships.  Here was
where I should have had another man.  Before I could run forward
and leap aboard, he shoved the boats apart with an oar, laughing
mockingly in my face as he did so.
<P>
We were now at the mouth of the Straits, in a bad stretch of water.
Here the Vallejo Straits and the Carquinez Straits rushed directly
at each other.  Through the first flowed all the water of Napa
River and the great tide-lands; through the second flowed all the
water of Suisun Bay and the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.  And
where such immense bodies of water, flowing swiftly, clashed
together, a terrible tide-rip was produced.  To make it worse, the
wind howled up San Pablo Bay for fifteen miles and drove in a
tremendous sea upon the tide-rip.
<P>
Conflicting currents tore about in all directions, colliding,
forming whirlpools, sucks, and boils, and shooting up spitefully
into hollow waves which fell aboard as often from leeward as from
windward.  And through it all, confused, driven into a madness of
motion, thundered the great smoking seas from San Pablo Bay.
<P>
I was as wildly excited as the water.  The boat was behaving
splendidly, leaping and lurching through the welter like a race-
horse.  I could hardly contain myself with the joy of it.  The huge
sail, the howling wind, the driving seas, the plunging boat - I, a
pygmy, a mere speck in the midst of it, was mastering the elemental
strife, flying through it and over it, triumphant and victorious.
<P>
And just then, as I roared along like a conquering hero, the boat
received a frightful smash and came instantly to a dead stop.  I
was flung forward and into the bottom.  As I sprang up I caught a
fleeting glimpse of a greenish, barnacle-covered object, and knew
it at once for what it was, that terror of navigation, a sunken
pile.  No man may guard against such a thing.  Water-logged and
floating just beneath the surface, it was impossible to sight it in
the troubled water in time to escape.
<P>
The whole bow of the boat must have been crushed in, for in a few
seconds the boat was half full.  Then a couple of seas filled it,
and it sank straight down, dragged to bottom by the heavy ballast.
So quickly did it all happen that I was entangled in the sail and
drawn under.  When I fought my way to the surface, suffocating, my
lungs almost bursting, I could see nothing of the oars.  They must
have been swept away by the chaotic currents.  I saw Demetrios
Contos looking back from his boat, and heard the vindictive and
mocking tones of his voice as he shouted exultantly.  He held
steadily on his course, leaving me to perish.
<P>
There was nothing to do but to swim for it, which, in that wild
confusion, was at the best a matter of but a few moments.  Holding
my breath and working with my hands, I managed to get off my heavy
sea-boots and my jacket.  Yet there was very little breath I could
catch to hold, and I swiftly discovered that it was not so much a
matter of swimming as of breathing.
<P>
I was beaten and buffeted, smashed under by the great San Pablo
whitecaps, and strangled by the hollow tide-rip waves which flung
themselves into my eyes, nose, and mouth.  Then the strange sucks
would grip my legs and drag me under, to spout me up in some fierce
boiling, where, even as I tried to catch my breath, a great
whitecap would crash down upon my head.
<P>
It was impossible to survive any length of time.  I was breathing
more water than air, and drowning all the time.  My senses began to
leave me, my head to whirl around.  I struggled on, spasmodically,
instinctively, and was barely half conscious when I felt myself
caught by the shoulders and hauled over the gunwale of a boat.
<P>
For some time I lay across a seat where I had been flung, face
downward, and with the water running out of my mouth.  After a
while, still weak and faint, I turned around to see who was my
rescuer.  And there, in the stern, sheet in one hand and tiller in
the other, grinning and nodding good-naturedly, sat Demetrios
Contos.  He had intended to leave me to drown, - he said so
afterward, - but his better self had fought the battle, conquered,
and sent him back to me.
<P>
"You all-a right?" he asked.
<P>
I managed to shape a "yes" on my lips, though I could not yet
speak.
<P>
"You sail-a de boat verr-a good-a," he said.  "So good-a as a man."
<P>
A compliment from Demetrios Contos was a compliment indeed, and I
keenly appreciated it, though I could only nod my head in
acknowledgment.
<P>
We held no more conversation, for I was busy recovering and he was
busy with the boat.  He ran in to the wharf at Vallejo, made the
boat fast, and helped me out.  Then it was, as we both stood on the
wharf, that Charley stepped out from behind a net-rack and put his
hand on Demetrios Contos's arm.
<P>
"He saved my life, Charley," I protested; "and I don't think he
ought to be arrested."
<P>
A puzzled expression came into Charley's face, which cleared
immediately after, in a way it had when he made up his mind.
<P>
"I can't help it, lad," he said kindly.  "I can't go back on my
duty, and it's plain duty to arrest him.  To-day is Sunday; there
are two salmon in his boat which he caught to-day.  What else can I
do?"
<P>
"But he saved my life," I persisted, unable to make any other
argument.
<P>
Demetrios Contos's face went black with rage when he learned
Charley's judgment.  He had a sense of being unfairly treated.  The
better part of his nature had triumphed, he had performed a
generous act and saved a helpless enemy, and in return the enemy
was taking him to jail.
<P>
Charley and I were out of sorts with each other when we went back
to Benicia.  I stood for the spirit of the law and not the letter;
but by the letter Charley made his stand.  As far as he could see,
there was nothing else for him to do.  The law said distinctly that
no salmon should be caught on Sunday.  He was a patrolman, and it
was his duty to enforce that law.  That was all there was to it.
He had done his duty, and his conscience was clear.  Nevertheless,
the whole thing seemed unjust to me, and I felt very sorry for
Demetrios Contos.
<P>
Two days later we went down to Vallejo to the trial.  I had to go
along as a witness, and it was the most hateful task that I ever
performed in my life when I testified on the witness stand to
seeing Demetrios catch the two salmon Charley had captured him
with.
<P>
Demetrios had engaged a lawyer, but his case was hopeless.  The
jury was out only fifteen minutes, and returned a verdict of
guilty.  The judge sentenced Demetrios to pay a fine of one hundred
dollars or go to jail for fifty days.
<P>
Charley stepped up to the clerk of the court.  "I want to pay that
fine," he said, at the same time placing five twenty-dollar gold
pieces on the desk.  "It - it was the only way out of it, lad," he
stammered, turning to me.
<P>
The moisture rushed into my eyes as I seized his hand.  "I want to
pay - " I began.
<P>
"To pay your half?" he interrupted.  "I certainly shall expect you
to pay it."
<P>
In the meantime Demetrios had been informed by his lawyer that his
fee likewise had been paid by Charley.
<P>
Demetrios came over to shake Charley's hand, and all his warm
Southern blood flamed in his face.  Then, not to be outdone in
generosity, he insisted on paying his fine and lawyer's fee
himself, and flew half-way into a passion because Charley refused
to let him.
<P>
More than anything else we ever did, I think, this action of
Charley's impressed upon the fishermen the deeper significance of
the law.  Also Charley was raised high in their esteem, while I
came in for a little share of praise as a boy who knew how to sail
a boat.  Demetrios Contos not only never broke the law again, but
he became a very good friend of ours, and on more than one occasion
he ran up to Benicia to have a gossip with us.
