<p>When Larry Murphy paddled the canoe beyond reach of the missile
hurled by the enraged owner of the craft, the boys were warranted
in believing that they were done with him. He was eliminated from
the problem, so to speak.</p>

<p>But the singular creature was not done with them. The discharge
of the gun startled him almost into spasms, and, as we have shown,
he made haste to bound in among the shadows of the trees; but
the belief that the youths were in the act of stealing his boat
filled him with consuming rage. He threw another stone with might
and main, and, though the feat was an astonishing one, he saw
that it accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>He watched the canoe until it vanished under the shadow of the
opposite shore. He could not know the intentions of the thieves,
but it did not take him long to decide on his own.</p>

<p>Emerging from among the trees, where the rocks were bare, he
started on a run toward the opposite end of the lake. He was familiar
with every foot of the way, and the bank offered no obstruction.
He bounded as lightly as the chamois across chasms, and when they
were too broad to be leaped he skirted them without hesitation
or fault, never losing a rod of distance or a minute of time.
He never walked for more than ten paces, maintaining his gait
with a uniformity that no one else could have equalled.</p>

<p>He had a goodly number of miles to travel, for he was obliged
to round almost the entire circumference of the lake. He might
have cut off a large part of the distance by swimming across the
water, and undoubtedly he would have done so had not an important
errand drawn him to the extreme end.</p>

<p>The lake was fed by a narrow, deep stream, across which he sprang
with the ease of Wharton Edwards when leaping the gorge. A brief
way farther and he paused in front of a small structure among
the rocks. It was composed of limbs, bowlders, sticks, and the
skins of animals, barely large enough to give him room to lie
down and move around.</p>

<p>This was the home of the strange creature, and was never entered
by any other person. Stooping down, he passed within. No light
burned, nor did he need any. A few minutes later he emerged, carrying
a long bow in his hand and a quiver of arrows behind one shoulder
suspended by a thong which passed under one armpit. These implements
constituted his only weapons, besides the knife and tomahawk,
he never making use of any firearms.</p>

<p>In the moonlight and shadows it was impossible for him to follow
the trail of the youths, which would have been almost invisible
under the glare of the sun; but the Indian seemed to be guided
by intuition, which, in the mentally affected, often approaches
inspiration. In what way he was able to convince himself that
the young white men meant to pass down the other side of the canyon
cannot be conjectured, but that such was his conviction was proven
by his whole course of action.</p>

<p>The distance which the Shawanoe was obliged to journey consumed
several hours despite the speed he used, and nearly all of this
time was spent by Wharton Edwards and Larry Murphy in deep, refreshing
sleep.</p>

<p>When the Indian approached the spot where the canoe had been
abandoned by the youths his gait became a walk, and he peered
cautiously about him. He uttered a low cry of exultation on observing
the graceful birchen structure, and began a hasty examination.
The paddle lay in the bottom of the boat, which showed no signs
of injury. It might be supposed that this gratifying discovery
would have taken the edge off the Indian's enmity, but he showed
no signs of such feeling; if possible, his anger became fiercer.
He leaped away with a speed which prevented any attempt to follow
the trail, but he was proceeding on general principles, it may
be said.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that travelling was more difficult on the
side of the lake. Even such an expert as the Indian was forced
to change his gait from a trot to a walk. Sometimes he was in
shadow and sometimes in the moonlight. At intervals he paused,
and bent over as if examining the flinty surface for signs of
footsteps of the youths. It is incredible that he could have discovered
any under the circumstances, and yet he acted as if he did.</p>

<p>By and by he approached the spot where those for whom he was
searching lay asleep. He passed a short distance beyond, but something
displeased him. He stopped abruptly, looked down at the grass,
and then came back over his own trail.</p>

<p>While he stood peering into the surrounding gloom he saw the
inanimate forms.</p>

<p>In his delight the man repeated the dance he had given on the
shore of the lake. He leaped up and down, keeping time to the
swaying of the long, ashen bow grasped in his left hand, and passed
back and forth over a space of a dozen square feet.</p>

<p>He continually glanced at the youths, who were unconscious of
their danger, and held himself ready to open hostilities at the
moment they showed signs of awaking. Strange that neither Wharton
nor Larry thought of such a peril as that which now impended.</p>

<p>The grotesque dance lasted but a few minutes. That manner of
expressing his exultation was soon satisfied, and he made ready
for action.</p>

<p>Reaching over his left shoulder with his right hand, he drew
a feathered arrow from the quiver. A careful examination by moonlight
satisfied him that it was perfect and every way fitted for his
purpose. He fitted the notch in the deer-string of the bow, and
then advanced stealthily until within a few dozen yards of the
sleepers, the implement so held all the time that he could have
launched the missile at a moment's warning.</p>

<p>The elder of the youths lay nearest, and he aimed at him. Little
fear that he could not drive the arrow deep into the chest of
the sleeper, after which he probably intended to serve Wharton
in the same manner.</p>

<p>But with the whimsicality of an insane man he changed his mind,
evidently concluding that the tomahawk was the most fitting weapon
to be used in dispatching them. With the same deliberation shown
from the first, he relaxed the tension of the string and replaced
the arrow in the quiver. Then he turned about and silently deposited
the bow on the ground, so that it should not handicap him.</p>

<p>This was all that was necessary, and he drew his tomahawk and
faced about just in time to make an unexpected and startling discovery.</p>
