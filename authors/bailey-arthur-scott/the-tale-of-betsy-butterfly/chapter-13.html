<p>OF course, anyone so beautiful as Betsy Butterfly was bound to attract
attention. Wherever she went people turned their heads--if they
could--to look at her. And those whose heads were so fastened to their
bodies that they simply couldn't crane their necks at anybody--even
those unlucky creatures wheeled themselves about in order to gaze at
Betsy.
</p>
<p>If they happened to be ladies they stared at her because they wanted to
see what was the latest style in gowns, or maybe hats. And if they
happened to be gentlemen they looked at her because they just couldn't
help it.
</p><p>It was no wonder, then, that Betsy Butterfly had many admirers. In fact,
she was so accustomed to their flittering after her that usually she
paid little heed to them. But now and then one of them made himself so
agreeable that Betsy favored him slightly more than the others.
</p><p>Such was a stranger dressed in yellowish brown whom she chanced to meet
among the flowers one day. He was flying from flower to flower with a
loud buzzing. And he reminded Betsy Butterfly of somebody, but she
couldn't just think who it was.
</p><p>"Ah!" said the stranger, as soon as he caught Betsy's eye. "The blossoms
are fine and fresh after last night's shower, aren't they?"
</p><p>Betsy had to admit that what the stranger said was true. And when he
came right over to the flower where she was breakfasting and began
buzzing around her, and eating pollen, Betsy Butterfly thought that for
a stranger he seemed very friendly.
</p><p>She looked at him for a time, out of the corner of her eye, while she
tried to recall whom the newcomer resembled. But he looked like no one
she had even seen. And then all at once Betsy knew what was so familiar
about him. It was his voice!
</p><p>"You remind me of a friend of mine," she remarked. "He lives in the
meadow not far from here. It's your buzzing," she explained. "If I
didn't see you I should think you were Buster Bumblebee."
</p><p>Betsy's remark seemed to please the stranger. And he smiled smugly while
he buzzed louder than ever.
</p><p>"It's not surprising that I make you think of him," he observed. "Indeed
it would be odd if I didn't, for I'm a sort of cousin of Buster's, so
to speak. Perhaps you didn't know that my name is Bumble--Joseph
Bumble."
</p><p>Naturally Betsy and Joseph became good friends on the spot. And after
that people often saw them rambling together among the flowers.
</p><p>Now, Joseph Bumble proved to be a great talker. And since Betsy
Butterfly was an excellent listener, they spent many agreeable hours
together.
</p><p>At least, Joseph enjoyed every minute that he spent in Betsy Butterfly's
company. And if at times she found his prattle a bit tiresome, she was
too well-mannered to say so.
</p><p>If the truth were known, Joseph Bumble proved to be somewhat of a
braggart. He was forever boasting of his connection with the Bumblebee
family. And Betsy couldn't say anything to him without his remarking
that his cousin Buster Bumblebee's mother, the well-known Queen, thought
this or that.
</p><p>"And being of royal blood, the Queen ought to know what's what," he
frequently said.
</p><p>"I suppose--" Betsy said to him at last--"I suppose you're of royal
blood yourself, Mr. Bumble?"
</p><p>"Oh, very!" he replied with a smirk. "We're all of us very royal
indeed."
</p><p>And Betsy Butterfly thought how pleasant it was to be friends with
anyone who came from such a fine family as Joseph Bumble's.
