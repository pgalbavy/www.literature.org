<p>Not savage Hun, nor "barbarous Vandyke," nor demon Apache, could
wish to dwell upon the state of mind of the Chief of the Rouen
Volunteer Fire Department; therefore, let the curtain of mercy
descend. Without a word, he turned and dragged the nozzle to the
eastern eaves, whence, after a warning gesture to those below,
he dropped it to the ground. And, out of compassion, it should
be little more than hinted that the gesture of warning was very
slight.</p>

<p>When the rescued band reached the foot of the last flight of
stairs, they beheld the open doorway as a frame for a great press
of intent and con-torted faces, every eye still strained to watch
the roof; none of the harrowed spectators comprehending the appearance
of the girl's figure there, nor able to see whither she had led
the five young men, until Tappingham Marsh raised a shout as he
leaped out of the door and danced upon the solid earth again.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, there was a mighty uproar; cheer after cheer ascended
to the red vault of heaven; women wept, men whooped, and the people
rushed for the heroes with wide-open, welcoming arms. Jefferson
Bareaud and Frank Chenoweth and General Trumble dashed at Tom
Vanrevel with incoherent cries of thanksgiving, shaking his hands
and beating him hysterically upon the back. He greeted them with
bitter laughter.</p>

<p>"Help get the water into the next warehouse; this one is beyond
control, but we can save the other two. Take the lines in through
the door!"  He brushed the rejoicing friends off abruptly, and
went on in a queer, hollow voice: "There are stairs&mdash;and I'm so
sorry I didn't think of it until a moment ago, because you could
have brought the water up that way!"</p>

<p>A remarkable case of desertion had occurred, the previous instant,
under his eyes. As the party emerged from the warehouse into the
street, Tom heard Crailey say hurriedly to Miss Carewe: "Let me
get you away come quickly!" saw him suddenly seize her band, and,
eluding the onrushing crowd, run with her round the corner of
the building. And somehow, through what inspiration, or through
what knowledge of his partner's "temperament," heaven knows, the
prophetic soul of the chief was unhappily assured that Crailey
would offer himself as escort to her home, and find acceptance.
But why not? Was it Crailey who had publicly called his fellow-man
fool, idiot, imbecile, at the top of his lungs, only to find himself
the proven numskull of the universe! Tom stood for a moment staring
after the vanishing pair, while over his face stole the strangest
expression that ever man saw there; then, with meekly bowed shoulders,
he turned again to his work.</p>

<p>At the corner of the warehouse, Miss Carewe detached her hand
from Crailey's, yet still followed him as he made a quick detour
round the next building. A minute or two later they found themselves,
undetected, upon Main Street in the rear of the crowd. There Crailey
paused.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said, breathlessly, "for taking your hand. I
thought you would like to get away."</p>

<p>She regarded him gravely, so that he found it difficult to read
her look, except that it was seriously questioning; but whether
the interrogation was addressed to him or to herself he could
not determine. After a silence she said:</p>

<p>"I don't know why I followed you. I believe it must have been
because you didn't give me time to think."</p>

<p>This, of course, made him even quicker with her than before.
"It's all over," he said briskly. "The first warehouse is gone;
the second will go, but they'll save the others easily enough,
now that you have pointed out that the lines may be utilized otherwise
than as adjuncts of performances on the high trapeze!" They were
standing by a picket-fence, and he leaned against it, overcome
by mirth in which she did not join. Her gravity reacted upon him
at once, and his laughter was stopped short. "Will you not accept
me as an escort to your home?" he said formally. "I do not know,"
she returned simply, the sort of honest trouble in her glance
that is seen only in very young eyes.</p>

<p>"'What reason in the world!" he returned, with a crafty sharpness
of astonishment.</p>

<p>She continued to gaze upon him thoughtfully, while he tried to
look into her eyes, but was baffled because the radiant beams
from the lady's orbs (as the elder Chenoweth might have said)
rested somewhere dangerously near his chin, which worried him,
for, though his chin made no retreat and was far from ill-looking,
it was, nevertheless, that feature which he most distrusted. "Won't
you tell me why not?" he repeated, uneasily.</p>

<p>"Because," she answered at last, speaking hesitatingly, "because
it isn't so easy a matter for me as you seem to think. You have
not been introduced to me, and I know you never will be, and that
what you told me was true."</p>

<p>"Which part of what I told you?" The question escaped from him
instantly.</p>

<p>"That the others might come when they liked, but that you could
not."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, yes." His expression altered to a sincere dejection;
his shoulders drooped, and his voice indicated supreme annoyance.
"I might have known someone would tell you! Who was it? Did they
say why I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On account of your quarrel with my father."</p>

<p>"My quarrel with your father!" he exclaimed; and his face lit
with an elated surprise; his shoulders straightened. He took a
step nearer her, and asked, eagerly: "Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"My father himself. He spoke of a Mr. Vanrevel whom he&mdash;disliked,
and whom I must not meet; and, remembering what you had said,
of course I knew that you were he."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Crailey's lips began to form a smile of such appealing
and inimitable sweetness that Voltaire would have trusted him;
a smile alto-gether rose-leaves. "Then I lose you," he said, "for
my only chance to know you was in keeping it hidden from you.
And now you understand!"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, gravely, "I don't understand; that is what
troubles me. If I did, and believed you had the right of the difference,
I could believe it no sin that you should speak to me, should
take me home now. I think it is wrong not to act from your own
understanding of things."</p>

<p>The young man set his expression as one indomitably fixed upon
the course of honor, cost what it might; and, in the very action,
his lurking pleasure in doing it hopped out in the flicker of
a twinkle in his eyes, and as instantly sought cover again&mdash;the
flea in the rose-jar.</p>

<p>"Then you must ask some other," he said, firmly. "A disinterested
person should tell you. The difference was political in the beginning,
but became personal afterward; and it is now a quarrel which can
never be patched up, though, for my part, I wish that it could
be. I can say no more, because a party to it should not speak."</p>

<p>She met his level look squarely at last; and no man ever had
a more truthful pair of eyes than Crailey Gray, for it was his
great accomplishment that he could adjust his emotion, his reason,
and something that might be called his faith, to fit any situation
in any character.</p>

<p>"You may take me home," she answered. "I may be wrong, and even
disloyal; but I do not feel it so, now. You did a very brave thing
tonight to save him from loss, and I think that what you have
said was just what you should have said."</p>

<p>So they went down the street, the hubbub and confusion of the
fire growing more and more indistinct behind them. They walked
slowly, and, for a time, neither spoke; yet the silence was of
a kind which the adept rejoiced to have produced thus soon&mdash;their
second meeting. For he believed there were more strange things
in heaven and earth than Horatio wot; and one of the strangest
was that whenever he was near an attractive woman during a silence
such as this, something not to be defined, but as effective as
it was indefinite, always went out from him to her. It was like
a word of tenderness, a word too gentle, too compelling, too sweet,
to be part of any tongue, spoken or written. And more: this ineffable
word had an echo, and came back to him from the woman.</p>

<p>As his partner had in dress, so Crailey had with women, some
color of the Beau; but it was not in what experience had given
him to recognize as a fact: that they were apt to fall in love
with him. (That they were apt to remain in love with him&mdash;he understood
perfectly&mdash;was another matter.) And he knew when they were doing
it; could have told them accurately, at each step, what they were
feeling, thinking, dreaming, during the process, because he was
usually exhibiting the same symptoms to himself at the same time.</p>

<p>Thus, his own breast occupied with that dizzy elation which followed
its reception of the insane young god's arrows, and his heart
warm with the rise of the old emotion that he knew so well, he
was nevertheless able to walk with his finger on the pulse of
the exquisite moment, counting her heartbeats and his own.</p>

<p>So, to his fancy, as they walked, the little space between them
was hung with brilliant strands, like gossamer chains of gold,
already linking them together; every second fixing another slender,
precious fetter, binding them closer, drawing her nearer. He waited
until they passed into the shadows of the deserted Carewe Street
before he spoke. There he stopped abruptly; at which she turned,
astonished.</p>

<p>"Now that you have saved my life," he said, in a low, tremulous
tone, "what are you going to do with it?"</p>

<p>Her eyes opened almost as widely as they had at her first sight
of him in her garden. There was a long pause before she replied,
and when she did, it was to his considerable surprise.</p>

<p>"I have never seen a play, except the funny little ones we acted
at the convent," she said, "but isn't that the way they speak
on the stage?"</p>

<p>Crailey realized that his judgment of the silence bad been mistaken,
and yet it was with a thrill of delight that he recognized her
clear reading of him. He had been too florid again.</p>

<p>"Let us go." His voice was soft with restrained forgiveness.
"You mocked me once before.</p>

<p>"Mocked you?" she repeated, as they went on.</p>

<p>"Mocked me," he said, firmly. "Mocked me for seeming theatrical,
and yet you have learned that what I said was true; as you will
again."</p>

<p>She mused upon this; then, as in whimsical indulgence to an importunate
child:</p>

<p>"Well, tell me what you mean when you say I saved your life."</p>

<p>"You came alone," he began, hastily, "to stand upon that burning
roof&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Whence all but him had fled!" Her laughter rang out, interrupting
him. "My room was on the fourth floor at St. Mary's, and I didn't
mind climbing three flights this evening."</p>

<p>Crailey's good-nature was always perfect. "You mock me and you
mock me!"  he cried, and made her laughter but part of a gay duet.
"I know I have gone too fast, have said things I should have waited
to say; but, ah! remember the small chance I have against the
others who can see you when they like. Don't flout me because
I try to make the most of a rare, stolen moment with you."</p>

<p>"Do!" she exclaimed, grave upon the instant. "Do make the most
of it! I have nothing but inexperience. Make the most by treating
me seriously. Won't you? I know you can, and I &mdash;<em>I&mdash;"
</em>She faltered to a full stop. She was earnest and quiet, and
there had been something in her tone, too&mdash;as very often there
was&mdash;that showed how young she was. "Oh!" she began again, turning
to him impulsively, "I have thought about you since that evening
in the garden, and I have wished I could know you. I can't be
quite clear how it happened, but even those few minutes left a
number of strong impressions about you. And the strongest was
that you were one with whom I could talk of a great many things,
if you would only be real with me. I believe&mdash;though I'm not sure
why I do&mdash;that it is very difficult for you to be real; perhaps
because you are so different at different times that you aren't
sure, yourself, which the real you is. But the person that you
are beginning to be for my benefit must be the most trifling of
all your selves, lighter and easier to put on than the little
mask you carried the other night. If there were nothing better
underneath the mask, I might play, too."</p>

<p>"Did you learn this at the convent?" gasped Crailey.</p>

<p>"There was a world there in miniature," she answered, speaking
very quickly. "I think all people are made of the same materials,
only in such different proportions. I think a little world might
hold as much as the largest, if you thought it all out hard enough,
and your experience might be just as broad and deep in a small
corner of the earth as anywhere else. But I don't know! I want
to understand &mdash;I want to understand everything! I read books,
and there are people&mdash;but no one who tells me what I want &mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stop." He lifted his hand. "I won't act; I shall never 'play'
for you again." He was breathless; the witching silence was nothing
to what stirred him now. A singular exaltation rose in him, together
with the reckless impulse to speak from the mood her vehement
confidence had in-spired. He gave way to it.</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he said huskily. "I understand all you mean,
all you feel, all you wish. It is all echoing here, and here,
and here!" He touched his breast, his eyes, and his forehead with
the fingers of his long and slender hand. "We sigh and strain
our eyes and stretch out our arms in the dark, groping always
for the strange blessing that is just beyond our grasp, seeking
for the precious unknown that lies just over the horizon! It's
what they meant by the pot of gold where the rainbow ends&mdash;only,
it may be there, after all!"</p>

<p>They stopped unconsciously, and remained standing at the lower
end of the Carewe hedge. The western glow had faded, and she was
gazing at him through the darkness, leaning forward, never dreaming
that her tight grasp had broken the sticks of the little pink
fan.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered, eagerly. "You are right: you understand!"</p>

<p>He went on, the words coming faster and faster: "We are haunted&mdash;you
and <em>I&mdash;</em>by the wish to know all things, and by the question
that lies under every thought we have: the agonizing Whither?
Isn't it like that? It is really death that makes us think. You
are a good Catholic: you go to mass; but you wish to know. Does
God reign, or did it all happen? Sometimes it seems so deadly
probable that the universe just was, no God to plan it, nothing
but things; that we die as sparrows die, and the brain is all
the soul we have, a thing that becomes clogged and stops some
day. And is that all?"</p>

<p>She shivered slightly, but her steadfast eyes did not shift from
him. He threw back his head, and his face, uplifted to the jewelled
sky of the moonless night, was beatific in its peacefulness, as
he continued in an altered tone, gentle and low:</p>

<p>"I think all questions are answered there. The stars tell it
all. When you look at them you know! They have put them on our
flag. There are times when this seems but a poor nation: boastful,
corrupt, violent, and preparing, as it is now, to steal another
country by fraud and war; yet the stars on the flag always make
me happy and confident. Do you see the constellations swinging
above us, such unimaginable vastnesses, not roving or crashing
through the illimitable at haphazard, but moving in more excellent
measure, and to a finer rhythm, than the most delicate clockwork
man ever made? The great ocean-lines mark our seas with their
paths through the water; the fine brains of the earth are behind
the ships that sail from port to port, yet how awry the system
goes! When does a ship come to her harbor at an hour determined
when she sailed? What is a ship beside the smallest moon of the
smallest world? But, there above us, moons, worlds, suns, all
the infinite cluster of colossi, move into place to the exactness
of a hair at the precise instant. That instant has been planned,
you see; it is part of a system&mdash;and can a system exist that no
mind made? Think of the Mind that made this one! Do you believe
so inconceivably majestic an Intelligence as that could be anything
but good? Ah, when you wonder, look above you; look above you
in the night, I say," he cried, his hand upraised like his transfigured
face. "Look above you and you will never fear that a sparrow's
fall could go unmarked!"</p>

<p>It was not to the stars that she looked, but to the orator, as
long as he held that pose, which lasted until a hard-ridden horse
came galloping down the street. As it dashed by, though the rider
looked neither to right nor left, Miss Betty unconsciously made
a feverish clutch at her companion's sleeve, drawing him closer
to the hedge.</p>

<p>"It is my father," she said hurriedly in a low voice. "He must
not see you. You must never come here. Perhaps&mdash;" She paused,
then quickly whispered: "You have been very kind to me. Good-night."</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly, and through the dimness saw that her
face was shining with excitement. He did not speak again, but,
taking a step back-ward, smiled faintly, bent his head in humble
acquiescence, and made a slight gesture of his hand for her to
leave him. She set her eyes upon his once more, then turned swiftly
and almost ran along the hedge to the gate; but there she stopped
and looked back. He was standing where she had left him, his face
again uplifted to the sky.</p>

<p>She waved him an uncertain farewell, and ran into the garden,
both palms against her burning cheeks.</p>

<p>Night is the great necromancer, and strange are the fabrics he
weaves; he lays queer spells; breathes so eerie an intoxication
through the dusk; he can cast such glamours about a voice! He
is the very king of fairyland.</p>

<p>Miss Betty began to walk rapidly up and down the garden paths,
her head bent and her bands still pressed to her cheeks; now and
then an unconscious exclamation burst from her, incoherent, more
like a gasp than a word. A long time she paced the vigil with
her stirring heart, her skirts sweeping the dew from the leaning
flowers. Her lips moved often, but only the confused, vehement
"Oh, oh!" came from them, until at last she paused in the middle
of the garden, away from the trees, where all was open to the
sparkling firmament, and extended her arms over her head.</p>

<p>"O, strange teacher," she said aloud, "I take your beautiful
stars! I shall know how to learn from them!"</p>

<p>She gazed steadily upward, enrapt, her eyes resplendent with
their own starlight.</p>

<p>"Oh, stars, stars, stars!" she whispered.</p>

<p>In the teeth of all wizardry, Night's spells do pass at sunrise;
marvellous poems sink to doggerel, mighty dreams to blown ashes
and solids regain weight. Miss Betty, waking at daybreak, saw
the motes dancing in the sun at her window, and watched them with
a placid, unremembering eye. She began to stare at them in a puzzled
way, while a look of wonder slowly spread over her face. Suddenly
she sat upright, as though something had startled her. Her fingers
clenched tightly.</p>

<p>"Ah, if that was playing!"</p>
