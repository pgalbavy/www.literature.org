<p>A week had passed, and we all sat at supper one night in the Mission
dining-room, feeling very much depressed in spirits, for the reason that
we were going to say goodbye to our kind friends, the Mackenzies, and
depart upon our way at dawn on the morrow. Nothing more had been seen
or heard of the Masai, and save for a spear or two which had been
overlooked and was rusting in the grass, and a few empty cartridges
where we had stood outside the wall, it would have been difficult to
tell that the old cattle kraal at the foot of the slope had been the
scene of so desperate a struggle. Mackenzie was, thanks chiefly to his
being so temperate a man, rapidly recovering from his wound, and could
get about on a pair of crutches; and as for the other wounded men, one
had died of gangrene, and the rest were in a fair way to recovery. Mr
Mackenzie’s caravan of men had also returned from the coast, so that the
station was now amply garrisoned.
</p>
<p>Under these circumstances we concluded, warm and pressing as were the
invitations for us to stay, that it was time to move on, first to Mount
Kenia, and thence into the unknown in search of the mysterious white
race which we had set our hearts on discovering. This time we were going
to progress by means of the humble but useful donkey, of which we had
collected no less than a dozen, to carry our goods and chattels, and, if
necessary, ourselves. We had now but two Wakwafis left for servants, and
found it quite impossible to get other natives to venture with us into
the unknown parts we proposed to explore--and small blame to them.
After all, as Mr Mackenzie said, it was odd that three men, each of
whom possessed many of those things that are supposed to make life worth
living--health, sufficient means, and position, etc.--should from their
own pleasure start out upon a wild-goose chase, from which the chances
were they never would return. But then that is what Englishmen are,
adventurers to the backbone; and all our magnificent muster-roll of
colonies, each of which will in time become a great nation, testify to
the extraordinary value of the spirit of adventure which at first sight
looks like a mild form of lunacy. ‘Adventurer’--he that goes out to meet
whatever may come. Well, that is what we all do in the world one way or
another, and, speaking for myself, I am proud of the title, because it
implies a brave heart and a trust in Providence. Besides, when many and
many a noted Croesus, at whose feet the people worship, and many and
many a time-serving and word-coining politician are forgotten, the names
of those grand-hearted old adventurers who have made England what she
is, will be remembered and taught with love and pride to little children
whose unshaped spirits yet slumber in the womb of centuries to be. Not
that we three can expect to be numbered with such as these, yet have we
done something--enough, perhaps, to throw a garment over the nakedness
of our folly.
</p><p>That evening, whilst we were sitting on the veranda, smoking a pipe
before turning in, who should come up to us but Alphonse, and, with a
magnificent bow, announce his wish for an interview. Being requested to
‘fire away’, he explained at some length that he was anxious to attach
himself to our party--a statement that astonished me not a little,
knowing what a coward the little man was. The reason, however, soon
appeared. Mr Mackenzie was going down to the coast, and thence on to
England. Now, if he went down country, Alphonse was persuaded that he
would be seized, extradited, sent to France, and to penal servitude.
This was the idea that haunted him, as King Charles’s head haunted Mr
Dick, and he brooded over it till his imagination exaggerated the danger
ten times. As a matter of fact, the probability is that his offence
against the laws of his country had long ago been forgotten, and that
he would have been allowed to pass unmolested anywhere except in France;
but he could not be got to see this. Constitutional coward as the little
man was, he infinitely preferred to face the certain hardships and great
risks and dangers of such an expedition as ours, than to expose himself,
notwithstanding his intense longing for his native land, to the
possible scrutiny of a police officer--which is after all only another
exemplification of the truth that, to the majority of men, a far-off
foreseen danger, however shadowy, is much more terrible than the most
serious present emergency. After listening to what he had to say, we
consulted among ourselves, and finally agreed, with Mr Mackenzie’s
knowledge and consent, to accept his offer. To begin with, we were very
short-handed, and Alphonse was a quick, active fellow, who could turn
his hand to anything, and cook--ah, he <u>could</u> cook! I believe that
he would have made a palatable dish of those gaiters of his heroic
grandfather which he was so fond of talking about. Then he was a
good-tempered little man, and merry as a monkey, whilst his pompous,
vainglorious talk was a source of infinite amusement to us; and what is
more, he never bore malice. Of course, his being so pronounced a coward
was a great drawback to him, but now that we knew his weakness we could
more or less guard against it. So, after warning him of the undoubted
risks he was exposing himself to, we told him that we would accept
his offer on condition that he would promise implicit obedience to our
orders. We also promised to give him wages at the rate of ten pounds a
month should he ever return to a civilized country to receive them. To
all of this he agreed with alacrity, and retired to write a letter
to his Annette, which Mr Mackenzie promised to post when he got down
country. He read it to us afterwards, Sir Henry translating, and a
wonderful composition it was. I am sure the depth of his devotion and
the narration of his sufferings in a barbarous country, ‘far, far from
thee, Annette, for whose adored sake I endure such sorrow,’ ought to
have touched the feelings of the stoniest-hearted chambermaid.
</p><p>Well, the morrow came, and by seven o’clock the donkeys were all loaded,
and the time of parting was at hand. It was a melancholy business,
especially saying goodbye to dear little Flossie. She and I were great
friends, and often used to have talks together--but her nerves had never
got over the shock of that awful night when she lay in the power of
those bloodthirsty Masai. ‘Oh, Mr Quatermain,’ she cried, throwing her
arms round my neck and bursting into tears, ‘I can’t bear to say goodbye
to you. I wonder when we shall meet again?’
</p><p>‘I don’t know, my dear little girl,’ I said, ‘I am at one end of life
and you are at the other. I have but a short time before me at best, and
most things lie in the past, but I hope that for you there are many long
and happy years, and everything lies in the future. By-and-by you will
grow into a beautiful woman, Flossie, and all this wild life will be
like a far-off dream to you; but I hope, even if we never do meet again,
that you will think of your old friend and remember what I say to you
now. Always try to be good, my dear, and to do what is right, rather
than what happens to be pleasant, for in the end, whatever sneering
people may say, what is good and what is happy are the same. Be
unselfish, and whenever you can, give a helping hand to others--for the
world is full of suffering, my dear, and to alleviate it is the noblest
end that we can set before us. If you do that you will become a sweet
and God-fearing woman, and make many people’s lives a little brighter,
and then you will not have lived, as so many of your sex do, in vain.
And now I have given you a lot of old-fashioned advice, and so I am
going to give you something to sweeten it with. You see this little
piece of paper. It is what is called a cheque. When we are gone give it
to your father with this note--not before, mind. You will marry one day,
my dear little Flossie, and it is to buy you a wedding present which
you are to wear, and your daughter after you, if you have one, in
remembrance of Hunter Quatermain.’
</p><p>Poor little Flossie cried very much, and gave me a lock of her bright
hair in return, which I still have. The cheque I gave her was for a
thousand pounds (which being now well off, and having no calls upon
me except those of charity, I could well afford), and in the note I
directed her father to invest it for her in Government security, and
when she married or came of age to buy her the best diamond necklace
he could get for the money and accumulated interest. I chose diamonds
because I think that now that King Solomon’s Mines are lost to the
world, their price will never be much lower than it is at present, so
that if in after-life she should ever be in pecuniary difficulties, she
will be able to turn them into money.
</p><p>Well, at last we got off, after much hand-shaking, hat-waving, and also
farewell saluting from the natives, Alphonse weeping copiously (for he
has a warm heart) at parting with his master and mistress; and I was
not sorry for it at all, for I hate those goodbyes. Perhaps the most
affecting thing of all was to witness Umslopogaas’ distress at parting
with Flossie, for whom the grim old warrior had conceived a strong
affection. He used to say that she was as sweet to see as the only star
on a dark night, and was never tired of loudly congratulating himself
on having killed the Lygonani who had threatened to murder her. And that
was the last we saw of the pleasant Mission-house--a true oasis in
the desert--and of European civilization. But I often think of the
Mackenzies, and wonder how they got down country, and if they are now
safe and well in England, and will ever see these words. Dear little
Flossie! I wonder how she fares there where there are no black folk to
do her imperious bidding, and no sky-piercing snow-clad Kenia for her to
look at when she gets up in the morning. And so goodbye to Flossie.
</p><p>After leaving the Mission-house we made our way, comparatively
unmolested, past the base of Mount Kenia, which the Masai call ‘Donyo
Egere’, or the ‘speckled mountain’, on account of the black patches
of rock that appear upon its mighty spire, where the sides are too
precipitous to allow of the snow lying on them; then on past the
lonely lake Baringo, where one of our two remaining Askari, having
unfortunately trodden on a puff-adder, died of snake-bite, in spite of
all our efforts to save him. Thence we proceeded a distance of about a
hundred and fifty miles to another magnificent snow-clad mountain called
Lekakisera, which has never, to the best of my belief, been visited
before by a European, but which I cannot now stop to describe. There
we rested a fortnight, and then started out into the trackless and
uninhabited forest of a vast district called Elgumi. In this forest
alone there are more elephants than I ever met with or heard of before.
The mighty mammals literally swarm there entirely unmolested by man, and
only kept down by the natural law that prevents any animals increasing
beyond the capacity of the country they inhabit to support them.
Needless to say, however, we did not shoot many of them, first because
we could not afford to waste ammunition, of which our stock was getting
perilously low, a donkey loaded with it having been swept away in
fording a flooded river; and secondly, because we could not carry away
the ivory, and did not wish to kill for the mere sake of slaughter. So
we let the great beasts be, only shooting one or two in self-protection.
In this district, the elephants, being unacquainted with the hunter and
his tender mercies, would allow one to walk up to within twenty yards of
them in the open, while they stood, with their great ears cocked for all
the world like puzzled and gigantic puppy-dogs, and stared at that new
and extraordinary phenomenon--man. Occasionally, when the inspection did
not prove satisfactory, the staring ended in a trumpet and a charge,
but this did not often happen. When it did we had to use our rifles.
Nor were elephants the only wild beasts in the great Elgumi forest. All
sorts of large game abounded, including lions--confound them! I have
always hated the sight of a lion since one bit my leg and lamed me for
life. As a consequence, another thing that abounded was the dreadful
tsetse fly, whose bite is death to domestic animals. Donkeys have,
together with men, hitherto been supposed to enjoy a peculiar immunity
from its attacks; but all I have to say, whether it was on account
of their poor condition, or because the tsetse in those parts is
more poisonous than usual, I do not know, but ours succumbed to its
onslaught. Fortunately, however, that was not till two months or so
after the bites had been inflicted, when suddenly, after a two days’
cold rain, they all died, and on removing the skins of several of them I
found the long yellow streaks upon the flesh which are characteristic of
death from bites from the tsetse, marking the spot where the insect had
inserted his proboscis. On emerging from the great Elgumi forest,
we, still steering northwards, in accordance with the information Mr
Mackenzie had collected from the unfortunate wanderer who reached him
only to die so tragically, struck the base in due course of the large
lake, called Laga by the natives, which is about fifty miles long by
twenty broad, and of which, it may be remembered, he made mention.
Thence we pushed on nearly a month’s journey over great rolling uplands,
something like those in the Transvaal, but diversified by patches of
bush country.
</p><p>All this time we were continually ascending at the rate of about one
hundred feet every ten miles. Indeed the country was on a slope which
appeared to terminate at a mass of snow-tipped mountains, for which we
were steering, and where we learnt the second lake of which the wanderer
had spoken as the lake without a bottom was situated. At length we
arrived there, and, having ascertained that there <u>was</u> a large lake on
top of the mountains, ascended three thousand feet more till we came to
a precipitous cliff or edge, to find a great sheet of water some
twenty miles square lying fifteen hundred feet below us, and evidently
occupying an extinct volcanic crater or craters of vast extent.
Perceiving villages on the border of this lake, we descended with
great difficulty through forests of pine trees, which now clothed the
precipitous sides of the crater, and were well received by the people, a
simple, unwarlike folk, who had never seen or even heard of a white man
before, and treated us with great reverence and kindness, supplying us
with as much food and milk as we could eat and drink. This wonderful
and beautiful lake lay, according to our aneroid, at a height of no less
than 11,450 feet above sea-level, and its climate was quite cold, and
not at all unlike that of England. Indeed, for the first three days of
our stay there we saw little or nothing of the scenery on account of an
unmistakable Scotch mist which prevailed. It was this rain that set the
tsetse poison working in our remaining donkeys, so that they all died.
</p><p>This disaster left us in a very awkward position, as we had now no
means of transport whatever, though on the other hand we had not much to
carry. Ammunition, too, was very short, amounting to but one hundred and
fifty rounds of rifle cartridges and some fifty shot-gun cartridges.
How to get on we did not know; indeed it seemed to us that we had about
reached the end of our tether. Even if we had been inclined to abandon
the object of our search, which, shadow as it was, was by no means the
case, it was ridiculous to think of forcing our way back some seven
hundred miles to the coast in our present plight; so we came to the
conclusion that the only thing to be done was to stop where we were--the
natives being so well disposed and food plentiful--for the present, and
abide events, and try to collect information as to the countries beyond.
</p><p>Accordingly, having purchased a capital log canoe, large enough to hold
us all and our baggage, from the headman of the village we were staying
in, presenting him with three empty cold-drawn brass cartridges by way
of payment, with which he was perfectly delighted, we set out to make
a tour of the lake in order to find the most favourable place to make a
camp. As we did not know if we should return to this village, we put all
our gear into the canoe, and also a quarter of cooked water-buck, which
when young is delicious eating, and off we set, natives having already
gone before us in light canoes to warn the inhabitants of the other
villages of our approach.
</p><p>As we were puddling leisurely along Good remarked upon the extraordinary
deep blue colour of the water, and said that he understood from the
natives, who were great fishermen--fish, indeed, being their principal
food--that the lake was supposed to be wonderfully deep, and to have
a hole at the bottom through which the water escaped and put out some
great fire that was raging below.
</p><p>I pointed out to him that what he had heard was probably a legend
arising from a tradition among the people which dated back to the time
when one of the extinct parasitic volcanic cones was in activity. We saw
several round the borders of the lake which had no doubt been working
at a period long subsequent to the volcanic death of the central crater
which now formed the bed of the lake itself. When it finally became
extinct the people would imagine that the water from the lake had run
down and put out the big fire below, more especially as, though it was
constantly fed by streams running from the snow-tipped peaks about,
there was no visible exit to it.
</p><p>The farther shore of the lake we found, on approaching it, to consist
of a vast perpendicular wall of rock, which held the water without any
intermediate sloping bank, as elsewhere. Accordingly we paddled parallel
with this precipice, at a distance of about a hundred paces from it,
shaping our course for the end of the lake, where we knew that there was
a large village.
</p><p>As we went we began to pass a considerable accumulation of floating
rushes, weed, boughs of trees, and other rubbish, brought, Good
supposed, to this spot by some current, which he was much puzzled to
account for. Whilst we were speculating about this, Sir Henry pointed
out a flock of large white swans, which were feeding on the drift some
little way ahead of us. Now I had already noticed swans flying about
this lake, and, having never come across them before in Africa, was
exceedingly anxious to obtain a specimen. I had questioned the natives
about them, and learnt that they came from over the mountain, always
arriving at certain periods of the year in the early morning, when it
was very easy to catch them, on account of their exhausted condition.
I also asked them what country they came from, when they shrugged their
shoulders, and said that on the top of the great black precipice was
stony inhospitable land, and beyond that were mountains with snow, and
full of wild beasts, where no people lived, and beyond the mountains
were hundreds of miles of dense thorn forest, so thick that even the
elephants could not get through it, much less men. Next I asked them if
they had ever heard of white people like ourselves living on the farther
side of the mountains and the thorn forest, whereat they laughed. But
afterwards a very old woman came and told me that when she was a little
girl her grandfather had told her that in his youth <u>his</u> grandfather
had crossed the desert and the mountains, and pierced the thorn forest,
and seen a white people who lived in stone kraals beyond. Of course,
as this took the tale back some two hundred and fifty years, the
information was very indefinite; but still there it was again, and on
thinking it over I grew firmly convinced that there was some truth in
all these rumours, and equally firmly determined to solve the mystery.
Little did I guess in what an almost miraculous way my desire was to be
gratified.
</p><p>Well, we set to work to stalk the swans, which kept drawing, as they
fed, nearer and nearer to the precipice, and at last we pushed the canoe
under shelter of a patch of drift within forty yards of them. Sir Henry
had the shot-gun, loaded with No. 1, and, waiting for a chance, got two
in a line, and, firing at their necks, killed them both. Up rose the
rest, thirty or more of them, with a mighty splashing; and, as they did
so, he gave them the other barrel. Down came one fellow with a broken
wing, and I saw the leg of another drop and a few feathers start out of
his back; but he went on quite strong. Up went the swans, circling ever
higher till at last they were mere specks level with the top of the
frowning precipice, when I saw them form into a triangle and head off
for the unknown north-east. Meanwhile we had picked up our two dead
ones, and beautiful birds they were, weighing not less than about thirty
pounds each, and were chasing the winged one, which had scrambled over
a mass of driftweed into a pool of clear water beyond. Finding a
difficulty in forcing the canoe through the rubbish, I told our only
remaining Wakwafi servant, whom I knew to be an excellent swimmer, to
jump over, dive under the drift, and catch him, knowing that as there
were no crocodiles in this lake he could come to no harm. Entering into
the fun of the thing, the man obeyed, and soon was dodging about after
the winged swan in fine style, getting gradually nearer to the rock
wall, against which the water washed as he did so.
</p><p>Presently he gave up swimming after the swan, and began to cry out
that he was being carried away; and, indeed, we saw that, though he was
swimming with all his strength towards us, he was being drawn slowly to
the precipice. With a few desperate strokes of our paddles we pushed the
canoe through the crust of drift and rowed towards the man as hard as we
could, but, fast as we went, he was drawn faster to the rock. Suddenly I
saw that before us, just rising eighteen inches or so above the surface
of the lake, was what looked like the top of the arch of a submerged
cave or railway tunnel. Evidently, from the watermark on the rock
several feet above it, it was generally entirely submerged; but there
had been a dry season, and the cold had prevented the snow from melting
as freely as usual; so the lake was low and the arch showed. Towards
this arch our poor servant was being sucked with frightful rapidity. He
was not more than ten fathoms from it, and we were about twenty when I
saw it, and with little help from us the canoe flew along after him.
He struggled bravely, and I thought that we should have saved him, when
suddenly I perceived an expression of despair come upon his face, and
there before our eyes he was sucked down into the cruel swirling blue
depths, and vanished. At the same moment I felt our canoe seized as with
a mighty hand, and propelled with resistless force towards the rock.
</p><p>We realized our danger now and rowed, or rather paddled, furiously in
our attempt to get out of the vortex. In vain; in another second we were
flying straight for the arch like an arrow, and I thought that we were
lost. Luckily I retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out,
instantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the
canoe, ‘Down on your faces--down!’ and the others had the sense to take
the hint. In another instant there was a grinding noise, and the boat
was pushed down till the water began to trickle over the sides, and I
thought that we were gone. But no, suddenly the grinding ceased, and we
could again feel the canoe flying along. I turned my head a little--I
dared not lift it--and looked up. By the feeble light that yet reached
the canoe, I could make out that a dense arch of rock hung just over our
heads, and that was all. In another minute I could not even see as much
as that, for the faint light had merged into shadow, and the shadows had
been swallowed up in darkness, utter and complete.
</p><p>For an hour or so we lay there, not daring to lift our heads for fear
lest the brains should be dashed out of them, and scarcely able to speak
even, on account of the noise of the rushing water which drowned our
voices. Not, indeed, that we had much inclination to speak, seeing that
we were overwhelmed by the awfulness of our position and the imminent
fear of instant death, either by being dashed against the sides of the
cavern, or on a rock, or being sucked down in the raging waters, or
perhaps asphyxiated by want of air. All of these and many other modes of
death presented themselves to my imagination as I lay at the bottom
of the canoe, listening to the swirl of the hurrying waters which ran
whither we knew not. One only other sound could I hear, and that was
Alphonse’s intermittent howl of terror coming from the centre of the
canoe, and even that seemed faint and unnatural. Indeed, the whole thing
overpowered my brain, and I began to believe that I was the victim of
some ghastly spirit-shaking nightmare.
