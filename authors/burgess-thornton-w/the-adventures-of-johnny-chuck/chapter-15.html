<p>Johnny Chuck was missed from his old home on the Green Meadows.
If he had known how much he was missed, he certainly would have
tried to go back for at least a call on his old neighbors. There
had been great surprise when it had been discovered that Jimmy
Skunk was living in Johnny's old house, and at first some of the
little meadow people were inclined to look at Jimmy a wee bit
distrustfully when he told how Johnny Chuck had given away his
house.</p>

<p>When Johnny sent back word by the Merry Little Breezes that it
was true, they believed Jimmy Skunk and forgot the unpleasant
things that they had begun to hint at about him. But they one
and all thought that Johnny Chuck must be crazy. Yes, Sir, they
thought that Johnny Chuck must be crazy. They were sure of it
when the Merry Little Breezes brought word of how Johnny had started
out to see the world.</p>

<p>But everybody was so busy about their own affairs in the beautiful
bright spring-time that they couldn't spend much time wondering
about Johnny Chuck. They missed him every time they passed his
old house and then forgot him; that is, most of the little meadow
people did.</p>

<p>Peter Rabbit didn't. Peter used to stop every day to gossip with
Johnny Chuck and tell him all the news, and now that Johnny Chuck
was no longer there, Peter missed him greatly. Jimmy Skunk was
always asleep or off somewhere. Besides, he was such a traveler
that he knew all the news almost as soon as Peter himself.</p>

<p>The Merry Little Breezes told Peter that Johnny Chuck was still
on the Green Meadows, hunting for a new home, so Peter made up
his mind that just as soon as Johnny got settled, Peter would
hunt him up and call. You see, he never dreamed that Johnny would
leave the Green Meadows, and he thought that of course the Merry
Little Breezes would tell him just where Johnny Chuck's new house
was, whenever it was built. But there is where Peter made a mistake.</p>

<p>The Merry Little Breezes are the friends of all the little meadow
and forest people, but they wouldn't be very long if they told
everything that they find out.</p>

<p>
Their merry tongues they guard full well<br/>
And things they shouldn't never tell,<br/>
For long ago they learned the way<br/>
To keep a secret night and day.

<p>And so when they found Johnny Chuck's new house in the corner
of Farmer Brown's old orchard, they promised Johnny that they
wouldn't tell anybody, and they didn't. So it was a long time
before any one else found out what had become of Johnny Chuck,
for no one thought of looking in the corner of the old orchard.</p>

<p>The Merry Little Breezes used to come every day and bring Johnny
Chuck the news, and he and Polly Chuck would laugh and tickle,
as they thought of Peter Rabbit hunting and hunting and never
finding them.</p>

<p>Then one morning, as Johnny Chuck sat on his door-step, half
dozing in the sun with his heart filled with contentment, he happened
to look up straight into two sharp eyes peering down at him from
among the leaves of the apple-tree under which he had built his
house. He knew those eyes. They were such sharp eyes that they
were unpleasant. He didn't even have to look for the blue and
white coat of the owner to know who had found his snug home. But
he pretended to keep right on dozing, and pretty soon the owner
of the eyes disappeared without making a sound.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Johnny Chuck, "now the whole world will know
where we live, for that was Sammy Jay." Then his face brightened
as he added: "Anyway, he didn't see Polly Chuck, and he doesn't
know anything about her, so I'll keep twice as sharp a watch as
before."</p>
