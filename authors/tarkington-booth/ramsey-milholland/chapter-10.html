<p>He never saw her again. She sent him a "picture postal" from
Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, which his father disengaged from the family
mail, one morning at breakfast, and considerately handed to him
without audible comment. Upon it was written, <em>"Oh, you Ramsey!"</em>
This was the last of Milla.</p>

<p>Just before school opened, in the autumn, Sadie Clews made some
revelations. "Milla did like you," said Sadie. "After that time
you jumped in the creek to save her she liked you better than
any boy in town, and I guess if it wasn't for her cousin Milt
up in Chicago she would of liked you the best anywhere. I guess
she did, anyway, because she hadn't seen him for about a year
then.</p>

<p>"Well, that afternoon she went away I was over there and took
in everything that was goin' on, only she made me promise on my
word of honour I wouldn't even tell Albert. They didn't get any
wire from her uncle about the touring car; it was her cousin Milt
that jumped on the train and came down and fixed it all up for
Milla to go on the trip, and everything. You see, Ramsey, she
was turned back a couple of times in school before she came in
our class and I don't exactly know how old she is and she don't
<em>look</em> old yet, but I'm pretty sure she's at least eighteen,
and she might be over. Her mother kept tellin' her all the time
you were just a kid, and didn't have anything to support her on,
and lots of things like that. I didn't think such a great deal
of this Milt's looks, myself, but he's anyway twenty-one years
old, and got a good position, and all their family seem to think
he's just fine! It wasn't his father that took in the touring
car on debt, like she said she was writing to you; it was Milt
himself. He started out in business when he was only fifteen years
old, and this trip he was gettin' up for his father and mother
and Milla was the first vacation he ever took. Well, of course
she wouldn't like my tellin' you, but I can't see the harm of
it, now everything's all over."</p>

<p>"All&mdash;all over? You mean Milla's going to be&mdash;to be married?"</p>

<p>"She already is," said Sadie. "They got married at her Aunt Jess
and Uncle Purv's house, up in Chicago, last Thursday. Yes, sir;
that quiet little Milla's a regular old married woman by this
time, I expect, Ramsey!"</p>

<p>When he got over the shock, which was not until the next day,
one predominating feeling remained: it was a gloomy pride&mdash;a pride
in his proven maturity. He was old enough, it appeared, to have
been the same thing as engaged to a person who was now a Married
Woman. His manner thenceforth showed an added trace of seriousness
and self-consideration.</p>

<p>Having recovered his equipoise and something more, he entirely
forgot that moment of humble admiration he had felt for Dora Yocum
on the day of his flattest prostration. When he saw her sitting
in the classroom, smiling brightly up at the teacher, the morning
of the school's opening in the autumn, all his humility had long
since vanished and she appeared to him not otherwise than as the
scholar whose complete proficiency had always been so irksome
to him.</p>

<p>"Look at her!" he muttered to himself. "Same ole Teacher's Pet!"</p>

<p>Now and then, as the days and seasons passed, and Dora's serene
progress continued, never checked or even flawed, there stirred
within some lingerings of the old determination to "show" her;
and he would conjure up a day-dream of Dora in loud lamentation,
while he led the laughter of the spectators. But gradually his
feelings about her came to be merely a dull oppression. He was
tired of having to look at her (as he stated it) and he thanked
the Lord that the time wouldn't be so long now until he'd be out
of that ole school, and then all he'd have to do he'd just take
care never to walk by her house; it was easy enough to use some
other street when he had to go down-town.</p>

<p>"The good ole class of Nineteen-Fourteen is about gone," he said
to Fred Mitchell, who was still his most intimate friend when
they reached the senior year. "Yes, sir; it's held together a
good many years, Fred, but after June it'll be busted plum up,
and I hope nobody starts a move to have any reunions. There's
a good many members of the ole class that I can stand and there's
some I can't, but there's one I just won't! If we ever did call
a reunion, that ole Yocum girl would start in right away and run
the whole shebang, and that's where I'd resign! You know, Fred,
the thing <em>I</em> think is the one biggest benefit of graduating
from this ole school? It's never seein' Dora Yocum again."</p>

<p>This was again his theme as he sat by the same friend's side,
in the rear row of the class at Commencement, listening to the
delivery of the Valedictory. "Thinks she's just sooblime, don't
she!" he whispered morosely. "She wouldn't trade with the President
of the United States right now. She prob'ly thinks bein' Valedictorian
is more important than Captain of the State University Eleven.
Never mind!" And here his tone became huskily jubilant. "Never
mind! Just about a half-an-hour more and that's the last o' <em>you</em>,
ole girl! Yes, sir, Fred; one thing we can feel pretty good over:
this is where we get through with Dora Yocum!"</p>

<p>Ramsey and Fred had arranged to room together at Greenfield,
the seat of the state university, and they made the short journey
in company the following September. They arrived hilarious, anticipating
pleasurable excitements in the way of "fraternity" pledgings and
initiations, encounters with sophomores, class meetings, and elections;
and, also, they were not absolutely without interest in the matter
of Girls, for the state university was co-educational, and it
was but natural to expect in so broad a field, all new to them,
a possible vision of something rather thrilling. They whispered
cheerfully of all these things during the process of matriculation,
and signed the registrar's book on a fresh page; but when Fred
had written his name under Ramsey's, and blotted it, he took the
liberty of turning over the leaf to examine some of the autographs
of their future classmates, written on the other side. Then he
uttered an exclamation, more droll than dolorous, though it affected
to be wholly the latter; for the shock to Fred was by no means
so painful as it was to his friend.</p>

<p>Ramsey leaned forward and read the name indicated by Fred's forefinger.</p>

<p><em>Dora Yocum.</em></p>

<p>...When they got back to their pleasant quarters at Mrs. Meig's,
facing the campus, Ramsey was still unable to talk of anything
except the lamentable discovery; nor were his companion's burlesquing
efforts to console him of great avail, though Fred did become
serious enough to point out that a university was different from
a high school.</p>

<p>"It's not like havin' to use one big room as a headquarters,
you know, Ramsey. Everything's all split up, and she might happen
not to be in a single of your classes."</p>

<p>"You don't know my luck!" the afflicted boy protested. "I wish
I'd gone to Harvard, the way my father wanted me to. Why, this
is just the worst nuisance I ever struck! You'll see! She'll be
in everything there is, just the way she was back home."</p>

<p>He appeared to be corroborated by the events of the next day,
when they attended the first meeting to organize the new class.
The masculine element predominated, but Dora Yocum was elected
vice-president. "You see?" Ramsey said. "Didn't I tell you? You
see what happens?"</p>

<p>But after that she ceased for a time to intrude upon his life,
and he admitted that his harassment was less grave than he had
anticipated. There were about five hundred students in the freshman
class; he seldom saw her, and when he did it was not more than
a distant glimpse of her on one of the campus paths, her thoughtful
head bent over a book as she hurried to a classroom. This was
bearable; and in the flattering agitations of being sought, and
even hunted, by several "fraternities"  simultaneously desirous
of his becoming a sworn Brother, he almost forgot her. After a
hazardous month the roommates fell into the arms of the last "frat"
to seek them, and having undergone an evening of outrage which
concluded with touching rhetoric and an oath taken at midnight,
they proudly wore jewelled symbols on their breasts and were free
to turn part of their attention to other affairs, especially the
affairs of the Eleven.</p>

<p>However, they were instructed by the older brethren of their
Order, whose duty it was to assist in the proper manoeuvring of
their young careers, that, although support of the 'varsity teams
was important, they must neglect neither the spiritual nor the
intellectual by-products of undergraduate doings. Therefore they
became members of the college <em>Y.M.C.A. </em>and of the "Lumen
Society."</p>

<p>According to the charter which it had granted itself, the "Lumen
Society" was an "Organization of male and female students"&mdash;so
"advanced" was this university&mdash;"for the development of the powers
of debate and oratory, intellectual and sociological progress,
and the discussion of all matters relating to philosophy, metaphysics,
literature, art, and current events." A statement so formidable
was not without a hushing effect upon Messrs. Milholland and Mitchell;
they went to their first "Lumen" meeting in a state of fear and
came away little reassured.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get up there," Ramsey declared, "I couldn't stand
up there before all that crowd and make a speech, or debate in
a debate, to save my soul and gizzard! Why, I'd just keel right
over and haf to be carried out."</p>

<p>"Well, the way I understand it," said Fred, "we can't get out
of it. The seniors in the 'frat' said we had to join, and they
said we couldn't resign, either, after we had joined. They said
we just had to go through it, and after a while we'd get used
to it and not mind it much."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> will!" Ramsey insisted. "I couldn't any more stand
up there on my feet and get to spoutin' about sociology and the
radical metempsychorus of the metaphysical bazoozum than I could
fly a flyin' machine. Why, I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that wasn't anything," Fred interrupted. "The only one that
talked like that, he was that Blickens; he's a tutor, or something,
and really a member of the faculty. Most o' the others just kind
of blah-blahhed around, and what any of 'em tried to get off their
chests hardly amounted to terribly much."</p>

<p>"I don't care. I couldn't do it at <em>all!</em>"</p>

<p>"Well, the way it looks to me," Fred observed, "we simply <em>got</em>
to! From what they tell me, the freshmen got to do more than anybody.
Every other Friday night, it's all freshmen and nothin' else.
You get a postal card on Monday morning in your mail, and it says
'Assignment' on it, and then it's got written underneath what
you haf to do the next Friday night&mdash;oration or debate, or maybe
just read from some old book or something. I guess we got to stand
up there and <em>try</em>, anyway."</p>

<p>"All right," said Ramsey. "If they want me to commit suicide
they can send me one o' their ole 'Assignments.' I won't need
to commit suicide, though, I guess. All I'll do, I'll just fall
over in a fit, and stay in it."</p>

<p>And, in truth, when he received his first "Assignment," one Monday
morning, a month later, he seemed in a fair way to fulfil his
prophecy. The attention of his roommate, who sat at a window of
their study, was attracted by sounds of strangulation.</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter, Ramsey?"</p>

<p>"Look! Look at <em>this!</em>"</p>

<p>Fred took the card and examined it with an amazement gradually
merging into a pleasure altogether too perceptible:</p>

<p><em>ASSIGNMENT</em></p>

<p><em>TWELVE-MINUTE DEBATE, CLASS OF 1918. </em><em>Subject, Resolved:</em>
That Germany is both legally and morally justified in her invasion
of Belgium.</p>

<p>(Debaters are notified that each will be held strictly to the
following schedule: Affirmative, 4 min., first. Negative, 4 min.,
first. Affirm, 2 min., second. Neg., 2 min., second.)</p>

<p>Affirmative Negative R. <em>MILHOLLAND, '18 D. YOCUM, '18</em></p>

<p>Concluding his reading, which was oral, the volatile Mitchell
made use of his voice in a manner of heathenish boisterousness,
and presently reclined upon a lounge to laugh the better. His
stricken comrade, meanwhile, recovered so far as to pace the floor.
"I'm goin' to pack up and light out for home!" he declared, over
and over. And even oftener he read and reread the card to make
sure of the actuality of that fatal coincidence, "D. Yocum, '18."</p>
