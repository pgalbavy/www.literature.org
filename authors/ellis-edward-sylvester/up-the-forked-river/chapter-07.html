<p>Through the hot pulsing of the tropical midnight, with its myriad
throbbings of animal life, came the sound of husky coughing, steadily
growing more distinct, until the two men seated on the outside
of the native hut, on a fallen tree, smoking and listening, identified
it as the voice of the Atlamalcan tugboat, named for its owner,
<em>General Yozarro</em>. In the vivid moonlight, a dim mass assumed
form up the river, the sparks tumbling from its small smokestack
helping to locate the craft, which constituted the navy of the
little Tabascan republic. The puffing grew louder, the throbbing
of the screw, and the rush of the foamy water from the bow struck
the ear more clearly, and the outlines of the craft were marked
as it rushed past, near the middle of the river, with the starred,
triangular flag of Atlamalco wiggling from the staff which upreared
itself like a needle from the stern.</p>

<p>In the flood of illumination every part of the vessel was plainly
seen: the wheelhouse and even the outlines of the captain at the
wheel, the upper deck, the gleam of the one cannon at the front
near the pile of wood, and the other at the rear, as well as the
forms of several men in sombreros lounging here and there, as
if playing the part of sentinels, though there was no earthly
call for any service of that nature.</p>

<p>So distinct was everything, that Major Starland saw the Captain
reach upward, grasp a cord and pull down. The hoarse throb of
the steam whistle awoke the echoes along shore and as it rolled
through the forests and jungles caused hundreds of denizens of
the solitude to wonder what sort of new beast was coming among
them.</p>

<p>Gradually the boat grew hazy and indistinct, but the throbbing
of the engine and the soft wash of the current lingered long after
the craft itself had faded from view.</p>

<p>"It may be that President Yozarro is afraid President Bambos
will forget he has a navy," suggested the American.</p>

<p>"He does not mean to attack him, I am sure."</p>

<p>"He has no cause for doing so, which is generally the reason
why these wasps sting their neighbors. If they waited for a just
cause there would be eternal peace. Ah, my yacht is not due for
several days! I would it were here."</p>

<p>"What would you do, Major?"</p>

<p>"Declare on the side of General Bambos; I shouldn't ask better
sport than to blow that crab out of the water."</p>

<p>"Is General Bambos a better friend of yours, Major, than General
Yozarro?"</p>

<p>"I count neither as a friend, but Yozarro has my sister as his
guest, though she has overstayed her time. I may be wrong, but
I am not convinced that she is a willing visitor."</p>

<p>"He holds also the gunboat that we saw pass but a short time
ago."</p>

<p>"And I have a yacht with a single gun; with that my crew would
make as short work of the <em>General Yozarro</em> as we did with
the Spanish fleets at Manila and Santiago."</p>

<p>Captain Guzman shrugged his shoulders and smoked in silence.</p>

<p>"My boat will be here in two or three days. Then I shall ask
no help from Bambos or any one else in this part of the world."</p>

<p>"Why not wait, Major? Who knows that if your sister is restored
to you through the help of General Bambos, you may not have to
ask General Yozarro to help you make <em>him</em> give her up?"</p>

<p>It was a contingency of which Major Starland had not thought.
Prudence told him to be patient till the coming of the <em>Warrenia</em>,
with her crew of a dozen men, beside the captain. Three of the
crew had fought against Spain and would welcome a scrap with the
Atlamalcan navy.</p>

<p>But the American was restless. He carried a pretext for calling
upon General Yozarro, and his anxiety would not allow him to remain
quiescent. That night as he slept in the hammock which he had
brought from his boat and swung in front of the native hut, he
heard as in a dream, the puffing of the tug on its return to Atlamalco.
He did not rouse himself to look at her, as she glided past in
the moonlight, but it was a great relief to know that she had
gone back. President Yozarro was so proud of his navy that most
of the voyages up and down the Rio Rubio were taken for his personal
pleasure. He would be at home, therefore, on the morrow when his
American visitor presented himself.</p>

<p>And such was the case. The forenoon was no more than half gone,
when the small sailing craft rounded to at the wharf in front
of the native town, and Major Starland leaped ashore. It was agreed
that Captain Guzman should await his return to the pier. The alert
American noted everything. The tug seemed to be crouching beside
the wharf, a hundred feet distant, like a bull dog waiting for
some one to venture nigh enough for him to leap forward and bury
his fangs in his throat. But no steam was up, and the war craft,
like everything else, was adrowse and sleeping.</p>

<p>The city of Atlamalco sprawled over half a square mile, the most
ancient dwellings being made of adobe, squat of form and with
only a single story. The more pretentious were of a species of
bamboo, of large proportions, and, although divided into a number
of apartments, they too consisted of but a single story, like
most houses in an earthquake country. They were of flimsy make,
for the climate was generally oppressive, and the narrow streets
were fitted only for the passage of footmen and animals with their
burdens. The swarthy, untidy inhabitants are among the laziest
on earth, for, where nature is so lavish, the necessity for laborious
toil is wanting. The avenues leading to the wharf slope gently
upward, winding in and out, and mingling in seemingly inextricable
confusion.</p>

<p>Pen cannot describe the vegetable exuberance of this portion
of South America. Sugar, coffee, cocoa, rice, tobacco, maize,
wheat, ginger, mandioc, yams, sarsaparilla, and tropical fruits
beyond enumeration smother one another in the fierce fight for
life. The chief dependence of the people is upon mandioc, manioc,
or cassava, which the natives accept as a direct gift from the
prophet Sun√®. This, however, is not the place to dwell upon the
endless variety of trees and the fauna and flora of that extraordinary
country.</p>

<p>Major Starland left his rifle in charge of Captain Guzman, and,
with his revolver at command, strolled up the main street. The
hottest part of the day being near, few of the people were astir
or visible. Most of them were asleep within doors, their siesta
beginning before the mid-day meal and lasting long afterward.</p>

<p>A single pony came stumbling forward at the first turn of the
street, so heaped over with bundles that little more than his
head, ears and front legs below the knees were in sight. His driver,
swarthy, long-haired, and in sombrero, slouched at the side of
the animal, whacking his haunches now and then, swearing at him
in mongrel Spanish, to both of which the brute paid no more heed
than to the tiny flies that nipped in vain at his armor-like hide.</p>
