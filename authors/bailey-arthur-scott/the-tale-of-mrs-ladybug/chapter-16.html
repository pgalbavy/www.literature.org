<p>FARMER GREEN'S apple trees looked green and flourishing. Thanks to Mrs.
Ladybug--and some of her relations--there was scarcely an insect left on
the leaves. And since there was no more work to be done in the orchard
just then, and nothing for her to eat, Mrs. Ladybug settled among the
raspberry bushes near the duck pond. She said that they needed her
attention.
</p>
<p>One day she paused in her labors, feeling that she had earned a few
minutes' rest. And she dropped out of the bushes and strayed close to
the water's edge.
</p><p>A light breeze ruffled the surface of the duck pond into tiny waves.
</p><p>"What a terrible, rough sea there is to-day!" Mrs. Ladybug murmured as
she gazed upon the troubled water. "Perhaps, if I cling to a tall grass
stalk, I can get a better view of it."
</p><p>She soon found a stalk that grew high above all the rest. Crawling to
the very top of it Mrs. Ladybug was able to look far out over the face
of the pond.
</p><p>"Goodness!" she said to herself. "I'm glad I'm not out there in a ship."
</p><p>A few moments later she happened to glance down near the shore. And
there, to her horror, she beheld a frog.
</p><p>He was not a big frog. On the contrary, he was the tiniest frog that
Mrs. Ladybug had ever seen. He was sitting on a lily pad, singing with a
small, shrill voice, which sounded exactly as if you were tapping two
marbles together.
</p><p>Now, Mrs. Ladybug had all her life stood in great fear of frogs. She
didn't dare move, as she gazed at this one with eyes that popped almost
out of her head.
</p><p>He was a brownish person, with a yellow throat which he puffed out like
a bag as he sang. And his skin was so rough that Mrs. Ladybug shuddered
as she looked at it. Her own was very, very smooth.
</p><p>All at once the frog looked up and spied Mrs. Ladybug staring at him.
</p><p>She would have shrieked--had she been able to.
</p><p>Then Mrs. Ladybug did the thing that she always did whenever she had a
great fright. She played dead. She pulled her feet under her body, out
of sight, and stuck, motionless, to the grass stalk.
</p><p>Nothing happened. And she was about to take another sly look at the
frog when something moved the stalk of grass. It was only the wind. But
Mrs. Ladybug didn't know that. She was sure that the frog had touched
it.
</p><p>Then Mrs. Ladybug played her next trick. She let go of the stalk and
dropped to the ground, where she lay upon her side as if she would never
move again.
</p><p>Once more she kept quite still. And since nobody disturbed her, after a
time she opened her eyes.
</p><p>She found herself looking straight into those of the tiny frog, who
still sat upon his lily pad in the duck pond.
</p><p>Mrs. Ladybug shut her eyes instantly. She only hoped that the frog
hadn't noticed her action.
