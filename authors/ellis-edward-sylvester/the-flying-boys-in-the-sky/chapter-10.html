<p>The morning dawned clear, mild and bright. Harvey and Bohunkus
were astir at an early hour and filled the tank with gasoline
and replenished the supply of oil. An examination of the aeroplane
was made and every wire, brace, lever and appurtenance found,
so far as could be judged, in perfect condition. The two went
back to the house where an excellent meal was awaiting them. Harvey
slipped so liberal a fee into the hands of the woman that she
was delighted and showed it to her husband, who grinned appreciatively.
It may be said that he earned the extra pay through a valuable
suggestion to the aviator,—one that was effective and so simple
that it was strange it had not been thought of before.</p>

<p>"You tell me," said Abisha, "that when one of them things is
ready to start on its flight, you hold it until the propeller
has got its grip and then let it go with a jump."</p>

<p>"Something like that is the practice."</p>

<p>"When there’s only two of you, how do you manage it?"</p>

<p>"The only way is to start the thing, with Bunk in his seat; I
run alongside for a few steps and spring into my seat."</p>

<p>"You might slip and let the aeroplane get away from you. Then
Bunk would be thrown out on his head."</p>

<p>"He wouldn’t be hurt if he landed that way," replied Harvey with
a laugh, "but he might alight on his shins and that would be bad."</p>

<p>"Let me show you a better plan."</p>

<p>Abisha strode to the woodpile and came back with a long, strong
stick. He set one end in the ground, with the upper inclined against
the footboard. The prop thus gained held the biplane immovable
before a strong push.</p>

<p>"Let her shove all she wants to," explained the man, "and when
you’re ready, kick the stick aside."</p>

<p>"The scheme could not be better," said Harvey admiringly, as
he made sure that the point in contact with the machine could
not injure it. He seated himself and Abisha swung the propeller
around; the engine instantly responded with its deafening roar
and a powerful thrust was exerted against the prop. In a few minutes,
the youth leaned over, grasped the stick and swung it aside. The
machine made a bound like a runner starting on a race, spun over
the ground for a hundred feet or more, and then in obedience to
the upturned rudder in front, leaped clear of the ground. She
was off.</p>

<p>Harvey glanced back. In the door was the smiling housewife, with
her husband on the spot where he stood when the flight began.
He waved his hand in salutation and the two aviators responded.</p>

<p>This is a good place in which to give the explanation that must
be made in order to understand how it came about that these two
youths were so far from home, and engaged upon the outing that
was destined to prove the most memorable in the life at least
of one of them.</p>

<p>Harvey Hamilton was the son of a wealthy merchant, whose business
took him to New York every week-day morning. The youth was preparing
to enter Princeton University, and his elder brother Dick was
a student in Yale. In the beginning of the summer the family separated,
each member indulging his or her taste in the way of vacation,
with the parent glad to pay the bills. The mother and daughter
Mildred went to the White Mountains, Dick to the Adirondacks with
a party of students, while Harvey and his father took a jaunt
through a part of Europe, sailing home from Naples on the <em>Duca
degli Abruzzi</em>. Wife and daughter, knowing when they were
due, were at home to meet them. Dick was still in the mountains,
from which he wrote the most glowing accounts of his life in camp
and conquests of the gamy trout that are still to be found in
the cool streams.</p>

<p>On the homeward passage, Harvey and his father were lucky enough
to meet the noted German aviator, Ostrom Sperbeck, of whom we
have heard already.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton explained to the Professor that his son Harvey with
the assistance of the colored youth, who was "bound out" to a
neighbor, were at work on an aeroplane with which they hoped to
fly, but the Professor warned them against it.</p>

<p>"It is too dangerous; some of the best aviators have lost their
lives and you know that one of the Wright brothers came within
a hair of being killed. Encourage your son, if you wish, in the
sport, for those who are boys to-day are the ones that will make
the greatest discoveries and advances in aviation, but do not
let him take any risks that can be avoided. Buy him a first-class
machine and forbid him to use any other."</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton was impressed with the advice and acted upon it.</p>

<p>Bohunkus Johnson was as ardent as his young friend, but, lacking
his mental brightness, was not given charge of the aeroplane,
though promised a chance of trying his hand later on.</p>

<p>So much having been told, it will be understood how on a pleasant
summer day, Harvey and Bohunkus started on their outing, with
permission to be gone several weeks, though their expectation
was to return in the course of ten days or so.</p>

<p>Several facts will be borne in mind. Nothing not deemed absolutely
necessary was taken with the aviators. Inasmuch as they could
not stay more than two hours in the air, without replenishing
their supply of fuel, they carried no food, nor were any weapons
taken along, for it was not probable they would ever need anything
of the kind. Although Harvey headed toward a spur of the Alleghany
Mountains, with the object of relieving what promised to become
a monotonous experience at times, it did not seem possible that
they would ever run into personal danger from that cause. He carried
a pair of binoculars held by a strap over one shoulder, for such
an instrument was likely to prove useful in their voyages through
the air.</p>

<p>Harvey ascended for a fourth of a mile, and Bohunkus shuddered
at the thought of plunging again into the arctic regions, but
his friend lowered the front rudder and they skimmed away on a
level. The view was as entrancing as ever, with cities, towns,
villages, scattered houses, stretches of wood and cultivated country,
winding streams, puffing engines pulling trains that looked like
insignificant toys, and the gleam of what seemed to be a lake
of several miles area in the distance. The wanderer through the
finest picture galleries in Europe can become sated with the numberless
master-pieces, and wonderful as was the unfolding panorama, the
youths grew tired of its splendid sameness. When they gazed at
the earth it was without any clear impression of what they saw.</p>

<p>Far to the westward loomed a mountain, the outlines showing a
dim blue haze against the summer sky. Harvey had fixed the elevation
in his mind before leaving home and, it was his intention to sail
over the summit into the more unsettled country beyond. As near
as he could judge the range was about twenty miles distant.</p>

<p>"I can easily make it in an hour," he reflected, "and not hurry."</p>

<p>He was traveling at a moderate pace, for he did not like to impose
a strain upon the machine by pressing it to the limit. There was
no call for hurry, and after clearing the elevation he could land
at some town and buy what gasoline he needed. He shifted the course
of the aeroplane slightly, and descended until within two or three
hundred feet of the earth. There were no tall buildings to be
avoided, and none of the trees that showed were lofty enough to
interfere. Bohunkus sat in his usual seat, idly grasping the supports,
for the progress was so smooth that he might have folded his arms
without risk, always provided the aeroplane did not collide with
any of the fierce aerial gyrations, which are so dangerous to
aviators, because being invisible, no precaution can be taken
against them.</p>

<p>Harvey slackened his speed still more, and coursed easily forward,
crossed a winding creek, and was skimming toward a moderate stretch
of woods, when he noticed a man standing on the margin and watching
the aeroplane. The fact that he held a gun in one hand did not
concern the youth, who, prompted by the spirit of mischief natural
in one of his years, dropped still lower and headed for the man,
as if he meant to crash into him.</p>

<p>The stranger, instead of turning about and dashing into the wood
where he would have been safe from pursuit, suddenly raised his
double-barreled shot gun and let fly with both charges. Nothing
of the kind had been dreamed of, either by Harvey or his companion,
and they were startled indeed when they heard the shot rattle
through the wires and framework of the machine. One of the pellets
nipped the cheek of Harvey and Bohunkus yelled,</p>

<p>"I’m shot all to pieces, Harv!"</p>

<p>Harvey turned his head in affright, but saw no evidence that
the other had been harmed in the least. The man, seeing that his
hasty aim had been ineffective, began hastily to reload his weapon
with the evident purpose of doing execution next time. </p>
