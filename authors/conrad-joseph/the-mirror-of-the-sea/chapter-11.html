<p> Indeed, it is less than nothing, and I have seen, when the great
soul of the world turned over with a heavy sigh, a perfectly new,
extra-stout foresail vanish like a bit of some airy stuff much
lighter than gossamer. Then was the time for the tall spars to
stand fast in the great uproar. The machinery must do its work
even if the soul of the world has gone mad.</p>

<p>The modern steamship advances upon a still and overshadowed sea
with a pulsating tremor of her frame, an occasional clang in her
depths, as if she had an iron heart in her iron body; with a thudding
rhythm in her progress and the regular beat of her propeller,
heard afar in the night with an august and plodding sound as of
the march of an inevitable future.  But in a gale, the silent
machinery of a sailing-ship would catch not only the power, but
the wild and exulting voice of the world’s soul.  Whether she
ran with her tall spars swinging, or breasted it with her tall
spars lying over, there was always that wild song, deep like a
chant, for a bass to the shrill pipe of the wind played on the
sea-tops, with a punctuating crash, now and then, of a breaking
wave.  At times the weird effects of that invisible orchestra
would get upon a man’s nerves till he wished himself deaf.</p>

<p>And this recollection of a personal wish, experienced upon several
oceans, where the soul of the world has plenty of room to turn
over with a mighty sigh, brings me to the remark that in order
to take a proper care of a ship’s spars it is just as well for
a seaman to have nothing the matter with his ears.  Such is the
intimacy with which a seaman had to live with his ship of yesterday
that his senses were like her senses, that the stress upon his
body made him judge of the strain upon the ship’s masts.</p>

<p>I had been some time at sea before I became aware of the fact
that hearing plays a perceptible part in gauging the force of
the wind.  It was at night.  The ship was one of those iron wool-clippers
that the Clyde had floated out in swarms upon the world during
the seventh decade of the last century.  It was a fine period
in ship-building, and also, I might say, a period of over-masting. 
The spars rigged up on the narrow hulls were indeed tall then,
and the ship of which I think, with her coloured-glass skylight
ends bearing the motto, "Let Glasgow Flourish," was certainly
one of the most heavily-sparred specimens.  She was built for
hard driving, and unquestionably she got all the driving she could
stand.  Our captain was a man famous for the quick passages he
had been used to make in the old <em>Tweed</em>, a ship famous
the world over for her speed.  The <em>Tweed</em> had been a wooden
vessel, and he brought the tradition of quick passages with him
into the iron clipper.  I was the junior in her, a third mate,
keeping watch with the chief officer; and it was just during one
of the night watches in a strong, freshening breeze that I overheard
two men in a sheltered nook of the main deck exchanging these
informing remarks.  Said one:</p>

<p>"Should think ’twas time some of them light sails were coming
off her."</p>

<p>And the other, an older man, uttered grumpily: "No fear! not
while the chief mate’s on deck.  He’s that deaf he can’t tell
how much wind there is."</p>

<p>And, indeed, poor P—, quite young, and a smart seaman, was very
hard of hearing.  At the same time, he had the name of being the
very devil of a fellow for carrying on sail on a ship.  He was
wonderfully clever at concealing his deafness, and, as to carrying
on heavily, though he was a fearless man, I don’t think that he
ever meant to take undue risks.  I can never forget his naïve
sort of astonishment when remonstrated with for what appeared
a most dare-devil performance.  The only person, of course, that
could remonstrate with telling effect was our captain, himself
a man of dare-devil tradition; and really, for me, who knew under
whom I was serving, those were impressive scenes.  Captain S—
had a great name for sailor-like qualities—the sort of name that
compelled my youthful admiration.  To this day I preserve his
memory, for, indeed, it was he in a sense who completed my training. 
It was often a stormy process, but let that pass.  I am sure he
meant well, and I am certain that never, not even at the time,
could I bear him malice for his extraordinary gift of incisive
criticism.  And to hear <em>him</em> make a fuss about too much
sail on the ship seemed one of those incredible experiences that
take place only in one’s dreams.</p>

<p>It generally happened in this way: Night, clouds racing overhead,
wind howling, royals set, and the ship rushing on in the dark,
an immense white sheet of foam level with the lee rail.  Mr. P—,
in charge of the deck, hooked on to the windward mizzen rigging
in a state of perfect serenity; myself, the third mate, also hooked
on somewhere to windward of the slanting poop, in a state of the
utmost preparedness to jump at the very first hint of some sort
of order, but otherwise in a perfectly acquiescent state of mind. 
Suddenly, out of the companion would appear a tall, dark figure,
bareheaded, with a short white beard of a perpendicular cut, very
visible in the dark—Captain S—, disturbed in his reading down
below by the frightful bounding and lurching of the ship. Leaning
very much against the precipitous incline of the deck, he would
take a turn or two, perfectly silent, hang on by the compass for
a while, take another couple of turns, and suddenly burst out:</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do with the ship?"</p>

<p>And Mr. P—, who was not good at catching what was shouted in
the wind, would say interrogatively:</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>Then in the increasing gale of the sea there would be a little
private ship’s storm going on in which you could detect strong
language, pronounced in a tone of passion and exculpatory protestations
uttered with every possible inflection of injured innocence.</p>

<p>"By Heavens, Mr. P-!  I used to carry on sail in my time, but—"</p>

<p>And the rest would be lost to me in a stormy gust of wind.</p>

<p>Then, in a lull, P—’s protesting innocence would become audible:</p>

<p>"She seems to stand it very well."</p>

<p>And then another burst of an indignant voice:</p>

<p>"Any fool can carry sail on a ship—"</p>

<p>And so on and so on, the ship meanwhile rushing on her way with
a heavier list, a noisier splutter, a more threatening hiss of
the white, almost blinding, sheet of foam to leeward.  For the
best of it was that Captain S— seemed constitutionally incapable
of giving his officers a definite order to shorten sail; and so
that extraordinarily vague row would go on till at last it dawned
upon them both, in some particularly alarming gust, that it was
time to do something.  There is nothing like the fearful inclination
of your tall spars overloaded with canvas to bring a deaf man
and an angry one to their senses.</p>
