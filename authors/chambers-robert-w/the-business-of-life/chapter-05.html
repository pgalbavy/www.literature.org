<p>On Monday, Desboro waited all the morning for her, meeting every
train. At noon, she had not arrived. Finally, he called up her
office and was informed that Miss Nevers had been detained in
town on business, and that their Mr. Kirk had telephoned him that
morning to that effect.</p>

<p>He asked to speak to Miss Nevers personally; she had gone out,
it appeared, and might not return until the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>So Desboro went home in his car and summoned Farris, the aged
butler, who was pottering about in the greenhouses, which he much
preferred to attending to his own business.</p>

<p>"Did anybody telephone this morning?" asked the master.</p>

<p>Farris had forgotten to mention it&mdash;was very sorry&mdash;and stood
like an aged hound, head partly lowered and averted, already blinking
under the awaited reprimand. But all Desboro said was:</p>

<p>"Don't do it again, Farris; there are some things I won't overlook."</p>

<p>He sat for a while in the library where a sheaf of her notes
lay on the table beside a pile of books &mdash;Grenville, Vanderdyne,
Herrara's splendid folios&mdash;just as she had left them on Saturday
afternoon for the long, happy sleigh-ride that ended just in time
for him to swing her aboard her train.</p>

<p>He had plenty to do beside sitting there with keen, gray eyes
fixed on the pile of manuscript she had left unfinished; he always
had plenty to do, and seldom did it.</p>

<p>His first impulse had been to go to town. Her absence was making
the place irksome. He went to the long windows and stood there,
hands in his pockets, smoking and looking out over the familiar
landscape&mdash;a rolling country, white with snow, naked branches
glittering with ice under the gilded blue of a cloudless sky,
and to the north and west, low, wooded mountains&mdash;really nothing
more than hills, but impressively steep and blue in the distance.</p>

<p>A woodpecker, one of the few feathered winter residents, flickered
through the trees, flashed past, and clung to an oak, sticking
motionless to the bark for a minute or two, bright eyes inspecting
Desboro, before beginning a rapid, jerky exploration for sustenance.</p>

<p>The master of Silverwood watched him, then, hands driven deeper
into his pockets, strolled away, glancing aimlessly at familiar
objects&mdash;the stiff and rather picturesque portraits of his grandparents
in the dress of 1820; the atrocious portraits of his parents in
the awful costume of 1870; his own portrait, life size, mounted
on a pony.</p>

<p>He stood looking at the funny little boy, with the half contemptuous,
half curious interest which a man in the pride of his strength
and youth sometimes feels for the absurdly clothed innocence of
what he was. And, as usual when noticing the picture, he made
a slight, involuntary effort to comprehend that he had been once
like that; and could not.</p>

<p>At the end of the library, better portraits hung&mdash;his great-grandmother,
by Gilbert Stuart, still fresh-coloured and clear under the dim
yellow varnish which veiled but could not wither the delicate
complexion and ardent mouth, and the pink rosebud set where the
folds of her white kerchief crossed on her breast.</p>

<p>And there was her husband, too, by an unknown or forgotten painter&mdash;the
sturdy member of the Provincial Assembly, and major in Colonel
Thomas's Westchester Regiment&mdash;a fine old fellow in his queue-ribbon
and powdered hair standing in the conventional fortress port-hole,
framed by it, and looking straight out of the picture with eyes
so much like Desboro's that it amused people. His easy attitude,
too, the idle grace of the posture, irresistibly recalled Desboro,
and at the moment more than ever. But he had been a man of vigour
and of wit and action; and he was lying out there in the snow,
under an old brown headstone embellished with cherubim; and the
last of his name lounged here, in sight, from the windows, of
the spot where the first house of Desboro in America had stood,
and had collapsed amid the flames started by Tarleton's blood-maddened
troopers.</p>

<p>To and fro sauntered Desboro, passing, unnoticed, old-time framed
engravings of the Desboros in Charles the Second's time, elegant,
idle, handsome men in periwigs and half-armour, and all looking
out at the world through port-holes with a hint of the race's
bodily grace in their half insolent attitudes.</p>

<p>But office and preferment, peace and war, intrigue and plot,
vigour and idleness, had narrowed down through the generations
into a last inheritance for this young man; and the very last
of all the Desboros now idled aimlessly among the phantoms of
a race that perhaps had better be extinguished.</p>

<p>He could not make up his mind to go to town or to remain in the
vague hope that she might come in the afternoon.</p>

<p>He had plenty to do&mdash;if he could make up his mind to begin&mdash;accounts
to go over, household expenses, farm expenses, stable reports,
agents' memoranda concerning tenants and leases, endless lists
of necessary repairs. And there was business concerning the estate
neglected, taxes, loans, improvements to attend to&mdash;the thousand
and one details which irritated him to consider; but which, although
he maintained an agent in town, must ultimately come to himself
for the final verdict.</p>

<p>What he wanted was to be rid of it all&mdash;sell everything, pension
his father's servants, and be rid of the entire complex business
which, he pretended to himself, was slowly ruining him. But he
knew in his heart where the trouble lay, and that the carelessness,
extravagance, the disinclination for self-denial, the impatient
and good-humoured aversion to economy, the profound distaste for
financial detail, were steadily wrecking one of the best and one
of the last of the old-time Westchester estates.</p>

<p>In his heart he knew, too, that all he wanted was to concentrate
sufficient capital to give him the income he thought he needed.</p>

<p>No man ever had the income he thought he needed. And why Desboro
required it, he himself didn't know exactly; but he wanted sufficient
to keep him comfortable&mdash;enough so that he could feel he might
do anything he chose, when, how, and where he chose, without fear
or care for the future. And no man ever lived to enjoy such a
state of mind, or to do these things with impunity.</p>

<p>But Desboro's mind was bent on it; he seated himself at the library
table and began to figure it out. Land in Westchester brought
high prices&mdash;not exactly in that section, but near enough to make
his acreage valuable. Then, the house, stable, garage, greenhouses,
the three farms, barns, cattle houses, water supply, the timber,
power sites, meadow, pasture&mdash;all these ought to make a pretty
figure. And he jotted it down for the hundredth time in the last
two years.</p>

<p>Then there was the Desboro collection. That ought to bring&#11834;</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And he sat thinking of Jacqueline Nevers"]</p>

<p>He hesitated, his pencil finally fell on the table, rolled to
the edge and dropped; and he sat thinking of Jacqueline Nevers,
and of the week that had ended as the lights of her train faded
far away into the winter night.</p>

<p>He sat so still and so long that old Farris came twice to announce
luncheon. After a silent meal in company with the dogs and cats
of low degree, he lighted a cigarette and went back into the library
to resume his meditations.</p>

<p>Whatever they were, they ceased abruptly whenever the distant
telephone rang, and he waited almost breathlessly for somebody
to come and say that he was wanted on the wire. But the messages
must have been to the cook or butler, from butcher, baker, and
gentlemen of similar professions, for nobody disturbed him, and
he was left free to sink back into the leather corner of the lounge
and continue his meditations. Once the furtive apparition of Mrs.
Quant disturbed him, hovering ominously at the library door, bearing
tumbler and spoon.</p>

<p>"I won't take it," he said decisively.</p>

<p>There was a silence, then:</p>

<p>"Isn't the young lady coming, Mr. James?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. No, probably not to-day."</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is the child sick?" she stammered.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. I expect she'll be here in the morning."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>She was not there in the morning. Mr. Mirk, the little old salesman
in the silk skull-cap, telephoned to Farris that Miss Nevers was
again detained in town on business at Mr. Clydesdale's, and that
she might employ a Mr. Sissly to continue her work at Silverwood,
if Mr. Desboro did not object. Mr. Desboro was to call her up
at three o'clock if he desired further information.</p>

<p>Desboro went into the library and sat down. For a while his idle
reflections, uncontrolled, wandered around the main issue, errant
satellites circling a central thought which was slowly emerging
from chaos and taking definite weight and shape. And the thought
was of Jacqueline Nevers.</p>

<p>Why was he waiting here until noon to talk to this girl? Why
was he here at all? Why had he not gone South with the others?
A passing fancy might be enough to arouse his curiosity; but why
did not the fancy pass? What did he want to say to her? What did
he want of her? Why was he spending time thinking about her&mdash;disarranging
his routine and habits to be here when she came? <em>What</em>
did he want of her? She was agreeable to talk to, interesting
to watch, pretty, attractive. Did he want her friendship? To what
end? He'd never see her anywhere unless he sought her out; he
would never meet her in any circle to which he had been accustomed,
respectable or otherwise. Besides, for conversation he preferred
men to women.</p>

<p>What did he want with her or her friendship&mdash;or her blue eyes
and bright hair&mdash;or the slim, girlish grace of her? What was there
to do? How many more weeks did he intend to idle about at her
heels, follow her, look at her, converse with her, make a habit
of her until, now, he found that to suddenly break the habit of
only a week's indulgence was annoying him!</p>

<p>And suppose the habit were to grow. Into what would it grow?
And how unpleasant would it be to break when, in the natural course
of events, circumstances made the habit inconvenient?</p>

<p>And, always, the main, central thought was growing, persisting.
<em>What</em> did he want of her? He was not in love with her
any more than he was always lightly in love with feminine beauty.
Besides, if he were, what would it mean? Another affair, with
all its initial charm and gaiety, its moments of frivolity, its
moments of seriousness, its sudden crisis, its combats, perplexities,
irresolution, the faint thrill of its deeper significance startling
both to clearer vision; and then the end, whatever it might be,
light or solemn, irresponsible or care-ridden, gay or sombre,
for one or the other.</p>

<p>What did he want? Did he wish to disturb her tranquility? Was
he trying to awaken her to some response? And what did he offer
her to respond to? The flattery of his meaningless attentions,
or the honour of falling in love with a Desboro, whose left hand
only would be offered to support both slim white hands of hers?</p>

<p>He ought to have gone South, and he knew it, now. Last week he
had told himself&mdash;and her occasionally&mdash;that he was going South
in a week. And here he was, his head on his hands and his elbows
on the table, looking vacantly at the pile of manuscript she had
left there, and thinking of the things that should not happen
to them both.</p>

<p>And who the devil was this fellow Sissly? Why had she suddenly
changed her mind and suggested a creature named Sissly? Why didn't
she finish the cataloguing herself? She had been enthusiastic
about it. Besides, she had enjoyed the skating and sleighing,
and the luncheons and teas, and the cats and dogs&mdash;and even Mrs.
Quant. She had said so, too. And now she was too busy to come
any more.</p>

<p>Had he done anything? Had he been remiss, or had he ventured
too many attentions? He couldn't recall having done anything except
to show her plainly enough that he enjoyed being with her. Nor
had she concealed her bright pleasure in his companionship. And
they had become such good comrades, understanding each other's
moods so instinctively now&mdash;and they had really found such unfeigned
amusement in each other that it seemed a pity&mdash;a pity&#11834;</p>

<p>"Damn it," he said, "if she cares no more about it than that,
she can send Sissly, and I'll go South!"</p>

<p>But the impatience of hurt vanity died away; the desire to see
her grew; the habit of a single week was already unpleasant to
break. And it would be unpleasant to try to forget her, even among
his own friends, even in the South, or in drawing-rooms, or at
the opera, or at dances, or in any of his haunts and in any sort
of company.</p>

<p>He might forget her if he had only known her better, discovered
more of her real self, unveiled a little of her deeper nature.
There was so much unexplored&mdash;so much that interested him, mainly,
perhaps, because he had not discovered it. For theirs had been
the lightest and gayest of friendships, with nothing visible to
threaten a deeper entente; merely, on her part, a happy enjoyment
and a laughing parrying in the eternal combat that never entirely
ends, even when it means nothing. And on his side it had been
the effortless attentions of a man aware of her young and unspoiled
charm&mdash;conscious of an unusual situation which always fascinates
all men.</p>

<p>He had had no intention, no idea, no policy except to drift as
far as the tides of destiny carried him in her company. The situation
was agreeable; if it became less so, he could take to the oars
and row where he liked.</p>

<p>But the tides had carried him to the edge of waters less clear;
he was vaguely aware of it now, aware, too, that troubled seas
lay somewhere behind the veil.</p>

<p>The library clock struck three times. He got up and went to the
telephone booth. Miss Nevers was there; would speak to him if
he could wait a moment. He waited. Finally, a far voice called,
greeting him pleasantly, and explaining that matters which antedated
her business at Silverwood had demanded her personal attention
in town. To his request for particulars, she said that she had
work to do among the jades and Chinese porcelains belonging to
a Mr. Clydesdale.</p>

<p>"I know him," said Desboro curtly. "When do you finish?"</p>

<p>"I have finished for the present. Later there is further work
to be done at Mr. Clydesdale's. I had to make certain arrangements
before I went to you&mdash;being already under contract to Mr. Clydesdale,
and at his service when he wanted me."</p>

<p>There was a silence. Then he asked her when she was coming to
Silverwood.</p>

<p>"Did you not receive my message?" she asked.</p>

<p>"About&mdash;what's his name? Sissly? Yes, I did, but I don't want
him. I want you or nobody!"</p>

<p>"You are unreasonable, Mr. Desboro. Lionel Sissly is a very celebrated
connoisseur."</p>

<p>"Don't you want to come?"</p>

<p>"I have so many matters here&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Don't you <em>want</em> to?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I'd like to. It is most interesting work. But
Mr. Sissly&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang Mr. Sissly! Do you suppose he interests me? You said
that this work might take you weeks. You said you loved it. You
apparently expected to be busy with it until it was finished.
Now, you propose to send a man called Sissly! Why?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know that I have other things&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What have I done, Miss Nevers?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"What have I done to drive you away?"</p>

<p>"How absurd! Nothing! And you've been so kind to me&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You've been kind to me. Why are you no longer?"</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>it's a question&mdash;of business&mdash;matters which demand&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Will you come once more?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Will you?" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Is there any reason&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Another pause, then:</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll come&mdash;if there's a reason&#11834;"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Do you promise?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll meet you as usual."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>He said: "How is your skating jacket coming along?"</p>

<p>"I have&mdash;stopped work on it."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I do not expect to&mdash;have time&mdash;for skating."</p>

<p>"Didn't you ever expect to come up here again?" he asked with
a slight shiver.</p>

<p>"I thought that Mr. Sissly could do what was necessary."</p>

<p>"Didn't it occur to you that you were ending a friendship rather
abruptly?"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it was a trifle brusque, Miss Nevers?"</p>

<p>"Does the acquaintanceship of a week count so much with you,
Mr. Desboro?"</p>

<p>"You know it does."</p>

<p>"No. I did not know it. If I had supposed so, I would have written
a polite letter regretting that I could no longer personally attend
to the business in hand."</p>

<p>"Doesn't it count at all with you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Our friendship."</p>

<p>"Our acquaintanceship of a single week? Why, yes. I remember
it with pleasure&mdash;your kindness, and Mrs. Quant's&#11834;"</p>

<p>"How on earth can you talk to me that way?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand you."</p>

<p>"Then I'll say, bluntly, that it meant a lot to me, and that
the place is intolerable when you're not here. That is specific,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very. You mean that, being accustomed to having somebody to
amuse you, your own resources are insufficient."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. That is why you are kind enough to miss my coming
and going&mdash;because I amuse you."</p>

<p>"Do you think that way about me?"</p>

<p>"I do when I think of you. You know sometimes I'm thinking of
other things, too, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>He bit his lip, waited for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"If you feel that way, you'll scarcely care to come up to-morrow.
Whatever arrangement you make about cataloguing the collection
will be all right. If I am not here, communications addressed
to the Olympian Club will be forwarded&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro!"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Forgive me&mdash;won't you?"</p>

<p>There was a moment's interval, fraught heavily with the possibilities
of Chance, then the silent currents of Fate flowed on toward her
appointed destiny and his&mdash;whatever it was to be, wherever it
lay, behind the unstirring, inviolable veil.</p>

<p>"Have you forgiven me?"</p>

<p>"And you me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive; truly, I haven't. Why did you think
I had? Because I have been talking flippantly? You have been so
uniformly considerate and kind to me&mdash;you <em>must</em> know that
it was nothing you said or did that made me think&mdash;wonder&mdash;whether&mdash;perhaps&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What?" he insisted. But she declined further explanation in
a voice so different, so much gayer and happier than it had sounded
before, that he was content to let matters rest&mdash;perhaps dimly
surmising something approaching the truth.</p>

<p>She, too, noticed the difference in his voice as he said:</p>

<p>"Then may I have the car there as usual to-morrow morning?"</p>

<p>"Please."</p>

<p>He drew an unconscious sigh of relief. She said something more
that he could scarcely hear, so low and distant sounded her voice,
and he asked her to repeat it.</p>

<p>"I only said that I would be happy to go back," came the far
voice.</p>

<p>Quick, unconsidered words trembled on his lips for utterance;
perhaps fear of undoing what had been done restrained him.</p>

<p>"Not as happy as I will be to see you," he said, with an effort.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Good-bye, Mr. Desboro."</p>

<p>"Good-bye."</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The sudden accession of high spirits filled him with delightful
impatience. He ranged the house restlessly, traversing the hallway
and silent rooms. A happy inclination for miscellaneous conversation
impelled him to long-deferred interviews with people on the place.
He talked business to Mrs. Quant, to Michael, the armourer; he
put on snow-shoes and went cross lots to talk to his deaf head-farmer,
Vail. Then he came back and set himself resolutely to his accounts;
and after dinner he wrote letters, a yellow pup dozing on his
lap, a cat purring on his desk, and occasionally patting with
tentative paw the letter-paper when it rustled.</p>

<p>A mania for cleaning up matters which had accumulated took possession
of him&mdash;and it all seemed to concern, in some occult fashion,
the coming of Jacqueline on the morrow&mdash;as though he wished to
begin again with a clean slate and a conscience undisturbed. But
what he was to begin he did not specify to himself.</p>

<p>Bills&mdash;heavy ones&mdash;he paid lightly, drawing check after check
to cover necessities or extravagances, going straight through
the long list of liabilities incurred from top to bottom.</p>

<p>Later, the total troubled him, and he made himself do a thing
to which he was averse&mdash;balance his check-book. The result dismayed
him, and he sat for a while eyeing the sheets of carelessly scratched
figures, and stroking the yellow pup on his knees.</p>

<p>"What do I want with all these clubs and things?" he said impatiently.
"I never use 'em."</p>

<p>On the spur of impulse, he began to write resignations, wholesale,
ridding himself of all kinds of incumbrances&mdash;shooting clubs in
Virginia and Georgia and North Carolina, to which he had paid
dues and assessments for years, and to which he had never been;
fishing clubs in Maine and Canada and Nova Scotia and California;
New York clubs, including the Cataract, the Old Fort, the Palisades,
the Cap and Bells, keeping only the three clubs to which men of
his sort are supposed to belong&mdash;the Patroons, the Olympian, and
his college club. But everything else went&mdash;yacht clubs, riding
clubs, golf clubs, country clubs of every sort&mdash;everything except
his membership in those civic, educational, artistic, and charitable
associations to which such New York families as his owed a moral
and perpetual tribute.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the last envelope was sealed and
stamped, and he leaned back with a long, deep breath of relief.
To-morrow he would apply the axe again and lop off such extravagances
as saddle-horses in town, and the two cars he kept there. They
should go to the auction rooms; he'd sell his Long Island bungalow,
too, and the schooner and the power boats, and his hunters down
at Cedar Valley; and with them would go groom and chauffeur, captain
and mechanic, and the thousand maddening expenses that were adding
daily to a total debt that had begun secretly to appal him.</p>

<p>In his desk he knew there was an accumulated mass of unpaid bills.
He remembered them now and decided he didn't want to think about
them. Besides, he'd clear them away pretty soon&mdash;settle accounts
with tailor, bootmaker, haberdasher&mdash;with furrier, modiste and
jeweler&mdash;and a dull red settled under his cheek bones as he remembered
these latter bills, which he would scarcely care to exhibit to
the world at large.</p>

<p>"Ass that I've been," he muttered, absently stroking the yellow
pup. Which reflection started another train of thought, and he
went to a desk, unlocked it, pulled out the large drawer, and
carried it with its contents to the fireplace.</p>

<p>The ashes were still alive and the first packet of letters presently
caught fire. On them he laid a silken slipper of Mrs. Clydesdale's
and watched it shrivel and burn. Next, he tossed handfuls of unassorted
trifles, letters, fans, one or two other slippers, gloves of different
sizes, dried remnants of flowers, programmes scribbled over; and
when the rubbish burned hotly, he added photographs and more letters
without even glancing at them, except where, amid the flames,
he caught a momentary glimpse of some familiar signature, or saw
some pretty, laughing phantom of the past glow, whiten to ashes,
and evaporate.</p>

<p>Fire is a great purifier; he felt as though the flames had washed
his hands. Much edified by the moral toilet, and not concerned
that all such ablutions are entirely superficial, he watched with
satisfaction the last bit of ribbon shrivel, the last envelope
flash into flame. Then he replaced the desk drawer, leaving the
key in it&mdash;because there was now no reason why all the world and
its relatives should not rummage if they liked.</p>

<p>He remembered some letters and photographs and odds and ends
scattered about his rooms in town, and made a mental note to clear
them out of his life, too.</p>

<p>Mentally detached, he stood aloof in spirit and viewed with interest
the spectacle of his own regeneration, and calmly admired it.</p>

<p>"I'll cut out all kinds of things," he said to himself. "A devout
girl in Lent will have nothing on me. Nix for the bowl! Nix for
the fat pat hand! Throw up the sponge! Drop the asbestos curtain!"
He made pretence to open an imaginary door: "Ladies, pass out
quietly, please; the show is over."</p>

<p>The cat woke up and regarded him gravely; he said to her:</p>

<p>"You don't even need a pocket-book, do you? And you are quite
right; having things is a nuisance. The less one owns the happier
one is. Do you think I'll have sense enough to remember this to-morrow,
and not be ass enough to acquire more&mdash;a responsibility, for example?
Do you think I can be trusted to mind my business when <em>she</em>
comes to-morrow? And not say something that I'll be surely sorry
for some day&mdash;or something she'll be sorry for? Because she's
so pretty, pussy&mdash;so disturbingly pretty&mdash;and so sweet. And I
ought to know by this time that intelligence and beauty are a
deadly combination I had better let alone until I find them in
the other sort of girl. That's the trouble, pussy." He lifted
the sleepy cat and held it at arm's length, where it dangled,
purring all the while. "That's the trouble, kitty. I haven't the
slightest intentions; and as for friends, men prefer men. And
that's the truth, between you and me. It's rather rotten, isn't
it, pussy? But I'll be careful, and if I see that she is capable
of caring for me, I'll go South before it hurts either of us.
That will be the square thing to do, I suppose&mdash;and neither of
us the worse for another week together."</p>

<p>He placed the cat on the floor, where it marched to and fro with
tail erect, inviting further attentions. But Desboro walked about,
turning out the electric lights, and presently took himself off
to bed, fixed in a resolution that the coming week should be his
last with this unusual girl. For, after all, he concluded she
had not moved his facile imagination very much more than had other
girls of various sorts, whose souvenirs lay now in cinders on
his hearth, and long since had turned to ashes in his heart.</p>

<p>What was the use? Such affairs ended one way or another&mdash;but
they always ended. All he wanted to find out, all he was curious
about, was whether such an unusual girl could be moved to response&mdash;he
merely wanted to know, and then he would let her alone, and no
harm done&mdash;nothing to disturb the faint fragrance of a pretty
souvenir that he and she might carry for a while&mdash;a week or two&mdash;perhaps
a month&mdash;before they both forgot.</p>

<p>And, conscious of his good intentions, feeling tranquil, complacent,
and slightly noble, he composed himself to slumber, thinking how
much happier this world would be if men invariably behaved with
the self-control that occasionally characterised himself.</p>

<p>In the city, Jacqueline lay awake on her pillow, unable to find
a refuge in sleep from the doubts, questions, misgivings assailing
her.</p>

<p>Wearied, impatient, vexed, by turns, that her impulse and decision
should keep her sleepless&mdash;that the thought of going back to Silverwood
should so excite her, she turned restlessly in her bed, unwilling
to understand, humiliated in heart, ashamed, vaguely afraid.</p>

<p>Why should she have responded to an appeal from such a man as
Desboro? Her own calm judgment had been that they had seen enough
of each other&mdash;for the present, anyway. Because she knew, in her
scared soul, that she had not meant it to be final&mdash;that some
obscure idea remained of seeing him again, somewhere.</p>

<p>Yet, something in his voice over the wire&mdash;and something more
disturbing still when he spoke so coolly about going South&mdash;had
swayed her in her purpose to remain aloof for a while. But there
was no reason, after all, for her to take it so absurdly. She
would go once more, and then permit a long interval to elapse
before she saw him again. If she actually had, as she began to
believe, an inclination for his society, she would show herself
that she could control that inclination perfectly.</p>

<p>Why should any man venture to summon her&mdash;for it was a virtual
summons over the wire&mdash;and there had been arrogance in it, too.
His curt acquiescence in her decision, and his own arbitrary decision
to go South had startled her out of her calmly prepared rôle of
business woman. She was trying to recall exactly what she had
said to him afterward to make his voice change once more, and
her own respond so happily.</p>

<p>Why should seeing him be any unusual happiness to her&mdash;knowing
who and what he had been and was&mdash;a man of the out-world with
which she had not one thing in common&mdash;a man who could mean nothing
to her&mdash;could not even remain a friend because their two lives
would never even run within sight of each other.</p>

<p>She would never know anybody he knew. They would never meet anywhere
except at Silverwood. How could they, once the business between
them was transacted? She couldn't go to Silverwood except on business;
he would never think of coming here to see her. Could she ask
him&mdash;venture, perhaps, to invite him to dinner with some of her
friends? Which friends? Cynthia and&mdash;who else? The girls she knew
would bore him; he'd have only contempt for the men.</p>

<p>Then what did all this perplexity mean that was keeping her awake?
And why was she going back to Silverwood? Why! Why! Was it to
see with her own eyes the admiration for herself in his? She had
seen it more than once. Was it to learn more about this man and
his liking for her&mdash;to venture a guess, perhaps, as to how far
that liking might carry him with a little encouragement&mdash;which
she would not offer, of course?</p>

<p>She began to wonder how much he really did like her&mdash;how greatly
he might care if she never were to see him again. Her mind answered
her, but her heart appealed wistfully from the clear decision.</p>

<p>Lying there, blue eyes open in the darkness, head cradled on
her crossed arms, she ventured to recall his features, summoning
them shyly out of space; and she smiled, feeling the tension subtly
relaxing.</p>

<p>Then she drifted for a while, watching his expression, a little
dreading lest even his phantom laugh at her out of those eyes
too wise.</p>

<p>Visions came to her awake to reassure her; he and she in a sleigh
together under the winter stars&mdash;he and she in the sunlight, their
skates flashing over the frozen meadows&mdash;he and she in the armoury,
heads together over some wonder of ancient craftsmanship&mdash;he and
she at luncheon&mdash;in the library&mdash;always he and she together in
happy companionship. Her eyelids fluttered and drooped; and sleep
came, and dreams&mdash;wonderful, exquisite, past belief&mdash;and still
of him and of herself together, always together in a magic world
that could not be except for such as they.</p>
