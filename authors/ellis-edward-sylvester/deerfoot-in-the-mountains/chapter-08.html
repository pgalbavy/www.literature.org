<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The black stallion knew his master was in trouble. Stepping forward
he thrust forward his nose and licked his face. Deerfoot rested
one arm on his mane, the other hand holding his rifle. Then Whirlwind,
without a word, kneeled on one knee, so as to lower his shoulders.
With a single hop the young Shawanoe leaped upon his back and
the steed immediately stood on all-fours.</p>

<p>"Now, my friend, show them what you can do in the way of running."</p>

<p>The incident had taken only a few moments, but brief as was the
time it had allowed the Assiniboines to decrease the space between
them and the Shawanoe. Singular as it seemed, they still failed
to hurry. They held their horses at a walk, and Deerfoot for the
first time began to suspect the truth.</p>

<p>Whirlwind was off with the speed of the wind. His motion gave
pain to the rider, but it was less than when he stood with one
foot on the ground. So long as he had the steed under him he felt
little cause for fear.</p>

<p>The theory which had suddenly assumed shape in the mind of Deerfoot
was that the pursuers wished to hold him in the ravine while another
party passed around to the other entrance. He would thus be placed
between two fires and his position made tenfold more perilous
than ever. It may be said that if this trick succeeded the doom
of both Deerfoot and Whirlwind would be sealed.</p>

<p>And it was precisely the stratagem which the Assiniboines had
attempted.</p>

<p>It will now be understood why the Shawanoe sent his steed flying
up the gorge at such a tremendous burst of speed that he rapidly
drew away from the group behind him. He meant to get out of the
ravine before he was shut off in front. No doubt longer remained
that it was open at no great distance in advance.</p>

<p>The space was less than a third of a mile after making the last
turn. Deerfoot would have been glad had it been greater, for that
much more opportunity would be given for the use of the stallion's
fleetness.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe descried the open door. The walls fell away, leaving
an interval of a hundred yards between, the bottom of the ravine
slightly ascended, the ridges gradually dropped to the level of
the earth, and the country was spread out as before he rode into
the cañon the night previous.</p>

<p>From the back of the flying steed Deerfoot kept his eye on the
space, expecting every moment to see the other Assiniboines dash
into view and sweep down upon him. He had fixed his line of action.
He would charge straight at them, even if they numbered a dozen,
using first his rifle and then his knife, should a chance present
itself to bring the latter into play.</p>

<p>With every bound of Whirlwind the hopes of his rider rose. It
looked as if the race had been won by the superb stallion. A few
more strides and all his enemies would be thrown to the rear.</p>

<p>The next moment Whirlwind burst out of the ravine into the open
country, and in the same instant came face to face with another
horseman. He was the Assiniboine chieftain, who alone had ridden
hard along the side of the cañon on the ground above, in order
to head off the flying fugitive, and had arrived just in time
to do so. He scorned to take any companion with him, for he feared
no living man and was sure of overcoming the audacious stranger
that had roused his fury.</p>

<p>The Assiniboine must have heard the thunder of the approaching
hoofs, for he had checked his own horse, on which he sat awaiting
the appearance of the Shawanoe. When the latter caught sight of
his face he had his rifle at his shoulder and was in the act of
pressing the trigger.</p>

<p>Deerfoot saw he had no time to use his own weapon, for quickly
as he might aim it the other would be discharged first. In the
language of the modern West, the Assiniboine "had the drop" on
the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>There was but one thing to do, and Deerfoot did it in the twinkling
of an eye. He flung his body to the other side of his steed, sustaining
himself by bending his toes over the base of the stallion's neck.
When I add that the foot with which he performed this remarkable
bit of horsemanship was the one with the sprained ankle, you may
faintly imagine the wrenching torture he suffered. Only by a superhuman
effort did he keep control of his senses.</p>

<p>The Assiniboine fired at the moment of the lightning-like shift
of position, and Deerfoot heard the zip of the bullet as it sped
across the space covered less than a second before by his body.</p>

<p>There is a lurking devil in the most saintly disposition, and
that which slumbered in the breast of the young Shawanoe now flamed
to a white heat. Swinging back to the upright posture he called:</p>

<p>"Now, Whirlwind, run him down!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Now, Whirlwind, Run Him Down."]</p>

<p>The stallion felt the pressure of the knees, understood the command,
and ablaze with rage, charged like a cyclone for the other horse.
In a flash he crashed into the animal, hurling him sidelong to
the earth and rolling him completely over from the terrific force
of the impact.</p>

<p>But his rider was a fine horseman and leaped to the ground before
the collision. Whirling about he faced the Shawanoe, with knife
drawn, for there was no time to reload his gun.</p>

<p>He was now at the mercy of Deerfoot, whose weapon was loaded.
But for the disabled limb he would have leaped to the earth and
assailed the other. He would have done the same had there been
two enemies before him; he would have done the same had there
been three; but he was not the fool to engage in a fight when
he had but a single leg to stand upon.</p>

<p>The panic-stricken horse, having clambered to his feet, dashed
away. Whirlwind assumed his statue-like pose and Deerfoot brought
his rifle to a level, with the Assiniboine staring into the muzzle.</p>

<p>The fight had been of the cyclone order, but, brief as it was,
Deerfoot had become himself again. He was the Christian who could
not shed the blood of one that was unable to defend himself, even
though that one was his deadly enemy.</p>

<p>The Assiniboine had dropped his gun when assuming his position
at bay, and it lay several feet away on the ground. Lowering his
own weapon, Deerfoot pointed after the fleeing horse and said
sternly in the tongue of the Blackfeet:</p>

<p>"Run! run after the horse!"</p>

<p>The gesture, as much as the words, explained the command. It
was so unparalleled, so utterly unexpected, that the Assiniboine
stood in a daze. Deerfoot knew that the report of the gun would
speedily bring the warriors to the spot, and there was not a minute
to spare. He repeated his order more sharply than before and accompanied
it with a threatening lifting of his gun to a level.</p>

<p>The other could not misunderstand the significance of voice and
gesture. He stepped forward to pick up his rifle.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted the Shawanoe, before the other could stoop. "Leave
it where it is! Follow the horse."</p>

<p>The hammer of the leveled rifle was at full cock. Still unable
fully to comprehend all that had taken place, the chieftain faced
about and broke into a lope after his horse, which acted as if
it would keep up its pace for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>Deerfoot waited till the chief had gone a hundred paces, when
heading the other way he gave the word to Whirlwind, whom, however,
he held down to a walk. The rider wished to witness developments.</p>

<p>Looking back he saw the Assiniboine motionless and gazing after
him with emotions that can hardly be imagined or described. He
stood thus for a minute, when he started on a run to recover his
rifle from where it lay on the ground. Just before reaching the
spot the party of horsemen emerged from the mouth of the cañon
and paused while their leader rejoined them.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to know how he squared matters with his
warriors. It would have required a vivid imagination and a genius
in the way of invention to explain how it was his horse was just
vanishing in the distance; how the chief was in the act of recovering
his weapon, and more than all, how it came about that the youthful
warrior of a strange tribe, who had already slain one Assiniboine&mdash;though
that was yet unknown to this party&mdash;was riding leisurely off on
the back of the special pet of the chieftain. If the Assiniboine
was wise he made a clean breast of it, and insisted that the dusky
stranger was a marvel in his way whom it was exceedingly unwise
to push into a corner.</p>

<p>The chagrin of the Assiniboine party was not soothed by the action
of Deerfoot, who, having spared the life of an enemy, felt himself
justified in "rubbing it in," so to speak. He faced Whirlwind
toward the group, held him motionless, and, swinging his rifle
over his head, indulged in a series of tantalizing shouts that
were anything but soothing to the chief and his friends. How they
ached to get the terrible young warrior into their power! What
exquisite vengeance they would have wreaked upon him!</p>

<p>But such bliss was impossible. They knew what speed the black
stallion possessed, and it was not supposable that his rider meant
to challenge all of them to combat. So they maintained a glum
silence as he rode from view.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Deerfoot found he must give attention to the ankle,
whose condition had been aggravated by the fight with the Assiniboine
leader. It was much swollen and the pain was torturing. Still
his bravery and self-command prevented anything in the nature
of murmuring. In truth, he would have suffered death without outcry.</p>

<p>The remarkable youth found a strange consolation. He was familiar
with the story of the Saviour's death on the cross and remembered
the nails that were driven through the hands and feet.</p>

<p>"<em>He</em> suffered from four wounds, besides having a spear
thrust into his side. Deerfoot has only one hurt in his foot and
that does not bleed. <em>He</em> had the weight of the world's
guilt crushing his heart. What are Deerfoot's sufferings compared
with His? It is my Father's will and therefore the heart of Deerfoot
is glad."</p>

<p>Failing to see a sign of strangers in the neighborhood, the Shawanoe
drew Whirlwind down to a walk and halted at the first mountain
stream, which happened to be no larger than the one where he had
broiled his supper the night before.</p>

<p>The moment Whirlwind saw that his master wished to dismount he
sank upon both knees. His sympathetic act touched Deerfoot, who,
stepping carefully upon the well limb, patted the neck of the
steed and thanked him.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot would be helpless but for Whirlwind. They must now
stick together as never before."</p>

<p>Hopping to the brook the youth slipped off his moccasin and removed
the stocking. The swollen ankle was as sensitive as a boil. Dipping
the stocking in the icy water he rang it almost dry and rubbed
the limb, gently at first and then more vigorously until it was
in a glow. This was soothing and gave partial relief, but much
pain remained. An injury of that nature takes a long time to subside.</p>

<p>Having never suffered from illness or wounds, the Shawanoe was
without any remedy at command, nor did he know aught of the many
medicaments which his race, as well as the white people, use.
Had the hurt been a simple cut or wound he would have given it
no heed, but his sprain forced itself upon his notice.</p>

<p>He finished rubbing the ankle and carefully drew on the stocking,
with Whirlwind sympathetically watching him, and doubtless longing
for some method of giving relief. I wonder whether the creature
recalled that day, many weeks before, when his young master rubbed
his injured knee so tenderly and ministered to him until he had
fully recovered. We cannot fathom the mysteries of the brain in
animals of a high order of intelligence, and it is not for us
to deny that such might have been the fact.</p>

<p>Suddenly the stallion turned toward a pile of rocks to the left
and emitted his faint, warning neigh. Deerfoot was up in a twinkling,
despite the additional suffering caused by his action, and seized
his rifle resting near. As he did so an Indian appeared from behind
the rocks and came toward him. A glance showed him to be the dwarf
with whom Deerfoot had had his singular meeting when journeying
northward.</p>

<p>The red man of short stature took long wabbling strides, made
numerous gestures and grimaces and rapidly uttered words, not
one of which was understood by the Shawanoe. Still chattering,
gesticulating and grinning he came forward, without heeding the
black steed, flung his long bow to the ground, and kneeling down,
gently lifted the foot of Deerfoot, who had not yet drawn on his
moccasin. The visitor saw that the limb was injured and tenderly
rested the foot upon his knee, the owner thereof making no objection,
gently turned down the stocking and spent a minute or two in inspecting
the swollen ankle. Then with a sympathetic aspiration he slowly
stroked it with his hand. In doing so he drew downward each time
and never rubbed the surface upward.</p>

<p>There is something in magnetism, and Deerfoot was sure of a slight
cessation of the pain, though the relief was not marked. When
the caressing had been repeated a number of times, the dwarf softly
laid the foot on the ground and rose to his feet. Another vigorous
discharge of unintelligible words followed, and he wabbled rapidly
off beyond the rocks from behind which he had come a short time
before.</p>

<p>Since he left his bow lying on the ground where he had flung
it, Deerfoot knew he had gone in quest of some remedy and would
soon return. He therefore kept his seat on the ground and patiently
awaited the other's coming.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the dwarf reappeared, bearing in his hand a
bunch of green leaves. The twigs were pinnated, and at the base
of each leaflet, where it joined the common peticle, was a single
crimson berry, resembling the common wintergreen, but the genus
was unknown to the Shawanoe, though he knew something of medicinal
herbs.</p>

<p>Dividing the twigs with their leaves and berries into halves,
the good Samaritan laid one pile on the ground, pointing to it,
and still chattering. Deerfoot knew he wished to direct his attention
to the healing plant, and he nodded his head to signify he understood
and would remember his request.</p>

<p>Then, as deftly as a girl, the dusky friend picked the berries
from the twigs in the other bunch. They filled the palm of one
hand, which he held out for Deerfoot to inspect. The Shawanoe
nodded again. The other wabbled back to the rocks, but did not
pass out of sight. Picking up a bit of stone, he began crushing
the berries upon a projection of the rocks. It took but a brief
time to turn them into a yellow, sticky mass which emitted a slightly
aromatic odor. Returning to the patient, he skillfully spread
the poultice on several of the larger leaves, laid them over and
around the swollen ankle, and then, as gently as a mother with
her babe, drew the stocking over it, so as to hold the poultice
in place.</p>

<p>Deerfoot leaned back, resting his body on his elbows, and heaved
a long, grateful sigh. The relief was bliss itself. For a minute
or two he believed the injury was fully healed, but a slight movement
of the foot proved that this was not the fact. Nevertheless, the
effect of the crushed berries was magical. As he looked up in
the homely, twisted countenance, his expression spoke his gratitude.
The dwarf grinned. The language of thankfulness needs no interpreter.
Deerfoot came to the upright posture, and, reaching forward, took
one of the stranger's hands in his own and patted it, murmuring
his thanks.</p>

<p>The dwarf pointed to the twigs and berries remaining untouched
and said something, which was made clear by the rapid flitting
of his forefinger from them to the wounded member. The meaning
was plain. The patient was to use them as the others had been
used. Deerfoot signified in his usual way that he understood the
direction.</p>

<p>The dwarf stood for a few minutes silent, with his eyes on the
face of the Shawanoe seated before him. Then he spoke again, and
Deerfoot would have given much to have understood the words, but
he could not form the remotest idea of their meaning. The visitor
stopped and picked up his bow from the ground, turned and swung
with his awkward gait up the slight slope, passed from sight behind
the pile of rocks, and the Shawanoe never saw or heard of him
again.</p>
