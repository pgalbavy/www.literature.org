"Parables don't lie, but liars will parable." - Lip-King.
<P>
<P>
Old Long-Beard paused in his narrative, licked his greasy fingers,
and wiped them on his naked sides where his one piece of ragged
bearskin failed to cover him.  Crouched around him, on their hams,
were three young men, his grandsons, Deer-Runner, Yellow-Head, and
Afraid-of-the-Dark.  In appearance they were much the same.  Skins
of wild animals partly covered them.  They were lean and meagre of
build, narrow-hipped and crooked-legged, and at the same time deep-
chested, with heavy arms and enormous hands.  There was much hair
on their chests and shoulders, and on the outsides of their arms
and legs.  Their heads were matted with uncut hair, long locks of
which often strayed before their eyes, beady and black and
glittering like the eyes of birds.  They were narrow between the
eyes and broad between the cheeks, while their lower jaws were
projecting and massive.
<P>
It was a night of clear starlight, and below them, stretching away
remotely, lay range on range of forest-covered hills.  In the
distance the heavens were red from the glow of a volcano.  At their
backs yawned the black mouth of a cave, out of which, from time to
time, blew draughty gusts of wind.  Immediately in front of them
blazed a fire.  At one side, partly devoured, lay the carcass of a
bear, with about it, at a respectable distance, several large dogs,
shaggy and wolf-like.  Beside each man lay his bow and arrows and a
huge club.  In the cave-mouth a number of rude spears leaned
against the rock.
<P>
"So that was how we moved from the cave to the tree," old Long-
Beard spoke up.
<P>
They laughed boisterously, like big children, at recollection of a
previous story his words called up.  Long-Beard laughed, too, the
five-inch bodkin of bone, thrust midway through the cartilage of
his nose, leaping and dancing and adding to his ferocious
appearance.  He did not exactly say the words recorded, but he made
animal-like sounds with his mouth that meant the same thing.
<P>
"And that is the first I remember of the Sea Valley," Long-Beard
went on.  "We were a very foolish crowd.  We did not know the
secret of strength.  For, behold, each family lived by itself, and
took care of itself.  There were thirty families, but we got no
strength from one another.  We were in fear of each other all the
time.  No one ever paid visits.  In the top of our tree we built a
grass house, and on the platform outside was a pile of rocks, which
were for the heads of any that might chance to try to visit us.
Also, we had our spears and arrows.  We never walked under the
trees of the other families, either.  My brother did, once, under
old Boo-oogh's tree, and he got his head broken and that was the
end of him.
<P>
"Old Boo-oogh was very strong.  It was said he could pull a grown
man's head right off.  I never heard of him doing it, because no
man would give him a chance.  Father wouldn't.  One day, when
father was down on the beach, Boo-oogh took after mother.  She
couldn't run fast, for the day before she had got her leg clawed by
a bear when she was up on the mountain gathering berries.  So Boo-
oogh caught her and carried her up into his tree.  Father never got
her back.  He was afraid.  Old Boo-oogh made faces at him.
<P>
"But father did not mind.  Strong-Arm was another strong man.  He
was one of the best fishermen.  But one day, climbing after sea-
gull eggs, he had a fall from the cliff.  He was never strong after
that.  He coughed a great deal, and his shoulders drew near to each
other.  So father took Strong-Arm's wife.  When he came around and
coughed under our tree, father laughed at him and threw rocks at
him.  It was our way in those days.  We did not know how to add
strength together and become strong."
<P>
"Would a brother take a brother's wife?" Deer-Runner demanded.
<P>
"Yes, if he had gone to live in another tree by himself."
<P>
"But we do not do such things now," Afraid-of-the-Dark objected.
<P>
"It is because I have taught your fathers better."  Long-Beard
thrust his hairy paw into the bear meat and drew out a handful of
suet, which he sucked with a meditative air.  Again he wiped his
hands on his naked sides and went on.  "What I am telling you
happened in the long ago, before we knew any better."
<P>
"You must have been fools not to know better," was Deer-Runner's
comment, Yellow-Head grunting approval.
<P>
"So we were, but we became bigger fools, as you shall see.  Still,
we did learn better, and this was the way of it.  We Fish-Eaters
had not learned to add our strength until our strength was the
strength of all of us.  But the Meat-Eaters, who lived across the
divide in the Big Valley, stood together, hunted together, fished
together, and fought together.  One day they came into our valley.
Each family of us got into its own cave and tree.  There were only
ten Meat-Eaters, but they fought together, and we fought, each
family by itself."
<P>
Long-Beard counted long and perplexedly on his fingers.
<P>
"There were sixty men of us," was what he managed to say with
fingers and lips combined.  "And we were very strong, only we did
not know it.  So we watched the ten men attack Boo-oogh's tree.  He
made a good fight, but he had no chance.  We looked on.  When some
of the Meat-Eaters tried to climb the tree, Boo-oogh had to show
himself in order to drop stones on their heads, whereupon the other
Meat-Eaters, who were waiting for that very thing, shot him full of
arrows.  And that was the end of Boo-oogh.
<P>
"Next, the Meat-Eaters got One-Eye and his family in his cave.
They built a fire in the mouth and smoked him out, like we smoked
out the bear there to-day.  Then they went after Six-Fingers, up
his tree, and, while they were killing him and his grown son, the
rest of us ran away.  They caught some of our women, and killed two
old men who could not run fast and several children.  The women
they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
<P>
"After that the rest of us crept back, and, somehow, perhaps
because we were in fear and felt the need for one another, we
talked the thing over.  It was our first council - our first real
council.  And in that council we formed our first tribe.  For we
had learned the lesson.  Of the ten Meat-Eaters, each man had had
the strength of ten, for the ten had fought as one man.  They had
added their strength together.  But of the thirty families and the
sixty men of us, we had had the strength of but one man, for each
had fought alone.
<P>
"It was a great talk we had, and it was hard talk, for we did not
have the words then as now with which to talk.  The Bug made some
of the words long afterward, and so did others of us make words
from time to time.  But in the end we agreed to add our strength
together and to be as one man when the Meat-Eaters came over the
divide to steal our women.  And that was the tribe.
<P>
"We set two men on the divide, one for the day and one for the
night, to watch if the Meat-Eaters came.  These were the eyes of
the tribe.  Then, also, day and night, there were to be ten men
awake with their clubs and spears and arrows in their hands, ready
to fight.  Before, when a man went after fish, or clams, or gull-
eggs, he carried his weapons with him, and half the time he was
getting food and half the time watching for fear some other man
would get him.  Now that was all changed.  The men went out without
their weapons and spent all their time getting food.  Likewise,
when the women went into the mountains after roots and berries,
five of the ten men went with them to guard them.  While all the
time, day and night, the eyes of the tribe watched from the top of
the divide.
<P>
"But troubles came.  As usual, it was about the women.  Men without
wives wanted other men's wives, and there was much fighting between
men, and now and again one got his head smashed or a spear through
his body.  While one of the watchers was on top of the divide,
another man stole his wife, and he came down to fight.  Then the
other watcher was in fear that some one would take his wife, and he
came down likewise.  Also, there was trouble among the ten men who
carried always their weapons, and they fought five against five,
till some ran away down the coast and the others ran after them.
<P>
"So it was that the tribe was left without eyes or guards.  We had
not the strength of sixty.  We had no strength at all.  So we held
a council and made our first laws.  I was but a cub at the time,
but I remember.  We said that, in order to be strong, we must not
fight one another, and we made a law that when a man killed another
him would the tribe kill.  We made another law that whoso stole
another man's wife him would the tribe kill.  We said that whatever
man had too great strength, and by that strength hurt his brothers
in the tribe, him would we kill that his strength might hurt no
more.  For, if we let his strength hurt, the brothers would become
afraid and the tribe would fall apart, and we would be as weak as
when the Meat-Eaters first came upon us and killed Boo-oogh.
<P>
"Knuckle-Bone was a strong man, a very strong man, and he knew not
law.  He knew only his own strength, and in the fullness thereof he
went forth and took the wife of Three-Clams.  Three-Clams tried to
fight, but Knuckle-Bone clubbed out his brains.  Yet had Knuckle-
Bone forgotten that all the men of us had added our strength to
keep the law among us, and him we killed, at the foot of his tree,
and hung his body on a branch as a warning that the law was
stronger than any man.  For we were the law, all of us, and no man
was greater than the law.
<P>
"Then there were other troubles, for know, O Deer-Runner, and
Yellow-Head, and Afraid-of-the-Dark, that it is not easy to make a
tribe.  There were many things, little things, that it was a great
trouble to call all the men together to have a council about.  We
were having councils morning, noon, and night, and in the middle of
the night.  We could find little time to go out and get food,
because of the councils, for there was always some little thing to
be settled, such as naming two new watchers to take the place of
the old ones on the hill, or naming how much food should fall to
the share of the men who kept their weapons always in their hands
and got no food for themselves.
<P>
"We stood in need of a chief man to do these things, who would be
the voice of the council, and who would account to the council for
the things he did.  So we named Fith-Fith the chief man.  He was a
strong man, too, and very cunning, and when he was angry he made
noises just like that, FITH-FITH, like a wild-cat.
<P>
"The ten men who guarded the tribe were set to work making a wall
of stones across the narrow part of the valley.  The women and
large children helped, as did other men, until the wall was strong.
After that, all the families came down out of their caves and trees
and built grass houses behind the shelter of the wall.  These
houses were large and much better than the caves and trees, and
everybody had a better time of it because the men had added their
strength together and become a tribe.  Because of the wall and the
guards and the watchers, there was more time to hunt and fish and
pick roots and berries; there was more food, and better food, and
no one went hungry.  And Three-Legs, so named because his legs had
been smashed when a boy and who walked with a stick - Three-Legs
got the seed of the wild corn and planted it in the ground in the
valley near his house.  Also, he tried planting fat roots and other
things he found in the mountain valleys.
<P>
"Because of the safety in the Sea Valley, which was because of the
wall and the watchers and the guards, and because there was food in
plenty for all without having to fight for it, many families came
in from the coast valleys on both sides and from the high back
mountains where they had lived more like wild animals than men.
And it was not long before the Sea Valley filled up, and in it were
countless families.  But, before this happened, the land, which had
been free to all and belonged to all, was divided up.  Three-Legs
began it when he planted corn.  But most of us did not care about
the land.  We thought the marking of the boundaries with fences of
stone was a foolishness.  We had plenty to eat, and what more did
we want?  I remember that my father and I built stone fences for
Three-Legs and were given corn in return.
<P>
"So only a few got all the land, and Three-Legs got most of it.
Also, others that had taken land gave it to the few that held on,
being paid in return with corn and fat roots, and bear-skins, and
fishes which the farmers got from the fishermen in exchange for
corn.  And, the first thing we knew, all the land was gone.
<P>
"It was about this time that Fith-Fith died and Dog-Tooth, his son,
was made chief.  He demanded to be made chief anyway, because his
father had been chief before him.  Also, he looked upon himself as
a greater chief than his father.  He was a good chief at first, and
worked hard, so that the council had less and less to do.  Then
arose a new voice in the Sea Valley.  It was Twisted-Lip.  We had
never thought much of him, until he began to talk with the spirits
of the dead.  Later we called him Big-Fat, because he ate over-
much, and did no work, and grew round and large.  One day Big-Fat
told us that the secrets of the dead were his, and that he was the
voice of God.  He became great friends with Dog-Tooth, who
commanded that we should build Big-Fat a grass house.  And Big-Fat
put taboos all around this house and kept God inside.
<P>
"More and more Dog-Tooth became greater than the council, and when
the council grumbled and said it would name a new chief, Big-Fat
spoke with the voice of God and said no.  Also, Three-Legs and the
others who held the land stood behind Dog-Tooth.  Moreover, the
strongest man in the council was Sea-Lion, and him the land-owners
gave land to secretly, along with many bearskins and baskets of
corn.  So Sea-Lion said that Big-Fat's voice was truly the voice of
God and must be obeyed.  And soon afterward Sea-Lion was named the
voice of Dog-Tooth and did most of his talking for him.
<P>
"Then there was Little-Belly, a little man, so thin in the middle
that he looked as if he had never had enough to eat.  Inside the
mouth of the river, after the sand-bar had combed the strength of
the breakers, he built a big fish-trap.  No man had ever seen or
dreamed a fish-trap before.  He worked weeks on it, with his son
and his wife, while the rest of us laughed at their labours.  But,
when it was done, the first day he caught more fish in it than
could the whole tribe in a week, whereat there was great rejoicing.
There was only one other place in the river for a fish-trap, but,
when my father and I and a dozen other men started to make a very
large trap, the guards came from the big grass-house we had built
for Dog-Tooth.  And the guards poked us with their spears and told
us begone, because Little-Belly was going to build a trap there
himself on the word of Sea-Lion, who was the voice of Dog-Tooth.
<P>
"There was much grumbling, and my father called a council.  But,
when he rose to speak, him the Sea-Lion thrust through the throat
with a spear and he died.  And Dog-Tooth and Little-Belly, and
Three-Legs and all that held land said it was good.  And Big-Fat
said it was the will of God.  And after that all men were afraid to
stand up in the council, and there was no more council.
<P>
"Another man, Pig-Jaw, began to keep goats.  He had heard about it
as among the Meat-Eaters, and it was not long before he had many
flocks.  Other men, who had no land and no fish-traps, and who else
would have gone hungry, were glad to work for Pig-Jaw, caring for
his goats, guarding them from wild dogs and tigers, and driving
them to the feeding pastures in the mountains.  In return, Pig-Jaw
gave them goat-meat to eat and goat-skins to wear, and sometimes
they traded the goat-meat for fish and corn and fat roots.
<P>
"It was this time that money came to be.  Sea-Lion was the man who
first thought of it, and he talked it over with Dog-Tooth and Big-
Fat.  You see, these three were the ones that got a share of
everything in the Sea Valley.  One basket out of every three of
corn was theirs, one fish out of every three, one goat out of every
three.  In return, they fed the guards and the watchers, and kept
the rest for themselves.  Sometimes, when a big haul of fish was
made they did not know what to do with all their share.  So Sea-
Lion set the women to making money out of shell - little round
pieces, with a hole in each one, and all made smooth and fine.
These were strung on strings, and the strings were called money.
<P>
"Each string was of the value of thirty fish, or forty fish, but
the women, who made a string a day, were given two fish each.  The
fish came out of the shares of Dog-Tooth, Big-Fat, and Sea-Lion,
which they three did not eat.  So all the money belonged to them.
Then they told Three-Legs and the other land-owners that they would
take their share of corn and roots in money, Little-Belly that they
would take their share of fish in money, Pig-Jaw that they would
take their share of goats and cheese in money.  Thus, a man who had
nothing, worked for one who had, and was paid in money.  With this
money he bought corn, and fish, and meat, and cheese.  And Three-
Legs and all owners of things paid Dog-Tooth and Sea-Lion and Big-
Fat their share in money.  And they paid the guards and watchers in
money, and the guards and watchers bought their food with the
money.  And, because money was cheap, Dog-Tooth made many more men
into guards.  And, because money was cheap to make, a number of men
began to make money out of shell themselves.  But the guards stuck
spears in them and shot them full of arrows, because they were
trying to break up the tribe.  It was bad to break up the tribe,
for then the Meat-Eaters would come over the divide and kill them
all.
<P>
"Big-Fat was the voice of God, but he took Broken-Rib and made him
into a priest, so that he became the voice of Big-Fat and did most
of his talking for him.  And both had other men to be servants to
them.  So, also, did Little-Belly and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw have
other men to lie in the sun about their grass houses and carry
messages for them and give commands.  And more and more were men
taken away from work, so that those that were left worked harder
than ever before.  It seemed that men desired to do no work and
strove to seek out other ways whereby men should work for them.
Crooked-Eyes found such a way.  He made the first fire-brew out of
corn.  And thereafter he worked no more, for he talked secretly
with Dog-Tooth and Big-Fat and the other masters, and it was agreed
that he should be the only one to make fire-brew.  But Crooked-Eyes
did no work himself.  Men made the brew for him, and he paid them
in money.  Then he sold the fire-brew for money, and all men
bought.  And many strings of money did he give Dog-Tooth and Sea-
Lion and all of them.
<P>
"Big-Fat and Broken-Rib stood by Dog-Tooth when he took his second
wife, and his third wife.  They said Dog-Tooth was different from
other men and second only to God that Big-Fat kept in his taboo
house, and Dog-Tooth said so, too, and wanted to know who were they
to grumble about how many wives he took.  Dog-Tooth had a big canoe
made, and, many more men he took from work, who did nothing and lay
in the sun, save only when Dog-Tooth went in the canoe, when they
paddled for him.  And he made Tiger-Face head man over all the
guards, so that Tiger-Face became his right arm, and when he did
not like a man Tiger-Face killed that man for him.  And Tiger-Face,
also, made another man to be his right arm, and to give commands,
and to kill for him.
<P>
"But this was the strange thing:  as the days went by we who were
left worked harder and harder, and yet did we get less and less to
eat."
<P>
"But what of the goats and the corn and the fat roots and the fish-
trap?" spoke up Afraid-of-the-Dark, "what of all this?  Was there
not more food to be gained by man's work?"
<P>
"It is so," Long-Beard agreed.  "Three men on the fish-trap got
more fish than the whole tribe before there was a fish-trap.  But
have I not said we were fools?  The more food we were able to get,
the less food did we have to eat."
<P>
"But was it not plain that the many men who did not work ate it all
up?" Yellow-Head demanded.
<P>
Long-Beard nodded his head sadly.
<P>
"Dog-Tooth's dogs were stuffed with meat, and the men who lay in
the sun and did no work were rolling in fat, and, at the same time,
there were little children crying themselves to sleep with hunger
biting them with every wail."
<P>
Deer-Runner was spurred by the recital of famine to tear out a
chunk of bear-meat and broil it on a stick over the coals.  This he
devoured with smacking lips, while Long-Beard went on:
<P>
"When we grumbled Big-Fat arose, and with the voice of God said
that God had chosen the wise men to own the land and the goats and
the fish-trap, and the fire-brew, and that without these wise men
we would all be animals, as in the days when we lived in trees.
<P>
"And there arose one who became a singer of songs for the king.
Him they called the Bug, because he was small and ungainly of face
and limb and excelled not in work or deed.  He loved the fattest
marrow bones, the choicest fish, the milk warm from the goats, the
first corn that was ripe, and the snug place by the fire.  And
thus, becoming singer of songs to the king, he found a way to do
nothing and be fat.  And when the people grumbled more and more,
and some threw stones at the king's grass house, the Bug sang a
song of how good it was to be a Fish-Eater.  In his song he told
that the Fish-Eaters were the chosen of God and the finest men God
had made.  He sang of the Meat-Eaters as pigs and crows, and sang
how fine and good it was for the Fish-Eaters to fight and die doing
God's work, which was the killing of Meat-Eaters.  The words of his
song were like fire in us, and we clamoured to be led against the
Meat-Eaters.  And we forgot that we were hungry, and why we had
grumbled, and were glad to be led by Tiger-Face over the divide,
where we killed many Meat-Eaters and were content.
<P>
"But things were no better in the Sea Valley.  The only way to get
food was to work for Three-Legs or Little-Belly or Pig-Jaw; for
there was no land that a man might plant with corn for himself.
And often there were more men than Three-Legs and the others had
work for.  So these men went hungry, and so did their wives and
children and their old mothers.  Tiger-Face said they could become
guards if they wanted to, and many of them did, and thereafter they
did no work except to poke spears in the men who did work and who
grumbled at feeding so many idlers.
<P>
"And when we grumbled, ever the Bug sang new songs.  He said that
Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and the rest were strong men, and that that
was why they had so much.  He said that we should be glad to have
strong men with us, else would we perish of our own worthlessness
and the Meat-Eaters.  Therefore, we should be glad to let such
strong men have all they could lay hands on.  And Big-Fat and Pig-
Jaw and Tiger-Face and all the rest said it was true.
<P>
"'All right,' said Long-Fang, 'then will I, too, be a strong man.'
And he got himself corn, and began to make fire-brew and sell it
for strings of money.  And, when Crooked-Eyes complained, Long-Fang
said that he was himself a strong man, and that if Crooked-Eyes
made any more noise he would bash his brains out for him.  Whereat
Crooked-Eyes was afraid and went and talked with Three-Legs and
Pig-Jaw.  And all three went and talked to Dog-Tooth.  And Dog-
Tooth spoke to Sea-Lion, and Sea-Lion sent a runner with a message
to Tiger-Face.  And Tiger-Face sent his guards, who burned Long-
Fang's house along with the fire-brew he had made.  Also, they
killed him and all his family.  And Big-Fat said it was good, and
the Bug sang another song about how good it was to observe the law,
and what a fine land the Sea Valley was, and how every man who
loved the Sea Valley should go forth and kill the bad Meat-Eaters.
And again his song was as fire to us, and we forgot to grumble.
<P>
"It was very strange.  When Little-Belly caught too many fish, so
that it took a great many to sell for a little money, he threw many
of the fish back into the sea, so that more money would be paid for
what was left.  And Three-Legs often let many large fields lie idle
so as to get more money for his corn.  And the women, making so
much money out of shell that much money was needed to buy with,
Dog-Tooth stopped the making of money.  And the women had no work,
so they took the places of the men.  I worked on the fish-trap,
getting a string of money every five days.  But my sister now did
my work, getting a string of money for every ten days.  The women
worked cheaper, and there was less food, and Tiger-Face said we
should become guards.  Only I could not become a guard because I
was lame of one leg and Tiger-Face would not have me.  And there
were many like me.  We were broken men and only fit to beg for work
or to take care of the babies while the women worked."
<P>
Yellow-Head, too, was made hungry by the recital and broiled a
piece of bear-meat on the coals.
<P>
"But why didn't you rise up, all of you, and kill Three-Legs and
Pig-Jaw and Big-Fat and the rest and get enough to eat?" Afraid-in-
the-Dark demanded.
<P>
"Because we could not understand," Long-Beard answered.  "There was
too much to think about, and, also, there were the guards sticking
spears into us, and Big-Fat talking about God, and the Bug singing
new songs.  And when any man did think right, and said so, Tiger-
Face and the guards got him, and he was tied out to the rocks at
low tide so that the rising waters drowned him.
<P>
"It was a strange thing - the money.  It was like the Bug's songs.
It seemed all right, but it wasn't, and we were slow to understand.
Dog-Tooth began to gather the money in.  He put it in a big pile,
in a grass house, with guards to watch it day and night.  And the
more money he piled in the house the dearer money became, so that a
man worked a longer time for a string of money than before.  Then,
too, there was always talk of war with the Meat-Eaters, and Dog-
Tooth and Tiger-Face filled many houses with corn, and dried fish,
and smoked goat-meat, and cheese.  And with the food, piled there
in mountains the people had not enough to eat.  But what did it
matter?  Whenever the people grumbled too loudly the Bug sang a new
song, and Big-Fat said it was God's word that we should kill Meat-
Eaters, and Tiger-Face led us over the divide to kill and be
killed.  I was not good enough to be a guard and lie fat in the
sun, but, when we made war, Tiger-Face was glad to take me along.
And when we had eaten, all the food stored in the houses we stopped
fighting and went back to work to pile up more food."
<P>
"Then were you all crazy," commented Deer-Runner.
<P>
"Then were we indeed all crazy," Long-Beard agreed.  "It was
strange, all of it.  There was Split-Nose.  He said everything was
wrong.  He said it was true that we grew strong by adding our
strength together.  And he said that, when we first formed the
tribe, it was right that the men whose strength hurt the tribe
should be shorn of their strength - men who bashed their brothers'
heads and stole their brothers' wives.  And now, he said, the tribe
was not getting stronger, but was getting weaker, because there
were men with another kind of strength that were hurting the tribe
- men who had the strength of the land, like Three-Legs; who had
the strength of the fish-trap, like Little-Belly; who had the
strength of all the goat-meat, like Pig-Jaw.  The thing to do,
Split-Nose said, was to shear these men of their evil strength; to
make them go to work, all of them, and to let no man eat who did
not work.
<P>
"And the Bug sang another song about men like Split-Nose, who
wanted to go back, and live in trees.
<P>
"Yet Split-Nose said no; that he did not want to go back, but
ahead; that they grew strong only as they added their strength
together; and that, if the Fish-Eaters would add their strength to
the Meat-Eaters, there would be no more fighting and no more
watchers and no more guards, and that, with all men working, there
would be so much food that each man would have to work not more
than two hours a day.
<P>
"Then the Bug sang again, and he sang that Split-Nose was lazy, and
he sang also the 'Song of the Bees.'  It was a strange song, and
those who listened were made mad, as from the drinking of strong
fire-brew.  The song was of a swarm of bees, and of a robber wasp
who had come in to live with the bees and who was stealing all
their honey.  The wasp was lazy and told them there was no need to
work; also, he told them to make friends with the bears, who were
not honey-stealers but only very good friends.  And the Bug sang in
crooked words, so that those who listened knew that the swarm was
the Sea Valley tribe, that the bears were the Meat-Eaters, and that
the lazy wasp was Split-Nose.  And when the Bug sang that the bees
listened to the wasp till the swarm was near to perishing, the
people growled and snarled, and when the Bug sang that at last the
good bees arose and stung the wasp to death, the people picked up
stones from the ground and stoned Split-Nose to death till there
was naught to be seen of him but the heap of stones they had flung
on top of him.  And there were many poor people who worked long and
hard and had not enough to eat that helped throw the stones on
Split-Nose.
<P>
"And, after the death of Split-Nose, there was but one other man
that dared rise up and speak his mind, and that man was Hair-Face.
'Where is the strength of the strong?' he asked.  'We are the
strong, all of us, and we are stronger than Dog-Tooth and Tiger-
Face and Three-Legs and Pig-Jaw and all the rest who do nothing and
eat much and weaken us by the hurt of their strength which is bad
strength.  Men who are slaves are not strong.  If the man who first
found the virtue and use of fire had used his strength we would
have been his slaves, as we are the slaves to-day of Little-Belly,
who found the virtue and use of the fish-trap; and of the men who
found the virtue and use of the land, and the goats, and the fire-
brew.  Before, we lived in trees, my brothers, and no man was safe.
But we fight no more with one another.  We have added our strength
together.  Then let us fight no more with the Meat-Eaters.  Let us
add our strength and their strength together.  Then will we be
indeed strong.  And then we will go out together, the Fish-Eaters
and the Meat-Eaters, and we will kill the tigers and the lions and
the wolves and the wild dogs, and we will pasture our goats on all
the hill-sides and plant our corn and fat roots in all the high
mountain valleys.  In that day we will be so strong that all the
wild animals will flee before us and perish.  And nothing will
withstand us, for the strength of each man will be the strength of
all men in the world.'
<P>
"So said Hair-Face, and they killed him, because, they said, he was
a wild man and wanted to go back and live in a tree.  It was very
strange.  Whenever a man arose and wanted to go forward all those
that stood still said he went backward and should be killed.  And
the poor people helped stone him, and were fools.  We were all
fools, except those who were fat and did no work.  The fools were
called wise, and the wise were stoned.  Men who worked did not get
enough to eat, and the men who did not work ate too much.
<P>
"And the tribe went on losing strength.  The children were weak and
sickly.  And, because we ate not enough, strange sicknesses came
among us and we died like flies.  And then the Meat-Eaters came
upon us.  We had followed Tiger-Face too often over the divide and
killed them.  And now they came to repay in blood.  We were too
weak and sick to man the big wall.  And they killed us, all of us,
except some of the women, which they took away with them.  The Bug
and I escaped, and I hid in the wildest places, and became a hunter
of meat and went hungry no more.  I stole a wife from the Meat-
Eaters, and went to live in the caves of the high mountains where
they could not find me.  And we had three sons, and each son stole
a wife from the Meat-Eaters.  And the rest you know, for are you
not the sons of my sons?"
<P>
"But the Bug?" queried Deer-Runner.  "What became of him?"
<P>
"He went to live with the Meat-Eaters and to be a singer of songs
to the king.  He is an old man now, but he sings the same old
songs; and, when a man rises up to go forward, he sings that that
man is walking backward to live in a tree."
<P>
Long-Beard dipped into the bear-carcass and sucked with toothless
gums at a fist of suet.
<P>
"Some day," he said, wiping his hands on his sides, "all the fools
will be dead and then all live men will go forward.  The strength
of the strong will be theirs, and they will add their strength
together, so that, of all the men in the world, not one will fight
with another.  There will be no guards nor watchers on the walls.
And all the hunting animals will be killed, and, as Hair-Face said,
all the hill-sides will be pastured with goats and all the high
mountain valleys will be planted with corn and fat roots.  And all
men will be brothers, and no man will lie idle in the sun and be
fed by his fellows.  And all that will come to pass in the time
when the fools are dead, and when there will be no more singers to
stand still and sing the 'Song of the Bees.'  Bees are not men."
