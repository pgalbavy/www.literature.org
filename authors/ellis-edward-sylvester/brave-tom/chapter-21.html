<p>Only two or three incidents worthy of note fell to the lot of
Tom Gordon during his second year in the employ of Josiah Warmore.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year he was promoted, and received a
considerable increase of salary. The situation given to him belonged
by right of seniority of service to Max Zeigler, and was looked
upon as a certainty by him. He was so indignant at the snub, that
he made no effort to conceal his feelings. While the hurt rankled,
he went to Mr. Warmore and demanded an explanation. He got it,
and resigned forthwith. No one regretted to see him go, and least
of all Tom Gordon, who gave a sigh of thankfulness at the removal
of the thorn from his side.</p>

<p>It was strange how Mr. Warmore found out everything about his
employees. Often they felt astonishment, and could not understand
by what means he picked up knowledge they were often certain was
only known to themselves. Thus he learned at an early date the
petty persecutions suffered by Tom at the hands of Zeigler; and
there can be little doubt that that information was one cause
of the fellow receiving such a marked set-back. Then he knew as
much of that wrestling and boxing bout as if he had been a witness.
There is reason to suspect he was secretly pleased at the issue,
though he would never admit it. It is not wise at all times for
the teacher or employer to let those under his charge know the
extent of his knowledge of their doings. In other words, it is
not always best to see what you do see.</p>

<p>Mr. Warmore was a reserved man. He was kind, but just, toward
his clerks. He established a free reading-room in Bellemore, saw
that every employee had his regular vacation each summer or whenever
he preferred it, encouraged them to be frugal and moral, gave
them good advice, forbade coarseness of language or profanity,
and hired a pew in each of the two leading churches, which were
always at the disposal of his young men without any expense to
them.</p>

<p>Occasionally he gave entertainments at his own handsome residence
for their benefit. Now and then he would invite some of them to
dinner. His wife was in delicate health, but a most excellent
woman, who did much to make such evenings highly enjoyable. Their
only son had died in his infancy, and their daughter Jennie was
attending a boarding-school. Little was seen of her, though when
at home she often drove to the store with her mother, to take
her father out with them. She was remarkably attractive in looks,
but, like her father, reserved in manner. She recognized the clerks,
when she chanced to meet them, with the air and manner of a lady;
but all felt there was a gulf between her and them which was impassable.
They concluded (and did not criticise her therefor) that she held
herself socially above each and all of them.</p>

<p>The second incident that took place came to Tom Gordon in the
summer-time while away on his fortnight's vacation. He had grown
to be tall, and more attractive than when younger. He was fond
of good clothes; and when he took the steamer at the landing,
and went down the Hudson to New York, it would have been hard
to find a better looking or more correctly costumed young man
than Tom. He did not show it in his manner, but how could he help
knowing it?</p>

<p>Strange that almost the first persons he noticed on the boat
were Sam Harper and his sister Nellie, returning from an excursion
up the river. They, too, had done considerable growing, and made
a handsome couple. Tom looked so well that Nellie was very pleased
to meet him. She would have been glad to receive attention from
him, and showed by her manner that she expected it. But Tom could
not forget that snub a couple of years before, when he was selling
papers on a Broadway car. He liked Sam and his father and mother,
but couldn't forgive Nellie for hurting his feelings. So, when
the brother turned her over to him, Tom with exquisite courtesy
raised his hat, bade her good-day, and strolled to another part
of the boat. She understood the meaning of the repulse, as he
meant she should, and she felt it.</p>

<p>And who should he run against on the wharf in the city but his
old friend Patsey McConough, who had done him such a good turn
when he first arrived in the metropolis. The genial Irishman had
driven down with a carriage to meet his employer, who was on the
steamer, so he had but little opportunity to talk with Tom, whom
he did not recognize until the youth made himself known. But they
shook hands warmly, and each was pleased to find the other doing
so well. They parted with the best wishes, hoping soon to see
each other again.</p>

<p>Tom, like a sensible youth, made the most of his vacation. He
spent several days among his friends at Briggsville, who heartily
welcomed him among them, even though saddened by the fact that
the orphan who went away with him could never return to them again.
Then he gave a few days to the seashore, where none enjoyed the
bathing, the boating, and frolicking more than he. All too soon
the two weeks drew to an end, and he again boarded the steamer
which stopped at the landing opposite Bellemore, on its way to
more important towns and cities up the Hudson.</p>

<p>Strolling over the boat to see whether there were any acquaintances
among his fellow-travelers, he found none, and, having nothing
better to do, sat down on a camp-stool on the forward deck to
view the picturesque scenery, which, however, had become so familiar
that he fell to studying human nature as it appeared immediately
around him.</p>

<p>That which interested him the most was a dudish young man, dressed
in the extreme of fashion, carrying a heavy cane, and wearing
eyeglasses. He had high cheek bones, fishy gray eyes, fine teeth,
and a simpering smile. Tom judged he was a couple of years older
than himself, and became interested in him because of his amusing
efforts to charm the ladies around him. The vulgar expression
would be that he was trying to "mash" them. The word is not a
good one, but it will help my reader to understand the meaning.</p>

<p>Evidently he believed himself irresistible, and his smirking,
posing, and ogling were ludicrous to the last degree. Among the
numerous young ladies on board were a dozen Vassar girls, as bright,
merry, and full of mischief as they could possibly be. They met
the ogling of the dude with sly glances and smiles which made
him more killing than ever. Encouraged by this, and not doubting
that he had made a conquest, he ventured to approach and address
them. The reception he met was enough to congeal water. It fairly
took away his breath. Then he blushed clear out to the end of
his ears, and withdrew to some other part of the boat, where he
could hope to be better appreciated.</p>

<p>Some of the girls managed to stroll thither a few minutes later,
as if unconscious of where he had gone. Tom saw some fun was coming,
and he drifted thither too.</p>

<p>The dude had succeeded in making an impression on a simpering
girl, and was seated on one of the camp-stools beside her, talking
in his drawling way, and pointing out the beautiful scenery as
they swept past. He frequently raised his heavy cane and indicated
the different objects, the better to enlighten his companion.</p>

<p>"Aw, that is Haverstraw," he volunteered, bringing the stick
to a level. "It is&mdash;aw&mdash;quite a famous place; reminds me of Holland
across the water, you know."</p>

<p>"What is there about Haverstraw to suggest Holland?" inquired
his lady friend.</p>

<p>"They make bricks there&mdash;aw&mdash;a good many bricks&mdash;aw&mdash;may I inquire,
doncherknow, did you ever see a brick?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she replied, with an impertinent glance from her mischievous
eyes; "I think I am looking at one now."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that I am a brick&mdash;aw&mdash;good, dooced good; I
must tell that at the club&mdash;dooced clevah; couldn't do much bettah
meself, doncherknow? Now, if you will kindly rise from your seat&mdash;aw
&mdash;I will point out a vewy interesting mountain peak."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I can see well enough without rising."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the dude came to a stooping posture, and, with
one gloved hand on the railing to steady him self, wabbled the
bulky cane again in the direction of the shore.</p>

<p>"Aw &mdash;I'm a little off soundings, doncherknow, and am not
suah whether that is Dunderberg Mountain or Saint Anthony's Olfactory
Organ&mdash;aw&mdash;that's clevah, don't you think, &mdash;Saint Anthony's
Olfactory Organ, doncherknow" &mdash;At the moment of partly rising
to his feet, a couple of Vassar girls walked past. When directly
opposite the camp-stool of the dude, one of them touched it with
the toe of her shoe and shoved it to one side. The lady seated
near and listening to the young man's chatter saw it, but pretended
she did not, and, therefore, made no effort to save her new friend
from his impending catastrophe. It was the same with a dozen other
persons.</p>

<p>There is no form of practical joking more to be condemned than
that of taking a chair from under a person when he is about to
sit down. Lasting injury has resulted in more than one instance,
and no person should ever do it himself or permit it to be done
by another. Possibly, however, the case now in hand was an exception;
for it was evident that the principal performer was so soft that
no harm could come to him from the fall. No spectator felt any
misgiving on that score.</p>

<p>Finding his companion did not rise as he had requested, the young
man began slowly to sit down. He continued doing so, until he
struck the deck with a bump which caused his hat to fly off, the
cane to drop from his hand, and his eyeglasses to fall from his
nose. He gradually picked himself up, and, amid the laughter of
every one near, made his way to the <em>salon</em> below, and
busied himself reading a copy of an English paper.</p>

<p>This incident would not be worth the telling but for that which
followed. The dudish young man who caused so much entertainment
on board the steamer that afternoon was destined to cross the
path of Tom Gordon in a way of which neither dreamed.</p>

<p>Tom gave no more thought to him until, when waiting to walk ashore
at the landing, he saw, to his surprise, the young man was about
to do the same. It looked as if he intended to make a call at
Bellemore. Greater astonishment came when Tom saw the handsome
carriage of Mr. Warmore at the landing. The driver was perched
on the high seat in front, while Mrs. Warmore and her daughter
Jennie occupied the rear seat, facing the vacant one.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible? Well, that beats me!"</p>

<p>[Illustration: Tom held on like grim death.]</p>

<p>The carriage was waiting for this young man, who simpered forward
with uplifted hat and greeted them effusively. Mrs. Warmore noticed
Tom, and bowed to him, inviting him to enter the carriage and
ride with them,&mdash;an invitation which, as he expressed to himself,
he would not have accepted for seventeen thousand million dollars.
The dude stepped into the carriage, dropped into the seat facing
the ladies, and devoted himself to gnawing the head of his cane
and making bright remarks to them.</p>

<p>"Well, who in the name of the seven wonders can he be?" mused
Tom, walking briskly homeward. "He must be some relative of the
Warmores; but they ought to be ashamed of such a specimen as that.
He was the laughing-stock of the boat. I was forming quite an
exalted opinion of Miss Jennie; but if she fancies that sort of
thing, my respect for her has gone down to zero."</p>

<p>When Tom stepped upon the porch of Farmer Pitcairn's home, and
shook hands with him, and received a motherly kiss from his good
wife, he went inside, and, sitting down to their evening meal,
asked Mr. Pitcairn whether he had noticed the young man riding
in the Warmore carriage with the mother and daughter.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've seen him before. He is a son of an old friend of the
family. I've an idee that he and Miss Warmore are intended for
each other."</p>

<p>"Do you know his name?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;let me see. Ah, it is Catherwood &mdash;G. Field Catherwood.
He parts his name, like his hair, in the middle. He is quite a
dude in his dress, but when you come to know him pretty well he
isn't such a bad sort of fellow."</p>

<p>"How is it <em>you</em> know so much about him?" asked Tom in
surprise.</p>

<p>"He has stopped here a good many times when out riding with the
ladies. He's fond of mother's buttermilk."</p>

<p>"I thought his kind preferred sweet milk," Tom could not help
remarking, with a laugh; "but I must not judge him too harshly.
We all have our peculiarities, and he is not likely to fancy me
any more than I do him."</p>

<p>Tom returned to his work refreshed and renewed in strength and
spirits. The year passed pleasantly. That which followed saw him
promoted another step, so that when the fourth year opened it
saw him in a situation where the salary of but a single employee
exceeded his; that was the bookkeeper.</p>

<p>He had every reason to expect that place when the vacancy should
occur. Mr. Warmore had given so many evidences of his regard that
it was conceded by all that he was his favorite clerk. He had
never violated his principles of honesty, truthfulness, and consideration
for every one with whom he came in contact. A young man who lives
up to that rule of conduct is as sure to succeed, if his life
is spared, as the sun is to rise.</p>

<p>The bookkeeper was an elderly gentleman, so well-to-do that,
at the beginning of the fifth year, he resigned and gave up all
active work. His son was engaged in successful business in New
York, and urged his father to join him, where he would be a partner.
So he left. His successor in the establishment of Mr. Warmore,
instead of being Tom Gordon, was G. Field Catherwood.</p>
