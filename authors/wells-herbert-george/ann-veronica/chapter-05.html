Ann Veronica had an impression that she did not sleep at all that
night, and at any rate she got through an immense amount of
feverish feeling and thinking.
<P>
What was she going to do?
<P>
One main idea possessed her: she must get away from home, she
must assert herself at once or perish. "Very well," she would
say, "then I must go."  To remain, she felt, was to concede
everything.  And she would have to go to-morrow.  It was clear it
must be to-morrow.  If she delayed a day she would delay two
days, if she delayed two days she would delay a week, and after a
week things would be adjusted to submission forever.  "I'll go,"
she vowed to the night, "or I'll die!"  She made plans and
estimated means and resources.  These and her general
preparations had perhaps a certain disproportion.  She had a gold
watch, a very good gold watch that had been her mother's, a pearl
necklace that was also pretty good, some unpretending rings, some
silver bangles and a few other such inferior trinkets, three
pounds thirteen shillings unspent of her dress and book allowance
and a few good salable books.  So equipped, she proposed to set
up a separate establishment in the world.
<P>
And then she would find work.
<P>
For most of a long and fluctuating night she was fairly confident
that she would find work; she knew herself to be strong,
intelligent, and capable by the standards of most of the girls
she knew.  She was not quite clear how she should find it, but
she felt she would.  Then she would write and tell her father
what she had done, and put their relationship on a new footing.
<P>
That was how she projected it, and in general terms it seemed
plausible and possible.  But in between these wider phases of
comparative confidence were gaps of disconcerting doubt, when the
universe was presented as making sinister and threatening faces
at her, defying her to defy, preparing a humiliating and shameful
overthrow.  "I don't care," said Ann Veronica to the darkness;
"I'll fight it."
<P>
She tried to plan her proceedings in detail.  The only
difficulties that presented themselves clearly to her were the
difficulties of getting away from Morningside Park, and not the
difficulties at the other end of the journey.  These were so
outside her experience that she found it possible to thrust them
almost out of sight by saying they would be "all right" in
confident tones to herself.  But still she knew they were not
right, and at times they became a horrible obsession as of
something waiting for her round the corner.  She tried to imagine
herself "getting something," to project herself as sitting down
at a desk and writing, or as returning after her work to some
pleasantly equipped and free and independent flat.  For a time
she furnished the flat.  But even with that furniture it remained
extremely vague, the possible good and the possible evil as well!
<P>
The possible evil!  "I'll go," said Ann Veronica for the
hundredth time.  "I'll go.  I don't care WHAT happens."
<P>
She awoke out of a doze, as though she had never been sleeping. 
It was time to get up.
<P>
She sat on the edge of her bed and looked about her, at her room,
at the row of black-covered books and the pig's skull.  "I must
take them," she said, to help herself over her own incredulity. 
"How shall I get my luggage out of the house? . . ."
<P>
The figure of her aunt, a little distant, a little propitiatory,
behind the coffee things, filled her with a sense of almost
catastrophic adventure.  Perhaps she might never come back to
that breakfast-room again. Never!  Perhaps some day, quite soon,
she might regret that breakfast-room.  She helped herself to the
remainder of the slightly congealed bacon, and reverted to the
problem of getting her luggage out of the house.  She decided to
call in the help of Teddy Widgett, or, failing him, of one of his
sisters.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 2
<P>
<P>
She found the younger generation of the Widgetts engaged in
languid reminiscences, and all, as they expressed it, a "bit
decayed."  Every one became tremendously animated when they heard
that Ann Veronica had failed them because she had been, as she
expressed it, "locked in."
<P>
"My God!" said Teddy, more impressively than ever.
<P>
"But what are you going to do?" asked Hetty.
<P>
"What can one do?" asked Ann Veronica.  "Would you stand it?  I'm
going to clear out."
<P>
"Clear out?" cried Hetty.
<P>
"Go to London," said Ann Veronica.
<P>
She had expected sympathetic admiration, but instead the whole
Widgett family, except Teddy, expressed a common dismay.  "But
how can you?" asked Constance.  "Who will you stop with?"
<P>
"I shall go on my own.  Take a room!"
<P>
"I say!" said Constance.  "But who's going to pay for the room?"
<P>
"I've got money," said Ann Veronica.  "Anything is better than
this--this stifled life down here." And seeing that Hetty and
Constance were obviously developing objections, she plunged at
once into a demand for help.  "I've got nothing in the world to
pack with except a toy size portmanteau.  Can you lend me some
stuff?"
<P>
"You ARE a chap!" said Constance, and warmed only slowly from the
idea of dissuasion to the idea of help.  But they did what they
could for her.  They agreed to lend her their hold-all and a
large, formless bag which they called the communal trunk.  And
Teddy declared himself ready to go to the ends of the earth for
her, and carry her luggage all the way.
<P>
Hetty, looking out of the window--she always smoked her
after-breakfast cigarette at the window  for the benefit of the
less advanced section of Morningside Park society--and trying not
to raise objections, saw Miss Stanley going down toward the
shops.
<P>
"If you must go on with it," said Hetty, "now's your time."  And
Ann Veronica at once went back with the hold-all, trying not to
hurry indecently but to keep up her dignified air of being a
wronged person doing the right thing at a smart trot, to pack. 
Teddy went round by the garden backs and dropped the bag over the
fence.  All this was exciting and entertaining.  Her aunt
returned before the packing was done, and Ann Veronica lunched
with an uneasy sense of bag and hold-all packed up-stairs and
inadequately hidden from chance intruders by the valance of the
bed. She went down, flushed and light-hearted, to the Widgetts'
after lunch to make some final arrangements and then, as soon as
her aunt had retired to lie down for her usual digestive hour,
took the risk of the servants having the enterprise to report her
proceedings and carried her bag and hold-all to the garden gate,
whence Teddy, in a state of ecstatic service, bore them to the
railway station.  Then she went up-stairs again, dressed herself
carefully for town, put on her most businesslike-looking hat, and
with a wave of emotion she found it hard to control, walked down
to catch the 3.17 up-train.
<P>
Teddy handed her into the second-class compartment her
season-ticket warranted, and declared she was "simply splendid." 
"If you want anything," he said, "or get into any trouble, wire
me.  I'd come back from the ends of the earth.  I'd do anything,
Vee.  It's horrible to think of you!"
<P>
"You're an awful brick, Teddy!" she said.
<P>
"Who wouldn't be for you?"
<P>
The train began to move.  "You're splendid!" said Teddy, with his
hair wild in the wind.  "Good luck! Good luck!"
<P>
She waved from the window until the bend hid him.
<P>
She found herself alone in the train asking herself what she must
do next, and trying not to think of herself as cut off from home
or any refuge whatever from the world she had resolved to face. 
She felt smaller and more adventurous even than she had expected
to feel.  "Let me see," she said to herself, trying to control a
slight sinking of the heart, "I am going to take a room in a
lodging-house because that is cheaper. . . .  But perhaps I had
better get a room in an hotel to-night and look round. . . .
<P>
"It's bound to be all right," she said.
<P>
But her heart kept on sinking.  What hotel should she go to?  If
she told a cabman to drive to an hotel, any hotel, what would he
do--or say?  He might drive to something dreadfully expensive,
and not at all the quiet sort of thing she required.  Finally she
decided that even for an hotel she must look round, and that
meanwhile she would "book" her luggage at Waterloo.  She told the
porter to take it to the booking-office, and it was only after a
disconcerting moment or so that she found she ought to have
directed him to go to the cloak-room.  But that was soon put
right, and she walked out into London with a peculiar exaltation
of mind, an exaltation that partook of panic and defiance, but
was chiefly a sense of vast unexampled release.
<P>
She inhaled a deep breath of air--London air.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 3
<P>
<P>
She dismissed the first hotels she passed, she scarcely knew why,
mainly perhaps from the mere dread of entering them, and crossed
Waterloo Bridge at a leisurely pace.  It was high afternoon,
there was no great throng of foot-passengers, and many an eye
from omnibus and pavement rested gratefully on her fresh, trim
presence as she passed young and erect, with the light of
determination shining through the quiet self-possession of her
face.  She was dressed as English girls do dress for town,
without either coquetry or harshness: her collarless blouse
confessed a pretty neck, her eyes were bright and steady, and her
dark hair waved loosely and graciously over her ears. . . .
<P>
It seemed at first the most beautiful afternoon of all time to
her, and perhaps the thrill of her excitement did add a
distinctive and culminating keenness to the day. The river, the
big buildings on the north bank, Westminster, and St. Paul's,
were rich and wonderful with the soft sunshine of London, the
softest, the finest grained, the most penetrating and least
emphatic sunshine in the world.  The very carts and vans and cabs
that Wellington Street poured out incessantly upon the bridge
seemed ripe and good in her eyes.  A traffic of copious barges
slumbered over the face of the river-barges either altogether
stagnant or dreaming along in the wake of fussy tugs; and above
circled, urbanely voracious, the London seagulls.  She had never
been there before at that hour, in that light, and it seemed to
her as if she came to it all for the first time.  And this great
mellow place, this London, now was hers, to struggle with, to go
where she pleased in, to overcome and live in.  "I am glad," she
told herself, "I came."
<P>
She marked an hotel that seemed neither opulent nor odd in a
little side street opening on the Embankment, made up her mind
with an effort, and, returning by Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo,
took a cab to this chosen refuge with her two pieces of luggage. 
There was just a minute's hesitation before they gave her a room.
<P>
The young lady in the bureau said she would inquire, and Ann
Veronica, while she affected to read the appeal on a hospital
collecting-box upon the bureau counter, had a disagreeable sense
of being surveyed from behind by a small, whiskered gentleman in
a frock-coat, who came out of the inner office and into the hall
among a number of equally observant green porters to look at her
and her bags.  But the survey was satisfactory, and she found
herself presently in Room No. 47, straightening her hat and
waiting for her luggage to appear.
<P>
"All right so far," she said to herself. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 4
<P>
<P>
But presently, as she sat on the one antimacassared red silk
chair and surveyed her hold-all and bag in that tidy, rather
vacant, and dehumanized apartment, with its empty wardrobe and
desert toilet-table and pictureless walls and stereotyped
furnishings, a sudden blankness came upon her as though she
didn't matter, and had been thrust away into this impersonal
corner, she and her gear. . . .
<P>
She decided to go out into the London afternoon again and get
something to eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place, and
perhaps find a cheap room for herself.  Of course that was what
she had to do; she had to find a cheap room for herself and work!
<P>
This Room No. 47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment
on the way to that.
<P>
How does one get work?
<P>
She walked along the Strand and across Trafalgar Square, and by
the Haymarket to Piccadilly, and so through dignified squares and
palatial alleys to Oxford Street; and her mind was divided
between a speculative treatment of employment on the one hand,
and breezes --zephyr breezes--of the keenest appreciation for
London, on the other.  The jolly part of it was that for the
first time in her life so far as London was concerned, she was
not going anywhere in particular; for the first time in her life
it seemed to her she was taking London in.
<P>
She tried to think how people get work.  Ought she to walk into
some of these places and tell them what she could do?  She
hesitated at the window of a shipping-office in Cockspur Street
and at the Army and Navy Stores, but decided that perhaps there
would be some special and customary hour, and that it would be
better for her to find this out before she made her attempt. And,
besides, she didn't just immediately want to make her attempt.
<P>
She fell into a pleasant dream of positions and work. Behind
every one of these myriad fronts she passed there must be a
career or careers.  Her ideas of women's employment and a modern
woman's pose in life were based largely on the figure of Vivie
Warren in Mrs. Warren's Profession.  She had seen Mrs. Warren's
Profession furtively with Hetty Widgett from the gallery of a
Stage Society performance one Monday afternoon. Most of it had
been incomprehensible to her, or comprehensible in a way that
checked further curiosity, but the figure of Vivien, hard,
capable, successful, and bullying, and ordering about a veritable
Teddy in the person of Frank Gardner, appealed to her.  She saw
herself in very much Vivie's position--managing something.
<P>
Her thoughts were deflected from Vivie Warren by the peculiar
behavior of a middle-aged gentleman in Piccadilly.  He appeared
suddenly from the infinite in the neighborhood of the Burlington
Arcade, crossing the pavement toward her and with his eyes upon
her. He seemed to her indistinguishably about her father's age. 
He wore a silk hat a little tilted, and a morning coat buttoned
round a tight, contained figure; and a white slip gave a finish
to his costume and endorsed the quiet distinction of his tie. 
His face was a little flushed perhaps, and his small, brown eyes
were bright.  He stopped on the curb-stone, not facing her but as
if he was on his way to cross the road, and spoke to her suddenly
over his shoulder.
<P>
"Whither away?" he said, very distinctly in a curiously wheedling
voice.  Ann Veronica stared at his foolish, propitiatory smile,
his hungry gaze, through one moment of amazement, then stepped
aside and went on her way with a quickened step.  But her mind
was ruffled, and its mirror-like surface of satisfaction was not
easily restored.
<P>
Queer old gentleman!
<P>
The art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every
well-bred girl, so carefully instilled that at last she can even
ignore her own thoughts and her own knowledge.  Ann Veronica
could at the same time ask herself what this queer old gentleman
could have meant by speaking to her, and know--know in general
terms, at least--what that accosting signified.  About her, as
she had gone day by day to and from the Tredgold College, she had
seen and not seen many an incidental aspect of those sides of
life about which girls are expected to know nothing, aspects that
were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and outlook on
the world, and yet by convention ineffably remote.  For all that
she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise, she had never yet
considered these things with unaverted eyes.  She had viewed them
askance, and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the
world about them.
<P>
She went on her way now no longer dreaming and appreciative, but
disturbed and unwillingly observant behind her mask of serene
contentment.
<P>
That delightful sense of free, unembarrassed movement was gone.
<P>
As she neared the bottom of the dip in Piccadilly she saw a woman
approaching her from the opposite direction--a tall woman who at
the first glance seemed altogether beautiful and fine.  She came
along with the fluttering assurance of some tall ship.  Then as
she drew nearer paint showed upon her face, and a harsh purpose
behind the quiet expression of her open countenance, and a sort
of unreality in her splendor betrayed itself for which Ann
Veronica could not recall the right word --a word, half
understood, that lurked and hid in her mind, the word
"meretricious."  Behind this woman and a little to the side of
her, walked a man smartly dressed, with desire and appraisal in
his eyes.  Something insisted that those two were mysteriously
linked--that the woman knew the man was there.
<P>
It was a second reminder that against her claim to go free and
untrammelled there was a case to be made, that after all it was
true that a girl does not go alone in the world unchallenged, nor
ever has gone freely alone in the world, that evil walks abroad
and dangers, and petty insults more irritating than dangers,
lurk.
<P>
It was in the quiet streets and squares toward Oxford Street that
it first came into her head disagreeably that she herself was
being followed.  She observed a man walking on the opposite side
of the way and looking toward her.
<P>
"Bother it all!" she swore.  "Bother!" and decided that this was
not so, and would not look to right or left again.
<P>
Beyond the Circus Ann Veronica went into a British Tea-Table
Company shop to get some tea.  And as she was yet waiting for her
tea to come she saw this man again.  Either it was an unfortunate
recovery of a trail, or he had followed her from Mayfair.  There
was no mistaking his intentions this time.  He came down the shop
looking for her quite obviously, and took up a position on the
other side against a mirror in which he was able to regard her
steadfastly.
<P>
Beneath the serene unconcern of Ann Veronica's face was a boiling
tumult.  She was furiously angry.  She gazed with a quiet
detachment toward the window and the Oxford Street traffic, and
in her heart she was busy kicking this man to death.  He HAD
followed her! What had he followed her for?  He must have
followed her all the way from beyond Grosvenor Square.
<P>
He was a tall man and fair, with bluish eyes that were rather
protuberant, and long white hands of which he made a display.  He
had removed his silk hat, and now sat looking at Ann Veronica
over an untouched cup of tea; he sat gloating upon her, trying to
catch her eye. Once, when he thought he had done so, he smiled an
ingratiating smile.  He moved, after quiet intervals, with a
quick little movement, and ever and again stroked his small
mustache and coughed a self-conscious cough.
<P>
"That he should be in the same world with me!" said Ann Veronica,
reduced to reading the list of good things the British Tea-Table
Company had priced for its patrons.
<P>
Heaven knows what dim and tawdry conceptions of passion and
desire were in that blond cranium, what romance-begotten dreams
of intrigue and adventure! but they sufficed, when presently Ann
Veronica went out into the darkling street again, to inspire a
flitting, dogged pursuit, idiotic, exasperating, indecent.
<P>
She had no idea what she should do.  If she spoke to a policeman
she did not know what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to
charge this man and appear in a police-court next day.
<P>
She became angry with herself.  She would not be driven in by
this persistent, sneaking aggression.  She would ignore him. 
Surely she could ignore him.  She stopped abruptly, and looked in
a flower-shop window. He passed, and came loitering back and
stood beside her, silently looking into her face.
<P>
The afternoon had passed now into twilight.  The shops were
lighting up into gigantic lanterns of color, the street lamps
were glowing into existence, and she had lost her way.  She had
lost her sense of direction, and was among unfamiliar streets. 
She went on from street to street, and all the glory of London
had departed.  Against the sinister, the threatening, monstrous
inhumanity of the limitless city, there was nothing now but this
supreme, ugly fact of a pursuit--the pursuit of the undesired,
persistent male.
<P>
For a second time Ann Veronica wanted to swear at the universe.
<P>
There were moments when she thought of turning upon this man and
talking to him.  But there was something in his face at once
stupid and invincible that told her he would go on forcing
himself upon her, that he would esteem speech with her a great
point gained. In the twilight he had ceased to be a person one
could tackle and shame; he had become something more general, a
something that crawled and sneaked toward her and would not let
her alone. . . .
<P>
Then, when the tension was getting unendurable, and she was on
the verge of speaking to some casual passer-by and demanding
help, her follower vanished. For a time she could scarcely
believe he was gone.  He had.  The night had swallowed him up,
but his work on her was done.  She had lost her nerve, and there
was no more freedom in London for her that night. She was glad to
join in the stream of hurrying homeward workers that was now
welling out of a thousand places of employment, and to imitate
their driven, preoccupied haste.  She had followed a bobbing
white hat and gray jacket until she reached the Euston Road
corner of Tottenham Court Road, and there, by the name on a bus
and the cries of a conductor, she made a guess of her way.  And
she did not merely affect to be driven--she felt driven.  She was
afraid people would follow her, she was afraid of the dark, open
doorways she passed, and afraid of the blazes of light; she was
afraid to be alone, and she knew not what it was she feared.
<P>
It was past seven when she got back to her hotel. She thought
then that she had shaken off the man of the bulging blue eyes
forever, but that night she found he followed her into her
dreams.  He stalked her, he stared at her, he craved her, he
sidled slinking and propitiatory and yet relentlessly toward her,
until at last she awoke from the suffocating nightmare nearness
of his approach, and lay awake in fear and horror listening to
the unaccustomed sounds of the hotel.
<P>
She came very near that night to resolving that she would return
to her home next morning.  But the morning brought courage again,
and those first intimations of horror vanished completely from
her mind.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 5
<P>
<P>
She had sent her father a telegram from the East Strand
post-office worded thus:   
<P>
|   All   |    is     |   well   |   with   |   me    |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------|---------| 
|   and   |   quite   |   safe   | Veronica |         | 
 -----------------------------------------------------
<P>
and afterward she had dined a la carte upon a cutlet, and had
then set herself to write an answer to Mr. Manning's proposal of
marriage.  But she had found it very difficult.
<P>
<P>
"DEAR MR. MANNING, she had begun.  So far it had been plain
sailing, and it had seemed fairly evident to go on:  "I find it
very difficult to answer your letter."
<P>
But after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had
fallen thinking of the events of the day. She had decided that
she would spend the next morning answering advertisements in the
papers that abounded in the writing-room; and so, after half an
hour's perusal of back numbers of the Sketch in the drawing-room,
she had gone to bed.
<P>
She found next morning, when she came to this advertisement
answering, that it was more difficult than she had supposed.  In
the first place there were not so many suitable advertisements as
she had expected. She sat down by the paper-rack with a general
feeling of resemblance to Vivie Warren, and looked through the
Morning Post and Standard and Telegraph, and afterward the
half-penny sheets.  The Morning Post was hungry for governesses
and nursery governesses, but held out no other hopes; the Daily
Telegraph that morning seemed eager only for skirt hands.  She
went to a writing-desk and made some memoranda on a sheet of
note-paper, and then remembered that she had no address as yet to
which letters could be sent.
<P>
She decided to leave this matter until the morrow and devote the
morning to settling up with Mr. Manning.  At the cost of quite a
number of torn drafts she succeeded in evolving this:
<P>
"DEAR MR. MANNING,--I find it very difficult to answer your
letter.  I hope you won't mind if I say first that I think it
does me an extraordinary honor that you should think of any one
like myself so highly and seriously, and, secondly, that I wish
it had not been written."
<P>
She surveyed this sentence for some time before going on.  "I
wonder," she said, "why one writes him sentences like that? 
It'll have to go," she decided, "I've written too many already." 
She went on, with a desperate attempt to be easy and colloquial:
<P>
"You see, we were rather good friends, I thought, and now perhaps
it will be difficult for us to get back to the old friendly
footing.  But if that can possibly be done I want it to be done. 
You see, the plain fact of the case is that I think I am too
young and ignorant for marriage.  I have been thinking these
things over lately, and it seems to me that marriage for a girl
is just the supremest thing in life. It isn't just one among a
number of important things; for her it is the important thing,
and until she knows far more than I know of the facts of life,
how is she to undertake it? So please; if you will, forget that
you wrote that letter, and forgive this answer.  I want you to
think of me just as if I was a man, and quite outside marriage
altogether.
<P>
"I do hope you will be able to do this, because I value men
friends.  I shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a
friend.  I think that there is no better friend for a girl than a
man rather older than herself.
<P>
"Perhaps by this time you will have heard of the step I have
taken in leaving my home.  Very likely you will disapprove highly
of what I have done--l wonder?  You may, perhaps, think I have
done it just in a fit of childish petulance because my father
locked me in when I wanted to go to a ball of which he did not
approve.  But really it is much more than that.  At Morningside
Park I feel as though all my growing up was presently to stop, as
though I was being shut in from the light of life, and, as they
say in botany, etiolated.  I was just like a sort of dummy that
does things as it is told--that is to say, as the strings are
pulled.  I want to be a person by myself, and to pull my own
strings.  I had rather have trouble and hardship like that than
be taken care of by others.  I want to be myself. l wonder if a
man can quite understand that passionate feeling?  It is quite a
passionate feeling.  So I am already no longer the girl you knew
at Morningside Park. I am a young person seeking employment and
freedom and self-development, just as in quite our first talk of
all I said I wanted to be.
<P>
"I do hope you will see how things are, and not be offended with
me or frightfully shocked and distressed by what I have done.    
<P>
                    "Very sincerely yours,                       
<P>
           "ANN VERONICA STANLEY."
<P>
<P>
<P>
Part 6
<P>
<P>
In the afternoon she resumed her search for apartments. The
intoxicating sense of novelty had given place to a more
business-like mood.  She drifted northward from the Strand, and
came on some queer and dingy quarters.
<P>
She had never imagined life was half so sinister as it looked to
her in the beginning of these investigations. She found herself
again in the presence of some element in life about which she had
been trained not to think, about which she was perhaps
instinctively indisposed to think; something which jarred, in
spite of all her mental resistance, with all her preconceptions
of a clean and courageous girl walking out from Morningside Park
as one walks out of a cell into a free and spacious world. One or
two landladies refused her with an air of conscious virtue that
she found hard to explain.  "We don't let to ladies," they said.
<P>
She drifted, via Theobald's Road, obliquely toward the region
about Titchfield Street.  Such apartments as she saw were either
scandalously dirty or unaccountably dear, or both.  And some were
adorned with engravings that struck her as being more vulgar and
undesirable than anything she had ever seen in her life.  Ann
Veronica loved beautiful things, and the beauty of undraped
loveliness not least among them; but these were pictures that did
but insist coarsely upon the roundness of women's bodies.  The
windows of these rooms were obscured with draperies, their floors
a carpet patchwork; the china ornaments on their mantels were of
a class apart.  After the first onset several of the women who
had apartments to let said she would not do for them, and in
effect dismissed her.  This also struck her as odd.
<P>
About many of these houses hung a mysterious taint as of
something weakly and commonly and dustily evil; the women who
negotiated the rooms looked out through a friendly manner as
though it was a mask, with hard, defiant eyes.  Then one old
crone, short-sighted and shaky-handed, called Ann Veronica
"dearie," and made some remark, obscure and slangy, of which the
spirit rather than the words penetrated to her understanding.
<P>
For a time she looked at no more apartments, and walked through
gaunt and ill-cleaned streets, through the sordid under side of
life, perplexed and troubled, ashamed of her previous obtuseness.
<P>
She had something of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has
been into surroundings or touched something that offends his
caste.  She passed people in the streets and regarded them with a
quickening apprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in
slatternly finery, going toward Regent Street from out these
places. It did not occur to her that they at least had found a
way of earning a living, and had that much economic superiority
to herself.  It did not occur to her that save for some accidents
of education and character they had souls like her own.
<P>
For a time Ann Veronica went on her way gauging the quality of
sordid streets.  At last, a little way to the northward of Euston
Road, the moral cloud seemed to lift, the moral atmosphere to
change; clean blinds appeared in the windows, clean doorsteps
before the doors, a different appeal in the neatly placed cards
bearing the word

in the clear bright windows.  At last in a street near the
Hampstead Road she hit upon a room that had an exceptional
quality of space and order, and a tall woman with a kindly face
to show it.  "You're a student, perhaps?" said the tall woman. 
"At the Tredgold Women's College," said Ann Veronica.  She felt
it would save explanations if she did not state she had left her
home and was looking for employment. The room was papered with
green, large-patterned paper that was at worst a trifle dingy,
and the arm-chair and the seats of the other chairs were covered
with the unusual brightness of a large-patterned chintz, which
also supplied the window-curtain.  There was a round table
covered, not with the usual "tapestry" cover, but with a plain
green cloth that went passably with the wall-paper.  In the
recess beside the fireplace were some open bookshelves.  The
carpet was a quiet drugget and not excessively worn, and the bed
in the corner was covered by a white quilt.  There were neither
texts nor rubbish on the walls, but only a stirring version of
Belshazzar's feast, a steel engraving in the early Victorian
manner that had some satisfactory blacks.  And the woman who
showed this room was tall, with an understanding eye and the
quiet manner of the well-trained servant.
<P>
Ann Veronica brought her luggage in a cab from the hotel; she
tipped the hotel porter sixpence and overpaid the cabman
eighteenpence, unpacked some of her books and possessions, and so
made the room a little homelike, and then sat down in a by no
means uncomfortable arm-chair before the fire.  She had arranged
for a supper of tea, a boiled egg, and some tinned peaches.  She
had discussed the general question of supplies with the helpful
landlady.  "And now," said Ann Veronica surveying her apartment
with an unprecedented sense of proprietorship, "what is the next
step?"
<P>
She spent the evening in writing--it was a little difficult--to
her father and--which was easier--to the Widgetts.  She was
greatly heartened by doing this.  The necessity of defending
herself and assuming a confident and secure tone did much to
dispell the sense of being exposed and indefensible in a huge
dingy world that abounded in sinister possibilities. She
addressed her letters, meditated on them for a time, and then
took them out and posted them.  Afterward she wanted to get her
letter to her father back in order to read it over again, and, if
it tallied with her general impression of it, re-write it.
<P>
He would know her address to-morrow.  She reflected upon that
with a thrill of terror that was also, somehow, in some faint
remote way, gleeful.
<P>
"Dear old Daddy," she said, "he'll make a fearful fuss.  Well, it
had to happen somewhen. . . .  Somehow. I wonder what he'll say?"
