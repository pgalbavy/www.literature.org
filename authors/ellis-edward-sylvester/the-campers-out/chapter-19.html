<p>Had Jim McGovern taken another course when starting out on the
war-path, he would not have met such overwhelming disaster, for
he would have encountered Bob Budd returning from an experience
hardly less stirring than his own; but the two followed different
routes and did not see each other until they met in camp, after
both had been through their experience and the night was well
advanced.</p>

<p>Reaching the highway, Dick mounted his bicycle and continued
his journey homeward at an easy pace. There was a faint moon in
the sky, and now and then the wind blew fitfully among the tree
branches, but he was in good spirits. The words of the physician
concerning his father encouraged him greatly, and he was happy
over the unexpected manner in which he had recovered his bicycle.
Mr. Hunter had notified him that day, that, on the first of the
following month, his wages would be increased, and that so long
as he showed the same devotion to his interests, he might count
upon a yearly repetition of the favor.</p>

<p>"I’m luckier than I deserve," he reflected, as he skimmed over
the highway, "for I was able to attend school until I graduated,
and Mr. Hunter, who was one of the trustees, told me that afternoon
that he had had his eye on me for several years and wanted me.
Well, I have tried to do as father and mother taught me when I
was a little fellow, and I’ve no doubt that that’s the reason
for it all. I can’t understand how any one can show the meanness
of Bob Budd and those boys he has with him. There was no earthly
excuse for stealing my bicycle—Hello! there’s some one in the
road yonder."</p>

<p>He was approaching a clump of trees where the shadows were so
thick that he could not see distinctly, but he was certain he
observed a figure step back as if to avoid being noticed.</p>

<p>Dick gently applied the brake to his wheel and hesitated whether
to go on or not. He recalled that he had heard rumors of robbery
and attempts at burglary in the neighborhood within the past week.
Indeed, there were signs discovered that very morning that proved
an effort had been made to pry open one of the shutters of Mr.
Hunter’s store; but the marauders were scared off by the dog that
was kept on duty every night.</p>

<p>Suppose one of these criminals had located himself alongside
the road for the purpose of robbing passers-by!</p>

<p>"He wouldn’t get much from <em>me</em>" reflected Dick, who had
less than a single dollar in change with him, "but, all the same,
I don’t fancy being stopped by him. He might shoot me because
of his disappointment. Maybe he thinks I am like some other clerks,
who make a practice of robbing their employers."</p>

<p>By this time the bicycle was hardly moving, the headway being
just sufficient to enable him to keep his poise. He peered intently
forward, ready to turn and speed down the road on the first sign
of danger; but if a person was skulking among the trees, he took
good care to keep out of sight, and whether or not Dick was mistaken
could be learned only by going forward.</p>

<p>He was thinking fast. If he wished to reach home, where his parents
were expecting him, this was the only road, unless he went back
to town and made a circuit of eight or ten miles, a proceeding
not to be thought of when he was already within a half-mile of
his own door.</p>

<p>True, he might adopt another method. He could return until beyond
sight of the rogue, whoever he was, leave his bicycle at the roadside,
and then cut across lots on foot.</p>

<p>But Dick was a plucky youth, and could not bear the thought of
fleeing from danger whose nature he did not understand.</p>

<p>"No, I’ll go ahead," he muttered, compressing his lips, as he
removed the brake and began gradually increasing his speed. "If
he stops me, why, there’ll be a fight, that’s all!"</p>

<p>His plan was to "put on all steam" and dash through the gloomy
space, which was only a few rods in extent. By doing so he counted
upon surprising any enemy that might be lurking there and getting
beyond his reach before he could interpose.</p>

<p>There was but one difficulty in the way. He had already approached
so near the clump of trees that he could not well obtain the necessary
speed. But he could try, and try he did.</p>

<p>The muscular legs bore down hard on the pedals, and the big wheel
began increasing its swift revolutions, but the pace was hardly
one-half what it would have been had he possessed a few more rods
in which to set things humming.</p>

<p>Dick Halliard had good cause for his misgivings. There was an
individual among the shadow of the trees, waiting, like a spider,
for a victim to come within his net.</p>

<p>At the moment of gliding into the shadow the youth saw him. He
was standing in the middle of the road, directly in his path.</p>

<p>"Out of the way, or I’ll run you down!" shouted Dick, aiming
apparently at him, but making a sharp turn to the left.</p>

<p>"Try it, if you dare!" called the stranger in a gruff voice.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" demanded Dick, bending all his efforts to
the task of flanking the fellow.</p>

<p>"I want <em>you</em>!" was the startling reply; "get down off
of that wheel before I fetch you down!"</p>

<p>Whoever the fellow was he kept in Dick’s path so persistently,
that despite all he could do he could not prevent a collision.
The bicycle fell with a resounding bang on its side, and the rider
was compelled to make a dexterous leap to save himself from going
down with it.</p>

<p>One of the most noticeable traits about the sinewy Dick was his
quickness of resource and presence of mind. While he suspected
the identity of the party who had thus stopped him, he was in
doubt until the last words were spoken. Then the young man in
his excitement forgot to disguise his tones. It was Bob Budd,
who had taken this occasion to carry out the threat he had made
so often in the presence of others.</p>

<p>Dick could not believe the bully meant to use any weapon, but
intended simply to chastise him. He meant to give the boy an unmerciful
beating.</p>

<p>It was this certainty that inspired Dick to assail him with all
the energy at his command.</p>

<p>The instant he was freed from his wheel, and, without uttering
the first word of warning, Dick let fly with both fists, in such
sharp and quick succession that the dazed bully went over on his
back, as if smitten by the hoof of a mule.</p>

<p>"I know you, Bob Budd!" said the younger youth, whose anger was
at a high point, "and you have been threatening me a long time;
now we’ll settle the business for good."</p>

<p>"I aint Bob Budd, either," replied that worthy, climbing to his
feet. Then seeing the absurdity of the situation, he added, desperately:</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Bob Budd, and I have a big account to square with
you."</p>

<p>"This is the time," said Dick, who, impatient at his slowness,
started to assail him the moment he got on his feet.</p>

<p>"Hold on," protested Bob, "can’t you wait till a fellow is up?
Why don’t you fight fair?"</p>

<p>"I’m holding on," returned Dick, edging round into the moonlight
where he could observe every movement of his antagonist; "but
I’m tired of waiting for you."</p>

<p>"I’m coming; you needn’t worry."</p>

<p>But the vigorous reception of the younger lad had taught the
bully to be careful. While he was as confident as the other Piketon
Ranger of his ability to "do him up," he saw the need of going
about it carefully. He threw out his arms in the most approved
style, and, as Dick slowly retreated a few steps, followed under
the belief that he was becoming timid and that the blows struck
a moment before were of a chance nature.</p>

<p>But the younger now had the elder in the moonlight, where he
could see every movement distinctly. He bounded at Bob again with
such fierce quickness that the big fellow was once more prostrate
ere he could strike or parry a blow.</p>

<p>"I guess that’s enough," said Dick, "but if you are not satisfied
I’ll wait."</p>

<p>"I’m not through with you yet," replied Bob, who was now in a
white heat of anger; so much so indeed that he hastily drew the
loaded revolver that he carried at all times. He had lost his
self-command and was determined to punish Dick Halliard, who had
turned the tables upon him with such vengeance.</p>
