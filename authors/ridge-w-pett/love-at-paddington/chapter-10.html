<p>Gertie's sympathy with the invalid of Morden Place found itself
slightly diminished on Monday morning.  The front room had not yet been
restored to its normal state, and Mrs. Mills, before rising to start
the boy with his delivery of morning newspapers, had given a brief
lecture on the drawback of excessive ambition, the advisability of not
going on to Land's End when you but held a ticket for Westbourne Park.
Ten minutes later she brought upstairs an important-looking envelope
that bore her name and address in handwriting which left just the space
for the stamp, and Mrs. Mills speculated on the probable contents of
the communication until Gertie made the useful suggestion that the
envelope should be opened.  Mrs. Mills, after reading the letter, flung
herself upon the bed and, her head resting on the pillow, sobbed
hysterically.
</p>
<p>Lady Douglass wrote near the telegram instructions "Private," and, to
ensure perfect secrecy, underlined the word three times.  Nevertheless,
Gertie read it without hesitation, and her first impression was one of
regard for the writer's ingenuity.  Lady Douglass feared some rumours
might have reached Praed Street concerning the behaviour of Miss Higham
during the brief stay at Ewelme; unable to rid her mind of this, she
was sending a note to assure Mrs. Mills that no grounds whatever
existed for the statements.  She, herself, had taken great trouble to
keep the incident quiet, and could not understand how it had become
public property.  She hoped Mrs. Mills would believe that Miss Higham
had been guilty of nothing more than a want of discretion, natural
enough in a girl of her age, and, if Lady Douglass might be allowed to
say so, her position in life.  Lady Douglass felt it only right to send
this note, and hoped her motives would be understood.
</p><p>"Her motives are clear enough," agreed Gertie.  "What I can't quite
make out is why she should take so much trouble in going for me.  I'm
out of her way, and I shan't get into her way again.  What more does
she want?"
</p><p>"I'd no idea," wailed her aunt, "that there'd been anything amiss.  Of
course, I knew you came back Sunday night instead of Monday morning,
but you hinted that was because of Clarence.  What are the facts, dear?"
</p><p>Particulars given, Mrs. Mills changed her attitude, both of body and of
mind, and announced an intention of starting at once to have it out
with her ladyship.  A good straight talking to, that was what my lady
required, with plain language which included selection of home truths,
and Mrs. Mills flattered herself she was the very woman to undertake
the task.  To this Gertie offered several determined objections.
First, Henry's sister-in-law was ill; second, she had endured trouble,
and was not perhaps quite herself; third, the incident was ended, and
there would be nothing useful in raking up the past.  Mrs. Mills
listened to the arguments, and agreed to substitute a new
resolution--namely, that a reply was to be written couched in terms
which could not be charged with the defect of ambiguity.
</p><p>"I shan't help you with the spelling," declared the girl.
</p><p>"Somehow or other," complained Mrs. Mills, "you always seem to manage
to get everything your own way."
</p><p>"Not always."
</p><p>One gratifying result of the evening party came in the fact that
Bulpert decreased his visits.  For two or three weeks he absented
himself from Praed Street; and Mrs. Mills approved this, mentioning as
one of the reasons, that it was not wise for an engaged couple to have
too much of each other's company.  When he did call, Mrs. Mills
reported of him that he appeared to have something on his mind; he left
before Gertie arrived, and without disclosing the nature of the burden.
</p><p>As a rule, it happened at Great Titchfield Street that one good
contract was followed by a slack period, when the difficulty was to
find sufficient work to keep all hands going.  But here and now, a high
authority ordered some alteration in the uniform of certain of His
Majesty's officers of the army, and either Madame or Miss Higham was
called frequently to Pall Mall; and, in a brief period, all the
outworkers were again busy: Great Titchfield Street found itself so
fully occupied that the girls had no time to recall songs learned at
the second house of their favourite music hall.  Into the hum and
activity of this busy hive came, one evening, Madame's husband, making
his way to the office where Madame and Miss Higham faced each other at
sloping desks.  He began to shout; it was clear that on the way from
King's Road he had been taking refreshment to encourage determination.
When he raised his fist, Gertie stepped forward.
</p><p>"Miss Higham," said Madame calmly, "I wish you would just run
downstairs and fetch a policeman."
</p><p>Madame's husband instantly showed a diminution of aggressiveness.  All
he wanted was fair play and reasonable treatment.  If there did not
happen to be a five-pound note handy, gold would do; failing gold, he
must, of course, be content with silver.
</p><p>"You will go out of this place at once," ordered Madame, in an even
voice; "and as a punishment for disobeying my orders, I shall not give
you a single penny all this week.  I know very well what you want money
for.  I know what you do with money when I give it to you."
</p><p>"Impossible to discuss these matt'rs with you," he said, with an effort
at haughtiness.  "Purely private 'fairs."
</p><p>"If it wasn't for the business here," she went on, "I think you'd
succeed in driving me mad.  This just saves me.  I'm not going to allow
you to interfere with it, and if you dare to come here again, I shall
most certainly lock you up.  Now be off with you."
</p><p>Mr. Digby Jacks wept, and, at the doorway, threatened to drown himself
in the Thames.  In the Thames, just to the right of Cleopatra's Needle.
</p><p>"I wish you would."
</p><p>"Shan't, now," he retorted sulkily, "just in order to dis'point you.
You're cruel woman, and some day you'll realize it and be sorry.  Goo'
night, and be hanged to you."
</p><p>Gertie congratulated Madame upon her firmness, and the other admitted
the situation was one not easy to handle.  For if, she explained, money
had been given, then he would have absented himself from Jubilee Place
for a week; as it was, he would be absent for a space of two or three
days.  Gertie expressed surprise at this behaviour, and Madame said it
was almost bound to happen where the wife earned an income, and the
husband gained none.  By rights, it should be the other way about, and
then there was a fair prospect of happiness.  Madame counselled the
girl to be careful not to imitate the example; Gertie replied that she
had long since made up her mind on this point.
</p><p>"But why don't you get rid of him?" she inquired.
</p><p>"Because I've left it too long.  Besides, I'm too old to get anybody
else."
</p><p>"Surely you'd be better off alone?"
</p><p>"No, I shouldn't," answered Madame promptly.  "What do you make the
proper total, my dear, of that account Miss Rabbit made a muddle of?"
</p>
<p>Within her experience it had sometimes happened that Gertie, on the way
home, found herself spoken to by a stranger; this rarely occurred,
because she walked with briskness, and refrained from glancing at other
pedestrians.  (Generally the intruder was a youth anxious to make or
sustain a reputation for gallantry, and he accepted the sharp rebuff
with docility.)  But news came from Miss Loriner that Lady Douglass,
after years of the luxury of imagining herself in delicate health, was
now genuinely ill, and Henry went down from town each evening by a late
train to make inquiries, returning in the morning.  Miss Loriner added
that some of Lady Douglass's indisposition might be due to the fact
that the executors were hinting at the eventual necessity of taking out
probate in regard to Sir Mark's will; this done, a considerable change
in affairs was inevitable.  In consequence of the information, Gertie
could not avoid looking about her in the vague hope of encountering
Henry; she wanted to see him, although she knew a meeting would only
disturb and confuse.  She waited outside the street door after business
was over, gazing up and down before making a start for home, and it
occurred frequently that a short man of middle age moved a few steps
towards her, and stopped; later, in turning out of Portland Place, she
observed he was following.  Once he came so close that she expected to
hear a whining voice complain of space of time since the last meal, and
having the superstition that casual charity appeased the gods, she
found some coppers; but he fell back, and did not speak.  It was at the
close of a trying day when the representative of a firm had called, in
Madame's absence, to have what he described in a preface as a jolly,
thundering good row, which finished by an endeavour on his part to
indicate apology by stroking Miss Higham's hand--on this night, Gertie,
less composed than usual, again caught sight, in crossing Great
Portland Street, of the short man.  He turned.  She, also turning, met
him in the centre of the roadway.
</p><p>"Do you want to speak to me?" she demanded sharply.
</p><p>"Not specially," he answered, in a husky voice.
</p><p>"Then why do you so often follow me about?"
</p><p>"I hope I don't cause you any ill convenience; if so be as I do, I'll
stop it at once."
</p><p>"That's all right," said Gertie, impressed by his deferential manner.
"Only it seemed to me rather odd.  And just now my nerves are somewhat
jerky."  He touched his cap, and was shuffling off, when she recalled
him.  "Stroll along with me, and let's have a talk.  What do you do for
a living?"
</p><p>"Sure you don't mind being seen with me?" he asked.
</p><p>"We'll go up Great Portland Street, and you can say 'good-bye' when we
reach the underground station."
</p><p>He buttoned his well-worn frock coat, gave himself a brisk punch on the
chest, and with every indication of pride, accompanied her, keeping,
however, slightly to the rear.  Gertie repeated her question, and he
replied it was not easy to explain how he gained a livelihood; odd
jobs, was perhaps the best answer he could give.  Warning her not to be
frightened, he gave the information that he had spent fifteen years of
his life in prison.  Did he begin young, then?  No, that was the
curious part about it.  He had little thought of starting the game
until, in one week, he lost his wife and, through the failure of a
firm, his employment.  Then it seemed to him nothing mattered, and
another out-of-work made a suggestion, and he fell into it, was caught,
and his friend managed to get away.
</p><p>"When I came out," he went on, "I found I'd lost all respect for
myself, and I assumed everybody else had lost all respect for me.  I
tell you, it isn't a hard task to go down in this world.  I've no
business to complain, but there it is; plenty can help you in that
direction, but there's very few capable of assisting you to pick
yourself up."
</p><p>"It's not too late to make a change."
</p><p>"I've got no luck, you see," he explained patiently.  "This summer I
did nearly get back to what you may call the old style.  I was in a
reg'lar job; I contrived to dress myself up almost like a duke, and I
sets out on Sunday afternoon with the full intention of calling on some
old friends I hadn't seen for a good many years.  It didn't come off."
</p><p>"Drink, I suppose."
</p><p>"Yes," he said.  "A chap driving one of these motors had taken a drop
too much.  I was in St. Mary's in Praed Street for over six weeks.  If
it had been anybody but me, the car would have been driven by some
well-to-do gentleman, and I should have found myself compensated for
life.  As I say, I never did have my share of good fortune, and I
s'pose I never shall.  All I haven't had of that, I hope will be passed
on to my daughter."
</p><p>"She ought to do something for you."
</p><p>"I don't want her to.  I've no wish to interfere with her.  I can't
flatter myself I've done her any good, and I'd like to have the
satisfaction of feeling I've done her no harm.  Here, I think," looking
around him, "we say oh revor."
</p><p>Gertie took out her purse; he gave an emphatic shake of the head, and
went.
</p><p>The next night he was at the same place, improved in appearance, and
Gertie allowed him to accompany her along Marylebone Road so far as
Harley Street.  On the following evening he furnished an escort to
Upper Baker Street, and afterwards extended the journey.  His manner
was always respectful, and he still made no attempt to walk abreast
with her.  Sometimes a constable would say, "Hullo, Joe!" and he
replied, "Good evening, sir.  Not bad weather for the time of year!"
and going on, informed Gertie where, and in what circumstances, the
acquaintance had been made.
</p><p>It happened, on one occasion, that Gertie saw Mr. Trew on the box seat
of his small brown omnibus coming along from the Great Central Station;
he was preparing to flourish a cheery salute, when he caught sight of
her companion.  Almost dropping his whip, he gave his head a jerk to
send the shining silk hat well back, and thus give relief to a suddenly
heated brain.
</p><p>Mrs. Mills was waiting on the Friday evening, some doors east of her
own shop; Gertie's new friend did not wait for instructions from his
companion, but left her instantly.
</p><p>"Who's looking after the counter, aunt?"
</p><p>"Mr. Bulpert," replied the other, panting.  "I've give him a cigar to
stick in his face.  He wants to see you.  And I want to see you, too.
Who is that you were talking to?"
</p><p>"The elderly man I told you about.  The one who always waits now to see
me part of the distance home.  Quite a character in his way."
</p><p>"Quite a bad character," snapped Mrs. Mills.
</p><p>"Do you know him?"
</p><p>Her aunt gave a gulp.  "I had the word from Mr. Trew," she said, still
rather breathless, "and his idea is that you may as well know it now as
later on.  That man is your father, my dear--your father; and the less
you see of him the better.  Now, perhaps, you can realize why I knew it
was no use letting you carry on with Mr. Douglass.  It was bound to
come out some day!"
</p><p>"My father," said the girl slowly and thoughtfully.
</p><p>"Your very own, dearie.  Don't let it upset you more than you can help.
I know you've a good deal to put up with just now.  Come along and see
Mr. Bulpert.  A little sweethearting talk will cheer you up."
</p><p>Bulpert admitted he had one or two questions to put; but on Gertie
ordering that they should be offered there and then, he said, gloomily,
that some other time would do as well.  The girl told him the news just
communicated by her aunt, and waited hopefully for the comment; Bulpert
remarked, with an indulgent air, that it took all sorts to make a
world, and he thought no worse of Gertie because of the fact that she
possessed a parent with a spotted record.  He offered to see her father
and give him a definitely worded warning; the girl answered that the
matter could be left in her hands.
</p><p>"But we don't want him to be a drain on us," he contended.  "I know
what these individuals are like.  Species of blackmail, that's what it
amounts to.  And I don't wish to see you working your fingers to the
bone, and a certain proportion of the money earned being paid out to
him.  I couldn't bear it, so I tell you straight!"  He slapped a pile
of magazines on the counter.
</p><p>"I'm rather worried," she said, "and I don't want any more
misunderstandings.  I told you not long ago I shouldn't go back to
Great Titchfield Street once I was married."
</p><p>"That's what I wanted to speak to you about.  You're not serious, I
s'pose, in saying this.  You're only doing it to test my affection."
</p><p>"I mean every word."
</p><p>"Very well!" announced Bulpert defiantly.  "Understand, then, that the
engagement's off.  Entirely and absolutely off.  And if you're so
ill-advised as to bring an action for breach, you jolly well can.
Won't be a bad advert, for a public man like F. W. B.  It'll get him
talked about!"
