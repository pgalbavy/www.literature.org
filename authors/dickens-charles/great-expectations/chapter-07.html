AT the time when I stood in the churchyard, reading the family 
tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. 
My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, 
for I read `wife of the Above' as a complimentary reference to my 
futher's exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased 
relations had been referred to as `Below,' I have no doubt I should 
have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family. 
Neither, were my notions of the theological positions to which my 
Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remem- 
brance that I supposed my declaration that I was to `walk in the 
same all the days of my life,' laid me under an obligation always to 
go through the village from our house in one particular direction, 
and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright's or up 
by the mill. 

<p>When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until 
I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs Joe called 
`Pompeyed,' or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not 
only odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to 
want an extra boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any 
such job, I was favoured with the employment. In order, however. 
that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a 
money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was 
publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped. I have 
an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards 
the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of 
any personal participation in the treasure. 

<p>Mr Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; 
that is to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and 
unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven 
every evening, in the society of youth who paid twopence per week 
each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented 
a small cottage, and Mr Wopsle had the room up-stairs, where we 
students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified 
and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling. 
There was a fiction that Mr Wopale `examined' the scholars, once 
a quarter. What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs, 
stick up his hair, and give us Mark Antony's oration over the body 
of Caesar. This was always followed by Collins's Ode on the 
Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr Wopale as Revenge, 
throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the 
War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not with 
me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the 
passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopale, rather to 
the disadvantage of both gentlemen. 

<p>Mr Wopale's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational In- 
stitution, kept -- in the same room -- a little general shop. She had no 
idea what stock she had, or what the price of anything in it was; 
but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, 
which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy 
arranged all the shop transactions. Biddy was Mr Wopale's great- 
aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself quite unequal to the 
working out of the problem, what relation she was to Mr Wopsle. 
She was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up 
by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her 
extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing, her hands always 
wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling 
up at heel. This description must be received with a week-day 
limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated. 

<p>Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than 
of Mr Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as 
if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and 
scratched by every letter. After that, I fell among those thieves, 
the nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new 
to disguise themselves and baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in 
a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very 
smallest scale. 

<p>One night, I was sitting in the chimney-corner with my slate, 
expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I 
think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, 
for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. 
With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived 
in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle: 

<p>`MI DEER JO i OPE U R gRWrTE WELL i OpE i SHAL 
soN B HhBELL 42 TEEDGE U JO AN 7HEN wE SHORL a 
sO OLODD hN wEN i M PRENOTD 2 U JO wOT LhRX 
flNBLEvEMErNFxNPrP.' 

<p>There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating 
with Joe by letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. 
But, I delivered this written communication (slate and all) with my 
own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition. 

<p>`I say, Pip, old chap!' cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, 
`what a scholar you are! An't you ?' 

<p>`I should like to be,' said I, glancing at the slate as he held it: 
with a misgiving that the writing was mther hilly. 

<p>`Why, here's a J,' said Joe, `and a O equal to anythink! Here's a 
J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.' 

<p>I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this 
monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday when I 
accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to 
suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing 
to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching 
Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, `Ah! But 
read the rest, Jo.' 

<p>`The rest, eh, Pip ? ' said Joe, looking at it with a slowly search- 
ing eye, `One, two, three. Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and 
three J-O, Joes in it, Pip!' 

<p>I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger, read him 
the whole letter. 

<p>`Astonishing! ' said Joe, when I had finished. `You AA RE a 
scholar.' 

<p>`How do you spell Gargery, Joe?' I asked him, with a modest 
patronage. 

<p>`I don't spell it at all,' said Joe. 

<p>`But supposing you did?' 

<p>`It <I>can't</I> be supposed,' said Joe. `Tho' I'm oncommon fond of 
reading, too.' 

<p>`Are you, Joe?' 

<p>`On-common. Give me,' said Joe, `a good book, or a good news- 
paper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. 
Lord!' he continued, after rubbing his knees a little, `when you do 
come to a J and a O, and says you, ``Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,'' 
how interesting reading is!' 

<p>I derived from this last, that Joe's education, like Steam, was 
yet in its infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired: 

<p>`Didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as 
me?' 

<p>`No, Pip.' 

<p>`Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little 
as me?' 

<p>`Well, Pip,' said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself 
to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking 
the fire between the lower bars: `I'll tell you. My father, Pip, he 
were given to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he 
hammered away at my mother, most onmerciful. It were a'most the 
only hammering he did, indeed, 'xcepting at myself. And he ham- 
mered at me with a wigour only to be equalled by the wigour with 
which he didn't hammer at his anwil. -- You're a listening and 
understandin g, Pip ?' 

<p>`Yes, Joe.' 

<p>`'Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father, 
several times; and then my mother she'd go out to work, and she'd 
say, ``Joe,'' she'd say, ``now, please God, you shall have some 
schooling, child,'' and she'd put me to school. But my father were 
that good in his hart that he couldn't abear to be without us. So, 
he'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at 
the doors of the houses where we was, that they used to be obli- 
gated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him. 
And then he took us home and hammered us. Which, you see, 
Pip,' said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the fire, and 
looking at me, `were a drawback on my learning.' 

<p>`Certainly, poor Joe!' 

<p>`Though mind you, Pip,' said Joe, with a judicial touch or two 
of the poker on the top bar, `rendering unto all their doo, and 
maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that 
good in his hart, don't you see? ' 

<p>I didn't see; but I didn't say so. 

<p>`Well!' Joe pursued, `somebody must keep the pot a biling 
Pip, or the pot won't bile, don't you know?' 

<p>I saw that, and said so. 

<p>`'Consequence, my father didn't make objections to my going 
to work; so I went to work at my present calling, which were his 
too, if he would have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I 
assure you, Pip. In time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till 
he went off in a purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have 
had put upon his tombstone that Whatsume'er the failings on his 
part, Remember reader he were that good in his hart.' 

<p>Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful 
perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself. 

<p>`I made it,' said Joe, `my own self. I made it in a moment. It was 
like striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never 
was so much surprised in all my life -- couldn't credit my own ed -- 
to tell you the truth, hardly believed it <I>were</I> my own ed. As I 
was saying, Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; 
but poetry costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and 
it were not done. Not to mention bearers, all the money that could 
be spared were wanted for my mother. She were in poor elth, and 
quite broke. She weren't long of following, poor soul, and her 
share of peace come round at last.' 

<p>Joe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed, first one of 
them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable 
manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker. 

<p>`It were but lonesome then,' said Joe, `living here alone, and I 
got acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip;' Joe looked firmly at 
me, as if he knew I was not going to agree with him; `your sister 
is a fine figure of a woman.' 

<p>I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt. 

<p>`Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, 
on that subject may be, Pip, your sister is,' Joe tapped the top bar 
with the poker after every word following, `a -- fine -- figure -- of -- 
a-- woman!' 

<p>I could think of nothing better to say than `I am glad you think 
so, Joe.' 

<p>`So am I,' returned Joe, catching me up. `I am glad I think so, 
Pip. A little redness, or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what 
does it signify to Me?' 

<p>I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him, to whom did it 
signify? 

<p>`Certainly!' assented Joe. `That's it. You're right, old chapl 
When I got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she 
was bringing you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks 
said, and I said, along with all the folks. As to you,' Joe pursued, 
with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty 
indeed: `if you could have been aware how small and flabby and 
mean you was, dear me, you'd have formed the most contemptible 
opinions of yourself!' 

<p>Not exactly relishing this, I said, `Never mind me, Joe.' 

<p>`But I did mind you, Pip,' he returned, with tender simplicity. 
`When I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked 
in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the 
forge, I said to her, ``And bring the poor little child. God bless the 
poor little child,'' I said to your sister, ``there's room for <I>him</I> at the 
forge!'' 

<p>I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round 
the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, `Ever 
the best of friends; an't us, Pip? Don't cry, old chap!' 

<p>When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed: 

<p>`Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it 
lights; here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learn- 
ing, Pip (and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful 
dull), Mrs Joe mustn't see too much of what we're up to. It must 
be done, as I may say, on the sly- And why on the sly? I'll tell you 
why, Pip.' 

<p>He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he 
could have proceeded in his demonstration. 

<p>`Your sister is given to government.' 

<p>`Given to government Joe?' I was startled, for I had some 
shadowy idea (and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had 
divorced her in favour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury. 

<p>`Given to government,' said Joe. `Which I meantersay the 
government of you and myself.' 

<p>`Oh!' 

<p>`And she an't over partial to having scholars on the premises,' 
Joe continued, `and in partickler would not be over partial to my 
being a scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don't 
you see?' 

<p>I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as 
`Why --' when Joe stopped me. 

<p>`Stay a bit. I know what you're a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! 
I don't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and 
again. I don't deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do 
drop down upon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on 
the Ram-page, Pip,' Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at 
the door, `candour compels fur to admit that she is a Buster.' 

<p>Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve 
capital Bs. 

<p>`Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it 
off, Pip?' 

<p>`Yes, Joe.' 

<p>`Well,' said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he 
might feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he 
took to that placid occupation; `your sister's a master-mind. A 
master-mind.' 

<p>`What's that?' I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. 
But, Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and 
completely stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with 
a fixed look, `Her.' 

<p>`And I an't a master-mind,' Joe resumed, when he had unfixed 
his look, and got back to his whisker. `And last of all, Pip -- and 
this I want to say very serous to you, old chap -- I see so much 
in my poor mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking 
her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days, that 
I'm dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what's 

<p>right by a woman, and I'd fur rather of the two go wrong the 

<p>t'other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was 

<p>only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't no Tickler for 
you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the 
up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll overlook 
shortcomings.' 

<p>Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe 
from that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; 
but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and think- 
ing about him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I 
was looking up to Joe in my heart. 

<p>`However,' said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; `here's the 
Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight 
of 'em, and she's not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook's 
mare mayn't have set-a fore-foot on a piece o' ice, and gone down.' 

<p>Mrs Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on 
market-days, to assist him in buying such household stuffs and 
goods as required a woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being 
a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant. 
This was market-day, and Mrs Joe was out on one of these 
expeditions. 

<p>Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the 
door to listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the 
wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would 
die to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I 
looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a 
man to turn his fuce up to them as he froze to death, and see no 
help or pity in all the glittering multitude. 

<p>`Here comes the mare,' said Joe, `ringing like a peal of bells!' 

<p>The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite 
musical, as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We 
got a chair out, ready for Mrs Joe's alighting, and stirred up the 
fire that they might see a bright window, and took a final survey of 
the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place. When we had 

<p>completed these preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. 

<p>Mrs Joe was soon landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down 

<p>too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in the 

<p>kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive 

<p>all the heat out of the fire. 

<p>`Now,' said Mrs Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excite- 

<p>ment, and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it 
hung by the strings: `if this boy an't grateful this night, he never 
will be!' 

<p>I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly 
uninformed why he ought to assume that expression. 

<p>`It's only to be hoped,' said my sister, `that he won't be Pomp- 
eyed. But I have my fears.' 

<p>`She an't in that line, Mum,' said Mr Pumblechook. `She knows 
better.' 

<p>She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eye- 
brows, `She?' Joe looked at me, making the motion with <I>his</I> lips 
and eyebrows, `She?' My sister catching him in the act, he drew 
the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory 
air on such occasions, and looked at her. 

<p>`Well?' said my sister, in her snappish way. `What are you 
staring at? Is the house a-fire?' 

<p>`-- Which some individual,' Joe politely hinted, `mentioned-- she.' 

<p>`And she is a she, I suppose?' said my sister. `Unless you call 
Miss Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you'll go so far as that.' 

<p>`Miss Havisham, up town?' said Joe. 

<p>`Is there any Miss Havisham down town?' returned my sister. 
`She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he's going. 
And he had better play there,' said my sister, shaking her head at 
me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, `or I'll 
work him.' 

<p>I had heard of Miss Havisham up town -- everybody for miles 
round, had heard of Miss Havisham up town -- as an immensely 
rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded 
against robbers, and who led a life of seclusion. 

<p>`Well to be sure!' said Joe, astounded. `I wonder how she come 
to know Pip!' 

<p>`Noodlel' cried my sister. `Who said she knew him?' 

<p>`-- Which some individual,' Joe again politely hinted, `mentioned 
that she wanted him to go and play there.' 

<p>`And couldn't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy 
to go and play there? Isn't it just barely possible that Uncle 
Pumblechook may be a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes -- 
we won't say quarterly or half-yearly, for that would be requiring 
too much of you -- but sometimes -- go there to pay his rent? And 
couldn't she then ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go 
and play there? And couldn't Uncle Pumblechook, being always 
considerate and thoughtful for us -- though you may not think it, 
Joseph,' in a tone of the deepest reproach, as if he were the most 
callous of nephews, `then mention this boy, standing Prancing 
here' -- which I solemnly declare I was not doing -- `that I have for 
ever been a willing slave to?' 

<p>`Good again!' cried Uncle Pumblechook. `Well putl Prettily 
pot-nted! Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.' 

<p>`No, Joseph,' said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while 
Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his 
nose, `you do not yet -- though you may not think it -- know the 
case. You may consider that you do, but you do <I>not,</I> Joseph. For 
you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for 
anything we can tell, this boy's fortune may be made by his going 
to Miss Havisham's, has offered to take him into town to-night in 
his own chaise-cart, and to keep him to-night, and to take him with 
his own hands to Miss Havisham's to-morrow morning. And 
Lor-a-mussy me!' cried my sister, casting off her bonnet in sudden 
desperation, `here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs, with Uncle 
Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching cold at the door, and 
the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the 
sole of his foot!' 

<p>With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and 
my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head 
was put under taps of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, 
and towelled, and thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I 
really was quite beside myself. (I may here remark that I suppose 
myself to be better acquainted than any living authority, with the 
ridgy effect of a wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the 
human countenance.) 

<p>When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen 
of the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and 
was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then 
delivered over to Mr Pumblechook, who formally received me as 
if he were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I 
knew he had been dying to make all along: `Boy, be for ever 
grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you 
up by hand!' 

<p>`Good-bye, Joe!' 

<p>`God bless you, Pip, old chap!' 

<p>I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings 
and what with soap-suds, I could at first see no stars from the 
chaise-cart. But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing 
any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss 
Havisham's, and what on earth I was expected to play at.
