<p>One bright, warm, November day&mdash;for such days are the usual order
in sunny California &mdash;Tabitha stood at the little window
in one end of the long corridor, looking disconsolately down into
the garden, shimmering in its rain-washed greenness, and thinking
of the approaching holidays and her own slender purse. The other
girls were making such elaborate gifts for each other, to say
nothing of the beautiful things laid by for the home folks and
friends, and she felt keenly the fact that she would have so little
to offer. To be sure, there were few to remember outside the school
circle of girls and teachers, but she longed as never before to
do as the others did and have what they had.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she sighed, "it's hard to be pinched <em>all</em>
the time! I wish I could have as much money to spend as even Mercedes
has, and that isn't a great deal, either. Here I have only five
dollars for Christmas, and there are about twenty girls, who,
I know, are going to give me something, besides the other people
I want to remember &mdash;Tom and the Vanes and Carrie's mother
and father. They are always giving me something beautiful, and
I never have anything for them but home-made candy. There is Aunt
Maria, too. I would like to send her a little something so she
won't think I have forgotten her; and then &mdash;Dad&mdash;but he
won't expect anything or care. I don't suppose he will even remember
that it is Christmas. Oh, hum! I wish there wasn't such a a day!"</p>

<p>"Such a day as what?" asked a soft, sweet voice behind her, and
an arm crept gently, almost shyly around her waist.</p>

<p>"Oh, Madame DuBois!" cried the startled girl, looking up into
the winning brown eyes of the little French teacher. "Did you
hear what I said? I was wishing there was no Christmas Day."</p>

<p>"No Christmas Day!" echoed the scandalized woman with charming
accent, "Ah, zat is ze Christ's birthday!"</p>

<p>"I was very wicked," murmured Tabitha, humbly. "I didn't stop
to think how we happen to have that holiday. I was mourning because
I have not as much to spend for pretty things as the other girls
have."</p>

<p>"Oh, but zat is very wrong!" protested her companion, shaking
her head in a disapproving fashion. "You Americans sink only of
how much money you spend for Christmas and if your gift to your
friend cost as much as ze one she give you. Zat isn't <em>gift</em>!
Zat is exchange. One should give only from ze happiness of ze
heart. If ze pocketbook is flat, zen pick a little flower, write
a little letter, give a merry smile. All true friends like zat
better zan silk dresses or gold watches. Do you forget one of
your great poets has said:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Not what we give but what we share,<br/>
&nbsp;For ze gift without ze giver is bare.'"

</p>
</div>
<p>"I see what you mean, Madame," said Tabitha slowly. "Folks think
too much about the cost of their gifts, instead of the spirit
in which they are given. But wouldn't you feel badly if you knew
that fifteen or twenty girls were planning splendid things for
you and there was only five dollars to buy remembrances for all
of them, besides the other friends? Cassandra told me yesterday
that Bertha Peck is embroidering a silk scarf for me, and here
I haven't a thing for her!"</p>

<p>Madame smiled indulgently at the tragic tones, and gently shook
the slender maid, as she answered, "Wie, I understand some how
you feel, Tabitha; but it isn't worth fretting about. A little
handkerchief, a card maybe&mdash;"</p>

<p>"One can't get a really nice handkerchief for even two bits,
and it would take my whole five dollars for just the girls alone.
I would have nothing left for Tom or the rest."</p>

<p>The little French woman was silent for a moment, and a deep frown
wrinkled her usually placid brow; then she impulsively caught
Tabitha's brown hands in her own and skipped joyfully as if she,
too, were a girl in her teens, exclaiming excitedly, "I have it&mdash;zat
what you say? You crochet. I have seen you sometimes when you
study and I wonder how you count ze stitches and learn, too, but
you always have your lessons well."</p>

<p>Tabitha's face flushed with pleasure at this unexpected praise,
and she laughingly replied, "Oh, I can't always. It is just when
I am memorizing something or learning French conjugations. Now
with algebra, I have to use my hands as well as my brains."</p>

<p>"Sly-boots! But you make pretty sings with your crochet hook&mdash;ze
lace on Carrie's collar, n'est pas?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I made that for her birthday. Mrs. Vane taught me how last
year in Silver Bow so I wouldn't be so lonely."</p>

<p>"It takes only a little time?"</p>

<p>"Not very long now. I have made so much of it I can almost do
it in my sleep, and I can pick up new patterns from magazines
by myself."</p>

<p>"Good! I, too, crochet&mdash;many sings once. I show you how if you
wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, Madame DuBois! I shall be glad to learn."</p>

<p>"It is six, seven weeks before Christmas Day, and in zat time
lots can be done. Come now to my room and we plan out zat five
dollars&mdash;if you like&mdash;spend it on paper." She hurried the amazed
girl down the long hall to her cozy room and was soon deeply absorbed
in making out lists and figuring the cost of material.</p>

<p>"There are twenty-one girls I should like in particular to remember,"
said Tabitha, curiously watching every movement of her companion.
"I wish I had something for each scholar. And five people in Silver
Bow, and Tom in Reno, and &mdash;I wish Miss Pomeroy didn't limit
us to such a little bit for the teachers."</p>

<p>"Ah, but she is wise!" laughed Madame, rapidly turning the pages
in a fancy-work book. "See, here is what I mean. Twenty ties like
zat take so little time and are so pretty and very acceptable.
Every girl this day likes such sings. One spool of cotton thread,
very fine, makes four or five, maybe more; a little scrap of linen
to mount it on, and voila! a beautiful little gift that cost much
at the store. Watch me now, how I do it." She caught up her crochet
hook and thread, and deftly, swiftly, traced the delicate little
pattern that Tabitha might see how it was done.</p>

<p>"That looks so easy," murmured the girl, watching the flying
fingers with fascinated eyes. "I believe I could do it already."</p>

<p>"Yes? But you take the book to be sure. The directions are easy.
That settles the girls except maybe the little friend, Carrie.
How would she like some slippers? I make them very pretty and
they cost so little; two or three skeins of yarn for one pair
and the soles are cheap, too."</p>

<p>"That would be fine for Carrie&mdash;and for Chrystobel. Cassandra
says she has something beautiful for me, but Chrystie threatened
to give her nothing for Christmas if she told; so she has managed
to keep it secret so far."</p>

<p>"Cassandra has a lively tongue," laughed Madame, "and she finds
it hard to control. Now for the rest of your friends, how would
calendars do? You make beautiful water-coloring. Miss White shows
me her pretty work, and always zere is one of your drawings. Cardboard
is easy to get; a little bunch of flowers or some ozer design
in colors, maybe a picture of yourself, and zat makes a nice gift."</p>

<p>"I had thought of pictures at first, but good ones cost so much
that I couldn't get enough to go around."</p>

<p>"Pictures? Photographs, you mean. But maybe some friend has a
camera and will take a&mdash;what you call it?&mdash;snap-shot? I know such
a boy. He does excellent work and I am sure Miss Pomeroy will
let you go there some day with me. He charges very low. I sink
one dollar would be all. Zen see! You have still one dollar and
a half left out of your five dollars to buy ribbon, tissue paper,
Christmas cards, postals or what you will, and all your friends
are planned for."</p>

<p>Tabitha stared at the neat list with unbelieving eyes, then with
a little jump of delight, she threw both arms around Madame's
neck, crying happily, "Oh, you darling, you witch! I have been
wondering and puzzling for a week to know how I could possibly
get thirty-three presents out of five dollars, but it looks as
easy as <em>a, b, c</em>, now. Thank you a thousand times! I am
going to begin right away on my gifts, so everything will surely
be finished in time."</p>

<p>"But you must attend to the lessons first," warned the teacher,
shaking her finger playfully at the excited girl.</p>

<p>"Oh, I will, I surely will," she promised, gathering up book
and papers. "I am so glad this is Saturday, for I can commence
work at once. All my Monday's lessons are learned, Chrystobel
and Cassandra have gone home for Sunday, and there is nothing
to interfere."</p>

<p>"Then mind you don't work too hard, or I shall be sorry I helped
you stretch your little gold mine."</p>

<p>"I will be very careful, but I <em>must</em> hurry, for there
are only seven weeks before Christmas."</p>

<p>With a parting smile she slipped out of the door and rushed away
to her own room, eager to make with her own hands the pretty lace
Madame had begun for her; and from that moment all her leisure
time was devoted to crocheting ties or painting calendars for
her loved ones' Christmas Day. With the first gleam of dawn she
was up in the morning, busy with brush or hook long before the
breakfast bell called them to the day's routine; at recess and
during the noon hour, she was hidden away with Bertha or Carrie
in some nook of the great gardens, making frantic use of every
opportunity; and when the lessons were learned in the evening,
back to back with Chrystobel, she toiled with patient fingers,
sighing with relief as each dainty tie was laid in state beside
its finished mates in her big hat box.</p>

<p>Madame's young friend was glad to take some kodak pictures of
the eager girl, the prints were splendidly clear-cut, and Tabitha
was delighted with the result. So when her busy brush had painted
all the cardboard squares in soft colors, and the carefully trimmed
snapshots were mounted, Tabitha's calendars were really works
of art; and her heart was filled with happiness over what she
had achieved.</p>

<p>Just a week before Christmas she slipped the last gift into the
hat box and sat down before it to gloat over her treasures with
loving eyes.</p>

<p>"All done&mdash;everything! I didn't suppose I could do it when I
began. Now, I shan't be ashamed to receive gifts from the girls.
It isn't right to feel that way, I know, but really I hated to
think of not being able to give them something nice when they
are so good to me. It isn't that I am exchanging, as Madame calls
it; for I shall appreciate whatever gifts I get&mdash;silk dresses,
Christmas cards, or just a friendly word; but this is the very
first time I ever made things myself to give away at such a time,
and I guess it has gone to my head. I like to receive presents,
but <em>I</em> think it is lots more fun to give them. I have
enjoyed making every single one of those.</p>

<p>"There are twenty-two ties, nineteen for the girls, and one each
for Mrs. Vane, Carrie's mother and Aunt Maria; there's a silk
tie for Rosslyn McKittrick &mdash;I never would have thought of
using up that bias piece for such a thing if I hadn't seen Jessie
making her little brother one. I don't know which I like best,
Carrie's blue slippers or Chrystobel's pink ones&mdash;they are both
so dear. But my calendars are my darlings! When Madame suggested
them, I was afraid they would be awfully cheap-looking, but Miss
White says the coloring is the best I ever did, and those splendid
pictures just finish them. I had no idea I was so good-looking.
There is one apiece for each teacher, one for Tom, one for Dr.
Vane, and one for Mr. Carson. That leaves me three over; and there
may be someone I have forgotten in my list, so these will probably
come in handy yet. And that prying Cassandra hasn't found out
about a thing that I have made!</p>

<p>"Now I must get my hat and coat if I go with Madame for the tissue
paper. How glad I am that I can get a pretty postcard for each
of the other girls! Even then, I will have more than half a dollar
left. Perhaps I can find a piece of linen and make Tom a handkerchief
or two. I'll ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Puss, Puss!" called an excited voice in the corridor, and an
impatient fist pounded loudly on the door. Tabitha started nervously,
dropped the cover down over her treasures and pushed the box hurriedly
into the closet, calling cheerily, "Come in, Carrie!"</p>

<p>"I can't; you have locked the door!"</p>

<p>The black-eyed girl flew to turn the key, and rosy, excited Carrie
burst into the room, crying, "See what I got for papa! It just
came from the store. Miss Pomeroy helped me choose it. I wanted
to show it to you first. Isn't it splendid? And won't he like
it?" She laid a beautifully carved box on the table and danced
gleefully about the room while Tabitha examined the purchase.</p>

<p>"Well, I should think he would," she said enthusiastically in
answer to Carrie's question. "What is it for?"</p>

<p>"It's a sort of a writing-desk for him to carry around in his
grip when he goes away, so he can write any time he wants to.
See the paper, business size, letter and note paper. Here is a
box for stamps, and there is a place for pen and pencils. I wanted
to get him a fountain pen, too, but mamma said she would attend
to that, to be sure it was a nice one. I can just see him now
when he opens it. Oh, I wish Christmas would hurry! What are you
going to give your father, Puss?"</p>

<p>Tabitha's face flushed scarlet, and she murmured in embarrassment,
"I don't believe he cares anything about Christmas. He never has
observed it since I can remember."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Carrie. "Well, I must take my box back and wrap it
up. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"It is nearly time for our walk and Miss Pomeroy has promised
some of us a tramp to town for tissue paper, ribbon, cards and
such little things that won't take long to get. Didn't you know?
Ask her if you can't go. I think there are only six or seven of
us so far. One more will only make it the jollier."</p>

<p>"I would like to," answered Carrie wistfully, "but this is my
hour to practice for the cantata. Bye-bye!"</p>

<p>Carrie whisked across the hall to her room and Tabitha, haunted
by that careless question, descended the stairs to wait for the
group of shoppers to gather.</p>

<p>The day was bright and warm, the winter rains had washed the
dusty foliage clean, and it seemed as if spring had already begun
in this California city; but there was no answering note of joy
in Tabitha's heart. Why had Carrie shown her the pretty writing-desk?
What had prompted her to speak such disquieting words? Ought she
to send something to the stern father who did not care?</p>

<p>"One should give only from ze happiness of ze heart, Madeline."</p>

<p>Madame's gentle voice floated back to Tabitha, speaking the same
sentiment she had voiced to the black-haired girl a few weeks
before. "A gift from a sense of duty is no gift at all."</p>

<p>"Then," thought Tabitha, "that settles my difficulty. I could
give only from a sense of duty. I should like to love him, but
he won't let me."</p>

<p>"But sink how lonely he may be, ze cross old uncle you talk about!
Doesn't it make you sorry?" came another snatch of conversation.
"Perhaps he loves you more zan you sink. Oh, yes, I should get
him somesing&mdash;a calendar or a card or maybe write a letter; but
don't do it because you sink you ought. If he feels zat you really
want to cheer him, it will make him happy even if he is cross."</p>

<p>The sunshine grew suddenly brighter to Tabitha, her heart grew
wonderfully lighter, her lips unconsciously hummed a little tune
and the walk the rest of the way to town was beautiful. But the
first thing she did when Ivy Hall was reached, was to run up to
her room, select the prettiest of the three left-over calendars,
wrap it daintily in tissue paper and gold cord and address it
to her father at Silver Bow. Then with a happy sigh she dropped
it back into the box to await the proper time for mailing, and
skipped off to tell Madame that her Christmas work was all done.</p>
