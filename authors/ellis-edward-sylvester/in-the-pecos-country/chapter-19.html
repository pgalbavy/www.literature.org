<p>Young Munson made a sudden bound outward, and, just as he did
so, a mass of rock weighing fully a dozen tons, fell upon the
precise spot where he had stood, missing him so narrowly that
the blast of wind, or rather concussion of the air, was plainly
felt. The boulder broke into several pieces, its momentum being
so terrific that the ground for several feet around was jarred
as if by an earthquake.</p>

<p>The lad was overcome for a moment or two, for he realized how
narrow his escape was from a terrible and instantaneous death.</p>

<p>"That was a little closer than I ever want to come again," he
exclaimed. "It seems to me that a person is always likely to get
killed, no matter where he is or what he is doing. I don't suppose
that anybody threw that down at me," he continued, in a half-doubting
voice, as he stepped a few paces back and again peered into the
gloom.</p>

<p>If it had been during the day-time, he might have suspected that
some scamp had managed to pry the mass loose, and to send it crashing
downward straight for his head. But as the case stood, such a
thing could not have taken place.</p>

<p>Fred continued his flight until nearly midnight, by which time
his fatigue became so great that he began to hunt a place in which
to spend the remainder of the night. He had not yet seen any wild
animals, and was hopeful that he would suffer no disturbance from
them. The single charge of his rifle was to precious to be thrown
away upon any such game as that.</p>

<p>The lad was in the very act of leaving the ravine, when his step
was arrested by a sound too distinct to be mistaken. It was not
imagination this time, and he paused to identify it. The sound
was faint and of the nature of a jarring or murmur. He suspected
that it was caused by horses' hoofs, and he listened but a few
minutes when he became certain that such was the fact.</p>

<p>"There must be a big lot of them," he thought, as he listened
to the sound growing plainer and plainer every minute. "I wonder
if Lone Wolf and his men have not done what they started to do
and are going round home again?"</p>

<p>Judging from the clamping hoofs, such might have been the case.
At all events, there was every reason for believing that a party
of horsemen were in the ravine and that they were headed in his
direction.</p>

<p>Fred made up his mind to wait where he was until they passed
by. He had no fear of being seen, when the opportunity for hiding
was all that could be desired, and, lying flat upon his face,
he awaited the result.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the tramp, tramp, the noise of hoofs mingling
in a dull thud that sounded oddly in the stillness of the night
to the watching and listening lad.</p>

<p>"Here they come," he muttered, before he saw them; but the words
were hardly out of his mouth when a shadowy figure came into view,
instantly followed by a score of others, all mingling and blending
in one indistinguishable mass.</p>

<p>The forms of animals and riders were plainly discernible, but
they came in too promiscuous fashion to be counted, and they were
gone almost as soon as they were seen. Fred was confident that
thirty warriors galloped by him in the stillness of the night.</p>

<p>"I believe it was Lone Wolf and some of his men," he muttered,
as he clambered down from his place among the rocks. Having been
thoroughly awakened by what he had seen, he determined to walk
an hour or more longer, for he felt that the best time for him
to journey was during the protecting darkness of night.</p>

<p>"There ain't anybody to make me get up early," he reasoned, "and
when I go to sleep I can stick to it as long as I want to. It
seems to me that if I walk all I can tonight, and keep at it the
most of tomorrow, I ought to be somewhere near the place where
we came in among these mountains. Then a day or two's tramping
over the back trail will take me pretty nearly to New Boston&mdash;that
is, if nobody gobbles me up. I've got a rough road before me,
but God has guided me thus far, and I'll trust him clean through.
I've had some wonderful escapes to tell about&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was too wide awake and too much on the alert to forget precisely
where he was, or to fail to take in whatever should occur of an
alarming nature. That which now startled him and suddenly cut
short his musings was the sound of a horse's hoofs, close behind
him.</p>

<p>Fred had been duped by his own fears and imaginings so many times
that he could not be served so again, and, as he was not apprehending
anything of the kind at that moment, there was no possibility
of escape from the reality of the sound. He halted and turned
his head like lightning, grasping his rifle in his nervous, determined
way as he peered back into the gloom, whispering to himself:</p>

<p>"That must be Lone Wolf or some of the warriors coming back to
look for me."</p>

<p>This was rather vague theorizing, however. Look and stare as
much as he chose, he could detect nothing that resembled man or
animal. He shrank to one side and waited several minutes, in the
hope that the thing would explain itself. But it did not, and,
after waiting some time, he resumed his journey along the ravine,
keeping close to the shadow on the right side, and using eyes
and ears to guard against the insidious approach of any kind of
foe.</p>

<p>Sometimes, under such circumstances, when a sound has very nearly
or quite died out In the stillness, there seems to come a peculiar
eddy or turn of wind, or that which causes the sound, passes for
an instant at a point which is so situated as to impel the waves
of air directly to the ear of the listener. Fred did not exactly
understand how this thing could happen, but he had known of something
of the kind, and he was gradually bringing himself to explain
the thing in that fashion, when his theory was upset by such a
sudden, violent rattling of hoofs, so close behind him, that he
leaped to one side, fearful of being trampled upon.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty way to come upon a fellow!" he gasped, whirling
about with the purpose of shooting the red-skin for his startling
introduction.</p>

<p>But neither rider nor horseman was visible.</p>

<p>The watcher could scarcely believe the evidence of his own senses.
It seemed to him that the Apache, as he believed him to be, must
have turned abruptly aside, into some opening in the side of the
ravine, but he could not remember having seen any place that would
admit of such strategy. When he came to reflect upon it, it seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>"Well, that beats everything," he said, with a perplexed sigh.
"That sounded so close that I expected to be run over before I
could get out of the way, and now he's gone."</p>

<p>He waited some minutes, and, hearing and seeing nothing, once
more resumed his stealthy way along the gorge, a new, shivering
fear gradually creeping over him, as it does over anyone who suspects
himself in the presence of the unexplainable and unnatural.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether they have ghosts in this part of the world?"
he said to himself. "I used to hear the men talk of such things,
but father said there was nothing in them, and so I didn't believe
them&mdash;but I don't know what father would say or think if he was
in my place."</p>

<p>There was the strong counter-belief, also&mdash;the conviction that
most likely there was a reality about the thing&mdash;which kept Fred
on the <em>qui vive</em>. He was determined, if possible, to prevent
a repetition of the startling surprise of a few minutes before.
He scrutinized the side of the ravine as he walked along, on the
lookout for any opening or crevice which would permit a man and
a horse to find shelter. It did not seem possible that any retreat
that would shelter them could escape the eyes of the lad.</p>

<p>"I haven't seen any such place yet, so, if the Indian is trying
any such trick, he can't do it here without my seeing him, and
if I do &mdash;Heaven save me!"</p>

<p>He sprang to one side, again pressing himself back against the
rock, as though trying to flatten his body there in order to escape
the trampling hoofs. At the same time he cocked his rifle, with
the purpose of giving the finishing touch to the Apache who had
alarmed him once too often in this fashion.</p>
