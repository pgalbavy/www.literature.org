<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In that hour I had none of the exhilaration of success. So strangely
are we mortals made that, though I had won safety for myself and
my people, I could not get the savour of it. I had passed too
far beyond the limits of my strength. Now that the tension of
peril was gone, my legs were like touchwood, which a stroke would
shatter, and my foolish head swam like a merry-go-round. Shalah's
arm was round me, and he lifted me up the steep bits till we came
to the crown of the ridge. There we halted, and he fed me with
sops of bread dipped in eau-de-vie, for he had brought Ringan's
flask with him. The only result was to make me deadly sick. I
saw his eyes look gravely at me, and the next I knew I was on
his back. I begged him to set me down and leave me, and I think
I must have wept like a bairn. All pride of manhood had flown
in that sharp revulsion, and I had the mind of a lost child.</p>

<p>As the light grew some strength came back to me, and presently
I was able to hobble a little on my rickety shanks. We kept the
very crest of the range, and came by and by to a promontory of
clear ground, the same, I fancy, from which I had first seen the
vale of the Shenandoah. There we rested in a nook of rock, while
the early sun warmed us, and the little vapours showed, us in
glimpses the green depths and the far-shining meadows.</p>

<p>Shalah nudged my shoulder, and pointed to the south, where a
glen debouched from the hills. A stream of mounted figures was
pouring out of it, heading for the upper waters of the river where
the valley broadened again. For all my sickness my eyes were sharp
enough to perceive what manner of procession it was. All were
on horseback, riding in clouds and companies without the discipline
of a march, but moving as swift as a flight of wildfowl at twilight.
Before the others rode a little cluster of pathfinders, and among
them I thought I could recognize one taller than the rest.</p>

<p>"Your magic hath prevailed, brother," Shalah said. "In an hour's
time they will have crossed the Shenandoah, and at nightfall they
will camp on the farther mountains."</p>

<p>That sight gave me my first assurance of success. At any rate,
I had fulfilled my trust, and if I died in the hills Virginia
would yet bless her deliverer.</p>

<p>And yet my strongest feeling was a wild regret. These folk were
making for the untravelled lands of the sunset. You would have
said I had got my bellyful of adventure, and should now have sought
only a quiet life. But in that moment of bodily weakness and mental
confusion I was shaken with a longing to follow them, to find
what lay beyond the farthest cloud-topped mountain, to cross the
wide rivers, and haply to come to the infinite and mystic Ocean
of the West.</p>

<p>"Would to God I were with them!" I sighed.</p>

<p>"Will you come, brother?" Shalah whispered, a strange light in
his eyes. "If we twain joined the venture, I think we should not
be the last in it. Shalah would make you a king. What is your
life in the muddy Tidewater but a thing of little rivalries and
petty wrangles and moping over paper? The hearth will soon grow
cold, and the bright eyes of the fairest woman will dull with
age, and the years will find you heavy and slow, with a coward's
shrinking from death. What say you, brother? While the blood is
strong in the veins shall we ride westward on the path of a king?"</p>

<p>His eyes were staring like a hawk's over the hills, and, light-headed
as I was, I caught the infection of his ardour. For, remember,
I was so low in spirit that all my hopes and memories were forgotten,
and I was in that blank apathy which is mastered by another's
passion. For a little the life of Virginia seemed unspeakably
barren, and I quickened at the wild vista which Shalah offered.
I might be a king over a proud people, carving a fair kingdom
out of the wilderness, and ruling it justly in the fear of God.
These western Indians were the stuff of a great nation. I, Andrew
Garvald, might yet find that empire of which the old adventurers
dreamed.</p>

<p>With shame I set down my boyish folly. It did not last, long,
for to my dizzy brain there came the air which Elspeth had sung,
that song of Montrose's which had been, as it were, the star of
all my wanderings.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"For, if Confusion have a part,<br/>
&nbsp;Which virtuous souls abhor&mdash;"

</p>
</div>
<p>Surely it was confusion that had now overtaken me. Elspeth's
clear voice, her dark, kind eyes, her young and joyous grace,
filled again my memory. Was not such a lady better than any savage
kingdom? Was not the service of my own folk nobler than any principate
among strangers? Could the rivers of Damascus vie with the waters
of Israel?</p>

<p>"Nay, Shalah," I said. "Mine is a quieter destiny. I go back
to the Tidewater, but I shall not stay there. We have found the
road to the hills, and in time I will plant the flag of my race
on the Shenandoah."</p>

<p>He bowed his head. "So be it. Each man to his own path, but I
would ours had run together. Your way is the way of the white
man. You conquer slowly, but the line of your conquest goes not
back. Slowly it eats its way through the forest, and fields and
manors appear in the waste places, and cattle graze in the coverts
of the deer. Listen, brother. Shalah has had his visions when
his eyes were unsealed in the night watches. He has seen the white
man pressing up from the sea, and spreading over the lands of
his fathers. He has seen the glens of the hills parcelled out
like the meadows of Henricus, and a great multitude surging ever
on to the West. His race is doomed by God to perish before the
stranger; but not yet awhile, for the white man comes slowly.
It hath been told that the Children of the West Wind must seek
their cradle, and while there is time he would join them in that
quest. The white men follow upon their heels, but in his day and
in that of his son's sons they will lead their life according
to the ancient ways. He hath seen the wisdom of the stranger,
and found among them men after his own heart; but the Spirit of
his fathers calls, and now he returns to his own people."</p>

<p>"What will you do there?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I know not. I am still a prince among them, and will sway their
councils. It may be fated that I slay yonder magician and reign
in his stead."</p>

<p>He got to his feet and looked proudly westward.</p>

<p>"In a little I shall overtake them. But I would my brother had
been of my company."</p>

<p>Slowly we travelled north along the crests, for though my mind
was now saner, I had no strength in my body. The hill mists came
down on us, and the rain drove up from the glens. I was happy
now for all my weakness, for I was lapped in a great peace. The
raw weather, which had once been a horror of darkness to me, was
now something kindly and homelike. The wet smells minded me of
my own land, and the cool buffets of the squalls were a tonic
to my spirit. I wandered into pleasant dreams, and scarce felt
the roughness of the ground on my bare feet and the aches in every
limb.</p>

<p>Long ere we got to the Gap I was clean worn out. I remember that
I fell constantly, and could scarcely rise. Then I stumbled, and
the last power went out of will and sinew. I had a glimpse of
Shalah's grave face as I slipped into unconsciousness.</p>

<p>I woke in a glow of firelight. Faces surrounded me, dim wraith-like
figures still entangled in the meshes of my dreams. Slowly the
scene cleared, and I recognized Grey's features, drawn and constrained,
and yet welcoming. Bertrand was weeping after his excitable fashion.</p>

<p>But there was a face nearer to me, and with that face in my memory
I went off into pleasant dreams. Somewhere in them mingled the
words of the old spaewife, that I should miss love and fortune
in the sunshine and find them in the rain.</p>

<p>The strength of youth is like a branch of yew, for if it is bent
it soon straightens. By the third day I was on my feet again,
with only the stiffness of healing wounds to remind me of those
desperate passages. When I could look about me I found that men
had arrived from the Rappahannock, and among them Elspeth's uncle,
who had girded on a great claymore, and looked, for all his worn
face and sober habit, a mighty man of war. With them came news
of the rout of the Cherokees, who had been beaten by Nicholson's
militia in Stafford county and driven down the long line of the
Border, paying toll to every stockade. Midway Lawrence had fallen
upon them and driven the remnants into the hills above the head
waters of the James. It would be many a day, I thought, before
these gentry would bring war again to the Tidewater. The Rappahannock
men were in high feather, convinced that they had borne the brunt
of the invasion. 'Twas no business of mine to enlighten them,
the more since of the three who knew the full peril, Shalah was
gone and Ringan was dead. My tale should be for the ear of Lawrence
and the Governor, and for none else. The peace of mind of Virginia
should not be broken by me.</p>

<p>Grey came to me on the third morning to say good-bye. He was
going back to the Tidewater with some of the Borderers, for to
stay longer with us had become a torture to him. There was no
ill feeling in his proud soul, and he bore defeat as a gentleman
should.</p>

<p>"You have fairly won, Mr. Garvald," he said. "Three nights ago
I saw clearly revealed the inclination of the lady, and I am not
one to strive with an unwilling maid. I wish you joy of a great
prize. You staked high for it, and you deserve your fortune. As
for me, you have taught me much for which I owe you gratitude.
Presently, when my heart is less sore, I desire that we should
meet in friendship, but till then I need a little solitude to
mend broken threads."</p>

<p>There was the true gentleman for you, and I sorrowed that I should
ever have misjudged him. He shook my hand in all brotherliness,
and went down the glen with Bertrand, who longed to see his children
again.</p>

<p>Elspeth remained, and concerning her I fell into my old doubting
mood. The return of my strength had revived in me the passion
which had dwelt somewhere in my soul from, the hour she first
sang to me in the rain. She had greeted me as girl greets her
lover, but was that any more than the revulsion from fear and
the pity of a tender heart? Doubts oppressed me, the more as she
seemed constrained and uneasy, her eyes falling when she met mine,
and her voice full no longer of its frank comradeship.</p>

<p>One afternoon we went to a place in the hills where the vale
of the Shenandoah could be seen. The rain had gone, and had left
behind it a taste of autumn. The hill berries were ripening, and
a touch of flame had fallen on the thickets.</p>

<p>Soon the great valley lay below us, running out in a golden haze
to the far blue mountains.</p>

<p>"Ah!" she sighed, like one who comes from a winter night into
a firelit room. She was silent, while her eyes drank in its spacious
comfort.</p>

<p>"That is your heritage, Elspeth. That is the birthday gift to
which old Studd's powder-flask is the key."</p>

<p>"Nay, yours," she said, "for you won it."</p>

<p>The words died on her lips, for her eyes were abstracted. My
legs were still feeble, and I had leaned a little on her strong
young arm as we came up the hill, but now she left me and climbed
on a rock, where she sat like a pixie. The hardships of the past
had thinned her face and deepened her eyes, but her grace was
the more manifest. Fresh and dewy as morning, yet with a soul
of steel and fire&mdash;surely no lovelier nymph ever graced a woodland.
I felt how rough and common was my own clay in contrast with her
bright spirit.</p>

<p>"Elspeth," I said hoarsely, "once I told you what was in my heart."</p>

<p>Her face grew grave. "And have you not seen what is in mine?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I have seen and rejoiced, and yet I doubt."</p>

<p>"But why?" she asked again. "My life is yours, for you have preserved
it. I would be graceless indeed if I did not give my best to you
who have given all for me."</p>

<p>"It is not gratitude I want. If you are only grateful, put me
out of your thoughts, and I will go away and strive to forget
you. There were twenty in the Tidewater who would have done the
like."</p>

<p>She looked down on me from the rock with the old quizzing humour
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"If gratitude irks you, sir, what would you have?"</p>

<p>"All," I cried; "and yet, Heaven knows, I am not worth it. I
am no man to capture a fair girl's heart. My face is rude and
my speech harsh, and I am damnably prosaic. I have not Ringan's
fancy, or Grey's gallantry; I am sober and tongue-tied and uncouth,
and my mind runs terribly on facts and figures. O Elspeth, I know
I am no hero of romance, but a plain body whom Fate has forced
into a month of wildness. I shall go back to Virginia, and be
set once more at my accompts and ladings. Think well, my dear,
for I will have nothing less than all. Can you endure to spend
your days with a homely fellow like me?"</p>

<p>"What does a woman desire?" she asked, as if from herself, and
her voice was very soft as she gazed over the valley. "Men think
it is a handsome face or a brisk air or a smooth tongue. And some
will have it that it is a deep purse or a high station. But I
think it is the honest heart that goes all the way with a woman's
love. We are not so blind as to believe that the glitter is the
gold. We love romance, but we seek it in its true home. Do you
think I would marry you for gratitude, Andrew?"</p>

<p>"No," I said.</p>

<p>"Or for admiration?"</p>

<p>"No," said I.</p>

<p>"Or for love?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I said, with a sudden joy.</p>

<p>She slipped from the rock, her eyes soft and misty. Her arms
were about my neck, and I heard from her the words I had dreamed
of and yet scarce hoped for, the words of the song sung long ago
to a boy's ear, and spoken now with the pure fervour of the heart&mdash;"My
dear and only love."</p>

<p>Years have flown since that day on the hills, and much has befallen;
but the prologue is the kernel of my play, and the curtain which
rose after that hour revealed things less worthy of chronicle.
Why should I tell of how my trade prospered mightily, and of the
great house we built at Middle Plantation; of my quarrels with
Nicholson, which were many; of how we carved a fair estate out
of Elspeth's inheritance, and led the tide of settlement to the
edge of the hills? These things would seem a pedestrian end to
a high beginning. Nor would I weary the reader with my doings
in the Assembly, how I bearded more Governors than one, and disputed
stoutly with His Majesty's Privy Council in London. The historian
of Virginia&mdash;now by God's grace a notable land&mdash;may, perhaps,
take note of these things, but it is well for me to keep silent.
It is of youth alone that I am concerned to write, for it is a
comfort to my soul to know that once in my decorous progress through
life I could kick my heels and forget to count the cost; and as
youth cries farewell, so I end my story and turn to my accounts.</p>

<p>Elspeth and I have twice voyaged to Scotland. The first time
my uncle and mother were still in the land of the living, but
they died in the same year, and on our second journey I had much
ado in settling their estates. My riches being now considerable,
I turned my attention to the little house of Auchencairn, which
I enlarged and beautified, so that if we have the wish we may
take up our dwelling there. We have found in the West a goodly
heritage, but there is that in a man's birth place which keeps
tight fingers on his soul, and I think that we desire to draw
our last breath and lay our bones in our own grey country-side.
So, if God grants us length of days, we may haply return to Douglasdale
in the even, and instead of our noble forests and rich meadows,
look upon the bleak mosses and the rainy uplands which were our
childhood's memory.</p>

<p>That is the fancy at the back of both our heads. But I am very
sure that our sons will be Virginians.</p>

<p><em>THE END</em>.</p>
