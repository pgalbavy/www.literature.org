<p>The first words of the commissary of police, on entering the
managers' office, were to ask after the missing prima donna.</p>

<p>"Is Christine Daae here?"</p>

<p>"Christine Daae here?" echoed Richard.  "No. Why?"</p>

<p>As for Moncharmin, he had not the strength left to utter a word.</p>

<p>Richard repeated, for the commissary and the compact crowd which
had followed him into the office observed an impressive silence.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask if Christine Daae is here, M. LE <em>COMMISSAIRE</em>?"</p>

<p>"Because she has to be found," declared the commissary of police
solemnly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, she has to be found?  Has she disappeared?"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the performance!"</p>

<p>"In the middle of the performance?  This is extraordinary!"</p>

<p>"Isn't it?  And what is quite as extraordinary is that you should
first learn it from me!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Richard, taking his head in his hands and muttering. 
"What is this new business?  Oh, it's enough to make a man send
in his resignation!"</p>

<p>And he pulled a few hairs out of his mustache without even knowing
what he was doing.</p>

<p>"So she ... so she disappeared in the middle of the performance?"
he repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, she was carried off in the Prison Act, at the moment when
she was invoking the aid of the angels; but I doubt if she was
carried off by an angel."</p>

<p>"And I am sure that she was!"</p>

<p>Everybody looked round.  A young man, pale and trembling with
excitement, repeated:</p>

<p>"I am sure of it!"</p>

<p>"Sure of what?" asked Mifroid.</p>

<p>"That Christine Daae was carried off by an angel, M. LE <em>COMMISSAIRE
</em>and I can tell you his name."</p>

<p>"Aha, M. le Vicomte de Chagny!  So you maintain that Christine
Daae was carried off by an angel:  an angel of the Opera, no doubt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, by an angel of the Opera; and I will tell you
where he lives ... when we are alone."</p>

<p>"You are right, monsieur."</p>

<p>And the commissary of police, inviting Raoul to take a chair,
cleared the room of all the rest, excepting the managers.</p>

<p>Then Raoul spoke:</p>

<p>"M. le Commissaire, the angel is called Erik, he lives in the
Opera and he is the Angel of Music!"</p>

<p>"The Angel of Music!  Really!  That is very curious! ... The
Angel of Music!"  And, turning to the managers, M. Mifroid asked,
"Have you an Angel of Music on the premises, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>Richard and Moncharmin shook their heads, without even speaking.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the viscount, "those gentlemen have heard of the Opera
ghost.  Well, I am in a position to state that the Opera ghost
and the Angel of Music are one and the same person; and his real
name is Erik."</p>

<p>M. Mifroid rose and looked at Raoul attentively.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur but is it your intention to make
fun of the law?  And, if not, what is all this about the Opera
ghost?"</p>

<p>"I say that these gentlemen have heard of him."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, it appears that you know the Opera ghost?"</p>

<p>Richard rose, with the remaining hairs of his mustache in his
hand.</p>

<p>"No, M. Commissary, no, we do not know him, but we wish that
we did, for this very evening he has robbed us of twenty-thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>And Richard turned a terrible look on Moncharmin, which seemed
to say:</p>

<p>"Give me back the twenty-thousand francs, or I'll tell the whole
story."</p>

<p>Moncharmin understood what he meant, for, with a distracted gesture,
he said:</p>

<p>"Oh, tell everything and have done with it!"</p>

<p>As for Mifroid, he looked at the managers and at Raoul by turns
and wondered whether he had strayed into a lunatic asylum.  He
passed his hand through his hair.</p>

<p>"A ghost," he said, "who, on the same evening, carries off an
opera-singer and steals twenty-thousand francs is a ghost who
must have his hands very full!  If you don't mind, we will take
the questions in order.  The singer first, the twenty-thousand
francs after.  Come, M. de Chagny, let us try to talk seriously. 
You believe that Mlle. Christine Daae has been carried off by
an individual called Erik.  Do you know this person?  Have you
seen him?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In a church yard."</p>

<p>M. Mifroid gave a start, began to scrutinize Raoul again and
said:</p>

<p>"Of course! ... That's where ghosts usually hang out! ... And
what were you doing in that churchyard?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur," said Raoul, "I can quite understand how absurd my
replies must seem to you.  But I beg you to believe that I am
in full possession of my faculties.  The safety of the person
dearest to me in the world is at stake.  I should like to convince
you in a few words, for time is pressing and every minute is valuable. 
Unfortunately, if I do not tell you the strangest story that ever
was from the beginning, you will not believe me.  I will tell
you all I know about the Opera ghost, M. Commissary.  Alas, I
do not know much! ..."</p>

<p>"Never mind, go on, go on!" exclaimed Richard and Moncharmin,
suddenly greatly interested.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for their hopes of learning some detail that could
put them on the track of their hoaxer, they were soon compelled
to accept the fact that M. Raoul de Chagny had completely lost
his head.  All that story about Perros-Guirec, death's heads and
enchanted violins, could only have taken birth in the disordered
brain of a youth mad with love.  It was evident, also, that Mr.
Commissary Mifroid shared their view; and the magistrate would
certainly have cut short the incoherent narrative if circumstances
had not taken it upon themselves to interrupt it.</p>

<p>The door opened and a man entered, curiously dressed in an enormous
frock-coat and a tall hat, at once shabby and shiny, that came
down to his ears.  He went up to the commissary and spoke to him
in a whisper. It was doubtless a detective come to deliver an
important communication.</p>

<p>During this conversation, M. Mifroid did not take his eyes off
Raoul. At last, addressing him, he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, we have talked enough about the ghost.  We will now
talk about yourself a little, if you have no objection: you were
to carry off Mlle. Christine Daae to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>

<p>"After the performance?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>

<p>"All your arrangements were made?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>

<p>"The carriage that brought you was to take you both away... 
There were fresh horses in readiness at every stage ..."</p>

<p>"That is true, M. le Commissaire."</p>

<p>"And nevertheless your carriage is still outside the Rotunda
awaiting your orders, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, M. le Commissaire."</p>

<p>"Did you know that there were three other carriages there, in
addition to yours?"</p>

<p>"I did not pay the least attention."</p>

<p>"They were the carriages of Mlle. Sorelli, which could not find
room in the Cour de l'Administration; of Carlotta; and of your
brother, M. le Comte de Chagny..."</p>

<p>"Very likely..."</p>

<p>"What is certain is that, though your carriage and Sorelli's
and Carlotta's are still there, by the Rotunda pavement, M. le
Comte de Chagny's carriage is gone."</p>

<p>"This has nothing to say to ..."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon.  Was not M. le Comte opposed to your marriage
with Mlle. Daae?"</p>

<p>"That is a matter that only concerns the family."</p>

<p>"You have answered my question:  he was opposed to it ... and
that was why you were carrying Christine Daae out of your brother's
reach... Well, M. de Chagny, allow me to inform you that your
brother has been smarter than you!  It is he who has carried off
Christine Daae!"</p>

<p>"Oh, impossible!" moaned Raoul, pressing his hand to his heart. 
"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Immediately after the artist's disappearance, which was procured
by means which we have still to ascertain, he flung into his carriage,
which drove right across Paris at a furious pace."</p>

<p>"Across Paris?" asked poor Raoul, in a hoarse voice.  "What do
you mean by across Paris?"</p>

<p>"Across Paris and out of Paris ... by the Brussels road."</p>

<p>"Oh," cried the young man, "I shall catch them!"  And he rushed
out of the office.</p>

<p>"And bring her back to us!" cried the commisary gaily ...  "Ah,
that's a trick worth two of the Angel of Music's!"</p>

<p>And, turning to his audience, M. Mifroid delivered a little lecture
on police methods.</p>

<p>"I don't know for a moment whether M. le Comte de Chagny has
really carried Christine Daae off or not ... but I want to know
and I believe that, at this moment, no one is more anxious to
inform us than his brother ...  And now he is flying in pursuit
of him!  He is my chief auxiliary!  This, gentlemen, is the art
of the police, which is believed to be so complicated and which,
nevertheless appears so simple as soon its you see that it consists
in getting your work done by people who have nothing to do with
the police."</p>

<p>But M. le Commissaire de Police Mifroid would not have been quite
so satisfied with himself if he had known that the rush of his
rapid emissary was stopped at the entrance to the very first corridor. 
A tall figure blocked Raoul's way.</p>

<p>"Where are you going so fast, M. de Chagny?" asked a voice.</p>

<p>Raoul impatiently raised his eyes and recognized the astrakhan
cap of an hour ago.  He stopped:</p>

<p>"It's you!" he cried, in a feverish voice.  "You, who know Erik's
secrets and don't want me to speak of them.  Who are you?"</p>

<p>"You know who I am! ... I am the Persian!"</p>
