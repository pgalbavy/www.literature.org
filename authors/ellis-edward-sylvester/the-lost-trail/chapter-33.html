<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>"My brother speaks with a single tongue," said Deerfoot, replying
to the cringing words of Arorara: "the Great Spirit will frown
when he sees two brothers fighting each other.  Deerfoot has slain
more than one Shawanoe and has spared others; he will spare Arorara;
he may sit down beside the Osage warrior and smoke pipe with him."</p>

<p>Immediately the youth shoved his knife in place, and for the
first time seemed to become aware that he stood in the presence
of others. He bestowed no attention on Wish-o-wa-tum or his squaw,
but addressed his young friends.</p>

<p>"Let my brothers go from this lodge and make their way homeward;
Arorara will not pursue them."</p>

<p>"Arorara will do them no harm," said the individual in as cringing
manner as before.</p>

<p>"No, he will not, for Deerfoot will watch and slay Arorara if
he seeks to do so," quietly remarked the youth, who, in every
sense of the word, continued master of the situation.</p>

<p>"Let us do vot he tells us," suggested Otto, moving awkwardly
toward the door.</p>

<p>Deerfoot stepped slightly aside, to make room for them, and Jack
accepted the movement as an invitation for them to pass out. 
Otto held back so as to permit the other to go first, and he followed
close behind him.  Otto did not glance at or speak to either. 
He had his misgivings concerning not only Arorara, but the Osage,
who might resent this invasion of his castle.  Like the finely
trained Indian, he "took no chances."</p>

<p>Jack and Otto were intensely interested in the situation, but
they did not forget themselves.  The former, as he passed out,
picked up his own rifle, while Otto took the one belonging to
the Indian, who was left at liberty to hunt the gun left on the
clearing by the German lad when he prepared to start his camp-fire
for the evening. Thus each boy was furnished with the weapon which
is indispensable to the ranger of the woods.</p>

<p>Every one can understand the reluctance of the two to walk from
the lodge with their turned upon their foe.  With all their confidence
in the prowess of Deerfoot, they felt a misgiving which was sure
to distress them, so long as the enemies were in sight.  On reaching
the outside, therefore, they turned about, walked slowly backwards,
and watched the wigwam.</p>

<p>The deerskin being drawn aside, they could the figure of the
young Shawanoe, who had stepped back in front of it.  Just beyond
was partly visible the subdued Shawanoe, he and his conqueror
obscuring the squaw, still further away, while Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder
was out of range.</p>

<p>"I think that little place saw more surprises, this evening than
it will ever see again," said Jack Carleton, bending his head
with the purpose of gaining a better view; "in fact it has been
a series of surprise parties from the beginning."</p>

<p>"Yaw, dot ish vot I dinks all a'while, but mine gracious!"</p>

<p>Hitherto it had been the running vines, growing close to the
ground, which caused overturnings of Otto, but now it was another
obstruction in the shape of a tree trunk, over which Jack stepped,
taking care however, to say nothing to his companion concerning
it.  The smaller sticks lying near made it look as if the trunk
served to help the squaw of Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder, when she
was breaking or cutting wood for the wigwam.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the heels of Otto struck it and he went over
on his back, with hat and gun flying and shoes pointed upward.</p>

<p>"I dinks dot vos a pig vine," he said, clambering to his feet
and shaking himself together again.</p>

<p>"You're getting to be the best fellow at tumbling I ever saw,"
said Jack, suppressing, as well as he could, his laughter.</p>

<p>"Dot ish so," assented the victim, too good-natured to find fault
after his fortunate escape.</p>

<p>By this time, they were so far from the Osage lodge that very
little could be seen of the interior, and they turned round and
walked side by side.</p>

<p>"It seems like a dream," remarked the young Kentuckian; "a few
minutes ago, there was no escape for us, and now I cannot think
we are in the least danger."</p>

<p>"Who dinks dot de Shawanoes comes over der river after us?" asked
Otto.</p>

<p>"Nobody besides Deerfoot: there isn't anything that he doesn't
think of that is worth thinking about."</p>

<p>"Den vy he leaves us, when we leaves him?"</p>

<p>"I've asked myself that question, Otto;  it must be that, after
we parted, he learned something which told him the Shawanoes had
crossed the Mississippi after us.  He changed his course and came
to our help, and it's mighty fortunate he did so."</p>

<p>"I guess dot ish so; we will asks him when we don't see him."</p>

<p>"I have my doubt about seeing him again."</p>

<p>"How ish dot?"</p>

<p>"You remember he said more than once he had reason to take another
course, and he did do so.  He could not have been blamed for believing
we were able to get along without him, after entering Louisiana. 
At any rate, he will think so now."</p>

<p>This was a reasonable conclusion, and Otto agreed with his friend
that they were not likely to meet the extraordinary youth for
some time to come.  He would probably take another direction,
for, after the threat he uttered to Arorara, and the panic into
which he had thrown him, that warrior would be glad to hasten
back to his friends, who were equally eager to reach Kentucky
without loss of time.</p>

<p>The moon was high in the heavens and the woods open.  Much to
the relief of Otto, the vines gave him no further trouble, and
they progressed without difficulty.  The neighborhood was strange
to them, but they had tramped the wilderness too often to care. 
They were sure of the general direction they were following, and
were confident now of reaching home, which could be no great distance
away.</p>

<p>Such a buoyancy of spirits came over the boys that it was hard
to restrain themselves from shouting and leaping with joy.  But
for the mishaps attending such sport they would have run at full
speed and flung their hats in air.  Several miles were passed
before they became thoughtful and quiet.</p>

<p>"Mine gracious!" abruptly exclaimed Otto, stopping short and
striking his knee a resounding whack; "vere ain't dot hoss?"</p>

<p>"Had you forgotten about him?" asked companion with a smile.</p>

<p>"I nefer dinks apout him since we comes the lodge."</p>

<p>"I have, more than once; I made up my mind, when I found you
in the wigwam, that if you got out alive, I would insist that
we go straight home and think no more about the animal; but matters
are in a better shape, and we'll wait till to-morrow before we
decide."</p>

<p>"Dot suits me," assented Otto, nodding his head several times.</p>

<p>As nearly as they could conjecture, they were some six miles
from the residence of Wish-o-wa-tum or Man-not-Afraid-of-Thunder,
when they decided to stop for the night.  They were fully warranted
in believing that all danger from red men was ended; and, as they
had no means of finding a good camping site, they stopped at once
and began gathering fuel.  The task was soon over, and the flint
and steel gave the speedily grew into a roaring blaze, the boys
sat and looked in each other's face.</p>

<p>The night was cool, but pleasant.  Clouds, however, were continually
drifting across the face of the moon, and a certain restlessness
of feeling, of which even the rugged youngsters were sensible,
told that a change was coming.</p>

<p>The hour spent in the Osage wigwam was redolent of smoking venison,
and the boys smacked their lips and shook their heads, after the
manner of youngsters, with healthful appetites but there was no
way of procuring food, and they philosophically accepted the situation,
refraining from reference to eatables until there was a prospect
of obtaining them.</p>

<p>Through all the eventful experience of the evening, Jack and
Otto had retained their blankets.  The circumstances were such
that neither of the Indians with whom they were brought in contact
cared to secure them, though it may be suspected that, Wish-o-wa-tum
would have laid claim to that of the German, except for the visit
of Arorara and Deerfoot.</p>

<p>Seated by the cheerful fire, the friends talked in rambling fashion
until drowsy, when they wrapped their blankets around them and
lay down to sleep.  Some risk was involved in the proceeding,
inasmuch as the fire was likely to attract wild animals to the
spot, but providentially none disturbed the young pioneers, who
slept quiet and security until the sun was in the sky.</p>

<p>The first step was a hunt for breakfast, for Jack and Otto were
in a state of ravenous hunger.  They separated and were gone a
half hour, when the rifle of the young Kentuckian rang out and
he soon reappeared by the renewed camp-fire with a fine wild turkey,
which, it need not be said, afforded a nourishing and delightful
meal for them both.</p>

<p>"Otto," said Jack, springing to his feet like a refreshed giant,
"we must hunt again for the horse."</p>

<p>"Dot ishn't vot I don't dinks too&mdash;dot ish I does dinks so."</p>

<p>"And you must now try to straighten out your English, so that
Deerfoot and I may not be ashamed of you."</p>

<p>Otto nodded his head by way of assent, while he thought hard
about the proper manner of expressing himself.</p>

<p>But an almost insurmountable difficulty confronted the boys from
the first.  It was impossible to make search for the missing animal
until his footprints should be found, and the only way in which
that could be done was by retracing, to a considerable extent,
their own footsteps.  Though somewhat disappointed, Jack Carleton
was not surprised, when taking his bearings by the sun, he learned
they had wandered from the proper path.  They had turned to the
left, until the course was south of southwest.  They had gone
far astray indeed.</p>

<p>The weather became more threatening.  The sun had been above
the horizon less than an hour when its light was obscured by clouds,
and the windows of heaven were certain to be opened long before
the orb should sink in the west.</p>

<p>Two miles were traveled, when the boys found themselves so close
to a large clearing, that they wondered how it escaped their notice
the preceding night.  It covered more than an acre, and at one
time was the site of an Indian village.  As a matter of course
a small stream ran near, and the red men who at no remote day
made their dwelling places there must have numbered fully a hundred.</p>

<p>While wandering over the tract and looking about them, their
eyes rested on an elevation no more than a third of a mile distant. 
It was thickly wooded, but a prodigious rock near the crest resembled
a spot that had been burned clear.</p>

<p>"Helloa!" suddenly called out Jack Carleton, while gazing in
the direction, "there's someone on that rock."</p>

<p>"I guess it ish a crow or bear&mdash;no, it ishn't."</p>

<p>"My gracious! it's Deerfoot."</p>

<p>A moment's scrutiny proved that the individual, beyond all question
was an Indian.  Furthermore, he was making signals, probably having
descried them before they saw him.</p>

<p>"I guess he only means to salute us," said Jack.</p>

<p>Such seemed to be the case.  The red man who was Deerfoot, waved
his hand in friendly salutation several minutes, then leaped from
the rock and vanished.  It looked as if he had taken several hours
to assure himself the boys were in no danger from the Shawanoes;
and, having done so, he now bade them good-bye in his characteristic
fashion, giving his whole thought and energy to the business which
carried him far into the southwestern portion of the present State
of Missouri.</p>

<p>Jack and Otto gazed in the direction of the rock a considerable
while, hoping their friend would reappear, or that he had started
to join them; but they were compelled to believe he had left,
and for a time at least, would be seen no more.</p>

<p>The boys followed the back trail some distance further, when
to their delight they came upon the footprints of the missing
horse, marked so distinctly in the yielding earth that there could
be no mistake as to their identity.</p>

<p>"Now, that's what I call good luck," exclaimed Jack, slapping
his friend on the back.</p>

<p>"Dot ish vot I dinks&mdash;how ish dot?" asked Otto with a beaming
face, alluding to his own diction.</p>

<p>"Capital!&mdash;think twice before you speak once, and before long
you won't be the worst bungler with your tongue that lives west
of the Alleghenies."</p>

<p>'The German gazed at his companion as if on the point of reproving
him, but concluded to take time to put his words in proper shape.</p>

<p>An interesting fact was noticed by both: the trail verged toward
the elevation where they last saw Deerfoot.  Jack Carleton was
set to thinking and speculating over the situation.  He asked
himself whether, when Deerfoot was about to pass out of their
sight, his gesticulations did not signify more than his friends
supposed.</p>

<p>"I wonder if he did not mean to tell us the horse was not far
off: I believe he did."</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>dinks&mdash;ot&mdash;ish-likely&mdash;vot&mdash;he&mdash;does," assented
Otto, speaking with such deliberation that Jack looked in his
face, laughed and nodded his head, approvingly.</p>

<p>"We shall soon find out, for the trail is plain and must be new."</p>

<p>But an unpleasant truth forced itself on their notice.  Rain
drops were pattering upon the leaves, and the darkening sky presaged
a storm.</p>

<p>As the best and indeed the only way to protect themselves against
a good drenching, the boys selected a tree whose foliage was particularly
abundant, and seated themselves on the ground with their backs
against it.  Then the blankets were gathered over their heads
and around their shoulders, and they felt as secure as if in their
own log cabins, miles distant.</p>

<p>The rain fell steadily for nearly two hours, when it gradually
ceased, and Jack and Otto quickly made ready to resume their journey. 
The leaves, twigs and limbs were dripping with moisture, so that,
with the utmost care, it was impossible to advance far without
their garments becoming saturated.  That, however, was not a serious
matter, and caused little remark.</p>

<p>For some rods the hoof-prints of the horse were followed, but
then came the trouble.  The rain had beaten down the leaves on
the ground with such force that even the keen eyes of the young
Kentuckian began to doubt.  Finally the two paused, and Otto,
having carefully prepared himself, said:</p>

<p>"I dinks dot ish no use for us to hunt the horse."</p>

<p>"I am sorry to give it up and own we are beaten, but that is
what we shall have to do."</p>

<p>"Vy do we does dot?"</p>

<p>"We are trying to follow a Lost Trail."</p>

<p>"If we does dot den we gots lost ourselves."</p>

<p>"More than likely we shall, but I am afraid that if we go home
without the colt, your father will punish you."</p>

<p>Otto shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It vill not be the first times dot he does dot.  I can stand
it, I dinks."</p>

<p>"It will be a great pity, nevertheless, and shall do my best
to shame him if he should be mean enough to hold any such purpose."</p>

<p>"Mebbe after we gots home and stays one while, we start out agin
some times more and look for the golt."</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of the same thing," said Jack, who now
changed their course with the view of reaching home with the least
possible delay.</p>

<p>The boys pushed forward with so much energy that on the next
day, before the sun had reached the meridian, they arrived home,
where for present we must bid them good-bye.</p>

<p>But what befell them and Deerfoot in the eventful journey which
they speedily ventured upon in search of the <em>LOST TRAIL, </em>will
be told in Number Two of the Log Cabin Series, entitled "<em>CAMP-FIRE
AND WIGWAM</em>."</p>

<p><em>THE END</em></p>
