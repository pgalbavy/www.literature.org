<p>George Lomax returned straightway to Whitehall. As he entered
the sumptuous apartment in which he transacted affairs of State,
there was a scuffling sound.</p>

<p>Mr. Bill Eversleigh was assiduously filing letters, but a large
arm-chair near the window was still warm from contact with a human
form.</p>

<p>A very likeable young man, Bill Eversleigh. Age at a guess, twenty-five,
big and rather ungainly in his movements, a pleasurably ugly face,
a splendid set of white teeth and a pair of honest brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Richardson sent up that report yet?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. Shall I get on to him about it?"</p>

<p>"It doesn’t matter. Any telephone messages?"</p>

<p>"Miss Oscar is dealing with most of them. Mr. Isaacstein wants
to know if you can dine with him at the Savoy to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Tell Miss Oscar to look in my engagement-book. If I’m not engaged,
she can ring up and accept."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"By the way, Eversleigh, you might ring up a number for me now.
Look it up in the book. Mrs. Revel, 487, Pont Street."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Bill seized the telephone-book, ran an unseeing eye down a column
of M’s, shut the book with a bang and moved to the instrument
on the desk. With his hand upon it, he paused, as though in sudden
recollection.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, sir, I’ve just remembered. Her line’s out of order.
Mrs. Revel’s, I mean. I was trying to ring her up just now."</p>

<p>George Lomax frowned.</p>

<p>"Annoying," he said, "distinctly annoying." He tapped the table
undecidedly.</p>

<p>"If it’s anything important, sir, perhaps I might go round there
now in a taxi. She’s sure to be in at this time in the morning."</p>

<p>George Lomax hesitated, pondering the matter. Bill waited expectantly,
poised for instant flight, should the reply be favourable.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that would be the best plan," said Lomax at last. "Very
well, then, take a taxi there, and ask Mrs. Revel if she will
be at home this afternoon at four o’clock as I am very anxious
to see her about an important matter."</p>

<p>"Right, sir."</p>

<p>Bill seized his hat and departed.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, a taxi deposited him at 487, Pont Street.
He rang the bell and executed a loud rat-tat on the knocker. The
door was opened by a grave functionary to whom Bill nodded with
the ease of long acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Morning, Chilvers, Mrs. Revel in?"</p>

<p>"I believe, sir, that she is just going out."</p>

<p>"Is that you, Bill?" called a voice over the banisters. "I thought
I recognized that muscular knock. Come up and talk to me."</p>

<p>Bill looked up at the face that was laughing down on him, and
which was always inclined to reduce him—and not him alone—to a
state of babbling incoherency. He took the stairs two at a time
and clasped Virginia Revel’s out-stretched hands tightly in his.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Virginia!"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Bill!"</p>

<p>Charm is a very peculiar thing; hundreds of young women, some
of them more beautiful than Virginia Revel, might have said "Hullo,
Bill," with exactly the same intonation, and yet have produced
no effect whatever. But those two simple words, uttered by Virginia,
had the most intoxicating effect upon Bill.</p>

<p>Virginia Revel was just twenty-seven. She was tall and of an
exquisite slimness—indeed, a poem might have been written to her
slimness, it was so exquisitely proportioned. Her hair was of
real bronze, with the greenish tint in its gold; she had a determined
little chin, a lovely nose, slanting blue eyes that showed a gleam
of deepest cornflower between the half-closed lids, and a delicious
and quite indescribable mouth that tilted ever so slightly at
one corner in what is known as "the signature of Venus." It was
a wonderfully expressive face, and there was a sort of radiant
vitality about her that always challenged attention. It would
have been quite impossible ever to ignore Virginia Revel.</p>

<p>She drew Bill into the small drawing-room which was all pale
and mauve and green and yellow, like crocuses surprised in a meadow.</p>

<p>"Bill, darling," said Virginia, "isn’t the Foreign Office missing
you? I thought they couldn’t get on without you."</p>

<p>"I’ve brought a message for you from Codders."</p>

<p>Thus irreverently did Bill allude to his chief.</p>

<p>"And by the way, Virginia, in case he asks, remember that your
telephone was out of order this morning."</p>

<p>"But it hasn’t been."</p>

<p>"I know that. But I said it was."</p>

<p>"Why? Enlighten me as to this Foreign Office touch."</p>

<p>Bill threw her a reproachful glance.</p>

<p>"So that I could get here and see you, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, darling Bill, how dense of me! And how perfectly sweet of
you!"</p>

<p>"Chilvers said you were going out."</p>

<p>"So I was—to Sloane Street. There’s a place there where they’ve
got a perfectly wonderful new hip band."</p>

<p>"A hip band?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bill, <em>H.I.P. </em>hip, <em>B.A.N.D. </em>band. A band
to confine the hips. You wear it next the skin."</p>

<p>"I blush for you, Virginia. You shouldn’t describe your underwear
to a young man to whom you are not related. It isn’t delicate."</p>

<p>"But, Bill dear, there’s nothing indelicate about hips. We’ve
all got hips—although we poor women are trying awfully hard to
pretend we haven’t. This hip band is made of red rubber and comes
just to above the knee, and it’s simply impossible to walk in
it."</p>

<p>"How awful!" said Bill. "Why do you do it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because it gives one such a noble feeling to suffer for
one’s silhouette. But don’t let’s talk about my hip band. Give
me George’s message."</p>

<p>"He wants to know whether you’ll be in at four o’clock this afternoon."</p>

<p>"I shan’t. I shall be at Ranelagh. Why this sort of formal call?
Is he going to propose to me, do you think?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn’t wonder."</p>

<p>"Because, if so, you can tell him that I much prefer men who
propose on impulse."</p>

<p>"Like me?"</p>

<p>"It’s not an impulse with you, Bill. It’s habit."</p>

<p>"Virginia, won’t you ever——"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, Bill. I won’t have it in the morning before lunch.
Do try and think of me as a nice motherly person approaching middle
age who has your interests thoroughly at heart."</p>

<p>"Virginia, I do love you so."</p>

<p>"I know, Bill, I know. And I simply love being loved. Isn’t it
wicked and dreadful of me? I should like every nice man in the
world to be in love with me."</p>

<p>"Most of them are, I expect," said Bill gloomily.</p>

<p>"But I hope George isn’t in love with me. I don’t think he can
be. He’s so wedded to his career. What else did he say?"</p>

<p>"Just that it was very important."</p>

<p>"Bill, I’m getting intrigued. The things that George thinks important
are so awfully limited. I think I must chuck Ranelagh. After all,
I can go to Ranelagh any day. Tell George that I shall be awaiting
him meekly at four o’clock."</p>

<p>Bill looked at his wrist watch.</p>

<p>"It seems hardly worth while to go back before lunch. Come out
and chew something, Virginia."</p>

<p>"I’m going out to lunch somewhere or other."</p>

<p>"That doesn’t matter. Make a day of it, and chuck everything
all round."</p>

<p>"It would be rather nice," said Virginia, smiling at him.</p>

<p>"Virginia, you’re a darling. Tell me, you do like me rather,
don’t you? Better than other people."</p>

<p>"Bill, I adore you. If I had to marry some one—simply had to—I
mean if it was in a book and a wicked mandarin said to me ‘Marry
some one or die by slow torture,’ I should choose you at once—I
should indeed. I should say, ‘Give me little Bill.’"</p>

<p>"Well, then——"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I haven’t got to marry any one. I love being a wicked
widow."</p>

<p>"You could do all the same things still. Go about, and all that.
You’d hardly notice me about the house."</p>

<p>"Bill, you don’t understand. I’m the kind of person who marries
enthusiastically if they marry at all."</p>

<p>Bill gave a hollow groan.</p>

<p>"I shall shoot myself one of these days, I expect," he murmured
gloomily.</p>

<p>"No, you won’t, Bill darling. You’ll take a pretty girl out to
supper—like you did the night before last."</p>

<p>Mr. Eversleigh was momentarily confused.</p>

<p>"If you mean Dorothy Kirkpatrick, the girl who’s in <em>Hooks
and Eyes</em>, I—well, dash it all, she’s a thoroughly nice girl,
straight as they make ’em. There was no harm in it."</p>

<p>"Bill, darling, of course there wasn’t. I love you to enjoy yourself.
But don’t pretend to be dying of a broken heart, that’s all."</p>

<p>Mr. Eversleigh recovered his dignity.</p>

<p>"You don’t understand at all, Virginia," he said severely. "Men——"</p>

<p>"Are polygamous! I know they are. Sometimes I have a shrewd suspicion
that I am polyandrous. If you really love me, Bill, take me out
to lunch quickly."</p>
