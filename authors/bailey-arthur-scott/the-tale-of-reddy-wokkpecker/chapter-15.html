<p>Reddy Woodpecker knew that Mr. Crow would come back to the orchard to
ask him another question.  The old gentleman simply had to learn more
about Reddy’s club.
</p><p>"I’d like to knew—" said Mr. Crow—"I’d like to know why you are the
president of The Redcaps."
</p><p>"That’s easily answered," Reddy replied. "It’s because I wear the
biggest and reddest cap of all the birds in the neighborhood."
</p><p>Mr. Crow puzzled over the matter for a time.
</p><p>"I don’t understand what difference your cap makes," he said at last.
"I’ve been thinking about joining the club. And _I_ have no red cap."
</p><p>"That’s true, Mr. Crow," Reddy agreed.  "And that’s the reason why you
can’t join my club.  Nobody that doesn’t wear a red cap can be a member
of The Redcaps."
</p><p>Mr. Crow looked daggers at him.
</p><p>"Humph!" cried the old gentleman. "I’ve been thinking about joining the
club.  But I’ve decided not to do it."
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker smiled at him. And for some reason Mr. Crow became
angry.
</p><p>"How many members has your club?" he squawked.
</p><p>"One!" Reddy told him.
</p><p>"Ha!" the old fellow exclaimed.  "You can’t have a club with only one
member."
</p><p>"I expect that several of the neighbors will join The Redcaps
to-morrow," said Reddy Woodpecker.  "They ’re only waiting for an
invitation."
</p><p>"Let me see," Mr. Crow murmured. "There’s your cousin Mr. Flicker.  He
wears a red patch on the back of his head. But you can’t call it a cap."
</p><p>"_I_ call it a cap," Reddy Woodpecker told him.  "Mr. Flicker is going
to get an invitation."
</p><p>Mr. Crow then muttered something about <u>cousins</u>, and added something
more about <u>birds of a feather flocking together</u>. And then he said,
"There’s the Downy Woodpecker and there’s the Hairy Woodpecker—both
cousins of yours, too. They’ve only what you might call a <u>touch</u> of red
on the backs of their necks; but I suppose——"
</p><p>"Yes!  I’m going to invite them to join The Redcaps," Reddy interrupted.
</p><p>Mr. Crow looked terribly upset, though he claimed it was no more than he
had expected.  "That will be about all the members you will get," he
added.
</p><p>"Oh, no!" Reddy exclaimed.  "You forget Mr. Sapsucker.  He has a scarlet
crown.  I’ll want him."
</p><p>Mr. Crow swallowed hard a few times but said nothing.
</p><p>"Then there’s the Ruby-crowned Kinglet," Reddy went on.  "He’s going to
have an invitation.  And so is Mr. Kingbird."
</p><p>"Not Mr. Kingbird!" spluttered old Mr. Crow.  "His crown is
orange-colored."
</p><p>"It’s red enough for me," Reddy retorted. "And of course I’ll ask little
Mr. Chippy to join us."
</p><p>"Nonsense!" cried Mr. Crow.  "His cap is only chestnut-colored."
</p><p>"It’s red enough for me," Reddy Woodpecker repeated in a firm voice.
</p><p>"My goodness!" Mr. Crow squalled. "I suppose you’ll ask the whole Wood
Thrush family too—and their cousin Mr. Veery.  Their heads are reddish."
</p><p>"No!  They’re too brown for me," Reddy Woodpecker decided, to Mr. Crow’s
great relief.
</p><p>"What about Buddy Brown Thrasher?" Mr. Crow inquired.  "What about his
head?"
</p><p>"Too brown!"
</p><p>"Well," said old Mr. Crow, "I’m glad to see you have a <u>little</u> sense.
But on the whole these Redcaps are going to be a queer lot."
