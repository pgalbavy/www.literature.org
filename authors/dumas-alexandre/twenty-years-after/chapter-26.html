<P>They rode on in this way for ten minutes. Suddenly two dark
forms seemed to separate from the mass, advanced, grew in
size, and as they loomed up larger and larger, assumed the
appearance of two horsemen.</P>
<P>&quot;Aha!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, &quot;they're coming toward us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So much the worse for them,&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Who goes there?&quot; cried a hoarse voice.</P>
<P>The three horsemen made no reply, stopped not, and all that
was heard was the noise of swords drawn from the scabbards
and the cocking of the pistols with which the two phantoms
were armed.</P>
<P>&quot;Bridle in mouth!&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>Porthos understood him and he and the lieutenant each drew
with the left hand a pistol from their bolsters and cocked
it in their turn.</P>
<P>&quot;Who goes there?&quot; was asked a second time. &quot;Not a step
forward, or you're dead men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Stuff!&quot; cried Porthos, almost choked with dust and chewing
his bridle as a horse chews his bit. &quot;Stuff and nonsense; we
have seen plenty of dead men in our time.&quot;</P>
<P>Hearing these words, the two shadows blockaded the road and
by the light of the stars might be seen the shining of their
arms.</P>
<P>&quot;Back!&quot; shouted D'Artagnan, &quot;or you are dead!&quot;</P>
<P>Two shots were the reply to this threat; but the assailants
attacked their foes with such velocity that in a moment they
were upon them; a third pistol-shot was heard, aimed by
D'Artagnan, and one of his adversaries fell. As for Porthos,
he assaulted the foe with such violence that, although his
sword was thrust aside, the enemy was thrown off his horse
and fell about ten steps from it.</P>
<P>&quot;Finish, Mouston, finish the work!&quot; cried Porthos. And he
darted on beside his friend, who had already begun a fresh
pursuit.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;I've broken my man's skull,&quot; cried D'Artagnan. &quot;And you
 -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've only thrown the fellow down, but hark!&quot;</P>
<P>Another shot of a carbine was heard. It was Musqueton, who
was obeying his master's command.</P>
<P>&quot;On! on!&quot; cried D'Artagnan; &quot;all goes well! we have the
first throw.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ha! ha!&quot; answered Porthos, &quot;behold, other players appear.&quot;</P>
<P>And in fact, two other cavaliers made their appearance,
detached, as it seemed, from the principal group; they again
disputed the road.</P>
<P>This time the lieutenant did not wait for the opposite party
to speak.</P>
<P>&quot;Stand aside!&quot; he cried; &quot;stand off the road!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked a voice.</P>
<P>&quot;The duke!&quot; Porthos and D'Artagnan roared out both at once.</P>
<P>A burst of laughter was the answer, but finished with a
groan. D'Artagnan had, with his sword, cut in two the poor
wretch who had laughed.</P>
<P>At the same time Porthos and his adversary fired on each
other and D'Artagnan turned to him.</P>
<P>&quot;Bravo! you've killed him, I think.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, wounded his horse only.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What would you have, my dear fellow? One doesn't hit the
bull's-eye every time; it is something to hit inside the
ring. Ho! parbleau! what is the matter with my horse?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Your horse is falling,&quot; said Porthos, reining in his own.</P>
<P>In truth, the lieutenant's horse stumbled and fell on his
knees; then a rattling in his throat was heard and he lay
down to die. He had received in the chest the bullet of
D'Artagnan's first adversary. D'Artagnan swore loud enough
to be heard in the skies.</P>
<P>&quot;Does your honor want a horse?&quot; asked Musqueton.</P>
<P>&quot;Zounds! want one!&quot; cried the Gascon.</P>
<P>&quot;Here's one, your honor  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;How the devil hast thou two horses?&quot; asked D'Artagnan,
jumping on one of them.</P>
<P>&quot;Their masters are dead! I thought they might be useful, so
I took them.&quot;</P>
<P>Meantime Porthos had reloaded his pistols.</P>
<P>&quot;Be on the qui vive!&quot; cried D'Artagnan. &quot;Here are two other
cavaliers.&quot;</P>
<P>As he spoke, two horsemen advanced at full speed.</P>
<P>&quot;Ho! your honor!&quot; cried Musqueton, &quot;the man you upset is
getting up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Why didn't thou do as thou didst to the first man?&quot; said
Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;I held the horses, my hands were full, your honor.&quot;</P>
<P>A shot was fired that moment; Musqueton shrieked with pain.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, sir! I'm hit in the other side! exactly opposite the
other! This hurt is just the fellow of the one I had on the
road to Amiens.&quot;</P>
<P>Porthos turned around like a lion, plunged on the dismounted
cavalier, who tried to draw his sword; but before it was out
of the scabbard, Porthos, with the hilt of his had struck
him such a terrible blow on the head that he fell like an ox
beneath the butcher's knife.</P>
<P>Musqueton, groaning, slipped from his horse, his wound not
allowing him to keep the saddle.</P>
<P>On perceiving the cavaliers, D'Artagnan had stopped and
charged his pistol afresh; besides, his horse, he found, had
a carbine on the bow of the saddle.</P>
<P>&quot;Here I am!&quot; exclaimed Porthos. &quot;Shall we wait, or shall we
charge?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us charge them,&quot; answered the Gascon.</P>
<P>&quot;Charge!&quot; cried Porthos.</P>
<P>They spurred on their horses; the other cavaliers were only
twenty steps from them.</P>
<P>&quot;For the king!&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;The king has no authority here!&quot; answered a deep voice,
which seemed to proceed from a cloud, so enveloped was the
cavalier in a whirlwind of dust.</P>
<P>&quot;'Tis well, we will see if the king's name is not a passport
everywhere,&quot; replied the Gascon.</P>
<P>&quot;See!&quot; answered the voice.</P>
<P>Two shots were fired at once, one by D'Artagnan, the other
by the adversary of Porthos. D'Artagnan's ball took off his
enemy's hat. The ball fired by Porthos's foe went through
the throat of his horse, which fell, groaning.</P>
<P>&quot;For the last time, where are you going?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To the devil!&quot; answered D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Good! you may be easy, then  -  you'll get there.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan then saw a musket-barrel leveled at him; he had
no time to draw from his holsters. He recalled a bit of
advice which Athos had once given him, and made his horse
rear.</P>
<P>The ball struck the animal full in front. D'Artagnan felt
his horse giving way under him and with his wonderful
agility threw himself to one side.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! this,&quot; cried the voice, the tone of which was at once
polished and jeering, &quot;this is nothing but a butchery of
horses and not a combat between men. To the sword, sir! the
sword!&quot;</P>
<P>And he jumped off his horse.</P>
<P>&quot;To the swords! be it so!&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;that is
exactly what I want.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan, in two steps, was engaged with the foe, whom,
according to custom, he attacked impetuously, but he met
this time with a skill and a strength of arm that gave him
pause. Twice he was obliged to step back; his opponent
stirred not one inch. D'Artagnan returned and again attacked
him.</P>
<P>Twice or thrice thrusts were attempted on both sides,
without effect; sparks were emitted from the swords like
water spouting forth.</P>
<P>At last D'Artagnan thought it was time to try one of his
favorite feints in fencing. He brought it to bear,
skillfully executed it with the rapidity of lightning, and
struck the blow with a force which he fancied would prove
irresistible.</P>
<P>The blow was parried.</P>
<P>&quot;'Sdeath!&quot; he cried, with his Gascon accent.</P>
<P>At this exclamation his adversary bounded back and, bending
his bare head, tried to distinguish in the gloom the
features of the lieutenant.</P>
<P>As to D'Artagnan, afraid of some feint, he still stood on
the defensive.</P>
<P>&quot;Have a care,&quot; cried Porthos to his opponent; &quot;I've still
two pistols charged.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The more reason you should fire the first!&quot; cried his foe.</P>
<P>Porthos fired; the flash threw a gleam of light over the
field of battle.</P>
<P>As the light shone on them a cry was heard from the other
two combatants.</P>
<P>&quot;Athos!&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan!&quot; ejaculated Athos.</P>
<P>Athos raised his sword; D'Artagnan lowered his.</P>
<P>&quot;Aramis!&quot; cried Athos, &quot;don't fire!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ah! ha! is it you, Aramis?&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>And he threw away his pistol.</P>
<P>Aramis pushed his back into his saddle-bags and sheathed his
sword.</P>
<P>&quot;My son!&quot; exclaimed Athos, extending his hand to D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>This was the name which he gave him in former days, in their
moments of tender intimacy.</P>
<P>&quot;Athos!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, wringing his hands. &quot;So you
defend him! And I, who have sworn to take him dead or alive,
I am dishonored  -  and by you!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Kill me!&quot; replied Athos, uncovering his breast, &quot;if your
honor requires my death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh! woe is me! woe is me!&quot; cried the lieutenant; &quot;there's
only one man in the world who could stay my hand; by a
fatality that very man bars my way. What shall I say to the
cardinal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You can tell him, sir,&quot; answered a voice which was the
voice of high command in the battle-field, &quot;that he sent
against me the only two men capable of getting the better of
four men; of fighting man to man, without discomfiture,
against the Comte de la Fere and the Chevalier d'Herblay,
and of surrendering only to fifty men!</P>
<P>&quot;The prince!&quot; exclaimed at the same moment Athos and Aramis,
unmasking as they addressed the Duc de Beaufort, whilst
D'Artagnan and Porthos stepped backward.</P>
<P>&quot;Fifty cavaliers!&quot; cried the Gascon and Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Look around you, gentlemen, if you doubt the fact,&quot; said
the duke.</P>
<P>The two friends looked to the right, to the left; they were
encompassed by a troop of horsemen.</P>
<P>&quot;Hearing the noise of the fight,&quot; resumed the duke, &quot;I
fancied you had about twenty men with you, so I came back
with those around me, tired of always running away, and
wishing to draw my sword in my own cause; but you are only
two.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, my lord; but, as you have said, two that are a match
for twenty,&quot; said Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, gentlemen, your swords,&quot; said the duke.</P>
<P>&quot;Our swords!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, raising his head and
regaining his self-possession. &quot;Never!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never!&quot; added Porthos.</P>
<P>Some of the men moved toward them.</P>
<P>&quot;One moment, my lord,&quot; whispered Athos, and he said
something in a low voice.</P>
<P>&quot;As you will,&quot; replied the duke. &quot;I am too much indebted to
you to refuse your first request. Gentlemen,&quot; he said to his
escort, &quot;withdraw. Monsieur d'Artagnan, Monsieur du Vallon,
you are free.&quot;</P>
<P>The order was obeyed; D'Artagnan and Porthos then found
themselves in the centre of a large circle.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, D'Herblay,&quot; said Athos, &quot;dismount and come here.&quot;</P>
<P>Aramis dismounted and went to Porthos, whilst Athos
approached D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>All four once more together.</P>
<P>&quot;Friends!&quot; said Athos, &quot;do you regret you have not shed our
blood?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; replied D'Artagnan; &quot;I regret to see that we, hitherto
united, are opposed to each other. Ah! nothing will ever go
well with us hereafter!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Heaven! No, all is over!&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, be on our side now,&quot; resumed Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;Silence, D'Herblay!&quot; cried Athos; &quot;such proposals are not
to be made to gentlemen such as these. 'Tis a matter of
conscience with them, as with us.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Meantime, here we are, enemies!&quot; said Porthos. &quot;Gramercy!
who would ever have thought it?&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan only sighed.</P>
<P>Athos looked at them both and took their hands in his.</P>
<P>&quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;this is a serious business and my
heart bleeds as if you had pierced it through and through.
Yes, we are severed; there is the great, the distressing
truth! But we have not as yet declared war; perhaps we shall
have to make certain conditions, therefore a solemn
conference is indispensable.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;For my own part, I demand it,&quot; said Aramis.</P>
<P>&quot;I accept it,&quot; interposed D'Artagnan, proudly.</P>
<P>Porthos bowed, as if in assent.</P>
<P>&quot;Let us choose a place of rendezvous,&quot; continued Athos, &quot;and
in a last interview arrange our mutual position and the
conduct we are to maintain toward each other.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good!&quot; the other three exclaimed.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, the place?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will the Place Royale suit you?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;In Paris?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes.&quot;</P>
<P>Athos and Aramis looked at each other.</P>
<P>&quot;The Place Royale  -  be it so!&quot; replied Athos.</P>
<P>&quot;When?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To-morrow evening, if you like!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At what hour?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At ten in the evening, if that suits you; by that time we
shall have returned.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Good.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There,&quot; continued Athos, &quot;either peace or war will be
decided; honor, at all events, will be maintained!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Alas!&quot; murmured D'Artagnan, &quot;our honor as soldiers is lost
to us forever!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;D'Artagnan,&quot; said Athos, gravely, &quot;I assure you that you do
me wrong in dwelling so upon that. What I think of is, that
we have crossed swords as enemies. Yes,&quot; he continued, sadly
shaking his head, &quot;Yes, it is as you said, misfortune,
indeed, has overtaken us. Come, Aramis.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And we, Porthos,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;will return, carrying
our shame to the cardinal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And tell him,&quot; cried a voice, &quot;that I am not too old yet
for a man of action.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan recognized the voice of De Rochefort.</P>
<P>&quot;Can I do anything for you, gentlemen?&quot; asked the duke.</P>
<P>&quot;Bear witness that we have done all that we could.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That shall be testified to, rest assured. Adieu! we shall
meet soon, I trust, in Paris, where you shall have your
revenge.&quot; The duke, as he spoke, kissed his hand, spurred
his horse into a gallop and disappeared, followed by his
troop, who were soon lost in distance and darkness.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan and Porthos were now alone with a man who held by
the bridles two horses; they thought it was Musqueton and
went up to him.</P>
<P>&quot;What do I see?&quot; cried the lieutenant. &quot;Grimaud, is it
thou?&quot;</P>
<P>Grimaud signified that he was not mistaken.</P>
<P>&quot;And whose horses are these?&quot; cried D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;Who has given them to us?&quot; said Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;The Comte de la Fere.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Athos! Athos!&quot; muttered D'Artagnan; &quot;you think of every
one; you are indeed a nobleman! Whither art thou going,
Grimaud?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;To join the Vicomte de Bragelonne in Flanders, your honor.&quot;</P>
<P>They were taking the road toward Paris, when groans, which
seemed to proceed from a ditch, attracted their attention.</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot; asked D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;It is I  -  Musqueton,&quot; said a mournful voice, whilst a sort
of shadow arose out of the side of the road.</P>
<P>Porthos ran to him. &quot;Art thou dangerously wounded, my dear
Musqueton?&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;No, sir, but I am severely.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What can we do?&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;we must return to
Paris.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will take care of Musqueton,&quot; said Grimaud; and he gave
his arm to his old comrade, whose eyes were full of tears,
nor could Grimaud tell whether the tears were caused by
wounds or by the pleasure of seeing him again.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan and Porthos went on, meantime, to Paris. They
were passed by a sort of courier, covered with dust, the
bearer of a letter from the duke to the cardinal, giving
testimony to the valor of D'Artagnan and Porthos.</P>
<P>Mazarin had passed a very bad night when this letter was
brought to him, announcing that the duke was free and that
he would henceforth raise up mortal strife against him.</P>
<P>&quot;What consoles me,&quot; said the cardinal after reading the
letter, &quot;is that, at least, in this chase, D'Artagnan has
done me one good turn  -  he has destroyed Broussel. This
Gascon is a precious fellow; even his misadventures are of
use.&quot;</P>
<P>The cardinal referred to that man whom D'Artagnan upset at
the corner of the Cimetiere Saint Jean in Paris, and who was
no other than the Councillor Broussel.</P></article>
