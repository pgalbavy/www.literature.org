<P>
Daylight awoke with the familiar parched mouth and lips and
throat, took a long drink of water from the pitcher beside his
bed, and gathered up the train of thought where he had left it
the night before.  He reviewed the easement of the financial
strain.  Things were mending at last.  While the going was still
rough, the greatest dangers were already past.  As he had told
Hegan, a tight rein and careful playing were all that was needed
now.  Flurries and dangers were bound to come, but not so grave
as the ones they had already weathered.  He had been hit hard,
but he was coming through without broken bones, which was more
than Simon Dolliver and many another could say.  And not one of
his business friends had been ruined.  He had compelled them to
stay in line to save himself, and they had been saved as well.
<P>
His mind moved on to the incident at the corner of the bar of the
Parthenon, when the young athlete had turned his hand down.  He
was no longer stunned by the event, but he was shocked and
grieved, as only a strong man can be, at this passing of his
strength.  And the issue was too clear for him to dodge, even
with himself.  He knew why his hand had gone down.  Not because
he was an old man.  He was just in the first flush of his prime,
and, by rights, it was the hand of the hammer-thrower which
should have gone down.  Daylight knew that he had taken liberties
with himself.  He had always looked upon this strength of his as
permanent, and here, for years, it had been steadily oozing from
him.  As he had diagnosed it, he had come in from under the stars
to roost in the coops of cities.  He had almost forgotten how to
walk.  He had lifted up his feet and been ridden around in
automobiles, cabs and carriages, and electric cars.  He had not
exercised, and he had dry-rotted his muscles with alcohol.
<P>
And was it worth it?  What did all his money mean after all? 
Dede was right.  It could buy him no more than one bed at a time,
and at the same time it made him the abjectest of slaves.  It
tied him fast.  He was tied by it right now.  Even if he so
desired, he could not lie abed this very day.  His money called
him.  The office whistle would soon blow, and he must answer it. 
The early sunshine was streaming through his window--a fine day
for a ride in the hills on Bob, with Dede beside him on her Mab. 
Yet all his millions could not buy him this one day.  One of
those flurries might come along, and he had to be on the spot to
meet it.  Thirty millions!  And they were powerless to persuade
Dede to ride on Mab--Mab, whom he had bought, and who was unused
and growing fat on pasture.  What were thirty millions when they
could not buy a man a ride with the girl he loved?  Thirty
millions!--that made him come here and go there, that rode upon
him like so many millstones, that destroyed him while they grew,
that put their foot down and prevented him from winning this girl
who worked for ninety dollars a month.
<P>
Which was better?  he asked himself.  All this was Dede's own
thought.  It was what she had meant when she prayed he would go
broke.  He held up his offending right arm.  It wasn't the same
old arm.  Of course she could not love that arm and that body as
she had loved the strong, clean arm and body of years before.  He
didn't like that arm and body himself.  A young whippersnapper
had been able to take liberties with it.  It had gone back on
him.  He sat up suddenly.  No, by God, he had gone back on it! 
He had gone back on himself.  He had gone back on Dede.  She was
right, a thousand times right, and she had sense enough to know
it, sense enough to refuse to marry a money slave with a
whiskey-rotted carcass.  
<P>
He got out of bed and looked at himself in the long mirror on the
wardrobe door.  He wasn't pretty.  The old-time lean cheeks
were gone.  These were heavy, seeming to hang down by their own
weight.  He looked for the lines of cruelty Dede had spoken of,
and he found them, and he found the harshness in the eyes as
well, the eyes that were muddy now after all the cocktails of the
night before, and of the months and years before.  He looked at
the clearly defined pouches that showed under his eyes, and
they've shocked him.  He rolled up the sleeve of his pajamas.  No
wonder the hammer-thrower had put his hand down.  Those weren't
muscles.  A rising tide of fat had submerged them.  He stripped
off the pajama coat.  Again he was shocked, this time but the
bulk of his body.  It wasn't pretty.  The lean stomach had become
a paunch.  The ridged muscles of chest and shoulders and abdomen
had broken down into rolls of flesh.
<P>
He sat down on the bed, and through his mind drifted pictures of
his youthful excellence, of the hardships he had endured over
other men, of the Indians and dogs he had run off their legs in
the heart-breaking days and nights on the Alaskan trail, of the
feats of strength that had made him king over a husky race of
frontiersmen.
<P>
And this was age.  Then there drifted across the field of vision
of his mind's eye the old man he had encountered at Glen Ellen,
corning up the hillside through the fires of sunset, white-headed
and white-bearded, eighty-four, in his hand the pail of foaming
milk and in his face all the warm glow and content of the passing
summer day.  That had been age.  "Yes siree, eighty-four, and
spryer than most," he could hear the old man say.  "And I ain't
loafed none. I walked across the Plains with an ox-team and fit
Injuns in '51, and I was a family man then with seven
youngsters."
<P>
Next he remembered the old woman of the chaparral, pressing
grapes in her mountain clearing; and Ferguson, the little man who
had scuttled into the road like a rabbit, the one-time managing
editor of a great newspaper, who was content to live in the
chaparral along with his spring of mountain water and his
hand-reared and manicured fruit trees.  Ferguson had solved a
problem.  A weakling and an alcoholic, he had run away from the
doctors and the chicken-coop of a city, and soaked up health like
a thirsty sponge.  Well, Daylight pondered, if a sick man whom
the doctors had given up could develop into a healthy farm
laborer, what couldn't a merely stout man like himself do under
similar circumstances?  He caught a vision of his body with all
its youthful excellence returned, and thought of Dede, and sat
down suddenly on the bed, startled by the greatness of the idea
that had come to him.
<P>
He did not sit long.  His mind, working in its customary way,
like a steel trap, canvassed the idea in all its bearings.  It
was big--bigger than anything he had faced before.  And he faced
it squarely, picked it up in his two hands and turned it over and
around and looked at it.  The simplicity of it delighted him.  He
chuckled over it, reached his decision, and began to dress. 
Midway in the dressing he stopped in order to use the telephone.
<P>
Dede was the first he called up.
<P>
"Don't come to the office this morning," he said.  "I'm coming
out to see you for a moment."  He called up others.  He ordered
his motor-car.  To Jones he gave instructions for the forwarding
of Bob and Wolf to Glen Ellen.  Hegan he surprised by asking him
to look up the deed of the Glen Ellen ranch and make out a new
one in Dede Mason's name.  "Who?" Hegan demanded.  "Dede Mason,"
Daylight replied imperturbably the 'phone must be indistinct this
morning.  "D-e-d-e M-a-s o-n.  Got it?"
<P>
Half an hour later he was flying out to Berkeley.  And for the
first time the big red car halted directly before the house. 
Dede offered to receive him in the parlor, but he shook his head
and nodded toward her rooms.
<P>
"In there," he said.  "No other place would suit."
<P>
As the door closed, his arms went out and around her.  Then he
stood with his hands on her shoulders and looking down into her
face.
<P>
"Dede, if I tell you, flat and straight, that I'm going up to
live on that ranch at Glen Ellen, that I ain't taking a cent with
me, that I'm going to scratch for every bite I eat, and that I
ain't going to play ary a card at the business game again, will
you come along with me?" 
<P>
She gave a glad little cry, and he nestled her in closely.  But
the
next moment she had thrust herself out from him to the old
position at arm's length.
<P>
"I-I don't understand," she said breathlessly.
<P>
"And you ain't answered my proposition, though I guess no answer
is necessary.  We're just going to get married right away and
start.  I've sent Bob and Wolf along already.  When will you be
ready?"
<P>
Dede could not forbear to smile.  "My, what a hurricane of a man
it is.  I'm quite blown away.  And you haven't explained a word
to me."
<P>
Daylight smiled responsively.
<P>
"Look here, Dede, this is what card-sharps call a show-down.  No
more philandering and frills and long-distance sparring between
you and me.  We're just going to talk straight out in
meeting--the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.  Now you
answer some questions for me, and then I'll answer yours."    
<P>
He paused.  "Well, I've got only one question after all: Do you
love me enough to marry me?"
<P>
"But--" she began.
<P>
"No buts," he broke in sharply.  "This is a show-down.  When I
say marry, I mean what I told you at first, that we'd go up and
live on the ranch.  Do you love me enough for that?"
<P>
She looked at him for a moment, then her lids dropped, and all of
her seemed to advertise consent.
<P>
"Come on, then, let's start."  The muscles of his legs tensed
involuntarily as if he were about to lead her to the door.  "My
auto's waiting outside.  There's nothing to delay excepting
getting on your hat."
<P>
He bent over her. "I reckon it's allowable," he said, as he
kissed her.
<P>
It was a long embrace, and she was the first to speak.
<P>
"You haven't answered my questions.  How is this possible?  How
can you leave your business?  Has anything happened?"
<P>
"No, nothing's happened yet, but it's going to, blame quick. 
I've taken your preaching to heart, and I've come to the penitent
form.  You are my Lord God, and I'm sure going to serve you.  The
rest can go to thunder.  You were sure right.  I've been the
slave to my money, and since I can't serve two masters I'm
letting the money slide.  I'd sooner have you than all the money
in the world, that's all."  Again he held her closely in his
arms.  "And I've sure got you, Dede.  I've sure got you.
<P>
"And I want to tell you a few more.  I've taken my last drink. 
You're marrying a whiskey-soak, but your husband won't be that. 
He's going to grow into another man so quick you won't know him. 
A couple of months from now, up there in Glen Ellen, you'll wake
up some morning and find you've got a perfect stranger in the
house with you, and you'll have to get introduced to him all over
again.  You'll say, 'I'm Mrs. Harnish, who are you?" And I'll
say, 'I'm Elam Harnish's younger brother.  I've just arrived from
Alaska to attend the funeral.' 'What funeral?' you'll say.  And
I'll say, 'Why, the funeral of that good-for-nothing, gambling,
whiskey-drinking Burning Daylight--the man that died of fatty
degeneration of the heart from sitting in night and day at the
business game 'Yes ma'am,' I'll say, 'he's sure a gone 'coon, but
I've come to take his place and make you happy.  And now, ma'am,
if you'll allow me, I'll just meander down to the pasture and
milk the cow while you're getting breakfast.'"
<P>
Again he caught her hand and made as if to start with her for the
door.  When she resisted, he bent and kissed her again and again.
<P>
"I'm sure hungry for you, little woman," he murmured "You make
thirty millions look like thirty cents."
<P>
"Do sit down and be sensible," she urged, her cheeks flushed, the
golden light in her eyes burning more golden than he had ever
seen it before.
<P>
But Daylight was bent on having his way, and when he sat down it
was with her beside him and his arm around her.
<P>
"'Yes, ma'am,' I'll say, 'Burning Daylight was a pretty good
cuss, but it's better that he's gone.  He quit rolling up in his
rabbit-skins and sleeping in the snow, and went to living in a
chicken-coop.  He lifted up his legs and quit walking and
working, and took to existing on Martini cocktails and Scotch
whiskey.  He thought he loved you, ma'am, and he did his best,
but he loved his cocktails more, and he loved his money more, and
himself more, and 'most everything else more than he did you.'
And then I'll say, 'Ma'am, you just run your eyes over me and see
how different I am.  I ain't got a cocktail thirst, and all the
money I got is a dollar and forty cents and I've got to buy a new
ax, the last one being plumb wore out, and I can love you just
about eleven times as much as your first husband did.  You see,
ma'am, he went all to fat.  And there ain't ary ounce of fat on
me.' And I'll roll up my sleeve and show you, and say, 'Mrs.
Harnish, after having experience with being married to that old
fat money-bags, do you-all mind marrying a slim young fellow like
me?' And you'll just wipe a tear away for poor old Daylight, and
kind of lean toward me with a willing expression in your eye, and
then I'll blush maybe some, being a young fellow, and put my arm
around you, like that, and then--why, then I'll up and marry my
brother's widow, and go out and do the chores while she's cooking
a bite to eat."
<P>
"But you haven't answered my questions," she reproached him, as
she emerged, rosy and radiant, from the embrace that had
accompanied the culmination of his narrative.
<P>
"Now just what do you want to know?" he asked.
<P>
"I want to know how all this is possible?  How you are able to
leave your business at a time like this?  What you meant by
saying that something was going to happen quickly?  I--" She
hesitated and blushed. "I answered your question, you know."
<P>
"Let's go and get married," he urged, all the whimsicality of his
utterance duplicated in his eyes.  "You know I've got to make way
for that husky young brother of mine, and I ain't got long to
live."  She made an impatient moue, and he continued seriously.
<P>
"You see, it's like this, Dede.  I've been working like forty
horses ever since this blamed panic set in, and all the time some
of those ideas you'd given me were getting ready to sprout. 
Well, they sprouted this morning, that's all.  I started to get
up, expecting to go to the office as usual.  But I didn't go to
the office.  All that sprouting took place there and then.  The
sun was shining in the window, and I knew it was a fine day in
the hills.  And I knew I wanted to ride in the hills with you
just about thirty million times more than I wanted to go to the
office.  And I knew all the time it was impossible.  And why? 
Because of the office.  The office wouldn't let me.  All my money
reared right up on its hind legs and got in the way and wouldn't
let me.  It's a way that blamed money has of getting in the way. 
You know that yourself.
<P>
"And then I made up my mind that I was to the dividing of the
ways.  One way led to the office.  The other way led to Berkeley.
<P>
And I took the Berkeley road.  I'm never going to set foot in the
office again.  That's all gone, finished, over and done with, and
I'm letting it slide clean to smash and then some.  My mind's set
on this.  You see, I've got religion, and it's sure the old-time
religion; it's love and you, and it's older than the oldest
religion in the world.  It's IT, that's what it is--IT, with a
capital I-T."
<P>
She looked at him with a sudden, startled expression.
<P>
"You mean--?" she began.
<P>
"I mean just that.  I'm wiping the slate clean.  I'm letting it
all go to smash.  When them thirty million dollars stood up to my
face and said I couldn't go out with you in the hills to-day, I
knew the time had come for me to put my foot down.  And I'm
putting it down.  I've got you, and my strength to work for you,
and that little ranch in Sonoma.  That's all I want, and that's
all I'm going to save out, along with Bob and Wolf, a suit case
and a hundred and forty hair bridles.  All the rest goes, and
good riddance.  It's that much junk."
<P>
But Dede was insistent.
<P>
"Then this--this tremendous loss is all unnecessary?" she asked.
<P>
"Just what I haven't been telling you.  It IS necessary.  If that
money thinks it can stand up right to my face and say I can't go
riding with you-"
<P>
"No, no; be serious," Dede broke in.  "I don't mean that, and you
know it.  What I want to know is, from a standpoint of business,
is this failure necessary?"
<P>
He shook his head.
<P>
"You bet it isn't necessary.  That's the point of it.  I'm not
letting go of it because I'm licked to a standstill by the panic
and have got to let go.  I'm firing it out when I've licked the
panic and am winning, hands down.  That just shows how little I
think of it.  It's you that counts, little woman, and I make my
play accordingly."
<P>
But she drew away from his sheltering arms.
<P>
"You are mad, Elam."
<P>
"Call me that again," he murmured ecstatically.  "It's sure
sweeter than the chink of millions."
<P>
All this she ignored.
<P>
"It's madness.  You don't know what you are doing--"
<P>
"Oh, yes, I do," he assured her.  "I'm winning the dearest wish
of my heart.  Why, your little finger is worth more--"
<P>
"Do be sensible for a moment."
<P>
"I was never more sensible in my lie.  I know what I want, and
I'm going to get it.  I want you and the open air.  I want to get
my foot off the paving-stones and my ear away from the telephone.
<P>
I want a little ranch-house in one of the prettiest bits of
country God ever made, and I want to do the chores around that
ranch-house--milk cows, and chop wood, and curry horses, and
plough the ground, and all the rest of it; and I want you there
in the ranch-house with me.  I'm plumb tired of everything else,
and clean wore out.  And I'm sure the luckiest man alive, for
I've got what money can't buy.  I've got you, and thirty millions
couldn't buy you, nor three thousand millions, nor thirty cents-"
<P>
A knock at the door interrupted him, and he was left to stare
delightedly at the Crouched Venus and on around the room at
Dede's dainty possessions, while she answered the telephone.
<P>
"It is Mr. Hegan," she said, on returning.  "He is holding the
line.  He says it is important."
<P>
Daylight shook his head and smiled.
<P>
"Please tell Mr. Hegan to hang up.  I'm done with the office and
I don't want to hear anything about anything."    
<P>
A minute later she was back again.
<P>
"He refuses to hang up.  He told me to tell you that Unwin is in
the office now, waiting to see you, and Harrison, too.  Mr. Hegan
said that Grimshaw and Hodgkins are in trouble.  That it
looks as if they are going to break.  And he said something about
protection."
<P>
It was startling information.  Both Unwin and Harrison
represented big banking corporations, and Daylight knew that if
the house of Grimshaw and Hodgkins went it would precipitate a
number of failures and start a flurry of serious dimensions.  But
Daylight smiled, and shook his head, and mimicked the stereotyped
office tone of voice as he said:--
<P>
"Miss Mason, you will kindly tell Mr. Hegan that there is
nothing doing and to hang up."
<P>
"But you can't do this," she pleaded.
<P>
"Watch me," he grimly answered.
<P>
"Elam!"
<P>
"Say it again'' he cried.  "Say it again, and a dozen Grimshaws
and Hodgkins can smash!"
<P>
He caught her by the hand and drew her to him.
<P>
"You let Hegan hang on to that line till he's tired.  We can't be
wasting a second on him on a day like this.  He's only in love
with books and things, but I've got a real live woman in my arms
that's loving me all the time she's kicking over the traces."
