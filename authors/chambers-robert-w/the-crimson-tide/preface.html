<p><em>FOREWORD</em></p>

<p>An American ambulance going south stopped on the snowy road;
the driver, an American named Estridge, got out; his companion,
a young woman in furs, remained in her seat.</p>

<p>Estridge, with the din of the barrage in his ears, went forward
to show his papers to the soldiers who had stopped him on the
snowy forest road.</p>

<p>His papers identified him and the young woman; and further they
revealed the fact that the ambulance contained only a trunk and
some hand luggage; and called upon all in authority to permit
John Henry Estridge and Miss Palla Dumont to continue without
hindrance the journey therein described.</p>

<p>The soldiers &mdash;Siberian riflemen&mdash;were satisfied and seemed
friendly enough and rather curious to obtain a better look at
this American girl, Miss Dumont, described in the papers submitted
to them as "American companion to Marie, third daughter of Nicholas
Romanoff, ex-Tzar."</p>

<p>An officer came up, examined the papers, shrugged.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said, "if authority is to be given this American
lady to join the Romanoff family, now under detention, it is not
my affair."</p>

<p>But he, also, appeared to be perfectly good natured about the
matter, accepting a cigarette from Estridge and glancing at the
young woman in the ambulance as he lighted it.</p>

<p>"You know," he remarked, "if it would interest you and the young
lady, the Battalion of Death is over yonder in the birch woods."</p>

<p>"The woman's battalion?" asked Estridge.</p>

<p>"Yes. They make their début to-day. Would you like to see them?
They're going forward in a few minutes, I believe."</p>

<p>Estridge nodded and walked back to the ambulance.</p>

<p>"The woman's battalion is over in those birch woods, Miss Dumont.
Would you care to walk over and see them before they leave for
the front trenches?"</p>

<p>The girl in furs said very gravely:</p>

<p>"Yes, I wish to see women who are about to go into battle."</p>

<p>She rose from the seat, laid a fur-gloved hand on his offered
arm, and stepped down onto the snow.</p>

<p>"To serve," she said, as they started together through the silver
birches, following a trodden way, "is not alone the only happiness
in life: it is the only reason for living."</p>

<p>"I know you think so, Miss Dumont."</p>

<p>"You also must believe so, who are here as a volunteer in Russia."</p>

<p>"It's a little more selfish with me. I'm a medical student; it's
a liberal education for me even to drive an ambulance."</p>

<p>"There is only one profession nobler than that practised by the
physician, who serves his fellow men," she said in a low, dreamy
voice.</p>

<p>"Which profession do you place first?"</p>

<p>"The profession of those who serve God alone."</p>

<p>"The priesthood?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And the religious orders."</p>

<p>"Nuns, too?" he demanded with the slightest hint of impatience
in his pleasant voice.</p>

<p>The girl noticed it, looked up at him and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>"Had my dear Grand Duchess not asked for me, I should now he
entering upon my novitiate among the Russian nuns.... And she,
too, I think, had there been no revolution. She was quite ready
a year ago. We talked it over. But the Empress would not permit
it. And then came the trouble about the Deaconesses. That was
a grave mistake&#11834;"</p>

<p>She checked herself, then:</p>

<p>"I do not mean to criticise the Empress, you understand."</p>

<p>"Poor lady," he said, "such gentle criticism would seem praise
to her now."</p>

<p>They were walking through a pine belt, and in the shadows of
that splendid growth the snow remained icy, so that they both
slipped continually and she took his arm for security.</p>

<p>"I somehow had not thought of you, Miss Dumont, as so austerely
inclined," he said.</p>

<p>She smiled: "Because I've been a cheerful companion&mdash;even gay?
Well, my gaiety made my heart sing with the prospect of seeing
again my dearest friend&mdash;my closest spiritual companion&mdash;my darling
little Grand Duchess.... So I have been, naturally enough, good
company on our three days' journey."</p>

<p>He smiled: "I never suspected you of such extreme religious inclinations,"
he insisted.</p>

<p>"Extreme?"</p>

<p>"Well, a novice&#11834;" he hesitated. Then, "And you mean, ultimately,
to take the black veil?"</p>

<p>"Of course. I shall take it some day yet."</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her, and the man in him felt the pity
of it as do all men when such fresh, virginal youth as was Miss
Dumont's turns an enraptured face toward that cloister door which
never again opens on those who enter.</p>

<p>Her arm rested warmly and confidently within his; the cold had
made her cheeks very pink and had crisped the tendrils of her
brown hair under the fur toque.</p>

<p>"If," she said happily, "you have found in me a friend, it is
because my heart is much too small for all the love I bear my
fellow beings."</p>

<p>"That's a quaint thing to say," he said.</p>

<p>"It's really true. I care so deeply, so keenly, for my fellow
beings whom God made, that there seemed only one way to express
it&mdash;to give myself to God and pass my life in His service who
made these fellow creatures all around me that I love."</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said, "that is one way of looking at it."</p>

<p>"It seemed to be the only way for me. I came to it by stages....
And first, as a child, I was impressed by the loveliness of the
world and I used to sit for hours thinking of the goodness of
God. And then other phases came&mdash;socialistic cravings and settlement
work&mdash;but you know that was not enough. My heart was too full
to be satisfied. There was not enough outlet."</p>

<p>"What did you do then?"</p>

<p>"I studied: I didn't know what I wanted, what I needed. I seemed
lost; I was obsessed with a desire to aid&mdash;to be of service. I
thought that perhaps if I travelled and studied methods&#11834;"</p>

<p>She looked straight ahead of her with a sad little reflective
smile:</p>

<p>"I have passed by many strange places in the world.... And then
I saw the little Grand Duchess at the Charity Bazaar.... We seemed
to love each other at first glance.... She asked to have me for
her companion.... They investigated.... And so I went to her."</p>

<p>The girl's face became sombre and she bent her dark eyes on the
snow as they walked.</p>

<p>All the world was humming and throbbing with the thunder of the
Russian guns. Flakes continually dropped from vibrating pine trees.
A pale yellow haze veiled the sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Dumont lifted her head:</p>

<p>"If anything ever happens to part me from my friend," she said,
"I hope I shall die quickly."</p>

<p>"Are you and she so devoted?" he asked gravely.</p>

<p>"Utterly. And if we can not some day take the vows together and
enter the same order and the same convent, then the one who is
free to do so is so pledged.... I do not think that the Empress
will consent to the Grand Duchess Marie taking the veil.... And
so, when she has no further need of me, I shall make my novitiate....
There are soldiers ahead, Mr. Estridge. Is it the woman's battalion?"</p>

<p>He, also, had caught sight of them. He nodded.</p>

<p>"It is the Battalion of Death," he said in a low voice. "Let's
see what they look like."</p>

<p>The girl-soldiers stood about carelessly, there in the snow among
the silver birches and pines. They looked like boys in overcoats
and boots and tall wool caps, leaning at ease there on their heavy
rifles. Some were only fifteen years of age. Some had been servants,
some saleswomen, stenographers, telephone operators, dressmakers,
workers in the fields, students at the university, dancers, laundresses.
And a few had been born into the aristocracy.</p>

<p>They came, too, from all parts of the huge, sprawling Empire,
these girl-soldiers of the Battalion of Death&mdash;and there were
Cossack girls and gypsies among them&mdash;girls from Finland, Courland,
from the Urals, from Moscow, from Siberia&mdash;from North, South,
East, West.</p>

<p>There were Jewesses from the Pale and one Jewess from America
in the ranks; there were Chinese girls, Poles, a child of fifteen
from Trebizond, a Japanese girl, a French peasant lass; and there
were Finns, too, and Scandinavians&mdash;all with clipped hair under
the astrakhan caps&mdash;sturdy, well shaped, soldierly girls who handled
their heavy rifles without effort and carried a regulation equipment
as though it were a sheaf of flowers.</p>

<p>Their commanding officer was a woman of forty. She lounged in
front of the battalion in the snow, consulting with half a dozen
officers of a man's regiment.</p>

<p>The colour guard stood grouped around the battalion colours,
where its white and gold folds swayed languidly in the breeze,
and clots of virgin snow fell upon it, shaken down from the pines
by the cannonade.</p>

<p>Estridge gazed at them in silence. In his man's mind one thought
dominated&mdash;the immense pity of it all. And there was a dreadful
fascination in looking at these girl soldiers, whose soft, warm
flesh was so soon to be mangled by shrapnel and slashed by bayonets.</p>

<p>"Good heavens," he muttered at last under his breath. "Was this
necessary?"</p>

<p>"The men ran," said Miss Dumont.</p>

<p>"It was the filthy boche propaganda that demoralised them," rejoined
Estridge. "I wonder&mdash;<em>are</em> women more level headed? Is
propaganda wasted on these girl soldiers? Are they really superior
to the male of the species?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Miss Dumont softly, "that their spiritual intelligence
is deeper."</p>

<p>"They see more clearly, morally?"</p>

<p>"I don't know.... I think so sometimes.... We women, who are
born capable of motherhood, seem to be fashioned also to realise
Christ more clearly&mdash;and the holy mother who bore him.... I don't
know if that's the reason&mdash;or if, truly, in us a little flame
burns more constantly&mdash;the passion which instinctively flames
more brightly toward things of the spirit than of the flesh....
I think it is true, Mr. Estridge, that, unless taught otherwise
by men, women's inclination is toward the spiritual, and the ardour
of her passion aspires instinctively to a greater love until the
lesser confuses and perplexes her with its clamorous importunity."</p>

<p>"Woman's love for man you call the lesser love?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is, compared to love for God," she said dreamily.</p>

<p>Some of the girl-soldiers in the Battalion of Death turned their
heads to look at this young girl in furs, who had come among them
on the arm of a Red Cross driver.</p>

<p>Estridge was aware of many bib brown eyes, many grey eyes, some
blue ones fixed on him and on his companion in friendly or curious
inquiry. They made him think of the large, innocent eyes of deer
or channel cattle, for there was something both sweet and wild
as well as honest in the gaze of these girl-soldiers.</p>

<p>One, a magnificent blond six-foot creature with the peaches-and-cream
skin of Scandinavia and the clipped gold hair of the northland,
smiled at Miss Dumont, displaying a set of superb teeth.</p>

<p>"You have come to see us make our first charge?" she asked in
Russian, her sea-blue eyes all a-sparkle.</p>

<p>Miss Dumont said "Yes," very seriously, looking at the girl's
equipment, her blanket roll, gas-mask, boots and overcoat.</p>

<p>Estridge turned to another girl-soldier:</p>

<p>"And if you are made a prisoner?" he enquired in a low voice.
"Have you women considered that?"</p>

<p>"Nechevo," smiled the girl, who had been a Red Cross nurse, and
who wore two decorations. She touched the red and black dashes
of colour on her sleeve significantly, then loosened her tunic
and drew out a tiny bag of chamois. "We all carry poison," she
said smilingly. "We know the boche well enough to take that precaution."</p>

<p>Another girl nodded confirmation. They were perfectly cheerful
about it. Several others drew near and showed their little bags
of poison slung around their necks inside their blouses. Many
of them wore holy relics and medals also.</p>

<p>Miss Dumont took Estridge's arm again and looked over at the
big blond girl-soldier, who also had been smilingly regarding
her, and who now stepped forward to meet them halfway.</p>

<p>"When do you march to the first trenches?" asked Miss Dumont
gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the blond goddess, "so you are English?" And she added
in English: "I am Swedish. You have arrived just in time. I t'ink
we go forward immediately."</p>

<p>"God go with you, for Russia," said Miss Dumont in a clear, controlled
voice.</p>

<p>But Estridge saw that her dark eyes were suddenly brilliant with
tears. The big blond girl-soldier saw it, too, and her splendid
blue eyes widened. Then, somehow, she had stepped forward and
taken Miss Dumont in her strong arms; and, holding her, smiled
and gazed intently at her.</p>

<p>"You must not grieve for us," she said. "We are not afraid. We
are happy to go."</p>

<p>"I know," said Palla Dumont; and took the girl-soldier's hands
in hers. "What is your name?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ilse Westgard. And yours?"</p>

<p>"Palla Dumont."</p>

<p>"English? No?"</p>

<p>"American."</p>

<p>"Ah! One of our dear Americans! Well, then, you shall tell your
countrymen that you have seen many women of many lands fighting
rifle in hand, so that the boche shall not strangle freedom in
Russia. Will you tell them, Palla?"</p>

<p>"If I ever return."</p>

<p>"You shall return. I, also, shall go to America. I shall seek
for you there, pretty comrade. We shall become friends. Already
I love you very dearly."</p>

<p>She kissed Palla Dumont on both cheeks, holding her hands tightly.</p>

<p>"Tell me," she said, "why you are in Russia, and where you are
now journeying?"</p>

<p>Palla looked at her steadily: "I am the American companion to
the Grand Duchess Marie; and I am journeying to the village where
the Imperial family is detained, because she has obtained permission
for me to rejoin her."</p>

<p>There was a short silence; the blue eyes of the Swedish girl
had become frosty as two midwinter stars. Suddenly they glimmered
warm again as twin violets:</p>

<p>"Kharasho!" she said smiling. "And do you love your little comrade
duchess?"</p>

<p>"Next only to God."</p>

<p>"That is very beautiful, Palla. She is a child to be enlightened.
Teach her the greater truth."</p>

<p>"She has learned it, Ilse."</p>

<p>"<em>She</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And, if God wills it, she, and I also, take the vows some
day."</p>

<p>"The veil!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You! A nun!"</p>

<p>"If God accepts me."</p>

<p>The Swedish girl-soldier stood gazing upon her as though fascinated,
crushing Palla's slim hands between her own.</p>

<p>Presently she shook her head with a wearied smile:</p>

<p>"That," she said, "is one thing I can not understand&mdash;the veil.
No. I can understand <em>this</em>&#11834;" turning her head and glancing
proudly around her at her girl comrades. "I can comprehend this
thing that I am doing. But not what you wish to do, Palla. Not
such service as you offer."</p>

<p>"I wish to serve the source of all good. My heart is too full
to be satisfied by serving mankind alone."</p>

<p>The girl-soldier shook her head: "I try to understand. I can
not. I am sorry, because I love you."</p>

<p>"I love you, Ilse. I love my fellows."</p>

<p>After another silence:</p>

<p>"You go to the imperial family?" demanded Ilse abruptly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I wish to see you again. I shall try."</p>

<p>The battalion marched a few moments later.</p>

<p>It was rather a bad business. They went over the top with a cheer.
Fifty answered roll call that night.</p>

<p>However, the hun had learned one thing&mdash;that women soldiers were
inferior to none.</p>

<p>Russia learned it, too. Everywhere battalions were raised, uniformed,
armed, equipped, drilled. In the streets of cities the girl-soldiers
became familiar sights: nobody any longer turned to stare at them.
There were several dozen girls in the officers' school, trying
for commissions. In all the larger cities there were infantry
battalions of girls, Cossack troops, machine gun units, signallers;
they had a medical corps and transport service.</p>

<p>But never but once again did they go into action. And their last
stand was made facing their own people, the brain-crazed Reds.</p>

<p>And after that the Battalion of Death became only a name; and
the girl-soldiers bewildered fugitives, hunted down by the traitors
who had sold out to the Germans at Brest-Litovsk.</p>

<p><em>PREFACE</em></p>

<p>A door opened; the rush of foggy air set the flames of the altar
candles blowing wildly. There came the clank of armed men.</p>

<p>Then, in the dim light of the chapel, a novice sprang to her
feet, brushing the white veil from her pallid young face.</p>

<p>At that the ex-Empress, still kneeling, lifted her head from
her devotions and calmly turned it, looking around over her right
shoulder.</p>

<p>The file of Red infantry advanced, shuffling slowly forward as
though feeling their way through the candle-lit dusk across the
stone floor. Their accoutrements clattered and clinked in the
intense stillness. A slovenly officer, switching a thin, naked
sword in his ungloved fist, led them. Another officer, carrying
a sabre and marching in the rear, halted to slam and lock the
heavy chapel door; then he ran forward to rejoin his men, while
the chapel still reverberated with the echoes of the clanging
door.</p>

<p>A chair or two fell, pushed aside by the leading soldiers and
hastily kicked out of the way as the others advanced more swiftly
now. For there seemed to be some haste. These men were plainly
in a hurry, whatever their business there might be.</p>

<p>The Tzesarevitch, kneeling beside his mother, got up from his
knees with visible difficulty. The Empress also rose, leisurely,
supporting herself by one hand resting on the prie-dieu.</p>

<p>Then several young girls, who had been kneeling behind her at
their devotions, stood up and turned to stare at the oncoming
armed men, now surrounding them.</p>

<p>The officer carrying the naked sword, and reeking with fumes
of brandy, counted these women in a loud, thick voice.</p>

<p>"That's right," he said. "You're all present&mdash;one! two! three!
four! five! six!&mdash;the whole accursed brood!" pointing waveringly
with his sword from one to another.</p>

<p>Then he laughed stupidly, leering out of his inflamed eyes at
the five women who all wore the garbs of the Sisters of Mercy,
their white coiffes and tabliers contrasting sharply with the
sombre habits of the Russian nuns who had gathered in the candle-lit
dusk behind them.</p>

<p>"What do you wish?" demanded the ex-Empress in a fairly steady
voice.</p>

<p>"Answer to your names!" retorted the officer brutally. The other
officer came up and began to fumble for a note book in the breast
of his dirty tunic. When he found it he licked the lead of his
pencil and squinted at the ex-Empress out of drunken eyes.</p>

<p>"Alexandra Feodorovna!" he barked in her face. "If you're here,
say so!"</p>

<p>She remained calm, mute, cold as ice.</p>

<p>A soldier behind her suddenly began to shout:</p>

<p>"That's the German woman. That's the friend of the Staretz Novykh!
That's Sascha! Now we've got her, the thing to do is to shoot
her&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mark her present," interrupted the officer in command. "No ceremony,
now. Mark the cub Romanoff present. Mark 'em all &mdash;Olga,
Tatyana, Marie, Anastasia!&mdash;no matter which is which&mdash;they're
all Romanoffs&#11834;"</p>

<p>But the same soldier who had interrupted before bawled out again:
"They're not Romanoffs! There are no German Romanoffs. There are
no Romanoffs in Russia since a hundred and fifty years&#11834;"</p>

<p>The little Tzesarevitch, Alexis, red with anger, stepped forward
to confront the man, his frail hands fiercely clenched. The officer
in command struck him brutally across the breast with the flat
of his sword, shoved him aside, strode toward the low door of
the chapel crypt and jerked it open.</p>

<p>"Line them up!" he bawled. "We'll settle this Romanoff dispute
once for all! Shove them into line! Hurry up, there!"</p>

<p>But there seemed to be some confusion between the nuns and the
soldiers, as the latter attempted to separate the ex-Empress and
the young Grand Duchesses from the sisters.</p>

<p>"What's all that trouble about!" cried the officer commanding.
"Drive back those nuns, I tell you! They're Germans, too! They're
Sascha's new Deaconesses! Kick 'em out of the way!"</p>

<p>Then the novice, who had cried out in fear when the Red infantry
first entered the chapel, forced her way out into the file formed
by the Empress and her daughters.</p>

<p>"There's a frightful mistake!" she cried, laying one hand on
the arm of a young girl dressed, like the others, as a Sister
of Mercy. "This woman is Miss Dumont, my American companion! Release
her! =I= am the Grand Duchess Marie!"</p>

<p>The girl, whose arm had been seized, looked at the young novice
over her shoulder in a dazed way; then, suddenly her lovely face
flushed scarlet; tears sprang to her eyes; and she said to the
infuriated officer:</p>

<p>"It is not true, Captain! I am the Grand Duchess Marie. She is
trying to save me!"</p>

<p>"What the devil is all this row!" roared the officer, who now
came tramping and storming among the prisoners, switching his
sword to and fro with ferocious impatience.</p>

<p>The little Sister of Mercy, frightened but resolute, pointed
at the novice, who still clutched her by the arm: "It is not true
what she tells you," she repeated. "I am the Grand Duchess Marie,
and this novice is my American companion, Miss Dumont, who loves
me devotedly and who now attempts to sacrifice herself in my place&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I <em>am</em> the Grand Duchess Marie!" interrupted the novice
excitedly. "This young girl dressed like a Sister of Mercy is
only my American companion&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Damnation!" yelled the officer. "I'll take you both, then!"
But the girl in the Sister of Mercy's garb turned and violently
pushed the novice from her so that she stumbled and fell on her
knees among the nuns.</p>

<p>Then, confronting the officer: "You Bolshevik dog," she said
contemptuously, "don't you even know the daughter of your dead
Emperor when you see her!" And she struck him across the face
with her prayer book.</p>

<p>As he recoiled from the blow a soldier shouted: "There's your
proof! There's your insolent Romanoff for you! To hell with the
whole litter! Shoot them!" Instantly a savage roar from the Reds
filled that dim place; a soldier violently pushed the young Tzesarevitch
into the file behind the Empress and held him there; the Grand
Duchess Olga was flung bodily after him; the other children, in
their hospital dresses, were shoved brutally toward their places,
menaced by butt and bayonet.</p>

<p>"March!" bawled the officer in command.</p>

<p>But now, among the dark-garbed nuns, a slender white figure was
struggling frantically to free herself:</p>

<p>"You red dogs!" she cried in an agonised voice. "Let that English
woman go! It is I you want! Do you hear! I mock at you! I mock
at your resolution! Boje Tzaria Khrani! Down with the Bolsheviki!"</p>

<p>A soldier turned and fired at her; the bullet smashed an ikon
above her head.</p>

<p>"I am the Grand Duchess Marie!" she sobbed. "I demand my place!
I demand my fate! Let that American girl go! Do you hear what
I say? Red beasts! Red beasts! I am the Grand Duchess!&#11834;"</p>

<p>The officer who closed the file turned savagely and shook his
heavy cavalry sabre at her: "I'll come back in a moment and cut
your throat for you!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Then, in the file, and just as the last bayonets were vanishing
through the crypt door, one of the young girls turned and kissed
her hand to the sobbing novice&mdash;a pretty gesture, tender, gay,
not tragic, even almost mischievously triumphant.</p>

<p>It was the adieu of the Grand Duchess Tatyana to the living world&mdash;her
last glimpse of it through the flames of the altar candles gilding
the dead Christ on his jewelled cross&mdash;the image of that Christ
she was so soon to gaze upon when those lovely, mischievous young
eyes of hers unclosed in Paradise....</p>

<p>The door of the crypt slammed. A terrible silence reigned in
the chapel.</p>

<p>Then the novice uttered a cry, caught the foot of the cross with
desperate hands, hung there convulsively.</p>

<p>To her the Mother Superior turned, weeping. But at her touch
the girl, crazed with grief, lifted both hands and tore from her
own face the veil of her novitiate just begun;&mdash;tore her white
garments from her shoulders, crying out in a strangled voice that
if a Christian God let such things happen then He was no God of
hers&mdash;that she would never enter His service&mdash;that the Lord Christ
was no bridegroom for her; and, her novitiate was ended&mdash;ended
together with every vow of chastity, of humility, of poverty,
of even common humanity which she had ever hoped to take.</p>

<p>The girl was now utterly beside herself; at one moment flaming
and storming with fury among the terrified, huddling nuns; the
next instant weeping, stamping her felt-shod foot in ungovernable
revolt at this horror which any God in any heaven could permit.</p>

<p>And again and again she called out on Christ to stop this thing
and prove Himself a real God to a pagan world that mocked Him.</p>

<p>Dishevelled, her rent veil in tatters on her naked shoulders,
she sprang across the chapel to the crypt door, shook it, tore
at it, seized chair after chair and shattered them to splinters
against the solid panels of oak and iron.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly motionless, she crouched and listened.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mother of God!" she panted, "intervene now&mdash;<em>now</em>!&mdash;or
never!"</p>

<p>The muffled rattle of a rather ragged volley answered her prayer.</p>

<p>Outside the convent a sentry&mdash;a Kronstadt sailor&mdash;stood. He also
heard the underground racket. He nodded contentedly to himself.
Other shots followed&mdash;pistol shots&mdash;singly.</p>

<p>After a few moments a wisp of smoke from the crypt crept lazily
out of the low oubliettes. The day was grey and misty; rain threatened;
and the rifle smoke clung low to the withered grass, scarcely
lifting.</p>

<p>The sentry lighted a third cigarette, one eye on the barred oubliettes,
from which the smoke crawled and spread out over the grass.</p>

<p>After a while a sweating face appeared behind the bars and a
half-stifled voice demanded why there was any delay about fetching
quick-lime. And, still clinging to the bars with bloody fingers,
he added:</p>

<p>"There's a damned novice in the chapel. I promised to cut her
throat for her. Go in and get her and bring her down here."</p>

<p>They searched the convent thoroughly; they went out into the
garden and beat the shrubbery, kicking through bushes and saplings,
their cocked rifles poised for a snap shot.</p>

<p>Peasants, gathering there more thickly now, watched them stupidly;
the throng increased in the convent grounds. Some Bolshevik soldiers
pushed through the rapidly growing crowd and ran toward a birch
wood east of the convent. Beyond the silvery fringe of birches,
larger trees of a heavy, hard-wood forest loomed. Among these
splendid trees a number of beeches were being felled on both sides
of the road.</p>

<p>"Did you see a White Nun run this way?" demanded the soldiers
of the wood-cutters. The latter shook their heads:</p>

<p>"Nothing has passed," they said seriously, "except some Ural
Cossacks riding north like lost souls in a hurricane."</p>

<p>An officer of the Red battalion, who had now hastened up with
pistol swinging, flew into a frightful rage:</p>

<p>"Cossacks!" he bellowed. "You cowardly dogs, what do you mean
by letting Kaledines' horsemen gallop over you like that&mdash;you
with your saws and axes&mdash;twenty lusty comrades to block the road
and pull the Imperialists off their horses! Shame! For all I know
you've let a Romanoff escape alive into the world! That's probably
what you've done, you greasy louts!"</p>

<p>The wood-cutters gaped stupidly; the Bolshevik officer cursed
them again and gesticulated with his pistol. Other soldiers of
the Red battalion ran up. One nudged the officer's elbow without
saluting:</p>

<p>"That other prisoner can't be found&#11834;"</p>

<p>"What! That Swedish girl!" yelled the officer.</p>

<p>Several soldiers began speaking excitedly:</p>

<p>"While we were in the cellar, they say she ran away&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain, while we were about that business in the crypt,
Kaledines' horsemen rode up outside&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Who saw them?" demanded the officer hoarsely. "God curse you,
who saw them?"</p>

<p>Some peasants had now come up. One of them began:</p>

<p>"Your <em>honour</em>, I saw Prince Kaledines' riders&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Whose!</em>"</p>

<p>"The Hetman's&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Your <em>honour</em>! <em>Prince</em> Kaledines! The Hetman!
Damnation! Who do you think you are! Who do you think I am!" burst
out the Red officer in a fury. "Get out of my way!&#11834;" He pushed
the peasants right and left and strode away toward the convent.
His soldiers began to straggle after him. One of them winked at
the wood-cutters with his tongue in his cheek, and slung the rifle
he carried over his right shoulder <em>en bandoulière</em>, muzzle
downward.</p>

<p>"The Tavarish is in a temper," he said with a jerk of his thumb
toward the officer. "We arrested that Swedish girl in the uniform
of the woman's battalion. One shoots that breed on sight, you
know. But we were in such a hurry to finish with the Romanoffs&#11834;"
He shrugged: "You see, comrades, we should have taken her into
the crypt and shot her along with the Romanoffs. That's how one
loses these birds&mdash;they're off if you turn your back to light
a cigarette in the wind."</p>

<p>One of the wood-cutters said: "Among Kaledines' horsemen were
two women. One was crop-headed like a boy, and half naked."</p>

<p>"A White Nun?"</p>

<p>"God knows. She had some white rags hanging to her body, and
dark hair clipped like a boy's."</p>

<p>"That&mdash;was&mdash;she!" said the soldier with slow conviction. He turned
and looked down the long perspective of the forest road. Only
a raven stalked there all alone over the fallen leaves.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said, "that was our White Nun. The Cossacks took
her with them. They must have ridden fast, the horsemen of Kaledines."</p>

<p>"Like a swift storm. Like the souls of the damned," replied a
peasant.</p>

<p>The soldier shrugged: "If there's still a Romanoff loose in the
world, God save the world!... And that big heifer of a Swedish
wench!&mdash;she was a bad one, I tell you! &mdash;Took six of us to
catch her and ten to hold her by her ten fingers and toes! Hey!
God bless me, but she stands six feet and is made of steel cased
in silk&mdash;all white, smooth and iron-hard&mdash;the blond young snow-tiger
that she is!&mdash;the yellow-haired, six-foot, slippery beastess!
God bless me &mdash;God bless me!" he muttered, staring down the
wood-road to its vanishing point against the grey horizon.</p>

<p>Then he hitched his slung rifle to a more comfortable position,
turned, gazed at the convent across the fields, which his distant
comrades were now approaching.</p>

<p>"A German nest," he said aloud to himself, "full of their damned
Deaconesses! Hey! I'll be going along to see what's to be done
with them, also!"</p>

<p>He nodded to the wood-cutters:</p>

<p>"Vermin-killing time," he remarked cheerily. "After the dirty
work is done, peace, land enough for everybody, ease and plenty
and a full glass always at one's elbows&mdash;eh, comrades?"</p>

<p>He strode away across the fields.</p>

<p>It had begun to snow.</p>

<p><em>ARGUMENT</em></p>

<p>The Cossacks sang as they rode:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
I

</p>
<p>
"Life is against us<br/>
We are born crying:<br/>
Life that commenced us<br/>
Leaves us all dying.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were born crying;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We shall die sighing.

</p>
<p>
"Shall we sit idle?<br/>
Follow Death's dance!<br/>
Pick up your bridle,<br/>
Saddle and lance!<br/>
Cossacks, advance!"

</p>
</div>
<p>They were from the Urals: they sat their shaggy little grey horses,
lance in hand, stirrup deep in saddle paraphernalia&mdash;kit-bags,
tents, blankets, trusses of straw, a dead fowl or two or a quarter
of beef. And from every saddle dangled a balalaika and the terrible
Cossack whip.</p>

<p>The steel of their lances flashed red in the setting sun; snow
whirled before the wind in blinding pinkish clouds, powdering
horse and rider from head to heel.</p>

<p>Again one rider unslung his balalaika, struck it, looking skyward
as he rode:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Stars in your courses,<br/>
This is our answer;<br/>
Women and horses,<br/>
Singer and dancer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fall to the lancer!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is your answer!

</p>
<p>
"Though the Dark Raider<br/>
Rob us of joy&#11834;<br/>
Death, the Invader,<br/>
Come to destroy&#11834;<br/>

</p>
</div>
<p>They rode into a forest, slowly, filing among the silver birches,
then trotting out amid the pines.</p>

<p>The Swedish girl towered in her saddle, dwarfing the shaggy pony.
She wore her grey wool cap, overcoat, and boots. Pistols bulged
in the saddle holsters; sacks of grain and a bag of camp tins
lay across pommel and cantle.</p>

<p>Beside her rode the novice, swathed to the eyes in a sheepskin
greatcoat, and a fur cap sheltering her shorn head.</p>

<p>Her lethargy&mdash;a week's reaction from the horrors of the convent&mdash;had
vanished; and a feverish, restless alertness had taken its place.</p>

<p>Nothing of the still, white novice was visible now in her brilliant
eyes and flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>Her tragic silence had given place to an unnatural loquacity;
her grief to easily aroused mirth; and the dark sorrow in her
haunted eyes was gone, and they grew brown and sunny and vivacious.</p>

<p>She talked freely with her comrade, Ilse Westgard; she exchanged
gossip and banter with the Cossacks, argued with them, laughed
with them, sang with them.</p>

<p>At night she slept in her sheepskin in Ilse Westgard's vigorous
arms; morning, noon and evening she filled the samovar with snow
beside Cossack fires, or in the rare cantonments afforded in wretched
villages, where whiskered and filthy mujiks cringed to the Cossacks,
whispering to one another: "There is no end to death; there is
no end to the fighting and the dying, God bless us all. There
is no end."</p>

<p>In the glare of great fires in muddy streets she stood, swathed
in her greatcoat, her cap pushed back, looking like some beautiful,
impudent boy, while the Cossacks sang "Lada oy Lada!"&mdash;and let
their slanting eyes wander sideways toward her, till her frank
laughter set the singers grinning and the <em>gusli</em> was laid
aside.</p>

<p>And once, after a swift gallop to cross a railroad and an exchange
of shots with the Red guards at long range, the sotnia of the
Wild Division rode at evening into a little hamlet of one short,
miserable street, and shouted for a fire that could be seen as
far as Moscow.</p>

<p>That night they discovered vodka&mdash;not much&mdash;enough to set them
singing first, then dancing. The troopers danced together in the
fire-glare&mdash;clumsily, in their boots, with interims of the <em>pas
seul</em> savouring of the capers of those ancient Mongol horsemen
in the <em>Hezars</em> of Genghis Khan.</p>

<p>But no dancing, no singing, no clumsy capers were enough to satisfy
these riders of the Wild Division, now made boisterous by vodka
and horse-meat. Gossip crackled in every group; jests flew; they
shouted at the peasants; they roared at their own jokes.</p>

<p>"Comrade novice! &mdash;Pretty boy with a shorn head!" they bawled.
"Harangue us once more on law and love."</p>

<p>She stood with legs apart and thumbs hooked in her belt, laughing
at them across the fire. And all around crowded the wretched <em>mujiks</em>,
peering at her through shaggy hair, out of little wolfish eyes.</p>

<p>A Cossack shouted: "My law first! Land for all! That is what
we have, we Cossacks! Land for the people, one and all&mdash;land for
the <em>mujik</em>; land for the bourgeois; land for the aristocrat!
That law solves all, clears all questions, satisfies all. It is
the Law of Peace!"</p>

<p>A Cossack shoved a soldier-deserter forward into the firelight.
He wore a patch of red on his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Answer, comrade! Is that the true law? Or have you and your
comrades made a better one in Petrograd?"</p>

<p>The deserter, a little frightened, tried to grin: "A good law
is, kill all generals," he said huskily. "Afterward we shall have
peace."</p>

<p>A roar of laughter greeted him; these dark, thickset Cossacks
with slanting eyes were from the Urals. What did they care how
many generals were killed? Besides, their hetman had already killed
himself.</p>

<p>Their officer moved out into the firelight&mdash;a reckless rider
but a dull brain&mdash;and stood lashing at his snow-crusted boots
with the silver-mounted quirt.</p>

<p>"Like gendarmes," he said, "we Cossacks are forever doing the
dirty work of other people. Why? It begins to sicken me. Why are
we forever executing the law! What law? Who made it? The Tzar.
And he is dead, and what is the good of the law he made?</p>

<p>"Why should free Cossacks be policemen any more when there is
no law?</p>

<p>"We played gendarme for the Monarchists. We answered the distress
call of the Cadets and the bourgeoisie! Where are they? Where
is the law they made?"</p>

<p>He stood switching his dirty boots and swinging his heavy head
right and left with the stupid, lowering menace of a bull.</p>

<p>"Then came the Mensheviki with their law," he bellowed suddenly.
"Again we became policemen, galloping to their whistle. Where
are they? Where is their law?"</p>

<p>He spat on the snow, twirled his quirt.</p>

<p>"There is only one law to govern the land," he roared. "It is
the law of hands off and mind your business! It's a good law."</p>

<p>"A good law for those who already have something," cried a high,
thin voice from the throng of peasants.</p>

<p>The Cossacks, who all possessed their portion of land, yelled
with laughter. One of them called out to the Swedish girl for
her opinion, and the fair young giantess strode gracefully out
into the fire-ring, her cap in her hand and the thick blond ringlets
shining like gold on her beautiful head.</p>

<p>"Listen! Listen to this soldier of the Death Battalion!" shouted
the Cossacks in great glee. "She will tell us what the law should
be!"</p>

<p>She laughed: "We fought for it&mdash;we women soldiers," she said.
"And the law we fought for was made when the first tyrant fell.</p>

<p>"This is the law: Freedom of mind; liberty of choice; an equal
chance for all; no violence; only orderly debate to determine
the will of the land."</p>

<p>A Cossack said loudly: "<em>Da volna!</em> Those who have nothing
would take, then, from those who have!"</p>

<p>"I think not!" cried another,"&mdash;not in the Urals!"</p>

<p>Thunderous laughter from their comrades and cries of, "Palla!
Let us hear our pretty boy, who has made for the whole world a
law."</p>

<p>Palla Dumont, her slender hands thrust deep in her great coat
sleeves, and standing like a nun lost in mystic revery, looked
up with gay audacity&mdash;not like a nun at all, now, save for the
virginal allure that seemed a part of the girl.</p>

<p>"There is only one law, Tavarishi," she said, turning slightly
from her hips as she spoke, to include those behind her in the
circle: "and that law was not made by man. That law was born,
already made, when the first man was born. It has never changed.
It comprehends everything; includes everything and everybody;
it solves all perplexity, clears all doubts, decides all questions.</p>

<p>"It is a living law; it exists; it is the key to every problem;
and it is all ready for you."</p>

<p>The girl's face had altered; the half mischievous audacity in
defiance of her situation&mdash;the gay, impudent confidence in herself
and in these wild comrades of hers, had given place to something
more serious, more ardent&mdash;the youthful intensity that smiles
through the flaming enchantment of suddenly discovered knowledge.</p>

<p>"It is the oldest of all laws," she said. "It was born perfect.
It is yours if you accept it. And this law is the Law of Love."</p>

<p>A peasant muttered: "One gives where one loves."</p>

<p>The girl turned swiftly: "That is the soul of the Law!" she cried,
"to give! Is there any other happiness, Tavarishi? Is there any
other peace? Is there need of any other law?</p>

<p>"I tell you that the Law of Love slays greed! And when greed
dies, war dies. And hunger, and misery die, too!</p>

<p>"Of what use is any government and its lesser laws and customs,
unless it is itself governed by that paramount Law?</p>

<p>"Of what avail are your religions, your churches, your priests,
your saints, relics, ikons&mdash;all your candles and observances&mdash;unless
dominated by that Law?</p>

<p>"Of what use is your God unless that Law of Love also governs
Him?"</p>

<p>She stood gazing at the firelit faces, the virginal half-smile
on her lips.</p>

<p>A peasant broke the silence: "Is she a new saint, then?" he said
distinctly.</p>

<p>A Cossack nodded to her, grinning respectfully:</p>

<p>"We always like your sermons, little novice," he said. And, to
the others: "Nobody wishes to deny what she says is quite true"&mdash;he
scratched his head, still grinning&mdash;"only&mdash;while there are Kurds
in the world&#11834;"</p>

<p>"And Bolsheviki!" shouted another.</p>

<p>"True! And Turks! God bless us, Tavarishi," he added with a wry
face, "it takes a stronger stomach to love these beasts than is
mine&#11834;"</p>

<p>In the sudden shout of laughter the girl, Palla, looked around
at her comrade, Ilse.</p>

<p>"Until each accepts the Law of Love," said the Swedish girl-soldier,
laughing, "it can not be a law."</p>

<p>"I have accepted it," said Palla gaily; but her childishly lovely
mouth was working, and she clenched her hands in her sleeves to
control the tremor.</p>

<p>Silent, the smile still stamped on her tremulous lips, she stood
for a few moments, fighting back the deep emotions enveloping
her in surging fire&mdash;the same ardent and mystic emotions which
once had consumed her at the altar's foot, where she had knelt,
a novice, dreaming of beatitudes ineffable.</p>

<p>If that vision, for her, was ended&mdash;its substance but the shadow
of a dream&mdash;the passion that created it, the fire that purified
it, the ardent heart that needed love&mdash;love sacred, love unalloyed&mdash;needed
love still, burned for it, yearning to give.</p>

<p>As she lifted her head and looked around her with dark eyes still
a little dazed, there was a sudden commotion among the <em>mujiks</em>;
a Cossack called out something in a sharp voice; their officer
walked hastily out into the darkness; a shadowy rider spurred
ahead of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly a far voice shouted: "Who goes there! <em>Stoi!</em>"</p>

<p>Then red flashes came out of the night; Cossacks ran for their
horses; Ilse appeared with Palla's pony as well as her own, and
halted to listen, the fearless smile playing over her face.</p>

<p>"Mount!" cried many voices at once. "The Reds!"</p>

<p>Palla flung herself astride her saddle; Ilse galloped beside
her, freeing her pistols; everywhere in the starlight the riders
of the Wild Division came galloping, loosening their long lances
as they checked their horses in close formation.</p>

<p>Then, with scarcely a sound in the unbroken snow, they filed
away eastward at a gentle trot, under the pale lustre of the stars.</p>
