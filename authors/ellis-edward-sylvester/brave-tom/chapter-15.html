<p>Jim Travers, as he lay in his hammock, overheard every word which
the two men had said, and considerable more to the same effect.</p>

<p>Unusually bright and mentally strong as he was, he comprehended
it all, and read the scheme as if in a printed book.</p>

<p>Hornblower, seeing him making his way along the wharf in New
York, had formed the plan of abducting him, and then securing
a large reward from the parents or guardian for his return. Accordingly
he stole and placed him in charge of his gang on the schooner,
and then began negotiations with the guardians for his return.</p>

<p>Here a strange combination of circumstances came about.</p>

<p>One of the most pathetic facts that came to light regarding the
abduction of Charley Ross, was the great number of other children
that have been found who had been lost for months and years.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that a regularly organized system of child-stealing
prevails in this country, and there are at this hour hundreds
of mothers and fathers separated from their beloved offspring
through the deviltry of these kidnappers.</p>

<p>Hornblower must have supposed, from the appearance of Jim Travers,
that he was the son of well-to-do parents, who would "come down"
handsomely for his return. The extraordinary part of the business
was, that, on the morning succeeding Jim's abduction, there appeared
in the papers an account of the disappearance of a boy from Philadelphia,
with the promise of a liberal reward for any information that
would lead to his return. This account did not correspond entirely
with the circumstances under which Jim was taken, but the main
facts were such that Hornblower was satisfied he had the right
lad in his keeping.</p>

<p>When Hornblower questioned Jim so closely in the cabin and took
down his replies, he had not a particle of doubt that the boy
was telling him a tissue of falsehoods from beginning to end.
Toward the close of the examination, however, it began to dawn
on the abductor that possibly he had made an error. Be that as
it might, he was none the less convinced that he had a bonanza
in his hands, and one which could be made to serve him as well
as the original himself.</p>

<p>His captive corresponded so closely to the one advertised that
he could be made to pass muster as such, and the reward secured.
This, it would seem, was almost an impossible task, but Hornblower
was confident of success.</p>

<p>This explanation will serve to show why he took the precautions
which had excited the impatience of his confederate, Bob.</p>

<p>Jim Travers did not know all this, but he easily understood from
the conversation of the two conspirators that he had been stolen
for the sake of making money out of his return.</p>

<p>"What a great mistake they have made," he thought; "there isn't
any one in the wide world that would give three cents to have
me returned."</p>

<p>He concluded to stay quietly on board the schooner and let matters
take their course, as it did not occur to him that any personal
danger might arise from future complications. Could he have dreamed
of what was coming, he would have jumped overboard and risked
drowning in his attempt to reach land.</p>

<p>Jim had learned enough from the conversation in the cabin to
keep him awake until midnight. It was near morning when he dropped
off into slumber, which was not broken until the forenoon of the
succeeding day was half gone.</p>

<p>When he went on deck, he saw that the schooner was far below
the city, and standing straight toward the ocean. The weather
was again cold, so he kept within the cabin most of the time.</p>

<p>That night the negro Sam complained of feeling unwell, and threw
his massive form into his hammock, in the hope of becoming better
after a short rest. His sickness was not of a serious nature;
but when such a big man falls ill there is a great deal of it,
and the African instantly formed the belief that he was going
to die, certain sure.</p>

<p>He groaned, and cried, until Jim himself became frightened, and
went on deck to ask the others to look after him. They replied
that there was nothing the matter with Sam, and that he would
soon come around all right.</p>

<p>Jim did his best to relieve the negro, giving him the few simple
remedies at hand, in the hope that he would drop off to sleep.
Sure enough, in the course of half an hour Sam did fall asleep,
and when he awoke, an hour later, was well; and, fully appreciating
Jim's kind attentions, said to him, leaning on his enormous elbow
in the hammock,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tell you what, sonny, yous been mighty kind to me, and <em>I'll
remember you</em>, dat's what I'll do."</p>

<p>"You would have done the same for me, Sam."</p>

<p>"S'pose I would; but dar ain't many dat would hab done it for
me, and I <em>won't forget you</em>. But wasn't I 'bout de sickest
coon dat you eber seen?"</p>

<p>"You seemed to feel very bad," replied Jim.</p>

<p>"Feel bad? you'd better beleib I did! Do you know what de matter
wid me?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I had de Norf American cholera; dat's worse dan de African.
I also had the pneumonia, and de bronchitis, and de measles, and
de small-pox, and the cholly-wampus&mdash;all at the same time. Do
you wonder dat I groaned?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't think you could groan at all, if you had so many
diseases as that."</p>

<p>"Dar's war my toughness and wrastling powers show themselves.
I just wrastled and wrastled, and I frowed 'em all."</p>

<p>Sam swung his huge legs out of the hammock, took a seat near
Jim, and, reaching out, he gently closed his immense fist around
the little white hand of the boy. Then leaning forward until his
black face, as broad as the moon, was almost against Jim's, he
whispered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yous been mighty kind to me, sonny, and, as I obsarved befor',
I ain't de one to forget it. Now, don't you disremember what I
toles you. You tink it's all nice and pleasant here on de boat,
and so it am jis' now, but dar's <em>breakers ahead!</em> Dat
boss ob mine am one ob de biggest debbils dat am runnin' loose.
Ef I should tell yous all dat I know 'bout him, your hair would
rose up and stick frough de roof wid horror. Can you swim, sonny?"</p>

<p>"I am a good swimmer."</p>

<p>"Berry well; I'm mighty glad to hear dat; it's likely dat you'll
hab to swim for your life one ob dese days. Don't roll your eyes
so &mdash;I don't mean dat we's going to be wracked. But what
I want to say am dat you must keep mum, and don't let on dat you
don't know nuffin. Don't act as though you and me was much friends
when de rest am 'bout, but you know dat I'm jis' de best one dat
you'll eber find."</p>

<p>"I understand all that," said Jim, who saw that the plan was
only a simple precaution against drawing suspicion to them; "but
I had no thought that any one would want to hurt me."</p>

<p>"Yous young, and don't understand dem tings like us better eddycated
gem'man. Old Hornblower am trying to sell you; and if he can't
do it, and tinks dat de ossifers am coming down on him, why he'll
jis' chuck you oberboard and dar'll be de end ob it. You see,
yous a purty big boy to steal, and if he lets you go, he'll be
likely to hear from you again."</p>

<p>Jim thanked his new friend from the bottom of his heart, and
asked him what was the best thing to do.</p>

<p>"<em>Run away!</em>" was the emphatic reply.</p>

<p>"But I don't get any chance when they're close to shore. I am
watched all the while, and they are so far off at other times
that I hardly dare try it."</p>

<p>"I'll tell yous what to do; jis' wait till I lets you know dat
de time am come."</p>

<p>Jim agreed to this, and the African shortly after went on deck,
while the boy turned in for the night.</p>

<p>From this time forth the captive lost his reckoning altogether,
and could form no definite idea of the part of the world in which
they were cruising. He supposed they were somewhere along the
Virginia or North Carolina coast. At intervals of a day or two
they ran in within sight of some town, and the sailor known as
Bob went ashore in the boat.</p>

<p>On these occasions there could be no doubt that he met Hornblower,
and that the schooner was playing her part in a drama which was
likely to end in a tragedy.</p>

<p>Fortified by the presence of such a friend as the negro Sam,
Jim determined to write a note to Tom, telling him what had happened,
and promising to return to him as soon as possible.</p>

<p>He had no trouble securing paper and the occasion; and when finished,
he intrusted the missive to Sam, with the strictest injunctions
to drop it into the office at the first town where he landed.</p>

<p>The negro did his best, and a week later, when he went ashore,
he inquired for the post-office, which he found after much trouble
and delay. But he had lost the letter, and truth compelled him
to report the sad fact to his young friend.</p>

<p>After that Jim did not run the risk of a second attempt.</p>

<p>"Providence will bring me out all right some day," was his conclusion;
"and then Tom and I will talk it all over."</p>

<p>The schooner coasted up and down for weeks and months, until
spring.</p>

<p>During this period she had spent days in ports where Jim could
not gain the chance to find out the name of the town even.</p>

<p>Sam's ignorance was so dense that even if he heard the place
called out, he could not remember it ten minutes.</p>

<p>Several times Hornblower had appeared on board the vessel; but
he held no communication with Jim, nor could the latter gain any
additional knowledge of how he was progressing with his negotiations.</p>

<p>In the presence of others there was always a coolness between
Sam and the boy, and it was impossible that either of the sailors
should have suspected the strong friendship that bound the two
together.</p>

<p>The fact that the vessel was working her way northward again
made Jim uneasy; for it convinced him that a crisis was at hand,
and his fate was likely to be determined one way or the other
very soon.</p>

<p>Sam was of the same belief, as he took occasion to say when the
chance offered. Adding that he would keep his eyes and ears open.</p>

<p>On a beautiful day in spring the Simoon entered New York Bay,
and Jim resolved to seize the first opportunity to escape. The
sight of the great city filled him with such longings to see his
old friend Tom, that he could scarcely conceal his impatience
from the others.</p>

<p>A grievous disappointment awaited him.</p>

<p>So strict a surveillance was kept over him, that no artifice
was sufficient to secure the coveted chance.</p>

<p>That night Hornblower was on board, and a long and angry conference
took place forward between him and Bob.</p>

<p>Jim would have given the world could he have learned what it
was; but neither he nor Sam was allowed to catch a single expression.</p>

<p>The next morning the Simoon left the wharf and started up the
Hudson. Mr. Hornblower had decided to effect a "change of venue."</p>
