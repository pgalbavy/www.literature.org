<P>
There followed a few days of pleasurable interest to all
Englishmen who travelled in the tube and read their halfpenny
papers. A great and enlightened Press had already solved the
problem of creating the sensational without the aid of facts.
This sudden deluge, therefore, of undoubtedly tragical happenings
became almost an embarrassment to them. Black headlines, notes of
exclamation, the use of superlative adjectives, scarcely met the
case. The murder of Mr. Hamilton Fynes was strange enough. Here
was an unknown man, holding a small position in his own
country,--a man apparently without friends or social position. He
travelled over from America, merely a unit amongst the host of
other passengers; yet his first action, on arriving at Liverpool,
was to make use of privileges which belonged to an altogether
different class of person, and culminated in his arrival at
Euston in a special train with a dagger driven through his heart!
Here was material enough for a least a fortnight of sensations
and countersensations, of rumored arrests and strange theories.
Yet within the space of twenty-four hours the affair of Mr.
Hamilton Fynes had become a small thing, had shrunk almost into
insignificance by the side of the other still more dramatic,
still more wonderful happening. Somewhere between the Savoy Hotel
and Melbourne Square, Kensington, a young American gentleman of
great strength, of undoubted position, the nephew of a Minister,
and himself secretary to the Ambassador of his country in London,
had met with his death in a still more mysterious, still more
amazing fashion. He had left the hotel in an ordinary taxicab,
which had stopped on the way to pick up no other passenger. He
had left the Savoy alone, and he was discovered in Melbourne
Square alone. Yet, somewhere between these two points,
notwithstanding the fact that the aggressor must have entered the
cab either with or without his consent, Mr. Richard Vanderpole,
without a struggle, without any cry sufficiently loud to reach
the driver or attract the attention of any passer-by, had been
strangled to death by a person who had disappeared as though from
the face of the earth. The facts seemed almost unbelievable, and
yet they were facts. The driver of the taxi knew only that three
times during the course of his drive he had been caught in a
block and had had to wait for a few seconds--once at the entrance
to Trafalgar Square, again at the junction of Haymarket and Pall
Mall, and, for a third time, opposite the Hyde Park Hotel. At
neither of these halting places had he heard any one enter or
leave the taxi. He had heard no summons from his fare, even
though a tube, which was in perfect working order, was fixed
close to the back of his head. He had known nothing, in fact,
until a policeman had stopped him, having caught a glimpse of the
ghastly face inside. There was no evidence which served to throw
a single gleam of light upon the affair. Mr. Vanderpole had
called at the Savoy Hotel upon a travelling American, who had
written to the Embassy asking for some advice as to introducing
American patents into Great Britain and France. He left there to
meet his chief, who was dining down in Kensington, with the
intention of returning at once to join the Duchess of Devenham's
theatre party. He was in no manner of trouble. It was not
suggested that any one had any cause for enmity against him. Yet
this attack upon him must have been carefully planned and carried
out by a person of great strength and wonderful nerve. The
newspaper-reading public in London love their thrills, and they
had one here which needed no artificial embellishments from the
pens of those trained in an atmosphere of imagination. The simple
truth was, in itself, horrifying. There was scarcely a man or
woman who drove in a taxicab about the west end of London during
the next few days without a little thrill of emotion.
<P>
The murder of Mr. Richard Vanderpole took place on a Thursday
night. On Monday morning a gentleman of middle age, fashionably
but quietly dressed, wearing a flower in his buttonhole, patent
boots, and a silk hat which he had carefully deposited upon the
floor, was sitting closeted with Miss Penelope Morse. It was
obvious that that young lady did not altogether appreciate the
honor done to her by a visit from so distinguished a person as
Inspector Jacks!
<P>
"I am sorry," he said, "that you should find my visit in the
least offensive, Miss Morse. I have approached you, so far as
possible, as an ordinary visitor, and no one connected with your
household can have any idea as to my identity or the nature of my
business. I have done this out of consideration to your feelings.
At the same time I have my duty to perform and it must be done."
<P>
"What I cannot understand," Penelope said coldly, "is why you
should bother me about your duty. When I saw you at the Carlton
Hotel, I told you exactly how much I knew of Mr. Hamilton Fynes."
<P>
"My dear young lady," Inspector Jacks said, "I will not ask for
your sympathy, for I am afraid I should ask in vain; but we are
just now, we people at Scotland Yard, up against one of the most
extraordinary problems which have ever been put before us. We
have had two murders occurring in two days, which have this much,
at least, in common--that they have been the work of so
accomplished a criminal that at the present moment, although I
should not like to tell every one as much, we have not in either
case the ghost of a clue."
<P>
"That sounds very stupid of you," Penelope remarked, "but I still
ask--"
<P>
"Don't ask for a minute or two," the Inspector interrupted. "I
think I remarked just now that these two crimes had one thing in
common, and that was the fact that they had both been perpetrated
by a criminal of unusual accomplishments. They also have one
other point of similitude."
<P>
"What is that?" Penelope asked.
<P>
"The victim in both cases was an American," the Inspector said.
<P>
Penelope sat very still. She felt the steely eyes of the man who
had chosen his seat so carefully, fixed upon her face.
<P>
"You do not connect the two affairs in any way?" she asked.
<P>
"That is what we are asking ourselves," Mr. Jacks continued. "In
the absence of any definite clue, coincidences such as this are
always interesting. In this case, as it happens, we can take them
even a little further. We find that you, for instance, Miss
Penelope Morse, a young American lady, celebrated for her wit and
accomplishments, and well known in London society, were to have
lunched with Mr. Hamilton Fynes on the day when he made his
tragical arrival in London; we find too, curiously enough, that
you were one of the party with whom Mr. Richard Vanderpole was to
have dined and gone to the theatre on the night of his decease."
<P>
Penelope shivered, and half closed her eyes.
<P>
"Don't you think," she said, "that the shock of this coincidence,
as you call it, has been quite sufficient, without having you
come here to remind me of it?"
<P>
"Madam," Mr. Jacks said, "I have not come here to gratify any
personal curiosity. I have come here in the cause of justice. You
should find me a welcome visitor, for both these men who have
lost their lives were friends of yours."
<P>
"I should be very sorry indeed," Penelope answered, "to stand in
the way of justice. No one can hope more fervently than I do that
the perpetrator of these deeds will be found and punished. But
what I cannot understand is your coming here and reopening the
subject with me. I tell you again that I have no possible
information for you."
<P>
"Perhaps not," the Inspector declared, "but, on the other hand,
there are certain questions which you can answer me,--answer
them, I mean, not grudgingly and as though in duty bound,--answer
them intelligently, and with some apprehension of the things
which lie behind."
<P>
"And what is the thing that lies behind them?" she asked.
<P>
"A theory, madam," the Inspector answered,--"no more. But in this
case, unfortunately, we have not passed the stage of theories. My
theory, at the present moment, is that the murderer of these two
men was the same person."
<P>
"You have evidence to that effect," she said, suddenly surprised
to find that her voice had sunk to a whisper.
<P>
"Very little," Mr. Jacks admitted; "but, you see, in the case of
theories one must build them brick by brick. Then if, after all,
as we reach the end, the foundation was false, well, we must
watch them collapse and start again."
<P>
"Supposing we leave these generalities," Penelope remarked, "and
get on with those questions which you wish to ask me. My aunt, as
you may have heard, is an invalid, and although she seldom leaves
her room, this is one of the afternoons when she sometimes sits
here for a short time. I should not care to have her find you."
<P>
The Inspector leaned back in his chair. It was a very pleasant
drawing room, looking out upon the Park. A little French clock, a
masterpiece of workmanship, was ticking gayly upon the
mantelpiece. Two toy Pomeranians were half hidden in the great
rug. The walls were of light blue, soft, yet full of color, and
the carpet, of some plain material, was of the same shade. The
perfume of flowers--the faint sweetness of mimosa and the
sicklier fragrance of hyacinths--seemed almost overwhelming, for
the fire was warm and the windows closed. By the side of
Penelope's chair were a new novel and a couple of illustrated
papers, and Mr. Jacks noticed that although a paper cutter was
lying by their side the leaves of all were uncut.
<P>
"These questions," he said, "may seem to you irrelevant, yet
please answer them if you can. Mr. Hamilton Fynes, for
instance,--was he, to your knowledge, acquainted with Mr. Richard
Vanderpole?"
<P>
"I have never heard them speak of one another," Penelope
answered. "I should think it very unlikely."
<P>
"You have no knowledge of any common pursuit or interest in life
which the two men may have shared?" the Inspector asked. "A
hobby, for instance,--a collection of postage stamps, china, any
common aim of any sort?"
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"I knew little of Mr. Fynes' tastes. Dicky--I mean Mr.
Vanderpole--had none at all except an enthusiasm for his
profession and a love of polo."
<P>
"His profession," the Inspector repeated. "Mr. Vanderpole was
attached to the American Embassy, was he not?"
<P>
"I believe so," Penelope answered.
<P>
"Mr. Hamilton Fynes," the Inspector continued, "might almost have
been said to have followed the same occupation."
<P>
"Surely not!" Penelope objected. "I always understood that Mr.
Fynes was employed in a Government office at
Washington,--something to do with the Customs, I thought, or
forest duties."
<P>
Mr. Jacks nodded thoughtfully.
<P>
"I am not aware, as yet," he said, "of the precise nature of Mr.
Fynes' occupation. I only knew that it was, in some shape or
form, Government work."
<P>
"You know as much about it," she answered, "as I do."
<P>
"We have sent," the Inspector continued smoothly, "a special man
out to Washington to make all inquiries that are possible on the
spot, and incidentally, to go through the effects of the
deceased, with a view to tracing any complications in which he
may have been involved in this country."
<P>
Penelope opened her lips, but closed them again.
<P>
"I am not, however," the Inspector continued, "very sanguine of
success. In the case of Mr. Vanderpole, for instance, there could
have been nothing of the sort. He was too young, altogether too
much of a boy, to have had enemies so bitterly disposed towards
him. There is another explanation somewhere, I feel convinced, at
the root of the matter."
<P>
"You do not believe, then," asked Penelope, "that robbery was
really the motive?"
<P>
"Not ordinary robbery," Mr. Jacks answered. "A man who was
capable of these two crimes is capable of easier and greater
things. I mean," he explained, "that he could have attempted
enterprises of a far more remunerative character, with a prospect
of complete success."
<P>
"Will you forgive me," she said, "if I ask you to go on with your
questions, providing you have any more to ask me? Notwithstanding
the excellence of your disguise," she remarked with a faint curl
of the lips, "I might find it somewhat difficult to explain your
presence if my aunt or any visitors should come in."
<P>
"I am sorry, Miss Morse," the Inspector said quietly, "to find
you so unsympathetic. Had I found you differently disposed, I was
going to ask you to put yourself in my place. I was going to ask
you to look at these two tragedies from my point of view and from
your own at the same time, and I was going to ask you whether any
possible motive suggested itself to you, any possible person or
cause, which might be benefited by the removal of these two men."
<P>
"If you think, Mr. Jacks," Penelope said, "that I am keeping
anything from you, you are very much mistaken. Such sympathy as I
have would certainly be with those who are attempting to bring to
justice the perpetrator of such unmentionable crimes. What I
object to is the unpleasantness of being associated with your
inquiries when I am absolutely unable to give you the least help,
or to supply you with any information which is not equally
attainable to you."
<P>
"As, for instance?" the Inspector asked.
<P>
"You are a detective," Penelope said coldly. "You do not need me
to point out certain things to you. Mr. Hamilton Fynes was robbed
and murdered--an American citizen on his way to London. Mr.
Richard Vanderpole is also murdered, after a call upon Mr. James
B. Coulson, the only acquaintance whom Mr. Fynes is known to have
possessed in this country. Did Mr. Fynes share secrets with Mr.
Coulson? If so, did Mr. Coulson pass them on to Mr. Vanderpole,
and for that reason did Mr. Vanderpole meet with the same death,
at the same hands, as had befallen Mr. Fynes?"
<P>
Inspector Jacks moved his head thoughtfully.
<P>
"It is admirably put," he assented, "and to continue?"
<P>
"It is not my place to make suggestions to you," Penelope said.
"If you are able to connect Mr. Fynes with the American
Government, you arrive at the possibility of these murders having
been committed for some political end. I presume you read your
newspapers?"
<P>
Inspector Jacks smiled, picked up his hat and bowed, while
Penelope, with a sigh of relief, moved over to the bell.
<P>
"My dear young lady," he said, "you do not understand how
important even the point of view of another person is to a man
who is struggling to build up a theory. Whether you have helped
me as much as you could," he added, looking her in the face, "you
only can tell, but you have certainly helped me a little."
<P>
The footman had entered. The Inspector turned to follow him.
Penelope remained as she had been standing, the hand which had
touched the bell fallen to her side, her eyes fixed upon him with
a new light stirring their quiet depths.
<P>
"One moment, Morton," she said. "Wait outside. Mr. Jacks," she
added, as the door closed, "what do you mean? What can I have
told you? How can I have helped you?"
<P>
The Inspector stood very still for a brief space of time, very
still and very silent. His face, too, was quite expressionless.
Yet his tone, when he spoke, seemed to have taken to itself a
note of sternness.
<P>
"If you had chosen," he said slowly, "to have become my ally in
this matter, to have ranged yourself altogether on the side of
the law, my answer would have been ready enough. What you have
told me, however, you have told me against your will and not in
actual words. You have told me in such a way, too," he added,
"that it is impossible for me to doubt your intention to mislead
me. I am forced to conclude that we stand on opposite sides of
the way. I shall not trouble you any more, Miss Morse."
<P>
He turned to the door. Penelope remained motionless for several
moments, listening to his retreating footsteps.
