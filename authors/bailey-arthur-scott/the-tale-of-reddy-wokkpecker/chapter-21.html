<p>Reddy Woodpecker stood on the doorstep of Mr. Frog’s shop.  And inside
the tiny building Mr. Frog the tailor squatted cross-legged and
scratched upon a flat stone.  Now and then he glanced up to look closely
at Reddy Woodpecker.
</p><p>"Colors: red, white and—yes! blue!" Mr. Frog murmured, blinking his
bulging eyes at Reddy Woodpecker.  "It’s a little too blackish for my
taste, but it’s certainly blue....  A good suit for the Fourth of July!"
he muttered.  "Just the thing for a clown to wear in a parade of
Horribles!"
</p><p>Mr. Frog’s remarks did not please Reddy Woodpecker.  In fact they made
him very angry.  But Mr. Frog didn’t appear to notice that.  He went
right on talking to himself.
</p><p>"Red head and black tail!" he said, scratching upon his stone all the
while. "Black head and red tail would be much better."
</p><p>"I didn’t come here to be abused!" Reddy Woodpecker spluttered.
</p><p>The tailor paid no heed to Reddy’s protest.
</p><p>"Too much stiffening in the tail!" Mr. Frog mumbled.  "Colors too gay
for everyday wear!  Too loud for the best taste!"
</p><p>By this time Reddy Woodpecker had become so furious that he couldn’t
speak.
</p><p>Meanwhile Mr. Frog continued to look him over calmly, and as his gaze
fell at last upon Reddy’s feet he began to titter.
</p><p>"This person’s feet are all wrong," he chanted, scratching like mad upon
his flat stone.  "Never saw a bird before with toes like his.  The rule
for birds is: three toes in front, one toe in back.  This person has two
in front and two in back.  I <u>thought</u> there was something queer about
him."
</p><p>"Look here!" Reddy Woodpecker burst forth.  "I won’t stay here any
longer. You’re making fun of me.  I don’t care if I did promise.  If my
clothes are so queer why do you want to copy them?"
</p><p>"I don’t <u>want</u> to copy them," Mr. Frog replied.  "I’d <u>hate</u> to copy
them."
</p><p>"Then why did you ask me to stand here in front of your shop while you
wrote down all this nonsense?"
</p><p>"You’re mistaken," Mr. Frog told him. "I haven’t written a word.  I
asked you to come here because you look like a customer.  It’s good
business to have customers seen about my shop.  I haven’t had a <u>real</u>
customer this season," he added somewhat sadly.  "So you can’t blame me
if I want people to think I have one at last—now can you?"
</p><p>Reddy Woodpecker had no patience with him.
</p><p>"I think you’re nothing but a fraud," he declared.  "I don’t believe
you’re a tailor at all."
</p><p>"Dear me!" said Mr. Frog.  "Maybe I’m not.  Sometimes I’ve wondered if I
wasn’t fooling myself."
</p><p>"You’d better stick to catching flies," Reddy advised him.  "That’s all
you’re good for."
</p><p>"Perhaps you’re right," Mr. Frog replied. He seemed quite meek and
mournful. But all at once he smiled.  "Anyhow," he remarked, "it’s lucky
that the flies stick to me—now isn’t it?"
