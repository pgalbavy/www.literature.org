While the young Bhaers were having serious experiences at home, Josie
was enjoying herself immensely at Rocky Nook; for the Laurences knew
how to make summer idleness both charming and wholesome. Bess was
very fond of her little cousin; Mrs Amy felt that whether her niece
was an actress or not she must be a gentlewoman, and gave her the
social training which marks the well-bred woman everywhere; while
Uncle Laurie was never happier than when rowing, riding, playing, or
lounging with two gay girls beside him. Josie bloomed like a wild
flower in this free life, Bess grew rosy, brisk, and merry, and both
were great favourites with the neighbours, whose villas were by the
shore or perched on the cliffs along the pretty bay.</p>

<p>One crumpled rose-leaf disturbed Josie's peace, one baffled wish
filled her with a longing which became a mania, and kept her as
restless and watchful as a detective with a case to 'work up'. Miss
Cameron, the great actress, had hired one of the villas and retired
thither to rest and 'create' a new part for next season. She saw no
one but a friend or two, had a private beach, and was invisible
except during her daily drive, or when the opera-glasses of curious
gazers were fixed on a blue figure disporting itself in the sea. The
Laurences knew her, but respected her privacy, and after a call left
her in peace till she expressed a wish for society - a courtesy which
she remembered and repaid later, as we shall see.</p>

<p>But Josie was like a thirsty fly buzzing about a sealed honey-pot,
for this nearness to her idol was both delightful and maddening.  She
pined to see, hear, talk with, and study this great and happy woman
who could thrill thousands by her art, and win friends by her virtue,
benevolence, and beauty. This was the sort of actress the girl meant
to be, and few could object if the gift was really hers; for the
stage needs just such women to purify and elevate the profession
which should teach as well as amuse. If kindly Miss Cameron had known
what passionate love and longing burned in the bosom of the little
girl whom she idly observed skipping over the rocks, splashing about
the beach, or galloping past her gate on a Shetland pony, she would
have made her happy by a look or a word. But being tired with her
winter's work and busy with her new part, the lady took no more
notice of this young neighbour than of the sea-gulls in the bay or
the daisies dancing in the fields.  Nosegays left on her doorstep,
serenades under her garden-wall, and the fixed stare of admiring eyes
were such familiar things that she scarcely minded them; and Josie
grew desperate when all her little attempts failed.</p>

<p>'I might climb that pine-tree and tumble off on her piazza roof, or
get Sheltie to throw me just at her gate and be taken in fainting.
It's no use to try to drown myself when she is bathing. I can't sink,
and she'd only send a man to pull me out. What can I do? I will see
her and tell her my hopes and make her say I can act some day.  Mamma
would believe her; and if - oh, if she only would let me study with
her, what perfect joy that would be!'</p>

<p>Josie made these remarks one afternoon as she and Bess prepared for a
swim, a fishing party having prevented their morning bathe.</p>

<p>'You must bide your time, dear, and not be so impatient. Papa
promised to give you a chance before the season is over, and he
always manages things nicely. That will be better than any queer
prank of yours,' answered Bess, tying her pretty hair in a white net
to match her suit, while Josie made a little lobster of herself in
scarlet.</p>

<p>'I hate to wait; but I suppose I must. Hope she will bathe this
afternoon, though it is low tide. She told Uncle she should have to
go in then because in the morning people stared so and went on her
beach. Come and have a good dive from the big rock. No one round but
nurses and babies, so we can romp and splash as much as we like.'</p>

<p>Away they went to have a fine time; for the little bay was free from
other bathers, and the babies greatly admired their aquatic
gymnastics, both being expert swimmers.</p>

<p>As they sat dripping on the big rock Josie suddenly gave a clutch
that nearly sent Bess overboard, as she cried excitedly:</p>

<p>'There she is! Look! coming to bathe. How splendid! Oh, if she only
would drown a little and let me save her! or even get her toe nipped
by a crab; anything so I could go and speak!'</p>

<p>'Don't seem to look; she comes to be quiet and enjoy herself.
Pretend we don't see her, that's only civil,' answered Bess,
affecting to be absorbed in a white-winged yacht going by.</p>

<p>'Let's carelessly float that way as if going for seaweed on the
rocks.  She can't mind if we are flat on our backs, with only our
noses out.  Then when we can't help seeing her, we'll swim back as if
anxious to retire. That will impress her, and she may call to thank
the very polite young ladies who respect her wishes,' proposed Josie,
whose lively fancy was always planning dramatic situations.</p>

<p>Just as they were going to slip from their rock, as if Fate relented
at last, Miss Cameron was seen to beckon wildly as she stood
waist-deep in the water, looking down. She called to her maid, who
seemed searching along the beach for something, and not finding what
she sought, waved a towel towards the girls as if summoning them to
help her.</p>

<p>'Run, fly! she wants us, she wants us!' cried Josie, tumbling into
the water like a very energetic turtle, and swimming away in her best
style towards this long desired haven of joy. Bess followed more
slowly, and both came panting and smiling up to Miss Cameron, who
never lifted her eyes, but said in that wonderful voice of hers:</p>

<p>'I've dropped a bracelet. I see it, but can't get it. Will the little
boy find me a long stick? I'll keep my eye on it, so the water shall
not wash it away.'</p>

<p>'I'll dive for it with pleasure; but I'm not a boy,' answered Josie,
laughing as she shook the curly head which at a distance had deceived
the lady.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon. Dive away, child; the sand is covering it fast. I
value it very much. Never forgot to take it off before.'</p>

<p>'I'll get it!' and down went Josie, to come up with a handful of 
pebbles, but no bracelet.</p>

<p>'It's gone; never mind - my fault,' said Miss Cameron, disappointed,
but amused at the girl's dismay as she shook the water out of her
eyes and gasped bravely:</p>

<p>'No, it isn't. I'll have it, if I stay down all night!' and with one
long breath Josie dived again, leaving nothing but a pair of agitated
feet to be seen.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid she will hurt herself,' said Miss Cameron, looking at
Bess, whom she recognized by her likeness to her mother.</p>

<p>'Oh, no; Josie is a little fish. She likes it'; and Bess smiled
happily at this wonderful granting of her cousin's desire.</p>

<p>'You are Mr Laurence's daughter, I think? How d'ye do, dear? Tell
papa I'm coming to see him soon. Too tired before. Quite savage.
Better now. Ah! here's our pearl of divers. What luck?' she asked, as
the heels went down and a dripping head came up.</p>

<p>Josie could only choke and splutter at first, being half strangled;
but though her hands had failed again, her courage had not; and with
a resolute shake of her wet hair, a bright look at the tall lady, and
a series of puffs to fill her lungs, she said calmly:</p>

<p>'&quot;Never give up&quot; is my motto. I'm going to get it, if I go to
Liverpool for it! Now, then!' and down went the mermaid quite out of
sight this time, groping like a real lobster at the bottom of the
sea.</p>

<p>'Plucky little girl! I like that. Who is she?' asked the lady,
sitting down on a half-covered stone to watch her diver, since the
bracelet was lost sight of.</p>

<p>Bess told her, adding, with the persuasive smile of her father:
'Josie longs to be an actress, and has waited for a month to see you.
This is a great happiness for her.'</p>

<p>'Bless the child! why didn't she come and call? I'd have let her in;
though usually I avoid stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed
Miss Cameron.</p>

<p>There was no time for more; a brown hand, grasping the bracelet, rose
out of the sea, followed by a purple face as Josie came up so blind
and dizzy she could only cling to Bess, half drowned but triumphant.</p>

<p>Miss Cameron drew her to the rock where she sat, and pushing the hair
out of her eyes, revived her with a hearty 'Bravo! bravo!' which
assured the girl that her first act was a hit. Josie had often
imagined her meeting with the great actress - the dignity and grace
with which she would enter and tell her ambitious hopes, the
effective dress she would wear, the witty things she would say, the
deep impression her budding genius would make. But never in her
wildest moments had she imagined an interview like this; scarlet,
sandy, streaming, and speechless she leaned against the illustrious
shoulder, looking like a beautiful seal as she blinked and wheezed
till she could smile joyfully and exclaim proudly:</p>

<p>'I did get it! I'm so glad!'</p>

<p>'Now get your breath, my dear; then I shall be glad also. It was very
nice of you to take all that trouble for me. How shall I thank you?'
asked the lady, looking at her with the beautiful eyes that could say
so many things without words.</p>

<p>Josie clasped her hands with a wet spat which rather destroyed the
effect of the gesture, and answered in a beseeching tone that would
have softened a far harder heart than Miss Cameron's:</p>

<p>'Let me come and see you once - only once! I want you to tell me if I
can act; you will know. I'll abide by what you say; and if you think
I can - by and by, when I've studied very hard - I shall be the
happiest girl in the world. May I?'</p>

<p>'Yes; come tomorrow at eleven. We'll have a good talk; you shall show
me what you can do, and I'll give you my opinion. But you won't like
it.'</p>

<p>'I will, no matter if you tell me I'm a fool. I want it settled; so
does mamma. I'll take it bravely if you say no; and if you say yes,
I'll never give up till I've done my best - as you did.'</p>

<p>'Ah, my child, it's a weary road, and there are plenty of thorns
among the roses when you've won them. I think you have the courage,
and this proves that you have perseverance. Perhaps you'll do. Come,
and we'll see.'</p>

<p>Miss Cameron touched the bracelet as she spoke, and smiled so kindly
that impetuous Josie wanted to kiss her; but wisely refrained, though
her eyes were wet with softer water than any in the sea as she
thanked her.</p>

<p>'We are keeping Miss Cameron from her bath, and the tide is going
out. Come, Josie,' said thoughtful Bess, fearing to outstay their
welcome.</p>

<p>'Run over the beach and get warm. Thank you very much, little
mermaid. Tell papa to bring his daughter to see me any time.
Good-bye'; and with a wave of her hand the tragedy queen dismissed
her court, but remained on her weedy throne watching the two lithe
figures race over the sand with twinkling feet till they were out of
sight. Then, as she calmly bobbed up and down in the water, she said
to herself: 'The child has a good stage face, vivid, mobile; fine
eyes, abandon, pluck, will. Perhaps she'll do. Good stock - talent in
the family. We shall see.'</p>

<p>Of course Josie never slept a wink, and was in a fever of joyful
excitement next day. Uncle Laurie enjoyed the episode very much, and
Aunt Amy looked out her most becoming white dress for the grand
occasion; Bess lent her most artistic hat, and Josie ranged the wood
and marsh for a bouquet of wild roses, sweet white azalea, ferns, and
graceful grasses, as the offering of a very grateful heart.</p>

<p>At ten she solemnly arrayed herself, and then sat looking at her neat
gloves and buckled shoes till it was time to go, growing pale and
sober with the thought that her fate was soon to be decided; for,
like all young people she was sure that her whole life could be
settled by one human creature, quite forgetting how wonderfully
Providence trains us by disappointment, surprises us with unexpected
success, and turns our seeming trials into blessings.</p>

<p>'I will go alone: we shall be freer so. Oh, Bess, pray that she may
tell me rightly! So much depends on that! Don't laugh, uncle! It is a
very serious moment for me. Miss Cameron knows that, and will tell
you so. Kiss me, Aunt Amy, since mamma isn't here. If you say I look
nice, I'm quite satisfied. Good-bye.' And with a wave of the hand as
much like her model's as she could make it, Josie departed, looking
very pretty and feeling very tragical.</p>

<p>Sure now of admittance, she boldly rang at the door which excluded so
many, and being ushered into a shady parlour, feasted her eyes upon
several fine portraits of great actors while she waited. She had read
about most of them, and knew their trials and triumphs so well that
she soon forgot herself, and tried to imitate Mrs Siddons as Lady
Macbeth, looking up at the engraving as she held her nosegay like the
candle in the sleep-walking scene, and knit her youthful brows
distressfully while murmuring the speech of the haunted queen. So
busy was she that Miss Cameron watched her for several minutes
unseen, then startled her by suddenly sweeping in with the words upon
her lips, the look upon her face, which made that one of her greatest
scenes.</p>

<p>'I never can do it like that; but I'll keep trying, if you say I
may,' cried Josie, forgetting her manners in the intense interest of
the moment.</p>

<p>'Show me what you can do,' answered the actress, wisely plunging into
the middle of things at once, well knowing that no common chat would
satisfy this very earnest little person.</p>

<p>'First let me give you these. I thought you'd like wild things better
than hot-house flowers; and I loved to bring them, as I'd no other
way to thank you for your great kindness to me,' said Josie, offering
her nosegay with a simple warmth that was very sweet.</p>

<p>'I do love them best, and keep my room full of the posies some good
fairy hangs on my gate. Upon my word, I think I've found the fairy
out - these are so like,' she added quickly, as her eye went from the
flowers in her hand to others that stood near by, arranged with the
same taste.</p>

<p>Josie's blush and smile betrayed her before she said, with a look
full of girlish adoration and humility: 'I couldn't help it; I admire
you so much. I know it was a liberty; but as I couldn't get in
myself, I loved to think my posies pleased you.'</p>

<p>Something about the child and her little offering touched the woman,
and, drawing Josie to her, she said, with no trace of actress in face
or voice:</p>

<p>'They did please me, dear, and so do you. I'm tired of praise; and
love is very sweet, when it is simple and sincere like this.'</p>

<p>Josie remembered to have heard, among many other stories, that Miss
Cameron lost her lover years ago, and since had lived only for art.
Now she felt that this might have been true; and pity for the
splendid, lonely life made her face very eloquent, as well as
grateful. Then, as if anxious to forget the past, her new friend
said, in the commanding way that seemed natural to her:</p>

<p>'Let me see what you can do. Juliet, of course. All begin with that.
Poor soul, how she is murdered!'</p>

<p>Now, Josie had intended to begin with Romeo's much-enduring
sweetheart, and follow her up with Bianca, Pauline, and several of
the favourite idols of stage-struck girls; but being a shrewd little
person, she suddenly saw the wisdom of Uncle Laurie's advice, and
resolved to follow it. So instead of the rant Miss Cameron expected,
Josie gave poor Ophelia's mad scene, and gave it very well, having
been trained by the college professor of elocution and done it many
times. She was too young, of course, but the white gown, the loose
hair, the real flowers she scattered over the imaginary grave, added
to the illusion; and she sung the songs sweetly, dropped her pathetic
curtsies, and vanished behind the curtain that divided the rooms with
a backward look that surprised her critical auditor into a quick
gesture of applause. Cheered by that welcome sound, Josie ran back as
a little hoyden in one of the farces she had often acted, telling a
story full of fun and naughtiness at first, but ending with a sob of
repentance and an earnest prayer for pardon.</p>

<p>'Very good! Try again. Better than I expected,' called the voice of
the oracle.</p>

<p>Josie tried Portia's speech, and recited very well, giving due
emphasis to each fine sentence. Then, unable to refrain from what she
considered her greatest effort, she burst into Juliet's balcony
scene, ending with the poison and the tomb. She felt sure that she
surpassed herself, and waited for applause. A ringing laugh made her
tingle with indignation and disappointment, as she went to stand
before Miss Cameron, saying in a tone of polite surprise:</p>

<p>'I have been told that I did it very well. I'm sorry you don't think
so.'</p>

<p>'My dear, it's very bad. How can it help being so? What can a child
like you know of love and fear and death? Don't try it yet. Leave
tragedy alone till you are ready for it.'</p>

<p>'But you clapped Ophelia.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that was very pretty. Any clever girl can do it effectively.
But the real meaning of Shakespeare is far above you yet, child. The
comedy bit was best. There you showed real talent. It was both comic
and pathetic. That's art. Don't lose it. The Portia was good
declamation. Go on with that sort of thing; it trains the voice - 
teaches shades of expression. You've a good voice and natural
grace - great helps both, hard to acquire.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'm glad I've got something,' sighed Josie, sitting meekly on
a stool, much crestfallen, but not daunted yet, and bound to have her
say out.</p>

<p>'My dear little girl, I told you that you would not like what I
should say to you; yet I must be honest if I would really help you.
I've had to do it for many like you; and most of them have never
forgiven me, though my words have proved true, and they are what I
advised them to be - good wives and happy mothers in quiet homes. A
few have kept on, and done fairly well. One you will hear of soon, I
think; for she has talent, indomitable patience, and mind as well as
beauty. You are too young to show to which class you belong. Geniuses
are very rare, and even at fifteen seldom give much promise of future
power.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I don't think I'm a genius!' cried Josie, growing calm and sober
as she listened to the melodious voice and looked into the expressive
face that filled her with confidence, so strong, sincere, and kindly
was it. 'I only want to find out if I have talent enough to go on,
and after years of study to be able to act well in any of the good
plays people never tire of seeing. I don't expect to be a Mrs Siddons
or a Miss Cameron, much as I long to be; but it does seem as if I had
something in me which can't come out in any way but this. When I act
I'm perfectly happy. I seem to live, to be in my own world, and each
new part is a new friend. I love Shakespeare, and am never tired of
his splendid people. Of course, I don't understand it all; but it's
like being alone at night with the mountains and the stars, solemn
and grand, and I try to imagine how it will look when the sun comes
up, and all is glorious and clear to me. I can't see, but I feel the
beauty, and long to express it.'</p>

<p>As she spoke with the most perfect self-forgetfulness Josie was pale
with excitement, her eyes shone, her lips trembled, and all her
little soul seemed trying to put into words the emotions that filled
it to overflowing. Miss Cameron understood, felt that this was
something more than a girlish whim; and when she answered there was a
new tone of sympathy in her voice, a new interest in her face, though
she wisely refrained from saying all she thought, well knowing what
splendid dreams young people build upon a word, and how bitter is the
pain when the bright bubbles burst.</p>

<p>'If you feel this, I can give you no better advice than to go on
loving and studying our great master,' she said slowly; but Josie
caught the changed tone, and felt, with a thrill of joy, that her new
friend was speaking to her now as to a comrade. 'It is an education
in itself, and a lifetime is not long enough to teach you all his
secret. But there is much to do before you can hope to echo his
words. Have you the patience, courage, strength, to begin at the
beginning, and slowly, painfully, lay the foundation for future work?
Fame is a pearl many dive for and only a few bring up. Even when they
do, it is not perfect, and they sigh for more, and lose better things
in struggling for them.'</p>

<p>The last words seemed spoken more to herself than to her hearer, but
Josie answered quickly, with a smile and an expressive gesture:</p>

<p>'I got the bracelet in spite of all the bitter water in my eyes.'</p>

<p>'You did! I don't forget it. A good omen. We will accept it.'</p>

<p>Miss Cameron answered the smile with one that was like sunshine to
the girl, and stretched her white hands as if taking some invisible
gift. Then added in a different tone, watching the effect of her
words on the expressive face before her:</p>

<p>'Now you will be disappointed, for instead of telling you to come and
study with me, or go and act in some second-rate theatre at once, I
advise you to go back to school and finish your education.  That is
the first step, for all accomplishments are needed, and a single
talent makes a very imperfect character. Cultivate mind and body,
heart and soul, and make yourself an intelligent, graceful,
beautiful, and healthy girl. Then, at eighteen or twenty, go into
training and try your powers. Better start for the battle with your
arms in order, and save the hard lesson which comes when we rush on
too soon. Now and then genius carries all before it, but not often.
We have to climb slowly, with many slips and falls. Can you wait as
well as work?'</p>

<p>'I will!'</p>

<p>'We shall see. It would be pleasant to me to know that when I quit
the stage I leave behind me a well-trained, faithful, gifted comrade
to more than fill my place, and carry on what I have much at heart - 
the purification of the stage. Perhaps you are she; but remember,
mere beauty and rich costumes do not make an actress, nor are the
efforts of a clever little girl to play great characters real art. It
is all dazzle and sham, and a disgrace and disappointment now. Why
will the public be satisfied with opera bouffe, or the trash called
society plays when a world of truth and beauty, poetry and pathos
lies waiting to be interpreted and enjoyed?'</p>

<p>Miss Cameron had forgotten to whom she spoke, and walked to and fro,
full of the noble regret all cultivated people feel at the low state
of the stage nowadays.</p>

<p>'That's what Uncle Laurie says; and he and Aunt Jo try to plan plays
about true and lovely things - simple domestic scenes that touch
people's hearts, and make them laugh and cry and feel better.  Uncle
says that sort is my style, and I must not think of tragedy.  But
it's so much nicer to sweep about in crowns and velvet trains than to
wear everyday clothes, and just be myself, though it is so easy.'</p>

<p>'Yet that is high art, child, and what we need for a time till we are
ready for the masters. Cultivate that talent of yours. It is a
special gift, this power to bring tears and smiles, and a sweeter
task to touch the heart than to freeze the blood or fire the
imagination.  Tell your uncle he is right, and ask your aunt to try a
play for you.  I'll come and see it when you are ready.'</p>

<p>'Will you? Oh! will you? We are going to have some at Christmas, with
a nice part for me. A simple little thing, but I can do it, and
should be so proud, so happy to have you there.'</p>

<p>Josie rose as she spoke, for a glance at the clock showed her that
her call was a long one; and hard as it was to end this momentous
interview, she felt that she must go. Catching up her hat she went to
Miss Cameron, who stood looking at her so keenly that she felt as
transparent as a pane of glass, and coloured prettily as she looked
up, saying, with a grateful little tremor in her voice:</p>

<p>'I can never thank you for this hour and all you have told me. I
shall do just what you advise, and mamma will be very glad to see me
settled at my books again. I can study now with all my heart, because
it is to help me on; and I won't hope too much, but work and wait,
and try to please you, as the only way to pay my debt.'</p>

<p>'That reminds me that I have not paid mine. Little friend, wear this
for my sake. It is fit for a mermaid, and will remind you of your
first dive. May the next bring up a better jewel, and leave no bitter
water on your lips!'</p>

<p>As she spoke, Miss Cameron took from the lace at her throat a pretty
pin of aquamarine, and fastened it like an order on Josie's proud
bosom; then lifting the happy little face, she kissed it very
tenderly, and watched it go smiling away with eyes that seemed to see
into a future full of the trials and the triumphs which she knew so
well.</p>

<p>Bess expected to see Josie come flying in, all raptures and
excitement, or drowned in tears of disappointment, but was surprised
at the expression of calm content and resolution which she wore.
Pride and satisfaction, and a new feeling of responsibility both
sobered and sustained her, and she felt that any amount of dry study
and long waiting would be bearable, if in the glorious future she
could be an honour to her profession and a comrade to the new friend
whom she already adored with girlish ardour.</p>

<p>She told her little story to a deeply interested audience, and all
felt that Miss Cameron's advice was good. Mrs Amy was relieved at the
prospect of delay; for she did not want her niece to be an actress
and hoped the fancy would die out.</p>

<p>Uncle Laurie was full of charming plans and prophecies and wrote one
of his most delightful notes to thank their neighbour for her
kindness; while Bess, who loved art of all kinds, fully sympathized
with her cousin's ambitious hopes, only wondering why she preferred
to act out her visions rather than embody them in marble.</p>

<p>That first interview was not the last; for Miss Cameron was really
interested, and had several memorable conversations with the
Laurences, while the girls sat by, drinking in every word with the
delight all artists feel in their own beautiful world, and learning
to see how sacred good gifts are, how powerful, and how faithfully
they should be used for high ends, each in its own place helping to
educate, refine, and refresh.</p>

<p>Josie wrote reams to her mother; and when the visit ended rejoiced
her heart by bringing her a somewhat changed little daughter, who
fell to work at the once-detested books with a patient energy which
surprised and pleased everyone. The right string had been touched,
and even French exercises and piano practice became endurable, since
accomplishments would be useful by and by; dress, manners, and habits
were all interesting now, because 'mind and body, heart and soul,
must be cultivated', and while training to become an 'intelligent,
graceful, healthy girl', little Josie was unconsciously fitting
herself to play her part well on whatever stage the great Manager
might prepare for her.</p>
