<p><u>To Madame Daniel,<br/>
  La Roncière,<br/>
    near Bassicourt.</u>
</p>
<p><strong>"PARIS 30 NOVEMBER</strong>
</p><p>"My Dearest Friend,--
</p><p>"There has been no letter from you for a fortnight; so I don't expect now
to receive one for that troublesome date of the 5th of December, which we
fixed as the last day of our partnership. I rather wish it would come,
because you will then be released from a contract which no longer seems to
give you pleasure. To me the seven battles which we fought and won together
were a time of endless delight and enthusiasm. I was living beside you. I
was conscious of all the good which that more active and stirring existence
was doing you. My happiness was so great that I dared not speak of it to
you or let you see anything of my secret feelings except my desire to
please you and my passionate devotion. To-day you have had enough of your
brother in arms. Your will shall be law.
</p><p>"But, though I bow to your decree, may I remind you what it was that I
always believed our final adventure would be? May I repeat your words, not
one of which I have forgotten?
</p><p>"'I demand,' you said, 'that you shall restore to me a small, antique
clasp, made of a cornelian set in a filigree mount. It came to me from my
mother; and every one knew that it used to bring her happiness and me too.
Since the day when it vanished from my jewel-case, I have had nothing but
unhappiness. Restore it to me, my good genius.'
</p><p>"And, when I asked you when the clasp had disappeared, you answered, with a
laugh:
</p><p>"'Seven years ago ... or eight ... or nine: I don't know exactly.... I
don't know when ... I don't know how ... I know nothing about it....'
</p><p>"You were challenging me, were you not, and you set me that condition
because it was one which I could not fulfil? Nevertheless, I promised and I
should like to keep my promise. What I have tried to do, in order to place
life before you in a more favourable light, would seem purposeless, if your
confidence feels the lack of this talisman to which you attach so great a
value. We must not laugh at these little superstitions. They are often the
mainspring of our best actions.
</p><p>"Dear friend, if you had helped me, I should have achieved yet one more
victory. Alone and hard pushed by the proximity of the date, I have failed,
not however without placing things on such a footing that the undertaking
if you care to follow it up, has the greatest chance of success.
</p><p>"And you will follow it up, won't you? We have entered into a mutual
agreement which we are bound to honour. It behooves us, within a fixed
time, to inscribe in the book of our common life eight good stories, to
which we shall have brought energy, logic, perseverance, some subtlety and
occasionally a little heroism. This is the eighth of them. It is for you to
act so that it may be written in its proper place on the 5th of December,
before the clock strikes eight in the evening.
</p><p>"And, on that day, you will act as I shall now tell you.
</p><p>"First of all--and above all, my dear, do not complain that my instructions
are fanciful: each of them is an indispensable condition of success--first
of all, cut in your cousin's garden three slender lengths of rush. Plait
them together and bind up the two ends so as to make a rude switch, like a
child's whip-lash.
</p><p>"When you get to Paris, buy a long necklace of jet beads, cut into facets,
and shorten it so that it consists of seventy-five beads, of almost equal
size.
</p><p>"Under your winter cloak, wear a blue woollen gown. On your head, a toque
with red leaves on it. Round your neck, a feather boa. No gloves. No rings.
</p><p>"In the afternoon, take a cab along the left bank of the river to the
church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont. At four o'clock exactly, there will be,
near the holy-water basin, just inside the church, an old woman dressed
in black, saying her prayers on a silver rosary. She will offer you holy
water. Give her your necklace. She will count the beads and hand it back
to you. After this, you will walk behind her, you will cross an arm of the
Seine and she will lead you, down a lonely street in the Ile Saint-Louis,
to a house which you will enter by yourself.
</p><p>"On the ground-floor of this house, you will find a youngish man with a
very pasty complexion. Take off your cloak and then say to him:
</p><p>"'I have come to fetch my clasp.'
</p><p>"Do not be astonished by his agitation or dismay. Keep calm in his
presence. If he questions you, if he wants to know your reason for applying
to him or what impels you to make that request, give him no explanation.
Your replies must be confined to these brief formulas:
</p><p>"'I have come to fetch what belongs to me. I don't know you, I don't know
your name; but I am obliged to come to you like this. I must have my clasp
returned to me. I must.'
</p><p>"I honestly believe that, if you have the firmness not to swerve from
that attitude, whatever farce the man may play, you will be completely
successful. But the contest must be a short one and the issue will depend
solely on your confidence in yourself and your certainty of success. It
will be a sort of match in which you must defeat your opponent in the first
round. If you remain impassive, you will win. If you show hesitation or
uneasiness, you can do nothing against him. He will escape you and regain
the upper hand after a first moment of distress; and the game will be lost
in a few minutes. There is no midway house between victory or ... defeat.
</p><p>"In the latter event, you would be obliged--I beg you to pardon me for
saying so--again to accept my collaboration. I offer it you in advance, my
dear, and without any conditions, while stating quite plainly that all that
I have been able to do for you and all that I may yet do gives me no other
right than that of thanking you and devoting myself more than ever to the
woman who represents my joy, my whole life."
</p><hr/>
<p>Hortense, after reading the letter, folded it up and put it away at the
back of a drawer, saying, in a resolute voice:
</p><p>"I sha'n't go."
</p><p>To begin with, although she had formerly attached some slight importance
to this trinket, which she had regarded as a mascot, she felt very little
interest in it now that the period of her trials was apparently at an end.
She could not forget that figure eight, which was the serial number of the
next adventure. To launch herself upon it meant taking up the interrupted
chain, going back to Rénine and giving him a pledge which, with his powers
of suggestion, he would know how to turn to account.
</p><p>Two days before the 5th of December, she was still in the same frame of
mind. So she was on the morning of the 4th; but suddenly, without even
having to contend against preliminary subterfuges, she ran out into the
garden, cut three lengths of rush, plaited them as she used to do in her
childhood and at twelve o'clock had herself driven to the station. She was
uplifted by an eager curiosity. She was unable to resist all the amusing
and novel sensations which the adventure, proposed by Rénine, promised her.
It was really too tempting. The jet necklace, the toque with the autumn
leaves, the old woman with the silver rosary: how could she resist their
mysterious appeal and how could she refuse this opportunity of showing
Rénine what she was capable of doing?
</p><p>"And then, after all," she said to herself, laughing, "he's summoning me to
Paris. Now eight o'clock is dangerous to me at a spot three hundred miles
from Paris, in that old deserted Château de Halingre, but nowhere else. The
only clock that can strike the threatening hour is down there, under lock
and key, a prisoner!"
</p><p>She reached Paris that evening. On the morning of the 5th she went out and
bought a jet necklace, which she reduced to seventy-five beads, put on
a blue gown and a toque with red leaves and, at four o'clock precisely,
entered the church of Saint-Étienne-du-Mont.
</p><p>Her heart was throbbing violently. This time she was alone; and how acutely
she now felt the strength of that support which, from unreflecting fear
rather than any reasonable motive, she had thrust aside! She looked around
her, almost hoping to see him. But there was no one there ... no one except
an old lady in black, standing beside the holy water basin.
</p><p>Hortense went up to her. The old lady, who held a silver rosary in her
hands, offered her holy water and then began to count the beads of the
necklace which Hortense gave her.
</p><p>She whispered:
</p><p>"Seventy-five. That's right. Come."
</p><p>Without another word, she toddled along under the light of the
street-lamps, crossed the Pont des Tournelles to the Ile Saint-Louis and
went down an empty street leading to a cross-roads, where she stopped in
front of an old house with wrought-iron balconies:
</p><p>"Go in," she said.
</p><p>And the old lady went away.
</p><hr/>
<p>Hortense now saw a prosperous-looking shop which occupied almost the
whole of the ground-floor and whose windows, blazing with electric light,
displayed a huddled array of old furniture and antiquities. She stood there
for a few seconds, gazing at it absently. A sign-board bore the words "The
Mercury," together with the name of the owner of the shop, "Pancaldi."
Higher up, on a projecting cornice which ran on a level with the first
floor, a small niche sheltered a terra-cotta Mercury poised on one foot,
with wings to his sandals and the caduceus in his hand, who, as Hortense
noted, was leaning a little too far forward in the ardour of his flight
and ought logically to have lost his balance and taken a header into the
street.
</p><p>"Now!" she said, under her breath.
</p><p>She turned the handle of the door and walked in.
</p><p>Despite the ringing of the bells actuated by the opening door, no one came
to meet her. The shop seemed to be empty. However, at the extreme end there
was a room at the back of the shop and after that another, both crammed
with furniture and knick-knacks, many of which looked very valuable.
Hortense followed a narrow gangway which twisted and turned between two
walls built up of cupboards, cabinets and console-tables, went up two steps
and found herself in the last room of all.
</p><p>A man was sitting at a writing-desk and looking through some account-books.
Without turning his head, he said:
</p><p>"I am at your service, madam.... Please look round you...."
</p><p>This room contained nothing but articles of a special character which
gave it the appearance of some alchemist's laboratory in the middle ages:
stuffed owls, skeletons, skulls, copper alembics, astrolabes and all
around, hanging on the walls, amulets of every description, mainly hands
of ivory or coral with two fingers pointing to ward off ill-luck.
</p><p>"Are you wanting anything in particular, madam?" asked M. Pancaldi, closing
his desk and rising from his chair.
</p><p>"It's the man," thought Hortense.
</p><p>He had in fact an uncommonly pasty complexion. A little forked beard,
flecked with grey, lengthened his face, which was surmounted by a bald,
pallid forehead, beneath which gleamed a pair of small, prominent,
restless, shifty eyes.
</p><p>Hortense, who had not removed her veil or cloak, replied:
</p><p>"I want a clasp."
</p><p>"They're in this show-case," he said, leading the way to the connecting
room.
</p><p>Hortense glanced over the glass case and said:
</p><p>"No, no, ... I don't see what I'm looking for. I don't want just any clasp,
but a clasp which I lost out of a jewel-case some years ago and which I
have to look for here."
</p><p>She was astounded to see the commotion displayed on his features. His eyes
became haggard.
</p><p>"Here?... I don't think you are in the least likely.... What sort of clasp
is it?..."
</p><p>"A cornelian, mounted in gold filigree ... of the 1830 period."
</p><p>"I don't understand," he stammered. "Why do you come to me?"
</p><p>She now removed her veil and laid aside her cloak.
</p><p>He stepped back, as though terrified by the sight of her, and whispered:
</p><p>"The blue gown!... The toque!... And--can I believe my eyes?--the jet
necklace!..."
</p><p>It was perhaps the whip-lash formed of three rushes that excited him most
violently. He pointed his finger at it, began to stagger where he stood and
ended by beating the air with his arms, like a drowning man, and fainting
away in a chair.
</p><p>Hortense did not move.
</p><p>"Whatever farce he may play," Rénine had written, "have the courage to
remain impassive."
</p><p>Perhaps he was not playing a farce. Nevertheless she forced herself to be
calm and indifferent.
</p><p>This lasted for a minute or two, after which M. Pancaldi recovered from
his swoon, wiped away the perspiration streaming down his forehead and,
striving to control himself, resumed, in a trembling voice:
</p><p>"Why do you apply to me?"
</p><p>"Because the clasp is in your possession."
</p><p>"Who told you that?" he said, without denying the accusation. "How do you
know?"
</p><p>"I know because it is so. Nobody has told me anything. I came here positive
that I should find my clasp and with the immovable determination to take it
away with me."
</p><p>"But do you know me? Do you know my name?"
</p><p>"I don't know you. I did not know your name before I read it over your
shop. To me you are simply the man who is going to give me back what
belongs to me."
</p><p>He was greatly agitated. He kept on walking to and fro in a small empty
space surrounded by a circle of piled-up furniture, at which he hit out
idiotically, at the risk of bringing it down.
</p><p>Hortense felt that she had the whip hand of him; and, profiting by his
confusion, she said, suddenly, in a commanding and threatening tone:
</p><p>"Where is the thing? You must give it back to me. I insist upon it."
</p><p>Pancaldi gave way to a moment of despair. He folded his hands and mumbled a
few words of entreaty. Then, defeated and suddenly resigned, he said, more
distinctly:
</p><p>"You insist?..."
</p><p>"I do. You must give it to me."
</p><p>"Yes, yes, I must ... I agree."
</p><p>"Speak!" she ordered, more harshly still.
</p><p>"Speak, no, but write: I will write my secret.... And that will be the end
of me."
</p><p>He turned to his desk and feverishly wrote a few lines on a sheet of paper,
which he put into an envelope and sealed it:
</p><p>"See," he said, "here's my secret.... It was my whole life...."
</p><p>And, so saying, he suddenly pressed against his temple a revolver which he
had produced from under a pile of papers and fired.
</p><p>With a quick movement, Hortense struck up his arm. The bullet struck the
mirror of a cheval-glass. But Pancaldi collapsed and began to groan, as
though he were wounded.
</p><p>Hortense made a great effort not to lose her composure:
</p><p>"Rénine warned me," she reflected. "The man's a play-actor. He has kept the
envelope. He has kept his revolver, I won't be taken in by him."
</p><p>Nevertheless, she realized that, despite his apparent calmness, the attempt
at suicide and the revolver-shot had completely unnerved her. All her
energies were dispersed, like the sticks of a bundle whose string has been
cut; and she had a painful impression that the man, who was grovelling at
her feet, was in reality slowly getting the better of her.
</p><p>She sat down, exhausted. As Rénine had foretold, the duel had not lasted
longer than a few minutes but it was she who had succumbed, thanks to her
feminine nerves and at the very moment when she felt entitled to believe
that she had won.
</p><p>The man Pancaldi was fully aware of this; and, without troubling to invent
a transition, he ceased his jeremiads, leapt to his feet, cut a sort of
agile caper before Hortense' eyes and cried, in a jeering tone:
</p><p>"Now we are going to have a little chat; but it would be a nuisance to be
at the mercy of the first passing customer, wouldn't it?"
</p><p>He ran to the street-door, opened it and pulled down the iron shutter which
closed the shop. Then, still hopping and skipping, he came back to
Hortense:
</p><p>"Oof! I really thought I was done for! One more effort, madam, and you
would have pulled it off. But then I'm such a simple chap! It seemed to me
that you had come from the back of beyond, as an emissary of Providence,
to call me to account; and, like a fool, I was about to give the thing
back.... Ah, Mlle. Hortense--let me call you so: I used to know you by that
name--Mlle. Hortense, what you lack, to use a vulgar expression, is gut."
</p><p>He sat down beside her and, with a malicious look, said, savagely:
</p><p>"The time has come to speak out. Who contrived this business? Not you; eh?
It's not in your style. Then who?... I have always been honest in my life,
scrupulously honest ... except once ... in the matter of that clasp. And,
whereas I thought the story was buried and forgotten, here it is suddenly
raked up again. Why? That's what I want to know."
</p><p>Hortense was no longer even attempting to fight. He was bringing to bear
upon her all his virile strength, all his spite, all his fears, all the
threats expressed in his furious gestures and on his features, which were
both ridiculous and evil:
</p><p>"Speak, I want to know. If I have a secret foe, let me defend myself
against him! Who is he? Who sent you here? Who urged you to take action? Is
it a rival incensed by my good luck, who wants in his turn to benefit by
the clasp? Speak, can't you, damn it all ... or, I swear by Heaven, I'll
make you!..."
</p><p>She had an idea that he was reaching out for his revolver and stepped back,
holding her arms before her, in the hope of escaping.
</p><p>They thus struggled against each other; and Hortense, who was becoming
more and more frightened, not so much of the attack as of her assailant's
distorted face, was beginning to scream, when Pancaldi suddenly stood
motionless, with his arms before him, his fingers outstretched and his eyes
staring above Hortense's head:
</p><p>"Who's there? How did you get in?" he asked, in a stifled voice.
</p><p>Hortense did not even need to turn round to feel assured that Rénine was
coming to her assistance and that it was his inexplicable appearance that
was causing the dealer such dismay. As a matter of fact, a slender figure
stole through a heap of easy chairs and sofas: and Rénine came forward with
a tranquil step.
</p><p>"Who are you?" repeated Pancaldi. "Where do you come from?"
</p><p>"From up there," he said, very amiably, pointing to the ceiling.
</p><p>"From up there?"
</p><p>"Yes, from the first floor. I have been the tenant of the floor above this
for the past three months. I heard a noise just now. Some one was calling
out for help. So I came down."
</p><p>"But how did you get in here?"
</p><p>"By the staircase."
</p><p>"What staircase?"
</p><p>"The iron staircase, at the end of the shop. The man who owned it before
you had a flat on my floor and used to go up and down by that hidden
staircase. You had the door shut off. I opened it."
</p><p>"But by what right, sir? It amounts to breaking in."
</p><p>"Breaking in is allowed, when there's a fellow-creature to be rescued."
</p><p>"Once more, who are you?"
</p><p>"Prince Rénine ... and a friend of this lady's," said Rénine, bending over
Hortense and kissing her hand.
</p><p>Pancaldi seemed to be choking, and mumbled:
</p><p>"Oh, I understand!... You instigated the plot ... it was you who sent the
lady...."
</p><p>"It was, M. Pancaldi, it was!"
</p><p>"And what are your intentions?"
</p><p>"My intentions are irreproachable. No violence. Simply a little interview.
When that is over, you will hand over what I in my turn have come to
fetch."
</p><p>"What?"
</p><p>"The clasp."
</p><p>"That, never!" shouted the dealer.
</p><p>"Don't say no. It's a foregone conclusion."
</p><p>"No power on earth, sir, can compel me to do such a thing!"
</p><p>"Shall we send for your wife? Madame Pancaldi will perhaps realize the
position better than you do."
</p><p>The idea of no longer being alone with this unexpected adversary seemed to
appeal to Pancaldi. There was a bell on the table beside him. He struck it
three times.
</p><p>"Capital!" exclaimed Rénine "You see, my dear, M. Pancaldi is becoming
quite amiable. Not a trace left of the devil broken loose who was going for
you just now. No, M. Pancaldi only has to find himself dealing with a man
to recover his qualities of courtesy and kindness. A perfect sheep! Which
does not mean that things will go quite of themselves. Far from it! There's
no more obstinate animal than a sheep...."
</p><p>Right at the end of the shop, between the dealer's writing-desk and the
winding staircase, a curtain was raised, admitting a woman who was holding
a door open. She might have been thirty years of age. Very simply dressed,
she looked, with the apron on her, more like a cook than like the mistress
of a household. But she had an attractive face and a pleasing figure.
</p><p>Hortense, who had followed Rénine, was surprised to recognize her as a maid
whom she had had in her service when a girl:
</p><p>"What! Is that you, Lucienne? Are you Madame Pancaldi?"
</p><p>The newcomer looked at her, recognized her also and seemed embarrassed.
Rénine said to her:
</p><p>"Your husband and I need your assistance, Madame Pancaldi, to settle a
rather complicated matter a matter in which you played an important
part...."
</p><p>She came forward without a word, obviously ill at ease, asking her husband,
who did not take his eyes off her:
</p><p>"What is it?... What do they want with me?... What is he referring to?"
</p><p>"It's about the clasp!" Pancaldi whispered, under his breath.
</p><p>These few words were enough to make Madame Pancaldi realize to the full the
seriousness of her position. And she did not try to keep her countenance or
to retort with futile protests. She sank into a chair, sighing:
</p><p>"Oh, that's it!... I understand.... Mlle. Hortense has found the track....
Oh, it's all up with us!"
</p><p>There was a moment's respite. The struggle between the adversaries had
hardly begun, before the husband and wife adopted the attitude of defeated
persons whose only hope lay in the victor's clemency. Staring motionless
before her, Madame Pancaldi began to cry. Rénine bent over her and said:
</p><p>"Do you mind if we go over the case from the beginning? We shall then
see things more clearly; and I am sure that our interview will lead to a
perfectly natural solution.... This is how things happened: nine years ago,
when you were lady's maid to Mlle. Hortense in the country, you made the
acquaintance of M. Pancaldi, who soon became your lover. You were both of
you Corsicans, in other words, you came from a country where superstitions
are very strong and where questions of good and bad luck, the evil eye, and
spells and charms exert a profound influence over the lives of one and all.
Now it was said that your young mistress' clasp had always brought luck to
its owners. That was why, in a weak moment prompted by M. Pancaldi, you
stole the clasp. Six months afterwards, you became Madame Pancaldi.... That
is your whole story, is it not, told in a few sentences? The whole story
of two people who would have remained honest members of society, if they
had been able to resist that casual temptation?... I need not tell you how
you both succeeded in life and how, possessing the talisman, believing
its powers and trusting in yourselves, you rose to the first rank of
antiquarians. To-day, well-off, owning this shop, "The Mercury," you
attribute the success of your undertakings to that clasp. To lose it would
to your eyes spell bankruptcy and poverty. Your whole life has been centred
upon it. It is your fetish. It is the little household god who watches over
you and guides your steps. It is there, somewhere, hidden in this jungle;
and no one of course would ever have suspected anything--for I repeat, you
are decent people, but for this one lapse--if an accident had not led me to
look into your affairs."
</p><p>Rénine paused and continued:
</p><p>"That was two months ago, two months of minute investigations, which
presented no difficulty to me, because, having discovered your trail, I
hired the flat overhead and was able to use that staircase ... but, all
the same, two months wasted to a certain extent because I have not yet
succeeded. And Heaven knows how I have ransacked this shop of yours! There
is not a piece of furniture that I have left unsearched, not a plank in
the floor that I have not inspected. All to no purpose. Yes, there was one
thing, an incidental discovery. In a secret recess in your writing-table,
Pancaldi, I turned up a little account-book in which you have set down your
remorse, your uneasiness, your fear of punishment and your dread of God's
wrath.... It was highly imprudent of you, Pancaldi! People don't write
such confessions! And, above all, they don't leave them lying about! Be
this as it may, I read them and I noted one passage, which struck me
as particularly important and was of use to me in preparing my plan of
campaign: 'Should she come to me, the woman whom I robbed, should she come
to me as I saw her in her garden, while Lucienne was taking the clasp;
should she appear to me wearing the blue gown and the toque of red leaves,
with the jet necklace and the whip of three plaited rushes which she was
carrying that day; should she appear to me thus and say: "I have come to
claim my property," then I shall understand that her conduct is inspired
from on high and that I must obey the decree of Providence.' That is what
is written in your book, Pancaldi, and it explains the conduct of the lady
whom you call Mlle. Hortense. Acting on my instructions and in accordance
with the setting thought out by yourself, she came to you, from the back of
beyond, to use your own expression. A little more self-possession on her
part; and you know that she would have won the day. Unfortunately, you are
a wonderful actor; your sham suicide put her out; and you understood that
this was not a decree of Providence, but simply an offensive on the part of
your former victim. I had no choice, therefore, but to intervene. Here I
am.... And now let's finish the business. Pancaldi, that clasp!"
</p><p>"No," said the dealer, who seemed to recover all his energy at the very
thought of restoring the clasp.
</p><p>"And you, Madame Pancaldi."
</p><p>"I don't know where it is," the wife declared.
</p><p>"Very well. Then let us come to deeds. Madame Pancaldi, you have a son of
seven whom you love with all your heart. This is Thursday and, as on every
Thursday, your little boy is to come home alone from his aunt's. Two of my
friends are posted on the road by which he returns and, in the absence of
instructions to the contrary, will kidnap him as he passes."
</p><p>Madame Pancaldi lost her head at once:
</p><p>"My son! Oh, please, please ... not that!... I swear that I know nothing.
My husband would never consent to confide in me."
</p><p>Rénine continued:
</p><p>"Next point. This evening, I shall lodge an information with the public
prosecutor. Evidence: the confessions in the account-book. Consequences:
action by the police, search of the premises and the rest."
</p><p>Pancaldi was silent. The others had a feeling that all these threats did
not affect him and that, protected by his fetish, he believed himself
to be invulnerable. But his wife fell on her knees at Rénine's feet and
stammered:
</p><p>"No, no ... I entreat you!... It would mean going to prison and I don't
want to go!... And then my son!... Oh, I entreat you!..."
</p><p>Hortense, seized with compassion, took Rénine to one side:
</p><p>"Poor woman! Let me intercede for her."
</p><p>"Set your mind at rest," he said. "Nothing is going to happen to her son."
</p><p>"But your two friends?"
</p><p>"Sheer bluff."
</p><p>"Your application to the public prosecutor?"
</p><p>"A mere threat."
</p><p>"Then what are you trying to do?"
</p><p>"To frighten them out of their wits, in the hope of making them drop a
remark, a word, which will tell us what we want to know. We've tried every
other means. This is the last; and it is a method which, I find, nearly
always succeeds. Remember our adventures."
</p><p>"But if the word which you expect to hear is not spoken?"
</p><p>"It must be spoken," said Rénine, in a low voice. "We must finish the
matter. The hour is at hand."
</p><p>His eyes met hers; and she blushed crimson at the thought that the hour to
which he was alluding was the eighth and that he had no other object than
to finish the matter before that eighth hour struck.
</p><p>"So you see, on the one hand, what you are risking," he said to the
Pancaldi pair. "The disappearance of your child ... and prison: prison for
certain, since there is the book with its confessions. And now, on the
other hand, here's my offer: twenty thousand francs if you hand over the
clasp immediately, this minute. Remember, it isn't worth three louis."
</p><p>No reply. Madame Pancaldi was crying.
</p><p>Rénine resumed, pausing between each proposal:
</p><p>"I'll double my offer.... I'll treble it.... Hang it all, Pancaldi, you're
unreasonable!... I suppose you want me to make it a round sum? All right: a
hundred thousand francs."
</p><p>He held out his hand as if there was no doubt that they would give him the
clasp.
</p><p>Madame Pancaldi was the first to yield and did so with a sudden outburst of
rage against her husband:
</p><p>"Well, confess, can't you?... Speak up!... Where have you hidden it?...
Look here, you aren't going to be obstinate, what? If you are, it means
ruin ... and poverty.... And then there's our boy!... Speak out, do!"
</p><p>Hortense whispered:
</p><p>"Rénine, this is madness; the clasp has no value...."
</p><p>"Never fear," said Rénine, "he's not going to accept.... But look at
him.... How excited he is! Exactly what I wanted.... Ah, this, you know,
is really exciting!... To make people lose their heads! To rob them of all
control over what they are thinking and saying!... And, in the midst of
this confusion, in the storm that tosses them to and fro, to catch sight of
the tiny spark which will flash forth somewhere or other!... Look at him!
Look at the fellow! A hundred thousand francs for a valueless pebble ... if
not, prison: it's enough to turn any man's head!"
</p><p>Pancaldi, in fact, was grey in the face; his lips were trembling and a
drop of saliva was trickling from their corners. It was easy to guess the
seething turmoil of his whole being, shaken by conflicting emotions, by the
clash between greed and fear. Suddenly he burst out; and it was obvious
that his words were pouring forth at random, without his knowing in the
least what he was saying:
</p><p>"A hundred thousand francs! Two hundred thousand! Five hundred thousand! A
million! A two fig for your millions! What's the use of millions? One loses
them. They disappear.... They go.... There's only one thing that counts:
luck. It's on your side or else against you. And luck has been on my side
these last nine years. It has never betrayed me; and you expect me to
betray it? Why? Out of fear? Prison? My son? Bosh!... No harm will come to
me so long as I compel luck to work on my behalf. It's my servant, it's my
friend. It clings to the clasp. How? How can I tell? It's the cornelian,
no doubt.... There are magic stones, which hold happiness, as others hold
fire, or sulphur, or gold...."
</p><p>Rénine kept his eyes fixed upon him, watching for the least word, the least
modulation of the voice. The curiosity-dealer was now laughing, with a
nervous laugh, while resuming the self-control of a man who feels sure of
himself: and he walked up to Rénine with jerky movements that revealed an
increasing resolution:
</p><p>"Millions? My dear sir, I wouldn't have them as a gift. The little bit of
stone which I possess is worth much more than that. And the proof of it
lies in all the pains which you are at to take it from me. Aha! Months
devoted to looking for it, as you yourself confess! Months in which you
turned everything topsy-turvy, while I, who suspected nothing, did not even
defend myself! Why should I? The little thing defended itself all alone....
It does not want to be discovered and it sha'n't be.... It likes being
here.... It presides over a good, honest business that satisfies it....
Pancaldi's luck! Why, it's known to all the neighbourhood, among all the
dealers! I proclaim it from the house-tops: 'I'm a lucky man!' I even made
so bold as to take the god of luck, Mercury, as my patron! He too protects
me. See, I've got Mercuries all over my shop! Look up there, on that shelf,
a whole row of statuettes, like the one over the front-door, proofs signed
by a great sculptor who went smash and sold them to me.... Would you like
one, my dear sir? It will bring you luck too. Take your pick! A present
from Pancaldi, to make up to you for your defeat! Does that suit you?"
</p><p>He put a stool against the wall, under the shelf, took down a statuette and
plumped it into Rénine's arms. And, laughing heartily, growing more and
more excited as his enemy seemed to yield ground and to fall back before
his spirited attack, he explained:
</p><p>"Well done! He accepts! And the fact that he accepts shows that we are all
agreed! Madame Pancaldi, don't distress yourself. Your son's coming back
and nobody's going to prison! Good-bye, Mlle. Hortense! Good-day, sir!
Hope to see you again! If you want to speak to me at any time, just give
three thumps on the ceiling. Good-bye ... don't forget your present ...
and may Mercury be kind to you! Good-bye, my dear Prince! Good-bye, Mlle.
Hortense!..."
</p><p>He hustled them to the iron staircase, gripped each of them by the arm in
turn and pushed them up to the little door hidden at the top of the stairs.
</p><p>And the strange thing was that Rénine made no protest. He did not attempt
to resist. He allowed himself to be led along like a naughty child that is
taken up to bed.
</p><p>Less than five minutes had elapsed between the moment when he made his
offer to Pancaldi and the moment when Pancaldi turned him out of the shop
with a statuette in his arms.
</p><hr/>
<p>The dining-room and drawing-room of the flat which Rénine had taken on the
first floor looked out upon the street. The table in the dining-room was
laid for two.
</p><p>"Forgive me, won't you?" said Rénine, as he opened the door of the
drawing-room for Hortense. "I thought that, whatever happened, I should
most likely see you this evening and that we might as well dine together.
Don't refuse me this kindness, which will be the last favour granted in our
last adventure."
</p><p>Hortense did not refuse him. The manner in which the battle had ended was
so different from everything that she had seen hitherto that she felt
disconcerted. At any rate, why should she refuse, seeing that the terms of
the contract had not been fulfilled?
</p><p>Rénine left the room to give an order to his manservant. Two minutes later,
he came back for Hortense. It was then a little past seven.
</p><p>There were flowers on the table; and the statue of Mercury, Pancaldi's
present, stood overtopping them.
</p><p>"May the god of luck preside over our repast," said Rénine.
</p><p>He was full of animation and expressed his great delight at having her
sitting opposite him:
</p><p>"Yes," he exclaimed, "I had to resort to powerful means and attract you by
the bait of the most fabulous enterprises. You must confess that my letter
was jolly smart! The three rushes, the blue gown; simply irresistible!
And, when I had thrown in a few puzzles of my own invention, such as the
seventy-five beads of the necklace and the old woman with the silver
rosary, I knew that you were bound to succumb to the temptation. Don't be
angry with me. I wanted to see you and I wanted it to be today. You have
come and I thank you."
</p><p>He next told her how he had got on the track of the stolen trinket:
</p><p>"You hoped, didn't you, in laying down that condition, that I shouldn't be
able to fulfil it? You made a mistake, my dear. The test, at least at the
beginning, was easy enough, because it was based upon an undoubted fact:
the talismanic character attributed to the clasp. I had only to hunt about
and see whether among the people around you, among your servants, there was
ever any one upon whom that character may have exercised some attraction.
Now, on the list of persons which I succeeded in drawing up. I at once
noticed the name of Mlle. Lucienne, as coming from Corsica. This was my
starting-point. The rest was a mere concatenation of events."
</p><p>Hortense stared at him in amazement. How was it that he was accepting his
defeat with such a careless air and even talking in a tone of triumph,
whereas really he had been soundly beaten by Pancaldi and even made to look
just a trifle ridiculous?
</p><p>She could not help letting him feel this; and the fashion in which she did
so betrayed a certain disappointment, a certain humiliation:
</p><p>"Everything is a concatenation of events: very well. But the chain is
broken, because, when all is said, though you know the thief, you did not
succeed in laying hands upon the stolen clasp."
</p><p>The reproach was obvious. Rénine had not accustomed her to failure. And
furthermore she was irritated to see how heedlessly he was accepting a
blow which, after all, entailed the ruin of any hopes that he might have
entertained.
</p><p>He did not reply. He had filled their two glasses with champagne and was
slowly emptying his own, with his eyes fixed on the statuette of Mercury.
He turned it about on its pedestal and examined it with the eye of a
delighted connoisseur:
</p><p>"What a beautiful thing is a harmonious line! Colour does not uplift me
so much as outline, proportion, symmetry and all the wonderful properties
of form. Look at this little statue. Pancaldi's right: it's the work of
a great artist. The legs are both slender and muscular; the whole figure
gives an impression of buoyancy and speed. It is very well done. There's
only one fault, a very slight one: perhaps you've not noticed it?"
</p><p>"Yes, I have," said Hortense. "It struck me the moment I saw the sign,
outside. You mean, don't you, a certain lack of balance? The god is leaning
over too far on the leg that carries him. He looks as though he were going
to pitch forward."
</p><p>"That's very clever of you," said Rénine. "The fault is almost
imperceptible and it needs a trained eye to see it. Really, however, as
a matter of logic, the weight of the body ought to have its way and, in
accordance with natural laws, the little god ought to take a header."
</p><p>After a pause he continued:
</p><p>"I noticed that flaw on the first day. How was it that I did not draw an
inference at once? I was shocked because the artist had sinned against
an aesthetic law, whereas I ought to have been shocked because he had
overlooked a physical law. As though art and nature were not blended
together! And as though the laws of gravity could be disturbed without
some fundamental reason!"
</p><p>"What do you mean?" asked Hortense, puzzled by these reflections, which
seemed so far removed from their secret thoughts. "What do you mean?"
</p><p>"Oh, nothing!" he said. "I am only surprised that I didn't understand
sooner why Mercury did not plump forward, as he should have done."
</p><p>"And what is the reason?"
</p><p>"The reason? I imagine that Pancaldi, when pulling the statuette about to
make it serve his purpose, must have disturbed its balance, but that this
balance was restored by something which holds the little god back and which
makes up for his really too dangerous posture."
</p><p>"Something, you say?"
</p><p>"Yes, a counterweight."
</p><p>Hortense gave a start. She too was beginning to see a little light. She
murmured:
</p><p>"A counterweight?... Are you thinking that it might be ... in the
pedestal?"
</p><p>"Why not?"
</p><p>"Is that possible? But, if so, how did Pancaldi come to give you this
statuette?"
</p><p>"He never gave me <u>this</u> one," Rénine declared. "I took this one
myself."
</p><p>"But where? And when?"
</p><p>"Just now, while you were in the drawing-room. I got out of that window,
which is just over the signboard and beside the niche containing the little
god. And I exchanged the two, that is to say, I took the statue which was
outside and put the one which Pancaldi gave me in its place."
</p><p>"But doesn't that one lean forward?"
</p><p>"No, no more than the others do, on the shelf in his shop. But Pancaldi
is not an artist. A lack of equilibrium does not impress him; he will see
nothing wrong; and he will continue to think himself favoured by luck,
which is another way of saying that luck will continue to favour him.
Meanwhile, here's the statuette, the one used for the sign. Am I to break
the pedestal and take your clasp out of the leaden sheath, soldered to the
back of the pedestal, which keeps Mercury steady?"
</p><p>"No, no, there's no need for that," Hortense hurriedly murmured.
</p><p>Rénine's intuition, his subtlety, the skill with which he had managed the
whole business: to her, for the moment, all these things remained in the
background. But she suddenly remembered that the eighth adventure was
completed, that Rénine had surmounted every obstacle, that the test had
turned to his advantage and that the extreme limit of time fixed for the
last of the adventures was not yet reached.
</p><p>He had the cruelty to call attention to the fact:
</p><p>"A quarter to eight," he said.
</p><p>An oppressive silence fell between them. Both felt its discomfort to such
a degree that they hesitated to make the least movement. In order to break
it, Rénine jested:
</p><p>"That worthy M. Pancaldi, how good it was of him to tell me what I wished
to know! I knew, however, that by exasperating him, I should end by picking
up the missing clue in what he said. It was just as though one were to hand
some one a flint and steel and suggest to him that he was to use it. In the
end, the spark is obtained. In my case, what produced the spark was the
unconscious but inevitable comparison which he drew between the cornelian
clasp, the element of luck, and Mercury, the god of luck. That was enough.
I understood that this association of ideas arose from his having actually
associated the two factors of luck by embodying one in the other, or, to
speak more plainly, by hiding the trinket in the statuette. And I at once
remembered the Mercury outside the door and its defective poise...."
</p><p>Rénine suddenly interrupted himself. It seemed to him that all his remarks
were falling on deaf ears. Hortense had put her hand to her forehead and,
thus veiling her eyes, sat motionless and remote.
</p><p>She was indeed not listening. The end of this particular adventure and the
manner in which Rénine had acted on this occasion no longer interested her.
What she was thinking of was the complex series of adventures amid which
she had been living for the past three months and the wonderful behaviour
of the man who had offered her his devotion. She saw, as in a magic
picture, the fabulous deeds performed by him, all the good that he had
done, the lives saved, the sorrows assuaged, the order restored wherever
his masterly will had been brought to bear. Nothing was impossible to
him. What he undertook to do he did. Every aim that he set before him
was attained in advance. And all this without excessive effort, with the
calmness of one who knows his own strength and knows that nothing can
resist it.
</p><p>Then what could she do against him? Why should she defend herself and how?
If he demanded that she should yield, would he not know how to make her do
so and would this last adventure be any more difficult for him than the
others? Supposing that she ran away: did the wide world contain a retreat
in which she would be safe from his pursuit? From the first moment of their
first meeting, the end was certain, since Rénine had decreed that it should
be so.
</p><p>However, she still cast about for weapons, for protection of some sort; and
she said to herself that, though he had fulfilled the eight conditions and
restored the cornelian clasp to her before the eighth hour had struck, she
was nevertheless protected by the fact that this eighth hour was to strike
on the clock of the Château de Halingre and not elsewhere. It was a formal
compact. Rénine had said that day, gazing on the lips which he longed to
kiss:
</p><p>"The old brass pendulum will start swinging again; and, when, on the fixed
date, the clock once more strikes eight, then...."
</p><p>She looked up. He was not moving either, but sat solemnly, patiently
waiting.
</p><p>She was on the point of saying, she was even preparing her words:
</p><p>"You know, our agreement says it must be the Halingre clock. All the other
conditions have been fulfilled ... but not this one. So I am free, am I
not? I am entitled not to keep my promise, which, moreover, I never made,
but which in any case falls to the ground?... And I am perfectly free ...
released from any scruple of conscience?..."
</p><p>She had not time to speak. At that precise moment, there was a click behind
her, like that of a clock about to strike.
</p><p>A first stroke sounded, then a second, then a third.
</p><p>Hortense moaned. She had recognized the very sound of the old clock, the
Halingre clock, which three months ago, by breaking in a supernatural
manner the silence of the deserted château, had set both of them on the
road of the eight adventures.
</p><p>She counted the strokes. The clock struck eight.
</p><p>"Ah!" she murmured, half swooning and hiding her face in her hands. "The
clock ... the clock is here ... the one from over there ... I recognize its
voice...."
</p><p>She said no more. She felt that Rénine had his eyes fixed upon her and this
sapped all her energies. Besides, had she been able to recover them, she
would have been no better off nor sought to offer him the least resistance,
for the reason that she did not wish to resist. All the adventures were
over, but one remained to be undertaken, the anticipation of which wiped
out the memory of all the rest. It was the adventure of love, the most
delightful, the most bewildering, the most adorable of all adventures. She
accepted fate's decree, rejoicing in all that might come, because she was
in love. She smiled in spite of herself, as she reflected that happiness
was again to enter her life at the very moment when her well-beloved was
bringing her the cornelian clasp.
</p><p>The clock struck the hour for the second time.
</p><p>Hortense raised her eyes to Rénine. She struggled a few seconds longer. But
she was like a charmed bird, incapable of any movement of revolt; and at
the eighth stroke she fell upon his breast and offered him her lips....
</p><p><strong>THE END</strong>
