<p>In Shoreby Abbey Church the prayers were kept up all night without
cessation, now with the singing of psalms, now with a note or two upon
the bell.
</p><p>Rutter, the spy, was nobly waked. There he lay, meanwhile, as they had
arranged him, his dead hands crossed upon his bosom, his dead eyes
staring on the roof; and hard by, in the stall, the lad who had slain
him waited, in sore disquietude, the coming of the morning.
</p><p>Once only, in the course of the hours, Sir Oliver leaned across to his
captive.
</p><p>"Richard," he whispered, "my son, if ye mean me evil, I will certify, on
my soul's welfare, ye design upon an innocent man. Sinful in the eye of
Heaven I do declare myself; but sinful as against you I am not, neither
have been ever."
</p><p>"My father," returned Dick, in the same tone of voice, "trust me, I
design nothing; but as for your innocence, I may not forget that ye
cleared yourself but lamely."
</p><p>"A man may be innocently guilty," replied the priest. "He may be set
blindfolded upon a mission, ignorant of its true scope. So it was with
me. I did decoy your father to his death; but as Heaven sees us in this
sacred place, I knew not what I did."
</p><p>"It may be," returned Dick. "But see what a strange web ye have woven,
that I should be, at this hour, at once your prisoner and your judge;
that ye should both threaten my days and deprecate my anger. Methinks,
if ye had been all your life a true man and good priest, ye would
neither thus fear nor thus detest me. And now to your prayers. I do obey
you, since needs must; but I will not be burthened with your company."
</p><p>The priest uttered a sigh so heavy that it had almost touched the lad
into some sentiment of pity, and he bowed his head upon his hands like a
man borne down below a weight of care. He joined no longer in the
psalms; but Dick could hear the beads rattle though his fingers and the
prayers a-pattering between his teeth.
</p><p>Yet a little, and the grey of the morning began to struggle through the
painted casements of the church, and to put to shame the glimmer of the
tapers. The light slowly broadened and brightened, and presently through
the southeastern clerestories a flush of rosy sunlight flickered on the
walls. The storm was over; the great clouds had disburthened their snow
and fled farther on, and the new day was breaking on a merry winter
landscape sheathed in white.
</p><p>A bustle of church officers followed; the bier was carried forth to the
deadhouse, and the stains of blood were cleansed from off the tiles,
that no such ill-omened spectacle should disgrace the marriage of Lord
Shoreby. At the same time, the very ecclesiastics who had been so
dismally engaged all night began to put on morning faces, to do honour
to the merrier ceremony which was about to follow. And further to
announce the coming of the day, the pious of the town began to assemble
and fall to prayer before their favourite shrines, or wait their turn at
the confessionals.
</p><p>Favoured by this stir, it was of course easily possible for any man to
avoid the vigilance of Sir Daniel's sentries at the door; and presently
Dick, looking about him wearily, caught the eye of no less a person than
Will Lawless, still in his monk's habit.
</p><p>The outlaw, at the same moment, recognised his leader, and privily
signed to him with hand and eye.
</p><p>Now, Dick was far from having forgiven the old rogue his most untimely
drunkenness, but he had no desire to involve him in his own predicament;
and he signalled back to him, as plain as he was able, to begone.
</p><p>Lawless, as though he had understood, disappeared at once behind a
pillar, and Dick breathed again.
</p><p>What, then, was his dismay to feel himself plucked by the sleeve and to
find the old robber installed beside him, upon the next seat, and, to
all appearance, plunged in his devotions!
</p><p>Instantly Sir Oliver arose from his place, and, gliding behind the
stalls, made for the soldiers in the aisle. If the priest's suspicions
had been so lightly wakened, the harm was already done, and Lawless a
prisoner in the church.
</p><p>"Move not," whispered Dick. "We are in the plaguiest pass, thanks,
before all things, to thy swinishness of yestereven. When ye saw me
here, so strangely seated where I have neither right nor interest, what
a murrain! could ye not smell harm and get ye gone from evil?"
</p><p>"Nay," returned Lawless, "I thought ye had heard from Ellis, and were
here on duty."
</p><p>"Ellis!" echoed Dick. "Is Ellis, then, returned?"
</p><p>"For sure," replied the outlaw. "He came last night, and belted me sore
for being in wine--so there ye are avenged, my master. A furious man is
Ellis Duckworth! He hath ridden me hot-spur from Craven to prevent this
marriage; and, Master Dick, ye know the way of him--do so he will!"
</p><p>"Nay, then," returned Dick, with composure, "you and I, my poor brother,
are dead men; for I sit here a prisoner upon suspicion, and my neck was
to answer for this very marriage that he purposeth to mar. I had a fair
choice, by the rood! to lose my sweetheart or else lose my life! Well,
the cast is thrown--it is to be my life."
</p><p>"By the mass," cried Lawless, half arising, "I am gone!"
</p><p>But Dick had his hand at once upon his shoulder.
</p><p>"Friend Lawless, sit ye still," he said. "An ye have eyes, look yonder
at the corner by the chancel arch; see ye not that, even upon the motion
of your rising, yon armed men are up and ready to intercept you? Yield
ye, friend. Ye were bold aboard ship, when ye thought to die a
sea-death; be bold again, now that y'are to die presently upon the
gallows."
</p><p>"Master Dick," gasped Lawless, "the thing hath come upon me somewhat of
the suddenest. But give me a moment till I fetch my breath again; and,
by the mass, I will be as stout-hearted as yourself."
</p><p>"Here is my bold fellow!" returned Dick. "And yet, Lawless, it goes
hard against the grain with me to die; but where whining mendeth
nothing, wherefore whine?"
</p><p>"Nay, that indeed!" chimed Lawless. "And a fig for death, at worst! It
has to be done, my master, soon or late. And hanging in a good quarrel
is an easy death, they say, though I could never hear of any that came
back to say so."
</p><p>And so saying, the stout old rascal leaned back in his stall, folded his
arms, and began to look about him with the greatest air of insolence and
unconcern.
</p><p>"And for the matter of that," Dick added, "it is yet our best chance to
keep quiet. We wot not yet what Duckworth purposes; and when all is
said, and if the worst befall, we may yet clear our feet of it."
</p><p>Now that they ceased talking, they were aware of a very distant and thin
strain of mirthful music which steadily drew nearer, louder, and
merrier. The bells in the tower began to break forth into a doubling
peal, and a greater and greater concourse of people to crowd into the
church, shuffling the snow from off their feet, and clapping and blowing
in their hands. The western door was flung wide open, showing a glimpse
of sunlit, snowy street, and admitting in a great gust the shrewd air of
the morning; and in short, it became plain by every sign that Lord
Shoreby desired to be married very early in the day, and that the
wedding-train was drawing near.
</p><p>Some of Lord Shoreby's men now cleared a passage down the middle aisle,
forcing the people back with lance-stocks; and just then, outside the
portal, the secular musicians could be descried drawing near over the
frozen snow, the fifers and trumpeters scarlet in the face with lusty
blowing, the drummers and the cymbalists beating as for a wager.
</p><p>These, as they drew near the door of the sacred building, filed off on
either side, and, marking time to their own vigorous music, stood
stamping in the snow. As they thus opened their ranks, the leaders of
this noble bridal train appeared behind and between them; and such was
the variety and gaiety of their attire, such the displays of silk and
velvet, fur and satin, embroidery and lace, that the procession showed
forth upon the snow like a flower-bed in a path or a painted window in a
wall.
</p><p>First came the bride, a sorry sight, as pale as winter, clinging to Sir
Daniel's arm, and attended, as bridesmaid, by the short young lady who
had befriended Dick the night before. Close behind, in the most radiant
toilet, followed the bridegroom, halting on a gouty foot; and as he
passed the threshold of the sacred building and doffed his hat, his bald
head was seen to be rosy with emotion.
</p><p>And now came the hour of Ellis Duckworth.
</p><p>Dick, who sat stunned among contrary emotions, grasping the desk in
front of him, beheld a movement in the crowd, people jostling backward,
and eyes and arms uplifted. Following these signs, he beheld three or
four men with bent bows, leaning from the clerestory gallery. At the
same instant they delivered their discharge, and before the clamour and
cries of the astounded populace had time to swell fully upon the ear,
they had flitted from their perch and disappeared.
</p><p>The nave was full of swaying heads and voices screaming; the
ecclesiastics thronged in terror from their places; the music ceased,
and though the bells overhead continued for some seconds to clang upon
the air, some wind of the disaster seemed to find its way at last even
to the chamber where the ringers were leaping on their ropes, and they
also desisted from their merry labours.
</p><p>Right in the midst of the nave the bridegroom lay stone-dead, pierced by
two black arrows. The bride had fainted. Sir Daniel stood, towering
above the crowd in his surprise and anger, a cloth-yard shaft quivering
in his left forearm, and his face streaming blood from another which had
grazed his brow.
</p><p>Long before any search could be made for them, the authors of this
tragic interruption had clattered down a turn-pike stair and decamped by
a postern door.
</p><p>But Dick and Lawless still remained in pawn; they had, indeed, arisen on
the first alarm, and pushed manfully to gain the door; but what with the
narrowness of the stalls and the crowding of terrified priests and
choristers, the attempt had been in vain, and they had stoically resumed
their places.
</p><p>And now, pale with horror, Sir Oliver rose to his feet and called upon
Sir Daniel, pointing with one hand to Dick.
</p><p>"Here," he cried, "is Richard Shelton--alas the hour!--blood guilty!
Seize him!--bid him be seized! For all our lives' sakes, take him and
bind him surely! He hath sworn our fall."
</p><p>Sir Daniel was blinded by anger--blinded by the hot blood that still
streamed across his face.
</p><p>[Illustration: <u>First came the bride, a sorry sight, as pale as the
winter, clinging to Sir Daniel's arm</u>]
</p><p>"Where?" he bellowed. "Hale him forth! By the cross of Holywood, but he
shall rue this hour!"
</p><p>The crowd fell back, and a party of archers invaded the choir, laid
rough hands on Dick, dragged him head-foremost from the stall, and
thrust him by the shoulders down the chancel steps. Lawless, on his
part, sat as still as a mouse.
</p><p>Sir Daniel, brushing the blood out of his eyes, stared blinkingly upon
his captive.
</p><p>"Ay," he said, "treacherous and insolent, I have thee fast; and by all
potent oaths, for every drop of blood that now trickles in mine eyes, I
will wring a groan out of thy carcase. Away with him!" he added. "Here
is no place! Off with him to my house. I will number every joint of thy
body with a torture."
</p><p>But Dick, putting off his captors, uplifted his voice.
</p><p>"Sanctuary!" he shouted. "Sanctuary! Ho, there, my fathers! They would
drag me from the church!"
</p><p>"From the church thou hast defiled with murder, boy," added a tall man,
magnificently dressed.
</p><p>"On what probation?" cried Dick. "They do accuse me, indeed, of some
complicity, but have not proved one tittle. I was, in truth, a suitor
for this damsel's hand; and she, I will be bold to say it, repaid my
suit with favour. But what then? To love a maid is no offence, I
trow--nay, nor to gain her love. In all else, I stand here free from
guiltiness."
</p><p>There was a murmur of approval among the bystanders, so boldly Dick
declared his innocence; but at the same time a throng of accusers arose
upon the other side, crying how he had been found last night in Sir
Daniel's house, how he wore a sacrilegious disguise; and in the midst of
the babel, Sir Oliver indicated Lawless, both by voice and gesture, as
accomplice to the fact. He, in his turn, was dragged from his seat and
set beside his leader. The feelings of the crowd rose high on either
side, and while some dragged the prisoners to and fro to favour their
escape, others cursed and struck them with their fists. Dick's ears rang
and his brain swam dizzily, like a man struggling in the eddies of a
furious river.
</p><p>But the tall man who had already answered Dick, by a prodigious exercise
of voice restored silence and order in the mob.
</p><p>"Search them," he said, "for arms. We may so judge of their intentions."
</p><p>Upon Dick they found no weapon but his poniard, and this told in his
favour, until one man officiously drew it from its sheath, and found it
still uncleansed of the blood of Rutter. At this there was a great shout
among Sir Daniel's followers, which the tall man suppressed by a gesture
and an imperious glance. But when it came to the turn of Lawless, there
was found under his gown a sheaf of arrows identical with those that had
been shot.
</p><p>"How say ye now?" asked the tall man, frowningly, of Dick.
</p><p>"Sir," replied Dick, "I am here in sanctuary, is it not so? Well, sir, I
see by your bearing that ye are high in station, and I read in your
countenance the marks of piety and justice. To you, then, I will yield
me prisoner, and that blithely, foregoing the advantage of this holy
place. But rather than to be yielded into the discretion of that
man--whom I do here accuse with a loud voice to be the murderer of my
natural father and the unjust retainer of my lands and revenues--rather
than that, I would beseech you, under favour, with your own gentle hand,
to despatch me on the spot. Your own ears have heard him, how before
that I was proven guilty he did threaten me with torments. It standeth
not with your own honour to deliver me to my sworn enemy and old
oppressor, but to try me fairly by the way of law, and, if that I be
guilty indeed, to slay me mercifully."
</p><p>"My lord," cried Sir Daniel, "ye will not hearken to this wolf? His
bloody dagger reeks him the lie into his face."
</p><p>"Nay, but suffer me, good knight," returned the tall stranger; "your own
vehemence doth somewhat tell against yourself."
</p><p>And here the bride, who had come to herself some minutes past and looked
wildly on upon this scene, broke loose from those that held her, and
fell upon her knees before the last speaker.
</p><p>"My Lord of Risingham," she cried, "hear me, in justice. I am here in
this man's custody by mere force, reft from mine own people. Since that
day I had never pity, countenance, nor comfort from the face of man--but
from him only--Richard Shelton--whom they now accuse and labour to undo.
My lord, if he was yesternight in Sir Daniel's mansion, it was I that
brought him there; he came but at my prayer, and thought to do no hurt.
While yet Sir Daniel was a good lord to him, he fought with them of the
Black Arrow loyally; but when his foul guardian sought his life by
practices, and he fled by night, for his soul's sake, out of that bloody
house, whither was he to turn--he, helpless and penniless? Or if he be
fallen among ill company, whom should ye blame--the lad that was
unjustly handled, or the guardian that did abuse his trust?"
</p><p>And then the short young lady fell on her knees by Joanna's side.
</p><p>"And I, my good lord and natural uncle," she added, "I can bear
testimony, on my conscience and before the face of all, that what this
maiden saith is true. It was I, unworthy, that did lead the young man
in."
</p><p>Earl Risingham had heard in silence, and when the voices ceased, he
still stood silent for a space. Then he gave Joanna his hand to arise,
though it was to be observed that he did not offer the like courtesy to
her who had called herself his niece.
</p><p>"Sir Daniel," he said, "here is a right intricate affair, the which,
with your good leave, it shall be mine to examine and adjust. Content
ye, then; your business is in careful hands; justice shall be done you;
and in the meanwhile, get ye incontinently home, and have your hurts
attended. The air is shrewd, and I would not ye took cold upon these
scratches."
</p><p>He made a sign with his hand; it was passed down the nave by obsequious
servants, who waited there upon his smallest gesture. Instantly, without
the church, a tucket sounded shrill, and through the open portal archers
and men-at-arms, uniformly arrayed in the colours and wearing the badge
of Lord Risingham, began to file into the church, took Dick and Lawless
from those who still detained them, and closing their files about the
prisoners, marched forth again and disappeared.
</p><p>As they were passing, Joanna held both her hands to Dick and cried him
her farewell; and the bridesmaid, nothing downcast by her uncle's
evident displeasure, blew him a kiss, with a "Keep your heart up,
lion-driver!" that for the first time since the accident called up a
smile to the faces of the crowd.
