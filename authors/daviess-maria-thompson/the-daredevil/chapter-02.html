<p>And after that first day there were many hours that the Capitaine, the
Count de Lasselles, spent with little Pierre and the good Nannette, as
she sat knitting always with the sun on the water reddening her round
cheeks, while I had much pleasure with many friends who came to me
upon the ship.
</p><p>A very fine young man who was named William Raines, from the State of
Saint Louis, instructed me in several beautiful dances, but I do not
think he was held in the esteem which he deserved by another of his
American brothers by the name of Peter Scudder, whose home was in the
town of Philadelphia.
</p><p>"Dancing with Scudder must be like going to your grandmother's funeral
over the old State Road in a rockaway," was the comment that Mr.
William Raines made upon his friend Mr.
</p><p>Peter Scudder, and what Mr. Scudder said of him was of the same
unkindness.
</p><p>"Raines' dancing is extremely like Saint Louis: delightfully rapid but
crude," was his comment.
</p><p>I should have been regretful of the unkindness between those two very
nice Americans but for a beautiful good to France that was brought
about by the desire of each to please me more than the other.
</p><p>The many ladies upon the ship had been of exceeding kindness to me
because of the loveliness of small Pierre's dark face and the pity of
his crooked back. Old Nannette was of a very great popularity with all
of those ladies and she spent many hours in recounting the glories of
the old Chateau de Grez and Bye and the family which had inhabited it
since the fourteenth century. So it came about that many friends were
made for France among them.
</p><p>Now that Mr. William Raines had a very nice idea to invite in my honor
all of the ladies who were friends to me, and many distinguished
gentlemen of politics and of universities and other large affairs, who
were returning from business in Europe to more business in America, to
be present while a young boy of France, who was among those in the
steerage going to the freedom of America with his mother who had been
widowed at Ypres, sang in a very lovely voice many French folk songs
and songs of war to all present. And at that singing many tears flowed
and so much money was put into the hands of the boy that a future for
the very sad little French family was assured in America. And I also
wept. I was taken into the embrace of all of those kind American women
and assured of so much care and affection in that land of my father,
that I felt of a very great richness in spite of the small sum of
money in the heel of Nannette's rough stocking. And as I received all
of these beautiful attentions I perceived the eyes of my Capitaine,
the Count de Lasselles, fixed upon me with a deep gratitude and pride.
It was all of a great pleasure to me except that I did not like very
well to be so distinguished by a young man, which made the French
<u>grande dame</u> in me to shrink.
</p><p>"<u>Mais, vive la France</u>," I murmured to myself and was happy
again.
</p><p>But, alas! At the joy of all this entertainment there was one sadness.
It was of my dear friend, Mr. Peter Scudder. There was no pleasure,
but great seriousness, in his face during the whole afternoon.
</p><p>"Don't mind him; poor Pete's chewing a grouch," was what his good
friend Mr. William Raines answered to my lament over his sadness. And
that sadness lasted for three days, up unto the day before we came to
a sight of the Lady of Liberty of America. Then his face found a great
radiance and I perceived that he was full of much business. I found
him with a notebook, in deep consultation with my Capitaine, the Count
de Lasselles, and then in earnest consultation with many of the other
gentlemen. I had much wonder; but at the dinner that night, which was
the last before we made the landing to America, I discovered all of
his good actions. While we were at the last of the coffee, Mr. Peter
Scudder arose and made a bow to the capitaine of the ship, beside whom
I sat, which salutation did not in any way include me, and then turned
to the direction of my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles.
</p><p>"Sir," he said in that very nice voice which it is said is of
Philadelphia, "I have the honor to ask you if you will take charge of
a fund of five thousand dollars, which has been given by the
passengers of this boat, to be sent immediately to a field hospital of
France, preferably the nearest in need to the battlefield of the
Marne." And with no more of a speech than that he seated himself and
did not so much as make a glance in my direction when he mentioned the
battlefield on which my father had died. I think that Mr. Peter
Scudder is a very great gentleman and I sat very still and white, with
my head held high and tears rising from the depths of France in my
heart.
</p><p>"My honored friends," answered my Capitaine, the Count de Lasselles,
as he rose from his place at the foot of the table and stood tall and
slim in the manner of a great soldier, "it is impossible that I say to
you my gratitude for this expression of your friendship for my
country. So many dollars will bring life and an end of suffering to
many hundreds of my brave boys, but the good will and sympathy it
represents from America to France will do still more. The fund shall
go to the place you request and I now beg to offer to you a toast that
will be of an understanding to you." And at that moment he raised his
glass of champagne and said:
</p><p>"To the destiny of those born of American and French blood
commingled!"
</p><p>All those present arose to their feet and drank that toast with loving
looking at me, and I did not know what I should do until that good old
gray boat capitaine patted me upon the shoulder and said across his
empty glass:
</p><p>"God bless and keep you, child!"
</p><p>"I thank everybody," I answered as I went into the embrace of my very
large lady friend from the State of Cincinnati, and then into the
embrace of the other ladies.
</p><p>"I've been knitting all day for two months but I'm going to begin to
sit up at night," sobbed the lady from a queer Keokuk name as I took
her into my embrace on account of her extreme smallness.
</p><p>It was at a very late hour, just before retiring, that I ascended to
the deck with my Capitaine to view the effect of a very young moon on
the waves of the ocean.
</p><p>"Is it that you think now your soldier of France has done your command
well, <u>mon Capitaine</u>?" I asked of him.
</p><p>"Most extremely well, and entirely in the mode of a woman. Those two
young men have made of themselves very noble competitors for your
favor, but remember that it is of a truth that only a 'daredevil'
would bring together such high explosives. I salute you!" he made
answer to me with a laugh which ended in a sigh. "Child, little
child," he continued as he bent over my hand to kiss it as he did each
night before he conducted me to the head of the stairs leading down
into my cabin, "above all take unto yourself all that is possible of
joy in the present, for we do not know what the supply will be for the
future. Perhaps it will be like the harvests of France--burned up in a
world-conflagration."
</p><p>"Ah, but, <u>mon Capitaine</u>, will you not dance with me once
to-night for a joy. It will be our last on the ship before we land
to-morrow. You have never danced with me and to-morrow you are lost
from me into the wilds of that English Canada." And as I spoke I held
out my arms to him and began to hum the music of that remarkable
Chin-Chin fox dance that I had been dancing below with Mr. William
Raines and which the band had just begun to play again. Of course, I
knew that I must be very lovely in that young moonlight in one of the
frocks that Nannette had purchased from her very talented cousin, the
<u>couturière</u> on Rue Leopold, and I could see no reason why I
should not make a happiness for the great gentleman of France as well
as the young boy from Philadelphia and also the one from Saint Louis.
</p><p>"You <u>are</u> a daredevil, Mademoiselle, to propose the dance to
powder-stained Armond Lasselles, but the joy of you is of a greatness
and I feel from it a healing in the night of my soul."
</p><p>And he reached out in the moonlight and took me into his arms and
danced me along that deck with a grace that it would not be possible
for either the one from Philadelphia or the one from Saint Louis to
imitate. That nice but very ponderous lady from the State of
Cincinnati who regarded us from her steamer chair, enjoyed it as much
as did I, and she clapped her large hands as Monsieur le Capitaine
swung me around into the quietness beyond one of the tall chimneys for
smoke from the engine.
</p><p>"This is good-bye, <u>mon enfant</u>, for I leave the ship at dawn
with the tug, so that I do avoid those reporters from newspapers and
the contract conspirators. I have advised Nannette that you go to the
Ritz-Carlton to await your Uncle if he be not upon the dock. I go to
the grain fields of Canada and then to the West of America.... I would
that it could be <u>au revoir</u>. Upon a day that shall come,
beautiful lady, perhaps it will be permitted to me to... _Non, vive
la France! A lies vite, chérie _... go while I--I--<u>Vive la
France</u>!"
</p><p>And tears came across my eyes as I did his bidding and left him--to
France. In my heart was a desire to cling to him in a great fear at
being alone to care for the good Nannette and the small Pierre, but I
knew he must travel fast and far on his quest and that for France I
must let him go without--a backward look. Would I find in the great
land of America such another gallant gentleman to care for the fate of
the small Pierre and Nannette and me? What did I know of this cruel
Uncle? Nothing but his hardness of heart. I dreaded the sight of him
that I should find upon the arrival of the ship at the dock, which
would be an answer to the letter I had sent to him to inform him of my
coming, and I spent my long night in hate of him.
</p><p>With the arrival of the morning came more mines that exploded for me
under the waves of my life that had danced with so little concern
through the days upon the ship. A rain was falling and my friend of
France was gone from me at the beginning of day in a boat that is
called tug. Upon Nannette had fallen a rheumatism and the small Pierre
was in the midst of shivering chills when we at last were permitted by
the very unpleasant officer of America to go from the ship.
</p><p>"<u>Helas</u>, it was all of the gold that he took from me for an
entry into this savage land where one piece of money is as five of
that of France. There remains but a few sous and a gold piece," sobbed
Nannette as she came from her interview with the immigration officer
while I stood beside Pierre, deposited by a deck steward on a pile of
our steamer blankets.
</p><p>"Did it take all--all of the money to land, Nannette? Not all!" I
cried as I stretched out my hand to her. I did not know as I now do,
that the money would have been returned to Nannette had she waited
with patience and not made a hurry of returning to her nurslings.
</p><p>"All, Mademoiselle," were the words with which she answered me, and
for some very long moments I stood dazed and struggled in the waves of
that adventure I had thought to be life.
</p><p>"I beg your pardon, Marquise, but here is a letter the dock steward
failed to find you to deliver," came in the pleasant voice of that Mr.
William Raines as he raised a very fine hat that made him much better
to look upon than the cap of the steamer, and handed me a large
letter. I took it and came with my head out from under the wave which
had dashed over me.
</p><p>"Is there anything I can do to help you through the customs?" then
came the nice voice of that Mr. Peter Scudder of Philadelphia from the
other side of me.
</p><p>"No, with much gratitude to you both; I must wait the arrival of my
Uncle," I made answer to them with my head held very high.
</p><p>"Then we'll see you at the Ritz for tea at five as per promise," said
Mr. William Raines as he walked away and left Mr. Peter Scudder, who
was assisting the lady from Cincinnati to transport her very lovely
dog to a handsome car which awaited her. She also had I promised to
visit from that great Ritz-Carlton hotel and she smiled in sweet
friendliness to me as I stood with the letter in my hand and watched
all of the friends I had found upon that ship, depart and leave me
with not a place to go. I stood for many minutes motionless and then
my eyes perceived the letter in my hand. Surely it must be opened and
read. It was from the wicked Uncle, I knew, but it might be that it
was not of the cruelty that I had expected. It would excuse him no
doubt from arrival in person for the expected greeting to his
relatives, Pierre and myself.
</p><p>"Go to it, Bob," I advised myself in the language I had heard Mr.
Saint Louis use when he was forced to ask a nice lady, who danced with
disagreeable heaviness, to trot the fox with him because of a
friendship with his mother.
</p><p>And this is the letter that my eyes read with astonishment, while both
the good Nannette and small shivering Pierre sat with their eyes fixed
upon my countenance:
</p><p>    "My dear nephew Robert:
</p><p>    "Your arrival in America at this time suits me exactly. I need
    you immediately in my business. If you had been the girl,
    instead of the little one, I would have had to dispose of you
    some way--even murder. I have no use for women. Leave the
    little crippled girl and her nurse, who I feel sure is an old
    fool, with my good friend Dr. Mason Burns, of 222 South 32nd
    St. He has cured more children of hip joint disease than any
    man in the world, and he will straighten her out for us and we
    can give her away to somebody. I've written him instructions.
    Leave her immediately and come down here to me on the first
    train. The deal is held up without you. Enclosed is a check
    for a thousand dollars. If you are like Henry you'll need it,
    but keep away from Broadway and the women. Come on, I say, by
    next train.
</p><p>            Your uncle, Robert Carruthers.
    Hayesville, Harpeth."
</p><p>"The Uncle of America has come to a confusion of the sex between
Pierre and me from a careless memory and the writing of my hand, which
is of a great boldness, but not to be easily read," I explained as I
read the letter aloud to Pierre and Nannette.
</p><p>It took me just one hour by the clock, sitting there on the pile of
steamer wraps with the small Pierre in the hollow of my arm, to
explain and translate the sense of that letter to old Nannette, and I
feel sure she would have been sitting upon that spot yet immovable
rather than let me depart from her if I had not put all of my time and
force upon the picturing to her of a Pierre who could come down with
her later to me in a condition to run through the gardens of Twin
Oaks, which was the home of his American ancestors. With that vision
constantly before her she let the porter and me insert her into a
taxicab and extract her at the door of the small private hospital of
the good Dr. Burns who was to perform the miracle for the back and hip
of small and radiant Pierre.
</p><p>"But what is it that I do to permit the <u>jeune fille</u> of my
beloved mistress to depart into this city of wicked savages not
attended by me? I cannot. Do not demand it!" were the words with which
I left her arguing with that very sympathetic and sensible doctor of
America. He had not noticed a confusion of sex was between Pierre and
me and he had sent out the check of my wicked Uncle and procured the
American money for me. Also he had given me a few directions that he
appeared to think of a great sufficiency and had ordered a taxi to be
in readiness for me.
</p><p>"Nonsense, Nurse," he said to Nannette bruskly but not with unkindness
when I had translated to him Nannette's weeping protests. "A great
strapping girl like that can get down to the Harpeth Valley all right
by herself. Nobody's going to eat her up, and from the size of the
biceps I detect under that chiffon I think she could give a good
account of herself if anybody tried. How like you are to what Henry
was at your age, child, God bless you! I'd go to the station with you
but I've a patient all prepared for an operation. Shall I send a nurse
with you?"
</p><p>"No, please, good Doctor, and good-bye," I said, with a great haste as
I hurriedly embraced both Nannette and the small Pierre and departed
down the broad steps into the taxi with the open door.
</p><p>"Pennsylvania Station! Your train may not leave for hours, but you can
get your baggage together. Good-bye," said that good Doctor as he shut
the door and returned to his pursuit of making human beings either
whole or dead.
</p><p>"And now, Roberta Carruthers, no longer Marquise of Grez and Bye, you
are in your America, and let's see you do some hustling," as remarked
that Mr. Saint Louis to Mr. Peter Scudder at cards.
</p><p>And while that very swift taxi conveyed me to the large station that
is as beautiful as a cathedral I did some what I name "tall thinking."
What would be the result of my womanly arrival in that State of
Harpeth of my wicked Uncle? Would he be forced to murder me as his
letter had said? And if in his anger over the mistake he had made from
my letter, written in that very bold and difficult handwriting, he
should turn from me, and the good Nannette and Pierre as well, what
would I then do? All must be enacted that a cure for Pierre be
obtained. With great energy I had been thinking, but I did not know
what it was that I should do to prevent his anger when I arrived to
him as a woman until suddenly the good Doctor Burns' kindness in
marking the resemblance of me to my father in his extreme youth made
an entry into my brain and was received with the greatest welcome by
the daredevil who there resides.
</p><p>"Very well, Robert Carruthers, who is no longer the beautiful Marquise
of Grez and Bye, you will be that husky nephew to your wicked Uncle in
the State of Harpeth whom he 'needs in his business.' What is it that
you lack of a man's estate save the clothes, which you have money in
your pockets to obtain after you have purchased the ticket upon the
railway train?"
</p><p>A decision had been made and action upon it had begun in less than a
half hour after the purchase of the ticket for the State of Harpeth
had been accomplished.
</p><p>As my father had taught me observation in hunting, I had remarked a
large shop for the clothing of men upon the Sixth Avenue near to the
station. I made my way into it and by a very nice fiction of an
invalid brother whom I was taking to the South of America I was able
to buy for a few dollars less than was in my pocket two most
interesting bags of apparel for a handsome young man of fashion. The
man who assisted me to buy was very large, with a head only ornamented
with a drapery of gray hair around the edges, and he spoke much of
what his son deemed suitable to make appearance in the prevailing
mode.
</p><p>"He's at tea at the Ritz-Carlton with a lady friend this afternoon,
and I wish you could have saw him when he left the store to meet her,"
he said as he laid the last of the silk scarfs and hose into one of
the large flat bags I had purchased and which he had packed as I
selected. "He had on the match to these gray tweeds and was fitted out
in lavender from the skin out. Now what are you going to do about
shoes, Miss?"
</p><p>"That I do not know, kind sir," I made answer with a great perplexity.
"I think that the feet of my relative are about the size of those I
possess."
</p><p>"Most women would wear shoes near the size of their brothers' if they
didn't prefer to waddle and limp along with their feet scrouged. Go
over to the shoe department and the clerk will fit you out with what
you need in about two sizes larger than you wear. If they are not
right you can tell just about what will be, and exchange 'em by
special messenger. I'll pack all this shipshape before you come back."
With which direction I left the kind man and made my way to another of
equal kindness.
</p><p>"I have had upon my feet the shoes of my brother when in accidents
while at hunting and fishing, and I think I can ascertain a good
fitting," I made a falsification to the very polite young man who
stood with attention and sympathy to wait upon me.
</p><p>"We'll make a selection and then try one pair on," he advised me.
</p><p>And as I gave to him a fine description of the clothing I had
purchased he brought forth in accord many wonderful boots and shoes
for the riding and a walking and also for the dance. I had never
observed that the shoes of men were of such an ugliness; but when one
was upon my foot, in place of the shoe of much beauty which I
discarded, both I and the young man had a fine laugh.
</p><p>"<u>Mais</u>, they are of a great comfort," I further remarked. "And
they feel about as did those of my brother, who is of a small frame."
</p><p>"Well, if they are not right, send 'em back and I'll change 'em," he
answered with great interest.
</p><p>After the exchange of much money between us, the young man went with
me to the other kind old man of the white hair, and together they made
places in the two bags for the shoes.
</p><p>"Just seven hundred dollars all told, and the like of that outfit
couldn't be bought any other place of style in New York for less than
a thousand, Miss," remarked to me the elderly clerk as he closed and
made fast with keys the two bags. "Shall I send 'em special?"
</p><p>"I'll thank you that you call a taxi for me, Monsieur," I answered,
and as he had mentioned that Ritz-Carlton Hotel, in conversation
earlier, that very wicked daredevil that resides within me awoke at
attention with the large ears of great mischief. I felt in my pocket
that there was still much gold, and the man from whom I had purchased
the ticket to the State of Harpeth had assured me that the train did
not depart until the hour of six in the evening.
</p><p>"To the Hotel of the Ritz-Carlton," I commanded the man of the taxi as
he made fast the door.
</p><p>It then transpired that one hour from the time that the young
Mademoiselle Grez, who had registered at that large hotel with all of
her luggage from the steamer while by lies her father was represented
as still engaged with the customs, entered her room, there emerged
young Mr. Robert Carruthers, who, after paying his bill in his room
had a hall boy send his bags on ahead of him to the Pennsylvania
Station while he sauntered into the tea room. I have never again met
with the wonderful dresses I left in that hotel room. I hope the poor
and beautiful domestic, who assisted me in cutting my hair into a
football shortness after the mode of a very beautiful woman dancer
which she said girls of much foolishness in America have affected, was
rewarded with them.
</p><p>And as I stood in the center of the great room of conversation and
lights and flowers and music I again became the frightened girl upon
the dock of America and I felt as if I must flee, but at that exact
moment I beheld my Mr. William Raines of Saint Louis and my Mr. Peter
Scudder of Philadelphia seated at a table in a very choice corner and
there was a vacant chair between them. Upon each other they were
glaring and before I had a thought I started towards them to prevent
the carnage that had threatened on the boat.
