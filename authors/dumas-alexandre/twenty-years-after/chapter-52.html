<P>Instead of returning, then, by the Saint Honore gate,
D'Artagnan, who had time before him, walked around and
re-entered by the Porte Richelieu. He was approached to be
examined, and when it was discovered by his plumed hat and
his laced coat, that he was an officer of the musketeers, he
was surrounded, with the intention of making him cry, &quot;Down
with Mazarin!&quot; The demonstration did not fail to make him
uneasy at first; but when he discovered what it meant, he
shouted it in such a voice that even the most exacting were
satisfied. He walked down the Rue Richelieu, meditating how
he should carry off the queen in her turn, for to take her
in a carriage bearing the arms of France was not to be
thought of, when he perceived an equipage standing at the
door of the hotel belonging to Madame de Guemenee.</P>
<P>He was struck by a sudden idea.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, pardieu!&quot; he exclaimed; &quot;that would be fair play.&quot;</P>
<P>And approaching the carriage, he examined the arms on the
panels and the livery of the coachman on his box. This
scrutiny was so much the more easy, the coachman being sound
asleep.</P>
<P>&quot;It is, in truth, monsieur le coadjuteur's carriage,&quot; said
D'Artagnan; &quot;upon my honor I begin to think that Heaven
favors us.&quot;</P>
<P>He mounted noiselessly into the chariot and pulled the silk
cord which was attached to the coachman's little finger.</P>
<P>&quot;To the Palais Royal,&quot; he called out.</P>
<P>The coachman awoke with a start and drove off in the
direction he was desired, never doubting but that the order
had come from his master. The porter at the palace was about
to close the gates, but seeing such a handsome equipage he
fancied that it was some visit of importance and the
carriage was allowed to pass and to stop beneath the porch.
It was then only the coachman perceived the grooms were not
behind the vehicle; he fancied monsieur le coadjuteur had
sent them back, and without dropping the reins he sprang
from his box to open the door. D'Artagnan, in his turn,
sprang to the ground, and just at the moment when the
coachman, alarmed at not seeing his master, fell back a
step, he seized him by his collar with the left, whilst with
the right hand he placed the muzzle of a pistol at his
breast.</P>
<P>&quot;Pronounce one single word,&quot; muttered D'Artagnan, &quot;and you
are a dead man.&quot;</P>
<P>The coachman perceived at once, by the expression of the man
who thus addressed him, that he had fallen into a trap, and
he remained with his mouth wide open and his eyes
portentously staring.</P>
<P>Two musketeers were pacing the court, to whom D'Artagnan
called by their names.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur de Belliere,&quot; said he to one of them, &quot;do me the
favor to take the reins from the hands of this worthy man,
mount upon the box and drive to the door of the private
stair, and wait for me there; it is an affair of importance
on the service of the king.&quot;</P>
<P>The musketeer, who knew that his lieutenant was incapable of
jesting with regard to the service, obeyed without a word,
although he thought the order strange. Then turning toward
the second musketeer, D'Artagnan said:</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur du Verger, help me to place this man in a place of
safety.&quot;</P>
<P>The musketeer, thinking that his lieutenant had just
arrested some prince in disguise, bowed, and drawing his
sword, signified that he was ready. D'Artagnan mounted the
staircase, followed by his prisoner, who in his turn was
followed by the soldier, and entered Mazarin's ante-room.
Bernouin was waiting there, impatient for news of his
master.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, sir?&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Everything goes on capitally, my dear Monsieur Bernouin,
but here is a man whom I must beg you to put in a safe
place.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where, then, sir?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Where you like, provided that the place which you shall
choose has iron shutters secured by padlocks and a door that
can be locked.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We have that, sir,&quot; replied Bernouin; and the poor coachman
was conducted to a closet, the windows of which were barred
and which looked very much like a prison.</P>
<P>&quot;And now, my good friend,&quot; said D'Artagnan to him, &quot;I must
invite you to deprive yourself, for my sake, of your hat and
cloak.&quot;</P>
<P>The coachman, as we can well understand, made no resistance;
in fact, he was so astonished at what had happened to him
that he stammered and reeled like a drunken man; D'Artagnan
deposited his clothes under the arm of one of the valets.</P>
<P>&quot;And now, Monsieur du Verger,&quot; he said, &quot;shut yourself up
with this man until Monsieur Bernouin returns to open the
door. The duty will be tolerably long and not very amusing,
I know; but,&quot; added he, seriously, &quot;you understand, it is on
the king's service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;At your command, lieutenant,&quot; replied the musketeer, who
saw the business was a serious one.</P>
<P>&quot;By-the-bye,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;should this man attempt
to fly or to call out, pass your sword through his body.&quot;</P>
<P>The musketeer signified by a nod that these commands should
be obeyed to the letter, and D'Artagnan went out, followed
by Bernouin. Midnight struck.</P>
<P>&quot;Lead me into the queen's oratory,&quot; said D'Artagnan,
&quot;announce to her I am here, and put this parcel, with a
well-loaded musket, under the seat of the carriage which is
waiting at the foot of the private stair.&quot;</P>
<P>Bernouin conducted D'Artagnan to the oratory, where he sat
down pensively. Everything had gone on as usual at the
Palais Royal. As we said before, by ten o'clock almost all
the guests had dispersed; those who were to fly with the
court had the word of command and they were each severally
desired to be from twelve o'clock to one at Cours la Reine.</P>
<P>At ten o'clock Anne of Austria had entered the king's room.
Monsieur had just retired, and the youthful Louis, remaining
the last, was amusing himself by placing some lead soldiers
in a line of battle, a game which delighted him much. Two
royal pages were playing with him.</P>
<P>&quot;Laporte,&quot; said the queen, &quot;it is time for his majesty to go
to bed.&quot;</P>
<P>The king asked to remain up, having, he said, no wish to
sleep; but the queen was firm.</P>
<P>&quot;Are you not going to-morrow morning at six o'clock, Louis,
to bathe at Conflans? I think you wished to do so of your
own accord?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right, madame,&quot; said the king, &quot;and I am ready to
retire to my room when you have kissed me. Laporte, give the
light to Monsieur the Chevalier de Coislin.&quot;</P>
<P>The queen touched with her lips the white, smooth brow the
royal child presented to her with a gravity which already
partook of etiquette.</P>
<P>&quot;Go to sleep soon, Louis,&quot; said the queen, &quot;for you must be
awakened very early.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will do my best to obey you, madame,&quot; said the youthful
king, &quot;but I have no inclination to sleep.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Laporte,&quot; said Anne of Austria, in an undertone, &quot;find some
very dull book to read to his majesty, but do not undress
yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>The king went out, accompanied by the Chevalier de Coislin,
bearing the candlestick, and then the queen returned to her
own apartment. Her ladies  -  that is to say Madame de Bregy,
Mademoiselle de Beaumont, Madame de Motteville, and
Socratine, her sister, so called on account of her sense  - 
had just brought into her dressing-room the remains of the
dinner, on which, according to her usual custom, she supped.
The queen then gave her orders, spoke of a banquet which the
Marquis de Villequier was to give to her on the day after
the morrow, indicated the persons she would admit to the
honor of partaking of it, announced another visit on the
following day to Val-de-Grace, where she intended to pay her
devotions, and gave her commands to her senior valet to
accompany her. When the ladies had finished their supper the
queen feigned extreme fatigue and passed into her bedroom.
Madame de Motteville, who was on especial duty that evening,
followed to aid and undress her. The queen then began to
read, and after conversing with her affectionately for a few
minutes, dismissed her.</P>
<P>It was at this moment D'Artagnan entered the courtyard of
the palace, in the coadjutor's carriage, and a few seconds
later the carriages of the ladies-in-waiting drove out and
the gates were shut after them.</P>
<P>A few minutes after twelve o'clock Bernouin knocked at the
queen's bedroom door, having come by the cardinal's secret
corridor. Anne of Austria opened the door to him herself.
She was dressed, that is to say, in dishabille, wrapped in a
long, warm dressing-gown.</P>
<P>&quot;It is you, Bernouin,&quot; she said. &quot;Is Monsieur d'Artagnan
there?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame, in your oratory. He is waiting till your
majesty is ready.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am. Go and tell Laporte to wake and dress the king, and
then pass on to the Marechal de Villeroy and summon him to
me.&quot;</P>
<P>Bernouin bowed and retired.</P>
<P>The queen entered her oratory, which was lighted by a single
lamp of Venetian crystal, She saw D'Artagnan, who stood
expecting her.</P>
<P>&quot;Is it you?&quot; she said.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Are you ready?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I am.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And his eminence, the cardinal?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Has got off without any accident. He is awaiting your
majesty at Cours la Reine.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But in what carriage do we start?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I have provided for everything; a carriage below is waiting
for your majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let us go to the king.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan bowed and followed the queen. The young Louis was
already dressed, with the exception of his shoes and
doublet; he had allowed himself to be dressed, in great
astonishment, overwhelming Laporte with questions, who
replied only in these words, &quot;Sire, it is by the queen's
commands.&quot;</P>
<P>The bedclothes were thrown back, exposing the king's bed
linen, which was so worn that here and there holes could be
seen. It was one of the results of Mazarin's niggardliness.</P>
<P>The queen entered and D'Artagnan remained at the door. As
soon as the child perceived the queen he escaped from
Laporte and ran to meet her. Anne then motioned to
D'Artagnan to approach, and he obeyed.</P>
<P>&quot;My son,&quot; said Anne of Austria, pointing to the musketeer,
calm, standing uncovered, &quot;here is Monsieur d'Artagnan, who
is as brave as one of those ancient heroes of whom you like
so much to hear from my women. Remember his name well and
look at him well, that his face may not be forgotten, for
this evening he is going to render us a great service.&quot;</P>
<P>The young king looked at the officer with his large-formed
eye, and repeated:</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is it, my son.&quot;</P>
<P>The young king slowly raised his little hand and held it out
to the musketeer; the latter bent on his knee and kissed it.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan,&quot; repeated Louis; &quot;very well, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment they were startled by a noise as if a tumult
were approaching.</P>
<P>&quot;What is that?&quot; exclaimed the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; replied D'Artagnan, straining both at the same
time his quick ear and his intelligent glance, &quot;it is the
murmur of the populace in revolution.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We must fly,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty has given me the control of this business; we
had better wait and see what they want.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I will answer for everything.&quot;</P>
<P>Nothing is so catching as confidence. The queen, full of
energy and courage, was quickly alive to these two virtues
in others.</P>
<P>&quot;Do as you like,&quot; she said, &quot;I rely upon you.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will your majesty permit me to give orders in your name
throughout this business?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Command, sir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What do the people want this time?&quot; demanded the king.</P>
<P>&quot;We are about to ascertain, sire,&quot; replied D'Artagnan, as he
rapidly left the room.</P>
<P>The tumult continued to increase and seemed to surround the
Palais Royal entirely. Cries were heard from the interior,
of which they could not comprehend the sense. It was evident
that there was clamor and sedition.</P>
<P>The king, half dressed, the queen and Laporte remained each
in the same state and almost in the same place, where they
were listening and waiting. Comminges, who was on guard that
night at the Palais Royal, ran in. He had about two hundred
men in the courtyards and stables, and he placed them at the
queen's disposal.</P>
<P>&quot;Well,&quot; asked Anne of Austria, when D'Artagnan reappeared,
&quot;what does it mean?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It means, madame, that the report has spread that the queen
has left the Palais Royal, carrying off the king, and the
people ask to have proof to the contrary, or threaten to
demolish the Palais Royal.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, this time it is too much!&quot; exclaimed the queen, &quot;and I
will prove to them I have not left.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan saw from the expression of the queen's face that
she was about to issue some violent command. He approached
her and said in a low voice:</P>
<P>&quot;Has your majesty still confidence in me?&quot;</P>
<P>This voice startled her. &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she replied, &quot;every
confidence; speak.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Will the queen deign to follow my advice?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Speak.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Let your majesty dismiss M. de Comminges and desire him to
shut himself up with his men in the guardhouse and in the
stables.&quot;</P>
<P>Comminges glanced at D'Artagnan with the envious look with
which every courtier sees a new favorite spring up.</P>
<P>&quot;You hear, Comminges?&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan went up to him; with his usual quickness he
caught the anxious glance.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur de Comminges,&quot; he said, &quot;pardon me; we both are
servants of the queen, are we not? It is my turn to be of
use to her; do not envy me this happiness.&quot;</P>
<P>Comminges bowed and left.</P>
<P>&quot;Come,&quot; said D'Artagnan to himself, &quot;I have got one more
enemy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now,&quot; said the queen, addressing D'Artagnan, &quot;what is
to be done? for you hear that, instead of becoming calmer,
the noise increases.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;the people want to see the king
and they must see him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What! must see him! Where  -  on the balcony?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not at all, madame, but here, sleeping in his bed.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, your majesty,&quot; exclaimed Laporte, &quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan
is right.&quot;</P>
<P>The queen became thoughtful and smiled, like a woman to whom
duplicity is no stranger.</P>
<P>&quot;Without doubt,&quot; she murmured.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Laporte,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;go and announce to the
people through the grating that they are going to be
satisfied and that in five minutes they shall not only see
the king, but they shall see him in bed; add that the king
sleeps and that the queen begs that they will keep silence,
so as not to awaken him.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But not every one; a deputation of two or four people.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Every one, madame.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But reflect, they will keep us here till daybreak.</P>
<P>&quot;It shall take but a quarter of an hour, I answer for
everything, madame; believe me, I know the people; they are
like a great child, who only wants humoring. Before the
sleeping king they will be mute, gentle and timid as lambs.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go, Laporte,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>The young king approached his mother and said, &quot;Why do as
these people ask?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It must be so, my son,&quot; said Anne of Austria.</P>
<P>&quot;But if they say, `it must be' to me, am I no longer king?&quot;</P>
<P>The queen remained silent.</P>
<P>&quot;Sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;will your majesty permit me to ask
you a question?&quot;</P>
<P>Louis XIV. turned around, astonished that any one should
dare to address him. But the queen pressed the child's hand.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Does your majesty remember, when playing in the park of
Fontainebleau, or in the palace courts at Versailles, ever
to have seen the sky grow suddenly dark and heard the sound
of thunder?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, certainly.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well, then, this noise of thunder, however much your
majesty may have wished to continue playing, has said, `go
in, sire. You must do so.'&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Certainly, sir; but they tell me that the noise of thunder
is the voice of God.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Well then, sire,&quot; continued D'Artagnan, &quot;listen to the
noise of the people; you will perceive that it resembles
that of thunder.&quot;</P>
<P>In truth at that moment a terrible murmur was wafted to them
by the night breeze; then all at once it ceased.</P>
<P>&quot;Hold, sire,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;they have just told the
people that you are asleep; you see, you still are king.&quot;</P>
<P>The queen looked with surprise at this strange man, whose
brilliant courage made him the equal of the bravest, and who
was, by his fine and quick intelligence, the equal of the
most astute.</P>
<P>Laporte entered.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, Laporte?&quot; asked the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Madame,&quot; he replied, &quot;Monsieur d'Artagnan's prediction has
been accomplished; they are calm, as if by enchantment. The
doors are about to be opened and in five minutes they will
be here.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Laporte,&quot; said the queen, &quot;suppose you put one of your sons
in the king's place; we might be off during the time.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;If your majesty desires it,&quot; said Laporte, &quot;my sons, like
myself, are at the queen's service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Not at all,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;should one of them know his
majesty and discover but a substitute, all would be lost.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;You are right, sir, always right,&quot; said Anne of Austria.
&quot;Laporte, place the king in bed.&quot;</P>
<P>Laporte placed the king, dressed as he was, in the bed and
then covered him as far as the shoulders with the sheet. The
queen bent over him and kissed his brow.</P>
<P>&quot;Pretend to sleep, Louis,&quot; said she.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; said the king, &quot;but I do not wish to be touched by
any of those men.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Sire, I am here,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;and I give you my word,
that if a single man has the audacity, his life shall pay
for it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And now what is to be done?&quot; asked the queen, &quot;for I hear
them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Laporte, go to them and again recommend silence.
Madame, wait at the door, whilst I shall be at the head of
the king's bed, ready to die for him.&quot;</P>
<P>Laporte went out; the queen remained standing near the
hangings, whilst D'Artagnan glided behind the curtains.</P>
<P>Then the heavy and collected steps of a multitude of men
were heard, and the queen herself raised the tapestry
hangings and put her finger on her lips.</P>
<P>On seeing the queen, the men stopped short, respectfully.</P>
<P>&quot;Enter, gentlemen, enter,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>There was then amongst that crowd a moment's hesitation,
which looked like shame. They had expected resistance, they
had expected to be thwarted, to have to force the gates, to
overturn the guards. The gates had opened of themselves, and
the king, ostensibly at least, had no other guard at his
bed-head but his mother. The foremost of them stammered and
attempted to fall back.</P>
<P>&quot;Enter, gentlemen,&quot; said Laporte, &quot;since the queen desires
you so to do.&quot;</P>
<P>Then one more bold than the rest ventured to pass the door
and to advance on tiptoe. This example was imitated by the
rest, until the room filled silently, as if these men had
been the humblest, most devoted courtiers. Far beyond the
door the heads of those who were not able to enter could be
seen, all craning to their utmost height to try and see.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan saw it all through an opening he had made in the
curtain, and in the very first man who entered he recognized
Planchet.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said the queen to him, thinking he was the leader of
the band, &quot;you wished to see the king and therefore I
determined to show him to you myself. Approach and look at
him and say if we have the appearance of people who wish to
run away.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, certainly,&quot; replied Planchet, rather astonished at the
unexpected honor conferred upon him.</P>
<P>&quot;You will say, then, to my good and faithful Parisians,&quot;
continued Anne, with a smile, the expression of which did
not deceive D'Artagnan, &quot;that you have seen the king in bed,
asleep, and the queen also ready to retire.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I shall tell them, madame, and those who accompany me will
say the same thing; but  -  -  &quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But what?&quot; asked Anne of Austria.</P>
<P>&quot;Will your majesty pardon me,&quot; said Planchet, &quot;but is it
really the king who is lying there?&quot;</P>
<P>Anne of Austria started. &quot;If,&quot; she said, &quot;there is one among
you who knows the king, let him approach and say whether it
is really his majesty lying there.&quot;</P>
<P>A man wrapped in a cloak, in the folds of which his face was
hidden, approached and leaned over the bed and looked.</P>
<P>For one second, D'Artagnan thought the man had some evil
design and he put his hand to his sword; but in the movement
made by the man in stooping a portion of his face was
uncovered and D'Artagnan recognized the coadjutor.</P>
<P>&quot;It is certainly the king,&quot; said the man, rising again. &quot;God
bless his majesty!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; repeated the leader in a whisper, &quot;God bless his
majesty!&quot; and all these men, who had entered enraged, passed
from anger to pity and blessed the royal infant in their
turn.</P>
<P>&quot;Now,', said Planchet, &quot;let us thank the queen. My friends,
retire.&quot;</P>
<P>They all bowed, and retired by degrees as noiselessly as
they had entered. Planchet, who had been the first to enter,
was the last to leave. The queen stopped him.</P>
<P>&quot;What is your name, my friend?&quot; she said.</P>
<P>Planchet, much surprised at the inquiry, turned back.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; continued the queen, &quot;I think myself as much honored
to have received you this evening as if you had been a
prince, and I wish to know your name.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; thought Planchet, &quot;to treat me as a prince. No, thank
you.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan trembled lest Planchet, seduced, like the crow in
the fable, should tell his name, and that the queen, knowing
his name, would discover that Planchet had belonged to him.</P>
<P>&quot;Madame,&quot; replied Planchet, respectfully, &quot;I am called
Dulaurier, at your service.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Thank you, Monsieur Dulaurier,&quot; said the queen; &quot;and what
is your business?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Madame, I am a clothier in the Rue Bourdonnais.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;That is all I wished to know,&quot; said the queen. &quot;Much
obliged to you, Monsieur Dulaurier. You will hear again from
me.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Come, come,&quot; thought D'Artagnan, emerging from behind the
curtain, &quot;decidedly Monsieur Planchet is no fool; it is
evident he has been brought up in a good school.&quot;</P>
<P>The different actors in this strange scene remained facing
one another, without uttering a single word; the queen
standing near the door, D'Artagnan half out of his hiding
place, the king raised on his elbow, ready to fall down on
his bed again at the slightest sound that would indicate the
return of the multitude, but instead of approaching, the
noise became more and more distant and very soon it died
entirely away.</P>
<P>The queen breathed more freely. D'Artagnan wiped his damp
forehead and the king slid off his bed, saying, &quot;Let us go.&quot;</P>
<P>At this moment Laporte reappeared.</P>
<P>&quot;Well?&quot; asked the queen</P>
<P>&quot;Well, madame,&quot; replied the valet, &quot;I followed them as far
as the gates. They announced to all their comrades that they
had seen the king and that the queen had spoken to them;
and, in fact, they went away quite proud and happy.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, the miserable wretches!&quot; murmured the queen, &quot;they
shall pay dearly for their boldness, and it is I who promise
this.&quot;</P>
<P>Then turning to D'Artagnan, she said:</P>
<P>&quot;Sir, you have given me this evening the best advice I have
ever received. Continue, and say what we must do now.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur Laporte,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;finish dressing his
majesty.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We may go, then?&quot; asked the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Whenever your majesty pleases. You have only to descend by
the private stairs and you will find me at the door.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Go, sir,&quot; said the queen; &quot;I will follow you.&quot;</P>
<P>D'Artagnan went down and found the carriage at its post and
the musketeer on the box. D'Artagnan took out the parcel
which he had desired Bernouin to place under the seat. It
may be remembered that it was the hat and cloak belonging to
Monsieur de Gondy's coachman.</P>
<P>He placed the cloak on his shoulders and the hat on his
head, whilst the musketeer got off the box.</P>
<P>&quot;Sir,&quot; said D'Artagnan, &quot;you will go and release your
companion, who is guarding the coachman. You must mount your
horse and proceed to the Rue Tiquetonne, Hotel de la
Chevrette, whence you will take my horse and that of
Monsieur du Vallon, which you must saddle and equip as if
for war, and then you will leave Paris, bringing them with
you to Cours la Reine. If, when you arrive at Cours la
Reine, you find no one, you must go on to Saint Germain. On
the king's service.&quot;</P>
<P>The musketeer touched his cap and went away to execute the
orders thus received.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan mounted the box, having a pair of pistols in his
belt, a musket under his feet and a naked sword behind him.</P>
<P>The queen appeared, and was followed by the king and the
Duke d'Anjou, his brother.</P>
<P>&quot;Monsieur the coadjutor's carriage!&quot; she exclaimed, falling
back.</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, madame,&quot; said D'Artagnan; &quot;but get in fearlessly, for
I myself will drive you.&quot;</P>
<P>The queen uttered a cry of surprise and entered the
carriage, and the king and monsieur took their places at her
side.</P>
<P>&quot;Come, Laporte,&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;How, madame!&quot; said the valet, &quot;in the same carriage as your
majesties?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is not a matter of royal etiquette this evening, but of
the king's safety. Get in, Laporte.&quot;</P>
<P>Laporte obeyed.</P>
<P>&quot;Pull down the blinds,&quot; said D'Artagnan.</P>
<P>&quot;But will that not excite suspicion, sir?&quot; asked the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Your majesty's mind may be quite at ease,&quot; replied the
officer; &quot;I have my answer ready.&quot;</P>
<P>The blinds were pulled down and they started at a gallop by
the Rue Richelieu. On reaching the gate the captain of the
post advanced at the head of a dozen men, holding a lantern
in his hand.</P>
<P>D'Artagnan signed to them to draw near.</P>
<P>&quot;Do you recognize the carriage?&quot; he asked the sergeant.</P>
<P>&quot;No,&quot; replied the latter.</P>
<P>&quot;Look at the arms.&quot;</P>
<P>The sergeant put the lantern near the panel.</P>
<P>&quot;They are those of monsieur le coadjuteur,&quot; he said.</P>
<P>&quot;Hush; he is enjoying a ride with Madame de Guemenee.&quot;</P>
<P>The sergeant began to laugh.</P>
<P>&quot;Open the gate,&quot; he cried. &quot;I know who it is!&quot; Then putting
his face to the lowered blinds, he said:</P>
<P>&quot;I wish you joy, my lord!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Impudent fellow!&quot; cried D'Artagnan, &quot;you will get me turned
off.&quot;</P>
<P>The gate groaned on its hinges, and D'Artagnan, seeing the
way clear, whipped his horses, who started at a canter, and
five minutes later they had rejoined the cardinal.</P>
<P>&quot;Musqueton!&quot; exclaimed D'Artagnan, &quot;draw up the blinds of
his majesty's carriage.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;It is he!&quot; cried Porthos.</P>
<P>&quot;Disguised as a coachman!&quot; exclaimed Mazarin.</P>
<P>&quot;And driving the coadjutor's carriage!&quot; said the queen.</P>
<P>&quot;Corpo di Dio! Monsieur d'Artagnan!&quot; said Mazarin, &quot;you are
worth your weight in gold.&quot;</P></div>
