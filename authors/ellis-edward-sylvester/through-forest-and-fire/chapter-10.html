<p>A little child is like a butterfly, thinking only of the pleasures
of the moment. Nellie Ribsam came down close to the edge of the
creek and threw some crumbs out upon the surface. In the clear
water she could see the shadowy figures of the minnows, as they
glided upward and snapped at the morsels.</p>

<p>She became so interested in the sport that she kept walking down
the bank of the stream, flinging out the crumbs until there was
none left in her hand; then she debated whether she should go
back after her lunch basket or wait where she was until Nick appeared
on the bridge.</p>

<p>"It's a bother to carry the basket with me," she said to herself;
"I had to leave it on the ground when I was after grapes, so I'll
wait till Nick comes, and then I'll call to him. Won't he be scared
when he sees me down here!"</p>

<p>From where she stood, she observed the bridge above her head,
and consequently Nick could look directly down upon her whenever
he should reach the structure.</p>

<p>Nellie felt that she would like to go on down the creek to the
big pond into which it emptied; but she knew better than to do
that, for she would be certain to miss her big brother, and it
was already beginning to grow dark around her.</p>

<p>"I wonder what makes Nick so long," she said to herself, as she
sat down on a fallen tree; "I'm so tired that I never can walk
the four miles home."</p>

<p>She had sat thus only a brief while, when her head began to droop;
her bright eyes grew dull, then closed, and leaning against a
limb which put out from the fallen tree, on which she was sitting,
she sank into the sweet, dreamless sleep of childhood and health.</p>

<p>Had she not been disturbed she would not have wakened until the
sun rose, but at the end of an hour, an involuntary movement of
the head caused it to slip off the limb against which it was resting
with such a shock that instantly she was as wide awake as though
it was mid-day.</p>

<p>Ah, but when she sprang to her feet and stared about her in the
gloom she was dreadfully alarmed!</p>

<p>She was quick-witted enough to understand where she was and how
it had all come about. The gibbous moon was directly overhead,
and shone down upon her with unobstructed fullness.</p>

<p>"Nick has gone over the bridge while I was asleep," was her instant
conclusion; "and father and mother will be worried about me."</p>

<p>Her decision as to what she should do could not but be the one
thing&mdash;that was to climb back up the bank to the bridge, cross
it, and hurry homeward.</p>

<p>There was a little throbbing of the heart, when she reflected
that she had several miles to travel, most of which was through
the gloomy woods; but there was no hesitation on the part of Nellie,
who, but for the sturdy teaching of her parents, would have crouched
down beside the log and sobbed in terror until she sank into slumber
through sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>"I have been a bad girl," she said to herself, as she reflected
on her thoughtlessness; "and mother will whip me, for I know she
ought to; and mother always does what she ought to do."</p>

<p>There was no room for doubt in the mind of the child, for she
understood the nature of her parents as well as any child could
understand that of its guardian.</p>

<p>Nellie was some distance below the point where the bridge spanned
the creek, but she could see the dim outlines of the structure
as she started toward it. It seemed higher than usual, but that
was because the circumstances were different from any in which
she had ever been placed.</p>

<p>The little one was making her way as best she could along the
stream in the direction of the bridge, when she was frightened
almost out of her senses by hearing a loud, sniffing growl from
some point just ahead of her.</p>

<p>It was a sound that would have startled the bravest man, and
Nellie was transfixed for the moment. She did not turn and run,
nor did she sink in a swoon to the ground, but she stood just
where she had stopped, until she could find out what it meant.</p>

<p>She was not kept long in waiting, for in less than a minute the
noise was repeated, and at the same moment she caught the outlines
of a huge black bear swinging along toward her. He was coming
down the bed of the creek, with his awkward, ponderous tread,
and when seen by Nellie was within fifty feet of her.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that he was of unusual size and proceeding
straight toward the child, it seems impossible that she should
have done anything at all to help herself. The sight was enough
to deprive her of the power of motion and speech.</p>

<p>But it was in such a crisis as this that little Nellie Ribsam
showed that she had not forgotten the teaching of her parents:
"God helps them that help themselves."</p>

<p>With scarcely a second's pause, she whirled on her heel and dashed
down the stream with the utmost speed at her command.</p>

<p>The bear could not have failed to see her, though it is not to
be supposed that he was looking for the little girl when he first
came that way. Furthermore, had the chase lasted several minutes
Nellie must have fallen a victim to the savage animal.</p>

<p>It required no instruction to teach her that there was but one
way in which she could escape, and that was by climbing a tree.
Had there been a large one near at hand she would have ascended
that as quickly as possible; but, fortunately, the first one to
which she fled was a sapling, no larger than those she had climbed
during the afternoon, and no one could have clambered to the highest
point attainable quicker than did the frightened little girl.</p>

<p>Had she been a veteran hunter, Nellie could not have made a better
selection, for she was fully twenty feet from the ground, and
as much beyond the reach of the bear as though she were in her
trundle-bed at home.</p>

<p>But the position was a frightful one to her, and for several
minutes she believed the animal would tear the tree down and destroy
her.</p>

<p>"I have done all I can for myself," she murmured, recalling the
instruction of her parents, "and now God will do the rest."</p>

<p>Beautiful, trusting faith of childhood! Of such, indeed, is the
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>The huge bear, which from some cause or other had ventured from
the recesses of the wood, was but a short distance behind the
little wanderer when she climbed so hastily beyond his reach.
He acted as though he was somewhat bewildered by the unusual scene
of a small child fleeing from him, but nothing is so tempting
to pursuit as the sight of some one running from us, and the brute
galloped after Nellie with an evident determination to capture
her, if the thing could be done.</p>

<p>When he found the child had eluded him for the time, he sat down
on his haunches and looked upward, as though he intended to wait
till she would be compelled to descend and surrender herself.</p>

<p>The small tree in which Nellie had taken refuge was several yards
from the edge of the stream, the bank sloping so steeply that
the water never reached the base, excepting during a freshet.</p>

<p>It was a chestnut, whose smooth bark rendered it all the more
difficult to climb, but Nellie went up it as rapidly as a man
ascends telegraph poles with the spikes strapped to his boots.</p>

<p>The bear clawed the bark a little while, as a cat is sometimes
seen to do when "stretching" herself, and it was during these
few minutes that the girl thought nothing could save her from
falling into his clutches.</p>

<p>When he ceased, she peered downward through the branches, and
could just see the massy animal near the base of the tree, as
if asking himself what was the next best thing to do.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that the situation of Nellie Ribsam was one
in which few children of her tender years are ever placed. Happy
it is, indeed, that it is so, for what one in a thousand would
have retained her self-possession?</p>

<p>In explanation, it may be doubted indeed whether Nellie fully
comprehended her peril. Had she been older, her consternation,
doubtless, would have been greater, as the emotion she showed
some years later, when placed in great danger, would seem to prove.</p>

<p>But there was one fact of which she was firmly convinced: she
had complied with her father's instructions, for, as has been
shown, she put forth every possible exertion to save herself,
and now she called on Heaven to assist her.</p>

<p>Perched in the top of the tree, with the enormous bear sitting
beneath and looking hungrily upward, she prayed:</p>

<p>"Heavenly Father, please take care of me and don't let that big
bear catch me; don't let papa and mamma feel too bad, and please
make the bad bear go away and let me alone."</p>
