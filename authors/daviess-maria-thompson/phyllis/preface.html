<pre>Down that garden path I flew
Then Roxanne and the bottle and I all collapsed on the grass together
He stood there in the doorway and laughed until his big shoulders shook
I never saw my father's face so lovely
Tony ... nosed almost every inch of the shed
He just moaned he was making an explosion
The Colonel handed me the medal
"You stand right here and tell me how it all looks"
