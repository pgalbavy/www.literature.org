<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>It is within my memory that Melville Clarendon, a lad of sixteen
years, was riding through Southern Minnesota, in company with
his sister Dorothy, a sweet little miss not quite half his own
age.</p>

<p>They were mounted on Saladin, a high-spirited, fleet, and good-tempered
pony of coal-black color. Melville, who claimed the steed as his
own special property, had given him his Arabian name because he
fancied there were many points of resemblance between him and
the winged coursers of the East, made famous as long ago as the
time of the Crusades.</p>

<p>The lad sat his horse like a skilled equestrian, and indeed it
would be hard to find his superior in that respect throughout
that broad stretch of sparsely settled country. Those who live
on the American frontier are trained from their earliest youth
in the management of quadrupeds, and often display a proficiency
that cannot fail to excite admiration.</p>

<p>Melville's fine breech-loading rifle was slung over his shoulder,
and held in place by a strap that passed in front. It could be
quickly drawn from its position whenever needed. It was not of
the repeating pattern, but the youth was so handy with the weapon
that he could put the cartridges in place, aim, and fire not only
with great accuracy, but with marked rapidity.</p>

<p>In addition, he carried a good revolver, though he did not expect
to use either weapon on the short journey he was making. He followed,
however, the law of the border, which teaches the pioneer never
to venture beyond sight of his home unprepared for every emergency
that is likely to arise.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the forenoon, Melville having made an early
start from the border-town of Barwell, and he was well on his
way to his home, which lay ten miles to the south. "Dot," as his
little sister was called by her friends, had been on a week's
visit to her uncle's at the settlement, the agreement all round
being that she should stay there for a fortnight at least; but
her parents and her big brother rebelled at the end of the week.
They missed the prattle and sunshine which only Dot could bring
into their home, and Melville's heart was delighted when his father
told him to mount Saladin and bring her home.</p>

<p>And when, on the seventh day of her visit, Dot found her handsome
brother had come after her, and was to take her home the following
morning, she leaped into his arms with a cry of happiness; for
though her relatives had never suspected it, she was dreadfully
home-sick and anxious to get back to her own people.</p>

<p>In riding northward to the settlement, young Clarendon followed
the regular trail, over which he had passed scores of times. Not
far from the house he crossed a broad stream at a point where
the current (except when there was rain) was less than two feet
deep. Its shallowness led to its use by all the settlers within
a large radius to the southward, so that the faintly marked trails
converged at this point something like the spokes of a large wheel,
and became one from that point northward to the settlement.</p>

<p>A mile to the east was another crossing which was formerly used.
It was not only broader, but there were one or two deep holes
into which a horse was likely to plunge unless much care was used.
Several unpleasant accidents of this nature led to its practical
abandonment.</p>

<p>The ten miles between the home of the Clarendons and the little
town of Barwell consisted of prairie, stream, and woodland. A
ride over the trail, therefore, during pleasant weather afforded
a most pleasing variety of scenery, this being especially the
case in spring and summer. The eastern trail was more marked in
this respect and it did not unite with the other until within
about two miles of the settlement. Southward from the point of
union the divergence was such that parties separating were quickly
lost to view of each other, remaining thus until the stream of
which I have spoken was crossed. There the country became so open
that on a clear day the vision covered all the space between.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in explaining the "lay of the land,"
as it is called, because it is necessary in order to understand
the incidents that follow.</p>

<p>Melville laughed at the prattle of Dot, who sat in front of him,
one of his arms encircling her chubby form, while Saladin was
allowed to walk and occasionally gallop, as the mood prompted
him.</p>

<p>There was no end of her chatter; and he asked her questions about
her week's experience at Uncle Jack's, and told her in turn how
much he and her father and mother had missed her, and what jolly
times they would have when she got back.</p>

<p>Melville hesitated for a minute on reaching the diverging point
of the paths. He was anxious to get home; but his wish to give
his loved sister all the enjoyment possible in the ride led him
to take the abandoned trail, and it proved a most unfortunate
thing that he did so.</p>

<p>Just here I must tell you that Melville and Dot Clarendon were
dressed very much as boys and girls of their age are dressed to-day
in the more settled parts of my native country. Remember that
the incidents I have set out to tell you took place only a very
few years ago.</p>

<p>Instead of the coon-skin cap, buckskin suit, leggings and moccasins,
of the early frontier, Melville wore a straw hat, a thick flannel
shirt, and, since the weather was quite warm, he was without coat
or vest. His trousers, of the ordinary pattern, were clasped at
the waist by his cartridge belt, and his shapely feet were encased
in strong well-made shoes. His revolver was thrust in his hip-pocket,
and the broad collar of his shirt was clasped at the neck by a
twisted silk handkerchief.</p>

<p>As for Dot, her clustering curls rippled from under a jaunty
straw hat, and fluttered about her pretty shoulders, while the
rest of her visible attire consisted of a simple dress, shoes,
and stockings. The extra clothing taken with her on her visit
was tied in a neat small bundle, fastened to the saddle behind
Melville. Should they encounter any sudden change in the weather,
they were within easy reach, while the lad looked upon himself
as strong enough to make useless any such care for him.</p>

<p>Once or twice Melville stopped Saladin and let Dot down to the
ground, that she might gather some of the bright flowers growing
by the wayside; and at a spring of bubbling icy-cold water both
halted and quaffed their fill, after which Saladin was allowed
to push his nose into the clear fluid and do the same.</p>

<p>Once more they mounted, and without any occurrence worth the
telling, reached the bank of the stream at the Upper Crossing.
He halted a minute or two to look around before entering the water,
for, as you will bear in mind, he had now reached a spot which
gave him a more extended view than any yet passed.</p>

<p>Their own home was in plain sight, and naturally the eyes of
the brother and sister were first turned in that direction. It
appeared just as they expected. Moderate in size, built of logs
somewhat after the fashion on the frontier at an earlier date,
with outbuildings and abundant signs of thrift, it was an excellent
type of the home of the sturdy American settler of the present.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mel!" suddenly exclaimed Dot, calling her brother by the
name she always used, "who is that on horseback?"</p>

<p>Dot pointed to a slight eminence between their house and the
stream; and, shifting his glance, Melville saw an Indian horseman
standing as motionless as if he and his animal were carved in
stone. He seemed to have reined up on the crest of the elevation,
and, coming to a halt, was doing the same as the brother and sister&mdash;surveying
his surroundings.</p>

<p>His position was midway between Melville and his house, and his
horse faced the brother and sister. The distance was too great
to distinguish the features of the red man clearly, but the two
believed he was looking at them.</p>

<p>Now, there was nothing to cause special alarm in this sight,
for it was a common thing to meet Indians in that part of the
country, where indeed many of them may be seen to-day; but the
lad suddenly remembered that when looking in the direction of
his home he had failed to see any signs of life, and he was at
once filled with a misgiving which caused him to swallow a lump
in his throat before answering the question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Who is it, Mel?"</p>

<p>"Some Indian; he is too far off for me to tell who he is, and
likely enough we have never seen him before."</p>

<p>"What's he looking at us so sharply for?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure that he is looking at us; his face seems to be
turned this way, but he may have his eyes on something else."</p>

<p>"Watch him! See what he is doing!"</p>

<p>No need to tell the lad to watch, for his attention was fixed
upon the warrior. Just as Dot spoke he made a signal which the
intelligent youth could not comprehend. He flung one end of a
blanket in the air slightly above and in front of him, and, holding
the other part in his hand, waved it vigorously several times.</p>

<p>That it was intended for the eyes of the brother and sister seemed
beyond all question; but, as I have said, they did not know what
it meant, for it might have signified a number of things. It is
a practice with many Indians to use such means as a taunt to their
enemies, but they generally utter shouts and defiant cries, and
nothing of the kind was now heard.</p>

<p>Besides this, it was not to be supposed that a Sioux warrior
(that, no doubt, being the tribe of the red man before them) would
indulge in any such action in the presence of a single white youth
and small girl.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said Melville, "but I'll be as polite
as he."</p>

<p>With which, he took off his hat and swung it above his head.
Then, seeing that the Indian had ceased waving his blanket, he
replaced his hat, still watching his movements.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The distance was too great to distinguish the
features of the red man." &mdash;Page 7]</p>

<p>The next moment the Sioux wheeled his horse, and heading westward,
galloped off with such speed that he almost instantly vanished.</p>

<p>The Indian had been gone less than a minute when Melville spoke
to Saladin, and he stepped into the water.</p>

<p>The instant his hoof rested on dry land the youth struck him
into a swift canter, which was not checked until he arrived at
the house. While yet some distance, the lad's fears were deepened
by what he saw, or rather by what he failed to see. Not a horse
or cow was in sight; only the ducks and chickens were there, the
former waddling to the water.</p>

<p>When Archie Clarendon made his home on that spot, a few years
before, one of the questions he had to meet was as to the best
way of guarding against attacks from Indians, for there were plenty
of them in that part of the country. There are very few red men
who will not steal; and they are so fond of "firewater," or intoxicating
drink, that they are likely to commit worse crimes.</p>

<p>The pioneer, therefore, built his house much stronger than he
would have done had he waited several years before putting it
up.</p>

<p>It was made of logs, strongly put together, and the windows were
so narrow that no person, unless very slim, could push his way
through them. Of course the door was heavy, and it could be fastened
in its place so firmly that it would have resisted the assault
of a strong body of men.</p>

<p>By this time Melville, who had galloped up to the front and brought
his horse to a halt, was almost sure that something dreadful had
happened, and he hesitated a moment before dismounting or lowering
Dot to the ground. She began twisting about in his grasp, saying
plaintively&mdash;</p>

<p>"Let me down, Mel; I want to see papa and mamma."</p>

<p>"I don't think they are there," he said, again swallowing a lump
in his throat.</p>

<p>She turned her head around and looked wonderingly up in his face,
not knowing what he meant. He could not explain, and he allowed
her to drop lightly on her feet.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," he called, "till I take a look inside."</p>

<p>In imagination he saw an awful sight. It was that of his beloved
parents slain by the cruel red men&mdash;one of whom had waved his
blanket tauntingly at him only a few minutes before.</p>

<p>He could not bear that Dot should look upon the scene that would
haunt her, as it would haunt him, to her dying day. He meant to
hold her back until he could take a look inside; but her nimble
feet carried her ahead, and she was on the porch before he could
check her.</p>

<p>Saladin was a horse that would stand without tying; and, paying
no heed to him, the youth hurried after his sister, seizing her
hand as it was raised to draw the string hanging outside the door.</p>

<p>"Dot," he said, "why do you not obey me? You must wait till I
first go in."</p>

<p>It was not often her big brother spoke so sternly, and there
came a tear into each of the bright eyes, as she stepped back
and poutingly waited for him to do as he thought best.</p>

<p>Melville raised his hand to draw the latch, but his heart failed.
Stepping to one side, he peered through the narrow window that
helped to light up the lower floor.</p>

<p>The muslin curtain was partly drawn, but he was able to see most
of the interior. Table, chairs, and furniture were all in place,
but not a glimpse of a living person was visible.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He peered through the narrow window."]</p>

<p>The emotions of childhood are as changeable as the shadows of
the flitting clouds.</p>

<p>Dot was pouting while Mel stood irresolute on the small porch,
and was sure she would never, never speak to the mean fellow again;
but the instant he peeped through the narrow window she forgot
everything else, and darted forward to take her place at his side,
and find out what it was that made him act so queerly.</p>

<p>Before she reached him she stopped short with the exclamation&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Mel! here's a letter for you!"</p>
