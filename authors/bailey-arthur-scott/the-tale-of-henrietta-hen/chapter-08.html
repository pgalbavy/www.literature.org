<p>Henrietta Hen had commanded the Rooster to wait until daylight before he
began to crow.
</p>
<p>He saw that she had made up her mind that he must obey her. But he knew
he couldn't. And he always took great pains to be polite to the ladies.
</p><p>It was a wonder the Rooster didn't turn red in the face. He had never
found himself in such a corner before.
</p><p>"You don't understand," he blurted. "I'd be delighted to oblige you, but
if I didn't crow until after the sun rose I'd never crow again."
</p><p>"We could stand that," was Henrietta Hen's grim reply.
</p><p>"Perhaps!" he admitted--for she made him feel strangely humble. "But
could you stand it if the night lasted forever?"
</p><p>"You're talking nonsense now," she declared.
</p><p>"You don't understand," he told her again. "And I must say I'm surprised,
madam, that you didn't know it was I that waked the sun up every morning.
<u>That's</u> why I crow so early."
</p><p>Henrietta Hen was so astonished that she didn't know what to say. She
thought deeply for a time--or as deeply as she could.
</p><p>"Have you not noticed," the Rooster inquired, "that the sun never rises
until I've crowed loudly a good many times?"
</p><p>"No! No--I haven't," Henrietta murmured. "But now that you speak of it, I
see that it's so."
</p><p>"Exactly!" he said. "And often, madam, I have to crow a long time before
he peeps over Blue Mountain. It's lucky I have a good, strong voice," the
Rooster, added with a smirk, for he was feeling more at his ease. "If I
had a thin, squeaky crow such as those worthless cockerels have, Farmer
Green would have had to do many a day's work in the dark."
</p><p>"Goodness!" Henrietta Hen gasped. "Do crow your loudest the moment you
wake up, Mr. Rooster! Do make all the noise you can!" And he promised
faithfully that he would.
</p><p>Henrietta left him then. Somehow she couldn't get their talk out of her
mind. And soon she had an unhappy thought. What if anything should happen
to the Rooster's voice?
</p><p>The moment that question popped into her head, Henrietta Hen hurried back
to the Rooster.
</p><p>"Do be careful!" she besought him. "Don't get your feet wet! For if you
caught cold you might be so hoarse that you couldn't speak above a
whisper."
</p><p>The Rooster thanked her politely for thinking of his health.
</p><p>"I always take good care of myself," he assured her.
</p><p>"It looks like rain this minute," she said as she cast an anxious glance
at the sky. "Hadn't you better run into the barn?"
</p><p>He thought otherwise--and said as much.
</p><p>"You ought to wear rubbers every day," she chided him, as she went away
again.
</p><p>Soon Henrietta returned once more to urge the Rooster to carry an
umbrella. And it wasn't long after that when she came bustling up to him
and informed him that a warm muffler about his throat wouldn't be amiss.
</p><p>There seemed to be no end to her suggestions. And though at first the
Rooster had liked to hear them (without having any idea of following
them) after a time Henrietta's attentions began to annoy him.
</p><p>"Great cracked corn!" he exclaimed. "This Henrietta Hen is getting to be
a pest."
