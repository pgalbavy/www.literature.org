<p>When Captain Shirril told his wife that she and the servant were
likely to find something to engage their attention above stairs,
he spoke more in jest than earnest, but the remark served to prove
the adage that many a truth is spoken at such times.</p>

<p>Of course, the upper part of the house was in as deep gloom as
the lower portion, and the women took good care in passing the
windows lest some stray shot should reach them. They needed no
light, for every inch of space had long been familiar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Shirril walked quietly through the larger apartment, without
coming upon anything to attract notice, after which she went to
her own room, Dinah accompanying her all the way.</p>

<p>"I don't see that there is any need of our remaining here," said
the mistress, "for there is no possible way of any of the Indians
effecting an entrance."</p>

<p>"'Ceptin' frough de trap-door," ventured the servant.</p>

<p>"That is over your room, but the scuttle is fastened as securely
as the one below stairs."</p>

<p>"Dunno 'bout dat; I's gwine to see," was the sturdy response
of Dinah, as she walked rather heavily into her own boudoir; "any
man dat comes foolin' 'round dar is gwine to get hisself in trouble."</p>

<p>Knowing precisely where the opening was located (an unusual feature
of the houses in that section), she stopped directly under it,
and reached upward with one of her powerful hands. The roof was
still nearer the floor than was the latter to the floor below,
so that it was easy for her to place her fingers against the iron
hook which held it in place.</p>

<p>Of course she found the scuttle just as it had been for many
a day; and Mrs. Shirril was right in saying it was as firmly secured
as the ponderous door beneath them, for the impossibility of getting
a purchase from the roof, made only a slight resistance necessary
from beneath. A dozen bolts and bars could not have rendered it
stronger.</p>

<p>"It 'pears to be all right," mused Dinah, "but folks can't be
too keerful at sich times&mdash;sh! what dat?"</p>

<p>Her ears, which were as keen as those of her friends, heard a
suspicious noise overhead. It was faint, but unmistakable. The
startling truth could not be doubted: one of the Comanches, if
not more, was on the roof!</p>

<p>"If dat isn't shameful," she muttered, failing to apprise her
mistress of the alarming discovery; "I wander what he can be after
up dar&mdash;de Lor' a massy!"</p>

<p>The last shock was caused by a scratching which showed that the
intruder was trying to lift up the scuttle.</p>

<p>Evidently the Indians had made themselves as familiar with Captain
Shirril's domicile as they could without entering it. They had
noticed the scuttle, and the possibility that it might be unfastened
led one of them to climb undetected to the roof to make sure about
it.</p>

<p>"Dat onmannerly warmint knows dat dat door am right over <em>my</em>
room," muttered the indignant Dinah; "and instead ob comin' in
by de reg'lar way, as a gemman orter do, he's gwine to try to
steal in frough de roof. When I get done wid him," she added,
with rising wrath, "he'll know better nor dat."</p>

<p>Still Mrs. Shirril kept her place in her own apartment, where
she was striving so hard to learn something, by peering through
and listening at one of her windows, that she noticed nothing
else, though, as yet, the noise was so slight that it would have
escaped the ears of Dinah herself, had she not been quite near
it.</p>

<p>The colored woman groped around in the dark until her hand rested
upon the only chair in the apartment. This she noiselessly placed
under the scuttle, and stepped upon it with the same extreme care.</p>

<p>Her position was now such that had the door been open and she
standing upright, her head, shoulders, and a part of her waist
would have been above the roof. She had leaned her gun against
the side of the chair, so that, if needed, it was within quick
reach. Then she assumed a stooping posture, with her head gently
touching the underside of the door, and, steadying herself by
grasping the iron hook, she stood motionless and listening.</p>

<p>"Yes, <em>he's dar</em>!" was her instant conclusion, "and de
wiper is tryin' to onfasten de skylight ob my obpartment."</p>

<p>Dinah's many years spent in this wild region had given her a
knowledge that she could not have gained otherwise. She knew that
so long as the Comanche contented himself with trying to open
the scuttle, nothing was to be feared; but, baffled in that, he
was not likely to drop to the ground again without attempting
more serious mischief, and that serious mischief could take only
the single dreaded form of setting fire to the building.</p>

<p>It seems almost beyond belief, but it is a fact that this colored
woman determined on defeating the purpose of the redskin, by the
most audacious means at the command of anyone. She resolved to
climb out on the roof and assail the Comanche.</p>

<p>Since she knew her mistress would peremptorily forbid anything
of the kind, she cunningly took all the means at her command to
prevent her plan becoming known to Mrs. Shirril, until it should
be too late for her to interfere.</p>

<p>Stepping gently down to the floor, she moved the few steps necessary
to reach the door opening into the other room, and which had not
been closed.</p>

<p>"Is you dar, Mrs. Shirril?" she asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Yes, Dinah," came the guarded response; "don't bother me for
a few minutes; I want to watch and listen."</p>

<p>"All right; <em>dat</em> suits me," muttered the servant with
a chuckle, as she closed the door with the utmost care.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to favor the astounding purpose of the brave
African, who again stepped upon the chair, though in her first
confusion she narrowly missed overturning it, and brought her
head against the scuttle.</p>

<p>She was disappointed at first, because she heard nothing, but
a moment's listening told her that her visitor was still on deck,
or rather on the roof. The fact that, after finding he could not
effect an entrance, he still stayed, made it look as if he was
meditating mischief of the very nature so much feared.</p>

<p>In accordance with her daring scheme, Dinah now softly slipped
the hook from its fastening, holding it between her fingers for
a moment before doing anything more. Had the Comanche known how
matters stood, a quick upward flirt on his part, even though the
hold was slight, would have flung the door flat on the roof and
opened the way to the interior of the Texan's cabin.</p>

<p>But not knowing nor suspecting anything of the kind, he did not
make the attempt.</p>

<p>With no more tremor of the nerve than she would have felt in
trying to kill a fly, Dinah softly pushed up the door for an inch
at its outermost edge. This gave her a view of the roof on the
side in front, with a shortened survey of the portion still nearer.</p>

<p>Her eyes were keen, but they detected nothing of the Comanche
who was prowling about the scuttle only a few moments before.
The darkness was not dense enough to prevent her seeing to the
edge of the roof on all sides, had her view been unobstructed.
Could she have dared to throw back the door, and raise her head
above the peak of the roof, she could have traced the outlines
of the eaves in every direction.</p>

<p>But she was too wise to try anything like that. The slightest
noise on her part would be heard by the Indian, who, like all
members of the American race, had his senses trained to a fineness
that seems marvellous to the Caucasian. He would take the alarm
on the instant, and leap to the ground, or, what was more likely,
assail her with his knife, since his rifle had been left below.</p>

<p>"What's become ob dat villain?" Dinah asked herself, after peering
about in the gloom for a full minute; "I wonder wheder he hasn't
got 'shamed ob hisself, and hab slunk off and is gwine down to
knock at my door and ax my pardon &mdash;Lor' a massy!"</p>

<p>There was good cause for this alarm on her part, for at that
moment she made a discovery that fairly took away her breath.</p>
