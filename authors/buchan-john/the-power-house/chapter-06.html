<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I was working late at the Temple next day, and it was nearly
seven before I got up to go home.  Macgillivray had telephoned
to me in the afternoon saying he wanted to see me, and suggesting
dinner at the Club, and I had told him I should come straight
there from my Chambers.  But just after six he had rung me up
again and proposed another meeting place.</p>

<p>"I've got some very important news for you, and want to be quiet.
There's a little place where I sometimes dine &mdash;Rapaccini's,
in Antioch Street.  I'll meet you there at half-past seven."</p>

<p>I agreed, and sent a message to Chapman at the flat, telling
him I would be out to dinner.  It was a Wednesday night, so the
House rose early.  He asked me where I was dining, and I told
him, but I did not mention with whom.  His voice sounded very
cross, for he hated a lonely meal.</p>

<p>It was a hot, still night, and I had had a heavy day in Court,
so heavy that my private anxieties had almost slipped from my
mind.  I walked along the Embankment, and up Regent Street towards
Oxford Circus.  Antioch Street, as I had learned from the Directory,
was in the area between Langham Place and Tottenham Court Road. 
I wondered vaguely why Macgillivray should have chosen such an
out-of-the-way spot, but I knew him for a man of many whims.</p>

<p>The street, when I found it, turned out to be a respectable little
place, boarding-houses and architects' offices, with a few antiquity
shops and a picture-cleaner's.  The restaurant took some finding,
for it was one of those discreet establishments, common enough
in France, where no edibles are displayed in the British fashion,
and muslin half-curtains deck the windows.  Only the doormat,
lettered with the proprietor's name, remained to guide the hungry.</p>

<p>I gave a waiter my hat and stick, and was ushered into a garish
dining-room, apparently full of people.  A single violinist was
discoursing music from beside the grill.  The occupants were not
quite the kind one expects to find in an eating-house in a side
street.  The men were all in evening dress with white waistcoats,
and the women looked either demi-mondaines or those who follow
their taste in clothes.  Various eyes looked curiously at me as
I entered. I guessed that the restaurant had, by one of those
odd freaks of Londoners, become for a moment the fashion.</p>

<p>The proprietor met me half way up the room.  He might call himself
Rapaccini, but he was obviously a German.</p>

<p>"Mr. Geelvrai," he nodded.  "He has engaged a private room. 
Vill you follow, sir?"</p>

<p>A narrow stairway broke into the wall on the left side of the
dining-room.  I followed the manager up it and along a short corridor
to a door which filled its end.  He ushered me into a brightly
lit little room where a table was laid for two.</p>

<p>"Mr. Geelvrai comes often here," said the manager.  "He vill
be late&mdash;sometimes.  Everything is ready, sir.  I hope you vill
be pleased."</p>

<p>It looked inviting enough, but the air smelt stuffy.  Then I
saw that, though the night was warm, the window was shut and the
curtains drawn.  I pulled back the curtains, and, to my surprise,
saw that the shutters were closed.</p>

<p>"You must open these," I said, "or we'll stifle."</p>

<p>The manager glanced at the window.  "I vill send a waiter," he
said, and departed.  The door seemed to shut with an odd click.</p>

<p>I flung myself down in one of the armchairs, for I was feeling
pretty tired.  The little table beckoned alluringly, for I was
also hungry. I remember there was a mass of pink roses on it. 
A bottle of champagne, with the cork loose, stood in a wine-cooler
on the side-board, and there was an unopened bottle beside it. 
It seemed to me that Macgillivray, when he dined here, did himself
rather well.</p>

<p>The promised waiter did not arrive, and the stuffiness was making
me very thirsty.  I looked for a bell, but could not see one. 
My watch told me it was now a quarter to eight, but there was
no sign of Macgillivray.  I poured myself out a glass of champagne
from the opened bottle, and was just about to drink it when my
eye caught something in a corner of the room.</p>

<p>It was one of those little mid-Victorian corner tables &mdash;I
believe they call them "what-nots"&mdash;which you will find in any
boarding-house, littered up with photographs and coral and "Presents
from Brighton." On this one stood a photograph in a shabby frame,
and I thought I recognised it.</p>

<p>I crossed the room and picked it up.  It showed a man of thirty,
with short side-whiskers and ill-fitting jaw and a drooping moustache.
The duplicate of it was in Macgillivray's cabinet.  It was Mr.
Routh, the ex-Union leader.</p>

<p>There was nothing very remarkable about that, after all, but
it gave me a nasty shock.  The room now seemed a sinister place,
as well as intolerably close.  There was still no sign of the
waiter to open the window, so I thought I would wait for Macgillivray
downstairs.</p>

<p>But the door would not open.  The handle would not turn.  It
did not seem to be locked, but rather to have shut with some kind
of patent spring.  I noticed that the whole thing was a powerful
piece of oak, with a heavy framework, very unlike the usual flimsy
restaurant doors.</p>

<p>My first instinct was to make a deuce of a row and attract the
attention of the diners below.  I own I was beginning to feel
badly frightened.  Clearly, I had got into some sort of trap.
Macgillivray's invitation might have been a hoax, for it is not
difficult to counterfeit a man's voice on the telephone.  With
an effort I forced myself into calmness.  It was preposterous
to think that anything could happen to me in a room not thirty
feet from where a score or two of ordinary citizens were dining. 
I had only to raise my voice to bring inquirers.</p>

<p>Yes, but above all things I did not want a row.  It would never
do for a rising lawyer and a Member of Parliament to be found
shouting for help in an upper chamber of a Bloomsbury restaurant. 
The worst deduction would be drawn from the open bottle of champagne. 
Besides, it might be all right after all.  The door might have
got stuck. Macgillivray at that very moment might be on his way
up.</p>

<p>So I sat down and waited.  Then I remembered my thirst, and stretched
out my hand to the glass of champagne.</p>

<p>But at that instant I looked towards the window, and set down
the wine untasted.</p>

<p>It was a very odd window.  The lower end was about flush with
the floor, and the hinges of the shutters seemed to be only on
one side. As I stared, I began to wonder whether it was a window
at all.</p>

<p>Next moment my doubts were solved.  The window swung open like
a door, and in the dark cavity stood a man.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, I knew him.  His figure was not one that is
readily forgotten.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Docker," I said.  "Will you have a glass of
champagne?"</p>

<p>A year before, on the South Eastern Circuit, I had appeared for
the defence in a burglary case.  Criminal law was not my province,
but now and then I took a case to keep my hand in, for it is the
best training in the world for the handling of witnesses.  This
case had been peculiar.  A certain Bill Docker was the accused,
a gentleman who bore a bad reputation in the eyes of the police. 
The evidence against him was strong, but it was more or less tainted,
being chiefly that of two former accomplices&mdash;a proof that there
is small truth in the proverbial honour among thieves.  It was
an ugly business, and my sympathies were with the accused, for
though he may very well have been guilty, yet he had been the
victim of a shabby trick.  Anyhow, I put my back into the case,
and after a hard struggle got a verdict of "Not guilty."  Mr.
Docker had been kind enough to express his appreciation of my
efforts, and to ask, in a hoarse whisper, how I had "squared the
old bird," meaning the Judge. He did not understand the subtleties
of the English law of evidence.</p>

<p>He shambled into the room, a huge, hulking figure of a man, with
the thickness of chest which, under happier circumstances, might
have made him a terror in the prize-ring.  His features wore a
heavy scowl, which slowly cleared to a flicker of recognition.</p>

<p>"By God, it's the lawyer-chap," he muttered.</p>

<p>I pointed to the glass of champagne.</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do," he said.  "'Ere's health!"  He swallowed
the wine at a gulp, and wiped his mouth on his sleeve.  "'Ave
a drop yourself, guvnor," he added.  "A glass of bubbly will cheer
you up."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Docker," I said, "I hope I see you fit."  I was getting
wonderfully collected now that the suspense was over.</p>

<p>"Pretty fair, sir.  Pretty fair.  Able to do my day's work like
an honest man."</p>

<p>"And what brings you here?"</p>

<p>"A little job I'm on.  Some friends of mine wants you out of
the road for a bit, and they've sent me to fetch you.  It's a
bit of luck for you that you've struck a pal.  We needn't 'ave
no unpleasantness, seein' we're both what you might call men of
the world."</p>

<p>"I appreciate the compliment," I said.  "But where do you propose
to take me?"</p>

<p>"Dunno.  It's some lay near the Docks.  I've got a motor-car
waitin' at the back of the 'ouse."</p>

<p>"But supposing I don't want to go?"</p>

<p>"My orders hadmit no hexcuse," he said solemnly.  "You're a sensible
chap, and can see that in a scrap I could down you easy."</p>

<p>"Very likely," I said.  "But, man, you must be mad to talk like
that. Downstairs there is a dining-room fall of people.  I have
only to lift my voice to bring the police."</p>

<p>"You're a kid," he said scornfully.  "Them geesers downstairs
are all in the job.  That was a flat-catching rig to get you up
here so as you wouldn't suspect nothing.  If you was to go down
now&mdash;which you ain't going to be allowed to do&mdash;you wouldn't find
a blamed soul in the place.  I must say you're a bit softer than
I 'oped after the 'andsome way you talked over the old juggins
with the wig at Maidstone."</p>

<p>Mr. Docker took the bottle from the wine-cooler and filled himself
another glass.</p>

<p>It sounded horribly convincing.  If I was to be kidnapped and
smuggled away Lumley would have scored half a success.  Not the
whole, for, as I swiftly reflected, I had put Felix on the track
of Tuke, and there was every chance that Tommy and Pitt-Heron
would be saved.  But for myself it looked pretty black.  The more
my scheme succeeded the more likely the Power-House would be to
wreak its vengeance on me once I was spirited from the open-air
world into its dark labyrinths.</p>

<p>I made a great effort to keep my voice even and calm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Docker," I said.  "I once did you a good turn.  But for
me you might be doing time now instead of drinking champagne like
a gentleman.  Your pals played you a pretty low trick, and that
was why I stuck out for you.  I didn't think you were the kind
of man to forget a friend."</p>

<p>"No more I am," said he.  "The man who says Bill Docker would
go back on a pal is a liar."</p>

<p>"Well, here's your chance to pay your debts.  The men who employ
you are my deadly enemies, and want to do me in.  I'm not a match
for you.  You're a stronger fellow and can drag me off and hand
me over to them.  But if you do I'm done with.  Make no mistake
about that. I put it to you as a decent fellow.  Are you going
to go back on the man who has been a good friend to you?"</p>

<p>He shifted from one foot to another with his eyes on the ceiling. 
He was obviously in difficulties.  Then he tried another glass
of champagne.</p>

<p>"I dursn't, guv'nor.  I dursn't let you go.  Them I work for
would cut my throat as soon as look at me.  Besides, it ain't
no good.  If I was to go off and leave you there'd be plenty more
in this 'ouse as would do the job.  You're up against it, guv'nor. 
But take a sensible view and come with me.  They don't mean you
no real 'arm. I'll take my Bible oath on it.  Only to keep you
quiet for a bit, for you've run across one of their games.  They
won't do you no 'urt if you speak 'em fair.  Be a sport and take
it smiling-like&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You're afraid of them," I said.</p>

<p>"Yuss.  I'm afraid.  Black afraid.  So would you be if you knew
the gents.  I'd rather take on the whole Rat Lane crowd&mdash;you know
them as I mean&mdash;on a Saturday night, when they're out for business,
than go back to my gents and say as 'ow I had shirked the job."</p>

<p>He shivered.  "Good Lord, they'd freeze the 'eart out of a bull-pup."</p>

<p>"You're afraid," I said slowly.  "So you're going to give me
up to the men you're afraid of to do as they like with me.  I
never expected it of you, Bill.  I thought you were the kind of
lad who would send any gang to the devil before you'd go back
on a pal."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," he said almost plaintively.  "You don't 'alf
know the 'ole I'm in."  His eye seemed to be wandering, and he
yawned deeply.</p>

<p>Just then a great noise began below.  I heard a voice speaking,
a loud peremptory voice.  Then my name was shouted: "Leithen! 
Leithen! Are you there?"</p>

<p>There could be no mistaking that broad Yorkshire tongue.  By
some miracle Chapman had followed me and was raising Cain downstairs.</p>

<p>My heart leaped with the sudden revulsion.  "I'm here," I yelled.
"Upstairs.  Come up and let me out!"</p>

<p>Then I turned with a smile of triumph to Bill.</p>

<p>"My friends have come," I said.  "You're too late for the job. 
Get back and tell your masters that."</p>

<p>He was swaying on his feet, and he suddenly lurched towards me. 
"You come along.  By God, you think you've done me.  I'll let
you see."</p>

<p>His voice was growing thick and he stopped short.  "What the
'ell's wrong with me?" he gasped.  "I'm goin' all queer.  I..."</p>

<p>He was like a man far gone in liquor, but three glasses of champagne
would never have touched a head like Bill's.  I saw what was up
with him.  He was not drunk, but drugged.</p>

<p>"They've doped the wine," I cried.  "They put it there for me
to drink it and go to sleep."</p>

<p>There is always something which is the last straw to any man. 
You may insult and outrage him and he will bear it patiently,
but touch the quick in his temper and he will turn.  Apparently
for Bill drugging was the unforgivable sin.  His eye lost for
a moment its confusion.  He squared his shoulders and roared like
a bull.</p>

<p>"Doped, by God," he cried.  "Who done it?"</p>

<p>"The men who shut me in this room.  Burst that door and you will
find them."</p>

<p>He turned a blazing face on the locked door and hurled his huge
weight on it.  It cracked and bent but the lock and hinges held. 
I could see that sleep was overwhelming him and that his limbs
were stiffening, but his anger was still strong enough for another
effort. Again he drew himself together like a big cat and flung
himself on the woodwork.  The hinges tore from the jambs and the
whole outfit fell forward into the passage in a cloud of splinters
and dust and broken plaster.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Docker's final effort.  He lay on the top of the wreckage
he had made, like Samson among the ruins of Gaza, a senseless
and slumbering hulk.</p>

<p>I picked up the unopened bottle of champagne&mdash;it was the only
weapon available&mdash;and stepped over his body.  I was beginning
to enjoy myself amazingly.</p>

<p>As I expected, there was a man in the corridor, a little fellow
in waiter's clothes, with a tweed jacket instead of a dress coat. 
If he had a pistol I knew I was done, but I gambled upon the disinclination
of the management for the sound of shooting.</p>

<p>He had a knife, but he never had a chance to use it.  My champagne
bottle descended on his head and he dropped like a log.</p>

<p>There were men coming upstairs&mdash;not Chapman, for I still heard
his hoarse shouts in the dining-room.  If they once got up they
could force me back through that hideous room by the door through
which Docker had come, and in five minutes I should be in their
motor-car.</p>

<p>There was only one thing to do.  I jumped from the stair-head
right down among them.  I think there were three, and my descent
toppled them over.  We rolled in a wild, whirling mass and cascaded
into the dining-room, where my head bumped violently on the parquet.</p>

<p>I expected a bit of a grapple, but none came.  My wits were pretty
woolly, but I managed to scramble to my feet.  The heels of my
enemies were disappearing up the staircase.  Chapman was pawing
my ribs to discover if there were any bones broken.  There was
not another soul in the room except two policemen who were pushing
their way in from the street.</p>

<p>Chapman was flushed and breathing heavily: his coat had a big
split down the seams at the shoulder, but his face was happy as
a child's.</p>

<p>I caught his arm and spoke in his ear.  "We've got to get out
of this at once.  How can we square these policemen?  There must
be no inquiry and nothing in the papers.  Do you hear?"</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Chapman.  "These bobbies are friends
of mine, two good lads from Wensleydale.  On my road here I told
them to give me a bit of law and follow me, for I thought they
might be wanted.  They didn't come too soon to spoil sport, for
I've been knocking furriners about for ten minutes.  You seem
to have been putting up a tidy scrap yourself."</p>

<p>"Let's get home first," I said, for I was beginning to think
of the bigger thing.</p>

<p>I wrote a chit for Macgillivray which I asked one of the constables
to take to Scotland Yard.  It was to beg that nothing should be
done yet in the business of the restaurant, and above all that
nothing should get into the papers.  Then I asked the other to
see us home. It was a queer request for two able-bodied men to
make on a summer evening in the busiest part of London, but I
was taking no chances. The Power-House had declared war on me,
and I knew it would be war without quarter.</p>

<p>I was in a fever to get out of that place.  My momentary lust
of battle had gone, and every stone of that building seemed to
me a threat.  Chapman would have liked to spend a happy hour rummaging
through the house, but the gravity of my face persuaded him. 
The truth is I was bewildered.  I could not understand the reason
of this sudden attack.  Lumley's spies must long ago have told
him enough to connect me with the Bokhara business.  My visits
to the Embassy alone were sufficient proof.  But now he must have
found out something new, something which startled him, or else
there had been wild doings in Turkestan.</p>

<p>I won't forget that walk home in a hurry.  It was a fine July
twilight.  The streets were full of the usual crowd, shop-girls
in thin frocks, promenading clerks, and all the flotsam of a London
summer.  You would have said it was the safest place on earth. 
But I was glad we had the policeman with us, who at the end of
one beat passed us on to his colleague, and I was glad of Chapman. 
For I am morally certain I would never have got home alone.</p>

<p>The queer thing is that there was no sign of trouble till we
got into Oxford Street.  Then I became aware that there were people
on those pavements who knew all about me.  I first observed it
at the mouth of one of those little dark side-alleys which run
up into mews and small dingy courts.  I found myself being skilfully
edged away from Chapman into the shadow, but I noticed it in time
and butted my way back to the pavement.  I couldn't make out who
the people were who hustled me.  They seemed nondescripts of all
sorts, but I fancied there were women among them.</p>

<p>This happened twice, and I got wary, but I was nearly caught
before we reached Oxford Circus.  There was a front of a big shop
rebuilding, and the usual wooden barricade with a gate.  Just
as we passed it there was a special throng on the pavement and
I, being next the wall, got pushed against the gate.  Suddenly
it gave and I was pressed inward.  I was right inside before I
realised my danger, and the gate was closing.  There must have
been people there, but I could see nothing in the gloom.</p>

<p>It was no time for false pride.  I yelled to Chapman and the
next second his burly shoulder was in the gap.  The hustlers vanished
and I seemed to hear a polite voice begging my pardon.</p>

<p>After that Chapman and I linked arms and struck across Mayfair. 
But I did not feel safe till I was in the flat with the door bolted.</p>

<p>We had a long drink and I stretched myself in an armchair, for
I was as tired as if I had come out of a big game of Rugby football.</p>

<p>"I owe you a good deal, old man," I said.  "I think I'll join
the Labour Party.  You can tell your fellows to send me their
whips. What possessed you to come to look for me?"</p>

<p>The explanation was simple.  I had mentioned the restaurant in
my telephone message, and the name had awakened a recollection
in Chapman's mind.  He could not fix it at first, but by and by
he remembered that the place had cropped up in the Routh case. 
Routh's London headquarters had been at the restaurant in Antioch
Street.  As soon as he remembered this he got into a taxi and
descended at the corner of the street, where by sheer luck he
fell in with his Wensleydale friends.</p>

<p>He said he had marched into the restaurant and found it empty,
but for an ill-favoured manager, who denied all knowledge of me. 
Then fortunately he chose to make certain by shouting my name,
and heard my answer.  After that he knocked the manager down,
and was presently assaulted by several men whom he described as
"furrin' muck."  They had knives, of which he made very little,
for he seems to have swung a table as a battering ram and left
sore limbs behind him.</p>

<p>He was on the top of his form.  "I haven't enjoyed anything so
much since I was a lad at school," he informed me.  "I was beginning
to think your Power-House was a wash-out, but Lord I it's been
busy enough to-night.  This is what I call life!"</p>

<p>My spirits could not keep pace with his.  The truth is that I
was miserably puzzled&mdash;not afraid so much as mystified.  I couldn't
make out this sudden dead-set at me.  Either they knew more than
I bargained for or I knew far too little.</p>

<p>"It's all very well," I said, "but I don't see how this is going
to end.  We can't keep up the pace long.  At this rate it will
be only a matter of hours till they get me."</p>

<p>We pretty well barricaded ourselves in the flat, and, at his
earnest request, I restored to Chapman his revolver.  Then I got
the clue I had been longing for.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o'clock, while we were sitting smoking, when
the telephone bell rang.  It was Felix who spoke.</p>

<p>"I have news for you," he said.  "The hunters have met the hunted
and one of the hunters is dead.  The other is a prisoner in our
hands. He has confessed."</p>

<p>It had been black murder in intent.  The frontier police had
shadowed the two men into the cup of a glen where they met Tommy
and Pitt-Heron.  The four had spoken together for a little, and
then Tuke had fired deliberately at Charles and had grazed his
ear.  Whereupon Tommy had charged him and knocked the pistol from
his hand.  The assailant had fled, but a long shot from the police
on the hillside had toppled him over.  Tommy had felled Saronov
with his fists, and the man had abjectly surrendered.  He had
confessed, Felix said, but what the confession was he did not
know.</p>
