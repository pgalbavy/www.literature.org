<p>The night was even closer at hand than our friends suspected.
In the forest, where the withdrawal of the sun was almost simultaneous
with darkness, it came without much warning. The gloom was already
settling over the water, and Haverland instantly shot the canoe
from under the shrubbery out into the stream. There were rowlocks
and oars for a second person, and Graham took up a couple and
joined his labors with his friend, while Haldidge took the steering
oar. As they passed boldly into the channel, the canoe ahead was
just disappearing around a bend below.</p>

<p>"Come, this won’t do; we musn’t let them keep out of our sight,"
said Haverland, dipping his oars deep into the water.</p>

<p>A heavy darkness was fast settling over the river, and our friends
noted another thing. A thick, peculiar fog, or mist, such as is
often seen of summer nights, upon a sheet of water, was already
beginning to envelop the banks and river. This, as will be evident,
while it would allow the pursuers to approach the Indian canoe
much closer than otherwise, still gave the latter a much greater
chance of eluding them. Haldidge hardly knew whether to be pleased
with this or not.</p>

<p>"It may help us in the beginning, boys, but we’ve got to hold
on till it’s fairly down on us. If the rascals catch a glimpse
of us before, they’ll give us the slip as sure as fate. Just lay
on your oars a few minutes. We can float down with the current."</p>

<p>"I allow it’s the best plan, although I am much in favor of dashing
and ending the matter at once," remarked Graham, nervously handling
his oars.</p>

<p>"And while I think of it," pursued Haldidge, "I don’t see as
it would do any hurt to muffle the oars."</p>

<p>Before starting, they had abundantly provided themselves with
means for this and, in a few moments a quantity of cloth was forced
into the rowlocks, so as to be able to give full sweep to the
oars without making enough noise to attract suspicion from the
shore, unless an ear was listening more intently than usual.</p>

<p>By this time, too, the thick mist mentioned, had enveloped the
river in an impenetrable cloud, and they shot boldly into it.
The light vessel flew as swiftly and noiselessly as a bird over
the water. Haldidge understood every turn and eddy in the stream,
and guided the canoe with unerring certainty around the sharp
bends, and by the rocks whose black heads now and then shot backward
within a few feet of their side.</p>

<p>In this way a mile was passed when he raised his hand as a signal
for them to cease efforts for a moment.</p>

<p>"Listen!" he uttered.</p>

<p>All did so, and faintly, yet distinctly and distantly, they heard
the almost inaudible dip of oars, and the click of the rowlocks.</p>

<p>"Is that above or below?" asked Haverland, bending his head and
intently listening.</p>

<p>"I think we have <em>passed</em> them <em>sure</em> enough,"
replied Graham.</p>

<p>The sound certainly appeared to come from above them, and all
were constrained to believe that, rowing as swiftly and powerfully
as they did, they must have swept by them in the darkness without
suspecting their proximity.</p>

<p>"Can it be possible?" questioned Haldidge, wonderingly and doubtingly.</p>

<p>But such was the character of the river-banks at this point,
that all had been deceived in listening to the sounds, and the
Indians were all the time leaving them far behind. It was not
until they heard unmistakably the sounds receding in the distance,
that they became conscious of the true state of matters. At that
moment, as they were dying out, they all heard them plainly enough
far below.</p>

<p>"We might have known it," said Haldidge in vexation. "You’ve
got to lay to it, to catch them now."</p>

<p>"But is there not danger of running afoul of them?"</p>

<p>"Not if we are careful. I think they will run into shore soon,
and if so, it will be the eastern bank. I will hug that closely,
and keep my ears open."</p>

<p>The two now bent to their oars with redoubled powers. They dipped
the ashen blades deeply, and pulled until they bent dangerously,
while the water parted in foam at its rushing prow, and spread
away in a foamy pyramid behind.</p>

<p>The effect of this was soon apparent. The rattle of the oars
ahead grew plainer and plainer at each stroke, and it was evident
that they were gaining finely. Haverland’s arm was thrilled with
tenfold power, as he felt that he was rushing to the rescue of
his only darling child, and he only wished he might have the chance
to spring upon her abductors and rend them limb from limb. Graham’s
heart beat faster as he reflected that, perhaps, in a few moments,
he should be face to face with her who had hovered about his pillow
in all his visions for many a night.</p>

<p>Haldidge sat perfectly cool and possessed. He had formed his
plan, and imparted it to the others; it was to pursue the canoe
noiselessly until they were almost upon it, when the instant they
were near enough to distinguish forms, they would fire upon the
Indians, and dash ahead and capture Ina at all hazards.</p>

<p>This Haldidge, who has been introduced to notice in this chapter,
was a middle-aged man, who ten years before had emigrated from
the settlements along the Hudson, with a company which had formed
the settlement from which he started, and where we saw Haverland
and his wife and sister safely domiciled. He was a married man,
and his cabin happened to be upon the outskirts of the village.
He joined and led the whites in several forays against the savages,
when the latter became too troublesome; and, in this way he at
last became a prominent object for the Indian’s hatred. His residence
became known to them, and one dark, stormy night a half-dozen
made a descent upon it. By the merest chance, Haldidge was in
the village at that time, and thus escaped their malignant revenge.
Being disappointed of their principal prey, they cowardly vented
their hatred upon his defenseless wife and child. When the father
returned, he found them both tomahawked, side by side, and weltering
in each other’s blood. So silently had this onslaught been made
that not a neighbor suspected any thing wrong, and were horror-struck
to find that such deadly peril had been so near their own door.
Haldidge took a fearful vengeance upon the destroyers of his happiness.
He succeeded, a couple of years afterward, in discovering them,
and, before six months were over, shot them all! As may be supposed,
his natural aversion to the race, was intensified by this tragical
occurrence, and had become so distinguished, that his name was
as a terror to the savages in that section. This will account
for his readiness in accompanying Haverland upon his perilous
expedition.</p>

<p>As was said, our friends were rapidly gaining upon the Indian
canoe. At the rate at which they were going, they would be up
to them in the course of a half hour. They were so close to the
shore, as to see the dark line of the shrubbery along the bank,
and several times an overhanging limb brushed over their heads.
Suddenly Haldidge raised his hand again. All ceased rowing and
listened. To their consternation not the slightest sound was heard.
Graham leaned over, and placed his ear almost to the water, but
detected nothing but the soft ripple of the stream against the
roots and dipping branches along the shore.</p>

<p>"Can it be?" he asked, with a painful whisper, as he raised his
head, "that we have been heard?"</p>

<p>"I do not think so," replied Haldidge, apparently in as much
doubt as the rest.</p>

<p>"Then they have run into shore, and departed."</p>

<p>"I fear that has been done."</p>

<p>"But we have kept so close to the shore, would we not have seen
or heard the boat?"</p>

<p>"Provided they had landed alone. They may have run in this very
minute, and may not be more than a few yards off."</p>

<p>"If so, we must hear them yet, and it won’t do to slide down
upon them in the manner we are now going or we shall find ourselves
in the same fix we expected to get them in."</p>

<p>"Very true, and a good suggestion," remarked Haldidge; and as
he did so, he reached up and caught an overhanging limb, and held
the canoe still.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, if you’ve got ears&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Sh&mdash;! Look there!" interrupted Haverland in an excited whisper.</p>

<p>Each turned his head, and saw what appeared to be a common lighted
candle floating upon the surface of the stream. It was a small
point of light, which at intervals glowed with a fuller redness,
and which for the time completely confounded our friends. On it
came as noiselessly as death, gliding forward with such a smooth,
regular motion as to show that it was certainly borne by the current.</p>

<p>"What in the name of&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Haldidge; "that’s the canoe we’re after! It’s the
light of one of their pipes we see. Are your guns ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the two, just loud enough for him to hear.</p>

<p>"Make right toward it, then, and fire the instant you see your
mark. Now!"</p>

<p>At the same instant he released his hold upon the limb, and the
two threw all their force on their oars. The canoe bounded like
a ball directly ahead, and seemed about to cut the other in twain.
A minute after, the shadowy outlines of three forms could be dimly
seen, and the avenging rifles were already raised, when the beacon-light
was suddenly extinguished, and the Indian canoe vanished as if
by magic.</p>

<p>"It’s one of their tricks!" excitedly exclaimed Haldidge. "Dash
ahead! Curse them; they can’t be far off."</p>

<p>The two dropped their rifles, and again seized the oars, and
Haldidge sheered it abruptly up stream, for he fancied they had
turned in that direction. He bent his head forward, expecting
each moment to see the forms of their enemies loom up to view
in the mist, but he was mistaken; no savages greeted his anxious
vision. He guided his boat in every direction&mdash;across the stream&mdash;up
and down, but all to no purpose. They had surely lost their prey
this time. The Indians had undoubtedly heard the pursuers&mdash;had
muffled their own oars, and so proceeded as silently as their
pursuers.</p>

<p>"Hold a minute!" commanded Haldidge.</p>

<p>As they rested, they listened deeply and intently.</p>

<p>"Do you hear any thing?" he asked, leaning breathlessly forward.
"There! listen again."</p>

<p>They could distinguish the ripple of water, growing fainter and
fainter, each minute.</p>

<p>"They are below us again, and now for a trial of speed."</p>

<p>The two needed no more incentives, and for a time the canoe skimmed
over the water with astonishing speed. The moon was now up, and
there were patches in the stream, where the wind had blown away
the fog, and being exposed to the light, were as clear as midday.
Now and then they crossed such spots, sometimes but a few feet
wide, and at others, several rods. At these times the shore on
either hand were perfectly outlined, and they glided over them
with a sort of instinctive terror, as they felt how easily an
enemy might be concealed.</p>

<p>In crossing one of these, broader than usual, a glimpse of the
Indian canoe showed itself, just disappearing upon the opposite
side. They were not more than a hundred yards apart, and they
bounded toward it with great rapidity. The patches of light became
more frequent, and the fog was evidently disappearing. Quite a
breeze had arisen, which was fast sweeping it away. Haldidge kept
close into the eastern shore, feeling sure that their enemies
would land upon this side.</p>

<p>Suddenly the whole mist lifted from the surface of the water
in a volume, and rolled off into the woods. The bright moon was
reflected a long distance, and the pursuers gazed searchingly
about, fully expecting to see their enemies not a dozen rods away.
But they were again doomed to disappointment. Not a ripple disturbed
the waters, except their own canoe. The moon was directly overhead,
so that there was not a shadow cast along the banks, sufficient
to conceal the slightest object. The Indians had evidently landed,
and were far distant in the forest.</p>

<p>"It is no use," remarked Haverland, gloomily, "they are gone,
and we might as well be&mdash;too."</p>

<p>"It is a sore disappointment," added Graham.</p>

<p>"And as much so to me as to either of you," said Haldidge. "I
have an old score against the infernal wretches that will take
many years to wipe out. I hoped to do something toward it to-night,
but have been prevented. There is no use of hoping more at this
time; they have eluded us, that is self-evident, and we must try
some other means. No doubt you are wearied of body as well as
of mind, and don’t fancy particularly this remaining out in the
river here, a shot for any one who might possess the will; so
let us go into shore, have a rest, and talk over things." Dispiritedly
and gloomily the two ran the canoe to the bank and landed.</p>
