<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The following morning Sir Nigel did not appear at the breakfast table.
He breakfasted in his own room, and it became known throughout the
household that he had suddenly decided to go away, and his man was
packing for the journey. What the journey or the reason for its being
taken happened to be were things not explained to anyone but Lady
Anstruthers, at the door of whose dressing room he appeared without
warning, just as she was leaving it.
</p><p>Rosalie started when she found herself confronting him. His eyes looked
hot and hollow with feverish sleeplessness.
</p><p>“You look ill,” she exclaimed involuntarily. “You look as if you had not
slept.”
</p><p>“Thank you. You always encourage a man. I am not in the habit of
sleeping much,” he answered. “I am going away for my health. It is as
well you should know. I am going to look up old Broadmorlands. I want
to know exactly where he is, in case it becomes necessary for me to see
him. I also require some trifling data connected with Ffolliott. If
your father is coming, it will be as well to be able to lay my hands on
things. You can explain to Betty. Good-morning.” He waited for no reply,
but wheeled about and left her.
</p><p>Betty herself wore a changed face when she came down. A cloud had passed
over her blooming, as clouds pass over a morning sky and dim it. Rosalie
asked herself if she had not noticed something like this before. She
began to think she had. Yes, she was sure that at intervals there had
been moments when she had glanced at the brilliant face with an uneasy
and yet half-unrealising sense of looking at a glowing light temporarily
waning. The feeling had been unrealisable, because it was not to be
explained. Betty was never ill, she was never low-spirited, she
was never out of humour or afraid of things--that was why it was so
wonderful to live with her. But--yes, it was true--there had been
days when the strong, fine light of her had waned. Lady Anstruthers'
comprehension of it arose now from her memory of the look she had seen
the night before in the eyes which suddenly had gazed straight before
her, as into an unknown place.
</p><p>“Yes, I know--I know--I know!” And the tone in the girl's voice had been
one Rosy had not heard before.
</p><p>Slight wonder--if you KNEW--at any outward change which showed itself,
though in your own most desperate despite. It would be so even with
Betty, who, in her sister's eyes, was unlike any other creature. But
perhaps it would be better to make no comment. To make comment would be
almost like asking the question she had been forbidden to ask.
</p><p>While the servants were in the room during breakfast they talked
of common things, resorting even to the weather and the news of the
village. Afterwards they passed into the morning room together, and
Betty put her arm around Rosalie and kissed her.
</p><p>“Nigel has suddenly gone away, I hear,” she said. “Do you know where he
has gone?”
</p><p>“He came to my dressing-room to tell me.” Betty felt the whole slim body
stiffen itself with a determination to seem calm. “He said he was going
to find out where the old Duke of Broadmorlands was staying at present.”
</p><p>“There is some forethought in that,” was Betty's answer. “He is not on
such terms with the Duke that he can expect to be received as a casual
visitor. It will require apt contrivance to arrange an interview. I
wonder if he will be able to accomplish it?”
</p><p>“Yes, he will,” said Lady Anstruthers. “I think he can always contrive
things like that.” She hesitated a moment, and then added: “He said also
that he wished to find out certain things about Mr. Ffolliott--'trifling
data,' he called it--that he might be able to lay his hands on things if
father came. He told me to explain to you.”
</p><p>“That was intended for a taunt--but it's a warning,” Betty said,
thinking the thing over. “We are rather like ladies left alone to
defend a besieged castle. He wished us to feel that.” She tightened her
enclosing arm. “But we stand together--together. We shall not fail each
other. We can face siege until father comes.”
</p><p>“You wrote to him last night?”
</p><p>“A long letter, which I wish him to receive before he sails. He might
decide to act upon it before leaving New York, to advise with some legal
authority he knows and trusts, to prepare our mother in some way--to do
some wise thing we cannot foresee the value of. He has known the outline
of the story, but not exact details--particularly recent ones. I have
held back nothing it was necessary he should know. I am going out to
post the letter myself. I shall send a cable asking him to prepare to
come to us after he has reflected on what I have written.”
</p><p>Rosalie was very quiet, but when, having left the room to prepare to go
to the village, Betty came back to say a last word, her sister came to
her and laid her hand on her arm.
</p><p>“I have been so weak and trodden upon for years that it would not be
natural for you to quite trust me,” she said. “But I won't fail you,
Betty--I won't.”
</p><p>The winter was drawing in, the last autumn days were short and often
grey and dreary; the wind had swept the leaves from the trees and
scattered them over park lands and lanes, where they lay a mellow-hued,
rustling carpet, shifting with each chill breeze that blew. The berried
briony garlands clung to the bared hedges, and here and there flared
scarlet, still holding their red defiantly until hard frosts should come
to shrivel and blacken them. The rare hours of sunshine were amber hours
instead of golden.
</p><p>As she passed through the park gate Betty was thinking of the first
morning on which she had walked down the village street between the
irregular rows of red-tiled cottages with the ragged little enclosing
gardens. Then the air and sunshine had been of the just awakening
spring, now the sky was brightly cold, and through the small-paned
windows she caught glimpses of fireglow. A bent old man walking very
slowly, leaning upon two sticks, had a red-brown woollen muffler wrapped
round his neck. Seeing her, he stopped and shuffled the two sticks
into one hand that he might leave the other free to touch his wrinkled
forehead stiffly, his face stretching into a slow smile as she stopped
to speak to him.
</p><p>“Good-morning, Marlow,” he said. “How is the rheumatism to-day?”
</p><p>He was a deaf old man, whose conversation was carried on principally by
guesswork, and it was easy for him to gather that when her ladyship's
handsome young sister had given him greeting she had not forgotten to
inquire respecting the “rheumatics,” which formed the greater part of
existence.
</p><p>“Mornin', miss--mornin',” he answered in the high, cracked voice
of rural ancientry. “Winter be nigh, an' they damp days be full of
rheumatiz. 'T'int easy to get about on my old legs, but I be main
thankful for they warm things you sent, miss. This 'ere,” fumbling at
his red-brown muffler proudly, “'tis a comfort on windy days, so
'tis, and warmth be a good thing to a man when he be goin' down hill in
years.”
</p><p>“All of you who are not able to earn your own fires shall be warm this
winter,” her ladyship's handsome sister said, speaking closer to his
ear. “You shall all be warm. Don't be afraid of the cold days coming.”
</p><p>He shuffled his sticks and touched his forehead again, looking up at her
admiringly and chuckling.
</p><p>“'T'will be a new tale for Stornham village,” he cackled. “'T'will be
a new tale. Thank ye, miss. Thank ye.”
</p><p>As she nodded smilingly and passed on, she heard him cackling still
under his breath as he hobbled on his slow way, comforted and elate. How
almost shamefully easy it was; a few loads of coal and faggots here and
there, a few blankets and warm garments whose cost counted for so little
when one's hands were full, could change a gruesome village winter into
a season during which labour-stiffened and broken old things, closing
their cottage doors, could draw their chairs round the hearth and
hover luxuriously over the red glow, which in its comforting fashion of
seeming to have understanding of the dull dreams in old eyes, was more
to be loved than any human friend.
</p><p>But she had not needed her passing speech with Marlow to stimulate
realisation of how much she had learned to care for the mere living
among these people, to whom she seemed to have begun to belong, and
whose comfortably lighting faces when they met her showed that they knew
her to be one who might be turned to in any hour of trouble or dismay.
The centuries which had trained them to depend upon their “betters” had
taught the slowest of them to judge with keen sight those who were to be
trusted, not alone as power and wealth holders, but as creatures humanly
upright and merciful with their kind.
</p><p>“Workin' folk allus knows gentry,” old Doby had once shrilled to her.
“Gentry's gentry, an' us knows 'em wheresoever they be. Better'n they
know theirselves. So us do!”
</p><p>Yes, they knew. And though they accepted many things as being merely
their natural rights, they gave an unsentimental affection and
appreciation in return. The patriarchal note in the life was lovable to
her. Each creature she passed was a sort of friend who seemed almost of
her own blood. It had come to that. This particular existence was
more satisfying to her than any other, more heart-filling and warmly
complete.
</p><p>“Though I am only an impostor,” she thought; “I was born in Fifth
Avenue; yet since I have known this I shall be quite happy in no other
place than an English village, with a Norman church tower looking down
upon it and rows of little gardens with spears of white and blue lupins
and Canterbury bells standing guard before cottage doors.”
</p><p>And Rosalie--on the evening of that first strange day when she had
come upon her piteous figure among the heather under the trees near
the lake--Rosalie had held her arm with a hot little hand and had said
feverishly:
</p><p>“If I could hear the roar of Broadway again! Do the stages rattle as
they used to, Betty? I can't help hoping that they do.”
</p><p>She carried her letter to the post and stopped to talk a few minutes
with the postmaster, who transacted his official business in a small
shop where sides of bacon and hams hung suspended from the ceiling,
while groceries, flannels, dress prints, and glass bottles of sweet
stuff filled the shelves. “Mr. Tewson's” was the central point of
Stornham in a commercial sense. The establishment had also certain
social qualifications.
</p><p>Mr. Tewson knew the secrets of all hearts within the village radius,
also the secrets of all constitutions. He knew by some occult means who
had been “taken bad,” or who had “taken a turn,” and was aware at once
when anyone was “sinkin' fast.” With such differences of opinion as
occasionally arose between the vicar and his churchwardens he was
immediately familiar. The history of the fever among the hop pickers at
Dunstan village he had been able to relate in detail from the moment of
its outbreak. It was he who had first dramatically revealed the truth of
the action Miss Vanderpoel had taken in the matter, which revelation had
aroused such enthusiasm as had filled The Clock Inn to overflowing and
given an impetus to the sale of beer. Tread, it was said, had even
made a speech which he had ended with vague but excellent intentions by
proposing the joint healths of her ladyship's sister and the “President
of America.” Mr. Tewson was always glad to see Miss Vanderpoel cross his
threshold. This was not alone because she represented the custom of the
Court, which since her arrival had meant large regular orders and large
bills promptly paid, but that she brought with her an exotic atmosphere
of interest and excitement.
</p><p>He had mentioned to friends that somehow a talk with her made him feel
“set up for the day.” Betty was not at all sure that he did not prepare
and hoard up choice remarks or bits of information as openings to
conversation.
</p><p>This morning he had thrilling news for her and began with it at once.
</p><p>“Dr. Fenwick at Stornham is very low, miss,” he said. “He's very low,
you'll be sorry to hear. The worry about the fever upset him terrible
and his bronchitis took him bad. He's an old man, you know.”
</p><p>Miss Vanderpoel was very sorry to hear it. It was quite in the natural
order of things that she should ask other questions about Dunstan
village and the Mount, and she asked several.
</p><p>The fever was dying out and pale convalescents were sometimes seen in
the village or strolling about the park. His lordship was taking care
of the people and doing his best for them until they should be strong
enough to return to their homes.
</p><p>“But he's very strict about making it plain that it's you, miss, they
have to thank for what he does.”
</p><p>“That is not quite just,” said Miss Vanderpoel. “He and Mr. Penzance
fought on the field. I only supplied some of the ammunition.”
</p><p>“The county doesn't think of him as it did even a year ago, miss,” said
Tewson rather smugly. “He was very ill thought of then among the gentry.
It's wonderful the change that's come about. If he should fall ill
there'll be a deal of sympathy.”
</p><p>“I hope there is no question of his falling ill,” said Miss Vanderpoel.
</p><p>Mr. Tewson lowered his voice confidentially. This was really his most
valuable item of news.
</p><p>“Well, miss,” he admitted, “I have heard that he's been looking very bad
for a good bit, and it was told me quite private, because the doctors
and the vicar don't want the people to be upset by hearing it--that for
a week he's not been well enough to make his rounds.”
</p><p>“Oh!” The exclamation was a faint one, but it was an exclamation.
“I hope that means nothing really serious,” Miss Vanderpoel added.
“Everyone will hope so.”
</p><p>“Yes, miss,” said Mr. Tewson, deftly twisting the string round the
package he was tying up for her. “A sad reward it would be if he lost
his life after doing all he has done. A sad reward! But there'd be a
good deal of sympathy.”
</p><p>The small package contained trifles of sewing and knitting materials she
was going to take to Mrs. Welden, and she held out her hand for it. She
knew she did not smile quite naturally as she said her good-morning
to Tewson. She went out into the pale amber sunshine and stood a few
moments, glad to find herself bathed in it again. She suddenly needed
air and light. “A sad reward!” Sometimes people were not rewarded. Brave
men were shot dead on the battlefield when they were doing brave things;
brave physicians and nurses died of the plagues they faithfully wrestled
with. Here were dread and pain confronting her--Betty Vanderpoel--and
while almost everyone else seemed to have faced them, she was wholly
unused to their appalling clutch. What a life hers had been--that in
looking back over it she should realise that she had never been touched
by anything like this before! There came back to her the look of almost
awed wonder in G. Selden's honest eyes when he said: “What it must be to
be you--just YOU!” He had been thinking only of the millions and of
the freedom from all everyday anxieties the millions gave. She smiled
faintly as the thought crossed her brain. The millions! The rolling
up of them year by year, because millions were breeders! The newspaper
stories of them--the wonder at and belief in their power! It was all
going on just as before, and yet here stood a Vanderpoel in an English
village street, of no more worth as far as power to aid herself went
than Joe Buttle's girl with the thick waist and round red cheeks. Jenny
Buttle would have believed that her ladyship's rich American sister
could do anything she chose, open any door, command any presence,
sweep aside any obstacle with a wave of her hand. But of the two, Jenny
Buttle's path would have laid straighter before her. If she had had “a
young man” who had fallen ill she would have been free if his mother had
cherished no objection to their “walking out”--to spend all her spare
hours in his cottage, making gruel and poultices, crying until her
nose and eyes were red, and pouring forth her hopes and fears to any
neighbour who came in or out or hung over the dividing garden hedge. If
the patient died, the deeper her mourning and the louder her sobs at his
funeral the more respectable and deserving of sympathy and admiration
would Jenny Buttle have been counted. Her ladyship's rich American
sister had no “young man”; she had not at any time been asked to “walk
out.” Even in the dark days of the fever, each of which had carried
thought and action of hers to the scene of trouble, there had reigned
unbroken silence, except for the vicar's notes of warm and appreciative
gratitude.
</p><p>“You are very obstinate, Fergus,” Mr. Penzance had said.
</p><p>And Mount Dunstan had shaken his head fiercely and answered:
</p><p>“Don't speak to me about it. Only obstinacy will save me from behaving
like--other blackguards.”
</p><p>Mr. Penzance, carefully polishing his eyeglasses as he watched him, was
not sparing in his comment.
</p><p>“That is pure folly,” he said, “pure bull-necked, stubborn folly,
charging with its head down. Before it has done with you it will have
made you suffer quite enough.”
</p><p>“Be sure of that,” Mount Dunstan had said, setting his teeth, as he
sat in his chair clasping his hands behind his head and glowering into
space.
</p><p>Mr. Penzance quietly, speculatively, looked him over, and reflected
aloud--or, so it sounded.
</p><p>“It is a big-boned and big-muscled characteristic, but there are things
which are stronger. Some one minute will arrive--just one minute--which
will be stronger. One of those moments when the mysteries of the
universe are at work.”
</p><p>“Don't speak to me like that, I tell you!” Mount Dunstan broke out
passionately. And he sprang up and marched out of the room like an angry
man.
</p><p>Miss Vanderpoel did not go to Mrs. Welden's cottage at once, but walked
past its door down the lane, where there were no more cottages, but only
hedges and fields on either side of her. “Not well enough to make his
rounds” might mean much or little. It might mean a temporary breakdown
from overfatigue or a sickening for deadly illness. She looked at a
group of cropping sheep in a field and at a flock of rooks which had
just alighted near it with cawing and flapping of wings. She kept her
eyes on them merely to steady herself. The thoughts she had brought out
with her had grown heavier and were horribly difficult to control. One
must not allow one's self to believe the worst will come--one must not
allow it.
</p><p>She always held this rule before herself, and now she was not holding
it steadily. There was nothing to do. She could write a mere note of
inquiry to Mr. Penzance, but that was all. She could only walk up and
down the lanes and think--whether he lay dying or not. She could do
nothing, even if a day came when she knew that a pit had been dug in the
clay and he had been lowered into it with creaking ropes, and the clods
shovelled back upon him where he lay still--never having told her that
he was glad that her being had turned to him and her heart cried aloud
his name. She recalled with curious distinctness the effect of the
steady toll of the church bell--the “passing bell.”
</p><p>She could hear it as she had heard it the first time it fell upon
her ear, and she had inquired what it meant. Why did they call it the
“passing bell”? All had passed before it began to toll--all had passed.
If it tolled at Dunstan and the pit was dug in the churchyard before
her father came, would he see, the moment they met, that something had
befallen her--that the Betty he had known was changed--gone? Yes, he
would see. Affection such as his always saw. Then he would sit alone
with her in some quiet room and talk to her, and she would tell him the
strange thing that had happened. He would understand--perhaps better
than she.
</p><p>She stopped abruptly in her walk and stood still. The hand holding her
package was quite cold. This was what one must not allow one's self. But
how the thoughts had raced through her brain! She turned and hastened
her steps towards Mrs. Welden's cottage.
</p><p>In Mrs. Welden's tiny back yard there stood a “coal lodge” suited to the
size of the domicile and already stacked with a full winter's supply
of coal. Therefore the well-polished and cleanly little grate in the
living-room was bright with fire.
</p><p>Old Doby, who had tottered round the corner to pay his fellow gossip a
visit, was sitting by it, and old Mrs. Welden, clean as to cap and apron
and small purple shoulder shawl, had evidently been allaying his natural
anxiety as to the conduct of foreign sovereigns by reading in a loud
voice the “print” under the pictures in an illustrated paper.
</p><p>This occupation had, however, been interrupted a few moments before Miss
Vanderpoel's arrival. Mrs. Bester, the neighbour in the next
cottage, had stepped in with her youngest on her hip and was talking
breathlessly. She paused to drop her curtsy as Betty entered, and old
Doby stood up and made his salute with a trembling hand,
</p><p>“She'll know,” he said. “Gentry knows the ins an' outs of gentry fust.
She'll know the rights.”
</p><p>“What has happened?”
</p><p>Mrs. Bester unexpectedly burst into tears. There was an element in
the female villagers' temperament which Betty had found was frequently
unexpected in its breaking forth.
</p><p>“He's down, miss,” she said. “He's down with it crool bad. There'll be
no savin' of him--none.”
</p><p>Betty laid her package of sewing cotton and knitting wool quietly on the
blue and white checked tablecloth.
</p><p>“Who--is he?” she asked.
</p><p>“His lordship--and him just saved all Dunstan parish from death--to go
like this!”
</p><p>In Stornham village and in all others of the neighbourhood the feminine
attitude towards Mount Dunstan had been one of strongly emotional
admiration. The thwarted female longing for romance--the desire for
drama and a hero had been fed by him. A fine, big young man, one that
had been “spoke ill of” and regarded as an outcast, had suddenly turned
the tables on fortune and made himself the central figure of the county,
the talk of gentry in their grand houses, of cottage women on their
doorsteps, and labourers stopping to speak to each other by the
roadside. Magic stories had been told of him, beflowered with dramatic
detail. No incident could have been related to his credit which would
not have been believed and improved upon. Shut up in his village working
among his people and unseen by outsiders, he had become a popular idol.
Any scrap of news of him--any rumour, true or untrue, was seized upon
and excitedly spread abroad. Therefore Mrs. Bester wept as she talked,
and, if the truth must be told, enjoyed the situation. She was the first
to tell the story to her ladyship's sister herself, as well as to Mrs.
Welden and old Doby.
</p><p>“It's Tom as brought it in,” she said. “He's my brother, miss, an' he's
one of the ringers. He heard it from Jem Wesgate, an' he heard it at
Toomy's farm. They've been keepin' it hid at the Mount because the
people that's ill hangs on his lordship so that the doctors daren't let
them know the truth. They've been told he had to go to London an' may
come back any day. What Tom was sayin', miss, was that we'd all know
when it was over, for we'd hear the church bell toll here same as it'd
toll at Dunstan, because they ringers have talked it over an' they're
goin' to talk it over to-day with the other parishes--Yangford an'
Meltham an' Dunholm an' them. Tom says Stornham ringers met just now at
The Clock an' said that for a man that's stood by labouring folk like he
has, toll they will, an' so ought the other parishes, same as if he was
royalty, for he's made himself nearer. They'll toll the minute they hear
it, miss. Lord help us!” with a fresh outburst of crying. “It don't seem
like it's fair as it should be. When we hear the bell toll, miss----”
</p><p>“Don't!” said her ladyship's handsome sister suddenly. “Please don't say
it again.”
</p><p>She sat down by the table, and resting her elbows on the blue and white
checked cloth, covered her face with her hands. She did not speak at
all. In this tiny room, with these two old souls who loved her, she need
not explain. She sat quite still, and Mrs. Welden after looking at her
for a few seconds was prompted by some sublimely simple intuition, and
gently sidled Mrs. Bester and her youngest into the little kitchen,
where the copper was.
</p><p>“Her helpin' him like she did, makes it come near,” she whispered.
“Dessay it seems as if he was a'most like a relation.”
</p><p>Old Doby sat and looked at his goddess. In his slowly moving old brain
stirred far-off memories like long-dead things striving to come to life.
He did not know what they were, but they wakened his dim eyes to a new
seeing of the slim young shape leaning a little forward, the soft cloud
of hair, the fair beauty of the cheek. He had not seen anything like
it in his youth, but--it was Youth itself, and so was that which the
ringers were so soon to toll for; and for some remote and unformed
reason, to his scores of years they were pitiful and should be cheered.
He bent forward himself and put out his ancient, veined and knotted,
gnarled and trembling hand, to timorously touch the arm of her he
worshipped and adored.
</p><p>“God bless ye!” he said, his high, cracked voice even more shrill and
thin than usual. “God bless ye!” And as she let her hands slip down,
and, turning, gently looked at him, he nodded to her speakingly, because
out of the dimness of his being, some part of Nature's working had
strangely answered and understood.
