<p>I never breathed a word about the night's doings, nor for divers
reasons did Ringan; but the story got about, and the young fools
were the laughing-stock of the place. But there was a good deal
of wrath, too, that a trader should have presumed so far, and
I felt that things were gathering to a crisis with me. Unless
I was to suffer endlessly these petty vexations, I must find a
bold stroke to end them. It annoyed me that when so many grave
issues were in the balance I should have these troubles, as if
a man should be devoured by midges when waiting on a desperate
combat.</p>

<p>The crisis came sooner than I looked for. There was to be a great
horse-racing at Middle Plantation the next Monday, which I had
half a mind to attend, for, though I cared nothing for the sport,
it would give me a chance of seeing some of our fellows from the
York River. One morning I met Elspeth in the street of James Town,
and she cried laughingly that she looked to see me at the races.
After that I had no choice but go; so on the Monday morning I
dressed myself with care, mounted my best horse, and rode to the
gathering.</p>

<p>'Twas a pretty sight to see the spacious green meadow, now a
little yellowing with the summer heat, set in the girdle of dark
and leafy forest. I counted over forty chariots which had brought
the rank of the countryside, each with its liveried servant and
its complement of outriders. The fringe of the course blazed with
ladies' finery, and a tent had been set up with a wide awning
from which the fashionables could watch the sport. On the edge
of the woods a multitude of horses were picketed, and there were
booths that sold food and drink, merry-go-rounds and fiddlers,
and an immense concourse of every condition of folk, black slaves
and water-side Indians, squatters from the woods, farmers from
all the valleys, and the scum and ruck of the plantations. I found
some of my friends, and settled my business with them, but my
eyes were always straying to the green awning where I knew that
Elspeth sat.</p>

<p>I am no judge of racing, but I love the aspect of sleek, slim
horses, and I could applaud a skill in which I had no share. I
can keep my seat on most four-legged beasts, but my horsemanship
is a clumsy, rough-and-ready affair, very different from the effortless
grace of your true cavalier. Mr. Grey's prowess, especially, filled
me with awe. He would leap an ugly fence without moving an inch
in his saddle, and both in skill and the quality of his mounts
he was an easy victor. The sight of such accomplishments depressed
my pride, and I do not think I would have ventured near the tent
had it not been for the Governor.</p>

<p>He saw me on the fringe of the crowd, and called me to him. "What
bashfulness has taken you to-day, sir?" he cried, "That is not
like your usual. There are twenty pretty dames here who pine for
a word from you."</p>

<p>I saw his purpose well enough. He loved to make mischief, and
knew that the sight of me among the Virginian gentry would infuriate
my unfriends. But I took him at his word and elbowed my way into
the enclosure.</p>

<p>Then I wished to Heaven I had stayed at home. I got insolent
glances from the youths, and the cold shoulder from the ladies.
Elspeth smiled when she saw me, but turned the next second to
gossip with her little court. She was a devout lover of horses,
and had eyes for nothing but the racing. Her cheeks were flushed,
and it was pretty to watch her excitement; how she hung breathless
on the movements of the field, and clapped her hands at a brave
finish. Pretty, indeed, but exasperating to one who had no part
in that pleasant company.</p>

<p>I stood gloomily by the rail at the edge of the ladies' awning,
acutely conscious of my loneliness. Presently Mr. Grey, whose
racing was over, came to us, and had a favour pinned in his coat
by Elspeth's fingers. He was evidently high in her good graces,
for he sat down by her and talked gleefully. I could not but admire
his handsome eager face, and admit with a bitter grudge that you
would look long to find a comelier pair.</p>

<p>All this did not soothe my temper, and after an hour of it I
was in desperate ill-humour with the world. I had just reached
the conclusion that I had had as much as I wanted, when I heard
Elspeth's voice calling me.</p>

<p>"Come hither, Mr. Garvald," she said. "We have a dispute which
a third must settle. I favour the cherry, and Mr. Grey fancies
the blue; but I maintain that blue crowds cherry unfairly at the
corners. Use your eyes, sir, at the next turning."</p>

<p>I used my eyes, which are very sharp, and had no doubt of it.</p>

<p>"That is a matter for the Master of the Course," said Mr. Grey.
"Will you uphold your view before him, sir?"</p>

<p>I said that I knew too little of the sport to be of much weight
as a witness. To this he said nothing, but offered to wager with
me on the result of the race, which was now all but ending. "Or
no," said he, "I should not ask you that. A trader is careful
of his guineas."</p>

<p>Elspeth did not hear, being intent on other things, and I merely
shrugged my shoulders, though my fingers itched for the gentleman's
ears.</p>

<p>In a little the racing ceased, and the ladies made ready to leave.
Doctor Blair appeared, protesting that the place was not for his
cloth, and gave Elspeth his arm to escort her to his coach. She
cried a merry good-day to us, and reminded Mr. Grey that he had
promised to sup with them on the morrow. When she had gone I spied
a lace scarf which she had forgotten, and picked it up to restore
it.</p>

<p>This did not please the other. He snatched it from me, and when
I proposed to follow, tripped me deftly, and sent me sprawling
among the stools. As I picked myself up, I saw him running to
overtake the Blairs.</p>

<p>This time there was no discreet girl to turn the edge of my fury.
All the gibes and annoyances of the past months rushed into my
mind, and set my head throbbing. I was angry, but very cool with
it all, for I saw that the matter had now gone too far for tolerance.
Unless I were to be the butt of Virginia, I must assert my manhood.</p>

<p>I nicked the dust from my coat, and walked quietly to where Mr.
Grey was standing amid a knot of his friends, who talked of the
races and their losses and gains. He saw me coming, and said something
which made them form a staring alley, down which I strolled. He
kept regarding me with bright, watchful eyes.</p>

<p>"I have been very patient, sir," I said, "but there is a limit
to what a man may endure from a mannerless fool." And I gave him
a hearty slap on the face.</p>

<p>Instantly there was a dead silence, in which the sound seemed
to linger intolerably. He had grown very white, and his eyes were
wicked.</p>

<p>"I am obliged to you, sir," he said. "You are some kind of ragged
gentleman, so no doubt you will give me satisfaction."</p>

<p>"When and where you please," I said sedately.</p>

<p>"Will you name your friend now?" he asked. "These matters demand
quick settlement."</p>

<p>To whom was I to turn? I knew nobody of the better class who
would act for me. For a moment I thought of Colonel Beverley,
but his age and dignity were too great to bring him into this
squabble of youth. Then a notion struck me.</p>

<p>"If you will send your friend to my man, John Faulkner, he will
make all arrangements. He is to be found any day in my shop."</p>

<p>With this defiance, I walked nonchalantly out of the dumbfoundered
group, found my horse, and rode homewards.</p>

<p>My coolness did not last many minutes, and long ere I had reached
James Town I was a prey to dark forebodings. Here was I, a peaceful
trader, who desired nothing more than to live in amity with all
men, involved in a bloody strife. I had sought it, and yet it
had been none of my seeking. I had graver thoughts to occupy my
mind than the punctilios of idle youth, and yet I did not see
how the thing could have been shunned. It was my hard fate to
come athwart an obstacle which could not be circumvented, but
must be broken. No friend could help me in the business, not Ringan,
nor the Governor, nor Colonel Beverley. It was my own affair,
which I must go through with alone. I felt as solitary as a pelican.</p>

<p>Remember, I was not fighting for any whimsy about honour, nor
even for the love of Elspeth. I had openly provoked Grey because
the hostility of the young gentry had become an intolerable nuisance
in my daily life. So, with such pedestrian reasons in my mind,
I could have none of the heady enthusiasm of passion. I wanted
him and his kind cleared out of my way, like a noisome insect,
but I had no flaming hatred of him to give me heart.</p>

<p>The consequence was that I became a prey to dismal fear. That
bravery which knows no ebb was never mine. Indeed, I am by nature
timorous, for my fancy is quick, and I see with horrid clearness
the incidents of a peril. Only a shamefaced conscience holds me
true, so that, though I have often done temerarious deeds, it
has always been because I feared shame more than the risk, and
my knees have ever been knocking together and my lips dry with
fright. I tried to think soberly over the future, but could get
no conclusion save that I would not do murder. My conscience was
pretty bad about the whole business. I was engaged in the kind
of silly conflict which I had been bred to abhor; I had none of
the common gentleman's notions about honour; and I knew that if
by any miracle I slew Grey I should be guilty in my own eyes of
murder. I would not risk the guilt. If God had determined that
I should perish before my time, then perish I must.</p>

<p>This despair brought me a miserable kind of comfort. When I reached
home I went straight to Faulkner.</p>

<p>"I have quarrelled to-day with a gentleman, John, and have promised
him satisfaction. You must act for me in the affair. Some one
will come to see you this evening, and the meeting had better
be at dawn to-morrow."</p>

<p>He opened his eyes very wide. "Who is it, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Mr. Charles Grey of Grey's Hundred," I replied.</p>

<p>This made him whistle low, "He's a fine swordsman," he said.
"I never heard there was any better in the dominion. You'll be
to fight with swords?"</p>

<p>I thought hard for a minute. I was the challenged, and so had
the choice of weapons. "No," said I, "you are to appoint pistols,
for it is my right."</p>

<p>At this Faulkner slowly grinned. "It's a new weapon for these
affairs. What if they'll not accept? But it's no business of mine,
and I'll remember your wishes." And the strange fellow turned
again to his accounts.</p>

<p>I spent the evening looking over my papers and making various
appointments in case I did not survive the morrow. Happily the
work I had undertaken for Lawrence was all but finished, and of
my ordinary business Faulkner knew as much as myself. I wrote
a letter to Uncle Andrew, telling him frankly the situation, that
he might know how little choice I had. It was a cold-blooded job
making these dispositions, and I hope never to have the like to
do again. Presently I heard voices outside, and Faulkner came
to the door with Mr. George Mason, the younger, of Thornby, who
passed for the chief buck in Virginia. He gave me a cold bow.</p>

<p>"I have settled everything with this gentleman, but I would beg
of you, sir, to reconsider your choice of arms. My friend will
doubtless be ready enough to humour you, but you have picked a
barbarous weapon for Christian use."</p>

<p>"It's my only means of defence," I said.</p>

<p>"Then you stick to your decision?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," said I, and, with a shrug of the shoulders, he departed.</p>

<p>I did not attempt to sleep. Faulkner told me that we were to
meet the next morning half an hour after sunrise at a place in
the forest a mile distant. Each man was to fire one shot, but
two pistols were allowed in case of a misfire. All that night
by the light of a lamp I got my weapons ready. I summoned to my
recollection all the knowledge I had acquired, and made sure that
nothing should be lacking so far as human skill would go. I had
another pistol besides the one I called "Elspeth," also made in
Glasgow, but a thought longer in the barrel. For this occasion
I neglected cartouches, and loaded in the old way. I tested my
bullets time and again, and weighed out the powder as if it had
been gold dust. It was short range, so I made my charges small.
I tried my old device of wrapping each bullet in soft wool smeared
with beeswax. All this passed the midnight hours, and then I lay
down for a little rest, but not for sleep.</p>

<p>I was glad when Faulkner summoned me half an hour before sunrise.
I remember that I bathed head and shoulders in cold water, and
very carefully dressed myself in my best clothes. My pistols lay
in the box which Faulkner carried. I drank a glass of wine, and
as we left I took a long look at the place I had created, and
the river now lit with the first shafts of morning. I wondered
incuriously if I should ever see it again.</p>

<p>My tremors had all gone by now, and I was in a mood of cold,
thoughtless despair. The earth had never looked so bright as we
rode through the green aisles all filled with the happy song of
birds. Often on such a morning I had started on a journey, with
my heart grateful for the goodness of the world. Could I but keep
the road, I should come in time to the swampy bank of the York;
and then would follow the chestnut forest: and the wide marshes
towards the Rappahannock; and everywhere I should meet friendly
human faces, and then at night I should eat a hunter's meal below
the stars. But that was all past, and I was moving towards death
in a foolish strife in which I had no heart, and where I could
find no honour, I think I laughed aloud at my exceeding folly.</p>

<p>We turned from the path into an alley which led to an open space
on the edge of a derelict clearing. There, to my surprise, I found
a considerable company assembled. Grey was there with his second,
and a dozen or more of his companions stood back in the shadow
of the trees. The young blood of Virginia had come out to see
the trader punished.</p>

<p>During the few minutes while the seconds were busy pacing the
course and arranging for the signal, I had no cognizance of the
world around me. I stood with abstracted eyes watching a grey
squirrel in one of the branches, and trying to recall a line I
had forgotten in a song. There seemed to be two Andrew Garvalds
that morning, one filled with an immense careless peace, and the
other a weak creature who had lived so long ago as to be forgotten.
I started when Faulkner came to place me, and followed him without
a word. But as I stood up and saw Grey twenty paces off, turning
up his wristbands and tossing his coat to a friend, I realized
the business I had come on. A great flood of light was rolling
down the forest aisles, but it was so clear and pure that it did
not dazzle. I remember thinking in that moment how intolerable
had become the singing of birds.</p>

<p>I deadened my heart to memories, took my courage in both hands,
and forced myself to the ordeal. For it is an ordeal to face powder
if you have not a dreg of passion in you, and are resolved to
make no return. I am left-handed, and so, in fronting my opponent,
I exposed my heart. If Grey were the marksman I thought him, now
was his chance for revenge.</p>

<p>My wits were calm now, and my senses very clear. I heard a man
say slowly that he would count three and then drop his kerchief,
and at the dropping we should fire. Our eyes were on him as he
lifted his hand and slowly began,&mdash;"One&mdash;two&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then I looked away, for the signal mattered nothing to me. I
suddenly caught Grey's eyes, and something whistled past my ear,
cutting the lobe and shearing off a lock of hair. I did not heed
it. What filled my mind was the sight of my enemy, very white
and drawn in the face, holding a smoking pistol and staring at
me.</p>

<p>I emptied my pistol among the tree-tops.</p>

<p>No one moved. Grey continued to stare, leaning a little forward,
with his lips working.</p>

<p>Then I took from Faulkner my second pistol. My voice came out
of my throat, funnily cracked as if from long disuse.</p>

<p>"Mr. Grey," I cried, "I would not have you think that I cannot
shoot."</p>

<p>Forty yards from me on the edge of the covert a turkey stood,
with its foolish, inquisitive head. The sound of the shots had
brought the bird out to see what was going on. It stood motionless,
blinking its eyes, the very mark I desired.</p>

<p>I pointed to it with my right hand, flung forward my pistol,
and fired. It rolled over as dead as stone, and Faulkner walked
to pick it up. He put back my pistols in the box, and we turned
to seek the horses....</p>

<p>Then Grey came up to me. His mouth was hard-set, but the lines
were not of pride. I saw that he too had been desperately afraid,
and I rejoiced that others beside me had been at breaking-point.</p>

<p>"Our quarrel is at an end, sir?" he said, and his voice was hesitating.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said. "It was never my seeking, though I gave the
offence."</p>

<p>"I have behaved like a cub, sir," and he spoke loud, so that
all could hear. "You have taught me a lesson in gentility. Will
you give me your hand?"</p>

<p>I could find no words, and dumbly held out my right hand.</p>

<p>"Nay, sir," he said, "the other, the one that held the trigger.
I count it a privilege to hold the hand of a brave man."</p>

<p>I had been tried too hard, and was all but proving my bravery
by weeping like a bairn.</p>
