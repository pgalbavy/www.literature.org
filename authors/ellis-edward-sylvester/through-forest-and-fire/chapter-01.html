<p>Nicholas Ribsam was a comical fellow from his earliest babyhood,
and had an original way of doing almost everything he undertook.</p>

<p>When he became big enough to sit on the porch of the humble little
home, where he was born, and stare with his great round eyes at
the world as it went by, that world, whether on horseback, in
carriage, or on foot, was sure to smile at the funny-looking baby.</p>

<p>Nick, although born in western Pennsylvania, was as thoroughly
Dutch as if he had first opened his eyes on the banks of the Zuyder
Zee, in the lowlands of Holland. His parents had come from that
part of the world which has produced so many fine scholars and
done so much for science and literature. They talked the language
of the Fatherland, although they occasionally ventured on very
broken English for the instruction of the boy and girl which heaven
had given them.</p>

<p>When Nick was a year old, he seemed as broad as he was long,
and his round, red cheeks, big, honest eyes, and scanty hair,
which stood out in every direction, always brought a smile to
whomsoever looked at him.</p>

<p>"That's the Dutchest baby I ever saw!" exclaimed a young man,
who, as he threw back his head and laughed, expressed the opinion
of about every one that stopped to admire the youngster.</p>

<p>When we add that Nick was remarkably good natured, his popularity
will be understood. Days and weeks passed without so much as a
whimper being heard from him. If his mother forgot she was the
owner of such a prize, and allowed him to remain on the porch
until he was chilled through or half famished, she was pretty
sure to find him smiling, when she suddenly awakened to her duties
respecting the little fellow.</p>

<p>Several times he tipped over and rolled off the porch, bumping
his head against the stones. A hoarse cry instantly made known
the calamity but by the time he was snatched up (often head downward)
his face was illumined again by his enormous grin, even though
the big teardrops stood on his cheeks.</p>

<p>When he grew so as to be able to stand with the help of something
which he could grasp, a board about a foot and a half high was
placed across the lower part of the open door to prevent him getting
outside.</p>

<p>The first day fat little Nick was confronted with this obstruction
he fell over it, out upon the porch. How he managed to do such
a wonderful thing puzzled father and mother, who half believed
some person or animal must have "boosted" him over; but, as there
was no other person in sight and they did not own a dog, the explanation
was not satisfactory.</p>

<p>True, they had a big Maltese cat, but he was hardly strong enough,
even if he had the disposition, to hoist a plump baby over such
a gate, out of pure mischief.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable thing took place the next week, when
Nick not only fell out of the door and over the obstruction, but
a few minutes later fell in again. In fact, it looked as if from
that time forward Nick Ribsam's position was inverted almost as
often as it was upright.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I want my little boy to learn," said the father,
as he took him on his knee and talked in the language of his Fatherland
"and that is, 'God helps them that help themselves.' Don't ever
forget it!"</p>

<p>"Yaw, I ish not forgots him," replied the youngster, staring
in the broad face of his parent, and essaying to make use of the
little English he had picked up.</p>

<p>The good father and mother acted on this principle from the beginning.
When Nick lost his balance he was left to help himself up again;
when he went bumping all the way down the front steps, halting
a moment on each one, his father complacently smoked his long
pipe and waited to see how the boy was going to get back, while
the mother did not think it worth while to leave her household
duties to look at the misfortunes of the lad.</p>

<p>"God helps them that help themselves."</p>

<p>There is a great deal in this expression, and the father of Master
Nicholas Ribsam seemed to take in the whole far-reaching truth.
"You must do everything you possibly can," he said, many a time;
"you must use your teeth, your hands, and your feet to hang on;
you must never let go; you must hammer away; you must always keep
your powder dry; you must fight to the last breath, and all the
time ask God to help you pull through, and <em>He'll do it!</em>"</p>

<p>This was the creed of Gustav Ribsam and his wife, and it was
the creed which the children drew in with their breath, as may
be said; it was such a grand faith that caused Nick to develop
into a sturdy, self-reliant, brave lad, who expected to take his
own part in the battle of life without asking odds from any one.</p>

<p>The parents of our hero and heroine proved their faith by their
works. By hard, honest toil and economy, they had laid up a competence
which was regularly invested each year, and of which the children
were not allowed to know anything, lest it might make them lazy
and unambitious.</p>

<p>The little house and fifty acres were paid for, and the property
was more than sufficient to meet the wants of the family, even
after the youngsters became large enough to go to school.</p>

<p>The morning on which young Nick Ribsam started for the country
school, a half mile away, was one which he can never forget. He
was six years old, and had picked up enough of the English language
to make himself understood, though his accent was of that nature
that it was sure to excite ridicule on the part of the thoughtless.</p>

<p>As Nick had a large head, he wore of necessity a large cap, with
a long frontispiece and with a button on the top. His coat was
what is called a "roundabout," scarcely reaching to his waist,
but it abounded with pockets, as did the vest which it partly
inclosed. His trousers were coarse, thick, and comfortable, and
his large boots were never touched by blacking, Nick's father
having no belief in such nonsense, but sticking to tallow all
the time.</p>

<p>Nick carried a spelling book and slate under his arm, and, as
he started off, any one looking at him would have been struck
by his bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and generally clean appearance.
As he was so very good natured, he was certain to become quite
an acquisition to the school.</p>

<p>There are no more cruel, or perhaps thoughtless people in the
world than a number of school-boys, under certain conditions.
The peculiar dress and the broken language of little Nick excited
laughter at once, and this soon turned into ridicule.</p>

<p>Nick was beset continually at recess and at noon by the boys,
who immediately christened him "Dutchy." He laughed and did not
seem to mind it, for his philosophy was that no words applied
to him could injure him, and so long as the boys kept their hands
off he did not care.</p>

<p>Among the pupils was Herbert Watrous, a spruce young gentleman
from the city, who dressed better than the others, and who threw
out hints about the sparring lessons he had taken at home, and
his wish that he might soon have a chance to show his playmates
how easily he could vanquish an opponent, much larger than himself,
by reason of his "science."</p>

<p>He was fully four years older than Nick, and much taller&mdash;a fact
which Herbert regretted as the Pennsylvania Hollander was too
insignificant for him to pick a quarrel with.</p>

<p>But that was no reason, as he looked at his privileges in this
life, why he should not play the tyrant and bully over the honest
little fellow and he proceeded at once to make life unbearable
to Nicholas.</p>

<p>He began the cry of "Dutchy," and, finding that it did not disturb
the serenity of the lad, he resorted to more active measures on
the way home from school.</p>

<p>He began by knocking off his hat, and when Nick looked at him
in a surprised way and asked why he did it, the city youth assumed
a pugilistic attitude and answered, "Greens; what are you going
to do about it, Dutchy?"</p>

<p>"Be careful of him," whispered one of the boys, who felt some
sympathy for Nick in his persecutions; "he's <em>science</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't care vat he ain't," replied Nick, beginning to lose
his temper; "if he don't lets me be, he'll got into trouble."</p>

<p>Just then Nick started to overtake a lad, who tapped him on the
back and invited him to play a game of tag. As he passed close
to Herbert, that boy threw out his foot and Nick went sprawling
headlong, his book and slate flying from under his arm, while
his cap shot a dozen-feet in another direction.</p>

<p>The other boys broke into laughter, while several of the girls
cried out that it was a shame.</p>

<p>Nick picked himself up, and putting on his cap, turned about
to ask Herbert what he meant by such cruelty, when he was confronted
by the bully, who had thrown himself into his fancy pugilistic
posture, and with one eye shut and his tongue thrust out, said:</p>

<p>"What are you going to do about it, Dutchy?"</p>

<p>"I'll show you vot I do!"</p>
