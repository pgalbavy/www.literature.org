<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Brigham Clark's squirrel-skin story was not calculated to build up the
<u>entente cordial</u> with Texas, but Brigham was no trimmer. The only kind
of fighting he knew was to stand up and strike from the shoulder, and a
few cracks about Mormon marital customs had not tended to lighten the
blow. Numerically he was outnumbered by the Texans, but when it came to
a contest of wits he did not need any help. He went off to bed now,
laughing, and to all of Bowles' chidings he turned an unheeding ear.
</p><p>"Let 'em roar," he said. "It's no skin off my nose. Them fellers has
been cavin' round and givin' off head long enough--I sure capped 'em in
on that, all right. Well, let 'em rough-house me if they want to--they's
two can play at that game. I never seen the Texan yet that looked bad to
me. And if they git too gay the boss will fire the whole caboodle. I
ain't lookin' fer trouble, but no bunch of ignorant Texicans can run it
over <u>me</u>! Umph-umm!"
</p><p>So the feud went on, and when Dixie rode into camp with the mail she
smelled war in the very air. The men walked past each other with the
wary glances of fighting dogs, and even her little comedy at the
delivering of the letters failed to visibly lighten the gloom. A private
interview with the cook, who carefully kept out of the ruction and gave
neither side comfort nor succor, revealed the fact that the situation
was serious; and with the success of the round-up at stake, Dixie May
was quick to act. When her father returned to his dog tent at
supper-time he found her war-bag inside, and with a mount of horses cut
out for her, Dixie Lee took on for a cowboy.
</p><p>They were up on the cedar ridges of the mountains now, driving down wild
steers from the upper pastures, and a woman was as good as a man. Dixie
was better than most, for she had ridden those rough mesas before and
could drift off a ridge like a blacktail. Her desperate rivalry in the
chase fired the hearts of the most malingering, and more than one
moss-headed old outlaw found himself outgeneraled and flogged into the
herd. And a steer is a steer these days--he is worth as much as a horse.
</p><p>Every morning as the punchers set out on the long circle Dixie May
picked out a man to dare, and several prairie-bred Texans failed to
follow her over the rocks. Mounted on the best horses in the remuda,
knowing the ways of wild cattle and the lay of the land ahead, she took
after the first puff of dust she saw and followed it till she smelled
smoke. If her steer turned back, she ran him down and roped him, and if
her escort did not show up by that time, she hog-tied her catch and went
on. It was a wild, free life, and she threw herself into it recklessly,
glorying in the unholy joy of beating them at their own game. She rode
with Brigham, and Hardy Atkins; uncouth mountain men, and raw-boned
nester kids; and finally, when the time was ripe, she picked out Bowles.
</p><p>Bowles was mounted on his top horse, Wa-ha-lote, and he rode proudly
along behind Brigham, for in the rough and tumble of cross-country
running he was holding his own with the best. A bunch of wild cattle
sprang up suddenly from their hiding place on a far point; for a moment
they stood staring, their ears silhouetted against the sky, and the keen
eyes of the straw-boss read their earmarks like a book.
</p><p>"They's two Bat Wing steers in that bunch," he said. "Head 'em off,
Bowles, and drive 'em down the cañon!"
</p><p>Then Bowles leaned forward in his saddle and raced them for the high
ground. He headed them, and they doubled to beat him back. Once more he
headed them off, while the outfit went on with its circle, and just as
they stopped to look him over again he saw a horse coming down on his
right. It was Dixie, mounted on her favorite roan, and she motioned to
him to swing around on the left. Then the riding began all over again,
for the steers were wild as bucks and they knew every trail on the
bench; but the shod horses were too fast for them over the rocks, and as
their hoofs began to get hot from the friction they turned and dashed
for the rim.
</p><p>From the high ridge where the circle was led, to the bottom cañon where
the hold-up herd lay, the land fell away in three benches, each a little
narrower, each a little steeper at the jump-off--and Bowles and Dixie
Lee went over the first pitch hot-foot on the heels of their quarry.
They raced back and forth on the second terrace, trying to head the
cattle down a natural trail; but now a wild, self-destroying panic came
upon them and they took off over the rough ground.
</p><p>"I'll dare you to follow me!" cried Dixie, turning her eager roan after
them; and helter-skelter over the rough rocks, swinging and ducking
under trees and jumping over boulders and bushes, she went spurring
after the cattle. Behind her came Bowles, his eyes big with excitement,
staring at her madcap riding with the fear of death in his heart. Down
over the rough jump-off they went, the dust and smoke from
friction-burnt hoofs striking hot in their faces as they rode, and by
the grace of God somehow they reached the bench below.
</p><p>"Don't ride over there!" he entreated, as the cattle scampered on toward
the last pitch; but Dixie laughed at him, loud and shrill.
</p><p>"Will you take a dare?" she taunted, raising her quirt to strike; and
before Bowles could say a word, Wa-ha-lote grabbed the bit and went
after her like a rocket. Whatever his master thought, it was outside of
Wa-ha-lote's simple code to let any horse give him his dust. Wild with
terror and excitement, the big steers made straight for the jump-off,
which was high and steep; over they went, with Dixie after them, and
then, like a bolt from behind, Wa-ha-lote leaped over the rampart and
went plowing down the slope. Twice he jumped as he came to dykes of
rock, and Bowles stayed with him like a hurdler; then, with a lightning
scramble over the loose stones, he took the trail from the roan and went
pounding down the hill.
</p><p>Tree limbs reached down to brush Bowles off, sharp stubs threatened
momentarily to snag his legs, and boulders to dash his brains out if he
fell, but the lion-hearted Wa-ha-lote had asserted his mastery and
Bowles could only hang on. At the bottom of the slide they crashed
through a dead-limbed cedar, sending the bone-dry sticks flying in every
direction; and when Bowles swung up into the saddle he was thundering
across the flat and the steers were at his bits. Vague wisps of smoke,
white and smelling like a blacksmith-shop, leaped up as the harried
brutes skated over the rocks, and Bowles knew that his battle was won.
Once in the soft sand of the creek bed they would never turn back to the
heights, for their feet were worn to the quick. But it had been a hard
race--even Wa-ha-lote was slowing down, and Dixie Lee was nowhere in
sight.
</p><p>A sudden doubt assailed Bowles, and he tugged sharply at the bit; he
pulled down to a walk and looked behind; then, as he saw no sign, he
stopped short and let the cattle go. For a tense minute he listened
while Wa-ha-lote puffed like a steamboat; then, with a grave look on his
face, he turned and rode back up the hill.
</p><p>"O Miss Lee!" he shouted. "Dixie!"
</p><p>And a thin answer came from the slope above.
</p><p>"Catch my horse!" it said. "He's down in the gulch!"
</p><p>Bowles stared about and caught sight of the red roan's hide as he stood
behind some trees; then, with his rope about its neck, he went spurring
up the hill.
</p><p>Dixie Lee was lying very awkwardly among the rocks at the foot of a
scrubby juniper, and at the first glance Bowles knew she was hurt. Not
only was her hat gone and her stout skirt ripped and torn, but her face
was very pale and her lips drawn tight together.
</p><p>"Horse fell with me," she said, greeting him with a fleeting smile;
"hurt my knee right bad. First time I've known him to do that--say, help
me out of these rocks."
</p><p>Very tenderly Bowles reached down and raised her to her feet; then, with
one arm about his neck, she tried to hobble away, but at the second hop
she paused.
</p><p>"Nope--hurts too bad," she said; "put me down."
</p><p>But Bowles did nothing of the kind. He took her up in his strong young
arms and carried her down the hill. He even wished it were farther, but
she spied a bed of leaves under a cedar and ordered him to put her
there. Then she looked up at him curiously and for a while lay very
still.
</p><p>"What you got there?" she inquired, as he came back holding his hat, and
Bowles showed her a crownful of water that he had brought from a pool in
the gulch.
</p><p>"Ah!" sighed Dixie, and drank out of it without scruple, long and deep.
"Say, that's good," she said; "now pour some on my hands--they're all
scratched up." He did that too, and loaned her his neck handkerchief to
sop up the last of the wet.
</p><p>"Well, it's a wonder you wouldn't ask a few questions," she observed at
length, bathing her grimy face with the handkerchief. "'How did it
happen?' or 'How're you feeling?' or something like that!"
</p><p>She smiled naturally at him now, fluffing out her dark hair that hung
like an Indian's in heavy braids; and Bowles' face lighted up and then
flushed a rosy red.
</p><p>"I see you are feeling better," he said, sitting down off to one side,
and decorously regarding his wet hat, "so how did it happen?"
</p><p>"Well," began Dixie, ruefully inspecting her torn hands, "all I can
remember is feeling my horse going down and jerking my feet out of the
stirrups--then I fetched up in that juniper. I scrambled out the minute
I struck--afraid old Rufus would fall on me--and that's where I hurt my
knee--I bumped it against a rock."
</p><p>She felt the injured limb over carefully and shook her head.
</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't travel on that for a while," she said. "So get me
your coat to put under it and prop it up, and we'll talk about something
pleasant. It'll be all right, I reckon, after I rest a while, but that
fall certainly jarred me up.
</p><p>"Say," she observed, as Bowles came back with his coat, "that was pretty
good, wasn't it, what I was telling you the other day--about nursing you
back to health and strength. Looks like you're the nurse, the way it
turns out. But you're going to make a good one," she went on, as he
tucked the coat under her knee; "I can see that. Now, most people, when
you get a hurt, or a fall, or something, they come rushing up to where
you're making faces and ask a lot of foolish questions--'Are you hurt?'
and 'Did you fall?' and all that, until you want to kill 'em. But you
haven't hardly said a word."
</p><p>"No," said Bowles, blushing and looking away. "I'm awfully sorry you
fell--hope I didn't make you. Is there anything more I can do?"
</p><p>"Oh, that's all right," she assured him. "We all take a fall once in a
while. I feel kind of weak and trifling right now--but don't go! No, I
want you here for company!"
</p><p>Bowles had stood up on a pretext of looking after the horses, but Dixie
was firm.
</p><p>"No, you stay," she said, as he explained that she might wish to be
alone. "You're out West now, Bowles, and you remember what Hardy Atkins
told you--'if a lady asks you to take a letter, <u>take it</u>!' Of course,
that was none of Hardy's business, but that's the rule out here, and I
want you to come back and sit down. No, not away over there--I want you
right up close!"
</p><p>Bowles came back as readily as a dog, but he did not sit very close. For
some reason unknown to himself he assumed that she would be embarrassed,
not only by their isolated position but by the intimacies which had
arisen between them. Moved by a strong and humane purpose, he had
gathered her up in his arms and carried her down the hill; but hardly
had he felt her arm about his neck, her breath against his cheek, and
her heart against his breast, when the dimensions of his world had
suddenly narrowed down, and there was only Dixie Lee and him. And now he
was still dazed and breathless, afraid of himself, and not trusting in
his strength--and yet he would do anything to please her.
</p><p>"Come on over here," she coaxed, patting the leaves by her side, and
Bowles came as near as he dared. "Now tell me some stories," she said,
settling back and closing her eyes. "Ah, this will be fine--tell me
something interesting, so I can forget that knee. It sure aches--when I
think about it--but I believe there's something in mind-cure. Go ahead
and talk. Where'd you learn to ride so well?"
</p><p>"Oh, that?" beamed Bowles. "Do you think I can ride? Well, I'm not so
bad, over the rocks, you know. I used to ride to the hounds. We chased
foxes through the woods, leaping stone walls and five-bar gates and all
that, and, really, I used to enjoy it. Nothing like cow-punching, of
course, but great sport all the same. I remember once we were out at
Clarendon----"
</p><p>He fell into the details of a fox hunt--the first time he had spoken of
his past life--and Dixie was careful not to interrupt him. Then he told
of his life in the military school, where they taught boys the
cavalryman's craft, and Dixie lay quiet and listened. If her knee hurt
she did not know it, for she was piecing out his career. School,
college, country club, one after the other he alluded to them, but even
in his boyish enthusiasm he was careful to mention no names; and as he
wandered on with his stories Dixie Lee wondered who he was. Certainly no
inconsiderable man in his own country, and yet here he was, an ordinary
hired hand, punching cows for forty-five a month. But why? And if he had
followed her to the end of the world to win her heart, why did he not
talk of love to her, now that they were there together? And when he had
taken her in his arms, when he had carried her under the tree and pulled
off her boot and tucked his coat under her knee, why had there been no
caress, no look, no unnecessary attentions to show that he really cared?
Dixie May opened her eyes and gazed out at him through half-closed
lashes, and somehow she liked him better--he seemed to be different from
the rest.
</p><p>"Mr. Bowles," she said at last, "you're an awfully interesting man, but
there are some things I can't understand. There's something mysterious
about you. I know you must be all right, because I met you at Mrs.
Melvine's, but at the same time you're hiding out like an ordinary
horse-stealing Texican. What are you up to, anyway?"
</p><p>"Why, I thought you knew all about that," explained Bowles, the old
baffling smile coming back into his eyes. "Don't you remember, I told
you about it on the train?"
</p><p>"Yes, I remember, all right," answered Dixie. "But you didn't tell me
very much--and then you told me different at Chula Vista. I thought I
had a line on you once, but you're too deep for me. What's this I hear
about a girl?"
</p><p>"A girl?" repeated Bowles, with questioning gravity. "Why, what do you
mean? What did you hear?"
</p><p>"A girl back in New York," continued Dixie, glancing at him shrewdly as
she hazarded a guess--and as she gazed he flushed and looked away.
</p><p>"Whatever you have heard," he said at last, "I have nothing to be
ashamed of--would you like me to get you some water?"
</p><p>"Aw, Mr. Bowles," cried Dixie reproachfully, "are you trying to
side-step me on this?"
</p><p>"No, indeed!" replied Bowles, settling back with masterful calm. "What
is it you have heard--and what would you like to know?"
</p><p>He paused and regarded her expectantly, and Dixie saw that she was
called. A shadow passed over her face; a shadow of annoyance, and of
suspicion, perhaps, as well; but she felt the rebuke of his frankness
and pursued her inquiry no further.
</p><p>"Well, perhaps you are right," she said, as if answering an unspoken
reproof. "It was nothing to your discredit, Mr. Bowles; and I am sure it
is none of my business. I guess I'm kind of spoiled out here--I get to
joshing with these cowboys until I don't know anything else. I believe I
would like that drink."
</p><p>Bowles leaped up promptly at the word and came back with his new hat
full of water. He held it for her to drink, and as she finished and
looked up she saw that his eyes were troubled.
</p><p>"Oh, dear!" she cried impulsively, "have I made you any trouble? You've
been so good to me here--what have I gone and done now?"
</p><p>"Oh, it's not you at all," he assured her, and then his voice broke and
he faltered. "But have you really heard from New York?"
</p><p>"Why, no, Mr. Bowles," soothed Dixie, laying her hand on his arm. "Not a
word--I don't know anything about you--I was only making it up."
</p><p>"Oh!" said Bowles, and drew his arm away. He looked out at the horses
for a moment, poured the water out of his hat, and turned back, his old
smiling self.
</p><p>"How is your knee now?" he inquired kindly. "Do you think you can ride?
I suppose we ought to be going pretty soon."
</p><p>Dixie glanced over at him and her heart sank--she had observed these
sudden changes in Bowles before, and even his boyish smile could not
lighten the veiled rebuke. When Bowles had thoughts that were
anti-social he was always unusually kind, and his way of expressing
disapproval was to tactfully change the subject. And now he was talking
of going! Dixie scowled and felt of her knee, and rose stiffly to her
feet.
</p><p>"Well, if you're in such a hurry," she sulked; but Bowles was at her
side in an instant.
</p><p>"Oh, my dear Miss Lee!" he cried, catching her as she poised for a limp.
"Please don't do that! Let me carry you, when the time comes, but we
will rest as long as you please."
</p><p>He passed a compelling arm about her and lowered her gently to her
place; then he sat down beside her, and breathed hard as he set her
free.
</p><p>"Really," he murmured, "we don't seem to understand each other very
well, Miss Lee!"
</p><p>"That's because neither one of us is telling the truth!" observed Dixie
with a certain bitterness.
</p><p>They sat for a moment in silence, and then she turned about and looked
him squarely in the eye.
</p><p>"Mr. Bowles," she said, in measured tones, "who are you, anyway?"
</p><p>"Who--me?" parried Bowles, lapsing into the vernacular. "Why, you know
me! I'm Bowles, the gentleman you met at Mrs. Melvine's."
</p><p>"There! You see?" commented Dixie. "You're afraid to tell your own name,
and I'm----"
</p><p>"Yes?" questioned Bowles.
</p><p>"Well, I don't know what I'm afraid of," she went on bluntly, "but I've
got <u>something</u> on my mind."
</p><p>"Why, surely," began Bowles, apprehensively, "I--I hope I haven't given
offense in any way. You were hurt, you know--and I was a little
excited--and----"
</p><p>"Oh, that's all right," said Dixie heartily. "You're a perfect
gentleman--I always knew that. But you haven't had much to do with
women, have you, Mr. Bowles?"
</p><p>Her voice trailed off a little at the close, and Bowles looked up at her
mystified. He thought quickly, wondering where she was leading him, and
decided to tell the truth.
</p><p>"Why, no, Miss Lee," he stammered, "I suppose not. I hope I haven't----"
</p><p>"Oh, no, no!" cried Dixie. "I don't mean that. I was just
thinking--well, I mustn't take advantage of you, then."
</p><p>She favored him with one of her sudden, tantalizing smiles, and his
brain whirled as he looked away.
</p><p>"No," he muttered, taking a deep breath; "it wouldn't be fair, you
know."
</p><p>"Well, go and cinch up my horse, then," she said, "and I'll make an
exception of you."
</p><p>He looked up at her suddenly, startled by the way she spoke, and went to
do her will.
</p><p>"Now," he announced, when the horse was ready, "shall I help you while
you mount?"
</p><p>"Why, yes," she said, "if you think it's safe!"
</p><p>And then he gathered her into his arms.
</p><p>"I'll be careful," he said. But the devil tempted him--and Dixie forgot
and smiled.
</p><p>"Never mind," she whispered, as he lifted her to the saddle; "that was
to pay you for being nurse."
