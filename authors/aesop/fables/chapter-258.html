THE LARK (according to an ancient legend) was created before the
earth itself, and when her father died, as there was no earth,
she could find no place of burial for him.  She let him lie
uninterred for five days, and on the sixth day, not knowing what
else to do, she buried him in her own head.  Hence she obtained
her crest, which is popularly said to be her father's
grave-hillock.  
 
Youth's first duty is reverence to parents.
