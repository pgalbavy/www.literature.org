<p>Breakfast on Sunday morning was an hour later than on week-days,
and Priscilla, who usually made no public appearance before luncheon,
honoured it by her presence. Dressed in black silk, with a ruby
cross as well as her customary string of pearls round her neck,
she presided. An enormous Sunday paper concealed all but the extreme
pinnacle of her coiffure from the outer world.</p>

<p>"I see Surrey has won," she said, with her mouth full, "by four
wickets. The sun is in Leo: that would account for it!"</p>

<p>"Splendid game, cricket," remarked Mr. Barbecue-Smith heartily
to no one in particular; "so thoroughly English."</p>

<p>Jenny, who was sitting next to him, woke up suddenly with a start.
"What?" she said. "What?"</p>

<p>"So English," repeated Mr. Barbecue-Smith.</p>

<p>Jenny looked at him, surprised. "English? Of course I am."</p>

<p>He was beginning to explain, when Mrs. Wimbush vailed her Sunday
paper, and appeared, a square, mauve-powdered face in the midst
of orange splendours. "I see there’s a new series of articles
on the next world just beginning," she said to Mr. Barbecue-Smith.
"This one’s called ‘Summer Land and Gehenna.’"</p>

<p>"Summer Land," echoed Mr. Barbecue-Smith, closing his eyes. "Summer
Land. A beautiful name. Beautiful&mdash;beautiful."</p>

<p>Mary had taken the seat next to Denis’s. After a night of careful
consideration she had decided on Denis. He might have less talent
than Gombauld, he might be a little lacking in seriousness, but
somehow he was safer.</p>

<p>"Are you writing much poetry here in the country?" she asked,
with a bright gravity.</p>

<p>"None," said Denis curtly. "I haven’t brought my typewriter."</p>

<p>"But do you mean to say you can’t write without a typewriter?"</p>

<p>Denis shook his head. He hated talking at breakfast, and, besides,
he wanted to hear what Mr. Scogan was saying at the other end
of the table.</p>

<p>"...My scheme for dealing with the Church," Mr. Scogan was saying,
"is beautifully simple. At the present time the Anglican clergy
wear their collars the wrong way round. I would compel them to
wear, not only their collars, but all their clothes, turned back
to frantic&mdash;coat, waistcoat, trousers, boots&mdash;so that every clergyman
should present to the world a smooth facade, unbroken by stud,
button, or lace. The enforcement of such a livery would act as
a wholesome deterrent to those intending to enter the Church.
At the same time it would enormously enhance, what Archbishop
Laud so rightly insisted on, the ‘beauty of holiness’ in the few
incorrigibles who could not be deterred."</p>

<p>"In hell, it seems," said Priscilla, reading in her Sunday paper,
"the children amuse themselves by flaying lambs alive."</p>

<p>"Ah, but, dear lady, that’s only a symbol," exclaimed Mr. Barbecue-Smith,
"a material symbol of a h-piritual truth. Lambs signify..."</p>

<p>"Then there are military uniforms," Mr. Scogan went on. "When
scarlet and pipe-clay were abandoned for khaki, there were some
who trembled for the future of war. But then, finding how elegant
the new tunic was, how closely it clipped the waist, how voluptuously,
with the lateral bustles of the pockets, it exaggerated the hips;
when they realized the brilliant potentialities of breeches and
top-boots, they were reassured. Abolish these military elegances,
standardise a uniform of sack-cloth and mackintosh, you will very
soon find that..."</p>

<p>"Is anyone coming to church with me this morning?" asked Henry
Wimbush. No one responded. He baited his bare invitation. "I read
the lessons, you know. And there’s Mr. Bodiham. His sermons are
sometimes worth hearing."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," said Mr. Barbecue-Smith. "I for one prefer
to worship in the infinite church of Nature. How does our Shakespeare
put it? ‘Sermons in books, stones in the running brooks.’" He
waved his arm in a fine gesture towards the window, and even as
he did so he became vaguely, but none the less insistently, none
the less uncomfortably aware that something had gone wrong with
the quotation. Something&mdash;what could it be? Sermons? Stones? Books?</p>
