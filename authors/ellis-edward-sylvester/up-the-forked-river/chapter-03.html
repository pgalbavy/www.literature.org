<p>The reputation of the Misses Credell's Young Ladies' Seminary
was international and the halo of its history was sanctified by
time. It was founded by the grandmother of the estimable sisters,
one of the foremost educators of her day, and one who took up
the profession of teaching through love for it, since her wealth
made her independent for life.</p>

<p>At the period when the institution rises before us, its students
represented the four quarters of the globe. There were young women
fitting for the missionary field in India and China; the daughters
of eminent financiers in England, Germany, France and Spain, those
whose parents' influence was felt in distant climes, including
several from the revolution-pestered republics of South America.</p>

<p>Manuela Estacardo was the only child of the deceased sister of
President Pedro Yozarro, Dictator of Atlamalco. She was a brilliant
daughter of the tropics, gifted in mind and person, with the midnight
eyes and hair, the dark complexion, classical features, small
white teeth and faultless form rarely seen except in the fervid
sunlight of the low latitudes. Positive and negative electricity
draw together, which perhaps explains why the two most devoted
intimates at the seminary were Señorita Estacardo and Warrenia
Rowland. The latter was a true product of the North, with blue
eyes, pink skin, hair like the floss of the ripening corn, and
a figure as perfect as her sister's of the South, while the mental
gifts in one were equalled in the other.</p>

<p>The friendship of these two began with their first meeting, and
continued unrippled to the sad day of gladness when they were
graduated. Manuela spent most of her vacations in the home of
Warrenia in California, and the promise had been solemnly given
by the latter that she would visit her friend after her return
to her distant home under the equator. The story of this sweet
comradeship cannot be told in a fractional part of its fulness.
To prevent any misunderstanding, however, on the part of the reader,
let it be known that though Major Jack Starland and the Señorita
were often together, and they became the warmest of friends, there
never was and there never could be any tenderer feeling between
them. And this was true for the best of reasons: the dark-eyed
Señorita had pledged her heart to a certain young officer of her
own country. Both were as loyal in their affections as is the
magnet to the pole and there was no possible room for complications.</p>

<p>When Mr. Starland presented the handsome yacht to his son Jack,
neither he nor his partner Mr. Rowland dreamed of the strange
consequences that were to follow. Jack resigned his commission
in the army, his yacht, which he had named the Warrenia, in honor
of his "sister," was returned to him with the thanks of the United
States government, and he was then ready to carry out the stipulation
of his father, that he should bring the craft around Cape Horn
to San Francisco. Her usefulness when in the naval service, required
her presence in the Atlantic, but she was now free to go whither
her owner willed. Thus the perilous voyage had been postponed
for a few years.</p>

<p>Manuela Estacardo had returned to her home in tropical America,
and she and her dearest friend, Warrenia Rowland, were never laggard
in their correspondence. The South American insisted that Warrenia
should make her long-promised visit, and the daughter of the North
was eager to do so. The journey, however, was so long and difficult
that no practicable way presented itself until in a twinkling,
as may be said, the path was cleared by the decision of Major
Starland to double Cape Horn with his yacht.</p>

<p>What was to prevent his taking Warrenia as a passenger, ascend
the Amazon to the home of Manuela and pay that cherished visit?
The plan was so simple that every one to whom it was mentioned
wondered why it was not thought of before. Aunt Cynthia would
accompany her niece as chaperon, and the pause would cause little
delay in the voyage. What matter if it did, for time was of no
special consequence, and a few weeks, one way or the other, were
not worth taking into account.</p>

<p>When Mr. Rowland proposed to his partner that a condition of
the gift of the yacht to his son ought to be the severe test of
a voyage under the latter's direction around Cape Horn, he never
imagined that his daughter was to share the danger. But he could
not ask that the young man of whom he was so fond should be compelled
to face a peril of that nature in which he would refuse his daughter
a share. It cost him a pang to yield, but he did so without murmur,
and fondly kissed her good bye, with never a thought of the remarkable
experience she would be called upon to pass through.</p>

<p>As for good Aunt Cynthia, she was wholly ignorant of what in
the most favorable circumstances was inevitable. The smothering
temperature, the plague of insect life and the actual dangers
from the character of the natives themselves, were wholly unknown
and unsuspected by her. Had she understood one-half the truth,
not even her love for her niece would have impelled her to leave
her comfortable home, nor would she ever have given her consent
that Warrenia should engage in any such wild, foolhardy undertaking.
But Aunt Cynthia's education had been of the early fashionable
kind, which furnished only the smallest modicum of knowledge.
You may be sure that the younger ones, who knew a good deal more
about the country and the people, took care not to enlighten her
when they answered her numerous inquiries.</p>

<p>However, all was satisfactorily arranged and Señorita Estacardo
was thrown into transports of delight by the receipt of a letter
saying that by the time it reached the young woman, a Miss Rowland
would be out on the ocean in the charge of their old friend, Major
Jack Starland, and well on their way to the home of the Señorita,
where they intended to make a good long visit, before resuming
their long voyage around the southern point of the continent and
then up the western coast to San Francisco.</p>

<p>Ascending the mighty Amazon to the mouth of the Rio Rubio, known
also as the Forked River, the yacht reached the home of Señorita
Estacardo, who, it need not be said, gave the most joyous welcome
to the girl whom she loved more than any one else in the wide
world.</p>

<p>Before reaching its present destination, the <em>Warrenia</em>
came to the little republic of Zalapata, where a pause was made
for two or three days, during which the Major and the young ladies
called upon General Bambos, the President and Dictator, who treated
them with the utmost consideration. Later, he became the guest
of Major Starland on the yacht, upon which he spent most of his
time while the Americans lay off that quaint town. The susceptible
heart of the bulky South American crackled into flame on the first
sight of the northern beauty, though he smothered the secret so
well that none except the young woman herself suspected it and
with her it was scarcely more than a suspicion.</p>

<p>From Zalapata the yacht steamed to Atlamalco, the home of Manuela
Estacardo. There the party was received by the other impressionable
type of the tropics, General Pedro Yozarro, who left nothing undone
to make their visit pleasant in the highest degree. The novelty
of her experience was its chief enjoyment to Miss Rowland, who
found a thrill in the life, with its conditions the opposite of
those to which she had always been accustomed. She and her aunt
were received into the household of General Yozarro, who immediately
became their humble slave. Since the death of his wife and sister,
the latter taking place shortly after the return of his niece,
Manuela, the latter had been the head of the household and its
retinue of servants.</p>

<p>The Señorita had been told the agreement between Major Starland
and Miss Rowland, which was that during their visit to this part
of the world, they were to be known as brother and sister. She
was to be addressed as Miss Warrenia Starland. Her hostess faithfully
carried out the wishes of her friend.</p>

<p>"It was Jack's proposition," explained Warrenia; "he seems never
able to get over that absurd fancy of his boyhood that we are
really brother and sister, when in fact we do not bear the slightest
relation to each other. I wanted him to use my name, but he is
so stubborn he wouldn't agree to it. You know there is some similarity
in our names, but he said it would be much more convenient for
me to take his."</p>

<p>"There are several good reasons why you should do so," said the
Señorita with a meaning smile; "one of which is that you will
grow accustomed to it."</p>

<p>"But what advantage is there in that?"</p>

<p>"It will come easier when you <em>do</em> make the change."</p>

<p>"I can't pretend to misunderstand you, but I am sure that will
never take place; neither Jack nor I has such a thought."</p>

<p>"How do you know what his thoughts are?"</p>

<p>"Would he not have told me long ago?"</p>

<p>"Hasn't he done so?"</p>

<p>"Not so much as by a hint. It has really been as brother and
sister between us. He has always accepted that relation and so
have I."</p>

<p>"You give no reason why it should not soon assume a tenderer
and closer nature; I believe it will; I shall be delighted."</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear Manuela, I know your heart, but we of the North
do not make love as you of the tropics. One of these days, Jack
will meet the right woman."</p>

<p>"I believe he met her years ago."</p>

<p>"Meaning me, but you are mistaken."</p>

<p>"How is it with <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"I am still heart free. I won't deny that I have met one or two
with whom I was pleased, but it was nothing more."</p>

<p>"Because your love has gone elsewhere; it went long ago; you
may think I am mistaken, my darling Warrenia, but you will soon
find I am not."</p>

<p>Then both laughed, kissed and talked of other things.</p>
