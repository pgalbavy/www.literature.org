<p>"When M. Longuet had recovered from the emotion with which my
explanation of the disappearance of the express had filled him,
he embraced me and handed me a revolver which he had found in
the pocket of Signor Petito. He did not wish to keep it on him.
He was desirous that I should be able, at need, to defend myself
against the eccentricities of which he feared, on grounds based,
alas! on a too real experience, the dangerous return. For the
same reason he entrusted to me a large knife which had also come
from the pocket of Signor Petito.</p>

<p>"We laughed; and then we set ourselves to consider our situation
seriously. M. Longuet went on emptying his pockets; and there
came out of them seven little electric lamps similar to those
I had myself bought before falling into this hole. He congratulated
himself, saying that his instinct had been right in urging him
to take plenty of them, for, adding my six to his seven, we now
had thirteen lamps, guaranteed to give forty-eight hours' light
each, which gave us six hundred and twenty-four hours of consecutive
light. He added that since we should not need light for the ten
hours a day, afternoon&mdash;he was an advocate of the; restful siesta&mdash;and
night, during which we should sleep, we had light for forty-four
days eight hours.</p>

<p>"I said to him: 'You are altogether too old-fashioned, M. Longuet.
Cartouche immured in the Catacombs would have done exactly the
same with electric lamps as you are doing. But I, M. Longuet,
I take your seven lamps and add three of mine to them; and this
is what I do with them!'</p>

<p>"I threw them carelessly down against the foot of the wall.</p>

<p>"'There is no point in dragging about these <em>impedimenta</em>,'
I said. 'Are you hungry, M. Longuet?'</p>

<p>"'Very, M. Mifroid.'</p>

<p>"'How long do you think you could be hungry?'</p>

<p>"Since he did not seem to understand, I explained that I meant
to ask him how long he thought he could remain so hungry without
eating.</p>

<p>"'I am pretty sure,' said he, 'that if I had to stay forty-eight
hours as hungry as this...'</p>

<p>"'Let us suppose that you stayed as hungry as this for seven
days,' I interrupted. 'Three lamps would be quite sufficient for
us, for at the end of those three lamps we should have no need
of light!'</p>

<p>"He had understood. But he smiled amiably, groped about, produced
from the floor a good-sized parcel, and said:</p>

<p>"'But you see, M. Mifroid, I need not endure this hunger a moment
longer than I need. I have here a ham which weighs ten pounds,
or a hundred and sixty ounces. I am assured that if a man chews
it in the manner invented by M. Fletcher of the United States,
he can live for an unlimited period on four ounces of ham a day,
and retain the full possession of his faculties and muscular power.
We have therefore food for one man for forty days, food for two
for twenty days. And then'&mdash;he paused, and a singular light came
into his eyes&mdash;'I think, M. Mifroid, that then&mdash;at the end of
that twenty days, <em>one of us will Fletcherise the other</em>!'</p>

<p>"'Nothing, M. Longuet, nothing would induce me to preserve my
life by the degrading practice of cannibalism!' I said warmly.</p>

<p>"'It is a sentiment which does you much honour, M. Mifroid,'
said M. Longuet. 'But there is no need, and indeed it would be
impossible, that we should both become cannibals.'</p>

<p>"I was extremely disgusted, naturally, that M. Longuet should
have been guilty of such an egregiously old-fashioned act as to
be unable even to make an unexpected visit to the Catacombs, through
a hole in the street, without bringing a ham with him; but I picked
up the other ten electric lamps. I did not let my natural annoyance
find vent in words; I only said to him, 'How on earth do you come
to be walking about Paris with a ten-pound ham?'</p>

<p>"'I am going to write my memoirs,' said M. Longuet. 'And since
quiet is necessary to the writing of one's memoirs, and I feared
that you gentlemen of the Police would do your best to rob me
of that peace, if I gave you the chance, I was going to shut myself
in a little hiding-place I know of with this ham, these electric
lamps, and some more necessary provisions which I had not yet
bought, in order to write uninterrupted. The paper and pens I
have already purchased; and they are in my hiding-place.'</p>

<p>"The excuse was valid, and there was nothing to be said. I set
off down the passage.</p>

<p>"'Where are you going?' he said.</p>

<p>"'It does not matter where,' said I. 'But it is necessary to
go anywhere rather than stay here, since here there is no hope.
We will consider our course as we walk. Our only safety is in
walking; and in walking for twenty days without taking any bearings
we have every chance of arriving somewhere.'</p>

<p>"'But why without taking our bearings?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Because,' I replied, 'I have remarked that in all the stories
of the Catacombs it is always those bearings which have been the
ruin of the unfortunate people who have got lost. They mixed up
their bearings, were reduced to utter confusion, and fell into
the exhaustion of despair. In our situation we must avoid every
cause for despair. You are not in despair by any chance, M. Longuet?'</p>

<p>"'Not at all, M. Mifroid; I am only hungry. And I don't mind
saying that if I were less hungry in your delightful society I
should have no regrets whatever for the roofs of Gerando Street.'</p>

<p>"'We will eat presently, M. Longuet,' I said. 'An ounce of ham
shall be our evening meal.'</p>

<p>"M. Longuet smiled hungrily; then he said, 'Perhaps it would
blunt the edge of my appetite a little if you were to tell me
something about these Catacombs.'</p>

<p>"'I think I ought to begin by giving you a general notion of
the Catacombs,' I said. 'Then you would better understand why
it is absolutely necessary to walk for a long time before getting
out of them.'</p>

<p>"The road we followed was a long passage of from fifteen to twenty
feet high. Its walls were very dry; and the electric light showed
us a stone free from any parasitic vegetation, free even from
any mouldiness. It was a sight which caused me some disquiet,
for if we were to subsist for twenty days on a diet of salt ham,
without any vegetable food, I feared that we might fall a prey
to scurvy. My mind was at ease about the matter of drink; for
I knew that in the Catacombs there were little streams of running
water; and we had only to walk far enough to come across them.</p>

<p>"M. Longuet could not reconcile himself to the idea that we were
walking <em>without caring where we were going</em>. I thought
it wise to make him understand the necessity of not caring where
we were going. I told him, as was the truth, that during the laying
of the sewer the engineers, having descended into the Catacombs
through the hole, had tried in vain to find their way about them
and a way out. They had had to give it up, and to content themselves
with building three pillars to prop up the roof, along the top
of which their sewer ran, with materials let down through the
hole by which we had so hastily descended, and which had been
so definitely and unfortunately bricked up over our heads.</p>

<p>"Not to discourage him, I informed him that to my certain knowledge
we could reckon on at least <em>three hundred and ten miles</em>[6]
of Catacombs, and that there was no reason that there should not
be more. It was evident that if I did not at once make clear to
him the difficulty of getting out, he would have yielded to despair
at the end of a couple of days' journey.</p>

<p>"'Bear in mind then,' I said, 'that they hollowed this soil from
the third to the seventeenth century! Yes; for fourteen hundred
years man has raised from under the soil the materials which were
necessary for building on the top of it! So much so that from
time to time, since there is too much on the top, and in places
nothing at all beneath, the things on top have returned beneath
whence they came.'</p>

<p>"Since we found ourselves under the ancient Quarter d'Enfer,
I recalled to his memory that in 1777 a house in d'Enfer Street
was in that way engulfed. It was precipitated a hundred and twelve
feet below the pavement of its own courtyard. Some months later,
in 1778, seven persons were killed in a similar landslip, in the
district of Menilmontant. I quoted several examples of a later
date, laying stress on the loss of life.</p>

<p>"He understood me and said, 'In fact, it's often more dangerous
to walk about on the top than underneath.'</p>

<p>"I had gained his attention, and finding him so cheerful and
interested, forgetting all about his hunger, I profited by it
to quicken our steps; and I chanted the most spirited chorus I
could remember. He took it up and we sang together:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
'Step out! Step out, boys, with a will!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road is hard and hot;<br/>
&nbsp;There's an inn beyond the hill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And good liquor in a pot!'

</p>
</div>
<p>"That's the song that makes you step out!</p>

<p>"When we were tired of singing (one soon grows tired of singing
in the Catacombs because the voice does not carry), M. Longuet
asked me a hundred questions. He asked me how many feet of soil
there were between us and the surface; and I told him that according
to the last report it varied between eleven and two hundred and
sixty feet.</p>

<p>"'Sometimes,' I said, 'the crust of earth is so thin that it
is necessary to prolong the foundations of public buildings to
the bottom of the Catacombs. Therefore in the course of our peregrinations
there is a chance of our coming across the pillars of Saint-Sulpice,
of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, of the Panthéon, of the Val-de-Grâce,
and of the Odéon. These buildings are, so to speak, raised on
subterranean piles.'</p>

<p>"'Subterranean piles!' he cried joyfully. 'Is there really a
chance that in the course of our peregrinations we shall come
across subterranean piles?'</p>

<p>"Then he returned to his fixed idea:</p>

<p>"'And in the course of our peregrinations is there any chance
of our coming across a way out? Are there many ways out of the
Catacombs?' he said wistfully.</p>

<p>"'Plenty,' said I. 'In the first place, there are exits in the
Quarter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"'So much the better!' he interrupted.</p>

<p>"'And others which are unknown, openings by which no one ever
enters, but which none the less exist: in the cellars of the Panthéon,
in those of Henri IV College, the Observatory, Saint-Sulpice Seminary,
the Midi Hospital, some houses in d'Enfer, Vaugirard, Tombe-Issoire
Streets; at Passy, Chaillot, Saint-Maur, Charenton, and Gentilly...
More than sixty...'</p>

<p>"'That's good!'</p>

<p>"'It would have been better,' I replied, 'if Colbert had not
on July 11, 1678&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Wonderful!' interrupted M. Longuet. 'You have as fine a memory
as M. Lecamus!'</p>

<p>"'It needn't astonish you, M. Longuet. I was formerly secretary
of the Commissary of the district; and it pleased me to take an
interest in the Catacombs, as it has since pleased me to practise
the violin and sculpture. You have not got beyond the old-fashioned
Commissary of Police, my dear M. Longuet.'</p>

<p>"He did not reply to that; he said, 'You were saying that Colbert
on July 11, 1678&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'In order to put a stop to the cupidity of the builders, issued
an order to close the openings into the Catacombs before Paris
was quite undermined. That ordinance of Colbert's has, so to speak,
walled us up.'</p>

<p>"At this moment we were passing a pillar. I examined the structure
and said: 'Here is a pillar which was built by the architects
of Louis <em>XVI </em>in 1778, in the course of the consolidation."</p>

<p>"'That poor Louis <em>XVI!' </em>said M. Longuet. 'He would have
done much better to consolidate the monarchy.'</p>

<p>"'That would have been to consolidate a Catacomb,' said I felicitously,
though I believe that the word Catacombs is only used in the plural.</p>

<p>"M. Longuet had taken the lamp from me, and without ceasing he
turned its ray from right to left as though he were seeking something.
I asked him the reason of this action which began to tire my eyes.</p>

<p>"'I'm looking for corpses,' he said.</p>

<p>"'Corpses?'</p>

<p>"'Skeletons. I have always been told that the walls of the Catacombs
are lined with skeletons.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, that macabre tapestry, my friend (I already addressed him
as 'my friend' because I was so pleased with his serenity in such
serious circumstances), that macabre tapestry is barely three
quarters of a mile long. That three quarters of a mile is very
properly called the Ossuary, because skulls, ribs, shin-bones,
thigh-bones, collar-bones, shoulder-bones and breast-bones form
its sole decoration. But what a decoration! It's a decoration
composed of three million and fifty thousand skeletons, which
have been taken from the cemeteries of Saint-Médard, Cluny, Saint-Landry,
the Carmelites, the Benedictines, and the Innocents. All the bones,
well sorted, arranged, classified, and ticketed, form along the
walls of the passages, roses, parallelograms, triangles, rectangles,
spirals and many other figures of a marvellous exactitude. Let
us desire, my friend, to reach this domain of death. It will mean
life! For I do not know a spot in Paris more agreeably frequented.
You only meet there engaged couples, couples in the middle of
their honeymoon, lovers, and, in fact, all the happy people. But
we are not there yet. What is three quarters of a mile of bones
out of three hundred and ten miles of Catacombs?'</p>

<p>"'Not much,' he said with a deep sigh. 'How many miles do you
think we have gone, M. Mifroid?'</p>

<p>"I begged him not to waste time in calculations which must be
entirely futile; then, to cheer him up, I told him the story of
the janitor and of the four soldiers. The first was very short:
there was once a janitor of the Catacombs who lost his way in
them; they found his body a week later. The second tells of four
soldiers of the Val-de-Grâce who, by the help of a rope, descended
a well two hundred feet deep. They were in the Catacombs. Since
they did not reappear, they let down drummers who made all the
noise they could with their drums. But since in the Catacombs
<em>sound does not carry</em>, no one answered the roll-call.
They searched for them. At the end of forty-eight hours they found
them dying in a cul-de-sac.</p>

<p>"'They had no moral force,' said Theophrastus.</p>

<p>"'They were idiots,' said I. 'When one is stupid enough to lose
one's way in the Catacombs, one is unworthy of pity, I will go
so far as to say, of interest.'</p>

<p>"Thereupon he asked me how I should myself escape losing my way
in the Catacombs. Since we reached a place where another passage
crossed the one we were in, I could answer without delay. I said:</p>

<p>"'Here are two passages, which are you going to take?'</p>

<p>"One of them ran directly away from our starting-point; the other
almost certainly returned to it. Since it was our purpose to get
away from our starting-point, M. Longuet pointed to the first.</p>

<p>"'I was sure of it!' I exclaimed. 'Are you quite ignorant of
the experimental method? The experimental method in the depths
of the Catacombs has demonstrated for centuries that every individual
who believes that he is returning to his starting-point (at the
entrance to the Catacombs) is moving away from it. Therefore the
logical thing to do to get away from one's starting-point is necessarily
to take the road which seems to bring you back to it!'</p>

<p>"We turned down the passage by which we appeared to be retracing
our steps. In that way we were sure that we were not journeying
in vain.</p>

<p>"My two stories had carried us over another mile; then M. Longuet
said: 'I must really have my supper.'</p>

<p>"We had our supper, an ounce of ham each. There was some difficulty
in judging how much an ounce was; but we did the best we could.
He instructed me in the method of eating one's food discovered
by M. Fletcher of the United States. We divided either ounce into
four mouthfuls, not that they were by any means mouthfuls; and
we chewed each patiently till we had extracted from it the last
vestige of flavour. I could well believe him when he assured me
that in this way we obtained from it the whole of the nourishment
it contained. For my part, I should have been delighted to extract
the last vestige of flavour from fifty more such mouthfuls.</p>

<p>"After this meagre, but doubtless exceedingly nourishing supper,
we continued our journey. We went another four miles, when I confessed
that I began to feel tired. I was somewhat surprised to find a
manufacturer of rubber stamps, a sedentary pursuit, like M. Longuet
to be endowed with such untiring vigour. On learning from my watch,
which he still carried, because he said he found it a comfort
to carry somebody else's watch, that it was eleven o'clock, I
suggested that we should go to sleep.</p>

<p>"His fixed idea, that we should find an exit from the Catacombs,
led him to display some reluctance. But I pointed out to him the
extreme improbability of finding an exit in the first twenty miles
of three hundred and ten; and we composed ourselves to rest.</p>
