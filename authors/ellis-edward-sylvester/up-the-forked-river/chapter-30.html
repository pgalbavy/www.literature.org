<p>"It was done purposely!" added the American, placing his hand
on his revolver. Glancing up from where he stood, the head and
shoulders of Captain Ortega were in fair sight through the lowered
slide at the front of the pilot house. He made no attempt to elude
the bullet that he must have expected.</p>

<p>But prudence told the American to wait. The services of the other
were too valuable for the time to be thrown away, even though
the man was under suspicion. Besides, there was one chance in
a hundred that the mishap was unintentional.</p>

<p>Hardly had the motion of the boat ceased, when the double clinking
of the gong in the engine room sounded, accompanied by the jangling
of the bell, which called upon the engineer to reverse instantly
at full speed. The water at the stern was threshed into muddy
foam, but the craft did not slide off the incline up which it
had partly glided.</p>

<p>"Give her full head!" called Major Starland.</p>

<p>"We are doing so, Señor!" replied the placid Captain.</p>

<p>"Your life depends on getting the boat off."</p>

<p>The other made no reply, but with the hand on the pulse of his
patient, as may be said, he noted all the symptoms. He was seen
to turn and look in the direction of the catboat, as if he expected
something from that. He was not disappointed.</p>

<p>General Yozarro and his friends were quick to note the mishap
that had befallen the tug and they headed their craft toward it.
They meant to board, and, despite the bravery of the defenders
they were quite certain to succeed, since, as has been shown,
the "house was divided against itself."</p>

<p>The American dashed to the stern, calling upon Guzman to follow.
It took them but a moment to turn the muzzle of the gun so that
it bore directly upon the catboat.</p>

<p>"If you come any nearer, I'll blow you out of water!"</p>

<p>Then the Major added a bit of information which perhaps was superfluous:</p>

<p>"We Americans always hit what we aim at."</p>

<p>General Yozarro saw that it would never do. He was heard to speak
sharply to the man at the tiller, and the small boat immediately
veered off. Daring as some of the inmates might be, they had not
the courage to advance straight against the throat of a gaping
six-pounder.</p>

<p>"Martella, take charge of the other gun!" called the Major to
the deserter, who, as quick as himself to note the danger, had
stepped to the side of the second piece of ordnance. The two half-circles
commanded by these included the whole horizon, a fact which General
Yozarro and his comrades were not likely to forget.</p>

<p>It would seem that it was impossible for Captain Ortega, with
the aid of the engineer, to effect any change in the position
of the tugboat, while it stuck to the submerged bank, like a bull
ramming its head against a stone wall. Instead of staying motionless
the stern swung slowly to the right and then to the left, as if
trying to wriggle its nose out of the mud. This caused the muzzle
of the cannon to wabble, sometimes being directed straight at
the sailboat, and sometimes to one side of it. But the gun was
so easily shifted that the American could readily perfect the
aim whenever he chose, and that would be done the instant the
enemy tried to run in upon him.</p>

<p>There was a fighting chance for the Atlamalcans. They were so
near that by fiddling back and forth they might by a sudden dash
close in. Most likely, had the wind been strong they would have
tried this, but the breeze remained so soft that quick action
was impossible. The situation was so critical that Major Starland
warned the others of what was certain to follow an attempt to
board.</p>

<p>"General Yozarro, I hold a repeating rifle in my hand; you are
in clear view; just before firing the cannon, I shall shoot you,
and when I pull trigger, you'll drop!"</p>

<p>The Dictator was on his feet about to summon the others to surrender,
with threats of the consequences that would follow a refusal.
The words of the American threw him into a panic and in his haste
to scramble back, he tumbled over the man directly behind him,
not ceasing his frantic efforts till he was cowering at the stern.</p>

<p>The laugh of the American was heard, before he called out:</p>

<p>"I'll pick you out, no matter where you are in the boat, but
I sha'n't fire till you try to run in on us. We'll rake you fore
and aft, and if you don't believe what I say, all you have to
do is to test me."</p>

<p>The General could be heard consulting with his officers. Evidently
the counsels were divided and some favored making the rush, despite
its danger, for, as has been shown, not all of them were poltroons,
but that awful threat of the American had done what it was intended
to do. Had General Yozarro followed his own promptings, he would
have withdrawn, but he lacked the courage to do that, and in his
dilemma tried diplomacy.</p>

<p>"Major Starland, I have naught against you, though you have stolen
my property, but I have the right to demand that you surrender
the deserter with you. Do that, and we will trouble you no more."</p>

<p>"You are not troubling me in the least; I'm enjoying this, though
it doesn't seem to give you much amusement. However, you may as
well save your words regarding the noble Martella, who has served
us so well. He has cast his fate with us and I consider him worth
a thousand such as you."</p>

<p>There was really no call for the General to keep up the conversation
and he subsided. The action of the current steadily bore his boat
forward, but the helmsman shied off toward the northern bank,
and bye and bye, was farther down stream than the tug. Either
one or the other of the six-pounders carefully followed the relative
change of position, and an eighth of a mile below the smaller
craft glided out of sight around a sweeping bend in the river.</p>

<p>All this time the screw of the tugboat was viciously churning,
but the prow held fast. Once or twice a trembling of the hull
seemed to show a partial lessening of the hold, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The danger of boarding having passed for the time, Major Starland
returned to the cabin to speak to his sister. She had understood
everything that had taken place and needed no cheering. Then he
rejoined Captain Guzman and Martella at the front.</p>

<p>"We are free of the General for awhile."</p>

<p>"But there is no saying for how long," remarked the Captain.</p>

<p>"What do you think he means to do?"</p>

<p>"I cannot guess, unless it is to keep on to Zalapata and to appeal
to General Bambos."</p>

<p>"Which is likely to be bad for you, Captain, unless Bambos is
anxious after all to go to war, as he pretended the other day."</p>

<p>"I think," said Martella, "he means to get more men and attack
the boat."</p>

<p>"But where will he get the men from? He is a long way from Atlamalco."</p>

<p>"Yet not very far from <em>Castillo Descanso</em>, where he has
quite a force as you know."</p>

<p>"That will take many hours and we shall not stay here forever."</p>

<p>"There is no saying how long it will be."</p>

<p>"I must have a few words with the Captain."</p>

<p>Major Starland immediately left the lower deck and climbed to
the pilot house, where the executive of the tugboat, having nothing
pressing on his hands, had sat down on the stool placed there
for his convenience and was smoking another cigarette. Looking
around, as he heard the footsteps, he touched his forefinger to
his hat and said:</p>

<p>"<em>Buenas noches</em>, Señor! We are still fast."</p>

<p>"That cannot be disputed."</p>
