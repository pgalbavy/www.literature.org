<P>
Despite his many sources of revenue, Daylight's pyramiding kept
him pinched for cash throughout the first winter.  The
pay-gravel, thawed on bed-rock and hoisted to the surface,
immediately froze again.  Thus his dumps, containing several
millions of gold, were inaccessible.  Not until the returning sun
thawed the dumps and melted the water to wash them was he able to
handle the gold they contained.  And then he found himself with a
surplus of gold, deposited in the two newly organized banks; and
he was promptly besieged by men and groups of men to enlist his
capital in their enterprises.
<P>
But he elected to play his own game, and he entered combinations
only when they were generally defensive or offensive.  Thus,
though he had paid the highest wages, he joined the Mine-owners'
Association, engineered the fight, and effectually curbed the
growing insubordination of the wage-earners.  Times had changed. 
The old days were gone forever.  This was a new era, and
Daylight, the wealthy mine-owner, was loyal to his class
affiliations.  It was true, the old-timers who worked for him, in
order to be saved from the club of the organized owners, were
made foremen over the gang of chechaquos; but this, with
Daylight, was a matter of heart, not head.  In his heart he could
not forget the old days, while with his head he played the
economic game according to the latest and most practical methods.
<P>
But outside of such group-combinations of exploiters, he refused
to bind himself to any man's game.  He was playing a great lone
hand, and he needed all his money for his own backing.  The newly
founded stock-exchange interested him keenly.  He had never
before seen such an institution, but he was quick to see its
virtues and to utilize it.  Most of all, it was gambling, and on
many an occasion not necessary for the advancement of his own
schemes, he, as he called it, went the stock-exchange a flutter,
out of sheer wantonness and fun.
<P>
"It sure beats faro," was his comment one day, when, after
keeping the Dawson speculators in a fever for a week by alternate
bulling and bearing, he showed his hand and cleaned up what would
have been a fortune to any other man.
<P>
Other men, having made their strike, had headed south for the
States, taking a furlough from the grim Arctic battle.  But,
asked when he was going Outside, Daylight always laughed and said
when he had finished playing his hand.  He also added that a man
was a fool to quit a game just when a winning hand had been dealt
him.
<P>
It was held by the thousands of hero-worshipping chechaquos that
Daylight was a man absolutely without fear.  But Bettles and Dan
MacDonald and other sourdoughs shook their heads and laughed as
they mentioned women.  And they were right.  He had always been
afraid of them from the time, himself a lad of seventeen, when
Queen Anne, of Juneau, made open and ridiculous love to him.  For
that matter, he never had known women.  Born in a mining-camp
where they were rare and mysterious, having no sisters, his
mother dying while he was an infant, he had never been in contact
with them.  True, running away from Queen Anne, he had later
encountered them on the Yukon and cultivated an acquaintance with
them--the pioneer ones who crossed the passes on the trail of the
men who had opened up the first diggings.  But no lamb had ever
walked with a wolf in greater fear and trembling than had he
walked with them.  It was a matter of masculine pride that he
should walk with them, and he had done so in fair seeming; but
women had remained to him a closed book, and he preferred a game
of solo or seven-up any time.
<P>
And now, known as the King of the Klondike, carrying several
other royal titles, such as Eldorado King, Bonanza King, the
Lumber Baron, and the Prince of the Stampeders, not to omit the
proudest appellation of all, namely, the Father of the
Sourdoughs, he was more afraid of women than ever.  As never
before they held out their arms to him, and more women were
flocking into the country day by day.  It mattered not whether he
sat at dinner in the gold commissioner's house, called for the
drinks in a dancehall, or submitted to an interview from the
woman representative of the New York Sun, one and all of them
held out their arms.
<P>
There was one exception, and that was Freda, the girl that
danced, and to whom he had given the flour.  She was the only
woman in whose company he felt at ease, for she alone never
reached out her arms.  And yet it was from her that he was
destined to receive next to his severest fright.  It came about
in the fall of 1897.  He was returning from one of his dashes,
this time to inspect Henderson, a creek that entered the Yukon
just below the Stewart.  Winter had come on with a rush, and he
fought his way down the Yukon seventy miles in a frail
Peterborough canoe in the midst of a run of mush-ice.  Hugging
the rim-ice that had already solidly formed, he shot across the
ice-spewing mouth of the Klondike just in time to see a lone man
dancing excitedly on the rim and pointing into the water.  Next,
he saw the fur-clad body of a woman, face under, sinking in the
midst of the driving mush-ice.  A lane opening in the swirl of
the current, it was a matter of seconds to drive the canoe to the
spot, reach to the shoulder in the water, and draw the woman
gingerly to the canoe's side.  It was Freda.  And all might yet
have been well with him, had she not, later, when brought back to
consciousness, blazed at him with angry blue eyes and demanded:
"Why did you?  Oh, why did you?"
<P>
This worried him.  In the nights that followed, instead of
sinking immediately to sleep as was his wont, he lay awake,
visioning her face and that blue blaze of wrath, and conning her
words over and over.  They rang with sincerity.  The reproach was
genuine.  She had meant just what she said.  And still he
pondered.
<P>
The next time he encountered her she had turned away from him
angrily and contemptuously.  And yet again, she came to him to
beg his pardon, and she dropped a hint of a man somewhere,
sometime,--she said not how,--who had left her with no desire to
live.  Her speech was frank, but incoherent, and all he gleaned
from it was that the event, whatever it was, had happened years
before.  Also, he gleaned that she had loved the man.
<P>
That was the thing--love.  It caused the trouble.  It was more
terrible than frost or famine.  Women were all very well, in
themselves good to look upon and likable; but along came this
thing called love, and they were seared to the bone by it, made
so irrational that one could never guess what they would do next.
<P>
This Freda-woman was a splendid creature, full-bodied, beautiful,
and nobody's fool; but love had come along and soured her on the
world, driving her to the Klondike and to suicide so compellingly
that she was made to hate the man that saved her life.
<P>
Well, he had escaped love so far, just as he had escaped
smallpox; yet there it was, as contagious as smallpox, and a
whole lot worse in running its course.  It made men and women do
such fearful and unreasonable things.  It was like delirium
tremens, only worse.  And if he, Daylight, caught it, he might
have it as badly as any of them.  It was lunacy, stark lunacy,
and contagious on top of it all.  A half dozen young fellows were
crazy over Freda.  They all wanted to marry her.  Yet she, in
turn, was crazy over that some other fellow on the other side of
the world, and would have nothing to do with them.
<P>
But it was left to the Virgin to give him his final fright.  She
was found one morning dead in her cabin.  A shot through the head
had done it, and she had left no message, no explanation.  Then
came the talk.  Some wit, voicing public opinion, called it a
case of too much Daylight.  She had killed herself because of
him.  Everybody knew this, and said so.  The correspondents wrote
it up, and once more Burning Daylight, King of the Klondike, was
sensationally featured in the Sunday supplements of the United
States.  The Virgin had straightened up, so the feature-stories
ran, and correctly so.  Never had she entered a Dawson City
dance-hall.  When she first arrived from Circle City, she had
earned her living by washing clothes.  Next, she had bought a
sewing-machine and made men's drill parkas, fur caps, and
moosehide mittens.  Then she had gone as a clerk into the First
Yukon Bank.  All this, and more, was known and told, though one
and all were agreed that Daylight, while the cause, had been the
innocent cause of her untimely end.
<P>
And the worst of it was that Daylight knew it was true.  Always
would he remember that last night he had seen her.  He had
thought nothing of it at the time; but, looking back, he was
haunted by every little thing that had happened.  In the light of
the tragic event, he could understand everything--her quietness,
that calm certitude as if all vexing questions of living had been
smoothed out and were gone, and that certain ethereal sweetness
about all that she had said and done that had been almost
maternal.  He remembered the way she had looked at him, how she
had laughed when he narrated Mickey Dolan's mistake in staking
the fraction on Skookum Gulch.  Her laughter had been lightly
joyous, while at the same time it had lacked its oldtime
robustness.  Not that she had been grave or subdued.  On the
contrary, she had been so patently content, so filled with peace.
<P>
She had fooled him, fool that he was.  He had even thought that
night that her feeling for him had passed, and he had taken
delight in the thought, and caught visions of the satisfying
future friendship that would be theirs with this perturbing love
out of the way.
<P>
And then, when he stood at the door, cap in hand, and said good
night.  It had struck him at the time as a funny and embarrassing
thing, her bending over his hand and kissing it.  He had felt
like a fool, but he shivered now when he looked back on it and
felt again the touch of her lips on his hand.  She was saying
good-by, an eternal good-by, and he had never guessed.  At that
very moment, and for all the moments of the evening, coolly and
deliberately, as he well knew her way, she had been resolved to
die.  If he had only known it!  Untouched by the contagious
malady himself, nevertheless he would have married her if he had
had the slightest inkling of what she contemplated.  And yet he
knew, furthermore, that hers was a certain stiff-kneed pride that
would not have permitted her to accept marriage as an act of
philanthropy.  There had really been no saving her, after all. 
The love-disease had fastened upon her, and she had been doomed
from the first to perish of it.
<P>
Her one possible chance had been that he, too, should have caught
it.  And he had failed to catch it.  Most likely, if he had, it
would have been from Freda or some other woman.  There was
Dartworthy, the college man who had staked the rich fraction on
Bonanza above Discovery.  Everybody knew that old Doolittle's
daughter, Bertha, was madly in love with him.  Yet, when he
contracted the disease, of all women, it had been with the wife
of Colonel Walthstone, the great Guggenhammer mining expert. 
Result, three lunacy cases: Dartworthy selling out his mine for
one-tenth its value; the poor woman sacrificing her
respectability and sheltered nook in society to flee with him in
an open boat down the Yukon; and Colonel Walthstone, breathing
murder and destruction, taking out after them in another open
boat.  The whole impending tragedy had moved on down the muddy
Yukon, passing Forty Mile and Circle and losing itself in the
wilderness beyond.  But there it was, love, disorganizing men's
and women's lives, driving toward destruction and death, turning
topsy-turvy everything that was sensible and considerate, making
bawds or suicides out of virtuous women, and scoundrels and
murderers out of men who had always been clean and square.
<P>
For the first time in his life Daylight lost his nerve.  He was
badly and avowedly frightened.  Women were terrible creatures,
and the love-germ was especially plentiful in their neighborhood.
<P>
And they were so reckless, so devoid of fear.  THEY were not
frightened by what had happened to the Virgin.  They held out
their arms to him more seductively than ever.  Even without his
fortune, reckoned as a mere man, just past thirty, magnificently
strong and equally good-looking and good-natured, he was a prize
for most normal women.  But when to his natural excellences were
added the romance that linked with his name and the enormous
wealth that was his, practically every free woman he encountered
measured him with an appraising and delighted eye, to say nothing
of more than one woman who was not free.  Other men might have
been spoiled by this and led to lose their heads; but the only
effect on him was to increase his fright.  As a result he refused
most invitations to houses where women might be met, and
frequented bachelor boards and the Moosehorn Saloon, which had no
dance-hall attached.
