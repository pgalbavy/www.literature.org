<p>When the pursuing Apaches first fired their two shots, one of
them slightly wounded the hand of young Chadmund, while the other,
unsuspected by the lad, buried itself in the body of the mustang
and inflicted a fatal wound. It was characteristic of the noble
creature that his indomitable courage should remain to the last.
He kept up his astonishing speed until his rider voluntarily checked
him, and then his gait remained his natural one until nature succumbed
and he dropped dead.</p>

<p>It would be hard to say which emotion was the most poignant in
the breast of the young wanderer. He had learned to love the noble
mustang during their brief companionship, and he had discovered,
too, how impossible it was for him to make any substantial progress
without a good horse to ride. He had lost the best steed he had
ever bestrode, and was again thrown upon his own resources. It
was natural and creditable to the lad that, as he looked at the
fallen steed, and reflected how faithfully he had served him,
his hands should seek his eyes. So they did, and he spent full
ten minutes in a regular old-fashioned cry, such as he had not
enjoyed since receiving a good trouncing at the hands of his parent.</p>

<p>When his grief had subsided somewhat, he bade the unconscious
form good-bye, and with his rifle over his shoulder started ahead
again. He could not bear even to remove the blanket which was
strapped around the body of the mustang, and which was likely
to be of great service to him in his wanderings.</p>

<p>It was already growing dark, when he aimed for the hills, and,
as his eye swept over the the prairie, he saw no Indian or sign
of danger. He was hopeful that for the time being, at least, he
was free from molestation. His greatest trouble was, that he was
ravenously hungry again, and he counted upon considerable difficulty
in securing the wherewithal with which to satisfy his cravings.
True, he had gun and ammunition, but the game which he wished
to meet seemed to be, as a rule, reluctant to put itself within
his reach.</p>

<p>After reaching the hills, the lad's next proceeding was to hunt
up some suitable spot in which to pass the night. The air was
so warm and sultry that he could have made no use of the blanket,
had he possessed it. The place was full of stunted trees and undergrowth,
with jagged, irregular masses of stone lying here and there, and
constantly obtruding themselves in such a way that he received
a number of severe bruises.</p>

<p>After tramping about for a short time he discovered that the
hills were mainly in the form of a ridge, passing over the crest
of which he went down the opposite slope and found himself among
a mass of larger rocks, and in a still wilder section. There,
while searching, it occurred to him that he might find a suitable
retreat among the rocks. The sound of trickling water directed
his steps a little to the left, where a tiny rivulet was found
dripping down from the dark stones. After quenching his thirst
he renewed his hunt.</p>

<p>Although he continued for some time, he was not as successful
as he desired. Nothing in the shape of a regular cavern presented
itself, and he finally nestled down beside one of the largest
rocks which could be discovered, with the intention of sleeping
until morning.</p>

<p>Ned thought it strange that he should feel so frightened. With
the gathering of darkness he grew so nervous that all possibility
of sleep was driven away. He examined his rifle several times&mdash;a
curious mistrust taking possession of him&mdash;and then arose to his
feet and listened.</p>

<p>All seemed as quiet as at creation's morn. There was a soothing
influence in the faint sound of the dripping water, and an almost
inaudible roar seemed to steal forth from the great prairie, such
as is sometimes noted when in the vicinity of the becalmed ocean.
Without any thought he thrust his hand into an inner pocket, when
he felt a small package wrapped up in paper. Wondering what it
could be, he drew it forth.</p>

<p>It was a box of matches!</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered how they came there. On the day before
leaving Santa Fe it occurred to him that he would be likely to
need such a convenience, and he had carefully wrapped up a box
and placed it in this out-of-the-way corner, where it had lain
forgotten.</p>

<p>"That's lucky!" exclaimed the delighted lad, as he drew them
out, recognizing them more by the touch than by sight. "Now I'll
build a big fire, and fix things splendidly."</p>

<p>A fire was his great desideratum, and, had he believed it possible
without great trouble and work, he would have kindled one before
that. The capture of a new horse could have pleased him scarcely
more than the discovery of the matches, and he set about reaping
the advantage at once.</p>

<p>In such a place there was little difficulty in procuring fuel,
and it took Ned but a short time to gather all he could possibly
need; but, to guard against all contingencies, he continued collecting
until he had a huge pile, made up of dead limbs, branches, and
a number of green sticks thrown in. In a few minutes the flames
were under way. He had kindled them against the face of a rock,
and they burned with a cheery heartiness that did much to dispel
the gloom which had begun settling over him. He seated himself
as near the fire as he could without being made uncomfortable
by the reflected heat, and then he assumed as easy a position
as was possible in such a place.</p>

<p>"I wonder if anybody will see that?" he asked himself in a whisper,
after it had continued burning some time.</p>

<p>Rising and reconnoitering the ground, he was gratified to learn
that the light was better screened than he had reason to expect,
considering the carelessness with which he had kindled it. The
rock at the rear shut off all view from that direction, while
the undergrowth was so matted and dense in front, that it seemed
impossible for any one to see it from the prairie. Having made
this survey, he returned to his position, feeling much easier
in mind than before.</p>

<p>"Strange what has become of Dick and Tom," he muttered, following
up this train of thought, as usual whenever he was left undisturbed
for a few minutes. "Can it be that they have been killed by the
Apaches? It might be, and yet I don't know how it could happen,
either."</p>

<p>He was still meditating upon this ever-interesting query, when
he was roused to a sense of his situation by the sound of something
trampling through the bushes behind him.</p>

<p>"Indians!" he exclaimed, springing to his feet, rifle in hand,
and casting his terrified glance in the direction from whence
came the sound.</p>

<p>The words were yet in his mouth, when he felt that he had committed
a blunder. No Indian would approach in that manner.</p>

<p>"It must be some animal," was his conclusion, as he stepped back,
so as to bring himself as close to the fire as possible.</p>

<p>The next moment, a huge, dark, unwieldy body advanced from the
gloom with a growl, and he saw an immense grizzly bear lumbering
toward him. As quick as thought his rifle was at his shoulder,
and he fired full at him, the distance being so short that he
could not fail to hit the mark; but the wound, however severe
it might have been, was not fatal, and did not deter bruin's advance
in the least. Knowing that it would be sure death if he were once
seized by the powerful monster, and aware of the dread which all
animals have of fire, he dropped his gun and caught up a blazing
brand, which he flung in the very face of the brute.</p>

<p>This was more than a bear, as courageous as was this giant grizzly,
could stand, and he retreated with an awkward haste which was
ridiculous. For the instant he was panic stricken, and continued
falling back until he was invisible in the gloom. But he was not
disposed to give up the contest by any means. Ned knew he would
be back again, and fortified himself as well as possible by hugging
his own camp fire, stooping down and holding himself ready to
hurl another torch in the brute's face if he should persevere
in his attack.</p>

<p>For several minutes all was quiet, and he began to hope that
his fright was such that he would keep at a respectful distance.
Such was not the case, however. A growl from another direction
warned him that the brute was about to advance from that quarter.
The lad peered out into the gloom, wondering whether the creature
would eventually overcome his dread to such an extent as to press
him to the wall. At any rate, he was not disposed to wait and
hastily ran around to the other side of the blaze, by which maneuver
it was interposed directly between him and his enemy.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he will do now?"</p>
