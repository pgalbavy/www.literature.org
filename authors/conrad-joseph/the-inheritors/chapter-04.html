<p><em>FOUR</em></p>

<p>I went up to town bearing the Callan article, and a letter of
warm commendation from Callan to Fox. I had been very docile;
had accepted emendations; had lavished praise, had been unctuous
and yet had contrived to retain the dignified savour of the editorial
"we." Callan himself asked no more.</p>

<p>I was directed to seek Fox out&mdash;to find him immediately. The
matter was growing urgent. Fox was not at the office&mdash;the brand
new office that I afterward saw pass through the succeeding stages
of business-like comfort and dusty neglect. I was directed to
ask for him at the stage door of the Buckingham.</p>

<p>I waited in the doorkeeper's glass box at the Buckingham. I was
eyed by the suspicious commissionaire with the contempt reserved
for resting actors. Resting actors are hungry suppliants as a
rule. Call-boys sought Mr. Fox. "Anybody seen Mr. Fox? He's gone
to lunch."</p>

<p>"Mr. Fox is out," said the commissionaire.</p>

<p>I explained that the matter was urgent. More call-boys disappeared
through the folding doors. Unenticing personages passed the glass
box, casting hostile glances askance at me on my high stool. A
message came back.</p>

<p>"If it's Mr. Etchingham Granger, he's to follow Mr. Fox to Mrs.
Hartly's at once."</p>

<p>I followed Mr. Fox to Mrs. Hartly's&mdash;to a little flat in a neighbourhood
that I need not specify. The eminent journalist was lunching with
the eminent actress. A husband was in attendance&mdash;a nonentity
with a heavy yellow moustache, who hummed and hawed over his watch.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox was full-faced, with a persuasive, peremptory manner.
Mrs. Hartly was&mdash;well, she was just Mrs. Hartly. You remember
how we all fell in love with her figure and her manner, and her
voice, and the way she used her hands. She broke her bread with
those very hands; spoke to her husband with that very voice, and
rose from table with that same graceful management of her limp
skirts. She made eyes at me; at her husband; at little Fox, at
the man who handed the asparagus&mdash;great round grey eyes. She was
just the same. The curtain never fell on that eternal dress rehearsal.
I don't wonder the husband was forever looking at his watch.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox was a friend of the house. He dispensed with ceremony,
read my manuscript over his Roquefort, and seemed to find it add
to the savour.</p>

<p>"You are going to do me for Mr. Fox," Mrs. Hartly said, turning
her large grey eyes upon me. They were very soft. They seemed
to send out waves of intense sympatheticism. I thought of those
others that had shot out a razor-edged ray.</p>

<p>"Why," I answered, "there was some talk of my doing somebody
for the <em>Hour</em>."</p>

<p>Fox put my manuscript under his empty tumbler.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, sharply. "He will do, I think. H'm, yes. Why,
yes."</p>

<p>"You're a friend of Mr. Callan's, aren't you?" Mrs. Hartly asked,
"What a dear, nice man he is! You should see him at rehearsals.
You know I'm doing his 'Boldero'; he's given me a perfectly lovely
part&mdash;perfectly lovely. And the trouble he takes. He tries every
chair on the stage."</p>

<p>"H'm; yes," Fox interjected, "he likes to have his own way."</p>

<p>"We <em>all</em> like that," the great actress said. She was
quoting from her first great part. I thought&mdash;but, perhaps, I
was mistaken&mdash;that all her utterances were quotations from her
first great part. Her husband looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Are you coming to this confounded flower show?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, turning her mysterious eyes upon him, "I'll
go and get ready."</p>

<p>She disappeared through an inner door. I expected to hear the
pistol-shot and the heavy fall from the next room. I forgot that
it was not the end of the fifth act.</p>

<p>Fox put my manuscript into his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"Come along, Granger," he said to me, "I want to speak to you.
You'll have plenty of opportunity for seeing Mrs. Hartly, I expect.
She's tenth on your list. Good-day, Hartly."</p>

<p>Hartly's hand was wavering between his moustache and his watch
pocket.</p>

<p>"Good-day," he said sulkily.</p>

<p>"You must come and see me again, Mr. Granger," Mrs. Hartly said
from the door. "Come to the Buckingham and see how we're getting
on with your friend's play. We must have a good long talk if you're
to get my local colour, as Mr. Fox calls it."</p>

<p>   "To gild refined gold; to paint the lily,    To throw a perfume
on the violet&mdash;"</p>

<p>I quoted banally.</p>

<p>"That's it," she said, with a tender smile. She was fastening
a button in her glove. I doubt her recognition of the quotation.</p>

<p>When we were in our hansom, Fox began:</p>

<p>"I'm relieved by what I've seen of your copy. One didn't expect
this sort of thing from you. You think it a bit below you, don't
you? Oh, I know, I know. You literary people are usually so impracticable;
you know what I mean. Callan said you were the man. Callan has
his uses; but one has something else to do with one's paper. I've
got interests of my own. But you'll do; it's all <em>right</em>.
You don't mind my being candid, do you, now?" I muttered that
I rather liked it.</p>

<p>"Well then," he went on, "now I see my way."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you do," I murmured. "I wish I did."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will be all right," Fox comforted. "I dare say Callan
has rather sickened you of the job; particularly if you ain't
used to it. But you won't find the others as trying. There's Churchill
now, he's your next. You'll have to mind him. You'll find him
a decent chap. Not a bit of side on him."</p>

<p>"What Churchill?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The Foreign Minister."</p>

<p>"The devil," I said.</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll find him all right," Fox reassured; "you're to go
down to his place to-morrow. It's all arranged. Here we are. Hop
out." He suited his own action to his words and ran nimbly up
the new terra-cotta steps of the <em>Hour's</em> home. He left
me to pay the cabman.</p>

<p>When I rejoined him he was giving directions to an invisible
somebody through folding doors.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said, breathlessly. "Can't see him," he added
to a little boy, who held a card in his hands. "Tell him to go
to Mr. Evans. One's life isn't one's own here," he went on, when
he had reached his own room.</p>

<p>It was a palatial apartment furnished in white and gold &mdash;Louis
Quinze, or something of the sort&mdash;with very new decorations after
Watteau covering the walls. The process of disfiguration, however,
had already begun. A roll desk of the least possible Louis Quinze
order stood in one of the tall windows; the carpet was marked
by muddy footprints, and a matchboard screen had been run across
one end of the room.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Evans," Fox shouted across it, "just see that man from
Grant's, will you? Heard from the Central News yet?"</p>

<p>He was looking through the papers on the desk.</p>

<p>"Not yet, I've just rung them up for the fifth time," the answer
came.</p>

<p>"Keep on at it," Fox exhorted.</p>

<p>"Here's Churchill's letter," he said to me. "Have an arm-chair;
those blasted things are too uncomfortable for anything. Make
yourself comfortable. I'll be back in a minute."</p>

<p>I took an arm-chair and addressed myself to the Foreign Minister's
letter. It expressed bored tolerance of a potential interviewer,
but it seemed to please Fox. He ran into the room, snatched up
a paper from his desk, and ran out again.</p>

<p>"Read Churchill's letter?" he asked, in passing. "I'll tell you
all about it in a minute." I don't know what he expected me to
do with it&mdash;kiss the postage stamp, perhaps.</p>

<p>At the same time, it was pleasant to sit there idle in the midst
of the hurry, the breathlessness. I seemed to be at last in contact
with real life, with the life that matters. I was somebody, too.
Fox treated me with a kind of deference&mdash;as if I were a great
unknown. His "you literary men" was pleasing. It was the homage
that the pretender pays to the legitimate prince; the recognition
due to the real thing from the machine-made imitation; the homage
of the builder to the architect.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," it seemed to say, "we jobbing men run up our rows
and rows of houses; build whole towns and fill the papers for
years. But when we want something special&mdash;something monumental&mdash;we
have to come to you."</p>

<p>Fox came in again.</p>

<p>"Very sorry, my dear fellow, find I can't possibly get a moment
for a chat with you. Look here, come and dine with me at the Paragraph
round the corner&mdash;to-night at six sharp. You'll go to Churchill's
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The Paragraph Club, where I was to meet Fox, was one of those
sporadic establishments that spring up in the neighbourhood of
the Strand. It is one of their qualities that they are always
just round the corner; another, that their stewards are too familiar;
another, that they&mdash;in the opinion of the other members&mdash;are run
too much for the convenience of one in particular.</p>

<p>In this case it was Fox who kept the dinner waiting. I sat in
the little smoking-room and, from behind a belated morning paper,
listened to the conversation of the three or four journalists
who represented the members. I felt as a new boy in a new school
feels on his first introduction to his fellows.</p>

<p>There was a fossil dramatic critic sleeping in an arm-chair before
the fire. At dinner-time he woke up, remarked:</p>

<p>"You should have seen Fanny Ellsler," and went to sleep again.</p>

<p>Sprawling on a red velvet couch was a <em>beau jeune homme</em>,
with the necktie of a Parisian-American student. On a chair beside
him sat a personage whom, perhaps because of his plentiful lack
of h's, I took for a distinguished foreigner.</p>

<p>They were talking about a splendid subject for a music-hall dramatic
sketch of some sort&mdash;afforded by a bus driver, I fancy.</p>

<p>I heard afterward that my Frenchman had been a costermonger and
was now half journalist, half financier, and that my art student
was an employee of one of the older magazines.</p>

<p>"Dinner's on the table, gents," the steward said from the door.
He went toward the sleeper by the fire. "I expect Mr. Cunningham
will wear that arm-chair out before he's done," he said over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Poor old chap; he's got nowhere else to go to," the magazine
employee said.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he go to the work'ouse," the journalist financier
retorted. "Make a good sketch that, eh?" he continued, reverting
to his bus-driver.</p>

<p>"Jolly!" the magazine employee said, indifferently.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Mr. Cunningham," the steward said, touching the sleeper
on the shoulder, "dinner's on the table."</p>

<p>"God bless my soul," the dramatic critic said, with a start.
The steward left the room. The dramatic critic furtively took
a set of false teeth out of his waistcoat pocket; wiped them with
a bandanna handkerchief, and inserted them in his mouth.</p>

<p>He tottered out of the room.</p>

<p>I got up and began to inspect the pen-and-ink sketches on the
walls.</p>

<p>The faded paltry caricatures of faded paltry lesser lights that
confronted me from fly-blown frames on the purple walls almost
made me shiver.</p>

<p>"There you are, Granger," said a cheerful voice behind me. "Come
and have some dinner."</p>

<p>I went and had some dinner. It was seasoned by small jokes and
little personalities. A Teutonic journalist, a musical critic,
I suppose, inquired as to the origin of the meagre pheasant. Fox
replied that it had been preserved in the back-yard. The dramatic
critic mumbled unheard that some piece or other was off the bills
of the Adelphi. I grinned vacantly. Afterward, under his breath,
Fox put me up to a thing or two regarding the inner meaning of
the new daily. Put by him, without any glamour of a moral purpose,
the case seemed rather mean. The dingy smoking-room depressed
me and the whole thing was, what I had, for so many years, striven
to keep out of. Fox hung over my ear, whispering. There were shades
of intonation in his sibillating. Some of those "in it," the voice
implied, were not above-board; others were, and the tone became
deferential, implied that I was to take my tone from itself.</p>

<p>"Of course, a man like the Right Honourable C. does it on the
straight, ... quite on the straight, ... has to have some sort
of semi-official backer.... In this case, it's me, ... the <em>Hour</em>.
They're a bit splitty, the Ministry, I mean.... They say Gurnard
isn't playing square ... they <em>say</em> so." His broad, red
face glowed as he bent down to my ear, his little sea-blue eyes
twinkled with moisture. He enlightened me cautiously, circumspectly.
There was something unpleasant in the business&mdash;not exactly in
Fox himself, but the kind of thing. I wish he would cease his
explanations &mdash;I didn't want to hear them. I have never wanted
to know how things are worked; preferring to take the world at
its face value. Callan's revelations had been bearable, because
of the farcical pompousness of his manner. But this was different,
it had the stamp of truth, perhaps because it was a little dirty.
I didn't want to hear that the Foreign Minister was ever so remotely
mixed up in this business. He was only a symbol to me, but he
stood for the stability of statesmanship and for the decencies
that it is troublesome to have touched.</p>

<p>"Of course," he was proceeding, "the Churchill gang would like
to go on playing the stand-off to us. But it won't do, they've
got to come in or see themselves left. Gurnard has pretty well
nobbled their old party press, so they've got to begin all over
again."</p>

<p>That was it&mdash;that was precisely it. Churchill ought to have played
the stand-off to people like us&mdash;to have gone on playing it at
whatever cost. That was what I demanded of the world as I conceived
it. It was so much less troublesome in that way. On the other
hand, this was life &mdash;I was living now and the cost of living
is disillusionment; it was the price I had to pay. Obviously,
a Foreign Minister had to have a semi-official organ, or I supposed
so.... "Mind you," Fox whispered on, "I think myself, that it's
a pity he is supporting the Greenland business. The thing's not
<em>altogether</em> straight. But it's going to be made to pay
like hell, and there's the national interest to be considered.
If this Government didn't take it up, some other would&mdash;and that
would give Gurnard and a lot of others a peg against Churchill
and his. We can't afford to lose any more coaling stations in
Greenland or anywhere else. And, mind you, Mr. C. can look after
the interests of the niggers a good deal better if he's a hand
in the pie. You see the position, eh?"</p>

<p>I wasn't actually listening to him, but I nodded at proper intervals.
I knew that he wanted me to take that line in confidential conversations
with fellows seeking copy. I was quite resigned to that. Incidentally,
I was overcome by the conviction&mdash;perhaps it was no more than
a sensation&mdash;that that girl was mixed up in this thing, that her
shadow was somewhere among the others flickering upon the sheet.
I wanted to ask Fox if he knew her. But, then, in that absurd
business, I did not even know her name, and the whole story would
have sounded a little mad. Just now, it suited me that Fox should
have a moderate idea of my sanity. Besides, the thing was out
of tone, I idealised her then. One wouldn't talk about her in
a smoking-room full of men telling stories, and one wouldn't talk
about her at all to Fox.</p>

<p>The musical critic had been prowling about the room with Fox's
eyes upon him. He edged suddenly nearer, pushed a chair aside,
and came toward us.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he said, in an ostentatiously genial, after-dinner voice,
"what are you two chaps a-talking about?"</p>

<p>"Private matters," Fox answered, without moving a hair.</p>

<p>"Then I suppose I'm in the way?" the other muttered. Fox did
not answer.</p>

<p>"Wants a job," he said, watching the discomfited Teuton's retreat,
"but, as I was saying&mdash;oh, it pays both ways." He paused and fixed
his eyes on me. He had been explaining the financial details of
the matter, in which the Duc de Mersch and Callan and Mrs. Hartly
and all these people clubbed together and started a paper which
they hired Fox to run, which was to bring their money back again,
which was to scratch their backs, which.... It was like the house
that Jack built; I wondered who Jack was. That was it, who was
Jack? It all hinged upon that.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," I said. "It seems rather neat."</p>

<p>"Of course," Fox wandered on, "you are wondering why the deuce
I tell you all this. Fact is, you'd hear it all if I didn't, and
a good deal more that isn't true besides. But I believe you're
the sort of chap to respect a confidence."</p>

<p>I didn't rise to the sentiment. I knew as well as he did that
he was bamboozling me, that he was, as he said, only telling me&mdash;not
the truth, but just what I should hear everywhere. I did not bear
him any ill-will; it was part of the game, that. But the question
was, who was Jack? It might be Fox himself.... There might, after
all, be some meaning in the farrago of nonsense that that fantastic
girl had let off upon me. Fox really and in a figure of speech
such as she allowed herself, might be running a team consisting
of the Duc de Mersch and Mr. Churchill.</p>
