<p>Esteban Miranda, clinging tightly to the wrist of little Uhha, crouched
in the darkness of another forest twenty miles away and trembled as the
thunderous notes of another lion reverberated through the jungle.
</p>
<p>The girl felt the trembling of the body of the big man at her side and
turned contemptuously upon him.
</p><p>"You are not The River Devil!" she cried. "You are afraid. You are not
even Tarzan, for Khamis, my father, has told me that Tarzan is afraid
of nothing. Let me go that I may climb a tree--only a coward or a fool
would stand here dead with terror waiting for the lion to come and
devour him. Let me go, I say!" and she attempted to wrench her wrist
free from his grasp.
</p><p>"Shut up!" he hissed. "Do you want to attract the lion to us?" But her
words and struggles had aroused him from his paralysis and stooping he
seized her and lifted her until she could grasp the lower branches of
the tree beneath which they stood. Then, as she clambered to safety, he
swung himself easily to her side.
</p><p>Presently, higher up among the branches, he found a safer and more
comfortable resting place, and there the two settled down to await the
coming of the dawn, while below them Numa the lion prowled for a while,
coughing and grunting, and occasionally voicing a deep roar that shook
the jungle.
</p><p>When daylight came at last the two, exhausted by a sleepless night,
slipped to the ground. The girl would have delayed, hoping that the
warriors of Obebe might overtake them; but the man harbored a fear
rather than a hope of the same contingency and was, therefore, for
hastening on as rapidly as possible that he might put the greatest
possible distance between himself and the black, cannibal chief.
</p><p>He was completely lost, having not the remotest idea of where he should
search for a reasonably good trail to the coast, nor, at present,
did he care; his one wish being to escape recapture by Obebe, and
so he elected to move northward, keeping always an eye open for any
indication of a well-marked trail toward the west. Eventually, he
hoped, he might discover a village of friendly natives who would aid
him upon his journey toward the coast, and so the two moved as rapidly
as they could in a northerly direction, their way skirting The Great
Thorn Forest along the eastern edge of which they traveled.
</p>
<p>The sun beating down upon the hot corral of The First Woman found it
deserted of life. Only the corpse of a youth lay sprawled where it had
fallen the previous evening. A speck appeared in the distant blue. It
grew larger as it approached until it took upon itself the form of a
bird gliding easily upon motionless wings. Nearer and nearer it came,
now and again winging great, slow circles, until at last it swung above
the corral of The First Woman. Once again it circled and then dropped
to earth within the enclosure--Ska, the vulture, had come. Within the
hour the body of the youth was hidden by a mantle of the great birds.
It was a two days feast, and when they left, only the clean picked
bones remained, and entangled about the neck of one of the birds was
a golden chain from which depended a diamond encrusted locket. Ska
fought the bauble that swung annoyingly beneath him when he flew and
impeded his progress when he walked upon the ground, but it was looped
twice about his neck and he was unable to dislodge it, and so he winged
away across The Great Thorn Forest, the bright gems gleaming and
scintillating in the sun.
</p>
<p>Tarzan of the Apes, after eluding the women that had chased him and
the Alalus youth into the forest, halted in the tree beneath which the
frightened son of The First Woman had come to a terrified pause. He
was there, close above him, when Numa charged, and reaching quickly
down had seized the youth by the hair and dragged him to safety as the
lion's raking talons embraced thin air beneath the feet of the Alalus.
</p><p>The following day the ape-man concerned himself seriously in the hunt
for food, weapons and apparel. Naked and unarmed as he was it might
have gone hard with him had he been other than Tarzan of the Apes, and
it had gone hard, too, with the Alalus had it not been for the ape-man.
Fruits and nuts Tarzan found, and birds' eggs, but he craved meat and
for meat he hunted assiduously, not alone because of the flesh of the
kill, but for the skin and the gut and the tendons, that he could use
in the fabrication of the things he required for the safety and comfort
of his primitive existence.
</p><p>As he searched for the spoor of his prey he searched also for the
proper woods for a spear and for bow and arrows, nor were they
difficult to find in this forest of familiar trees, but the day was
almost done before the gentle wind, up which he had been hunting,
carried to his sensitive nostrils the scent spoor of Bara the deer.
</p><p>Swinging into a tree he motioned the Alalus to follow him, but so inept
and awkward was the creature that Tarzan was compelled to drag him to
a place among the branches, where, by signs, he attempted to impart to
him the fact that he wished him to remain where he was, watching the
materials that the ape-man had collected for his weapons, while the
latter continued the hunt alone.
</p><p>That the youth understood him he was not at all sure, but at least he
did not follow when Tarzan swung off silently through the branches
of the forest along the elusive trail of the ruminant, the scent of
which was always translated to the foster son of Kala the she-ape as
Bara the deer, though in fact, as practically always, the animal was
an antelope. But strong are the impressions of childhood and since
that long gone day upon which he had pored over the colored alphabet
primer in the far-off cabin of his dead father beside the land-locked
harbor on the West Coast, and learned that "D stands for Deer," and
had admired the picture of the pretty animal, the thing that most
closely resembled it, with which he was familiar in his daily life, the
antelope, became for him then, and always remained, Bara the deer.
</p><p>To approach sufficiently close to Bara to bring him down with spear or
arrow requires cunning and woodcraft far beyond the limited range of
civilized man's ability. The native hunter loses more often than he
wins in this game of wits and percipience. Tarzan, however, must excel
them both and the antelope, too, in the keenness of his perceptive
faculties and in coordination of mind and muscles if he were to lay
Bara low with only the weapons with which nature had endowed him.
</p><p>As Tarzan sped silently through the jungle, guided by his nostrils,
in the direction of Bara the deer increasing strength of the familiar
effluvium apprised him that not far ahead Bara foregathered in numbers,
and the mouth of the savage ape-man watered in anticipation of the
feast that but awaited his coming. And as the strength of the scent
increased, more warily went the great beast, moving silently, a shadow
among the shadows of the forest, until he came at last to the verge of
an opening in which he saw a dozen antelope grazing.
</p><p>Squatting motionless upon a low hanging limb the ape-man watched the
movements of the herd against the moment that one might come close
enough to the encircling trees to give a charge at least a shadow of
a chance for success. To wait patiently, oftentimes hour upon hour,
for the quarry to expose itself to more certain death is a part of the
great game that the hunters of the wild must play. A single ill-timed
or thoughtless movement may send the timorous prey scampering off into
the far distance from which they may not return for days.
</p><p>To avoid this Tarzan remained in statuesque immobility waiting for
chance to send one of the antelope within striking distance, and while
he waited there came to his nostrils, faintly, the scent of Numa the
lion. Tarzan scowled. He was down wind from Bara and the lion was not
between him and the antelope. It must, therefore, be up wind from the
quarry as well as from himself; but why had not the sensitive nostrils
of the Herbivora caught the scent of their arch-enemy before it had
reached the ape-man; that they had not was evidenced by their placidity
as they grazed contentedly, their tails switching and occasionally a
head raised to look about with up-pricked ears though with no symptom
of the terror that would immediately follow the discovery of Numa in
their vicinity.
</p><p>The ape-man concluded that one of those freaks of the air currents that
so often leaves a motionless pocket of air directly in the path of
the flow had momentarily surrounded the antelope, insulating them, as
it were, from their immediate surroundings. And while he was thinking
these things and wishing that Numa would go away he was shocked to
hear a sudden crashing in the underbrush upon the opposite side of the
clearing beyond the antelope, who were instantly upon the alert and
poised for flight. Almost simultaneously there broke into view a young
lion which, upon coming in sight of the antelope, set up a terrific
roaring as it charged. Tarzan could have torn his hair in rage and
disappointment. The blundering stupidity of a young lion had robbed him
of his meat--the ruminants were scattering in all directions. The lion,
charging futilely, had lost his own meat and Tarzan's, too; but wait!
what was this? A terrified buck, blind to all save the single thought
of escape from the talons of the dread carnivore, was bolting straight
for the tree in which Tarzan sat. As it came beneath him a sleek brown
body shot head-foremost from the foliage, steel fingers gripped the
throat of the buck, strong teeth fastened in its neck. The weight of
the savage hunter carried the quarry to its knees and before it could
stumble to its feet again a quick wrench with those powerful hands had
twisted and broken its neck.
</p><p>Without a backward glance the ape-man threw the carcass to his shoulder
and leaped into the nearest tree. He had no need to waste time in
looking back to know what Numa would be doing, for he realized that he
had leaped upon Bara full in the sight of the king of beasts. Scarce
had he drawn himself to safety ere the great cat crashed across the
spot where he had stood.
</p><p>Numa, baffled, roared terribly as he returned to glare up at the
ape-man perched above him. Tarzan smiled.
</p><p>"Son of Dango, the hyena," he taunted, "go hungry until you learn to
hunt," and casting a broken branch contemptuously in the lion's face
the ape-man vanished among the leafy branches bearing his kill lightly
across one broad shoulder.
</p><p>It was still daylight when Tarzan returned to where the Alalus was
awaiting him. The youth had a small stone knife and with this the
ape-man hacked off a generous portion of the antelope for the whelp of
The First Woman and another for himself. Into the raw flesh, hungrily,
sank the strong white teeth of the English lord, while the Alalus
youth, gazing at him in surprise, sought materials for fire making.
Amused, Tarzan watched him until the other had succeeded in preparing
his food as he thought it should be prepared--the outside burned to a
cinder, the inside raw, yet it was cooked food and doubtless imparted
to its partaker a feeling of great superiority over the low beasts that
devoured their meat raw, just as though he had been a civilized epicure
eating decaying game and putrid cheeses at some fashionable club in
London.
</p><p>Tarzan smiled as he thought how vague, after all, the line that
separates primitive from civilized man in matters pertaining to their
instincts and their appetites. Some of his French friends, with whom
he was dining upon a certain occasion, were horrified when they
learned that in common with many of the African tribes and the apes he
ate caterpillars, and they voiced their horror between mouthfuls of
the snails they were eating with relish at the time. The provincial
American scoffs at the French for eating frogs' legs, the while he
munches upon the leg of a pig! The Esquimaux eat raw blubber, the
Amazonians, both white and native, eat the contents of the stomachs of
parrots and monkeys and consider them delicacies, the Chinese coolie
asks not how his meat came by its death, nor how long since, and there
is a man in New York, an estimable and otherwise harmless man, who eats
Limburger cheese on Bartlett pears.
</p><p>The following day, with sufficient meat to last them several days,
Tarzan set to work upon his weapons and his loin cloth. Showing the
Alalus how to scrape the antelope hide with his stone knife, the
ape-man set to work, with nothing more in the way of tools than bits of
stone picked from the bed of a stream, to fashion weapons with which
to cope successfully with the Alali women, the great carnivores and
whatever other enemies time might reveal to him.
</p><p>And as he worked he watched the Alalus youth and wondered of what
use the poor creature could be to him in finding his way through the
encircling thorn forest that he must pass to reach familiar country and
the trail for home. That the poor thing was timid had been evidenced
by its manner when fleeing from the Alali women and its terror when
confronted by Numa. Its speechlessness made it useless as a companion
and it was entirely without woodcraft other than a certain crude,
instinctive kind that was of no use to Tarzan. But it had placed itself
at his side during the altercation in the corral and although it
could not have been of any help to him yet it had won a right to his
consideration by its act. Moreover it was evident, quite evident, that
the creature had attached itself to Tarzan and intended to remain with
him.
</p><p>An idea occurred to Tarzan as he worked upon his weapons and thought
upon the Alalus--he would make similar weapons for the youth and teach
him how to use them. He had seen that the crude weapons of the Alali
would be no match against one armed with a bow and arrows, or even a
good spear. Accurately they could not hope to throw their missiles as
far as a good bowman could speed his shaft and their bludgeons were
helpless in the face of a well thrown spear.
</p><p>Yes, he would make weapons for the youth and train him in their use and
then he could be made of service in the hunt and, if necessary, in the
fight, and as Tarzan of the Apes thought upon the matter the Alalus
suddenly paused in his work and bent an ear close to the ground, then
he lifted his head and turned his eyes upon Tarzan, pointing at him,
at his ear, and then at the ground. The ape-man understood that he
was to listen as the other had and when he did so he distinctly heard
approaching footsteps resounding upon a hard worn trail.
</p><p>Gathering up his belongings he carried them high among the trees to a
safe cache with the remnants of Bara the deer and then returning helped
the youth into the tree beside him. Slowly, already, the Alalus was
becoming more at ease in the trees and could help himself to a greater
extent in climbing into them, but he was still practically helpless in
Tarzan's estimation.
</p><p>The two had not long to wait before there swung down the trail one
of the terrible women of the amphitheater, and behind her at ten or
fifteen paces another, and behind the second a third. It was not often
that they traveled thus, for theirs was a solitary existence, the Alali
being almost devoid of gregarious instincts, yet they did occasionally
start out upon their hunts together, especially when they were hunting
some dangerous beast that had encroached upon their rights, or when,
failing to collect sufficient men from the forest during the mating
season, the unfortunate ones banded together to make a raid upon the
corrals of a neighboring tribe.
</p><p>The three, slouching along the trail, passed directly beneath the tree
from which Tarzan and the youth watched them. The great, flat ears
flapped lazily, the dark eyes wandered from side to side, and from time
to time they moved rapidly the skin upon some portions of their bodies
as they sought to dislodge annoying insects.
</p><p>The two in the tree remained motionless while the three brute-women
passed along down the trail to be presently lost to their view at
a turning of the forest highway, then, after a short interval of
listening, they descended to the ground and resumed their interrupted
labors. The ape-man smiled as he idly pondered the events of the past
few minutes--Tarzan of the Apes, Lord of the Jungle, hiding among
the trees to escape the notice of three women! But such women! He
knew little about them or their ways as yet, but what he did know was
sufficient to convince him that they were as formidable foes as ever he
had encountered and that while he remained weaponless he was no match
against their great bludgeons and swift-thrown missiles.
</p><p>The days passed; the ape-man and his silent companion perfected the
weapons that would more easily give them food, the latter working
mechanically, following the instructions of his master, until at last
the time came when Tarzan and the Alalus were fully equipped and then
they hunted together, the man training the youth in the use of bow and
spear and the long grass rope that from boyhood had formed a unique
feature of the ape-man's armament.
</p><p>During these days of hunting there came over the Alalus youth, quite
suddenly, a great change. It had been his habit to glide stealthily
through the forest, stopping often to look this way and that, fearful,
apparently, of every creature that roamed the shadowed trails; his one
great fear the ferocious females of his kind; but suddenly all this
changed as by magic. Slowly he was mastering the bow and the spear;
with deep interest and a sense of awe and respect he had watched
Tarzan bring down many animals, great and small, for food, and once he
had seen him dispatch Sabor the lioness with a single thrust of his
great spear when Sabor had caught the ape-man in a clearing too far
from the sanctuary of his beloved trees, and then his own day came.
He and Tarzan were hunting when the former disturbed a small herd of
wild pigs, bringing down two with his arrows. The others scattered in
all directions and one of these, a boar, sighting the Alalus, charged
him. The youth was of a mind to flee, for ages of inherited instinct
prompted him to flight. Always the male Alalus fled from danger, and
between fleeing from carnivorous animals and from their own women they
had become very swift, so swift that no dangerous enemy could overtake
them--an Alalus man could be captured only by craft. He could have
escaped the boar by flight and for an instant he was upon the verge of
flight, but a sudden thought checked him--back flew his spear hand as
the ape-man had taught him and then forward with all the weight of his
body behind the cast. The boar was coming straight for him. The spear
struck in front of the left shoulder and ranged downward through the
heart. Horta the boar dropped in his tracks.
</p><p>A new expression came into the eyes and spread over the countenance
of the Alalus. He no longer wore that hunted expression; he no longer
slunk through the forest casting fearful glances from side to side.
Now he walked erect, boldly and with fearless mien, and, perhaps,
instead of dreading the appearance of a female he rather courted the
event. He was the personification of avenging manhood. Within him
rankled countless ages of contemptuous treatment and abuse at the hands
of his shes. Doubtless he never thought of the matter in this way at
all, but the fact remained, and Tarzan realized it, that the first
woman unfortunate enough to stumble upon this youth was going to get
the surprise of her life.
</p><p>And while Tarzan and the Alalus roamed the strange land hemmed in by
The Great Thorn Forest and the ape-man sought for an avenue of escape,
Esteban Miranda and little Uhha, daughter of Khamis the witch doctor,
wandered along the forest's outer verge in search of a trail toward the
west and the coast.
