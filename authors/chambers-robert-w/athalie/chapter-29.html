<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Spring ploughing had been proceeding for some time now, but Athalie
did not feel equal to walking cross-lots over ploughed ground,
so she let Clive go alone on tours of inspection.</p>

<p>But these absences were brief; he did not care to remain away
from Athalie for more than an hour at a time. So, T. Phelan ploughed
on, practically unmolested and untormented by questions, suggestions,
and advice. Which liberty was to his liking. And he loafed much.</p>

<p>In these latter days of May Athalie spent a great deal of her
time among her cushions and wraps on the garden seat near the
fountain. On his return from prowling about the farm Clive was
sure to find her there, reading or sewing, or curled up among
her cushions in the sun with Hafiz purring on her lap.</p>

<p>And she would look up at Clive out of sleepy, humorous eyes in
which glimmered a smile of greeting, or she would pretend surprise
and disapproval at his long absence of half an hour with: "Well,
C. Bailey, Junior! Where do <em>you</em> come from now?"</p>

<p>The phases of awakening spring in the garden seemed to be an
endless source of pleasure to the girl; she would sit for hours
looking at the pale lilac-tinted wistaria clusters hanging over
the naked wall and watching plundering bumble-bees scrambling
from blossom to blossom.</p>

<p>And when at the base of the wall, the spiked buds of silvery-grey
iris unfolded, and their delicate fragrance filled the air, the
exquisite mingling of the two odours and the two shades of mauve
thrilled her as no perfume, no colour had ever affected her.</p>

<p>The little colonies of lily-of-the-valley came into delicate
bloom under the fringing shrubbery; golden bell flower, pink and
vermilion cydonia, roses, all bloomed and had their day; lilac
bushes were weighted with their heavy, dewy clusters; the sweet-brier's
green tracery grew into tender leaf and its matchless perfume
became apparent when the sun fell hot.</p>

<p>In the warm air there seemed to brood the exquisite hesitation
of happy suspense,&mdash;a delicious and breathless sense of waiting
for something still more wonderful to come.</p>

<p>And when Athalie felt it stealing over her she looked at Clive
and knew that he also felt it. Then her slim hand would steal
into his and nestle there, content, fearless, blissfully confident
of what was to be.</p>

<p>But it was subtly otherwise with Clive. Once or twice she felt
his hand tremble slightly as though a slight shiver had passed
over him; and when again she noticed it she asked him why.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he said in a strained voice; "I am very, very happy."</p>

<p>"I know it.... There is no fear mingling with your happiness;
is there, Clive?"</p>

<p>But before he replied she knew that it was so.</p>

<p>"Dearest," she murmured, "dearest! You must not be afraid for
me."</p>

<p>And suddenly the long pent fears strangled him; he could not
speak; and she felt his lips, hot and tremulous against her hand.</p>

<p>"My heart!" she whispered, "all will go well. There is absolutely
no reason for you to be afraid."</p>

<p>"Do you <em>know</em> it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I <em>know</em> it. I am certain of it, darling. Everything
will turn out as it should.... I can't bear to have the most beautiful
moments of our lives made sad for you by apprehension. Won't you
believe me that all will go well?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then smile at me, Clive."</p>

<p>His under lip was still unsteady as he drew nearer and took her
into his arms.</p>

<p>"God wouldn't do such harm," he said. "He <em>couldn't</em>!
All must go well."</p>

<p>She smiled gaily and framed his head with her hands:</p>

<p>"You're just a boy, aren't you, C. Bailey, Junior?&mdash;just a big
boy, yet. As though the God we understand&mdash;you and <em>I&mdash;</em>could
deal otherwise than tenderly with us. <em>He</em> knows how rare
love really is. He will not disturb it. The world needs it for
seed."</p>

<p>The smile gradually faded from Clive's face; he shook his head,
slightly:</p>

<p>"If I had known&mdash;if I had understood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, darling?"</p>

<p>"The hazard&mdash;the chances you are to take&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she laughed deliciously, and sealed his mouth with her fragrant
hand, bidding him hunt for other sources of worry if he really
was bent on scaring himself.</p>

<p>Later she asked him for a calendar, and he brought it, and together
they looked over it where several of the last days of May had
been marked with a pencil.</p>

<p>As she sat beside him, studying the printed sequence of the days,
a smile hovering on her lips, he thought he had never seen her
so beautiful.</p>

<p>A soft wind blew the bright tendrils of her hair across her cheeks;
her skin was like a little girl's, rose and snow, smooth as a
child's; her eyes clearly, darkly blue&mdash;the hue and tint called
azure&mdash;like the colour of the zenith on some still June day.</p>

<p>And through the glow of her superb and youthful symmetry, ever,
it seemed to him, some inward radiance pulsated, burning in her
golden burnished hair, in scarlet on her lips, making lovely the
soft splendour of her eyes. Hers was the fresh, sweet beauty of
ardent youth and spring incarnate,&mdash;neither frail and colourlessly
spiritual, nor tainted with the stain of clay.</p>

<p>Sometimes Athalie lunched there in the garden with him, Hafiz,
seated on the bench beside them, politely observant, condescending
to receive a morsel now and then.</p>

<p>It was on such a day, at noon-tide, that Athalie bent over toward
him, touched his hair with her lips, then whispered something
very low.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Sometimes Athalie lunched there in the garden
with him."]</p>

<p>His face went white, but he smiled and rose,&mdash;came back swiftly
to kiss her hands&mdash;then entered the house and telephoned to New
York.</p>

<p>When he came back to her she was ready to rise, lean on his arm,
and walk leisurely to the house.</p>

<p>On the way she called his attention to a pale blue sheet of forget-me-nots
spreading under the shrubbery. She noticed other new blossoms
in the garden, lingered before the bed of white pansies. "Like
little faces," she said with a faint smile.</p>

<p>One silvery-grey iris he broke from its sheathed stem and gave
her; she moved slowly on with the scented blossom lifted to her
lips.</p>

<p>In the hall a starched and immaculate nurse met her with a significant
nod of understanding. And so, between Clive and the trained nurse
she mounted the stairs to her room.</p>

<p>Later Clive came in to sit beside her where she lay on her dainty
bed. She turned her flushed face on the pillow, smiled at him,
and lifted her neck a little; and he slipped one arm under it.</p>

<p>"Such a wonderful pillow your shoulder makes," she murmured....
"I am thinking of the first time I ever knew it.... So quiet I
lay,&mdash;such infinite caution I used whenever I moved.... That night
the air was musical with children's voices&mdash;everywhere under the
stars&mdash;softly garrulous, laughing, lisping, calling from the hills
and meadows.... That night of miracles and of stars&mdash;my dear&mdash;my
dearest!&mdash;"</p>

<p>Close to her cheek he breathed: "Are you in pain?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Clive! I am so happy. I love you so &mdash;I love you so."</p>

<p>Then nurse and physician came in and the latter took him by the
arm and walked out of the room with him. For a long while they
paced the passage-way together in whispered conversation before
the nurse came to the door and nodded.</p>

<p>Both went in: Athalie laughed and put up her arms as Clive bent
over her.</p>

<p>"All will be well," she whispered, kissed him, then turned her
head sharply to the right.</p>

<p>When he found himself in the garden, walking at random, the sun
hung a hand's breadth over the woods. Later it seemed to become
entangled amid new leaves and half-naked branches, hanging there
motionless, blinding, glittering through an eternity of time.</p>

<p>And yet he did not notice when twilight came, nor when the dusk's
purple turned to night until he saw lights turned up on both floors.</p>

<p>Nobody summoned him to dinner but he did not notice that. Connor
came to him there in the darkness and said that two other physicians
had arrived with another nurse. He went into the library where
they were just leaving to mount the stairs. They looked at him
as they passed but merely bowed and said nothing.</p>

<p>A steady, persistent clangour vibrated in his brain, dulling
it, so that senses like sight and hearing seemed slow as though
drugged.</p>

<p>Suddenly like a sword the most terrible fear he ever knew passed
through him.... And after a while the dull, ringing clangour came
back, dinning, stupefying, interminable. Yet he was conscious
of every sound, every movement on the floor above.</p>

<p>One of the physicians came halfway down the stairs, looked at
him; and he rose mechanically and went up.</p>

<p>He saw nothing clearly in the room until he bent over Athalie.</p>

<p>Her eyes unclosed. She whispered: "It is all right, beloved."</p>

<p>Somebody led him out. He kept on, conscious of the grasp on his
arm, but seeing nothing.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

<p>He had been walking for a long while, somewhere between light
and darkness,&mdash;perhaps for hours, perhaps minutes. Then somebody
came who laid an arm about his shoulder and spoke of courage.</p>

<p>Other people were in the room, now. One said:</p>

<p>"Don't go up yet."... Once he noticed a woman, Mrs. Connor, crying.
Connor led her away.</p>

<p>Others moved about or stood silent; and some one was always drawing
near him, speaking of courage. It was odd that so much darkness
should invade a lighted room.</p>

<p>Then somebody came down the stairs, noiselessly. The house was
very still.</p>

<p>And at last they let him go upstairs.</p>
