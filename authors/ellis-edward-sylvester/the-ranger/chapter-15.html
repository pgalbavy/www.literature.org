<p>The fugitives continued moving forward until morning, when, to
guard against needless exposure, Kent again ran the canoe under
the bank, and remained at rest the entire day. All suffered so
much from hunger, that the hunter left the boat during the afternoon,
and, after a few hours' absence, obtained a sufficient quantity
of meat for them all. This was cooked after his usual cautious
and expert fashion, and was thankfully partaken of by his companions.</p>

<p>Roland and the maid were resting on the sheltered bank of the
river; none but Kent ventured out of sight of the spot during
the day. For aught they knew there might be hordes of savages
within hearing of their voices, scouring the woods in every direction
in their search; it needed but the slightest inadvertency upon
their part to insure their own destruction.</p>

<p>Leslie sat conversing with Rosalind, when Kent started up, and,
glancing behind, stepped down the river-bank and peered out upon
the stream. Leslie was beside him in an instant, and, as the two
gazed out, the boat which they had seen pursuing them during the
night came into view. It was coming up-stream, evidently returning
from the chase. It now contained but three savages. Although Leslie
had but little to fear, nevertheless he watched the boat with
intense interest. Pausing a second, he glanced around, and exclaimed,
in terror:</p>

<p>"As sure as heaven, they are heading toward this point."</p>

<p>Kent commanded, in a whisper:</p>

<p>"Get your shootin'-iron ready, and be ready yourself. They're
comin' in below us."</p>

<p>The savages had landed a few hundred yards down-stream, and seemed
to suspect the presence of no one. Suddenly one of them uttered
a loud whoop. In a moment it was repeated, and an answer came,
apparently from a distance. Ere long two savages approached the
canoe, and, entering, the five again shoved out, and commenced
paddling up-stream. Leslie asked Kent the meaning of these proceedings.</p>

<p>"Plain enough," he answered; "they left them two fellers on the
shore last night, so that, if they passed us, they would see us
when we came along, and they've been watching there ever since.
If we'd gone a half a mile further, they'd have shot us; but as
we happened to stop afore they got eyes on us, they've missed
us, that's all."</p>

<p>[Illustration: Two savages were left on shore.]</p>

<p>At night they again set out, proceeding fearlessly. When morning
again dawned, many miles were placed between Rosalind and her
captors.</p>

<p>It is needless to dwell upon the further particulars of their
homeward journey. Every day occupied was like its predecessor:
pressing boldly forward when the shade of night favored them;
proceeding more cautiously through the day; resting sometimes
in the center of the stream, and then again approaching the shore
for food; now a prey to some imaginary fear, and then thrilling
with hope, when they finally glided into the fair Ohio. Safely
they reached their destination unpursued, and fearing no enemy.</p>

<p>"Wonder who's in them pile of logs up thar," remarked Kent, glancing
suspiciously at Leslie, when they were approaching the ruins of
the house.</p>

<p>"Why, who would be there?" returned he, with well-feigned ignorance.</p>

<p>"Looks as though somebody had fitted it up. Hallo, here!" demanded
Kent, battering against the structure.</p>

<p>At this summons George Leland stepped forth.</p>

<p>The meeting was such as can be easily imagined; joy complete
filled the hearts of all; friend, brother, sister and lover were
reunited; nothing was wanting to fill their cup of bliss. The
old hunter, as soon as his brief salutation was over, withdrew
to the background. Leaning on his rifle, he remarked that he was
"goin' to look on and see the fun."</p>

<p>As soon as the emotion of all had subsided, they turned toward
the hunter. They were without shelter and home, and something
must be done at once.</p>

<p>Kent at once divined their thoughts and said: "Wal, sit down
and I'll tell you what's to be done."</p>

<p>The three did as required, and Kent unfolded his plan.</p>

<p>"There's too much trouble for you in these parts; you must leave.
Up the river some distance is quite a settlement, and there's
the only place you can stay, what I propose is this: we must leave
here as soon as possible, and let us do it <em>now</em>."</p>

<p>"More than once have I thought of the plan which Kent has given,"
said Leslie, "and I hope that it will be carried out at the earliest
moment. Every hour passed here is an hour of peril."</p>

<p>"The matter is then settled," said George. "Let us prepare to
pass our last night here; then to seek another home."</p>

<p>The shelter in which Leland had spent his time during the absence
of the others was found to be commodious enough to accommodate
all, and into it they went. The old hunter kept watch during the
night, while the rest slept, and we doubt very much whether four
happier, more hopeful beings ever were congregated.</p>

<p>At the earliest streak of morn, the hunter aroused the others,
and they prepared to take their final departure. The canoe in
which the three had come was found to be sufficiently capacious
for the entire party. With a tear of regret for the old home,
the fair Rosalind entered the canoe, and soon it was cutting the
waters on its upward course.</p>

<p>It is not necessary in this place to dwell upon the particulars
of their journey. They encountered nothing unusual or alarming
until, in rounding a bend in the river, they were startled by
the sight of an unusual object far up the stream. With the exception
of Kent, all manifested considerable surprise and apprehension.</p>

<p>"What are we to encounter now?" asked Leslie, as he earnestly
scrutinized the approaching object. "Are we never to be rid of
these brutes?"</p>

<p>"It is undoubtedly one of their contrivances," added Leland,
"and I'm afraid we shall have to take to the woods again to give
it a go-by. How is it, Kent?"</p>

<p>The face of the hunter wore a quizzical look, and his only reply
was a quiet smile. As he observed the looks of wonder his companions
cast upon him, he became more thoughtful.</p>

<p>"This is bad business," said he, shaking his head; "<em>that</em>
is something I didn't expect to see."</p>

<p>The progress of the canoe by this time was checked, and it was
drifting with the current. The two young men had no desire for
a nearer approach to the apparently formidable contrivance.</p>

<p>"Can't either one of you two chaps make out what sort of ship
that is coming down-stream?"</p>

<p>Both Leland and Leslie were considerably puzzled, when they saw
Rosalind smile, as if enjoying their stupidity.</p>

<p>"If you can't tell, just ask the gal," added the hunter, bursting
into a loud laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, George I thought you had lived long enough in the western
country to recognize a <em>flat-boat</em>!"</p>

<p>"What dunces we both are. How could any one imagine that to be
anything else than a genuine flat-boat? Let us approach it and
make the acquaintance of those on board."</p>

<p>"Sart'in, boys," said the hunter, dipping his paddles deep into
the water and impelling the canoe rapidly forward.</p>

<p>"A cheer for them!" exclaimed Leslie, rising in the boat and
swinging his hat over his head.</p>

<p>How unspeakably thankful were the hearts of the fugitives, as
their salutation was returned by more than one voice! Friends
indeed were near, and their dangers were over.</p>

<p>A few moments later the canoe was beside the flat-boat.</p>

<p>"Thank God! thank God!" fervently uttered Leland, as he clasped
his sister in his arms and realized that they were now safe, safe!
For the first time in weeks he felt the sweet consciousness of
safety.</p>

<p>"It is almost worth the sufferings we have undergone!" said he.
"This sweet consciousness that we are really beyond the reach
of our foes is an enjoyment that we have not experienced for a
long time."</p>

<p>"Do not forget the all-sustaining Hand that has brought us out
of the very jaws of death."</p>

<p>"Forget it? May He forget me when I fail to remember Him. Great
Father," said Leland, meekly uncovering and bowing his head, while
the tears fell like rain down his face, "Great Father, for this
and all other mercies I thank thee!"</p>

<p>"I join in thanksgiving with theirs," said Leslie, in the same
reverent manner, as he approached brother and sister.</p>

<p>The flat-boat was no other than the celebrated expedition under
Major Taylor, which established such a firm and prosperous settlement
upon the northern bank of the Ohio. He had about thirty souls
on board, a dozen of whom were men. The true cause of the astonishing
success of this company was that both the leader and his comrades
fully understood the perils they encountered in venturing into
the great western wilderness. They were not men who could be decoyed
into the simplest or most cunning contrivances that Indian ingenuity
could suggest, nor were they those who expected to spend a life
of ease and enjoyment in the woods. They simply understood and
prepared for what was before them.</p>

<p>Major Taylor was a man rather inclined to corpulency, with a
red face, Roman nose and eagle eye that seemed to penetrate everything
at which it glanced. He was very affable and social, a great favorite
among all his acquaintances, especially the female portion, who
always felt safe in his presence. His men, nearly all of whom
had served under him in the Revolution, trusted implicitly in
him.</p>

<p>"Friends, you are welcome, doubly welcome to this boat," said
he, raising his hat and saluting Rosalind with all the stately
politeness of a gentleman of the old school. "I trust your stay
upon it will be as prolonged as our own, who, in all probability,
will be the last passengers it will ever carry."</p>

<p>Leslie related in a few words the main facts concerning the burning
of Leland's home, the capture and subsequent escape of himself
and sister, and finally of their desire to reach the upper settlements.
The commiserations of all were given them. For Rosalind especially
they seemed unable to do enough. She was taken within their cabin,
where everything that was possible was done for her comfort.</p>

<p>"I must now insist that you remain with us," said Major Taylor.
"Now that you have no home to which to return, you must accompany
us and build a new one. If the red-skins take <em>our</em> homes
from us they are welcome to do so; but when they undertake it,
I suspect they will find they are troubling a set of men that
know a trick or two as well as themselves. We've all seen service
among the dogs."</p>

<p>"Do you think, Cap'n, there's likely to be a scrimmage where
you drive your stakes?" inquired Kent, with a considerable degree
of curiosity.</p>

<p>"I am sure I cannot tell," replied Major Taylor. "It certainly
seems probable, but why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"'Cause if there's any likelibility of it, I'll agree to accept
your invite and go with you."</p>

<p>"Well, well, my good man, you will go with us anyway, and take
the chances of a brush with them. You strike me as a man who has
seen considerable of the woods."</p>

<p>"He has indeed," said Leslie. "Under heaven, our safety is owing
to his experience and sagacity. He has spent a lifetime in the
woods, and I can honestly say he will be a valuable acquisition
to your party."</p>

<p>"Come, none of that now, or I'll leave you!" said the hunter,
in a warning tone to his young friend.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it&mdash;no doubt of it in the least. We need
him, and if he will only go with us, I think I can promise that
he will occasionally see the service for which his soul longs.
But, you have not given us your decision."</p>

<p>"We are very grateful for your offer," said Leland; "we have
indeed no other refuge to which we can go. The house which has
sheltered my sister and myself since infancy is swept away by
those whom we had learned to look upon as our friends and protectors.
I think when we see men at your age beginning life again, we can
afford to do it ourselves."</p>

<p>"Of course you can&mdash;of course you can," replied the officer,
in his hearty manner. "We'll start a settlement on a grand scale.
One of our men once took orders, and is licensed to marry, so
that if either of you gentlemen should need his services at <em>any</em>
time, you will always find him at hand."</p>

<p>"There is a servant&mdash;a negro, who was taken at the same time
with my sister. I feel as though some effort should be made to
recover him," added Leland, a few minutes later. "We shall be
in a situation to do that by accompanying you, or, at least, we
shall be more likely to find some means of doing so, than if we
followed out the idea, entertained some time ago, of leaving the
country altogether."</p>

<p>"I am decidedly of the opinion&#11834;"</p>

<p>The officer was interrupted by a man at the front of the boat,
calling out his name. He instantly hastened beside him, and demanded
what he wanted.</p>

<p>"Yonder is something approaching, and I cannot satisfy myself
as to what it is. What do you make of it?" he asked.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "Yonder is something approaching."]</p>

<p>Major Taylor bent his sharp gaze upon the object in question
for a moment, and then replied:</p>

<p>"It looks like the head of a person, and yet it is certainly
an odd-looking head. We will call this hunter that has just come
on board. Undoubtedly he can assist us."</p>

<p>In answer to the summons, Kent approached the bow of the boat,
rifle in hand. He peered across the water, but for a time, failed
to identify the thing.</p>

<p>"Stand back a little, and I'll give it a shot. I'll graze it
at first, so as to be sure of what I am going to hit when I shoot
next time."</p>

<p>The hunter raised his rifle, and holding it a second, fired.
At the same instant the unknown object disappeared.</p>

<p>"I think you struck it!" remarked Leland.</p>

<p>"I didn't aim <em>at</em> it, and consequently it ain't been
hit," returned Kent, with an air of assurance.</p>

<p>"Yonder it is this moment!"</p>

<p>As these words were uttered, it again appeared, and to the amazement
of all, called out to them:</p>

<p>"Gorra! what you wastin' your bullets on dis nigger's head for?
Reckoned Kent knowed better."</p>

<p>The hunter seemed on the point of falling from laughter.</p>

<p>"Who'd a thought it was Zeb! Where has he come from? He beats
all niggers in Kentuck for adventures and walloping lies."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the negro was received upon the flat-boat.
It is scarcely necessary to say that his friends all experienced
unfeigned joy at his return. He was as jubilant and reckless of
the truth as ever, and it was a long time before they got at the
truth regarding his escape from the Shawnees.</p>

<p>The flight of Leland, under Providence, was really the means
of liberating the negro. The confusion occasioned by the escape
of the former was so great, that the savages imagined he also
had fled with him. Understanding that it was "do or die" with
him, he tugged and struggled at his bonds with the strength of
desperation. Being secured to a tree as usual, at some distance
from the center of confusion, he escaped observation for a few
moments. It is doubtful, however, whether he would have succeeded
in freeing himself, had he not been covertly assisted by some
unknown friend. Who this personage could be, was never known;
perhaps some Indian who had been befriended by the Leland family,
and who experienced some compunctions of honor (not of conscience)
at the situation of the poor negro.</p>

<p>Zeb had learned enough by this time to exercise a little common
sense. Accordingly, when he found himself free, he made the best
use of his feet and wits, and used every effort to reach the Ohio
river. According to his own narration, he overcame all manner
of perils before succeeding. Undoubtedly he incurred great risk
in the undertaking, and finally succeeded.</p>

<p>He was trudging wearily along the river margin, listening for
some sound of his relentless enemies, who, he doubted not, were
upon his trail, when he caught sight of the flat-boat. Although
he did not identify it at once, he understood from its size and
formation that the hand of the white man alone was concerned in
its structure. He immediately plunged into the river, reaching
it in due time, as we have already shown.</p>

<p>At last the pioneers reached their destination, and began a settlement
which, at this day, is not a town merely but a flourishing city.
As we have hinted in another place, their experience of frontier
life and the sagacity and foresight of their nominal head, saved
them from the misfortunes and sufferings that often befall settlers
in the new country. It is true the red wave of the dreadful war
in the West surged to their very doors; but they saw far away
in the heavens the portentous signs, and so prepared that they
passed through it unscathed.</p>

<p>The passing years touched lightly the heads of Roland and Rosalind
Leslie. As the palmy days of peace settled upon them, an old hunter
frequently spent days and weeks at their house. At such times,
he took the children upon his knees, and told them of the hardships
and suffering their parents had endured, and recounted many of
his own adventures to them. Old Kent was a universal favorite
in the settlement. As he became too old to spend his time entirely
in the woods, he joined the boys in their hunts, and there was
not one who would not have braved death in his defense. He died
peacefully and happily, under the roof of those whom he had served
so well, and was given a burial, at his own request, in the grand
old woods which had ever been his delight and enjoyment.</p>

<p>The wife of Leland survived all of those who have figured in
these pages; but she too has been laid in the valley. Their descendants
are now a numerous and influential family, proud of their ancestry,
and enthusiastic over the deeds of <em>THE RANGER</em>.</p>
