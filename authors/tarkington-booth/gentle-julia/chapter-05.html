<p>Although Noble had saluted the old couple so crossly, thus unconsciously
making them, as he made the sidewalk, proxy for Mr. Atwater, so
to speak, yet the sight of them penetrated his outer layers of
preoccupation and had an effect upon him. In the midst of his
suffering his imagination paused for a shudder: What miserable
old gray shadows those two were! Thank Heaven he and Julia could
never be like that! And in the haze that rose before his mind's
eye he saw himself leading Julia through years of adventure in
far parts of the world: there were glimpses of himself fighting
grotesque figures on the edge of Himalayan precipices at dawn,
while Julia knelt by the tent on the glacier and prayed for him.
He saw head-waiters bowing him and Julia to tables in "strange,
foreign caf√©s," and when they were seated, and he had ordered
dishes that amazed her, he would say in a low voice: "Don't look
now, but do you see that heavy-shouldered man with the insignia,
sitting with that adventuress and those eight officers who are
really his guards? Don't be alarmed, Julia, but I am here to <em>get</em>
that man! Perhaps you remember what your father once said of me?
Now, when what I have to do here is done, perhaps you may wish
to write home and mention a few things to that old man!" And then
a boy's changing voice seemed to sound again close by: "He said
he just could stand the smell of <em>some</em> cigarettes, but
if you burned any more o' yours on his porch&#11834;" And Noble came
back miserably to town again.</p>

<p>From an upper window of a new stucco house two maidens of nineteen
peered down at him. The shade of a striped awning protected the
window from the strong sun and the maidens from the sight of man&mdash;the
latter protection being especially fortunate, since they were
preparing to take a conversational afternoon nap, were robed with
little substance, and their heads appeared to be antlered; for
they caught sight of Noble just as they were preparing to put
silk-and-lace things they called "caps" on their heads.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" the visiting one asked.</p>

<p>"It's Noble Dill; he's kind of one of the crowd."</p>

<p>"Is he nice?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sort of. Kind of shambles around."</p>

<p>"Looks like last year's straw hat to me," the visiting one giggled.</p>

<p>"Oh, he tries to dress&mdash;lately, that is&mdash;but he never did know
how."</p>

<p>"Looks mad about something."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's one of the ones in love with that Julia Atwater I
told you about."</p>

<p>"Has he got any chance with her?"</p>

<p>"Noble Dill? Mercy!"</p>

<p>"Is he much in love with her?"</p>

<p>"'Much'? <em>Murder!</em>"</p>

<p>The visiting one turned from the window and yawned. "Come on:
let's lie down and talk about some of the nice ones!"</p>

<p>The second house beyond this was&mdash;it was the house of Julia!</p>

<p>And what a glamour of summer light lay upon it because it was
the house of Julia! The texture of the sunshine came under a spell
here; glowing flakes of amber were afloat; a powder of opals and
rubies fell silently adrizzle through the trees. The very air
changed, beating faintly with a fairy music, for breathing it
was breathing sorcery: elfin symphonies went tinkling through
it. The grass in the next yard to Julia's was just grass, but
every blade of grass in her yard was cut of jewels.</p>

<p>Julia's house was also the house of that person who through some
ungovernable horseplay of destiny happened to be her father: and
this gave the enchanted spot a background of lurking cyclone&mdash;no
one could tell at what instant there might rise above the roseate
pleasance a funnel-shaped cloud. With young Herbert's injurious
narrative fresh in his mind, Noble quickened his steps; but as
he reached the farther fence post, marking the southward limit
of Mr. Atwater's property, he halted short, startled beautifully.
Through the open front door, just passed, a voice had called his
name; a voice of such arresting sweetness that his breath stopped,
like his feet.</p>

<p>"Oh, Noble!" it called again.</p>

<p>He turned back, and any one who might have seen his face then
would have known what was the matter with him, and must have been
only the more sure of it because his mouth was open. The next
instant the adequate reason for his disorder came lightly through
the open door and down to the gate.</p>

<p>Julia was kind, much too kind! She had heard that her Aunt Harriet
and her Uncle Joe were frequently describing Mr. Atwater's most
recent explosion to other members of the extensive Atwater family
league; and though she had not discovered how Aunt Harriet and
Uncle Joe had obtained their material, yet, in Julia's way of
wording her thoughts, an account of the episode was "all over
town," and she was almost certain that by this time Noble Dill
had heard it. And so, lest he should suffer, the too-gentle creature
seized the first opportunity to cheer him up. That was the most
harmful thing about Julia; when anybody liked her&mdash;even Noble
Dill&mdash;she couldn't bear to have him worried. She was the sympathetic
princess who wouldn't have her puppy's tail chopped off all at
once, but only a little at a time.</p>

<p>"I just happened to see you going by," she said, and then, with
an astounding perfection of seriousness, she added the question:
"Did you <em>mind</em> my calling to you and stopping you, Noble?"</p>

<p>He leaned, drooping, upon the gatepost, seeming to yearn toward
it; his expression was such that this gatepost need not have been
surprised if Noble had knelt to it.</p>

<p>"Why, no," he said hoarsely. "No, I don't have to be back at
the office any particular time. No."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to ask you&#11834;" She hesitated. "Well, it really
doesn't amount to anything&mdash;it's nothing so important I couldn't
have spoken to you about it some other time."</p>

<p>"Well," said Noble, and then on the spur of the moment he continued
darkly: "There might not be any other time."</p>

<p>"How do you mean, Noble?"</p>

<p>He smiled faintly. "I'm thinking of going away." This was true;
nevertheless, it was the first time he had thought of it. "Going
away," he repeated in a murmur. "From this old town."</p>

<p>A shadowy, sweet reproach came upon Julia's eyes. "You mean&mdash;for
good, Noble?" she asked in a low voice, although no one knew better
than she what trouble such performances often cost her, later.
"Noble, you don't mean&#11834;"</p>

<p>He made a vocal sound conveying recklessness, something resembling
a reckless laugh. "I might go&mdash;any day! Just as it happens to
strike me."</p>

<p>"But where to, Noble?"</p>

<p>"I don't-&mdash;Well, maybe to China."</p>

<p>"China!" she cried in amazement. "Why, Noble Dill!"</p>

<p>"There's lots of openings in China," he said. "A white man can
get a commission in the Chinese army any day."</p>

<p>"And so," she said, "you mean you'd rather be an officer in the
Chinese army than stay&mdash;here?" With that, she bit her lip and
averted her face for an instant, then turned to him again, quite
calm. Julia could not help doing these things; she was born that
way, and no punishment changed her.</p>

<p>"Julia&#11834;" the dazzled Noble began, but he stopped with this
beginning, his voice seeming to have exhausted itself upon the
name.</p>

<p>"When do you think you'll start?" she asked.</p>

<p>His voice returned. "I don't know <em>just</em> when," he said;
and he began to feel a little too much committed to this sudden
plan of departure, and to wonder how it had come about. "I &mdash;I
haven't set any day&mdash;exactly."</p>

<p>"Have you talked it over with your mother yet, Noble?"</p>

<p>"Not yet&mdash;exactly," he said, and was conscious of a distaste
for China as something unpleasant and imminent. "I thought I'd
wait till&mdash;till it was certain I <em>would</em> go."</p>

<p>"When will that be, Noble?" And in spite of herself, Julia spoke
in the tone of one who controls herself to ask in calmness: "Is
my name on the list for the guillotine?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "it'll be as soon as I've made up my mind to
go. I probably won't go before then; not till I've made up my
mind to."</p>

<p>"But you might do that any day, mightn't you?"</p>

<p>Noble began to feel relieved; he seemed to have hit upon a way
out. "Yes; and then I'd be gone," he said firmly. "But probably
I wouldn't go at all unless I decided to." This seemed to save
him from China, and he added recklessly: "I guess I wouldn't be
missed much around this old town if I did go."</p>

<p>"Yes, you would," Julia said quickly. "Your family'd miss you&mdash;and
so would everybody."</p>

<p>"Julia, <em>you</em> wouldn't&#11834;"</p>

<p>She laughed lightly. "Of course I should, and so would papa."</p>

<p>Noble released the gatepost and appeared to slant backward. "What?"</p>

<p>"Papa was talking about you this very morning at breakfast,"
she said; and she spoke the truth. "He said he <em>dreamed</em>
about you last night."</p>

<p>"He did?"</p>

<p>Julia nodded sunnily. "He dreamed that you and he were the very
greatest friends!" This also was true, so far as it went; she
only omitted to state that Mr. Atwater had gone on to classify
his dream as a nightmare. "There!" she cried. "Why, of course
he'd miss you&mdash;he'd miss you as much as he'd miss any friend of
mine that comes here."</p>

<p>Noble felt a sudden rush of tenderness toward Mr. Atwater; it
is always possible to misjudge a man for a few hasty words. And
Julia went on quickly:</p>

<p>"I never saw anybody like you, Noble Dill!" she exclaimed. "I
don't suppose there's anybody in the United States except you
that would be capable of doing things like going off to be an
officer in the Chinese army&mdash;all just any minute like this. I've
always declared you were about the most reckless man I know!"</p>

<p>Noble shook his head. "No," he said judicially. "I'm not reckless;
it's just that I don't care what happens."</p>

<p>Julia became grave. "Don't you?"</p>

<p>"To me," he said hurriedly. "I mean I don't care what happens
to myself. I mean that's more the way I am than just reckless."</p>

<p>She was content to let his analysis stand, though she shook her
head, as if knowing herself to be wiser than he about his recklessness.
A cheerfulness came upon them; and the Chinese question seemed
to have been settled by these indirect processes;&mdash;in fact, neither
of them ever mentioned it again. "I mustn't keep you," she said,
"especially when you ought to be getting on downtown to business,
but-&mdash;Oh!" She gave the little cry of a forgetful person
reminded. "I almost forgot what I ran out to ask you!"</p>

<p>"What was it, Julia?" Noble spoke huskily, in a low voice. "What
is it you want me to do, Julia?"</p>

<p>She gave a little fluttering laugh, half timid, half confiding.
"You know how funny papa is about tobacco smoke?" (But she hurried
on without waiting for an answer.) "Well, he is. He's the funniest
old thing; he doesn't like <em>any</em> kind very much except
his own special cheroot things. He growls about every other kind,
but the cigars Mr. <em>Ridgely</em> smokes when he comes here,
papa really <em>does</em> make a fuss over! And, you see, I don't
like to say 'No' when Mr. Ridgely asks if he can smoke, because
it always makes men so uncomfortable if they can't when they're
sitting on a veranda, so I wondered if I could just tactfully
get him to buy something different from his cigars?&mdash;and I thought
the best thing would be to suggest those cigarettes you always
have, Noble. They're the ones papa makes the <em>least</em> fuss
about and seems to stand the best&mdash;next to his own, he seems to
like them the most, I mean&mdash;but I'd forgotten the name of them.
That's what I ran out to ask you."</p>

<p>"Orduma," said Noble. "Orduma Egyptian Cigarettes."</p>

<p>"Would you mind giving me one&mdash;just to show Mr. Ridgely?"</p>

<p>Noble gave her an Orduma cigarette.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you!" she said gratefully. "I mustn't keep you another
minute, because I know your father wouldn't know <em>what</em>
to do at the office without you! Thank you so much for this!"
She turned and walked quickly halfway up the path, then paused,
looking back over her shoulder. "I'll only show it to him, Noble,"
she said. "I won't give it to him!"</p>

<p>She bit her lip as if she had said more than she should have;
shook her head as in self-chiding; then laughed, and in a flash
touched the tiny white cylinder to her lips, waved it to him;&mdash;then
ran to the veranda and up the steps and into the house. She felt
satisfied that she had set matters right, this kind Julia!</p>
