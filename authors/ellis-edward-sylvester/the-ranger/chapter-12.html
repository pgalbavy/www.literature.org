<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The hunter in the course of the day had gained a full knowledge
of the intentions of the Indians in regard to their captives.
Leland was to suffer death at the stake at an early period, while
the negro was to be reserved until some indefinite time in the
future, to be tortured.</p>

<p>The hunter had completely succeeded in disarming his enemies
of every suspicion. He had employed himself, as we have seen,
in throwing his tomahawk at Leland; and learning through a casual
remark that he was to be put to the torture, he expressed his
opinion strongly in favor of it, urging them at the same time
to do it as soon as possible. He made himself perfectly at home,
and was so free among them, that a stranger would have considered
him one of the leading characters.</p>

<p>So perfectly had Kent dissembled, that at night, unexpectedly
to himself, he was chosen as one to watch Leland. The negro was
firmly fastened to a tree and left to himself, while George was
to sleep between two savages.</p>

<p>At supper-time Kent brought him a good-sized piece of well-cooked
meat, and gave him to understand that he was to eat it at all
events. Leland took it without daring to meet his benefactor's
eye, and ate all that was possible. The negro received his meal
from the same hand without the remotest suspicion that a friend
was so near him, and even went so far as to insult him as much
as was in his power, for not bringing him a larger quantity of
food. To carry out still further the appearance of things, Kent
tore a small tuft from the negro's head, as if to revenge himself.</p>

<p>"Blast you," he shouted, "if I doesn't flog you till you can't
stand. Just hold out your paw a minute."</p>

<p>Zeb used his utmost powers of persuasion to induce Kent to reach
his hand toward him, hoping to revenge himself as he had upon
a former occasion; but the hunter was too shrewd for him, and
with a threatening gesture, left him to himself, and joined his
companions.</p>

<p>"Gorra!" said Zeb to Leland, "if I doesn't believe dat dat's
de nigger I sawed up in de barn toder day."</p>

<p>"You mean cut up?"</p>

<p>"All de same; leastways ef 'tis him, he's cotched his pay afore
he come sneakin' about here."</p>

<p>Now that Leland knew assistance was at hand, he experienced a
desire to converse with the negro, and thus help to pass away
time, which had grown intolerably monotonous. Turning to the old
slave, he resumed:</p>

<p>"He is a savage-looking individual."</p>

<p>This was said in order to quell any suspicion or doubt that might
have entered his head.</p>

<p>"Dat he is; but he'd better keep away from me, if he doesn't
want his picter sp'iled," returned the negro.</p>

<p>"What were you abusing him for, a few minutes ago, when he brought
your food?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, he's afraid I's agwine to hurt him, and begun
to beg off. It makes me <em>so</em> mad to see any feller afraid
dat I let out on him, and he took himself off in a mighty big
hurry."</p>

<p>"Have you lost much of your wool?"</p>

<p>"Two or free hands full; dat's all. 'Bout all growed in ag'in;
but I ca'culate dat de next dat gits his hand in my head'll get
it in a steel-trap. If I gits my grinder on 'im he'll see," said
Zeb, with a meaning shake of his head.</p>

<p>"I guess that they will not trouble you further for the present,"
added Leland, with that air of assurance which one feels for the
safety of another when his own case is free from danger.</p>

<p>"Don't know 'bout dat, but I'd like to have 'em try."</p>

<p>"Well, your wish is about to be gratified," said Leland, as he
noticed a savage approaching him.</p>

<p>"Gorra, don't come here!" said Zeb, staring at him. The savage
did not heed his warning, however, but continued to advance, and
made a motion as if to strike him. The black man closed his eyes,
bent his head toward him and drew his face in all manner of furious
contortions. The savage, however, left him without provoking him
further.</p>

<p>Leland was allowed to remain in his position until the savages
stretched themselves out to rest. They remained up later than
usual, smoking and recounting their deeds and boasting of the
exploits they intended to accomplish. Kent narrated some marvelous
stories, which greatly excited their wonder and admiration of
him.</p>

<p>The time thus occupied seemed interminable to Leland, who was
in a fever of excitement and anxiety; but at last Kent stretched
himself beside him, while the other watch did the same upon the
opposite side.</p>

<p>Still it would probably be hours before anything could be done,
and Leland was compelled to suffer the most intense and anxious
impatience for a long time. His thoughts prevented him from feeling
the least desire to sleep, and he could only worry and writhe
in his helpless position.</p>

<p>Kent, in arranging a place for himself beside him, bent his head
to his ear and breathed:</p>

<p>"Pretend to sleep."</p>

<p>Although this was said in less than a whisper, Leland heard the
words distinctly and prepared to follow the warning. To prevent
the slightest suspicion, he continued to groan and move for some
minutes; but he gradually ceased, and after a while settled down
into a state of rest. Soon his heavy, regular breathing would
have led any one into the belief that a heavy sleep was upon him.
Not the slightest voluntary motion was made, and Kent remarked
to his brother sentinel that their captive must be unconscious
of the doom that awaited him.</p>

<p>A cord was fastened to Leland's wrist and then to Kent's arm,
so that the slightest movement upon the part of the former would
disturb and awake the latter should he fall asleep. The other
watch, noticing this, failed to adopt the same precaution.</p>

<p>For a few more minutes the savage held a conversation with Kent;
but in the course of a half-hour the answers of the latter began
to grow brief and indistinct, and finally ceased altogether; then
he began to breathe more slowly and heavily, and the savage at
last believed that both guard and prisoner were sound asleep.</p>

<p>When lying upon the earth at night, with no one with whom a conversation
can be held, and with nothing but the will to combat the approach
of sleep, the person is almost sure to succumb sooner or later.
At any rate, such was the case with the savage in question, and
scarce an hour had elapsed since he had ceased speaking when he
was as unconscious of the state of things around as though he
had never been born.</p>

<p>Now was the time to commence operations; the critical moment
had arrived, and Kent commenced the work upon which probably more
than one life depended.</p>

<p>First he withdrew his knife from his belt, and severed the cord
that bound him to Leland. Then as cautiously, silently and quickly,
cut the thong that held his feet. This was the first intimation
Leland had that his friend was at work.</p>

<p>Leland's hands, as we have said, were bound behind; consequently
it was necessary that he should turn upon his side in order that
Kent might reach them. He knew this and made the movement; but
his excitement and agitation were so great that he turned too
far, and in recovering himself, awoke the savage. His presence
of mind and Kent's cunning saved him. He groaned deeply and muttered
to himself, while the hunter started up as though he had just
awoke, and gazed wonderingly at him.</p>

<p>"I wish he'd keep still," said he, in the Indian tongue, lying
down again. This satisfied the other, who fell back and closed
his eyes.</p>

<p>For an hour neither stirred. At the end of that time, Kent raised
his head and gazed cautiously around upon the circle of sleeping
savages. Zeb was at a short distance, resting as calmly as an
infant upon its mother's breast. The one beside Leland had again
passed off to the land of dreams; yet an Indian never sleeps soundly,
and the slightest mishap upon the part of those who were awake
and expecting to move, might arouse the whole body and bring certain
and instant death upon them. It would not do to awaken the sleeping
sentinel again. Life now hung upon a thread.</p>

<p>Kent reached beneath Leland and cut the cord. He was now free
and at liberty to move.</p>

<p>"Be careful!" whispered the hunter, as he assisted him to his
feet. Leland could not suppress his agitation, yet he used all
the caution in his power. But cautious as they both were, the
savage nearest them awoke. Kent had his eye upon him, and the
instant he stirred, sprung like a panther toward him. One hand
clutched his mouth, his knee pressed heavily upon his breast,
and whipping out his knife, he forced it to the hilt in his body.
Nothing but the dull, fleshy sound, as it sunk into the seat of
life, was heard. The bloody stream silently followed its withdrawal,
there were several spasmodic struggles, and the savage straightened
out in death.</p>

<p>Kent arose from the body and motioned to Leland to follow him.
Not another being was awake, and tremblingly he followed over
their prostrate, sleeping forms. They were just passing into the
thick surrounding darkness, when the negro, through some means,
awoke.</p>

<p>"Gorra," he shouted, "isn't you gwine to help dis pusson too?"</p>

<p>"Cuss that nigger," muttered the hunter. "Keep close to me and
use your pegs, fur a long run's before us."</p>

<p>Both darted away together, as the wild yells told them that their
escape was discovered. Those horrid, unearthly whoops, of which
no idea can be had unless they be heard, set Leland's blood on
fire. In a moment the whole forest seemed swarming with their
enemies, and the yells of many were fearfully near. Kent could
distance any of them when alone, yet the presence of Leland retarded
him somewhat. However, by taking the latter's hand, they both
passed over the ground with great swiftness, and neither had much
fear of being overtaken.</p>

<p>On, on plunged the pursued, until many a mile had been passed;
still they halted not. The voices and answering shouts of the
savages could be heard upon every side, and they had yet by no
means reached a place of safety. Now some limb brushed in Leland's
face, or he stumbled over some fallen tree, and then, without
a murmur, arose and pursued his way. On, on they hurried, until
the dispersing darkness told them that the day was not far distant.</p>

<p>"I can travel no further," said Leland, sinking to the earth.</p>

<p>"Give out?" queried Kent.</p>

<p>"I believe I have. This is a terrible chase; but the prospect
of a recapture and death cannot goad me further, until I have
rested."</p>

<p>"Wal, no mistake we have tramped some; but Lord save you, this
is just fun for me."</p>

<p>"Do you not think that they will abandon pursuit?"</p>

<p>"No danger of that. As soon as 'tis light they'll pounce upon
our trail, and foller it until it's lost or we are cotched."</p>

<p>"Which must not be."</p>

<p>"Wal, p'raps if they get their claws on you you wouldn't feel
very comfortable."</p>

<p>But they had passed through the most trying ordeals, and had
now only to make their way as best they could. Kent had some idea
of the nature of the ground, and they progressed with greater
ease and rapidity, after a short rest.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said the hunter, coming to a halt. Leland gazed
ahead, and saw a broad sheet of water which he knew must be the
Ohio.</p>

<p>"And now," added Kent, "we've got to hunt up Leslie. He can't
be far off, and I'm in hopes we'll stumble upon him afore day.
Just squat and make yourself miserable while I take a run up and
down the bank."</p>

<p>Leland obeyed him, and in a moment was left alone, shivering
in the chilly night-air, and feeling miserable indeed in his lonely
situation. But he was not disposed to murmur; he had escaped death&mdash;that
was enough.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour Kent returned with the information that
he had found the boat about half a mile up, but that Leslie was
not in it. Both started, and, after stumbling over bushes loaded
with water, and sinking into the miry shore, and wading in the
river by turns, they came upon it, pulled high up on the bank.
It was becoming lighter every moment, and as Kent knew that as
soon as possible their trail would be followed, he was unwilling
to brook the slightest delay.</p>

<p>"As soon as one is out the scrape another gets in. Here you have
got clear, and now <em>he</em> must go and make a fool of himself.
If he's got taken, that's the meanest trick yet."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is not far off," said Leland, stepping in the boat
and searching it. "He is not here, certainly," he added, after
looking over it.</p>

<p>"I'll wait a while, and then we must look out for ourselves.
No use of losing our own hair in tryin' to help him," rejoined
Kent.</p>

<p>Both took the boat, and turning it over so as to free it from
water, shoved it out from the beach.</p>

<p>"Halloa, Leslie! If you're about just say so, and if you ain't
let us know," shouted Kent, in a loud voice.</p>

<p>A silence of a few moments followed, when he repeated the call.
To the surprise of both it was answered.</p>

<p>"That you, Kent?" came a voice as if its owner had just waked.</p>

<p>"Wal, I rather guess so; and it's my private opinion that you'd
better tumble yourself in here in short order," returned Kent.</p>

<p>A dark form arose to all appearance from the ground, and pitching
awkwardly forward, exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You don't suppose a fellow would be in the boat through all
that rain, do you? Oh! is Leland there?" he asked, pausing and
collecting his senses.</p>

<p>"No! Poor fellow's scalped and burned at the stake. Had to kill
nine of them to save my own hair."</p>

<p>Leslie made no reply, but stepped silently into the boat. Making
his way toward the stern, he encountered the very person of whom
he had been speaking.</p>

<p>"Hey! who is this?" he exclaimed, starting back.</p>

<p>"A dead red-skin that I cotched," answered Kent.</p>

<p>"Leland, sure as I live!" said Leslie, joyously catching his
hand.</p>

<p>For a few moments they heeded not the mirth of Kent at his joke,
in their mutual congratulations. Then they turned and heard him
say:</p>

<p>"What a couple of fools."</p>

<p>They appreciated his rough kindness too well to make any reply.
The boat was out in the river, and under the long, powerful impulses
that the hunter gave it, was moving rapidly downward.</p>
