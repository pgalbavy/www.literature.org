<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>On the evening of a dismal, rainy day in spring, a mother and
her son were sitting in their log-cabin home in the southern portion
of the present State of Missouri. The settlement bore the name
of Martinsville, in honor of the leader of the little party of
pioneers who had left Kentucky some months before, and, crossing
the Mississippi, located in that portion of the vast territory
known at that time as Louisiana.</p>

<p>There were precisely twenty cabins, all of which had been constructed
with a view to rugged strength, durability, and comfort. Lusty
arms had felled the trees, that were cut the proper length and
dovetailed in the usual manner at the corners, the crevices being
filled with a species of plaster, made almost entirely from yellow
clay. The interiors were generally divided into two apartments,
with a broad fireplace and the rude furniture of the border. Colonel
Martin himself, with the assistance of his two full-grown sons,
erected a more pretentious dwelling with two stories and a loft,
but the other houses, as has already been stated, were of such
a simple and familiar character that the American reader needs
no further description.</p>

<p>Mrs. Carleton was a widow, whose husband had been slain by Indians
in Kentucky some time previous, and who, in the daily requirement
of her duties, and in her great love for her only child, Jack,
found some relief from the dreadful sorrow that overshadowed her
life. Kind neighbors had lent willing hands, and her home was
as well made as any in the settlement. Jack and his companion,
Otto Relstaub, had arrived only a couple of days before, and each
had wrought so hard in his respective household that they had
scarcely found time to speak to or see each other.</p>

<p>The evening meal had been eaten, the things cleared away, and
wood heaped upon the fire which filled the little room with cheerful
illumination. The mother was seated at one side, the silent spinning-wheel
just beyond, while her deft fingers were busy with her knitting.
Jack was half reclining on a rude bench opposite, recounting,
in his boyish fashion, the adventures of himself and Otto on their
memorable journey, which has been fully told in the "Lost Trail."</p>

<p>The good mother possessed an education beyond the ordinary, and,
knowing its great value, insisted upon her son improving his spare
moments in study. Jack was well informed for his years, for no
one could have been blessed with a better teacher, counselor,
and friend, than he was. Even now, when we reintroduce him to
the reader, he held an old-fashioned spelling-book in his hand.
He had tried to give his attention to his lesson, but, boy-like,
his mind persisted in wandering, and his mother, looking fondly
across the fire, was so pleased to hear him chat and to ask and
answer questions, that she could not find it in her heart to chide
him.</p>

<p>"You have never seen Deerfoot, have you, mother?" he asked, abruptly
breaking in on his own narrative.</p>

<p>"Yes, I have seen him; he saved the life of your father."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Jack, straightening up and staring at his parent
in open-mouthed amazement: "I never heard of that before."</p>

<p>"Didn't Deerfoot tell you?"</p>

<p>"He never hinted anything of the kind. He once asked me about
father's death and about you, but I thought it was only a natural
interest he felt on my account. But tell me how it was, mother."</p>

<p>"Some months before your father's death, he was absent a couple
of days on a hunt to the south of our home. He kindled a camp-fire
in a deep valley, where the undergrowth was so dense that he felt
sure of being safe against discovery. The night was very cold,
and snow was flying in the air. Besides that, he had eaten nothing
all day, and was anxious to broil a wild turkey he had shot just
as it began to grow dark. He started the fire, ate his supper,
and was in the act of lying down for the night, when a young Indian
walked out from the woods, saying in the best of English that
he was his friend. Your father told me that he was the most graceful
and handsome youth he had ever looked upon&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That was Deerfoot!" exclaimed the delighted Jack.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of it, for he told your father that such
was his English name. I forget what his own people called him.
Well, he said to your father, in the most quiet manner, that a
party of Shawanoes were very near him. They had heard the report
of his rifle, and, suspecting what it meant, were carefully arranging
to capture him for the purpose of torture. Deerfoot had seen them,
and, having also heard the gun, learned what was going on. If
your father had stayed where he was five minutes longer, nothing
could have saved him. I need not tell you that he did not stay.
Under the guidance of Deerfoot he managed to extricate himself
from his peril, and, by traveling the entire night, was beyond
all danger when the sun rose again. Deerfoot did not leave him
until certain he had no cause for fear. Then, when your father
turned to thank him, he was gone. He had departed as silently
as a shadow."</p>

<p>"That was just like Deerfoot!" exclaimed Jack, with kindling
eye; "it seems to me he is like Washington. Though he has been
in any number of dangers, I don't believe he has so much as a
scar on his little finger. He has been fired upon I don't know
how often, but, like Washington, he carries a charmed life."</p>

<p>The serious mother shook her head, and, looking over her knitting
at her boy, made answer:</p>

<p>"Such a thing is unknown in this world; more than likely he will
fall by the knife or bullet of an enemy."</p>

<p>"I suppose he is liable to be shot, like any one else; but the
Indian that does it has got to be mighty smart to get ahead of
him. Plenty of them have tried it with knife and tomahawk, but
they never lived to try it on any one else. But that ain't the
most wonderful part of it," added Jack, shaking his head and gesticulating
in his excitement with both arms; "Deerfoot knows a good deal
more about books than I do."</p>

<p>"That does not imply that he possesses any remarkable education,"
said the mother, with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>The boy flushed, and sinking back said:</p>

<p>"I know I ain't the best-educated fellow in the settlement, but
who ever heard of a young Indian knowing how to read and write?
Why, that fellow can write the prettiest hand you ever saw. He
carries a little Bible with him: the print is so fine I can hardly
read it, but he will stretch out in the light of a poor camp-fire,
and read it for an hour at a time. I can't understand where he
picked it all up, but he told me about the Pacific Ocean, which
is away beyond our country, and he spoke of the land where the
Saviour lived when he was on earth. I never felt so ashamed of
myself as I did when he sat down and told me such things. He can
repeat verse after verse from the Bible; he pronounced the Lord's
Prayer in Shawanoe, and then told me and Otto that if we would
only use the English a little oftener the Great Spirit would hear
us. What do you think of <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"It is very good advice."</p>

<p>"Of course it is, but the idea of a young Indian being that sort
of fellow! Well, there's no use of talking," added Jack, as though
unable to do justice to the theme, "he beats anything I ever heard
of. If the truth should be written as to what he has done, and
put in a book, I don't 'spose one person in a hundred would believe
it. He promised to come and see us."</p>

<p>"I hope he will," said the mother; "I shall always hold him in
the highest esteem and gratitude for his kindness to your father
and to you."</p>

<p>"I tell you it would have gone rough with Otto and me if it hadn't
been for him. I wonder how Otto is getting along?" said Jack,
with an expression of misgiving on his face.</p>

<p>"Why do you ask that?" inquired his mother.</p>

<p>"I think Deerfoot was worried over him."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you."</p>

<p>"Why, you know Otto has got the meanest father in the whole United
States of America&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Those are strong words," interrupted the parent reprovingly.</p>

<p>"It is contrary to your teaching to talk that way, but you know,
too, that it is the solemn truth. Deerfoot stopped at Jacob Relstaub's
cabin, in this very settlement, some weeks ago, when it was raining
harder than now, and asked for something to eat, and to stay all
night. What do you 'spose Relstaub did? He abused him and turned
him away."</p>

<p>"What a shame!" exclaimed the good woman indignantly. "Why did
Deerfoot not come here or to one of the other cabins?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but he went off in the woods by himself. Otto
tried to befriend him, and was whipped for it; but Deerfoot never
forgot it, and he risked his life to help Otto and me."</p>

<p>"It was very unkind in Mr. Relstaub, but you have not told me
why you and Deerfoot were alarmed for Otto."</p>

<p>"Otto had the best horse that his father owns. It ran away from
us, and, though we tried hard to get him again, we couldn't, and
Otto and I came home on foot. Knowing his father as well as we
do, Deerfoot and I were afraid the poor fellow would be punished
because he lost the animal. I haven't had a chance to say much
to Otto, and when I did, I didn't want to ask him about it, but
I would like to know whether he has been punished for what he
couldn't help."</p>

<p>"I can answer that question," said Mrs. Carleton, softly; "his
father whipped him most cruelly yesterday."</p>

<p>"The old scamp&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut!" warned the parent, raising her finger, "it <em>was</em>
cruel, but Otto will survive it, as he has many other times, and
before many years he will become so large that his father will
not be able to punish him."</p>

<p>"I hope he will undertake it, and Otto will knock him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said the mother, more sternly, "you have already allowed
your feelings to lead you too far."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, mother," said Jack, humbly, "I would not hurt your
feelings for the world; but there is such a contrast between his
father and you, and his mother is just as bad&#11834;"</p>

<p>Jack checked himself again, for his quick ear detected something.
He turned quickly toward the door of the cabin, and his mother,
reading the meaning of the movement, did the same, holding her
fingers motionless while both listened.</p>

<p>The rain beat upon the roof, dashed against the window-panes,
and rattled on the logs of the cabin, with a melancholy sound
that made the interior seem doubly cheerful by contrast. At times
the wind roared among the trees, and some of the pattering drops
found their way down the chimney, and hissed among the flaming
brands, making tiny black points that were instantly wiped out
by the ardor of the fire itself.</p>

<p>Suddenly the latch-string, which was only drawn in when the inmates
were ready to retire, was pulled, the latch raised, the door opened,
and Otto Relstaub, his garments dripping water, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" he called, pausing a moment to close the door
against the driving storm.</p>

<p>Both greeted the visitor, and Jack, laying aside his book, advanced
and warmly shook the hand of his friend, bringing him forward
and giving him a seat on the bench, which was drawn still nearer
the fire.</p>

<p>Otto was attired very much as when we saw him last, but he did
not carry his gun with him. He took off his peaked hat, shook
the water from it, and then his broad, good-natured face, gleaming
with moisture and rugged health, was raised to meet the mild,
inquiring gaze of the lady, who asked him how he was.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ish well," he answered, speaking English much better than
he did a short time previous, "I have been working so hard dot
I couldn't come over before."</p>

<p>"I'm real glad to see you," said Jack, cordially, slapping him
on the back and making the water fly; "if you hadn't called to-night
I would have dropped in to-morrow to see you. We've hardly had
a chance to speak to each other since we got back."</p>

<p>"No, dot ish so," said Otto, with a sigh. "Father, he makes me
work harder as I never did, to make up for the time dot I wasted
in play, he says. By Jiminy! I don't think dot was much play,
do you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"It was the worst play I ever went through; two boys never worked
harder for their lives than did we, and if it hadn't been for
Deerfoot, we never would have reached Martinsville. I suppose
your father gave you a whipping for losing Toby?"</p>

<p>"I should thinks he did! I hadn't been home one hours, when he
went out and cut a stick, and used it up on me, and he doned the
same yesterday."</p>

<p>Jack was about to break forth into vigorous language, when his
mother anticipated him. Her voice was slightly tremulous, for,
despite her enforced calmness, she could not altogether restrain
her feelings.</p>

<p>"Surely he could not have understood the matter; I will speak
to your mother."</p>

<p>Otto shrugged his shoulders, with a laugh in which there was
more sadness than mirth.</p>

<p>"Moder is worse than him; she tole him he didn't whips me half
enough, and so he tried it again yesterday. I heard her tells
him to-night dot I needed more, so I slips out and comes over
here before he could get everythings ready. May I stay here all
night?"</p>

<p>"All night!" repeated Jack, "you may stay a week&mdash;a month&mdash;a
year&mdash;yes, <em>forever</em>."</p>

<p>"I don't want to stay dot long," said Otto, with his pleasant
laugh; "but fader, he tells me he will beat me every day till
I brings back de horse."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Jack, compressing his lips, "you won't go back
till you get the horse&mdash;if it takes five years."</p>

<p>"Did your father tell you to stay away till you recovered the
animal?" asked Mrs. Carleton.</p>

<p>"Dot vos just vot he says."</p>

<p>"Then it is proper that you should obey him."</p>

<p>Otto nodded his head to signify that his sentiments were those
of his friends. He glanced slyly around the room, but did not
explain what he was looking for, and, unfortunately, neither mother
nor son suspected the meaning of the look; but Otto's hard-hearted
parents had actually driven him from their home without allowing
him to eat a mouthful of dinner or supper. He was suffering with
hunger, but was plucky enough to bear it without complaining,
since his friends had partaken and cleared away the table long
before.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do?" asked Mrs. Carleton, who deeply sympathized
with the poor lad.</p>

<p>"I goes home in de mornings and gets my gun and powder-horn before
they can whips me, and then I goes off to hunt for Toby."</p>

<p>"And I'll go with you!" exclaimed the impulsive Jack, springing
to his feet; "you'll let me, mother, won't you?" he asked, turning
beseechingly toward her.</p>

<p>Recalling the perils through which her only child had passed
so recently, the widow could not but contemplate with dismay the
prospect of having him venture into the wilderness again; but
she felt deeply for poor honest Otto, who was so willing and good-natured,
and who had shown such a desire to help her while her own boy
was in Kentucky.</p>

<p>Furthermore, she knew that Louisiana was a much less dangerous
country than the Dark and Bloody Ground. Few of the Shawanoes,
Hurons, and other actively hostile tribes ever crossed to the
western side of the Mississippi, where the Osages gave little
trouble to the settlers scattered through that immense territory.</p>

<p>Otto's eyes sparkled when Jack Carleton leaped to his feet and
declared he would go with him on the search for the lost horse
(subject, of course, to the consent of his mother), and the German
youth looked pleadingly toward the good woman, who, it is hardly
necessary to say, yielded consent, giving with it a large amount
of motherly counsel, to which the boys listened respectfully,
though candor compels me to say that the thoughts of both were
far away among the green woods, beside the sparkling streams,
and in the shadows of the chasms, ravines, and gloomy mountains,
whither, as they well knew, the curious search would lead them.</p>
