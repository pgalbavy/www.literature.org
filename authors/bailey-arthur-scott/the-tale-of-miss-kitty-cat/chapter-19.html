<p>THE PEDDLER that took Miss Kitty Cat away in his cart drove long into
the night. Inside the basket into which her captor had popped her, Miss
Kitty kept her wits at work. She knew that there were many twists and
turns as they creaked up the hills and rattled down the other side of
them. Then there were level stretches where the peddler held his horse
to a swinging gait that fast put long miles between them and Farmer
Green's place in Pleasant Valley.
</p>
<p>"Dear me!" Miss Kitty thought. "What a tramp I'll have getting back
home again!" For already she was planning to return to the farm. She
didn't care if they did need a good mouser at the stranger's house. They
needed one just as much at Farmer Green's.
</p><p>"If Mrs. Green has to depend on traps to take care of the mice she'll
soon be eaten out of house and home," Miss Kitty mused. "The minute that
fat Moses Mouse knows I'm gone he'll be as bold as brass."
</p><p>At last the wagon left the hard road and pulled up in a dooryard. A dog
barked. And Miss Kitty heard voices.
</p><p>"I've brought you something in here that you'll like," said the peddler
as he handed Miss Kitty's basket to somebody. "But don't look at it out
of doors or it'll get away."
</p><p>Later, inside the house, a woman let Miss Kitty out of her prison.
</p><p>"What a big cat!" she exclaimed. "Where did you get her?"
</p><p>"Oh, I picked her up on the road," said the peddler. "She looked as if
she wanted a ride," he chuckled. "I think she was hunting along an old
stone wall."
</p><p>"She'll find hunting enough here," said his wife. "This house is overrun
with mice. I'll just put her down cellar and let her work for her
supper." Then she gave Miss Kitty a toss down the cellar stairs and
slammed the door behind her.
</p><p>It was no wonder that Miss Kitty Cat was angry.
</p><p>"A fine way to treat a guest!" she spluttered down there in the dark.
"That woman might have set out a little milk for me. It would have
tasted good, after my long ride in that stuffy basket." Miss Kitty
couldn't help thinking what a fine home she had had at Farmer Green's
and how good Mrs. Green had always been to her.
</p><p>Even Johnnie Green--though he <u>was</u> a boy--had petted her oftener than
he had pulled her tail.
</p><p>But Miss Kitty was too hungry to sit long at the foot of the cellar
stairs in thought.
</p><p>She soon heard faint rustlings squeaks, and scratchings around her. And
though she didn't care to oblige the woman upstairs in any way, Miss
Kitty lost no time in providing a hearty meal for herself.
</p><p>Then she lay down on an old sack and slept for a while.
</p><p>And just before the roosters began to crow she had found a broken pane
in a cellar window.
</p><p>"What luck!" said Miss Kitty under her breath. And very silently she
slipped through the opening and stole away.
