1. MODERN RELIGION HAS NO FOUNDER
<P>
<P>
Perhaps all religions, unless the flaming onset of Mohammedanism be 
an exception, have dawned imperceptibly upon the world.  A little 
while ago and the thing was not; and then suddenly it has been found 
in existence, and already in a state of diffusion.  People have 
begun to hear of the new belief first here and then there.  It is 
interesting, for example, to trace how Christianity drifted into the 
consciousness of the Roman world.  But when a religion has been 
interrogated it has always had hitherto a tale of beginnings, the 
name and story of a founder.  The renascent religion that is now 
taking shape, it seems, had no founder; it points to no origins.  It 
is the Truth, its believers declare; it has always been here; it has 
always been visible to those who had eyes to see.  It is perhaps 
plainer than it was and to more people--that is all.
<P>
It is as if it still did not realise its own difference.  Many of 
those who hold it still think of it as if it were a kind of 
Christianity.  Some, catching at a phrase of Huxley's, speak of it 
as Christianity without Theology.  They do not know the creed they 
are carrying.  It has, as a matter of fact, a very fine and subtle 
theology, flatly opposed to any belief that could, except by great 
stretching of charity and the imagination, be called Christianity.  
One might find, perhaps, a parallelism with the system ascribed to 
some Gnostics, but that is far more probably an accidental rather 
than a sympathetic coincidence.  Of that the reader shall presently 
have an opportunity of judging.
<P>
This indefiniteness of statement and relationship is probably only 
the opening phase of the new faith.  Christianity also began with an 
extreme neglect of definition.  It was not at first anything more 
than a sect of Judaism.  It was only after three centuries, amidst 
the uproar and emotions of the council of Nicaea, when the more 
enthusiastic Trinitarians stuffed their fingers in their ears in 
affected horror at the arguments of old Arius, that the cardinal 
mystery of the Trinity was established as the essential fact of 
Christianity.  Throughout those three centuries, the centuries of 
its greatest achievements and noblest martyrdoms, Christianity had 
not defined its God.  And even to-day it has to be noted that a 
large majority of those who possess and repeat the Christian creeds 
have come into the practice so insensibly from unthinking childhood, 
that only in the slightest way do they realise the nature of the 
statements to which they subscribe.  They will speak and think of 
both Christ and God in ways flatly incompatible with the doctrine of 
the Triune deity upon which, theoretically, the entire fabric of all 
the churches rests.  They will show themselves as frankly Arians as 
though that damnable heresy had not been washed out of the world 
forever after centuries of persecution in torrents of blood.  But 
whatever the present state of Christendom in these matters may be, 
there can be no doubt of the enormous pains taken in the past to 
give Christian beliefs the exactest, least ambiguous statement 
possible.  Christianity knew itself clearly for what it was in its 
maturity, whatever the indecisions of its childhood or the 
confusions of its decay.  The renascent religion that one finds now, 
a thing active and sufficient in many minds, has still scarcely come 
to self-consciousness.  But it is so coming, and this present book 
is very largely an attempt to state the shape it is assuming and to 
compare it with the beliefs and imperatives and usages of the 
various Christian, pseudo-Christian, philosophical, and agnostic 
cults amidst which it has appeared.
<P>
The writer's sympathies and convictions are entirely with this that 
he speaks of as renascent or modern religion; he is neither atheist 
nor Buddhist nor Mohammedan nor Christian.  He will make no 
pretence, therefore, to impartiality and detachment.  He will do his 
best to be as fair as possible and as candid as possible, but the 
reader must reckon with this bias.  He has found this faith growing 
up in himself; he has found it, or something very difficult to 
distinguish from it, growing independently in the minds of men and 
women he has met.  They have been people of very various origins; 
English, Americans, Bengalis, Russians, French, people brought up in 
a "Catholic atmosphere," Positivists, Baptists, Sikhs, Mohammedans.  
Their diversity of source is as remarkable as their convergence of 
tendency.  A miscellany of minds thinking upon parallel lines has 
come out to the same light.  The new teaching is also traceable in 
many professedly Christian religious books and it is to be heard 
from Christian pulpits.  The phase of definition is manifestly at 
hand.
<P>
<P>
<P>
2. MODERN RELIGION HAS A FINITE GOD
<P>
<P>
Perhaps the most fundamental difference between this new faith and 
any recognised form of Christianity is that, knowingly or 
unknowingly, it worships A FINITE GOD.  Directly the believer is 
fairly confronted with the plain questions of the case, the vague 
identifications that are still carelessly made with one or all of 
the persons of the Trinity dissolve away.  He will admit that his 
God is neither all-wise, nor all-powerful, nor omnipresent; that he 
is neither the maker of heaven nor earth, and that he has little to 
identify him with that hereditary God of the Jews who became the 
"Father" in the Christian system.  On the other hand he will assert 
that his God is a god of salvation, that he is a spirit, a person, a 
strongly marked and knowable personality, loving, inspiring, and 
lovable, who exists or strives to exist in every human soul.  He 
will be much less certain in his denials that his God has a close 
resemblance to the Pauline (as distinguished from the Trinitarian) 
"Christ." . . .
<P>
The modern religious man will almost certainly profess a kind of 
universalism; he will assert that whensoever men have called upon 
any God and have found fellowship and comfort and courage and that 
sense of God within them, that inner light which is the quintessence 
of the religious experience, it was the True God that answered them.  
For the True God is a generous God, not a jealous God; the very 
antithesis of that bickering monopolist who "will have none other 
gods but Me"; and when a human heart cries out--to what name it 
matters not--for a larger spirit and a stronger help than the 
visible things of life can give, straightway the nameless Helper is 
with it and the God of Man answers to the call.  The True God has no 
scorn nor hate for those who have accepted the many-handed symbols 
of the Hindu or the lacquered idols of China.  Where there is faith, 
where there is need, there is the True God ready to clasp the hands 
that stretch out seeking for him into the darkness behind the ivory 
and gold.
<P>
The fact that God is FINITE is one upon which those who think 
clearly among the new believers are very insistent.  He is, above 
everything else, a personality, and to be a personality is to have 
characteristics, to be limited by characteristics; he is a Being, 
not us but dealing with us and through us, he has an aim and that 
means he has a past and future; he is within time and not outside 
it.  And they point out that this is really what everyone who prays 
sincerely to God or gets help from God, feels and believes.  Our 
practice with God is better than our theory.  None of us really pray 
to that fantastic, unqualified danse a trois, the Trinity, which the 
wranglings and disputes of the worthies of Alexandria and Syria 
declared to be God.  We pray to one single understanding person.  
But so far the tactics of those Trinitarians at Nicaea, who stuck 
their fingers in their ears, have prevailed in this world; this was 
no matter for discussion, they declared, it was a Holy Mystery full 
of magical terror, and few religious people have thought it worth 
while to revive these terrors by a definite contradiction.  The 
truly religious have been content to lapse quietly into the 
comparative sanity of an unformulated Arianism, they have left it to 
the scoffing Atheist to mock at the patent absurdities of the 
official creed.  But one magnificent protest against this 
theological fantasy must have been the work of a sincerely religious 
man, the cold superb humour of that burlesque creed, ascribed, at 
first no doubt facetiously and then quite seriously, to Saint 
Athanasius the Great, which, by an irony far beyond its original 
intention, has become at last the accepted creed of the church.
<P>
The long truce in the criticism of Trinitarian theology is drawing 
to its end.  It is when men most urgently need God that they become 
least patient with foolish presentations and dogmas.  The new 
believers are very definitely set upon a thorough analysis of the 
nature and growth of the Christian creeds and ideas.  There has 
grown up a practice of assuming that, when God is spoken of, the 
Hebrew-Christian God of Nicaea is meant.  But that God trails with 
him a thousand misconceptions and bad associations; his alleged 
infinite nature, his jealousy, his strange preferences, his 
vindictive Old Testament past.  These things do not even make a 
caricature of the True God; they compose an altogether different and 
antagonistic figure.
<P>
It is a very childish and unphilosophical set of impulses that has 
led the theologians of nearly every faith to claim infinite 
qualities for their deity.  One has to remember the poorness of the 
mental and moral quality of the churchmen of the third, fourth, and 
fifth centuries who saddled Christendom with its characteristic 
dogmas, and the extreme poverty and confusion of the circle of ideas 
within which they thought.  Many of these makers of Christianity, 
like Saint Ambrose of Milan (who had even to be baptised after his 
election to his bishopric), had been pitchforked into the church 
from civil life; they lived in a time of pitiless factions and 
personal feuds; they had to conduct their disputations amidst the 
struggles of would-be emperors; court eunuchs and favourites swayed 
their counsels, and popular rioting clinched their decisions.  There 
was less freedom of discussion then in the Christian world than 
there is at present (1916) in Belgium, and the whole audience of 
educated opinion by which a theory could be judged did not equal, 
either in numbers or accuracy of information, the present population 
of Constantinople.  To these conditions we owe the claim that the 
Christian God is a magic god, very great medicine in battle, "in hoc 
signo vinces," and the argument so natural to the minds of those 
days and so absurd to ours, that since he had ALL power, all 
knowledge, and existed for ever and ever, it was no use whatever to 
set up any other god against him. . . .
<P>
By the fifth century Christianity had adopted as its fundamental 
belief, without which everyone was to be "damned everlastingly," a 
conception of God and of Christ's relation to God, of which even by 
the Christian account of his teaching, Jesus was either totally 
unaware or so negligent and careless of the future comfort of his 
disciples as scarcely to make mention.  The doctrine of the Trinity, 
so far as the relationship of the Third Person goes, hangs almost 
entirely upon one ambiguous and disputed utterance in St. John's 
gospel (XV. 26).  Most of the teachings of Christian orthodoxy 
resolve themselves to the attentive student into assertions of the 
nature of contradiction and repartee.  Someone floats an opinion in 
some matter that has been hitherto vague, in regard, for example, to 
the sonship of Christ or to the method of his birth.  The new 
opinion arouses the hostility and alarm of minds unaccustomed to so 
definite a statement, and in the zeal of their recoil they fly to a 
contrary proposition.  The Christians would neither admit that they 
worshipped more gods than one because of the Greeks, nor deny the 
divinity of Christ because of the Jews.  They dreaded to be 
polytheistic; equally did they dread the least apparent detraction 
from the power and importance of their Saviour.  They were forced 
into the theory of the Trinity by the necessity of those contrary 
assertions, and they had to make it a mystery protected by curses to 
save it from a reductio ad absurdam.  The entire history of the 
growth of the Christian doctrine in those disordered early centuries 
is a history of theology by committee; a history of furious 
wrangling, of hasty compromises, and still more hasty attempts to 
clinch matters by anathema.  When the muddle was at its very worst, 
the church was confronted by enormous political opportunities.  In 
order that it should seize these one chief thing appeared 
imperative: doctrinal uniformity.  The emperor himself, albeit 
unbaptised and very ignorant of Greek, came and seated himself in 
the midst of Christian thought upon a golden throne.  At the end of 
it all Eusebius, that supreme Trimmer, was prepared to damn 
everlastingly all those who doubted that consubstantiality he 
himself had doubted at the beginning of the conference.  It is quite 
clear that Constantine did not care who was damned or for what 
period, so long as the Christians ceased to wrangle among 
themselves.  The practical unanimity of Nicaea was secured by 
threats, and then, turning upon the victors, he sought by threats to 
restore Arius to communion.  The imperial aim was a common faith to 
unite the empire.  The crushing out of the Arians and of the 
Paulicians and suchlike heretics, and more particularly the 
systematic destruction by the orthodox of all heretical writings, 
had about it none of that quality of honest conviction which comes 
to those who have a real knowledge of God; it was a bawling down of 
dissensions that, left to work themselves out, would have spoilt 
good business; it was the fist of Nicolas of Myra over again, except 
that after the days of Ambrose the sword of the executioner and the 
fires of the book-burner were added to the weapon of the human 
voice.  Priscillian was the first human sacrifice formally offered 
up under these improved conditions to the greater glory of the 
reinforced Trinity.  Thereafter the blood of the heretics was the 
cement of Christian unity.
<P>
It is with these things in mind that those who profess the new faith 
are becoming so markedly anxious to distinguish God from the 
Trinitarian's deity.  At present if anyone who has left the 
Christian communion declares himself a believer in God, priest and 
parson swell with self-complacency.  There is no reason why they 
should do so.  That many of us have gone from them and found God is 
no concern of theirs.  It is not that we who went out into the 
wilderness which we thought to be a desert, away from their creeds 
and dogmas, have turned back and are returning.  It is that we have 
gone on still further, and are beyond that desolation.  Never more 
shall we return to those who gather under the cross.  By faith we 
disbelieved and denied.  By faith we said of that stuffed scarecrow 
of divinity, that incoherent accumulation of antique theological 
notions, the Nicene deity, "This is certainly no God."  And by faith 
we have found God. . . .
<P>
<P>
<P>
3. THE INFINITE BEING IS NOT GOD
<P>
<P>
There has always been a demand upon the theological teacher that he 
should supply a cosmogony.  It has always been an effective 
propagandist thing to say: "OUR God made the whole universe.  Don't 
you think that it would be wise to abandon YOUR deity, who did not, 
as you admit, do anything of the sort?"
<P>
The attentive reader of the lives of the Saints will find that this 
style of argument did in the past bring many tribes and nations into 
the Christian fold.  It was second only to the claim of magic 
advantages, demonstrated by a free use of miracles.  Only one great 
religious system, the Buddhist, seems to have resisted the 
temptation to secure for its divinity the honour and title of 
Creator.  Modern religion is like Buddhism in that respect.  It 
offers no theory whatever about the origin of the universe.  It does 
not reach behind the appearances of space and time.  It sees only a 
featureless presumption in that playing with superlatives which has 
entertained so many minds from Plotinus to the Hegelians with the 
delusion that such negative terms as the Absolute or the 
Unconditioned, can assert anything at all.  At the back of all known 
things there is an impenetrable curtain; the ultimate of existence 
is a Veiled Being, which seems to know nothing of life or death or 
good or ill.  Of that Being, whether it is simple or complex or 
divine, we know nothing; to us it is no more than the limit of 
understanding, the unknown beyond.  It may be of practically 
limitless intricacy and possibility.  The new religion does not 
pretend that the God of its life is that Being, or that he has any 
relation of control or association with that Being.  It does not 
even assert that God knows all or much more than we do about that 
ultimate Being.
<P>
For us life is a matter of our personalities in space and time.  
Human analysis probing with philosophy and science towards the 
Veiled Being reveals nothing of God, reveals space and time only as 
necessary forms of consciousness, glimpses a dance of atoms, of 
whirls in the ether.  Some day in the endless future there may be a 
knowledge, an understanding of relationship, a power and courage 
that will pierce into those black wrappings.  To that it may be our 
God, the Captain of Mankind will take us.
<P>
That now is a mere speculation.  The veil of the unknown is set with 
the stars; its outer texture is ether and atom and crystal.  The 
Veiled Being, enigmatical and incomprehensible, broods over the 
mirror upon which the busy shapes of life are moving.  It is as if 
it waited in a great stillness.  Our lives do not deal with it, and 
cannot deal with it.  It may be that they may never be able to deal 
with it.
<P>
<P>
<P>
4. THE LIFE FORCE IS NOT GOD
<P>
<P>
So it is that comprehensive setting of the universe presents itself 
to the modern mind.  It is altogether outside good and evil and love 
and hate.  It is outside God, who is love and goodness.  And coming 
out of this veiled being, proceeding out of it in a manner 
altogether inconceivable, is another lesser being, an impulse 
thrusting through matter and clothing itself in continually changing 
material forms, the maker of our world, Life, the Will to Be.  It 
comes out of that inscrutable being as a wave comes rolling to us 
from beyond the horizon.  It is as it were a great wave rushing 
through matter and possessed by a spirit.  It is a breeding, 
fighting thing; it pants through the jungle track as the tiger and 
lifts itself towards heaven as the tree; it is the rabbit bolting 
for its life and the dove calling to her mate; it crawls, it flies, 
it dives, it lusts and devours, it pursues and eats itself in order 
to live still more eagerly and hastily; it is every living thing, of 
it are our passions and desires and fears.  And it is aware of 
itself not as a whole, but dispersedly as individual self-
consciousness, starting out dispersedly from every one of the 
sentient creatures it has called into being.  They look out for 
their little moments, red-eyed and fierce, full of greed, full of 
the passions of acquisition and assimilation and reproduction, 
submitting only to brief fellowships of defence or aggression.  They 
are beings of strain and conflict and competition.  They are living 
substance still mingled painfully with the dust.  The forms in which 
this being clothes itself bear thorns and fangs and claws, are 
soaked with poison and bright with threats or allurements, prey 
slyly or openly on one another, hold their own for a little while, 
breed savagely and resentfully, and pass. . . .
<P>
This second Being men have called the Life Force, the Will to Live, 
the Struggle for Existence.  They have figured it too as Mother 
Nature.  We may speculate whether it is not what the wiser among the 
Gnostics meant by the Demiurge, but since the Christians destroyed 
all the Gnostic books that must remain a mere curious guess.  We may 
speculate whether this heat and haste and wrath of life about us is 
the Dark God of the Manichees, the evil spirit of the sun 
worshippers.  But in contemporary thought there is no conviction 
apparent that this Demiurge is either good or evil; it is conceived 
of as both good and evil.  If it gives all the pain and conflict of 
life, it gives also the joy of the sunshine, the delight and hope of 
youth, the pleasures.  If it has elaborated a hundred thousand sorts 
of parasite, it has also moulded the beautiful limbs of man and 
woman; it has shaped the slug and the flower.  And in it, as part of 
it, taking its rewards, responding to its goads, struggling against 
the final abandonment to death, do we all live, as the beasts live, 
glad, angry, sorry, revengeful, hopeful, weary, disgusted, 
forgetful, lustful, happy, excited, bored, in pain, mood after mood 
but always fearing death, with no certainty and no coherence within 
us, until we find God.  And God comes to us neither out of the stars 
nor out of the pride of life, but as a still small voice within.
<P>
<P>
<P>
5. GOD IS WITHIN
<P>
<P>
God comes we know not whence, into the conflict of life.  He works 
in men and through men.  He is a spirit, a single spirit and a 
single person; he has begun and he will never end.  He is the 
immortal part and leader of mankind.  He has motives, he has 
characteristics, he has an aim.  He is by our poor scales of 
measurement boundless love, boundless courage, boundless generosity.  
He is thought and a steadfast will.  He is our friend and brother 
and the light of the world.  That briefly is the belief of the 
modern mind with regard to God.  There is no very novel idea about 
this God, unless it be the idea that he had a beginning.  This is 
the God that men have sought and found in all ages, as God or as the 
Messiah or the Saviour.  The finding of him is salvation from the 
purposelessness of life.  The new religion has but disentangled the 
idea of him from the absolutes and infinities and mysteries of the 
Christian theologians; from mythological virgin births and the 
cosmogonies and intellectual pretentiousness of a vanished age.
<P>
Modern religion appeals to no revelation, no authoritative teaching, 
no mystery.  The statement it makes is, it declares, a mere 
statement of what we may all perceive and experience.  We all live 
in the storm of life, we all find our understandings limited by the 
Veiled Being; if we seek salvation and search within for God, 
presently we find him.  All this is in the nature of things.  If 
every one who perceives and states it were to be instantly killed 
and blotted out, presently other people would find their way to the 
same conclusions; and so on again and again.  To this all true 
religion, casting aside its hulls of misconception, must ultimately 
come.  To it indeed much religion is already coming.  Christian 
thought struggles towards it, with the millstones of Syrian theology 
and an outrageous mythology of incarnation and resurrection about 
its neck.  When at last our present bench of bishops join the early 
fathers of the church in heaven there will be, I fear, a note of 
reproach in their greeting of the ingenious person who saddled them 
with OMNIPOTENS.  Still more disastrous for them has been the virgin 
birth, with the terrible fascination of its detail for unpoetic 
minds.  How rich is the literature of authoritative Christianity 
with decisions upon the continuing virginity of Mary and the 
virginity of Joseph--ideas that first arose in Arabia as a Moslem 
gloss upon Christianity--and how little have these peepings and 
pryings to do with the needs of the heart and the finding of God!
<P>
Within the last few years there have been a score or so of such 
volumes as that recently compiled by Dr. Foakes Jackson, entitled 
"The Faith and the War," a volume in which the curious reader may 
contemplate deans and canons, divines and church dignitaries, men 
intelligent and enquiring and religiously disposed, all lying like 
overladen camels, panting under this load of obsolete theological 
responsibility, groaning great articles, outside the needle's eye 
that leads to God.
<P>
<P>
<P>
6. THE COMING OF GOD
<P>
<P>
Modern religion bases its knowledge of God and its account of God 
entirely upon experience.  It has encountered God.  It does not 
argue about God; it relates.  It relates without any of those 
wrappings of awe and reverence that fold so necessarily about 
imposture, it relates as one tells of a friend and his assistance, 
of a happy adventure, of a beautiful thing found and picked up by 
the wayside.
<P>
So far as its psychological phases go the new account of personal 
salvation tallies very closely with the account of "conversion" as 
it is given by other religions.  It has little to tell that is not 
already familiar to the reader of William James's "Varieties of 
Religious Experience."  It describes an initial state of distress 
with the aimlessness and cruelties of life, and particularly with 
the futility of the individual life, a state of helpless self-
disgust, of inability to form any satisfactory plan of living.  This 
is the common prelude known to many sorts of Christian as 
"conviction of sin"; it is, at any rate, a conviction of hopeless 
confusion. . . .  Then in some way the idea of God comes into the 
distressed mind, at first simply as an idea, without substance or 
belief.  It is read about or it is remembered; it is expounded by 
some teacher or some happy convert.  In the case of all those of the 
new faith with whose personal experience I have any intimacy, the 
idea of God has remained for some time simply as an idea floating 
about in a mind still dissatisfied.  God is not believed in, but it 
is realised that if there were such a being he would supply the 
needed consolation and direction, his continuing purpose would knit 
together the scattered effort of life, his immortality would take 
the sting from death.  Under this realisation the idea is pursued 
and elaborated.  For a time there is a curious resistance to the 
suggestion that God is truly a person; he is spoken of preferably by 
such phrases as the Purpose in Things, as the Racial Consciousness, 
as the Collective Mind.
<P>
I believe that this resistance in so many contemporary minds to the 
idea of God as a person is due very largely to the enormous 
prejudice against divine personality created by the absurdities of 
the Christian teaching and the habitual monopoly of the Christian 
idea.  The picture of Christ as the Good Shepherd thrusts itself 
before minds unaccustomed to the idea that they are lambs.  The 
cross in the twilight bars the way.  It is a novelty and an enormous 
relief to such people to realise that one may think of God without 
being committed to think of either the Father, the Son, or the Holy 
Ghost, or of all of them at once.  That freedom had not seemed 
possible to them.  They had been hypnotised and obsessed by the idea 
that the Christian God is the only thinkable God.  They had heard so 
much about that God and so little of any other.  With that release 
their minds become, as it were, nascent and ready for the coming of 
God.
<P>
Then suddenly, in a little while, in his own time, God comes.  This 
cardinal experience is an undoubting, immediate sense of God.  It is 
the attainment of an absolute certainty that one is not alone in 
oneself.  It is as if one was touched at every point by a being akin 
to oneself, sympathetic, beyond measure wiser, steadfast and pure in 
aim.  It is completer and more intimate, but it is like standing 
side by side with and touching someone that we love very dearly and 
trust completely.  It is as if this being bridged a thousand 
misunderstandings and brought us into fellowship with a great 
multitude of other people. . . .
<P>
"Closer he is than breathing, and nearer than hands and feet."
<P>
The moment may come while we are alone in the darkness, under the 
stars, or while we walk by ourselves or in a crowd, or while we sit 
and muse.  It may come upon the sinking ship or in the tumult of the 
battle.  There is no saying when it may not come to us. . . .  But 
after it has come our lives are changed, God is with us and there is 
no more doubt of God.  Thereafter one goes about the world like one 
who was lonely and has found a lover, like one who was perplexed and 
has found a solution.  One is assured that there is a Power that 
fights with us against the confusion and evil within us and without.  
There comes into the heart an essential and enduring happiness and 
courage.
<P>
There is but one God, there is but one true religious experience, 
but under a multitude of names, under veils and darknesses, God has 
in this manner come into countless lives.  There is scarcely a 
faith, however mean and preposterous, that has not been a way to 
holiness.  God who is himself finite, who himself struggles in his 
great effort from strength to strength, has no spite against error.  
Far beyond halfway he hastens to meet the purblind.  But God is 
against the darkness in their eyes.  The faith which is returning to 
men girds at veils and shadows, and would see God plainly.  It has 
little respect for mysteries.  It rends the veil of the temple in 
rags and tatters.  It has no superstitious fear of this huge 
friendliness, of this great brother and leader of our little beings.  
To find God is but the beginning of wisdom, because then for all our 
days we have to learn his purpose with us and to live our lives with 
him.
