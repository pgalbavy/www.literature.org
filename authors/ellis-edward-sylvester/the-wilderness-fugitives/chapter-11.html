<p>Ned pressed the pole into the bottom of the river, which was
so far below that only a few feet of the stick remained above
the surface, and he was forced to lean over the side of the craft
to secure any leverage. Any one who has tried it knows that it
is next to impossible to accomplish much under similar circumstances,
and the young scout was of the opinion that he was not making
any progress at all toward the other shore.</p>

<p>"We are in the deepest part," said Jo, with a view of encouraging
him.</p>

<p>"And it looks as if we were going to stay there," replied Ned,
straining and pushing at his work.</p>

<p>"This deep part must be very narrow, and you'll soon be over
it."</p>

<p>"That's the trouble," said his friend, with a laugh, "I am over
it, and don't see that there is much prospect of my getting anywhere
else."</p>

<p>Still he worked and toiled at the greatest possible disadvantage,
the swaying of the boat frequently causing it to baffle all his
efforts to move onward. Several times, when he braced his shoulders,
the craft would sag against the pole with such force as almost
to wrench it from his grasp.</p>

<p>"Keep heart," called out Jo. "I think you are gaining."</p>

<p>"In which way?"</p>

<p>"We're a few inches nearer the southern shore than we were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"When we started," interrupted Ned, showing a very modest estimate
of his own abilities in the way of managing the craft.</p>

<p>Jo rose and went to the side of his friend, hoping that he might
be of assistance, for he clearly needed something of the kind.</p>

<p>"Let me take hold," said he, "or we are stuck, as sure as you
live."</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can be of any help to me," answered Ned,
who would have been glad enough to receive it, if there was any
direction in which it could be applied. "You notice the trouble
is that it so deep just here, and the current so strong, that
it bothers a fellow amazingly. Now, if you will get overboard
and push the stern you will do some good, but I don't see that
you are going to amount to anything in any other way."</p>

<p>"Then I rather calculate that I won't amount to anything at all,"
was the sensible conclusion of the other, as he returned to his
place beside his sister and the Mohawk.</p>

<p>There was reason to believe that the labors of Ned Clinton were
not entirely in vain, even though they were not encouraging. The
boat was certainly progressing, and the height of the pole above
the water showed that the depth was less by a few inches than
before.</p>

<p>It must continue to diminish, and as it did so, the boatman would
gain, in a corresponding degree, his control of the craft. A few
minutes after this the truth became apparent to Ned himself, and
he toiled all the harder, until he regained, in a great degree,
his mastery over the scow.</p>

<p>"Whew!" he exclaimed, as he paused a moment to catch breath.
"I feel like giving a hurrah for me!"</p>

<p>"You deserve a great deal of credit," said Rosa, "I thought several
times you had undertaken something more than you could accomplish.
But you stuck to it bravely, and if it was only safe, I should
like to hear a cheer for you."</p>

<p>"Very well; we'll consider it given."</p>

<p>"If you wait much longer with that pole doing nothing," added
Rosa, looking down stream as she spoke, "I think we'll arrive
opposite the fort, where some of the Iroquois will be sure to
see us."</p>

<p>Once more the pole was thrust against the bottom, and immediately
the craft responded to the impulse, and all felt high hopes of
making the other bank in a few minutes.</p>

<p>While the light talk was going on, the Mohawk was scanning the
shore they were approaching, for it was all-important that they
should strike it at some point where none of their enemies could
see them. Several times he hushed his companions when they were
talking in too unrestrained a manner, for the sound of anything
can be heard a long distance over the water on a still summer
night, and there was danger of being betrayed in that way. The
party had advanced so far by this time, that the outline of the
bank was dimly discerned ahead of them. It was nothing more than
a heavy wall of shadow, showing where the trees came down to the
edge of the water, but it was the kind of shore they wanted to
see.</p>

<p>"Let me take a hand," said Jo, as he stepped up beside his friend.
"You must be pretty well tired out by this time."</p>

<p>"I can take the old scow to the land as well as not, but, as
you haven't had anything to do since we started, I'll let you
try it awhile."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Jo pressed the pole against the hard bottom of the
Susquehanna, and the progress continued without interruption until
some half a dozen rods were passed, when operations were suddenly
checked by the Mohawk uttering his warning aspiration:</p>

<p>"'Sh!"</p>

<p>This was as effective as if he had called out in a loud voice
that the Iroquois were upon them. Jo paused on the instant, and
like the rest glanced at the Indian to learn what it meant. Up
to that moment all, with the exception of him who managed the
pole, were seated on the gunwale, but the Mohawk, at the instant
of uttering the exclamation, rose to his feet, and was seen to
be looking toward the land which was their destination. Since
this placed his back toward his friends, they could only gaze
in the same direction in quest of the cause of his alarm.</p>

<p>At first they saw nothing, but in a few seconds the explanation
came in the shape of a light, which resembled a torch carried
in the hands of some one who was walking along the edge of the
water. As this light showed itself near the spot at which they
were aiming, it was high time they halted. The whole party, gazing
in the direction of the strange illumination, made an interesting
tableau while drifting down the river. The torch&mdash;if such it was&mdash;continued
visible but a few seconds, when it vanished as if plunged into
the water.</p>

<p>Here was another unexpected interference with their plans, and
the old feeling of doubt came to the heart of Rosa Minturn, when
she recalled the extraordinary delay that had attended their attempts
to get to Fort Wilkesbarre, and now when her hopes were high,
and they were actually in sight of the shore, this mysterious
light had come to warn them off.</p>

<p>Lena-Wingo did not stand idle long when they were confronted
by such danger, but turning about, stepped hastily back to where
Jo was awaiting the word of command, and took the pole from him.</p>

<p>"Must go back &mdash;Iroquois heard us coming&mdash;watch for us."</p>

<p>More than one heart sank as these words were uttered, for all
felt that it was a bad omen thus to turn back, when they were
so near the land they were seeking. There was another fact which
was equally apparent, and which caused them no very pleasant reflection.
They had very likely betrayed themselves by their own indiscretion,
in talking in tones that reached the ears of those who were watching
for them. No one was to blame, therefore, but themselves for the
unfortunate situation in which they were placed.</p>

<p>Jo yielded the pole without a murmur, and the Mohawk applied
it with a power and skill that made the retrogression much faster
than was the progress in the other direction. When the deepest
portion of the channel was reached, Lena-Wingo used the implement
with a great deal more cleverness than Ned Clinton had displayed,
and it was crossed in considerably less time than before. Then,
as the more shallow water came, and the craft was quite manageable,
the Mohawk stopped work, and holding the pole motionless and motioning
his friends not to speak or move, he listened, they also using
their eyes and ears to the best of their ability.</p>
