<p>It is hard to believe what seems impossible. And yet what seems
impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one
else. So it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible
just because you cannot understand how it can be. Peter Rabbit
wanted to believe what Lightfoot the Deer had just told him, but
somehow he couldn't. If he had seen those antlers growing, it
would have been another matter. But he hadn't seen Lightfoot since
the very last of winter, and then Lightfoot had worn just such
handsome antlers as he now had. So Peter really couldn't be blamed
for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost
and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months of
spring and summer.</p>

<p>But Peter didn't blame Lightfoot in the least, because he had
told Peter that he didn't like to tell things to people who wouldn't
believe what he told them when Peter had asked him about the rags
hanging to his antlers. "I'm trying to believe it," he said, quite
humbly.</p>

<p>"It's all true," broke in another voice.</p>

<p>Peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin, Jumper the Hare.
Unseen and unheard, he had stolen up and had overheard what Peter
and Lightfoot had said.</p>

<p>"How do you know it is true?" snapped Peter a little crossly,
for Jumper had startled him.</p>

<p>"Because I saw Lightfoot's old antlers after they had fallen
off, and I often saw Lightfoot while his new ones were growing,"
retorted Jumper.</p>

<p>"All right! I'll believe anything that Lightfoot tells me if
you say it is true," declared Peter, who greatly admires his cousin,
Jumper. "Now tell me about those rags, Lightfoot. Please do."</p>

<p>Lightfoot couldn't resist that "please." "Those rags are what
is left of a kind of covering which protected the antlers while
they were growing, as I told you before," said he. "Very soon
after my old ones dropped off the new ones began to grow. They
were not hard, not at all like they are now. They were soft and
very tender, and the blood ran through them just as it does through
our bodies. They were covered with a sort of skin with hairs on
it like thin fur. The ends were not sharply pointed as they now
are, but were big and rounded, like knobs. They were not like
antlers at all, and they made my head hot and were very uncomfortable.
That is why I hid away. They grew very fast, so fast that every
day I could see by looking at my reflection in water that they
were a little longer. It seemed to me sometimes as if all my strength
went into those new antlers. And I had to be very careful not
to hit them against anything. In the first place it would have
hurt, and in the second place it might have spoiled the shape
of them.</p>

<p>"When they had grown to the length you now see, they began to
shrink and grow hard. The knobs on the ends shrank until they
became pointed. As soon as they stopped growing the blood stopped
flowing up in them, and as they became hard they were no longer
tender. The skin which had covered them grew dry and split, and
I rubbed it off on trees and bushes. The little rags you see are
what is left, but I will soon be rid of those. Then I shall be
ready to fight if need be and will fear no one save man, and will
fear him only when he has a terrible gun with him."</p>

<p>Lightfoot tossed his head proudly and rattled his wonderful antlers
against the nearest tree. "Isn't he handsome," whispered Peter
to Jumper the Hare; "and did you ever hear of anything so wonderful
as the growing of those new antlers in such a short time? It is
hard to believe, but I suppose it must be true."</p>

<p>"It is," replied Jumper, "and I tell you, Peter, I would hate
to have Lightfoot try those antlers on me, even though I were
big as a man. You've always thought of Lightfoot as timid and
afraid, but you should see him when he is angry. Few people care
to face him then."</p>
