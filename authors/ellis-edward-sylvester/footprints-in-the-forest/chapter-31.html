<p>Deerfoot the Shawanoe made known only a few of the thoughts which
troubled him, when he hurried Jack Carleton and Otto Relstaub
forward with orders to make no tarrying (except to cover their
footprints), until they should reach the distant ridge, where,
as I have stated, he hoped to join them.</p>

<p>But the conviction had come upon him that afternoon, that the
crisis of the long hunt was at hand, and that success or failure,
absolute and entire, was near. It will be admitted that they had
been in situations of apparently much greater danger, but there
was "something in the air" which foretold stirring events.</p>

<p>While he said nothing of the absence of Hay-uta the Sauk, he
was uneasy over it. His own delay was meant to be as much in his
interest as in that of the boys. If it should prove that the Sauk
needed the help of Deerfoot, the latter wished to be free to give
it, and that could not be done so long as the care of the boys
was on his hands. When they were out of the way, nothing could
interfere with the marvelous woodcraft of the young Shawanoe.</p>

<p>The first point which Deerfoot established, so far as it was
possible to do so, was that the four Pawnees, with whom they had
come in collision, were the only ones who had reached the neighborhood.
The others were near the river, where they were first seen by
our friends. The Shawanoe interpreted the reason of this state
of affairs to be that, brave as the Pawnees were, the majority
were unwilling to pursue their enemies further. They had eagerly
crossed the river to engage in the fight, but, learning that the
Evil One and two companions were moving toward their distant hunting
grounds, as though indifferent to pursuit, they came to the conclusion
that they had had enough of the business, and refused to go further.</p>

<p>But among the party were four, who either were braver, or were
impelled by a more rancorous hatred, for, as we have learned,
they pressed toward the ridge, overtook the fugitives, and paid
the penalty of their rashness by losing two of their number. The
other couple fled in wild haste down the slope, and one of them
never paused until he rejoined his comrades, to whom he told his
terrifying tale. The fourth stopped when he had run a short distance,
and, after a brief rest, began making his way back to the ridge
again.</p>

<p>It probably occurred to him that, since their enemies would not
believe it possible for any of the Pawnees to return so soon,
then was the opportunity to do effective work, and to get safely
away. Accordingly he made his way with great care through the
woods to the ridge, from which he had just fled in such mortal
fear.</p>

<p>The return of this Pawnee (who was the one held captive by Deerfoot
and Hay-uta the night before), was executed with such skill, that
the Shawanoe learned nothing of it. He believed none of the hostiles
was near, though he acted as though he suspected the contrary.</p>

<p>Deerfoot now devoted himself to finding Hay-uta. He emitted several
signals, such as the two were accustomed to use, and he was disturbed
because they brought no reply. Knowing the territory given his
friend, he decided to make search through it. Possibly some accident
had befallen him and he needed help.</p>

<p>Fortunately Deerfoot had not hunted long when he was more successful
than he expected to be. He caught sight of Hay-uta, who was sitting
on the ground with his back against a rock, his arms folded, and
his gaze fixed on the western horizon, toward which the sun was
sinking. His fine rifle was leaning against the rock beside him,
and his other weapons were in place.</p>

<p>The position of Deerfoot was such that he had a view of the face
of the Sauk, and it took him but a moment to understand the meaning
of the action, or, rather, want of action on the part of his dusky
friend. Many days before Deerfoot had spoken strange words to
the Sauk whom he vanquished; they were words that lingered in
his memory, and finally sent him in quest of the youth, that he
might learn more of their wondrous meaning. He had sought and
had obtained that knowledge, and its length and breadth and depth
were so infinite, that at times it mastered the warrior, who gave
himself up to meditation until he lost consciousness of every
thing else.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was half tempted to smile when he reflected that the
vigilant Sauk, while engaged on a delicate duty, had forgotten
all about it, even to the personal danger involved. Reflecting
on the new and divine revelation, he had sat down where he believed
he was not likely to be disturbed, and given himself wholly up
to the sacred joy of the hour.</p>

<p>While he sat thus guns were fired, shouts were uttered, and signals
were sent out that were intended for his ear alone, but he was
no more conscious of them, than if he had been wrapped in slumber
a hundred miles distant. No statue in bronze could have been more
immovable than he.</p>

<p>Viewing the countenance of the Sauk, Deerfoot noticed the radiant
light which seemed to glow through every feature, and which told
of the great peace that was brooding in his heart.</p>

<p>O blessed hope! as free to the beggar at the gate as to the master
within the palace; to the sinking mariner, as to the sceptered
king; to the savage in the depths of his own solitudes, as to
those who listen to the silver chimes of magnificent churches;
thou art free to every man, woman and child, and to the uttermost
islands of the sea! Beneficent Father! thine ear is ever open,
and thine hand is ever stretched forth to save the perishing everywhere!</p>

<p>Deerfoot stood lower down the slope, where he instinctively screened
himself behind a tree. He was watching the face of his friend,
when he became aware that another individual was similarly employed.</p>

<p>Still lower down the slope, and about the same distance from
Hay-uta as was Deerfoot, a Pawnee warrior, who was creeping along
noiselessly, rose to the upright position. He was bent so low
at first that Deerfoot failed to see him; but when he straightened
up behind the trunk of a tree, the Shawanoe shrank back a few
inches, so as to hide himself. Then he watched the Pawnee, who
was less than a hundred feet distant.</p>

<p>The first sight showed Deerfoot that he was the warrior whom
he and Hay-uta captured the night before, and who was given his
liberty by them. More properly it was given to him by Hay-uta,
who, you remember, played the part of Pocahontas to Captain John
Smith. The whole thing was a scheme of the Sauk, who hoped thereby
to make a "friend at court", and to secure an ally who would give
them help in their quest for Otto Relstaub.</p>

<p>The Pawnee, therefore, saw before him the party who, he must
have believed, saved his life, when the captive was in such despair
that he sang his death-song, and bowed his head to receive the
crashing blow of the upraised tomahawk. Common gratitude would
have bound the Pawnee to his preserver for life.</p>

<p>The red man must have been puzzled when he observed the abstraction
of the warrior, but without losing time in studying the question,
he cocked his rifle and slowly brought it to his shoulder, keeping
his eyes fixed on the warrior up the ridge, whose arms were still
folded, and who was gazing vacantly in the direction of the setting
sun. There could be no mistake about it: the Pawnee meant to slay
the Sauk.</p>

<p>But while the treacherous wretch was making his preparations,
Deerfoot, with silent dexterity, fitted an arrow to the string
of his bow. The Pawnee was within easy range, and, before the
latter could bring his gun to a level, the Shawanoe with his unerring
left hand drew back the string of his weapon. The sight of the
hostile seeking the life of the Sauk who had befriended him, stirred
the heart of Deerfoot to a fury which he rarely felt. He had seen
ingratitude before, but rarely was he moved as by the sight before
him.</p>

<p>Confident of his aim, he meant to drive the shaft with such force,
that, unless stopped by some bone, it would pass clean through
and beyond the body of the Pawnee, who, unconscious of his own
peril, made his preparations with a deliberation which showed
an almost inconceivable depth of hatred.</p>

<p>"Dog of the Pawnee!" muttered the Shawanoe; "you shall have no
time to chant your death song this time!"</p>

<p>The arrow was drawn almost to a head, but in his anger Deerfoot
give it a quick pull, as expressive of the fierceness of his wrath.
As he did so, a sharp, splitting sound was heard, and the center
of his closed palm felt as if pierced by a hundred needles.</p>

<p>The bow which had never failed him before had splintered in the
middle, and the poised arrow dropped to the ground, its nerveless
point falling between the moccasins of the astounded Deerfoot,
who realized the full effect of the awful accident.</p>
