<p>It will be admitted that the little party of fugitives whose
fortunes we are following displayed great skill in escaping the
Tories and Indians, who, on that "day of desolation," wrought
such ruin in the Wyoming Valley.</p>

<p>A wonderful good fortune attended them up to a certain point,
and yet the humiliating truth must also be admitted, that, from
the moment they rushed pell mell into the friendly cavern in the
rocks, they were outgeneraled by the Senecas, under the leadership
of the Tory, Jake Golcher.</p>

<p>It looked, for a time, as if the success of the patriots was
to be crowned by the most brilliant achievement of all, in stealing
out of the ravine under the very noses, so to speak, of their
vigilant enemies; and yet, despite their caution and well-directed
audacity, which never overreached themselves, every movement,
even to the slightest, was known to the redskins, who carried
out their own scheme with even greater subtlety and skill.</p>

<p>When Fred Godfrey reached the ground above he detected nothing
suspicious, and, making the vine secure, turned and signaled to
his friends to follow him.</p>

<p>It was at that instant he was seized by two powerful warriors,
one of whom threw his arm about his neck, and jerking his head
back, nearly strangled him. The lieutenant was caught at such
disadvantage that he was helpless, but he struggled with all the
strength possible, and attempted to utter a cry of warning to
his friends.</p>

<p>But his hands were pinioned behind him, a dusky palm was glued
over his mouth, and some one said in very good English:</p>

<p>"If you speak a word, you're a dead man!"</p>

<p>He was dragged back into the wood, where his wrists and elbows
were tied with as much care as if he were worth all the other
prisoners taken that day in Wyoming.</p>

<p>It required but a few seconds to complete this performance, and
while it was going on two other Senecas were tugging away at the
vine, to which Mr. Brainerd was clinging.</p>

<p>The old gentleman was altogether unsuspicious, and he came sprawling
over on the ground with considerable emphasis.</p>

<p>"I don't see the necessity of yanking a fellow out of his boots,"
he laughed, in a guarded voice. "It will hardly do to be so ardent
with the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that point in his remarks he was pounced upon, and served
very nearly the same as his son. He fought as fiercely: but the
Indians were prepared for it. He was run back in the wood behind
the lieutenant, and the two condoled with each other&mdash;their chagrin
being inexpressible.</p>

<p>Then came Aunt Peggy, whose figure was so light compared with
that of Mr. Brainerd, that she was literally whisked to the top
of the ground, seeming to drop from some point above.</p>

<p>"Maggie said there was something wrong," remarked the voluble
lady; "but I'm sure there wasn't anything very queer that I heard
If there are any of them Injins anywhere in the neighborhood I'd
just like the chance&mdash;"</p>

<p>The wish of the lady was gratified, for at that moment two figures
appeared beside her, as if they had sprung through a trap-door:
and one, who was gifted with an exceptional amount of waggery,
actually leaned over and kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>"You scand'lous villain!" gasped Aunt Peggy, too much horrified
to speak above a whisper: "ain't you ashamed of yourself?"</p>

<p>With which exclamation she struck him on the side of the face,
with a vicious vigor that gave out a report like the crack of
a pistol.</p>

<p>"I'll teach you how to insult a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her words were stopped at this point by a dusky hand that was
pressed over her mouth and held there despite her frantic struggles,
and she was forced back to where her two friends were prisoners.</p>

<p>Maggie Brainerd went up the rocks with much distrust, as will
be remembered, and, as it was, she was so suspicious that she
would not have gone at all but for the fact that father and brother
had preceded her, and no matter what their fate must be, she wished
to share it with them.</p>

<p>"If they have fallen into the hands of the Indians, I have no
wish to remain away from them."</p>

<p>She peered into the gloom as sharply as she could and was not
kept in suspense.</p>

<p>She offered no resistance, and quickly joined those who were
overtaken by disaster.</p>

<p>It was much the same with Eva, although she struggled with great
energy and narrowly escaped violence, as did Aunt Peggy, when
she chastised the audacious Seneca.</p>

<p>Habakkuk McEwen, as we have stated, was in a quandary, but he
ascended, his feet going over the ledge first. Such an approach
to a foe is not disquieting, and he was caught at greater disadvantage
than any of the others.</p>

<p>He tried hard to throw himself over the rocks, but was prevented;
and thus it was that the capture of the entire party was completed.</p>

<p>"Great CÃ¦sar!" exclaimed Habakkuk, as he joined his friends.
"The height, and length, and breadth, and depth of this failure
is the most stupend'us I ever heerd tell of."</p>

<p>And no one said him nay.</p>
