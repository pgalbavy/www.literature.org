<p>As nearly as can be ascertained, Jack Carleton lay the major
part of four days in the Indian lodge, sick nigh unto death, with
his brain topsy turvy. During that time he never received a drop
of medicine, and scarcely any attention. The chief was gone most
of each day, and the squaw spent many hours out doors, looking
after her "farm." When the patient became unusually wild, she
would give him a drink of water and attend to his wants. A few
of the Indians peeped through the door, but as a whole they showed
surprising indifference to the fate of the captive. Had he died,
it is not likely he would have been given even Indian burial.</p>

<p>Several times the Medicine Man put in an appearance, and danced
and hooted and sounded his rattles about the lodge, after which
he took himself off and would not be seen again for many hours.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, while Jack was lying motionless on his bison
skin and looking up to the composite roof, his full reason returned
to him. Indeed, his brain appeared to have been clarified by the
scorching ordeal through which it had passed, and he saw things
with crystalline clearness. Turning his head, he found he was
alone in the lodge, and, as nearly as he could judge, the afternoon
was half gone. The fire had died out, but the room was quite warm,
showing there had been a rise of temperature since the night of
the rain. Peering through the crevices nearest him, he observed
the sunlight was shining, and could catch twinkling glimpses of
Indians moving hither and thither; but there was no outcry or
unusual noise, and business was moving along in its accustomed
channel.</p>

<p>With some trepidation and misgiving, Jack rose on his elbow and
then carefully assumed the sitting position. Every vestige of
dizziness had fled, and his head was as clear as a bell. He was
sensible, too, of a faint and increasing desire for food; but
he was equally conscious that he was very weak, and it must be
days before he could recover his normal strength.</p>

<p>After sitting for a few minutes, he threw the bison skin from
him, and rose to his feet. Having held the prone position so long,
he felt decidedly queer when he stood erect once more. But he
walked back and forth, and knew within himself that the crisis
of his illness had passed and he was convalescent.</p>

<p>Of course it was Jack's vigorous constitution and the recuperating
power of nature which, under Heaven, brought him round. The medicine
man had no more to do with his recovery than have many of our
modern medicine men, who, sit beside the gasping patient, feel
his pulse, look at his tongue and experiment with the credulous
dupe.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton possessed enough sense to appreciate his condition.
Very little sickness had he ever known in life, but there had
been plenty of it around him, and his mother was one of those
nurses, whose knowledge far exceeded that of the ordinary physician,
and whose presence in the sick room is of itself a balm and blessing.</p>

<p>The boy knew, therefore, from what he had learned from her, that
the time had come when he must be extremely careful what he ate
and how he conducted himself. Moving over to the unattractive
table, he found some scraps of meat left. They were partly cooked,
but likely as good for him as anything could have been. He ate
considerable, chewing it finely, and finding his appetite satisfied
much sooner than he anticipated.</p>

<p>But that for which Jack longed above everything else was a plunge
in the cool water. His underclothing sorely needed changing, and
he would have been absolutely happy could he have been in the
hands of his tidy mother if only for a brief while.</p>

<p>However, there was no help for him, and he could only wait and
hope for better things. After he had resumed his seat on the bison
skins, a project took shape in his mind, which was certainly a
wise and prudent one, with promises of good results. Knowing he
was recovering rapidly, he resolved to keep the fact from his
captors. While still gaining strength and vigor, he would feign
weakness and illness, on the watch for a chance that was sure
to come sooner or later, and which he would thus be able to improve
to the utmost.</p>

<p>Convalescence revived with ten-fold force the desire to end his
Indian captivity and return home. Uncertain as he was of the time
that had passed since starting on his hunt, he knew that it was
long enough to awaken the most poignant anguish on the part of
his loved mother, who must suffer far more, before, under the
most favorable circumstances, he could return.</p>

<p>When it was growing dark, Ogallah and his squaw entered. The
latter quickly had the fire going and, as its glow filled the
room, both looked inquiringly at the patient on the other side
the lodge. He in turn assumed, so far as it was possible, the
appearance of a person in the last collapse, and took care that
the expression of his countenance should show no more intelligence
and vivacity than that of an idiot.</p>

<p>The couple exchanged a few words, probably referring to Jack,
but they seemed to care little for him, and he was glad that he
excited so slight interest, since they were less likely to suspect
the deception he was practicing upon them. The squaw, after cooking
the meat, brought a piece over to Jack, who stared in an absurd
fashion before shaking his head, and she turned about and resumed
her place by the table, after which she lit her pipe and squatted
near the fire.</p>

<p>The patient soon fell into a refreshing sleep, which lasted until
it began growing light, when he awoke, feeling so well that it
was hard to keep from leaping in the air with a shout, and dashing
out doors. He was sure that he could hold his own in a game of
<em>gah-haw-ge</em>, if the chance were only given.</p>

<p>But he resolutely forced down his bounding spirits, though he
could not suppress the feeling of hunger which was fast assuming
a ravenous intensity. When the squaw offered him a half cooked
piece of meat, he snatched at it with such wolf-like fierceness
that the squaw recoiled with a grunt of dismay. Jack made sure
he had secured the prize, when he devoured every particle, which
luckily was enough fully to satisfy his appetite.</p>

<p>Whenever the boy saw the chief or his squaw looking at him, he
assumed the role of a dunce, and it must be confessed he played
it with unquestionable fidelity to nature. He probably afforded
considerable amusement to the royal couple who could have had
no suspicion that the hopeful youth was essaying a part.</p>

<p>When the forenoon was well along, the chief and his squaw went
out, the latter probably to do the manual labor, while the former
occupied himself with "sitting around" and criticising the style
in which she ran the agricultural department of the household.
The dog rose, stretched, yawned and then lay down again and resumed
his slumber. Jack was meditating what was best to do, when the
door was pushed aside, and the frightful-looking Medicine Man
crouched to the middle of the lodge and glared at the patient,
who looked calmly back again, as though he felt no special interest
in him or anything else, but all the same Jack watched him with
more entertainment than he had ever felt before.</p>

<p>First of all, the man with the horns and rattles, took amazingly
long steps on the toes of his moccasins around the apartment between
the two "columns" which supported the roof, as though afraid of
awaking the baby. At the end of each circumambulation, he would
squat like a frog about to leap off the bank into the water, and
glare at the boy, the corners of whose mouth were twitching with
laughter at the grotesque performance.</p>

<p>When tired of this, the Medicine Man stopped in the middle of
the apartment, and all at once began using his rattles to the
utmost, and dancing with the vigor of a howling dervish. He accompanied,
or rather added to the racket, by a series of "hooh-hoohs!" which
were not loud, but exceedingly dismal in their effect.</p>

<p>The sudden turmoil awoke the canine, which raised his head, and
surveying the scene for a moment, rose, as if in disgust, and
started to trot outdoors to escape the annoyance. As he did so,
he passed directly behind the Medicine Man, who, of course, did
not see him. At the proper moment he made a backward leap, struck
both legs against the dog, and then tumbled over him on his back,
with his heels pointing toward the roof. The angered pup, with
a yelp of pain and rage, turned about, inserted his teeth in the
most favorable part of the body, and then limped out of the wigwam
with a few more cries, expressive of his feelings. The Medicine
Man gave one frenzied kick and screech as the teeth of the canine
sank into his flesh, and, scrambling to his feet, dashed out of
the lodge with no thought of the dignity belonging to his exalted
character.</p>

<p>Jack Carleton rolled over on his back and laughed till the tears
ran down his cheeks and he could scarcely breathe. It was the
funniest scene on which he had ever looked, and the reaction,
following his long mental depression, shook him from head to foot
with mirth, as he had never been shaken before. He could not have
restrained himself had his life been at stake. After awhile, he
would rub the tears from his eyes, and break forth again, until,
absolutely, he could laugh no more.</p>

<p>Laughter is one of the best tonics in the world, and that which
convulsed Jack Carleton was the very medicine he needed. Though
still weak, he felt so well that he could not have felt better.</p>

<p>"I've no business here," he exclaimed, coming sharply to the
upright position and running his fingers through his hair in a
business-like fashion; "every nerve in my body is just yearning
for the cool breath of the woods, and I feel as though I could
run and tumble over the mountains all day and feel the better
for it. But I must keep it up till the way opens."</p>

<p>After thinking over the matter, he decided to venture outside.
Rising to his feet, he walked briskly to the door, pulled the
skin aside and passed out, immediately assuming the manner and
style of a boy who was barely able to walk and then only with
the greatest pain.</p>

<p>He expected a crowd would instantly gather around him, but he
actually limped all the way to the spring without attracting any
special attention. It was inevitable that a number should see
him, and two youngsters called out something, but he made no response
and they forebore to molest him further.</p>

<p>"If I should meet that chap that has found out he can't wrestle
as well as he thought he could, he will hardly be able to keep
his hands off me. Maybe he would find he had made another mistake,
and maybe it would be I who was off my reckoning. However, I've
my knife with me, and I will use that on him if there is any need
of it, but I hope there won't be."</p>

<p>The water tasted deliciously cool and pure, and he bathed his
hands and face again and again in it. He longed to take a plunge
into the river, but that would have been impolitic, and he restrained
the yearning until a more convenient season should offer.</p>

<p>Jack finally turned about and began plodding homeward, his eyes
and ears open for all that could be seen and heard. It was a clear
warm day, and the village was unusually quiet. Some of the squaws
were working with their primitive hoes, the children were frolicking
along the edge of the wood, where the shade protected them from
the sun, and the warriors were lolling within the tepees or among
the trees. More than likely the major part of the large boys were
hunting or fishing.</p>

<p>Sure enough, Jack was still beyond the limits of the village,
when he saw his old antagonist walking toward him. The Indian
lad was alone, but several squaws and warriors were watching his
movements, as though he had promised them some lively proceedings.
Jack noticed that his nose had assumed its normal proportions,
from which he concluded that more time than was actually the case
had elapsed since he himself was prostrated by illness. The pugnacious
youth advanced in his wary fashion, gradually slackening his gait
until nearly opposite the pale face, who felt that the exigencies
of the situation demanded he should brace up so as to impress
the youth with the peril of attacking him.</p>

<p>While several paces separated the two, the Indian came to a halt,
as if waiting for the other. It would not do to show any timidity,
and, without changing in the least his pace, the pale faced youth
partly drew his knife from his girdle and muttered with a savage
scowl:</p>

<p>"I'm ready for you, young man!"</p>
