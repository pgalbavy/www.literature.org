Since I came to this place I have been very restless, wasting my 
energies in the futile beginning of ill-conceived books.  One does 
not settle down very readily at two and forty to a new way of 
living, and I have found myself with the teeming interests of the 
life I have abandoned still buzzing like a swarm of homeless bees in 
my head.  My mind has been full of confused protests and 
justifications.  In any case I should have found difficulties enough 
in expressing the complex thing I have to tell, but it has added 
greatly to my trouble that I have a great analogue, that a certain 
Niccolo Machiavelli chanced to fall out of politics at very much the 
age I have reached, and wrote a book to engage the restlessness of 
his mind, very much as I have wanted to do.  He wrote about the 
relation of the great constructive spirit in politics to individual 
character and weaknesses, and so far his achievement lies like a 
deep rut in the road of my intention.  It has taken me far astray.  
It is a matter of many weeks now--diversified indeed by some long 
drives into the mountains behind us and a memorable sail to Genoa 
across the blue and purple waters that drowned Shelley--since I 
began a laboured and futile imitation of "The Prince."  I sat up 
late last night with the jumbled accumulation; and at last made a 
little fire of olive twigs and burnt it all, sheet by sheet--to 
begin again clear this morning.
<P>
But incidentally I have re-read most of Machiavelli, not excepting 
those scandalous letters of his to Vettori, and it seems to me, now 
that I have released myself altogether from his literary precedent, 
that he still has his use for me.  In spite of his vast prestige I 
claim kindred with him and set his name upon my title-page, in 
partial intimation of the matter of my story.  He takes me with 
sympathy not only by reason of the dream he pursued and the humanity 
of his politics, but by the mixture of his nature.  His vices come 
in, essential to my issue.  He is dead and gone, all his immediate 
correlations to party and faction have faded to insignificance, 
leaving only on the one hand his broad method and conceptions, and 
upon the other his intimate living personality, exposed down to its 
salacious corners as the soul of no contemporary can ever be 
exposed.  Of those double strands it is I have to write, of the 
subtle protesting perplexing play of instinctive passion and desire 
against too abstract a dream of statesmanship.  But things that 
seemed to lie very far apart in Machiavelli's time have come near to 
one another; it is no simple story of white passions struggling 
against the red that I have to tell.
<P>
The state-making dream is a very old dream indeed in the world's 
history.  It plays too small a part in novels.  Plato and Confucius 
are but the highest of a great host of minds that have had a kindred 
aspiration, have dreamt of a world of men better ordered, happier, 
finer, securer.  They imagined cities grown more powerful and 
peoples made rich and multitudinous by their efforts, they thought 
in terms of harbours and shining navies, great roads engineered 
marvellously, jungles cleared and deserts conquered, the ending of 
muddle and diseases and dirt and misery; the ending of confusions 
that waste human possibilities; they thought of these things with 
passion and desire as other men think of the soft lines and tender 
beauty of women.  Thousands of men there are to-day almost mastered 
by this white passion of statecraft, and in nearly every one who 
reads and thinks you could find, I suspect, some sort of answering 
response.  But in every one it presents itself extraordinarily 
entangled and mixed up with other, more intimate things.
<P>
It was so with Machiavelli.  I picture him at San Casciano as he 
lived in retirement upon his property after the fall of the 
Republic, perhaps with a twinge of the torture that punished his 
conspiracy still lurking in his limbs.  Such twinges could not stop 
his dreaming.  Then it was "The Prince" was written.  All day he 
went about his personal affairs, saw homely neighbours, dealt with 
his family, gave vent to everyday passions.  He would sit in the 
shop of Donato del Corno gossiping curiously among vicious company, 
or pace the lonely woods of his estate, book in hand, full of bitter 
meditations.  In the evening he returned home and went to his study.  
At the entrance, he says, he pulled off his peasant clothes covered 
with the dust and dirt of that immediate life, washed himself, put 
on his "noble court dress," closed the door on the world of toiling 
and getting, private loving, private hating and personal regrets, 
sat down with a sigh of contentment to those wider dreams.
<P>
I like to think of him so, with brown books before him lit by the 
light of candles in silver candlesticks, or heading some new chapter 
of "The Prince," with a grey quill in his clean fine hand.
<P>
So writing, he becomes a symbol for me, and the less none because of 
his animal humour, his queer indecent side, and because of such 
lapses into utter meanness as that which made him sound the note of 
the begging-letter writer even in his "Dedication," reminding His 
Magnificence very urgently, as if it were the gist of his matter, of 
the continued malignity of fortune in his affairs.  These flaws 
complete him.  They are my reason for preferring him as a symbol to 
Plato, of whose indelicate side we know nothing, and whose 
correspondence with Dionysius of Syracuse has perished; or to 
Confucius who travelled China in search of a Prince he might 
instruct, with lapses and indignities now lost in the mists of ages. 
They have achieved the apotheosis of individual forgetfulness, and 
Plato has the added glory of that acquired beauty, that bust of the 
Indian Bacchus which is now indissolubly mingled with his tradition.  
They have passed into the world of the ideal, and every humbug takes 
his freedoms with their names.  But Machiavelli, more recent and 
less popular, is still all human and earthly, a fallen brother--and 
at the same time that nobly dressed and nobly dreaming writer at the 
desk.
<P>
That vision of the strengthened and perfected state is protagonist 
in my story.  But as I re-read "The Prince" and thought out the 
manner of my now abandoned project, I came to perceive how that stir 
and whirl of human thought one calls by way of embodiment the French 
Revolution, has altered absolutely the approach to such a question.  
Machiavelli, like Plato and Pythagoras and Confucius two hundred odd 
decades before him, saw only one method by which a thinking man, 
himself not powerful, might do the work of state building, and that 
was by seizing the imagination of a Prince.  Directly these men 
turned their thoughts towards realisation, their attitudes became--
what shall I call it?--secretarial.  Machiavelli, it is true, had 
some little doubts about the particular Prince he wanted, whether it 
was Caesar Borgia of Giuliano or Lorenzo, but a Prince it had to be.  
Before I saw clearly the differences of our own time I searched my 
mind for the modern equivalent of a Prince.  At various times I 
redrafted a parallel dedication to the Prince of Wales, to the 
Emperor William, to Mr. Evesham, to a certain newspaper proprietor 
who was once my schoolfellow at City Merchants', to Mr. J. D. 
Rockefeller--all of them men in their several ways and circumstances 
and possibilities, princely.  Yet in every case my pen bent of its 
own accord towards irony because--because, although at first I did 
not realise it, I myself am just as free to be a prince.  The appeal 
was unfair.  The old sort of Prince, the old little principality has 
vanished from the world.  The commonweal is one man's absolute 
estate and responsibility no more.  In Machiavelli's time it was 
indeed to an extreme degree one man's affair.  But the days of the 
Prince who planned and directed and was the source and centre of all 
power are ended.  We are in a condition of affairs infinitely more 
complex, in which every prince and statesman is something of a 
servant and every intelligent human being something of a Prince.  No 
magnificent pensive Lorenzos remain any more in this world for 
secretarial hopes.
<P>
In a sense it is wonderful how power has vanished, in a sense 
wonderful how it has increased.  I sit here, an unarmed discredited 
man, at a small writing-table in a little defenceless dwelling among 
the vines, and no human being can stop my pen except by the 
deliberate self-immolation of murdering me, nor destroy its fruits 
except by theft and crime.  No King, no council, can seize and 
torture me; no Church, no nation silence me.  Such powers of 
ruthless and complete suppression have vanished.  But that is not 
because power has diminished, but because it has increased and 
become multitudinous, because it has dispersed itself and 
specialised.  It is no longer a negative power we have, but 
positive; we cannot prevent, but we can do.  This age, far beyond 
all previous ages, is full of powerful men, men who might, if they 
had the will for it, achieve stupendous things.
<P>
The things that might be done to-day!  The things indeed that are 
being done!  It is the latter that give one so vast a sense of the 
former.  When I think of the progress of physical and mechanical 
science, of medicine and sanitation during the last century, when I 
measure the increase in general education and average efficiency, 
the power now available for human service, the merely physical 
increment, and compare it with anything that has ever been at man's 
disposal before, and when I think of what a little straggling, 
incidental, undisciplined and uncoordinated minority of inventors, 
experimenters, educators, writers and organisers has achieved this 
development of human possibilities, achieved it in spite of the 
disregard and aimlessness of the huge majority, and the passionate 
resistance of the active dull, my imagination grows giddy with 
dazzling intimations of the human splendours the justly organised 
state may yet attain.  I glimpse for a bewildering instant the 
heights that may be scaled, the splendid enterprises made possible.
<P>
But the appeal goes out now in other forms, in a book that catches 
at thousands of readers for the eye of a Prince diffused.  It is the 
old appeal indeed for the unification of human effort, the ending of 
confusions, but instead of the Machiavellian deference to a 
flattered lord, a man cries out of his heart to the unseen 
fellowship about him.  The last written dedication of all those I 
burnt last night, was to no single man, but to the socially 
constructive passion--in any man. . . .
<P>
There is, moreover, a second great difference in kind between my 
world and Machiavelli's.  We are discovering women.  It is as if 
they had come across a vast interval since his time, into the very 
chamber of the statesman.
<P>
<P>

<P>
In Machiavelli's outlook the interest of womanhood was in a region 
of life almost infinitely remote from his statecraft.  They were the 
vehicle of children, but only Imperial Rome and the new world of to-
day have ever had an inkling of the significance that might give 
them in the state.  They did their work, he thought, as the ploughed 
earth bears its crops.  Apart from their function of fertility they 
gave a humorous twist to life, stimulated worthy men to toil, and 
wasted the hours of Princes.  He left the thought of women outside 
with his other dusty things when he went into his study to write, 
dismissed them from his mind.  But our modern world is burthened 
with its sense of the immense, now half articulate, significance of 
women.  They stand now, as it were, close beside the silver 
candlesticks, speaking as Machiavelli writes, until he stays his pen 
and turns to discuss his writing with them.
<P>
It is this gradual discovery of sex as a thing collectively 
portentous that I have to mingle with my statecraft if my picture is 
to be true which has turned me at length from a treatise to the 
telling of my own story.  In my life I have paralleled very closely 
the slow realisations that are going on in the world about me.  I 
began life ignoring women, they came to me at first perplexing and 
dishonouring; only very slowly and very late in my life and after 
misadventure, did I gauge the power and beauty of the love of man 
and woman and learnt how it must needs frame a justifiable vision of 
the ordered world.  Love has brought me to disaster, because my 
career had been planned regardless of its possibility and value.  
But Machiavelli, it seems to me, when he went into his study, left 
not only the earth of life outside but its unsuspected soul.
<P>

<P>
Like Machiavelli at San Casciano, if I may take this analogy one 
step further, I too am an exile.  Office and leading are closed to 
me.  The political career that promised so much for me is shattered 
and ended for ever.
<P>
I look out from this vine-wreathed veranda under the branches of a 
stone pine; I see wide and far across a purple valley whose sides 
are terraced and set with houses of pine and ivory, the Gulf of 
Liguria gleaming sapphire blue, and cloud-like baseless mountains 
hanging in the sky, and I think of lank and coaly steamships heaving 
on the grey rollers of the English Channel and darkling streets wet 
with rain, I recall as if I were back there the busy exit from 
Charing Cross, the cross and the money-changers' offices, the 
splendid grime of giant London and the crowds going perpetually to 
and fro, the lights by night and the urgency and eventfulness of 
that great rain-swept heart of the modern world.
<P>
It is difficult to think we have left that--for many years if not 
for ever.  In thought I walk once more in Palace Yard and hear the 
clink and clatter of hansoms and the quick quiet whirr of motors; I 
go in vivid recent memories through the stir in the lobbies, I sit 
again at eventful dinners in those old dining-rooms like cellars 
below the House--dinners that ended with shrill division bells, I 
think of huge clubs swarming and excited by the bulletins of that 
electoral battle that was for me the opening opportunity.  I see the 
stencilled names and numbers go up on the green baize, constituency 
after constituency, amidst murmurs or loud shouting. . . .
<P>
It is over for me now and vanished.  That opportunity will come no 
more.  Very probably you have heard already some crude inaccurate 
version of our story and why I did not take office, and have formed 
your partial judgement on me.  And so it is I sit now at my stone 
table, half out of life already, in a warm, large, shadowy leisure, 
splashed with sunlight and hung with vine tendrils, with paper 
before me to distil such wisdom as I can, as Machiavelli in his 
exile sought to do, from the things I have learnt and felt during 
the career that has ended now in my divorce.
<P>
I climbed high and fast from small beginnings.  I had the mind of my 
party.  I do not know where I might not have ended, but for this red 
blaze that came out of my unguarded nature and closed my career for 
ever.
