<p>The departure of Shasta gave rise to all manner of doubt and
speculation. None of them believed he meditated bidding the party
good-by until he went through the ceremony of shaking hands. This
settled the matter, and they could have no cause for hope of seeing
him again.</p>

<p>"That must have been a party of his people," said Howard, "or
he would not have taken the pains to help us out of sight."</p>

<p>"At any rate, he has done us good service," replied Elwood. "I
don't know what would have become of us but for him."</p>

<p>They had not yet begun using their paddle, but were drifting
with the current, debating upon their course of action.</p>

<p>"I think I understand why he left us," added Howard, after a
moment's pause.</p>

<p>Tim and Elwood looked up in his face.</p>

<p>"I think we have passed through most of the danger, and he thought
we were just as safe without him as with him. Don't you see, Elwood,
that we have come a good ways down the river, and we must be near
some settlement. I think there is a place called Soledad somewhere
along this river, but whether on the eastern or western bank I
cannot tell."</p>

<p>"It is a good ways off, I should say fifty miles, and is on the
western bank."</p>

<p>"How comes it that <em>you</em> are so well informed?" asked
Howard, repeating the question that had been asked him by his
cousin when on the steamer.</p>

<p>"It is only accidentally that I know that. A few weeks ago I
was comparing an old and new geography and noticed what different
views they gave of the western part of our country. The old maps
had the Buenaventura so wrong in every particular that I learned
considerable about the true one, which you know is called Salinas
by most people."</p>

<p>"If we are very careful, I think we can get home without trouble;
but although there must be white people&mdash;settlers and miners&mdash;in
these parts, still they are so scattered that we are less likely
to see them than we are the Indians."</p>

<p>"Boys," said Tim O'Rooney, who had not let his pipe go out since
morning. "Shall I give yez some good advice?"</p>

<p>Both expressed their eagerness to receive it.</p>

<p>"There bees plenty of the rid gintlemen yet in this counthry,
and we haven't got beyant them. If we goes paddling in this canoe
when the sun is shining overhead, some of 'em will see us, and
if we don't put into shore they'll put out after us&mdash;that they
will."</p>

<p>"What is it that you propose, then?"</p>

<p>"That we turns the night into day, and slaaps and smokes and
meditates by sunlight, and does our traveling by moonlight, or
what is bether, without any light at all."</p>

<p>This proposal suited the boys exactly. It was so plainly dictated
by common sense that the wonder was they had not thought of it
long before. Elwood took the paddle in his hand and held it poised.</p>

<p>"Which way&mdash;east or west?"</p>

<p>Howard pointed to the left bank.</p>

<p>"That is the side where <em>they</em> are," replied Elwood, referring
to the Indian party they had passed.</p>

<p>"And where <em>he</em> is," meaning their good friend, the Pah
Utah.</p>

<p>"To the left&mdash;to the left," said Tim. "Didn't I git into the
worst throuble of me life&mdash;always barring the repulse me Bridget
give me&mdash;by hunting in them parts?"</p>

<p>Elwood delayed no longer, but plied the oars with a dexterity
that showed his experience had not been lost upon him.</p>

<p>"You understand it quite well," said Howard approvingly.</p>

<p>"Yes; but my arms ache terribly."</p>

<p>"Ah! here we are."</p>

<p>The prow of the canoe moved as silently and easily into the undergrowth
as if it were water, and our friends at a step passed from every
portion of it to dry land.</p>

<p>As they intended remaining in their present quarters until darkness,
they took some pains to select a suitable place. They finally
hit upon a spot, on an incline of the river bank, and about a
dozen yards distant. Here the grass was green and velvety, and
the wood so thick that they had little fear of discovery, unless
by some who had seen them land and took the trouble to hunt them
out.</p>

<p>It was about noon when they landed, and as they had all spent
a wakeful night, their first proceeding was so to arrange themselves
as to enjoy a quiet sleep. Terror was placed on duty as sentinel,
and all lay down with a sense of security to which they had been
strangers in a long time.</p>

<p>As usual, the boys were the first to awake, doing so almost at
the same moment. They saw by the sun that the afternoon was about
half gone, but they were not troubled from hunger, as their morning
meal may be said to have been their midday one, and had been one
of those royal ones whose memory is apt to linger a long time
with us, especially if we are boys.</p>

<p>"This is tiresome," said Elwood, yawning and stretching his limbs,
"let us take a tramp of discovery."</p>

<p>The proposal suited Howard, although prudence told him to remain
where he was and keep his friend with him. But the restraint was
so irksome that he was all too willing a listener to the persuasions
of his companion.</p>

<p>"I noticed there was quite a high range of hills just back of
us," added Elwood. "Let's take a look at them."</p>

<p>"Is it prudent?" and Howard only repeated audibly the question
that his conscience had just asked him.</p>

<p>"Prudent? Of course it is, if we only take good care of ourselves."</p>

<p>"Shall we awake Tim before we go?"</p>

<p>"No; he will sleep until to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"We must leave Terror to watch him then, for it wouldn't do for
him to lie alone and asleep."</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>The Newfoundland, which had risen to his feet, was told to remain
on guard, and the boys started off on a ramble that was to be
a most eventful one to them.</p>
