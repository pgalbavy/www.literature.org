<p>The approach of the cyclone was attended by an appalling roar,
and a mass of branches and trees flying through the air, which
warned the boys of their danger.</p>

<p>"Terry, it won't do to stay here," shouted Fred, casting about
for some place of refuge; "where shall we go?"</p>

<p>Quite close to the stream which they had just crossed was an
enormous rock. Its irregular surface, a dozen feet in extent each
way, must have reached far down in the ground, so that nothing
could have been more immovable. It was not the refuge that the
boys would have taken, had they been given time to hunt for one,
but surely they could not have found a better.</p>

<p>A couple of leaps took Terry to the place, and, as he threw himself
on his face, Fred was directly behind him. As they lay, the shelving
rock was less than two feet above their heads. Though they could
hear, they could not see what was coming. They could look to the
right and left, but only for a few seconds in front.</p>

<p>Using their eyes as best they could, they saw the air filled
with leaves, twigs, branches, huge limbs and trunks, which spun
forward and over and over, like so many feathers in a tornado.</p>

<p>The first shock that came to the boys crouching behind the rock
was a dead thump near their heads. An uprooted tree had been hurled
from some point above, like an enormous spear, and, striking the
rock at a slant, slid over the rough surface like the finger of
a player over the face of a tambourine and out beyond, hunting
for some spot where it could penetrate. It found it on the ground,
but it was instantly wrenched loose by the resistless power that
had first thrown it forward, and went end over end into the general
wreck and ruin beyond.</p>

<p>The next sight which startled the boys was on their left, directly
over the stream. The air was filled apparently with snow, as if
a violent squall had suddenly sprung up. It was accompanied by
a hissing noise, which mingled with the fearful roar that had
not stopped and was like that of the stormy Atlantic beating upon
the rock-bound coast.</p>

<p>Striking the stream, the cyclone whirled most of the water from
its bed, scattered the mist and foam among the trees, and saturated
the boys where they lay. The huge torch was quenched as suddenly
as it was lighted.</p>

<p>The most terrifying moment to Fred and Terry was when they felt
the rock in front of them move. It was turned several inches to
one side, and for one frightful moment, they believed that that
too would be sent skimming through the air, or whirled over upon
them. But there was no other refuge to which they could fly; had
they attempted to rise to their feet, they would have been snatched
up and dashed to death. So they flattened themselves as much as
they could on their faces, and the terrific outburst could not
reach them.</p>

<p>Such an elemental fury can not last long. Having torn up the
ponderous trees, overturned rocks, and cleaned out the stream,
the cyclone seemed to mount upward and leave the earth entirely,
probably to descend some miles away and continue its work of destruction.</p>

<p>Fred lay still several minutes after it had passed, and then
turned to look at his companion. He had unrolled the package and
taken therefrom the cooked buffalo steak, which had been so roughly
handled during his ride on the bull.</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the astonished Fred, "I believe you are the
only person in the world who could eat his dinner in the middle
of such a storm as this."</p>

<p>"I was thinkin', bein' as we are in so much of a hurry, that
I would save some toime by dinin' without delay, though ye do
me an injoostice by sayin' I'm through the same; I'm jist about
to begin and I'll be plaised to have yer company."</p>

<p>Terry may not have had much sentiment, but he was sensible. Fred
sat up, his head just rising above the rock, and, for a few minutes,
they gave their attention to their meal. There was enough for
a fair lunch, but no more. A gentle wind blew against them, being
the remnant left by the cyclone, and while they ate, you need
not be told they used their eyes.</p>

<p>The sight was a striking one: the trees lay across each other,
many with their prong-like roots pointing toward the sky, limbs
and trunks having been tossed about in the most bewildering confusion.
The water that had been lifted from the creek rendered not only
their clothing wet, but every thing around them was saturated.
Walking to the side of the stream, they looked down at the sloping
banks, wet and muddy, but with little water except in the bottom.
The current, however, was pouring so swiftly from above that this
was rapidly filling up, and before long would reach its former
level.</p>

<p>Now that the cyclone had passed, the sky rapidly cleared. There
was a chilliness in the air, and the sun did not show itself.</p>

<p>The boys took but a short time to view the destruction, great
as it was, when they faced about in the direction of the camp
which was their destination from the first. It looked as though
they were finally separated from the trail, for since it was so
covered by fallen trees and limbs, not the slightest trace of
it was seen. They were filled with dismay, and indeed would have
been at their wits' end had not the cyclone confined its fury
to exceedingly narrow limits. All its prodigious force was spent
in and directly along the stream. Twenty yards away, the forest
was undisturbed, so that the elemental scythe had made a clean
swath as it sped along.</p>

<p>"Hurrah!" called out Terry, "here's the path; I follyed a straight
line as I could from the water here, so I'm sure I couldn't coom
out very far from the right place."</p>

<p>Fred hurried over the ruins to his side, and a glance at the
ground showed that his friend was right: there was the trail at
their feet.</p>

<p>"Now," said Terry, recovering his spirits, "if we had only knowed
that that storm was coomin', we could have fastened our guns to
our backs and swum across, without waitin' to build the raft,
and saved all the time that we lost."</p>

<p>"But we would have been wetted all the same, had we done so."</p>

<p>"And gained that much time; do ye know," added Terry, in a half
frightened voice, "what I obsarved?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you saw what I did,&mdash;the air full of water, trees,
limbs, stones and lightning."</p>

<p>"While we were peepin' over the edge of the rock, ye moind that
the wind cut our faces so we had to lower 'em to keep our heads
flyin' off where we couldn't find 'em agin. It was yersilf that
stuck yer nose in the ground, but I took a paap off beyanst the
creek and I saan one of the Winnebagos."</p>

<p>"Can it be possible! what was he doin'?"</p>

<p>"Turnin' summersets at the rate of twinty to the second and about
a dozen faat above the ground; I had only the one glimpse of him,
but whin I obsarved him it looked to me as if his head and one
leg wint off in different directions; I s'pose he's lookin' for
the same."</p>

<p>Fred Linden could hardly believe that Terry had seen one of their
enemies, though, as you can well understand, from what cyclones
have done in recent years, it was not at all impossible. The youth
insisted so strongly on the first part of his statement, that
Fred decided that at the time the storm burst, one at least of
their foes was on the bank behind them.</p>

<p>All this confirmed the belief he had expressed that they had
lost invaluable time by wandering from the trail, and that they
would have hard work to keep far enough in advance to reach the
camp before the Winnebagos. The proof that they had received too
of some of the Winnebagos being in front complicated the situation
and added to the mental discomfort of both.</p>

<p>The sky which, as you will remember, had become overcast sometime
before the bursting of the cyclone, continued to clear, and to
the surprise of the young hunters, about the middle of the afternoon
the sun showed itself. The chilliness, however, remained, though
the two walked so briskly that they could have well stood a still
lower temperature.</p>

<p>Fortunately for them (though it also operated in favor of their
enemies) the trail was traveled without difficulty. The ground
was uneven, sometimes up and sometimes down, but it was not hard
for the feet and they made good progress. The distance they had
to go was too great for them to hope to reach the end of the journey
before the morrow, even if they traveled most of the night. They
had already proven their pluck and resolution, and you may be
sure, now that they were on the right path, that they did not
throw away any minutes.</p>

<p>They had eaten the extra buffalo steak sooner than was intended,
but they could afford to wait until the morrow before partaking
of any more food.</p>

<p>The afternoon was far along and they were pushing forward in
their usual vigor, talking in a hopeful strain now and then, when
both were startled by the report of a rifle. It did not sound
in front nor to the rear, but only a moderate distance to the
left. The boys stopped and looked in each other's face.</p>

<p>"Anither of the spalpeens," whispered Terry; "now there ought
to be a gun fired on tother side of us and one in front and one
behind us."</p>

<p>"They may be there, all the same," replied Fred, staring in the
direction whence came the report, as though he expected the appearance
of the one who had caused it. They looked and listened for several
minutes, but saw and heard nothing more, and resumed their hurried
pace, frequently glancing behind, for they were in that distrustful
state of mind which comes to one who has a strong suspicion that
an enemy is trying to steal behind him unawares. The actual presence
of such an enemy is no more trying than the suspense itself.</p>

<p>The shot might have been innocent&mdash;that is, fired by some wandering
white man or Indian who had not the remotest thought that any
other person was within hearing. Probably such was the fact, though
there was enough uncertainty about it to prevent the theory affording
the youth the comfort it otherwise would have done.</p>

<p>The lads, as you may well believe, did not stop to look into
the matter, but pressed on at a gait which they were confident
would prevent any of their enemies overtaking them, unless they
broke into their loping trot, which was hardly likely.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, Terry seemed to be thinking more about the
three Winnebago horsemen with whom Fred Linden had had his encounter
than he did about his own experience.</p>

<p>"How thim spalpeens could be ridin', whin all the rist are afoot,
is somethin' that puzzles me," said he, after they had walked
some distance further; "can't ye give some explanation that will
relaave me mind, Fred?"</p>

<p>"I can certainly know no more about it than you do."</p>

<p>"Didn't ye obsarve them with particularity?"</p>

<p>"I can't say that I did; they were rather small, tough-looking;
two were bay in color, while one was black: I noticed the black
one more than the others, because the Indian that I hit was riding
on him; I remember that he had a star in his forehead."</p>

<p>"Who? The Winnebago?"</p>

<p>"You know well enough that I meant the horse&#11834;"</p>

<p>Fred Linden stopped short, and turned his white, scared face
upon his friend. He had just awakened to an astounding fact.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Fred? Are ye ill?"</p>

<p>"My gracious! why didn't I think of that before? Those three
horses belong to father, Mr. Hardin and Mr. Bowlby."</p>

<p>"Are ye sure of the same?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course; I can't understand why I did not notice it the
moment I saw them!"</p>
