<p>He was gone, his presence had ceased to poison the air, and, the long
strain over, Rachel gave a gasp of relief. Then she sat down upon the
bench and began to think. Her position, and that of Richard, was
desperate; it seemed scarcely possible that they could escape with their
lives, for if he died, she would die also--as to that she was quite
determined. But at least they had three days, and who could say what would
happen in three days? For instance, they might escape somehow, the
Providence in which she believed might intervene, or the Zulus might come
to seek her, if they only knew where she was gone. Oh! why had she not
brought a guard of them with her to Ramah? At least they would never have
insulted her, and Ishmael’s shrift would have been short.
</p><p>She wondered why he had given her three days. A reason suggested itself to
her mind. Perhaps he believed what she had told him--that she was as safe
from him as the eagle in the air--and was sure that the only way to snare
her was by using Richard as a lure, in other words, by threatening to
murder him. It is true that he could have brought the matter to a head at
once, but then, if she remained obdurate, he must carry out his threat,
and this, she believed, he was afraid to do unless it was absolutely
forced upon him. Doubtless he had reflected that in three days she might
weaken and give way.
</p><p>Whilst Rachel brooded thus the door in the wall opened, and through it
came three women, who saluted her respectfully, and announced that they
were sent to clean the hut, and attend upon her. Rachel took stock of them
carefully. Two of them were young, ordinary, good-looking Kaffirs, but the
third was between thirty and forty, and no longer attractive, having
become old early, as natives do. Moreover, her face was sad and
sympathetic. Rachel asked her her name. She answered that it was Mami, and
that they were all the wives of Ibubesi.
</p><p>The women went about their duties in the hut in silence, and a while
afterwards announced that all was made clean, and that they would return
presently with food. Rachel answered that it was not necessary that three
of them should be put to so much trouble. It would be enough if Mami came.
She desired to be waited on by Mami alone, her sisters need not come any
more.
</p><p>They all three saluted again, and said that she should be obeyed; the two
younger ones with alacrity. To Rachel it was evident that these women were
much afraid of her. Her reputation had reached them, and they shrank from
this task of attending on the mighty Inkosazana of the Zulus in her cage,
not knowing what evil it might bring upon them.
</p><p>An hour later the door was unbolted, and Mami reappeared with the food
that had been very carefully cooked. Rachel ate of it, for she was
determined to grow strong again, she who might need all her strength, and
while she ate talked to Mami, who squatted on the ground before her. Soon
she drew her story from her. The woman was Ishmael’s first Kaffir wife,
but he had never cared for her, and against all law and custom she was
discarded, and made a slave. Even some of her cattle had been taken from
her and given to other wives. So her heart was bitter against Ishmael, and
she said that although once she was proud to be the wife of a white man,
now she wished that she had never seen his face.
</p><p>Here, then, was material ready to Rachel’s hand, but she did not press the
matter too far at this time. Only she said that she wished Mami to stay
with her after the evening meal, and to sleep in her hut, as she was not
accustomed to be alone at night. Mami replied that she would do so gladly
if Ibubesi allowed it, although she was not worthy of such honour.
</p><p>As it happened, Ishmael did allow it, for he thought that he could trust
this old drudge, and told her to act as a spy upon Rachel, and report to
him all that she said or did. Very soon Rachel found this out and warned
her against obeying him, since if she did so it would come to her
knowledge, and then great evil would fall on one who betrayed the words of
the Inkosazana.
</p><p>Mami answered that she knew it, and that Rachel need not be afraid. Any
tale would do for Ishmael, whom she hated. Then, saying little herself,
Rachel encouraged her to talk, which Mami did freely. So she heard some
news. She learned, for instance, that the whole town of Mafooti, whereof
Ibubesi was chief, which counted some sixty or seventy heads of families,
was much disturbed by the events of the last few days. They did not like
the Inkosazana being brought there, thinking that where she went the Zulus
would follow, and as they were of Zulu blood themselves, they knew what
that meant. They were alarmed at the deaths of the white sky-doctor, who
was called Shouter, and his wife, with which Ibubesi had something to do,
for they feared lest they should be held responsible for their blood. They
objected to the imprisonment of the white chief, Dario, among them,
because “he had hurt no one, and was under the mantle of the Inkosazana,
who was a spirit, not a woman,” and who had warned them that if any harm
came to her or to him, death would be their reward. They were angry, also,
because Ibubesi had killed one of them in some quarrel about the chief
Dario at Ramah. Still, they were so much afraid of Ibubesi, who was a
great tyrant, that they did not dare to interfere with him and his plans,
lest they should lose their cattle, or, perhaps, their lives. So they did
not know what to do. As for Ibubesi himself, he was actively engaged in
strengthening the fortifications of the place; even the old people and the
children were being forced to carry stones to the walls, from which it was
evident that he feared some attack.
</p><p>When Rachel had gathered this and much other information concerning
Ishmael’s past and habits, she asked Mami if she could convey a message
from her to Richard. The woman answered that she would try on the
following morning. So Rachel told her to say that she was safe and well,
but that he must watch his footsteps, as both of them were in great
danger. More she did not dare to say, fearing lest Mami should betray her,
or be beaten till she confessed everything. Then, as there was nothing
more to be done, Rachel lay down and slept as best she could.
</p><p>The next day passed in much the same fashion as the first had done. For
the most of it Rachel sat under the tree in the walled yard, companioned
only by her terrible thoughts and fears. Nobody came near her, and nothing
happened. In the morning Mami went out, and returning at the dinner hour,
told Rachel that she had seen Ishmael, who had questioned her closely as
to what the Inkosazana had done and said, to which she replied that she
had only eaten and slept, and invoked the spirits on her knees. As for
words, none had passed her lips. She had not been able to get near the
huts where Dario was in prison, as Ishmael was watching her. For the rest,
the work of fortification went on without cease, even Ishmael’s own wives
being employed thereon.
</p><p>In the afternoon Mami went out again and did not return till night, when
she had much to tell. To begin with, while the sentry was dozing, being
wearied with carrying stones to the wall, she had managed to approach the
fence of the hut where Richard was confined. She said that he was walking
up and down inside the fence with his hands tied, and she had spoken to
him through a crack in the reeds, and given him Rachel’s message. He
listened eagerly, and bade her tell the Inkosazana that he thanked her for
her words; that he, too, was strong and well, though much troubled in
mind, but the future was in the hands of the Heavens, and that she must
keep a high heart. Just then the sentry woke up, so Mami could not wait to
hear any more.
</p><p>That evening, however, a lad who had been sent out of the town to drive in
some cattle, had returned with the tidings which she, Mami, heard him
deliver to Ibubesi with her own ears.
</p><p>He said that whilst he was collecting the oxen, a ringed Zulu came upon
him, who from his manner and bearing he took to be a great chief, although
he was alone, and seemed to be tired with walking. The Zulu has asked him
if it were true that the Inkosazana and the white chief Dario were in
prison at Mafooti, and when he hesitated about replying, threatened him
with his assegai, saying that he would cut out his heart unless he told
the truth. The Zulu replied that he knew it, as he had just come from
Ramah, where he had seen strange things, and spoken with a man of
Ibubesi’s, whom he found dying in the garden of the house. Then he had
given him this message:
</p><p>“Say to Ibubesi that I know all his wickedness, and that if the Inkosazana
is harmed, or if drop of the blood of the white chief, Dario, is shed, I
will destroy him and everything that lives in his town down to the rats.
Say to him also that he cannot escape, as already he is ringed in by the
children of the Shouter, who have come back, and are watching him.”
</p><p>The lad had asked who it was that sent such a message, whereon he
answered, “I am the Horn of the Black Bull; I am the Trunk of the
Elephant; I am the Mouth of Dingaan.”
</p><p>Then straightway he turned and departed at a run towards Zululand.
Moreover, Mami described the man in the words of the lad, and Rachel
thought that he could be none other than Tamboosa, whom she had commanded
to follow her with the white ox. Mami added that when he received this
message Ibubesi seemed much disturbed, though to his people he declared
that it was all nonsense, as Dingaan’s Mouth would not come alone, or
deliver the King’s word to a boy. But the people thought otherwise, and
murmured among themselves, fearing the terrible vengeance of Dingaan.
</p><p>On the next day Mami went out again. At nightfall, when she returned, she
told Rachel that she had not found it possible to approach the huts where
Dario was, as the hole she made in the fence to speak with him had been
discovered, and a stricter watch was kept over him. Ibubesi, she said, was
in an ill humour, and working furiously to finish his fortifications, as
he was now sure that the town was being watched, either by the Kaffirs of
Ramah, or others. As for the people of Mafooti, they were grumbling very
much, both on account of the heavy-labour of working at the walls, and
because they were in terror of being attacked and killed in payment for
the evil deeds of their chief. Mami declared, indeed, that so great was
their fear and discontent, that she thought they would desert the town in
a body, were it not that they dreaded lest they should fall into the hands
of the Kaffirs who were watching it. Rachel asked her whether they would
not then take her and Dario and deliver them up to the Zulus, or to the
white people on the coast. Mami answered she thought they would be afraid
to do this, as Ibubesi alone had guns, and would shoot plenty of them;
also if the Zulus found them with their Inkosazana they would kill them.
She added that she had seen Ibubesi, who bade her tell the Inkosazana that
he was coming for her answer on the morrow.
</p><p>Rachel slept ill that night. The space of her reprieve had gone by, and
next morning she must face the issue. For herself she did not so greatly
care, for at the worst she had a refuge whither Ishmael could not follow
her--the grave. After all she had endured it seemed to her that this must
be a peaceful place; moreover, in her case what Power could blame her? But
there was Richard to be thought of. If she refused Ishmael he swore that
he would kill Richard. And yet how could she pay that price even to save
her lover’s life? Perhaps he would not kill him after all; perhaps he
would be afraid of the vengeance of the Zulus, and was only trying to
frighten her. Ah! if only the Zulus would come--before it was too late! It
was scarcely to be hoped for. Tamboosa, if it were he who had spoken with
the lad, would not have had time to return to Zululand and collect an
impi, and when they did come, the deed might be done. If only these
servants of Ibubesi would rise against him and kill him, or carry off
Richard and herself! Alas! they feared the man too much, and she could not
get at them to persuade them. There was nothing that she could do except
pray. Richard and she must take their chance. Things must go as they were
decreed.
</p><p>If she could have seen Ishmael at this hour and read his thoughts, that
sight and knowledge might have brought some comfort to her tortured heart.
The man was seated in his hut alone, staring at the floor and pulling his
long black beard with hands rough from toiling at the walls. He was
drinking also, stiff tots of rum and water, but the fiery liquor seemed to
bring him no comfort. As he drank, he thought. He was determined to get
possession of Rachel; that desire had become a madness with him. He could
never abandon it while he lived. But <u>she</u> might not live. She had sworn
that she would rather die than become his wife, and she was not a woman
who broke her word. Also she hated him bitterly, and with good cause.
There was only one way to work on her--through her love for this man,
Richard Darrien; for that she did love him, he had little doubt. If it
were choice between yielding and the death of Darrien, then perhaps she
might give way. But there came the rub.
</p><p>Dingaan had sworn to him that if he made Darrien’s blood to flow, then he
should be killed, and, like Rachel, Dingaan kept his oaths. Moreover, that
Zulu who met the cattle herd had sworn it again in almost the same words.
Therefore it would seem that if he wished to continue to breathe,
Darrien’s blood must not be made to flow. All the rest might be explained
when the impi came, as it would do sooner or later, especially if he could
show to them that the Inkosazana was his willing wife, but the murder of
Darrien could never be explained. Well, the man might die, or seem to die,
and then who could hold him responsible? Or if they did, if any of his
people remained faithful to him, an attack might be beaten off. Brave as
they were, the Zulus could not storm those walls on which he had spent so
much labour, though now he almost wished that he had left the walls alone
and settled the affair of Rachel and of Darrien first.
</p><p>Ishmael poured out more rum and drank it, neat this time, as though to
nerve himself for some undertaking. Then he went to the door of the hut
and called, whereon presently a hideous old woman crept in and squatted
down in the circle of light thrown by the lamp. She was wrinkled and
deformed, and her snake-skin moocha, with the inflated fish-bladder in her
hair, showed that she was a witch-doctoress.
</p><p>“Well, Mother,” he said, “have you made the poison?”
</p><p>“Yes, Ibubesi, yes. I have made it as I alone can do. Oh! it is a
wonderful drug, worth many cows. How many did you say you would give me?
Six?”
</p><p>“No, three; but if it does what is wanted you shall have the other three
as well. Tell me again, how does it work?”
</p><p>“Thus, Ibubesi. Whoever drinks this medicine becomes like one dead--none
can tell the difference, no, not a doctor even--and remains so for a long
while--perhaps one day, perhaps two, perhaps even three. Then life
returns, and by degrees strength, but not memory; for whole moons the
memory is gone, and he who has drunk remains like a child that has
everything to learn.”
</p><p>“You lie, Mother. I never heard of such a medicine.”
</p><p>“You never heard of it because none can make it save me, and I had its
secret from my grandmother; also few can afford to pay me for it. Still,
it has been used, and were I not afraid I could give you cases. Stay, I
will show you. Call that beast,” and she pointed to a dog that was asleep
at the side of the hut. “Here is milk; I will show you.”
</p><p>Ishmael hesitated, for he was fond of this dog; then as he wished to test
the stuff he called it. It came and sat down beside him, looking up in his
face with faithful eyes. Then the old witch poured milk into a bowl, and
in the milk mixed some white powder which she took out of a folded leaf,
and offered it to the animal. The dog sniffed the milk, growled slightly,
and refused it.
</p><p>“The evil beast does not like me; he bit me the other day,” said the old
doctoress. “Do you give it to him, Ibubesi; he will trust you.”
</p><p> So Ishmael patted the dog on the head, then, offered it the milk, which
it lapped up to the last drop.
</p><p>“There, evil beast,” said the woman, with a chuckle, “you won’t bite me
any more; you’ll forget all about me for a long time. Look at him,
Ibubesi, look at him.”
</p><p>As she spoke, the poor dog’s coat began to stare; then it uttered a low
howl, ran to Ishmael, tried to lick his hand, and rolled over, to all
appearance quite dead.
</p><p>“You have killed my dog, which I love, you hag!” he said angrily.
</p><p>“Then why did you give medicine to what you love, Ibubesi? But have no
fear, the evil beast has only taken a small dose; to-morrow morning it
will awake, but it will not know you or anyone. Who is the medicine for,
Ibubesi? The Lady Zoola? If so, it may not work on her, for she is mighty,
and cannot be harmed.”
</p><p>“Fool! Do you think that I would play tricks with the Inkosazana?”
</p><p>“No, you want to marry her, don’t you? but it seems to me that she has no
mind that way. Then it is for the man for whom she has a mind for? Well,
Ibubesi, you have promised the six cows, and you saved me once from being
killed for witchcraft, so I will say something. Don’t give it to the chief
Dario.”
</p><p>“Why not, you old fool; will it kill him after all?”
</p><p>“No, no; it will do what I said, no less and no more, in this quantity,”
 and she handed him another powder wrapped in dry leaves; “but I have had
bad dreams about you, Ibubesi, and they were mixed up with the Inkosazana
and this white man Dario. I dreamed they brought your death upon you--a
dreadful death. Ibubesi, be wise, set Dario free, and change your mind as
to marrying the Inkosazana, who is not for you.”
</p><p>“How can I change my mind, Descendant of Wizards?” broke out Ishmael. “Can
a river penned between rocks change its course? Can it run backwards from
the sea to the hill? This woman draws me as the sea draws the river;
because of her my blood is afire. I had rather win her and die, than live
rich and safe without her to old age. The more she hates and scorns me,
the more I love her.”
</p><p>“I understand,” said the doctoress, nodding her head till the bladder in
her hair bobbed about like a float at which a fish is pulling. “I
understand. I have seen people like this before--men and women too--when a
bad spirit enters into them because of some crime they have committed. The
Inkosazana, or those who guard her, have sent you this bad spirit, and,
Ibubesi, you must run the road upon which it is appointed that you should
travel; for joy or sorrow you must run that road. But when we meet in the
world of ghosts, which I think will be soon, do not blame me, do not say
that I did not warn you. Now it is all right about those cows, is it not?
although I dare say the Zulus will milk them and not I, for to-night I
seem to smell Zulus in the air,” and she lifted her broad nose and sniffed
like a hound. “I wish you could have left the Inkosazana alone, and that
Dario too, for he is a part of her; in my dreams they seemed to be one.
But you won’t, you will walk your own path; so good night, Ibubesi. The
dog will wake again in the morning, but he will not know you. Good night,
Ibubesi--of course I understand that the cows will be young ones that have
not had more than two calves. Mix the powder in milk, or water, or
anything; it is without taste or colour. Good night, Ibubesi,” and without
waiting for an answer the old wretch crept out of the hut.
</p><p>When she was gone Ishmael cursed her aloud, then drank some more rum,
which he seemed to need. The place was very lonely, and the sight of his
dog, lying to all appearance dead at his side, oppressed him. He patted
its head and it did not move; he lifted its paw and it fell down flabbily.
The brute was as dead as anything could be. It occurred to him that before
night came again he might look like that dog. His story might be told; he
might have left the earth in company of all the deeds that he had done
thereon. He had imagination enough to know his sins, and they were an evil
host to face. Old Dove and his wife, for instance--holy people who
believed in God and Vengeance, and had never done any wrong, only striven
for years and years to benefit others; it would not be pleasant to meet
them. Rachel had said that she saw them standing behind him, and he felt
as though they were there at that moment. Look, one of them crossed
between him and the lamp--there was the mark of the kerry on his head--and
the woman followed; he could see her blue lips as she bent down to look at
the dog. It was unbearable. He would go and talk to Rachel, and ask her if
she had made up her mind. No, for if he broke in on her thus at night, he
was sure that she would kill either herself or him with that spear she had
taken from the dead Zulu, reddened with his own blood. He would keep faith
with her and wait till the morrow. He would send for one of his wives. No,
the thought of those women made him sick. He would go round the
fortifications and beat any sentries whom he found asleep, or receive the
reports of the spies. To stop in that hut in the company of a dog which
seemed to be dead, and of imaginations that no rum could drown, was
impossible.
</p><hr/>
<p>Once more the morning came, and Rachel sat in the walled yard awaiting the
dreadful hour of her trial, for it was the day and time that Ishmael had
appointed for her answer. Until now Rachel had cherished hopes that
something might happen: that the people of Mafooti might intervene to save
her and Richard; that the Zulus might appear, even that Ishmael might
relent and let them go. But Mami had been out that morning and brought
back tidings which dispelled these hopes. She had ventured to sound some
of the leading men, and said that, like all the people, they were very
sullen and alarmed, but declared, as she had expected, that they dare do
nothing, for Ibubesi would kill them, and if they escape him the Zulus
would kill them because the Inkosazana was found in their possession. Of
the Zulus themselves, scouts who had been out for miles, reported that
they had seen no sign. It was clear also that Ishmael was as determined as
ever, for he had sent her a message by Mami that he would wait upon her as
he had promised, and bring the white man with him.
</p><p>Then what should she say and what should she do? Rachel could think of no
plan; she could only sit still and pray while the shadow of that awful
hour crept ever nearer.
</p><p>It had come; she heard voices without the wall, among them Ishmael’s. Her
heart stopped, then bounded like a live thing in her breast. He was
commanding someone to “catch that dog and tie it up, for it was bewitched,
and did not know him or anyone,” then the sound of a dog being dragged
away, whining feebly, and then the door opened. First Ishmael came in with
an affectation of swaggering boldness, but looking like a man suffering
from the effects of a long debauch. About his eyes were great black rings,
and in them was a stare of sleeplessness. He carried a double-barrelled
gun under his arm, but the hand with which he supported it shook visibly,
and at every unusual sound he started. After him came Richard, his wrists
bound together behind him, and on his legs hide shackles which only just
allowed him to shuffle forward slowly. Moreover he was guarded by four men
who carried spears. Rachel glanced quickly at his face, and saw that it
was pale and resolute; quite untouched by fear.
</p><p>“Are you well?” she asked quietly, taking no note of Ishmael.
</p><p>“Yes,” he answered, “and you, Rachel?”
</p><p>“Quite well bodily, Richard, but oh! my soul is sick.”
</p><p>Before he could reply Ishmael turned on him savagely, and bade him be
silent, or it would be the worse for him. Then he took off his hat with
his shaking hand, and bowed to Rachel.
</p><p>“Rachel,” he said, “I have kept my promise, and left you alone for three
days, but time is up and now this gentleman and I have come to hear your
decision, which is so important to both of us.”
</p><p>“What am I to decide?” she asked in a low voice, looking straight before
her.
</p><p>“Have you forgotten? Your memory must be very bad. Well, it is best to
have no mistake, and no doubt our friend here would like to know exactly
how things stand. You have to decide whether you will take me as your
husband to-day of your own free will, or whether Mr. Richard Darrien shall
suffer the punishment of death, for having tried to kill his sentry and
escape, a crime of which he has been guilty, and afterwards I should take
you as my wife with, or without, your consent.”
</p><p>When Richard heard these words the veins in his forehead swelled with rage
and horror till it seemed as though they would burst.
</p><p>“You unutterable villain,” he gasped, “you cowardly hound! Oh! if only my
hands were free.”
</p><p>“Well, they ain’t, Mr. Darrien, and it’s no use your tugging at that
buffalo hide, so hold your tongue, and let us hear the lady’s answer,”
 sneered Ishmael.
</p><p>“Richard, Richard,” said Rachel in a kind of wail, “you have heard. It is
a matter of your life. What am I to do?”
</p><p>“Do?” he answered, in loud, firm tones, “do? How can you ask me such a
question? The matter is not one of my life, but of your--of your--oh! I
cannot say it. Let this foul beast kill me, of course, and then, if you
care enough, follow the same road. A few years sooner or later make little
difference, and so we shall soon be together again.”
</p><p>She thought a moment, then said quietly:
</p><p>“Yes, I care enough, and a hundred times more than that. Yes, that is the
only way out. Listen, you Ishmael:--Richard Darrien, the man to whom I am
sworn, and I, give you this answer. Murder him if you will, and bring
God’s everlasting vengeance on your head. He will not buy his life on such
terms, and if I consented to them I should be false to him. Murder him as
you murdered my father and mother, and when I know that he is dead I will
go to join him and them.”
</p><p>“All right, Rachel,” said Ishmael, whose face was white with fury, “I
think I will take you at your word, and you can go to look for him down
below, if you like, for if I am not to get you here, he shan’t. Now then,
say your prayers, Mr. Darrien,” and stepping forward slowly he cocked the
double-barrelled gun.
</p><p>“Men of Mafooti,” exclaimed Rachel in Zulu, “Ibubesi is about to do murder
on one who like myself is under the mantle of Dingaan. If his blood should
flow to-day or to-morrow, yours shall flow in payment, yours, and that of
your wives and children, for the crime of the chief is the crime of the
people.”
</p><p>At her words the four natives who had been watching this scene uneasily,
although they could not understand the English talk, called out to Ishmael
in remonstrance. His only answer was to lift the gun, and for an instant
that seemed infinite Rachel waited to hear its explosion, and to see the
grey-eyed, open-faced man she loved, who stood there like a rock, fall a
shattered corpse. Then one of the Kaffirs, bolder than the rest, struck up
the barrels with his arm, and not too soon, for whether or no he had meant
to pull the trigger, the rifle went off.
</p><p>“Try the other barrel,” said Richard sarcastically, as the smoke cleared
away, “that shot was too high.”
</p><p>Perhaps Ishmael might have done so, for the man was beside himself, but
the Kaffirs would have no more of it. They rushed between them, lifting
their spears threateningly, and shouting that they would not allow the
blood of the white lord and the curse of the Inkosazana to be brought upon
their heads and those of their families. Rather than that they would bind
him, Ibubesi, and give him over to the Zulus. Then, whether or not he had
really meant to kill Richard, Ishmael thought it politic to give way.
</p><p>“So be it,” he said to Rachel, “I am merciful, and both of you shall have
another chance. I am going with this fellow, but the woman, Mami, shall
come to you. If within three hours you send her to me with a message to
say that you have changed your mind, he shall be spared. If not, before
nightfall you shall see his body, and afterwards we will settle matters.”
</p><p>“Rachel, Rachel,” cried Richard, “swear that you will send no such
message.”
</p><p>Now the brute, Ishmael, rushed at him to strike him in the face. But
Richard saw him coming, and bound though he was, put down his head and
butted at him so fiercely, that being much the stronger man, he knocked
him to the ground, where he lay breathless.
</p><p>“Swear, Rachel, swear,” he repeated, “or dead or living, I will never
forgive you.”
</p><p>“I swear,” she said, faintly.
</p><p>Then he shuffled towards her. Bending down he kissed her on the face, and
she kissed him back; no more words passed between them; this was their
farewell. Two of the Kaffirs lifted Ishmael, and helped him from the yard,
whilst the other two led away Richard, who made no resistance. At the gate
he turned, and their eyes met for a moment. Then it closed behind him, and
she was left alone again.
