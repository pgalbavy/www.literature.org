<p>It took Ned about a minute to reach his merciful conclusion and
to lower the hammer of his gun. This done, he looked out to see
how the Indian was getting along. To his amazement nothing was
seen of him. He had vanished as suddenly as if the ground had
opened and swallowed him up. Wondering what it all could mean,
the boy rose to his feet, and peered out, parting the bushes still
more and advancing a little from his concealment. The ground was
quite level, covered here and there with boulders and a scrubby
undergrowth, but there was nothing to be seen of the warrior.
During the second or two occupied in lowering the hammer of his
rifle, the Apache had disappeared, flashing out, so to speak,
into nothingness.</p>

<p>"That's mighty queer," reflected Ned, as he resumed his seat
under the bushes. "I know those redskins are pretty lively, but
I didn't think they could get up and leave as fast as that."</p>

<p>There was something in the manner of this thing which alarmed
him. The Apache, when last seen, was advancing carefully in the
direction taken by the scouts. Why this sudden diversion? What
did it mean but that the redskin had made an important discovery,
and what could that discovery be but that he was threatened by
danger from the rear? Such being the case, it followed that the
peril had been transferred from one to the other. Instead of the
lad threatening the Indian it was <em>vice versa</em>.</p>

<p>"I bet he'll be back here," was the conclusion of our hero, as
he once more raised the hammer of his gun. "He must have heard
me when I moved the bushes, and he'll be trying some of his tricks
upon me."</p>

<p>He concluded that if the Indian made him a visit it would be
from another direction, and so he shifted his position somewhat,
managing to face the other way, while he kept all his senses on
the <em>qui vive</em> for the hostile visit which he was confident
would not be long delayed. At the same time he had a strong hope
that the scouts would return in time to prevent any such encounter
as he pictured in his own mind, and which he thoroughly dreaded.</p>

<p>In his excited mental condition it was impossible to judge accurately
of the passage of time, but it seemed to him that he had been
in waiting fully fifteen minutes, yet not the slightest sound
reached him from that direction. The lad remained in a state of
suspense which was intensified by his fears of a flank movement
upon the part of the Apache whom he had seen but a short time
before.</p>

<p>"It must take them a long time to make a reconnaissance&mdash;"</p>

<p>He suddenly ceased, for his ear, more than usually alert, caught
a slight but suspicious sound, and quick as a flash he turned
his head. He was not an instant too soon, for there was the crouching
figure of the Apache warrior, no more than a dozen feet distant,
his gleaming knife clutched in his right hand, and his eyes fairly
aflame with passion. He was not moving along inch by inch, but
with that soft gliding motion, which was more like the approach
of a serpent than of a person.</p>

<p>Ned still held his rifle with the hammer raised, and ready for
just such an emergency. Partly expecting the visit, he was fully
prepared. When he turned his head and encountered the gaze of
the Indian, the latter gave utterance to a low gutteral exclamation,
and started more rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>"If you must have it, there it is."</p>

<p>The flash from the muzzle of the rifle was almost in the face
of the Apache, who, with a death-shriek horrible to hear, threw
both arms above his head, and, with a spasmodic twitching of the
limbs, breathed his last in a single breath.</p>

<p>Ned was scarcely less terrified than the redskin must have been
at the first flash of the gun; and, forgetful of the warning of
the scouts, he leaped out from beneath the bushes, and dashed
away in the direction taken by his friends.</p>

<p>He had run but a rod or two when he suddenly found himself face
to face with Tom Hardynge, who demanded, in a hurried undertone:</p>

<p>"What's up, now?"</p>

<p>"I've just shot an Indian."</p>

<p>"Did you wipe him out?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; oh, yes."</p>

<p>"Then what are you running away from him for? If you've wiped
him out, he can't hurt you."</p>

<p>"But I don't want to stay near him," added the lad, who was in
a distressing state of anxiety; "take me away."</p>

<p>"That's just what I'm going to do," replied the hunter, turning
about and hurrying off. "Keep close to me and I will take care
of you."</p>

<p>Instead of retracing their steps, they kept ahead, and a short
distance further on made an abrupt turn and suddenly came upon
Dick Morris, seated upon the back of his mustang, with Thundergust,
as Tom called him, standing near, and a third one visible in the
background.</p>

<p>"Whose is that?" asked the astonished boy.</p>

<p>"We fetched him for you. Come, bounce upon his back and let's
be off."</p>

<p>The animal alluded to was a handsome black pony, spirited and
fleet, with a valuable blanket strapped to its back, and a leathern
bridle-rein. He showed some opposition to Ned's mounting him,
but with the assistance of Tom he quieted down and showed as much
docility as the others.</p>

<p>The hunters, in approaching the camp, used as much care and deliberation
as if they were certain that there were a hundred of the fiercest
warriors there. They speedily learned, however, that there were
but the two Indian horse thieves, who, in bringing the plunder
to that place, had returned to the spot where their own animals
had been left previous to their starting out upon the raid.</p>

<p>The Apaches were entirely unsuspicious of any pursuit, and they
were lolling upon the ground at such a distance from the mustangs,
that the three were secured without much trouble. Dick Morris
insisted upon sailing in and clearing out the two marauders; but
Tom was equally strenuous in demanding that they should not be
disturbed. He was certain there were other warriors near by, and
any such attempt would complicate matters. Accordingly they stole
away with their recaptured animals and the one which was not exactly
recaptured, and as soon as a convenient spot was selected Hardynge
turned back for the boy, encountering him on the way.</p>

<p>Since all three were mounted upon good beasts they made all haste
possible to leave the section, which beyond all question was a
most dangerous one in every sense.</p>

<p>The trio had several important advantages on their side. Although
the Apaches were on every hand, and doubtless would make an attempt
to revenge themselves upon the hunters, yet it was already growing
dark, and between now and morning the Caucasians could accomplish
a great deal. Furthermore, they were close to the prairie, reaching
which, they had all the opportunity they could desire to leave
their enemies behind. In a fair trial of speed, neither of the
hunters had any misgivings as to the fleetness of their animals,
even if it should become necessary to place the additional weight
of the lad upon one. Still, the route was difficult, and in many
places it seemed almost impossible to make their way along, the
horses stumbling, and on one or two occasions the party came to
a dead halt.</p>

<p>But Tom Hardynge had been there before, and insisted each time
there was some way out of the difficulty without turning back.
Dismounting from his animal he groped around for a few minutes
in the dark, and on every occasion called out in an undertone
that he had found the path. In this manner they kept it up for
a couple of hours, when the route became much more easy to travel.
Occasionally they paused and listened and looked, but nothing
threatening was discovered. Quite a distance on the left, the
twinkle of a camp fire was discerned, but it was so distant that
it gave no concern. All remained quiet in the rear, though pursuit
from that quarter was to be expected.</p>

<p>The three rode along in silence for something like half an hour
longer, when Hardynge, who was slightly in advance, abruptly reined
up his steed and said:</p>

<p>"We're through the mountains. There's the prairie afore us."</p>
