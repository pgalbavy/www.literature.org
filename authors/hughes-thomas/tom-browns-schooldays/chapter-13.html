<P>The next morning, at first lesson, Tom was turned back in his
lines, and so had to wait till the second round; while Martin
and Arthur said theirs all right, and got out of school at once.
When Tom got out and ran down to breakfast at Harrowell's they
were missing, and Stumps informed him that they had swallowed
down their breakfasts and gone off together - where, he couldn't
say.  Tom hurried over his own breakfast, and went first to
Martin's study and then to his own; but no signs of the missing
boys were to be found.  He felt half angry and jealous of
Martin.  Where could they be gone?</P>
<P>He learnt second lesson with East and the rest in no very good
temper, and then went out into the quadrangle.  About ten
minutes before school Martin and Arthur arrived in the
quadrangle breathless; and catching sight of him, Arthur rushed
up, all excitement, and with a bright glow on his face.</P>
<P>&quot;O Tom, look here!&quot; cried he, holding out three moor-hen's eggs;
&quot;we've been down the Barby road, to the pool Martin told us of
last night, and just see what we've got.&quot;</P>
<P>Tom wouldn't be pleased, and only looked out for something to
find fault with.</P>
<P>&quot;Why, young un,&quot; said he, &quot;what have you been after?  You don't
mean to say you've been wading?&quot;</P>
<P>The tone of reproach made poor little Arthur shrink up in a
moment and look piteous; and Tom with a shrug of his shoulders
turned his anger on Martin.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, I didn't think, Madman, that you'd have been such a muff
as to let him be getting wet through at this time of day.  You
might have done the wading yourself.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;So I did, of course; only he would come in too, to see the
nest.  We left six eggs in.  They'll be hatched in a day or
two.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hang the eggs!&quot; said Tom; &quot;a fellow can't turn his back for a
moment but all his work's undone.  He'll be laid up for a week
for this precious lark, I'll be bound.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, Tom, now,&quot; pleaded Arthur, &quot;my feet ain't wet, for
Martin made me take off my shoes and stockings and trousers.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;But they are wet, and dirty too; can't I see?&quot; answered Tom;
&quot;and you'll be called up and floored when the master sees what a
state you're in.  You haven't looked at second lesson, you
know.&quot;</P>
<P>O Tom, you old humbug! you to be upbraiding any one with not
learning their lessons!  If you hadn't been floored yourself now
at first lesson, do you mean to say you wouldn't have been with
them?  And you've taken away all poor little Arthur's joy and
pride in his first birds' eggs, and he goes and puts them down
in the study, and takes down his books with a sigh, thinking he
has done something horribly wrong, whereas he has learnt on in
advance much more than will be done at second lesson.</P>
<P>But the old Madman hasn't, and gets called up, and makes some
frightful shots, losing about ten places, and all but getting
floored.  This somewhat appeases Tom's wrath, and by the end of
the lesson he has regained his temper.  And afterwards in their
study he begins to get right again, as he watches Arthur's
intense joy at seeing Martin blowing the eggs and gluing them
carefully on to bits of cardboard, and notes the anxious, loving
looks which the little fellow casts sidelong at him.  And then
he thinks, &quot;What an ill-tempered beast I am!  Here's just what I
was wishing for last night come about, and I'm spoiling it all,&quot;
and in another five minutes has swallowed the last mouthful of
his bile, and is repaid by seeing his little sensitive plant
expand again and sun itself in his smiles.</P>
<P>After dinner the Madman is busy with the preparations for their
expedition, fitting new straps on to his climbing-irons, filling
large pill-boxes with cotton-wool, and sharpening East's small
axe.  They carry all their munitions into calling-overs and
directly afterwards, having dodged such prepostors as are on the
lookout for fags at cricket, the four set off at a smart trot
down the Lawford footpath, straight for Caldecott's Spinney and
the hawk's nest.</P>
<P>Martin leads the way in high feather; it is quite a new
sensation to him, getting companions, and he finds it very
pleasant, and means to show them all manner of proofs of his
science and skill.  Brown and East may be better at cricket and
football and games, thinks he, but out in the fields and woods
see if I can't teach them something.  He has taken the
leadership already, and strides away in front with his climbing-
irons strapped under one arm, his pecking-bag under the other,
and his pockets and hat full of pill-boxes, cotton-wool, and
other etceteras.  Each of the others carries a pecking-bag, and
East his hatchet.</P>
<P>When they had crossed three or four fields without a check,
Arthur began to lag; and Tom seeing this shouted to Martin to
pull up a bit.  &quot;We ain't out hare-and-hounds.  What's the good
of grinding on at this rate?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;There's the Spinney,&quot; said Martin, pulling up on the brow of a
slope at the bottom of which lay Lawford brook, and pointing to
the top of the opposite slope; &quot;the nest is in one of those high
fir-trees at this end.  And down by the brook there I know of a
sedge-bird's nest.  We'll go and look at it coming back.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, come on, don't let us stop,&quot; said Arthur, who was getting
excited at the sight of the wood.  So they broke into a trot
again, and were soon across the brook, up the slope, and into
the Spinney.  Here they advanced as noiselessly as possible,
lest keepers or other enemies should be about, and stopped at
the foot of a tall fir, at the top of which Martin pointed out
with pride the kestrel's nest, the object of their quest.</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, where? which is it?&quot; asks Arthur, gaping up in the air, and
having the most vague idea of what it would be like.</P>
<P>&quot;There, don't you see?&quot; said East, pointing to a lump of
mistletoe in the next tree, which was a beech.  He saw that
Martin and Tom were busy with the climbing-irons, and couldn't
resist the temptation of hoaxing.  Arthur stared and wondered
more than ever.</P>
<P>&quot;Well, how curious!  It doesn't look a bit like what I
expected,&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Very odd birds, kestrels,&quot; said East, looking waggishly at his
victim, who was still star-gazing.</P>
<P>&quot;But I thought it was in a fir-tree?&quot; objected Arthur.</P>
<P>&quot;Ah, don't you know?  That's a new sort of fir which old
Caldecott brought from the Himalayas.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Really!&quot; said Arthur; &quot;I'm glad I know that.  How unlike our
firs they are!  They do very well too here, don't they?  The
Spinney's full of them.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;What's that humbug he's telling you?&quot; cried Tom, looking up,
having caught the word Himalayas, and suspecting what East was
after.</P>
<P>&quot;Only about this fir,&quot; said Arthur, putting his hand on the stem
of the beech.</P>
<P>&quot;Fir!&quot; shouted Tom; &quot;why, you don't mean to say, young un, you
don't know a beech when you see one?&quot;</P>
<P>Poor little Arthur looked terribly ashamed, and East exploded in
laughter which made the wood ring.</P>
<P>&quot;I've hardly ever seen any trees,&quot; faltered Arthur.</P>
<P>&quot;What a shame to hoax him, Scud!&quot; cried Martin.  - &quot;Never mind,
Arthur; you shall know more about trees than he does in a week
or two.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And isn't that the kestrel's nest, then?&quot; asked Arthur.  &quot;That!
Why, that's a piece of mistletoe.  There's the nest, that lump
of sticks up this fir.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Don't believe him, Arthur,&quot; struck in the incorrigible East; &quot;I
just saw an old magpie go out of it.&quot;</P>
<P>Martin did not deign to reply to this sally, except by a grunt,
as he buckled the last buckle of his climbing-irons, and Arthur
looked reproachfully at East without speaking.</P>
<P>But now came the tug of war.  It was a very difficult tree to
climb until the branches were reached, the first of which was
some fourteen feet up, for the trunk was too large at the bottom
to be swarmed; in fact, neither of the boys could reach more
than half round it with their arms.  Martin and Tom, both of
whom had irons on, tried it without success at first; the fir
bark broke away where they stuck the irons in as soon as they
leant any weight on their feet, and the grip of their arms
wasn't enough to keep them up; so, after getting up three or
four feet, down they came slithering to the ground, barking
their arms and faces.  They were furious, and East sat by
laughing and shouting at each failure, &quot;Two to one on the old
magpie!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;We must try a pyramid,&quot; said Tom at last.  &quot;Now, Scud, you lazy
rascal, stick yourself against the tree!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I dare say! and have you standing on my shoulders with the
irons on.  What do you think my skin's made of?&quot;  However, up he
got, and leant against the tree, putting his head down and
clasping it with his arms as far as he could.</P>
<P>&quot;Now then, Madman,&quot; said Tom, &quot;you next.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, I'm lighter than you; you go next.&quot;  So Tom got on East's
shoulders, and grasped the tree above, and then Martin scrambled
up on to Tom's shoulders, amidst the totterings and groanings of
the pyramid, and, with a spring which sent his supporters
howling to the ground, clasped the stem some ten feet up, and
remained clinging.  For a moment or two they thought he couldn't
get up; but then, holding on with arms and teeth, he worked
first one iron then the other firmly into the bark, got another
grip with his arms, and in another minute had hold of the lowest
branch.</P>
<P>&quot;All up with the old magpie now,&quot; said East; and after a
minute's rest, up went Martin, hand over hand, watched by Arthur
with fearful eagerness.</P>
<P>&quot;Isn't it very dangerous?&quot; said he.</P>
<P>&quot;Not a bit,&quot; answered Tom; &quot;you can't hurt if you only get good
hand-hold.  Try every branch with a good pull before you trust
it, and then up you go.&quot;</P>
<P>Martin was now amongst the small branches close to the nest, and
away dashed the old bird, and soared up above the trees,
watching the intruder.</P>
<P>&quot;All right - four eggs!&quot; shouted he.</P>
<P>&quot;Take 'em all!&quot; shouted East; &quot;that'll be one a-piece.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;No, no; leave one, and then she won t care, said Tom.</P>
<P>We boys had an idea that birds couldn't count, and were quite
content as long as you left one egg.  I hope it is so.</P>
<P>Martin carefully put one egg into each of his boxes and the
third into his mouth, the only other place of safety, and came
down like a lamplighter.  All went well till he was within ten
feet of the ground, when, as the trunk enlarged, his hold got
less and less firm, and at last down he came with a run,
tumbling on to his back on the turf, spluttering and spitting
out the remains of the great egg, which had broken by the jar of
his fall.</P>
<P>&quot;Ugh, ugh! something to drink - ugh! it was addled,&quot; spluttered
he, while the wood rang again with the merry laughter of East
and Tom.</P>
<P>Then they examined the prizes, gathered up their things, and
went off to the brook, where Martin swallowed huge draughts of
water to get rid of the taste; and they visited the sedge-bird's
nest, and from thence struck across the country in high glee,
beating the hedges and brakes as they went along; and Arthur at
last, to his intense delight, was allowed to climb a small
hedgerow oak for a magpie's nest with Tom, who kept all round
him like a mother, and showed him where to hold and how to throw
his weight; and though he was in a great fright, didn't show it,
and was applauded by all for his lissomness.</P>
<P>They crossed a road soon afterwards, and there, close to them,
lay a great heap of charming pebbles.</P>
<P>&quot;Look here,&quot; shouted East; &quot;here's luck!  I've been longing for
some good, honest pecking this half-hour.  Let's fill the bags,
and have no more of this foozling bird-nesting.&quot;</P>
<P>No one objected, so each boy filled the fustian bag he carried
full of stones.  They crossed into the next field, Tom and East
taking one side of the hedges, and the other two the other side.
Noise enough they made certainly, but it was too early in the
season for the young birds, and the old birds were too strong on
the wing for our young marksmen, and flew out of shot after the
first discharge.  But it was great fun, rushing along the
hedgerows, and discharging stone after stone at blackbirds and
chaffinches, though no result in the shape of slaughtered birds
was obtained; and Arthur soon entered into it, and rushed to
head back the birds, and shouted, and threw, and tumbled into
ditches, and over and through hedges, as wild as the Madman
himself.</P>
<P>Presently the party, in full cry after an old blackbird (who was
evidently used to the thing and enjoyed the fun, for he would
wait till they came close to him, and then fly on for forty
yards or so, and, with an impudent flicker of his tail, dart
into the depths of the quickset), came beating down a high
double hedge, two on each side.</P>
<P>&quot;There he is again,&quot; &quot;Head him,&quot; &quot;Let drive,&quot; &quot;I had him there,&quot;
&quot;Take care where you're throwing, Madman.&quot;  The shouts might
have been heard a quarter of a mile off.  They were heard some
two hundred yards off by a farmer and two of his shepherds, who
were doctoring sheep in a fold in the next field.</P>
<P>Now, the farmer in question rented a house and yard situate at
the end of the field in which the young bird-fanciers had
arrived, which house and yard he didn't occupy or keep any one
else in.  Nevertheless, like a brainless and unreasoning Briton,
he persisted in maintaining on the premises a large stock of
cocks, hens, and other poultry.  Of course, all sorts of
depredators visited the place from time to time:  foxes and
gipsies wrought havoc in the night; while in the daytime, I
regret to have to confess that visits from the Rugby boys, and
consequent disappearances of ancient and respectable fowls were
not unfrequent.  Tom and East had during the period of their
outlawry visited the farm in question for felonious purposes,
and on one occasion had conquered and slain a duck there, and
borne away the carcass triumphantly, hidden in their
handkerchiefs.  However, they were sickened of the practice by
the trouble and anxiety which the wretched duck's body caused
them.  They carried it to Sally Harrowell's, in hopes of a good
supper; but she, after examining it, made a long face, and
refused to dress or have anything to do with it.  Then they took
it into their study, and began plucking it themselves; but what
to do with the feathers, where to hide them?</P>
<P>&quot;Good gracious, Tom, what a lot of feathers a duck has!&quot; groaned
East, holding a bagful in his hand, and looking disconsolately
at the carcass, not yet half plucked.</P>
<P>&quot;And I do think he's getting high, too, already,&quot; said Tom,
smelling at him cautiously, &quot;so we must finish him up soon.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, all very well; but how are we to cook him?  I'm sure I
ain't going to try it on in the hall or passages; we can't
afford to be roasting ducks about - our character's too bad.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I wish we were rid of the brute,&quot; said Tom, throwing him on the
table in disgust.  And after a day or two more it became clear
that got rid of he must be; so they packed him and sealed him up
in brown paper, and put him in the cupboard of an unoccupied
study, where he was found in the holidays by the matron, a
gruesome body.</P>
<P>They had never been duck-hunting there since, but others had,
and the bold yeoman was very sore on the subject, and bent on
making an example of the first boys he could catch.  So he and
his shepherds crouched behind the hurdles, and watched the
party, who were approaching all unconscious.  Why should that
old guinea-fowl be lying out in the hedge just at this
particular moment of all the year?  Who can say?  Guinea-fowls
always are; so are all other things, animals, and persons,
requisite for getting one into scrapes - always ready when any
mischief can come of them.  At any rate, just under East's nose
popped out the old guinea-hen, scuttling along and shrieking,
&quot;Come back, come back,&quot; at the top of her voice.  Either of the
other three might perhaps have withstood the temptation, but
East first lets drive the stone he has in his hand at her, and
then rushes to turn her into the hedge again.  He succeeds, and
then they are all at it for dear life, up and down the hedge in
full cry, the &quot;Come back, come back,&quot; getting shriller and
fainter every minute.</P>
<P>Meantime, the farmer and his men steal over the hurdles and
creep down the hedge towards the scene of action.  They are
almost within a stone's throw of Martin, who is pressing the
unlucky chase hard, when Tom catches sight of them, and sings
out, &quot;Louts, 'ware louts, your side!  Madman, look ahead!&quot; and
then catching hold of Arthur, hurries him away across the field
towards Rugby as hard as they can tear.  Had he been by himself,
he would have stayed to see it out with the others, but now his
heart sinks and all his pluck goes.  The idea of being led up to
the Doctor with Arthur for bagging fowls quite unmans and takes
half the run out of him.</P>
<P>However, no boys are more able to take care of themselves than
East and Martin; they dodge the pursuers, slip through a gap,
and come pelting after Tom and Arthur, whom they catch up in no
time.  The farmer and his men are making good running about a
field behind.  Tom wishes to himself that they had made off in
any other direction, but now they are all in for it together,
and must see it out.</P>
<P>&quot;You won't leave the young un, will you?&quot; says he, as they haul
poor little Arthur, already losing wind from the fright, through
the next hedge.  &quot;Not we,&quot; is the answer from both.  The next
hedge is a stiff one; the pursuers gain horribly on them, and
they only just pull Arthur through, with two great rents in his
trousers, as the foremost shepherd comes up on the other side.
As they start into the next field, they are aware of two figures
walking down the footpath in the middle of it, and recognize
Holmes and Diggs taking a constitutional.  Those good-natured
fellows immediately shout, &quot;On.&quot;  &quot;Let's go to them and
surrender,&quot; pants Tom.  Agreed.  And in another minute the four
boys, to the great astonishment of those worthies, rush
breathless up to Holmes and Diggs, who pull up to see what is
the matter; and then the whole is explained by the appearance of
the farmer and his men, who unite their forces and bear down on
the knot of boys.</P>
<P>There is no time to explain, and Tom's heart beats frightfully
quick, as he ponders, &quot;Will they stand by us?&quot;</P>
<P>The farmer makes a rush at East and collars him; and that young
gentleman, with unusual discretion, instead of kicking his
shins, looks appealingly at Holmes, and stands still.</P>
<P>&quot;Hullo there; not so fast,&quot; says Holmes, who is bound to stand
up for them till they are proved in the wrong.  &quot;Now what's all
this about?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I've got the young varmint at last, have I,&quot; pants the farmer;
&quot;why, they've been a-skulking about my yard and stealing my
fowls - that's where 'tis; and if I doan't have they flogged for
it, every one on 'em, my name ain't Thompson.&quot;</P>
<P>Holmes looks grave and Diggs's face falls.  They are quite ready
to fight - no boys in the school more so; but they are
prepostors, and understand their office, and can't uphold
unrighteous causes.</P>
<P>&quot;I haven't been near his old barn this half,&quot; cries East.  &quot;Nor
I,&quot; &quot;Nor I,&quot; chime in Tom and Martin.</P>
<P>&quot;Now, Willum, didn't you see 'em there last week?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Ees, I seen 'em sure enough,&quot; says Willum, grasping a prong he
carried, and preparing for action.</P>
<P>The boys deny stoutly, and Willum is driven to admit that &quot;if it
worn't they 'twas chaps as like 'em as two peas'n;&quot; and
&quot;leastways he'll swear he see'd them two in the yard last
Martinmas,&quot; indicating East and Tom.</P>
<P>Holmes has had time to meditate.  &quot;Now, sir,&quot; says he to Willum,
&quot;you see you can't remember what you have seen, and I believe
the boys.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;I doan't care,&quot; blusters the farmer; &quot;they was arter my fowls
to-day - that's enough for I.  - Willum, you catch hold o'
t'other chap.  They've been a-sneaking about this two hours, I
tells 'ee,&quot; shouted he, as Holmes stands between Martin and
Willum, &quot;and have druv a matter of a dozen young pullets pretty
nigh to death.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, there's a whacker!&quot; cried East; &quot;we haven't been within a
hundred yards of his barn; we haven't been up here above ten
minutes, and we've seen nothing but a tough old guinea-hen, who
ran like a greyhound.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Indeed, that's all true, Holmes, upon my honour,&quot; added Tom;
&quot;we weren't after his fowls; guinea-hen ran out of the hedge
under our feet, and we've seen nothing else.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Drat their talk.  Thee catch hold o' t'other, Willum, and come
along wi' un.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Farmer Thompson,&quot; said Holmes, warning off Willum and the prong
with his stick, while Diggs faced the other shepherd, cracking
his fingers like pistol-shots, &quot;now listen to reason.  The boys
haven't been after your fowls, that's plain.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Tells 'ee I see'd'em.  Who be you, I should like to know?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Never you mind, farmer,&quot; answered Holmes.  &quot;And now I'll just
tell you what it is:  you ought to be ashamed of yourself for
leaving all that poultry about, with no one to watch it, so near
the School.  You deserve to have it all stolen.  So if you
choose to come up to the Doctor with them, I shall go with you,
and tell him what I think of it.&quot;</P>
<P>The farmer began to take Holmes for a master; besides, he wanted
to get back to his flock.  Corporal punishment was out of the
question, the odds were too great; so he began to hint at paying
for the damage.  Arthur jumped at this, offering to pay
anything, and the farmer immediately valued the guinea-hen at
half a sovereign.</P>
<P>&quot;Half a sovereign!&quot; cried East, now released from the farmer's
grip; &quot;well, that is a good one!  The old hen ain't hurt a bit,
and she's seven years old, I know, and as tough as whipcord; she
couldn't lay another egg to save her life.&quot;</P>
<P>It was at last settled that they should pay the farmer two
shillings, and his man one shilling; and so the matter ended, to
the unspeakable relief of Tom, who hadn't been able to say a
word, being sick at heart at the idea of what the Doctor would
think of him; and now the whole party of boys marched off down
the footpath towards Rugby.  Holmes, who was one of the best
boys in the School, began to improve the occasion.  &quot;Now, you
youngsters,&quot; said he, as he marched along in the middle of them,
&quot;mind this; you're very well out of this scrape.  Don't you go
near Thompson's barn again; do you hear?&quot;</P>
<P>Profuse promises from all, especially East.</P>
<P>&quot;Mind, I don't ask questions,&quot; went on Mentor, &quot;but I rather
think some of you have been there before this after his
chickens.  Now, knocking over other people's chickens, and
running off with them, is stealing.  It's a nasty word, but
that's the plain English of it.  If the chickens were dead and
lying in a shop, you wouldn't take them, I know that, any more
than you would apples out of Griffith's basket; but there's no
real difference between chickens running about and apples on a
tree, and the same articles in a shop.  I wish our morals were
sounder in such matters.  There's nothing so mischievous as
these school distinctions, which jumble up right and wrong, and
justify things in us for which poor boys would be sent to
prison.&quot;  And good old Holmes delivered his soul on the walk
home of many wise sayings, and, as the song says&mdash;</P>
<blockquote>&quot;Gee'd 'em a sight of good advice;&quot;</blockquote>
<P>which same sermon sank into them all, more or less, and very
penitent they were for several hours.  But truth compels me to
admit that East, at any rate, forgot it all in a week, but
remembered the insult which had been put upon him by Farmer
Thompson, and with the Tadpole and other hair-brained youngsters
committed a raid on the barn soon afterwards, in which they were
caught by the shepherds and severely handled, besides having to
pay eight shillings - all the money they had in the world - to
escape being taken up to the Doctor.</P>
<P>Martin became a constant inmate in the joint study from this
time, and Arthur took to him so kindly that Tom couldn't resist
slight fits of jealousy, which, however, he managed to keep to
himself.  The kestrel's eggs had not been broken, strange to
say, and formed the nucleus of Arthur's collection, at which
Martin worked heart and soul, and introduced Arthur to Howlett
the bird-fancier, and instructed him in the rudiments of the art
of stuffing.  In token of his gratitude, Arthur allowed Martin
to tattoo a small anchor on one of his wrists; which decoration,
however, he carefully concealed from Tom.  Before the end of the
half-year he had trained into a bold climber and good runner,
and, as Martin had foretold, knew twice as much about trees,
birds, flowers, and many other things, as our good-hearted and
facetious young friend Harry East.</P>
