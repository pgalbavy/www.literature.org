<P>
The Prince crossed the hail and entered the morning-room.  Felix
was there and Raoul de Brouillac.  The Duchess sat at her
writing-table, scribbling a note.  Lady Carey, in a wonderful white
serge costume, and a huge bunch of Neapolitan violets at her bosom,
was lounging in an easy-chair, swinging her foot backwards and
forwards.  The Duke, in a very old tweed coat, but immaculate as to
linen and the details of his toilet, stood a little apart, with a
frown upon his forehead, and exactly that absorbed air which in the
House of Lords usually indicated his intention to make a speech.  The
entrance of the Prince, who carefully closed the door behind him,
was an event for which evidently they were all waiting.
<P>
"My good people," he said blandly, "I wish you all a very
good-morning."
<P>
There was a little murmur of greetings, and before they had all
subsided the Duke spoke.
<P>
"Saxe Leinitzer," he said, "I have a few questions to ask you."
<P>
The Prince looked across the room at him.
<P>
"By all means, Duke," he said.  "But is the present an opportune
time?"
<P>
"Opportune or no, it is the time which I have selected," the Duke
answered stiffly.  "I do not altogether understand what is going
on in this house.  I am beginning to wonder whether I have been
misled."
<P>
The Prince, as he twirled his fair moustache, glanced carelessly
enough across at the Duchess.  She was looking the other way.
<P>
"I became a - er - general member of this Society," the Duke
continued, "sympathising heartily with its objects as explained to
me by you, Prince, and believing, although to confess it is somewhat
of a humiliation, that a certain amount of - er - combination
amongst the aristocracy has become necessary to resist the terrible
increase of Socialism which we must all so much deplore."
<P>
"You are not making a speech, dear," the Duchess remarked, looking
coldly across the room at him.  "We are all anxious to hear what
the Prince has to say to us."
<P>
"Your anxiety," the Duke continued, "and the anxiety of our friends
must be restrained for a few minutes, for there are certain things
which I am determined to say, and to say them now.  I must confess
that it was at first a painful shock to me to realise that the time
had come when it was necessary for us to take any heed of the
uneducated rabble who seem born into the world discontented with
their station in life, and instead of making honest attempts to
improve it waste their time railing against us who are more
fortunately placed, and in endeavours to mislead in every possible
way the electorate of the country."
<P>
The Prince sighed softly, and lit a cigarette.  Lady Carey and
Felix were already smoking.
<P>
"However," the Duke continued, "I was convinced.  I have always
believed in the principle of watching closely the various signs
of the times, and I may say that I came to the conclusion that a
combination of the thinking members of the aristocratic party
throughout the world was an excellent idea.  I therefore became
what is, I believe, called a general member of the Order, of
which I believe you, Prince, are the actual head."
<P>
"My dear James," the Duchess murmured, "the Prince has something
to say to us."
<P>
"The Prince," her husband answered coldly, "can keep back his
information for a few minutes.  I am determined to place my position
clearly before all of you who are present here now.  It is only
since I have joined this Society that I have been made aware that
in addition to the general members, of which body I believe that
the Duchess and I are the sole representatives here, there are
special members, and members of the inner circle.  And I understand
that in connection with these there is a great machinery of intrigue
going on all the time, with branches all over the world, spies
everywhere with unlimited funds, and with huge opportunities of
good or evil.  In effect I have become an outside member of what is
nothing more nor less than a very powerful and, it seems to me,
daring secret society."
<P>
"So far as you are concerned, Duke," the Prince said, "your
responsibility ceases with ordinary membership.  You can take no
count of anything beyond.  The time may come when the inner circle
may be opened to you."
<P>
The Duke coughed.
<P>
"You misapprehend me," he said.  "I can assure you I am not anxious
for promotion.  On the contrary, I stand before you an aggrieved
person.  I have come to the conclusion that my house, and the
shelter of my wife's name, have been used for a plot, the main
points of which have been kept wholly secret from me."
<P>
The Prince flicked his cigarette ash into the grate.
<P>
"My dear Dorset," he said gently, "if you will allow me to explain -"
<P>
"I thank you, Saxe Leinitzer," the Duke said coldly, "but it is
beginning to occur to me that I have had enough of your explanations.
It seemed natural enough to me, and I must say well conceived, that
some attempt should be made to modify the views of, if not wholly
convert, Reginald Brott by means of the influence of a very charming
woman.  It was my duty as a member of the Order to assist in this,
and the shelter of my house and name were freely accorded to the
Countess.  But it is news to me to find that she was brought here
practically by force.  That because she was an inner member and
therefore bound to implicit obedience that she was dragged away from
her husband, kept apart from him against her will, forced into
endeavours to make a fool of Brott even at the cost of her good name.
And now, worst of all, I am told that a very deeply laid plot on
the part of some of you will compel her to leave England almost at
once, and that her safety depends upon her inducing Reginald Brott
to accompany her."
<P>
"She has appealed to you," the Prince muttered.
<P>
"She has done nothing so sensible," the Duke answered drily.  "The
facts which I have just stated are known to every one in this room.
I perhaps know less than any one.  But I know enough for this.  I
request, Saxe Leinitzer, that you withdraw the name of myself and
my wife from your list of members, and that you understand clearly
that my house is to be no more used for meetings of the Society,
formal or informal.  And, further, though I regret the apparent
inhospitality of my action, my finger is now, as you see, upon the
bell, and I venture to wish you all a very good-morning.  Groves,"
he added to the servant who answered the door, "the Prince of Saxe
Leinitzer's carriage is urgently required."
<P>
The Prince and Lady Carey descended the broad steps side by side.
She was laughing softly but immoderately.  The Prince was pale
with fury.
<P>
"Pompous old ass," he muttered savagely.  "He may have a worse
scandal in his house now than he dreams of."
<P>
She wiped her eyes.
<P>
"Have I not always told you," she said, "that intrigue in this
country was a sheer impossibility?  You may lay your plans ever so
carefully, but you cannot foresee such a contretemps as this."
<P>
"Idiot!" the Prince cried, "Oh, the dolt!  Why, even his wife was
amazed."
<P>
"He may be all those pleasant things," Lady Carey, said, "but he
is a gentleman."
<P>
He stopped short.  The footman was standing by the side of Lady
Carey's victoria with a rug on his arm.
<P>
"Lucille," he said thoughtfully, "is locked in the morning-room.
She is prostrate with fear.  If the Duke sees her everything is
over.  Upon my word, I have a good mind to throw this all up and
cross to Paris to-night.  Let England breed her own revolutions.
What do you say, Muriel?  Will you come with me?"
<P>
She laughed scornfully.
<P>
"I'd as soon go with my coachman," she said.
<P>
His eyebrows narrowed.  A dull, purple flush crept to his forehead.
<P>
"Your wit," he said, "is a little coarse.  Listen!  You wish our
first plan to go through?"
<P>
"Of course!"
<P>
"Then you must get Lucille out of that house.  If she is left there
she is absolutely lost to us.  Apart from that, she is herself not
safe.  Our plan worked out too well.  She is really in danger from
this Duson affair."
<P>
The laughter died away from Lady Carey's face.  She hesitated with
her foot upon the step of her carriage.
<P>
"You can go back easily enough," the Prince said.  "You are the
Duke's cousin, and you were not included in his tirade.  Lucille is
in the morning-room, and here is the key.  I brought it away with me.
You must tell her that all our plans are broken, that we have
certain knowledge that the police are on the track of this Duson
affair.  Get her to your house in Pont Street, and I will be round
this afternoon.  Or better still, take her to mine."
<P>
Lady Carey stepped back on to the pavement.  She was still, however,
hesitating.
<P>
"Leave her with the Duke and Duchess," the Prince said, "and she will
dine with her husband to-night."
<P>
Lady Carey took the key from his hand.
<P>
"I will try," she said.  "How shall you know whether I succeed?"
<P>
"I will wait in the gardens," he answered.  "I shall be out of sight,
but I shall be able to see you come out.  If you are alone I shall
come to you.  If she is with you I shall be at your house in an
hour, and I promise you that she shall leave England to-night with
me."
<P>
"Poor Brott!" she murmured ironically.
<P>
The Prince smiled.
<P>
"He will follow her.  Every one will believe that they left London
together.  That is all that is required."
<P>
Lady Carey re-entered the house.  The Prince made his way into the
gardens.  Ten minutes passed - a quarter of an hour.  Then Lady Carey
with Lucille reappeared, and stepping quickly into the victoria were
driven away.  The Prince drew a little sigh of relief.  He looked at
his watch, called a hansom, and drove to his club for lunch.
<P>
Another man, who had also been watching Dorset Rouse from the
gardens for several hours, also noted Lucille's advent with relief.
He followed the Prince out and entered another hansom.
<P>
"Follow that victoria which has just driven off," he ordered.
"Don't lose sight of it.  Double fare."
<P>
The trap-door fell, and the man whipped up his horse.
