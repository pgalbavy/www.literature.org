<p>It was night--dead night--and the silence lay on the Frowning City like
a cloud.
</p>
<p>Secretly, as evildoers, Sir Henry Curtis, Umslopogaas, and myself
threaded our way through the passages towards a by-entrance to the great
Throne Chamber. Once we were met by the fierce rattling challenge of the
sentry. I gave the countersign, and the man grounded his spear and let
us pass. Also we were officers of the Queens’ bodyguard, and in that
capacity had a right to come and go unquestioned.
</p><p>We gained the hall in safety. So empty and so still was it, that even
when we had passed the sound of our footsteps yet echoed up the lofty
walls, vibrating faintly and still more faintly against the carven roof,
like ghosts of the footsteps of dead men haunting the place that once
they trod.
</p><p>It was an eerie spot, and it oppressed me. The moon was full, and threw
great pencils and patches of light through the high windowless openings
in the walls, that lay pure and beautiful upon the blackness of the
marble floor, like white flowers on a coffin. One of these silver arrows
fell upon the statue of the sleeping Rademas, and of the angel form bent
over him, illumining it, and a small circle round it, with a soft clear
light, reminding me of that with which Catholics illumine the altars of
their cathedrals.
</p><p>Here by the statue we took our stand, and waited. Sir Henry and I close
together, Umslopogaas some paces off in the darkness, so that I could
only just make out his towering outline leaning on the outline of an
axe.
</p><p>So long did we wait that I almost fell asleep resting against the cold
marble, but was suddenly aroused by hearing Curtis give a quick catching
breath. Then from far away there came a little sound as though the
statues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message
of the ages.
</p><p>It was the faint sweep of a lady’s dress. Nearer it grew, and nearer
yet. We could see a figure steal from patch to patch of moonlight, and
even hear the soft fall of sandalled feet. Another second and I saw
the black silhouette of the old Zulu raise its arm in mute salute, and
Nyleptha was before us.
</p><p>Oh, how beautiful she looked as she paused a moment just within the
circle of the moonlight! Her hand was pressed upon her heart, and her
white bosom heaved beneath it. Round her head a broidered scarf was
loosely thrown, partially shadowing the perfect face, and thus rendering
it even more lovely; for beauty, dependent as it is to a certain extent
upon the imagination, is never so beautiful as when it is half hid.
There she stood radiant but half doubting, stately and yet so sweet. It
was but a moment, but I then and there fell in love with her myself,
and have remained so to this hour; for, indeed, she looked more like
an angel out of heaven than a loving, passionate, mortal woman. Low we
bowed before her, and then she spoke.
</p><p>‘I have come,’ she whispered, ‘but it was at great risk. Ye know not how
I am watched. The priests watch me. Sorais watches me with those great
eyes of hers. My very guards are spies upon me. Nasta watches me too.
Oh, let him be careful!’ and she stamped her foot. ‘Let him be careful;
I am a woman, and therefore hard to drive. Ay, and I am a Queen, too,
and can still avenge. Let him be careful, I say, lest in place of giving
him my hand I take his head,’ and she ended the outburst with a little
sob, and then smiled up at us bewitchingly and laughed.
</p><p>‘Thou didst bid me come hither, my Lord Incubu’ (Curtis had taught her
to call him so). ‘Doubtless it is about business of the State, for I
know that thou art ever full of great ideas and plans for my welfare
and my people’s. So even as a Queen should I have come, though I greatly
fear the dark alone,’ and again she laughed and gave him a glance from
her grey eyes.
</p><p>At this point I thought it wise to move a little, since secrets ‘of the
State’ should not be made public property; but she would not let me go
far, peremptorily stopping me within five yards or so, saying that she
feared surprise. So it came to pass that, however unwillingly, I heard
all that passed.
</p><p>‘Thou knowest, Nyleptha,’ said Sir Henry, ‘that it was for none of these
things that I asked thee to meet me at this lonely place. Nyleptha,
waste not the time in pleasantry, but listen to me, for--I love thee.’
</p><p>As he said the words I saw her face break up, as it were, and change.
The coquetry went out of it, and in its place there shone a great light
of love which seemed to glorify it, and make it like that of the marble
angel overhead. I could not help thinking that it must have been a touch
of prophetic instinct which made the long dead Rademas limn, in the
features of the angel of his inspiring vision, so strange a likeness of
his own descendant. Sir Henry, also, must have observed and been struck
by the likeness, for, catching the look upon Nyleptha’s face, he glanced
quickly from it to the moonlit statue, and then back again at his
beloved.
</p><p>‘Thou sayest thou dost love me,’ she said in a low voice, ‘and thy voice
rings true, but how am I to know that thou dost speak the truth?’
</p><p>‘Though,’ she went on with proud humility, and in the stately third
person which is so largely used by the Zu-Vendi, ‘I be as nothing in the
eyes of my lord,’ and she curtseyed towards him, ‘who comes from among
a wonderful people, to whom my people are but children, yet here am I
a queen and a leader of men, and if I would go to battle a hundred
thousand spears shall sparkle in my train like stars glimmering down the
path of the bent moon. And although my beauty be a little thing in
the eyes of my lord,’ and she lifted her broidered skirt and curtseyed
again, ‘yet here among my own people am I held right fair, and ever
since I was a woman the great lords of my kingdom have made quarrel
concerning me, as though forsooth,’ she added with a flash of passion,
‘I were a deer to be pulled down by the hungriest wolf, or a horse to
be sold to the highest bidder. Let my lord pardon me if I weary my lord,
but it hath pleased my lord to say that he loves me, Nyleptha, a Queen
of the Zu-Vendi, and therefore would I say that though my love and my
hand be not much to my lord, yet to me are they all.’
</p><p>‘Oh!’ she cried, with a sudden and thrilling change of voice, and
modifying her dignified mode of address. ‘Oh, how can I know that thou
lovest but me? How can I know that thou wilt not weary of me and seek
thine own place again, leaving me desolate? Who is there to tell me but
that thou lovest some other woman, some fair woman unknown to me, but
who yet draws breath beneath this same moon that shines on me tonight?
Tell me <u>how</u> am I to know?’ And she clasped her hands and stretched
them out towards him and looked appealingly into his face.
</p><p>‘Nyleptha,’ answered Sir Henry, adopting the Zu-Vendi way of speech; ‘I
have told thee that I love thee; how am I to tell thee how much I love
thee? Is there then a measure for love? Yet will I try. I say not that I
have never looked upon another woman with favour, but this I say that
I love thee with all my life and with all my strength; that I love thee
now and shall love thee till I grow cold in death, ay, and as I believe
beyond my death, and on and on for ever: I say that thy voice is music
to my ear, and thy touch as water to a thirsty land, that when thou art
there the world is beautiful, and when I see thee not it is as though
the light was dead. Oh, Nyleptha, I will never leave thee; here and now
for thy dear sake I will forget my people and my father’s house, yea,
I renounce them all. By thy side will I live, Nyleptha, and at thy side
will I die.’
</p><p>He paused and gazed at her earnestly, but she hung her head like a lily,
and said never a word.
</p><p>‘Look!’ he went on, pointing to the statue on which the moonlight played
so brightly. ‘Thou seest that angel woman who rests her hand upon the
forehead of the sleeping man, and thou seest how at her touch his soul
flames up and shines out through his flesh, even as a lamp at the touch
of the fire, so is it with me and thee, Nyleptha. Thou hast awakened my
soul and called it forth, and now, Nyleptha, it is not mine, not mine,
but <u>thine</u> and thine only. There is no more for me to say; in thy hands
is my life.’ And he leaned back against the pedestal of the statue,
looking very pale, and his eyes shining, but proud and handsome as a
god.
</p><p>Slowly, slowly she raised her head, and fixed her wonderful eyes, all
alight with the greatness of her passion, full upon his face, as though
to read his very soul. Then at last she spoke, low indeed, but clearly
as a silver bell.
</p><p>‘Of a truth, weak woman that I am, I do believe thee. Ill will be the
day for thee and for me also if it be my fate to learn that I have
believed a lie. And now hearken to me, oh man, who hath wandered here
from far to steal my heart and make me all thine own. I put my hand upon
thy hand thus, and thus I, whose lips have never kissed before, do kiss
thee on the brow; and now by my hand and by that first and holy kiss,
ay, by my people’s weal and by my throne that like enough I shall lose
for thee--by the name of my high House, by the sacred Stone and by the
eternal majesty of the Sun, I swear that for thee will I live and die.
And I swear that I will love thee and thee only till death, ay, and
beyond, if as thou sayest there be a beyond, and that thy will shall be
my will, and thy ways my ways.
</p><p>‘Oh see, see, my lord! thou knowest not how humble is she who loves; I,
who am a Queen, I kneel before thee, even at thy feet I do my homage;’
and the lovely impassioned creature flung herself down on her knees on
the cold marble before him. And after that I really do not know, for
I could stand it no longer, and cleared off to refresh myself with a
little of old Umslopogaas’ society, leaving them to settle it their own
way, and a very long time they were about it.
</p><p>I found the old warrior leaning on Inkosi-kaas as usual, and surveying
the scene in the patch of moonlight with a grim smile of amusement.
</p><p>‘Ah, Macumazahn,’ he said, ‘I suppose it is because I am getting old,
but I don’t think that I shall ever learn to understand the ways of you
white people. Look there now, I pray thee, they are a pretty pair of
doves, but what is all the fuss about, Macumazahn? He wants a wife, and
she wants a husband, then why does he not pay his cows down {Endnote 17}
like a man and have done with it? It would save a deal of trouble, and
we should have had our night’s sleep. But there they go, talk, talk,
talk, and kiss, kiss, kiss, like mad things. Eugh!’
</p><p>Some three-quarters of an hour afterwards the ‘pair of doves’ came
strolling towards us, Curtis looking slightly silly, and Nyleptha
remarking calmly that the moonlight made very pretty effects on the
marble. Then, for she was in a most gracious mood, she took my hand and
said that I was ‘her Lord’s’ dear friend, and therefore most dear to
her--not a word for my own sake, you see. Next she lifted Umslopogaas’
axe, and examined it curiously, saying significantly as she did so that
he might soon have cause to use it in defence of her.
</p><p>After that she nodded prettily to us all, and casting a tender glance at
her lover, glided off into the darkness like a beautiful vision.
</p><p>When we got back to our quarters, which we did without accident, Curtis
asked me jocularly what I was thinking about.
</p><p>‘I am wondering,’ I answered, ‘on what principle it is arranged that
some people should find beautiful queens to fall in love with them,
while others find nobody at all, or worse than nobody; and I am also
wondering how many brave men’s lives this night’s work will cost.’ It
was rather nasty of me, perhaps, but somehow all the feelings do not
evaporate with age, and I could not help being a little jealous of my
old friend’s luck. Vanity, my sons; vanity of vanities!
</p><p>On the following morning, Good was informed of the happy occurrence,
and positively rippled with smiles that, originating somewhere about the
mouth, slowly travelled up his face like the rings in a duckpond, till
they flowed over the brim of his eyeglass and went where sweet smiles
go. The fact of the matter, however, was that not only was Good rejoiced
about the thing on its own merits but also for personal reasons. He
adored Sorais quite as earnestly as Sir Henry adored Nyleptha, and his
adoration had not altogether prospered. Indeed, it had seemed to him and
to me also that the dark Cleopatra-like queen favoured Curtis in her own
curious inscrutable way much more than Good. Therefore it was a
relief to him to learn that his unconscious rival was permanently and
satisfactorily attached in another direction. His face fell a little,
however, when he was told that the whole thing was to be kept as secret
as the dead, above all from Sorais for the present, inasmuch as the
political convulsion which would follow such an announcement at the
moment would be altogether too great to face and would very possibly, if
prematurely made, shake Nyleptha from her throne.
</p><p>That morning we again attended in the Throne Hall, and I could not help
smiling to myself when I compared the visit to our last, and reflecting
that, if walls could speak, they would have strange tales to tell.
</p><p>What actresses women are! There, high upon her golden throne, draped in
her blazoned ‘kaf’ or robe of state, sat the fair Nyleptha, and when Sir
Henry came in a little late, dressed in the full uniform of an officer
of her guard and humbly bent himself before her, she merely acknowledged
his salute with a careless nod and turned her head coldly aside. It was
a very large Court, for not only did the signing of the laws attract
many outside of those whose duty it was to attend, but also the rumour
that Nasta was going to publicly ask the hand of Nyleptha in marriage
had gone abroad, with the result that the great hall was crowded to its
utmost capacity. There were our friends the priests in force, headed by
Agon, who regarded us with a vindictive eye; and a most imposing band
they were, with their long white embroidered robes girt with a golden
chain from which hung the fish-like scales. There, too, were a number
of the lords, each with a band of brilliantly attired attendants, and
prominent among them was Nasta, stroking his black beard meditatively
and looking unusually pleasant. It was a splendid and impressive sight,
especially when the officer after having read out each law handed them
to the Queens to sign, whereon the trumpets blared out and the Queens’
guard grounded their spears with a crash in salute. This reading and
signing of the laws took a long time, but at length it came to an end,
the last one reciting that ‘whereas distinguished strangers, etc.’, and
proceeding to confer on the three of us the rank of ‘lords’, together
with certain military commands and large estates bestowed by the Queen.
When it was read the trumpets blared and the spears clashed down as
usual, but I saw some of the lords turn and whisper to each other, while
Nasta ground his teeth. They did not like the favour that was shown to
us, which under all the circumstances was not perhaps unnatural.
</p><p>Then there came a pause, and Nasta stepped forward and bowing humbly,
though with no humility in his eye, craved a boon at the hands of the
Queen Nyleptha.
</p><p>Nyleptha turned a little pale, but bowed graciously, and prayed the
‘well-beloved lord’ to speak on, whereon in a few straightforward
soldier-like words he asked her hand in marriage.
</p><p>Then, before she could find words to answer, the High Priest Agon took
up the tale, and in a speech of real eloquence and power pointed out the
many advantages of the proposed alliance; how it would consolidate the
kingdom, for Nasta’s dominions, of which he was virtually king, were to
Zu-Vendis much what Scotland used to be to England; how it would gratify
the wild mountaineers and be popular among the soldiery, for Nasta was
a famous general; how it would set her dynasty firmly on the throne, and
would gain the blessing and approval of the ‘Sun’, i.e. of the office
of the High Priest, and so on. Many of his arguments were undoubtedly
valid, and there was, looking at it from a political point of view,
everything to be said for the marriage. But unfortunately it is
difficult to play the game of politics with the persons of young and
lovely queens as though they were ivory effigies of themselves on a
chessboard. Nyleptha’s face, while Agon spouted away, was a perfect
study; she smiled indeed, but beneath the smile it set like a stone, and
her eyes began to flash ominously.
</p><p>At last he stopped, and she prepared herself to answer. Before she did
so, however, Sorais leant towards her and said in a voice sufficiently
loud for me to catch what she said, ‘Bethink thee well, my sister, ere
thou dost speak, for methinks that our thrones may hang upon thy words.’
</p><p>Nyleptha made no answer, and with a shrug and a smile Sorais leant back
again and listened.
</p><p>‘Of a truth a great honour has been done to me,’ she said, ‘that my poor
hand should not only have been asked in marriage, but that Agon here
should be so swift to pronounce the blessing of the Sun upon my union.
Methinks that in another minute he would have wed us fast ere the bride
had said her say. Nasta, I thank thee, and I will bethink me of thy
words, but now as yet I have no mind for marriage, that is a cup of
which none know the taste until they begin to drink it. Again I thank
thee, Nasta,’ and she made as though she would rise.
</p><p>The great lord’s face turned almost as black as his beard with fury, for
he knew that the words amounted to a final refusal of his suit.
</p><p>‘Thanks be to the Queen for her gracious words,’ he said, restraining
himself with difficulty and looking anything but grateful, ‘my heart
shall surely treasure them. And now I crave another boon, namely, the
royal leave to withdraw myself to my own poor cities in the north till
such time as the Queen shall say my suit nay or yea. Mayhap,’ he added,
with a sneer, ‘the Queen will be pleased to visit me there, and to bring
with her these stranger lords,’ and he scowled darkly towards us. ‘It is
but a poor country and a rough, but we are a hardy race of mountaineers,
and there shall be gathered thirty thousand swordsmen to shout a welcome
to her.’
</p><p>This speech, which was almost a declaration of rebellion, was received
in complete silence, but Nyleptha flushed up and answered it with
spirit.
</p><p>‘Oh, surely, Nasta, I will come, and the strange lords in my train, and
for every man of thy mountaineers who calls thee Prince, will I bring
two from the lowlands who call me Queen, and we will see which is the
staunchest breed. Till then farewell.’
</p><p>The trumpets blared out, the Queens rose, and the great assembly broke
up in murmuring confusion, and for myself I went home with a heavy heart
foreseeing civil war.
</p><p>After this there was quiet for a few weeks. Curtis and the Queen did
not often meet, and exercised the utmost caution not to allow the true
relation in which they stood to each other to leak out; but do what they
would, rumours as hard to trace as a buzzing fly in a dark room, and yet
quite as audible, began to hum round and round, and at last to settle on
her throne.
