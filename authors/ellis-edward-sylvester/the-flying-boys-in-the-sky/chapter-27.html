<p>Fortunately for Detective Pendar, the room which he occupied
at the hotel in Chesterton gave him a view of the immense forest
to the westward, over which Harvey Hamilton’s aeroplane was to
sail in its search for the headquarters of the men who had kidnapped
little Grace Hastings.</p>

<p>The keen-witted officer was right in his belief that he had diverted
suspicion from himself, but how long this favorable situation
would continue was problematical to the last degree. It seemed
impossible to make any effective move without betraying his real
character, as well as the business that had brought him to this
little country town in eastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Pendar easily learned one fact: neither Catozzi nor Caprioni
had occupied their room the previous night, nor did they show
up in the morning at the hotel. His theory was that the couple
had gone to the retreat in the woods, where they were likely to
stay until the ransom was paid for the child. The nearness of
the crisis made this reasoning plausible. It followed, therefore,
that at the time the detective was threading his way through the
gloomy labyrinths, they were doing the same, though over a different
course. They and he must have been near each other some time during
the night, but it was well he saw nothing of them. While it may
be difficult for one person to shadow another in certain circumstances,
an Apache warrior could not have trailed two vigilant kidnappers,
when they were alert against such a betrayal. The chances would
have been in favor of the detective himself being discovered and
all his schemes brought to naught.</p>

<p>In his exceeding caution, he continued to meet the two youths
as if they were strangers. When the time came for the starting
of the aeroplane, Pendar did not join the gaping crowd, but stayed
in his room on the upper floor, awaiting the call to use his field
glass. He heard the deafening roar of the motor, and a minute
later saw the odd looking structure climb from the open space
into the upper regions, and sail away to the westward. He saw
Bohunkus Johnson, the proudest youth in the whole country, seated
in front, with his hands upon the levers, behind him was Harvey
Hamilton with a sharp eye upon his movements.</p>

<p>Detective Pendar saw the aeroplane slant upward and travel at
a rapid pace. It was not necessary to employ his glasses, and
he watched the flight of the machine until it was nearly a half
mile away. Then he brought the instrument to his eyes, carefully
adjusted the focal distance and did not allow anything to escape
his searching vision. His first sensation was pleased surprise
over the excellence of the instrument. Every outline of the aeroplane
came out clear and sharp, and it seemed as if the two youths were
near enough for them to hear him if he spoke in a conversational
tone. He noticed that the negro continued to sit straight, as
if under the eyes of the crowd that had seen him leave Chesterton,
but Harvey Hamilton was leaning slightly forward, like one studying
every feature of the landscape sweeping under him.</p>

<p>The several days which the detective had spent in the neighborhood
had given him a good knowledge of its topography. He was quick,
therefore, to observe that the aeroplane was following a course
well to the north of its former one. This was prudent on the part
of the young aviator, for it gave him new view instead of the
old one which could serve him no further. He was approaching the
ridge over which he had sailed the previous day.</p>

<p>As the distance between the watcher and the aeroplane rapidly
increased, the detective almost held his breath. He was leaning
against the window sill in order to make his posture firm and
prevent the slightest wavering of the instrument. With one hand
he occasionally turned the little cogged wheel in front so as
to keep the focus right, and not allow the slightest detail to
escape him.</p>

<p>"He is as far to the west as Uncle Tommy’s house, but a half
mile north of that. This will show him all he needs to see in
that direction."</p>

<p>The watcher’s heart began to misgive him, for the machine was
fast receding, and though Harvey must be intently watching he
failed to make any sign. Even with the power of the field glass,
the great bird with its spreading wings began to flicker, and
Pendar was no longer able to clearly make out the forms of the
youths seated therein.</p>

<p>Suddenly the aeroplane flickered, became indistinct and the nearer
margin of the woods shut it from sight.</p>

<p>"Another failure!" muttered the watcher bitterly. "I may as well
get ready to hand over that fortune to as vile a gang as was ever
disgorged from the mountains of Sicily."</p>

<p>The upper sash was lowered that he might obtain an unobstructed
view of the soft tinted sky beyond. He took care to stand far
enough back in the room to be out of sight of any persons in the
street below. If either of the Italians had returned, he did not
mean they should learn how he was spending the minutes.</p>

<p>"I did not provide last night what young Hamilton should do if
he failed to make the discovery on his first, or rather second
voyage over the woods. It will be risky for him to come back,
but it may look as if he were on a little trial trip with his
negro and wished to return so as to take charge himself. If he
does that he will take a course to the south of his first trip,
and, by Jove! there he comes!"</p>

<p>It gave the detective an expectant thrill to see the ship of
the sky swim into his field of vision and head directly toward
him. Harvey Hamilton was following the plan which had presented
itself to the man. The first flight disclosed the home of Uncle
Tommy Waters the weather prophet; the second revealed nothing,
and the third, well to the south, must tell the tale. The crisis
was at hand.</p>

<p>The officer did not call his field glass into play. The aeroplane
was not only plainly visible, but was becoming more vivid every
minute. Its elevation was five or six hundred feet, and the watcher
breathlessly waited for the sudden shift that was to proclaim
the discovery. The machine skimmed through the air without deviation,
like a stone when it first leaves the sling, and then the abrupt
shift came.</p>

<p>But to Pendar’s consternation the aeroplane instead of shooting
upward dived toward the ground!</p>

<p>He snatched the glasses to his eyes. By their aid he saw Harvey
Hamilton leaning forward and gesticulating excitedly to Bohunkus
Johnson. The deafening racket of the engine rendered his voice
useless, but he managed to make his wishes known. In desperate
need he might reach the levers, and if anything had gone wrong
with the machine this would have been done. But it was quickly
evident that there had been a misunderstanding between the two.
Bohunkus must have thought Harvey meant him to approach the earth,
though it was impossible to land unless some open space presented
itself. The dipping of the forward rudder brought the biplane
half way down before the controller comprehended what was expected
of him. Then he pointed the horizontal plane upward at so great
an angle that the ascent became startlingly rapid.</p>

<p>Even in the extremity of anxiety, Detective Pendar could not
repress a smile at the sight which the glass revealed. The head
of Bunk kept flitting back and forth, in his efforts to handle
the machine and to learn what Harvey was trying to tell him. Pendar
saw the young aviator shake his fist angrily, and once he seemed
on the point of cuffing the heavy-witted youth for his stupidity.
For a minute or two the aeroplane wavered and swayed to that degree
that it seemed on the point of capsizing, but Bohunkus gradually
regained control, and began his manœuvers to land in the open
space from which he had ascended. He made a mess of it, the wheels
striking the ground so hard that both the boys came within a hair
of pitching out. Then the biplane banged over the road, coming
to a halt barely in time to escape a disastrous collision with
a telegraph pole.</p>

<p>"The next time you want to try your hand," said the angry Harvey,
"I’ll put you in charge of a clam wagon."</p>

<p>Bohunkus Johnson and Harvey Hamilton having been playmates from
young childhood, had indulged in the usual number of "spats" natural
to such a relation. They were fond of each other and the colored
youth as a rule accepted the criticisms of his friend with good
nature; but in the present instance the reproof given him was
made in the presence of fully a score of men and boys and was
heard by all of them. Several grinned, and had not nature made
it impossible, Bunk would have flushed with resentment. As it
was, he could not accept the slur with meekness.</p>

<p>"I done as well as yo’ could yo’self. Yo’ told me of I seed a
cabin I was to shoot down and knock de chimbly off, and den when
I started to do so, yo’ let out a howl dat nearly knocked my cap
off. De next time yo’ can ’tend to things yo’self."</p>

<p>"You may be mighty sure I shall; the wonder is that you didn’t
smash this machine worse than the other one."</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t keer if I did," replied Bunk, stepping from his seat
and striding off. He paused long enough to call back:</p>

<p>"I’m done trabeling wid yo’; I like to hab folks ’preciate what’s
done for ’em, which is what yo’ never did."</p>

<p>"The best thing you can do, Bunk, is to sail for Africa and make
a visit to Chief Foozleum."</p>

<p>Harvey laughed when he made this remark, for he never could feel
angry for more than a few minutes with the faithful fellow, and
he knew his resentment would soon cool. It did not occur to him
that the colored youth’s grievance was due to the tantalizing
enjoyment of the auditors. Had they been elsewhere, he would have
brushed the criticism aside like so much thistle down, but he
could not stand the ridicule of strangers.</p>

<p>"Dat’s what I’ll do," replied Bunk in response to the absurd
counsel of the other.</p>

<p>"All right; bring me back an elephant."</p>

<p>Bunk had learned that in a verbal duel with Harvey he was always
sure to get the worst of it, and he did not venture any reply
to the last remark. With an angry sniff he stalked to the porch,
dropped into one of the chairs there, crossed his legs and scowlingly
watched the actions of his old friend.</p>

<p>Little did Harvey Hamilton dream what the result would be of
this brief and somewhat hot exchange of words.</p>

<p>Convinced that the angry fellow would speedily regain his natural
good humor, Harvey gave him no further thought. He made a careful
examination of his aeroplane, and was relieved to find, so far
as he could discover, that it had suffered no harm and was as
good as ever.</p>

<p>He was anxious now to meet Detective Pendar, for he had important
news for him, but the man was nowhere in sight nor could the youth
tell where to look for him. </p>
