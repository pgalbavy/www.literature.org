<p>On a foggy afternoon, toward midwinter, John Estridge strolled
into the new Overseas Club, which, still being in process of incubation,
occupied temporary quarters on Madison Avenue.</p>

<p>Officers fresh from abroad and still in uniform predominated;
tunics were gay with service and wound chevrons, citation cords,
stars, crosses, strips of striped ribbon.</p>

<p>There was every sort of head-gear to be seen there, too, from
the jaunty overseas <em>bonnet de police</em>, piped in various
colours, to the corded campaign hat and leather-visored barrack-cap.</p>

<p>Few cavalry officers were in evidence, but there were plenty
of spurs glittering everywhere&mdash;to keep their owners' heels from
slipping off the desks, as the pleasantry of the moment had it.</p>

<p>Estridge went directly to a telephone booth, and presently got
his connection.</p>

<p>"It's John Estridge, as usual," he said in a bantering tone.
"How are you, Ilse?"</p>

<p>"John! I'm so glad you called me! Thank you so much for the roses!
They're exquisite!&mdash;matchless!&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Not at all!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"If you think they're matchless, just hold one up beside your
cheek and take a slant at your mirror."</p>

<p>"I thought you were not going to say such things to me!"</p>

<p>"I thought I wasn't."</p>

<p>"Are you alone?" She laughed happily. "Where are you, Jack?"</p>

<p>"At the Overseas Club. I stopped on my way from the hospital."</p>

<p>"<em>Y&mdash;</em>es."</p>

<p>A considerable pause, and then Ilse laughed again&#11834;a confused,
happy laugh.</p>

<p>"Did you think you'd&mdash;come over?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Shall I?"</p>

<p>"What do <em>you</em> think about it, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said in a humourous voice, "you're afraid of
that tendency which you say I'm beginning to exhibit."</p>

<p>"The tendency to drift?"</p>

<p>"Yes;&mdash;toward those perilous rocks you warned me of."</p>

<p>"They <em>are</em> perilous!" she insisted.</p>

<p>"You ought to know," he rejoined; "you're sitting on top of 'em
like a bally Lorelei!"</p>

<p>"If that's your opinion, hadn't you better steer for the open
sea, John?"</p>

<p>"Certainly I'd better. But you look so sweet up there, with your
classical golden hair, that I think I'll risk the rocks."</p>

<p>"Please don't! There's a deadly whirlpool under them. I'm looking
down at it now."</p>

<p>"What do you see at the bottom, Ilse? Human bones?"</p>

<p>"I can't see the bottom. It's all surface, like a shining mirror."</p>

<p>"I'll come over and take a look at it with you."</p>

<p>"I think you'll only see our own faces reflected.... I think
you'd better not come."</p>

<p>"I'll be there in about half an hour," he said gaily.</p>

<p>He sauntered out and on into the body of the club, exchanging
with friends a few words here, a smiling handclasp there; and
presently he seated himself near a window.</p>

<p>For a while he rested his chin on his clenched hand, staring
into space, until a waiter arrived with his order.</p>

<p>He signed the check, drained his glass, and leaned forward again
with both elbows on his knees, twirling his silver-headed stick
between nervous hands.</p>

<p>"After all," he said under his breath, "it's too late, now....
I'm going to see this thing through."</p>

</div>
<p>As he rose to go he caught sight of Jim Shotwell, seated alone
by another window and attempting to read an evening paper by the
foggy light from outside. He walked over to him, fastening his
overcoat on the way. Jim laid aside his paper and gave him a dull
glance.</p>

<p>"How are things with you?" inquired Estridge, carelessly.</p>

<p>"All right. Are you walking up town?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Jim's sombre eyes rested on the discarded paper, but he did not
pick it up. "It's rotten weather," he said listlessly.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Palla lately?" inquired Estridge, looking down
at him with a certain curiosity.</p>

<p>"No, not lately."</p>

<p>"She's a very busy girl, I hear."</p>

<p>"So I hear."</p>

<p>Estridge seated himself on the arm of a leather chair and began
to pull on his gloves. He said:</p>

<p>"I understand Palla is doing Red Cross and canteen work, besides
organising her celebrated club;&mdash;what is it she calls it? &mdash;Combat
Club No. 1?"</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>"And you haven't seen her lately?"</p>

<p>Shotwell glanced at the fog and shrugged his shoulders: "She's
rather busy&mdash;as you say. No, I haven't seen her. Besides, I'm
rather out of my element among the people one runs into at her
house. So I simply don't go any more."</p>

<p>"Palla's parties are always amusing," ventured Estridge.</p>

<p>"Very," said the other, "but her guests keep you guessing."</p>

<p>Estridge smiled: "Because they don't conform to the established
scheme of things?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. The scheme of things, as it is, suits me."</p>

<p>"But it's interesting to hear other people's views."</p>

<p>"I'm fed up on queer views&mdash;and on queer people," said Jim, with
sudden and irritable emphasis. "Why, hang it all, Jack, when a
fellow goes out among apparently well bred, decent people he takes
it for granted that ordinary, matter of course social conventions
prevail. But nobody can guess what notions are seething in the
bean of any girl you talk to at Palla's house!"</p>

<p>Estridge laughed: "What do you care, Jim?"</p>

<p>"Well, I wouldn't care if they all didn't seem so exactly like
one's own sort. Why, to look at them, talk to them, you'd never
suppose them queer! The young girl you take in to dinner usually
looks as though butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. And the chances
are that she's all for socialism, self-determination, trial marriages
and free love!</p>

<p>"Hell's bells! I'm no prude. I like to overstep conventions,
too. But this wholesale wrecking of the social structure would
be ruinous for a girl like Palla."</p>

<p>"But Palla doesn't believe in free love."</p>

<p>"She hears it talked about by cracked illuminati."</p>

<p>"Rain on a duck's back, Jim!"</p>

<p>"Rain drowns young ducks."</p>

<p>"You mean all this spouting will end in a deluge?"</p>

<p>"I do. And then look for dead ducks."</p>

<p>"You're not very respectful toward modernism," remarked Estridge,
smiling.</p>

<p>Then Jim broke loose:</p>

<p>"Modernism? You yourself said that all these crazy social notions&mdash;crazy
notions in art, literature, music&mdash;arise from some sort of physical
degeneration, or from the perversion or checking of normal physical
functions."</p>

<p>"Usually they do&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Well," continued Shotwell, "it's mostly due to perversion, in
my opinion. Women have had too much of a hell of a run for their
money during this war. They've broken down all the fences and
they're loose and running all over the world.</p>

<p>"If they'd only kept their fool heads! But no. Every germ in
the wind lodged in their silly brains! Biff. They want sex equality
and a pair of riding breeches! Bang! They kick over the cradle
and wreck the pantry.</p>

<p>"Wifehood? Played out! Motherhood? In the discards! Domestic
partnership?&mdash;each sex to its own sphere? Ha-ha! That was all
very well yesterday. But woman as a human incubator and brooder
is an obsolete machine. Why the devil should free and untramelled
womanhood hatch out young?</p>

<p>"If they choose to, casually, all right. But it's purely a matter
for self-determination. If a girl cares to take off her Sam Brown
belt and her puttees long enough to nurse a baby, it's a matter
that concerns her, not humanity at large. Because the social revolution
has settled all such details as personal independence and the
same standard for both sexes. So, <em>a bas</em> Madame Grundy!
<em>A la lanterne</em> with the old régime! No&mdash;hang it all, I'm
through!"</p>

<p>"Don't you like Palla any more?" inquired Estridge, still laughing.</p>

<p>Jim gave him a singular look: "Yes.... Do you like Ilse Westgard?"</p>

<p>Estridge said coolly: "I am accepting her as she is. I like her
that much."</p>

<p>"Oh. Is that very much?" sneered the other.</p>

<p>"Enough to marry her if she'd have me," replied Estridge pleasantly.</p>

<p>"And she won't do that, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Not so far."</p>

<p>Jim eyed him sullenly: "Well, I don't accept Palla as she is&mdash;or
thinks she is."</p>

<p>"She's sincere."</p>

<p>"I understand that. But no girl can get away with such notions.
Where is it all going to land her? What will she be?"</p>

<p>Estridge quoted: "'It hath not yet appeared what we shall be.'"</p>

<p>Shotwell rose impatiently, and picked up his overcoat: "All I
know is that when two healthy people care for each other it's
their business&mdash;their <em>business</em>, I repeat&mdash;to get together
legally and do the decent thing by the human race."</p>

<p>"Breed?"</p>

<p>"Certainly! Breed legally the finest, healthiest, best of specimens;&mdash;and
as many as they can feed and clothe! For if they don't&mdash;if we
don't &mdash;I mean our own sort&mdash;the land will be crawling with
the robust get of all these millions of foreigners, who already
have nearly submerged us in America; and whose spawn will, one
day, smother us to death.</p>

<p>"Hang it all, aren't they breeding like vermin now? All yellow
dogs do&mdash;all the unfit produce big litters. That's the only thing
they ever do&mdash;accumulate progeny.</p>

<p>"And what are we doing?&mdash;our sort, I mean? I'll tell you! Our
sisters are having such a good time that they won't marry, if
they can avoid it, until they're too mature to get the best results
in children. Our wives, if they condescend to have any offspring
at all, limit the output to one. Because more than one <em>might</em>
damage their beauty. Hell! If the educated classes are going to
practise race suicide and the Bolsheviki are going to breed like
lice, you can figure out the answer for yourself."</p>

<p>They walked to the foggy street together. Shotwell said bitterly:</p>

<p>"I do care for Palla. I like Ilse. All the women one encounters
at Palla's parties are gay, accomplished, clever, piquant. The
men also are more or less amusing. The conversation is never dull.
Everybody seems to be well bred, sincere, friendly and agreeable.
But there's something lacking. One feels it even before one is
enlightened concerning the ultra-modernism of these admittedly
interesting people. And I'll tell you what it is. Actually, deep
in their souls, they don't believe in themselves.</p>

<p>"Take Palla. She says there is no God&mdash;no divinity except in
herself. And I tell you she may think she believes it, but she
doesn't.</p>

<p>"And her school-girl creed &mdash;Love and Service! Fine. Only
there's a prior law&mdash;self-preservation; and another&mdash;race preservation!
By God, how are you going to love and serve if girls stop having
babies?</p>

<p>"And as for this silly condemnation of the marriage ceremony,
merely because some sanctified Uncle Foozle once inserted the
word 'obey' in it&mdash;just because, under the marriage laws, tyranny
and cruelty have been practised&mdash;what callow rot!</p>

<p>"Laws can be changed; divorce made simple and non-scandalous
as it should be; all rights safeguarded for the woman; and still
have something legal and recognised by one of those necessary
conventions which make civilisation possible.</p>

<p>"But this irresponsible idea of procedure through mere inclination&mdash;this
sauntering through life under no law to safeguard and govern,
except the law of personal preference&mdash;that's anarchy! That code
spells demoralisation, degeneracy and disaster!... And the whole
damned thing to begin again&mdash;a slow development of the human race,
once more, out of the chaos of utter barbarism."</p>

<p>Estridge, standing there on the sidewalk in the fog, smiled:</p>

<p>"You're very eloquent, Jim. Why don't you say all this to Palla?"</p>

<p>"I did. I told her, too, that the root of the whole thing was
selfishness. And it is. It's a refusal to play the game according
to rule. There are only two sexes and one of 'em is fashioned
to bear young, and the other is fashioned to hustle for mother
and kid. You can't alter that, whether it's fair or not. It's
the game as we found it. The rules were already provided for playing
it. The legal father and mother are supposed to look out for their
own legal progeny. And any alteration of this rule, with a view
to irresponsible mating and turning the offspring over to the
community to take care of, would create an unhuman race, unconscious
of the highest form of love&mdash;the love for parents.</p>

<p>"A fine lot we'd be as an incubated race!"</p>

<p>Estridge laughed: "I've got to go," he said, "And, if you care
for Palla as you say you do, you oughtn't to leave her entirely
alone with her circle of modernist friends. Stick around! It may
make you mad, but if she likes you, at least she won't commit
an indiscretion with anybody else."</p>

<p>"I wish I could find my own sort as amusing," said Jim, naïvely.
"I've been going about recently&mdash;dances, dinners, theatres&mdash;but
I can't seem to keep my mind off Palla."</p>

<p>Estridge said: "If you'd give your sense of humour half a chance
you'd be all right. You take yourself too solemnly. You let Palla
scare you. That's not the way. The thing to do is to have a jolly
time with her, with them all. Accept her as she thinks she is.
There's no damage done yet. Time enough to throw fits if she takes
the bit and bolts&#11834;"</p>

<p>He extended his hand, cordially but impatiently:</p>

<p>"You remember I once said that girl ought to be married and have
children? If you do the marrying part she's likely to do the rest
very handsomely. And it will be the making of her."</p>

<p>Jim held on to his hand:</p>

<p>"Tell me what to do, Jack. She isn't in love with me. And she
wouldn't submit to a legal ceremony if she were. You invoke my
sense of humour. I'm willing to give it an airing, only I can't
see anything funny in this business."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> funny! Palla's funny, but doesn't know it. You're
funny! They're all funny&mdash;unintentionally. But their motives are
tragically immaculate. So stick around and have a good time with
Palla until there's really something to scare you."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"How the devil do I know? It's up to you, of course, what you
do about it."</p>

<p>He laughed and strode away through the fog.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>It had seemed to Jim a long time since he had seen Palla. It
wasn't very long. And in all that interminable time he had not
once called her up on the telephone&mdash;had not even written her
a single line. Nor had she written to him.</p>

<p>He had gone about his social business in his own circle, much
to his mother's content. He had seen quite a good deal of Elorn
Sharrow; was comfortably back on the old, agreeable footing; tried
desperately to enjoy it; pretended that he did.</p>

<p>But the days were long in the office; the evenings longer, wherever
he happened to be; and the nights, alas! were becoming interminable,
now, because he slept badly, and the grey winter daylight found
him unrefreshed.</p>

<p>Which, recently, had given him a slightly battered appearance,
commented on jestingly by young rakes and old sports at the Patroon's
Club, and also observed by his mother with gentle concern.</p>

<p>"Don't overdo it, Jim," she cautioned him, meaning dances that
ended with breakfasts and that sort of thing. But her real concern
was vaguer than that&mdash;deeper, perhaps. And sometimes she remembered
the girl in black.</p>

<p>Lately, however, that anxiety had been almost entirely allayed.
And her comparative peace of mind had come about in an unexpected
manner.</p>

<p>For, one morning, entering the local Red Cross quarters, where
for several hours she was accustomed to sew, she encountered Mrs.
Speedwell and her lively daughter, Connie&mdash;her gossiping informants
concerning her son's appearance at Delmonico's with the mysterious
girl in black.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you suppose, Helen?" said Mrs. Speedwell, mischievously.
"Jim's pretty mystery in black is here!"</p>

<p>"Here?" repeated Mrs. Shotwell, flushing and looking around her
at the rows of prophylactic ladies, all sewing madly side by side.</p>

<p>"Yes, and she's prettier even than I thought her in Delmonico's,"
remarked Connie. "Her name is Palla Dumont, and she's a friend
of Leila Vance."</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>During the morning, Mrs. Shotwell found it convenient to speak
to Leila Vance; and they exchanged a pleasant word or two&mdash;merely
the amiable civilities of two women who recognise each other socially
as well as personally.</p>

<p>And it happened in that way, a few days later, that Helen Shotwell
met this pretty friend of Leila Vance &mdash;Palla Dumont&mdash;the
girl in black.</p>

<p>And Palla had looked up from her work with her engaging smile,
saying: "I know your son, Mrs. Shotwell. Is he quite well? I haven't
seen him for such a long time."</p>

<p>And instantly the invisible antennæ of these two women became
busy exploring, probing, searching, and recognising in each other
all that remains forever incomprehensible to man.</p>

<p>For Palla somehow understood that Jim had never spoken of her
to his mother; and yet that his mother had heard of her friendship
with her son.</p>

<p>And Helen knew that Palla was quietly aware of this, and that
the girl's equanimity remained undisturbed.</p>

<p>Only people quite sure of themselves preserved serenity under
the merciless exploration of the invisible feminine antennæ. And
it was evident that the girl in black had nothing to conceal from
her in regard to her only son&mdash;whatever that same son might think
he ought to make an effort to conceal from his mother.</p>

<p>To herself Helen thought: "Jim has had his wings singed, and
has fled the candle."</p>

<p>To Palla she said: "Mrs. Vance tells me such interesting stories
of your experiences in Russia. Really, it's like a charming romance&mdash;your
friendship for the poor little Grand Duchess."</p>

<p>"A tragic one," said Palla in a voice so even that Helen presently
lifted her eyes from her sewing to read in her expression something
more than the mere words that this young girl had uttered. And
saw a still, pale face, sensitive and very lovely; and the needle
flying over a bandage no whiter than the hand that held it.</p>

<p>"It was a great shock to you&mdash;her death," said Helen.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And&mdash;you were there at the time! How dreadful!"</p>

<p>Palla lifted her brown eyes: "I can't talk about it yet," she
said so simply that Helen's sixth sense, always alert for information
from the busy, invisible antennæ, suddenly became convinced that
there were no more hidden depths to explore&mdash;no motives to suspect,
no pretense to expose.</p>

<p>Day after day she chose to seat herself between Palla and Leila
Vance; and the girl began to fascinate her.</p>

<p>There was no effort to please on Palla's part, other than that
natural one born of sweet-tempered consideration for everybody.
There seemed to be no pretence, no pose.</p>

<p>Such untroubled frankness, such unconscious candour were rather
difficult to believe in, yet Helen was now convinced that in Palla
these phenomena were quite genuine. And she began to understand
more clearly, as the week wore on, why her son might have had
a hard time of it with Palla Dumont before he returned to more
familiar pastures, where camouflage and not candour was the rule
in the gay and endless game of blind-man's buff.</p>

<p>"This girl," thought Helen Shotwell to herself, "could easily
have taken Jim away from Elorn Sharrow had she chosen to do so.
There is no doubt about her charm and her goodness. She certainly
is a most unusual girl."</p>

<p>But she did not say this to her only son. She did not even tell
him that she had met his girl in black. And Palla had not informed
him; she knew that; because the girl herself had told her that
she had not seen Jim for "a long, long time." It really was not
nearly as long as Palla seemed to consider it.</p>

<p>Helen lunched with Leila Vance one day. The former spoke pleasantly
of Palla.</p>

<p>"She's such a darling," said Mrs. Vance, "but the child worries
me."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, she's absorbed some ultra-modern Russian notions&mdash;socialistic
ones&mdash;rather shockingly radical. Can you imagine it in a girl
who began her novitiate as a Carmelite nun?"</p>

<p>Helen said: "She does not seem to have a tendency toward extremes."</p>

<p>"She has. That awful affair in Russia seemed to shock her from
one extreme to another. It's a long way from the cloister to the
radical rostrum."</p>

<p>"She spoke of this new Combat Club."</p>

<p>"She organised it," said Leila. "They have a hall where they
invite public discussion of social questions three nights a week.
The other three nights, a rival and very red club rents the hall
and howls for anarchy and blood."</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange?" said Helen. "One can not imagine such a girl
devoting herself to radical propaganda."</p>

<p>"Too radical," said Leila. "I'm keeping an uneasy eye on that
very wilful and wrong-headed child. Why, my dear, she has the
most fastidious, the sweetest, the most chaste mind, and yet the
things she calmly discusses would make your hair curl."</p>

<p>"For example?" inquired Helen, astonished.</p>

<p>"Well, for example, they've all concluded that it's time to strip
poor old civilisation of her tinsel customs, thread-worn conventions,
polite legends, and pleasant falsehoods.</p>

<p>"All laws are silly. Everybody is to do as they please, conforming
only to the universal law of Love and Service. Do you see where
that would lead some of those pretty hot-heads?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, I should think so!"</p>

<p>"Of course. But they can't seem to understand that the unscrupulous
are certain to exploit them&mdash;that the most honest motives&mdash;the
purest&mdash;invite that certain disaster consequent on social irregularities.</p>

<p>"Palla, so far, is all hot-headed enthusiast&mdash;hot-hearted theorist.
But I remember that she did take the white veil once. And, as
I tell you, I shall try to keep her within range of my uneasy
vision. Because," she added, "she's really a perfect darling."</p>

<p>"She is a most attractive girl," said Helen slowly; "but I think
she'd be more attractive still if she were happily married."</p>

<p>"And had children."</p>

<p>Their eyes met, unsmilingly, yet in silent accord.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>Their respective cars awaited them at the Ritz and took them
in different directions. But all the afternoon Helen Shotwell's
mind was occupied with what she now knew of Palla Dumont. And
she realised that she wished the girl were back in Russia in spite
of all her charm and fascination&mdash;yes, on account of it.</p>

<p>Because this lovely, burning asteroid might easily cross the
narrow orbit through which her own social world spun peacefully
in its orderly progress amid that metropolitan galaxy called Society.</p>

<p>Leila Vance was part of that galaxy. So was her own and only
son. Wandering meteors that burnt so prettily might yet do damage.</p>

<p>For Helen, having known this girl, found it not any too easy
to believe that her son could have relinquished her completely
in so disturbingly brief a time.</p>

<p>Had she been a young man she knew that she would not have done
so. And, knowing it, she was troubled.</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">

</p>
</div>
<p>Meanwhile, her only son was troubled, too, as he walked slowly
homeward through the winter fog.</p>

<p>And by the time he was climbing his front steps he had concluded
to accept this girl as she was&mdash;or thought she was&mdash;to pull no
more long faces or sour faces, but to go back to her, resolutely
determined to enjoy her friendship and her friends too; and give
his long incarcerated sense of humour an airing, even if he suffered
acutely while it revelled.</p>
