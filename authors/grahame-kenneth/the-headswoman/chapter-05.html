<p>When, an hour or two later, an invitation arrived--courteously worded
but significantly backed by an escort of half-a-dozen tall archers--for
both Jeanne and the Mayor to attend at the Ch창teau without delay, Jeanne
for her part received it with neither surprise nor reluctance. She had
felt it especially hard that the only two interviews fate had granted
her with the one man who had made some impression on her heart should be
hampered, the one by considerations of propriety, the other by the
conflicting claims of her profession and its duties. On this
occasion, now, she would have an excellent chaperon in the Mayor; and,
business being over for the day, they could meet and unbend on a common
social footing. The Mayor was not at all surprised either, considering
what had gone before; but he was exceedingly terrified, and sought some
consolation from Jeanne as they proceeded together to the Ch창teau. That
young lady's remarks, however, could hardly be called exactly
comforting.
</p><p>    [Illustration: An invitation arrived, backed by an escort of

</p><p>"I always thought you'd put your foot in it some day, Mayor," she said.
"You are so hopelessly wanting in system and method. Really, under the
present happy-go-lucky police arrangements, I never know whom I may not
be called upon to execute. Between you and my cousin Enguerrand, life is
hardly safe in this town. And the worst of it is, that we other
officials on the staff have to share in the discredit."
</p><p>"What do you think they'll do to me, Jeanne?" whimpered the Mayor,
perspiring freely.
</p><p>"Can't say, I'm sure," pursued the candid Jeanne. "Of course, if it's
anything in the <u>rack</u> line of business, I shall have to superintend the
arrangements, and then you can feel sure you're in capable hands. But
probably they'll only fine you pretty smartly, give you a month or two
in the dungeons, and dismiss you from your post; and you will hardly
grudge any slight personal inconvenience resulting from an arrangement
so much to the advantage of the town."
</p><p>This was hardly reassuring, but the Mayor's official reprimand of the
previous day still rankled in this unforgiving young person's mind.
</p><p>On their reaching the Ch창teau the Mayor was conducted aside, to be dealt
with by Thibault; and from the sounds of agonised protestation and
lament which shortly reached Jeanne's ears, it was evident that he was
having a <u>mauvais quart d'heure</u>. The young lady was shown respectfully
into a chamber apart, where she had hardly had time to admire
sufficiently the good taste of the furniture and the magnificence of the
tapestry with which the walls were hung, when the Seigneur entered and
welcomed her with a cordial grace that put her entirely at her ease.
</p><p>"Your punctuality puts me to shame, fair mistress," he said,
"considering how unwarrantably I kept you waiting this morning, and how
I tested your patience by my ignorance and awkwardness."
</p><p>He had changed his dress, and the lace round his neck was even richer
than before. Jeanne had always considered one of the chief marks of a
well-bred man to be a fine disregard for the amount of his washing-bill;
and then with what good taste he referred to recent events--putting
himself in the wrong, as a gentleman should!
</p><p>"Indeed, my lord," she replied modestly, "I was only too anxious to hear
from your own lips that you bore me no ill-will for the part forced on
me by circumstances in our recent interview. Your lordship has
sufficient critical good sense, I feel sure, to distinguish between the
woman and the official."
</p><p>"True, Jeanne," he replied, drawing nearer; "and while I shrink from
expressing, in their fulness, all the feelings that the woman inspires
in me, I have no hesitation--for I know it will give you pleasure--in
acquainting you with the entire artistic satisfaction with which I
watched you at your task!"
</p><p>"But, indeed," said Jeanne, "you did not see me at my best. In fact, I
can't help wishing--it's ridiculous, I know, because the thing is hardly
practicable--but if I could only have carried my performance quite
through, and put the last finishing touches to it, you would not have
been judging me now by the mere 'blocking-in' of what promised to be a
masterpiece!"
</p><p>"Yes, I wish it could have been arranged somehow," said the Seigneur,
reflectively; "but perhaps it's better as it is. I am content to let the
artist remain for the present on trust, if I may only take over, fully
paid up, the woman I adore!"
</p><p>Jeanne felt strangely weak. The official seemed oozing out at her
fingers and toes, while the woman's heart beat even more distressingly.
</p><p>"I have one little question to ask," he murmured (his arm was about her
now).
</p><p>"Do I understand that you still claim your bonus?"
</p><p>Jeanne felt like water in his strong embrace; but she nerved herself to
answer, faintly but firmly, "Yes!"
</p><p>"Then so do I," he replied, as his lips met hers.
</p><hr/>
<p>Executions continued to occur in St. Radegonde; the Radegundians being
conservative and very human. But much of the innocent enjoyment that
formerly attended them departed after the fair Ch창telaine had ceased to
officiate. Enguerrand, on succeeding to the post, wedded Clairette, she
being (he was heard to say) a more suitable match in mind and temper
than others of whom he would name no names. Rumour had it, that he found
his match and something over; while as for temper--and mind (which she
gave him in bits). But the domestic trials of high-placed officials have
a right to be held sacred. The profession, in spite of his best
endeavours, languished nevertheless. Some said that the scaffold lacked
its old attraction for criminals of spirit; others, more unkindly, that
the headsman was the innocent cause, and that Enguerrand was less fatal
in his new sphere than formerly, when practising in the criminal court
as advocate for the defence.
