<p>It was true, as Mr. Crow had said, that he had a bad memory. By the time
he reached home he had forgotten almost everything the famous doctor,
Aunt Polly Woodchuck, had said to him. About all Mr. Crow could recall of
their talk was that Aunt Polly had told him his swollen foot was caused
by gout; and that she had given him samples of such food as he might eat,
and also such as he mightn't.
</p>
<p>He had put the two kinds in different pockets, just as Aunt Polly had
suggested. And all he had to do when he was hungry was to look into his
pockets and see what food he might safely choose for his meal. Well, Mr.
Crow was hungry as a bear by the time he reached his house. And the
first thing he did was to feel in his left-hand pocket. He drew forth a
kernel of corn.
</p><p>"Good!" he cried. "That's exactly what I'd like for my dinner. And if
Farmer Green hadn't tarred his corn before planting it I know exactly
where I'd go." Then he thought deeply for a few minutes. "I'll go over
to the corn-crib and see if I can't find some corn on the ground!" he
exclaimed a little later. While he was thinking he ate the sample of
corn, without once noticing what he did.
</p><p>So Mr. Crow flew swiftly to the farm-yard. It happened that there was
nobody about. And, luckily, Mr. Crow found enough corn scattered near the
door of the corn-crib to furnish him with a good dinner.
</p><p>The next morning, as soon as it began to grow light (for Mr. Crow was an
early riser), he felt in his left-hand pocket once more. And he pulled
out an elderberry.
</p><p>"That won't do!" he said. "It's too early in the season for
elderberries." But he ate the sample--though he found it rather dry,
for it was a last year's berry. And then he fished a bird's egg out
of the same pocket. "My favorite breakfast!" he remarked. He ate the
egg. And at once he started out to hunt for more. Some people say that
he robbed the nests of several small birds before he had breakfast
enough.
</p><p>Mr. Crow then proceeded to pass the morning very pleasantly, by making
calls on his friends. He enjoyed their surprise at seeing his bandaged
foot.
</p><p>"I've the worst case of gout Aunt Polly Woodchuck has ever seen," he told
every one with an air of pride.
</p><p>When lunch time came, it found Mr. Crow with a hearty appetite. And once
more he felt in his left-hand pocket to see what he might have for his
meal.
</p><p>He pulled out a squirming field-mouse. Mr. Crow was about to eat him; but
the mouse slipped away and hid in a hollow stump. So Mr. Crow lost him.
Then he went soaring off across the pasture. And when he came home again
he didn't seem hungry at all. Whatever he may have found to eat, it
seemed to satisfy him.
</p><p>By this time Mr. Crow had quite recovered from the fear that had seized
him when he first discovered his swollen foot. And before he went to
sleep that night he thought he would take the bandage off his foot and
look at it. He had some trouble in removing the bandage. And when he
had succeeded in unwinding it he could hardly believe his eyes. His foot
was its natural size again!
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow looked at the bandage. And he saw, clinging to it, a mass of
caked mud. He could not understand that.
</p><p>"Anyhow, I'm cured," he said sadly. He was disappointed, because there
were still a good many of his friends to whom he had not yet shown his
bandaged foot. "I don't consider that Aunt Polly Woodchuck is as good a
doctor as people say," Mr. Crow grumbled. "Here she's gone and cured my
foot almost a week before I wanted her to!"
</p><p>And the next day he went over to see the old lady and complain about her
mistake.
</p><p>"What have you been eating?" she asked Mr. Crow.
</p><p>He told her.
</p><p>"Ah!" said Aunt Polly. "It's your mistake--and not mine. You ate what
was in your <u>left-hand pocket</u>, instead of what was in the right-hand
one. If you had followed my instructions everything would have been all
right."
</p><p>Old Mr. Crow felt very much ashamed. There was nothing he could say. So
he slunk away and moped for three days.
</p><p>Though he did not know it, the trouble with his foot was simply this: He
had daubed so much tar on his foot, in Farmer Green's cornfield, that the
soft earth had stuck to it in a big ball.
</p><p>Mr. Crow recovered his spirits at last. And neither he nor Aunt Polly
Woodchuck ever discovered that he never had gout at all. He forgave her,
at last, for having cured his foot too quickly, for the affair gave him
something to talk about for a long time afterward. He never tired of
telling his friends about the trouble he had had.
</p><p>But many of the feathered folk in Pleasant Valley grew very weary of the
tale before they heard the last of it.
