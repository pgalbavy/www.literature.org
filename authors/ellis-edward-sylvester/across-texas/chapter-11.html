<p><em>THE </em>elder Texan turned to the boys and said:</p>

<p>"I must ask you to excuse Baker and me for a few minutes, while
we discuss a little private business."</p>

<p>It was a singular request, but Nick and Herbert nodded their
heads. Striking their ponies into a quick gallop, the cowboys
rode a hundred yards or so in advance, before bringing their animals
down to a walk. The gait of the youths was the same.</p>

<p>The remark made by Strubell concerning Rickard, caused Herbert
to ask what it meant. Nick told him the story, adding:</p>

<p>"They are talking now about him and the others: look at them!"</p>

<p>The Texans were certainly discussing some subject with great
earnestness. Inasmuch as they kept glancing to the eastward, gesticulating
and often pointing in that direction, there was little doubt that
Nick was right in his surmise as to the theme of their conversation.</p>

<p>"I wonder what it can be," said Herbert, after watching the couple,
who modulated their voices so that not a word could be recognized;
"it seems strange that they should treat the horse thief as a
friend, when they know him to be an enemy."</p>

<p>"Well, I have been trying to figure it out; I supposed they would
make it clear to me, but though I heard them speak about it to
each other this morning, they took care not to give me a word
in the way of explanation. I shall not ask them, though I was
never more curious to learn anything in all my life."</p>

<p>"It can’t be that Strubell and Lattin are on friendly terms with
Rickard?" suggested Herbert.</p>

<p>"I might think so, after what we have just seen, though it seems
cruel to suspect them of anything like that. Mr. Lord has known
them for years, and says two more honest men never lived."</p>

<p>"You are brighter than I am, Nick; what is <em>your</em> theory?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is clear that Strubell and Lattin had the choice of
shooting down Rickard when I drove him into camp, or of letting
him go. They knew it was of no use to ask a pledge of him in payment
for their kindness, for he wouldn’t regard any promise as binding;
so, not willing to treat him as he deserved, perhaps they took
the fellow for what he was, and then let him go."</p>

<p>"You may be right, but the explanation doesn’t amount to much,
and doesn’t satisfy me."</p>

<p>"Nor me either. I would like to hear yours."</p>

<p>"I haven’t any. They are hard at it now!"</p>

<p>The Texans were talking more excitedly than ever, but did not
forget to keep their voices so low that no stray word reached
the ears of the puzzled youths.</p>

<p>The conference, however, speedily reached its conclusion. Their
talking ceased, and, bringing their horses to a standstill, they
waited for the boys and the pack horses to join them.</p>

<p>The faces of Strubell and Lattin showed signs of the stirring
conversation, but, as the boys anticipated, they were silent as
to the theme.</p>

<p>"We must make a change in our course," said the elder, who immediately
turned the head of his pony to the westward, in the direction
of the hills among which they had spent the previous night. It
was near noon, and the major part of the day was gone, when they
reached the rougher section where the Texans said the camp was
to be made.</p>

<p>They showed their usual good judgment in the selection of a favorable
site, for it was near another running stream, larger than the
previous one, though the current was roiled and lukewarm. They
might count themselves fortunate, however, that they were able
to find water at all; for thirst has caused the death of untold
thousands of cattle on the vast plains of Texas, and brought great
suffering to those who have ventured not alone upon the Llano
Estacado, but in other localities where moisture is almost unknown.</p>

<p>The pack horses were unloaded, saddles and bridles removed, and
the ponies allowed to crop the scanty grass. It was too early
for the regular evening meal, but considerable fuel was gathered;
and, much sooner than there seemed to be any need for it, a fire
was started, the smoke from which rose vertically, and was of
so dark a color that it must have been visible for a long distance
across the plain.</p>

<p>During all this time the three horsemen in the eastern horizon
were not forgotten. The glasses were often turned thither, and
there could be no doubt that Rickard and his companions were keeping
our friends in sight. Evidently they were determined that they
should not be lost.</p>

<p>The use of spy glasses has never been common among the cowmen,
who are generally gifted with such keen eyesight that they scorn
everything in the nature of artificial help. Counting upon this
fact, it was not unlikely that Rickard believed that, by hovering
on the line of invisibility, he would escape attention, or at
least suspicion, on the part of the Texans. Had he known of the
field glasses, he must have made an important change in his programme.</p>

<p>The fact that our friends were without a particle of food did
not cause them concern. They were not likely to suffer from starvation,
for, beside the stray cattle that they were warranted in using
in an emergency (always holding themselves ready to reimburse
the owner when it could be done), there were antelope and other
animals to be found among the hills.</p>

<p>But Lattin stated that, unless some kind of game would be accommodating
enough to come forward and offer itself as a sacrifice to their
needs, they would content themselves with a good cup of coffee
around, making up for the light meal when morning should come.</p>

<p>When the sun sank behind the hills, Rickard and his party became
invisible to the naked eye. The supposition might have been that
they had withdrawn and would be seen no more, but for the story
told by the field glasses. Under their power it was discovered
that the scamps had dismounted near a small arroya or natural
depression, and compelled their animals to lie down. Seating themselves
at the same time on the grass, they filled too small an angle
for the unassisted eye to note them across the intervening space.</p>

<p>Strubell turned to Lattin and spoke:</p>

<p>"Bell’s cunning, but he does not dream about the spy glasses."</p>

<p>"We’re bound to hear from him before morning," replied Lattin.</p>

<p>They did not mean that their words should be overheard, but Nick
caught them all, though he affected ignorance.</p>

<p>The next sentences were meant for the youths.</p>

<p>"Hadn’t we better move over the trail into the hills, Ard?" asked
the younger Texan, as though the idea had just come to him.</p>

<p>"Why should we do that?" inquired the other, as if in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, you know of that spring where we’ve camped many a time,
and once had the brush with half a hundred Comanches. There are
more rocks and bowlders there, and everything is a blamed sight
better for a fight than it is here."</p>

<p>"Now, Baker, you aint so foolish as to think Bell and the others
mean to disturb us?" asked Strubell, apparently forgetting the
words uttered by himself only a few minutes before.</p>

<p>"Well, maybe not, but you know as well as me that it won’t do
to trust him further than you can see him."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Baker, what will be better," spoke up Strubell,
like a man with a new and brilliant idea; "we’ll send the boys
ahead to the spring with the pack horses, while we wait here and
find out just what Bell is up to."</p>

<p>"That is a good plan," added Lattin heartily; "let’s do it."</p>

<p>The Texans now turned to Nick and Herbert, as though they did
not suspect they had caught any of the conversation.</p>

<p>"Boys, we want to watch Bell and the others for a while, and
have made up our minds to let you ride some distance over the
trail, while we stay here and watch. I have proposed it, and Baker
agrees that the plan is a good one. You have no objections?"</p>

<p>It occurred to Nick to ask in what way it was likely to improve
their eyesight and the power of the glasses, by sending him and
Herbert off. Surely their presence or absence could not operate
one way or the other. The proposition was not very profound or
bright, but, keeping back his thoughts, he promptly answered:</p>

<p>"Herbert and I are always ready to do cheerfully whatever you
decide is best for us."</p>

<p>"Thanks!—spoken like a man. Now, you see the trail just beyond,"
added Strubell, pointing to a faintly marked path; "it has been
used since the days of old Moses Austin and Sam Houston, and is
so plain that you can’t miss it. It leads into the hills for a
quarter of a mile, and then turns north through a sort of valley.
A little more than half a mile further, and you will come upon
one of the prettiest springs of water in Texas. There’s where
you will unsaddle and make camp for to-night."</p>

<p>"When will you join us?"</p>

<p>"We hope to do so in the course of a few hours, but don’t be
alarmed if you see nothing of us before morning."</p>
