WITHOUT any sense of transition the bishop found himself
seated in the little North Library of the Athenaeum club and
staring at the bust of John Wilson Croker. He was sitting
motionless and musing deeply. He was questioning with a cool and
steady mind whether he had seen a vision or whether he had had a
dream. If it had been a dream it had been an extraordinarily
vivid and convincing dream. He still seemed to be in the presence
of God, and it perplexed him not at all that he should also be in
the presence of Croker. The feeling of mental rottenness and
insecurity that had weakened his thought through the period of
his illness, had gone. He was secure again within himself.
<P>
It did not seem to matter fundamentally whether it was an
experience of things without or of things within him that had
happened to him. It was clear to him that much that he had seen
was at most expressive, that some was altogether symbolical. For
example, there was that sudden absurd realization of his sash and
gaiters, and his perception of them as encumbrances in his
pursuit of God. But the setting and essential of the whole thing
remained in his mind neither expressive nor symbolical, but as
real and immediately perceived, and that was the presence and
kingship of God. God was still with him and about him and over
him and sustaining him. He was back again in his world and his
ordinary life, in his clothing and his body and his club, but God
had been made and remained altogether plain and manifest.
<P>
Whether an actual vision had made his conviction, or whether
the conviction of his own subconscious mind had made the dream,
seemed but a small matter beside the conviction that this was
indeed the God he had desired and the God who must rule his life.
<P>
"The stuff? The stuff had little to do with it. It just cleared
my head.... I have seen. I have seen really. I know."
<P>
(2)
<P>
<P>
For a long time as it seemed the bishop remained wrapped in
clouds of luminous meditation. Dream or vision it did not
matter; the essential thing was that he had made up his mind
about God, he had found God. Moreover, he perceived that his
theological perplexities had gone. God was higher and simpler and
nearer than any theological God, than the God of the Three
Creeds. Those creeds lay about in his mind now like garments
flung aside, no trace nor suspicion of divinity sustained them
any longer. And now--Now he would go out into the world.
<P>
The little Library of the Athenaeum has no visible door. He
went to the book-masked entrance in the corner, and felt among
the bookshelves for the hidden latch. Then he paused, held by a
curious thought. What exactly was the intention of that
symbolical struggle with his sash and gaiters, and why had they
impeded his pursuit of God?
<P>
To what particularly significant action was he going out?
<P>
The Three Creeds were like garments flung aside. But he was
still wearing the uniform of a priest in the service of those
three creeds.
<P>
After a long interval he walked into the big reading-room. He
ordered some tea and dry toast and butter, and sat down very
thoughtfully in a corner. He was still sitting and thinking at
half-past eight.
<P>
It may seem strange to the reader that this bishop who had been
doubting and criticizing the church and his system of beliefs for
four long years had never before faced the possibility of a
severance from his ecclesiastical dignity. But he had grown up in
the church, his life had been so entirely clerical and Anglican,
that the widest separation he had hitherto been able to imagine
from this past had left him still a bishop, heretical perhaps,
innovating in the broadening of beliefs and the liberalizing of
practice, defensive even as Chasters was defensive, but still
with the palace and his dignities, differing in opinion rather
than in any tangible reality from his previous self. For a
bishop, disbelief in the Church is a far profounder scepticism
than mere disbelief in God. God is unseen, and in daily things
unfelt; but the Church is with the predestined bishop always. His
concept of the extremest possible departure from orthodoxy had
been something that Chasters had phrased as "a restatement of
Christ." It was a new idea, an idea that had come with an immense
effect of severance and novelty, that God could be other than the
God of the Creed, could present himself to the imagination as a
figure totally unlike the white, gentle, and compromising
Redeemer of an Anglican's thought. That the bishop should treat
the whole teaching of the church and the church itself as wrong,
was an idea so new that it fell upon him now like a thunderbolt
out of a cloudless sky. But here, clear in his mind now, was a
feeling, amounting to conviction, that it was the purpose and
gesture of the true God that he should come right out of the
church and all his professions.
<P>
And in the first glow of his vision he felt this gesture
imperative. He must step right out.... Whither? how? And when?
<P>
To begin with it seemed to him that an immediate renunciation
was demanded. But it was a momentous step. He wanted to think.
And to go on thinking. Rather than to act precipitately. Although
the imperative seemed absolute, some delaying and arresting
instinct insisted that he must "think" If he went back to
Princhester, the everyday duties of his position would confront
him at once with an effect of a definite challenge. He decided to
take one of the Reform club bedrooms for two or three days, and
wire to Princhester that he was "unavoidably delayed in town,"
without further explanations. Then perhaps this inhibitory force
would give way.
<P>
It did not, however, give way. His mind sat down for two days
in a blank amazement at the course before him, and at the end of
that time this reasonless and formless institution was as strong
as ever. During that time, except for some incidental exchanges
at his clubs, he talked to no one. At first he did not want to
talk to any one. He remained mentally and practically active,
with a still intensely vivid sense that God, the true God, stood
watching him and waiting for him to follow. And to follow meant
slipping right out of all the world he had ever known. To thrust
his foot right over the edge of a cliff would scarcely have
demanded more from the bishop's store of resolution. He stood on
the very verge. The chief secretion of his mind was a shadowy
experiment or so in explanation of why he did not follow.
<P>
(3)
<P>
<P>
Insensibly the extreme vividness of his sense of God's nearness
decreased. But he still retained a persuasion of the reality of
an immediate listener waiting, and of the need of satisfying him.
<P>
On the third day he found his mind still further changed. He no
longer felt that God was in Pall Mall or St. James's Park,
whither he resorted to walk and muse. He felt now that God was
somewhere about the horizon....
<P>
He felt too no longer that he thought straight into the mind of
God. He thought now of what he would presently say to God. He
turned over and rehearsed phrases. With that came a desire to try
them first on some other hearer. And from that to the attentive
head of Lady Sunderbund, prettily bent towards him, was no great
leap. She would understand, if any one could understand, the
great change that had happened in his mind.
<P>
He found her address in the telephone book. She could be quite
alone to him if he wouldn't mind "just me." It was, he said,
exactly what he desired.
<P>
But when he got to her great airy flat overlooking Hyde Park,
with its Omega Workshop furniture and its arresting decoration,
he was not so sure whether this encounter was so exactly the
thing he had desired as he had supposed.
<P>
The world had become opaque and real again as he walked up St.
James's Street and past the Ritz. He had a feeling that he was
taking an afternoon off from God. The adventurous modernity of
the room in which he waited intensified that. One whole white
wall was devoted to a small picture by Wyndham Lewis. It was like
a picture of an earthquake in a city of aniline pink and grey and
keen green cardboard, and he wished it had never existed.
<P>
He turned his back upon it and stared out of the window over
the trees and greenery. The balcony was decorated with white and
pink geraniums in pots painted black and gold, and the railings
of the balcony were black and gold with crimson shape like
squares wildly out of drawing.
<P>
Lady Sunderbund kept him waiting perhaps five minutes. Then she
came sailing in to him.
<P>
She was dressed in a way and moved across the room in a way
that was more reminiscent of Botticelli's Spring than ever--
only with a kind of superadded stiffish polonaise of lace--and
he did not want to be reminded of Botticelli's Spring or wonder
why she had taken to stiff lace polonaises. He did not enquire
whether he had met Lady Sunderbund to better advantage at Mrs.
Garstein Fellows' or whether his memory had overrated her or
whether anything had happened to his standard of taste, but his
feeling now was decidedly one of disappointment, and all the talk
and self-examination he had promised himself seemed to wither and
hide away within him. For a time he talked of her view, and then
admired her room and its arrangement, which he thought really
were quite unbecomingly flippant and undignified for a room. Then
came the black tea-things on their orange tray, and he searched
in his mind for small talk to sustain their interview.
<P>
But he had already betrayed his disposition to "go on with our
talk" in his telephone enquiry, and Lady Sunderbund, perceiving
his shyness, began to make openings for him, at first just little
hinting openings, and then larger and larger ones, until at last
one got him.
<P>
"I'm so glad," she said, "to see you again. I'm so glad to go
on with oua talk. I've thought about it and thought about it."
<P>
She beamed at him happily.
<P>
"I've thought ova ev'y wo'd you said," she went on, when she
had finished conveying her pretty bliss to him. "I've been so
helped by thinking the k'eeds are symbols. And all you said. And
I've felt time after time, you couldn't stay whe' you we'. That
what you we' saying to me, would have to be said 'ight out."
<P>
That brought him in. He could not very well evade that opening
without incivility. After all he had asked to see her, and it was
a foolish thing to let little decorative accidentals put him off
his friendly purpose. A woman may have flower-pots painted gold
with black checkers and still be deeply understanding. He
determined to tell her what was in his mind. But he found
something barred him from telling that he had had an actual
vision of God. It was as if that had been a private and
confidential meeting. It wasn't, he felt, for him either to boast
a privilege or tell others of things that God had not chosen to
show them.
<P>
"Since I saw you," he said, "I have thought a great deal--of
the subject of our conversation."
<P>
"I have been t'ying to think," she said in a confirmatory tone,
as if she had co-operated.
<P>
"My faith in God grows," he said.
<P>
She glowed. Her lips fell apart. She flamed attention.
<P>
"But it grows less like the faith of the church, less and less.
I was born and trained in Anglicanism, and it is with a sort of
astonishment I find myself passing now out of every sort of
Catholicism--seeing it from the outside...."
<P>
"Just as one might see Buddhism," she supplied.
<P>
"And yet feeling nearer � infinitely nearer to God," he said.
<P>
"Yes," she panted; "yes."
<P>
"I thought if one went out, one went out just to doubt and
darkness."
<P>
"And you don't?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"You have gone at one step to a new 'iligion!"
<P>
He stared for a moment at the phrase.
<P>
"To religion," he said.
<P>
"It is so wondyful," she said, with her hands straight down
upon the couch upon which she was sitting, and leaning forward at
him, so as to seem almost as much out of drawing as a modern
picture.
<P>
"It seems," he reflected; "--as if it were a natural thing."
<P>
She came back to earth very slowly. She turned to the
tea-things with hushed and solemn movements as though she
administered a ceremony of peculiar significance. The bishop too
rose slowly out of the profundity of his confession. "No sugar
please," he said, arresting the lump in mid air.
<P>
It was only when they were embarked upon cups of tea and had a
little refreshed themselves, that she carried the talk further.
<P>
"Does it mean that you must leave the church?" she asked.
<P>
"It seemed so at first," he said. "But now I do not know. I do
not know what I ought to do."
<P>
She awaited his next thought.
<P>
"It is as if one had lived in a room all one's life and thought
it the world--and then suddenly walked out through a door and
discovered the sea and the mountains and stars. So it was with me
and the Anglican Church. It seems so extraordinary now--and it
would have seemed the most natural thing a year ago--to think
that I ever believed that the Anglican Compromise was the final
truth of religion, that nothing more until the end of the world
could ever be known that Cosmo Gordon Lang did not know, that
there could be no conception of God and his quality that Randall
Davidson did not possess."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"I did," he said.
<P>
"I did," she responded with round blue eyes of wonder.
<P>
"At the utmost the Church of England is a tabernacle on a
road."
<P>
"A 'oad that goes whe'?" she rhetorized.
<P>
"Exactly," said the bishop, and put down his cup.
<P>
"You see, my dear Lady Sunderbund," he resumed, "I am exactly
in the same position of that man at the door."
<P>
She quoted aptly and softly: "The wo'ld was all befo' them whe'
to choose."
<P>
He was struck by the aptness of the words.
<P>
"I feel I have to come right out into the bare truth. What
exactly then do I become? Do I lose my priestly function because
I discover how great God is? But what am I to do?"
<P>
He opened a new layer of his thoughts to her.
<P>
"There is a saying," he remarked, "once a priest, always a
priest. I cannot imagine myself as other than what I am."
<P>
"But o'thodox no maw," she said.
<P>
"Orthodox--self-satisfied, no longer. A priest who seeks, an
exploring priest."
<P>
"In a Chu'ch of P'og'ess and B'othe'hood," she carried him on.
<P>
"At any rate, in a progressive and learning church."
<P>
She flashed and glowed assent.
<P>
"I have been haunted," he said, "by those words spoken at
Athens. 'Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, Him declare I unto
you.' That comes to me with an effect of--guidance is an
old-fashioned word--shall I say suggestion? To stand by the
altar bearing strange names and ancient symbols, speaking plainly
to all mankind of the one true God--!"
<P>
(4)
<P>
<P>
He did not get much beyond this point at the time, though he
remained talking with Lady Sunderbund for nearly an hour longer.
The rest was merely a beating out of what had already been said.
But insensibly she renewed her original charm, and as he became
accustomed to her he forgot a certain artificiality in her manner
and the extreme modernity of her costume and furniture. She was a
wonderful listener; nobody else could have helped him to
expression in quite the same way, and when he left her he felt
that now he was capable of stating his case in a coherent and
acceptable form to almost any intelligent hearer. He had a point
of view now that was no longer embarrassed by the immediate
golden presence of God; he was no longer dazzled nor ecstatic;
his problem had diminished to the scale of any other great human
problem, to the scale of political problems and problems of
integrity and moral principle, problems about which there is no
such urgency as there is about a house on fire, for example.
<P>
And now the desire for expression was running strong. He wanted
to state his situation; if he did not state he would have to act;
and as he walked back to the club dinner he turned over possible
interlocutors in his thoughts. Lord Rampound sat with him at
dinner, and he came near broaching the subject with him. But Lord
Rampound that evening had that morbid running of bluish legal
anecdotes which is so common an affliction with lawyers, and
theology sinks and dies in that turbid stream.
<P>
But as he lay in bed that night he thought of his old friend
and helper Bishop Likeman, and it was borne in upon him that he
should consult him. And this he did next day.
<P>
Since the days when the bishop had been only plain Mr. Scrope,
the youngest and most helpful of Likeman's historical band of
curates, their friendship had continued. Likeman had been a
second father to him; in particular his tact and helpfulness had
shone during those days of doubt and anxiety when dear old Queen
Victoria, God's representative on earth, had obstinately refused,
at the eleventh hour, to make him a bishop. She had those
pigheaded fits, and she was touchy about the bishops. She had
liked Scrope on account of the excellence of his German
pronunciation, but she had been irritated by newspaper paragraphs
--nobody could ever find out who wrote them and nobody could
ever find out who showed them to the old lady--anticipating his
elevation. She had gone very red in the face and stiffened in the
Guelphic manner whenever Scrope was mentioned, and so a rich
harvest of spiritual life had remained untilled for some months.
Likeman had brought her round.
<P>
It seemed arguable that Scrope owed some explanation to Likeman
before he came to any open breach with the Establishment.
<P>
He found Likeman perceptibly older and more shrivelled on
account of the war, but still as sweet and lucid and subtle as
ever. His voice sounded more than ever like a kind old woman's.
<P>
He sat buried in his cushions--for "nowadays I must save
every scrap of vitality"--and for a time contented himself with
drawing out his visitor's story.
<P>
Of course, one does not talk to Likeman of visions or
intuitions. "I am disturbed, I find myself getting out of touch;"
that was the bishop's tone.
<P>
Occasionally Likeman nodded slowly, as a physician might do at
the recital of familiar symptoms. "Yes," he said, "I have been
through most of this.... A little different in the
inessentials.... How clear you are!"
<P>
"You leave our stupid old Trinities--as I left them long
ago," said old Likeman, with his lean hand feeling and clawing at
the arm of his chair.
<P>
"But--!"
<P>
The old man raised his hand and dropped it. "You go away from
it all--straight as a line. I did. You take the wings of the
morning and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth. And there
you find--"
<P>
He held up a lean finger, and inclined it to tick off each
point.
<P>
"Fate--which is God the Father, the Power of the Heart, which
is God the Son, and that Light which comes in upon us from the
inaccessible Godhead, which is God the Holy Spirit."
<P>
"But I know of no God the Holy Spirit, and Fate is not God at
all. I saw in my vision one sole God, uncrucified, militant--
conquering and to conquer."
<P>
Old Likeman stared. "You saw!"
<P>
The Bishop of Princhester had not meant to go so far. But he
stuck to his words. "As if I saw with my eyes. A God of light and
courage."
<P>
"You have had visions, Scrope?"
<P>
"I seemed to see."
<P>
"No, you have just been dreaming dreams."
<P>
"But why should one not see?"
<P>
"See! The things of the spirit. These symbols as realities!
These metaphors as men walking!"
<P>
"You talk like an agnostic."
<P>
"We are all agnostics. Our creeds are expressions of ourselves
and our attitude and relationship to the unknown. The triune God
is just the form of our need and disposition. I have always
assumed that you took that for granted. Who has ever really seen
or heard or felt God? God is neither of the senses nor of the
mind; he is of the soul. You are realistic, you are
materialistic...."
<P>
His voice expostulated.
<P>
The Bishop of Princhester reflected. The vision of God was far
off among his memories now, and difficult to recall. But he said
at last: "I believe there is a God and that he is as real a
person as you or I. And he is not the theological God we set out
before the world."
<P>
"Personification," said Likeman. "In the eighteenth century
they used to draw beautiful female figures as Science and
Mathematics. Young men have loved Science--and Freedom--as
Pygmalion loved Galatea. Have it so if you will. Have a visible
person for your Deity. But let me keep up my--spirituality."
<P>
"Your spirituality seems as thin as a mist. Do you really
believe--anything?"
<P>
"Everything!" said Likeman emphatically, sitting up with a
transitory vigour. "Everything we two have ever professed
together. I believe that the creeds of my church do express all
that can possibly be expressed in the relationship of--That "--
he made a comprehensive gesture with a twist of his hand upon its
wrist--"to the human soul. I believe that they express it as
well as the human mind can express it. Where they seem to be
contradictory or absurd, it is merely that the mystery is
paradoxical. I believe that the story of the Fall and of the
Redemption is a complete symbol, that to add to it or to subtract
from it or to alter it is to diminish its truth; if it seems
incredible at this point or that, then simply I admit my own
mental defect. And I believe in our Church, Scrope, as the
embodied truth of religion, the divine instrument in human
affairs. I believe in the security of its tradition, in the
complete and entire soundness of its teaching, in its essential
authority and divinity."
<P>
He paused, and put his head a little on one side and smiled
sweetly. "And now can you say I do not believe?"
<P>
"But the historical Christ, the man Jesus?"
<P>
"A life may be a metaphor. Why not? Yes, I believe it all.
All."
<P>
The Bishop of Princhester was staggered by this complete
acceptance. "I see you believe all you profess," he said, and
remained for a moment or so rallying his forces.
<P>
"Your vision--if it was a vision--I put it to you, was just
some single aspect of divinity," said Likeman. "We make a mistake
in supposing that Heresy has no truth in it. Most heresies are
only a disproportionate apprehension of some essential truth.
Most heretics are men who have suddenly caught a glimpse through
the veil of some particular verity.... They are dazzled by that
aspect. All the rest has vanished.... They are obsessed. You are
obsessed clearly by this discovery of the militancy of God. God
the Son--as Hero. And you want to go out to the simple worship
of that one aspect. You want to go out to a Dissenter's tent in
the wilderness, instead of staying in the Great Temple of the
Ages."
<P>
Was that true?
<P>
For some moments it sounded true.
<P>
The Bishop of Princhester sat frowning and looking at that.
Very far away was the vision now of that golden Captain who bade
him come. Then at a thought the bishop smiled.
<P>
"The Great Temple of the Ages," he repeated. "But do you
remember the trouble we had when the little old Queen was so
pigheaded?"
<P>
"Oh! I remember, I remember," said Likeman, smiling with
unshaken confidence. "Why not?"
<P>
"For sixty years all we bishops in what you call the Great
Temple of the Ages, were appointed and bullied and kept in our
places by that pink irascible bit of dignity. I remember how at
the time I didn't dare betray my boiling indignation even to you
--I scarcely dared admit it to myself...."
<P>
He paused.
<P>
"It doesn't matter at all," and old Likeman waved it aside.
<P>
"Not at all," he confirmed, waving again.
<P>
"I spoke of the whole church of Christ on earth," he went on.
"These things, these Victorias and Edwards and so on, are
temporary accidents--just as the severance of an Anglican from
a Roman communion and a Greek orthodox communion are temporary
accidents. You will remark that wise men in all ages have been
able to surmount the difficulty of these things. Why? Because
they knew that in spite of all these splits and irregularities
and defacements--like the cracks and crannies and lichens on a
cathedral wall--the building held good, that it was shelter and
security. There is no other shelter and security. And so I come
to your problem. Suppose it is true that you have this incidental
vision of the militant aspect of God, and he isn't, as you see
him now that is,--he isn't like the Trinity, he isn't like the
Creed, he doesn't seem to be related to the Church, then comes
the question, are you going out for that? And whither do you go
if you do go out? The Church remains. We alter doctrines not by
changing the words but by shifting the accent. We can
under�accentuate below the threshold of consciousness."
<P>
"But can we?"
<P>
"We do. Where's Hell now? Eighty years ago it warmed the whole
Church. It was--as some atheist or other put it the other day
--the central heating of the soul. But never mind that point
now. Consider the essential question, the question of breaking
with the church. Ask yourself, whither would you go? To become an
oddity! A Dissenter. A Negative. Self emasculated. The spirit
that denies. You would just go out. You would just cease to serve
Religion. That would be all. You wouldn't do anything. The Church
would go on; everything else would go on. Only you would be lost
in the outer wilderness.
<P>
"But then--"
<P>
Old Likeman leant forward and pointed a bony finger. "Stay in
the Church and modify it. Bring this new light of yours to the
altar."
<P>
There was a little pause.
<P>
"No man," the bishop thought aloud, "putteth new wine into old
bottles."
<P>
Old Likeman began to speak and had a fit of coughing. "Some of
these texts--whuff, whuff--like a conjuror's hat--whuff--
make 'em--fit anything."
<P>
A man-servant appeared and handed a silver box of lozenges into
which the old bishop dipped with a trembling hand.
<P>
"Tricks of that sort," he said, "won't do, Scrope--among
professionals.
<P>
"And besides," he was inspired; "true religion is old wine--
as old as the soul.
<P>
"You are a bishop in the Church of Christ on Earth," he summed
it up. "And you want to become a detached and wandering Ancient
Mariner from your shipwreck of faith with something to explain--
that nobody wants to hear. You are going out I suppose you have
means?"
<P>
The old man awaited the answer to his abrupt enquiry with a
handful of lozenges.
<P>
"No," said the Bishop of Princhester, "practically--I
haven't."
<P>
"My dear boy!" it was as if they were once more rector and
curate. "My dear brother! do you know what the value of an
ex-bishop is in the ordinary labour market?"
<P>
"I have never thought of that."
<P>
"Evidently. You have a wife and children?"
<P>
"Five daughters."
<P>
"And your wife married you--I remember, she married you soon
after you got that living in St. John's Wood. I suppose she took
it for granted that you were fixed in an ecclesiastical career.
That was implicit in the transaction."
<P>
"I haven't looked very much at that side of the matter yet,"
said the Bishop of Princhester.
<P>
"It shouldn't be a decisive factor," said Bishop Likeman, "not
decisive. But it will weigh. It should weigh...."
<P>
The old man opened out fresh aspects of the case. His argument
was for delay, for deliberation. He went on to a wider set of
considerations. A man who has held the position of a bishop for
some years is, he held, no longer a free man in matters of
opinion. He has become an official part of a great edifice which
supports the faith of multitudes of simple and dependant
believers. He has no right to indulge recklessly in intellectual
and moral integrities. He may understand, but how is the flock to
understand? He may get his own soul clear, but what will happen
to them? He will just break away their supports, astonish them,
puzzle them, distress them, deprive them of confidence, convince
them of nothing.
<P>
"Intellectual egotism may be as grave a sin," said Bishop
Likeman, "as physical selfishness.
<P>
"Assuming even that you are absolutely right," said Bishop
Likeman, "aren't you still rather in the position of a man who
insists upon Swedish exercises and a strengthening dietary on a
raft?"
<P>
"I think you have made out a case for delay," said his hearer.
<P>
"Three months."
<P>
The Bishop of Princhester conceded three months.
<P>
"Including every sort of service. Because, after all, even
supposing it is damnable to repeat prayers and creeds you do not
believe in, and administer sacraments you think superstition,
nobody can be damned but yourself. On the other hand if you
express doubts that are not yet perfectly digested--you
experiment with the souls of others...."
<P>
(5)
<P>
<P>
The bishop found much to ponder in his old friend's counsels.
They were discursive and many-fronted, and whenever he seemed to
be penetrating or defeating the particular considerations under
examination the others in the background had a way of appearing
invincible. He had a strong persuasion that Likeman was wrong--
and unanswerable. And the true God now was no more than the
memory of a very vividly realized idea. It was clear to the
bishop that he was no longer a churchman or in the generally
accepted sense of the word a Christian, and that he was bound to
come out of the church. But all sense of urgency had gone. It was
a matter demanding deliberation and very great consideration for
others.
<P>
He took no more of Dale's stuff because he felt bodily sound
and slept well. And he was now a little shy of this potent fluid.
He went down to Princhester the next day, for his compromise of
an interval of three months made it seem possible to face his
episcopal routine again. It was only when he was back in his own
palace that the full weight of his domestic responsibilities in
the discussion of the course he had to take, became apparent.
<P>
Lady Ella met him with affection and solicitude.
<P>
"I was tired and mentally fagged," he said. "A day or so in
London had an effect of change."
<P>
She agreed that he looked much better, and remained for a
moment or so scrutinizing him with the faint anxiety of one
resolved to be completely helpful.
<P>
He regarded her with a renewed sense of her grace and dignity
and kindliness. She was wearing a grey dress of soft silky
material, touched with blue and covered with what seemed to him
very rich and beautiful lace; her hair flowed back very
graciously from her broad brow, and about her wrist and neck were
delicate lines of gold. She seemed tremendously at home and right
just where she was, in that big hospitable room, cultured but
Anglican, without pretensions or novelties, with a glow of bound
books, with the grand piano that Miriam, his third daughter, was
beginning to play so well, with the tea equipage of shining
silver and fine porcelain.
<P>
He sat down contentedly in the low armchair beside her.
<P>
It wasn't a setting that one would rashly destroy....
<P>
And that evening at dinner this sense of his home as a complex
of finely adjusted things not to be rashly disturbed was still
more in the mind of the bishop. At dinner he had all his
domesticities about him. It was the family time, from eight until
ten, at which latter hour he would usually go back from the
drawing-room to his study. He surveyed the table. Eleanor was at
home for a few days, looking a little thin and bright but very
keen and happy. She had taken a first in the first part of the
Moral Science Tripos, and she was working hard now for part two.
Clementina was to go back to Newnham with her next September. She
aspired to history. Miriam's bent was musical. She and Phoebe and
Daphne and Clementina were under the care of skilful Mademoiselle
Lafarge, most tactful of Protestant French-women, Protestant and
yet not too Protestant, one of those rare French Protestants in
whom a touch of Bergson and the Pasteur Monod
<P>
<P>
           "scarce suspected, animates the whole."
<P>
And also they had lessons, so high are our modern standards of
education, from Mr. Blent, a brilliant young mathematician in
orders, who sat now next to Lady Ella. Mr. Whippham, the
chaplain, was at the bishop's right hand, ready for any chance of
making arrangements to clear off the small arrears of duty the
little holiday in London had accumulated. The bishop surveyed all
these bright young people between himself and the calm beauty of
his wife. He spoke first to one and then another upon the things
that interested them. It rejoiced his heart to be able to give
them education and opportunity, it pleased him to see them in
clothes that he knew were none the less expensive because of
their complete simplicity. Miriam and Mr. Blent wrangled
pleasantly about Debussy, and old Dunk waited as though in orders
of some rare and special sort that qualified him for this
service.
<P>
All these people, the bishop reflected, counted upon him that
this would go on....
<P>
Eleanor was answering some question of her mother's. They were
so oddly alike and so curiously different, and both in their
several ways so fine. Eleanor was dark like his own mother.
Perhaps she did a little lack Lady Ella's fine reserves; she
could express more, she could feel more acutely, she might easily
be very unhappy or very happy....
<P>
All these people counted on him. It was indeed acutely true, as
Likeman had said, that any sudden breach with his position would
be a breach of faith--so far as they were concerned.
<P>
And just then his eye fell upon the epergne, a very old and
beautiful piece of silver, that graced the dinner-table. It had
been given him, together with an episcopal ring, by his curates
and choristers at the Church of the Holy Innocents, when he
became bishop of Pinner. When they gave it him, had any one of
them dreamt that some day he might be moved to strike an
ungracious blow at the mother church that had reared them all?
<P>
It was his custom to join the family in the drawing-room after
dinner. To-night he was a little delayed by Whippham, with some
trivialities about next month's confirmations in Pringle and
Princhester. When he came in he found Miriam playing, and playing
very beautifully one of those later sonatas of Beethoven, he
could never remember whether it was Of. 109 or Of. 111, but he
knew that he liked it very much; it was solemn and sombre with
phases of indescribable sweetness--while Clementina, Daphne
and Mademoiselle Lafarge went on with their war knitting and
Phoebe and Mr. Blent bent their brows over chess. Eleanor was
reading the evening paper. Lady Ella sat on a high chair by the
coffee things, and he stood in the doorway surveying the peaceful
scene for a moment or so, before he went across the room and sat
down on the couch close to her.
<P>
"You look tired," she whispered softly.
<P>
"Worries."
<P>
"That Chasters case?"
<P>
"Things developing out of that. I must tell you later." It
would be, he felt, a good way of breaking the matter to her.
<P>
"Is the Chasters case coming on again, Daddy?" asked Eleanor.
<P>
He nodded.
<P>
"It's a pity," she said.
<P>
"What ?
<P>
"That he can't be left alone."
<P>
"It's Sir Reginald Phipps. The Church would be much more
tolerant if it wasn't for the House of Laymen. But they--they
feel they must do something."
<P>
He seized the opportunity of the music ceasing to get away from
the subject. "Miriam dear," he asked, raising his voice; "is that
109 or 111? I can never tell."
<P>
"That is always 111, Daddy," said Miriam. "It's the other one
is 109." And then evidently feeling that she had been pert:
"Would you like me to play you 109, Daddy?"
<P>
"I should love it, my dear." And he leant back and prepared to
listen in such a thorough way that Eleanor would have no chance
of discussing the Chasters' heresies. But this was interrupted by
the consummation of the coffee, and Mr. Blent, breaking a long
silence with "Mate in three, if I'm not mistaken," leapt to his
feet to be of service. Eleanor, with the rough seriousness of
youth, would not leave the Chasters case alone.
<P>
"But need you take action against Mr. Chasters?" she asked at
once.
<P>
"It's a very complicated subject, my dear," he said.
<P>
"His arguments?"
<P>
"The practical considerations."
<P>
"But what are practical considerations in such a case?"
<P>
"That's a post-graduate subject, Norah," her father said with a
smile and a sigh.
<P>
"But," began Eleanor, gathering fresh forces.
<P>
"Daddy is tired," Lady Ella intervened, patting him on the
head.
<P>
"Oh, terribly!--of that," he said, and so escaped Eleanor for
the evening.
<P>
But he knew that before very long he would have to tell his
wife of the changes that hung over their lives; it would be
shabby to let the avalanche fall without giving the longest
possible warning; and before they parted that night he took her
hands in his and said: "There is much I have to tell you, dear.
Things change, the whole world changes. The church must not live
in a dream....
<P>
"No," she whispered. "I hope you will sleep to-night," and held
up her grave sweet face to be kissed.
<P>
(6)
<P>
<P>
But he did not sleep perfectly that night.
<P>
He did not sleep indeed very badly, but he lay for some time
thinking, thinking not onward but as if he pressed his mind
against very strong barriers that had closed again. His vision of
God which had filled the heavens, had become now gem-like, a
minute, hard, clear-cut conviction in his mind that he had to
disentangle himself from the enormous complications of symbolism
and statement and organization and misunderstanding in the church
and achieve again a simple and living worship of a simple and
living God. Likeman had puzzled and silenced him, only upon
reflection to convince him that amidst such intricacies of
explanation the spirit cannot live. Creeds may be symbolical, but
symbols must not prevaricate. A church that can symbolize
everything and anything means nothing.
<P>
It followed from this that he ought to leave the church. But
there came the other side of this perplexing situation. His
feelings as he lay in his bed were exactly like those one has in
a dream when one wishes to run or leap or shout and one can
achieve no movement, no sound. He could not conceive how he could
possibly leave the church.
<P>
His wife became as it were the representative of all that held
him helpless. She and he had never kept secret from one another
any plan of action, any motive, that affected the other. It was
clear to him that any movement towards the disavowal of doctrinal
Christianity and the renunciation of his see must be first
discussed with her. He must tell her before he told the world.
<P>
And he could not imagine his telling her except as an
incredibly shattering act.
<P>
So he left things from day to day, and went about his episcopal
routines. He preached and delivered addresses in such phrases as
he knew people expected, and wondered profoundly why it was that
it should be impossible for him to discuss theological points
with Lady Ella. And one afternoon he went for a walk with Eleanor
along the banks of the Prin, and found himself, in response to
certain openings of hers, talking to her in almost exactly the
same terms as Likeman had used to him.
<P>
Then suddenly the problem of this theological eclaircissement
was complicated in an unexpected fashion.
<P>
He had just been taking his Every Second Thursday Talk with
Diocesan Men Helpers. He had been trying to be plain and simple
upon the needless narrowness of enthusiastic laymen. He was still
in the Bishop Andrews cap and purple cassock he affected on these
occasions; the Men Helpers loved purple; and he was disentangling
himself from two or three resolute bores--for our loyal laymen
can be at times quite superlative bores--when Miriam came to
him.
<P>
"Mummy says, 'Come to the drawing-room if you can.' There is a
Lady Sunderbund who seems particularly to want to see you."
<P>
He hesitated for a moment, and then decided that this was a
conversation he ought to control.
<P>
He found Lady Sunderbund looking very tall and radiantly
beautiful in a sheathlike dress of bright crimson trimmed with
snow-white fur and a white fur toque. She held out a long
white-gloved hand to him and cried in a tone of comradeship and
profound understanding: "I've come, Bishop!"
<P>
"You've come to see me?" he said without any sincerity in his
polite pleasure.
<P>
"I've come to P'inchesta to stay!" she cried with a bright
triumphant rising note.
<P>
She evidently considered Lady Ella a mere conversational
stop-gap, to be dropped now that the real business could be
commenced. She turned her pretty profile to that lady, and
obliged the bishop with a compact summary of all that had
preceded his arrival. "I have been telling Lady Ella," she said,
"I've taken a house, fu'nitua and all! Hea. In P'inchesta! I've
made up my mind to sit unda you--as they say in Clapham. I've
come 'ight down he' fo' good. I've taken a little house--oh! a
sweet little house that will be all over 'oses next month. I'm
living f'om 'oom to 'oom and having the othas done up. It's in
that little quiet st'eet behind you' ga'den wall. And he' I am!"
<P>
"Is it the old doctor's house?" asked Lady Ella.
<P>
"Was it an old docta?" cried Lady Sunderbund. "How delightful!
And now I shall be a patient!"
<P>
She concentrated upon the bishop.
<P>
"Oh, I've been thinking all the time of all the things you told
me. Ova and ova. It's all so wondyful and so--so like a G'ate
Daw opening. New light. As if it was all just beginning."
<P>
She clasped her hands.
<P>
The bishop felt that there were a great number of points to
this situation, and that it was extremely difficult to grasp them
all at once. But one that seemed of supreme importance to his
whirling intelligence was that Lady Ella should not know that he
had gone to relieve his soul by talking to Lady Sunderbund in
London. It had never occurred to him at the time that there was
any shadow of disloyalty to Lady Ella in his going to Lady
Sunderbund, but now he realized that this was a thing that would
annoy Lady Ella extremely. The conversation had in the first
place to be kept away from that. And in the second place it had
to be kept away from the abrupt exploitation of the new
theological developments.
<P>
He felt that something of the general tension would be relieved
if they could all three be got to sit down.
<P>
"I've been talking for just upon two hours," he said to Lady
Ella. "It's good to see the water boiling for tea."
<P>
He put a chair for Lady Sunderbund to the right of Lady Ella,
got her into it by infusing an ecclesiastical insistence into his
manner, and then went and sat upon the music-stool on his wife's
left, so as to establish a screen of tea-things and cakes and so
forth against her more intimate enthusiasm. Meanwhile he began to
see his way clearer and to develop his line.
<P>
"Well, Lady Sunderbund," he said, "I can assure you that I
think you will be no small addition to the church life of
Princhester. But I warn you this is a hard-working and exacting
diocese. We shall take your money, all we can get of it, we shall
take your time, we shall work you hard."
<P>
"Wo'k me hard!" cried Lady Sunderbund with passion.
<P>
"We will, we will," said the bishop in a tone that ignored her
passionate note.
<P>
"I am sure Lady Sunderbund will be a great help to us," said
Lady Ella. "We want brightening. There's a dinginess...."
<P>
Lady Sunderbund beamed an acknowledgment. "I shall exact a
'eturn," she said. "I don't mind wo'king, but I shall wo'k like
the poo' students in the Middle Ages did, to get my teaching.
I've got my own soul to save as well as help saving othas. Since
oua last talk--"
<P>
She found the bishop handing her bread and butter. For a time
the bishop fought a delaying action with the tea-things, while he
sought eagerly and vainly in his mind for some good practical
topic in which he could entangle and suppress Lady Sunderbund's
enthusiasms. From this she broke away by turning suddenly to Lady
Ella.
<P>
"Youa husband's views," she said, "we'e a 'eal 'evelation to
me. It was like not being blind--all at once."
<P>
Lady Ella was always pleased to hear her husband praised. Her
colour brightened a little. "They seem very ordinary views," she
said modestly.
<P>
"You share them?" cried Lady Sunderbund.
<P>
"But of course," said Lady Ella.
<P>
"Wondyful!" cried Lady Sunderbund.
<P>
"Tell me, Lady Sunderbund," said the bishop, "are you going to
alter the outer appearance of the old doctor's house?" And found
that at last he had discovered the saving topic.
<P>
"Ha'dly at all," she said. "I shall just have it pointed white
and do the doa--I'm not su' how I shall do the doa. Whetha I
shall do the doa gold or a vehy, vehy 'itch blue."
<P>
For a time she and Lady Ella, to whom these ideas were novel,
discussed the animation of grey and sombre towns by house
painting. In such matter Lady Sunderbund had a Russian mind. "I
can't bea' g'ey," she said. "Not in my su'oundings, not in my
k'eed, nowhe'e." She turned to the bishop. "If I had my way I
would paint you' cathed'al inside and out."
<P>
"They used to be painted," said the bishop. "I don't know if
you have seen Ely. There the old painting has been largely
restored...."
<P>
From that to the end there was no real danger, and at last the
bishop found himself alone with his wife again.
<P>
"Remarkable person," he said tentatively. "I never met any one
whose faults were more visible. I met her at Wimbush House."
<P>
He glanced at his watch.
<P>
"What did she mean," asked Lady Ella abruptly, "by talking of
your new views? And about revelations?"
<P>
"She probably misunderstood something I said at the Garstein
Fellows'," he said. "She has rather a leaping mind."
<P>
He turned to the window, looked at his nails, and appeared to
be suddenly reminded of duties elsewhere....
<P>
It was chiefly manifest to him that the difficulties in
explaining the changes of his outlook to Lady Ella had now
increased enormously.
<P>
(7)
<P>
<P>
A day or so after Lady Sunderbund's arrival in Princhester the
bishop had a letter from Likeman. The old man was manifestly in
doubt about the effect of their recent conversation.
<P>
"My dear Scrope," it began. "I find myself thinking continually
about our interview and the difficulties you laid bare so frankly
to me. We touched upon many things in that talk, and I find
myself full of afterthoughts, and not perfectly sure either quite
of what I said or of what I failed to say. I feel that in many
ways I was not perhaps so clear and convincing as the justice of
my case should have made me, and you are one of my own particular
little company, you were one of the best workers in that band of
good workers, your life and your career are very much my concern.
I know you will forgive me if I still mingle something of the
paternal with my fraternal admonitions. I watched you closely. I
have still my old diaries of the St. Matthew's days, and I have
been looking at them to remind me of what you once were. It was
my custom to note my early impressions of all the men who worked
with me, because I have a firm belief in the soundness of first
impressions and the considerable risk one runs of having them
obscured by the accidents and habituations of constant
intercourse. I found that quite early in your days at St.
Matthew's I wrote against your name 'enthusiastic, but a saving
delicacy.' After all our life-long friendship I would not write
anything truer. I would say of you to-day, 'This man might have
been a revivalist, if he were not a gentleman.' There is the
enthusiast, there is the revivalist, in you. It seems to me that
the stresses and questions of this great crisis in the world's
history have brought it nearer to the surface than I had ever
expected it to come.
<P>
"I quite understand and I sympathize with your impatience with
the church at the present time; we present a spectacle of pompous
insignificance hard to bear with. We are doing very little, and
we are giving ourselves preposterous airs. There seems to be an
opinion abroad that in some quasi-automatic way the country is
going to collapse after the war into the arms of the church and
the High Tories; a possibility I don't accept for a moment. Why
should it? These forcible-feeble reactionaries are much more
likely to explode a revolution that will disestablish us. And I
quite understand your theological difficulties--quite. The
creeds, if their entire symbolism is for a moment forgotten, if
they are taken as opaque statements of fact, are inconsistent,
incredible. So incredible that no one believes them; not even the
most devout. The utmost they do is to avert their minds--
reverentially. Credo quia impossibile. That is offensive to a
Western mind. I can quite understand the disposition to cry out
at such things, 'This is not the Church of God!'--to run out
from it--
<P>
"You have some dream, I suspect, of a dramatic dissidence.
<P>
"Now, my dear Brother and erstwhile pupil, I ask you not to do
this thing. Wait, I implore you. Give me--and some others, a
little time. I have your promise for three months, but even after
that, I ask you to wait. Let the reform come from within the
church. The church is something more than either its creeds, its
clergy, or its laymen. Look at your cathedral rising out of and
dominating Princhester. It stands not simply for Athanasius; it
stands but incidentally for Athanasius; it stands for all
religion. Within that fabric--let me be as frank here as in our
private conversation--doctrine has altered again and again.
To-day two distinct religions worship there side by side; one
that fades and one that grows brighter. There is the old
quasi-materialistic belief of the barbarians, the belief in such
things, for example, as that Christ the physical Son of God
descended into hell and stayed there, seeing the sights I suppose
like any tourist and being treated with diplomatic civilities for
three terrestrial days; and on the other hand there is the truly
spiritual belief that you and I share, which is absolutely
intolerant of such grotesque ideas. My argument to you is that
the new faith, the clearer vision, gains ground; that the only
thing that can prevent or delay the church from being altogether
possessed by what you call and I admit is, the true God, is that
such men as yourself, as the light breaks upon you, should be
hasty and leave the church. You see my point of view, do you not?
It is not one that has been assumed for our discussion; it is one
I came to long years ago, that I was already feeling my way to in
my St. Matthew's Lenton sermons.
<P>
"A word for your private ear. I am working. I cannot tell you
fully because I am not working alone. But there are movements
afoot in which I hope very shortly to be able to ask you to
share. That much at least I may say at this stage. Obscure but
very powerful influences are at work for the liberalizing of the
church, for release from many narrow limitations, for the
establishment of a modus vivendi with the nonconformist and
dissentient bodies in Britain and America, and with the churches
of the East. But of that no more now.
<P>
"And in conclusion, my dear Scrope, let me insist again upon
the eternal persistence of the essential Religious Fact:
<P>
<P>
            (Greek Letters Here)
<P>
(Rev. i. 18. "Fear not. I am the First and Last thing, the Living
thing.")
<P>
And these promises which, even if we are not to take them as
promises in the exact sense in which, let us say, the payment of
five sovereigns is promised by a five-pound note, are yet
assertions of practically inevitable veracity:
<P>
<P>
            (Greek Letters Here)
<P>
(Phil. i. 6. "He who began... will perfect."
 Eph. v. 14. "He will illuminate.")
<P>
<P>
The old man had written his Greek tags in shakily resolute
capitals. It was his custom always to quote the Greek Testament
in his letters, never the English version. It is a practice not
uncommon with the more scholarly of our bishops. It is as if some
eminent scientific man were to insist upon writing H20 instead of
"water," and "sodium chloride" instead of "table salt" in his
private correspondence. Or upon hanging up a stuffed crocodile in
his hall to give the place tone. The Bishop of Princhester
construed these brief dicta without serious exertion, he found
them very congenial texts, but there were insuperable
difficulties in the problem why Likeman should suppose they had
the slightest weight upon his side of their discussion. The more
he thought the less they seemed to be on Likeman's side, until at
last they began to take on a complexion entirely opposed to the
old man's insidious arguments, until indeed they began to bear
the extraordinary interpretation of a special message,
unwittingly delivered.
<P>
(8)
<P>
<P>
The bishop was still thinking over this communication when he
was interrupted by Lady Ella. She came with a letter in her hand
to ask him whether she might send five-and-twenty pounds to a
poor cousin of his, a teacher in a girls' school, who had been
incapacitated from work by a dislocation of the cartilage of her
knee. If she could go to that unorthodox but successful
practitioner, Mr. Barker, the bone-setter, she was convinced she
could be restored to efficiency. But she had no ready money. The
bishop agreed without hesitation. His only doubt was the
certainty of the cure, but upon that point Lady Ella was
convinced; there had been a great experience in the Walshingham
family.
<P>
"It is pleasant to be able to do things like this," said Lady
Ella, standing over him when this matter was settled.
<P>
"Yes," the bishop agreed; "it is pleasant to be in a position
to do things like this...."
