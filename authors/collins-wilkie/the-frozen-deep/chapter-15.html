At the drawing-room window of the villa there appeared a polite
little man, with bright intelligent eyes, and cheerful sociable
manners. Neatly dressed in professional black, he stood,
self-proclaimed, a prosperous country doctor--successful and
popular in a wide circle of patients and friends. As Mrs.
Crayford approached him, he stepped out briskly to meet her on
the lawn, with both hands extended in courteous and cordial
greeting.
<P>
"My dear madam, accept my heartfelt congratulations!" cried the
doctor. "I have seen the good news in the paper; and I could
hardly feel more rejoiced than I do now if I had the honor of
knowing Lieutenant Crayford personally. We mean to celebrate the
occasion at home. I said to my wife before I came out, 'A bottle
of the old Madeira at dinner to-day, mind!--to drink the
lieutenant's health; God bless him!' And how is our interesting
patient? The news is not altogether what we could wish, so far as
she is concerned. I felt a little anxious, to tell you the truth,
about the effect of it; and I have paid my visit to-day before my
usual time. Not that I take a gloomy view of the news myself. No!
There is clearly a doubt about the correctness of the
information, so far as Mr. Aldersley is concerned--and that is a
point, a great point in Mr. Aldersley's favor. I give him the
benefit of the doubt, as the lawyers say. Does Miss Burnham give
him the benefit of the doubt too? I hardly dare hope it, I
confess."
<P>
"Miss Burnham has grieved and alarmed me," Mrs. Crayford
answered. "I was just thinking of sending for you when we met
here."
<P>
With those introductory words, she told the doctor exactly what
had happened; repeating not only the conversation of that morning
between Clara and herself, but also the words which had fallen
from Clara, in the trance of the past night.
<P>
The doctor listened attentively. Little by little, its easy
smiling composure vanished from his face, as Mrs. Crayford went
on, and left him completely transformed into a grave and
thoughtful man.
<P>
"Let us go and look at her," he said.
<P>
He seated himself by Clara's side, and carefully studied her
face, with his hand on her pulse. There was no sympathy here
between the dreamy mystical temperament of the patient and the
downright practical character of the doctor. Clara secretly
disliked her medical attendant. She submitted impatiently to the
close investigation of which he made her the object. He
questioned her--and she answered irritably. Advancing a step
further (the doctor was not easily discouraged) he adverted to
the news of the Expedition, and took up the tone of remonstrance
which had been already adopted by Mrs. Crayford. Clara declined
to discuss the question. She rose with formal politeness, and
requested permission to return to the house. The doctor attempted
no further resistance. "By all means, Miss Burnham," he answered,
resignedly--having first cast a look at Mrs. Crayford which said
plainly, "Stay here with me." Clara bowed her acknowledgments in
co ld silence, and left them together. The doctor's bright eyes
followed the girl's wasted, yet still graceful figure as it
slowly receded from view, with an expression of grave anxiety
which Mrs. Crayford noticed with grave misgiving on her side. He
said nothing, until Clara had disappeared under the veranda which
ran round the garden-side of the house.
<P>
"I think you told me," he began, "that Miss Burnham has neither
father nor mother living?"
<P>
"Yes. Miss Burnham is an orphan."
<P>
"Has she any near relatives?"
<P>
"No. You may speak to me as her guardian and her friend. Are you
alarmed about her?"
<P>
"I am seriously alarmed. It is only two days since I called here
last, and I see a marked change in her for the worse--physically
and morally, a change for the worse. Don't needlessly alarm
yourself! The case is not, I trust, entirely beyond the reach of
remedy. The great hope for us is the hope that Mr. Aldersley may
still be living. In that event, I should feel no misgivings about
the future. Her marriage would make a healthy and a happy woman
of her. But as things are, I own I dread that settled conviction
in her mind that Mr. Aldersley is dead, and that her own death is
soon to follow. In her present state of health this idea
(haunting her as it certainly will night and day) will have its
influence on her body as well as on her mind. Unless we can check
the mischief, her last reserves of strength will give way. If you
wish for other advice, by all means send for it. You have my
opinion."
<P>
"I am quite satisfied with your opinion," Mrs. Crayford replied.
"For God's sake, tell me, what can we do?"
<P>
"We can try a complete change," said the doctor. "We can remove
her at once from this place."
<P>
"She will refuse to leave it," Mrs. Crayford rejoined. "I have
more than once proposed a change to her--and she always says No."
<P>
The doctor paused for a moment, like a man collecting his
thoughts.
<P>
"I heard something on my way here," he proceeded, "which suggests
to my mind a method of meeting the difficulty that you have just
mentioned. Unless I am entirely mistaken, Miss Burnham will not
say No to the change that I have in view for her."
<P>
"What is it?" asked Mrs. Crayford, eagerly.
<P>
"Pardon me if I ask you a question, on my part, before I reply,"
said the doctor. "Are you fortunate enough to possess any
interest at the Admiralty?"
<P>
"Certainly. My father is in the Secretary's office; and two of
the Lords of the Admiralty are friends of his."
<P>
"Excellent! Now I can speak out plainly with little fear of
disappointing you. After what I have said, you will agree with
me, that the only change in Miss Burnham's life which will be of
any use to her is a change that will alter the present tone of
her mind on the subject of Mr. Aldersley. Place her in a position
to discover--not by reference to her own distempered fancies and
visions, but by reference to actual evidence and actual
fact--whether Mr. Aldersley is, or is not, a living man; and
there will be an end of the hysterical delusions which now
threaten to fatally undermine her health. Even taking matters at
their worst--even assuming that Mr. Aldersley has died in the
Arctic seas--it will be less injurious to her to discover this
positively, than to leave her mind to feed on its own morbid
superstitions and speculations, for weeks and weeks together,
while the next news from the Expedition is on its way to England.
In one word, I want you to be in a position, before the week is
out, to put Miss Burnham's present conviction to a practical
test. Suppose you could say to her, 'We differ, my dear, about
Mr. Francis Aldersley. You declare, without the shadow of a
reason for it, that he is certainly dead, and, worse still, that
he has died by the act of one of his brother officers. I assert,
on the authority of the newspaper, that nothing of the sort has
happened, and that the chances are all in favor of his being
still a living man. What do you say to crossing the Atlantic, and
deciding which of us is right--you or I?' Do you think Miss
Burnham will say No to that, Mrs. Crayford? If I know anything of
human nature, she will seize the opportunity as a means of
converting you to a belief in the Second Sight."
<P>
"Good Heavens, doctor! do you mean to tell me that we are to go
to sea and meet the Arctic Expedition on its way home?"
<P>
"Admirably guessed, Mrs. Crayford! That is exactly what I mean."
<P>
"But how is it to be done?"
<P>
"I will tell you immediately. I mentioned--didn't I?--that I had
heard something on my road to this house."
<P>
"Yes "
<P>
"Well, I met an old friend at my own gate, who walked with me a
part of the way here. Last night my friend dined with the admiral
at Portsmouth. Among the guests there was a member of the
Ministry who had brought the news about the Expedition with him
from London. This gentleman told the company there was very
little doubt that the Admiralty would immediately send out a
steam-vessel, to meet the rescued men on the shores of America,
and bring them home. Wait a little, Mrs. Crayford! Nobody knows,
as yet, under what rules and regulations the vessel will sail.
Under somewhat similar circumstances, privileged people have been
received as passengers, or rather as guests, in her majesty's
ships--and what has been conceded on former occasions may, by
bare possibility, be conceded now. I can say no more. If you are
not afraid of the voyage for yourself, I am not afraid of it
(nay, I am all in favor of it on medical grounds) for my patient.
What do you say? Will you write to your father, and ask him to
try what his interest will do with his friends at the Admiralty?"
<P>
Mrs. Crayford rose excitedly to her feet.
<P>
"Write!" she exclaimed. "I will do better than write. The journey
to London is no great matter--and my housekeeper here is to be
trusted to take care of Clara in my absence. I will see my father
to-night! He shall make good use of his interest at the
Admiralty--you may rely on that. Oh, my dear doctor, what a
prospect it is! My husband! Clara! What a discovery you have
made--what a treasure you are! How can I thank you?"
<P>
"Compose yourself, my dear madam. Don't make too sure of success.
We may consider Miss Burnham's objections as disposed of
beforehand. But suppose the Lords of the Admiralty say No?"
<P>
"In that case, I shall be in London, doctor; and I shall go to
them myself. Lords are only men; and men are not in the habit of
saying No to me."
<P>
So they parted.
<P>
<P>
<P>
In a week from that day, her majesty's ship _Amazon_ sailed for
North America. Certain privileged persons, specially interested
in the Arctic voyagers, were permitted to occupy the empty
state-rooms on board. On the list of these favored guests of the
ship were the names of two ladies--Mrs. Crayford and Miss
Burnham.
