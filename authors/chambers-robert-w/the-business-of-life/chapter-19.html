<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Jacqueline had been half an hour late at her office and the routine
business was not yet quite finished when Captain Herrendene was
announced at the telephone.</p>

<p>"I thought you had sailed!" she exclaimed in surprise, as he
greeted her over the wire.</p>

<p>He laughed: "I'm ordered to Governor's Island. Jolly, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" she said cordially. "We shall see you sometimes, I suppose."</p>

<p>"I'm asked to the Lindley Hammertons for the week-end. Are you
to be at Silverwood by any happy chance?"</p>

<p>"Indeed we are. We are going up to-night."</p>

<p>"Good business!" he said. "And&mdash;may I wish you happiness, Mrs.
Desboro? Your husband is a perfectly bully fellow&mdash;lots of quality
in that young man&mdash;loads of reserve and driving force! Tell him
I congratulate him with all my heart. You know what I think of
<em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"It's very sweet of you to speak this way about us," she said.
"You may surmise what I think of my husband. So thank you for
wishing us happiness. And you will come over with Daisy, won't
you? We are going to be at home until Monday."</p>

<p>"Indeed I <em>will</em> come!" he said heartily.</p>

<p>She hung up the receiver, smiling but a trifle flushed; and in
her blue eyes there lingered something resembling tenderness as
she turned once more to the pile of typewritten letters awaiting
her signature. She had cared a great deal for this man's devotion;
and since she had refused him she cared for his friendship even
more than before. And, being feminine, capable, and very tender-hearted,
she already was experiencing the characteristic and ominous solicitude
of her sex for the future consolation and ultimate happiness of
this young and unmarried man. Might it not be accomplished through
Daisy Hammerton? What could be more suitable, more perfect?</p>

<p>Her sensitive lips were edged with a faint smile as she signed
her name to the first business letter. It began to look dark for
Captain Herrendene. No doubt, somewhere aloft, the cherubim were
already giggling. When a nice girl refuses a man, his business
with her has only just begun.</p>

<p>She continued to sign her letters, the ominous smile always hovering
on her upcurled lips. And, pursuing that train of thought, she
came, unwittingly, upon another, so impossible, yet so delightful
and exciting that every feminine fibre in her responded to the
invitation to meddle. She could scarcely wait to begin, so possessed
was she by the alluringly hopeless proposition evolved from her
inner consciousness; and, as soon as the last letter had been
signed, and her stenographer had taken away the correspondence,
she flew to the telephone and called up Cynthia Lessler.</p>

<p>"Is it you, dear?" she asked excitedly; and Cynthia, at the other
end of the wire, caught the happy ring in her voice, for she answered:</p>

<p>"You sound very gay this morning. <em>Are</em> you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, darling. Tell me, what are you doing over Sunday?"</p>

<p>Cynthia hesitated, then she answered calmly:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cairns is coming in the morning to take me to the Metropolitan
Museum."</p>

<p>"What a funny idea!"</p>

<p>"Why is it funny? He suggested that we go and look at the Chinese
porcelains so that we could listen more intelligently to you."</p>

<p>"As though I were accustomed to lecture my friends! How absurd,
Cynthia. You can't go. I want you at Silverwood."</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, but I've promised him&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Then come up on the noon train!"</p>

<p>"In the afternoon," explained Cynthia, still more calmly, "Mr.
Cairns and I are to read together a new play which has not yet
been put in rehearsal."</p>

<p>"But, darling! I do want you for Sunday! Why can't you come up
for this week-end, and postpone the Museum meanderings? Please
ask him to let you off."</p>

<p>There was a pause, then Cynthia said in a still, small voice:</p>

<p>"Mr. Cairns is here. You may ask him."</p>

<p>Cairns came to the telephone and said that he would consult the
wishes and the convenience of Miss Lessler.</p>

<p>There ensued another pause, ostensibly for consultation, during
which Jacqueline experienced a wicked and almost overwhelming
desire to laugh.</p>

<p>Presently Cynthia called her:</p>

<p>"<em>We</em> think," she said with pretty emphasis, "that it
would be very jolly to visit you. We can go to the museum any
other Sunday, Mr. Cairns says."</p>

<p>But the spirit of mischief still possessed Jacqueline, and she
refused to respond to the hint.</p>

<p>"So you are coming?" she exclaimed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"If you want <em>us</em>, darling."</p>

<p>"That's delightful! You know Jim and I haven't had a chance yet
to entertain our bridesmaid. We want her to be our very first
guest. Thank you so much, darling, for coming. And please say
to Mr. Cairns that it is perfectly dear of him to let you off&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But <em>he</em> is coming, too, isn't he?" exclaimed Cynthia
anxiously. "You are asking us both, aren't you. <em>What</em>
are you laughing at, you little wretch!"</p>

<p>But Jacqueline's laughter died out and she said hastily:</p>

<p>"Bring him with you, dear," and turned to confront Mrs. Hammerton,
who arrived by appointment and exactly on the minute.</p>

<p>The clerk who, under orders, had brought the old lady directly
to the office, retired, closing the door behind him. Jacqueline
hung up the telephone receiver, rose from her chair and gazed
silently at the woman whose letter to her had first shattered
her dream of happiness. Then, with a little gesture:</p>

<p>"Won't you please be seated?" she said quietly.</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah's face was grim as she sat down on the chair indicated.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'You have no further interest in me, have you?'"]</p>

<p>"You have no further interest in me, have you?" she demanded.</p>

<p>Jacqueline did not answer.</p>

<p>"I ought to have come here before," said Aunt Hannah. "I ought
to have come here immediately and explained to you that when I
wrote that letter I hadn't the vaguest notion that you were already
married. Do you think I'd have been such a fool if I'd known it,
Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>Jacqueline lifted her troubled eyes: "I do not think you should
have interfered at all."</p>

<p>"Good heavens! I know that! I knew it when I did it. It's the
one hopelessly idiotic act of my life. Never, <em>never</em> was
anything gained or anything altered by interfering where real
love is. I knew it, child. It's an axiom&mdash;a perfectly self-evident
proposition&mdash;an absolutely hopeless effort. But I chanced it.
Your mother, if she were alive, would have chanced it. Don't blame
me too much; be a little sorry for me. Because I loved you when
I did it. And many, many of the most terrible mistakes in life
are made because of love, Jacqueline. The mistakes of hate are
fewer."</p>

<p>Aunt Hannah's folded hands tightened on the gun-metal reticule
across her knees.</p>

<p>"It's too late to say I'm sorry," she said. "Besides, I'd do
it again."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I would. So would your mother. I <em>am</em> sorry; but
I <em>would</em> do it again! I love you enough to do it again&mdash;and&mdash;and
suffer what I <em>am</em> suffering in consequence."</p>

<p>Jacqueline looked at her in angry bewilderment, and the spark
in the little black eyes died out.</p>

<p>"Child," she said wearily, "we childless women who love are capable
of the same self-sacrifice that mothers understand. I wrote you
to save you, practically certain that I was giving you up by doing
it&mdash;and that with every word of warning I was signing my own death
warrant in your affections. But I <em>couldn't</em> sit still
and let you go to the altar unwarned. Had I cared less for you,
yes! I could have let you take your chances undisturbed by me.
But&mdash;you took them anyway&mdash;took them before my warning could do
anything except anger you. Otherwise, it would have hurt and angered
you, too. I have no illusions; what I said would have availed
nothing. Only&mdash;it was my duty to say it. I never was crazy about
doing my duty. But I did it this time."</p>

<p>She found a fresh handkerchief in her reticule and rolled it
nervously into a wad.</p>

<p>"So&mdash;that is all, Jacqueline. I've made a bad mess of it. I've
made a far worse one than I supposed possible. You are unhappy.
James is perfectly wretched. The boy came to me furious, bewildered,
almost exasperated, to find out what had been said about him and
who had said it. And&mdash;and I told him what I thought of him. I
<em>did</em>! And when he had gone, <em>I&mdash;</em>cried myself sick&mdash;<em>sick</em>,
I tell you.</p>

<p>"And that's why I'm here. It has given me courage to come here.
I know I am discredited; that what I say will be condemned in
advance; that you are too hurt, too hostile to me to be influenced.
But &mdash;I must say my say before I go out of your life&mdash;and
his&mdash;forever. And what I came to say to you is this. Forgive that
boy! Pardon absolutely everything he has done; eliminate it; annihilate
the memory of it if you can! Memory <em>can</em> be stunned, if
not destroyed. I know; I've had to do it often. So I say to you,
begin again with him. Give that boy his chance to grow up to your
stature. In all the world I believe you are the only woman who
can ennoble him and make of him something fine&mdash;if not your peer,
at least its masculine equivalent. I do not mean to be bitter.
But I cannot help my opinion of things masculine. Forgive him,
Jacqueline. Many men are better than he; many, many are worse.
But the best among them are not so very much better than your
boy Jim. Forgive him and help him to grow up. And&mdash;that is all
&mdash;I think&#11834;"</p>

<p>She rose and turned sharply away. Jacqueline rose and crossed
the room to open the door for her. They met there. Aunt Hannah's
ugly little face remained averted while she waited for the open
door to free her.</p>

<p>"Mr. Desboro and I are going to be happy," said Jacqueline in
a strained voice.</p>

<p>"It lies with you," snapped Aunt Hannah.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;a great deal seems to lie with me. The burden of decision
seems to lie with me very often. Somehow I can't escape it. And
I am not wise, not experienced enough&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You are <em>good</em>. That's wisdom enough for decision."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;do you know &mdash;I am <em>not</em> very good."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because I understand much that is evil. How can real innocence
be so unworthily wise?"</p>

<p>"Innocence isn't goodness by a long shot!" said Aunt Hannah bluntly.
"The good <em>know</em>&mdash;and refrain."</p>

<p>There was a silence; the elder woman in her black gown stood
waiting, her head still obstinately averted. Suddenly she felt
the girl's soft arms around her neck, quivered, caught her in
a fierce embrace.</p>

<p>"I &mdash;I want you to care for Jim," faltered the girl. "I
want you to know what he really is&mdash;the dearest and most generous
of men. I want you to discover the real nobility in him. He <em>is</em>
only a boy, as yet, Aunt Hannah. And he&mdash;he must not be&mdash;cruelly&mdash;punished."</p>

<p>When Aunt Hannah had marched out, still inclined to dab at her
eyes, but deeply and thankfully happy, Jacqueline called up her
husband at his office.</p>

<p>"Jim, dear," she said, "I have had a visit from Aunt Hannah.
And she's terribly unhappy because she thinks you and I are; so
I told her that we are not unhappy, and I scolded her for saying
those outrageous things to you. And she took it so meekly, and&mdash;and
she does really care for us&mdash;and&mdash;and I've made up with her. Was
it disloyal to you to forgive her?"</p>

<p>"No," he said quietly. "What she said to me was the truth."</p>

<p>"I don't know what she said to you, dear. She didn't tell me.
But I gathered from her that it was something intensely disagreeable.
So don't ever tell me&mdash;because I might begin to dislike her again.
And&mdash;it wasn't true, anyway. She knows that now. So&mdash;we will be
friendly to her, won't we?"</p>

<p>"Of course. She adores you anyway&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If she doesn't adore you, too, I won't care for her!" said the
girl hotly.</p>

<p>He laughed; she could hear him distinctly; and she realised with
a little thrill that it was the same engaging laugh which she
had first associated with the delightful, graceful, charming young
fellow who was now her husband.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Jim?" she asked, smiling in sympathy.</p>

<p>"There's absolutely nothing doing in the office, dear."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;could you come over here?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Jacqueline! Do <em>you</em> tempt me?"</p>

<p>"No," she said hastily. "I suppose you ought to be there in the
office, whether there's anything to do or not. Listen, Jim. I've
invited Cynthia and Jack Cairns for the week-end. Was it all right?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"You don't really mind, do you?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit, dear."</p>

<p>"We can be by ourselves if we wish. They're going to read a play
together," she explained naïvely, "and they won't bother us&#11834;"</p>

<p>She checked herself, blushing furiously. He, at his end of the
wire, could scarcely speak for the quick tumult of his heart,
but he managed to say calmly enough:</p>

<p>"We've got the entire estate to roam over if they bore us."</p>

<p>"Will you take me for a walk on Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if you would care to go."</p>

<p>"Haven't I invited you to take me?"</p>

<p>"Have you really, Jacqueline?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good-bye. I will be waiting for you at five."</p>

<p>She returned to her desk, the flush slowly cooling in her cheeks;
and she was just resuming her seat when a clerk brought Clydesdale's
card.</p>

<p>"I could see Mr. Clydesdale now," she said, glancing over the
appointment list on her desk. Her smile had died out with the
colour in her cheeks, and her beautiful eyes grew serious and
stern. For the name that this man bore was associated in her mind
with terrible and unspeakable things. Never again could she hear
that name with equanimity; never recall it unmoved. Yet, now,
she made an effort to put from her all that menaced her composure
at the mere mention of that name&mdash;strove to think only of the
client and kindly amateur who had treated her always with unvarying
courtesy and consideration.</p>

<p>He came in grinning, as usual, and she took his extended and
highly-coloured paw, smiling her greeting.</p>

<p>"Is it a little social visit, Mr. Clydesdale, or have you discovered
some miracle of ancient Cathay which you covet?"</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;my wife."</p>

<p>Her smile fled and her features altered to an expressionless
and colourless mask. For a second there was a gleam of fear in
her eyes, then they grew cold and clear and blue as arctic ice.</p>

<p>He remained standing, the grin stamped on his sanguine features.
Presently he said, heavily:</p>

<p>"I have come to you to make what reparation I can&mdash;in my wife's
name&mdash;in her behalf. Our deep humiliation, deeper contrition,
are the only reparation we can offer you. It is hard for me to
speak. My wife is at home, ill. And she can not rest until she
has told you, through me, that&mdash;that what she said to you the
last time she saw you&mdash;here, in this office&mdash;was an untruth."</p>

<p>Jacqueline, dazed, merely stared at him. He bent his head and
seemed to be searching in his mind for words. He found them after
a while.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said in a low voice, "what my wife said, and what she
permitted you to infer&mdash;concerning herself and &mdash;Mr. Desboro&mdash;was
utterly untrue. God alone knows why she said it. But she did.
I could plead extenuation for her&mdash;if your patience permits. She
is naturally very nervous; she <em>did</em> care a great deal
for Mr. Desboro; she did, at that time, really dislike me," he
added with a quiet dignity which made every word he uttered ring
out clear as a shot. And Jacqueline seemed to feel their impact
on her very heart.</p>

<p>He said: "There are other circumstances&mdash;painful ones. She had
been for months&mdash;even years&mdash;in fear of blackmail&mdash;terrorised
by it until she became morbid. I did not know this. I was not
aware that an indiscreet but wholly innocent escapade of her youth
had furnished this blackmailer with a weapon. I understand now,
why, caring as she did for Mr. Desboro, and excited, harassed,
terrified, exasperated, she was willing to make an end of it with
him rather than face possible disgrace with me for whom she did
not care. It is no excuse. She offers none. I offer none for her.
Nothing&mdash;no mental, no physical state could excuse what she has
done. Only &mdash;I wish&mdash;and she wishes you to know that she
has been guilty of permitting you to believe a monstrous untruth
which would have consigned her to infamy had it been true, and
absolutely damned the man you have married."</p>

<p>She strove to comprehend this thing that he was saying&mdash;tried
to realise that he was absolutely clearing her husband of the
terrible and nameless shadow which, she knew now, never could
have entirely fled away, except for the mercy of God and the words
of humiliation now sounding in her ears.</p>

<p>She stared at him. And the terrible thing was that he was grinning
still&mdash;grinning through all the agony of his shame and dreadful
abasement. And she longed to turn away&mdash;to shut out his face from
her sight. But dared not.</p>

<p>"That is all," he said heavily. "Perhaps there is a little more
to say&mdash;but it will leave you indifferent, very naturally. Yet,
may I say that this&mdash;this heart-breaking crisis in her life, and&mdash;in
mine&mdash;has&mdash;brought us together? And&mdash;a little more. My wife is
to become a mother. Which is why I venture to hope that you will
be merciful to us both in your thoughts. I do not ask for your
pardon, which you could never give&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Clydesdale!" She had risen, trembling, both little hands
flat on the desk top to steady her, and was looking straight at
him.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'I &mdash;I have never thought mercilessly'"]</p>

<p>"<em>I&mdash;</em>my thoughts&#11834;" she stammered "are not cruel. Say
so to your wife. I &mdash;I have never thought mercilessly. Every
instinct within me is otherwise. And I know what suffering is.
And I do not wish it for anybody. Say so to your wife, and that
I wish her&mdash;happiness&mdash;with her baby."</p>

<p>She was trembling so that he could scarcely control between his
two huge fists the little hand that he saluted in wordless gratitude
and grief.</p>

<p>Then, without looking at her again, or speaking, he went his
way. And she dropped back into her chair, the tears of sheer happiness
and excitement flowing unchecked.</p>

<p>But she was permitted no time to collect her thoughts, no solitude
for happy tears, and, at the clerk's sharp knocking, she dried
her eyes hastily and bade him enter.</p>

<p>The card he laid on her desk seemed to amaze her.</p>

<p>"<em>That</em> man!" she said slowly. "Is he <em>here</em>, Mr.
Mirk?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam. He asks for one minute only, saying that it is a
matter of most desperate importance to you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"To <em>me</em>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>Again she looked at Mr. Waudle's card.</p>

<p>"Bring him," she said crisply. And the blue lightning flashed
in her eyes.</p>

<p>When Mr. Waudle came in and the clerk had gone and closed the
door, Jacqueline said quietly:</p>

<p>"I'll give you one minute, Mr. Waudle. Proceed."</p>

<p>"I think," he said, looking at her out of his inflamed eyes,
"that you'll feel inclined to give me more than that when you
understand what I've got in this packet." And he drew from his
overcoat pocket a roll of galley proofs.</p>

<p>"What is it?" she asked, looking calmly into his dangerous red
eyes.</p>

<p>"It's a story, set up and in type&mdash;as you see. And it's about
your husband and Mrs. Clydesdale&mdash;if you want to know."</p>

<p>A shaft of fear struck straight through her. Then, in an instant
the blanched cheeks flushed and the blue eyes cleared and sparkled.</p>

<p>"What is it you wish?" she asked in a curiously still voice.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you; don't worry. I want you to stop this man Clydesdale,
and stop him short. I don't care how you do it; <em>do</em> it,
that's all. He's bought and paid for certain goods delivered to
him by me. Now he's squealing. He wants his money back. And&mdash;if
he gets it back this story goes in. Want me to read it to you?"</p>

<p>"No. What is it you wish me to do&mdash;deceive Mr. Clydesdale? Make
him believe that the remainder of the jades and rose-quartz carvings
are genuine?"</p>

<p>"It looks good to me," said Mr. Waudle more cheerfully. "It sounds
all right. You threw us down; it's up to you to pick us up."</p>

<p>"I see," she said pleasantly. "And unless I do you are intending
to publish that&mdash;story?"</p>

<p>"Sure as hell!" he nodded.</p>

<p>She remained silent and thoughtful so long that he began to hitch
about in his chair and cast furtive, sidelong glances at her and
at the curtained walls around the room. Suddenly his face grew
ghastly.</p>

<p>"Look here!" he whispered hoarsely. "Is this a plant?"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Is there anybody else in this room?" He lurched to his feet
and waddled hastily around the four walls, flinging aside the
green velvet curtains. Only the concealed pictures were revealed;
and he went back to his chair, removing the cold sweat from his
forehead and face with his sleeve.</p>

<p>"By God!" he said. "For a moment I thought you had done me good
and plenty. But it wouldn't have helped <em>you</em>! They've
got this story in the office, and the minute I'm pinched, in it
goes! Understand?"</p>

<p>"No," she said serenely, "but it doesn't really matter. You may
go now, Mr. Waudle."</p>

<p>"Hey?"</p>

<p>"Must I ring for a clerk to put you out?"</p>

<p>"Oh! So that's the game, is it? Well, I tell you that you can't
bluff me, little lady! Let's settle it now."</p>

<p>"No," she said. "I must have time to consider."</p>

<p>"How long?"</p>

<p>"An hour or two."</p>

<p>"You'll make up your mind in two hours?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right," he said, almost jovially. "That suits me. Call me
up on the 'phone and tell me what you decide. My number is on
my card."</p>

<p>She looked at the card. It bore his telephone number and his
house address.</p>

<p>He seemed inclined to linger, evidently with the idea of tightening
his grip on her by either persuasion or bullying, as her attitude
might warrant. But she touched the bell and Mr. Mirk appeared;
and the author of "Black Roses" took himself off perforce, with
many a knowing leer, both threatening and blandishing.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone, she called up her husband. Very quietly,
but guardedly, she conversed with him for a few moments.</p>

<p>When she hung up the receiver she was laughing. But it was otherwise
with Desboro.</p>

<p>"Cairns," he said, turning from the telephone to his associate,
"there's a silly fellow bothering my wife. If you don't mind my
leaving the office for a few minutes I'll step around and speak
to him." His usually agreeable features had grown colourless and
ugly, but his voice sounded casual enough.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Jim? Murder?"</p>

<p>Desboro laughed.</p>

<p>"I'll be gone only a few minutes," he said.</p>

<p>"It <em>could</em> be done in a few minutes," mused Cairns. "Do
you want me to go with you?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks." He picked up his hat, nodded curtly, and went out.</p>

<p>Mr. Waudle and Mr. Munger maintained a "den," literary and otherwise,
in one of the new studio buildings just east of Lexington Avenue.
This was the address Mr. Waudle had left for Jacqueline; to this
destination Desboro now addressed himself. Thither an itinerant
taxicab bore him on shaky springs. He paid the predatory chauffeur,
turned to enter the building, and met Clydesdale face to face,
entering the same doorway.</p>

<p>"Hello!" said the latter with a cheerful grin. "Where are you
bound?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's a man hereabouts with whom I have a few moments'
business."</p>

<p>"Same here," observed Clydesdale.</p>

<p>They entered the building together, and both walked straight
through to the elevator.</p>

<p>"Mr. Waudle," said Clydesdale briefly to the youth in charge.
"You need not announce me."</p>

<p>Desboro looked at him curiously, and caught Clydesdale's eyes
furtively measuring him.</p>

<p>"Odd," he said pleasantly, "but my business is with the same
man."</p>

<p>"I was wondering."</p>

<p>They exchanged perfectly inexpressive glances.</p>

<p>"Couldn't your business wait?" inquired Desboro politely.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Desboro, but I was a little ahead of you in the entry,
I think."</p>

<p>The car stopped.</p>

<p>"Studio twenty," said the boy; slammed the gates, and shot down
into dimly lighted depths again, leaving the two men together.</p>

<p>"I am wondering," mused Clydesdale gently, "whether by any chance
your business with this&mdash;ah &mdash;Mr. Waudle resembles my business
with him."</p>

<p>They looked at each other.</p>

<p>Desboro nodded: "Very probably," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh! Then perhaps you might care to be present at the business
meeting," said Clydesdale, "as a spectator, merely, of course."</p>

<p>"Thanks, awfully. But might I not persuade <em>you</em> to remain
as a spectator&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Very good of you, Desboro, but I need the&mdash;ah&mdash;exercise. Really,
I've gone quite stale this winter. Don't even keep up my squash."</p>

<p>"Mistake," said Desboro gravely. "'Fraid you'll overdo it, old
chap."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll have a shy at it," said Clydesdale cheerfully. "Very
glad to have you score, if you like."</p>

<p>"If you insist," replied the younger man courteously.</p>

<p>There was a bell outside Studio No. 20. Desboro punched it with
the ferrule of his walking stick; and when the door opened, somewhat
cautiously, Clydesdale inserted his huge foot between the door
and the sill.</p>

<p>There was a brief and frantic scuffle; then the poet fled, his
bunch of frizzled hair on end, and the two men entered the apartment.</p>

<p>To the left a big studio loomed, set with artistic furniture
and bric-a-brac and Mr. Waudle&mdash;the latter in motion. In fact,
he was at that moment in the process of rushing at Mr. Clydesdale,
and under full head-way.</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Waudle finally obtained sufficient momentum to rush,
he appeared to be a rather serious proposition; for he was as
tall as Clydesdale and very much fatter, and his initial velocity,
combined with his impact force per square inch might have rivalled
the dynamic problems of the proving ground.</p>

<p>Clydesdale took one step forward to welcome him, and Waudle went
down, like thunder.</p>

<p>Then he got up, went down immediately; got up, went down, stayed
down for an appreciable moment; arose, smote the air, was smitten
with a smack so terrific that the poet, who was running round
and round the four walls, squeaked in sympathy.</p>

<p>Waudle sat up on the floor, his features now an unrecognisable
mess. He was crying.</p>

<p>"I say, Desboro, catch that poet for me&mdash;there's a good chap,"
said Clydesdale, breathing rather hard.</p>

<p>The Cubist, who had been running round and round like a frantic
rabbit, screamed and ran the faster.</p>

<p>"Oh, just shy some bric-a-brac at him and come home," said Desboro
in disgust.</p>

<p>But Clydesdale caught him, seated himself, jerked the devotee
of the moon across his ponderous knees, and, grinning, hoisted
on high the heavy hand of justice. And the post-impressionistic
literature of the future shrieked.</p>

<p>"Very precious, isn't it?" panted Clydesdale. "You dirty little
mop of hair, I think I'll spank <em>you</em> into the future.
Want a try at this moon-pup, Desboro? No? Quite right; you don't
need the exercise. Whew!" And he rolled the writhing poet off
his knees and onto the floor, sat up breathing hard and grinning
around him.</p>

<p>"Now for the club and a cold plunge&mdash;eh, Desboro? I tell you
it puts life into a man, doesn't it? Perhaps, while I'm about
it, I might as well beat up the other one a little more&#11834;"</p>

<p>"My God!" blubbered Waudle.</p>

<p>"Oh, very well&mdash;if you feel that way about it," grinned Clydesdale.
"But you understand that you won't have any sensation to feel
with at all if you ever again even think of the name of Mrs. Clydesdale."</p>

<p>He got up, still panting jovially, pleased as a great Dane puppy
who has shaken an old shoe to fragments.</p>

<p>At the door he paused and glanced back.</p>

<p>"Take it from me," he said genially, "if we ever come back, we'll
kill."</p>

<p>In the street once more, they lingered on the sidewalk for a
moment or two before separating. Clydesdale drew off his split
and ruined gloves, rolled them together and tossed them into the
passing handcart of a street sweeper.</p>

<p>"Unpleasant job," he commented.</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll have it to do over again," smiled Desboro.</p>

<p>"No, I think not. And thank you for yielding so gracefully to
me. It was my job. But you didn't miss anything; it was like hitting
a feather bed. No sport in it&mdash;but had to be done. Well, glad
to have seen you again, Desboro."</p>

<p>They exchanged grips; both flushed a trifle, hesitated, nodded
pleasantly to each other, and separated.</p>

<p>At the office Cairns inspected him curiously as he entered, but,
as Desboro said nothing, he asked no questions. A client or two
sauntered in and out. At one o'clock they lunched together.</p>

<p>"I understand you're coming up for the week-end," said Desboro.</p>

<p>"Your wife was good enough to ask me."</p>

<p>"Glad you're coming. Old Herrendene has been ordered to Governor's
Island. He expects to stop with the Lindley Hammertons over Sunday."</p>

<p>"That Daisy girl's a corker," remarked Cairns, "&mdash;only I've always
been rather afraid of her."</p>

<p>"She's a fine girl."</p>

<p>"Rather in Herrendene's class&mdash;lots of character," nodded Cairns
thoughtfully. "Having none myself, she always had me backed up
against the rail."</p>

<p>After a silence, Desboro said: "That was a ghastly break of mine
last night."</p>

<p>"Rotten," said Cairns bluntly.</p>

<p>The painful colour rose to Desboro's temples.</p>

<p>"It will be the last, Jack. I lived a thousand years last night."</p>

<p>"I lived a few hundred myself," said Cairns reproachfully. "And
<em>what</em> a thoroughbred your wife is!"</p>

<p>Desboro nodded and drew a deep, unsteady breath.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a few moments, "it is a terrible thing
for a man to learn what he really is. But if he doesn't learn
it he's lost."</p>

<p>Cairns assented with a jerk of his head.</p>

<p>"But who's to hold up the mirror to a man?" he asked. "When his
father and mother shove it under his nose he won't look; when
clergy or laymen offer him a looking-glass he shuts his eyes and
tries to kick them. That's the modern youngster&mdash;the product of
this modern town with its modern modes of thought."</p>

<p>"The old order of things was the best," said Desboro. "Has anybody
given us anything better than what they reasoned us into discarding&mdash;the
old gentleness of manners, the quaint, stiff formalisms now out
of date, the shyness and reticence of former days, the serenity,
the faith which is now unfashionable, the old-time reverence?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Cairns, "what we've gained in the discard.
I look now at the cards they offer us to take up, and there is
nothing on them. And the game has forced us to throw away what
we had." He caressed his chin thoughtfully. "The only way to do
is to return to first principles, cut a fresh pack, never mind
new rules and innovations, but play the game according to the
decalogue. And nobody can call you down." He reddened, and added
honestly: "That's not entirely my own, Jim. There are some similar
lines in a new play which Miss Lessler and I were reading this
morning."</p>

<p>"Reading? Where?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we walked through the Park together rather early&mdash;took it
easy, you know. She read aloud as we walked."</p>

<p>"She is coming for the week-end," said Desboro.</p>

<p>"I believe so."</p>

<p>Desboro, lighting a cigarette, permitted his very expressionless
glance to rest on his friend for the briefest fraction of a second.</p>

<p>"The papers," he said, "speak of her work with respect."</p>

<p>"Miss Lessler," said Cairns, "is a most unusual girl."</p>

<p>Neither men referred to the early days of their acquaintance
with Cynthia Lessler. As though by tacit agreement those days
seemed to have been entirely forgotten.</p>

<p>"A rarely intelligent and lovely comedienne," mused Cairns, poking
the cigar ashes on the tray and finally laying aside his cigar.
"Well, Jim, I suppose the office yawns for us. But it won't have
anything on my yawn when I get there!"</p>

<p>They went back across Fifth Avenue in the brilliant afternoon
sunshine, to dawdle about the office and fuss away the afternoon
in pretense that the awakening of the Street from its long lethargy
was imminent.</p>

<p>At half past three Cairns took himself off, leaving Desboro studying
the sunshine on the ceiling. At five the latter awoke from his
day dream, stood up, shook himself, drew a deep breath, and straightened
his shoulders. Before him, now delicately blurred and charmingly
indistinct, still floated the vision of his day-dream; and, with
a slight effort, he could still visualise, as he moved out into
the city and through its noise and glitter, south, into that quieter
street where his day-dream's vision lived and moved and had her
earthly being.</p>

<p>Mr. Mirk came smiling and bowing from the dim interior. There
was no particular reason for the demonstration, but Desboro shook
his hand cordially.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Desboro is in her office," said Mr. Mirk. "You know the
way, sir&mdash;if you please&#11834;"</p>

<p>He knew the way. It was not likely that he would ever forget
the path that he had followed that winter day.</p>

<p>At his knock she opened the door herself.</p>

<p>"I don't know how I knew it was your knock," she said, giving
ground as he entered. There was an expression in his face that
made her own brighten, as though perhaps she had not been entirely
certain in what humour he might arrive.</p>

<p>"The car will be here in a few minutes," he said. "That's a tremendously
pretty hat of yours."</p>

<p>"Do you like it? I saw it the other day. And somehow I felt extravagant
this afternoon and telephoned for it. Do you really like it, Jim?"</p>

<p>"It's a beauty."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad&mdash;so relieved. Sometimes I catch you looking at me,
Jim, and I wonder how critical you really are. I <em>want</em>
you to like what I wear. You'll always tell me when you don't,
won't you?"</p>

<p>"No fear of my not agreeing with your taste," he said cheerfully.
"By the way&mdash;and apropos of nothing &mdash;Waudle won't bother
you any more."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I believe Clydesdale interviewed him&mdash;and the other one&mdash;the
poet." He laughed. "Afterward there was not enough remaining for
me to interview."</p>

<p>Jacqueline's serious eyes, intensely blue, were lifted to his.</p>

<p>"We won't speak of them again, ever," she said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Right, as always," he rejoined gaily.</p>

<p>She still stood looking at him out of grave and beautiful eyes,
which seemed strangely shy and tender to him. Then, slowly shaking
her head she said, half to herself:</p>

<p>"I have much to answer for&mdash;more than you must ever know. But
I shall answer for it; never fear."</p>

<p>"What are you murmuring there all by yourself, Jacqueline?" he
said smilingly; and ventured to take her gloved hand into his.
She, too, smiled, faintly, and stood silent, pretty head bent,
absorbed in her own thoughts.</p>

<p>A moment later a clerk tapped and announced their car. She looked
up at her husband, and the confused colour in her face responded
to the quick pressure of his hands.</p>

<p>"Are you quite ready to go?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;ready always&mdash;to go where&mdash;you lead."</p>

<p>Her flushed face reflected the emotion in his as they went out
together into the last rays of the setting sun.</p>

<p>"Have we time to motor to Silverwood?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Would you care to?"</p>

<p>"I'd love to."</p>

<p>So he spoke to the chauffeur and entered the car after her.</p>

<p>It was a strange journey for them both, with the memory of their
last journey together still so fresh, so pitilessly clear, in
their minds. In this car, over this road, beside this man, she
had travelled with a breaking heart and a mind haunted by horror
unspeakable.</p>

<p>To him the memory of that journey was no less terrible. They
spoke to each other tranquilly but seriously, and in voices unconsciously
lowered. And there were many lapses into stillness&mdash;many long
intervals of silence. But during the longest of these, when the
Westchester hills loomed duskily ahead, she slipped her hand into
his and left it there until the lights of Silverwood glimmered
low on the hill and the gate lanterns flashed in their eyes as
the car swung into the fir-bordered drive and rolled up to the
house.</p>

<p>"Home," she said, partly to herself; and he turned toward her
in quick gratitude.</p>

<p>Once more the threatened emotion confused her, but she evaded
it, forcing a gaiety not in accord with her mood, as he aided
her to descend.</p>

<p>"Certainly it's my home, monsieur, as well as yours," she repeated,
"and you'll feel the steel under the velvet hand of femininity
as soon as I assume the reins of government. For example, you
can <em>not</em> entertain your cats and dogs in the red drawing-room
any more. Now do you feel the steel?"</p>

<p>They went to their sitting-room laughing.</p>

<p>About midnight she rose from the sofa. They had been discussing
plans for the future, repairs, alterations, improvements for Silverwood
House&mdash;and how to do many, many wonderful things at vast expense;
and how to practice rigid economy and do nothing at all.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And, as she rose, he was still figuring"]</p>

<p>It had been agreed that he was to give up his rooms in town and
use hers whenever they remained in New York over night. And, as
she rose, he was still figuring out, with pencil and pad, how
much they would save by this arrangement. Now he looked up, saw
her standing, and rose too.</p>

<p>She looked at him with sweet, sleepy, humourous eyes.</p>

<p>"Isn't it disgraceful and absurd?" she said. "But if I don't
have my sleep I simply become stupid and dreary and useless beyond
words."</p>

<p>"Why did you let me keep you up?" he said gently.</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to stay up with you," she said. She had moved
to the centre table where the white carnations, as usual, filled
the bowl. Her slender hand touched them caressingly, lingered,
and presently detached a blossom.</p>

<p>She lifted it dreamily, inhaling the fragrance and looking over
its scented chalice at him.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Jim," she said.</p>

<p>"Good-night, dearest." He came over to her, hesitated, reddening;
then bent and kissed her hand and the white flower it held.</p>

<p>At her own door she lingered, turning to look after him as he
crossed his threshold; then slowly entered her room, her lips
resting on the blossom which he had kissed.</p>
