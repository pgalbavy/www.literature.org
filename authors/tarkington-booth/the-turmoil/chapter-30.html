<p>Sibyl and Roscoe were upon the point of leaving when Bibbs returned
to the New House. He went straight to Sibyl and spoke to her quietly,
but so that the others might hear.</p>

<p>"When you said that if I'd stop to think, I'd realize that no
one would be apt to care enough about me to marry me, you were
right," he said. "I thought perhaps you weren't, and so I asked
Miss Vertrees to marry me. It proved what you said of me, and
disproved what you said of her. She refused."</p>

<p>And, having thus spoken, he quitted the room as straightforwardly
as he had entered it.</p>

<p>"He's SO queer!" Mrs. Sheridan gasped. "Who on earth would thought
of his doin' <em>THAT</em>?"</p>

<p>"I told you," said her husband, grimly.</p>

<p>"You didn't tell us he'd go over there and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you she wouldn't have him. I told you she wouldn't have
<em>JIM, </em>didn't I?"</p>

<p>Sibyl was altogether taken aback. "Do you supose it's true? Do
you suppose she <em>WOULDN'T</em>?"</p>

<p>"He didn't look exactly like a young man that had just got things
fixed up fine with his girl," said Sheridan. "Not to me, he didn't!"</p>

<p>"But why would&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I told you," he interrupted, angrily, "she ain't that kind of
a girl! If you got to have proof, well, I'll tell you and get
it over with, though I'd pretty near just as soon not have to
talk a whole lot about my dead boy's private affairs. She wrote
to Jim she couldn't take him, and it was a good, straight letter,
too. It came to Jim's office; he never saw it. She wrote it the
afternoon he was hurt."</p>

<p>"I remember I saw her put a letter in the mail-box that afternoon,"
said Roscoe. "Don't you remember, Sibyl? I told you about it &mdash;I
was waiting for you while you were in there so long talking to
her mother. It was just before we saw that something was wrong
over here, and Edith came and called me."</p>

<p>Sibyl shook her head, but she remembered. And she was not cast
down, for, although some remnants of perplexity were left in her
eyes, they were dimmed by an increasing glow of triumph; and she
departed&mdash;after some further fragmentary discourse&mdash;visibly elated.
After all, the guilty had not been exalted; and she perceived
vaguely, but none the less surely, that her injury had been copiously
avenged. She bestowed a contented glance upon the old house with
the cupola, as she and Roscoe crossed the street.</p>

<p>When they had gone, Mrs. Sheridan indulged in reverie, but after
a while she said, uneasily, "Papa, you think it would be any use
to tell Bibbs about that letter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered, walking moodily to the window. "I
been thinkin' about it." He came to a decision. "I reckon I will."
And he went up to Bibbs's room.</p>

<p>"Well, you goin' back on what you said?" he inquired, brusquely,
as he opened the door. "You goin' to take it back and lay down
on me again?"</p>

<p>"No," said Bibbs.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I didn't have any call to accuse you of that.
I don't know as you ever did go back on anything you said, exactly,
though the Lord knows you've laid down on me enough. You certainly
have!" Sheridan was baffled. This was not what he wished to say,
but his words were unmanageable; he found himself unable to control
them, and his querulous abuse went on in spite of him. "I can't
say I expect much of you&mdash;not from the way you always been, up
to now&mdash;unless you turn over a new leaf, and I don't see any encouragement
to think you're goin' to do <em>THAT! </em>If you go down there
and show a spark o' real <em>GIT-</em>up, I reckon the whole office'll
fall in a faint. But if you're ever goin' to show any, you better
begin right at the beginning and begin to show it to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Yes &mdash;I'll try."</p>

<p>"You better, if it's in you!" Sheridan was sheerly nonplussed.
He had always been able to say whatever he wished to say, but
his tongue seemed bewitched. He had come to tell Bibbs about Mary's
letter, and to his own angry astonishment he found it impossible
to do anything except to scold like a drudge-driver. "You better
come down there with your mind made up to hustle harder than the
hardest workin'-man that's under you, or you'll not get on very
good with me, I tell you! The way to get ahead&mdash;and you better
set it down in your books&mdash;the way to get ahead is to do ten times
the work of the hardest worker that works <em>FOR </em>you. But
you don't know what work is, yet. All you've ever done was just
stand around and feed a machine a child could handle, and then
come home and take a bath and go callin'. I tell you you're up
against a mighty different proposition now, and if you're worth
your salt&mdash;and you never showed any signs of it yet&mdash;not any signs
that stuck out enough to bang somebody on the head and make 'em
sit up and take notice&mdash;well, I want to say, right here and now&mdash;and
you better listen, because I want to say just what I DO say. I
say&mdash;"</p>

<p>He meandered to a full stop. His mouth hung open, and his mind
was a hopeless blank.</p>

<p>Bibbs looked up patiently&mdash;an old, old look. "Yes, father; I'm
listening."</p>

<p>"That's all," said Sheridan, frowning heavily. "That's all I
came to say, and you better see't you remember it!"</p>

<p>He shook his head warningly, and went out, closing the door behind
him with a crash. However, no sound of footsteps indicated his
departure. He stopped just outside the door, and stood there a
minute or more. Then abruptly he turned the knob and exhibited
to his son a forehead liberally covered with perspiration.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said, crossly. "That girl over yonder wrote Jim
a letter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know," said Bibbs. "She told me."</p>

<p>"Well, I thought you needn't feel so much upset about it&mdash;" The
door closed on his voice as he withdrew, but the conclusion of
the sentence was nevertheless audible&mdash;"if you knew she wouldn't
have Jim, either."</p>

<p>And he stamped his way down-stairs to tell his wife to quit her
frettin' and not bother him with any more fool's errands. She
was about to inquire what Bibbs "said," but after a second thought
she decided not to speak at all. She merely murmured a wordless
assent, and verbal communication was given over between them for
the rest of that afternoon.</p>

<p>Bibbs and his father were gone when Mrs. Sheridan woke, the next
morning, and she had a dreary day. She missed Edith woefully,
and she worried about what might be taking place in the Sheridan
Building. She felt that everything depended on how Bibbs "took
hold," and upon her husband's return in the evening she seized
upon the first opportunity to ask him how things had gone. He
was non-committal. What could anybody tell by the first day? He'd
seen plenty go at things well enough right at the start and then
blow up. Pretty near anybody could show up fair the first day
or so. There was a big job ahead. This material, such as it was
&mdash;Bibbs, in fact&mdash;had to be broken in to handling the work
Roscoe had done; and then, at least as an overseer, he must take
Jim's position in the Realty Company as well. He told her to ask
him again in a month.</p>

<p>But during the course of dinner she gathered from some disjointed
remarks of his that he and Bibbs had lunched together at the small
restaurant where it had been Sheridan's custom to lunch with Jim,
and she took this to be an encouraging sign. Bibbs went to his
room as soon as they left the table, and her husband was not communicative
after reading his paper.</p>

<p>She became an anxious spectator of Bibbs's progress as a man
of business, although it was a progress she could glimpse but
dimly and only in the evening, through his remarks and his father's
at dinner. Usually Bibbs was silent, except when directly addressed,
but on the first evening of the third week of his new career he
offered an opinion which had apparently been the subject of previous
argument.</p>

<p>"I'd like you to understand just what I meant about those storage-rooms,
father," he said, as Jackson placed his coffee before him. "Abercrombie
agreed with me, but you wouldn't listen to him."</p>

<p>"You can talk, if you want to, and I'll listen," Sheridan returned,
"but you can't show me that Jim ever took up with a bad thing.
The roof fell because it hadn't had time to settle and on account
of weather conditions. I want that building put just the way Jim
planned it."</p>

<p>"You can't have it," said Bibbs. "You can't, because Jim planned
for the building to stand up, and it won't do it. The other one&mdash;the
one that didn't fall&mdash;is so shot with cracks we haven't dared
use it for storage. It won't stand weight. There's only one thing
to do: get both buildings down as quickly as we can, and build
over. Brick's the best and cheapest in the long run for that type."</p>

<p>Sheridan looked sarcastic. "Fine! What we goin' to do for storage-rooms
while we're waitin' for those few bricks to be laid?"</p>

<p>"Rent," Bibbs returned, promptly. "We'll lose money if we don't
rent, anyhow&mdash;they were waiting so long for you to give the warehouse
matter your attention after the roof fell. You don't know what
an amount of stuff they've got piled up on us over there. We'd
have to rent until we could patch up those process perils&mdash;and
the Krivitch Manufacturing Company's plant is empty, right across
the street. I took an option on it for us this morning."</p>

<p>Sheridan's expression was queer. "Look here!" he said, sharply.
"Did you go and do that without consulting me?"</p>

<p>"It didn't cost anything," said Bibbs. "It's only until to-morrow
afternoon at two o'clock. I undertook to convince you before then."</p>

<p>"Oh, you did?" Sheridan's tone was sardonic. "Well, just suppose
you couldn't convince me."</p>

<p>"I can, though&mdash;and I intend to," said Bibbs, quietly. "I don't
think you understand the condition of those buildings you want
patched up."</p>

<p>"Now, see here," said Sheridan, with slow emphasis; "suppose
I had my mind set about this. <em>JIM </em>thought they'd stand,
and suppose it was&mdash;well, kind of a matter of sentiment with me
to prove he was right."</p>

<p>Bibbs looked at him compassionately. "I'm sorry if you have a
sentiment about it, father," he said. "But whether you have or
not can't make a difference. You'll get other people hurt if you
trust that process, and that won't do. And if you want a monument
to Jim, at least you want one that will stand. Besides, I don't
think you can reasonably defend sentiment in this particular kind
of affair."</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't?"</p>

<p>"No, but I'm sorry you didn't tell me you felt it."</p>

<p>Sheridan was puzzled by his son's tone. "Why are you 'sorry'?"
he asked, curiously.</p>

<p>"Because I had the building inspector up there, this noon," said
Bibbs, "and I had him condemn both those buildings."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He'd been afraid to do it before, until he heard from us&mdash;afraid
you'd see he lost his job. But he can't un-condemn them&mdash;they've
got to come down now."</p>

<p>Sheridan gave him a long and piercing stare from beneath lowered
brows. Finally he said, "How long did they give you on that option
to convince me?"</p>

<p>"Until two o'clock to-morrow afternoon."</p>

<p>"All right," said Sheridan, not relaxing. "I'm convinced."</p>

<p>Bibbs jumped up. "I thought you would be. I'll telephone the
Krivitch agent. He gave me the option until to-morrow, but I told
him I'd settle it this evening."</p>

<p>Sheridan gazed after him as he left the room, and then, though
his expression did not alter in the slightest, a sound came from
him that startled his wife. It had been a long time since she
had heard anything resembling a chuckle from him, and this sound&mdash;although
it was grim and dry&mdash;bore that resemblance.</p>

<p>She brightened eagerly. "Looks like he was startin' right well
don't it, papa?"</p>

<p>"Startin'? Lord! He got me on the hip! Why, HE knew what I wanted&mdash;that's
why he had the inspector up there, so't he'd have me beat before
we even started to talk about it. And did you hear him? 'Can't
reasonably defend <em>SENTIMENT!' </em>And the way he says 'Us':
'Took an option for Us'! 'Stuff piled up on Us'!"</p>

<p>There was always an alloy for Mrs. sheridan. "I don't just like
the way he looks, though, papa."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's got to be something! Only one chick left at home,
so you start to frettin' about IT!"</p>

<p>"No. He's changed. There's kind of a settish look to his face,
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I guess that's the common sense comin' out on him, then," said
Sheridan. "You'll see symptoms like that in a good many business
men, I expect."</p>

<p>"Well, and he don't have as good color as he was gettin' before.
And he'd begun to fill out some, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sheridan gave forth another dry chuckle, and, going round the
table to her, patted her upon the shoulder with his left hand,
his right being still heavily bandaged, though he no longer wore
a sling. "That's the way it is with you, mamma&mdash;got to take your
frettin' out one way if you don't another!"</p>

<p>"No. He don't look well. It ain't exactly the way he looked when
he begun to get sick that time, but he kind o' seems to be losin',
some way."</p>

<p>"Yes, he may 'a' lost something," said Sheridan. "I expect he's
lost a whole lot o' foolishness besides his God-forsaken notions
about writin' poetry and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," his wife persisted. "I mean he looks right peakid. And
yesterday, when he was settin' with us, he kept lookin' out the
window. He wasn't readin'."</p>

<p>"Well, why shouldn't he look out the window?"</p>

<p>"He was lookin' over there. He never read a word all afternoon,
I don't believe."</p>

<p>"Look, here!" said Sheridan. "Bibbs might 'a' kept goin' on over
there the rest of his life, moonin' on and on, but what he heard
Sibyl say did one big thing, anyway. It woke him up out of his
trance. Well, he had to go and bust clean out with a bang; and
that stopped his goin' over there, and it stopped his poetry,
but I reckon he's begun to get pretty fair pay for what he lost.
I guess a good many young men have had to get over worries like
his; they got to lose <em>SOMETHING </em>if they're goin' to keep
ahead o' the procession nowadays&mdash;and it kind o' looks to me,
mamma, like Bibbs might keep quite a considerable long way ahead.
Why, a year from now I'll bet you he won't know there ever <em>WAS
</em>such a thing as poetry! And ain't he funny? He wanted to
stick to the shop so's he could 'think'! What he meant was, think
about something useless. Well, I guess he's keepin' his mind pretty
occupied the other way these days. Yes, sir, it took a pretty
fair-sized shock to get him out of his trance, but it certainly
did the business." He patted his wife's shoulder again, and then,
without any prefatory symptoms, broke into a boisterous laugh.</p>

<p>"Honest, mamma, he works like a gorilla!"</p>
