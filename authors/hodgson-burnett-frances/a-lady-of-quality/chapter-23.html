<p>'Twas in these days Sir Jeoffry came to his end, it being in such way as
had been often prophesied; and when this final hour came, there was but
one who could give him comfort, and this was the daughter whose youth he
had led with such careless evilness to harm.
</p>
<p>If he had wondered at her when she had been my Lady Dunstanwolde, as her
Grace of Osmonde he regarded her with heavy awe.  Never had she been able
to lead him to visit her at her house in town or at any other which was
her home.  "'Tis all too grand for me, your Grace," he would say; "I am a
country yokel, and have hunted and drank, and lived too hard to look well
among town gentlemen.  I must be drunk at dinner, and when I am in liquor
I am no ornament to a duchess's drawing-room.  But what a woman you have
grown," he would say, staring at her and shaking his head.  "Each time I
clap eyes on you 'tis to marvel at you, remembering what a baggage you
were, and how you kept from slipping by the way.  There was Jack Oxon,
now," he added one day--"after you married Dunstanwolde, I heard a pretty
tale of Jack--that he had made a wager among his friends in town--he was
a braggart devil, Jack--that he would have you, though you were so
scornful; and knowing him to be a liar, his fellows said that unless he
could bring back a raven lock six feet long to show them, he had lost his
bet, for they would believe no other proof.  And finely they scoffed at
him when he came back saying that he had had one, but had hid it away for
safety when he was drunk, and could not find it again.  They so flouted
and jeered at him that swords were drawn, and blood as well.  But though
he was a beauty and a crafty rake-hell fellow, you were too sharp for
him.  Had you not had so shrewd a wit and strong a will, you would not
have been the greatest duchess in England, Clo, as well as the finest
woman."
</p><p>"Nay," she answered--"in those days--nay, let us not speak of them!  I
would blot them out--out."
</p><p>As time went by, and the years spent in drink and debauchery began to
tell even on the big, strong body which should have served any other man
bravely long past his threescore and ten, Sir Jeoffry drank harder and
lived more wildly, sometimes being driven desperate by dulness, his
coarse pleasures having lost their potency.
</p><p>"Liquor is not as strong as it once was," he used to grumble, "and there
are fewer things to stir a man to frolic.  Lord, what roaring days and
nights a man could have thirty years ago."
</p><p>So in his efforts to emulate such nights and days, he plunged deeper and
deeper into new orgies; and one night, after a heavy day's hunting,
sitting at the head of his table with his old companions, he suddenly
leaned forward, staring with starting eyes at an empty chair in a dark
corner.  His face grew purple, and he gasped and gurgled.
</p><p>"What is't, Jeoff?" old Eldershawe cried, touching his shoulder with a
shaking hand.  "What's the man staring at, as if he had gone mad?"
</p><p>"Jack," cried Sir Jeoffry, his eyes still farther starting from their
sockets.  "Jack! what say you?  I cannot hear."
</p><p>The next instant he sprang up, shrieking, and thrusting with his hands as
if warding something off.
</p><p>"Keep back!" he yelled.  "There is green mould on thee.  Where hast thou
been to grow mouldy?  Keep back!  Where hast thou been?"
</p><p>His friends at table started up, staring at him and losing colour; he
shrieked so loud and strangely, he clutched his hair with his hands, and
fell into his chair, raving, clutching, and staring, or dashing his head
down upon the table to hide his face, and then raising it as if he could
not resist being drawn in his affright to gaze again.  There was no
soothing him.  He shouted, and struggled with those who would have held
him.  'Twas Jack Oxon who was there, he swore--Jack, who kept stealing
slowly nearer to him, his face and his fine clothes damp and green, he
beat at the air with mad hands, and at last fell upon the floor, and
rolled, foaming at the mouth.
</p><p>They contrived, after great strugglings, to bear him to his chamber, but
it took the united strength of all who would stay near him to keep him
from making an end of himself.  By the dawn of day his boon companions
stood by him with their garments torn to tatters, their faces drenched
with sweat, and their own eyes almost starting from their sockets; the
doctor who had been sent for, coming in no hurry, but scowled and shook
his head when he beheld him.
</p><p>"He is a dead man," he said, "and the wonder is that this has not come
before.  He is sodden with drink and rotten with ill-living, besides
being past all the strength of youth.  He dies of the life he has lived."
</p><p>'Twas little to be expected that his boon companions could desert their
homes and pleasures and tend his horrors longer than a night.  Such a
sight as he presented did not inspire them to cheerful spirits.
</p><p>"Lord," said Sir Chris Crowell, "to see him clutch his flesh and shriek
and mouth, is enough to make a man live sober for his remaining days,"
and he shook his big shoulders with a shudder.
</p><p>"Ugh!" he said, "God grant I may make a better end.  He writhes as in
hell-fire."
</p><p>"There is but one on earth who will do aught for him," said Eldershawe.
"'Tis handsome Clo, who is a duchess; but she will come and tend him, I
could swear.  Even when she was a lawless devil of a child she had a way
of standing by her friends and fearing naught."
</p><p>So after taking counsel together they sent for her, and in as many hours
as it took to drive from London, her coach stood before the door.  By
this time all the household was panic-stricken and in hopeless disorder,
the women-servants scattered and shuddering in far corners of the house;
such men as could get out of the way having found work to do afield or in
the kennels, for none had nerve to stay where they could hear the
madman's shrieks and howls.
</p><p>Her Grace, entering the house, went with her woman straight to her
chamber, and shortly emerged therefrom, stripped of her rich apparel, and
clad in a gown of strong blue linen, her hair wound close, her white
hands bare of any ornament, save the band of gold which was her weddingring.  
A serving-woman might have been clad so; but the plainness of her
garb but made her height, and strength, so reveal themselves, that the
mere sight of her woke somewhat that was like to awe in the eyes of the
servants who beheld her as she passed.
</p><p>She needed not to be led, but straightway followed the awful sounds,
until she reached the chamber behind whose door they were shut.  Upon the
huge disordered bed, Sir Jeoffry writhed, and tried to tear himself, his
great sinewy and hairy body almost stark.  Two of the stable men were
striving to hold him.
</p><p>The duchess went to his bedside and stood there, laying her strong white
hand upon his shuddering shoulder.
</p><p>"Father," she said, in a voice so clear, and with such a ring of steady
command, as, the men said later, might have reached a dead man's ear.
"Father, 'tis Clo!"
</p><p>Sir Jeoffry writhed his head round and glared at her, with starting eyes
and foaming mouth.
</p><p>"Who says 'tis Clo?" he shouted.  "'Tis a lie!  She was ever a bigger
devil than any other, though she was but a handsome wench.  Jack himself
could not manage her.  She beat him, and would beat him now.  'Tis a
lie!"
</p><p>All through that day and night the power of her Grace's white arm was the
thing which saved him from dashing out his brains.  The two men could not
have held him, and at his greatest frenzy they observed that now and then
his bloodshot eye would glance aside at the beauteous face above him.  The
sound of the word "Clo" had struck upon his brain and wakened an echo.
</p><p>She sent away the men to rest, calling for others in their places; but
leave the bedside herself she would not.  'Twas a strange thing to see
her strength and bravery, which could not be beaten down.  When the
doctor came again he found her there, and changed his surly and reluctant
manner in the presence of a duchess, and one who in her close linen gown
wore such a mien.
</p><p>"You should not have left him," she said to him unbendingly, "even though
I myself can see there is little help that can be given.  Thought you his
Grace and I would brook that he should die alone if we could not have
reached him?"
</p><p>Those words "his Grace and I" put a new face upon the matter, and all was
done that lay within the man's skill; but most was he disturbed
concerning the lady, who would not be sent to rest, and whose noble
consort would be justly angered if she were allowed to injure her superb
health.
</p><p>"His Grace knew what I came to do and how I should do it," the duchess
said, unbending still.  "But for affairs of State which held him, he
would have been here at my side."
</p><p>She held her place throughout the second night, and that was worse than
the first--the paroxysms growing more and more awful; for Jack was within
a yard, and stretched out a green and mouldy hand, the finger-bones
showing through the flesh, the while he smiled awfully.
</p><p>At last one pealing scream rang out after another, until after making his
shuddering body into an arc resting on heels and head, the madman fell
exhausted, his flesh all quaking before the eye.  Then the duchess waved
the men who helped, away.  She sat upon the bed's edge close--close to
her father's body, putting her two firm hands on either of his shoulders,
holding him so, and bent down, looking into his wild face, as if she
fixed upon his very soul all the power of her wondrous will.
</p><p>"Father," she said, "look at my face.  Thou canst if thou wilt.  Look at
my face.  Then wilt thou see 'tis Clo--and she will stand by thee."
</p><p>She kept her gaze upon his very pupils; and though 'twas at first as if
his eyes strove to break away from her look, their effort was controlled
by her steadfastness, and they wandered back at last, and her great orbs
held them.  He heaved a long breath, half a big, broken sob, and lay
still, staring up at her.
</p><p>"Ay," he said, "'tis Clo! 'tis Clo!"
</p><p>The sweat began to roll from his forehead, and the tears down his cheeks.
He broke forth, wailing like a child.
</p><p>"Clo--Clo," he said, "I am in hell."
</p><p>She put her hand on his breast, keeping will and eyes set on him.
</p><p>"Nay," she answered; "thou art on earth, and in thine own bed, and I am
here, and will not leave thee."
</p><p>She made another sign to the men who stood and stared aghast in wonder at
her, but feeling in the very air about her the spell to which the madness
had given way.
</p><p>"'Twas not mere human woman who sat there," they said afterwards in the
stables among their fellows.  "'Twas somewhat more.  Had such a will been
in an evil thing a man's hair would have risen on his skull at the seeing
of it."
</p><p>"Go now," she said to them, "and send women to set the place in order."
</p><p>She had seen delirium and death enough in the doings of her deeds of
mercy, to know that his strength had gone and death was coming.  His bed
and room were made orderly, and at last he lay in clean linen, with all
made straight.  Soon his eyes seemed to sink into his head and stare from
hollows, and his skin grew grey, but ever he stared only at his
daughter's face.
</p><p>"Clo," he said at last, "stay by me!  Clo, go not away!"
</p><p>"I shall not go," she answered.
</p><p>She drew a seat close to his bed and took his hand.  It lay knotted and
gnarled and swollen-veined upon her smooth palm, and with her other hand
she stroked it.  His breath came weak and quick, and fear grew in his
eyes.
</p><p>"What is it, Clo?" he said.  "What is't?"
</p><p>"'Tis weakness," replied she, soothing him.  "Soon you will sleep."
</p><p>"Ay," he said, with a breath like a sob.  "'Tis over."
</p><p>His big body seemed to collapse, he shrank so in the bed-clothes.
</p><p>"What day o' the year is it?" he asked.
</p><p>"The tenth of August," was her answer.
</p><p>"Sixty-nine years from this day was I born," he said, "and now 'tis
done."
</p><p>"Nay," said she--"nay--God grant--"
</p><p>"Ay," he said, "done.  Would there were nine and sixty more.  What a man
I was at twenty.  I want not to die, Clo.  I want to live--to live--live,
and be young," gulping, "with strong muscle and moist flesh.  Sixty-nine
years--and they are gone!"
</p><p>He clung to her hand, and stared at her with awful eyes.  Through all his
life he had been but a great, strong, human carcass; and he was now but
the same carcass worn out, and at death's door.  Of not one human thing
but of himself had he ever thought, not one creature but himself had he
ever loved--and now he lay at the end, harking back only to the wicked
years gone by.
</p><p>"None can bring them back," he shuddered.  "Not even thou, Clo, who art
so strong.  None--none!  Canst pray, Clo?" with the gasp of a craven.
</p><p>"Not as chaplains do," she answered.  "I believe not in a God who
clamours but for praise."
</p><p>"What dost believe in, then?"
</p><p>"In One who will do justice, and demands that it shall be done to each
thing He has made, by each who bears His image--ay, and mercy too--but
justice always, for justice is mercy's highest self."
</p><p>Who knows the mysteries of the human soul--who knows the workings of the
human brain?  The God who is just alone.  In this man's mind, which was
so near a simple beast's in all its movings, some remote, unborn
consciousness was surely reached and vaguely set astir by the clear words
thus spoken.
</p><p>"Clo, Clo!" he cried, "Clo, Clo!" in terror, clutching her the closer,
"what dost thou mean?  In all my nine and sixty years--" and rolled his
head in agony.
</p><p>In all his nine and sixty years he had shown justice to no man, mercy to
no woman, since he had thought of none but Jeoffry Wildairs; and this
truth somehow dimly reached his long-dulled brain and wakened there.
</p><p>"Down on thy knees, Clo!" he gasped--"down on thy knees!"
</p><p>It was so horrible, the look struggling in his dying face, that she went
down upon her knees that moment, and so knelt, folding his shaking hands
within her own against her breast.
</p><p>"Thou who didst make him as he was born into Thy world," she said, "deal
with that to which Thou didst give life--and death.  Show him in this
hour, which Thou mad'st also, that Thou art not Man who would have
vengeance, but that justice which is God."
</p><p>"Then--then," he gasped--"then will He damn me!"
</p><p>"He will weigh thee," she said; "and that which His own hand created will
He separate from that which was thine own wilful wrong--and this, sure,
He will teach thee how to expiate."
</p><p>"Clo," he cried again--"thy mother--she was but a girl, and died alone--I
did no justice to her!--Daphne!  Daphne!"  And he shook beneath the bedclothes, 
shuddering to his feet, his face growing more grey and pinched.
</p><p>"She loved thee once," Clorinda said.  "She was a gentle soul, and would
not forget.  She will show thee mercy."
</p><p>"Birth she went through," he muttered, "and death--alone.  Birth and
death!  Daphne, my girl--"  And his voice trailed off to nothingness, and
he lay staring at space, and panting.
</p><p>The duchess sat by him and held his hand.  She moved not, though at last
he seemed to fall asleep.  Two hours later he began to stir.  He turned
his head slowly upon his pillows until his gaze rested upon her, as she
sat fronting him.  'Twas as though he had awakened to look at her.
</p><p>"Clo!" he cried, and though his voice was but a whisper, there was both
wonder and wild question in it--"Clo!"
</p><p>But she moved not, her great eyes meeting his with steady gaze; and even
as they so looked at each other his body stretched itself, his lids
fell--and he was a dead man.
