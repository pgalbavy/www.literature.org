<p> The Nore sand remains covered at low-water, and never seen by
human eye; but the Nore is a name to conjure with visions of historical
events, of battles, of fleets, of mutinies, of watch and ward
kept upon the great throbbing heart of the State.  This ideal
point of the estuary, this centre of memories, is marked upon
the steely gray expanse of the waters by a lightship painted red
that, from a couple of miles off, looks like a cheap and bizarre
little toy.  I remember how, on coming up the river for the first
time, I was surprised at the smallness of that vivid object—a
tiny warm speck of crimson lost in an immensity of gray tones. 
I was startled, as if of necessity the principal beacon in the
water-way of the greatest town on earth should have presented
imposing proportions.  And, behold! the brown sprit-sail of a
barge hid it entirely from my view.</p>

<p>Coming in from the eastward, the bright colouring of the lightship
marking the part of the river committed to the charge of an Admiral
(the Commander-in-Chief at the Nore) accentuates the dreariness
and the great breadth of the Thames Estuary.  But soon the course
of the ship opens the entrance of the Medway, with its men-of-war
moored in line, and the long wooden jetty of Port Victoria, with
its few low buildings like the beginning of a hasty settlement
upon a wild and unexplored shore.  The famous Thames barges sit
in brown clusters upon the water with an effect of birds floating
upon a pond.  On the imposing expanse of the great estuary the
traffic of the port where so much of the world’s work and the
world’s thinking is being done becomes insignificant, scattered,
streaming away in thin lines of ships stringing themselves out
into the eastern quarter through the various navigable channels
of which the Nore lightship marks the divergence.  The coasting
traffic inclines to the north; the deep-water ships steer east
with a southern inclination, on through the Downs, to the most
remote ends of the world.  In the widening of the shores sinking
low in the gray, smoky distances the greatness of the sea receives
the mercantile fleet of good ships that London sends out upon
the turn of every tide.  They follow each other, going very close
by the Essex shore.  Such as the beads of a rosary told by business-like
shipowners for the greater profit of the world they slip one by
one into the open: while in the offing the inward-bound ships
come up singly and in bunches from under the sea horizon closing
the mouth of the river between Orfordness and North Foreland. 
They all converge upon the Nore, the warm speck of red upon the
tones of drab and gray, with the distant shores running together
towards the west, low and flat, like the sides of an enormous
canal.  The sea-reach of the Thames is straight, and, once Sheerness
is left behind, its banks seem very uninhabited, except for the
cluster of houses which is Southend, or here and there a lonely
wooden jetty where petroleum ships discharge their dangerous cargoes,
and the oil-storage tanks, low and round with slightly-domed roofs,
peep over the edge of the fore-shore, as it were a village of
Central African huts imitated in iron.  Bordered by the black
and shining mud-flats, the level marsh extends for miles.  Away
in the far background the land rises, closing the view with a
continuous wooded slope, forming in the distance an interminable
rampart overgrown with bushes.</p>

<p>Then, on the slight turn of the Lower Hope Reach, clusters of
factory chimneys come distinctly into view, tall and slender above
the squat ranges of cement works in Grays and Greenhithe.  Smoking
quietly at the top against the great blaze of a magnificent sunset,
they give an industrial character to the scene, speak of work,
manufactures, and trade, as palm-groves on the coral strands of
distant islands speak of the luxuriant grace, beauty and vigour
of tropical nature.  The houses of Gravesend crowd upon the shore
with an effect of confusion as if they had tumbled down haphazard
from the top of the hill at the back.  The flatness of the Kentish
shore ends there.  A fleet of steam-tugs lies at anchor in front
of the various piers.  A conspicuous church spire, the first seen
distinctly coming from the sea, has a thoughtful grace, the serenity
of a fine form above the chaotic disorder of men’s houses.  But
on the other side, on the flat Essex side, a shapeless and desolate
red edifice, a vast pile of bricks with many windows and a slate
roof more inaccessible than an Alpine slope, towers over the bend
in monstrous ugliness, the tallest, heaviest building for miles
around, a thing like an hotel, like a mansion of flats (all to
let), exiled into these fields out of a street in West Kensington. 
Just round the corner, as it were, on a pier defined with stone
blocks and wooden piles, a white mast, slender like a stalk of
straw and crossed by a yard like a knitting-needle, flying the
signals of flag and balloon, watches over a set of heavy dock-gates. 
Mast-heads and funnel-tops of ships peep above the ranges of corrugated
iron roofs.  This is the entrance to Tilbury Dock, the most recent
of all London docks, the nearest to the sea.</p>

<p>Between the crowded houses of Gravesend and the monstrous red-brick
pile on the Essex shore the ship is surrendered fairly to the
grasp of the river.  That hint of loneliness, that soul of the
sea which had accompanied her as far as the Lower Hope Reach,
abandons her at the turn of the first bend above.  The salt, acrid
flavour is gone out of the air, together with a sense of unlimited
space opening free beyond the threshold of sandbanks below the
Nore.  The waters of the sea rush on past Gravesend, tumbling
the big mooring buoys laid along the face of the town; but the
sea-freedom stops short there, surrendering the salt tide to the
needs, the artifices, the contrivances of toiling men.  Wharves,
landing-places, dock-gates, waterside stairs, follow each other
continuously right up to London Bridge, and the hum of men’s work
fills the river with a menacing, muttering note as of a breathless,
ever-driving gale.  The water-way, so fair above and wide below,
flows oppressed by bricks and mortar and stone, by blackened timber
and grimed glass and rusty iron, covered with black barges, whipped
up by paddles and screws, overburdened with craft, overhung with
chains, overshadowed by walls making a steep gorge for its bed,
filled with a haze of smoke and dust.</p>

<p>This stretch of the Thames from London Bridge to the Albert Docks
is to other watersides of river ports what a virgin forest would
be to a garden.  It is a thing grown up, not made.  It recalls
a jungle by the confused, varied, and impenetrable aspect of the
buildings that line the shore, not according to a planned purpose,
but as if sprung up by accident from scattered seeds.  Like the
matted growth of bushes and creepers veiling the silent depths
of an unexplored wilderness, they hide the depths of London’s
infinitely varied, vigorous, seething life.  In other river ports
it is not so.  They lie open to their stream, with quays like
broad clearings, with streets like avenues cut through thick timber
for the convenience of trade.  I am thinking now of river ports
I have seen—of Antwerp, for instance; of Nantes or Bordeaux, or
even old Rouen, where the night-watchmen of ships, elbows on rail,
gaze at shop-windows and brilliant cafés, and see the audience
go in and come out of the opera-house.  But London, the oldest
and greatest of river ports, does not possess as much as a hundred
yards of open quays upon its river front.  Dark and impenetrable
at night, like the face of a forest, is the London waterside. 
It is the waterside of watersides, where only one aspect of the
world’s life can be seen, and only one kind of men toils on the
edge of the stream.  The lightless walls seem to spring from the
very mud upon which the stranded barges lie; and the narrow lanes
coming down to the foreshore resemble the paths of smashed bushes
and crumbled earth where big game comes to drink on the banks
of tropical streams.</p>

<p>Behind the growth of the London waterside the docks of London
spread out unsuspected, smooth, and placid, lost amongst the buildings
like dark lagoons hidden in a thick forest.  They lie concealed
in the intricate growth of houses with a few stalks of mastheads
here and there overtopping the roof of some four-story warehouse.</p>

<p>It is a strange conjunction this of roofs and mastheads, of walls
and yard-arms.  I remember once having the incongruity of the
relation brought home to me in a practical way.  I was the chief
officer of a fine ship, just docked with a cargo of wool from
Sydney, after a ninety days’ passage.  In fact, we had not been
in more than half an hour and I was still busy making her fast
to the stone posts of a very narrow quay in front of a lofty warehouse. 
An old man with a gray whisker under the chin and brass buttons
on his pilot-cloth jacket, hurried up along the quay hailing my
ship by name.  He was one of those officials called berthing-masters—not
the one who had berthed us, but another, who, apparently, had
been busy securing a steamer at the other end of the dock.  I
could see from afar his hard blue eyes staring at us, as if fascinated,
with a queer sort of absorption.  I wondered what that worthy
sea-dog had found to criticise in my ship’s rigging.  And I, too,
glanced aloft anxiously.  I could see nothing wrong there.  But
perhaps that superannuated fellow-craftsman was simply admiring
the ship’s perfect order aloft, I thought, with some secret pride;
for the chief officer is responsible for his ship’s appearance,
and as to her outward condition, he is the man open to praise
or blame.  Meantime the old salt ("ex-coasting skipper" was writ
large all over his person) had hobbled up alongside in his bumpy,
shiny boots, and, waving an arm, short and thick like the flipper
of a seal, terminated by a paw red as an uncooked beef-steak,
addressed the poop in a muffled, faint, roaring voice, as if a
sample of every North-Sea fog of his life had been permanently
lodged in his throat: "Haul ’em round, Mr. Mate!" were his words. 
"If you don’t look sharp, you’ll have your topgallant yards through
the windows of that ’ere warehouse presently!"  This was the only
cause of his interest in the ship’s beautiful spars.  I own that
for a time I was struck dumb by the bizarre associations of yard-arms
and window-panes.  To break windows is the last thing one would
think of in connection with a ship’s topgallant yard, unless,
indeed, one were an experienced berthing-master in one of the
London docks.  This old chap was doing his little share of the
world’s work with proper efficiency.  His little blue eyes had
made out the danger many hundred yards off.  His rheumaticky feet,
tired with balancing that squat body for many years upon the decks
of small coasters, and made sore by miles of tramping upon the
flagstones of the dock side, had hurried up in time to avert a
ridiculous catastrophe.  I answered him pettishly, I fear, and
as if I had known all about it before.</p>

<p>"All right, all right! can’t do everything at once."</p>

<p>He remained near by, muttering to himself till the yards had
been hauled round at my order, and then raised again his foggy,
thick voice:</p>

<p>"None too soon," he observed, with a critical glance up at the
towering side of the warehouse.  "That’s a half-sovereign in your
pocket, Mr. Mate.  You should always look first how you are for
them windows before you begin to breast in your ship to the quay."</p>

<p>It was good advice.  But one cannot think of everything or foresee
contacts of things apparently as remote as stars and hop-poles.</p>
