<p>At this point it is necessary that the reader should be made
acquainted with what has been only hinted up to this point. We
mean the reason why it was that the little schooner <em>Coral</em>,
under the charge of Captain Bergen and Abram Storms, the mate,
was on the Pacific Ocean, voyaging toward the South Seas.</p>

<p>The skipper was fond of telling the strange story, and the mate
heard it many times, as repeated to him one stormy night, around
the roaring fire of Captain Bergen's hearthstone in New England.
It ran thus:</p>

<p>"You see, Abe, I was going down Washington Street, in Boston,
one day, when I came upon a drunken sailor, who was suffering
a terrible beating at the hands of a couple of land-sharks, that
were were evidently determined to rob him, if they had not already
done so.</p>

<p>"It r'iled my blood to see such scandalous proceedings going
on, and I sailed in.</p>

<p>"Then I helped pick up Jack tar, and he was taken to the hospital,
where his wounds were found to be of a dangerous nature. His assailants
were so badly hurt that they went to the hospital, and when they
came out they were shifted to the penitentiary, where they're
likely to stay for a good many years to come.</p>

<p>"Having taken the part of Bill Grebbens, as he told me his name
was, I called at the hospital to see him every day, for I wasn't
busy just then. The poor fellow was very grateful for the service
I had done him, though sad to say I was too late.</p>

<p>"Bill had been on such a terrible spree that his system wasn't
in condition to resist disease, and before long it was plain he
was going to make a die of it. He was a plucky fellow, and when
the doctor told him he had to go, he didn't weaken.</p>

<p>"Just before he died, he took me by the hand, and told me he
hadn't a living relative in the world, nor one who had been such
a friend to him as I had proved to be. By that time my own eyes
were getting misty, and I begged him to say nothing about it.</p>

<p>"I told him I would see that he had a decent burial, and would
attend to anything he wanted me to do. He said there wasn't anything,
for it could make no difference to him what became of his body
after his death, and for his part he would as lief the doctors
should have it.</p>

<p>"However, he took this paper from under his pillow and showed
it to me, and told me all about it. I thought at first his mind
was wandering, but I soon saw that his head was level, and he
knew what he was talking about."</p>

<p>The paper which Captain Bergen produced at this point of his
narrative was covered with some well-executed drawings, which,
having been done by the sailor himself, showed that he was a man
of education.</p>

<p>"Those dots there represent the King George Islands of the South
Pacific, lying in about fifteen degrees south latitude and one
hundred and forty-three degrees west longitude. To the north here
is Mendina Archipelago, and here to the east are the Paumotu Islands,
sometimes known as the Pearl Islands. There are a good many of
them, and away to the northeast of the group is another island,
which, although much the larger on the map, is really a small
coral island, with a lagoon, and so unimportant that it has no
name, and cannot be found on any map I ever saw.</p>

<p>"You will observe the figure and directions marked on this paper,"
added Captain Bergen, who invariably became excited at this point
in his narration, "which, with his explanations, are so easily
understood that no one can go astray.</p>

<p>"Well, Bill Grebbens once belonged to a party of mutineers of
a British vessel, who found it growing so hot for them that they
put in to this island, scuttled and sunk their ship, and lived
there two years. It was uninhabited, and they led a lazy, vagabond
life in that charming climate till a strange sort of sickness
broke out among them and carried off eight, leaving only Grebbens
and a single shipmate.</p>

<p>"These two spent several months longer in wandering about the
island looking for and yet dreading to see a sail, when one day
they discovered a bed of pearl-oysters, which they examined and
found to be of surpassing richness. The majority of the shells
contained pearls, many of them of great size, and the two men
saw that an immense fortune lay only a few fathoms under the surface.</p>

<p>"They instantly set to work with great eagerness; but it is seldom
that a man obtains wealth in this world by walking over a path
of roses.</p>

<p>"Within the first half-hour, a huge man-eating shark glided into
the clear water, and with one snap of his enormous jaws actually
bit the body of the other sailor in two. The horrified Grebbens
managed to get out just in time to save himself.</p>

<p>"He had enough of pearl-diving, and he shudderingly turned his
back upon the spot, and began looking out to sea again for a sail,
determined now to leave, no matter if he should be carried to
England and executed.</p>

<p>"He managed to set up the topmast of the wreck, and to catch
the attention of a whaler a few days later, and was taken off.
Before going, however, he made a careful drawing of the place,
and by studying other charts on the American whaler which took
him away he was able to locate the island with such correctness
that he could return to it at any time, his intention, of course,
being to do so at some period when he could go provided with means
to prosecute his search without such frightful risk.</p>

<p>"But Bill never saw the time, for he was too fond of liquor when
ashore. He met his death just as I told you, and he gave me this
chart or map of the locality, telling me that a fortune lay at
that point where my finger is resting to whosoever should go after
it."</p>

<p>Such was the story of Captain Bergen, as he related it to his
friend, Abe Storms, to whom he proposed that they should fit out
an expedition to go to the South Seas in quest of the fortune
that awaited them in the shape of pearls.</p>

<p>Abe was slower and more deliberate, but he finally fell in with
the scheme, and the two, as we have already stated, became joint
partners in the grand enterprise.</p>

<p>Both were frugal men, and they now decided to invest all their
funds in the scheme, which promised to make or break them. Instead
of sailing from the port of Boston, they took an important cut
"across lots" by going by rail to San Francisco, thus saving the
longest and most dangerous portion of the voyage, which otherwise
would be necessary. In San Francisco, at a sale of bankrupt property,
they bought the schooner, which has already been described, and
shipped their crew.</p>

<p>The wonder was that two men possessing the shrewdness of Storms
and Bergen should have been so deceived respecting their men.</p>

<p>Hyde Brazzier was an American sailor, with blotched, bleared
face, with one eye gone, while over the sunken, sightless cavity
he wore a green patch, his face covered by a scraggly beard, and
his single eye, small and deep-set, added to the sinister expression
of his countenance.</p>

<p>He had the reputation of being a good seaman, and undoubtedly
he was, and being strong and vigorous, in the prime of life, he
was considered an especially valuable man to Captain Bergen, who
paid him five dollars more per month than he expected.</p>

<p>Since Captain Bergen had pursued a rather original course from
the beginning, he continued to do so. He engaged his men without
any help from the shipping-master, and had hardly reached an understanding
with the American when Alfredo Redvignez put in an appearance
and applied for a berth, saying that he had heard the best kinds
of accounts of the captain's seamanship and humanity&mdash;even in
far-away Boston.</p>

<p>Redvig&mdash;so called for convenience&mdash;said that he had been employed
in the East India trade, and was a sailor of nearly twenty years'
experience. It struck both Captain Bergen and Mate Storms that,
as they were going to the tropics, he was likely to prove a useful
man, and he was engaged.</p>

<p>The captain ventured to ask Brazzier's opinion of the other sailor,
but the American said he had never heard of him before&mdash;though
he liked the cut of his jib, and was glad he had been hired. But
had any one been watching the faces of the American and Spaniard,
he would have detected several suspicious signals which passed
between them; and this, added to the fact that, in a very short
time, they became intimately acquainted, as may be said, looked
as if there had been deception on that point.</p>

<p>The fact was, the two had arranged the matter beforehand, so
as to go together in this business&mdash;somewhat on the same principle
that their employers entered into partnership. They were both
serving under assumed names, and were obliged to take no little
precaution to keep their identity concealed, for they were "wanted"
for serious crimes in more than one port.</p>

<p>Redvig was a small, swarthy, muscular man, with coal-black, curling
hair, short, curly beard and mustache, black eyes, with an aquiline
nose, and both he and Brazzier had a fashion of wearing small
gold ear-rings. Their arms and breast were plentifully tattooed,
so that but for the great exception of their evil dispositions,
they might well have passed for good specimens of the proverbial
Jack tar.</p>

<p>It was different with the huge colored man, Pomp Cooper, who
had been known about the wharves of San Francisco for a number
of years. He was jolly and good-natured, possessed of prodigious
strength, and had been on shipboard enough to acquire a fair knowledge
of navigating a coasting vessel.</p>

<p>While many believed he possessed the proverbial loyalty of his
race, and could not be induced to commit any grave crime, yet
it must be admitted that there were ugly rumors afloat concerning
him. It was asserted by more than one that he was a river and
harbor pirate, and belonged to one of the worst gangs that ever
infested the harbor of San Francisco.</p>

<p>While Captain Bergen was not ignorant of these rumors, yet he
placed no credence in them, and believed Pomp to be one of the
most valuable men he could obtain. Such in brief was the crew
of the <em>Coral</em>, when she sailed on her long voyage to the
South Seas, in quest of pearls&mdash;the location of which had been
given by the dying sailor in the Boston hospital.</p>
