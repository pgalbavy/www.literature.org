WHEN another night came the columns,
changed to purple streaks, filed across two pon-
toon bridges.  A glaring fire wine-tinted the
waters of the river.  Its rays, shining upon the
moving masses of troops, brought forth here and
there sudden gleams of silver or gold.  Upon
the other shore a dark and mysterious range of
hills was curved against the sky.  The insect
voices of the night sang solemnly.
<P>
After this crossing the youth assured himself
that at any moment they might be suddenly and
fearfully assaulted from the caves of the lowering
woods.  He kept his eyes watchfully upon the
darkness.
<P>
But his regiment went unmolested to a camp-
ing place, and its soldiers slept the brave sleep
of wearied men.  In the morning they were
routed out with early energy, and hustled along
a narrow road that led deep into the forest.
<P>
It was during this rapid march that the regi-
<P>
32
ment lost many of the marks of a new com-
mand.
<P>
The men had begun to count the miles upon
their fingers, and they grew tired.  "Sore feet
an' damned short rations, that's all," said the
loud soldier.  There was perspiration and grum-
blings.  After a time they began to shed their
knapsacks.  Some tossed them unconcernedly
down; others hid them carefully, asserting their
plans to return for them at some convenient
time.  Men extricated themselves from thick
shirts.  Presently few carried anything but their
necessary clothing, blankets, haversacks, canteens,
and arms and ammunition.  "You can now eat
and shoot," said the tall soldier to the youth.
"That's all you want to do."
<P>
There was sudden change from the ponderous
infantry of theory to the light and speedy infantry
of practice.  The regiment, relieved of a burden,
received a new impetus.  But there was much
loss of valuable knapsacks, and, on the whole,
very good shirts.
<P>
But the regiment was not yet veteranlike in
appearance.  Veteran regiments in the army
were likely to be very small aggregations of men.
Once, when the command had first come to the
field, some perambulating veterans, noting the
length of their column, had accosted them thus:
"Hey, fellers, what brigade is that?"  And when
the men had replied that they formed a regiment
and not a brigade, the older soldiers had laughed,
and said, "O Gawd!"
<P>
Also, there was too great a similarity in the
hats.  The hats of a regiment should properly
represent the history of headgear for a period of
years.  And, moreover, there were no letters of
faded gold speaking from the colors.  They were
new and beautiful, and the color bearer habitu-
ally oiled the pole.
<P>
Presently the army again sat down to think.
The odor of the peaceful pines was in the men's
nostrils.  The sound of monotonous axe blows
rang through the forest, and the insects, nodding
upon their perches, crooned like old women.
The youth returned to his theory of a blue dem-
onstration.
<P>
One gray dawn, however, he was kicked in
the leg by the tall soldier, and then, before he
was entirely awake, he found himself running
down a wood road in the midst of men who were
panting from the first effects of speed.  His can-
teen banged rhythmically upon his thigh, and his
haversack bobbed softly.  His musket bounced
a trifle from his shoulder at each stride and made
his cap feel uncertain upon his head.
<P>
He could hear the men whisper jerky sen-
tences: "Say--what's all this--about?"  "What
th' thunder--we--skedaddlin' this way fer?"
"Billie--keep off m' feet.  Yeh run--like a cow."
And the loud soldier's shrill voice could be
heard: "What th' devil they in sich a hurry for?"
<P>
The youth thought the damp fog of early
morning moved from the rush of a great body
of troops.  From the distance came a sudden
spatter of firing.
<P>
He was bewildered.  As he ran with his com-
rades he strenuously tried to think, but all he knew
was that if he fell down those coming behind
would tread upon him.  All his faculties seemed
to be needed to guide him over and past obstruc-
tions.  He felt carried along by a mob.
<P>
The sun spread disclosing rays, and, one by
one, regiments burst into view like armed men
just born of the earth.  The youth perceived
that the time had come.  He was about to be
measured.  For a moment he felt in the face of
his great trial like a babe, and the flesh over
his heart seemed very thin.  He seized time to
look about him calculatingly.
<P>
But he instantly saw that it would be impossi-
ble for him to escape from the regiment.  It in-
closed him.  And there were iron laws of tradi-
tion and law on four sides.  He was in a moving
box.
<P>
As he perceived this fact it occurred to him
that he had never wished to come to the war.
He had not enlisted of his free will.  He had
been dragged by the merciless government.  And
now they were taking him out to be slaughtered.
<P>
The regiment slid down a bank and wallowed
across a little stream.  The mournful current
moved slowly on, and from the water, shaded
black, some white bubble eyes looked at the men.
<P>
As they climbed the hill on the farther side
artillery began to boom.  Here the youth forgot
many things as he felt a sudden impulse of curi-
osity.  He scrambled up the bank with a speed
that could not be exceeded by a bloodthirsty
man.
<P>
He expected a battle scene.
<P>
There were some little fields girted and
squeezed by a forest.  Spread over the grass and
in among the tree trunks, he could see knots and
waving lines of skirmishers who were running
hither and thither and firing at the landscape.
A dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck clearing
that gleamed orange color.  A flag fluttered.
<P>
Other regiments floundered up the bank.  The
brigade was formed in line of battle, and after a
pause started slowly through the woods in the
rear of the receding skirmishers, who were con-
tinually melting into the scene to appear again
farther on.  They were always busy as bees,
deeply absorbed in their little combats.
<P>
The youth tried to observe everything.  He
did not use care to avoid trees and branches,
and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking
against stones or getting entangled in briers.
He was aware that these battalions with their
commotions were woven red and startling into
the gentle fabric of softened greens and browns.
It looked to be a wrong place for a battle field.
<P>
The skirmishers in advance fascinated him.
Their shots into thickets and at distant and
prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies--hid-
den, mysterious, solemn.
<P>
Once the line encountered the body of a dead
soldier.  He lay upon his back staring at the sky.
He was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish
brown.  The youth could see that the soles of his
shoes had been worn to the thinness of writing
paper, and from a great rent in one the dead foot
projected piteously.  And it was as if fate had
betrayed the soldier.  In death it exposed to his
enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps
concealed from his friends.
<P>
The ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse.
The invulnerable dead man forced a way for him-
self.  The youth looked keenly at the ashen face.
The wind raised the tawny beard.  It moved as
if a hand were stroking it.  He vaguely desired
to walk around and around the body and stare;
the impulse of the living to try to read in dead
eyes the answer to the Question.
<P>
During the march the ardor which the youth
had acquired when out of view of the field rapidly
faded to nothing.  His curiosity was quite easily
satisfied.  If an intense scene had caught him with
its wild swing as he came to the top of the bank,
he might have gone roaring on.  This advance
upon Nature was too calm.  He had opportunity
to reflect.  He had time in which to wonder
about himself and to attempt to probe his sensa-
tions.
<P>
Absurd ideas took hold upon him.  He
thought that he did not relish the landscape.
It threatened him.  A coldness swept over his
back, and it is true that his trousers felt to him
that they were no fit for his legs at all.
<P>
A house standing placidly in distant fields
had to him an ominous look.  The shadows of
the woods were formidable.  He was certain that
in this vista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts.  The
swift thought came to him that the generals did
not know what they were about.  It was all a
trap.  Suddenly those close forests would bristle
with rifle barrels.  Ironlike brigades would ap-
pear in the rear.  They were all going to be
sacrificed.  The generals were stupids.  The
enemy would presently swallow the whole com-
mand.  He glared about him, expecting to see
the stealthy approach of his death.
<P>
He thought that he must break from the ranks
and harangue his comrades.  They must not all
be killed like pigs; and he was sure it would
come to pass unless they were informed of these
dangers.  The generals were idiots to send them
marching into a regular pen.  There was but one
pair of eyes in the corps.  He would step forth
and make a speech.  Shrill and passionate words
came to his lips.
<P>
The line, broken into moving fragments by the
ground, went calmly on through fields and woods.
The youth looked at the men nearest him, and
saw, for the most part, expressions of deep inter-
est, as if they were investigating something that
had fascinated them.  One or two stepped with
overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged
into war.  Others walked as upon thin ice.  The
greater part of the untested men appeared quiet
and absorbed.  They were going to look at war,
the red animal--war, the blood-swollen god.  And
they were deeply engrossed in this march.
<P>
As he looked the youth gripped his outcry at
his throat.  He saw that even if the men were
tottering with fear they would laugh at his warn-
ing.  They would jeer him, and, if practicable,
pelt him with missiles.  Admitting that he might
be wrong, a frenzied declamation of the kind
would turn him into a worm.
<P>
He assumed, then, the demeanor of one who
knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten re-
sponsibilities.  He lagged, with tragic glances at
the sky.
<P>
He was surprised presently by the young lieu-
tenant of his company, who began heartily to
beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and
insolent voice: "Come, young man, get up into
ranks there.  No skulking'll do here."  He mend-
ed his pace with suitable haste.  And he hated
the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine
minds.  He was a mere brute.
<P>
After a time the brigade was halted in the
cathedral light of a forest.  The busy skirmish-
ers were still popping.  Through the aisles of
the wood could be seen the floating smoke from
their rifles.  Sometimes it went up in little balls,
white and compact.
<P>
During this halt many men in the regiment
began erecting tiny hills in front of them.  They
used stones, sticks, earth, and anything they
thought might turn a bullet.  Some built com-
paratively large ones, while others seemed con-
tent with little ones.
<P>
This procedure caused a discussion among the
men.  Some wished to fight like duelists, believ-
ing it to be correct to stand erect and be, from
their feet to their foreheads, a mark.  They said
they scorned the devices of the cautious.  But
the others scoffed in reply, and pointed to the
veterans on the flanks who were digging at the
ground like terriers.  In a short time there was
quite a barricade along the regimental fronts.
Directly, however, they were ordered to with-
draw from that place.
<P>
This astounded the youth.  He forgot his
stewing over the advance movement.  "Well,
then, what did they march us out here for?" he
demanded of the tall soldier.  The latter with
calm faith began a heavy explanation, although
he had been compelled to leave a little protection
of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much
care and skill.
<P>
When the regiment was aligned in another
position each man's regard for his safety caused
another line of small intrenchments.  They ate
their noon meal behind a third one.  They were
moved from this one also.  They were marched
from place to place with apparent aimlessness.
<P>
The youth had been taught that a man be-
came another thing in a battle.  He saw his sal-
vation in such a change.  Hence this waiting
was an ordeal to him.  He was in a fever of im-
patience.  He considered that there was denoted
a lack of purpose on the part of the generals.
He began to complain to the tall soldier.  "I
can't stand this much longer," he cried.  "I
don't see what good it does to make us wear
out our legs for nothin'."  He wished to return
to camp, knowing that this affair was a blue
demonstration; or else to go into a battle and
discover that he had been a fool in his doubts,
and was, in truth, a man of traditional courage.
The strain of present circumstances he felt to be
intolerable.
<P>
The philosophical tall soldier measured a sand-
wich of cracker and pork and swallowed it in a
nonchalant manner.  "Oh, I suppose we must go
reconnoitering around the country jest to keep
'em from getting too close, or to develop 'em, or
something."
<P>
"Huh!" said the loud soldier.
<P>
"Well," cried the youth, still fidgeting, "I'd
rather do anything 'most than go tramping 'round
the country all day doing no good to nobody and
jest tiring ourselves out."
<P>
"So would I," said the loud soldier.  "It ain't
right.  I tell you if anybody with any sense was
a-runnin' this army it--"
<P>
"Oh, shut up!" roared the tall private.  "You
little fool.  You little damn' cuss.  You ain't had
that there coat and them pants on for six months,
and yet you talk as if--"
<P>
"Well, I wanta do some fighting anyway,"
interrupted the other.  "I didn't come here to
walk.  I could 'ave walked to home--'round an'
'round the barn, if I jest wanted to walk."
<P>
The tall one, red-faced, swallowed another
sandwich as if taking poison in despair.
<P>
But gradually, as he chewed, his face became
again quiet and contented.  He could not rage
in fierce argument in the presence of such sand-
wiches.  During his meals he always wore an air
of blissful contemplation of the food he had swal-
lowed.  His spirit seemed then to be communing
with the viands.
<P>
He accepted new environment and circum-
stance with great coolness, eating from his haver-
sack at every opportunity.  On the march he
went along with the stride of a hunter, object-
ing to neither gait nor distance.  And he had
not raised his voice when he had been ordered
away from three little protective piles of earth
and stone, each of which had been an engineer-
ing feat worthy of being made sacred to the name
of his grandmother.
<P>
In the afternoon the regiment went out over
the same ground it had taken in the morn-
ing.  The landscape then ceased to threaten the
youth.  He had been close to it and become
familiar with it.
<P>
When, however, they began to pass into a
new region, his old fears of stupidity and in-
competence reassailed him, but this time he dog-
gedly let them babble.  He was occupied with
his problem, and in his desperation he concluded
that the stupidity did not greatly matter.
<P>
Once he thought he had concluded that it
would be better to get killed directly and end
his troubles.  Regarding death thus out of the
corner of his eye, he conceived it to be noth-
ing but rest, and he was filled with a momen-
tary astonishment that he should have made an
extraordinary commotion over the mere matter
of getting killed.  He would die; he would go
to some place where he would be understood.
It was useless to expect appreciation of his pro-
found and fine senses from such men as the lieu-
tenant.  He must look to the grave for compre-
hension.
<P>
The skirmish fire increased to a long chatter-
ing sound.  With it was mingled far-away cheer-
ing.  A battery spoke.
<P>
Directly the youth would see the skirmishers
running.  They were pursued by the sound of
musketry fire.  After a time the hot, dangerous
flashes of the rifles were visible.  Smoke clouds
went slowly and insolently across the fields like
observant phantoms.  The din became crescendo,
like the roar of an oncoming train.
<P>
A brigade ahead of them and on the right
went into action with a rending roar.  It was
as if it had exploded.  And thereafter it lay
stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall,
that one was obliged to look twice at to make
sure that it was smoke.
<P>
The youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting
killed, gazed spell bound.  His eyes grew wide
and busy with the action of the scene.  His
mouth was a little ways open.
<P>
Of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid
upon his shoulder.  Awakening from his trance
of observation he turned and beheld the loud
soldier.
<P>
"It's my first and last battle, old boy," said
the latter, with intense gloom.  He was quite
pale and his girlish lip was trembling.
<P>
"Eh?" murmured the youth in great aston-
ishment.
<P>
"It's my first and last battle, old boy,"
continued the loud soldier.  "Something tells
me--"
<P>
"What?"
<P>
"I'm a gone coon this first time and--and I
w-want you to take these here things--to--my--
folks."  He ended in a quavering sob of pity for
himself.  He handed the youth a little packet
done up in a yellow envelope.
<P>
"Why, what the devil--" began the youth
again.
<P>
But the other gave him a glance as from the
depths of a tomb, and raised his limp hand in a
prophetic manner and turned away.
