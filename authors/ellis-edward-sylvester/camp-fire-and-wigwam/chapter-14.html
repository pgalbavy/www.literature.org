<p>The reader has not forgotten the encounter between Jacob Relstaub
and Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, when the former plunged headlong through
his own door in mortal fear that the tomahawk of the youthful
warrior would be sent crashing through his brain; but, much as
Deerfoot despised the German, he had no thought of visiting injury
upon him. Shoving back the weapon to its place in his girdle,
he therefore strode off in the forest, never pausing in his walk
until the sun appeared above the horizon. He was then many miles
from Martinsville, his face turned toward the southwest.</p>

<p>Throwing himself on his face, he quaffed his fill from a small,
clear stream, whose current was only moderately cool, and then,
assuming an easy posture on the ground, gave himself over to deep
thought.</p>

<p>The question which he was seeking to answer was as to his duty.
He had gone to the settlement to see his young friends, and learned
that they had started some hours before on a hunting expedition.
Such a proceeding was so natural, and, withal, so common, that
any one expressing wonder thereat was likely to be laughed at
for his words. The boys of the frontier learn to handle the rifle
when much younger than either Otto Relstaub or Jack Carleton,
and they were sometimes absent for days at a time without causing
any misgiving on the part of their parents.</p>

<p>Why, then, should Deerfoot be perplexed over the matter, when
even the mother of Jack expressed no fear concerning him?</p>

<p>Why, indeed? That was the query which puzzled the young warrior.
It has already been said it was the custom of Deerfoot to follow
a certain inexplainable intuition which often came to his help
in his moments of doubt. In the present instance, something seemed
to whisper that it was his duty to look after the boys, but the
whisper was so low&mdash;as may be said&mdash;that he hesitated to obey
it, led to do so by a doubt as to whether, after all, it was that
instinctive prompting which hitherto had guided him so infallibly
in many of his daring enterprises and undertakings.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the warrior that, after spending a long
time in such anxious thought, he should draw his Bible from the
inner pocket of his hunting shirt, and begin looking through its
pages for guidance. There were certain portions that were favorites
of his, and, without searching, the volume opened to one after
another of these places; but seek as much as he chose, he could
find nothing that bore on the problem he wished to solve.</p>

<p>"The Great Spirit wills that Deerfoot shall settle the question
for himself," was his conclusion, as he returned the treasure
to its place.</p>

<p>It may as well be admitted that the principal cause of Deerfoot's
hesitation cannot be given at this time. There was an urgent reason
why he should make haste to the southwest, and he longed to break
into his easy, loping trot, which he was able to maintain without
fatigue from rise of morn till set of sun. But the same strange
impulse which sent him into the settlement to inquire concerning
his friends, still kept them in his thoughts.</p>

<p>But he was not the youth to torment himself in this manner, hour
after hour, and he finally compressed his thin lips and muttered:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot will return in a few days, and then, if his brothers
are still gone, he will hunt for them."</p>

<p>This was not a satisfactory conclusion, but he followed it with
his usual promptness. He was in the very act of rising from the
ground, when his quick ear caught a faint footfall. Like a flash
he raised his head, and observed a noble buck approaching the
water with the purpose of drinking from it. It was not to be expected
that the animal had any fear of hunters in such a solitary place,
and he came forward with a proud step, as though master of the
wilderness.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe waited until he was within fifty feet, when the
buck stopped short, and threw up his head as though he scented
danger in the air. At that instant Deerfoot bounded to his feet
as if thrown upward by a spring-board, and with a slight whoop,
dashed straight at the animal, swinging his arms and jumping from
side to side in the most grotesque fashion.</p>

<p>Few animals of the forest are more timid than the deer, which,
like the bear, is found in almost every portion of the American
continent. The buck with one swift whirl on his hoofs, faced the
other way, and was off like an arrow, shooting between the trees,
through the undergrowth, and bounding over obstructions as though
they were not worth his notice. The ordinary hunter might have
found time to fire one shot, when the game would have vanished
like a bird on the wing, before he could reload; but the occasion
was a good one for Deerfoot to display his wonderful fleetness,
and he was in the mood to do so. He had made his gestures and
uttered his cries for the very purpose of terrifying the animal
into doing his utmost, and he did it.</p>

<p>With his head thrown back, so that his antlers almost rested
on his back, he plunged forward with amazing swiftness; but when
he had gone two hundred yards, he saw the same light, willowy
figure almost on his haunch. He even flung up his arms and shouted
again, as if urging him to a higher rate of speed. And such was
the truth; Deerfoot was running as fast as the game, and he was
able to run still faster.</p>

<p>The buck bounded up a steep slope, and with one tremendous leap
cleared a craggy rock in his path. He had barely done so, when
the young Shawanoe was after him, going over with a lightness
and grace that showed no special effort. The pursuer was on his
haunches, and the animal, with glaring eyeballs and a horrified
sniff, seemed to bound off with the speed of the wind. But of
what avail? The warrior was not to be shaken off. With a speed
which none of his race could equal, it was only play for him to
outrun the deer. Years before (as I have told in another place),
Deerfoot, for mere sport, pursued one of the fleetest of horses,
and kept it up hour after hour, until he ran down the steed. He
was doing the same to the buck. There was not a moment from the
first when he could not have launched an arrow that would have
brought the game to the ground; he was near enough to drive his
tomahawk into the neck, but he did nothing of that nature. Inasmuch
as he was running the race, he meant it should be a fair one,
and neither should take any advantage over the other.</p>

<p>What terrifying imaginings took possession of the buck when he
awoke to the fact that it was impossible to escape the dreadful
being clinging to his hips, cannot be understood by any of us,
but that which followed, incredible as it may seem, is an indisputable
fact.</p>

<p>The singular race was kept up for slightly more than a mile,
during every fraction of which the fugitive put forth his highest
possible effort. Such a terrific strain cannot fail to tell upon
the most highly trained animal, and so, despite all he could do,
the buck found himself unable to keep up his prodigious tension.
He was losing ground, and he could not fail to know that escape
was out of the question: he was as much doomed as if surrounded
and driven at bay by a dozen hunters and their hounds. He was
still running at his highest bent, when he suddenly deviated to
the right, and, with shocking violence, plunged squarely against
the trunk of a beech, and, falling over on his side, gave a few
convulsive struggles and died. Beyond question, the buck, when
awake to the fact that there was no hope for him, deliberately
committed suicide by breaking his neck.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe paused, and looked down upon the quivering
form with feelings of pity.</p>

<p>"Why did he do that? Deerfoot felt too much sorrow to harm him;
he only sought to show him he could run the faster; but he will
run no more, and Deerfoot will eat."</p>

<p>The spot was suitable, and, within less time than would be supposed,
the warrior was seated on the ground, deliberately masticating
a liberal slice of broiled venison. Doubtless it would have been
improved could he have hung it in a cellar or tree for several
days, but it wasn't convenient to do so, and Deerfoot therefore
ate it as he could obtain it, and was satisfied therewith.</p>

<p>No water was within reach, the Indian following the healthful
practice of the wild animals themselves, of not partaking of drink
while eating food.</p>

<p>The meal finished, Deerfoot did not conduct himself like one
who was still in doubt as to the course he ought to follow. He
had solved the question earlier in the day, and, though the conclusion
he reached was not fully satisfactory, he resolutely forced aside
all further thought respecting it, and gave his attention simply
to that which was before him. His dinner required only a short
time, when he resumed his journey, if such it may be termed. He
walked with his usual noiseless gait, in which could be detected
not the slightest weakness or exhaustion resulting from his terrific
run.</p>

<p>The young Shawanoe was advancing toward the mountainous portion
of the present State of Missouri. The Ozark range, or its spurs,
cover one-half of that large State, and their recesses afford
hunting grounds and retreats such as are surpassed by no other
portion of the continent.</p>

<p>Deerfoot turned his footsteps toward a high promontory some miles
distant. It was the most elevated among many others, and formed
a landmark visible over a very extensive area. The youthful warrior
did not hasten his footsteps, for there was no call to do so,
but he steadily approached the mountain, up which he tramped in
his leisurely fashion, until he paused on the very highest point.</p>

<p>The journey was long, and when he came to a halt the sun was
far down the western horizon. The summit of the mountain was covered
with rocks and boulders, with here and there a few scrubby pines.
Nothing could be more unattractive than the broken, stony soil,
but the view which was spread out before him who climbed to the
top was enough to kindle the eye of a stoic, and make the heart
overflow with love and awe toward the great Being who made it
all.</p>

<p>But the eye can become accustomed to the grandest scenes, and,
although Deerfoot leaned on the rock beside him, and allowed his
keen vision to wander over the magnificent panorama, it did not
cause an additional pulse-beat. When he had glanced at the mountains,
the valleys between, the broken country, the forests, the diversified
scenery in every direction, his gaze rested on another promontory
similar to the one he had climbed.</p>

<p>It was several miles distant, in a directly southern course,
and was nearly or quite two hundred feet higher than the one on
which he stood. The latter, like those to which reference has
been made, was of the nature of a ridge, while the one on which
his eyes were fixed was a diminutive Teneriffe as to its form.</p>

<p>While the manner of Deerfoot indicated very plainly that he expected
to see something out of the usual order of things, yet it looked
very much as if he would have been pleased over his failure to
do so. No painter could limn a more striking picture than that
which was formed by Deerfoot, at the close of that beautiful spring
day, when, as the sun was setting, he stood on the elevation and
gazed across the intervening country.</p>

<p>His right elbow rested on the top of the rock, and his right
leg supported the weight of his body. The lower half of the left
leg was slung across the other, the toe of the moccasin touching
the earth. The right hand dropped over the side of the rock, and
lightly held the long bow which leaned against the same support.
The posture was that of elegant ease, and the best calculated
to bring out in clear relief the Apollo-like splendor of his figure.
The luxuriant black hair streaming over the shoulders, the gaudy
eagle feathers thrust in at the crown, the lustrous black eyes,
the slightly Roman nose, the rows of colored beads around the
neck, the dull yellow of the hunting shirt, the quiver of arrows
behind the right shoulder, the red sash, holding knife and tomahawk,
the gold bracelet on the left wrist, the fringed border of his
hunting shirt about the knees, the brilliant fringes to the leggings,
the pretty moccasins, and the shapeliness of form, limb and feature&mdash;all
these made up the poetical Indian, which, sad to say, is almost
as rare among his race as the black diamond is in nature.</p>

<p>But such was Deerfoot the Shawanoe.</p>
