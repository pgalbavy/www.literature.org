So here is the world with us again, and our sentimental excursion
is over. In the front of the Rufus Stone Hotel conceive a
remarkable collection of wheeled instruments, watched over by
Dangle and Phipps in grave and stately attitudes, and by the
driver of a stylish dogcart from Ringwood. In the garden behind,
in an attitude of nervous prostration, Mr. Hoopdriver was seated
on a rustic seat. Through the open window of a private
sitting-room came a murmur of voices, as of men and women in
conference. Occasionally something that might have been a girlish
sob.
<P>
"I fail to see what status Widgery has," says Dangle, "thrusting
himself in there."
<P>
"He takes too much upon himself," said Phipps.
<P>
"I've been noticing little things, yesterday and to-day," said
Dangle, and stopped.
<P>
"They went to the cathedral together in the afternoon."
<P>
"Financially it would be a good thing for her, of course," said
Dangle, with a gloomy magnanimity.
<P>
He felt drawn to Phipps now by the common trouble, in spite of
the man's chequered legs. "Financially it wouldn't be half bad."
<P>
"He's so dull and heavy," said Phipps.
<P>
Meanwhile, within, the clergyman had, by promptitude and
dexterity, taken the chair and was opening the case against the
unfortunate Jessie. I regret to have to say that my heroine had
been appalled by the visible array of public opinion against her
excursion, to the pitch of tears. She was sitting with flushed
cheeks and swimming eyes at the end of the table opposite to the
clergyman. She held her handkerchief crumpled up in her extended
hand. Mrs. Milton sat as near to her as possible, and
occasionally made little dabs with her hand at Jessie's hand, to
indicate forgiveness. These advances were not reciprocated, which
touched Widgery very much. The lady in green, Miss Mergle (B.
A.), sat on the opposite side near the clergyman. She was the
strong-minded schoolmistress to whom Jessie had written, and who
had immediately precipitated the pursuit upon her. She had picked
up the clergyman in Ringwood, and had told him everything
forthwith, having met him once at a British Association meeting.
He had immediately constituted himself administrator of the
entire business. Widgery, having been foiled in an attempt to
conduct the proceedings, stood with his legs wide apart in front
of the fireplace ornament, and looked profound and sympathetic.
Jessie's account of her adventures was a chary one and given
amidst frequent interruptions. She surprised herself by skilfully
omitting any allusion to the Bechamel episode. She completely
exonerated Hoopdriver from the charge of being more than an
accessory to her escapade. But public feeling was heavy against
Hoopdriver. Her narrative was inaccurate and sketchy, but happily
the others were too anxious to pass opinions to pin her down to
particulars. At last they had all the facts they would permit.
<P>
"My dear young lady," said the clergyman, "I can only ascribe
this extravagant and regrettable expedition of yours to the
wildest misconceptions of your place in the world and of your
duties and responsibilities. Even now, it seems to me, your
present emotion is due not so much to a real and sincere
penitence for your disobedience and folly as to a positive
annoyance at our most fortunate interference--"
<P>
"Not that," said Mrs. Milton, in a low tone. "Not that."
<P>
"But WHY did she go off like this?" said Widgery. "That's what
_I_ want to know."
<P>
Jessie made an attempt to speak, but Mrs. Milton said "Hush!" and
the ringing tenor of the clergyman rode triumphantly over the
meeting. "I cannot understand this spirit of unrest that has
seized upon the more intelligent portion of the feminine
community. You had a pleasant home, a most refined and
intelligent lady in the position of your mother, to cherish and
protect you--"
<P>
"If I HAD a mother," gulped Jessie, succumbing to the obvious
snare of self-pity, and sobbing.
<P>
"To cherish, protect, and advise you. And you must needs go out
of it all alone into a strange world of unknown dangers-"
<P>
"I wanted to learn," said Jessie.
<P>
"You wanted to learn. May you never have anything to UNlearn."
<P>
"AH!" from Mrs. Milton, very sadly.
<P>
"It isn't fair for all of you to argue at me at once," submitted
Jessie, irrelevantly.
<P>
"A world full of unknown dangers," resumed the clergyman. "Your
proper place was surely the natural surroundings that are part of
you. You have been unduly influenced, it is only too apparent, by
a class of literature which, with all due respect to
distinguished authoress that shall be nameless, I must call the
New Woman Literature. In that deleterious ingredient of our book
boxes--"
<P>
"I don't altogether agree with you there," said Miss Mergle,
throwing her head back and regarding him firmly through her
spectacles, and Mr. Widgery coughed.
<P>
"What HAS all this to do with me?" asked Jessie, availing herself
of the interruption.
<P>
"The point is," said Mrs. Milton, on her defence, "that in my
books--"
<P>
"All I want to do," said Jessie, "is to go about freely by
myself. Girls do so in America. Why not here?"
<P>
"Social conditions are entirely different in America," said Miss
Mergle. "Here we respect Class Distinctions."
<P>
"It's very unfortunate. What I want to know is, why I cannot go
away for a holiday if I want to."
<P>
"With a strange young man, socially your inferior," said Widgery,
and made her flush by his tone.
<P>
"Why not?" she said. "With anybody." 
<P>
"They don't do that, even in America," said Miss Mergle.
<P>
"My dear young lady," said the clergyman, "the most elementary
principles of decorum--A day will come when you will better
understand how entirely subservient your ideas are to the very
fundamentals of our present civilisation, when you will better
understand the harrowing anxiety you have given Mrs. Milton by
this inexplicable flight of yours. We can only put things down at
present, in charity, to your ignorance--"
<P>
"You have to consider the general body of opinion, too," said
Widgery.
<P>
"Precisely," said Miss Mergle. "There is no such thing as conduct
in the absolute." "If once this most unfortunate business gets
about," said the clergyman, "it will do you infinite harm."
<P>
"But I'VE done nothing wrong. Why should I be responsible for
other people's--"
<P>
"The world has no charity," said Mrs. Milton.
<P>
"For a girl," said Jessie. "No."
<P>
"Now do let us stop arguing, my dear young lady, and let us
listen to reason. Never mind how or why, this conduct of yours
will do you infinite harm, if once it is generally known. And not
only that, it will cause infinite pain to those who care for you.
But if you will return at once to your home, causing it to be
understood that you have been with friends for these last few
days--"
<P>
"Tell lies," said Jessie. "Certainly not. Most certainly not. But
I understand that is how your absence is understood at present,
and there is no reason--"
<P>
Jessie's grip tightened on her handkerchief. "I won't go back,"
she said, "to have it as I did before. I want a room of my own,
what books I need to read, to be free to go out by myself alone,
Teaching--"
<P>
"Anything," said Mrs. Milton ,"anything in reason."
<P>
"But will you keep your promise?" said Jessie.
<P>
"Surely you won't dictate to your mother!" said Widgery.
<P>
"My stepmother! I don't want to dictate. I want definite promises
now."
<P>
"This is most unreasonable," said the clergyman. "Very well,"
said Jessie, swallowing a sob but with unusual resolution. "Then
I won't go back. My life is being frittered away--"
<P>
"LET her have her way," said Widgery.
<P>
"A room then. All your Men. I'm not to come down and talk away
half my days--"
<P>
"My dear child, if only to save you," said Mrs. Milton. "If you
don't keep your promise--"
<P>
"Then I take it the matter is practically concluded," said the
clergyman. "And that you very properly submit to return to your
proper home. And now, if I may offer a suggestion, it is that we
take tea. Freed of its tannin, nothing, I think, is more
refreshing and stimulating." 
<P>
"There's a train from Lyndhurst at thirteen minutes to six," said
Widgery, unfolding a time table. "That gives us about half an
hour or three-quarters here--if a conveyance is obtainable, that
is."
<P>
"A gelatine lozenge dropped into the tea cup precipitates the
tannin in the form of tannate of gelatine," said the clergyman to
Miss Mergle, in a confidential bray.
<P>
Jessie stood up, and saw through the window a depressed head and
shoulders over the top of the back of a garden seat. She moved
towards the door. "While you have tea, mother," she said, "I must
tell Mr. Hoopdriver of our arrangements."
<P>
"Don't you think I--" began the clergyman.
<P>
"No," said Jessie, very rudely; "I don't."
<P>
"But, Jessie, haven't you already--"
<P>
"You are already breaking the capitulation," said Jessie.
<P>
"Will you want the whole half hour?" said Widgery, at the bell. 
<P>
"Every minute," said Jessie, in the doorway. "He's behaved very
nobly to me."
<P>
"There's tea," said Widgery.
<P>
"I've had tea."
<P>
"He may not have behaved badly," said the clergyman. "But he's
certainly an astonishingly weak person to let a wrong-headed
young girl--"
<P>
Jessie closed the door into the garden.
<P>
<P>
Meanwhile Mr. Hoopdriver made a sad figure in the sunlight
outside. It was over, this wonderful excursion of his, so far as
she was concerned, and with the swift blow that separated them,
he realised all that those days had done for him. He tried to
grasp the bearings of their position. Of course, they would take
her away to those social altitudes of hers. She would become an
inaccessible young lady again. Would they let him say good-bye to
her?
<P>
How extraordinary it had all been! He recalled the moment when he
had first seen her riding, with the sunlight behind her, along
the riverside road; he recalled that wonderful night at Bognor,
remembering it as if everything had been done of his own
initiative. "Brave, brave!" she had called him. And afterwards,
when she came down to him in the morning, kindly, quiet. But
ought he to have persuaded her then to return to her home? He
remembered some intention of the sort. Now these people snatched
her away from him as though he was scarcely fit to live in the
same world with her. No more he was! He felt he had presumed upon
her worldly ignorance in travelling with her day after day. She
was so dainty, so delightful, so serene. He began to recapitulate
her expressions, the light of her eyes, the turn of her face . .
.
<P>
He wasn't good enough to walk in the same road with her. Nobody
was. Suppose they let him say good-bye to her; what could he say?
That? But they were sure not to let her talk to him alone; her
mother would be there as--what was it? Chaperone. He'd never once
had a chance of saying what he felt; indeed, it was only now he
was beginning to realise what he felt. Love I he wouldn't
presume. It was worship. If only he could have one more chance.
He must have one more chance, somewhere, somehow. Then he would
pour out his soul to her eloquently. He felt eloquently, and
words would come. He was dust under her feet . . .
<P>
His meditation was interrupted by the click of a door handle, and
Jessie appeared in the sunlight under the verandah. "Come away
from here," she said to Hoopdriver, as he rose to meet her. "I'm
going home with them. We have to say good-bye."
<P>
Mr. Hoopdriver winced, opened and shut his mouth, and rose
without a word.
