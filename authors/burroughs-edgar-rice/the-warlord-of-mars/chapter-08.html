<article class="w3-container w3-justify">

Straight toward the north, day and night, our destination compass
led us after the fleeing flier upon which it had remained set
since I first attuned it after leaving the thern fortress.
<P>
Early in the second night we noticed the air becoming
perceptibly colder, and from the distance we had come
from the equator were assured that we were rapidly
approaching the north arctic region.
<P>
My knowledge of the efforts that had been made by countless
expeditions to explore that unknown land bade me to caution,
for never had flier returned who had passed to any considerable
distance beyond the mighty ice-barrier that fringes the southern
hem of the frigid zone.
<P>
What became of them none knew--only that they passed forever out of
the sight of man into that grim and mysterious country of the pole.
<P>
The distance from the barrier to the pole was no more than a swift
flier should cover in a few hours, and so it was assumed that some
frightful catastrophe awaited those who reached the "forbidden land,"
as it had come to be called by the Martians of the outer world.
<P>
Thus it was that I went more slowly as we approached the barrier,
for it was my intention to move cautiously by day over the ice-pack
that I might discover, before I had run into a trap, if there really
lay an inhabited country at the north pole, for there only could I
imagine a spot where Matai Shang might feel secure from John Carter,
Prince of Helium.
<P>
We were flying at a snail's pace but a few feet above the
ground--literally feeling our way along through the darkness, for
both moons had set, and the night was black with the clouds that
are to be found only at Mars's two extremities.
<P>
Suddenly a towering wall of white rose directly in our path,
and though I threw the helm hard over, and reversed our engine,
I was too late to avoid collision. With a sickening crash we
struck the high looming obstacle three-quarters on.
<P>
The flier reeled half over; the engine stopped; as one, the
patched buoyancy tanks burst, and we plunged, headforemost,
to the ground twenty feet beneath.
<P>
Fortunately none of us was injured, and when we had disentangled
ourselves from the wreckage, and the lesser moon had burst again
from below the horizon, we found that we were at the foot of a
mighty ice-barrier, from which outcropped great patches of the
granite hills which hold it from encroaching farther toward the south.
<P>
What fate!  With the journey all but completed to be thus
wrecked upon the wrong side of that precipitous and unscalable wall
of rock and ice!
<P>
I looked at Thuvan Dihn.  He but shook his head dejectedly.
<P>
The balance of the night we spent shivering in our inadequate sleeping
silks and furs upon the snow that lies at the foot of the ice-barrier.
<P>
With daylight my battered spirits regained something of their
accustomed hopefulness, though I must admit that there was little
enough for them to feed upon.
<P>
"What shall we do?" asked Thuvan Dihn.  "How may we pass that
which is impassable?"
<P>
"First we must disprove its impassability," I replied.
"Nor shall I admit that it is impassable before I have
followed its entire circle and stand again upon this spot,
defeated.  The sooner we start, the better, for I see no
other way, and it will take us more than a month to travel
the weary, frigid miles that lie before us."
<P>
For five days of cold and suffering and privation we traversed
the rough and frozen way which lies at the foot of the ice-barrier.
Fierce, fur-bearing creatures attacked us by daylight and by dark.
Never for a moment were we safe from the sudden charge of some huge
demon of the north.
<P>
The apt was our most consistent and dangerous foe.
<P>
It is a huge, white-furred creature with six limbs, four of which,
short and heavy, carry it swiftly over the snow and ice;
while the other two, growing forward from its shoulders on either
side of its long, powerful neck, terminate in white, hairless hands,
with which it seizes and holds its prey.
<P>
Its head and mouth are more similar in appearance to those of
a hippopotamus than to any other earthly animal, except that from
the sides of the lower jawbone two mighty horns curve slightly
downward toward the front.
<P>
Its two huge eyes inspired my greatest curiosity.  They extend
in two vast, oval patches from the center of the top of the cranium
down either side of the head to below the roots of the horns, so
that these weapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes,
which are composed of several thousand ocelli each.
<P>
This eye structure seemed remarkable in a beast whose haunts
were upon a glaring field of ice and snow, and though I found upon
minute examination of several that we killed that each ocellus is
furnished with its own lid, and that the animal can at will close
as many of the facets of his huge eyes as he chooses, yet I was
positive that nature had thus equipped him because much of his life
was to be spent in dark, subterranean recesses.
<P>
Shortly after this we came upon the hugest apt that we had seen.
The creature stood fully eight feet at the shoulder, and was
so sleek and clean and glossy that I could have sworn that he had
but recently been groomed.
<P>
He stood head-on eyeing us as we approached him, for we had found
it a waste of time to attempt to escape the perpetual bestial
rage which seems to possess these demon creatures, who rove the
dismal north attacking every living thing that comes within the
scope of their far-seeing eyes.
<P>
Even when their bellies are full and they can eat no more,
they kill purely for the pleasure which they derive from taking life,
and so when this particular apt failed to charge us, and instead
wheeled and trotted away as we neared him, I should have been
greatly surprised had I not chanced to glimpse the sheen of a
golden collar about its neck.
<P>
Thuvan Dihn saw it, too, and it carried the same message of
hope to us both.  Only man could have placed that collar there, and
as no race of Martians of which we knew aught ever had attempted to
domesticate the ferocious apt, he must belong to a people of the
north of whose very existence we were ignorant--possibly to the
fabled yellow men of Barsoom; that once powerful race which was
supposed to be extinct, though sometimes, by theorists,
thought still to exist in the frozen north.
<P>
Simultaneously we started upon the trail of the great beast.
Woola was quickly made to understand our desires, so that it was
unnecessary to attempt to keep in sight of the animal whose swift
flight over the rough ground soon put him beyond our vision.
<P>
For the better part of two hours the trail paralleled the barrier,
and then suddenly turned toward it through the roughest
and seemingly most impassable country I ever had beheld.
<P>
Enormous granite boulders blocked the way on every hand; deep
rifts in the ice threatened to engulf us at the least misstep;
and from the north a slight breeze wafted to our nostrils an
unspeakable stench that almost choked us.
<P>
For another two hours we were occupied in traversing a few
hundred yards to the foot of the barrier.
<P>
Then, turning about the corner of a wall-like outcropping of
granite, we came upon a smooth area of two or three acres before
the base of the towering pile of ice and rock that had baffled us
for days, and before us beheld the dark and cavernous mouth of a cave.
<P>
From this repelling portal the horrid stench was emanating,
and as Thuvan Dihn espied the place he halted with an exclamation
of profound astonishment.
<P>
"By all my ancestors!" he ejaculated.  "That I should have
lived to witness the reality of the fabled Carrion Caves!
If these indeed be they, we have found a way beyond the ice-barrier.
<P>
"The ancient chronicles of the first historians of Barsoom--so
ancient that we have for ages considered them mythology--record the
passing of the yellow men from the ravages of the green hordes that
overran Barsoom as the drying up of the great oceans drove the
dominant races from their strongholds.
<P>
"They tell of the wanderings of the remnants of this once powerful race,
harassed at every step, until at last they found a way through the
ice-barrier of the north to a fertile valley at the pole.
<P>
"At the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their
haven of refuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow
men were victorious, and within the caves that gave ingress
to their new home they piled the bodies of the dead, both yellow
and green, that the stench might warn away their enemies from
further pursuit.
<P>
"And ever since that long-gone day have the dead of this fabled
land been carried to the Carrion Caves, that in death and decay
they might serve their country and warn away invading enemies.
Here, too, is brought, so the fable runs, all the waste
stuff of the nation--everything that is subject to rot, and that
can add to the foul stench that assails our nostrils.
<P>
"And death lurks at every step among rotting dead, for here
the fierce apts lair, adding to the putrid accumulation with the
fragments of their own prey which they cannot devour.  It is a
horrid avenue to our goal, but it is the only one."
<P>
"You are sure, then, that we have found the way to the land
of the yellow men?" I cried.
<P>
"As sure as may be," he replied; "having only ancient legend
to support my belief.  But see how closely, so far, each detail
tallies with the world-old story of the hegira of the yellow race.
Yes, I am sure that we have discovered the way to their ancient
hiding place."
<P>
"If it be true, and let us pray that such may be the case," I said,
"then here may we solve the mystery of the disappearance of
Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, his son, for no
other spot upon Barsoom has remained unexplored by the many
expeditions and the countless spies that have been searching for
them for nearly two years.  The last word that came from them was
that they sought Carthoris, my own brave son, beyond the ice-barrier."
<P>
As we talked we had been approaching the entrance to the cave,
and as we crossed the threshold I ceased to wonder that the
ancient green enemies of the yellow men had been halted by the
horrors of that awful way.
<P>
The bones of dead men lay man high upon the broad floor of the
first cave, and over all was a putrid mush of decaying flesh,
through which the apts had beaten a hideous trail toward the
entrance to the second cave beyond.
<P>
The roof of this first apartment was low, like all that we
traversed subsequently, so that the foul odors were confined
and condensed to such an extent that they seemed to possess
tangible substance.  One was almost tempted to draw his
short-sword and hew his way through in search of pure air beyond.
<P>
"Can man breathe this polluted air and live?"
asked Thuvan Dihn, choking.
<P>
"Not for long, I imagine," I replied; "so let us make haste.
I will go first, and you bring up the rear, with Woola between.
Come," and with the words I dashed forward, across the fetid
mass of putrefaction.
<P>
It was not until we had passed through seven caves of different
sizes and varying but little in the power and quality of their
stenches that we met with any physical opposition.  Then, within
the eighth cave, we came upon a lair of apts.
<P>
A full score of the mighty beasts were disposed about the chamber.
Some were sleeping, while others tore at the fresh-killed carcasses
of new-brought prey, or fought among themselves in their love-making.
<P>
Here in the dim light of their subterranean home the value of
their great eyes was apparent, for these inner caves are shrouded
in perpetual gloom that is but little less than utter darkness.
<P>
To attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd
seemed, even to me, the height of folly, and so I proposed to
Thuvan Dihn that he return to the outer world with Woola, that the
two might find their way to civilization and come again with a
sufficient force to overcome not only the apts, but any further
obstacles that might lie between us and our goal.
<P>
"In the meantime," I continued, "I may discover some means of
winning my way alone to the land of the yellow men, but if I am
unsuccessful one life only will have been sacrificed.  Should we
all go on and perish, there will be none to guide a succoring party
to Dejah Thoris and your daughter."
<P>
"I shall not return and leave you here alone, John Carter,"
replied Thuvan Dihn.  "Whether you go on to victory or death,
the Jeddak of Ptarth remains at your side.  I have spoken."
<P>
I knew from his tone that it were useless to attempt to argue
the question, and so I compromised by sending Woola back with a
hastily penned note enclosed in a small metal case and fastened
about his neck.  I commanded the faithful creature to seek
Carthoris at Helium, and though half a world and countless
dangers lay between I knew that if the thing could be done Woola
would do it.
<P>
Equipped as he was by nature with marvelous speed and endurance,
and with frightful ferocity that made him a match for any single
enemy of the way, his keen intelligence and wondrous instinct
should easily furnish all else that was needed for the successful
accomplishment of his mission.
<P>
It was with evident reluctance that the great beast turned to leave
me in compliance with my command, and ere he had gone I could not
resist the inclination to throw my arms about his great neck in
a parting hug.  He rubbed his cheek against mine in a final caress,
and a moment later was speeding through the Carrion Caves toward
the outer world.
<P>
In my note to Carthoris I had given explicit directions for locating
the Carrion Caves, impressing upon him the necessity for making
entrance to the country beyond through this avenue, and not to attempt
under any circumstances to cross the ice-barrier with a fleet.
I told him that what lay beyond the eighth cave I could not
even guess; but I was sure that somewhere upon the other side of the
ice-barrier his mother lay in the power of Matai Shang, and that
possibly his grandfather and great-grandfather as well, if they lived.
<P>
Further, I advised him to call upon Kulan Tith and the son of
Thuvan Dihn for warriors and ships that the expedition might be
sufficiently strong to insure success at the first blow.
<P>
"And," I concluded, "if there be time bring Tars Tarkas with you,
for if I live until you reach me I can think of few greater pleasures
than to fight once more, shoulder to shoulder, with my old friend."
<P>
When Woola had left us Thuvan Dihn and I, hiding in the seventh cave,
discussed and discarded many plans for crossing the eighth chamber.
From where we stood we saw that the fighting among the apts was
growing less, and that many that had been feeding had ceased and
lain down to sleep.
<P>
Presently it became apparent that in a short time all the ferocious
monsters might be peacefully slumbering, and thus a hazardous
opportunity be presented to us to cross through their lair.
<P>
One by one the remaining brutes stretched themselves upon the
bubbling decomposition that covered the mass of bones upon
the floor of their den, until but a single apt remained awake.
This huge fellow roamed restlessly about, nosing among his
companion and the abhorrent litter of the cave.
<P>
Occasionally he would stop to peer intently toward first
one of the exits from the chamber and then the other.
His whole demeanor was as of one who acts as sentry.
<P>
We were at last forced to the belief that he would not sleep
while the other occupants of the lair slept, and so cast about in
our minds for some scheme whereby we might trick him.  Finally I
suggested a plan to Thuvan Dihn, and as it seemed as good as any
that we had discussed we decided to put it to the test.
<P>
To this end Thuvan Dihn placed himself close against the
cave's wall, beside the entrance to the eighth chamber, while I
deliberately showed myself to the guardian apt as he looked toward
our retreat.  Then I sprang to the opposite side of the entrance,
flattening my body close to the wall.
<P>
Without a sound the great beast moved rapidly toward the
seventh cave to see what manner of intruder had thus rashly
penetrated so far within the precincts of his habitation.
<P>
As he poked his head through the narrow aperture that connects
the two caves a heavy long-sword was awaiting him upon either hand,
and before he had an opportunity to emit even a single growl his
severed head rolled at our feet.
<P>
Quickly we glanced into the eighth chamber--not an apt had moved.
Crawling over the carcass of the huge beast that blocked the
doorway Thuvan Dihn and I cautiously entered the forbidding
and dangerous den.
<P>
Like snails we wound our silent and careful way among the
huge, recumbent forms.  The only sound above our breathing was
the sucking noise of our feet as we lifted them from the ooze of
decaying flesh through which we crept.
<P>
Halfway across the chamber and one of the mighty beasts
directly before me moved restlessly at the very instant that my
foot was poised above his head, over which I must step.
<P>
Breathlessly I waited, balancing upon one foot, for I did not
dare move a muscle.  In my right hand was my keen short-sword,
the point hovering an inch above the thick fur beneath which
beat the savage heart.
<P>
Finally the apt relaxed, sighing, as with the passing of a bad
dream, and resumed the regular respiration of deep slumber.
I planted my raised foot beyond the fierce head and an instant
later had stepped over the beast.
<P>
Thuvan Dihn followed directly after me, and another moment
found us at the further door, undetected.
<P>
The Carrion Caves consist of a series of twenty-seven
connecting chambers, and present the appearance of having been
eroded by running water in some far-gone age when a mighty river
found its way to the south through this single breach in the
barrier of rock and ice that hems the country of the pole.
<P>
Thuvan Dihn and I traversed the remaining nineteen caverns
without adventure or mishap.
<P>
We were afterward to learn that but once a month is it possible
to find all the apts of the Carrion Caves in a single chamber.
<P>
At other times they roam singly or in pairs in and out of the caves,
so that it would have been practically impossible for two men to
have passed through the entire twenty-seven chambers without
encountering an apt in nearly every one of them.  Once a month
they sleep for a full day, and it was our good fortune to stumble
by accident upon one of these occasions.
<P>
Beyond the last cave we emerged into a desolate country of
snow and ice, but found a well-marked trail leading north.
The way was boulder-strewn, as had been that south of the barrier,
so that we could see but a short distance ahead of us at any time.
<P>
After a couple of hours we passed round a huge boulder to come
to a steep declivity leading down into a valley.
<P>
Directly before us we saw a half dozen men--fierce, black-bearded
fellows, with skins the color of a ripe lemon.
<P>
"The yellow men of Barsoom!" ejaculated Thuvan Dihn, as though
even now that he saw them he found it scarce possible to believe
that the very race we expected to find hidden in this remote and
inaccessible land did really exist.
<P>
We withdrew behind an adjacent boulder to watch the actions of the
little party, which stood huddled at the foot of another huge rock,
their backs toward us.
<P>
One of them was peering round the edge of the granite mass as
though watching one who approached from the opposite side.
<P>
Presently the object of his scrutiny came within the range
of my vision and I saw that it was another yellow man.  All
were clothed in magnificent furs--the six in the black and yellow
striped hide of the orluk, while he who approached alone was
resplendent in the pure white skin of an apt.
<P>
The yellow men were armed with two swords, and a short javelin
was slung across the back of each, while from their left arms hung
cuplike shields no larger than a dinner plate, the concave sides of
which turned outward toward an antagonist.
<P>
They seemed puny and futile implements of safety against an
even ordinary swordsman, but I was later to see the purpose of them
and with what wondrous dexterity the yellow men manipulate them.
<P>
One of the swords which each of the warriors carried caught my
immediate attention.  I call it a sword, but really it was a sharp-
edged blade with a complete hook at the far end.
<P>
The other sword was of about the same length as the hooked
instrument, and somewhere between that of my long-sword and my
short-sword.  It was straight and two-edged.  In addition to the
weapons I have ennumerated each man carried a dagger in his harness.
<P>
As the white-furred one approached, the six grasped their
swords more firmly--the hooked instrument in the left hand, the
straight sword in the right, while above the left wrist the small
shield was held rigid upon a metal bracelet.
<P>
As the lone warrior came opposite them the six rushed out upon
him with fiendish yells that resembled nothing more closely than
the savage war cry of the Apaches of the South-west.
<P>
Instantly the attacked drew both his swords, and as the six fell
upon him I witnessed as pretty fighting as one might care to see.
<P>
With their sharp hooks the combatants attempted to take hold of an
adversary, but like lightning the cupshaped shield would spring
before the darting weapon and into its hollow the hook would plunge.
<P>
Once the lone warrior caught an antagonist in the side with
his hook, and drawing him close ran his sword through him.
<P>
But the odds were too unequal, and, though he who fought alone
was by far the best and bravest of them all, I saw that it was
but a question of time before the remaining five would find an
opening through his marvelous guard and bring him down.
<P>
Now my sympathies have ever been with the weaker side of an argument,
and though I knew nothing of the cause of the trouble I could not
stand idly by and see a brave man butchered by superior numbers.
<P>
As a matter of fact I presume I gave little attention to
seeking an excuse, for I love a good fight too well to need any
other reason for joining in when one is afoot.
<P>
So it was that before Thuvan Dihn knew what I was about he saw
me standing by the side of the white-clad yellow man, battling like
mad with his five adversaries.
