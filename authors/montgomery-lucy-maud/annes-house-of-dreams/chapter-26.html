"I'm so sorry Gilbert is away," said Anne.  "He had to
go--Allan Lyons at the Glen has met with a serious
accident.  He will not likely be home till very late. 
But he told me to tell you he'd be up and over early
enough in the morning to see you before you left.  It's
too provoking.  Susan and I had planned such a nice
little jamboree for your last night here."
<P>
She was sitting beside the garden brook on the little
rustic seat Gilbert had built.  Owen Ford stood before
her, leaning against the bronze column of a yellow
birch.  He was very pale and his face bore the marks of
the preceding sleepless night.  Anne, glancing up at
him, wondered if, after all, his summer had brought him
the strength it should.  Had he worked too hard over
his book?  She remembered that for a week he had not
been looking well.
<P>
"I'm rather glad the doctor is away," said Owen
slowly.  "I wanted to see you alone, Mrs. Blythe. 
There is something I must tell somebody, or I think it
will drive me mad.  I've been trying for a week to look
it in the face--and I can't.  I know I can trust
you--and, besides, you will understand.  A woman with
eyes like yours always understands.  You are one of the
folks people instinctively tell things to.  Mrs.
Blythe, I love Leslie.  LOVE her!  That seems too weak
a word!"
<P>
His voice suddenly broke with the suppressed passion of
his utterance.  He turned his head away and hid his
face on his arm.  His whole form shook.  Anne sat
looking at him, pale and aghast.  She had never
thought of this!  And yet--how was it she had never
thought of it?  It now seemed a natural and inevitable
thing.  She wondered at her own blindness. 
But--but--things like this did not happen in Four
Winds.  Elsewhere in the world human passions might set
at defiance human conventions and laws--but not HERE,
surely.  Leslie had kept summer boarders off and on for
ten years, and nothing like this had happened.  But
perhaps they had not been like Owen Ford; and the
vivid, LIVING Leslie of this summer was not the cold,
sullen girl of other years.  Oh, SOMEBODY should have
thought of this!  Why hadn't Miss Cornelia thought of
it?  Miss Cornelia was always ready enough to sound the
alarm where men were concerned. Anne felt an
unreasonable resentment against Miss Cornelia.  Then
she gave a little inward groan.  No matter who was to
blame the mischief was done.  And Leslie--what of
Leslie?  It was for Leslie Anne felt most concerned.
<P>
"Does Leslie know this, Mr. Ford?" she asked quietly.
<P>
"No--no,--unless she has guessed it.  You surely don't
think I'd be cad and scoundrel enough to tell her, Mrs.
Blythe.  I couldn't help loving her--that's all--and my
misery is greater than I can bear."
<P>
"Does SHE care?" asked Anne.  The moment the question
crossed her lips she felt that she should not have
asked it.  Owen Ford answered it with overeager
protest.
<P>
"No--no, of course not.  But I could make her care if
she were free--I know I could."
<P>
"She does care--and he knows it," thought Anne.  Aloud
she said, sympathetically but decidedly:
<P>
"But she is not free, Mr. Ford.  And the only thing you
can do is to go away in silence and leave her to her
own life."
<P>
"I know--I know," groaned Owen.  He sat down on the
grassy bank and stared moodily into the amber water
beneath him.  "I know there's nothing to do--nothing
but to say conventionally, `Good- bye, Mrs. Moore. 
Thank you for all your kindness to me this summer,'
just as I would have said it to the sonsy, bustling,
keen-eyed housewife I expected her to be when I came. 
Then I'll pay my board money like any honest boarder
and go!  Oh, it's very simple.  No doubt--no
perplexity--a straight road to the end of the world!
<P>
And I'll walk it--you needn't fear that I won't, Mrs.
Blythe.  But it would be easier to walk over red-hot
ploughshares."
<P>
Anne flinched with the pain of his voice.  And there
was so little she could say that would be adequate to
the situation.  Blame was out of the question--advice
was not needed--sympathy was mocked by the man's stark
agony.  She could only feel with him in a maze of
compassion and regret.  Her heart ached for Leslie! 
Had not that poor girl suffered enough without this?
<P>
"It wouldn't be so hard to go and leave her if she were
only happy," resumed Owen passionately.  "But to think
of her living death--to realise what it is to which I
do leave her!  THAT is the worst of all.  I would give
my life to make her happy--and I can do nothing even to
help her--nothing.  She is bound forever to that poor
wretch--with nothing to look forward to but growing old
in a succession of empty, meaningless, barren years. 
It drives me mad to think of it.  But I must go through
my life, never seeing her, but always knowing what she
is enduring.  It's hideous--hideous!"
<P>
"It is very hard," said Anne sorrowfully.  "We--her
friends here--all know how hard it is for her."
<P>
"And she is so richly fitted for life," said Owen
rebelliously.
<P>
"Her beauty is the least of her dower--and she is the
most beautiful woman I've ever known.  That laugh of
hers!  I've angled all summer to evoke that laugh, just
for the delight of hearing it.  And her eyes-- they are
as deep and blue as the gulf out there.  I never saw
such blueness--and gold!  Did you ever see her hair
down, Mrs. Blythe?"
<P>
"No."
<P>
"I did--once.  I had gone down to the Point to go
fishing with Captain Jim but it was too rough to go
out, so I came back.  She had taken the opportunity of
what she expected to be an afternoon alone to wash her
hair, and she was standing on the veranda in the
sunshine to dry it.  It fell all about her to her feet
in a fountain of living gold.  When she saw me she
hurried in, and the wind caught her hair and swirled it
all around her--Danae in her cloud.  Somehow, just then
the knowledge that I loved her came home to me--and
realised that I had loved her from the moment I first
saw her standing against the darkness in that glow of
light.  And she must live on here--petting and soothing
Dick, pinching and saving for a mere existence, while I
spend my life longing vainly for her, and debarred, by
that very fact, from even giving her the little help a
friend might.  I walked the shore last night, almost
till dawn, and thrashed it all out over and over again. 
And yet, in spite of everything, I can't find it in my
heart to be sorry that I came to Four Winds.  It seems
to me that, bad as everything is, it would be still
worse never to have known Leslie.  It's burning,
searing pain to love her and leave her--but not to have
loved her is unthinkable.  I suppose all this sounds
very crazy--all these terrible emotions always do sound
foolish when we put them into our inadequate words. 
They are not meant to be spoken--only felt and endured. 
I shouldn't have spoken--but it has helped-- some.  At
least, it has given me strength to go away respectably
tomorrow morning, without making a scene.  You'll write
me now and then, won't you, Mrs. Blythe, and give me
what news there is to give of her?"
<P>
"Yes," said Anne.  "Oh, I'm so sorry you are
going--we'll miss you so--we've all been such friends! 
If it were not for this you could come back other
summers.  Perhaps, even yet--by-and-by--when you've
forgotten, perhaps--"
<P>
"I shall never forget--and I shall never come back to
Four Winds," said Owen briefly.
<P>
Silence and twilight fell over the garden.  Far away
the sea was lapping gently and monotonously on the bar. 
The wind of evening in the poplars sounded like some
sad, weird, old rune--some broken dream of old
memories.  A slender shapely young aspen rose up before
them against the fine maize and emerald and paling rose
of the western sky, which brought out every leaf and
twig in dark, tremulous, elfin loveliness.
<P>
"Isn't that beautiful?" said Owen, pointing to it with
the air of a man who puts a certain conversation behind
him.
<P>
"It's so beautiful that it hurts me," said Anne
softly.  "Perfect things like that always did hurt
me--I remember I called it `the queer ache' when I was
a child.  What is the reason that pain like this seems
inseparable from perfection?  Is it the pain of
finality--when we realise that there can be nothing
beyond but retrogression?"
<P>
"Perhaps," said Owen dreamily, "it is the prisoned
infinite in us calling out to its kindred infinite as
expressed in that visible perfection."
<P>
"You seem to have a cold in the head.  Better rub some
tallow on your nose when you go to bed," said Miss
Cornelia, who had come in through the little gate
between the firs in time to catch Owen's last remark. 
Miss Cornelia liked Owen; but it was a matter of
principle with her to visit any "high-falutin"
language from a man with a snub.
<P>
Miss Cornelia personated the comedy that ever peeps
around the corner at the tragedy of life.  Anne, whose
nerves had been rather strained, laughed hysterically,
and even Owen smiled.  Certainly, sentiment and
passion had a way of shrinking out of sight in Miss
Cornelia's presence.  And yet to Anne nothing seemed
quite as hopeless and dark and painful as it had seemed
a few moments before.  But sleep was far from her eyes
that night.
