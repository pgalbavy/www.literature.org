<p>
O ye! who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Holland, France, England, Germany, or Spain,<br/>
I pray ye flog them upon all occasions,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It mends their morals, never mind the pain:<br/>
The best of mothers and of educations<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In Juan's case were but employ'd in vain,<br/>
Since, in a way that 's rather of the oddest, he<br/>
Became divested of his native modesty.

</p>
<p>
Had he but been placed at a public school,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the third form, or even in the fourth,<br/>
His daily task had kept his fancy cool,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least, had he been nurtured in the north;<br/>
Spain may prove an exception to the rule,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then exceptions always prove its worth&mdash;<br/>
A lad of sixteen causing a divorce<br/>
Puzzled his tutors very much, of course.

</p>
<p>
I can't say that it puzzles me at all,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If all things be consider'd: first, there was<br/>
His lady&mdash;mother, mathematical,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>A&mdash;</em>never mind; his tutor, an old ass;<br/>
A pretty woman (that 's quite natural,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else the thing had hardly come to pass);<br/>
A husband rather old, not much in unity<br/>
With his young wife&mdash;a time, and opportunity.

</p>
<p>
Well&mdash;well, the world must turn upon its axis,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all mankind turn with it, heads or tails,<br/>
And live and die, make love and pay our taxes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And as the veering wind shifts, shift our sails;<br/>
The king commands us, and the doctor quacks us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The priest instructs, and so our life exhales,<br/>
A little breath, love, wine, ambition, fame,<br/>
Fighting, devotion, dust,&mdash;perhaps a name.

</p>
<p>
I said that Juan had been sent to Cadiz&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pretty town, I recollect it well&mdash;<br/>
'T is there the mart of the colonial trade is<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Or was, before Peru learn'd to rebel),<br/>
And such sweet girls<br/>
&mdash;I mean, such graceful ladies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their very walk would make your bosom swell;<br/>
I can't describe it, though so much it strike,<br/>
Nor liken it<br/>
&mdash;I never saw the like:

</p>
<p>
An Arab horse, a stately stag, a barb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;New broke, a cameleopard, a gazelle,<br/>
No&mdash;none of these will do;&mdash;and then their garb!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their veil and petticoat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Alas! to dwell<br/>
Upon such things would very near absorb<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A canto&mdash;then their feet and ankles,&mdash;well,<br/>
Thank Heaven I 've got no metaphor quite ready<br/>
(And so, my sober Muse&mdash;come, let 's be steady&mdash;

</p>
<p>
Chaste Muse!&mdash;well, if you must, you must)&mdash;the veil<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrown back a moment with the glancing hand,<br/>
While the o'erpowering eye, that turns you pale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flashes into the heart:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;All sunny land<br/>
Of love! when I forget you, may I fail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To&mdash;say my prayers&mdash;but never was there plann'd<br/>
A dress through which the eyes give such a volley,<br/>
Excepting the Venetian Fazzioli.

</p>
<p>
But to our tale: the Donna Inez sent<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her son to Cadiz only to embark;<br/>
To stay there had not answer'd her intent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But why?&mdash;we leave the reader in the dark&mdash;<br/>
'T was for a voyage that the young man was meant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if a Spanish ship were Noah's ark,<br/>
To wean him from the wickedness of earth,<br/>
And send him like a dove of promise forth.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan bade his valet pack his things<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;According to direction, then received<br/>
A lecture and some money: for four springs<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was to travel; and though Inez grieved<br/>
(As every kind of parting has its stings),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She hoped he would improve&mdash;perhaps believed:<br/>
A letter, too, she gave (he never read it)<br/>
Of good advice&mdash;and two or three of credit.

</p>
<p>
In the mean time, to pass her hours away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brave Inez now set up a Sunday school<br/>
For naughty children, who would rather play<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like truant rogues) the devil, or the fool;<br/>
Infants of three years old were taught that day,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dunces were whipt, or set upon a stool:<br/>
The great success of Juan's education,<br/>
Spurr'd her to teach another generation.

</p>
<p>
Juan embark'd&mdash;the ship got under way,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind was fair, the water passing rough:<br/>
A devil of a sea rolls in that bay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I, who 've cross'd it oft, know well enough;<br/>
And, standing upon deck, the dashing spray<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flies in one's face, and makes it weather-tough:<br/>
And there he stood to take, and take again,<br/>
His first&mdash;perhaps his last&mdash;farewell of Spain.

</p>
<p>
I can't but say it is an awkward sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see one's native land receding through<br/>
The growing waters; it unmans one quite,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially when life is rather new:<br/>
I recollect Great Britain's coast looks white,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But almost every other country 's blue,<br/>
When gazing on them, mystified by distance,<br/>
We enter on our nautical existence.

</p>
<p>
So Juan stood, bewilder'd on the deck:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind sung, cordage strain'd, and sailors swore,<br/>
And the ship creak'd, the town became a speck,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From which away so fair and fast they bore.<br/>
The best of remedies is a beef-steak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Against sea-sickness: try it, sir, before<br/>
You sneer, and I assure you this is true,<br/>
For I have found it answer&mdash;so may you.

</p>
<p>
Don Juan stood, and, gazing from the stern,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beheld his native Spain receding far:<br/>
First partings form a lesson hard to learn,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even nations feel this when they go to war;<br/>
There is a sort of unexprest concern,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A kind of shock that sets one's heart ajar:<br/>
At leaving even the most unpleasant people<br/>
And places, one keeps looking at the steeple.

</p>
<p>
But Juan had got many things to leave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His mother, and a mistress, and no wife,<br/>
So that he had much better cause to grieve<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than many persons more advanced in life;<br/>
And if we now and then a sigh must heave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At quitting even those we quit in strife,<br/>
No doubt we weep for those the heart endears&mdash;<br/>
That is, till deeper griefs congeal our tears.

</p>
<p>
So Juan wept, as wept the captive Jews<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By Babel's waters, still remembering Sion:<br/>
I 'd weep,&mdash;but mine is not a weeping Muse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such light griefs are not a thing to die on;<br/>
Young men should travel, if but to amuse<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Themselves; and the next time their servants tie on<br/>
Behind their carriages their new portmanteau,<br/>
Perhaps it may be lined with this my canto.

</p>
<p>
And Juan wept, and much he sigh'd and thought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;While his salt tears dropp'd into the salt sea,<br/>
'Sweets to the sweet' (I like so much to quote;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You must excuse this extract, 't is where she,<br/>
The Queen of Denmark, for Ophelia brought<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flowers to the grave); and, sobbing often, he<br/>
Reflected on his present situation,<br/>
And seriously resolved on reformation.

</p>
<p>
'Farewell, my Spain! a long farewell!' he cried,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Perhaps I may revisit thee no more,<br/>
But die, as many an exiled heart hath died,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of its own thirst to see again thy shore:<br/>
Farewell, where Guadalquivir's waters glide!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Farewell, my mother! and, since all is o'er,<br/>
Farewell, too, dearest Julia!&mdash;(Here he drew<br/>
Her letter out again, and read it through.)

</p>
<p>
'And, oh! if e'er I should forget, I swear&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that 's impossible, and cannot be&mdash;<br/>
Sooner shall this blue ocean melt to air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sooner shall earth resolve itself to sea,<br/>
Than I resign thine image, oh, my fair!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or think of any thing excepting thee;<br/>
A mind diseased no remedy can physic<br/>
(Here the ship gave a lurch, and he grew sea-sick).

</p>
<p>
'Sooner shall heaven kiss earth (here he fell sicker),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, Julia! what is every other wo?<br/>
(For God's sake let me have a glass of liquor;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pedro, Battista, help me down below.)<br/>
Julia, my love! (you rascal, Pedro, quicker)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, Julia! (this curst vessel pitches so)&mdash;<br/>
Beloved Julia, hear me still beseeching!'<br/>
(Here he grew inarticulate with retching.)

</p>
<p>
He felt that chilling heaviness of heart,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or rather stomach, which, alas! attends,<br/>
Beyond the best apothecary's art,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The loss of love, the treachery of friends,<br/>
Or death of those we dote on, when a part<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of us dies with them as each fond hope ends:<br/>
No doubt he would have been much more pathetic,<br/>
But the sea acted as a strong emetic. I

</p>
<p>
Love 's a capricious power: I 've known it hold<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Out through a fever caused by its own heat,<br/>
But be much puzzled by a cough and cold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And find a quincy very hard to treat;<br/>
Against all noble maladies he 's bold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But vulgar illnesses don't like to meet,<br/>
Nor that a sneeze should interrupt his sigh,<br/>
Nor inflammations redden his blind eye.

</p>
<p>
But worst of all is nausea, or a pain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About the lower region of the bowels;<br/>
Love, who heroically breathes a vein,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrinks from the application of hot towels,<br/>
And purgatives are dangerous to his reign,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-sickness death: his love was perfect, how else<br/>
Could Juan's passion, while the billows roar,<br/>
Resist his stomach, ne'er at sea before?

</p>
<p>
The ship, call'd the most holy 'Trinidada,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was steering duly for the port Leghorn;<br/>
For there the Spanish family Moncada<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were settled long ere Juan's sire was born:<br/>
They were relations, and for them he had a<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Letter of introduction, which the morn<br/>
Of his departure had been sent him by<br/>
His Spanish friends for those in Italy.

</p>
<p>
His suite consisted of three servants and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A tutor, the licentiate Pedrillo,<br/>
Who several languages did understand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But now lay sick and speechless on his pillow,<br/>
And rocking in his hammock, long'd for land,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His headache being increased by every billow;<br/>
And the waves oozing through the port-hole made<br/>
His berth a little damp, and him afraid.

</p>
<p>
'T was not without some reason, for the wind<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Increased at night, until it blew a gale;<br/>
And though 't was not much to a naval mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some landsmen would have look'd a little pale,<br/>
For sailors are, in fact, a different kind:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At sunset they began to take in sail,<br/>
For the sky show'd it would come on to blow,<br/>
And carry away, perhaps, a mast or so.

</p>
<p>
At one o'clock the wind with sudden shift<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw the ship right into the trough of the sea,<br/>
Which struck her aft, and made an awkward rift,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Started the stern-post, also shatter'd the<br/>
Whole of her stern-frame, and, ere she could lift<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself from out her present jeopardy,<br/>
The rudder tore away: 't was time to sound<br/>
The pumps, and there were four feet water found.

</p>
<p>
One gang of people instantly was put<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the pumps and the remainder set<br/>
To get up part of the cargo, and what not;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But they could not come at the leak as yet;<br/>
At last they did get at it really, but<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still their salvation was an even bet:<br/>
The water rush'd through in a way quite puzzling,<br/>
While they thrust sheets, shirts, jackets, bales of muslin,

</p>
<p>
Into the opening; but all such ingredients<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Would have been vain, and they must have gone down,<br/>
Despite of all their efforts and expedients,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the pumps: I 'm glad to make them known<br/>
To all the brother tars who may have need hence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For fifty tons of water were upthrown<br/>
By them per hour, and they had all been undone,<br/>
But for the maker, Mr. Mann, of London.

</p>
<p>
As day advanced the weather seem'd to abate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the leak they reckon'd to reduce,<br/>
And keep the ship afloat, though three feet yet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept two hand and one chain-pump still in use.<br/>
The wind blew fresh again: as it grew late<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A squall came on, and while some guns broke loose,<br/>
A gust&mdash;which all descriptive power transcends&mdash;<br/>
Laid with one blast the ship on her beam ends.

</p>
<p>
There she lay motionless, and seem'd upset;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The water left the hold, and wash'd the decks,<br/>
And made a scene men do not soon forget;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For they remember battles, fires, and wrecks,<br/>
Or any other thing that brings regret,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or breaks their hopes, or hearts, or heads, or necks:<br/>
Thus drownings are much talk'd of by the divers,<br/>
And swimmers, who may chance to be survivors.

</p>
<p>
Immediately the masts were cut away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Both main and mizen; first the mizen went,<br/>
The main-mast follow'd: but the ship still lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a mere log, and baffled our intent.<br/>
Foremast and bowsprit were cut down, and they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eased her at last (although we never meant<br/>
To part with all till every hope was blighted),<br/>
And then with violence the old ship righted.

</p>
<p>
It may be easily supposed, while this<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was going on, some people were unquiet,<br/>
That passengers would find it much amiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lose their lives, as well as spoil their diet;<br/>
That even the able seaman, deeming his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Days nearly o'er, might be disposed to riot,<br/>
As upon such occasions tars will ask<br/>
For grog, and sometimes drink rum from the cask.

</p>
<p>
There 's nought, no doubt, so much the spirit calms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As rum and true religion: thus it was,<br/>
Some plunder'd, some drank spirits, some sung psalms,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The high wind made the treble, and as bas<br/>
The hoarse harsh waves kept time; fright cured the qualms<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the luckless landsmen's sea-sick maws:<br/>
Strange sounds of wailing, blasphemy, devotion,<br/>
Clamour'd in chorus to the roaring ocean.

</p>
<p>
Perhaps more mischief had been done, but for<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Juan, who, with sense beyond his years,<br/>
Got to the spirit-room, and stood before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It with a pair of pistols; and their fears,<br/>
As if Death were more dreadful by his door<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fire than water, spite of oaths and tears,<br/>
Kept still aloof the crew, who, ere they sunk,<br/>
Thought it would be becoming to die drunk.

</p>
<p>
'Give us more grog,' they cried, 'for it will be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All one an hour hence.' Juan answer'd, 'No!<br/>
'T is true that death awaits both you and me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But let us die like men, not sink below<br/>
Like brutes;'&mdash;and thus his dangerous post kept he,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And none liked to anticipate the blow;<br/>
And even Pedrillo, his most reverend tutor,<br/>
Was for some rum a disappointed suitor.

</p>
<p>
The good old gentleman was quite aghast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made a loud and pious lamentation;<br/>
Repented all his sins, and made a last<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrevocable vow of reformation;<br/>
Nothing should tempt him more (this peril past)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To quit his academic occupation,<br/>
In cloisters of the classic Salamanca,<br/>
To follow Juan's wake, like Sancho Panca.

</p>
<p>
But now there came a flash of hope once more;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Day broke, and the wind lull'd: the masts were gone,<br/>
The leak increased; shoals round her, but no shore,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The vessel swam, yet still she held her own.<br/>
They tried the pumps again, and though before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their desperate efforts seem'd all useless grown,<br/>
A glimpse of sunshine set some hands to bale&mdash;<br/>
The stronger pump'd, the weaker thrumm'd a sail.

</p>
<p>
Under the vessel's keel the sail was past,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the moment it had some effect;<br/>
But with a leak, and not a stick of mast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor rag of canvas, what could they expect?<br/>
But still 't is best to struggle to the last,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is never too late to be wholly wreck'd:<br/>
And though 't is true that man can only die once,<br/>
'T is not so pleasant in the Gulf of Lyons.

</p>
<p>
There winds and waves had hurl'd them, and from thence,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without their will, they carried them away;<br/>
For they were forced with steering to dispense,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And never had as yet a quiet day<br/>
On which they might repose, or even commence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A jurymast or rudder, or could say<br/>
The ship would swim an hour, which, by good luck,<br/>
Still swam&mdash;though not exactly like a duck.

</p>
<p>
The wind, in fact, perhaps was rather less,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the ship labour'd so, they scarce could hope<br/>
To weather out much longer; the distress<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was also great with which they had to cope<br/>
For want of water, and their solid mess<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was scant enough: in vain the telescope<br/>
Was used&mdash;nor sail nor shore appear'd in sight,<br/>
Nought but the heavy sea, and coming night.

</p>
<p>
Again the weather threaten'd,&mdash;again blew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A gale, and in the fore and after hold<br/>
Water appear'd; yet, though the people knew<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All this, the most were patient, and some bold,<br/>
Until the chains and leathers were worn through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all our pumps:&mdash;a wreck complete she roll'd,<br/>
At mercy of the waves, whose mercies are<br/>
Like human beings during civil war.

</p>
<p>
Then came the carpenter, at last, with tears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In his rough eyes, and told the captain he<br/>
Could do no more: he was a man in years,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And long had voyaged through many a stormy sea,<br/>
And if he wept at length, they were not fears<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That made his eyelids as a woman's be,<br/>
But he, poor fellow, had a wife and children,&mdash;<br/>
Two things for dying people quite bewildering.

</p>
<p>
The ship was evidently settling now<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast by the head; and, all distinction gone,<br/>
Some went to prayers again, and made a vow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of candles to their saints&mdash;but there were none<br/>
To pay them with; and some look'd o'er the bow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hoisted out the boats; and there was one<br/>
That begg'd Pedrillo for an absolution,<br/>
Who told him to be damn'd&mdash;in his confusion.

</p>
<p>
Some lash'd them in their hammocks; some put on<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their best clothes, as if going to a fair;<br/>
Some cursed the day on which they saw the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gnash'd their teeth, and, howling, tore their hair;<br/>
And others went on as they had begun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting the boats out, being well aware<br/>
That a tight boat will live in a rough sea,<br/>
Unless with breakers close beneath her lee.

</p>
<p>
The worst of all was, that in their condition,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Having been several days in great distress,<br/>
'T was difficult to get out such provision<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As now might render their long suffering less:<br/>
Men, even when dying, dislike inanition;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their stock was damaged by the weather's stress:<br/>
Two casks of biscuit and a keg of butter<br/>
Were all that could be thrown into the cutter.

</p>
<p>
But in the long-boat they contrived to stow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pounds of bread, though injured by the wet;<br/>
Water, a twenty-gallon cask or so;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Six flasks of wine; and they contrived to get<br/>
A portion of their beef up from below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with a piece of pork, moreover, met,<br/>
But scarce enough to serve them for a luncheon&mdash;<br/>
Then there was rum, eight gallons in a puncheon.

</p>
<p>
The other boats, the yawl and pinnace, had<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Been stove in the beginning of the gale;<br/>
And the long-boat's condition was but bad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As there were but two blankets for a sail,<br/>
And one oar for a mast, which a young lad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw in by good luck over the ship's rail;<br/>
And two boats could not hold, far less be stored,<br/>
To save one half the people then on board.

</p>
<p>
'T was twilight, and the sunless day went down<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the waste of waters; like a veil,<br/>
Which, if withdrawn, would but disclose the frown<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one whose hate is mask'd but to assail,<br/>
Thus to their hopeless eyes the night was shown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And grimly darkled o'er the faces pale,<br/>
And the dim desolate deep: twelve days had Fear<br/>
Been their familiar, and now Death was here.

</p>
<p>
Some trial had been making at a raft,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With little hope in such a rolling sea,<br/>
A sort of thing at which one would have laugh'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If any laughter at such times could be,<br/>
Unless with people who too much have quaff'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And have a kind of wild and horrid glee,<br/>
Half epileptical and half hysterical:&mdash;<br/>
Their preservation would have been a miracle.

</p>
<p>
At half-past eight o'clock, booms, hencoops, spars,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all things, for a chance, had been cast loose,<br/>
That still could keep afloat the struggling tars,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For yet they strove, although of no great use:<br/>
There was no light in heaven but a few stars,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The boats put off o'ercrowded with their crews;<br/>
She gave a heel, and then a lurch to port,<br/>
And, going down head foremost&mdash;sunk, in short.

</p>
<p>
Then rose from sea to sky the wild farewell&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shriek'd the timid, and stood still the brave,<br/>
Then some leap'd overboard with dreadful yell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As eager to anticipate their grave;<br/>
And the sea yawn'd around her like a hell,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And down she suck'd with her the whirling wave,<br/>
Like one who grapples with his enemy,<br/>
And strives to strangle him before he die.

</p>
<p>
And first one universal shriek there rush'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Louder than the loud ocean, like a crash<br/>
Of echoing thunder; and then all was hush'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the wild wind and the remorseless dash<br/>
Of billows; but at intervals there gush'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accompanied with a convulsive splash,<br/>
A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry<br/>
Of some strong swimmer in his agony.

</p>
<p>
The boats, as stated, had got off before,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in them crowded several of the crew;<br/>
And yet their present hope was hardly more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than what it had been, for so strong it blew<br/>
There was slight chance of reaching any shore;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they were too many, though so few&mdash;<br/>
Nine in the cutter, thirty in the boat,<br/>
Were counted in them when they got afloat.

</p>
<p>
All the rest perish'd; near two hundred souls<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had left their bodies; and what 's worse, alas!<br/>
When over Catholics the ocean rolls,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They must wait several weeks before a mass<br/>
Takes off one peck of purgatorial coals,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, till people know what 's come to pass,<br/>
They won't lay out their money on the dead&mdash;<br/>
It costs three francs for every mass that 's said.

</p>
<p>
Juan got into the long-boat, and there<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrived to help Pedrillo to a place;<br/>
It seem'd as if they had exchanged their care,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Juan wore the magisterial face<br/>
Which courage gives, while poor Pedrillo's pair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of eyes were crying for their owner's case:<br/>
Battista; though (a name call'd shortly Tita),<br/>
Was lost by getting at some aqua-vita.

</p>
<p>
Pedro, his valet, too, he tried to save,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the same cause, conducive to his loss,<br/>
Left him so drunk, he jump'd into the wave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er the cutter's edge he tried to cross,<br/>
And so he found a wine-and-watery grave;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They could not rescue him although so close,<br/>
Because the sea ran higher every minute,<br/>
And for the boat&mdash;the crew kept crowding in it.

</p>
<p>
A small old spaniel,&mdash;which had been Don Jose's,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His father's, whom he loved, as ye may think,<br/>
For on such things the memory reposes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tenderness&mdash;stood howling on the brink,<br/>
Knowing (dogs have such intellectual noses!),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, the vessel was about to sink;<br/>
And Juan caught him up, and ere he stepp'd<br/>
Off, threw him in, then after him he leap'd.

</p>
<p>
He also stuff'd his money where he could<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;About his person, and Pedrillo's too,<br/>
Who let him do, in fact, whate'er he would,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not knowing what himself to say, or do,<br/>
As every rising wave his dread renew'd;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But Juan, trusting they might still get through,<br/>
And deeming there were remedies for any ill,<br/>
Thus re-embark'd his tutor and his spaniel.

</p>
<p>
'T was a rough night, and blew so stiffly yet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the sail was becalm'd between the seas,<br/>
Though on the wave's high top too much to set,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They dared not take it in for all the breeze:<br/>
Each sea curl'd o'er the stern, and kept them wet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And made them bale without a moment's ease,<br/>
So that themselves as well as hopes were damp'd,<br/>
And the poor little cutter quickly swamp'd.

</p>
<p>
Nine souls more went in her: the long-boat still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kept above water, with an oar for mast,<br/>
Two blankets stitch'd together, answering ill<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of sail, were to the oar made fast:<br/>
Though every wave roll'd menacing to fill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And present peril all before surpass'd,<br/>
They grieved for those who perish'd with the cutter,<br/>
And also for the biscuit-casks and butter.

</p>
<p>
The sun rose red and fiery, a sure sign<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the continuance of the gale: to run<br/>
Before the sea until it should grow fine,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was all that for the present could be done:<br/>
A few tea-spoonfuls of their rum and wine<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were served out to the people, who begun<br/>
To faint, and damaged bread wet through the bags,<br/>
And most of them had little clothes but rags.

</p>
<p>
They counted thirty, crowded in a space<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which left scarce room for motion or exertion;<br/>
They did their best to modify their case,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One half sate up, though numb'd with the immersion,<br/>
While t'other half were laid down in their place<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At watch and watch; thus, shivering like the tertian<br/>
Ague in its cold fit, they fill'd their boat,<br/>
With nothing but the sky for a great coat.

</p>
<p>
'T is very certain the desire of life<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prolongs it: this is obvious to physicians,<br/>
When patients, neither plagued with friends nor wife,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Survive through very desperate conditions,<br/>
Because they still can hope, nor shines the knife<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor shears of Atropos before their visions:<br/>
Despair of all recovery spoils longevity,<br/>
And makes men miseries miseries of alarming brevity.

</p>
<p>
'T is said that persons living on annuities<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are longer lived than others,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;God knows why,<br/>
Unless to plague the grantors,&mdash;yet so true it is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That some, I really think, do never die;<br/>
Of any creditors the worst a Jew it is,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that 's their mode of furnishing supply:<br/>
In my young days they lent me cash that way,<br/>
Which I found very troublesome to pay.

</p>
<p>
'T is thus with people in an open boat,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They live upon the love of life, and bear<br/>
More than can be believed, or even thought,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And stand like rocks the tempest's wear and tear;<br/>
And hardship still has been the sailor's lot,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Noah's ark went cruising here and there;<br/>
She had a curious crew as well as cargo,<br/>
Like the first old Greek privateer, the Argo.

</p>
<p>
But man is a carnivorous production,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And must have meals, at least one meal a day;<br/>
He cannot live, like woodcocks, upon suction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But, like the shark and tiger, must have prey;<br/>
Although his anatomical construction<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bears vegetables, in a grumbling way,<br/>
Your labouring people think beyond all question,<br/>
Beef, veal, and mutton, better for digestion.

</p>
<p>
And thus it was with this our hapless crew;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For on the third day there came on a calm,<br/>
And though at first their strength it might renew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And lying on their weariness like balm,<br/>
Lull'd them like turtles sleeping on the blue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of ocean, when they woke they felt a qualm,<br/>
And fell all ravenously on their provision,<br/>
Instead of hoarding it with due precision.

</p>
<p>
The consequence was easily foreseen&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They ate up all they had, and drank their wine,<br/>
In spite of all remonstrances, and then<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On what, in fact, next day were they to dine?<br/>
They hoped the wind would rise, these foolish men!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And carry them to shore; these hopes were fine,<br/>
But as they had but one oar, and that brittle,<br/>
It would have been more wise to save their victual.

</p>
<p>
The fourth day came, but not a breath of air,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ocean slumber'd like an unwean'd child:<br/>
The fifth day, and their boat lay floating there,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea and sky were blue, and clear, and mild&mdash;<br/>
With their one oar (I wish they had had a pair)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What could they do? and hunger's rage grew wild:<br/>
So Juan's spaniel, spite of his entreating,<br/>
Was kill'd and portion'd out for present eating.

</p>
<p>
On the sixth day they fed upon his hide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan, who had still refused, because<br/>
The creature was his father's dog that died,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now feeling all the vulture in his jaws,<br/>
With some remorse received (though first denied)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As a great favour one of the fore-paws,<br/>
Which he divided with Pedrillo, who<br/>
Devour'd it, longing for the other too.

</p>
<p>
The seventh day, and no wind&mdash;the burning sun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blister'd and scorch'd, and, stagnant on the sea,<br/>
They lay like carcasses; and hope was none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save in the breeze that came not; savagely<br/>
They glared upon each other&mdash;all was done,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Water, and wine, and food,&mdash;and you might see<br/>
The longings of the cannibal arise<br/>
(Although they spoke not) in their wolfish eyes.

</p>
<p>
At length one whisper'd his companion, who<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whisper'd another, and thus it went round,<br/>
And then into a hoarser murmur grew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An ominous, and wild, and desperate sound;<br/>
And when his comrade's thought each sufferer knew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was but his own, suppress'd till now, he found:<br/>
And out they spoke of lots for flesh and blood,<br/>
And who should die to be his fellow's food.

</p>
<p>
But ere they came to this, they that day shared<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some leathern caps, and what remain'd of shoes;<br/>
And then they look'd around them and despair'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And none to be the sacrifice would choose;<br/>
At length the lots were torn up, and prepared,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But of materials that much shock the Muse&mdash;<br/>
Having no paper, for the want of better,<br/>
They took by force from Juan Julia's letter.

</p>
<p>
The lots were made, and mark'd, and mix'd, and handed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In silent horror, and their distribution<br/>
Lull'd even the savage hunger which demanded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the Promethean vulture, this pollution;<br/>
None in particular had sought or plann'd it,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was nature gnaw'd them to this resolution,<br/>
By which none were permitted to be neuter&mdash;<br/>
And the lot fell on Juan's luckless tutor.

</p>
<p>
He but requested to be bled to death:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The surgeon had his instruments, and bled<br/>
Pedrillo, and so gently ebb'd his breath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You hardly could perceive when he was dead.<br/>
He died as born, a Catholic in faith,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like most in the belief in which they 're bred,<br/>
And first a little crucifix he kiss'd,<br/>
And then held out his jugular and wrist.

</p>
<p>
The surgeon, as there was no other fee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had his first choice of morsels for his pains;<br/>
But being thirstiest at the moment, he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferr'd a draught from the fast-flowing veins:<br/>
Part was divided, part thrown in the sea,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And such things as the entrails and the brains<br/>
Regaled two sharks, who follow'd o'er the billow&mdash;<br/>
The sailors ate the rest of poor Pedrillo.

</p>
<p>
The sailors ate him, all save three or four,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who were not quite so fond of animal food;<br/>
To these was added Juan, who, before<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Refusing his own spaniel, hardly could<br/>
Feel now his appetite increased much more;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was not to be expected that he should,<br/>
Even in extremity of their disaster,<br/>
Dine with them on his pastor and his master.

</p>
<p>
'T was better that he did not; for, in fact,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The consequence was awful in the extreme;<br/>
For they, who were most ravenous in the act,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Went raging mad<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Lord! how they did blaspheme!<br/>
And foam and roll, with strange convulsions rack'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drinking salt water like a mountain-stream,<br/>
Tearing, and grinning, howling, screeching, swearing,<br/>
And, with hyaena-laughter, died despairing.

</p>
<p>
Their numbers were much thinn'd by this infliction,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the rest were thin enough, Heaven knows;<br/>
And some of them had lost their recollection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Happier than they who still perceived their woes;<br/>
But others ponder'd on a new dissection,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if not warn'd sufficiently by those<br/>
Who had already perish'd, suffering madly,<br/>
For having used their appetites so sadly.

</p>
<p>
And next they thought upon the master's mate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As fattest; but he saved himself, because,<br/>
Besides being much averse from such a fate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some other reasons: the first was,<br/>
He had been rather indisposed of late;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that which chiefly proved his saving clause<br/>
Was a small present made to him at Cadiz,<br/>
By general subscription of the ladies.

</p>
<p>
Of poor Pedrillo something still remain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But was used sparingly,&mdash;some were afraid,<br/>
And others still their appetites constrain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or but at times a little supper made;<br/>
All except Juan, who throughout abstain'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chewing a piece of bamboo and some lead:<br/>
At length they caught two boobies and a noddy,<br/>
And then they left off eating the dead body.

</p>
<p>
And if Pedrillo's fate should shocking be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember Ugolino condescends<br/>
To eat the head of his arch-enemy<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment after he politely ends<br/>
His tale: if foes be food in hell, at sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T is surely fair to dine upon our friends,<br/>
When shipwreck's short allowance grows too scanty,<br/>
Without being much more horrible than Dante.

</p>
<p>
And the same night there fell a shower of rain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For which their mouths gaped, like the cracks of earth<br/>
When dried to summer dust; till taught by pain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men really know not what good water 's worth;<br/>
If you had been in Turkey or in Spain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or with a famish'd boat's-crew had your berth,<br/>
Or in the desert heard the camel's bell,<br/>
You 'd wish yourself where Truth is&mdash;in a well.

</p>
<p>
It pour'd down torrents, but they were no richer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Until they found a ragged piece of sheet,<br/>
Which served them as a sort of spongy pitcher,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when they deem'd its moisture was complete<br/>
They wrung it out, and though a thirsty ditcher<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Might not have thought the scanty draught so sweet<br/>
As a full pot of porter, to their thinking<br/>
They ne'er till now had known the joys of drinking.

</p>
<p>
And their baked lips, with many a bloody crack,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suck'd in the moisture, which like nectar stream'd;<br/>
Their throats were ovens, their swoln tongues were black,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rich man's in hell, who vainly scream'd<br/>
To beg the beggar, who could not rain back<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of dew, when every drop had seem'd<br/>
To taste of heaven<br/>
&mdash;If this be true, indeed<br/>
Some Christians have a comfortable creed.

</p>
<p>
There were two fathers in this ghastly crew,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And with them their two sons, of whom the one<br/>
Was more robust and hardy to the view,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But he died early; and when he was gone,<br/>
His nearest messmate told his sire, who threw<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One glance at him, and said, 'Heaven's will be done!<br/>
I can do nothing,' and he saw him thrown<br/>
Into the deep without a tear or groan.

</p>
<p>
The other father had a weaklier child,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a soft cheek and aspect delicate;<br/>
But the boy bore up long, and with a mild<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And patient spirit held aloof his fate;<br/>
Little he said, and now and then he smiled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to win a part from off the weight<br/>
He saw increasing on his father's heart,<br/>
With the deep deadly thought that they must part.

</p>
<p>
And o'er him bent his sire, and never raised<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes from off his face, but wiped the foam<br/>
From his pale lips, and ever on him gazed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the wish'd-for shower at length was come,<br/>
And the boy's eyes, which the dull film half glazed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighten'd, and for a moment seem'd to roam,<br/>
He squeezed from out a rag some drops of rain<br/>
Into his dying child's mouth&mdash;but in vain.

</p>
<p>
The boy expired&mdash;the father held the clay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look'd upon it long, and when at last<br/>
Death left no doubt, and the dead burthen lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Stiff on his heart, and pulse and hope were past,<br/>
He watch'd it wistfully, until away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was borne by the rude wave wherein 't was cast;<br/>
Then he himself sunk down all dumb and shivering,<br/>
And gave no sign of life, save his limbs quivering.

</p>
<p>
Now overhead a rainbow, bursting through<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The scattering clouds, shone, spanning the dark sea,<br/>
Resting its bright base on the quivering blue;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all within its arch appear'd to be<br/>
Clearer than that without, and its wide hue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wax'd broad and waving, like a banner free,<br/>
Then changed like to a bow that 's bent, and then<br/>
Forsook the dim eyes of these shipwreck'd men.

</p>
<p>
It changed, of course; a heavenly chameleon,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The airy child of vapour and the sun,<br/>
Brought forth in purple, cradled in vermilion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Baptized in molten gold, and swathed in dun,<br/>
Glittering like crescents o'er a Turk's pavilion,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And blending every colour into one,<br/>
Just like a black eye in a recent scuffle<br/>
(For sometimes we must box without the muffle).

</p>
<p>
Our shipwreck'd seamen thought it a good omen&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is as well to think so, now and then;<br/>
'T was an old custom of the Greek and Roman,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And may become of great advantage when<br/>
Folks are discouraged; and most surely no men<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had greater need to nerve themselves again<br/>
Than these, and so this rainbow look'd like hope&mdash;<br/>
Quite a celestial kaleidoscope.

</p>
<p>
About this time a beautiful white bird,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Webfooted, not unlike a dove in size<br/>
And plumage (probably it might have err'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon its course), pass'd oft before their eyes,<br/>
And tried to perch, although it saw and heard<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The men within the boat, and in this guise<br/>
It came and went, and flutter'd round them till<br/>
Night fell: this seem'd a better omen still.

</p>
<p>
But in this case I also must remark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'T was well this bird of promise did not perch,<br/>
Because the tackle of our shatter'd bark<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not so safe for roosting as a church;<br/>
And had it been the dove from Noah's ark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning there from her successful search,<br/>
Which in their way that moment chanced to fall,<br/>
They would have eat her, olive-branch and all.

</p>
<p>
With twilight it again came on to blow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not with violence; the stars shone out,<br/>
The boat made way; yet now they were so low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They knew not where nor what they were about;<br/>
Some fancied they saw land, and some said 'No!'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The frequent fog-banks gave them cause to doubt&mdash;<br/>
Some swore that they heard breakers, others guns,<br/>
And all mistook about the latter once.

</p>
<p>
As morning broke, the light wind died away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When he who had the watch sung out and swore,<br/>
If 't was not land that rose with the sun's ray,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He wish'd that land he never might see more;<br/>
And the rest rubb'd their eyes and saw a bay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or thought they saw, and shaped their course for shore;<br/>
For shore it was, and gradually grew<br/>
Distinct, and high, and palpable to view.

</p>
<p>
And then of these some part burst into tears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And others, looking with a stupid stare,<br/>
Could not yet separate their hopes from fears,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And seem'd as if they had no further care;<br/>
While a few pray'd (the first time for some years)&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the bottom of the boat three were<br/>
Asleep: they shook them by the hand and head,<br/>
And tried to awaken them, but found them dead.

</p>
<p>
The day before, fast sleeping on the water,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They found a turtle of the hawk's-bill kind,<br/>
And by good fortune, gliding softly, caught her,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which yielded a day's life, and to their mind<br/>
Proved even still a more nutritious matter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it left encouragement behind:<br/>
They thought that in such perils, more than chance<br/>
Had sent them this for their deliverance.

</p>
<p>
The land appear'd a high and rocky coast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And higher grew the mountains as they drew,<br/>
Set by a current, toward it: they were lost<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In various conjectures, for none knew<br/>
To what part of the earth they had been tost,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So changeable had been the winds that blew;<br/>
Some thought it was Mount AEtna, some the highlands,<br/>
Of Candia, Cyprus, Rhodes, or other islands.

</p>
<p>
Meantime the current, with a rising gale,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still set them onwards to the welcome shore,<br/>
Like Charon's bark of spectres, dull and pale:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their living freight was now reduced to four,<br/>
And three dead, whom their strength could not avail<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To heave into the deep with those before,<br/>
Though the two sharks still follow'd them, and dash'd<br/>
The spray into their faces as they splash'd.

</p>
<p>
Famine, despair, cold, thirst, and heat, had done<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their work on them by turns, and thinn'd them to<br/>
Such things a mother had not known her son<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the skeletons of that gaunt crew;<br/>
By night chill'd, by day scorch'd, thus one by one<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They perish'd, until wither'd to these few,<br/>
But chiefly by a species of self-slaughter,<br/>
In washing down Pedrillo with salt water.

</p>
<p>
As they drew nigh the land, which now was seen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unequal in its aspect here and there,<br/>
They felt the freshness of its growing green,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That waved in forest-tops, and smooth'd the air,<br/>
And fell upon their glazed eyes like a screen<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From glistening waves, and skies so hot and bare&mdash;<br/>
Lovely seem'd any object that should sweep<br/>
Away the vast, salt, dread, eternal deep.

</p>
<p>
The shore look'd wild, without a trace of man,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And girt by formidable waves; but they<br/>
Were mad for land, and thus their course they ran,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though right ahead the roaring breakers lay:<br/>
A reef between them also now began<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To show its boiling surf and bounding spray,<br/>
But finding no place for their landing better,<br/>
They ran the boat for shore,&mdash;and overset her.

</p>
<p>
But in his native stream, the Guadalquivir,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan to lave his youthful limbs was wont;<br/>
And having learnt to swim in that sweet river,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had often turn'd the art to some account:<br/>
A better swimmer you could scarce see ever,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He could, perhaps, have pass'd the Hellespont,<br/>
As once (a feat on which ourselves we prided)<br/>
Leander, Mr. Ekenhead, and I did.

</p>
<p>
So here, though faint, emaciated, and stark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He buoy'd his boyish limbs, and strove to ply<br/>
With the quick wave, and gain, ere it was dark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The beach which lay before him, high and dry:<br/>
The greatest danger here was from a shark,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That carried off his neighbour by the thigh;<br/>
As for the other two, they could not swim,<br/>
So nobody arrived on shore but him.

</p>
<p>
Nor yet had he arrived but for the oar,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which, providentially for him, was wash'd<br/>
Just as his feeble arms could strike no more,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the hard wave o'erwhelm'd him as 't was dash'd<br/>
Within his grasp; he clung to it, and sore<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters beat while he thereto was lash'd;<br/>
At last, with swimming, wading, scrambling, he<br/>
Roll'd on the beach, half-senseless, from the sea:

</p>
<p>
There, breathless, with his digging nails he clung<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast to the sand, lest the returning wave,<br/>
From whose reluctant roar his life he wrung,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should suck him back to her insatiate grave:<br/>
And there he lay, full length, where he was flung,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the entrance of a cliff-worn cave,<br/>
With just enough of life to feel its pain,<br/>
And deem that it was saved, perhaps in vain.

</p>
<p>
With slow and staggering effort he arose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But sunk again upon his bleeding knee<br/>
And quivering hand; and then he look'd for those<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who long had been his mates upon the sea;<br/>
But none of them appear'd to share his woes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save one, a corpse, from out the famish'd three,<br/>
Who died two days before, and now had found<br/>
An unknown barren beach for burial ground.

</p>
<p>
And as he gazed, his dizzy brain spun fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And down he sunk; and as he sunk, the sand<br/>
Swam round and round, and all his senses pass'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He fell upon his side, and his stretch'd hand<br/>
Droop'd dripping on the oar (their jurymast),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like a wither'd lily, on the land<br/>
His slender frame and pallid aspect lay,<br/>
As fair a thing as e'er was form'd of clay.

</p>
<p>
How long in his damp trance young Juan lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew not, for the earth was gone for him,<br/>
And Time had nothing more of night nor day<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For his congealing blood, and senses dim;<br/>
And how this heavy faintness pass'd away<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew not, till each painful pulse and limb,<br/>
And tingling vein, seem'd throbbing back to life,<br/>
For Death, though vanquish'd, still retired with strife.

</p>
<p>
His eyes he open'd, shut, again unclosed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For all was doubt and dizziness; he thought<br/>
He still was in the boat and had but dozed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt again with his despair o'erwrought,<br/>
And wish'd it death in which he had reposed;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then once more his feelings back were brought,<br/>
And slowly by his swimming eyes was seen<br/>
A lovely female face of seventeen.

</p>
<p>
'T was bending dose o'er his, and the small mouth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem'd almost prying into his for breath;<br/>
And chafing him, the soft warm hand of youth<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall'd his answering spirits back from death;<br/>
And, bathing his chill temples, tried to soothe<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Each pulse to animation, till beneath<br/>
Its gentle touch and trembling care, a sigh<br/>
To these kind efforts made a low reply.

</p>
<p>
Then was the cordial pour'd, and mantle flung<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his scarce-clad limbs; and the fair arm<br/>
Raised higher the faint head which o'er it hung;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And her transparent cheek, all pure and warm,<br/>
Pillow'd his death-like forehead; then she wrung<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His dewy curls, long drench'd by every storm;<br/>
And watch'd with eagerness each throb that drew<br/>
A sigh from his heaved bosom&mdash;and hers, too.

</p>
<p>
And lifting him with care into the cave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The gentle girl and her attendant,&mdash;one<br/>
Young, yet her elder, and of brow less grave,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more robust of figure,&mdash;then begun<br/>
To kindle fire, and as the new flames gave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Light to the rocks that roof'd them, which the sun<br/>
Had never seen, the maid, or whatsoe'er<br/>
She was, appear'd distinct, and tall, and fair.

</p>
<p>
Her brow was overhung with coins of gold,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That sparkled o'er the auburn of her hair&mdash;<br/>
Her clustering hair, whose longer locks were roll'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In braids behind; and though her stature were<br/>
Even of the highest for a female mould,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They nearly reach'd her heel; and in her air<br/>
There was a something which bespoke command,<br/>
As one who was a lady in the land.

</p>
<p>
Her hair, I said, was auburn; but her eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were black as death, their lashes the same hue,<br/>
Of downcast length, in whose silk shadow lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Deepest attraction; for when to the view<br/>
Forth from its raven fringe the full glance flies,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne'er with such force the swiftest arrow flew;<br/>
'T is as the snake late coil'd, who pours his length,<br/>
And hurls at once his venom and his strength.

</p>
<p>
Her brow was white and low, her cheek's pure dye<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like twilight rosy still with the set sun;<br/>
Short upper lip&mdash;sweet lips! that make us sigh<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever to have seen such; for she was one<br/>
Fit for the model of a statuary<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A race of mere impostors, when all 's done&mdash;<br/>
I 've seen much finer women, ripe and real,<br/>
Than all the nonsense of their stone ideal).

</p>
<p>
I 'll tell you why I say so, for 't is just<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One should not rail without a decent cause:<br/>
There was an Irish lady, to whose bust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I ne'er saw justice done, and yet she was<br/>
A frequent model; and if e'er she must<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yield to stern Time and Nature's wrinkling laws,<br/>
They will destroy a face which mortal thought<br/>
Ne'er compass'd, nor less mortal chisel wrought.

</p>
<p>
And such was she, the lady of the cave:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dress was very different from the Spanish,<br/>
Simpler, and yet of colours not so grave;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For, as you know, the Spanish women banish<br/>
Bright hues when out of doors, and yet, while wave<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around them (what I hope will never vanish)<br/>
The basquina and the mantilla, they<br/>
Seem at the same time mystical and gay.

</p>
<p>
But with our damsel this was not the case:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dress was many-colour'd, finely spun;<br/>
Her locks curl'd negligently round her face,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But through them gold and gems profusely shone:<br/>
Her girdle sparkled, and the richest lace<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Flow'd in her veil, and many a precious stone<br/>
Flash'd on her little hand; but, what was shocking,<br/>
Her small snow feet had slippers, but no stocking.

</p>
<p>
The other female's dress was not unlike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But of inferior materials: she<br/>
Had not so many ornaments to strike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her hair had silver only, bound to be<br/>
Her dowry; and her veil, in form alike,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was coarser; and her air, though firm, less free;<br/>
Her hair was thicker, but less long; her eyes<br/>
As black, but quicker, and of smaller size.

</p>
<p>
And these two tended him, and cheer'd him both<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With food and raiment, and those soft attentions,<br/>
Which are (as I must own) of female growth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And have ten thousand delicate inventions:<br/>
They made a most superior mess of broth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A thing which poesy but seldom mentions,<br/>
But the best dish that e'er was cook'd since Homer's<br/>
Achilles ordered dinner for new comers.

</p>
<p>
I 'll tell you who they were, this female pair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest they should seem princesses in disguise;<br/>
Besides, I hate all mystery, and that air<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of clap-trap which your recent poets prize;<br/>
And so, in short, the girls they really were<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They shall appear before your curious eyes,<br/>
Mistress and maid; the first was only daughter<br/>
Of an old man who lived upon the water.

</p>
<p>
A fisherman he had been in his youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And still a sort of fisherman was he;<br/>
But other speculations were, in sooth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to his connection with the sea,<br/>
Perhaps not so respectable, in truth:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A little smuggling, and some piracy,<br/>
Left him, at last, the sole of many masters<br/>
Of an ill-gotten million of piastres.

</p>
<p>
A fisher, therefore, was he,&mdash;though of men,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Peter the Apostle,&mdash;and he fish'd<br/>
For wandering merchant-vessels, now and then,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And sometimes caught as many as he wish'd;<br/>
The cargoes he confiscated, and gain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He sought in the slave-market too, and dish'd<br/>
Full many a morsel for that Turkish trade,<br/>
By which, no doubt, a good deal may be made.

</p>
<p>
He was a Greek, and on his isle had built<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(One of the wild and smaller Cyclades)<br/>
A very handsome house from out his guilt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there he lived exceedingly at ease;<br/>
Heaven knows what cash he got or blood he spilt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A sad old fellow was he, if you please;<br/>
But this I know, it was a spacious building,<br/>
Full of barbaric carving, paint, and gilding.

</p>
<p>
He had an only daughter, call'd Haidee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest heiress of the Eastern Isles;<br/>
Besides, so very beautiful was she,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dowry was as nothing to her smiles:<br/>
Still in her teens, and like a lovely tree<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She grew to womanhood, and between whiles<br/>
Rejected several suitors, just to learn<br/>
How to accept a better in his turn.

</p>
<p>
And walking out upon the beach, below<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The cliff, towards sunset, on that day she found,<br/>
Insensible,&mdash;not dead, but nearly so,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Juan, almost famish'd, and half drown'd;<br/>
But being naked, she was shock'd, you know,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet deem'd herself in common pity bound,<br/>
As far as in her lay, 'to take him in,<br/>
A stranger' dying, with so white a skin.

</p>
<p>
But taking him into her father's house<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was not exactly the best way to save,<br/>
But like conveying to the cat the mouse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or people in a trance into their grave;<br/>
Because the good old man had so much 'nous,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike the honest Arab thieves so brave,<br/>
He would have hospitably cured the stranger,<br/>
And sold him instantly when out of danger.

</p>
<p>
And therefore, with her maid, she thought it best<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A virgin always on her maid relies)<br/>
To place him in the cave for present rest:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And when, at last, he open'd his black eyes,<br/>
Their charity increased about their guest;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And their compassion grew to such a size,<br/>
It open'd half the turnpike-gates to heaven<br/>
(St. Paul says, 't is the toll which must be given).

</p>
<p>
They made a fire,&mdash;but such a fire as they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the moment could contrive with such<br/>
Materials as were cast up round the bay,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some broken planks, and oars, that to the touch<br/>
Were nearly tinder, since so long they lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A mast was almost crumbled to a crutch;<br/>
But, by God's grace, here wrecks were in such plenty,<br/>
That there was fuel to have furnish'd twenty.

</p>
<p>
He had a bed of furs, and a pelisse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Haidee stripped her sables off to make<br/>
His couch; and, that he might be more at ease,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And warm, in case by chance he should awake,<br/>
They also gave a petticoat apiece,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She and her maid&mdash;and promised by daybreak<br/>
To pay him a fresh visit, with a dish<br/>
For breakfast, of eggs, coffee, bread, and fish.

</p>
<p>
And thus they left him to his lone repose:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Juan slept like a top, or like the dead,<br/>
Who sleep at last, perhaps (God only knows),<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Just for the present; and in his lull'd head<br/>
Not even a vision of his former woes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Throbb'd in accursed dreams, which sometimes spread<br/>
Unwelcome visions of our former years,<br/>
Till the eye, cheated, opens thick with tears.

</p>
<p>
Young Juan slept all dreamless:&mdash;but the maid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who smooth'd his pillow, as she left the den<br/>
Look'd back upon him, and a moment stay'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And turn'd, believing that he call'd again.<br/>
He slumber'd; yet she thought, at least she said<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(The heart will slip, even as the tongue and pen),<br/>
He had pronounced her name&mdash;but she forgot<br/>
That at this moment Juan knew it not.

</p>
<p>
And pensive to her father's house she went,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enjoining silence strict to Zoe, who<br/>
Better than her knew what, in fact, she meant,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She being wiser by a year or two:<br/>
A year or two 's an age when rightly spent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Zoe spent hers, as most women do,<br/>
In gaining all that useful sort of knowledge<br/>
Which is acquired in Nature's good old college.

</p>
<p>
The morn broke, and found Juan slumbering still<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast in his cave, and nothing clash'd upon<br/>
His rest; the rushing of the neighbouring rill,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the young beams of the excluded sun,<br/>
Troubled him not, and he might sleep his fill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And need he had of slumber yet, for none<br/>
Had suffer'd more&mdash;his hardships were comparative<br/>
To those related in my grand-dad's 'Narrative.'

</p>
<p>
Not so Haidee: she sadly toss'd and tumbled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And started from her sleep, and, turning o'er<br/>
Dream'd of a thousand wrecks, o'er which she stumbled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And handsome corpses strew'd upon the shore;<br/>
And woke her maid so early that she grumbled,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And call'd her father's old slaves up, who swore<br/>
In several oaths<br/>
&mdash;Armenian, Turk, and Greek&mdash;<br/>
They knew not what to think of such a freak.

</p>
<p>
But up she got, and up she made them get,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With some pretence about the sun, that makes<br/>
Sweet skies just when he rises, or is set;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And 't is, no doubt, a sight to see when breaks<br/>
Bright Phoebus, while the mountains still are wet<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With mist, and every bird with him awakes,<br/>
And night is flung off like a mourning suit<br/>
Worn for a husband,&mdash;or some other brute.

</p>
<p>
I say, the sun is a most glorious sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I 've seen him rise full oft, indeed of late<br/>
I have sat up on purpose all the night,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which hastens, as physicians say, one's fate;<br/>
And so all ye, who would be in the right<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In health and purse, begin your day to date<br/>
From daybreak, and when coffin'd at fourscore,<br/>
Engrave upon the plate, you rose at four.

</p>
<p>
And Haidee met the morning face to face;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her own was freshest, though a feverish flush<br/>
Had dyed it with the headlong blood, whose race<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From heart to cheek is curb'd into a blush,<br/>
Like to a torrent which a mountain's base,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That overpowers some Alpine river's rush,<br/>
Checks to a lake, whose waves in circles spread;<br/>
Or the Red Sea&mdash;but the sea is not red.

</p>
<p>
And down the cliff the island virgin came,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And near the cave her quick light footsteps drew,<br/>
While the sun smiled on her with his first flame,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And young Aurora kiss'd her lips with dew,<br/>
Taking her for a sister; just the same<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mistake you would have made on seeing the two,<br/>
Although the mortal, quite as fresh and fair,<br/>
Had all the advantage, too, of not being air.

</p>
<p>
And when into the cavern Haidee stepp'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All timidly, yet rapidly, she saw<br/>
That like an infant Juan sweetly slept;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then she stopp'd, and stood as if in awe<br/>
(For sleep is awful), and on tiptoe crept<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And wrapt him closer, lest the air, too raw,<br/>
Should reach his blood, then o'er him still as death<br/>
Bent with hush'd lips, that drank his scarce-drawn breath.

</p>
<p>
And thus like to an angel o'er the dying<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who die in righteousness, she lean'd; and there<br/>
All tranquilly the shipwreck'd boy was lying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As o'er him the calm and stirless air:<br/>
But Zoe the meantime some eggs was frying,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since, after all, no doubt the youthful pair<br/>
Must breakfast&mdash;and betimes, lest they should ask it,<br/>
She drew out her provision from the basket.

</p>
<p>
She knew that the best feelings must have victual,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that a shipwreck'd youth would hungry be;<br/>
Besides, being less in love, she yawn'd a little,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And felt her veins chill'd by the neighbouring sea;<br/>
And so, she cook'd their breakfast to a tittle;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say that she gave them any tea,<br/>
But there were eggs, fruit, coffee, bread, fish, honey,<br/>
With Scio wine,&mdash;and all for love, not money.

</p>
<p>
And Zoe, when the eggs were ready, and<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The coffee made, would fain have waken'd Juan;<br/>
But Haidee stopp'd her with her quick small hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And without word, a sign her finger drew on<br/>
Her lip, which Zoe needs must understand;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, the first breakfast spoilt, prepared a new one,<br/>
Because her mistress would not let her break<br/>
That sleep which seem'd as it would ne'er awake.

</p>
<p>
For still he lay, and on his thin worn cheek<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A purple hectic play'd like dying day<br/>
On the snow-tops of distant hills; the streak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sufferance yet upon his forehead lay,<br/>
Where the blue veins look'd shadowy, shrunk, and weak;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And his black curls were dewy with the spray,<br/>
Which weigh'd upon them yet, all damp and salt,<br/>
Mix'd with the stony vapours of the vault.

</p>
<p>
And she bent o'er him, and he lay beneath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush'd as the babe upon its mother's breast,<br/>
Droop'd as the willow when no winds can breathe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lull'd like the depth of ocean when at rest,<br/>
Fair as the crowning rose of the whole wreath,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Soft as the callow cygnet in its nest;<br/>
In short, he was a very pretty fellow,<br/>
Although his woes had turn'd him rather yellow.

</p>
<p>
He woke and gazed, and would have slept again,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But the fair face which met his eyes forbade<br/>
Those eyes to close, though weariness and pain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had further sleep a further pleasure made;<br/>
For woman's face was never form'd in vain<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Juan, so that even when he pray'd<br/>
He turn'd from grisly saints, and martyrs hairy,<br/>
To the sweet portraits of the Virgin Mary.

</p>
<p>
And thus upon his elbow he arose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And look'd upon the lady, in whose cheek<br/>
The pale contended with the purple rose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As with an effort she began to speak;<br/>
Her eyes were eloquent, her words would pose,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Although she told him, in good modern Greek,<br/>
With an Ionian accent, low and sweet,<br/>
That he was faint, and must not talk, but eat.

</p>
<p>
Now Juan could not understand a word,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being no Grecian; but he had an ear,<br/>
And her voice was the warble of a bird,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So soft, so sweet, so delicately clear,<br/>
That finer, simpler music ne'er was heard;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sort of sound we echo with a tear,<br/>
Without knowing why&mdash;an overpowering tone,<br/>
Whence Melody descends as from a throne.

</p>
<p>
And Juan gazed as one who is awoke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By a distant organ, doubting if he be<br/>
Not yet a dreamer, till the spell is broke<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By the watchman, or some such reality,<br/>
Or by one's early valet's cursed knock;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At least it is a heavy sound to me,<br/>
Who like a morning slumber&mdash;for the night<br/>
Shows stars and women in a better light.

</p>
<p>
And Juan, too, was help'd out from his dream,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sleep, or whatso'er it was, by feeling<br/>
A most prodigious appetite: the steam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Zoe's cookery no doubt was stealing<br/>
Upon his senses, and the kindling beam<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the new fire, which Zoe kept up, kneeling<br/>
To stir her viands, made him quite awake<br/>
And long for food, but chiefly a beef-steak.

</p>
<p>
But beef is rare within these oxless isles;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Goat's flesh there is, no doubt, and kid, and mutton;<br/>
And, when a holiday upon them smiles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A joint upon their barbarous spits they put on:<br/>
But this occurs but seldom, between whiles,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For some of these are rocks with scarce a hut on;<br/>
Others are fair and fertile, among which<br/>
This, though not large, was one of the most rich.

</p>
<p>
I say that beef is rare, and can't help thinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That the old fable of the Minotaur&mdash;<br/>
From which our modern morals rightly shrinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemn the royal lady's taste who wore<br/>
A cow's shape for a mask&mdash;was only (sinking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The allegory) a mere type, no more,<br/>
That Pasiphae promoted breeding cattle,<br/>
To make the Cretans bloodier in battle.

</p>
<p>
For we all know that English people are<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fed upon beef<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I won't say much of beer,<br/>
Because 't is liquor only, and being far<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From this my subject, has no business here;<br/>
We know, too, they very fond of war,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A pleasure&mdash;like all pleasures&mdash;rather dear;<br/>
So were the Cretans&mdash;from which I infer<br/>
That beef and battles both were owing to her.

</p>
<p>
But to resume. The languid Juan raised<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;His head upon his elbow, and he saw<br/>
A sight on which he had not lately gazed,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As all his latter meals had been quite raw,<br/>
Three or four things, for which the Lord he praised,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, feeling still the famish'd vulture gnaw,<br/>
He fell upon whate'er was offer'd, like<br/>
A priest, a shark, an alderman, or pike.

</p>
<p>
He ate, and he was well supplied: and she,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who watch'd him like a mother, would have fed<br/>
Him past all bounds, because she smiled to see<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such appetite in one she had deem'd dead;<br/>
But Zoe, being older than Haidee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew (by tradition, for she ne'er had read)<br/>
That famish'd people must be slowly nurst,<br/>
And fed by spoonfuls, else they always burst.

</p>
<p>
And so she took the liberty to state,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather by deeds than words, because the case<br/>
Was urgent, that the gentleman, whose fate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had made her mistress quit her bed to trace<br/>
The sea-shore at this hour, must leave his plate,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless he wish'd to die upon the place&mdash;<br/>
She snatch'd it, and refused another morsel,<br/>
Saying, he had gorged enough to make a horse ill.

</p>
<p>
Next they&mdash;he being naked, save a tatter'd<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Pair of scarce decent trowsers&mdash;went to work,<br/>
And in the fire his recent rags they scatter'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dress'd him, for the present, like a Turk,<br/>
Or Greek&mdash;that is, although it not much matter'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Omitting turban, slippers, pistols, dirk,&mdash;<br/>
They furnish'd him, entire, except some stitches,<br/>
With a clean shirt, and very spacious breeches.

</p>
<p>
And then fair Haidee tried her tongue at speaking,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But not a word could Juan comprehend,<br/>
Although he listen'd so that the young Greek in<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her earnestness would ne'er have made an end;<br/>
And, as he interrupted not, went eking<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her speech out to her protege and friend,<br/>
Till pausing at the last her breath to take,<br/>
She saw he did not understand Romaic.

</p>
<p>
And then she had recourse to nods, and signs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiles, and sparkles of the speaking eye,<br/>
And read (the only book she could) the lines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his fair face, and found, by sympathy,<br/>
The answer eloquent, where soul shines<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And darts in one quick glance a long reply;<br/>
And thus in every look she saw exprest<br/>
A world of words, and things at which she guess'd.

</p>
<p>
And now, by dint of fingers and of eyes,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And words repeated after her, he took<br/>
A lesson in her tongue; but by surmise,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt, less of her language than her look:<br/>
As he who studies fervently the skies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns oftener to the stars than to his book,<br/>
Thus Juan learn'd his alpha beta better<br/>
From Haidee's glance than any graven letter.

</p>
<p>
'T is pleasing to be school'd in a strange tongue<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By female lips and eyes&mdash;that is, I mean,<br/>
When both the teacher and the taught are young,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As was the case, at least, where I have been;<br/>
They smile so when one 's right, and when one 's wrong<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They smile still more, and then there intervene<br/>
Pressure of hands, perhaps even a chaste kiss;&mdash;<br/>
I learn'd the little that I know by this:

</p>
<p>
That is, some words of Spanish, Turk, and Greek,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Italian not at all, having no teachers;<br/>
Much English I cannot pretend to speak,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning that language chiefly from its preachers,<br/>
Barrow, South, Tillotson, whom every week<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I study, also Blair, the highest reachers<br/>
Of eloquence in piety and prose&mdash;<br/>
I hate your poets, so read none of those.

</p>
<p>
As for the ladies, I have nought to say,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A wanderer from the British world of fashion,<br/>
Where I, like other 'dogs, have had my day,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Like other men, too, may have had my passion&mdash;<br/>
But that, like other things, has pass'd away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all her fools whom I could lay the lash on:<br/>
Foes, friends, men, women, now are nought to me<br/>
But dreams of what has been, no more to be.

</p>
<p>
Return we to Don Juan. He begun<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To hear new words, and to repeat them; but<br/>
Some feelings, universal as the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were such as could not in his breast be shut<br/>
More than within the bosom of a nun:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He was in love,&mdash;as you would be, no doubt,<br/>
With a young benefactress,&mdash;so was she,<br/>
Just in the way we very often see.

</p>
<p>
And every day by daybreak&mdash;rather early<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For Juan, who was somewhat fond of rest&mdash;<br/>
She came into the cave, but it was merely<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To see her bird reposing in his nest;<br/>
And she would softly stir his locks so curly,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Without disturbing her yet slumbering guest,<br/>
Breathing all gently o'er his cheek and mouth,<br/>
As o'er a bed of roses the sweet south.

</p>
<p>
And every morn his colour freshlier came,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And every day help'd on his convalescence;<br/>
'T was well, because health in the human frame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is pleasant, besides being true love's essence,<br/>
For health and idleness to passion's flame<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Are oil and gunpowder; and some good lessons<br/>
Are also learnt from Ceres and from Bacchus,<br/>
Without whom Venus will not long attack us.

</p>
<p>
While Venus fills the heart (without heart really<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love, though good always, is not quite so good),<br/>
Ceres presents a plate of vermicelli,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For love must be sustain'd like flesh and blood,&mdash;<br/>
While Bacchus pours out wine, or hands a jelly:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Eggs, oysters, too, are amatory food;<br/>
But who is their purveyor from above<br/>
Heaven knows,&mdash;it may be Neptune, Pan, or Jove.

</p>
<p>
When Juan woke he found some good things ready,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A bath, a breakfast, and the finest eyes<br/>
That ever made a youthful heart less steady,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides her maid's as pretty for their size;<br/>
But I have spoken of all this already&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And repetition 's tiresome and unwise,&mdash;<br/>
Well<br/>
&mdash;Juan, after bathing in the sea,<br/>
Came always back to coffee and Haidee.

</p>
<p>
Both were so young, and one so innocent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That bathing pass'd for nothing; Juan seem'd<br/>
To her, as 'twere, the kind of being sent,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of whom these two years she had nightly dream'd,<br/>
A something to be loved, a creature meant<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be her happiness, and whom she deem'd<br/>
To render happy; all who joy would win<br/>
Must share it,<br/>
&mdash;Happiness was born a twin.

</p>
<p>
It was such pleasure to behold him, such<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Enlargement of existence to partake<br/>
Nature with him, to thrill beneath his touch,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch him slumbering, and to see him wake:<br/>
To live with him forever were too much;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But then the thought of parting made her quake;<br/>
He was her own, her ocean-treasure, cast<br/>
Like a rich wreck&mdash;her first love, and her last.

</p>
<p>
And thus a moon roll'd on, and fair Haidee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Paid daily visits to her boy, and took<br/>
Such plentiful precautions, that still he<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain'd unknown within his craggy nook;<br/>
At last her father's prows put out to sea<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain merchantmen upon the look,<br/>
Not as of yore to carry off an Io,<br/>
But three Ragusan vessels, bound for Scio.

</p>
<p>
Then came her freedom, for she had no mother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So that, her father being at sea, she was<br/>
Free as a married woman, or such other<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Female, as where she likes may freely pass,<br/>
Without even the incumbrance of a brother,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The freest she that ever gazed on glass;<br/>
I speak of Christian lands in this comparison,<br/>
Where wives, at least, are seldom kept in garrison.

</p>
<p>
Now she prolong'd her visits and her talk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For they must talk), and he had learnt to say<br/>
So much as to propose to take a walk,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For little had he wander'd since the day<br/>
On which, like a young flower snapp'd from the stalk,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drooping and dewy on the beach he lay,&mdash;<br/>
And thus they walk'd out in the afternoon,<br/>
And saw the sun set opposite the moon.

</p>
<p>
It was a wild and breaker-beaten coast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With cliffs above, and a broad sandy shore,<br/>
Guarded by shoals and rocks as by an host,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With here and there a creek, whose aspect wore<br/>
A better welcome to the tempest-tost;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And rarely ceased the haughty billow's roar,<br/>
Save on the dead long summer days, which make<br/>
The outstretch'd ocean glitter like a lake.

</p>
<p>
And the small ripple spilt upon the beach<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely o'erpass'd the cream of your champagne,<br/>
When o'er the brim the sparkling bumpers reach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That spring-dew of the spirit! the heart's rain!<br/>
Few things surpass old wine; and they may preach<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who please,&mdash;the more because they preach in vain,&mdash;<br/>
Let us have wine and women, mirth and laughter,<br/>
Sermons and soda-water the day after.

</p>
<p>
Man, being reasonable, must get drunk;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best of life is but intoxication:<br/>
Glory, the grape, love, gold, in these are sunk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hopes of all men, and of every nation;<br/>
Without their sap, how branchless were the trunk<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life's strange tree, so fruitful on occasion:<br/>
But to return,<br/>
&mdash;Get very drunk; and when<br/>
You wake with headache, you shall see what then.

</p>
<p>
Ring for your valet&mdash;bid him quickly bring<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hock and soda-water, then you 'll know<br/>
A pleasure worthy Xerxes the great king;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For not the bless'd sherbet, sublimed with snow,<br/>
Nor the first sparkle of the desert-spring,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor Burgundy in all its sunset glow,<br/>
After long travel, ennui, love, or slaughter,<br/>
Vie with that draught of hock and soda-water.

</p>
<p>
The coast<br/>
&mdash;I think it was the coast that<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was just describing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;Yes, it was the coast&mdash;<br/>
Lay at this period quiet as the sky,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sands untumbled, the blue waves untost,<br/>
And all was stillness, save the sea-bird's cry,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And dolphin's leap, and little billow crost<br/>
By some low rock or shelve, that made it fret<br/>
Against the boundary it scarcely wet.

</p>
<p>
And forth they wander'd, her sire being gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said, upon an expedition;<br/>
And mother, brother, guardian, she had none,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save Zoe, who, although with due precision<br/>
She waited on her lady with the sun,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thought daily service was her only mission,<br/>
Bringing warm water, wreathing her long tresses,<br/>
And asking now and then for cast-off dresses.

</p>
<p>
It was the cooling hour, just when the rounded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Red sun sinks down behind the azure hill,<br/>
Which then seems as if the whole earth it bounded,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Circling all nature, hush'd, and dim, and still,<br/>
With the far mountain-crescent half surrounded<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On one side, and the deep sea calm and chill<br/>
Upon the other, and the rosy sky,<br/>
With one star sparkling through it like an eye.

</p>
<p>
And thus they wander'd forth, and hand in hand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the shining pebbles and the shells,<br/>
Glided along the smooth and harden'd sand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in the worn and wild receptacles<br/>
Work'd by the storms, yet work'd as it were plann'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In hollow halls, with sparry roofs and cells,<br/>
They turn'd to rest; and, each clasp'd by an arm,<br/>
Yielded to the deep twilight's purple charm.

</p>
<p>
They look'd up to the sky, whose floating glow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread like a rosy ocean, vast and bright;<br/>
They gazed upon the glittering sea below,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight;<br/>
They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw each other's dark eyes darting light<br/>
Into each other&mdash;and, beholding this,<br/>
Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss;

</p>
<p>
A long, long kiss, a kiss of youth, and love,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauty, all concentrating like rays<br/>
Into one focus, kindled from above;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such kisses as belong to early days,<br/>
Where heart, and soul, and sense, in concert move,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blood 's lava, and the pulse a blaze,<br/>
Each kiss a heart-quake,&mdash;for a kiss's strength,<br/>
I think, it must be reckon'd by its length.

</p>
<p>
By length I mean duration; theirs endured<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven knows how long&mdash;no doubt they never reckon'd;<br/>
And if they had, they could not have secured<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of their sensations to a second:<br/>
They had not spoken; but they felt allured,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As if their souls and lips each other beckon'd,<br/>
Which, being join'd, like swarming bees they clung&mdash;<br/>
Their hearts the flowers from whence the honey sprung.

</p>
<p>
They were alone, but not alone as they<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who shut in chambers think it loneliness;<br/>
The silent ocean, and the starlight bay,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The twilight glow which momently grew less,<br/>
The voiceless sands and dropping caves, that lay<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Around them, made them to each other press,<br/>
As if there were no life beneath the sky<br/>
Save theirs, and that their life could never die.

</p>
<p>
They fear'd no eyes nor ears on that lone beach,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They felt no terrors from the night, they were<br/>
All in all to each other: though their speech<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was broken words, they thought a language there,&mdash;<br/>
And all the burning tongues the passions teach<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Found in one sigh the best interpreter<br/>
Of nature's oracle&mdash;first love,&mdash;that all<br/>
Which Eve has left her daughters since her fall.

</p>
<p>
Haidde spoke not of scruples, ask'd no vows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor offer'd any; she had never heard<br/>
Of plight and promises to be a spouse,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or perils by a loving maid incurr'd;<br/>
She was all which pure ignorance allows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And flew to her young mate like a young bird;<br/>
And, never having dreamt of falsehood, she<br/>
Had not one word to say of constancy.

</p>
<p>
She loved, and was beloved&mdash;she adored,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she was worshipp'd; after nature's fashion,<br/>
Their intense souls, into each other pour'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If souls could die, had perish'd in that passion,&mdash;<br/>
But by degrees their senses were restored,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again to be o'ercome, again to dash on;<br/>
And, beating 'gainst his bosom, Haidee's heart<br/>
Felt as if never more to beat apart.

</p>
<p>
Alas! they were so young, so beautiful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So lonely, loving, helpless, and the hour<br/>
Was that in which the heart is always full,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, having o'er itself no further power,<br/>
Prompts deeds eternity can not annul,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But pays off moments in an endless shower<br/>
Of hell-fire&mdash;all prepared for people giving<br/>
Pleasure or pain to one another living.

</p>
<p>
Alas! for Juan and Haidee! they were<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So loving and so lovely&mdash;till then never,<br/>
Excepting our first parents, such a pair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had run the risk of being damn'd for ever;<br/>
And Haidee, being devout as well as fair,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Had, doubtless, heard about the Stygian river,<br/>
And hell and purgatory&mdash;but forgot<br/>
Just in the very crisis she should not.

</p>
<p>
They look upon each other, and their eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gleam in the moonlight; and her white arm clasps<br/>
Round Juan's head, and his around her lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Half buried in the tresses which it grasps;<br/>
She sits upon his knee, and drinks his sighs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He hers, until they end in broken gasps;<br/>
And thus they form a group that 's quite antique,<br/>
Half naked, loving, natural, and Greek.

</p>
<p>
And when those deep and burning moments pass'd,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Juan sunk to sleep within her arms,<br/>
She slept not, but all tenderly, though fast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustain'd his head upon her bosom's charms;<br/>
And now and then her eye to heaven is cast,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then on the pale cheek her breast now warms,<br/>
Pillow'd on her o'erflowing heart, which pants<br/>
With all it granted, and with all it grants.

</p>
<p>
An infant when it gazes on a light,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A child the moment when it drains the breast,<br/>
A devotee when soars the Host in sight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An Arab with a stranger for a guest,<br/>
A sailor when the prize has struck in fight,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A miser filling his most hoarded chest,<br/>
Feel rapture; but not such true joy are reaping<br/>
As they who watch o'er what they love while sleeping.

</p>
<p>
For there it lies so tranquil, so beloved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All that it hath of life with us is living;<br/>
So gentle, stirless, helpless, and unmoved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all unconscious of the joy 't is giving;<br/>
All it hath felt, inflicted, pass'd, and proved,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hush'd into depths beyond the watcher's diving:<br/>
There lies the thing we love with all its errors<br/>
And all its charms, like death without its terrors.

</p>
<p>
The lady watch'd her lover&mdash;and that hour<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Love's, and Night's, and Ocean's solitude,<br/>
O'erflow'd her soul with their united power;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst the barren sand and rocks so rude<br/>
She and her wave-worn love had made their bower,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where nought upon their passion could intrude,<br/>
And all the stars that crowded the blue space<br/>
Saw nothing happier than her glowing face.

</p>
<p>
Alas! the love of women! it is known<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be a lovely and a fearful thing;<br/>
For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And if 't is lost, life hath no more to bring<br/>
To them but mockeries of the past alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And their revenge is as the tiger's spring,<br/>
Deadly, and quick, and crushing; yet, as real<br/>
Torture is theirs, what they inflict they feel.

</p>
<p>
They are right; for man, to man so oft unjust,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is always so to women; one sole bond<br/>
Awaits them, treachery is all their trust;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Taught to conceal, their bursting hearts despond<br/>
Over their idol, till some wealthier lust<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Buys them in marriage&mdash;and what rests beyond?<br/>
A thankless husband, next a faithless lover,<br/>
Then dressing, nursing, praying, and all 's over.

</p>
<p>
Some take a lover, some take drams or prayers,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some mind their household, others dissipation,<br/>
Some run away, and but exchange their cares,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Losing the advantage of a virtuous station;<br/>
Few changes e'er can better their affairs,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs being an unnatural situation,<br/>
From the dull palace to the dirty hovel:<br/>
Some play the devil, and then write a novel.

</p>
<p>
Haidee was Nature's bride, and knew not this;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Haidee was Passion's child, born where the sun<br/>
Showers triple light, and scorches even the kiss<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of his gazelle-eyed daughters; she was one<br/>
Made but to love, to feel that she was his<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was her chosen: what was said or done<br/>
Elsewhere was nothing. She had naught to fear,<br/>
Hope, care, nor love, beyond, her heart beat here.

</p>
<p>
And oh! that quickening of the heart, that beat!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How much it costs us! yet each rising throb<br/>
Is in its cause as its effect so sweet,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob<br/>
Joy of its alchymy, and to repeat<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine truths; even Conscience, too, has a tough job<br/>
To make us understand each good old maxim,<br/>
So good<br/>
&mdash;I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.

</p>
<p>
And now 't was done&mdash;on the lone shore were plighted<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hearts; the stars, their nuptial torches, shed<br/>
Beauty upon the beautiful they lighted:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ocean their witness, and the cave their bed,<br/>
By their own feelings hallow'd and united,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their priest was Solitude, and they were wed:<br/>
And they were happy, for to their young eyes<br/>
Each was an angel, and earth paradise.

</p>
<p>
O, Love! of whom great Caesar was the suitor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Titus the master, Antony the slave,<br/>
Horace, Catullus, scholars, Ovid tutor,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sappho the sage blue-stocking, in whose grave<br/>
All those may leap who rather would be neuter<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Leucadia's rock still overlooks the wave)&mdash;<br/>
O, Love! thou art the very god of evil,<br/>
For, after all, we cannot call thee devil.

</p>
<p>
Thou mak'st the chaste connubial state precarious,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And jestest with the brows of mightiest men:<br/>
Caesar and Pompey, Mahomet, Belisarius,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have much employ'd the muse of history's pen;<br/>
Their lives and fortunes were extremely various,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such worthies Time will never see again;<br/>
Yet to these four in three things the same luck holds,<br/>
They all were heroes, conquerors, and cuckolds.

</p>
<p>
Thou mak'st philosophers; there 's Epicurus<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Aristippus, a material crew!<br/>
Who to immoral courses would allure us<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By theories quite practicable too;<br/>
If only from the devil they would insure us,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How pleasant were the maxim (not quite new),<br/>
'Eat, drink, and love, what can the rest avail us?'<br/>
So said the royal sage Sardanapalus.

</p>
<p>
But Juan! had he quite forgotten Julia?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And should he have forgotten her so soon?<br/>
I can't but say it seems to me most truly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perplexing question; but, no doubt, the moon<br/>
Does these things for us, and whenever newly<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong palpitation rises, 't is her boon,<br/>
Else how the devil is it that fresh features<br/>
Have such a charm for us poor human creatures?

</p>
<p>
I hate inconstancy<br/>
&mdash;I loathe, detest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Abhor, condemn, abjure the mortal made<br/>
Of such quicksilver clay that in his breast<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No permanent foundation can be laid;<br/>
Love, constant love, has been my constant guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet last night, being at a masquerade,<br/>
I saw the prettiest creature, fresh from Milan,<br/>
Which gave me some sensations like a villain.

</p>
<p>
But soon Philosophy came to my aid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And whisper'd, 'Think of every sacred tie!'<br/>
'I will, my dear Philosophy!' I said,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'But then her teeth, and then, oh, Heaven! her eye!<br/>
I'll just inquire if she be wife or maid,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or neither&mdash;out of curiosity.'<br/>
'Stop!' cried Philosophy, with air so Grecian<br/>
(Though she was masqued then as a fair Venetian);

</p>
<p>
'Stop!' so I stopp'd.<br/>
&mdash;But to return: that which<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Men call inconstancy is nothing more<br/>
Than admiration due where nature's rich<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Profusion with young beauty covers o'er<br/>
Some favour'd object; and as in the niche<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A lovely statue we almost adore,<br/>
This sort of adoration of the real<br/>
Is but a heightening of the 'beau ideal.'

</p>
<p>
'T is the perception of the beautiful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A fine extension of the faculties,<br/>
Platonic, universal, wonderful,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawn from the stars, and filter'd through the skies,<br/>
Without which life would be extremely dull;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, it is the use of our own eyes,<br/>
With one or two small senses added, just<br/>
To hint that flesh is form'd of fiery dust.

</p>
<p>
Yet 't is a painful feeling, and unwilling,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For surely if we always could perceive<br/>
In the same object graces quite as killing<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As when she rose upon us like an Eve,<br/>
'T would save us many a heartache, many a shilling<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(For we must get them any how or grieve),<br/>
Whereas if one sole lady pleased for ever,<br/>
How pleasant for the heart as well as liver!

</p>
<p>
The heart is like the sky, a part of heaven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But changes night and day, too, like the sky;<br/>
Now o'er it clouds and thunder must be driven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And darkness and destruction as on high:<br/>
But when it hath been scorch'd, and pierced, and riven,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its storms expire in water-drops; the eye<br/>
Pours forth at last the heart's blood turn'd to tears,<br/>
Which make the English climate of our years.

</p>
<p>
The liver is the lazaret of bile,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But very rarely executes its function,<br/>
For the first passion stays there such a while,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all the rest creep in and form a junction,<br/>
Life knots of vipers on a dunghill's soil,&mdash;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Rage, fear, hate, jealousy, revenge, compunction,&mdash;<br/>
So that all mischiefs spring up from this entrail,<br/>
Like earthquakes from the hidden fire call'd 'central,'

</p>
<p>
In the mean time, without proceeding more<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this anatomy, I 've finish'd now<br/>
Two hundred and odd stanzas as before,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That being about the number I 'll allow<br/>
Each canto of the twelve, or twenty-four;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And, laying down my pen, I make my bow,<br/>
Leaving Don Juan and Haidee to plead<br/>
For them and theirs with all who deign to read.
