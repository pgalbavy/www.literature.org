<p>It was really no wonder that Johnnie Green's grandmother screamed, when
she and Johnnie and Sandy Chipmunk were on their way to the miller's to
get the wheat ground into flour.
</p>
<p>This was what made the good old lady scream: The ancient horse, Ebenezer,
was picking his way slowly down a steep hill, placing one foot carefully
in front of another, and taking pains not to step on the stones in the
road, so he wouldn't fall.
</p><p>What happened was not Ebenezer's fault at all. You see, he was wearing an
old harness. And just as he was on the steepest part of the hill a strap
broke and the wagon rolled right upon his heels.
</p><p>Now, many horses would have kicked and run, if such a thing had happened
to them. But even when Johnnie's grandmother screamed, old Ebenezer was
not at all frightened. And even when Johnnie cried "Whoa! whoa!" Ebenezer
did not stop. He thought he knew a good deal more about what he ought to
do than Johnnie Green did, for he had been pulling a wagon for almost
twenty years before Johnnie Green was born.
</p><p>Johnnie tugged hard upon the reins. But still old Ebenezer went on
picking his way even more slowly. And he never stopped until he reached
the bottom of the hill. Then he stood stock still; and he looked around
at Johnnie Green, as if to say, "There, young man! I've brought you and
your grandma safe down that hill. And <u>now</u> I'll let you get out of the
wagon, if you want to."
</p><p>Well, Johnnie Green jumped down from his seat and looked at the harness.
</p><p>"Dear me!" his grandmother said. "If we only had a piece of string you
could mend the harness so we could get to the miller's, at least."
</p><p>Johnnie felt in all his pockets. And probably that was the first time he
had ever found himself without plenty of string. There were enough other
things in his pockets--a jackknife and nails, an apple and a lump of
maple sugar, an old broken watch and a willow whistle. But not a single
piece of string could Johnnie Green find.
</p><p>Then he happened to think of the string his father had used to tie up the
sack of wheat. Johnnie stood the sack on end, tipped it against the back
of the seat, so the wheat wouldn't fall out, and unwound the string from
the mouth of the bag.
</p><p>He had hardly begun to tie the harness together when Grandmother Green
screamed again.
</p><p>The horse Ebenezer looked around once more, as if to say, "I wonder
what's come over the old lady."
</p><p>And Johnnie Green turned his head, too.
</p><p>"My goodness!" his grandmother said. "Did you see that? Something ran
right up my back and jumped off my shoulder. There it goes now!" She
pointed at a small object which was scurrying through the roadside fence.
"Why, it was a chipmunk, I do believe!" she cried. "Now, where do you
suppose he came from?"
</p><p>Johnnie Green didn't know. And to tell the truth, he didn't much care.
You see, he felt very proud, mending the harness with nobody to help
him. And he was not interested in chipmunks just then.
</p><p>So Sandy escaped. To be sure, he was so far from home that he didn't know
where he was. But he was so glad to get out of the sack of wheat that he
didn't worry about being lost. He thought he could find some one who
would know where Farmer Green's pasture was.
