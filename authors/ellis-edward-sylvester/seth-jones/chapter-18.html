<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Night, dark and gloomy, slowly settled over the forest. Nothing
was heard save the dull soughing of the wind through the tree-tops,
or the occasional howl of the wolf in the distance, or perhaps
the near scream of the panther. Heavy, tumultuous clouds were
wheeling through the sky, rendering the inky darkness doubly intense,
and shrouding even the clearings in impenetrable gloom.</p>

<p>By and by, the distant rumble of thunder came faintly through
the air, and then a quivering fork of fire, like a stream of blood,
trembled upon the edge of the dark storm-cloud for an instant.
The heavy clouds, growing darker and more awful, poured forward
until they seemed to concentrate in the western sky, where they
towered aloft like some old embattled castle. The thunder grew
heavier, until it sounded like the rolling of chariot wheels over
the courts of heaven, and the red streams of liquid fire streamed
down the dark walls of the Storm Castle. Now and then the subtle
element flamed out into a dazzling, instantaneous flash, and the
bolt burst overhead.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me and step light, for I tell <em>you</em> there’s
enough lightning."</p>

<p>Seth had thoroughly reconnoitered the valley to which we have
referred, and had found, as he expected, that there was an ambush
laid for them. There was a sort of foot-path, apparently worn
by the passing of wild animals, which nearly crossed the valley.
It was here that the Indians supposed the fugitives would be entrapped,
until the death of a too daring member of their party led them
to suspect that their intentions were discovered.</p>

<p>The little band was hours in crossing this valley. Seth, with
an almost inaudible "sh!" would often pause, and they would stand
for many anxious minutes listening intently for the dreaded danger.
Then they would resume their march, stepping with painful slowness.</p>

<p>It was at least three hours after the fugitives commenced this
journey, and when Seth judged that he must be nearly through it,
that he suddenly discovered he was walking in the very path he
had striven so carefully to avoid. He was considerably startled
at this, and left at once.</p>

<p>"Sh! down!" he whispered, turning his face behind him.</p>

<p>They were not ten feet from the path, when they all sank quietly
to the earth. Footsteps were now audible to all. The darkness
was too profound to discern any thing, but all heard their enemies
almost near enough to touch them with the outstretched hand.</p>

<p>The situation of our friends was imminently perilous. The Mohawks
were not passing along the path, as at first supposed, but evidently
searching it! Haldidge and Seth felt that they could not be aware
of their proximity, and yet they knew a discovery was unavoidable.</p>

<p>Seth Jones rose to his feet so silently, that even Haldidge,
who was within a foot of him, did not hear a rustle. He then touched
Haverland’s ear with his mouth, and whispered:</p>

<p>"Scatter with the gal as quick as lightning, for they must find
us out in a minute."</p>

<p>Haverland lifted Ina in his strong arm&mdash;she needed no caution,
and stepped forward. It was impossible not to make some noise,
when the wet bushes brushed against them. The savages heard it
and started cautiously forward. They evidently suspected it was
the fugitives, and had no suspicion that any one was lingering
in the rear. The first warning Seth had, was of a savage running
plump against him.</p>

<p>"Beg your pardon, I didn’t see you," exclaimed Seth, as each
bounded backward. "Curse you," he muttered, "I only wish I could
sight you for a minute."</p>

<p>Seth, Haldidge and Graham were now maneuvering against some five
or six Indians. Had a bright flash of lightning illuminated the
scene, just at this time, it is probable that all would have laughed
outright, at the attitude and movements of themselves. The Indians,
upon finding how near they were to their deadliest enemies, immediately
bounded backward several yards, in order to avoid a too sudden
collision with them. The three whites did precisely the same thing&mdash;each
in his own characteristic way. Seth leaped to one side, crouched
down in his usual panther-like manner, and with his rifle in his
left, and his knife in his right hand, waited until he could settle
in his mind the precise spot upon which one of the savages was
standing, before making a lunge at him.</p>

<p>It would be tedious to narrate the artifices and stratagem resorted
to by these two opposing forces. Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone,
once reached the opposite aides of the Ohio river at the same
moment, and at the same time, each became aware of the presence
of another person upon the other side. These two old hunters and
acquaintances reconnoitered for over <em>twenty-four hours</em>,
before they discovered that they were friends. For nearly two
hours, the Mohawks and the whites maneuvered with the most consummate
skill against each other. Now retreating and leading, dodging
and eluding, each striving to lead the other into some trap that
was as skillfully avoided, until, judging that Haverland was safe,
Seth concluded to retreat himself accordingly, he cautiously withdrew,
and ten minutes later, found himself upon the outermost edge of
the valley.</p>

<p>Ten minutes after Seth departed, Haldidge moved off, of course
unknown to himself, in precisely the same direction. Graham soon
adopted the same course. They all came out of the dangerous valley
within twenty feet of each other. It took them some time before
they came together; but, as each suspected the identity of the
other, this did not require as long as it otherwise would.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," whispered Seth, "I cac’late we’re out of the Valley
of Death. Best give it a wide berth, is the private opinion of
Seth Jones."</p>

<p>"But how about Haverland?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"I think they must have come out near that point," replied the
other.</p>

<p>"Let us move round then, and we’ve got to be spry, for daylight
can’t be far off, and I’m thinking as how them Ingins will find
out that we’ve absconded; and my gracious! won’t they feel cheap?"</p>

<p>Just as the light of morning appeared in the east, they came
upon Haverland, and resumed their journey. No halt was made for
breakfast, for they were all too anxious to get forward upon their
way. In the course of an hour or so, they struck a sort of path,
made by the passage of wild animals, which, besides being so hardened
as to conceal their trail, was easily traveled.</p>

<p>Seth and Haldidge were too experienced woodsmen to relax their
vigilance. They maintained the same duties as before, the former
taking it upon himself to lead the way through the wilderness,
and the latter to guard against danger from behind. The settlement
toward which they were so anxiously hastening, was still several
days distant, and to reach it, it was necessary to cross a river
of considerable breadth. This river was reached by Seth at noon.</p>

<p>"By gracious! I forgot about this!" he exclaimed to himself.
"Wonder if the gal can swim? If she can’t, how are we going to
get her over? Put her on a chip, I s’pose, and let the breeze
blow her across: the rest of us can swim, in course."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, our friends stood consulting upon the bank
of the stream.</p>

<p>This consultation ended in active preparations for crossing on
a raft. Hunting up material for constructing a raft now was the
order of the hour. This was work of extreme difficulty. They had
no instruments except their hunting-knives, and these were little
better than nothing. Large, rotten limbs were broken from the
trees, and placed together by Haverland, who took upon himself
the task of lashing them with withes, while the others collected
wood.</p>

<p>Haldidge went up the river, and Seth and Graham went down. Graham
soon noticed a large, half-decayed log, lying partly in the water.
"Just the thing, exactly! Why it’s a raft itself. This will save
further trouble. Let us launch it at once, and float it up to
the spot," he said, delightedly.</p>

<p>The two approached it, stooped, and were in the very act of lifting
it into the water, when Seth suddenly removed his shoulder, and
arose to the upright position.</p>

<p>"Come, give a lift," said Graham.</p>

<p>"Graham, I guess I wouldn’t take the log, I don’t think it will
answer."</p>

<p>"Won’t answer? Why not? In the name of common sense, give some
reason."</p>

<p>"<em>Let that log alone! Do you understand?</em>"</p>

<p>Graham looked up, and started at the appearance of Seth. His
eyes fairly scintillated and he seemed ready to spring upon him,
for daring to utter a word of dispute.</p>

<p>"Come along with me!" commanded Seth, in a voice hoarse with
passion.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t do to disregard that command; and, taking up his
rifle, Graham lost no time in obeying it. But he wondered greatly
whether Seth was suddenly become crazy or foolish. He followed
him a short distance, and then hastened up beside him. Seeing
that his face had recovered its usual expression, he gained courage
and asked what he meant by such commands?</p>

<p>"Didn’t you take notice that that log was holler?"</p>

<p>"I believe it was, although I did not examine it closely."</p>

<p>"Wal, if you <em>had</em> examined it closely or even loosely,
so that you took a peep into the log, you’d have seen a big Mohawk
curled up there snug and nice!"</p>

<p>"Is it possible! How came you to see him?"</p>

<p>"The minute I seed the log was holler, I had my s’picions that
there might be something or other in it, and I made up my mind
that we shouldn’t undertake to lift it till I knowd how it was.
When I come to look closer, I knowed thar was something sure enough,
for the way the bark was scratched at the mouth showed that plain
enough. It wouldn’t do, you see, to stoop down and peep in, for
like as not the redskin would blaze away smack into my face. So
I jest dropped my cap, and, as I stooped down to pick it up, I
kind of slewed one eye ’round over my shoulder, and, as sure as
blazes, I seen a big moccasin! I did, by gracious! I then proceeded
to argufy the question; and, after considerable discussion, both
in the affirmative and negative, I came unanimously to the conclusion
that as I’d seen an Injin’s foot, if I’d foller it up, I’d be
pretty sure to find the Injin himself; and, moreover, also, if
there was <em>one</em> Injin about, you could make up your mind
that there are plenty more not far off. By gracious! If I hadn’t
looked a little ramparageous, you wouldn’t have let go that log
so very quick, eh?"</p>

<p>"No; you alarmed me considerably. But what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"The cowards are poking around the woods, fixing out some plan
to ambush us again. They’ve no idea we’ve smelt the rat that’s
brewing in the bud, and they’re too cowardly to show their faces
until they find they’ve got to, or let us slip."</p>

<p>"Shall we tell Haverland?"</p>

<p>"No; I will let Haldidge know it, if he hasn’t found it out already.
The raft has got to be made, and we must keep on at it till it’s
finished, as though we knowed every thing was right. Keep still
now, or Alf will notice our talking."</p>

<p>They were so close to the woodman that they changed their conversation.</p>

<p>"No material?" asked Haverland, looking up.</p>

<p>"It’s rather scarce down where we’ve been," replied Graham.</p>

<p>"Shan’t I help you?" asked Ina, looking up archly.</p>

<p>"I guess we won’t need your help as Haldidge seems to have enough
already."</p>

<p>The hunter at this moment approached, bending under the weight
of two heavy limbs. These were instantly lashed together, but
it was found that the raft was much too weak and light, and more
stuff was necessary before it would even float Ina. Accordingly,
Haldidge plunged into the wood again. Seth walked beside him until
they were a few yards away, when he asked:</p>

<p>"Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"What?" asked the hunter in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Over there," answered Seth, jerking his thumb over his shoulder
toward the log mentioned.</p>

<p>"Redskins?"</p>

<p>"I rather guess so."</p>

<p>"I smelt them, awhile ago. You’d better go back and watch Alf.
I’ll get enough wood. Danger!"</p>

<p>"No; they’ll try some game; look out for yourself."</p>

<p>With this, Seth turned on his heel and rejoined Haverland. Graham
was a short distance away cutting withes, which the woodman was
as busily using. As Seth came up he noticed Ina. She was sitting
upon the ground a few feet from her father, and her attention
seemed wholly absorbed with some thing down the stream. Seth watched
her closely.</p>

<p>"Isn’t that a log yonder?" she asked.</p>

<p>Seth looked in the direction indicated. With no small degree
of astonishment, he saw the identical tree which he and Graham
disputed over, afloat in the river. This awoke his apprehensions
and he signaled at once for Haldidge.</p>

<p>"What’s the row?" asked the hunter as he came up.</p>

<p>Seth gave his head a toss down stream, by way of reply, and added,
"Don’t let ’em see you’re watching it, for it might scare ’em."</p>

<p>Nevertheless Haldidge turned square around and took a long, searching
look at the suspicious object.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it?"</p>

<p>"Them Mohawks are the biggest fools I ever heard of, to think
that such an old trick as <em>that</em> can amount to any thing."</p>

<p>"What trick do you mean?" asked Haverland.</p>

<p>"Why, you see that log yonder, half sunk in the water, that we
are all looking at? Well, there are four or five Mohawks behind
that, waiting for us to launch our raft."</p>

<p>"Maybe it’s nothing more than a floating tree or log," said the
woodman.</p>

<p>"Y-e-s," drawled the hunter sarcastically, "<em>maybe</em> so;
I s’pose a log would be very apt to float <em>up</em> stream,
wouldn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Why, is it approaching?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"Not <em>very</em> fast," answered Seth, "for I guess it’s hard
work for them fellers to swim up stream. Ah! by gracious! I understand
the game. Look; don’t you see it’s farther out than it was? They’re
going to get as near the middle as they can, and so close to us
that when we undertake to cross, the current will carry us right
down plump against ’em, when they’ll rise up in their wrath and
devour us. Fact, as sure as you live."</p>

<p>"We might as well understand matters at once," added Haldidge.
"The plan of the Indians is undoubtedly the same as Seth suggests.
In crossing, we cannot help drifting downward, and they are trying
to locate themselves so as to make a collision between us. But
they will make no attack until we are in the water. So you may
keep at work upon the raft, Alf, without any fear, while Seth
and I reconnoiter. Come, Graham, you may as well go along with
us. Let us enter the wood separately at first, and we’ll come
together as soon as we can get out of sight. Act as though we
didn’t suspicion any thing, and I’ll wager my rifle here against
your hat that we’ll outwit the cowards after all."</p>

<p>The three entered the wood as proposed. After going a few yards
they came together again.</p>

<p>"Now," whispered Seth, "by gracious! you will see fun. Follow
close, boys, and keep shady."</p>

<p>Being now fairly within the wood, they proceeded in a direction
parallel with the course of the river, using extreme caution,
for it was more than probable some of the Indian scouts were secreted
in the wood. Keeping entirely away from the river until Seth judged
they were below the suspicious log, they approached it. A reckless
move, at this point, would have been fatal. Fortunately, there
was a species of grass growing from the wood out to a considerable
distance in the water. Through this, they made their way much
after the fashion of snakes. Seth, as usual, was in front, and
it struck Graham that he absolutely slid over the ground without
any exertion on his part.</p>

<p>In a moment, they were down to the river’s brink. They now slowly
raised their heads and peered over and through the grass out into
the river. The log was a short distance above, and they had a
perfect view of the side which was opposite to Haverland. Not
a sign of an Indian was visible. The tree seemed as if anchored
in the middle of the stream.</p>

<p>"There is something there!" whispered Graham.</p>

<p>"&mdash;sh! keep quiet and watch and you’ll see!" admonished Seth.</p>

<p>A moment more, and the log apparently, without any human agency,
slightly changed its position. As it did so, Graham saw something
glisten on the top of it. He was at a loss to understand what
it meant, and turned inquiringly toward Haldidge. The latter had
his keen eye fixed upon it, and there was a grim, exulting smile
upon his face. He motioned for Graham to preserve silence.</p>

<p>As our hero turned his gaze once more toward the river, he saw
that the log was still further into the stream. Something like
polished metal was seen glistening even brighter than before.
He looked carefully, and in a moment saw that there were several
rifles resting upon the surface of it.</p>

<p>While gazing and wondering where the owners of these weapons
could conceal themselves, the water suddenly seemed to part on
the side of the log toward them, and the bronzed face of an Indian
rose to view. Up, up, it went, until the shoulders were out of
the water, when he remained stationary a moment, and peered over
the log at Haverland. Seemingly satisfied, he quietly sank down
into the water again; but Graham noticed that he did not disappear
beneath the surface, where it appeared he had hitherto kept himself,
nestled in so close to the log that almost any one would have
supposed he was a part of it. His head resembled exactly a large
black knot in the wood. Graham now noticed also that there were
two other protuberances, precisely similar to the first. The conclusion
was certain. There were three fully armed Mohawks concealed behind
the log, who were doing their utmost to steal unawares upon the
fugitives.</p>

<p>"Just exactly one apiece, as sure as you live," exclaimed Seth
exultingly. "Get ready each of you for your man. Graham, take
the one nearest this way; you the next one, Haldidge, and I’ll
pick off the last one in the genuine style. Get ready quick, for
I’ve got to hurrah over the way things is coming round."</p>

<p>The three pointed their deathly instruments toward the unsuspicious
savages. Each took a long, deliberate, and certain aim.</p>

<p>"Now, then, together&mdash;<em>fire</em>!"</p>

<p>Simultaneously the three rifles flashed, but that of Seth missed
fire. The others sped true to their aim. Two yells of deathly
agony broke upon the air, and one of the savages sprang half his
entire length out of the water, and then sank like lead to the
bottom. The other clung quivering to the log for a moment, and
then loosening his hold, disappeared beneath the water.</p>

<p>"Thunder and blazes!" exclaimed Seth, springing to his feet,
"hand me your rifle, Graham. Something is the matter with mine,
and that other imp will get away. Quick! hand it here!"</p>

<p>He took the rifle and commenced loading it as rapidly as possible,
keeping his eye upon the Indian who now was swimming desperately
for the other bank.</p>

<p>"Is yer iron loaded, Haldidge?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No; I’ve been watching you and that chap’s doubling, to see
who’ll get the best, so long, that I didn’t think of it."</p>

<p>"Load again, for s’posen this gun should miss fire too, he’d
get off then sure. Wal, my stars! if he isn’t coming out now."</p>

<p>The Indian, as if scorning the danger, rose slowly from the water,
and walked leisurely toward the shelter of the wood.</p>

<p>"Now, my fine feller, see if you can dodge this."</p>

<p>Seth once more aimed at the retreating Indian, and this time
pulled the trigger; but to his unutterable chagrin, the rifle
flashed in the pan! Before Haldidge could finish loading his gun,
and before Seth could even reprime his, the Indian had disappeared
in the wood.</p>

<p>"By the hokey-pokey! what’s got into the guns?" exclaimed Seth
in a perfect fury. "That’s <em>twice</em> I’ve been fooled! Worse’n
two slaps in the face by a purty woman, I’ll swow. Hallo! what’s
that?"</p>

<p>The discharge of a rifle across the river had sent the bullet
so close to him as to whisk off a tuft of his long sandy hair!</p>

<p>"By gracious! that was pretty well done," he exclaimed, scratching
his head as though he was slightly wounded.</p>

<p>"Look out, for heaven’s sake! Get down!" called Graham, seizing
him by the skirt of his hunting dress, and jerking him downward.</p>

<p>"Don’t know but what it <em>is</em> the best plan," replied the
imperturbable Seth, going down on his knees in time to avoid another
foul shot. "There are plenty of the imps about, ain’t there?"</p>

<p>The firing so alarmed Haverland that he desisted from his work,
and sought the shelter of the wood. By this time, too, the afternoon
was so far advanced that darkness had already commenced settling
over the stream and wood. Crossing on the raft was now out of
the question, for it would have been nothing less than suicide
to have attempted it, when their enemies had given them such convincing
evidence of their skill in the use of the rifle, even at a greater
distance than to the middle of the stream. But the river had to
be crossed for all that and the only course left, was to shift
their position to some other place, build a new raft, and make
another place.</p>

<p>There was no excuse for further delay, and the party immediately
set forward. The sky again gave signs of a storm. Several rumbles
of thunder were heard, but the lightning was so distant as to
be of neither benefit or use to them. The sky was filled with
heavy, tumultuous clouds, which rendered the darkness perfectly
intense and impenetrable; and, as none of them understood a foot
of the ground over which they were traveling, it may well be supposed
that their progress was neither rapid nor particularly pleasant.
The booming of the thunder continued, and shortly the rain commenced
falling. The drops were of that big kind which are often formed
in summer, and which rattle through the leaves like a shower of
bullets.</p>

<p>"Can you look ahead, Seth?" asked Graham.</p>

<p>"In course I can. The darkness don’t make no difference not at
all to me. I can see just as well on a dark night as I can in
daylight, and, what is more, <em>I do</em>. I should like to see
me make a misstep or stumble&mdash;"</p>

<p>Further utterance was checked by the speaker pitching, with a
loud splash, head foremost over or into something.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> hurt, Seth?" asked Graham in alarm, yet half tempted
to give way to the mirth that was convulsing those behind him.</p>

<p>"Hurt!" exclaimed the unfortunate one, scrambling to his feet,
"I believe every bone of my body is broken into, and by gracious!
my head is cracked, and both legs put out of joint, the left arm
broke above the elbow, and the right one severed completely!"</p>

<p>Notwithstanding these frightful injuries, the speaker was moving
about with wonderful dexterity.</p>

<p>"My gracious! what do you suppose I’ve tumbled into?" he suddenly
asked.</p>

<p>"Into a pitfall or a hole in the ground," replied Graham. "It’s
my opinion, too, that it will be very easy with this noise we
are making to stumble into the Mohawks’ hands."</p>

<p>"I should think you ought to know that I <em>didn’t</em> fall,"
retorted Seth angrily. "I happened to see sumthin’, and I stepped
forward to see if it would hold my weight. What you are laughing
at, I should like to know!"</p>

<p>"What is it that you have stepped into?" asked Haverland.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing less than a <em>boat</em>, dragged up here by the
varmints, I ’spose."</p>

<p>Such indeed was the case. There was a very large-sized canoe
directly before them, and not a sign of the presence of others
beside themselves. Not a more fortunate thing could have happened.
Upon examination, the boat was found to be of unusual length and
breadth, and amply sufficient to carry twenty men. It was quickly
pushed back into the stream.</p>

<p>"Come, tumble in and we’ll set sail," said Seth.</p>

<p>The fugitives without any hesitation entered the boat, and Seth
and Haldidge, bending their shoulders to it, shoved it into the
river, and sprang in as it floated away.</p>
