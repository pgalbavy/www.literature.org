<p>Lois returned very early.  She had a fire in her bedroom.  She drew
the curtains and stood holding aside a heavy fold, looking out at
the night.  She could see only the nothingness of the fog; not even
the glare of the fair was evident, though the noise clamoured small
in the distance.  In front of everything she could see her own
faint image.  She crossed to the dressing-table, and there leaned
her face to the mirror, and looked at herself.  She looked a long
time, then she rose, changed her dress for a dressing-jacket, and
took up Sesame and Lilies.</p>

<p>Late in the night she was roused from sleep by a bustle in the
house.  She sat up and heard a hurrying to and fro and the sound of
anxious voices.  She put on her dressing-gown and went out to her
mother's room.  Seeing her mother at the head of the stairs, she
said in her quick, clean voice:</p>

<p>&quot;Mother, what it it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, child, don't ask me!  Go to bed, dear, do!  I shall surely be
worried out of my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother, what is it?&quot;  Lois was sharp and emphatic.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope your father won't go.  Now I do hope your father won't go.
He's got a cold as it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mother, tell me what is it?&quot;  Lois took her mother's arm.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Selby's.  I should have thought you would have heard the
fire-engine, and Jack isn't in yet.  I hope we're safe!&quot;  Lois
returned to her bedroom and dressed.  She coiled her plaited hair,
and having put on a cloak, left the house.</p>

<p>She hurried along under the fog-dripping trees towards the meaner
part of the town.  When she got near, she saw a glare in the fog,
and closed her lips tight.  She hastened on till she was in the
crowd.  With peaked, noble face she watched the fire.  Then she
looked a little wildly over the fire-reddened faces in the crowd,
and catching sight of her father, hurried to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Dadda - is he safe?  Is Will safe - ?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Safe, aye, why not?  You've no business here.  Here, here's
Sampson, he'll take you home.  I've enough to bother me; there's my
own place to watch.  Go home now, I can't do with you here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you seen Will?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Go home - Sampson, just take Miss Lois home - now!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't really know where he is - father?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go home now - I don't want you here - &quot; her father ordered
peremptorily.</p>

<p>The tears sprang to Lois' eyes.  She looked at the fire and the
tears were quickly dried by fear.  The flames roared and struggled
upward.  The great wonder of the fire made her forget even her
indignation at her father's light treatment of herself and of her
lover.  There was a crashing and bursting of timber, as the first
floor fell in a mass into the blazing gulf, splashing the fire in
all directions, to the terror of the crowd.  She saw the steel of
the machines growing white-hot and twisting like flaming letters.
Piece after piece of the flooring gave way, and the machines
dropped in red ruin as the wooden framework burned out.  The air
became unbreathable; the fog was swallowed up: sparks went rushing
up as if they would burn the dark heavens; sometimes cards of lace
went whirling into the gulf of the sky, waving with wings of fire.
It was dangerous to stand near this great cup of roaring
destruction.</p>

<p>Sampson, the grey old manager of Buxton and Co's, led her away as
soon as she would turn her face to listen to him.  He was a stout,
irritable man.  He elbowed his way roughly through the crowd, and
Lois followed him, her head high, her lips closed.  He led her for
some distance without speaking, then at last, unable to contain his
garrulous irritability, he broke out:</p>

<p>&quot;What do they expect?  What can they expect?  They can't expect to
stand a bad time.  They spring up like mushrooms as big as a house-
side, but there's no stability in 'em.  I remember William Selby
when he'd run on my errands.  Yes, there's some as can make much
out of little, and there's some as can make much out of nothing,
but they find it won't last.  William Selby's sprung up in a day,
and he'll vanish in a night.  You can't trust to luck alone.  Maybe
he thinks it's a lucky thing this fire has come when things are
looking black.  But you can't get out of it as easy as that.
There's been a few too many of 'em.  No, indeed, a fire's the last
thing I should hope to come to - the very last!&quot;</p>

<p>Lois hurried and hurried, so that she brought the old manager
panting in distress up the steps of her home.  She could not bear
to hear him talking so.  They could get no one to open the door for
some time.  When at last Lois ran upstairs, she found her mother
dressed, but all unbuttoned again, lying back in the chair in her
daughter's room, suffering from palpitation of the heart, with
Sesame and Lilies crushed beneath her.  Lois administered brandy,
and her decisive words and movements helped largely to bring the
good lady to a state of recovery sufficient to allow of her
returning to her own bedroom.</p>

<p>Then Lois locked the door.  She glanced at her fire-darkened face,
and taking the flattened Ruskin out of the chair, sat down and
wept.  After a while she calmed herself, rose, and sponged her
face.  Then once more on that fatal night she prepared for rest.
Instead, however, or retiring, she pulled a silk quilt from her
disordered bed and wrapping it round her, sat miserably to think.
It was two o'clock in the morning.</p>
