<P>It was indeed in itself a great honour for Cornelius van 
Baerle to be confined in the same prison which had once 
received the learned master Grotius.</P>
<P>But on arriving at the prison he met with an honour even 
greater. As chance would have it, the cell formerly 
inhabited by the illustrious Barneveldt happened to be 
vacant, when the clemency of the Prince of Orange sent the 
tulip-fancier Van Baerle there.</P>
<P>The cell had a very bad character at the castle since the 
time when Grotius, by means of the device of his wife, made 
escape from it in that famous book-chest which the jailers 
forgot to examine.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it seemed to Van Baerle an auspicious 
omen that this very cell was assigned to him, for according 
to his ideas, a jailer ought never to have given to a second 
pigeon the cage from which the first had so easily flown.</P>
<P>The cell had an historical character. We will only state 
here that, with the exception of an alcove which was 
contrived there for the use of Madame Grotius, it differed 
in no respect from the other cells of the prison; only, 
perhaps, it was a little higher, and had a splendid view 
from the grated window.</P>
<P>Cornelius felt himself perfectly indifferent as to the place 
where he had to lead an existence which was little more than 
vegetation. There were only two things now for which he 
cared, and the possession of which was a happiness enjoyed 
only in imagination.</P>
<P>A flower, and a woman; both of them, as he conceived, lost 
to him for ever.</P>
<P>Fortunately the good doctor was mistaken. In his prison cell 
the most adventurous life which ever fell to the lot of any 
tulip-fancier was reserved for him.</P>
<P>One morning, whilst at his window inhaling the fresh air 
which came from the river, and casting a longing look to the 
windmills of his dear old city Dort, which were looming in 
the distance behind a forest of chimneys, he saw flocks of 
pigeons coming from that quarter to perch fluttering on the 
pointed gables of Loewestein.</P>
<P>These pigeons, Van Baerle said to himself, are coming from 
Dort, and consequently may return there. By fastening a 
little note to the wing of one of these pigeons, one might 
have a chance to send a message there. Then, after a few 
moments' consideration, he exclaimed,  - </P>
<P>&quot;I will do it.&quot;</P>
<P>A man grows very patient who is twenty-eight years of age, 
and condemned to a prison for life,  -  that is to say, to 
something like twenty-two or twenty-three thousand days of 
captivity.</P>
<P>Van Baerle, from whose thoughts the three bulbs were never 
absent, made a snare for catching the pigeons, baiting the 
birds with all the resources of his kitchen, such as it was 
for eight slivers (sixpence English) a day; and, after a 
month of unsuccessful attempts, he at last caught a female 
bird.</P>
<P>It cost him two more months to catch a male bird; he then 
shut them up together, and having about the beginning of the 
year 1673 obtained some eggs from them, he released the 
female, which, leaving the male behind to hatch the eggs in 
her stead, flew joyously to Dort, with the note under her 
wing.</P>
<P>She returned in the evening. She had preserved the note.</P>
<P>Thus it went on for fifteen days, at first to the 
disappointment, and then to the great grief, of Van Baerle.</P>
<P>On the sixteenth day, at last, she came back without it.</P>
<P>Van Baerle had addressed it to his nurse, the old Frisian 
woman; and implored any charitable soul who might find it to 
convey it to her as safely and as speedily as possible.</P>
<P>In this letter there was a little note enclosed for Rosa.</P>
<P>Van Baerle's nurse had received the letter in the following 
way.</P>
<P>Leaving Dort, Mynheer Isaac Boxtel had abandoned, not only 
his house, his servants, his observatory, and his telescope, 
but also his pigeons.</P>
<P>The servant, having been left without wages, first lived on 
his little savings, and then on his master's pigeons.</P>
<P>Seeing this, the pigeons emigrated from the roof of Isaac 
Boxtel to that of Cornelius van Baerle.</P>
<P>The nurse was a kind-hearted woman, who could not live 
without something to love. She conceived an affection for 
the pigeons which had thrown themselves on her hospitality; 
and when Boxtel's servant reclaimed them with culinary 
intentions, having eaten the first fifteen already, and now 
wishing to eat the other fifteen, she offered to buy them 
from him for a consideration of six stivers per head.</P>
<P>This being just double their value, the man was very glad to 
close the bargain, and the nurse found herself in undisputed 
possession of the pigeons of her master's envious neighbour.</P>
<P>In the course of their wanderings, these pigeons with others 
visited the Hague, Loewestein, and Rotterdam, seeking 
variety, doubtless, in the flavour of their wheat or 
hempseed.</P>
<P>Chance, or rather God, for we can see the hand of God in 
everything, had willed that Cornelius van Baerle should 
happen to hit upon one of these very pigeons.</P>
<P>Therefore, if the envious wretch had not left Dort to follow 
his rival to the Hague in the first place, and then to 
Gorcum or to Loewestein,  -  for the two places are separated 
only by the confluence of the Waal and the Meuse,  -  Van 
Baerle's letter would have fallen into his hands and not the 
nurse's: in which event the poor prisoner, like the raven of 
the Roman cobbler, would have thrown away his time, his 
trouble, and, instead of having to relate the series of 
exciting events which are about to flow from beneath our pen 
like the varied hues of a many coloured tapestry, we should 
have naught to describe but a weary waste of days, dull and 
melancholy and gloomy as night's dark mantle.</P>
<P>The note, as we have said, had reached Van Baerle's nurse.</P>
<P>And also it came to pass, that one evening in the beginning 
of February, just when the stars were beginning to twinkle, 
Cornelius heard on the staircase of the little turret a 
voice which thrilled through him.</P>
<P>He put his hand on his heart, and listened.</P>
<P>It was the sweet harmonious voice of Rosa.</P>
<P>Let us confess it, Cornelius was not so stupefied with 
surprise, or so beyond himself with joy, as he would have 
been but for the pigeon, which, in answer to his letter, had 
brought back hope to him under her empty wing; and, knowing 
Rosa, he expected, if the note had ever reached her, to hear 
of her whom he loved, and also of his three darling bulbs.</P>
<P>He rose, listened once more, and bent forward towards the 
door.</P>
<P>Yes, they were indeed the accents which had fallen so 
sweetly on his heart at the Hague.</P>
<P>The question now was, whether Rosa, who had made the journey 
from the Hague to Loewestein, and who  -  Cornelius did not 
understand how  -  had succeeded even in penetrating into the 
prison, would also be fortunate enough in penetrating to the 
prisoner himself.</P>
<P>Whilst Cornelius, debating this point within himself, was 
building all sorts of castles in the air, and was struggling 
between hope and fear, the shutter of the grating in the 
door opened, and Rosa, beaming with joy, and beautiful in 
her pretty national costume  -  but still more beautiful from 
the grief which for the last five months had blanched her 
cheeks  -  pressed her little face against the wire grating 
of the window, saying to him,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, sir, sir! here I am!&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius stretched out his arms, and, looking to heaven, 
uttered a cry of joy,  - </P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Rosa, Rosa!&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Hush! let us speak low: my father follows on my heels,&quot; 
said the girl.</P>
<P>&quot;Your father?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Yes, he is in the courtyard at the bottom of the staircase, 
receiving the instructions of the Governor; he will 
presently come up.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;The instructions of the Governor?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Listen to me, I'll try to tell you all in a few words. The 
Stadtholder has a country-house, one league distant from 
Leyden, properly speaking a kind of large dairy, and my 
aunt, who was his nurse, has the management of it. As soon 
as I received your letter, which, alas! I could not read 
myself, but which your housekeeper read to me, I hastened to 
my aunt; there I remained until the Prince should come to 
the dairy; and when he came, I asked him as a favour to 
allow my father to exchange his post at the prison of the 
Hague with the jailer of the fortress of Loewestein. The 
Prince could not have suspected my object; had he known it, 
he would have refused my request, but as it is he granted 
it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And so you are here?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As you see.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;And thus I shall see you every day?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;As often as I can manage it.&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;Oh, Rosa, my beautiful Rosa, do you love me a little?&quot;</P>
<P>&quot;A little?&quot; she said, &quot;you make no great pretensions, 
Mynheer Cornelius.&quot;</P>
<P>Cornelius tenderly stretched out his hands towards her, but 
they were only able to touch each other with the tips of 
their fingers through the wire grating.</P>
<P>&quot;Here is my father,&quot; said she.</P>
<P>Rosa then abruptly drew back from the door, and ran to meet 
old Gryphus, who made his appearance at the top of the 
staircase. </P></article>
