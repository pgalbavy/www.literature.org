<p>'<em>HOWLY </em>vargin! what is that?' exclaimed Mickey McSquizzle,
with something like horrified amazement.</p>

<p>'By the Jumping Jehosiphat, naow if that don't, beat all natur'!'</p>

<p>'It's the divil, broke loose, wid full steam on!'</p>

<p>There was good cause for these exclamations upon the part of
the Yankee and Irishman, as they stood on the margin of Wolf Ravine,
and gazed off over the prairie. Several miles to the north, something
like a gigantic man could be seen approaching, apparently at a
rapid gait for a few seconds, when it slackened its speed, until
it scarcely moved.</p>

<p>Occasionally it changed its course, so that it went nearly at
right angles. At such times, its colossal proportions were brought
out in full relief, looking like some Titan as it took its giant
strides over the prairie.</p>

<p>The distance was too great to scrutinize the phenomenon closely;
but they could see that a black volume of smoke issued either
from its mouth or the top of its head, while it was drawing behind
it a sort of carriage, in which a single man was seated, who appeared
to control the movements of the extraordinary being in front of
him.</p>

<p>No wonder that something like superstitious have filled the breasts
of the two men who had ceased hunting for gold, for a few minutes,
to view the singular apparition; for such a thing had scarcely
been dreamed of at that day, by the most imaginative philosophers;
much less had it ever entered the head of these two men on the
western prairies.</p>

<p>'Begorrah, but it's the ould divil, hitched to his throttin 'waging,
wid his ould wife howlding the reins!' exclaimed Mickey, who had
scarcely removed his eyes from the singular object.</p>

<p>'That there critter in the wagon is a man,' said Hopkins, looking
as intently in the same direction. 'It seems to me,' he added,
a moment later, 'that there's somebody else a-sit-ting alongside
of him, either a dog or a boy. Wal, naow, ain't that queer?'</p>

<p>'Begorrah! begorrah! do ye hear that? What shall we do?'</p>

<p>At that instant, a shriek like that of some agonized giant came
home to them across the plains, and both looked around, as if
about to flee in terror; but the curiosity of the Yankee restrained
him. His practical eye saw that whatever it might be, it was a
human contrivance, and there could be nothing supernatural about
it.</p>

<p>'Look!'</p>

<p>Just after giving its ear-splitting screech, it turned straight
toward the two men, and with the black smoke rapidly puffing from
the top of its head, came tearing along at a tremendous rate.</p>

<p>Mickey manifested some nervousness, but he was restrained by
the coolness of Ethan, who kept his position with his eye fixed
keenly upon it.</p>

<p>Coming at such a railroad speed, it was not long in passing the
intervening space. It was yet several hundred yards distant, when
Ethan Hopkins gave Mickey a ringing slap upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>'Jerusalem! who do ye s'pose naow, that man is sitting in the
carriage and holding the reins?'</p>

<p>'Worrah, worrah! why do you ax me, whin I'm so frightened entirely
that I don't know who I am myself?'</p>

<p>'Its Baldy.'</p>

<p>'Git out!' replied the Irishman, but added the next moment, 'am
I shlaping or dhraming? It's Baldy or his ghost.'</p>

<p>It certainly was no ghost, judging from the manner in which it
acted; for he sat with his hat cocked on one side, a pipe in his
mouth, and the two reins in his hands, just as the skillful driver
controls the mettlesome horses and keeps them well in hand.</p>

<p>He was seated upon a large pile of wood, while near nestled a
little hump-backed, bright-eyed boy, whose eyes sparkled with
delight at the performance of the strange machine.</p>

<p>The speed of the steam man gradually slackened, until it came
opposite the men, when it came to a dead halt, and the grinning
'Baldy,' as he was called, (from his having lost his scalp several
years before, by the Indians), tipped his hat and said:</p>

<p>'Glad to see you hain't gone under yit. How'd you git along while
I was gone?'</p>

<p>But the men were hardly able to answer any questions yet, until
they had learned something more about the strange creation before
them. Mickey shied away, as the timid steed does at first sight
of the locomotive, observing which, the boy (at a suggestion from
Baldy), gave a string in his hand a twitch, whereupon the nose
of the wonderful thing threw out a jet of steam with the sharp
screech of the locomotive whistle. Mickey sprung a half dozen
feet backward, and would have run off at full speed down the ravine,
had not Ethan Hopkins caught his arm.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, Mickey, naow! Hain't you ever heard anything
like a locomotive whistle?'</p>

<p>'Worrah, worrah, now, but is that the way the crather blows its
nose? It must have a beautiful voice when it shnores at night.'</p>

<p>Perhaps at this point a description of the singular mechanism
should be given. It was about ten feet in hight, measuring to
the top of the 'stove-pipe hat,' which was fashioned after the
common order of felt coverings, with a broad brim, all painted
a shiny black. The face was made of iron, painted a black color,
with a pair of fearful eves, and a tremendous grinning mouth.
A whistle-like contrivance was trade to answer for the nose. The
steam chest proper and boiler, were where the chest in a human
being is generally supposed to be, extending also into a large
knapsack arrangement over the shoulders and back. A pair of arms,
like projections, held the shafts, and the broad flat feet were
covered with sharp spikes, as though he were the monarch of base-ball
players. The legs were quite long, and the step was natural, except
when running, at which time, the bolt uprightness in the figure
showed different from a human being.</p>

<p>In the knapsack were the valves, by which the steam or water
was examined. In front was a painted imitation of a vest, in which
a door opened to receive the fuel, which, together with the water,
was carried in the wagon, a pipe running along the shaft and connecting
with the boiler.</p>

<p>The lines which the driver held controlled the course of the
steam man; thus, by pulling the strap on the right, a deflection
was caused which turned it in that direction, and the same acted
on the other side. A small rod, which ran along the right shaft,
let out or shut off the steam, as was desired, while a cord, running
along the left, controlled the whistle at the nose.</p>

<p>The legs of this extraordinary mechanism were fully a yard apart,
so as to avoid the danger of its upsetting, and at the same time,
there was given more room for the play of the delicate machinery
within. Long, sharp, spike-like projections adorned those toes
of the immense feet, so that there was little danger of its slipping,
while the length of the legs showed that, under favorable circumstances,
the steam man must be capable of very great speed.</p>

<p>After Ethan Hopkins had some what familiarized himself with the
external appearance of this piece of mechanism, he ventured upon
a more critical examination.</p>

<p>The door being opened in front, showed a mass of glowing coals
lying in the capacious abdomen of the giant; the hissing valves
in the knapsack made themselves apparent, and the top of the hat
or smoke-stack had a sieve-like arrangement, such as is frequently
seen on the locomotive.</p>

<p>There were other little conveniences in the way of creating a
draft, and of shutting it off when too great, which could scarcely
be understood without a scrutiny of the figure itself.</p>

<p>The steam man was a frightful looking object, being painted of
a glossy black, with a pair of white stripes down its legs, and
with a face which was intended to be of a flesh color, but, which
was really a fearful red.</p>

<p>To give the machinery an abundance of room, the steam man was
exceedingly corpulent, swelling out to aldermanic proportions,
which, after all, was little out of harmony with its immense hight.</p>

<p>The wagon dragged behind was an ordinary four-wheeled vehicle,
with springs, and very strong wheels, a framework being arranged,
so that when necessary it could be securely covered. To guard
against the danger of upsetting it was very broad, with low wheels,
which it may be safely said were made to 'hum' when the gentleman
got fairly under way.</p>

<p>Such is a brief and Imperfect description of this wonderful steam
man, as it appeared on its first visit to the Western prairies. </p>
