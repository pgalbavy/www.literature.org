<p>"What was your first impression of Paris, Mr. Van Twiller?" inquired
the young man from East Boston, as I was lighting my cigar in
the corridor of the Hôtel des Michetons after breakfast.</p>

<p>"The first thing I noticed," said I, "was the entire United States
walking down the Boulevard des Italiens."</p>

<p>"And your second impression, sir?" he asked somewhat uncertainly.</p>

<p>"The entire United States walking back again." He lighted a cigarette
and tried to appear cheerful. He knew I possessed two daughters.
A man in possession of such knowledge will endure much.</p>

<p>Presently the stout young man from Chicago came up to request
a light for his cigar. "See Paris and die, eh?" he observed with
odious affability.</p>

<p>"I doubt that the city can be as unhealthy as that," I said coldly.</p>

<p>Defeated, he joined forces with the young man from East Boston,
and they retired to the terrace to sit and hate me.</p>

<p>My daughter Alida, my daughter Dulcima, and I spent our first
day in Paris "<em>ong voitoor</em>" as the denizen of East Boston
informed me later.</p>

<p>"What is your first impression, Alida?" I asked, as our taxi
rolled smoothly down the Avenue de l'Opera.</p>

<p>"Paris? An enormous blossom carved out of stone!&mdash;a huge architectural
Renaissance rose with white stone petals!"</p>

<p>I looked at my pretty daughter with pride.</p>

<p>"That is what Mr. Van Dieman says," she added conscientiously.</p>

<p>My enthusiasm cooled at once.</p>

<p>"Van Dieman exaggerates," I said. "Dulcima, what do you find
to characterize Paris?"</p>

<p>"The gowns!" she cried. "Oh, papa! did you see that girl driving
past just now?"</p>

<p>I opened my guidebook in silence. I <em>had</em> seen her.</p>

<p>The sunshine flooded everything; the scent of flowers filled
the soft air; the city was a garden, sweet with green leaves,
embroidered with green grass&mdash;a garden, too, in architecture,
carved out in silvery gray foliage of stone. The streets are as
smooth and clean as a steamer's deck, with little clear rivulets
running in gutters that seem as inviting as country brooks. It
did not resemble Manhattan.</p>

<p>Paris!</p>

<p>Paris is a big city full of red-legged soldiers.</p>

<p>Paris is a forest of pink and white chestnut blossoms under which
the inhabitants sit without their hats.</p>

<p>Paris is a collection of vistas; at the end of every vista is
a misty masterpiece of architecture; on the summit of every <em>monument</em>
is a masterpiece of sculpture.</p>

<p>Paris is a city of several millions of inhabitants, every inhabitant
holding both hands out to you for a tip.</p>

<p>Paris is a park, smothered in foliage, under which asphalted
streets lead to Paradise.</p>

<p>Paris is a sanitarium so skillfully conducted that nobody can
tell the patients from the physicians; and all the inmates are
firmly convinced that the outside world is mad.</p>

<p>I looked back at the gilded mass of the Opera&mdash;that great pile
of stone set lightly there as the toe of a ballet-girl's satin
slipper&#11834;</p>

<p>"What are you thinking, papa?" asked Alida.</p>

<p>"Nothing," I said hastily, amazed at my own frivolity. "Notice,"
said I, "the exquisite harmony of the sky-line. Here in Paris
the Government regulates the height of buildings. Nothing inharmonious
can be built; the selfishness and indifference of private ownership
which in New York erects skyscrapers around our loveliest architectural
remains, the City Hall, would not be tolerated here, where artistic
<em>ensemble</em> is as necessary to people as the bread they
eat."</p>

<p>"Dear me, where have I read that?" exclaimed Alida innocently.</p>

<p>I said nothing more.</p>

<p>We were now passing through that wing of the Louvre which faces
the Carousal, and we turned sharply to the right under the little
arc, and straight past the Tuileries Gardens, all blooming with
tulips and hyacinths, past the quaint weather-stained statues
of an epoch as dead as its own sculptors, past the long arcades
of the Rivoli, under which human spiders lurk for the tourist
of Cook, and out into the Place de la Concorde&mdash;the finest square
in the world.</p>

<p>The sun glittered on the brass inlaid base on which towered the
monolyth. The splashing of the great fountains filled the air
with a fresh sweet sound. Round us, in a vast circle, sat the
"Cities of France," with "Strasburg" smothered in crêpe and funeral
wreaths, each still stone figure crowned with battlemented crowns
and bearing the carved symbols of their ancient power on time-indented
escutcheons, all of stone.</p>

<p>The fresh wet pavement blazed in the sunshine; men wheeled handcarts
filled with violets or piled high with yellow jonquils and silvery
hyacinths.</p>

<p>Violet, white, and yellow&mdash;these are the colors which Paris wears
in springtime, twined in her chaplet of tender green.</p>

<p>I said this aloud to Dulcima, who replied that they were wearing
blue in Paris this spring, and that she would like to know how
soon we were going to the dressmakers.</p>

<p>Now at last we were rolling up the Champs Elysées, with the Arc
de Triomphe, a bridge of pearl at the end of the finest vista
in the world. Past us galloped gay cavalry officers, out for a
morning canter in the Bois de Boulogne; past us whizzed automobiles
of every hue, shape and species.</p>

<p>Past us, too, trotted shoals of people well diluted by our fellow
countrymen, yet a truly Parisian crowd for all that. Hundreds
of uniforms dotted the throngs; cuirassiers in short blue stable
jackets, sabres hooked under their left elbows, little <em>piou-piou</em>
lads, in baggy red trousers and shakos bound with yellow; hussars
jingling along, wearing jackets of robin's-egg blue faced with
white; chasseurs à Cheval, wearing turquoise blue braided with
black; then came the priests in black, well groomed as jackdaws
in April; policemen in sombre uniforms, wearing sword bayonets;
gendarmes off duty&mdash;for the Republican Guard takes the place of
the Gendarmerie within the walls of Paris; smart officers from
the Fontainebleau artillery school, in cherry-red and black; Saint-Cyr
soldiers in crude blues and reds, with the blue shako smothered
under plumes; then Sisters, in their dark habits and white coifs,
with sweet, serene faces looking out on the sinful world they
spend their lives in praying for.</p>

<p>"Dulcima," I said, "what particular characteristic strikes you
when you watch these passing throngs of women?"</p>

<p>"Their necks; every Parisienne is a beauty from behind&mdash;such
exquisite necks and hair."</p>

<p>"Their ankles," added Alida innocently; "they are the best-shod
women in the world!"</p>

<p>I had noticed something of the sort; in fact, there is no escape
for a man's eyes in Paris. Look where he will, he is bound to
bring up against two neat little shoes trotting along demurely
about their own frivolous business. One cannot help wondering
what that business may be or where those little polished shoes
are going so lightly, tap! tap! across the polished asphalt. And
there are thousands on thousands of such shoes, passing, repassing,
twinkling everywhere, exquisite, shapely, gay little shoes of
Paris, pattering through boulevard and avenue, square, and street
until the whole city takes the cadence, keeping time, day and
night, to the little tripping feet of the Parisienne&mdash;bless her,
heart and sole!</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking, papa?" asked Alida.</p>

<p>"Nothing, child, nothing," I muttered.</p>

<p>We left our taxi and mounted to the top of the Arc de Triomphe.
The world around us was bathed in a delicate haze; silver-gray
and emerald the view stretched on every side from the great Basilica
on Montmârtre to the silent Fortress of Mont-Valerien; from the
vast dome of the Pantheon, springing up like a silver bubble in
the sky, to the dull golden dome of the Invalides, and the dome
of the Val-de-Grâce.</p>

<p>Spite of the Sainte Chapel, with its gilded lace-work, spite
of the bizarre Tour Saint-Jacques, spite of the lean monster raised
by Monsieur Eiffel, straddling the vase Esplanade in the west,
the solid twin towers of Nôtre-Dame dominated the spreading city
by their sheer majesty&mdash;dominated Saint-Sulpice, dominated the
Trocadero, dominated even the Pantheon.</p>

<p>"From those towers," said I, "Quasimodo looked down and saw the
slim body of Esmeralda hanging on the gibbet."</p>

<p>"What became of her goat?" asked Alida, who was fond of pets.</p>

<p>"That reminds me," began Dulcima, "that now we are safely in
Paris we might be allowed to ask papa about that&#11834;"</p>

<p>"There is a steamer which sails for New York to-morrow," I said
calmly. "Any mention of that pig will ensure us staterooms in
half an hour."</p>

<p>Considerably subdued, the girls meekly opened their Baedekers
and patronized the view, while I lighted a cigar and mused.</p>

<p>It was my second cigar that morning. Certainly I was a changed
man&mdash;but was it a change for the better? Within me I felt something
stirring &mdash;I knew not what.</p>

<p>It was that long-buried germ of gayety, that latent uncultivated
and embryotic germ which lies dormant in all Anglo-Saxons; and
usually dies dormant or is drowned in solitary cocktails at a
solemn club.</p>

<p>Certainly I was changing. Van Dieman was right. Doubtless any
change could not be the worse for a man who has not sufficient
intelligence to take care of his own pig.</p>

<p>"There is," said Dulcima, referring to her guidebook, "a café
near here in the Bois de Boulogne, called the Café des Fleurs
de Chine. I should so love to breakfast at a Chinese café."</p>

<p>"With chopsticks!" added Alida, soulfully clasping her gloved
hands.</p>

<p>"Your Café Chinois is doubtless a rendezvous for Apaches," I
said, "but we'll try it if you wish."</p>

<p>I am wondering, now, just what sort of a place that café is,
set like a jewel among the green trees of the Bois. I know it
is expensive, but not very expensive; I know, also, that the dainty
young persons who sipped mint on the terrace appeared to disregard
certain conventionalities which I had been led to believe were
never disregarded in France.</p>

<p>The safest way was to pretend a grave abstraction when their
bright eyes wandered toward one; and I did this, without exactly
knowing why I did.</p>

<p>"I wish," said I to Dulcima, "that Van Dieman were here. He understands
all this surface life one sees in the parks and streets."</p>

<p>"Do you really wish that Mr. Van Dieman were here?" asked Alida,
softly coloring.</p>

<p>I looked at her gravely.</p>

<p>"Because," she said, "I believe he is coming about the middle
of May."</p>

<p>"Oh, he is, is he?" I said, without enthusiasm. "Well, we shall
doubtless be in the Rhine by the middle of May."</p>

<p>"My gowns couldn't be finished until June any way," said Dulcima,
laying her gloved fingers on Alida's chair.</p>

<p>So they were allies, then.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you had ordered any gowns," I said superciliously.</p>

<p>"I haven't&mdash;yet," she said coolly.</p>

<p>"Neither have I," began Alida; but I refused to hear any more.</p>

<p>"When you are at your modistes you may talk gowns until you faint
away," said I; "but now let us try to take an intelligent interest
in this famous and ancient capital of European civilization and
liberty&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Did you notice that girl's gown?" motioned Alida to Dulcima.</p>

<p>I also looked. But it was not the beauty of the gown that I found
so remarkable.</p>

<p>"I wonder," thought <em>I&mdash;"</em>but no matter. I wish that idiot
Van Dieman were here."</p>

<p>That evening, after my daughters had retired, I determined to
sit up later than I ought to. The reckless ideas which Paris inspired
in me, alarmed me now and then. But I was game.</p>

<p>So I seated myself in the moonlit court of the hotel and lighted
an unwise cigar and ordered what concerns nobody except the man
who swallowed it, and, crossing my legs, looked amiably around.</p>

<p>Williams sat at the next table.</p>

<p>"Hello, old sport," he said affably.</p>

<p>"Williams," I said, "guess who I was thinking about a moment
ago."</p>

<p>"A girl?"</p>

<p>"No, of course not. I was thinking of Jim Landon. What ever became
of him?"</p>

<p>"Jim? Oh, he's all right."</p>

<p>"Successful?"</p>

<p>"Very. You ought to have heard of him over there; but I suppose
you don't keep up with art news."</p>

<p>"No," I admitted, ashamed&mdash;"it's rather difficult to keep up
with anything on Long Island. Does Jim Landon live here?"</p>

<p>"In Normandy, with his wife."</p>

<p>"Oh, he got married. Was it that wealthy St. Louis girl who&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No; she married into the British Peerage. No, Landon didn't
do anything of that sort. Quite the contrary."</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he didn't marry his model, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;in a way."</p>

<p>"In a way?"</p>

<p>Williams summoned a waiter who shifted his equipment to my table.</p>

<p>"It's rather an unusual story," he said. "Would you care to hear
it?"</p>

<p>"Does it portray, with your well known literary skill, the confusion
of a parent?" I inquired cautiously. "If it does, don't tell it."</p>

<p>"It doesn't."</p>

<p>"Oh. Nobody puts it all over the old man?"</p>

<p>"No, not in this particular instance. Shall I begin?"</p>

<p>"Shoot," I said.</p>

<p>He began with his usual graceful gesture:</p>

</div>
<p>Landon was dead broke.</p>

<p>As it had not been convenient for him to breakfast that morning,
he was irritable. The mockery of handsome hangings and antique
furniture in the outer studio increased his irritation as he walked
through it into the rough, inner workshop, which was hung with
dusty casts and dreary with clay and plaster.</p>

<p>Here Ellis found him, an hour later, smoking a cigarette to deceive
his appetite, and sulkily wetting down the clay bust of a sheep-faced
old lady&mdash;an order of the post-mortem variety which he was executing
from a gruesome photograph.</p>

<p>"How," inquired Ellis, "is the coy Muse treating you these palmy,
balmy days?"</p>

<p>Landon swore and squirted a spongeful of water over the old lady's
side curls.</p>

<p>"My! my! As bad as that?" commented Ellis, raising his eyebrows.
"I thought you expected to be paid for that tombstone."</p>

<p>"Man, I've been eating, drinking, and sleeping on that tombstone
all winter. Last night I gnawed off the 'Hic Jacet' and washed
it down with the date. There's nothing left."</p>

<p>"You've&mdash;ah&mdash;breakfasted, dear friend?"</p>

<p>"That's all right&#11834;"</p>

<p>"<em>Have</em> you?"</p>

<p>"No. But there's a man from Fourth Avenue coming to buy some
of that superfluous magnificence in the show studio. Besides,
I'll be paid for this old lady in a day or two&mdash; Where are you
going?"</p>

<p>"Out," said Ellis, briefly.</p>

<p>Landon, left alone, threw a bit of wet clay at the doorknob,
stood irresolutely, first on one foot, then on the other; then
with a hearty scowl at the sheep-faced old lady washed her complacent
face with a dripping sponge.</p>

<p>"Williams!" I interrupted violently, "how do you know all those
details?"</p>

<p>"My Lord, man!" he retorted; "I write for a living. I've got
to know them."</p>

<p>"Go on, then," I said.</p>

<p>He went on:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
*       *       *       *       *

</p>
</div>
<p>A few moments later Ellis came in with rolls, milk and fruit.</p>

<p>"That's very decent of you," said Landon, but the other cut him
short, excitedly.</p>

<p>"Jim, who is the divinity I just met in your hallway? Yours?"</p>

<p>"What divinity?"</p>

<p>"Her hair," said Ellis, a little wildly, "is the color of Tuscan
gold; her eyes, ultra marine; and the skin of her is just pure
snow with a brushful of carmine across the lips&mdash;and the Great
Sculptor Himself must have moulded her body&#11834;"</p>

<p>Landon shrugged and buttered a roll. "You let her alone," he
said.</p>

<p>"Reveal to me instantly her name, titles, and quality!" shouted
Ellis, unsheathing a Japanese sword.</p>

<p>"Her name," said Landon, "is O'Connor; her quality is that of
a shopgirl. She is motherless and alone, and inhabits a kennel
across the hall. Don't make eyes at her. She'll probably believe
whatever the first gentlemanly blackguard tells her."</p>

<p>Ellis said: "Why may I not&mdash;in a delicately detached and gayly
impersonal, yet delightfully and evasively irrational manner,
calculated to deceive nobody&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That would sound very funny in the Latin Quarter. This is New
York." He rose, frowning. Presently he picked up the sponge. "Better
let a lonely heart alone, unless you're in earnest," he said,
and flung the sponge back into a bucket of water, dried his hands,
and looked around.</p>

<p>"Have you sold any pictures yet?"</p>

<p>"Not one. I thought I had a Copper King nailed to the easel,
but Fate separated us on a clinch and he got away and disappeared
behind the bars of his safe deposit. How goes the market with
you?"</p>

<p>"Dead. I can live on my furniture for a while."</p>

<p>"I thought you were going in on that competition for the Department
of Peace at Washington."</p>

<p>"I am, if I have enough money left to hire a model."</p>

<p>Ellis rose, twirled his walking-stick meditatively, glanced at
his carefully brushed hat, and placed it gravely on his head.</p>

<p>"Soon," he said cheerfully, "it will be time for straw hats.
But where I'm going to get one I don't know. Poverty used to be
considered funny in the Quarter; but it's no idle jest in this
town. Well &mdash;I'll let your best girl alone, Jim, if you feel
that way about it."</p>

<p>They laughed and shook hands.</p>

<p>In the corridor Ellis looked hard at the closed door opposite,
and his volatile heart gave a tortured thump; he twirled his stick
and sauntered out into Stuyvesant Square.</p>
