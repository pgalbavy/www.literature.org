<p>Dickson McCunn was never to forget the first stage in that pilgrimage.
A little after midday he descended from a grimy third-class carriage
at a little station whose name I have forgotten. In the village
near-by he purchased some new-baked buns and ginger biscuits,
to which he was partial, and followed by the shouts of urchins,
who admired his pack&mdash;"Look at the auld man gaun to the schule"&mdash;he
emerged into open country. The late April noon gleamed like a
frosty morning, but the air, though tonic, was kind. The road
ran over sweeps of moorland where curlews wailed, and into lowland
pastures dotted with very white, very vocal lambs. The young grass
had the warm fragrance of new milk. As he went he munched his
buns, for he had resolved to have no plethoric midday meal, and
presently he found the burnside nook of his fancy, and halted
to smoke. On a patch of turf close to a grey stone bridge he had
out his Walton and read the chapter on "The Chavender or Chub."
The collocation of words delighted him and inspired him to verse.
"Lavender or Lub"&mdash;"Pavender or Pub"&mdash;"Gravender or Grub"&mdash;but
the monosyllables proved too vulgar for poetry. Regretfully he
desisted.</p>

<p>The rest of the road was as idyllic as the start. He would tramp
steadily for a mile or so and then saunter, leaning over bridges
to watch the trout in the pools, admiring from a dry-stone dyke
the unsteady gambols of new-born lambs, kicking up dust from strips
of moor-burn on the heather. Once by a fir-wood he was privileged
to surprise three lunatic hares waltzing. His cheeks glowed with
the sun; he moved in an atmosphere of pastoral, serene and contented.
When the shadows began to lengthen he arrived at the village of
Cloncae, where he proposed to lie. The inn looked dirty, but he
found a decent widow, above whose door ran the legend in home-made
lettering, "Mrs. brockie tea and Coffee," and who was willing
to give him quarters. There he supped handsomely off ham and eggs,
and dipped into a work called <em>Covenanting Worthies</em>, which
garnished a table decorated with sea-shells. At half-past nine
precisely he retired to bed and unhesitating sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning he awoke to a changed world. The sky was grey and
so low that his outlook was bounded by a cabbage garden, while
a surly wind prophesied rain. It was chilly, too, and he had his
breakfast beside the kitchen fire. Mrs. Brockie could not spare
a capital letter for her surname on the signboard, but she exalted
it in her talk. He heard of a multitude of Brockies, ascendant,
descendant and collateral, who seemed to be in a fair way to inherit
the earth. Dickson listened sympathetically, and lingered by the
fire. He felt stiff from yesterday's exercise, and the edge was
off his spirit.</p>

<p>The start was not quite what he had pictured. His pack seemed
heavier, his boots tighter, and his pipe drew badly. The first
miles were all uphill, with a wind tingling his ears, and no colours
in the landscape but brown and grey. Suddenly he awoke to the
fact that he was dismal, and thrust the notion behind him. He
expanded his chest and drew in long draughts of air. He told himself
that this sharp weather was better than sunshine. He remembered
that all travellers in romances battled with mist and rain. Presently
his body recovered comfort and vigour, and his mind worked itself
into cheerfulness.</p>

<p>He overtook a party of tramps and fell into talk with them. He
had always had a fancy for the class, though he had never known
anything nearer it than city beggars. He pictured them as philosophic
vagabonds, full of quaint turns of speech, unconscious Borrovians.
With these samples his disillusionment was speedy. The party was
made up of a ferret-faced man with a red nose, a draggle-tailed
woman, and a child in a crazy perambulator. Their conversation
was one-sided, for it immediately resolved itself into a whining
chronicle of misfortunes and petitions for relief. It cost him
half a crown to be rid of them.</p>

<p>The road was alive with tramps that day. The next one did the
accosting. Hailing Mr. McCunn as "Guv'nor," he asked to be told
the way to Manchester. The objective seemed so enterprising that
Dickson was impelled to ask questions, and heard, in what appeared
to be in the accents of the Colonies, the tale of a career of
unvarying calamity. There was nothing merry or philosophic about
this adventurer. Nay, there was something menacing. He eyed his
companion's waterproof covetously, and declared that he had had
one like it which had been stolen from him the day before. Had
the place been lonely he might have contemplated highway robbery,
but they were at the entrance to a village, and the sight of a
public-house awoke his thirst. Dickson parted with him at the
cost of sixpence for a drink.</p>

<p>He had no more company that morning except an aged stone-breaker
whom he convoyed for half a mile. The stone-breaker also was soured
with the world. He walked with a limp, which, he said, was due
to an accident years before, when he had been run into by "ane
o' thae damned velocipeeds." The word revived in Dickson memories
of his youth, and he was prepared to be friendly. But the ancient
would have none of it. He inquired morosely what he was after,
and, on being told, remarked that he might have learned more sense.
"It's a daft-like thing for an auld man like you to be traivellin'
the roads. Ye maun be ill-off for a job." Questioned as to himself
he became, as the newspapers say, "reticent," and having reached
his bing of stones, turned rudely to his duties. "Awa' hame wi'
ye," were his parting words. "It's idle scoondrels like you that
maks wark for honest folk like me."</p>

<p>The morning was not a success, but the strong air had given Dickson
such an appetite that he resolved to break his rule, and, on reaching
the little town of Kilchrist, he sought luncheon at the chief
hotel. There he found that which revived his spirits. A solitary
bagman shared the meal, who revealed the fact that he was in the
grocery line. There followed a well-informed and most technical
conversation. He was drawn to speak of the United Supply Stores,
Limited, of their prospects and of their predecessor, Mr. McCunn,
whom he knew well by repute but had never met. "Yon's the clever
one," he observed. "I've always said there's no longer head in
the city of Glasgow than McCunn. An old-fashioned firm, but it
has aye managed to keep up with the times. He's just retired,
they tell me, and in my opinion it's a big loss to the provision
trade...." Dickson's heart glowed within him. Here was Romance;
to be praised incognito; to enter a casual inn and find that fame
had preceded him. He warmed to the bagman, insisted on giving
him a liqueur and a cigar, and finally revealed himself. "I'm
Dickson McCunn," he said, "taking a bit holiday. If there's anything
I can do for you when I get back, just let me know." With mutual
esteem they parted.</p>

<p>He had need of all his good spirits, for he emerged into an unrelenting
drizzle. The environs of Kilchrist are at the best unlovely, and
in the wet they were as melancholy as a graveyard. But the encounter
with the bagman had worked wonders with Dickson, and he strode
lustily into the weather, his waterproof collar buttoned round
his chin. The road climbed to a bare moor, where lagoons had formed
in the ruts, and the mist showed on each side only a yard or two
of soaking heather. Soon he was wet; presently every part of him,
boots, body and pack, was one vast sponge. The waterproof was
not water-proof, and the rain penetrated to his most intimate
garments. Little he cared. He felt lighter, younger, than on the
idyllic previous day. He enjoyed the buffets of the storm, and
one wet mile succeeded another to the accompaniment of Dickson's
shouts and laughter. There was no one abroad that afternoon, so
he could talk aloud to himself and repeat his favourite poems.
About five in the evening there presented himself at the Black
Bull Inn at Kirkmichael a soaked, disreputable, but most cheerful
traveller.</p>

<p>Now the Black Bull at Kirkmichael is one of the few very good
inns left in the world. It is an old place and an hospitable,
for it has been for generations a haunt of anglers, who above
all other men understand comfort. There are always bright fires
there, and hot water, and old soft leather armchairs, and an aroma
of good food and good tobacco, and giant trout in glass cases,
and pictures of Captain Barclay of Urie walking to London, and
Mr. Ramsay of Barnton winning a horse-race, and the three-volume
edition of the Waverley Novels with many volumes missing, and
indeed all those things which an inn should have. Also there used
to be&mdash;there may still be&mdash;sound vintage claret in the cellars.
The Black Bull expects its guests to arrive in every stage of
dishevelment, and Dickson was received by a cordial landlord,
who offered dry garments as a matter of course. The pack proved
to have resisted the elements, and a suit of clothes and slippers
were provided by the house. Dickson, after a glass of toddy, wallowed
in a hot bath, which washed all the stiffness out of him. He had
a fire in his bedroom, beside which he wrote the opening passages
of that diary he had vowed to keep, descanting lyrically upon
the joys of ill weather. At seven o'clock, warm and satisfied
in soul, and with his body clad in raiment several sizes too large
for it, he descended to dinner.</p>

<p>At one end of the long table in the dining-room sat a group of
anglers. They looked jovial fellows, and Dickson would fain have
joined them; but, having been fishing all day in the Loch o' the
Threshes, they were talking their own talk, and he feared that
his admiration for Izaak Walton did not qualify him to butt into
the erudite discussions of fishermen. The landlord seemed to think
likewise, for he drew back a chair for him at the other end, where
sat a young man absorbed in a book. Dickson gave him good evening
and got an abstracted reply. The young man supped the Black Bull's
excellent broth with one hand, and with the other turned the pages
of his volume. A glance convinced Dickson that the work was French,
a literature which did not interest him. He knew little of the
tongue and suspected it of impropriety.</p>

<p>Another guest entered and took the chair opposite the bookish
young man. He was also young&mdash;not more than thirty-three&mdash;and
to Dickson's eye, was the kind of person he would have liked to
resemble. He was tall and free from any superfluous flesh; his
face was lean, fine-drawn and deeply sunburnt so that the hair
above showed oddly pale; the hands were brown and beautifully
shaped, but the forearm revealed by the loose cuffs of his shirt
was as brawny as a blacksmith's. He had rather pale blue eyes,
which seemed to have looked much at the sun, and a small moustache
the colour of ripe hay. His voice was low and pleasant, and he
pronounced his words precisely, like a foreigner.</p>

<p>He was very ready to talk, but in defiance of Dr. Johnson's warning,
his talk was all questions. He wanted to know everything about
the neighbourhood&mdash;who lived in what houses, what were the distances
between the towns, what harbours would admit what class of vessel.
Smiling agreeably, he put Dickson through a catechism to which
he knew none of the answers. The landlord was called in, and proved
more helpful. But on one matter he was fairly at a loss. The catechist
asked about a house called Darkwater, and was met with a shake
of the head. "I know no sic-like name in this countryside, sir,"
and the catechist looked disappointed.</p>

<p>The literary young man said nothing, but ate trout abstractedly,
one eye on his book. The fish had been caught by the anglers in
the Loch o' the Threshes, and phrases describing their capture
floated from the other end of the table. The young man had a second
helping, and then refused the excellent hill mutton that followed,
contenting himself with cheese. Not so Dickson and the catechist.
They ate everything that was set before them, topping up with
a glass of port. Then the latter, who had been talking illuminatingly
about Spain, rose, bowed and left the table, leaving Dickson,
who liked to linger over his meals, to the society of the ichthyophagous
student.</p>

<p>He nodded towards the book. "Interesting?" he asked.</p>

<p>The young man shook his head and displayed the name on the cover.
"Anatole France. I used to be crazy about him, but now he seems
rather a back number." Then he glanced towards the just-vacated
chair. "Australian," he said.</p>

<p>"How d'you know?"</p>

<p>"Can't mistake them. There's nothing else so lean and fine produced
on the globe to-day. I was next door to them at Pozières and saw
them fight. Lord! Such men! Now and then you had a freak, but
most looked like Phoebus Apollo."</p>

<p>Dickson gazed with a new respect at his neighbour, for he had
not associated him with battle-fields. During the war he had been
a fervent patriot, but, though he had never heard a shot himself,
so many of his friends' sons and nephews, not to mention cousins
of his own, had seen service, that he had come to regard the experience
as commonplace. Lions in Africa and bandits in Mexico seemed to
him novel and romantic things, but not trenches and airplanes
which were the whole world's property. But he could scarcely fit
his neighbour into even his haziest picture of war. The young
man was tall and a little round-shouldered; he had short-sighted,
rather prominent brown eyes, untidy black hair and dark eyebrows
which came near to meeting. He wore a knickerbocker suit of bluish-grey
tweed, a pale blue shirt, a pale blue collar and a dark blue tie&mdash;a
symphony of colour which seemed too elaborately considered to
be quite natural. Dickson had set him down as an artist or a newspaper
correspondent, objects to him of lively interest. But now the
classification must be reconsidered.</p>

<p>"So you were in the war," he said encouragingly.</p>

<p>"Four blasted years," was the savage reply. "And I never want
to hear the name of the beastly thing again."</p>

<p>"You said he was an Australian," said Dickson, casting back.
"But I thought Australians had a queer accent, like the English."</p>

<p>"They've all kind of accents, but you can never mistake their
voice. It's got the sun in it. Canadians have got grinding ice
in theirs, and Virginians have got butter. So have the Irish.
In Britain there are no voices, only speaking tubes. It isn't
safe to judge men by their accent only. You yourself I take to
be Scotch, but for all I know you may be a senator from Chicago
or a Boer General."</p>

<p>"I'm from Glasgow. My name's Dickson McCunn." He had a faint
hope that the announcement might affect the other as it had affected
the bagman at Kilchrist.</p>

<p>"Golly, what a name!" exclaimed the young man rudely.</p>

<p>Dickson was nettled. "It's very old Highland," he said. "It means
the son of a dog."</p>

<p>"Which &mdash;Christian name or surname?" Then the young man
appeared to think he had gone too far, for he smiled pleasantly.
"And a very good name too. Mine is prosaic by comparison. They
call me John Heritage."</p>

<p>"That," said Dickson, mollified, "is like a name out of a book.
With that name by rights you should be a poet."</p>

<p>Gloom settled on the young man's countenance. "It's a dashed
sight too poetic. It's like Edwin Arnold and Alfred Austin and
Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Great poets have vulgar monosyllables
for names, like Keats. The new Shakespeare when he comes along
will probably be called Grubb or Jubber, if he isn't Jones. With
a name like yours I might have a chance. <em>You</em> should be
the poet."</p>

<p>"I'm very fond of reading," said Dickson modestly.</p>

<p>A slow smile crumpled Mr. Heritage's face. "There's a fire in
the smoking-room," he observed as he rose. "We'd better bag the
armchairs before these fishing louts take them." Dickson followed
obediently. This was the kind of chance acquaintance for whom
he had hoped, and he was prepared to make the most of him.</p>

<p>The fire burned bright in the little dusky smoking-room, lighted
by one oil-lamp. Mr. Heritage flung himself into a chair, stretched
his long legs and lit a pipe.</p>

<p>"You like reading?" he asked. "What sort? Any use for poetry?"</p>

<p>"Plenty," said Dickson. "I've aye been fond of learning it up
and repeating it to myself when I had nothing to do. In church
and waiting on trains, like. It used to be Tennyson, but now it's
more Browning. I can say a lot of Browning."</p>

<p>The other screwed his face into an expression of disgust. "I
know the stuff. 'Damask cheeks and dewy sister eyelids.' Or else
the Ercles vein&mdash;'God's in His Heaven, all's right with the world.'
No good, Mr. McCunn. All back numbers. Poetry's not a thing of
pretty round phrases or noisy invocations. It's life itself, with
the tang of the raw world in it&mdash;not a sweetmeat for middle-class
women in parlours."</p>

<p>"Are you a poet, Mr. Heritage?"</p>

<p>"No, Dogson, I'm a paper-maker."</p>

<p>This was a new view to Mr. McCunn. "I just once knew a paper-maker,"
he observed reflectively. "They called him Tosh. He drank a bit."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't drink," said the other. "I'm a paper-maker, but
that's for my bread and butter. Some day for my own sake I may
be a poet."</p>

<p>"Have you published anything?"</p>

<p>The eager admiration in Dickson's tone gratified Mr. Heritage.
He drew from his pocket a slim book. "My firstfruits," he said,
rather shyly.</p>

<p>Dickson received it with reverence. It was a small volume in
grey paper boards with a white label on the back, and it was lettered:
"<em>Whorls &mdash;John Heritage's Book</em>." He turned the pages
and read a little. "It's a nice wee book," he observed at length.</p>

<p>"Good God, if you call it nice, I must have failed pretty badly,"
was the irritated answer.</p>

<p>Dickson read more deeply and was puzzled. It seemed worse than
the worst of Browning to understand. He found one poem about a
garden entitled "Revue." "Crimson and resonant clangs the dawn,"
said the poet. Then he went on to describe noonday:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"Sunflowers, tall Grenadiers, ogle the roses' short-skirted ballet.<br/>
&nbsp;The fumes of dark sweet wine hidden in frail petals<br/>
&nbsp;Madden the drunkard bees."

</p>
</div>
<p>This seemed to him an odd way to look at things, and he boggled
over a phrase about an "epicene lily." Then came evening: "The
painted gauze of the stars flutters in a fold of twilight crape,"
sang Mr. Heritage; and again, "The moon's pale leprosy sloughs
the fields."</p>

<p>Dickson turned to other verses which apparently enshrined the
writer's memory of the trenches. They were largely compounded
of oaths, and rather horrible, lingering lovingly over sights
and smells which every one is aware of, but most people contrive
to forget. He did not like them. Finally he skimmed a poem about
a lady who turned into a bird. The evolution was described with
intimate anatomical details which scared the honest reader.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes on the book for he did not know what to say.
The trick seemed to be to describe nature in metaphors mostly
drawn from music-halls and haberdashers' shops, and, when at a
loss, to fall to cursing. He thought it frankly very bad, and
he laboured to find words which would combine politeness and honesty.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the poet.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of fine things here, but&mdash;but the lines don't
just seem to scan very well."</p>

<p>Mr. Heritage laughed. "Now I can place you exactly. You like
the meek rhyme and the conventional epithet. Well, I don't. The
world has passed beyond that prettiness. You want the moon described
as a Huntress or a gold disc or a flower &mdash;I say it's oftener
like a beer barrel or a cheese. You want a wealth of jolly words
and real things ruled out as unfit for poetry. I say there's nothing
unfit for poetry. Nothing, Dogson! Poetry's everywhere, and the
real thing is commoner among drabs and pot-houses and rubbish
heaps than in your Sunday parlours. The poet's business is to
distil it out of rottenness, and show that it is all one spirit,
the thing that keeps the stars in their place.... I wanted to
call my book '<em>Drains</em>,' for drains are sheer poetry, carrying
off the excess and discards of human life to make the fields green
and the corn ripen. But the publishers kicked. So I called it
'<em>Whorls</em>,' to express my view of the exquisite involution
of all things. Poetry is the fourth dimension of the soul....
Well, let's hear about your taste in prose."</p>

<p>Mr. McCunn was much bewildered, and a little inclined to be cross.
He disliked being called Dogson, which seemed to him an abuse
of his etymological confidences. But his habit of politeness held.</p>

<p>He explained rather haltingly his preferences in prose.</p>

<p>Mr. Heritage listened with wrinkled brows.</p>

<p>"You're even deeper in the mud than I thought," he remarked.
"You live in a world of painted laths and shadows. All this passion
for the picturesque! Trash, my dear man, like a schoolgirl's novelette
heroes. You make up romances about gipsies and sailors and the
blackguards they call pioneers, but you know nothing about them.
If you did, you would find they had none of the gilt and gloss
you imagine. But the great things they have got in common with
all humanity you ignore. It's like&mdash;it's like sentimentalising
about a pancake because it looked like a buttercup, and all the
while not knowing that it was good to eat."</p>

<p>At that moment the Australian entered the room to get a light
for his pipe. He wore a motor-cyclist's overalls and appeared
to be about to take the road. He bade them good night and it seemed
to Dickson that his face, seen in the glow of the fire, was drawn
and anxious, unlike that of the agreeable companion at dinner.</p>

<p>"There," said Mr. Heritage, nodding after the departing figure.
"I dare say you have been telling yourself stories about that
chap&mdash;life in the bush, stock-riding and the rest of it. But probably
he's a bank-clerk from Melbourne.... Your romanticism is one vast
self-delusion and it blinds your eye to the real thing. We have
got to clear it out and with it all the damnable humbug of the
Kelt."</p>

<p>Mr. McCunn, who spelt the word with a soft "C," was puzzled.
"I thought a kelt was a kind of a no-weel fish," he interposed.</p>

<p>But the other, in the flood-tide of his argument, ignored the
interruption. "That's the value of the war," he went on. "It has
burst up all the old conventions, and we've got to finish the
destruction before we can build. It is the same with literature
and religion and society and politics. At them with the axe, say
I. I have no use for priests and pedants. I've no use for upper
classes and middle classes. There's only one class that matters,
the plain man, the workers, who live close to life."</p>

<p>"The place for you," said Dickson dryly, "is in Russia among
the Bolsheviks."</p>

<p>Mr. Heritage approved. "They are doing a great work in their
own fashion. We needn't imitate all their methods&mdash;they're a trifle
crude and have too many Jews among them&mdash;but they've got hold
of the right end of the stick. They seek truth and reality."</p>

<p>Mr. McCunn was slowly being roused.</p>

<p>"What brings you wandering hereaways?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Exercise," was the answer. "I've been kept pretty closely tied
up all winter. And I want leisure and quiet to think over things."</p>

<p>"Well, there's one subject you might turn your attention to.
You'll have been educated like a gentleman?"</p>

<p>"Nine wasted years&mdash;five at Harrow, four at Cambridge."</p>

<p>"See here, then. You're daft about the working-class and have
no use for any other. But what in the name of goodness do you
know about working-men?... I come out of them myself, and have
lived next door to them all my days. Take them one way and another,
they're a decent sort, good and bad like the rest of us. But there's
a wheen daft folk that would set them up as models&mdash;close to truth
and reality, says you. It's sheer ignorance, for you're about
as well acquaint with the working-man as with King Solomon. You
say I make up fine stories about tinklers and sailor-men because
I know nothing about them. That's maybe true. But you're at the
same job yourself. You ideelise the working-man, you and your
kind, because you're ignorant. You say that he's seeking for truth,
when he's only looking for a drink and a rise in wages. You tell
me he's near reality, but I tell you that his notion of reality
is often just a short working day and looking on at a footba'-match
on Saturday.... And when you run down what you call the middle-classes
that do three-quarters of the world's work and keep the machine
going and the working man in a job, then I tell you you're talking
havers. Havers!"</p>

<p>Mr. McCunn, having delivered his defence of the bourgeoisie,
rose abruptly and went to bed. He felt jarred and irritated. His
innocent little private domain had been badly trampled by this
stray bull of a poet. But as he lay in bed, before blowing out
his candle, he had recourse to Walton, and found a passage on
which, as on a pillow, he went peacefully to sleep:</p>

<div class="w3-container w3-justify poem">
<span></span>
<p>
"As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a second<br/>
pleasure entertained me; 'twas a handsome milkmaid, that had not yet<br/>
attained so much age and wisdom as to load her mind with any fears<br/>
of many things that will never be, as too many men too often do; but<br/>
she cast away all care, and sang like a nightingale; her voice was<br/>
good, and the ditty fitted for it; it was the smooth song that was<br/>
made by <em>Kit Marlow</em> now at least fifty years ago. And the<br/>
milkmaid's mother sung an answer to it, which was made by <em>Sir<br/>
Walter Raleigh</em> in his younger days. They were old-fashioned poetry,<br/>
but choicely good; I think much better than the strong lines that<br/>
are now in fashion in this critical age."
