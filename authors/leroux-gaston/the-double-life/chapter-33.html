<p><em>THEY </em>had been sleeping on a soft soil or decayed vegetable
matter, the sight of which had drawn from M. Mifroid the remark
that it was a good omen for the near future. Their travels up
to the present had been without incident, except for some differences
of opinion between them. The subterranean galleries, lit up by
the electric lamps, were sometimes vast, sometimes straight, sometimes
rounded out like the vault of a cathedral, then square and regular,
and so narrow that they had to crawl on their knees to get through.
They had by this time become silent, except for a remark or two
upon the variety of the strata they were passing through. Here
was rock, here clay, here sand, and so on.</p>

<p>It could not, however, last much longer. For forty-eight hours
they had been walking, without coming across any water. M. Mifroid,
however, hoped on, and we will soon see how justified he was.
He hoped at least to come across some water or vegetation.</p>

<p>They estimated it to be about four o’clock in the afternoon,
when Théophraste rose, and, tightening his belt, prepared to start
on another tramp. This time he did not speak of his hunger or
thirst, but walked on in that silence which weakness brings on
men. They had been walking about an hour when it was noticed that
the temperature had become much higher, and they both involuntarily
took off their coats. Soon the perspiration began to pour off
their foreheads, and they began to wonder how this change could
have come about. Were they going toward the center of the earth?
How could it be accounted for? In two hours the temperature had
risen from 60 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. M. Mifroid knew of some
galleries 79 meters below the ground, but who could estimate what
depth they were at now?</p>

<p>Their electric lamps spread their brilliancy around them as they
advanced, now discussing the cause of this phenomenon. Suddenly
the walls of the galleries spread out, and they found themselves
in a cave of such large dimensions that even with their strong
lights they could not see the farther ends. What was their joy
and amazement when they found before them a beautiful lake, the
banks of which were covered with a thick carpet of moss, and in
the crystal transparency of which they saw fish with beautifully
colored scales. The fish had no eyes, and did not appear timid.
They disported themselves in the water, coming quite close to
where the two astonished men stood. They could easily catch them
by leaning over. A flock of ducks were swimming about in the enchanted
water.</p>

<p>M. Théophraste wept with joy on seeing this wonderful sight,
and cried out softly, for he was afraid of disturbing them: "My
friend, what did I say? Isn’t this better than all earthly scenes?"</p>

<p>M. Mifroid felt somewhat humiliated at not knowing this before,
but soon regained his influence over Théophraste, who was beginning
to get excited over this wonderful sight. He made him sit down
on the bank, so as not to frighten the ducks, and began explaining
to him that what they saw was quite natural. He explained that
it was caused by the soil, and that the water had collected here
by the action of the heat.</p>

<p>Théophraste was for throwing himself into the water at once,
and would have done so if they had not suddenly seen a sight which
riveted them to the very ground. Neither of them spoke. Their
tongues were paralyzed. Their electric light revealed, far ahead
of them, but not far enough for them to lose a single detail,
the figure of a woman. She was quite naked, and had her back toward
them. Never before had they seen a form so elegant and so graceful.</p>

<p>This first view, however, lasted only an instant, for she threw
herself into the water and swam away with the grace and ease of
a swan.</p>

<p>The apparition had the effect of making them forget the ducks,
and they both forgot the hunger which gnawed at their vitals.
They had hoped that she would not vanish, and that their presence
would remain unnoticed.</p>

<p>After several plunges, the nymph, shaking the pearly drops from
her beautiful body into the sleeping waters, emerged not far away
from where they stood, but always with her back turned.</p>

<p>What quarry of Carrara ever gave to the world more precious or
purer a marble? By what miracle of the divine fires can we contemplate
those lines of definitive beauty? It was the form of a Greek statue,
and her arms were as graceful as one could wish to imagine on
the Venus de Milo.</p>

<p>They waited in silence for her to turn around, while she disported
herself on the green moss. Soon their curiosity was satisfied,
and she suddenly turned. Neither of them could restrain a cry
of horror, which made the Venus plunge back into the water. She
had no eyes, and there was nothing in their place. Her ears, which
were hidden from their sight by the profusion of hair, stood out
like horns. But that which terrified them most was her enormous,
snout-like red nose.</p>

<p>They had hardly recovered from their first surprise when another
young female, clothed in a light tunic, came unexpectedly on the
bank, holding in her arms a long gown. She also had a nose like
the other, and no eyes.</p>

<p>The Venus came toward her companion on the bank, and the latter
said: "They are silent now, and not saying a word."</p>

<p>"Ha, Saint Mary, they shall have no pardon! They are traitors.
Do you know what our people are doing? Go and find out; I want
to know." She spoke in the purest French of the fourteenth century,
and the delicacy and sweetness of her voice was like the rippling
water of a brook. The two men watched and listened in amazement.
They stood still and stared before them. They felt that a great
miracle was being wrought.</p>

<p>Suddenly they were surrounded by thirty or more men, who seemed
to have come from out of the very rocks. They stood around them,
gesticulating and talking vehemently, but in very low voices.
They too had no eyes, but their ears were developed to a surprising
size. On each of their hands they had ten fingers, and they had
ten toes to each foot. As they came into the glare of the electric
light, they held their hands up to their red snouts, as if they
had smelled a disagreeable odor. They all mumbled in half-audible
tones: "Lady Jane de Montfort, Demoiselle de Coucy," and it was
easy to see that they referred to the ladies who had been disturbed.
As they passed they felt the faces of the two men. They just touched
them lightly, and in doing so moved away in an apologetic way.
It seemed as if they were curiosities. They felt their eyes, their
noses, and their ears, and some of them even put their fingers
down their ears. It was evident they could not understand the
smallness of their features.</p>

<p>Then one of them addressed M. Mifroid, and while apologizing
for their curiosity, said he was astonished at their want of beauty.</p>

<p>By this time Lady Jane de Montfort and Demoiselle de Coucy were
dressed, and M. Mifroid and M. Théophraste were presented to them.</p>

<p>The two men begged a thousand pardons for their intrusion, and
were about to explain their intrusion, when Demoiselle de Coucy
took Théophraste by the arm, and Lady Jane took M. Mifroid, and
they were conducted through the vaults surrounded by the crowd
of men. It was difficult for them to prevent the men from poking
their eyes out as they fumbled over their faces.</p>

<p>They had been forty-eight hours without food, and their hunger
was extreme, and now they were to be taken away from where there
was food.</p>

<p>The two women had taken possession of their lamps under the pretext
of being troubled by the odor.</p>

<p>They tried to tell the people that they were exhausted, but so
many questions were put to them that no opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>They had by this time reached a large chamber. There was a dull
light, and they felt the presence of thousands of people. M. Mifroid
managed to get one of the lamps, and quickly pressing the button,
lit up the vast hall, in which were crowded thousands of these
weird men, all with the large noses and ears, but with no eyes.
Some of them walked on all fours, and some had such long noses
that they looked like pelicans.</p>

<p>Finally they were informed that they were at the entrance to
the meeting hall.</p>
