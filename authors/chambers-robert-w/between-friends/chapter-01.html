<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Like a man who reenters a closed and darkened house and lies
down; lying there, remains conscious of sunlight outside, of bird-calls,
and the breeze in the trees, so had Drene entered into the obscurity
of himself.</p>

<p>Through the chambers of his brain the twilit corridors where
cringed his bruised and disfigured soul, there nothing stirring
except the automatic pulses which never cease.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the sky itself crashes earthward and the world
lies in ruins from horizon to horizon, life goes on.</p>

<p>The things that men live through&mdash;and live!</p>

<p>But no doubt Death was too busy elsewhere to attend to Drene.</p>

<p>He had become very lean by the time it was all over. Gray glinted
on his temples; gray softened his sandy mustache: youth was finished
as far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>An odd idea persisted in his mind that it had been winter for
many years. And the world thawed out very slowly for him.</p>

<p>But broken trees leaf out, and hewed roots sprout; and what he
had so long mistaken for wintry ashes now gleamed warmly like
the orange and gold of early autumn. After a while he began to
go about more or less&mdash;little excursions from the dim privacy
of mind and soul&mdash;and he found the sun not very gray; and a south
wind blowing in the world once more.</p>

<p>Quair and Guilder were in the studio that day on business; Drene
continued to modify his composition in accordance with Guilder’s
suggestions; Quair, always curious concerning Drene, was becoming
slyly impudent.</p>

<p>"And listen to me, Guilder. What the devil’s a woman between
friends?"  argued Quair, with a malicious side glance at Drene.
"You take my best girl away from me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But I don’t," remarked his partner dryly.</p>

<p>"For the sake of argument, you do. What happens? Do I raise hell?
No. I merely thank you. Why? Because I don’t want her if you can
get her away. That," he added, with satisfaction, "is philosophy.
Isn’t it, Drene?"</p>

<p>Guilder intervened pleasantly:</p>

<p>"I don’t think Drene is particularly interested in philosophy.
I’m sure I’m not. Shut up, please."</p>

<p>Drene, gravely annoyed, continued to pinch bits of modeling wax
out of a round tin box, and to stick them all over the sketch
he was modifying.</p>

<p>Now and then he gave a twirl to the top of his working table,
which revolved with a rusty squeak.</p>

<p>"If you two unusually intelligent gentlemen ask me what good
a woman the world&mdash;" began Quair.</p>

<p>"But we don’t," interrupted Guilder, in the temperate voice peculiar
to his negative character.</p>

<p>"Anyway," insisted Quair, "here’s what I think of ‘em&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My model, yonder," said Drene, a slight shrug of contempt, "happens
to be feminine, and may also be human. Be decent enough to defer
the development of your rather tiresome theory."</p>

<p>The girl on the model-stand laughed outright at the rebuke, stretched
her limbs and body, and relaxed, launching a questioning glance
at Drene.</p>

<p>"All right; rest a bit," said the sculptor, smearing the bit
of wax he was pinching over the sketch before him.</p>

<p>He gave another twirl or two to the table, wiped his bony fingers
on a handful of cotton waste, picked up his empty pipe, and blew
into the stem, reflectively.</p>

<p>Quair, one of the associated architects of the new opera, who
had been born a gentleman and looked the perfect bounder, sauntered
over to examine the sketch. He was still red from the rebuke he
had invited.</p>

<p>Guilder, his senior colleague, got up from the lounge and walked
over also. Drene fitted the sketch into the roughly designed group,
where it belonged, and stood aside, sucking meditatively on his
empty pipe.</p>

<p>After a silence:</p>

<p>"It’s all right," said Guilder.</p>

<p>Quair remarked that the group seemed to lack flamboyancy. It
is true, however, that, except for Guilder’s habitual restraint,
the celebrated firm of architects was inclined to express themselves
flamboyantly, and to interpret Renaissance in terms of Baroque.</p>

<p>"She’s some girl," added Quair, looking at the lithe, modeled
figure, and then half turning to include the model, who had seated
herself on the lounge, and was now gazing with interest at the
composition sketched in by Drene for the facade of the new opera.</p>

<p>"Carpeaux and his eternal group&mdash;it’s the murderous but inevitable
standard of comparison," mused Drene, with a whimsical glance
at the photograph on the wall.</p>

<p>"Carpeaux has nothing on this young lady," insisted Quair flippantly;
and he pivoted on his heel and sat down beside the model. Once
or twice the two others, consulting before the wax group, heard
the girl’s light, untroubled laughter behind their backs gaily
responsive to Quair’s wit. Perhaps Quair’s inheritance had been
humor, but to some it seemed perilously akin to mother-wit.</p>

<p>The pockets of Guilder’s loose, ill-fitting clothes bulged with
linen tracings and rolls of blue-prints. He and Drene consulted
over these for a while, semi-conscious of Quair’s bantering voice
and the girl’s easily provoked laughter behind them. And, finally:</p>

<p>"All right, Guilder," said Drene briefly. And the firm of celebrated
architects prepared to evacuate the studio &mdash;Quair exhibiting
symptoms of incipient skylarking, in which he was said to be at
his best.</p>

<p>"Drop in on me at the office some time," he suggested to the
youthful model, in a gracious tone born of absolute self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>"For luncheon or dinner?" retorted the girl, with smiling audacity.</p>

<p>"You may stay to breakfast also&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, come on," drawled Guilder, taking his colleague’s elbow.</p>

<p>The sculptor yawned as Quair went out: then he closed the door
then celebrated firm of architects, and wandered back rather aimlessly.</p>

<p>For a while he stood by the great window, watching the pigeons
on neighboring roof. Presently he returned to his table, withdrew
the dancing figure with its graceful, wide flung arms, set it
upon the squeaky revolving table once more, and studied it, yawning
at intervals.</p>

<p>The girl got up from the sofa behind him, went to the model-stand,
and mounted it. For a few moments she was busy adjusting her feet
to the chalk marks and blocks. Finally she took the pose. She
always seemed inclined to be more or less vocal while Drene worked;
her voice, if untrained, was untroubled. Her singing had never
bothered Drene, nor, until the last few days, had he even particularly
noticed her blithe trilling&mdash;as a man a field, preoccupied, is
scarcely aware of the wild birds’ gay irrelevancy along the way.</p>

<p>He happened to notice it now, and a thought passed through his
mind that the country must be very lovely in the mild spring sunshine.</p>

<p>As he worked, the brief visualization of young grass and the
faint blue of skies, evoked, perhaps, by the girl’s careless singing,
made for his dull concentration subtly pleasant environment.</p>

<p>"May I rest?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>"Certainly, if it’s necessary."</p>

<p>"I’ve brought my lunch. It’s twelve," she explained.</p>

<p>He glanced at her absently, rolling a morsel of wax; then, with
slight irritation which ended in a shrug, he motioned her to descend.</p>

<p>After all, girls, like birds, were eternally eating. Except for
that, and incessant preening, existence meant nothing more important
to either species.</p>

<p>He had been busy for a few moments with the group when she said
something to him, and he looked around from his abstraction. She
was holding out toward him a chicken sandwich.</p>

<p>When his mind came back from wool gathering, he curtly declined
the offer, and, as an afterthought, bestowed upon her a wholly
mechanical smile, in recognition of a generosity not welcome.</p>

<p>"Why don’t you ever eat luncheon?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" he replied, preoccupied.</p>

<p>"It’s bad for you not to. Besides, you are growing thin."</p>

<p>"Is that your final conclusion concerning me, Cecile?" he asked,
absently.</p>

<p>"Won’t you please take this sandwich?"</p>

<p>Her outstretched arm more than what she said arrested his drifting
attention again.</p>

<p>"Why the devil do you want me to eat?" he inquired, fishing out
his empty pipe and filling it.</p>

<p>"You smoke too much. It’s bad for you. It will do very queer
things to the lining of your stomach if you smoke your luncheon
instead of eating it."</p>

<p>He yawned.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" he said.</p>

<p>"Certainly it’s so. Please take this sandwich."</p>

<p>He stood looking at the outstretched arm, thinking of other things
and the girl sprang to her feet, caught his hand, opened the fingers,
placed the sandwich on the palm, then, with a short laugh as though
slightly disconcerted by her own audacity, she snatched the pipe
from his left hand and tossed it upon the table. When she had
reseated herself on the lounge beside her pasteboard box of luncheon,
she became even more uncertain concerning the result of what she
had done, and began to view with rising alarm the steady gray
eyes that were so silently inspecting her.</p>

<p>But after a moment Drene walked over to the sofa, seated himself,
curiously scrutinized the sandwich which lay across the palm of
his hand, then gravely tasted it.</p>

<p>"This will doubtless give me indigestion," he remarked. "Why,
Cecile, do you squander your wages on nourishment for me?"</p>

<p>"It cost only five cents."</p>

<p>"But why present five cents to me?" "I gave ten to a beggar this
morning."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know."</p>

<p>"Was he grateful?"</p>

<p>"He seemed to be."</p>

<p>"This sandwich is excellent; but if I feel the worse for it,
I’ll not be very grateful to you." But he continued eating.</p>

<p>"‘The woman tempted me,’" she quoted, glancing at him sideways.</p>

<p>After a moment’s survey of her:</p>

<p>"You’re one of those bright, saucy, pretty, inexplicable things
that throng this town and occasionally flit through this profession&mdash;aren’t
you?"</p>

<p>"Am I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Nobody looks for anything except mediocrity; you’re one
of the surprises. Nobody expects you; nobody can account for you,
but you appear now and then, here and there, anywhere, even everywhere&mdash;a
pretty sparkle against the gray monotony of life, a momentary
flash like a golden moat afloat in sunshine&mdash;and what then?"</p>

<p>She laughed.</p>

<p>"What then? What becomes of you? Where do you go? What do you
turn into?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know."</p>

<p>"You go somewhere, don’t you? You change into something, don’t
you? What happens to you, petite Cigale?"</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"When the sunshine is turned off and the snow comes."</p>

<p>"I don’t know, Mr. Drene." She broke her chocolate cake into
halves and laid one on his knee.</p>

<p>"Thanks for further temptation," he said grimly.</p>

<p>"You are welcome. It’s good, isn’t it?"</p>

<p>"Excellent. Adam liked the apple, too. But it raised hell with
him."</p>

<p>She laughed, shot a direct glance at him, and began to nibble
her cake, with her eyes still fixed on him.</p>

<p>Once or twice he encountered her gaze but his own always wandered
absently elsewhere.</p>

<p>"You think a great deal, don’t you?" she remarked.</p>

<p>"Don’t you?"</p>

<p>"I try not to&mdash;too much."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, swallowing the last morsel of cake.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders:</p>

<p>"What’s the advantage of thinking?"</p>

<p>He considered her reply for a moment, her blue and rather childish
eyes, and the very pure oval of her face. Then his attention flagged
as usual&mdash;was wandering&mdash;when she sighed, very lightly, so that
he scarcely heard it&mdash;merely noticed it sufficiently to conclude
that, as usual, there was the inevitable hard luck story afloat
in her vicinity, and that he lacked the interest to listen to
it.</p>

<p>"Thinking," she said, "is a luxury to a tranquil mind and a punishment
to a troubled one. So I try not to."</p>

<p>It was a moment or two before it occurred to him that the girl
had uttered an unconscious epigram.</p>

<p>"It sounded like somebody&mdash;probably Montaigne. Was it?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I don’t know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Oh. Then it wasn’t. You’re a funny little girl, aren’t you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, rather."</p>

<p>"On purpose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sometimes."</p>

<p>He looked into her very clear eyes, now brightly blue with intelligent
perception of his not too civil badinage.</p>

<p>"And sometimes," he went on, "you’re funny when you don’t intend
to be."</p>

<p>"You are, too, Mr. Drene."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Didn’t you know it?"</p>

<p>A dull color tinted his cheek bones.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I didn’t know it."</p>

<p>"But you are. For instance, you don’t walk; you stalk. You do
what novelists make their gloomy heroes do&mdash;you stride. It’s rather
funny."</p>

<p>"Really. And do you find my movements comic?"</p>

<p>She was a trifle scared, now, but she laughed her breathless,
youthful laugh:</p>

<p>"You are really very dramatic&mdash;a perfect story-book man. But,
you know, sometimes they are funny when the author doesn’t intend
them to be.... Please don’t be angry."</p>

<p>Why the impudence of a model should have irritated him he was
at a loss to understand&mdash;unless there lurked under that impudence
a trace of unflattering truth.</p>

<p>As he sat looking at her, all at once, and in an unexpected flash
of self-illumination, he realized that habit had made of him an
actor; that for a while&mdash;a long while&mdash;a space of time he could
not at the moment conveniently compute&mdash;he had been playing a
role merely because he had become accustomed to it.</p>

<p>Disaster had cast him for a part. For a long while he had been
that part. Now he was still playing it from sheer force of habit.
His tragedy had really become only the shadow of a memory. Already
he had emerged from that shadow into the everyday outer world.
But he had forgotten that he still wore a somber makeup and costume
which in the sunshine might appear grotesque. No wonder the world
thought him funny.</p>

<p>Glancing up from a perplexed and chagrined meditation he caught
her eye&mdash;and found it penitent, troubled, and anxious.</p>

<p>"You’re quite right," he said, smiling easily and naturally;
"I am unintentionally funny. And I really didn’t know it&mdash;didn’t
suspect it&mdash;until this moment."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said quickly. "I didn’t mean &mdash;I know you are
often unhappy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"You are! Anybody can see&mdash;and you really do not seem to be very
old, either&mdash;when you smile&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I’m not very old," he said, amused. "I’m not unhappy, either.
If I ever was, the truth is that I’ve almost forgotten by this
time what it was all about&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A woman," she quoted, "between friends"&mdash;and checked herself,
frightened that she had dared interpret Quair’s malice.</p>

<p>He changed countenance at that; the dull red of anger clouded
his visage.</p>

<p>"Oh," she faltered, "I was not saucy, only sorry.... I have been
sorry for you so long&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who intimated to you that a woman ever played any part in my
career?"</p>

<p>"It’s generally supposed. I don’t know anything more than that.
But I’ve been&mdash;sorry. Love is a very dreadful thing," she said
under her breath.</p>

<p>"Is it?" he asked, controlling a sudden desire to laugh.</p>

<p>"Don’t you think so?"</p>

<p>"I have not thought of it that way, recently.... I haven’t thought
about it at all&mdash;for some years.... Have you?" he added, trying
to speak gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I have thought of it," she admitted.</p>

<p>"And you conclude it to be a rather dreadful business?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don’t know. A girl usually loves the wrong man. To be
poor is always bad enough, but to be in love, too, is really very
dreadful. It usually finishes us&mdash;you know."</p>

<p>"Are you in love?" he inquired, managing to repress his amusement.</p>

<p>"I could be. I know that much." She went to the sink, turned
on the water, washed her hands, and stood with dripping fingers
looking about for a towel.</p>

<p>"I’ll get you one," he said. When he brought it, she laughed
and held out her hands to be dried.</p>

<p>"Do you think you are a Sultana?" he inquired, draping the towel
across her outstretched arms and leaving it there.</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you’d dry them," she said sweetly.</p>

<p>"Not in the business," he remarked; and lighted his pipe.</p>

<p>Her hands were her particular beauty, soft and snowy. She was
much in demand among painters, and had posed many times for pictures
of the Virgin, her hands usually resting against her breast.</p>

<p>Now she bestowed great care upon them, thoroughly drying each
separate, slender finger. Then she pushed back the heavy masses
of her hair&mdash;"a miracle of silk and sunshine," as Quair had whispered
to her. That same hair, also, was very popular among painters.</p>

<p>It was her figure that fascinated sculptors.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" grunted Drene. Work presently recommenced.</p>

<p>She was entirely accustomed to praise from men, for her general
attractiveness, for various separate features in what really was
an unusually lovely ensemble.</p>

<p>She was also accustomed to flattery, to importunity, to the ordinary
variety of masculine solicitation; to the revelation of genuine
feeling, too, in its various modes of expression&mdash;sentimental,
explosive, insinuating&mdash;the entire gamut.</p>

<p>She had remained, however, untouched; curious and amused, perhaps,
yet quite satisfied, so far, to be amused; and entirely content
with her own curiosity.</p>

<p>She coquetted when she thought it safe; learned many things she
had not suspected; was more cautious afterwards, but still, at
intervals, ventured to use her attractiveness as a natural lure,
as an excuse, as a reason, as a weapon, when the probable consequences
threatened no embarrassment or unpleasantness for her.</p>

<p>She was much liked, much admired, much attempted, and entirely
untempted.</p>

<p>When the Make-up Club gave its annual play depicting the foibles
of artists and writers in the public eye, Cecile White was always
cast for a role which included singing and dancing.</p>

<p>On and off for the last year or two she had posed for Drene,
had dropped into his studio to lounge about when he had no need
of her professionally, and when she had half an hour of idleness
confronting her.</p>

<p>As she stood there now on the model stand, gazing dreamily from
his busy hands to his lean, intent features, it occurred to her
that this day had not been a sample of their usual humdrum relations.
From the very beginning of their business relations he had remained
merely her employer, self-centered, darkly absorbed in his work,
or, when not working, bored and often yawning. She had never come
to know him any better than when she first laid eyes on him.</p>

<p>Always she had been a little interested in him, a little afraid,
sometimes venturing an innocent audacity, out of sheer curiosity
concerning the effect on him. But never had she succeeded in stirring
him to any expression of personal feeling in regard to herself,
one way or the other.</p>

<p>Probably he had no personal feeling concerning her. It seemed
odd to her; model and master thrown alone together, day after
day, usually became friends in some degree. But there had been
nothing at all of camaraderie in their relationship, only a colorless,
professional sans-gene, the informality of intimacy without the
kindly essence of personal interest on his part.</p>

<p>He paid her wages promptly; said good morning when she came,
and good night when she went; answered her questions when she
asked them seriously; relapsed into indifference or into a lazy
and not too civil badinage when she provoked him to it; and that
was all.</p>

<p>He never complimented her, never praised her; yet he must have
thought her a good model, or he would not have continued to send
for her.</p>

<p>"Do you think me pretty?" she had asked one day, saucily invading
one of his yawning silences.</p>

<p>"I think you’re pretty good," he replied, "as a model. You’d
be quite perfect if you were also deaf and dumb."</p>

<p>That had been nearly a year ago. She thought of it now, a slight
heat in her cheeks as she remembered the snub, and her almost
childish amazement, and the hurt and offended silence which lasted
all that morning, but which, if he noticed at all, was doubtless
entirely gratifying to him.</p>

<p>"May I rest?"</p>

<p>"If it’s necessary."</p>

<p>She sprang lightly to the floor walked around behind him, and
stood looking at his work.</p>

<p>"Do you want to know my opinion?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with unexpected urbanity; "if you are clever
enough to have an opinion. What is it?"</p>

<p>She said, looking at the wax figure of herself and speaking with
deliberation:</p>

<p>"In the last hour you have made out of a rather commonplace study
an entirely spontaneous and charming creation."</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed, his face reddening with pleasure at her
opinion, and with surprise at her mode of expressing it.</p>

<p>"It’s quite true. That dancing figure is wholly charming. It
is no study; it is pure creation."</p>

<p>He knew it; was a little thrilled that she, representing to him
an average and mediocre public, should recognize it so intelligently.</p>

<p>"As though," she continued, "you had laid aside childish things."</p>

<p>"What?" he asked, surprised again at the authority of the expression.</p>

<p>"Academic precision and the respectable excellencies of-the-usual;&mdash;you
have put away childish things and become a man."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that?" he said bluntly.</p>

<p>"I heard it when I said it. You know, Mr. Drene, I am not wholly
uneducated, although your amiable question insinuates as much."</p>

<p>"I’m not unamiable. Only I didn’t suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you never have supposed anything concerning me. So why are
you surprised when I express myself with fragmentary intelligence?"</p>

<p>"I’m sorry&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Listen to me. I’m not afraid of you any more. I’ve been afraid
for two years. Now, I’m not. Your study is masterly. I know it.
You know it. You didn’t know I knew it; you didn’t know I knew
anything. And you didn’t care."</p>

<p>She sat down on the sofa, facing him with a breathless smile.</p>

<p>"You don’t care what I think, what I am, what interests I may
have, what intellect, what of human desire, hope, fear, ambition
animates me; do you? You don’t care whether I am ignorant or educated,
bad or good, ill or well&mdash;as long as it does not affect my posing
for you; whether I am happy or unhappy, whether I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For Heaven’s sake&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you don’t care!... Do you?"</p>

<p>He was silent; he stood looking at her in a stupid sort of way.</p>

<p>After a moment or two she rose, picked up her hat, went to the
glass and pinned it on, then strolled slowly back, drawing on
her gloves.</p>

<p>"It’s five o’clock, you know, Drene."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly."</p>

<p>"Do you want me to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"You are not offended?"</p>

<p>He did not answer. She came up to him and repeated the question
in a childishly anxious voice that was a trifle too humble. And
looking down into her eyes he saw a gleam of pure mischief in
them.</p>

<p>"You little villain!" he said; and caught her wrists. "A lot
you care whether I am offended!"</p>

<p>She looked away from him, turning her profile. Her expression
was inscrutable. After a silence he dropped her wrists with a
vague laugh.</p>

<p>"You should have let me alone," he said.</p>

<p>"‘The woman tempted me,’" she repeated, still looking away from
him. He said nothing.</p>

<p>"Good night," she nodded, and turned toward the door.</p>

<p>He went with her, falling into step beside her. One arm slipped
around her waist as they entered the hallway. They walked slowly
to the door. He unlatched it, hesitated; she moved one foot forward,
and he took a step at the same time which brought her across his
path so closely that contact was unavoidable. And he kissed her.</p>

<p>"Oh," she said. "So you are human after all! I often wondered."</p>

<p>She looked up, trying to laugh, but could not seem to take it
as coolly as she might have wished to.</p>

<p>"Not that a kiss is very important in these days," she continued,
"yet it might interest you to hear that a friend of yours rather
fancies me. He wouldn’t like you to do it. But&mdash;" She lifted her
blue eyes with faint malice&mdash;"What is a woman between friends?"</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Jack Graylock."</p>

<p>Drene remained motionless.</p>

<p>"I haven’t encouraged him," she said. "Perhaps that is why."</p>

<p>"Why he fancies you?"</p>

<p>"Why he asked me to marry him. It was the only thing he had not
asked."</p>

<p>"He asked that?"</p>

<p>"After he realized it was the only way, I suppose," she said
coolly. Drene took her into his arms and kissed her deliberately
on the mouth. Looking up at him she said: "After all, he is your
friend, isn’t he?"</p>

<p>"A friend of many years. But, as you say, what is a woman between
friends?"</p>

<p>"I don’t know," said the girl. And, still clasped in his arms,
she bent her head, thoughtfully, considering the question.</p>

<p>And as though she had come to some final conclusion, she raised
her head, lifted her eyes slowly, and her lips, to the man whose
arms enfolded her. It was her answer to his question, and her
own.</p>

<p>When she had gone, he went back and stood again by the great
window, watching the cote on a neighboring roof, where the pigeons
were strutting and coquetting in the last rays of the western
sun.</p>
