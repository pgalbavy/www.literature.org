<p><em>THE </em>summer was well advanced when Mul-tal-la, Deerfoot
and the Shelton boys drew rein in the Rocky Mountains, south of
the stream known as Medicine River, and far to the northward of
the headwaters of the Yellowstone.</p>

<p>They had had a hard time in reaching this point on their long
journey. Numerous streams had been crossed, deep and dangerous
defiles threaded, treacherous paths followed, and several accidents
encountered. Once in following a narrow, winding path leading
around a vast mountain wall, Zigzag lost his footing and rolled
over several times in his descent to the bottom, fully fifty feet
below. Deerfoot and Mul-tal-la hurriedly scrambled after him in
order to recover the goods and to put the animal out of his misery.
When they reached Zigzag they found him standing on his feet,
with his pack somewhat askew, but seemingly suffering from only
a few trifling bruises. He was extricated with much labor from
his position, and resumed his plodding task. One fact was evident;
he knew more than he did before, and nothing in the nature of
a similar mishap occurred again.</p>

<p>The mosquitoes still pestered our friends at times, but not to
the degree that they suffered on the shore of the Great Horn.
Once or twice they were pinched with hunger, but to no serious
extent. They were now comparatively close to the Blackfoot country,
and, if all went well, ought to reach it within a week. In fact,
as Mul-tal-la declared, they were liable to meet some of the hunting
parties of his people at any time.</p>

<p>On the night succeeding this statement two mounted Blackfeet,
from the principal village, rode into camp and greeted the travelers.
The couple were old acquaintances of Mul-tal-la, and, as may be
supposed, the meeting was pleasant indeed. Deerfoot’s friend had
an absorbing story to tell of his experiences during the year
that he had been as far removed from his own people as if out
of the world. They listened like a couple of children enthralled
by a marvelous fairy tale, and would have sat in delighted attention
the night through had their old comrade been willing to keep up
the thread of his narrative, whose charm could never pall for
them.</p>

<p>They were astonished to find the young Shawanoe able to speak
their own tongue like one of themselves, and when Mul-tal-la dwelt
upon the prowess, wisdom, chivalry and daring of the youth, they
stared at him as if he belonged to another order of beings. Mul-tal-la
would have told much more of his friend had not the youth checked
him with a sternness that the Blackfoot dared not disregard.</p>

<p>The visitors were very friendly and George and Victor Shelton
were much pleased with them. They got on quite well through the
language of signs, and the warriors were again amazed when they
heard their countryman speak to the lads in their own language.
It must have been a marvelous country and people that sent the
youths forth, and which had been visited by Mul-tal-la. It was
plain that the couple, when they sighed and looked into each other’s
face, longed for the same experience that had befallen their countryman.</p>

<p>But with all this Mul-tal-la had also a sad story to tell. He
had left home with a companion, but returned without him. It was
a strange accident that overtook that comrade after he had surmounted
so many perils, but his body rested many hundreds of miles away
in a wondrous country, and his friends must wait to see him until
he and they met in the happy hunting grounds that are the final
home of all true and brave red men.</p>

<p>This visit caused an important change in the plans of Deerfoot
and Mul-tal-la. As you know, the party had been steadily following
a general northwest course, with the Blackfoot country as their
chief destination. The intention was to remain there for a few
days or weeks, and then press westward to the Pacific. When in
the Blackfoot region a fourth of their journey would still be
before them, and it led through a section the most difficult of
all to travel. The understanding was that Mul-tal-la would accompany
Deerfoot and the boys until all were given to look upon the mightiest
body of water on the globe. By the time they reached the Blackfoot
country again winter would be so near (if not already upon them)
that our friends purposed to remain among that tribe until the
opening of spring, when they would set out on the return to their
own home.</p>

<p>But Mul-tal-la, after a long conversation with his countrymen,
told Deerfoot that when he joined his people he would not be allowed
to leave them again. An unprecedented favor had been granted him
and his companion. The one who had received such an indulgence
could not receive it a second time. Moreover, the death of the
comrade increased the difficulty, if that were possible, for the
head chief of the Blackfeet, who was an autocrat among his tribe,
would be offended with Mul-tal-la when he learned all that had
taken place. Many Indian tribes follow the custom of the Chinese
and punish an unfortunate leader, no matter how blameless he may
have been for his misfortune.</p>

<p>Had Mul-tal-la returned with his former companion it is not unlikely
that the chieftain would have permitted him to accompany Deerfoot
and the boys to the Pacific, but, coming back without the other,
such permission was impossible.</p>

<p>Long after the brothers had stretched out by the fire the Shawanoe
and the Blackfeet talked together. Convinced that the life of
Mul-tal-la was in danger from the chieftain, Deerfoot was determined
that his friend should not run the risk that awaited him if he
went back with the couple or followed them after a brief interval.</p>

<p>He proposed, therefore, that the party with Mul-tal-la should
turn off from the route they were following, force their way through
the Rocky Mountains to the headwaters of the Columbia, and pass
down that to the Pacific, after which the four would visit the
Blackfeet and stay with them till spring.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two Blackfeet would return to their countrymen
and report what they had seen and learned. An outburst against
Mul-tal-la was certain, but it would be given time in which to
spend its force. The visitors would do all they could to placate
and show their chieftain that Mul-tal-la would have been glad
to hasten home had he not been under pledge to guide the Shawanoe
and his friends to the Pacific. The Shawanoe would give his life
at any time rather than break his promise, and he had taught the
same high principles to Mul-tal-la.</p>

<p>Deerfoot was unwilling to admit that any credit in the matter
was due to his teachings, but he was forced to hold his peace
when his friend unhesitatingly told him that among his people
the violation of a pledge was not regarded as wrong when the interests
of the one making the pledge called for such a course. "And,"
added the grinning Mul-tal-la, "I am a Blackfoot."</p>

<p>Deerfoot with all his sagacity failed to note one phase of the
situation that was apparent to Mul-tal-la. The latter, despite
the protest of the Shawanoe, managed secretly to tell his countrymen
a good deal about the remarkable youth who had proved so unselfish
a friend to him when such a friend was needed. He gave the story
of his conquest of the wild stallion, of Deerfoot’s incredible
fleetness of foot, of his skill with the bow and rifle, of his
courage and readiness of resource, which surpassed that of any
of his race, and of his admirable character, which Mul-tal-la
had never seen equaled by any white or red man.</p>

<p>There was one subject upon which the four red men talked freely,
for it was always a welcome one to Deerfoot the Shawanoe. Unto
the visitors had come vague, shadowy rumors of a religion different
from that which they had been taught, and which had been followed
by their people from time immemorial. In some cases these reports
were definite enough to awaken curiosity and inquiry. Stories
were told of self-sacrificing missionaries who had spent years
in teaching the new faith, and who had given their lives for its
sake. It was a strange doctrine, indeed, which taught the sin
of revenge, of deceit, of cruelty, of wrong-doing, and replaced
them with love, forgiveness, mercy and the Golden Rule, and the
assurance that a reward of eternal life awaited those who lived
according to the will of the one and true God.</p>

<p>Immortality is not capable of scientific proof, but one of the
strongest evidences of its truth is that yearning which is implanted,
to a greater or less degree, in every human heart, and in every
race, no matter how low or degraded its order in the rank of civilization.
All religions, whether true or false, are based on the idea of
a life beyond the grave. It accords with reason and with the self-evident
fact that no man can feel that his life’s work is rounded out
and completed on earth, and that consequently there must be another
existence in which that work shall be carried on.</p>

<p>That these longings, these yearnings, this instinctive reaching
out for the things beyond mortal grasp, are an inherent part of
our being show that they have been divinely planted there by One
who is capable of satisfying them all, and who, in his own good
time, will satisfy them. So reasonable and so well founded is
this belief that the burden of proof is thrown upon those who
dispute it. Let them demonstrate, if they can, that that which
we call death ends all. But it is beyond their power, and from
the nature of things always will be beyond their power, to do
this impossible thing.</p>

<p>At the opening of this century we stand on the threshold of the
most marvelous discoveries and achievements made since the world
began. Some of these discoveries fill us with awe, and clearly
presage the greater that are close at hand. Among them may be
the scientific proof of a future existence, though such proof
is not necessary with the most exalted intellects, any more than
it is with the simpler and more child-like minds.</p>

<p>We must not wander, however, from the thread of our narrative,
though the subject is the most momentous that can engage our mental
powers. When Mul-tal-la put into more definite form the dim glimpses
that his countrymen had caught of the true light, he appealed
to Deerfoot, who in his modest, convincing manner told the story
of his conversion and of the sweet communion he held every day
with the Father of All Good. It was a faith which no trial, no
suffering, no torture could change or modify, and he impressed
upon his absorbed listeners the ineffable beauties of the religion
which made a man a new being and fitted him for the life to come.</p>

<p>Deerfoot had that rare tact of not pressing an important question
too far. He knew he had said enough, and when his hearers ceased
to question him he ceased to exhort. He, like all true Christians
before and since, had to meet that most troublesome of questions:
the evil-doing of those who profess the white man’s religion.
The Blackfeet had met Caucasians who prayed and bellowed their
faith, yet whose lives belied every word of their profession.
They wronged and cheated the Indians; they broke their promises;
they maltreated them, and in short did everything that was evil.
If the Christian religion made such men, the pagans might well
declare they wanted none of it, for they were unquestionably better
than those hypocrites.</p>

<p>Deerfoot ranked such men far below those who were called heathens.
He despised them utterly, and was sure their punishment would
be greater than that meted out to those who live in open sin.
He strove to impress upon his listeners—and it is fair to believe
he succeeded—the distinction between true and false Christians,
and assured the Blackfeet that they were justified at all times
in rating a person, not by what he professed, but by his daily
life, for it is thus that at the last day the great Arbiter will
judge us all.</p>

<p>And so, without fully realizing it, the young Shawanoe sowed
the good seed as the soil presented itself. It was he who had
brought George and Victor Shelton to see the truth; under whom
Mul-tal-la had become a believer; hundreds of miles away he had
planted the germ in the ground offered by the trapper Jack Halloway,
of whom he was to hear further; and now he had given the first
glimmerings of light to these benighted Blackfeet, and it was
a light that was not to be extinguished, but would grow and become
luminous to a degree that only the Judgment Day would make clear.</p>

<p>Thus it is with all of us. We have only to use the opportunities
as they present themselves; to do the kind deed; to utter the
encouraging word; to help the fallen; to relieve the suffering;
to purify our own actions, words and thoughts, and, all in good
time, the harvest shall appear.</p>
