<p>Not a moment was to be lost. Everything depended upon boarding
the flatboat and pushing off at once from shore. The party was
so large that the craft was sure to be crowded, but its buoyancy
was sufficient to carry still more.</p>

<p>To most of the party hurrying on board, the silence and inactivity
of the Shawanoes were incomprehensible. That they had been partially
dazed was fair to believe, but it could not continue long. The
presence of the boat, with its sail still spread, against the
bank, must tell the story to the fierce red men, who ought to
be as quick to recover from it as were the pioneers.</p>

<p>It mattered not that the wind had failed. The one point was to
get the flatboat away from land, and out into the stream. That
done, a long step would be taken toward safety. The ambuscade
would be flanked and avoided.</p>

<p>"You can't hurry too much," said the missionary, beginning to
show nervousness now that the critical moment was at hand. He
helped the women on board, and did what he could to prevent the
confusion caused at this juncture by the crowding. He expected
that a volley would come every moment from the gloom along the
shore, and therefore held his station where his body would be
most likely to shield the helpless ones.</p>

<p>Amid the confusion there was something approaching order, and
it can be said that no time was thrown away. Within a minute of
reaching the flatboat it seemed that every one of the pioneers
was on board.</p>

<p>"Lay down," whispered Boone, addressing the settlers especially;
"the varmints are sartin to fire afore you can get out on the
river&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dar goes dat canue," called Jethro Juggens, who managed to be
the first on board.</p>

<p>The little boat had been swung around and fastened to the farther
side of the more bulky craft, so as to allow the latter to approach
nearer the land. The youth was doing what he could to aid his
friends (really doing nothing), when he observed the canoe several
feet away with the intervening space steadily increasing.</p>

<p>"Jump over after it," commanded Kenton, who himself would have
done what he ordered but for the need of his presence on the flatboat.</p>

<p>"Drop dat boat!" shouted Jethro, addressing (with a view of impressing
those around him) an imaginary foe. At the same moment, leaving
his gun behind him, he leaped overboard and swam powerfully toward
the little craft. The clothing of the youth had not yet dried
from the wetting received by his bath earlier in the evening,
and at this sultry season of the year a plunge in the river was
pleasant than otherwise.</p>

<p>Jethro ought to have noticed that while the canoe was drifting
with the current it was also approaching the middle of the Ohio.
That could hardly take place without the interference of some
one.</p>

<p>But the powerful youth noted not the significant fact, and swam
with lusty stroke straight for the little boat that had changed
hands so frequently during the last few hours, and been the cause
of more than one furious wrangle. Only a second or two was necessary
to reach it, and he laid his hand on the gunwale.</p>

<p>At that instant a Shawanoe warrior rose from the interior of
the canoe, and lifted his hand in which was clasped a knife, with
the purpose of burying it with vicious energy in the breast of
the astonished youth.</p>

<p>"Whew! gorrynation! I didn't know yo' war dar!" gasped Jethro,
dropping like a loon beneath the surface just in time to escape
the ferocious thrust.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe leaned so far out, with upraised weapon, to strike
the African when he came up, that the canoe careened almost upon
its side. He was in this attitude of expectancy when, from the
flatboat, came the sharp crack of a rifle, and the savage plunged
over, head first, with a smothered shriek, and sank from sight.</p>

<p>"I expected something of the kind," muttered Simon Kenton, who,
amid the tumult around him, proceeded to reload his rifle with
as much coolness as if he were in the depth of the forest and
had just brought down a deer or bear.</p>

<p>From the undergrowth immediately above where the boat was pushing
from land, a second warrior, whose zeal outran his discretion,
emitted a ringing whoop, and dashed straight at the crowding fugitives.
He was nearer Mrs. Altman than any of the others, and meant to
bury his uplifted tomahawk in her brain, but when almost within
reach he made a frenzied leap from the ground, and, with outspread
arms and legs, tumbled forward on his face.</p>

<p>It was never clearly established who was quick enough to check
the murderous miscreant in this fashion, for fighting had fairly
begun and considerable shooting was going on; but the moon at
that moment was unobscured, and Mr. Altman insisted that he saw
Missionary Finley raise his rifle like a flash and discharge it
in the direction of the warrior just at the instant before the
husband could intervene in defence of his wife.</p>

<p>When the good man was afterward taxed with the exploit, so creditable
to his coolness and courage, he showed a reluctance to discuss
it. Pressed further, he would not admit the charge, and yet refrained
from denial. It will be conceded, therefore, that the presumption
is reasonable that Missionary Finley was the instrument of saving
Mrs. Altman's life when it was in the gravest possible peril.
Meanwhile Jethro Juggens found himself with interesting surroundings.
Availing himself of his great skill in the water, he dived so
deeply that his feet touched bottom and he came up a dozen rods
away from the canoe and between it and the Ohio shore. The passing
of the Shawanoe took place while the youth was beneath the surface,
so that he was unaware of the true situation when he arose and
stared at the boat.</p>

<p>"Gorrynation, if de t'ing ain't upsot!" was his exclamation when
he had approached somewhat nearer and saw the boat turned bottom
upward.</p>

<p>The spasmodic lunge of the Shawanoe had overturned the craft,
which resembled a huge tortoise, drifting with the current.</p>

<p>"He's walking on de bottom ob de ribber, wid dat boat ober his
head, to keep from gettin' moonstruck. Dat can't be neither,"
added Jethro, "onless he am seventeen foot tall, and I don't tink
he am dat high."</p>

<p>The gently moving arms of the swimmer came in contact with something.
Closing his hands about it, he found it to be the oar flung out
of the canoe by the overturning.</p>

<p>"Dat'll come handy," thought Jethro. "When he sticks out his
head to get a bref ob air, I'll whack him wid de paddle till he
s'renders."</p>

<p>After manoeuvring about the canoe for some minutes, a suspicion
of the truth dawned upon the youth. Even when under the water
he was able to hear the deadened reports of the rifles above,
and he believed that one of the shots must have reached the occupant
of the boat, whose frenzied leap capsized it.</p>

<p>Gathering courage after a few minutes, he grasped the canoe and
managed to swing it back into proper position, but it contained
so much water as to forbid its use until it was emptied. This
could be done only by taking it ashore. Jethro therefore tossed
the paddle inside, and grasping the gunwale with one hand, swam
with the other toward Ohio. It may be added that he reached it
without further event, and there for a time we will leave him
to himself.</p>

<p>"Lie down!" thundered the missionary, seeing that his first order
was only partially obeyed. "My good woman, I beg your pardon,
but it must be done."</p>

<p>His words were addressed to Mrs. Ashbridge, who, in her anxiety
for her husband and son, was exposing herself in the most reckless
manner. As he spoke, he seized her in his arms as though she were
but an infant, and placed her not too gently flat in the bottom
of the boat.</p>

<p>"There! spend these minutes in prayer&mdash;no; that will never do,"
he added, grasping the shoulder of Agnes Altman, who, at that
moment, attempted to rise; "keep down&mdash;all that is between you
and death is that plank."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but," pleaded the distressed girl, "tell father and George
to be careful, won't you, please?"</p>

<p>"We are in the hands of God, my child, and have only to do our
duty. Help us by causing no anxiety about yourselves."</p>

<p>The great necessity, as has been explained, was to work the flatboat
away from land. The most direct means of doing this was by pushing
with the poles that had been taken on board for that use; but
they were fastened in place as supports for the sail that had
brought the craft to this place. The sweeps would accomplish this
work, but only slowly and by frightful exposure on the part of
those swaying them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Jim Deane seized the bow sweep at the moment another
ranger grasped the rear one, and both wrought with right good
will.</p>

<p>Dark forms appeared in greater number along shore and near the
craft itself. The gloom was lit up by flashes of guns, and the
air was rent by the shouts of the combatants, for the white men
could make as much noise as their enemies in the swirl and frenzy
of personal encounter and deadly conflict.</p>

<p>Boone, Kenton, the missionary and most of the men had leaped
into the flatboat and crouched low, where all seemed huddled together
in inextricable confusion. The two were toiling at the sweeps,
and the craft worked away from the shore with maddening tardiness.
To some of the terrified inmates it did not seem to move at all.</p>

<p>"A little harder, Jim," called the missionary "shall I lend a
hand?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Deane; "I'll fetch it, I don't need you&mdash;yes I
do, too."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he let go of the sweep and sagged heavily downward.</p>

<p>"Are you hit?" asked the good man, raising the head upon his
knee.</p>

<p>"I got my last sickness that time, parson&mdash;it's all up&mdash;good-by!"</p>

<p>The missionary would have said more, would have prayed with the
fellow, despite the terrifying peril around him, had there been
time to do so, but Jim Deane was dead.</p>

<p>"God rest his soul!" murmured the good man, gently laying down
the head, and drawing the body as closely as he could to the gunwale,
where it would be out of the way.</p>

<p>As from the first, the missionary exposed himself with the utmost
recklessness, and, where the bullets were hurtling all about him,
the wonder was that he had not already been struck; but the life
of Rev. J. B. Finley was one of sacrifice, peril, suffering and
hardship, in which his last thought was for himself. He was ready
for the call of the dark angel, whether he came at midnight, morning,
or high noon, and the angel did not come until after the lapse
of many years, when the scenes such as we are describing had long
passed away.</p>

<p>A strange and for a time wholly unaccountable occurrence took
place near the stem of the flatboat, only a moment before Jim
Deane was mortally smitten.</p>

<p>Simon Kenton had just withdrawn his attention from Jethro Juggens
and his canoe, and was looking toward the bank at his elbow, when
he uttered an exclamation, the meaning of which no one caught,
or, if he did, failed to notice it in the tumult and hullabaloo.
At the same moment the ranger gathered his muscles into one mighty
effort, and made a leap toward shore.</p>

<p>Superb as was his skill in this direction, the distance was too
great to be covered, and he stuck in the water, but so near land
that he sank only to his waist. He struggled furiously forward,
seemingly in the very midst of the Shawanoes, and was immediately
lost to sight.</p>

<p>There was no time to inquire the meaning of this extraordinary
action, and no one suspected it, but it became apparent within
a brief space of time.</p>

<p>It was at this juncture that several noticed the wind had risen
again. It was blowing not so strongly as before, but with sufficient
power to start the flatboat slowly up stream. Boone called to
all to keep down, while he, crouching close to the stern, held
the oar so that it helped steer the craft into mid-stream.</p>

<p>The missionary did the same with the forward sweep, and, impelled
by the wind, the craft slowly forged away from the Kentucky and
toward the Ohio shore.</p>

<p>All hearts were beating high with hope and thankfulness when
a piercing cry came from Mrs. Ashbridge.</p>

<p>"Where is Mabel? What has become of Mabel? Oh, where is she?"</p>

<p>Dismay reigned during the minute or two of frenzied search of
the interior of the craft. The space was so small that the hunt
was quickly over, with the dreadful truth established that little
ten-year old Mabel Ashbridge was not on the flatboat.</p>

<p>Missionary Finley announced the fact when he said:</p>

<p>"She has fallen into the hands of the Shawanoes; that was the
cause of Simon Kenton leaping ashore."</p>
