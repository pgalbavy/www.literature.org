<p>The <u>Nettie B.</u> was surging north, nearing Cape Breton. Nat Burns sat
moodily on the top of the house and watched the schooner take 'em
green over her bows.
</p><p>Within the last day a fog with a wind behind it had drifted across the
lead-colored ocean; and now, although the fog was gone, the wind was
still howling and bringing with it a rising sea.
</p><p>The equinoxes were not far off, and all skippers had a weather eye
out, and paid especial attention to the stoutness of lashings and
patched canvas.
</p><p>Never had Burns been in a blacker mood, and never had he better
cause.
</p><p>He was three days from St. Andrew's, and there he had become
acquainted with several facts.
</p><p>The first was that no Canadian gunboat by the name of <u>Albatross</u> had
called at said port and left any prisoner by the name of Code
Schofield--in fact, such gunboat had not called at all.
</p><p>Investigation at the admiralty office proved to Nat that the real
<u>Albatross</u> had reported from St. John's, Newfoundland, on the very
day he supposed he had met her. As the waters near St. Andrew's and
St. John's are several hundreds of miles apart, Nat was not long in
forming the opinion that he had been duped.
</p><p>Fuming with rage, he began to investigate. Gradually he learned the
story (from sailors in wine-shops and general hearsay) of the
mysterious schooner that had twice saved Code Schofield from actual
capture, and had aided him on one or two other occasions.
</p><p>One man said he had heard of a retired naval officer named Foraker,
who was supposed to be in command. As a matter of fact, there was a
Captain Foraker aboard the schooner who navigated her and instilled
the "run and jump" discipline that had so excited Code's admiration.
Outside of this vague fact, Nat's knowledge was scant.
</p><p>He was ignorant of who owned the swift vessel. He would never have
connected Elsa Mallaby with her in ten years of hard thinking. All he
did know was that some unknown agency was suddenly at work in behalf
of the man he hated.
</p><p>He notified the admiralty that a strange schooner had impersonated the
gunboat of H. I. M. George V, and gave a very accurate description of
her.
</p><p>As this was a new offense for the vessel that had already interfered
with justice twice, the skippers of all the revenue cutters along the
coast bent their energies to capturing or sinking this semipiratical
craft, upon the receipt of radiograms to that effect.
</p><p>Not only had Nat set the machinery of the law in motion against the
mystery schooner, but he had provided against any future dabbling with
his constabulary powers by the simple expedient of having with him an
officer of the law who was empowered to bring the accused murderer of
Michael Burns before the bar of justice without transfer.
</p><p>When the supposed gunboat had removed the prisoner from his deck and
borne away (for a while) on the course to St. Andrew's, Nat, relieved
of responsibility, ran over to Grande Mignon and into the harbor of
Freekirk Head.
</p><p>His purpose in this was twofold, and treacherous in both cases. First
he lost no time in spreading the details of how Code Schofield had
been captured in a drunken brawl at St. Pierre and was fighting the
jailers in St. Andrew's. Secondly, he had a long private interview
with Bill Boughton, in which he tried to get the storekeeper to sign a
contract for his (Burns's) fish at a certain price.
</p><p>While the former was meanness of a hideous kind, this latter move was
one of treachery against the men of Freekirk Head. The worst part of
it was that Nat had about a hundred quintals of splendid-looking cod
(every pound he had caught) in his hold, and these he handed over to
Boughton as a sample of what was to come from him very shortly.
</p><p>Boughton was hard up for fish, for none had come from the Banks, and
bought them at a big price. But as to the signing of the contract, he
demurred. When Nat could not explain why he had caught so few fish in
such a long time, the storekeeper became wary and refused to commit
himself. Finally he agreed to the price if Nat would deliver a
thousand quintals before any of the rest of the fleet arrived home.
</p><p>Consequently it was up mainsail and sway 'em flat and a fast run north
for the <u>Nettie B.</u>
</p><p>During his day's stay in Freekirk Head he had received a great bag of
mail for the men of the fleet from their women-folk at home, and this
he had in his cabin, now all distributed and tied into bundles, one
for each schooner, so that they could be easily sorted and thrown
aboard as he met them.
</p><p>Burns caught the fleet of a Thursday morning, just as they had dropped
anchors after making a night berth, and the dories were out sampling
the ground and the fish. It was just three days after Code had arrived
aboard the <u>Charming Lass</u> again.
</p><p>As Nat worked his way in and out among the vessels, throwing their
mail aboard attached to pieces of coal, he kept an eye out for the
<u>Rosan</u>. One very important piece of business that had brought him
North was a reconciliation with Nellie Tanner, and he meant, while his
men were out in the dories, to accomplish this first.
</p><p>At last he sighted her near the very front line of the fleet. The
<u>Charming Lass</u> he could not see, for Code had taken a different
direction from the <u>Rosan</u>, and was one of the score of sails
scattered around the horizon. But Nat was in no great hurry to get him
on the minute; if the mystery schooner were attended to, then it would
be merely a matter of time until the capture of Code.
</p><p>He ranged up astern of the <u>Rosan</u> with a cheery yell and let go his
anchor, ordering the dories over the side in the same breath. But his
aspirations received a chilling setback from none other than Bijonah
Tanner himself. The old man had been sleepless for a week, trying to
nose out the <u>Lass</u> for the top haul of the fleet, and here was a
young scapegrace who came and cast anchor within a hundred yards of
his chosen ground.
</p><p>Nat laughed carelessly at the storm of abuse that rattled over the
stern of the <u>Rosan</u> and rowed over to her in his dory with the
package of mail.
</p><p>"Forget it, papa," he said, easily insolent, as he climbed over the
rail in the teeth of a broadside. "We're not goin' to foul your rodin'
or steal your fish. I've just come to make a call and tell you the
news from home."
</p><p>He handed Bijonah a couple of letters and a package containing those
of the men. Two others he kept in his hand.
</p><p>For a few moments he chatted with the old man, telling him what had
happened in Freekirk Head. Then he asked for Nellie, whom he had not
seen. As he asked she came up out of the cabin, having just finished
breakfast.
</p><p>She was dressed in white this morning; a white canvas blouse with a
broad blue collar and V-neck held to modest stricture by a flowing
blue tie, a white duck skirt and whitened shoes--a costume that set
off her pink cheeks and bright eyes.
</p><p>Since the violent emotions of the fire at the Head, her courtship, and
her self-analyzation since her split with Nat, she had seemed to
become more of a woman.
</p><p>Nat had not the slightest doubt but that Nellie by this time would
have recovered from her angry pet of their last interview. He was very
certain that their ruction had only been temporary.
</p><p>Nellie was unfeignedly glad to see him.
</p><p>He stretched out his arms to her impulsively, but she refused him, and
he laughed the rebuff off good-naturedly.
</p><p>"Oh, did you bring any letters for me?" she cried eagerly.
</p><p>He held out the two he had kept in his hand.
</p><p>"Oh, goodness, Nat--only from mama and Lutie Bissell. You excited me
so!"
</p><p>He spread a tarpaulin amid the clutter amidships and they sat down.
</p><p>She excused herself and began to read her letters, first opening the
one from the girl friend, which, as such letters usually do, contained
nothing of importance. Then she opened the one from her mother. It was
long, and she settled back to the pleasure of deciphering it.
</p><p>Nat smoked and whistled and looked out to sea, waiting for her to
finish. Therefore he did not observe the changes that passed across
her face. Near the middle of the letter the color rose to her forehead
in a hot wave, but at the end it had receded, leaving her pale.
Methodically she folded the letter and returned it to its envelope.
</p><p>"Well, dearest," he said cheerfully, "all through? Now I want to talk
to you--" He reached for her hand, but she withdrew it beyond his
reach and looked at him with the steady brown eyes whose level gaze he
hated.
</p><p>"Come on, now, Nellie," he said impatiently, stung by her relentlessness,
"you ain't goin' to be mad forever about that other time, are you? I was
out of temper an' said things--"
</p><p>"Mother was up to Mallaby House for dinner a little while ago,"
interrupted Nellie, as though she had not heard him.
</p><p>"Yes? That's good. Fine place, ain't it? As I was sayin', I forgot
myself--"
</p><p>"They talked about us, too; mother says that's nearly all they talked
about."
</p><p>"Must've been short of conversation. An' I want to say, Nellie, that
I'll try never to speak like that to you again. I--"
</p><p>"Mother says she learned things about you that she never had
imagined before," persisted Nellie, with quiet insistence. But
again Nat did not seem to have heard her. With an awkward motion he
drew from his pocket the little glazed paper box that contained the
engagement-ring.
</p><p>"Please," he said, "I want you to take this again." He was in
earnest.
</p><p>"It's strange Elsa Mallaby should be able to tell mother things about
you."
</p><p>Nat lost his patience. He had tried his best to make peace, and the
girl was only baiting him for her own amusement.
</p><p>"What the deuce is all this about that Mallaby woman?" he asked. "I
should think you'd listen to me, Nellie."
</p><p>"If you will listen to me first, then I'll listen to you as long as
you like."
</p><p>"I agree," he said, thrusting the ring-box back into his pocket, "only
make it short, will you, little girl?"
</p><p>"Yes, I will," she promised, without smiling. "I merely said that
mother and Mrs. Mallaby had discussed you and me, and our marriage,
and that Mrs. Mallaby had said some things about you."
</p><p>"Well, lots of people do that," he smiled.
</p><p>"Yes--but they haven't said just this thing, Nat."
</p><p>"What was that?"
</p><p>"I'm going to let you think. Just suppose that Mrs. Mallaby hated you
very much and wanted to do you harm. What would she tell my mother?"
</p><p>The girl, pale and on the verge of an hysterical outburst, watched his
face out of her mask of self-control.
</p><p>The blood beneath his tan receded and was replaced by a sickly
greenish hue. That flash had brought its memory--a memory that had
lain buried beneath the events of his later life. Did she know? How
could she know?
</p><p>To the girl watching him there was confirmation enough. She was
suddenly filled with inexpressible distaste for this man who had in
days past smothered her with caresses and dinned into her ears
speeches concerning a passion that he called love.
</p><p>"I see it is all true," she said quietly. "This is all I have to say.
Now I will listen to what you were going to tell me a few minutes
ago--that is, if you still wish to say it."
</p><p>Nat read his doom in those few calm words. The things that had been in
his mind to say rose and choked his throat; the thought of the ring in
his pocket seemed like profanation. He gulped twice and tried to
speak, but the words clotted on his tongue.
</p><p>Still she sat quietly looking at him, politely ready to listen.
</p><p>With a horrible croaking sound he got to his feet, looked irresolutely
at her for a moment, and then went to the side where his dory lay. She
next saw him rowing dazedly to the <u>Nettle B.</u>, and then she turned
her face from the sight of him.
</p><p>And suddenly into her mind, long prepared, came the thought of Code
Schofield. Amid the chaos of her shattered ideals his face and figure
rose more desirable than all the earth.
</p><p>"Oh, Heaven, give him to me--some time!" she breathed in a voice of
humble prayer.
</p><p>Nat Burns went back to his schooner, squarely defeated for the first
time in his life. Humbled, and cringing like a whipped dog, he made
his dory fast to the <u>Nettie's</u> rail and slunk aft to the solitude of
his cabin. He was glad that even the cook was looking the other way.
</p><p>"She has flouted me, and the whole of Grande Mignon will know it," he
said to himself. "Then they will want to know why, but that is easy
enough to lie about. Hang that Mallaby woman! Who would ever think
she'd squeal? Yes, and Schofield, the smug crook! They're the two that
are doin' the damage to me."
</p><p>Nat's lifelong knowledge of Code's and Nellie's affection returned to
him now with a more poignant pang of memory than he had ever
experienced. With the hopeless egotism of a totally selfish nature, he
laid his calamity in love to activity on Code's part. He was pretty
well aware of Elsa's extravagant favoritism of Code, and he
immediately figured that Code had enlisted Elsa on his side to the
ruin of Nat.
</p><p>"So I've got to beat 'em all now, have I?" he asked grimly, his jaw
setting with an ugly click. "Schofield and Mallaby, and--yes--while
I'm about it, Tanner, too. The old man never liked me, the girl hates
me, and I wouldn't mind giving 'em a dig along with the rest. Just to
show 'em that I'm not so easy an' peaceful as I look! But how?"
</p><p>For a considerable space of time he sat there, his head low on his
breast, and his eyes half closed as his brain went over scheme after
scheme. The detective that Nat had brought from St. Andrew's stuck his
head down the cabin and remarked:
</p><p>"Look here, captain, I want to arrest my man and get back. Why don't
you hunt up that ship and let me finish?"
</p><p>"I've got something a lot better on hand, Durkee," remarked Nat with a
grin, rising from his chair, a plan having leaped full blown into his
mind. "Just stick along with me and you'll get your man, all right."
</p><p>He went outside and called the men in with a revolver-shot and a trawl
tub run to the masthead. It was about noon when they came in, and,
after eating, three o'clock passed before they had finished dressing
down.
</p><p>"Any of you boys run across a dory from the <u>Night Hawk?</u>" asked Nat
as the men came inboard with their shower of fish.
</p><p>"Yes," said a youth, "I f'und one of 'em an' he told me the <u>Hawk's</u>
luck was Jonahed this trip."
</p><p>"Where's the packet lyin'?"
</p><p>"About twelve mile sou'east near the edge of the Bank."
</p><p>Nat went to the wheel himself.
</p><p>"Up jib an' fores'l," he sung out, "and sway 'em flat! Mains'l and
tops'ls after that! Raymond, overhaul the balloon, stays'l, and
trys'l! Mebbe we'll drive her a little afore we're through."
</p><p>Burns found the <u>Night Hawk</u> in a patch of sea by herself, more or
less deserted by the other schooners because of the Jonah report that
had gone abroad concerning her. Her dories were just coming in from
the day's work partially loaded with fish.
</p><p>"Hello!" bawled Nat. "Is Billy Stetson aboard?" Billy was the
skipper.
</p><p>"Yas; d'ye want to see him?"
</p><p>"Yes, send him along over. It's mighty important, but I ain't goin'
aboard no Jonah boat. Tell him he'll be glad he came."
</p><p>Presently Stetson came and the two retired into the cabin of the
<u>Nettie B.</u>
