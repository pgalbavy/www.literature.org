<p><em>THE BURGLAR, </em>fairly trapped, gnashed his teeth with
rage. To have been caught thus by a boy whom he had despised,
increased his rage and humiliation. Besides he was in great peril.
Burglary, and indeed all offences against property, were severely
punished in this new State. It was a matter of necessity, considering
the elements that had been brought together, and the freedom and
lack of restraint that characterized the people. So the ruffian
was fairly frightened. But he resolved to try the effect of one
more appeal.</p>

<p>"Listen, boy," he called out. "Let me out, and I will not only
promise to do no harm and take no money, but I will give you two
hundred dollars in gold, which I have in my pocket at this moment."</p>

<p>But Tom was not to be caught by a promise only made to be broken.</p>

<p>"That’s too thin," he answered back. "I sha’n’t let you out.
You are best off where you are."</p>

<p>"I’d like to kill him!" thought the burglar, grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>"Beware what you say, boy," he shouted. "You have me at advantage
now, but the time will come when I shall be free. When that time
comes I will kill you unless you release me at once."</p>

<p>"I must take the risk," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Then you won’t let me out?"</p>

<p>"I won’t."</p>

<p>There was no answer, for the burglar, who had previously decided
that he could not lift the trap-door, determined to see if there
was no other mode of egress.</p>

<p>Here was Tom’s danger.</p>

<p>There was a door at one side, as already explained. This had
hitherto escaped the burglar’s attention, for the dark-lantern
lighted up only a small part of the cellar, and left the rest
in gloom. Supposing the door was found, and being bolted within,
it could easily be opened and egress obtained, Tom would be in
a perilous position. The burglar would again enter as he had done
previously, and inflamed by anger, would not only take the gold,
but perhaps kill our hero.</p>

<p>This thought was enough to startle the bravest. Tom felt that
he must have assistance, and he took the most effectual way of
calling it.</p>

<p>He threw open the outer door, stepped into the street, and fired
the revolver, not once only, but twice. In the silent street,
wrapped in darkness, these two shots were heard with startling
emphasis. Neighbors rushed to their windows and called out:</p>

<p>"What has happened? What’s the matter?"</p>

<p>"Help!" exclaimed Tom. "Come here at once. There’s a burglar
in the cellar. Come quick, and help me secure him."</p>

<p>Half a dozen men hurried on their clothes, seized arms and hurried
down into the street.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the noise of the revolver had been heard by the trapped
burglar also.</p>

<p>"Confusion!" he exclaimed, with an oath, "the boy is calling
assistance. He must be afraid I will get out. There must be a
door somewhere. I must find it at once, or all is over with me."</p>

<p>He had been turning his attention to the wrong side of the cellar,
and this delayed him a little. But finally, with a cry of triumph,
he espied the door. He saw also that it was bolted inside, and
inferred that there would be no difficulty in opening it. But
for some reason it stuck, and this occasioned further delay. Otherwise
he might have got out in time to attack Tom before the arrival
of help. But the little delay was in our hero’s favor. When the
burglar got out he heard voices of men speaking with his young
enemy.</p>

<p>"Where’s the burglar?" asked Archibald Campbell, a gigantic Scot,
who was the next-door neighbor.</p>

<p>"In the cellar," said Tom in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Can he get out?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom in a whisper, so as to afford no information
in case the discovery had not yet been made. "There’s a side door,
and if he’s found it he’s free now perhaps."</p>

<p>"Where is the door?"</p>

<p>"On that side."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said the brave Scot, "we’ll nab him. What weapons
has he got?"</p>

<p>"A knife, and perhaps a revolver."</p>

<p>By this time another man had come up.</p>

<p>"We must have him if it’s a possible thing," said Campbell. "That
sort of vermin are best shut up where they can’t get into mischief."</p>

<p>The burglar, now outside, heard these last words. He realized
that Tom was too strong now to attack, and that his only safety
lay in flight. If he could get away, there would be a chance for
retaliation later. He could not escape into the street. That was
barred by his pursuers. In the rear there was a fence to be surmounted.
That was the only way of escape.</p>

<p>He was mounting the fence when his enemies came round the corner
of the house and espied him.</p>

<p>"There he is," said Tom.</p>

<p>Archibald Campbell raised his revolver and covered the ruffian.</p>

<p>"Halt, man!" he cried. "Do you surrender?"</p>

<p>"No, hang you!" answered the burglar, and he, also, was about
to draw a corresponding weapon, when the Scotchman, feeling that
their lives were in peril, and there was no time for parley, fired,
striking the man in the wrist. The weapon fell to the ground,
and he uttered an exclamation of pain. Before he could recover
the weapon they had rushed upon him.</p>

<p>"Look out for his knife!" shouted Tom.</p>

<p>This made them cautious, and they stood off at a distance of
six feet.</p>

<p>"Come down from that fence," said Campbell in a commanding tone,
"and give yourself up as our prisoner. If you refuse, or if you
stoop to raise that pistol, I will shoot you through the head."</p>

<p>There was a stern resoluteness in his tone which convinced the
ruffian that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" he asked doggedly.</p>

<p>"What should we want with such as you? To give you up to the
authorities. It is not safe for such men to be at large."</p>

<p>"Let me go," pleaded the burglar abruptly. "I have taken nothing."</p>

<p>"You intended to."</p>

<p>"But I have not, and I will not—from you. I will agree to leave
the city and never return."</p>

<p>"You cannot be trusted," said the Scotchman promptly. "We can
make no conditions with you."</p>

<p>"You may repent this," the ruffian growled.</p>

<p>"I should repent letting you go, but I sha’n’t leave any chance
of that. Are you coming down?"</p>

<p>Slowly and reluctantly the burglar backed down from the fence,
and with a longing look at his pistol, which he knew it would
be death to pick up, he allowed himself to be taken prisoner.</p>

<p>"Drop your knife," said his chief captor.</p>

<p>He obeyed with a malignant scowl at Tom.</p>

<p>"I’d like to sheathe it in that boy," he muttered, "and I will
some time."</p>

<p>"Don’t let him frighten you, my lad," said the Scotchman. "You’ve
done your duty bravely."</p>

<p>"He does not frighten me," said Tom calmly.</p>

<p>A crowd had collected by this time, who escorted the burglar
to the lock-up.</p>

<p>"Now," thought Tom as he re-entered the shop, "I’ll try to get
a little more sleep."</p>
