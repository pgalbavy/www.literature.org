<p>The amazement which so nearly overwhelmed Fred Ashman during
the few minutes succeeding the surrender of Ziffak, was shared
in all its entirety, when the two presented themselves before
the astounded explorers in the canoe.</p>

<p>In fact, Jared Long came within a hair of shooting the Hercules,
before the situation could be explained to him.  Even then he
refused for awhile to believe the astonishing story, but declared
that some infernal trickery was afoot.  Finally, however, he and
the Professor and Bippo and Pedros realized that the most powerful
enemy had become their ally.</p>

<p>Ziffak showed a strange talkativeness after joining the company.
Seating himself on the ground where all were now veiled in shadow,
he answered the questions that were rained upon him, until most
of the information given in the preceding chapter was told to
the wondering listeners.</p>

<p>The account of the dreadful reception that awaited their predecessors
three years before, would have deterred such brave men as the
explorers from pushing further, but for the fact that they had
secured an all-powerful friend at court.  Believing that he could
pave the way for a friendly reception, they were eager to visit
what seemed to them an enchanted land.</p>

<p>There was some uneasiness over Waggaman and Burkhardt, who, it
could be easily seen, would at the most do nothing more than disguise
their enmity under the guise of friendship, holding themselves
ready for some treachery that would bring about the death of the
visitors.</p>

<p>The conversation lasted a long time, and was ended by the natural
question put to Ziffak as to what should be the next step.</p>

<p>From what he had already stated, it was evident they were not
yet through with the Aryks.  Despite their frightful repulse,
they would hold the Murhapas in greater dread than the whites;
and, well aware of the penalty of allowing them to pass above
the rapids, would never cease their efforts to prevent such a
disaster.  It followed, therefore, that something must be done
to spike their guns, and Ziffak was the only one who could do
it.</p>

<p>The whites were not surprised, when he offered to return to the
point down the river, where he had left his canoe, recross to
the other side, and make known to the Aryks that it was his wish
that the explorers should be molested no further.</p>

<p>The announcement would be a surprise indeed to them, but there
was none who would dare question the authority of such a source.</p>

<p>During the absorbingly interesting conversation, Ziffak stated
that his object in coming from the other side was to reach the
camp of the whites at the same time that an attack was made by
the Aryks who so cunningly used the floating logs and trees as
a screen to hide their approach.  He preferred his course to that
of accompanying them.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen, that, although the act of Fred Ashman in
passing down the Xingu seemed like a mistake, yet it was the most
providential thing that could have occurred.</p>

<p>Having made known his plan, the burly chieftain set about carrying
it out with characteristic promptness.  Without saying good-bye,
he rose to his feet, and walking rapidly off, soon disappeared
in the direction of the spot where took place his encounter with
the puma and his meeting with Fred Ashman.</p>

<p>He had not been gone long, when those left in camp caught sight
of the little boat skimming swiftly across the Xingu below them. 
The preliminaries of the singular movement in their favor was
going on according to programme.</p>

<p>But, with the departure of Ziffak, something like a distrust
of his friendship entered the minds of the three whites.  Bippo
and Pedros were so overcome by what they had seen that they were
unable to comprehend what it all meant.  They kept their places
in the boat and listened and wondered in silence.</p>

<p>The Professor hoped for the best, though he admitted that there
was something inexplainable in the business.  He had spent hours
in examining the strange fish of the Upper Xingu, in inspecting
the remarkable plants, which he saw for the first time, and in
studying the zoology and mineralogy of the region.  He had been
delighted and puzzled, over and over again, but all of these problems
combined failed to astonish him as did the action of Ziffak and
the story he told.</p>

<p>Ashman was the most hopeful of all.  He had been with the native
more than the rest, and was given the opportunity to study him
closely.  He was confident that he read the workings of his mind
aright, and that the fellow would be their friend to the end.</p>

<p>Jared Long, the New Englander, was equally positive in the other
direction.  He maintained that since the leopard cannot change
his spots, no savage showing such relentless hatred of the white
race as did Ziffak, could be transformed into a friend for no
other reason than that he had been made a prisoner.</p>

<p>He insisted further that, if he succeeded in helping them through
to the Murhapa village, it would be only with the purpose of securing
a more complete revenge.  Such a powerful tribe as his need feel
no misgiving in allowing a small party to enter their town; for,
after that was done, they would be so completely at their mercy
that there was no possibility of any explorer ever living to tell
the tale.</p>

<p>He especially dwelt upon the undoubted influence possessed by
Waggaman and Burkhardt.  They would never consent to yield the
influence they had held so long, nor could they be induced to
share it with any of their own countrymen.</p>

<p>Grimcke and Ashman laughed at his fears, but strive as much as
they chose, they could not help being affected more or less by
his pessimistic views.</p>

<p>However, the brave fellow declared that he would accompany them
on the hazardous journey, and stick by them to the end.  If they
could not survive, they would fall together.</p>

<p>By this time the night was far along.  A careful scrutiny of
the other bank failed to reveal anything of their enemies, though
all believed there were plenty of them along the shore.</p>

<p>Ashman proposed, that now, since they were entirely screened
by the projecting shadow of the wood, they should cautiously push
their way up the bank, as near as possible to the rapids, so as
to lessen the distance that was to be passed on the morrow.  There
could be no objection to this, and adjusting themselves in the
usual manner in the large canoe, they began the ascent of the
river.</p>

<p>Naturally they would have kept close to the shore to escape,
so far as they could, the force of the current, and the main object
now was to prevent their movements being seen by the vigilant
Aryks across the stream, who might resume hostilities before Ziffak
could make his wishes known to them.</p>

<p>Our friends did not forget that a large body of these warriors
had passed the Xingu above the rapids to reach the bank along
which the craft was now stealing its way; but they had received
such treatment that the survivors hurried from the vicinity.</p>

<p>Still there was a probability that after rallying from their
repulse, more of them had swam across and were at that moment
on the western shore, on the watch for just such a movement as
was under way.</p>

<p>If this should prove the case, it could not be expected that
Ziffak could interfere in time to prevent another sanguinary conflict;
but that might come about, even if the explorers remained where
they had stopped until daylight.  If the Aryks were prepared to
attack them while on the move, they could do so with equal effect
while they were not in motion.</p>

<p>The increasing roar of the rapids was a great disadvantage, for
it drowned all inferior noises and compelled our friends to depend
on their eyesight alone to discover the approach of danger.</p>

<p>There was an involuntary shudder on the part of all, when they
came opposite the scene of the desperate fight, and they hastened
past without exchanging a word.</p>

<p>They had not much further to go when they found themselves, for
the time, at the end of their voyage.  It was impossible to ascend
further, because of the rapids, which tossed the canoe about as
though it were an eggshell.</p>

<p>A halt was therefore made, and, at the moment this took place,
all observed that day was breaking, the light rapidly increasing
in the direction of the Aryk village.</p>

<p>"<em>Just what I told you</em>!" exclaimed Jared Long, as the
simultaneous discovery was made by all, that the forest around
them was swarming with the vengeful savages, eager for another
and bloodier joust at arms.</p>
