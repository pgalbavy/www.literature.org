<P>
There is no gainsaying that the Solomons are a hard-bitten bunch of islands.
On the other hand, there are worse places in the world. But to the new chum
who has no constitutional understanding of men and life in the rough, the
Solomons may indeed prove terrible.
<P>
It is true that fever and dysentery are perpetually on the walk-about, that
loathsome skin diseases abound, that the air is saturated with a poison that
bites into every pore, cut, or abrasion and plants malignant ulcers, and that
many strong men who escape dying there return as wrecks to their own
countries.  It is also true that the natives of the Solomons are a wild lot,
with a hearty appetite for human flesh and a fad for collecting human heads.
Their highest instinct of sportsmanship is to catch a man with his back turned
and to smite him a cunning blow with a tomahawk that severs the spinal column
at the base of the brain.  It is equally true that on some islands, such as
Malaita, the profit and loss account of social intercourse is calculated in
homicides. Heads are a medium of exchange, and white heads are extremely
valuable. Very often a dozen villages make a jack-pot, which they fatten moon
by moon, against the time when some brave warrior presents a white man's head,
fresh and gory, and claims the pot.
<P>
All the foregoing is quite true, and yet there are white men who have lived in
the Solomons a score of years and who feel homesick when they go away from
them. A man needs only to be careful-- and lucky--to live a long time in the
Solomons; but he must also be of the right sort. He must have the hallmark of
the inevitable white man stamped upon his soul. He must be inevitable. He must
have a certain grand carelessness of odds, a certain colossal
self-satisfaction, and a racial egotism that convinces him that one white is
better than a thousand niggers every day in the week, and that on Sunday he is
able to clean out two thousand niggers. For such are the things that have made
the white man inevitable. Oh, and one other thing--the white man who wishes to
be inevitable, must not merely despise the lesser breeds and think a lot of
himself; he must also fail to be too long on imagination. He must not
understand too well the instincts, customs, and mental processes of the
blacks, the yellows, and the browns; for it is not in such fashion that the
white race has tramped its royal road around the world.
<P>
Bertie Arkwright was not inevitable. He was too sensitive, too finely strung,
and he possessed too much imagination. The world was too much with him. He
projected himself too quiveringly into his environment. Therefore, the last
place in the world for him to come was the Solomons. He did not come,
expecting to stay. A five weeks' stop-over between steamers, he decided, would
satisfy the call of the primitive he felt thrumming the strings of his being.
At least, so he told the lady tourists on the MAKEMBO, though in different
terms; and they worshipped him as a hero, for they were lady tourists and they
would know only the safety of the steamer's deck as she threaded her way
through the Solomons.
<P>
There was another man on board, of whom the ladies took no notice. He was a
little shriveled wisp of a man, with a withered skin the color of mahogany.
His name on the passenger list does not matter, but his other name, Captain
Malu, was a name for niggers to conjure with, and to scare naughty
pickaninnies to righteousness from New Hanover to the New Hebrides. He had
farmed savages and savagery, and from fever and hardship, the crack of Sniders
and the lash of the overseers, had wrested five millions of money in the form
of bï¿½che-de-mer, sandalwood, pearl-shell and turtle-shell, ivory nuts and
copra, grasslands, trading stations, and plantations. Captain Malu's little
finger, which was broken, had more inevitableness in it than Bertie
Arkwright's whole carcass. But then, the lady tourists had nothing by which to
judge save appearances, and Bertie certainly was a fine-looking man. 
<P>
Bertie talked with Captain Malu in the smoking room, confiding to him his
intention of seeing life red and bleeding in the Solomons. Captain Malu agreed
that the intention was ambitious and honorable. It was not until several days
later that he became interested in Bertie, when that young adventurer insisted
on showing him an automatic 44-caliber pistol. Bertie explained the mechanism
and demonstrated by slipping a loaded magazine up the hollow butt.
<P>
"It is so simple," he said. He shot the outer barrel back along the inner one.
"That loads it and cocks it, you see. And then all I have to do is pull the
trigger, eight times, as fast as I can quiver my finger. See that safety
clutch. That's what I like about it. It is safe. It is positively fool-proof."
He slipped out the magazine. "You see how safe it is."
<P>
As he held it in his hand, the muzzle came in line with Captain Malu's
stomach. Captain Malu's blue eyes looked at it unswervingly.
<P>
"Would you mind pointing it in some other direction?" he asked.
<P>
"It's perfectly safe," Bertie assured him. "I withdrew the magazine. It's not
loaded now, you know."
<P>
"A gun is always loaded."
<P>
"But this one isn't."
<P>
"Turn it away just the same."
<P>
Captain Malu's voice was flat and metallic and low, but his eyes never left
the muzzle until the line of it was drawn past him and away from him.
<P>
"I'll bet a fiver it isn't loaded," Bertie proposed warmly.
<P>
The other shook his head.
<P>
"Then I'll show you."
<P>
Bertie started to put the muzzle to his own temple with the evident intention
of pulling the trigger.
<P>
"Just a second," Captain Malu said quietly, reaching out his hand. "Let me
look at it."
<P>
He pointed it seaward and pulled the trigger. A heavy explosion followed,
instantaneous with the sharp click of the mechanism that flipped a hot and
smoking cartridge sidewise along the deck.
<P>
Bertie's jaw dropped in amazement.
<P>
"I slipped the barrel back once, didn't I?" he explained. It was silly of me,
I must say."
<P>
He giggled flabbily, and sat down in a steamer chair. The blood had ebbed from
his face, exposing dark circles under his eyes.  His hands were trembling and
unable to guide the shaking cigarette to his lips. The world was too much with
him, and he saw himself with dripping brains prone upon the deck
<P>
"Really," he said, ". . . really."
<P>
"It's a pretty weapon," said Captain Malu, returning the automatic to him.
<P>
The Commissioner was on board the Makembo, returning from Sydney, and by his
permission a stop was made at Ugi to land a missionary. And at Ugi lay the
ketch ARLA, Captain Hansen, skipper. Now the Arla was one of many vessels
owned by Captain Malu, and it was at his suggestion and by his invitation that
Bertie went aboard the Arla as guest for a four days' recruiting cruise on the
coast of Malaita. Thereafter the ARLA would drop him at Reminge Plantation
(also owned by Captain Malu), where Bertie could remain for a week, and then
be sent over to Tulagi, the seat of government, where he would become the
Commissioner's guest. Captain Malu was responsible for two other suggestions,
which given, he disappears from this narrative. One was to Captain Hansen, the
other to Mr. Harriwell, manager of Reminge Plantation. Both suggestions were
similar in tenor, namely, to give Mr. Bertram Arkwright an insight into the
rawness and redness of life in the Solomons. Also, it is whispered that
Captain Malu mentioned that a case of Scotch would be coincidental with any
particularly gorgeous insight Mr. Arkwright might receive.     .   .   .   .  
.   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
<P>
"Yes, Swartz always was too pig-headed. You see, he took four of his boat's
crew to Tulagi to be flogged--officially, you know--then started back with
them in the whaleboat. It was pretty squally, and the boat capsized just
outside. Swartz was the only one drowned. Of course, it was an accident."
<P>
"Was it? Really?" Bertie asked, only half-interested, staring hard at the
black man at the wheel.
<P>
Ugi had dropped astern, and the ARLA was sliding along through a summer sea
toward the wooded ranges of Malaita. The helmsman who so attracted Bertie's
eyes sported a ten penny nail, stuck skewerwise through his nose. About his
neck was a string of pants buttons. Thrust through holes in his ears were a
can opener, the broken handle of a toothbrush, a clay pipe, the brass wheel of
an alarm clock, and several Winchester rifle cartridges.
<P>
On his chest, suspended from around his neck hung the half of a china plate.
Some forty similarly appareled blacks lay about the deck, fifteen of which
were boat's crew, the remainder being fresh labor recruits.
<P>
"Of course it was an accident," spoke up the ARLA'S mate, Jacobs, a slender,
dark-eyed man who looked more a professor than a sailor. "Johnny Bedip nearly
had the same kind of accident. He was bringing back several from a flogging,
when they capsized him. But he knew how to swim as well as they, and two of
them were drowned. He used a boat stretcher and a revolver. Of course it was
an accident."
<P>
"Quite common, them accidents," remarked the skipper. "You see that man at the
wheel, Mr. Arkwright? He's a man eater. Six months ago, he and the rest of the
boat's crew drowned the then captain of the ARLA. They did it on deck, sir,
right aft there by the mizzen-traveler."
<P>
"The deck was in a shocking state," said the mate.
<P>
"Do I understand--?" Bertie began.
<P>
"Yes, just that," said Captain Hansen. "It was an accidental drowning."
<P>
"But on deck--?"
<P>
"Just so. I don't mind telling you, in confidence, of course, that they used
an axe."
<P>
"This present crew of yours?"
<P>
Captain Hansen nodded.
<P>
"The other skipper always was too careless," explained the mate.  He but just
turned his back, when they let him have it."
<P>
"We haven't any show down here," was the skipper's complaint.  "The government
protects a nigger against a white every time.  You can't shoot first. You've
got to give the nigger first shot, or else the government calls it murder and
you go to Fiji.  That's why there's so many drowning accidents."
<P>
Dinner was called, and Bertie and the skipper went below, leaving the mate to
watch on deck.
<P>
"Keep an eye out for that black devil, Auiki," was the skipper's parting
caution. "I haven't liked his looks for several days."
<P>
"Right O," said the mate.
<P>
Dinner was part way along, and the skipper was in the middle of his story of
the cutting out of the Scottish Chiefs.
<P>
"Yes," he was saying, "she was the finest vessel on the coast.  But when she
missed stays, and before ever she hit the reef, the canoes started for her.
There were five white men, a crew of twenty Santa Cruz boys and Samoans, and
only the supercargo escaped. Besides, there were sixty recruits. They were all
kai-kai'd. Kai-kai?--oh, I beg your pardon. I mean they were eaten. Then there
was the James Edwards, a dandy-rigged--"
<P>
But at that moment there was a sharp oath from the mate on deck and a chorus
of savage cries. A revolver went off three times, and then was heard a loud
splash. Captain Hansen had sprung up the companionway on the instant, and
Bertie's eyes had been fascinated by a glimpse of him drawing his revolver as
he sprang.
<P>
Bertie went up more circumspectly, hesitating before he put his head above the
companionway slide. But nothing happened. The mate was shaking with
excitement, his revolver in his hand. Once he startled, and half-jumped
around, as if danger threatened his back.
<P>
"One of the natives fell overboard," he was saying, in a queer tense voice.
"He couldn't swim."
<P>
"Who was it?" the skipper demanded.
<P>
"Auiki," was the answer.
<P>
"But I say, you know, I heard shots," Bertie said, in trembling eagerness, for
he scented adventure, and adventure that was happily over with.
<P>
The mate whirled upon him, snarling:
<P>
"It"s a damned lie. There ain't been a shot fired. The nigger fell overboard."
<P>
Captain Hansen regarded Bertie with unblinking, lack-luster eyes.
<P>
"I--I thought--" Bertie was beginning.
<P>
"Shots?" said Captain Hansen, dreamily. "Shots? Did you hear any shots, Mr.
Jacobs?"
<P>
"Not a shot," replied Mr. Jacobs.
<P>
The skipper looked at his guest triumphantly, and said:
<P>
"Evidently an accident. Let us go down, Mr. Arkwright, and finish dinner."
<P>
Bertie slept that night in the captain's cabin, a tiny stateroom off the main
cabin. The for'ard bulkhead was decorated with a stand of rifles. Over the
bunk were three more rifles. Under the bunk was a big drawer, which, when he
pulled it out, he found filled with ammunition, dynamite, and several boxes of
detonators. He elected to take the settee on the opposite side.  Lying
conspicuously on the small table, was the Arla's log.  Bertie did not know
that it had been especially prepared for the occasion by Captain Malu, and he
read therein how on September 21, two boat's crew had fallen overboard and
been drowned.  Bertie read between the lines and knew better. He read how the
Arla's whale boat had been bushwhacked at Su'u and had lost three men; of how
the skipper discovered the cook stewing human flesh on the galley fire--flesh
purchased by the boat's crew ashore in Fui; of how an accidental discharge of
dynamite, while signaling, had killed another boat's crew; of night attacks;
ports fled from between the dawns; attacks by bushmen in mangrove swamps and
by fleets of salt-water men in the larger passages. One item that occurred
with monotonous frequency was death by dysentery. He noticed with alarm that
two white men had so died--guests, like himself, on the Arla.
<P>
"I say, you know," Bertie said next day to Captain Hansen. "I've been glancing
through your log."
<P>
The skipper displayed quick vexation that the log had been left lying about.
<P>
"And all that dysentery, you know, that's all rot, just like the accidental
drownings," Bertie continued. "What does dysentery really stand for?"
<P>
The skipper openly admired his guest's acumen, stiffened himself to make
indignant denial, then gracefully surrendered.
<P>
"You see, it's like this, Mr. Arkwright. These islands have got a bad enough
name as it is. It's getting harder every day to sign on white men. Suppose a
man is killed. The company has to pay through the nose for another man to take
the job. But if the man merely dies of sickness, it's all right. The new chums
don't mind disease. What they draw the line at is being murdered. I thought
the skipper of the Arla had died of dysentery when I took his billet. Then it
was too late. I'd signed the contract."
<P>
"Besides," said Mr. Jacobs, "there's altogether too many accidental drownings
anyway. It don't look right. It's the fault of the government. A white man
hasn't a chance to defend himself from the niggers."
<P>
"Yes, look at the Princess and that Yankee mate," the skipper took up the
tale. "She carried five white men besides a government agent. The captain, the
agent, and the supercargo were ashore in the two boats. They were killed to
the last man.  The mate and boson, with about fifteen of the crew--Samoans and
Tongans--were on board. A crowd of niggers came off from shore.  First thing
the mate knew, the boson and the crew were killed in the first rush. The mate
grabbed three cartridge belts and two Winchesters and skinned up to the
cross-trees. He was the sole survivor, and you can't blame him for being mad.
He pumped one rifle till it got so hot he couldn't hold it, then he pumped the
other. The deck was black with niggers. He cleaned them out.  He dropped them
as they went over the rail, and he dropped them as fast as they picked up
their paddles. Then they jumped into the water and started to swim for it, and
being mad, he got half a dozen more. And what did he get for it?"
<P>
"Seven years in Fiji," snapped the mate.
<P>
"The government said he wasn't justified in shooting after they'd taken to the
water," the skipper explained.
<P>
"And that's why they die of dysentery nowadays," the mate added.
<P>
"Just fancy," said Bertie, as he felt a longing for the cruise to be over.
<P>
Later on in the day he interviewed the black who had been pointed out to him
as a cannibal. This fellow's name was Sumasai. He had spent three years on a
Queensland plantation. He had been to Samoa, and Fiji, and Sydney; and as a
boat's crew had been on recruiting schooners through New Britain, New Ireland,
New Guinea, and the Admiralties. Also, he was a wag, and he had taken a line
on his skipper's conduct. Yes, he had eaten many men. How many? He could not
remember the tally. Yes, white men, too; they were very good, unless they were
sick. He had once eaten a sick one.
<P>
"My word!" he cried, at the recollection. "Me sick plenty along him. 'my belly
walk about too much."
<P>
Bertie shuddered, and asked about heads. Yes, Sumasai had several hidden
ashore, in good condition, sun-dried, and smoke-cured. One was of the captain
of a schooner. It had long whiskers. He would sell it for two quid. Black
men's heads he would sell for one quid. He had some pickaninny heads, in poor
condition, that he would let go for ten bob.
<P>
Five minutes afterward, Bertie found himself sitting on the companionway-slide
alongside a black with a horrible skin disease. He sheered off, and on inquiry
was told that it was leprosy. He hurried below and washed himself with
antiseptic soap. He took many antiseptic washes in the course of the day, for
every native on board was afflicted with malignant ulcers of one sort or
another.
<P>
As the Arla drew in to an anchorage in the midst of mangrove swamps, a double
row of barbed wire was stretched around above her rail. That looked like
business, and when Bertie saw the shore canoes alongside, armed with spears,
bows and arrows, and Sniders, he wished more earnestly than ever that the
cruise was over.
<P>
That evening the natives were slow in leaving the ship at sundown. A number of
them checked the mate when he ordered them ashore. "Never mind, I'll fix
them," said Captain Hansen, diving below.
<P>
When he cam back, he showed Bertie a stick of dynamite attached to a fish
hook. Now it happens that a paper-wrapped bottle of chlorodyne with a piece of
harmless fuse projecting can fool anybody. It fooled Bertie, and it fooled the
natives. When Captain Hansen lighted the fuse and hooked the fish hook into
the tail end of a native's loin cloth, that native was smitten with so an
ardent a desire for the shore that he forgot to shed the loin cloth. He
started for'ard, the fuse sizzling and spluttering at his rear, the natives in
his path taking headers over the barbed wire at every jump. Bertie was
horror-stricken.  So was Captain Hansen. He had forgotten his twenty-five
recruits, on each of which he had paid thirty shillings advance.  They went
over the side along with the shore-dwelling folk and followed by him who
trailed the sizzling chlorodyne bottle.
<P>
Bertie did not see the bottle go off; but the mate opportunely discharging a
stick of real dynamite aft where it would harm nobody, Bertie would have sworn
in any admiralty court to a nigger blown to flinders. The flight of the
twenty-five recruits had actually cost the Arla forty pounds, and, since they
had taken to the bush, there was no hope of recovering them. The skipper and
his mate proceeded to drown their sorrow in cold tea.
<P>
The cold tea was in whiskey bottles, so Bertie did not know it was cold tea
they were mopping up. All he knew was that the two men got very drunk and
argued eloquently and at length as to whether the exploded nigger should be
reported as a case of dysentery or as an accidental drowning. When they snored
off to sleep, he was the only white man left, and he kept a perilous watch
till dawn, in fear of an attack from shore and an uprising of the crew.
<P>
Three more days the Arla spent on the coast, and three more nights the skipper
and the mate drank overfondly of cold tea, leaving Bertie to keep the watch.
They knew he could be depended upon, while he was equally certain that if he
lived, he would report their drunken conduct to Captain Malu. Then the Arla
dropped anchor at Reminge Plantation, on Guadalcanar, and Bertie landed on the
beach with a sigh of relief and shook hands with the manager. 'mr. Harriwell
was ready for him.
<P>
"Now you mustn't be alarmed if some of our fellows seem downcast," Mr.
Harriwell said, having drawn him aside in confidence. "There's been talk of an
outbreak, and two or three suspicious signs I'm willing to admit, but
personally I think it's all poppycock."
<P>
"How--how many blacks have you on the plantation?" Bertie asked, with a
sinking heart.
<P>
"We're working four hundred just now," replied Mr. Harriwell, cheerfully; but
the three of us, with you, of course, and the skipper and mate of the Arla,
can handle them all right."
<P>
Bertie turned to meet one McTavish, the storekeeper, who scarcely acknowledged
the introduction, such was his eagerness to present his resignation.
<P>
"It being that I'm a married man, Mr. Harriwell, I can't very well afford to
remain on longer. Trouble is working up, as plain as the nose on your face.
The niggers are going to break out, and there'll be another Hohono horror
here."
<P>
"What's a Hohono horror?" Bertie asked, after the storekeeper had been
persuaded to remain until the end of the month.
<P>
"Oh, he means Hohono Plantation, on Ysabel," said the manager.  "The niggers
killed the five white men ashore, captured the schooner, killed the captain
and mate, and escaped in a body to Malaita. But I always said they were
careless on Hohono. They won't catch us napping here. Come along, Mr.
Arkwright, and see our view from the veranda."
<P>
Bertie was too busy wondering how he could get away to Tulagi to the
Commissioner's house, to see much of the view. He was still wondering, when a
rifle exploded very near to him, behind his back. At the same moment his arm
was nearly dislocated, so eagerly did Mr. Harriwell drag him indoors.
<P>
"I say, old man, that was a close shave," said the manager, pawing him over to
see if he had been hit. "I can't tell you how sorry I am. But it was broad
daylight, and I never dreamed."
<P>
Bertie was beginning to turn pale.
<P>
"They got the other manager that way," McTavish vouchsafed. "And a dashed fine
chap he was. Blew his brains out all over the veranda. You noticed that dark
stain there between the steps and the door?"
<P>
Bertie was ripe for the cocktail which Mr. Harriwell pitched in and compounded
for him; but before he could drink it, a man in riding trousers and puttees
entered.
<P>
"What's the matter now?" the manager asked, after one look at the newcomer's
face. "Is the river up again?"
<P>
"River be blowed--it's the niggers. Stepped out of the cane grass, not a dozen
feet away, and whopped at me. It was a Snider, and he shot from the hip. Now
what I want to know is where'd he get that Snider?--Oh, I beg pardon. Glad to
know you, Mr. Arkwright."
<P>
"Mr. Brown is my assistant," explained Mr. Harriwell. "And now let's have that
drink."
<P>
"But where'd he get that Snider?" Mr. Brown insisted. "I always objected to
keeping those guns on the premises."
<P>
"They're still there," Mr. Harriwell said, with a show of heat.
<P>
Mr. Brown smiled incredulously.
<P>
"Come along and see," said the manager.
<P>
Bertie joined the procession into the office, where Mr. Harriwell pointed
triumphantly at a big packing case in a dusty corner.
<P>
"Well, then where did the beggar get that Snider?" harped Mr. Brown.
<P>
But just then McTavish lifted the packing case. The manager started, then tore
off the lid. The case was empty. They gazed at one another in horrified
silence. Harriwell drooped wearily.
<P>
Then McVeigh cursed.
<P>
"What I contended all along--the house-boys are not to be trusted."
<P>
"It does look serious," Harriwell admitted, "but we'll come through it all
right. What the sanguinary niggers need is a shaking up. Will you gentlemen
please bring your rifles to dinner, and will you, Mr. Brown, kindly prepare
forty or fifty sticks of dynamite. 'make the fuses good and short. We'll give
them a lesson. And now, gentlemen, dinner is served."
<P>
One thing that Bertie detested was rice and curry, so it happened that he
alone partook of an inviting omelet. He had quite finished his plate, when
Harriwell helped himself to the omelet.  One mouthful he tasted, then spat out
vociferously.
<P>
"That's the second time," McTavish announced ominously.
<P>
Harriwell was still hawking and spitting.
<P>
"Second time, what?" Bertie quavered.
<P>
"Poison," was the answer. "That cook will be hanged yet."
<P>
"That's the way the bookkeeper went out at Cape March," Brown spoke up. "Died
horribly. They said on the Jessie that they heard him screaming three miles
away."
<P>
"I'll put the cook in irons," sputtered Harriwell. "Fortunately we discovered
it in time."
<P>
Bertie sat paralyzed. There was no color in his face. He attempted to speak,
but only an inarticulate gurgle resulted.  All eyed him anxiously.
<P>
"Don't say it, don't say it," McTavish cried in a tense voice.
<P>
"Yes, I ate it, plenty of it, a whole plateful!" Bertie cried explosively,
like a diver suddenly regaining breath.
<P>
The awful silence continued half a minute longer, and he read his fate in
their eyes.
<P>
"Maybe it wasn't poison after all," said Harriwell, dismally.
<P>
"Call in the cook," said Brown.
<P>
In came the cook, a grinning black boy, nose-spiked and ear-plugged.
<P>
"Here, you, Wi-wi, what name that?" Harriwell bellowed, pointing accusingly at
the omelet.
<P>
Wi-wi was very naturally frightened and embarrassed.
<P>
"Him good fella kai-kai," he murmured apologetically.
<P>
"Make him eat it," suggested McTavish. "That's a proper test."
<P>
Harriwell filled a spoon with the stuff and jumped for the cook, who fled in
panic.
<P>
"That settles it," was Brown's solemn pronouncement. "He won't eat it."
<P>
"Mr. Brown, will you please go and put the irons on him?"  Harriwell turned
cheerfully to Bertie. "It's all right, old man, the Commissioner will deal
with him, and if you die, depend upon it, he will be hanged."
<P>
"Don't think the government'll do it," objected McTavish.
<P>
"But gentlemen, gentlemen," Bertie cried. "In the meantime think of me."
<P>
Harriwell shrugged his shoulders pityingly.
<P>
"Sorry, old man, but it's a native poison, and there are no known antidotes
for native poisons. Try and compose yourself and if--"
<P>
Two sharp reports of a rifle from without, interrupted the discourse, and
Brown, entering, reloaded his rifle and sat down to table.
<P>
"The cook's dead," he said. "Fever. A rather sudden attack."
<P>
"I was just telling Mr. Arkwright that there are no antidotes for native
poisons--"
<P>
"Except gin," said Brown.
<P>
Harriwell called himself an absent-minded idiot and rushed for the gin bottle.
<P>
"Neat, man, neat," he warned Bertie, who gulped down a tumbler two-thirds full
of the raw spirits, and coughed and choked from the angry bite of it till the
tears ran down his cheeks.
<P>
Harriwell took his pulse and temperature, made a show of looking out for him,
and doubted that the omelet had been poisoned.  Brown and McTavish also
doubted; but Bertie discerned an insincere ring in their voices. His appetite
had left him, and he took his own pulse stealthily under the table. There was
no question but what it was increasing, but he failed to ascribe it to the gin
he had taken. 'mcTavish, rifle in hand, went out on the veranda to
reconnoiter.
<P>
"They're massing up at the cook-house," was his report. "And they've no end of
Sniders. 'my idea is to sneak around on the other side and take them in flank.
Strike the first blow, you know. Will you come along, Brown?"
<P>
Harriwell ate on steadily, while Bertie discovered that his pulse had leaped
up five beats. Nevertheless, he could not help jumping when the rifles began
to go off. Above the scattering of Sniders could be heard the pumping of
Brown's and McTavish's Winchesters--all against a background of demoniacal
screeching and yelling.
<P>
"They've got them on the run," Harriwell remarked, as voices and gunshots
faded away in the distance.
<P>
Scarcely were Brown and McTavish back at the table when the latter
reconnoitered.
<P>
"They've got dynamite," he said.
<P>
"Then let's charge them with dynamite," Harriwell proposed.
<P>
Thrusting half a dozen sticks each into their pockets and equipping themselves
with lighted cigars, they started for the door. And just then it happened.
They blamed McTavish for it afterward, and he admitted that the charge had
been a trifle excessive. But at any rate it went off under the house, which
lifted up cornerwise and settled back on its foundations. Half the china on
the table was shattered, while the eight-day clock stopped. Yelling for
vengeance, the three men rushed out into the night, and the bombardment began.
<P>
When they returned, there was no Bertie. He had dragged himself away to the
office, barricaded himself in, and sunk upon the floor in a gin-soaked
nightmare, wherein he died a thousand deaths while the valorous fight went on
around him. In the morning, sick and headachey from the gin, he crawled out to
find the sun still in the sky and God presumable in heaven, for his hosts were
alive and uninjured.
<P>
Harriwell pressed him to stay on longer, but Bertie insisted on sailing
immediately on the Arla for Tulagi, where, until the following steamer day, he
stuck close by the Commissioner's house. There were lady tourists on the
outgoing steamer, and Bertie was again a hero, while Captain Malu, as usual,
passed unnoticed. But Captain Malu sent back from Sydney two cases of the best
Scotch whiskey on the market, for he was not able to make up his mind as to
whether it was Captain Hansen or Mr Harriwell who had given Bertie Arkwright
the more gorgeous insight into life in the Solomons.
