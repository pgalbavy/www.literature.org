<P>
UNDER the guidance of the French squire the party passed down two
narrow corridors.  The first was empty, but at the head of the
second stood a peasant sentry, who started off at the sight of
them, yelling loudly to his comrades.  "Stop him, or we are
undone!" cried Du Guesclin, and had started to run, when
Aylward's great war-bow twanged like a harp-string, and the man
fell forward upon his face, with twitching limbs and clutching
fingers.  Within five paces of where he lay a narrow and little-
used door led out into the bailey.  From beyond it came such a
Babel of hooting and screaming, horrible oaths and yet more
horrible laughter, that the stoutest heart might have shrunk from
casting down the frail barrier which faced them.
<P>
"Make straight for the keep!" said Du Guesclin, in a sharp, stern
whisper.  "The two archers in front, the lady in the centre, a
squire on either side, while we three knights shall bide behind
and beat back those who press upon us.  So!  Now open the door,
and God have us in his holy keeping!"
<P>
For a few moments it seemed that their object would be attained
without danger, so swift and so silent had been their movements.
They were half-way across the bailey ere the frantic, howling
peasants made a movement to stop them.  The few who threw
themselves in their way were overpowered or brushed aside, while
the pursuers were beaten back by the ready weapons of the three
cavaliers.  Unscathed they fought their way to the door of the
keep, and faced round upon the swarming mob, while the squire
thrust the great key into the lock.
<P>
"My God!" he cried, "it is the wrong key."
<P>
"The wrong key!"
<P>
"Dolt, fool that I am!  This is the key of the castle gate; the
other opens the keep.  I must back for it!"  He turned, with some
wild intention of retracing his steps, but at the instant a great
jagged rock, hurled by a brawny peasant, struck him full upon the
ear, and he dropped senseless to the ground.
<P>
"This is key enough for me!" quoth Hordle John, picking up the
huge stone, and hurling it against the door with all the strength
of his enormous body.  The lock shivered, the wood smashed, the
stone flew into five pieces, but the iron clamps still held the
door in its position.  Bending down, he thrust his great fingers
under it, and with a heave raised the whole mass of wood and iron
from its hinges.  For a moment it tottered and swayed, and then,
falling outward, buried him in its ruin, while his comrades
rushed into the dark archway which led to safety.
<P>
"Up the steps, Tiphaine!" cried Du Guesclin.  "Now round,
friends, and beat them back!"  The mob of peasants had surged in
upon their heels, but the two trustiest blades in Europe gleamed
upon that narrow stair, and four of their number dropped upon the
threshold.  The others gave back, and gathered in a half circle
round the open door, gnashing their teeth and shaking their
clenched hands at the defenders.  The body of the French squire
had been dragged out by them and hacked to pieces, Three or four
others had pulled John from under the door, when he suddenly
bounded to his feet, and clutching one in either hand dashed
them together with such force that they fell senseless across
each other upon the ground. With a kick and a blow he freed
himself from two others who clung to him, and in a moment he was
within the portal with his comrades.
<P>
Yet their position was a desperate one.  The peasants from far
and near had been assembled for this deed of vengeance, and not
less than six thousand were within or around the walls of the
Chateau of Villefranche.  Ill armed and half starved, they were
still desperate men, to whom danger had lost all fears: for what
was death that they should shun it to cling to such a life as
theirs?  The castle was theirs, and the roaring flames were
spurting through the windows and flickering high above the
turrets on two sides of the quadrangle.  From either side they
were sweeping down from room to room and from bastion to bastion
in the direction of the keep.  Faced by an army, and girt in by
fire, were six men and one woman; but some of them were men so
trained to danger and so wise in war that even now the combat was
less unequal than it seemed.  Courage and resource were penned in
by desperation and numbers, while the great yellow sheets of
flame threw their lurid glare over the scene of death.
<P>
"There is but space for two upon a step to give free play to our
sword-arms," said Du Guesclin.  "Do you stand with me, Nigel,
upon the lowest.  France and England will fight together this
night.  Sir Otto, I pray you to stand behind us with this young
squire.  The archers may go higher yet and shoot over our heads.
I would that we had our harness, Nigel."
<P>
"Often have I heard my dear Sir John Chandos say that a knight
should never, even when a guest, be parted from it. Yet it will
be more honor to us if we come well out of it. We have a vantage,
since we see them against the light and they can scarce see us.
It seems to me that they muster for an onslaught."
<P>
"If we can but keep them in play," said the Bohemian, "it is
likely that these flames may bring us succor if there be any true
men in the country."
<P>
"Bethink you, my fair lord," said Alleyne to Sir Nigel, "that we
have never injured these men, nor have we cause of quarrel
against them.  Would it not be well, if but for the lady's sake,
to speak them fair and see if we may not come to honorable terms
with them?"
<P>
"Not so, by St. Paul!" cried Sir Nigel.  "It does not accord with
mine honor, nor shall it ever be said that I, a knight of
England, was ready to hold parley with men who have slain a fair
lady and a holy priest."
<P>
"As well hold parley with a pack of ravening wolves," said the
French captain.  "Ha!  Notre Dame Du Guesclin!  Saint Ives!
Saint Ives!"
<P>
As he thundered forth his war-cry, the Jacks who had been
gathering before the black arch of the gateway rushed in madly in
a desperate effort to carry the staircase.  Their leaders were a
small man, dark in the face, with his beard done up in two
plaits, and another larger man, very bowed in the shoulders, with
a huge club studded with sharp nails in his hand.  The first had
not taken three steps ere an arrow from Aylward's bow struck him
full in the chest, and he fell coughing and spluttering across
the threshold.  The other rushed onwards, and breaking between Du
Guesclin and Sir Nigel he dashed out the brains of the Bohemian
with a single blow of his clumsy weapon. With three swords
through him he still struggled on, and had almost won his way
through them ere he fell dead upon the stair.  Close at his heels
came a hundred furious peasants, who flung themselves again and
again against the five swords which confronted them.  It was cut
and parry and stab as quick as eye could see or hand act.  The
door was piled with bodies, and the stone floor was slippery with
blood.  The deep shout of Du Guesclin, the hard, hissing breath
of the pressing multitude, the clatter of steel, the thud of
falling bodies, and the screams of the stricken, made up such a
medley as came often in after years to break upon Alleyne's
sleep.  Slowly and sullenly at last the throng drew off, with
many a fierce backward glance, while eleven of their number lay
huddled in front of the stair which they had failed to win.
<P>
"The dogs have had enough," said Du Guesclin.
<P>
"By Saint Paul! there appear to be some very worthy and valiant
persons among them," observed Sir Nigel.  "They are men from
whom, had they been of better birth, much honor and advancement
might be gained.  Even as it is, it is a great pleasure to have
seen them.  But what is this that they are bringing forward?"
<P>
"It is as I feared," growled Du Guesclin.  "They will burn us
out, since they cannot win their way past us.  Shoot straight and
hard, archers; for, by St. Ives! our good swords are of little
use to us."
<P>
As he spoke, a dozen men rushed forward, each screening himself
behind a huge fardel of brushwood.  Hurling their burdens in one
vast heap within the portal, they threw burning torches upon the
top of it.  The wood had been soaked in oil, for in an instant it
was ablaze, and a long, hissing, yellow flame licked over the
heads of the defenders, and drove them further up to the first
floor of the keep.  They had scarce reached it, however, ere they
found that the wooden joists and planks of the flooring were
already on fire.  Dry and worm-eaten, a spark upon them became a
smoulder, and a smoulder a blaze.  A choking smoke filled the
air, and the five could scarce grope their way to the staircase
which led up to the very summit of the square tower.
<P>
Strange was the scene which met their eyes from this eminence.
Beneath them on every side stretched the long sweep of peaceful
country, rolling plain, and tangled wood, all softened and
mellowed in the silver moonshine.  No light, nor movement, nor
any sign of human aid could be seen, but far away the hoarse
clangor of a heavy bell rose and fell upon the wintry air.  Be-
neath and around them blazed the huge fire, roaring find
crackling on every side of the bailey, and even as they looked
the two corner turrets fell in with a deafening crash, and the
whole castle was but a shapeless mass, spouting flames and smoke
from every window and embrasure.  The great black tower upon
which they stood rose like a last island of refuge amid this sea
of fire but the ominous crackling and roaring below showed that
it would not be long ere it was engulfed also in the common ruin.
At their very feet was the square courtyard, crowded with the
howling and dancing peasants, their fierce faces upturned, their
clenched hands waving, all drunk with bloodshed and with
vengeance.  A yell of execration and a scream of hideous laughter
burst from the vast throng, as they saw the faces of the last
survivors of their enemies peering down at them from the height
of the keep.  They still piled the brushwood round the base of
the tower, and gambolled hand in hand around the blaze, screaming
out the doggerel lines which had long been the watchword of the
Jacquerie:
<P>
Cessez, cessez, gens d'armes et pletons, De piller et manger le
bonhomme Qui de longtemps Jacques Bonhomme Se homme.
<P>
Their thin, shrill voices rose high above the roar of the flames
and the crash of the masonry, like the yelping of a pack of
wolves who see their quarry before them and know that they have
well-nigh run him down.
<P>
"By my hilt!" said Aylward to John, "it is in my mind that we
shall not see Spain this journey.  It is a great joy to me that I
have placed my feather-bed and other things of price with that
worthy woman at Lyndhurst, who will now have the use of them. I
have thirteen arrows yet, and if one of them fly unfleshed, then,
by the twang of string!  I shall deserve my doom.  First at him
who flaunts with my lady's silken frock.  Clap in the clout, by
God! though a hand's-breadth lower than I had meant. Now for the
rogue with the head upon his pike.  Ha! to the inch, John.  When
my eye is true, I am better at rovers than at long-butts or
hoyles.  A good shoot for you also, John!  The villain hath
fallen forward into the fire.  But I pray you, John, to loose
gently, and not to pluck with the drawing-hand, for it is a trick
that hath marred many a fine bowman."
<P>
Whilst the two archers were keeping up a brisk fire upon the mob
beneath them, Du Guesclin and his lady were consulting with Sir
Nigel upon their desperate situation.
<P>
" 'Tis a strange end for one who has seen so many stricken
fields," said the French chieftain.  "For me one death is as
another, but it is the thought of my sweet lady which goes to my
heart."
<P>
"Nay, Bertrand, I fear it as little as you," said she.  "Had I my
dearest wish, it would be that we should go together."
<P>
"Well answered, fair lady!" cried Sir Nigel.  "And very sure I am
that my own sweet wife would have said the same.  If the end be
now come, I have had great good fortune in having lived in times
when so much glory was to be won, and in knowing so many valiant
gentlemen and knights.  But why do you pluck my sleeve, Alleyne?"
<P>
"If it please you, my fair lord, there are in this corner two
great tubes of iron, with many heavy balls, which may perchance
be those bombards and shot of which I have heard."
<P>
"By Saint Ives! it is true," cried Sir Bertrand, striding across
to the recess where the ungainly, funnel-shaped, thick-ribbed
engines were standing.  "Bombards they are, and of good size. We
may shoot down upon them."
<P>
"Shoot with them, quotha?" cried Aylward in high disdain, for
pressing danger is the great leveller of classes.  "How is a man
to take aim with these fool's toys, and how can he hope to do
scath with them?"
<P>
"I will show you," answered Sir Nigel; "for here is the great box
of powder, and if you will raise it for me, John, I will show you
how it may be used.  Come hither, where the folk are thickest
round the fire.  Now, Aylward, crane thy neck and see what would
have been deemed an old wife's tale when we first turned our
faces to the wars.  Throw back the lid, John, and drop the box
into the fire!"
<P>
A deafening roar, a fluff of bluish light, and the great square
tower rocked and trembled from its very foundations, swaying this
way and that like a reed in the wind.  Amazed and dizzy, the
defenders, clutching at the cracking parapets for support, saw
great stones, burning beams of wood, and mangled bodies hurtling
past them through the air.  When they staggered to their feet
once more, the whole keep had settled down upon one side, so that
they could scarce keep their footing upon the sloping platform.
Gazing over the edge, they looked down upon the horrible
destruction which had been caused by the explosion. For forty
yards round the portal the ground was black with writhing,
screaming figures, who struggled up and hurled themselves down
again, tossing this way and that, sightless, scorched, with fire
bursting from their tattered clothing.  Beyond this circle of
death their comrades, bewildered and amazed, cowered away from
this black tower and from these invincible men, who were most to
be dreaded when hope was furthest from their hearts.
<P>
"A sally, Du Guesclin, a sally!" cried Sir Nigel.  "By Saint
Paul! they are in two minds, and a bold rush may turn them." He
drew his sword as he spoke and darted down the winding stairs,
closely followed by his four comrades.  Ere he was at the first
floor, however, he threw up his arms and stopped.  "Mon Dieu!" he
said, "we are lost men!"
<P>
"What then?" cried those behind him.
<P>
"The wail hath fallen in, the stair is blocked, and the fire
still rages below.  By Saint Paul! friends, we have fought a very
honorable fight, and may say in all humbleness that we have done
our devoir, but I think that we may now go back to the Lady
Tiphaine and say our orisons, for we have played our parts in
this world, and it is time that we made ready for another."
<P>
The narrow pass was blocked by huge stones littered in wild
confusion over each other, with the blue choking smoke reeking up
through the crevices.  The explosion had blown in the wall and
cut off the only path by which they could descend.  Pent in, a
hundred feet from earth, with a furnace raging under them and a
ravening multitude all round who thirsted for their blood, it
seemed indeed as though no men had ever come through such peril
with their lives.  Slowly they made their way back to the summit,
but as they came out upon it the Lady Tiphaine darted forward and
caught her husband by the wrist.
<P>
"Bertrand," said she, "hush and listen!  I have heard the voices
of men all singing together in a strange tongue."
<P>
Breathless they stood and silent, but no sound came up to them,
save the roar of the flames and the clamor of their enemies.
<P>
"It cannot be, lady," said Du Guesclin.  "This night hath over
wrought you, and your senses play you false.  What men ere there
in this country who would sing in a strange tongue?"
<P>
"Hola!" yelled Aylward, leaping suddenly into the air with waving
hands and joyous face.  "I thought I heard it ere we went down,
and now I hear it again.  We are saved, comrades! By these ten
finger-bones, we are saved!  It is the marching song of the White
Company.  Hush!"
<P>
With upraised forefinger and slanting head, he stood listening.
Suddenly there came swelling up a deep-voiced, rollicking chorus
from somewhere out of the darkness.  Never did choice or dainty
ditty of Provence or Languedoc sound more sweetly in the ears
than did the rough-tongued Saxon to the six who strained their
ears from the blazing keep:
<P>
  We'll drink all together To the gray goose feather And the land
where the gray goose flew.
<P>
 "Ha, by my hilt!" shouted Aylward, "it is the dear old bow song
of the Company.  Here come two hundred as tight lads as ever
twirled a shaft over their thumbnails.  Hark to the dogs, how
lustily they sing!"
<P>
Nearer and clearer, swelling up out of the night, came the gay
marching lilt:
<P>
 What of the bow? The bow was made in England. Of true wood, of
yew wood, The wood of English bows; For men who are free  Love
the old yew-tree And the land where the yew tree grows.
<P>
 What of the men? The men were bred in England, The bowmen, the
yeomen, The lads of the dale and fell, Here's to you and to you,
To the hearts that are true, And the land where the true hearts
dwell.
<P>
"They sing very joyfully," said Du Guesclin, "as though they were
going to a festival."
<P>
"It is their wont when there is work to be done."
<P>
"By Saint Paul!" quoth Sir Nigel, "it is in my mind that they
come too late, for I cannot see how we are to come down from this
tower."
<P>
"There they come, the hearts of gold!" cried Aylward. "See, they
move out from the shadow, Now they cross the meadow.  They are on
the further side of the moat.  Hola camarades, hola! Johnston,
Eccles, Cooke, Harward, Bligh! Would ye see a fair lady and two
gallant knights done foully to death?"
<P>
"Who is there?" shouted a deep voice from below.  "Who is this
who speaks with an English tongue?"
<P>
"It is I, old lad.  It is Sam Aylward of the Company; and here is
your captain, Sir Nigel Loring, and four others, all laid out to
be grilled like an Easterling's herrings."
<P>
"Curse me if I did not think that it was the style of speech of
old Samkin Aylward," said the voice, amid a buzz from the ranks.
"Wherever there are knocks going there is Sammy in the heart of
it.  But who are these ill-faced rogues who block the path?  To
your kennels, canaille!  What! you dare look us in the eyes?  Out
swords, lads, and give them the flat of them!  Waste not your
shafts upon such runagate knaves."
<P>
There was little fight left in the peasants, however, still dazed
by the explosion, amazed at their own losses and disheartened by
the arrival of the disciplined archers.  In a very few minutes
they were in full flight for their brushwood homes, leaving the
morning sun to rise upon a blackened and blood-stained ruin,
where it had left the night before the magnificent castle of the
Seneschal of Auvergne.  Already the white lines in the east were
deepening into pink as the archers gathered round the keep and
took counsel how to rescue the survivors.
<P>
"Had we a rope," said Alleyne, "there is one side which is not
yet on fire, down which we might slip."
<P>
"But how to get a rope?"
<P>
"It is an old trick," quoth Aylward.  "Hola! Johnston, cast me up
a rope, even as you did at Maupertius in the war time."
<P>
The grizzled archer thus addressed took several lengths of rope
from his comrades, and knotting them firmly together, he
stretched them out in the long shadow which the rising sun threw
from the frowning keep.  Then he fixed the yew-stave of his bow
upon end and measured the long, thin, black line which it threw
upon the turf.
<P>
"A six-foot stave throws a twelve-foot shadow," he muttered. "The
keep throws a shadow of sixty paces.  Thirty paces of rope will
be enow and to spare.  Another strand, Watkin! Now pull at the
end that all may be safe.  So!  It is ready for them.'
<P>
"But how are they to reach it?" asked the young archer beside
him.
<P>
"Watch and see, young fool's-head," growled the old bowman. He
took a long string from his pouch and fastened one end to an
arrow.
<P>
"All ready, Samkin?"
<P>
"Ready, camarade."
<P>
"Close to your hand then."  With an easy pull he sent the shaft
flickering gently up, falling upon the stonework within a foot of
where Aylward was standing.  The other end was secured to the
rope, so that in a minute a good strong cord was dangling from
the only sound side of the blazing and shattered tower. The Lady
Tiphaine was lowered with a noose drawn fast under the arms, and
the other five slid swiftly down, amid the cheers and joyous
outcry of their rescuers.
