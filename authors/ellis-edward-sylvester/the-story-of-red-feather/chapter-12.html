<p>But for his solicitude for Dot Clarendon, Red Feather never would
have made the error he did, when waiting on the southern bank
of the Upper Crossing for the return of the pony which was to
carry them across to the waiting Melville on the other side.</p>

<p>The weather was still crisp and chilly, and, when he found himself
alone, he began carefully gathering the blanket around the precious
form, so, as to keep away all cold from her body. No mother could
have handled her more gently. His left arm remained immovable,
while his right fingered about her. He was quick to discover that
she was in a sound slumber&mdash;a pleasant proof of the success of
the grim warrior in the <em>role</em> of a soothing friend to
the imperilled little one.</p>

<p>Softly raising a corner of the blanket, he looked down in the
sweet face, which, though seen dimly, was as the face of an angel.
Pure and holy emotions were stirred in that dark heart as never
before that evening. He had parted his lips to utter something
in his own language, when he was sharply reminded of his remissness
by the clamp of horse's feet. Quickly replacing the blanket, he
looked behind him, and saw outlined against the glare of the burning
buildings the figures of six or eight horsemen, so close that
it was useless for him to think of hiding or getting away.</p>

<p>Red Feather made no attempt to do either; for, like most of his
people, he had a strong sense of dignity, which would have been
disturbed by such action. His chief regret was that the horsemen
had come upon him so suddenly that his action with the blanket
must have betrayed, or at least raised a suspicion of, the truth.
Had he but a minute's time, he would have gathered the covering
about the form in such a way that in the darkness he might have
kept secret the fact that he carried a small child in his arms.</p>

<p>His supposition was that these Indians were his own warriors;
and a curious meeting must follow between them and the chief whom
they thought dead, unless they had learned of his flight from
the house, in which event a troublesome explanation must be made
to them.</p>

<p>But the chief was pleased to observe that the men belonged to
still another band, that had come from the south-east on their
way to the Lower Crossing, in the hope of intercepting the settlers
and their families fleeing in the direction of Barwell.</p>

<p>To use a common expression, Red Feather decided to "take the
bull by the horns." He was well known and held in fear by all
the warriors. He said he had captured a small child, stepping
forward and parting the blanket enough for them to see her in
his arms, and adding that he meant to take her home to his own
wigwam as a present to his squaw. If the latter did not want her,
he would put her out of the way, or hold her for ransom.</p>

<p>Had the new-comers possessed the courage, they might have asked
Red Feather some troublesome questions, but they feared to rouse
his anger.</p>

<p>He tried to keep their attention away from the other shore; but
just then the glare from the burning buildings became so bright
that he failed, and not only was Saladin observed making his way
to that bank, but Melville was discovered as he rose to his feet.</p>

<p>Red Feather affected great surprise at the discovery, and offered
no objection when the three Sioux set out to capture the lad and
his valuable animal.</p>

<p>In the presence of these warriors Red Feather was his old, domineering,
ugly self. He spoke sharply, and finally ordered one of the horsemen
to dismount and give up his animal. He offered no theory to account
for the appearance of the boy on the other shore, or for the singular
fact that he was on foot himself.</p>

<p>The promptness with which his order was obeyed would have been
amusing under other circumstances. Red Feather took possession
of his property secured in this rather questionable manner, and
then calmly awaited the return of the three who had set out to
capture Melville and Saladin.</p>

<p>His fear was that the main party under Tall Bear might arrive
and complicate matters; for the chief had formed the conclusion
that the strange horsemen whose appearance allowed him to escape
so easily from the cabin were white men, and that the main band
of Sioux therefore had withdrawn.</p>

<p>By-and-by the warriors returned from the other side, with the
announcement that the lad had escaped, and it was useless to follow
him farther.</p>

<p>There was no chief with the smaller company, and Red Feather
told them that, since there was no chance of finding any settlers
in the neighborhood, they would ride back to their own villages,
which lay to the south-east.</p>

<p>The start was made, and the horsemen passed fully a mile in grim
silence. At the end of the mile he ordered them to keep the course
they were following, while he alone turned to the right in quest
of Tall Bear and his band of Muddy Creek Sioux.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Red Feather rode a short distance to the right,
and then, changing his course due north, struck the pony into
a gallop.</p>

<p>He was now heading toward the home of the Clarendons, where he
had met so many singular experiences during the earlier part of
the evening. He held Dot with such care that she continued sleeping
as sweetly as if lying in her own bed at home.</p>

<p>Never was Red Feather more cautious and skilful. Thoroughly trained
in woodcraft, and an adept in all the cunning of his people, he
used those gifts with success, and, though he approached close
to the party of Sioux which were hurrying away from the vengeance
of the white men, they never suspected the fact, and the meeting
was avoided.</p>

<p>Within the succeeding half-hour his listening ear caught the
neigh of a horse which had detected his own while the two were
invisible. Instantly the chieftain brought the pony to a standstill,
and peered and listened with all the acuteness he possessed.</p>

<p>The horsemen were coming that way, and would soon be in sight.
At the very moment their figures were beginning to outline themselves
he emitted a whistle, precisely the same as that used by Melville
Clarendon when he signaled to him from the Upper Crossing.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "The horseman were coming that way."]</p>

<p>As he did so he held his pony ready to send him flying over the
prairie at break-neck speed.</p>

<p>But his heart was thrilled almost in the same second by a reply,
which he knew came from no lips except those of the boy himself.</p>

<p>Yes; Melville had recognized the call, and sending back the reply,
he shouted&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's Red Feather! Come, father; I know he's got Dot!"</p>

<p>In a twinkling, as may be said, the chief found himself in the
middle of the band of Nat Trumbull and his rangers, where he was
overwhelmed with congratulations. Although Dot was asleep, her
father could not be restrained, and caught her in his arms and
pressed her to his heart with tears of joy and thanks to Heaven
for its mercy in restoring her to him unharmed.</p>

<p>It must be said that Dot was disposed to be cross at being awakened
in this summary fashion; but when her little brain came to understand
all that had taken place, and she saw that it was her own father
who was caressing her, she laughed and shouted, and wanted to
kiss and embrace every one of the party, who were just as much
pleased to fondle the child as though each had a proprietary interest
in her.</p>

<p>Since it was evident the Sioux could not be brought to book,
Nat Trumbull turned about and headed for Barwell, which the whole
party reached before the morning sun appeared. Red Feather kept
them company, and I must say that I doubt whether the President
of the United States himself could have received a warmer welcome
when the whole truth became known to the pioneers.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the Sioux was repressed before it had time to
assume serious proportions, and, inasmuch as every one who had
taken any part in it was anxious to clear himself, the leaders
envied the position of Red Feather, who had faced about so early
that no suspicion could attach to him. He was re-established in
the good graces of his people, and since that time has acted in
such a manner that no one will question his right to be considered
a good Indian.</p>
