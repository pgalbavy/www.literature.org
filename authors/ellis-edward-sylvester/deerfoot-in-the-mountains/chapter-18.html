<p>The force of the impact and the crushing weight of the Shawanoe's
body knocked Taggarak senseless for the moment. He lay panting,
with eyes half closed and his countenance glistening with moisture.</p>

<p>Deerfoot, without removing his knees, watched the eyes until
they slowly opened and glared upward with a dazed expression.
The youth had removed his fingers from the wrist of the chief.
He now bent his face close to his and asked:</p>

<p>"Who now is master&mdash;the Blackfoot or the Shawanoe? Whose God
is the greater &mdash;Taggarak's or Deerfoot's?"</p>

<p>But the chieftain was game. He had put up a hurricane fight and
had been conquered&mdash;conquered by a youth who carried no weapon
in his hand, and who could have driven out his life at any moment
during the progress of the battle. Instead of slaying his victim,
the Shawanoe had put one indignity after another upon him.</p>

<p>"Let the Shawanoe take his knife and kill Taggarak! He does not
wish to live!"</p>

<p>"So Taggarak would do with the Shawanoe, but so does not the
Shawanoe, for he is a Christian," replied Deerfoot, rising from
the prostrate body and stepping back for a couple of paces.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot was still bewildered. He lay motionless for a few
seconds, staring at the youth looking serenely down upon him.
The chief had been conquered, absolutely, crushingly and to the
last degree humiliatingly; for, most amazing thing of all, his
conqueror had refused to take his life, knowing that it would
have been the other way had the Shawanoe suffered defeat.</p>

<p>And he who showed this unheard-of mercy professed to be a Christian!
What a strange religion to make a warrior act in that manner!</p>

<p>Slowly the iron-limbed chieftain climbed to his feet. He was
not looking at the Shawanoe, who had folded his arms and was calmly
watching him. Taggarak stood upright, turned his face away, took
three steps and then paused. His head flirted about like a bird's
and he fixed his burning eyes upon the dusky youth, still posed
like a statue, with arms folded and on the alert for any treachery.</p>

<p>The Blackfoot gazed steadily into the eyes that met his own without
flinching. He did not speak, but, looking away again, strode solemnly
across the open space, not pausing to pick up his weapon, and
disappeared in the rocky wood.</p>

<p>Deerfoot remained motionless for several moments, gazing at the
point where the other had passed from sight. Then he reverently
turned his eyes upward and murmured:</p>

<p>"I thank Thee, my Heavenly Father. Thou art kinder to Deerfoot
than he deserves."</p>

<p>His next act was most peculiar. He paid no heed to the knife
of Taggarak, but picked up his own. It had a keen edge, and instead
of thrusting the weapon into his girdle he walked to the nearest
undergrowth and began cutting a stick several feet in length and
of nearly an inch's thickness at the butt.</p>

<p>About this time George and Victor Shelton, from their hiding
place, where they had stealthily watched everything, began to
feel disturbed in mind.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he is doing that for?" whispered Victor,
peeping around the corner of the rock.</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I know. He is trimming off the twigs, so as to
make the stick smooth."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose he saw us?"</p>

<p>"He couldn't. He has mighty sharp eyes, but he had no chance
to look anywhere except in the face of Taggarak, and we haven't
shown ourselves since he left."</p>

<p>"It's a queer performance anyway, and I don't feel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sh! He's looking this way."</p>

<p>The next moment both boys shivered, for, facing the rock which
until then they were certain had hid them from view, the Shawanoe
called:</p>

<p>"Let my brothers come here. Deerfoot wishes to speak to them."</p>

<p>"He saw us after all!" gasped Victor. "Let's run!"</p>

<p>"What good will that do? There's no getting away from him."</p>

<p>"He looks savage, George; he means business. Can't we combine
and lick him if he tries to play smart with us?"</p>

<p>"If we could get Mul-tal-la and three or four other Blackfeet
we might have a show; but it would take more than you and me to
down him. Come, it won't do to wait any longer."</p>

<p>The brothers were pretty well convinced of what was coming and
were scared. To Victor only one possible escape presented itself&mdash;that
was to conciliate the Shawanoe. The lad made a brave attempt to
do so.</p>

<p>Coming out from behind the rock, he strode rapidly down the gentle
slope, as if he had just recognized the youth. Victor's face was
aglow, and he certainly meant all he said:</p>

<p>"I tell you, Deerfoot, that was the greatest victory you ever
won! I don't believe the man ever lived that downed Taggarak,
and yet you did it without any weapon. People won't believe the
story, but you can refer them to us. Ain't it lucky, now, that
we happened to be where we could see you lay out that boasting
chief?"</p>

<p>George caught at the straw thus held out by his brother.</p>

<p>"I tell you that's so, Deerfoot. The news of this fight is bound
to get out sooner or later. Some who don't know you won't believe
anything of the kind, till we tell them we saw the whole business
and it was just as you say. Ain't you glad, Deerfoot, we happened
by chance to be where we could see it all?"</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had thrust his knife into his girdle and held the
switch firmly by its larger end. He looked gravely into the face
of each lad while he was speaking. When they ceased he had something
to say:</p>

<p>"When Deerfoot and his brothers left Woodvale was it not said
that the Shawanoe should rule and guide them?"</p>

<p>"There can't be any question of <em>that</em>," Victor promptly
replied.</p>

<p>"And my brothers promised to obey him in all things?"</p>

<p>"It seems to me I remember something of that kind."</p>

<p>"Has Deerfoot been a hard master?"</p>

<p>"We couldn't have had a kinder one. I tell you, Deerfoot, you
know more in five minutes than George and I know in a month, or
ever will know. We couldn't get along without you. We have been
pretty obedient, as a rule, haven't we?"</p>

<p>"Was not the agreement between Taggarak and Deerfoot that no
person should look upon the fight between them?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I don't believe Taggarak kept his promise."</p>

<p>Deerfoot flashed a look of inquiry at Victor.</p>

<p>"What does my brother mean by his words? Did he see any other
Blackfoot near?"</p>

<p>"Well, not exactly; but there were marks in the bushes which
looked as if made by moccasins. I shouldn't wonder if some were
hiding there and ran away when they saw us coming and knew we
meant to see you had fair play."</p>

<p>The appeal was wasted. Deerfoot took his station between the
brothers, moving them apart so they were separated by a space
of five or six feet. He then deliberately, vigorously and impartially
laid the switch over the shoulders of George and Victor. You would
not suspect the vim with which this disciplining was carried out.
Only the brothers themselves could testify feelingly as to that.</p>

<p>And the boys had to "grin and bear it," for there was no escape
for them. It was useless to run, and had they tried it they would
have been punished more severely. They were too proud to complain.
The quicker-tempered Victor wanted to revolt and attack the Shawanoe,
but he knew George would not join him, for such rebellion would
have been disastrous to them. They had tested the ability of Deerfoot
in that line too often to doubt his superiority. Had the shadow
of a doubt lingered, the scene they had witnessed a few minutes
before would have dispelled it.</p>

<p>The rod descended first upon the shoulders of Victor, then upon
those of George, and there was no difference in the force of the
blows. Oh, how they stung! Each boy wanted to scratch the smarting
parts, but grimly stood it out. Finally Victor ventured to say:</p>

<p>"When you are tired, Deerfoot, you have our permission to stop."</p>

<p>"Tired! He won't get tired in a week. Our only hope is that he
will use up all the switches in the country."</p>

<p>And the Shawanoe kept at it till the rod broke in the middle
and only the stump was left in his hand. He flung that aside,
and, without speaking, turned and walked toward the village. As
soon as his face was turned the boys devoted their efforts to
rubbing and scratching their arms, shoulders and backs.</p>

<p>"How many times do you think he struck us?" ruefully asked George.</p>

<p>"I guess about four thousand; but I forgot to count."</p>

<p>"He started in with you and ended with me, so we both got the
same. Gracious alive, but he knows his business!"</p>

<p>"Anyhow, what we saw was worth all we had to pay. I didn't think
he would do anything of the kind, did you?"</p>

<p>"No; I thought we might keep our visit a secret, but not many
things escape his eye. I suppose after all he was right."</p>

<p>"Wait till these smarts let up a little before you ask me to
say that," replied Victor, still rubbing and fidgeting about.
"Can't you think of some way of getting even with him?"</p>

<p>"I wish I could, but the worst thing anyone can do is to tackle
Deerfoot. We must try to believe we were lucky in getting off
as lightly as we did."</p>

<p>"Lightly!" sniffed Victor. "I should like to know what you call
<em>heavy</em> if that is light."</p>

<p>"And he is still mad at us. He went off without speaking, and
it may be days before he gets over his anger."</p>

<p>Bye and bye the smarts so subsided that the boys felt comparatively
comfortable. As they picked their way homeward their resentment
cooled, and they were able to see things in their proper light.
They profoundly loved and admired the young Shawanoe, and required
no one to remind them of his affection for them. The punishment
he had administered was like that of a father to a wayward child.
Moreover, it was well deserved, and they were willing to confess
the fact before they reached their tepee.</p>

<p>"There's no getting out of it," said the more impulsive Victor.
"He forbade us to follow him, and it was breaking the agreement
between him and Taggarak. The only thing for us to do when we
meet him again is to say we are sorry and ask his forgiveness.
I'm ready to do so. Are you, George?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't we try that on him before he gave us the whipping?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't have worked. When I saw him cutting and trimming
that switch I knew what was coming, and there was no way for us
to dodge it."</p>

<p>"It seems pretty hard, after a fellow has had his life almost
whaled out of him, to say he is sorry. It seems to me it's the
other chap who ought to feel sorry."</p>

<p>"No, we were in the wrong and must apologize. You know how tender-hearted
Deerfoot is. I believe he felt pity for Taggarak, even though
he knew the chief meant to kill him. The Blackfoot isn't the first
enemy Deerfoot has had at his mercy and then spared him."</p>

<p>When the boys reached their lodge, after meeting and greeting
a number of their dusky friends, they were disappointed not to
find Deerfoot there. He did not come in until late in the afternoon.
He raised the robe at the door, glanced at the brothers, but kept
his lips closed. Victor walked up to him without a moment's hesitation
and extended his hand:</p>

<p>"Deerfoot, you served us right. We are both sorry. Will you forgive
us?"</p>

<p>The two saw the moisture creep into the handsome dark eyes and
noted the tremor of the Shawanoe's voice as he took each hand
in turn and said:</p>

<p>"Yes, Deerfoot forgives you. We are brothers again."</p>
