<p>The visit to the city was imitated on the three succeeding evenings by
similar excursions.  On one night they returned to the plaza, and the
other two were spent in drifting down the harbor and along the coast on
King's yacht.  The President and Madame Alvarez were King's guests on
one of these moonlight excursions, and were saluted by the proper
number of guns, and their native band played on the forward deck.  Clay
felt that King held the centre of the stage for the time being, and
obliterated himself completely.  He thought of his own paddle-wheel
tug-boat that he had had painted and gilded in her honor, and smiled
grimly.
</p><p>MacWilliams approached him as he sat leaning back on the rail and
looking up, with the eye of a man who had served before the mast, at
the lacework of spars and rigging above him.  MacWilliams came toward
him on tiptoe and dropped carefully into a wicker chair. "There don't
seem to be any door-mats on this boat," he said. "In every other
respect she seems fitted out quite complete; all the latest magazines
and enamelled bathtubs, and Chinese waiter-boys with cock-tails up
their sleeves.  But there ought to be a mat at the top of each of those
stairways that hang over the side, otherwise some one is sure to soil
the deck.  Have you been down in the engine-room yet?" he asked. "Well,
don't go, then," he advised, solemnly.  "It will only make you feel
badly.  I have asked the Admiral if I can send those half-breed engine
drivers over to-morrow to show them what a clean engine-room looks
like.  I've just been talking to the chief.  His name's MacKenzie, and
I told him I was Scotch myself, and he said it 'was a greet pleesure'
to find a gentleman so well acquainted with the movements of machinery.
He thought I was one of King's friends, I guess, so I didn't tell him I
pulled a lever for a living myself.  I gave him a cigar though, and he
said, 'Thankee, sir,' and touched his cap to me."
</p><p>MacWilliams chuckled at the recollection, and crossed his legs
comfortably.  "One of King's cigars, too," he said.  "Real Havana; he
leaves them lying around loose in the cabin.  Have you had one?  Ted
Langham and I took about a box between us."
</p><p>Clay made no answer, and MacWilliams settled himself contentedly in the
great wicker chair and puffed grandly on a huge cigar.
</p><p>"It's demoralizing, isn't it?" he said at last.
</p><p>"What?" asked Clay, absently.
</p><p>"Oh, this associating with white people again, as we're doing now.  It
spoils you for tortillas and rice, doesn't it?  It's going to be great
fun while it lasts, but when they've all gone, and Ted's gone, too, and
the yacht's vanished, and we fall back to tramping around the plaza
twice a week, it won't be gay, will it?  No; it won't be gay.  We're
having the spree of our lives now, I guess, but there's going to be a
difference in the morning."
</p><p>"Oh, it's worth a headache, I think," said Clay, as he shrugged his
shoulders and walked away to find Miss Langham.
</p><p>The day set for the visit to the mines rose bright and clear.
MacWilliams had rigged out his single passenger-car with rugs and
cushions, and flags flew from its canvas top that flapped and billowed
in the wind of the slow-moving train.  Their observation-car, as
MacWilliams termed it, was placed in front of the locomotive, and they
were pushed gently along the narrow rails between forests of Manaca
palms, and through swamps and jungles, and at times over the limestone
formation along the coast, where the waves dashed as high as the
smokestack of the locomotive, covering the excursionists with a
sprinkling of white spray.  Thousands of land-crabs, painted red and
black and yellow, scrambled with a rattle like dead men's bones across
the rails to be crushed by the hundreds under the wheels of the
Juggernaut; great lizards ran from sunny rocks at the sound of their
approach, and a deer bounded across the tracks fifty feet in front of
the cow-catcher.  MacWilliams escorted Hope out into the cab of the
locomotive, and taught her how to increase and slacken the speed of the
engine, until she showed an unruly desire to throw the lever open
altogether and shoot them off the rails into the ocean beyond.
</p><p>Clay sat at the back of the car with Miss Langham, and told her and her
father of the difficulties with which young MacWilliams had had to
contend.  Miss Langham found her chief pleasure in noting the attention
which her father gave to all that Clay had to tell him.  Knowing her
father as she did, and being familiar with his manner toward other men,
she knew that he was treating Clay with unusual consideration.  And
this pleased her greatly, for it justified her own interest in him.
She regarded Clay as a discovery of her own, but she was glad to have
her opinion of him shared by others.
</p><p>Their coming was a great event in the history of the mines. Kirkland,
the foreman, and Chapman, who handled the dynamite, Weimer, the Consul,
and the native doctor, who cared for the fever-stricken and the
casualties, were all at the station to meet them in the whitest of
white duck and with a bunch of ponies to carry them on their tour of
inspection, and the village of mud-cabins and zinc-huts that stood
clear of the bare sunbaked earth on whitewashed wooden piles was as
clean as Clay's hundred policemen could sweep it.  Mr. Langham rode in
advance of the cavalcade, and the head of each of the different
departments took his turn in riding at his side, and explained what had
been done, and showed him the proud result.  The village was empty,
except for the families of the native workmen and the ownerless dogs,
the scavengers of the colony, that snarled and barked and ran leaping
in front of the ponies' heads.
</p><p>Rising abruptly above the zinc village, lay the first of the five great
hills, with its open front cut into great terraces, on which the men
clung like flies on the side of a wall, some of them in groups around
an opening, or in couples pounding a steel bar that a fellow-workman
turned in his bare hands, while others gathered about the panting
steam-drills that shook the solid rock with fierce, short blows, and
hid the men about them in a throbbing curtain of steam.  Self-important
little dummy-engines, dragging long trains of ore-cars, rolled and
rocked on the uneven surface of the ground, and swung around corners
with warning screeches of their whistles.  They could see, on peaks
outlined against the sky, the signal-men waving their red flags, and
then plunging down the mountain-side out of danger, as the earth
rumbled and shook and vomited out a shower of stones and rubbish into
the calm hot air.  It was a spectacle of desperate activity and
puzzling to the uninitiated, for it seemed to be scattered over an
unlimited extent, with no head nor direction, and with each man, or
each group of men, working alone, like rag-pickers on a heap of ashes.
</p><p>After the first half-hour of curious interest Miss Langham admitted to
herself that she was disappointed.  She confessed she had hoped that
Clay would explain the meaning of the mines to her, and act as her
escort over the mountains which he was blowing into pieces.
</p><p>But it was King, somewhat bored by the ceaseless noise and heat, and
her brother, incoherently enthusiastic, who rode at her side, while
Clay moved on in advance and seemed to have forgotten her existence.
She watched him pointing up at the openings in the mountains and down
at the ore-road, or stooping to pick up a piece of ore from the ground
in cowboy fashion, without leaving his saddle, and pounding it on the
pommel before he passed it to the others.  And, again, he would stand
for minutes at a time up to his boot-tops in the sliding waste, with
his bridle rein over his arm and his thumbs in his belt, listening to
what his lieutenants were saying, and glancing quickly from them to Mr.
Langham to see if he were following the technicalities of their speech.
All of the men who had welcomed the appearance of the women on their
arrival with such obvious delight and with so much embarrassment seemed
now as oblivious of their presence as Clay himself.
</p><p>Miss Langham pushed her horse up into the group beside Hope, who had
kept her pony close at Clay's side from the beginning; but she could
not make out what it was they were saying, and no one seemed to think
it necessary to explain.  She caught Clay's eye at last and smiled
brightly at him; but, after staring at her for fully a minute, until
Kirkland had finished speaking, she heard him say, "Yes, that's it
exactly; in open-face workings there is no other way," and so showed
her that he had not been even conscious of her presence.  But a few
minutes later she saw him look up at Hope, folding his arms across his
chest tightly and shaking his head.  "You see it was the only thing to
do," she heard him say, as though he were defending some course of
action, and as though Hope were one of those who must be convinced.
"If we had cut the opening on the first level, there was the danger of
the whole thing sinking in, so we had to begin to clear away at the top
and work down.  That's why I ordered the bucket-trolley.  As it turned
out, we saved money by it."
</p><p>Hope nodded her head slightly.  "That's what I told father when Ted
wrote us about it," she said; "but you haven't done it at Mount
Washington."
</p><p>"Oh, but it's like this, Miss--" Kirkland replied, eagerly. "It's
because Washington is a solider foundation.  We can cut openings all
over it and they won't cave, but this hill is most all rubbish; it's
the poorest stuff in the mines."
</p><p>Hope nodded her head again and crowded her pony on after the moving
group, but her sister and King did not follow.  King looked at her and
smiled.  "Hope is very enthusiastic," he said.  "Where did she pick it
up?"
</p><p>"Oh, she and father used to go over it in his study last winter after
Ted came down here," Miss Langham answered, with a touch of impatience
in her tone.  "Isn't there some place where we can go to get out of
this heat?"
</p><p>Weimer, the Consul, heard her and led her back to Kirkland's bungalow,
that hung like an eagle's nest from a projecting cliff. From its porch
they could look down the valley over the greater part of the mines, and
beyond to where the Caribbean Sea lay flashing in the heat.
</p><p>"I saw very few Americans down there, Weimer," said King.  "I thought
Clay had imported a lot of them."
</p><p>"About three hundred altogether, wild Irishmen and negroes," said the
Consul; "but we use the native soldiers chiefly.  They can stand the
climate better, and, besides," he added, "they act as a reserve in case
of trouble.  They are Mendoza's men, and Clay is trying to win them
away from him."
</p><p>"I don't understand," said King.
</p><p>Weimer looked around him and waited until Kirkland's servant had
deposited a tray full of bottles and glasses on a table near them, and
had departed.  "The talk is," he said, "that Alvarez means to proclaim
a dictatorship in his own favor before the spring elections.  You've
heard of that, haven't you?" King shook his head.
</p><p>"Oh, tell us about it," said Miss Langham; "I should so like to be in
plots and conspiracies."
</p><p>"Well, they're rather common down here," continued the Consul, "but
this one ought to interest you especially, Miss Langham, because it is
a woman who is at the head of it.  Madame Alvarez, you know, was the
Countess Manueleta Hernandez before her marriage.  She belongs to one
of the oldest families in Spain.  Alvarez married her in Madrid, when
he was Minister there, and when he returned to run for President, she
came with him.  She's a tremendously ambitious woman, and they do say
she wants to convert the republic into a monarchy, and make her husband
King, or, more properly speaking, make herself Queen.  Of course that's
absurd, but she is supposed to be plotting to turn Olancho into a sort
of dependency of Spain, as it was long ago, and that's why she is so
unpopular."
</p><p>"Indeed?" interrupted Miss Langham, "I did not know that she was
unpopular."
</p><p>"Oh, rather.  Why, her party is called the Royalist Party already, and
only a week before you came the Liberals plastered the city with
denunciatory placards against her, calling on the people to drive her
out of the country."
</p><p>"What cowards--to fight a woman!" exclaimed Miss Langham.
</p><p>"Well, she began it first, you see," said the Consul.
</p><p>"Who is the leader of the fight against her?" asked King.
</p><p>"General Mendoza; he is commander-in-chief and has the greater part of
the army with him, but the other candidate, old General Rojas, is the
popular choice and the best of the three. He is Vice-President now, and
if the people were ever given a fair chance to vote for the man they
want, he would unquestionably be the next President.  The mass of the
people are sick of revolutions.  They've had enough of them, but they
will have to go through another before long, and if it turns against
Dr. Alvarez, I'm afraid Mr. Langham will have hard work to hold these
mines.  You see, Mendoza has already threatened to seize the whole
plant and turn it into a Government monopoly."
</p><p>"And if the other one, General Rojas, gets into power, will he seize
the mines, too?"
</p><p>"No, he is honest, strange to relate," laughed Weimer, "but he won't
get in.  Alvarez will make himself dictator, or Mendoza will make
himself President.  That's why Clay treats the soldiers here so well.
He thinks he may need them against Mendoza.  You may be turning your
saluting-gun on the city yet, Commodore," he added, smiling, "or, what
is more likely, you'll need the yacht to take Miss Langham and the rest
of the family out of the country."
</p><p>King smiled and Miss Langham regarded Weimer with flattering interest.
"I've got a quick firing gun below decks," said King, "that I used in
the Malaysian Peninsula on a junkful of Black Flags, and I think I'll
have it brought up.  And there are about thirty of my men on the yacht
who wouldn't ask for their wages in a year if I'd let them go on shore
and mix up in a fight.  When do you suppose this--"
</p><p>A heavy step and the jingle of spurs on the bare floor of the bungalow
startled the conspirators, and they turned and gazed guiltily out at
the mountain-tops above them as Clay came hurrying out upon the porch.
</p><p>"They told me you were here," he said, speaking to Miss Langham.  "I'm
so sorry it tired you.  I should have remembered--it is a rough trip
when you're not used to it," he added, remorsefully.  "But I'm glad
Weimer was here to take care of you."
</p><p>"It was just a trifle hot and noisy," said Miss Langham, smiling
sweetly.  She put her hand to her forehead with an expression of
patient suffering.  "It made my head ache a little, but it was most
interesting."  She added, "You are certainly to be congratulated on
your work."
</p><p>Clay glanced at her doubtfully with a troubled look, and turned away
his eyes to the busy scene below him.  He was greatly hurt that she
should have cared so little, and indignant at himself for being so
unjust.  Why should he expect a woman to find interest in that hive of
noise and sweating energy?  But even as he stood arguing with himself
his eyes fell on a slight figure sitting erect and graceful on her
pony's back, her white habit soiled and stained red with the ore of the
mines, and green where it had crushed against the leaves.  She was
coming slowly up the trail with a body-guard of half a dozen men
crowding closely around her, telling her the difficulties of the work,
and explaining their successes, and eager for a share of her quick
sympathy.
</p><p>Clay's eyes fixed themselves on the picture, and he smiled at its
significance.  Miss Langham noticed the look, and glanced below to see
what it was that had so interested him, and then back at him again.  He
was still watching the approaching cavalcade intently, and smiling to
himself.  Miss Langham drew in her breath and raised her head and
shoulders quickly, like a deer that hears a footstep in the forest, and
when Hope presently stepped out upon the porch, she turned quickly
toward her, and regarded her steadily, as though she were a stranger to
her, and as though she were trying to see her with the eyes of one who
looked at her for the first time.
</p><p>"Hope!" she said, "do look at your dress!"
</p><p>Hope's face was glowing with the unusual exercise, and her eyes were
brilliant.  Her hair had slipped down beneath the visor of her helmet.
</p><p>"I am so tired--and so hungry."  She was laughing and looking directly
at Clay.  "It has been a wonderful thing to have seen," she said,
tugging at her heavy gauntlet, "and to have done," she added.  She
pulled off her glove and held out her hand to Clay, moist and scarred
with the pressure of the reins.
</p><p>"Thank you," she said, simply.
</p><p>The master of the mines took it with a quick rush of gratitude, and
looking into the girl's eyes, saw something there that startled him, so
that he glanced quickly past her at the circle of booted men grouped in
the door behind her.  They were each smiling in appreciation of the
tableau; her father and Ted, MacWilliams and Kirkland, and all the
others who had helped him. They seemed to envy, but not to grudge, the
whole credit which the girl had given to him.
</p><p>Clay thought, "Why could it not have been the other?"  But he said
aloud, "Thank YOU.  You have given me my reward."
</p><p>Miss Langham looked down impatiently into the valley below, and found
that it seemed more hot and noisy, and more grimy than before.
