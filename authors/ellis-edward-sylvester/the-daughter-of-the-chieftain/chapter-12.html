<p>The point, at last, had been reached where it was useless to
struggle any longer. The little party of fugitives, after safely
crossing the Susquehanna on the day of the battle, and penetrating
more than a score of miles on their way eastward to the Delaware,
were overtaken, and made captive by three Indians.</p>

<p>Warning Ben against any resistance, the mother bowed her head
in submission, and awaited her fate. Only once, when she clasped
her arm around the awed and silent Alice, laying the other affectionately
upon the shoulder of her brave son, did she speak&mdash;"Murmur not
at the will of Heaven."</p>

<p>The Seneca was surprised at the action, or, rather, want of action,
on the part of the captives. Receiving no response to his salutation,
he stood a moment in silence, and then emitted a tremulous whoop.
It was a signal for Red Wolf and the other Seneca. They understood
it, and hurried to the spot, with Linna close behind them.</p>

<p>It would have been expected that she would indulge in some outburst
when she saw how ill everything had gone; but, with one grieved
look, she went up to the sorrowing, weeping mother and buried
her head between her knees.</p>

<p>And then she did what no one of that party had ever before seen
her do&mdash;she sobbed with a breaking heart. The mother soothed her
as best she could, uttering words which she heard not.</p>

<p>Ben Ripley when the blow came, stood erect, and folded his arms.
His face was pale, but his lips were mute. Not even by look did
he ask for mercy from their captors.</p>

<p>In the midst of the impressive tableau, Linna suddenly raised
her head from the lap of the mother, her action and attitude showing
she had caught some sound which she recognized.</p>

<p>But everyone else in the party also noted it. It was a shrill,
penetrating whistle, ringing among the forest arches&mdash;a call which
she had heard many a time, and she could never mistake its meaning.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled through her tears, which wet her cheeks; but
she forgot everything but that signal.</p>

<p>"Dat Omas!&mdash;dat Omas&mdash;dat fader!" she exclaimed, springing to
her feet, trembling and aglow with excitement.</p>

<p>There was one among the three who, had his painted complexion
permitted, would have turned ashy pale. Red Wolf was afraid that
when the fearful Delaware warrior thundered down on them, he would
not give his brother time to explain matters before sinking his
tomahawk into his brain. Manifestly, therefore, but one course
was open for him, and he took it without a second's delay.</p>

<p>He fled for his life.</p>

<p>The Senecas, however, stood their ground. The signal of Omas
sounded again, and Linna answered it. Her father was near at hand,
and quickly came to view.</p>

<p>But, lo! he had a companion. It was To-wika, his faithful wife.</p>

<p>The reunion of the Delaware family was an extraordinary one.
Had no others been present, Linna would have bounded into the
arms of her mother, been pressed impulsively to her breast, and
then received the same fervent welcome from her father.</p>

<p>But never could anything like that take place before witnesses.</p>

<p>When the child saw her parents she walked gravely up to them,
having first done her utmost to remove the traces of tears, and
took her place by their side. The mother said something in her
native tongue, but it could not have been of much account, for
the child gave no reply.</p>

<p>Omas did not speak. One quick glance was bestowed upon his child,
and then he addressed himself to the work before him.</p>

<p>Omas was as cunning as a serpent. He would not have hesitated
to assail these two Senecas, for, truth to tell, he could never
feel much love for the conquerors of his people. He did not fear
them; but he saw the way to win his point without such tempestuous
violence.</p>

<p>His words, therefore, were calculated to soothe rather than irritate.
He asked them to explain how it was they were in charge of his
friends, and listened attentively while one of them answered his
inquiry.</p>

<p>Then, as is natural with his race, he recounted in somewhat extravagant
language his own deeds of the last few days. There is reason to
believe he gave himself credit for a number of exploits against
the palefaces of which he was innocent.</p>

<p>Then he said the only ones he loved among the palefaces were
the three there present&mdash;he had entrusted his only child to them,
and they had saved her from the anger of their people. He had
slept under their roof, and eaten of their bread. They were his
best friends; and they his brave Seneca brothers, when they knew
of this, would be glad. He had set out to conduct them to the
settlements, and his brothers would wish all a safe arrival there.</p>

<p>This speech, delivered with far more address than I am able to
give it, worked as a charm. Not the slightest reference was made
to the cowardly Red Wolf, though Omas knew all about him.</p>

<p>The Senecas were won by the words of the wily Delaware. They
indulged in the fiction of saying that they had no thought of
how matters stood between him and these palefaces, and their hearts
were glad to hear the words fall from his lips. They would not
harm his friends, and hoped they would reach in safety the settlement
for which they were looking.</p>

<p>Not only that, but they offered to go with them all the way.</p>

<p>This was too kind, and the offer was gratefully declined. Then
the Senecas withdrew, first returning Ben's rifle to him. Whether
they ever succeeded in overtaking Red Wolf cannot be known, and
it is of no moment.</p>

<p>The peril had burst over the heads of the little party like a
thundercloud; and now it had cleared, and all was sunshine again.</p>

<p>It was some minutes before the Ripleys could fully understand
the great good fortune that had come to them. Then their hearts
overflowed with thankfulness.</p>

<p>With her arms clasping her children Mrs. Ripley looked devoutly
upward, and murmured:</p>

<p>"I thank Thee, Heavenly Father, for Thy great mercy to me and
mine. Bless Omas and To-wika and Linna, and hold them for ever
in Thy precious keeping."</p>

<p>The events which had taken place were strange; but Mrs. Ripley
maintained, to the end of her life, that those which followed
were tenfold more remarkable.</p>

<p>You will remember that when Omas, after conducting the little
company some distance from Wyoming, showed a wish to leave them,
the good woman had no doubt what his purpose was: he wanted to
take part in further cruelties against the hapless settlers.</p>

<p>Omas had fought hard in the battle of July 3rd, 1778, and his
friendship for the Ripleys drew him away before the dreadful doings
were half completed. He yearned to go back and give rein to his
ferocity. Mrs. Ripley tried to restrain him, but in vain.</p>

<p>Such were her views; but she was in error. She did not read the
heart of the terrible warrior aright.</p>

<p>For weeks Omas had been sorely troubled in mind. He had visited
the Christian brethren of his own tribe at the Moravian settlement
of Gnadenhutten. He had listened to the talk of the missionaries,
and heard of One who, when He was reviled, reviled not again;
who, when He was smitten and spat upon, bore it meekly; and who
finally died on the cross, that the red men as well as the white
children might be saved.</p>

<p>All this was a great mystery to the Delaware. He could not grasp
the simple but sublime truths which lie at the foundation of Christianity.
But he longed to do so. At midnight he lay trying to sleep in
the silent woods, looking up at the stars and meditating on the
wonderful Being who had done all this. In the simplicity of his
nature, he talked to that awful and dimly comprehended Father
of all races and peoples, and asked Him to tell Omas what he should
say, and do, and think.</p>

<p>Unknown to him, To-wika his wife had listened to the teachings
of the missionaries, and she had traversed further along the path
of light than he.</p>

<p>When, therefore, he told her of his longings, his questionings,
his distress, his wretchedness, and his groping in the dark, she
was able to say a great deal that helped to clear away the fogs
and mists from his clouded brain.</p>

<p>But Omas was in the very depth of darkness, and almost despair,
when the fearful episode of Wyoming came. It was in desperation
he went into that conflict, as a man will sometimes do to escape,
as it were, from himself.</p>

<p>He fought like a demon, but he could not hush the still small
voice within his breast. He felt that he must have relief, or
he would do that which a wild Indian never does&mdash;make away with
himself.</p>

<p>It was on his tongue more than once, while threading his way
through the wilderness with his friends, to appeal to Mrs. Ripley;
but with a natural shrinking he held back, fearing that with his
broken words he could not make her understand his misery.</p>

<p>The only recourse was to go to To-wika, his wife. He had asked
her to talk further with the missionaries, and then to repeat
their words to him.</p>

<p>So it was that when he stole from the camp fire like a thief
in the night, it was not to return and take part in the scenes
of violence in which he had already been so prominent an actor,
but to do the very opposite.</p>

<p>It was a long tramp through the forest to his own wigwam, and
his people were aflame with excitement because of Wyoming; but
the warrior hardly paused night and day until he flung himself
at the feet of To-wika and begged that he might die.</p>

<p>From this remarkable woman Linna had inherited more mental strength
than from her iron hearted father. To-wika talked soothingly to
him, and for the first time in his blind groping he caught a glimmer
of light. The blessed Word which had brought comfort and happiness
to her is for all people and conditions, no matter how rude, how
ignorant, and how fallen.</p>

<p>But To-wika felt the need of human help. She had never met Mrs.
Ripley, but her husband had told of his welcome beneath that roof,
and of what she said to him about the Saviour and God, who was
so different from the Great Spirit of the red men. She knew this
woman was a Christian, and she asked her husband to lead her to
her.</p>

<p>He set out with her to overtake the little party who, with never
a thought of what was going on, were struggling through the gloomy
wilderness, beset by perils on every hand.</p>

<p>Since they were following no beaten path, except for a little
way, the most perfect woodcraft was necessary to find them. Omas
knew the direction they had taken, and calculated the time needed
to reach the Delaware. It was easy, too, to locate the camp where
he had parted from them, after which his wonderful skill enabled
him to keep the trail, along which he and his wife strode with
double the speed of the fugitives.</p>

<p>When he discovered that three warriors were doing the same, all
the old fire and wrath flamed up in his nature. The couple increased
the ardor of their pursuit. And yet, but for the favoring aid
of Heaven, they hardly could have come up at the crisis which
brought them all together.</p>

<p>Under the blest instruction of Mrs. Ripley, the doubts of Omas
finally vanished, never to return. The once mighty warrior, foremost
in battle and ferocity and courage, became the meek, humble follower
of the Saviour&mdash;triumphant in life, and doubly triumphant in death.</p>

<p>On the third day after the meeting in the woods, the party arrived
at the little town of Stroudsburg, on the Upper Delaware, none
having suffered the least harm. The skill of Omas kept them supplied
with food, and his familiarity with the route did much to lessen
the hardships which otherwise they would have suffered.</p>

<p>Omas stayed several weeks at this place with his friends, and
then he and his wife and little one joined the Christian settlement
of Gnadenhutten, where the couple finished their days.</p>

<p>After a time, when it became safe for the Ripleys to return to
Wyoming Valley, they took up their residence there once more,
and remained until the husband and father came back at the close
of the Revolution; and the happy family were reunited, thankful
that God had been so merciful to them and brought independence
to their beloved country.</p>

<p>Omas and To-wika and Linna were welcome visitors as long as the
lived. In truth, Linna survived them all. She married a chieftain
among her own people, and when she at last was gathered to her
final rest, she had almost reached the great age of a hundred
years.</p>
