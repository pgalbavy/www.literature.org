<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Scarcely had the dinner hour ended that evening when the hilarious
trio of younger girls, followed by the more sedate, but no less
eager older sisters, scurried down the long corridor toward the
den where the President had already intrenched himself, waiting
for the promised visit.</p>

<p>"Here we are, grandpa!" announced Allee, tumbling breathlessly
through the doorway and into the nearest chair. "We raced and
I beat."</p>

<p>"'Cause Cherry tripped me up," exploded Peace wrathfully. "It's
no fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Tut, tut, my children!" Dr. Campbell interposed. "No scrapping
allowed here. This is a home, not a kennel."</p>

<p>"Oh, we weren't scrapping," Peace hastily assured him, "but I'd
have won if Cherry hadn't got her feet mixed up with mine, so's
Allee got in ahead. I don't care, though. I can run the fastest
of the bunch outdoors. Jud says I'm a racer, all right. <em>Did</em>
I get the prize for talking the most this noon? Gail and Faith
and all of them think I ought to have it&mdash;that is, Allee and me.
We went together and saw the same things, though I did do all
the telling."</p>

<p>The President laughed. "Yes, I believe you and Allee won the
prize all right. Grandma thinks so, too, but that is just where
the hitch comes; because, you see, the prize was just to be your
choice of rooms upstairs, and with Peace in one room and Allee
in another, how are we going to settle the question as to who
has first choice?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that the winner can choose which of those three
bare rooms she wants for her very own?"</p>

<p>"That's it." His eyes twinkled merrily. Peace's untrammeled frankness
furnished him much amusement.</p>

<p>"Well, then, why is Allee going to be in one room and me in another?"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why&mdash;why&mdash;" stammered the learned Doctor, at loss to know
how to explain certain plans he and Mrs. Campbell had in mind.
"We thought it would be best to pair you off so one of you younger
girls roomed with one of the older sisters. Don't you?"</p>

<p>"No," was the emphatic reply. "It wouldn't do at all."</p>

<p>"Why not?" gently asked Mrs. Campbell, who had entered the room
so quietly that none of the girls was aware of her presence.</p>

<p>"Well, s'pose you paired us off 'cording to our looks," Peace
explained, without waiting for any of the sisters to register
objections; "there'd be Hope and Allee together, for they are
the lightest; and Gail and Cherry would have a room by themselves,
'cause they aren't either light or dark; and that would leave
Faith and me to each other, being the darkest of them all. Now,
Faith and me can't get along together two minutes. Ask Gail, ask
Hope. Any of them will tell you so. It ain't because we like to
fight, either. We just ain't made to suit each other, that's all.
Mother used to say there are lots of people in the world like
that, and the only way to get along is to make the best of it
and agree to disagree. But it would never do to put us in the
same room. That's too close. We don't like the same things, even.
Faith'd be cross 'cause I'd want to put my b'longings certain
places, and I'd get awful ugly if she took all the nice spots
for her things.</p>

<p>"Then, s'posing you paired us off by ages&mdash;the youngest with
the oldest, and the next youngest with the next oldest,&mdash;that
would still leave Faith and me together. It wouldn't do at all,
you see."</p>

<p>"How would you suggest dividing the rooms among you, then?" meekly
inquired the President, casting a comical look of resignation
at his puzzled wife.</p>

<p>"Put the ones of us together that get along the best. Allee and
me are chums, and Cherry and Hope, and Faith and Gail. Then we'd
all be suited and there wouldn't be any fussing&mdash;'nless it was
among the big girls."</p>

<p>The President coughed gently behind his hand, Mrs. Campbell bent
over to straighten an imaginary wrinkle in the rug at her feet,
while Gail and Hope were industriously studying a picture on the
wall. But Faith readily seconded Peace's proposition, saying heartily,
"What she says is true, grandpa. She and I can't seem to get along
together at all, though we do love each other dearly. We never
have been interested in the same things, and I don't believe we
ever will be. We have always paired off the way she says, and
get along famously that way."</p>

<p>"But how will you furnish the rooms that way?" wailed Mrs. Campbell
suddenly. "I had planned it all out&mdash;the blondes together, the
brunettes, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The blondes and brunettes?" repeated Cherry in bewilderment.</p>

<p>"Yes; fair-haired, blue-eyed people are blondes, while those
with dark hair and eyes are brunettes," Hope explained.</p>

<p>"It would be so much easier to carry out a color scheme in each
room if you girls were paired off according to looks," sighed
the woman in disappointment.</p>

<p>"Colors wouldn't amount to much if we fought all the time," murmured
Peace, trying hard to look cheerful even at the prospect of having
to room with the one sister she could not understand or agree
with.</p>

<p>"That's so," agreed the President, chasing away the disfiguring
frown on his forehead with a bright smile. "Besides, mother, the
girls may have altogether different plans for decorating their
rooms than &mdash;Well, Peace and Allee have first choice of room
then. Which shall it be?"</p>

<p>"The one with the teenty porch!" quickly responded the duet,
as though the matter had already been privately discussed.</p>

<p>"Aha, conspirators! Had your minds all made up, did you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandpa," Peace answered. "We have both slid down the pillar
into the garden&mdash;what was the garden&mdash;and clum up the trellis
as <em>easy</em>! Just think how much time we can save going in
and out that way instead of having to run clear down the hall
to the stairs every time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Peace!" screamed Mrs. Campbell in horror.</p>

<p>"Peace!" echoed the scandalized sisters.</p>

<p>But for a long moment the President only stared. Then he spoke.
"Now, see here, children, if you have that balcony room for your
own, you must promise one thing. Don't <em>ever</em> use the porch
pillars for a stairway again, either to get inside the house or
out. Do you understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes, grandpa," came the reluctant promise.</p>

<p>"You will not forget?"</p>

<p>"No, grandpa," with still more reluctance.</p>

<p>"If you do, you will forfeit that room, remember. Porch pillars
were never made for such purposes. They are not only hard on your
clothes, but think what would happen if you should slip and fall."</p>

<p>The whole group shuddered at this direful picture, and the chief
culprit snuggled closer to this newly found guardian, and whispered
contritely, "We didn't think of that before. We'll be good."</p>

<p>"That's my girlie! Now for the other matters we must consider.
When it was settled that you were to come here to live, mother
and I talked over plans for refurnishing the rooms you are to
occupy, but somehow we could not come to any satisfactory conclusions,
and finally decided it would be best and wisest to let you select
your own furniture and arrange it to suit yourselves."</p>

<p>"Whee!" interrupted Peace with a delighted little hop. "Won't
that be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't say 'bully'," implored Cherry.</p>

<p>"No, I won't. I'll say jolly. Won't that be jolly? Hooray!" Her
shout of joy ended in such a queer, shrill squeak that the little
company burst into a gale of laughter, and it was some minutes
before order was restored, but when at last the merriment had
subsided, each duet found themselves holding a small slip of paper
which quite took their breath away.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Allee, standing on tiptoe to get a better
view of the yellow scrap in Peace's hand, though she could not
read a word on it.</p>

<p>"Grandpa! Is it to furnish our rooms with?" cried Hope, impulsively
dropping a kiss on the tip of Mrs. Campbell's nose.</p>

<p>"Oh, you precious people!" whispered Gail tremulously. "It is
altogether too much. We ought not to spend all that just on our
rooms."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, my dearies," interposed Mrs. Campbell, beaming
benignly at the flushed, surprised faces of the six girls, "father
and I figured it all out carefully, and that is the amount we
decided upon as necessary for all the fixings you would want to
make you cosy. And you will find it won't go so far after all;
but I know you can trim up some very dainty, pretty rooms with
that amount. The beds we already had, so we left them there, but
all the other furniture has been removed to the attic or disposed
of in other ways, so you can follow your own inclinations in refurnishing
your boudoirs. That is why I was so anxious to have the blondes
together, but &mdash;I don't believe it will matter much. You
will find some way of getting around that."</p>

<p>"Of course they will, and the room that is fixed up the prettiest
a week from today will be presented with an appropriate picture,"
declared the President, hugely enjoying the pleasure and surprise
of his adopted family.</p>

<p>Silence for a breathless moment fell upon the eager group, then
with characteristic energy, Peace grabbed Allee's hand and started
for the door, saying, "Come on, sister, let's get to work right
away. We've got to win that picture to go with our porch." Just
at the threshold another thought occurred to her, and she faced
about with the remark, "Say, grandpa, do we have to spend <em>all</em>
this money for dec'rations?"</p>

<p>"No," he laughed. "If you can find anything in the attic which
you can use, take possession of it."</p>

<p>"And the money we don't spend is ours?"</p>

<p>For a fraction of a second he hesitated, wondering what scheme
was taking shape under the thatch of brown curls; then with a
twinkle in his eyes he answered, "Yes, I reckon it is."</p>

<p>"But, Donald," whispered Mrs. Campbell in his ear, "they are
too young to be intrusted with such a sum."</p>

<p>"Grandpa," Gail interrupted, looking thoughtfully at the check
which Faith was still studying curiously; "must we do this without
help from anyone else? Suppose we should all happen to choose
the same plan?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no danger of that at all because your tastes are
not all the same, so far as I can discover; but I think it might
be a good plan to consult with some older or more experienced
person&mdash;some one outside the family. Grandma and I are to be the
judges, you know; so it would not be fair for us to know beforehand
what you were intending to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, how splendid to have it all a secret from you two!" cried
Hope. "But who will help us?"</p>

<p>"We shall ask Frances Sherrar," announced Gail after a whispered
consultation with her room-mate. "She knows all about such things."</p>

<p>"Then let's us ask Mrs. Sherrar," suggested Cherry, anxious to
have as good authority to back them in their plans.</p>

<p>"That's a good idea," Hope conceded readily. "Whom shall you
choose, Peace?"</p>

<p>They all expected to hear her name Mrs. Strong, her patron saint,
but to their utter amazement she promptly retorted, "Gussie!"</p>

<p>"But, Peace," they protested, "Gussie won't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Gussie thinks just like I do about colors and such things. That's
why I chose her."</p>

<p>Nor could the sisters change her decision in the matter, but
as the time was short and there were many other affairs demanding
their attention, the girls soon forgot their concern over Gussie's
barbaric tastes, and Peace and Allee were left to their own devices.</p>

<p>For the next three days they spent their leisure moments in wandering
hand in hand about the house, looking very sober, and listening
anxiously to the sound of hammers in the rooms adjoining theirs.
Then a marked change came over them; there were many conferences
with Gussie in the kitchen; much prowling about the attic in secret,
and even two or three trips to the barn to interview Jud, the
man of all work. The sound of hammer and saw could be heard at
almost any hour of the day, hurried visits were made to the sewing-room
when no one else was in sight, and the pungent smell of paint
and paste filled the house.</p>

<p>But at last all three rooms were in spick-and-span order, and
the two judges were summoned to behold the result of the week's
labor. At the first door they halted, and the President turned
to his wife with a ludicrous grimace as he said, "Dora, I am afraid
I've got us into trouble. How in this wide world are we going
to be able to decide which is the prettiest room! And if it should
be easy to decide that question, how shall we ever make our peace
with the occupants of the other two? Oh, Dora!"</p>

<p>"Open the door!" clamored the laughing girls. "You should have
thought of these things before you made such a rash promise."
And they pressed about him so relentlessly that he was forced
to turn the knob and enter the first bower of loveliness.</p>

<p>It was indeed a bower, so refreshingly cool and beautiful with
its color scheme of pink and green and brown that it required
very little imagination to transport one into the heart of some
enchanted woods; and instinctively the four younger girls as well
as the judges burst into a long-drawn exclamation of wonder and
delight.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can smell the flowers," cried Hope, sniffing the air hungrily
as if expecting to find the woodland blossoms there.</p>

<p>"And hear the creek," added Peace.</p>

<p>"I suppose they have won the prize," sighed Cherry disconsolately,
while behind their backs Gail and Faith ecstatically hugged each
other.</p>

<p>"Don't decide the question until we have seen the other two,"
suggested Mrs. Campbell sagely, and the excited company flocked
eagerly into the next room.</p>

<p>Here everything was in blue and gold, even to the dainty curtains
at the windows. The walls were covered with a delicate blue paper,
dotted with sprays of cheerful goldenrod; the dresser and table
were decorated with blue silk scarfs embroidered with the same
flower; gilt-framed pictures hung upon the walls; and from the
head of each narrow, gilded bedstead floated soft draperies of
blue.</p>

<p>"Sky and sunshine," murmured Gail, quick to feel the perfect
harmony of the room. "Isn't it lovely?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and it is fully as pretty as ours," whispered Faith, "though
I like ours best."</p>

<p>"Now for the last," Cherry urged eagerly, well content with the
rapturous exclamations her room and Hope's had brought forth.
"This will have to be awfully good to beat the other two."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> awfully good," Peace informed her. "<em>I</em>
think it is the best."</p>

<p>"So do I!" "And I!" came the chorus of surprised voices as the
last door swung open and the beauties of the third chamber burst
upon their view.</p>

<p>"It makes me think of fire-crackers," Cherry pensively observed.</p>

<p>"Nobody but Peace would ever have thought of such a thing," Faith
put in.</p>

<p>"A regular Fourth of July room," stuttered the President when
he had recovered his voice enough to speak. "Girlies, how did
you do it?"</p>

<p>"Well," confessed Peace, meditatively chewing her finger in her
endeavor to appear modest in the midst of such unstinted praise,
"at first we didn't know what to do. The other girls kept talking
about 'propriate colors for their complexions. Faith is all <em>blunette</em>
and she looks best in pink. Hope is all blonde and blue is her
best color, while Gail and Cherry have <em>blunette</em> hair
and blonde eyes, and they chose yellow and green. I didn't know
it then, but that is what they did. Anyway, they talked about
the different colors till I thought we ought to have our rooms
fixed up in things that fitted us. That made it hard for Allee
and me, you see, 'cause she is all blonde and I'm all <em>blunette</em>.
To fit her, the room would have to be all blue, and to fit me
it would be all red. Gussie said it wasn't stylish to use red
and blue together any more, so we didn't know what to do until
one day when we were <em>rummelging</em> through the attic we
found heaps and heaps of perfectly whole bunting and two great,
big flags. That decided us to make a flag room of ours, and Gussie
said it was a <em>splen-did</em> idea. So that's how it happened.</p>

<p>"Allee and me'd rather sleep together so's we can talk when we
are awake, instead of having to holler our thoughts clear across
the room from one bed to the other whenever we want to talk secrets;
so we traded beds with Gussie. She said she was willing, and I
always did want that bird of a bed after I saw it in her room.
But the curtains wouldn't hang from its tail like I thought they
would, and we&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stole my Paris doll to hold 'em up with!" cried Cherry, spying
for the first time the beautiful waxen image dressed to represent
the Goddess of Liberty, which stood on a tiny mantel over the
quaint little bed, and held the bunting curtains in one hand.</p>

<p>"We <em>borrowed</em> it," Peace corrected. "We couldn't very
well <em>ask</em> you 'bout it without your teasing to know why,
and Allee and me didn't have a decent doll among us. Besides,
you never play with it any more, and like as not grandpa or some
other person that's got money will give us one of our own for
Christmas. Then you can have yours back again. I guess you can
wait that long, can't you? We wanted the walls striped with red
and white, but Gussie thought that would look too much like a
barber shop, so we just had white paper. It doesn't much matter,
for the flags cover most of that wall, and Martha and George&mdash;we
found them in the attic &mdash;Washington take up all the space
on that side under the eagle&mdash;we got that out of the glass case
that stands in the barn loft. We were going to see if we couldn't
find some rugs with flags in them, but Gussie said it wasn't nice
to <em>walk</em> on our country's flag, so we chose this red carpet
that used to be on this floor."</p>

<p>"But where did you get such cute, quaint furniture?" asked Faith
who was trying the white enameled chairs one after another.</p>

<p>"Oh, that all came from the attic, too. Didn't cost us anything.
It was a dull, ugly brown&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mother's mahogany set," whispered Mrs. Campbell to the amused
doctor standing at her side.</p>

<p>"&mdash;but a little white varnish made it just what we wanted."</p>

<p>"Did you do the painting?" asked Cherry, testing it with her
finger to see if it stuck.</p>

<p>"No; we tried, but it looked so streaked we thought we sure had
spoiled it. Gussie didn't have time to do a good job on it, either;
so we asked Jud to help us out, and he said he would if Gussie&mdash;"
There was a movement at the door, and the company glanced over
their shoulders just in time to see Gussie's dress whisk out of
sight down the hall. "&mdash;would give him a kiss. So you see we got
that work done dirt cheap, too. Altogether, we spent nine dollars
and ninety-one cents of the money grandpa gave us. Gussie kept
the list. That's what the paper and white paint and ribbons for
tying back our curtains&mdash;oh, yes, and the curtains themselves
came to. They are just dotted <em>Swish</em> and we got it at
a sale, so it didn't cost us much. Mrs. Grinnell says always watch
for sales, 'cause lots of bargains can be picked up that way,
and we remembered it this time. We spent the extra nine cents&mdash;to
make just an even ten dollars&mdash;for candy to treat Gussie and Jud,
seeing they wouldn't take any money for their work, but they didn't
eat it all; so Allee and me had the rest."</p>

<p>"Did you make the curtains yourselves?" asked Cherry, the inquisitive.</p>

<p>"Well, mostly. Gussie cut them for us, and I held them straight
in the machine while Allee made the pedal go. The seams ain't
<em>very</em> crooked, but sometimes the needle would hit a lump
in the pattern and teeter out around it, in spite of all I could
do. But the made-up curtains at the store cost lots more than
the raw cloth and weren't half so pretty, so Gussie said she'd
help us make our own. Didn't we do well?"</p>

<p>"You certainly did," was the unanimous verdict. "The prize is
yours."</p>

<p>"And children," said the President impressively, as they still
lingered in the quaintly furnished room; "I hope every time you
enter this door, the spirit of patriotism, the love of country,
will grow stronger and greater in your hearts."</p>

<p>"Yes, grandpa, I guess it will," answered Peace in all seriousness,
"'cause we'll always be thinking of the rest of that check money
which we've saved from dec'rating our room so's we could buy fire-crackers
and rockets for next Fourth of July."</p>
