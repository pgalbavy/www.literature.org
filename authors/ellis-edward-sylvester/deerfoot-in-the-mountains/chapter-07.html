<p>So Deerfoot the Shawanoe rode into the night, his heart aglow
with gratitude because of the success of his venture. Whirlwind
was his and he felt no misgiving over losing him again, and the
steed himself would fight against recapture.</p>

<p>The animal kept to a walk, for to go faster would have been imprudent
if not dangerous. He was not traveling over the course followed
by Deerfoot in threading his way to the Assiniboine camp. The
road was rough and strange to both horse and rider. All that the
youth knew of a certainty was that he was journeying southward.
He could tell that much by observing the stars that had served
him so often as a compass.</p>

<p>Nor was there any necessity for haste. It was impossible for
the Assiniboines to trail him until the sun appeared in the sky,
when Whirlwind would easily leave the fleetest of their ponies
out of sight. So no fear remained in the heart of the dusky youth.
Speaking now and then to the animal, patting his neck and shoulder,
or playfully pinching the glossy skin, he rode onward for several
hours. He was not in need of sleep, and Whirlwind had been given
nearly a whole day of rest. It was no task therefore for either
to maintain the journey.</p>

<p>Deerfoot's intention was to ride until midnight, when the two
would rest, resuming their journey at sunrise and pushing hard
until they reached the villages of the Blackfeet. It was late
when the stallion splashed through a small brook at the foot of
a ridge, where Deerfoot decided to dismount for the remainder
of the night. Slipping from the back of the horse he pressed his
ear to the earth, but heard nothing to cause him disquiet. If
the Assiniboines were hunting for him they were too far off to
cause concern.</p>

<p>While Deerfoot was thus employed, Whirlwind stood as motionless
as a statue, waiting for his commands. The Shawanoe was in the
act of rising to his feet when the steed emitted the slightest
possible sniff. He was looking toward the top of the ridge immediately
in front, standing like a pointer dog, with his ears pricked forward
and head high in air.</p>

<p>Glancing in the same direction, Deerfoot saw the figure of a
buck that had come up the other side of the ridge and halted on
the crest, as if he scented something amiss. He could not see
the two below him, but his own form was thrown into relief against
the starlit sky. The beautiful creature with the branching horns,
the delicate ears, the shapely head and body, looked as if stamped
in ink in the dim star-gleam.</p>

<p>Deerfoot touched the shoulder of Whirlwind as a warning for him
to keep still. The intelligent animal maintained his statue-like
pose, and the youth began stealing toward the buck, his cocked
rifle grasped with both hands and ready to bring to a level and
fire on the instant. The space between the two was fifty or sixty
yards, which would have been nothing by daylight. The youth wished
to decrease it as much as he could because of the darkness, so
as to run no risk of missing his aim.</p>

<p>It may not sound poetical, but it is only simple fact that with
the sight of the buck unconscious of his danger the dominant emotion
of the Shawanoe was a sense of ravening hunger. It was a long
time since he had partaken of food and his appetite was worthy
of Victor Shelton. He meant that that buck should fill the aching
void that vexed him.</p>

<p>A phantom gliding over the ground would have given out no more
noise than was made by the moccasins of the Shawanoe; but the
timid animal snuffed danger and wheeled to dash away. At the instant
of doing so, Deerfoot fired, sending the ball into the body just
back of a fore leg. The <em>cervus</em> species rarely or never
fall, even when stricken through the heart, knowing which, Deerfoot
dashed up the slope, knife in hand, and made after the wounded
buck, which could be heard threshing among the stones and underbrush.
He was still floundering and running when overtaken by the youth,
who quickly ended his suffering.</p>

<p>The next act of Deerfoot was to reload his rifle, after which
he cut a goodly piece from the side of the game and carried it
back to where Whirlwind was waiting. The venison was washed and
dressed, after which the youth groped about for fuel with which
to start a fire. This proved quite a task, but he succeeded after
a time, and then made one of the most substantial meals he had
eaten in a long while. When it was completed hardly a fragment
was left, and he felt he was provided for in the way of nourishment
for a day or two to come, though he saw no reason to fear any
such deprivation of food.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe could never forget his caution. While there was
little probability of any of the Assiniboines being in the neighborhood,
yet it was possible there were, and it might be they had observed
the twinkle of the fire he had kindled and then allowed to die
out. He remounted his horse and headed more to the westward, for
he had a long way to travel to reach the Blackfoot country on
the other side of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The youth was riding forward, glancing to the right and left,
on the lookout for a suitable place for camping, when he noticed
that while the ground over which he was passing was more level
than usual, a high ridge loomed up on the left, rising in some
places to a height of several hundred feet. After a time a similar
formation appeared on the right. This showed that he was passing
through a valley-like depression, but he had gone a comparatively
short distance when he observed that the two mountain ranges,
if such they might be considered, gradually converged. He turned
to the left and at the base of the ridge dismounted.</p>

<p>"Here we will stay for the rest of the night," he said to Whirlwind.
"Deerfoot feels that hard work is before us and it is wise to
save our strength."</p>

<p>Since there was no saddle or bridle to be taken from the stallion,
his master turned him loose, first kissing his nose and affectionately
patting his neck. The horse wandered off a few steps to spend
the hours by himself, while the youth laid his blanket on the
ground and wrapped himself in it. No water was near, nor was there
enough grass growing for Whirlwind to crop, but neither cared
for a little thing like that.</p>

<p>Deerfoot slept soundly till roused by the licking of his cheek
by his faithful friend, who was standing at his head and looking
down in his face as revealed in the dim morning light. The night
was gone and it had brought no alarm to either. Casting aside
the blanket, Deerfoot sprang to his feet and surveyed his surroundings.</p>

<p>That which first attracted his attention was the convergence
of the massive walls to the southeast. Less than half a mile away
they came within a hundred feet of each other, thus forming one
of the cañons that are common in mountainous countries. The question
which Deerfoot asked himself was whether it was probable the two
joined. If so, he was entering a pocket from which he would be
forced to withdraw. The middle of the valley showed that at certain
times, perhaps when the snows melted, a stream coursed its way
through the cañon, but the water came from the front and flowed
toward the horseman into the open country to the rear. Had it
taken the opposite course there would have been no hesitation
on his part, for he would have known that an outlet was in advance
through which Whirlwind could pass. On the other hand, it might
be that the ridges united and the torrent had its source in the
water which poured over the rocks at the head. If this proved
to be the fact, Deerfoot would be obliged to retreat and make
a change of course.</p>

<p>His belief was that the ridges did not join and it was therefore
prudent for him to go on. Two causes led him to this conclusion:
the ground was favorable for the hoofs of his horse, and the course
of the cañon was the direction he wished to follow. It was a small
matter anyway, for an hour or two loss of time could make no special
difference. He spoke to Whirlwind, who stepped off with his usual
proud stride. Now that daylight had come and the ground was inviting,
the steed of his own accord broke into an easy gallop, which his
rider did not check.</p>

<p>Arriving at the farthest point visible at the moment of starting,
Deerfoot found that though the walls drew somewhat closer they
did not meet for at least a half mile in front, where again a
change of course hid the actual truth. He was now following the
black, sandy bed of a stream, packed so hard that it gave an ideal
floor for a horse's hoofs.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe had not reached the turn in the cañon when he made
an alarming discovery. Looking to the rear he discovered fully
a dozen horsemen coming toward him on a walk. They were probably
a half mile off, and no doubt were pursuing him. He would not
have felt any misgiving but for the instant suspicion that these
Indians were Assiniboines and the other division of the party
from whom he had retaken Whirlwind. They must have recognized
the black stallion, and, if so, of course knew he had been captured
by the Nez Perce, as they supposed him to be. On no other supposition
could their action be explained.</p>

<p>Without checking his steed, Deerfoot turned and pointed his glass
at the red men. One glance was sufficient. They were Assiniboines,
and no doubt those for whom the other group were waiting in the
grove miles distant.</p>

<p>Where they had come from with such suddenness was more than the
Shawanoe could guess. It mattered naught since they were there,
and his situation was not only unpleasant, but likely to prove
dangerous. If the cañon closed he was fairly caught and would
have to make a desperate fight to extricate himself. If it was
open in front he had little to fear.</p>

<p>He spoke to Whirlwind, who instantly increased his speed. The
Assiniboines seemed to make no effort to lessen the distance between
themselves and the fugitive. This looked bad, for it indicated
that the Shawanoe was riding toward a shut door and would fall
into their power like ripe fruit shaken from a limb.</p>

<p>When Deerfoot reached the next curve in the cañon he perceived
that only a little way in front it curved again. He decided at
once to settle the doubt in his mind, for, if the cañon was a
blind one, every rod of advance added to his danger. The walls
drew steadily nearer and he began to fear that they really met
not far off. If obliged to turn back he should do so without further
delay.</p>

<p>Checking Whirlwind he slipped to the ground and ran to the side
of the ravine. He left his blanket on the back of the horse, and
leaned his rifle against the base of the rocks, up which he began
climbing with the nimbleness of a sailor ascending the rigging
of a ship. His intention was to reach the level ground above,
from which he could gain a view that would tell him whether it
was safe to go any farther into the cañon or whether he must make
instant retreat.</p>

<p>From the foot of the mountain wall to the top was fully forty
feet, and it was perpendicular all the way; but the face was so
rugged that he went up without trouble, only turning a little
to the right now and then to gain a better support for his hands
and feet. The stallion stood motionless and watching him with
what must have been wondering interest.</p>

<p>As he ascended Deerfoot glanced down the ravine and saw the Assiniboines
still coming with their horses on a walk. This pointed to the
probability that the Shawanoe had really entered a pocket and
his enemies saw no need of haste, since they felt sure of their
victim. And yet with all his acumen the Shawanoe erred in explaining
the deliberation of his pursuers.</p>

<p>At last the agile climber reached the upper edge of the ravine,
and it only remained for him to lift himself a foot farther to
gain the view which would reveal the truth of the situation. He
extended his hand upward to secure the grip that was to raise
his head above the level. As he did so he rested it on something
cold and soft, which he instantly recognized as a coiled rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Deerfoot shared the shivering disgust which nearly every person
feels for crawling reptiles. Nothing was so hideous to him as
the <em>crotalus</em>, and when he caught sight of one he rarely
allowed it to escape. An electric shock thrilled through him as
he snatched back his hand in time to avoid the sting, for the
snake must have been as much astonished as he by its disturbance.
In the horror of the contact the Shawanoe forgot everything else
for the instant, and letting go his hold, dropped to the bottom
of the gorge.</p>

<p>He realized his mishap the instant it took place and tried desperately
to seize some obstruction that would check his descent, but could
not do so. He struck the bottom of the cañon, landing on both
feet, with a twinge of pain that was like a dagger thrust in his
ankle.</p>

<p>But brief as was Deerfoot's descent, he had seen something terrifying
while it was going on. The rattlesnake so rudely disturbed as
it lay in coil (though it sometimes strikes when not in that position),
darted its gaping mouth at the hand which flashed out of its reach.
Strange as it may seem, it was lying on the very edge of the gorge,
so close indeed that the blow which struck vacancy carried it
over, and it came tumbling, looping and writhing after Deerfoot,
at whose feet it fell, bruised and stunned by the impact. Before
it could strike again he had seized his rifle and crushed out
its life.</p>

<p>The excitement of the moment sustained him, but with the blow
he sank to the ground as if shot through the heart. His left ankle
had been severely wrenched and could not support an ounce of his
weight. The pain was so intense that but for his iron will he
would have swooned. With wonderful pluck and self-control he carefully
raised himself and stood on the right foot, with the other leg
bent at the knee and its foot held clear of the ground. A red-hot
needle driven into and through the ankle could not have caused
more agony.</p>

<p>But though his face and compressed lips were pale, not a murmur
of complaint escaped him. Looking up at his steed he said, with
his old, winning smile:</p>

<p>"Will Whirlwind take care of Deerfoot, for he cannot take care
of himself?"</p>
