<p>When we reached the attorney's house the reality of feud conditions
gained corroboration from a hundred small details. Like Garvin's, it
stood in an area stripped of trees and undergrowth. It was a large cabin
of logs and to its original two rooms rambling additions had from time
to time been made. Everywhere a note of the poor and primitive stood out
in uncouth nakedness. The men of the guard were all impoverished
kinsmen, who lived like parasites upon the lawyer's strained and meager
bounty. Several of them slept on pallets in a loft gained by a ladder,
and others dwelt in near-by cabins. The room turned over to us served as
guest chamber and parlor, and here alone in the house was there any hint
of concession to appearances. Through the cracks of its uncarpeted floor
chilly gusts of wind swept upward, and sent us hovering quail-like as
close as possible to the stone hearth of the broad chimney place. A huge
four-post bed in one corner was decorated with stiff pillows upon which
purple paper showed through coverings of coarse lace; patches of
newspaper stopped the widest wall cracks. A cheap cottage organ stood at
one side and rush-bottomed chairs completed the furnishings. A small
cuddy-hole housed the attorney and his wife. His mother, an ancient
crone-like woman of withered, leathery face, and all her brood of
grandchildren slept in two beds in the large, murky room which also
accommodated dining table, cook stove and pantry accessories.
</p><p>One saw a profusion of firearms, and unlike the make-shift of less
important things these were modern and effective. Before lamp-lighting
came the barring of heavy shutters, and as time passed we grew
accustomed to other evidences of that caution which was daily routine
with these people living in a practical state of siege. We were fed, in
relays, by the flickering light of a coal-oil lamp. The women declined
to partake of food until we were through, and busied themselves
incessantly between stove and table. As we withdrew to the draughty room
which was ours for sleeping, but common ground until bedtime, the
retainers shuffled into the places about the table which we had just
vacated, for supper, eating, as suited henchmen, after their betters.
</p><p>We were not a merry party as we huddled in a semi-circle around the
hearth where the blaze burned our faces while the gusty air chilled our
backs. Weighborne and Marcus argued over an opened copy of Kentucky
Reports. The old woman, with a face shriveled like that of an aged
monkey, crouched in her chair and sucked with toothless gums at a clay
pipe.
</p><p>When an hour had thawed the shyness of the mountain folk into general
conversation and I had been forced to tell many traveler's tales, Marcus
arose and with a rough tenderness wrapped a shawl around the shivering
shoulders of the old woman.
</p><p>"My mother," he said with no note of apology, "has never been to
Louisville or traveled on a railroad train. She is afraid of accidents."
He turned and shouted into her deaf ear, "Mother, Mr. Deprayne here has
crossed the ocean. He's been to the Holy Land."
</p><p>The old woman lifted her wrinkled eyes and gazed at me, in wonderment.
</p><p>"Well, Prov-i-<u>dence</u>!" she exclaimed. It was her single contribution to
the evening's conversation.
</p><p>Once a dog barked, and with silent promptness two or three of the
younger men melted out into the night to reconnoiter.
</p><p>The visitor proved to be only a neighbor seeking to borrow some farm
implement and he announced himself from afar with proper assurance that
he came as a friend. We heard his voice drawing nearer and shouting:
"It's me. I'm a-comin' in."
</p><p>I was for the most part a listener, offering few contributions to the
talk. I was thinking of other matters, but before the evening came to an
end I had heard, in plain unvarnished recital, stories which began to
make the spirit of the vendetta comprehensible. I spoke of Curt Dawson
and asked our host for a biography. The mountain lawyer's rugged face
grew dark with feeling.
</p><p>"I have twice prosecuted him," he said bitterly. "And in the chain of
evidence I wove around him there was no weak link, but a conviction
would have been a personal defiance of Garvin. That required courage.
Each time the foreman of the panel came in with perjury on his lips and
reported 'not guilty.'" He paused and then went on. "When Keithley fell
in the court-house yard, and while the rifle smoke was still curling
from a jury-room window, I rushed into the place and I found this boy
there. He was wiping gun grease from his hands, and he testified that he
had heard the shot while passing and had come in to detect the assassin.
Of course, he was the murderer. He has other crimes of the same type to
his damnable discredit. He is Garvin's principal gun-fighter. Garvin has
never fired a shot in accomplishment of his crimes. His men have all
been slain by proxy. Curt Dawson has become so notorious that of late
Garvin has kept him as much as possible out of sight. I am a little
surprised that he mentioned Dawson's name to you. He has of late rather
pursued the policy of holding ostensibly aloof, and he might have
inferred that you would repeat the circumstances to me." Marcus rose and
paced the cabin floor for a few turns, then came back and took his seat
once more in the circle about the fire.
</p><p>"You mean," suggested Weighborne, "that the implication of Dawson was
coming too close to identifying the master hand?"
</p><p>The lawyer nodded. "It is well understood that Dawson is merely a part
of Garvin. That makes it unwise to give him great prominence. If he has
been called back it means something."
</p><p>"And you think that something is--?" Weighborne left the question
unfinished.
</p><p>"I think that when the buzzards come there is apt to be carrion." The
thin, close lips of the attorney closed tightly.
</p><p>"I have always understood that this man is to be my executioner some
day. Maybe the time is closer at hand than I anticipated."
</p><p>"Is this fellow totally illiterate or has he, like Garvin, a shrewd
knowledge of things?" I inquired.
</p><p>"He has had only scant and primary schooling, but he has learned a great
deal that is not in books. He has seen the outer world as a railroad
brakeman and when still a boy went to the Klondike.... Let me impress
this on you both. At any time you see him don't fail to tell me at once
the full particulars ... I had supposed him to be in Virginia. If he's
here now he will bear some watching."
</p><p>The two hours between early supper and early bedtime dragged along
tediously. The old woman sat dozing and nodding while two of the
retainers sang to the accompaniment of the cottage organ, strange songs,
half-folk lore, in weird, nasal voices that rose high and shrill. This
singing was without musical effect, for the mountaineer alters his voice
in song and unconsciously adopts the tradition of the Chinese stage,
achieving a thin falsetto. It was a relief when the men climbed their
ladder and our host bade us good-night.
</p><p>Early morning found me awake, but already someone had hospitably kindled
our fire, and when we went out on to the porch, where a tin basin and
gourd dipper supplied the only bathing facilities, a small tow-headed
boy was there before us with hot, water in a saucepan. The mountaineer
is averse to cold water and sparing with hot. It was presumed that we
shared this prejudice.
</p><p>Frost still hung thick on the stubble and the mists lingered in the
valleys when we climbed into our saddles and trailed out to inspect one
of the tracts in which we were interested.
</p><p>I was not a happy man nor one bearing a blithe spirit, for my own
discoveries crowded too closely and heavily on my heart, to be lightened
by the mere novelty of fresh surroundings. Yet even in my shadowed state
of mind, I could not help drinking in the splendidly unpolluted air with
deep breaths that made my lungs feel new. From frost-rimmed earth to
infinity it seemed to stretch in clean and filtered clarity. The
mountains were no longer ragged piles of chocolate and slate. The fresh
vigor of morning had folded them in the softening dyes of a dozen
inspiriting colors. Distance merged the leafless trees into veil-like
masses of dove browns and grays where shadows of violet lurked and
deepened. The woods wore a brave, if ragged, coat of russet and burgundy
and orange with a strong hint of that purple which is the proper garb of
kings and hills. As we rode along ridges we looked down into vast basins
of variegated country, rough but essentially beautiful. On the lips of
the young day was a silent bugle-call of color. Above and about us the
high-piled barriers of the mountains clambered steeply into space where
the sky was blue and tuneful.
</p><p>I understood why Marcus had so resentfully repudiated the suggestion of
turning his back on this country. I knew that a man whose eyes had first
opened on such scenes would not wish that their last gaze should be
exiled. Rough and hard as life among these peaks might be, there brooded
a spirit here which would make flight impossible. The roots of the
laurel would hold the native son planted where his life had come to bud
and leaf. The eagle's brood would not go down to seek the easy security
of prim orchards and smooth meadows.
</p><p>We rode sometimes for hours on end without seeing a cabin. Then we would
come upon a rude habitation of logs and pause to pass greetings with a
gaunt man in butternut brown, and would catch a glimpse of tow-headed
children and slatternly women.
</p><p>So civil were all these salutations; so at variance with any idea of
violence that the elaborate precautions of Marcus (the very fashion in
which we were now riding armed and <u>en cortège</u>) began to assume a
ludicrous grotesquerie.
</p><p>Of course, I argued with myself, the attorney knew his own country and I
did not, yet I was morally certain that Weighborne and I could have gone
about our business unescorted and as secure as though we were inspecting
suburban lots under the guidance of a real-estate dealer. I suggested
something of the sort to Marcus and his only response for the moment was
a grim smile. Then he patiently began to explain.
</p><p>"At this moment," he said, "Jim Garvin knows just where we are and just
what we're doing. We have spoken to three men. Of that three at least
two have notified the store of our passing. There is a 'phone at Chicken
Gizzard, you know."
</p><p>It seemed rather too exaggerated a system of espionage for probability.
</p><p>"And telephoning in this country," went on the attorney, "is not so
simple a matter as you might suppose. We have no general system and no
universal exchange. There are telephones or 'boxes' as they are locally
called, connecting three or four houses into separate groups. A
telephone message from my house to Lexington, for example, would have to
be repeated and relayed through a half-dozen 'boxes' before it reached
its destination."
</p><p>And yet during all that day's ride and all of the next three days there
was never, to my eye, an indication that any man interested himself in
our goings or comings. On the fourth day it was otherwise.
</p><p>We had covered some twenty-five or thirty miles since breakfast over
roads that were full of climbs and other places where there were no
roads at all. Our spent horses plodded wearily, though the sun hung
close enough over the western highlands to warn us that, unless we
increased our pace, we should be benighted.
</p><p>We were riding with our ever-present squad of gunmen and our road dipped
to the valley where we should cross that branch of Chicken Gizzard which
bounded the Marcus place at the back. We shook our jaded mounts into a
shambling trot and reached it at that hour which ushers in the short
November dusk. The woods were still and the bark of a belated squirrel
going home from forage broke the silence with a seeming of noisiness.
</p><p>The creek was shallow and fordable, but to reach the crossing it was
necessary to follow a dizzy bridle path steeply downward and in single
file, between thick growing saplings and laurel. Back of the mountains
the sky held a pale afterglow against which the higher timber sketched
itself starkly. The body of the woods was a dark mass out of which only
the white-barked sycamores showed themselves with any clearness of
individuality.
</p><p>Beyond the ribbon of water lay Marcus's rotting and weed-choked division
fence. The smoke from his chimney, and the glint at the crack of a
lighted window were visible a half-mile distant.
</p><p>Our front horses had splashed fetlock deep into the water and halted the
cavalcade to drink when a sudden staccato outbreak ripped the silence.
Three thin jets of rifle fire blinked out with acrid sharpness from the
laurel through which we had just come. The men who had ambushed us must
have lain so close to our passing line that we might almost have touched
them from our saddles as we rode down the declivity.
</p><p>There was instantly a confused, snorting, splashing stampede for the
cover of the opposite shore. I, who chanced to be riding third in line,
followed my two leaders and made the timber in safety. I slid from my
saddle and found refuge in a tangle of drift at the roots of a sycamore
which overhung the water. My armament was limited to an automatic
pistol, small enough for the pocket, and it hardly warranted intrusion
into a debate with repeating rifles. As chance would have it, just as
our cavalcade had halted, and the instant before the volley was fired, I
had half-turned in my saddle to gaze back, at the two-color effect of
the slate-gray hills and lemon sky. Every other face was looking
forward, and I alone saw a figure standing above, in the brief
illumination of a rifle flash. It was the figure of Curt Dawson. Those
of our party who found themselves in the rear and hampered, in their
escape, by the confusion ahead, dismounted in the stream and began
maneuvering to the opposite shore at an angle which gave them protection
behind the bodies of their mounts. As they came they fired with random
aim at the points from which had spurted the ambuscading fire. But over
the hill had settled a sudden and profound quiet. The darkness had
spoiled markmanship which was presumably selected for its efficiency.
</p><p>It appeared that every one had made the crossing unharmed, though for a
few minutes each man held to such concealment as he had attained and
there was no effort to reunite.
</p><p>At last, like disorganized partridges coming back to the covey, we
crawled out of our individual hiding-places and began collecting on the
trail-like path which went twisting up to the house. Some led their
horses and some, who like myself had been separated from their beasts,
came on foot.
</p><p>As we gathered without a sound the mountaineers were searching the
timber with wide eyes that contended against the darkness.
</p><p>Then came the startling outburst of a fresh volley. It was fired into
the group and fired from cover on the attorney's own property. I felt a
sensation not unlike a hornet sting in my left shoulder and clapped my
right hand against the spot. I did not fall. I even had a sense of
surprise at the comparative mildness and painlessness of the pang. I
heard some one fall heavily, but in the darkness it was impossible to
distinguish individuals. So close on the assassin's shots that they were
hardly distinguishable came the cracks of our own guns, and without
giving the concealed riflemen time to shift positions our men charged
into the ambush.
</p><p>Our policy was no longer one of retreat, but of attack. I saw a tall
youth plough his way through the thicket toward a clump of cedar which
had just belched fire, and having to do something, I followed at his
heels. The silence had given way now to the ripping of bushes and the
kicking up of dead leaves, and twice off at my side I heard the
pop-popping of rifles. I, following my guide, was crouching and slipping
from tree trunk to laurel bush and from laurel bush to boulder. Suddenly
a spurt of flame and a report burst out in our faces, and the song of a
bullet passing near made me duck my head. Then the man with me fired and
there was a groan from the front and the crash of a body falling into a
bush.
</p><p>Afterward (I suppose in a very few minutes) quiet settled again, except
for the treading of our men as they searched the timber. The assailants
were clearly driven off. My companion even ventured to bend down as we
returned and strike a match over the fallen body in the brush. As it
flared up, I recognized with a shock, the thin, saddened face of the
sockless man who had accosted us in the road, and whom our driver had
called Rat-Ankle. He now lay doubled in a shapeless heap, and dead.
</p><p>We already knew that the casualties had not been one-sided, and as my
companion and I regained the road among the first we saw that some one
still lay there, his horse standing quietly over him. A glance told me
that it was Weighborne. His bulky size even in that crumpled attitude
unmistakably proclaimed him. As we bent over him, we found that he was
unconscious but breathing, and we hoisted him up to an empty saddle,
where we held him as we made the trip to the house.
