When your plans are upset and all scattered about<br/>
Just make up your mind that you'll find a way out.

<p>Peter rabbit went straight over to the old stone wall on the
edge of the Old Orchard, lipperty-lipperty-lip so fast that it
didn't take him long to get there. But Chatterer the Red Squirrel
never feels really safe on the ground unless there is something
to climb close at hand, so he went a long way round by way of
the rail fence. He always did like to run along a rail fence,
and he wouldn't have minded it a bit this morning if he hadn't
been in such a hurry. It seemed to him that he never would get
there. But of course he did.</p>

<p>When he did get there, he found Peter Rabbit sitting on Johnny
Chuck's doorstep, staring down Johnny Chuck's long hall. "They're
asleep," said he, as Chatterer came up all out of breath. "I've
thumped and thumped and thumped, but it isn't the least bit of
use. They are asleep, and they'll stay asleep until Mistress Spring
arrives. I can't understand it at all. No, Sir, I can't understand
how anybody can be willing to miss this splendid cold weather."</p>

<p>Peter shook his head in a puzzled way and continued to stare
down the long empty hall. Of course he was talking about Johnny
and Polly Chuck, who had gone to sleep for the winter. That sleeping
business always puzzles Peter. It seems to him like a terrible
waste of time. But Chatterer had too much on his mind to waste
time wondering how other people could sleep all winter. He couldn't
himself, and now that he had been driven away from his own home
in the Green Forest by fear of Shadow the Weasel, he couldn't
waste a minute. He must find a new home and then spend every minute
of daytime laying up a new store of food for the days when everything
would be covered with snow.</p>

<p>Up and down the length of the stone wall he scampered, looking
for a place to make a home, but nothing suited him. You know he
likes best to make his home in a tree. He isn't like Striped Chipmunk,
who lives in the ground. Poor Chatterer! He just couldn't see
how he was going to live in the old stone wall. He sat on top
of a big stone to rest and think it over. He was discouraged.
Life didn't seem worth the living just then. He felt as if his
heart had gone way down to his toes. Just then his eyes saw something
that made his heart come up again with a great bound right where
it ought to be, and just then Peter Rabbit came hopping along.</p>

<p>"Have you found a new home yet?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Chatterer, "I think I have.</p>

<p>"That's good," replied Peter. "I was sure you would find one
over here. Where is it?"</p>

<p>Illustration: "Have you found a new home yet?" asked Peter.</p>

<p>Chatterer opened his mouth to tell Peter and then closed it with
a snap. He remembered just in time how hard it is for Peter to
keep a secret. If he should tell Peter, it would be just like
Peter to tell some one else without meaning to, and then it might
get back to Shadow the Weasel.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tell you now, Peter Rabbit," said he. "You
see, I don't want anybody to know where it is until I am sure
that it will do. But I'll tell you this much," he added, as he
saw how disappointed Peter looked, "I'm going to live right here."</p>

<p>Peter brightened up right away. You see, he thought that of course
Chatterer meant that he had found a hole in the old stone wall,
and he felt very sure that he could find it by keeping watch.
"That's good," he said again. "I'll come see you often. But watch
out for Black Pussy; her claws are very sharp. Now I think I'll
be going back to the Old Briar-patch."</p>

<p>"Don't tell where I am," called Chatterer.</p>
