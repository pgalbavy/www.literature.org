<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The Countess Hélène had taken her maid and gone to New York on
business for a day or two, leaving Valerie to amuse herself until
her return.</p>

<p>Which was no hardship for Valerie. The only difficulty lay in
there being too much to do.</p>

<p>In the first place she had become excellent friends with the
farmer and had persuaded him to delegate to her a number of his
duties. She had to collect the newly laid eggs, hunt up stolen
nests, inspect and feed the clucking, quacking, gobbling personnel
of the barnyard which came crowding to her clear-voiced call.</p>

<p>As for the cattle, she was rather timid about venturing to milk
since the Ogilvy's painful and undignified début as an amateur
Strephon.</p>

<p>However, she assisted at pasture call accompanied by a fat and
lazy collie; and she petted and salted the herd to her heart's
content.</p>

<p>Then there were books and magazines to be read, leisurely; and
hammocks to lie in, while her eyes watched the sky where clouds
sailed in snowy squadrons out of the breezy west.</p>

<p>And what happier company for her than her thoughts&mdash;what tenderer
companionship than her memories; what more absorbing fellowship
than the little busy intimate reflections that came swarming around
her, more exciting, more impetuous, more exquisitely disturbing
as the hurrying, sunny hours sped away and the first day of June
drew nigh?</p>

<p>She spent hours alone on the hill behind the house, lying full
length in the fragrant, wild grasses, looking across a green and
sunlit world toward Ashuelyn.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "And what happier company for her than her thoughts&mdash;what
tenderer companionship than her memories?"]</p>

<p>She had told him not to attempt to come to Estwich; and, though
she knew she had told him wisely, often and often there on her
breezy hilltop she wished that she hadn't&mdash;wished that he would
disregard her request&mdash;hoped he would&mdash;lay there, a dry grass
stem between her lips, thinking how it would be if, suddenly,
down there by&mdash;well, say down by that big oak, for example, a
figure should stroll into view along the sheep-path.... And at
first&mdash;just to prolong the tension&mdash;perhaps she wouldn't recognise
him&mdash;just for a moment. Then, suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>But she never got beyond that first blissful instant of recognition&mdash;the
expression of his face&mdash;his quick spring forward&mdash;and she, amazed,
rising to her feet and hastening forward to meet him. For she
never pictured herself as standing still to await the man she
loved.</p>

<p>When Hélène left, Valerie had the place to herself; and, without
any disloyalty to the little countess, she experienced a new pleasure
in the liberty of an indolence which exacted nothing of her.</p>

<p>She prowled around the library, luxuriously, dipping into inviting
volumes; she strolled at hazard from veranda to garden, from garden
to lawn, from lawn to farmyard.</p>

<p>About luncheon time she arrived at the house with her arms full
of scented peonies, and spent a long while selecting the receptacles
for them.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a deliciously lazy affair at which she felt at liberty
to take her own time; and she did so, scanning the morning paper,
which had just been delivered; making several bites of every cherry
and strawberry, and being good to the three cats with asparagus
ends and a saucer of chicken bouillon.</p>

<p>Later, reclining in the hammock, she mended a pair of brier-torn
stockings; and when that thrifty and praiseworthy task was finished,
she lay back and thought of Neville.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "She prowled around the library, luxuriously,
dipping into inviting volumes"]</p>

<p>But at what moment in any day was she ever entirely unconscious
of him? Besides, she could always think of him better&mdash;summon
him nearer&mdash;visualise him more clearly, when she was afield, the
blue sky above her, the green earth under foot, and companioned
only by memory.</p>

<p>So she went to her room, put on her stout little shoes and her
walking skirt; braided her hair and made of it a soft, light,
lustrous turban; and taking her dog-whip, ran down stairs.</p>

<p>The fat old collie came wagging up to the whistle, capered clumsily
as in duty bound; but before she had entirely traversed the chestnut
woods he basely deserted her and waddled back to the kitchen door
where a thoughtful cook and a succulent bone were combinations
not unknown.</p>

<p>Valerie missed him presently, and whistled; but the fat sybarite,
if within earshot, paid no attention; and she was left to swing
her dog-whip and stroll on alone.</p>

<p>Her direction lay along the most inviting by-roads and paths;
and she let chance direct her feet through this friendly, sunny
land where one little hill was as green as another, and one little
brook as clear and musical as another, and the dainty, ferny patches
of woodlands resembled one another.</p>

<p>It was a delight to scramble over stone walls; she adored lying
flat and wriggling under murderous barbed-wire, feeling the weeds
brush her face. When a brook was a little too wide to jump, it
was ecstasy to attempt it. She got both shoes wet and loved it.
Brambles plucked boldly at her skirt; wild forest blossoms timidly
summoned her aside to kneel and touch them, but to let them live;
squirrels threatened her and rushed madly up and down trees defying
her; a redstart in vermilion and black, fussed about her where
she sat, closing and spreading its ornamental tail for somebody's
benefit&mdash;perhaps for hers.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Miss West!' he exclaimed. 'How on earth did
you ever find your way into my woods?'"]</p>

<p>She was not tired; she did not suppose that she had wandered
very far, but, glancing at her watch, she was surprised to find
how late it was. And she decided to return.</p>

<p>After she had been deciding to return for about an hour it annoyed
her to find that she could not get clear of the woods. It seemed
preposterous; the woods could not be very extensive. As for being
actually lost it seemed too absurd. Life is largely composed of
absurdities.</p>

<p>There was one direction which she had not tried, and it lay along
a bridle path, but whether north or south or east or west she
was utterly unable to determine. She felt quite certain that Estwich
could not lie either way along that bridle-path which stretched
almost a straight, dark way under the trees as far as she could
see.</p>

<p>Vexed, yet amused, at her own stupid plight, she was standing
in the road, trying to make up her mind to try it, when, far down
the vista, a horseman appeared, coming on at a leisurely canter;
and with a sigh of relief she saw her troubles already at an end.</p>

<p>He drew bridle abreast of her, stared, sprang from his saddle
and, cap in hand, came up to her holding out his hand:</p>

<p>"Miss West!" he exclaimed. "How on earth did you ever find your
way into my woods?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Mr. Cardemon," she said, thankful to encounter
even him in her dilemma. "I must have walked a great deal farther
than I meant to."</p>

<p>"You've walked at least five miles if you came by road; and nobody
knows how far if you came across country," he said, staring at
her out of his slightly prominent eyes.</p>

<p>"I did come across country. And if you will be kind enough to
start me toward home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean to <em>walk</em> back!"</p>

<p>"Of course I do."</p>

<p>"I won't permit it!" he exclaimed. "It's only a little way across
to the house and we'll just step over and I'll have a car brought
around for you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, I am not tired&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You are on my land, therefore you are my guest," he insisted.
"I am not going to let you go back on foot&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Cardemon, if you please, I very much prefer to return in
my own way."</p>

<p>"What an obstinate girl you are!" he said, with his uncertain
laugh, which never came until he had prejudged its effect on the
situation; but the puffy flesh above his white riding-stock behind
his lobeless ears reddened, and a slow, thickish colour came into
his face and remained under the thick skin.</p>

<p>"If you won't let me send you back in a car," he said, "you at
least won't refuse a glass of sherry and a biscuit&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you &mdash;I haven't time&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My housekeeper, Mrs. Munn, is on the premises," he persisted.</p>

<p>"You are very kind, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't turn a man down so mercilessly, Miss West!"</p>

<p>"You are exceedingly amiable," she repeated, "but I must go at
once."</p>

<p>He switched the weeds with his crop, then the uncertain laugh
came:</p>

<p>"I'll show you a short cut," he said. His prominent eyes rested
on her, passed over her from head to foot, then wandered askance
over the young woodland.</p>

<p>"In which direction lies Estwich?" she asked, lifting her gaze
to meet his eyes; but they avoided her as he answered, busy fumbling
with a girth that required no adjustment:</p>

<p>"Over yonder,"&mdash;making a slight movement with his head. Then
taking his horse by the head he said heartily:</p>

<p>"Awfully sorry you won't accept my hospitality; but if you won't
you won't, and we'll try to find a short cut."</p>

<p>He led his horse out of the path straight ahead through the woods,
and she walked beside him.</p>

<p>"Of course you know the way, Mr. Cardemon?" she said pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I ought to&mdash;unless the undergrowth has changed the looks of
things since I've been through."</p>

<p>"How long is it since you've been through?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't just recollect," he said carelessly. "I guess it
will be all right."</p>

<p>For a while they walked steadily forward among the trees; he
talking to her with a frank and detached amiability, asking about
the people at Estwich, interested to hear that the small house-party
had disintegrated, surprised to learn that the countess had gone
to town.</p>

<p>"Are you entirely alone in the house?" he asked; and his eyes
seemed to protrude a little more than usual.</p>

<p>"Entirely," she said carelessly; "except for Binns and his wife
and the servants."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you 'phone a fellow to stop over to lunch?" he asked,
suddenly assuming a jovial manner which their acquaintance did
not warrant. "We country folk don't stand on ceremony you know."</p>

<p>"I did not know it," she said quietly.</p>

<p>His bold gaze rested on her again; again the uncertain laugh
followed:</p>

<p>"If you'd ask me to dine with you to-night I'd take it as a charming
concession to our native informality. What do you say, Miss West?"</p>

<p>She forced a smile, making a sign of negation with her head,
but he began to press her until his importunities and his short,
abrupt laughter embarrassed her.</p>

<p>"I couldn't ask anybody without permission from my hostess,"
she said, striving to maintain the light, careless tone which
his changing manner toward her made more difficult for her.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, Miss West!" he said in a loud humorous voice; "don't
pass me the prunes and prisms but be a good little sport and let
a fellow come over to see you! You never did give me half a chance
to know you, but you're hands across the table with that Ogilvy
artist and José Querida&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've known them rather longer than I have you, Mr. Cardemon."</p>

<p>"That's my handicap! I'm not squealing. All I want is to start
in the race&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What race?" she asked coolly, turning on him a level gaze that,
in spite of her, she could not maintain under the stare with which
he returned it. And again the slight uneasiness crept over her
and involuntarily she looked around her at the woods.</p>

<p>"How far is it now?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"Are you tired?"</p>

<p>"No. But I'm anxious to get back. Could you tell me how near
to some road we are?"</p>

<p>He halted and looked around; she watched him anxiously as he
tossed his bridle over his horse's neck and walked forward into
a little glade where the late rays of the sun struck ruddy and
warm on the dry grass.</p>

<p>"That's singular," he said as she went forward into the open
where he stood; "I don't seem to remember this place."</p>

<p>"But you know about where we are, don't you?" she asked, resolutely
suppressing the growing uneasiness and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Well &mdash;I am not perfectly certain." He kept his eyes off
her while he spoke; but when she also turned and gazed helplessly
at the woods encircling her, his glance stole toward her.</p>

<p>"You're not scared, are you?" he asked, and then laughed abruptly.</p>

<p>"Not in the slightest."</p>

<p>"Sure! You're a perfectly good sport.... I'll tell you &mdash;I'll
leave my horse for one of my men to hunt up later, and we'll start
off together on a good old-fashioned hike! Are you game?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;if I only knew&mdash;if you were perfectly sure how to get to
the edge of the woods. I don't see how you <em>can</em> be lost
in your own woods&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't believe I am!" he said, laughing violently. "The Estwich
road <em>must</em> be over in that direction. Come ahead, Miss
West; the birds can cover us up if worst comes to worst!"</p>

<p>She went with him, entering the thicker growth with a quick,
vigorous little stride as though energy and rapidity of motion
could subdue the misgiving that threatened to frighten her sooner
or later.</p>

<p>Over logs, boulders, gulleys, she swung forward, he supporting
her from time to time in spite of her hasty assurance that she
did not require aid.</p>

<p>Once, before she could prevent it, he grasped her and fairly
swung her across a gulley; and again, as she gathered herself
to jump, his powerful arm slipped around her body and he lowered
her to the moss below, leaving her with red cheeks and a rapid
heart to climb the laurel-choked ravine beside him.</p>

<p>It was breathless work; again and again, before she could prevent
it, he forced his assistance on her; and in the abrupt, almost
rough contact there was something that began at last to terrify
her&mdash;weaken her&mdash;so that, at the top of the slope, she caught
breathless at a tree and leaned against the trunk for a moment,
closing her eyes.</p>

<p>"You poor little girl," he breathed close to her ear; and as
her startled eyes flew open, he drew her into his arms.</p>

<p>For a second his congested face and prominent, pale eyes swam
before her; then with a convulsive gasp she wrenched herself partly
free and strained away from his grasp, panting.</p>

<p>"Let me go, Mr. Cardemon!"</p>

<p>"Look here, Valerie, you know I'm crazy about you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you let me go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, come, little girl, I know who you are, all right! Be a good
little sport and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me go," she whispered between her teeth. Then his red, perspiring
features&mdash;the prominent eyes and loose mouth drew nearer&mdash;nearer&mdash;and
she struck blindly at the face with her dog-whip&mdash;twice with the
lash and once with the stag-horn handle. And the next instant
she was running.</p>

<p>He caught her at the foot of the slope; she saw blood on his
cheek and puffy welts striping his distorted features, strove
to strike him again, but felt her arm powerless in his grasp.</p>

<p>"Are you mad!" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Mad about <em>you</em>! For God's sake listen to me, Valerie!
Batter me, tear me to pieces&mdash;and I won't care, if you'll listen
to me a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>She struggled silently, fiercely, to use her whip, to wrench
herself free.</p>

<p>"I tell you I love you!" he said; "I'd go through hell for you.
You've got to listen&mdash;you've got to <em>know</em>&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You coward!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you say to me if you'll listen a moment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As Rita Tevis listened to you!" she said, white to the lips&mdash;"you
murderer of souls!" And, as his grasp relaxed for a second, she
tore her arm free, sprang forward and slashed him across the mouth
with the lash.</p>

<p>Behind her she heard his sharp cry of pain, heard him staggering
about in the underbrush. Terror winged her feet and she fairly
flew along the open ridge and down through the dead leaves across
a soft, green, marshy hollow, hearing him somewhere in the woods
behind her, coming on at a heavy run.</p>

<p>For a long time she ran; and suddenly collapsed, falling in a
huddled desperate heap, her slender hands catching at her throat.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill she saw him striding hither and thither,
examining the soft forest soil or halting to listen&mdash;then as though
scourged into action, running aimlessly toward where she lay,
casting about on every side like a burly dog at fault.</p>

<p>Once, when he stood not very far away, and she had hidden her
face in her arms, trembling like a doomed thing&mdash;she heard him
call to her&mdash;heard the cry burst from him as though in agony:</p>

<p>"Valerie, don't be afraid! I was crazy to touch you; &mdash;I'll
let you cut me to pieces if you'll only answer me."</p>

<p>And again he shouted, in a voice made thin by fright: "For God's
sake, Valerie, think of <em>me</em> for a moment. Don't run off
like that and let people know what's happened to you!"</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, his heavy, hurried tread resounded; and he
must have run very near to where she crouched, because she could
hear him whimpering in his fear; but he ran on past where she
lay, calling to her at intervals, until his frightened voice sounded
at a distance and she could scarcely hear the rustle of the dead
leaves under his hurrying tread.</p>

<p>Even then terror held her chained, breathing fast like a wounded
thing, eyes bright with the insanity of her fear. She lay flat
in the leaves, not stirring.</p>

<p>The last red sunbeams slanted through the woods, painting tree
trunks crimson and running in fiery furrows through, the dead
leaves; the sky faded to rose-colour, to mauve; faintly a star
shone.</p>

<p>For a long time now nothing had stirred in the woodland silence.
And, as the star glimmered brighter through the branches, she
shivered, moved, lay listening, then crawled a little way. Every
sound that she made was a terror to her, every heart beat seemed
to burst the silence.</p>

<p>It was dusk when she crept out at last into a stony road, dragging
her limbs; a fine mist had settled over the fields; the air grew
keener. Somewhere in the darkness cow-bells tinkled; overhead,
through the damp sheet of fog, the veiled stars were still shining.</p>

<p>Her senses were not perfectly clear; she remembered falling once
or twice&mdash;remembered seeing the granite posts and iron gates of
a drive, and that lighted windows were shining dimly somewhere
beyond. And she crept toward them, still stupid with exhaustion
and fright. Then she was aware of people, dim shapes in the darkness&mdash;of
a dog barking&mdash;of voices, a quick movement in the dusk&mdash;of a woman's
startled exclamation.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard Neville's voice&mdash;and a door opened, flooding
her with yellow light where she stood swaying, dazed, deathly
pale.</p>

<p>"Louis!" she said.</p>

<p>He sprang to her, caught her in his arms</p>

<p>"Good God! What is the matter?"</p>

<p>She rested against him, her eyes listlessly watching the people
swiftly gathering in the dazzling light.</p>

<p>"Where in the world&mdash;how did you get here!&mdash;where have you been&mdash;"
His stammered words made him incoherent as he caught sight of
the mud and dust on her torn waist and skirt.</p>

<p>Her eyes had closed a moment; they opened now with an effort.
Once more she looked blindly at the people clustering around her&mdash;recognised
his sister and Stephanie&mdash;divined that it was his mother who stood
gazing at her in pallid consternation&mdash;summoned every atom of
her courage to spare him the insult which a man's world had offered
to her&mdash;found strength to ignore it so that no shadow of the outrage
should fall through her upon him or upon those nearest to him.</p>

<p>"I lost my way," she said. Her white lips tried to smile; she
strove to stand upright, alone; caught mechanically at his arm,
the fixed smile still stamped on her lips. "I am sorry to&mdash;disturb
anybody.... I was lost&mdash;and it grew dark.... I don't know my way&mdash;very
well&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned, conscious of some one's arm supporting her; and Stephanie
said, in a low, pitiful voice:</p>

<p>"Lean back on me. You must let me help you to the house."</p>

<p>"Thank you &mdash;I won't go in.... If I could rest&mdash;a moment&mdash;perhaps
somebody &mdash;Mr. Neville&mdash;would help me to get home again&mdash;"</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Dearest,' he whispered, putting his arm around
her, 'you must come with us'"]</p>

<p>"Come with me, Miss West," whispered Stephanie, "I <em>want</em>
you. Will you come to my room with me for a little while?"</p>

<p>She looked into Stephanie's eyes, turned and looked at Neville.</p>

<p>"Dearest," he whispered, putting his arm around her, "you must
come with us."</p>

<p>She nodded and moved forward, steadily, between them both, and
entered the house, head-carried high on the slender neck, but
her face was colourless under the dark masses of her loosened
hair, and she swayed at the foot of the stairs, reaching out blindly
at nothing&mdash;falling forward.</p>

<p>It was a dead weight that Neville bore into Stephanie's room.
When his mother turned him out and closed the door behind him
he stood stupidly about until his sister, who had gone into the
room, opened the door and bade him telephone for Dr. Ogilvy.</p>

<p>"What has happened to her?" he asked, as though dazed.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I think you'd better tell Quinn to bring around
the car and go for Dr. Ogilvy yourself."</p>

<p>It was a swift rush to Dartford through the night; bareheaded
he bent forward beside the chauffeur, teeth set, every nerve tense
and straining as though his very will power was driving the machine
forward. Then there came a maddening slowing down through Dartford
streets, a nerve-racking delay until Sam Ogilvy's giant brother
had stowed away himself and his satchel in the tonneau; then slow
speed to the town limits; a swift hurling forward into space that
whirled blackly around them as the great acetylenes split the
darkness and chaos roared in their ears.</p>

<p>Under the lighted windows the big doctor scrambled out and stamped
upstairs; and Neville waited on the landing.</p>

<p>His father appeared below, looking up at him, and started to
say something; but apparently changed his mind and went back into
the living room, rattling his evening paper and coughing.</p>

<p>Cameron passed through the hallway, looked at him, but let him
alone.</p>

<p>After a while the door opened and Lily came out.</p>

<p>"I'm not needed," she said; "your mother and Stephanie have taken
charge."</p>

<p>"Is she going to be very ill?"</p>

<p>"Billy Ogilvy hasn't said anything yet."</p>

<p>"Is she conscious?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is now."</p>

<p>"Has she said anything more?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Lily stood silent a moment, gazing absently down at the lighted
hall below, then she looked at her brother as though she, too,
were about to speak, but, like her father, she reconsidered the
impulse, and went away toward the nursery.</p>

<p>Later his mother opened the door very softly, let herself and
Stephanie out, and stood looking at him, one finger across her
lips, while Stephanie hurried away downstairs.</p>

<p>"She's asleep, Louis. Don't raise your voice&mdash;" as he stepped
quickly toward her.</p>

<p>"Is it anything serious?" he asked in a low voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know what Dr. Ogilvy thinks. He is coming out in a moment...."
She placed one hand on her son's shoulder, reddening a trifle.
"I've told William Ogilvy that she is a friend of&mdash;the family.
He may have heard Sam talking about her when he was here last.
So I thought it safer."</p>

<p>Neville brought a chair for his mother, but she shook her head,
cautioning silence, and went noiselessly downstairs.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "'Well, Louis, what do you know about this?'"]</p>

<p>Half an hour later Dr. Ogilvy emerged, saw Neville&mdash;walked up
and inspected him, curiously.</p>

<p>"Well, Louis, what do you know about this?" he asked, buttoning
his big thick rain-coat to the throat.</p>

<p>"Absolutely nothing, Billy, except that Miss West, who is a guest
of the Countess d'Enver at Estwich, lost her way in the woods.
How is she now?"</p>

<p>"All right," said the doctor, dryly.</p>

<p>"Is she conscious?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Awake?"</p>

<p>"Yes. She won't be&mdash;long."</p>

<p>"Did she talk to you?"</p>

<p>"A little."</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter?"</p>

<p>"Fright. And I'm wondering whether merely being lost in the woods
is enough to have terrified a girl like that? Because, apparently,
she is as superb a specimen of healthy womanhood as this world
manufactures once in a hundred years. How well do you know her?"</p>

<p>"We are very close friends."</p>

<p>"H'm. Did you suppose she was the kind of woman to be frightened
at merely being lost in a civilised country?"</p>

<p>"No. She has more courage&mdash;of all kinds&mdash;than most women."</p>

<p>"Because," said the big doctor thoughtfully, "while she was unconscious
it took me ten minutes to pry open her fingers and disengage a
rather heavy dog-whip from her clutch.... And there was some evidences
of blood on the lash and on the bone handle."</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Neville, amazed.</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged: "I don't know of any fierce and vicious
dogs between here and Estwich, either," he mused.</p>

<p>"No, Cardemon keeps none. And its mostly his estate."</p>

<p>"Oh ... Any&mdash;h'm!&mdash;vicious <em>men</em>&mdash;in his employment?"</p>

<p>"My God!" whispered Neville, "what do you mean, Billy?"</p>

<p>"Finger imprints&mdash;black and blue&mdash;on both arms. Didn't Miss West
say anything that might enlighten <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"No ... She only said she had been lost.... Wait a moment; I'm
trying to think of the men Cardemon employs&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was ashy white and trembling, and the doctor laid a steadying
hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Louis," he said sharply, "it was no <em>worse</em>
than a fright. <em>Do you understand</em>?... And do you understand,
too, that an innocent and sensitive and modest girl would rather
die than have such a thing made public through your well-meant
activity? So there's nothing for anybody to do&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>Neville could scarcely speak.</p>

<p>"Do you mean&mdash;she was attacked by some&mdash;man!"</p>

<p>"It looks like it. And&mdash;you'd better keep it from your family&mdash;because
<em>she</em> did. She's game to the core&mdash;that little girl."</p>

<p>"But she&mdash;she'll tell me!" stammered Neville&mdash;she's <em>got</em>
to tell me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She won't if she can help it. Would it aid her any if you found
out who it was and killed him?&mdash;ran for a gun and did a little
murdering some pleasant morning&mdash;just to show your chivalrous
consideration and devotion to her?"</p>

<p>"Are you asking me to let a beast like that go unpunished?" demanded
Neville violently.</p>

<p>"Oh, use your brains, Louis. He frightened her and she slashed
him well for it. And, womanlike&mdash;after there was no more danger
and no more necessity for pluck&mdash;she got scared and ran; and the
farther she ran the more scared she became. Look here, Louis;
look at me&mdash;squarely." He laid both ponderous hands on Neville's
shoulders:</p>

<p>"Sam has told me all about you and Miss West&mdash;and I can guess
how your family takes it. Can't you see why she had the pluck
to remain silent about this thing? It was because she saw in it
the brutal contempt of the world toward a woman who stood in that
world alone, unsupported, unprotected. And she would not have
you and your family know how lightly the world held the woman
whom you love and wish to marry&mdash;not for her own sake alone&mdash;but
for the sake of your family's pride&mdash;and yours."</p>

<p>His hands dropped from Neville's shoulders; he stood considering
him for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"I've told <em>you</em> because, if you are the man I think you
are, you ought to know the facts. Forcing her to the humiliation
of telling you will not help matters; filling this pup full of
lead means an agony of endless publicity and shame for her, for
your family, and for you.... He'll never dare remain in the same
county with her after this. He's probably skedaddled by this time
anyway." ... Dr. Ogilvy looked narrowly at Neville. "Are you pretty
sane, now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You realise that gun-play is no good in this matter?"</p>

<p>"Y-yes."</p>

<p>"And you really are going to consider Miss West before your own
natural but very primitive desire to do murder?"</p>

<p>Neville nodded.</p>

<p>"Knowing," added the doctor, "that the unspeakable cur who affronted
her has probably taken to his heels?"</p>

<p>Neville, pale and silent, raised his eyes:</p>

<p>"Do you suspect anybody?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said the doctor carelessly;&mdash;"I'll just step
over to the telephone and make an inquiry of Penrhyn Cardemon&mdash;"</p>

<p>He walked to the end of the big hall, unhooked the receiver,
asked for Cardemon's house, got it.</p>

<p>Neville heard him say:</p>

<p>"This is Dr. Ogilvy. Is that you, Gelett? Isn't your master at
home?"</p>

<p>"Pretty roughly handled, eh! All right. When you communicate
with him tell him that Dr. Ogilvy and Mr. Neville, Jr., were greatly
interested to know how badly he was injured. Do you understand?
Well, don't forget. And you may tell him, Gelett, that as long
as the scars remain, he'd better remain, too. Get it straight,
Gelett; tell him it's my medical advice to remain away as long
as he can&mdash;and a little longer. This climate is no good for him.
Good-bye."</p>

<p>He turned from the telephone and sauntered toward Neville, who
regarded him with a fixed stare.</p>

<p>"You see," he remarked with a shrug; and drew from his pocket
a slightly twisted scarf pin&mdash;a big horse-shoe set with sapphires
and diamonds&mdash;the kind of pin some kinds of men use in their riding-stocks.</p>

<p>"I've often seen him wearing it," he said carelessly. "Curious
how it could have become twisted and entangled in Miss West's
lace waist."</p>

<p>He held out the pin, turning it over reflectively as the facets
of the gems caught and flashed back the light from the hall brackets.</p>

<p>"I'll drop it into the poor-box I think," he mused. "Cardemon
will remain away so long that this pin will be entirely out of
fashion when he returns."</p>

<p>After a few moments Neville drew a long, deep breath, and his
clenched hands relaxed.</p>

<p>"Sure," commented the burly doctor. "That's right&mdash;feeling better&mdash;rush
of common sense to the head. Well, I've got to go."</p>

<p>"Will you be here in the morning?"</p>

<p>"I think not. She'll be all right. If she isn't, send over for
me."</p>

<p>"You don't think that the shock&mdash;the exhaustion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Naw," said the big doctor with good-natured contempt; "she's
going to be all right in the morning.... She's a lovely creature,
isn't she? Sam said so. Sam has an eye for beauty. But, by jinks!
I was scarcely prepared for such physical perfection&mdash;h'm!&mdash;or
such fine and nice discrimination&mdash;or for such pluck.... God knows
what people's families want these days. If the world mated properly
our best families would be extinct in another generation.... You're
one of 'em; you'd better get diligent before the world wakes up
with a rush of common sense to its doddering old head." He gave
him both hands, warmly, cordially: "Good-bye, Louis."</p>

<p>Neville said: "I want you to know that I'd marry her to-morrow
if she'd have me, Billy."</p>

<p>The doctor lifted his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Won't she?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then probably you're not up to sample. A girl like that is no
fool. She'll require a lot in a man. However, you're young; and
you may make good yet."</p>

<p>"You don't understand, Billy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. She wears a dinky miniature of you against her naked
heart. Yes, I guess I understand.... And I guess she's that kind
of a girl all unselfishness and innocence, and generous perversity
and&mdash;quixotic love.... It's too bad, Louis. I guess you're up
against it for fair."</p>

<p>He surveyed the younger man, shook his head:</p>

<p>"They can't stand for her, can they?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And she won't stand for snaking you out of the fold. That's
it, I fancy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Too bad&mdash;too bad. She's a fine woman&mdash;a very fine little woman.
That's the kind a man ought to marry and bother the Almighty with
gratitude all the rest of his life. Well&mdash;well! Your family is
your own after all; and I live in Dartford, thank God!&mdash;not on
lower Fifth Avenue or Tenth Street."</p>

<p>He started away, halted, came back:</p>

<p>"Couldn't you run away with her?" he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"She won't," replied Neville, unsmiling.</p>

<p>"I mean, violently. But she's too heavy to carry, I fancy&mdash;and
I'll bet she's got the vigour of little old Diana herself. No&mdash;you
couldn't do the Sabine act with her&mdash;only a club and the cave-man's
gentle persuasion would help either of you.... Well&mdash;well, if
they see her at breakfast it may help some. You know a woman makes
or breaks herself at breakfast. That's why the majority of woman
take it abed. I'm serious, Louis; no man can stand 'em&mdash;the majority."</p>

<p>Once more he started away, hesitated, came back.</p>

<p>"Who's this Countess that Sam is so crazy about?"</p>

<p>"A sweet little woman, well-bred, and very genuine and sincere."</p>

<p>"Never heard of her in Dartford," muttered the doctor.</p>

<p>Neville laughed grimly:</p>

<p>"Billy, Tenth Street and lower Fifth Avenue and Greenwich Village
and Chelsea and Stuyvesant Square&mdash;and Syringa Avenue, Dartford,
are all about alike. Bird Centre is just as stupid as Manhattan;
and there never was and never will be a republic and a democracy
in any country on the face of this snob-cursed globe."</p>

<p>The doctor, very red, stared at him.</p>

<p>"By jinks!" he said, "I guess I'm one after all. Now, who in
hell would suspect that!&mdash;after all the advice I've given you!"</p>

<p>"It was another fellow's family, that's all," said Neville wearily.
"Theories work or they don't; only few care to try them on themselves
or their own families&mdash;particularly when they devoutly believe
in them."</p>

<p>"Gad! That's a stinger! You've got me going all right," said
the doctor, wincing, "and you're perfectly correct. Here I've
been practically counselling you to marry where your inclination
led you, and let the rest go to blazes; and when it's a question
of Sam doing something similar, I retire hastily across the river
and establish a residence in Missouri. What a rotten, custom-ridden
bunch of snippy-snappy-snobbery we are after all!... All the same&mdash;who
<em>is</em> the Countess?"</p>

<p>Neville didn't know much about her.</p>

<p>"Sam's such an ass," said his brother, "and it isn't all snobbery
on my part."</p>

<p>"The safest thing to do," said Neville bitterly, "is to let a
man in love alone."</p>

<p>"Right. Foolish&mdash;damned foolish&mdash;but right! There is no greater
ass than a wise one. Those who don't know anything at all are
the better asses&mdash;and the happier."</p>

<p>And he went away down the stairs, muttering and gesticulating.</p>

<p>Mrs. Neville came to the door as he opened it to go out. They
talked in low voices for a few moments, then the doctor went out
and Mrs. Neville called to Stephanie.</p>

<p>The girl came from the lighted drawing-room, and, together, the
two women ascended the stairs.</p>

<p>Stephanie smiled and nodded to Neville, then continued on along
the hall; but his mother stopped to speak to him.</p>

<p>"Go and sit with your father a little while," she said. "And
don't be impatient with him, dear. He is an old man&mdash;a product
of a different age and a simpler civilisation&mdash;perhaps a narrower
one. Be patient and gentle with him. He really is fond of you
and proud of you."</p>

<p>"Very well, mother.... Is anybody going to sit up with Valerie?"</p>

<p>"Stephanie insists on sleeping on the couch at the foot of her
bed. I offered to sit up but she wouldn't let me.... You'll see
that I'm called if anything happens, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Good-night, mother."</p>

<p>He kissed her, stood a moment looking at the closed door behind
which lay Valerie&mdash;tried to realise that she did lie there under
the same roof-tree that sheltered father, mother, and sister&mdash;then,
with a strange thrill in his heart, he went downstairs.</p>

<p>Cameron passed him, on his upward way to slumberland.</p>

<p>"How's Miss West?" he asked cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Asleep, I think. Billy Ogilvy expects her to be all right in
the morning."</p>

<p>"Good work! Glad of it. Tell your governor; he's been inquiring."</p>

<p>"Has he?" said Neville, with another thrill, and went into the
living room where his father sat alone before the whitening ashes
of the fire.</p>

<p>"Well, father!" he said, smiling.</p>

<p>The older man turned his head, then turned it away as his son
drew up a chair and laid a stick across the andirons.</p>

<p>"It's turned a little chilly," he said.</p>

<p>"I have known of many a frost in May," said his father.</p>

<p>There was a silence; then his father slowly turned and gazed
at him.</p>

<p>"How is &mdash;Miss West?" he asked stiffly.</p>

<p>"Billy Ogilvy says she will be all right to-morrow, father."</p>

<p>"Was she injured by her unfortunate experience?"</p>

<p>"A little briar-torn, I'm afraid. Those big beech woods are rather
a puzzle to anybody who is not familiar with the country. No wonder
she became frightened when it grew dark."</p>

<p>"It was&mdash;very distressing," nodded his father.</p>

<p>They remained silent again until Mr. Neville rose, took off his
spectacles, laid aside <em>The Evening Post</em>, and held out
his hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night, my son."</p>

<p>"Good-night, father."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;good-night&mdash;good-night&mdash;to many, many things, my son;
old-fashioned things of no value any more&mdash;of no use to me, or
you, or anybody any more."</p>

<p>He retained his son's hand in his, peering at him, dim-eyed,
without his spectacles:</p>

<p>"The old order passes&mdash;the old ideas, the old beliefs&mdash;and the
old people who cherished them&mdash;who know no others, needed no others....
Good-night, my son."</p>

<p>But he made no movement to leave, and still held to his son's
hand:</p>

<p>"I've tried to live as blamelessly as my father lived, Louis&mdash;and
as God has given me to see my way through life.... But&mdash;the times
change so&mdash;change so. The times are perplexing; life grows noisier,
and stranger and more complex and more violent every day around
us&mdash;and the old require repose, Louis. Try to understand that."</p>

<p>"Yes, father."</p>

<p>The other looked at him, wearily:</p>

<p>"Your mother seems to think that your happiness in life depends
on&mdash;what we say to you&mdash;this evening. Stephanie seems to believe
it, too.... Lily says very little.... And so do I, Louis&mdash;very
little ... only enough to&mdash;to wish you&mdash;happiness. And so&mdash;good-night."</p>
