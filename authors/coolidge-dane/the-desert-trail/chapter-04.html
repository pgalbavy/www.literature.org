<p>From the times of David and Jonathan down to the present day the world
has been full of young men sworn to friendship and seeking adventure in
pairs. "Pardners," they call them in the West, and though the word has
not crept into the dictionary yet, it is as different from "partner" as
a friend is from a business associate.
</p><p>They travel together, these pardners of the West, and whether they be
cowboys or "Cousin Jacks," the boss who fires one of them fires both of
them, and they go share and share in everything.
</p><p>Bud Hooker and Philip De Lancey had met by chance in El Paso when the
revolution was just beginning to boil and the city was swarming with
adventurers. The agents of the rebels were everywhere, urging Americans
to join their cause. Military preferment, cash payments, and grants of
land were the baits they used, but Hooker stood out from the first and
took De Lancey with him. A Mexican promise did not pass current where
he was born and they went to the mines instead.
</p><p>Then the war broke out and, while fugitives streamed out of stricken
Chihuahua, they finally struck out against the tide, fighting their way
to a certain mine far back in the Sierra Madres, where they could dig
the gold on shares.
</p><p>Behind them the battle waged; Casas Grandes was taken and retaken;
Juarez, Agua Negra, and Chihuahua fell; Don Porfirio, the Old Man of
Mexico, went out and Madero took his place; and still they worked for
their stake.
</p><p>Then new arms and ammunition flowed in from across the border; Orozco
and his rebel chiefs went out, and the breath of war fanned higher
against the hills. At last the first broken band of rebels came
straggling by, and, reading hate and envy in their lawless eyes, the
Americans dug up their gold at sundown and rode all the night for their
lives.
</p><p>And now, welded together by all that toil and danger, they were
pardners, cherishing no delusions as to each other's strength or
weaknesses, but joined together for better or worse.
</p><p>It was the last thing that either of them expected, but three days
after they fled out of Mexico, and with all their money unspent, the
hand of fate seized upon them and sent them back on another adventure.
</p><p>It was early morning again, with crowds along the street, and as they
ambled slowly along toward the line, the men on the corners stared at
them. The bunch of cowboys gazed at Bud, who sported a new pair of
high-heeled boots, and knew him by the way he rode; and the mining men
looked searchingly at De Lancey, as if to guess the secret of his quest.
</p><p>A squad of mounted troopers, riding out on border patrol, gazed after
them questioningly, but Bud and Phil rode on soberly, leading their
pack, and headed for Agua Negra across the line.
</p><p>It was a grim place to look at, this border town of Agua Negra, for the
war had swept it twice. A broad waste of level land lay between it and
the prosperous American city, and across this swath, where the Mausers
and machine guns had twice mowed, lay the huddle of low houses which
marked the domain of Mexico.
</p><p>Fussy little customs officials, lurking like spiders in their cooped-up
guard-houses, rushed out as they crossed the deep trench and demanded
their permit to bear arms. The moment they crossed the line the air
seemed to be pervaded with Latin excitability and Indian jealousy, but
De Lancey replied in florid Spanish, and before his polite assurances
and fulsome compliments it was dissipated in a moment.
</p><p>"Good! Pass on, <u>amigos</u>," cried the beady-eyed little <u>jefe</u>, pasting
a label on their pack. "<u>Adios, señor</u>," he added, returning Phil's
salute with a military flourish, and with a scornful glance at Bud he
observed that the <u>gentleman</u> was <u>muy caballero</u>.
</p><p>"Huh!" remarked Bud, as they rode on through the town, "we're in Mexico
all right, all right. Talk with both hands and get busy with your
eyebrows--and holy Joe, look at them <u>pelónes</u>!"
</p><p>The <u>pelónes</u> referred to were a squad of Mexican Federal soldiers,
so-called from their heads being shaved, and they were marching
doggedly to and fro through the thorny mesquit-bushes in response to
shouted orders from an officer. Being from Zacatecas, where the breed
is short, they stood about as high as their guns; and their crumpled
linen suits and flapping sandals detracted sadly from the soldierly
effect.
</p><p>Big and hulking, and swelling with the pride of his kind, Hooker looked
them over slowly, and spoke his hidden thought.
</p><p>"I wonder," he said, turning to Phil, "how many of them I could lick
with one hand?"
</p><p>"Well, they're nothing but a lot of petty convicts, anyway," answered
De Lancey, "but here's some boys ahead that I'll bet could hold you,
man for man, husky as you are, old fellow."
</p><p>They were riding past a store, now serving as an improvised barracks,
and romping about in the street were a pair of tall Yaqui Indians, each
decorated with a cartridge-belt about his hips in token of his military
service. Laughing and grabbing for holds, they frolicked like a couple
of boys until finally they closed in a grapple that revealed a sudden
and pantherlike strength.
</p><p>And a group of others, sunning themselves against the wall, looked up
at the Americans with eyes as fearless as mountain eagles.
</p><p>"Yes, that's right," admitted Bud, returning their friendly greeting,
"but we'll never have no trouble with them."
</p><p>"Well, these <u>Nacionales</u> are not so bad," defended Phil, as they
passed the State soldiers of Sonora on the street, "but they're just as
friendly as the Yaquis."
</p><p>"Sure," jeered Bud, "when they're sober! But you get a bunch of 'em
drunk and ask 'em what they think of the Gringos! No, you got to show
me--I've seen too much of 'em."
</p><p>"You haven't seen as much of 'em as _I_ have, yet," retorted De Lancey,
quickly. "I've been all over the republic, except right here in Sonora,
and I swear these Sonorans here look good to me. There's no use holding
a grouch against them, Bud--they haven't done us any dirt."
</p><p>"No, they never had no chance," grumbled Bud, gazing grimly to the
south. "But wait till the hot weather comes and the <u>revoltosos</u> come
out of their holes; wait till them Chihuahua greasers thaw out up in
the Sierras and come down to get some fresh mounts. Well, I'll tell 'em
one thing," he ended, reaching down to pat his horse, "they'll never
get old Copper Bottom here--not unless they steal him at night. It's
all right to be cheerful about this, Phil, and you keep right on being
glad, but I got a low-down hunch that we're going to get in bad."
</p><p>"Well, I've got just as good a hunch," came back De Lancey, "that we're
going to make a killing."
</p><p>"Yes, and speaking of killings," said Bud, "you don't want to overlook
<u>that</u>."
</p><p>He pointed at a group of dismantled adobe buildings standing out on
the edge of the town and flanked by a segment of whitewashed wall all
spattered and breached with bullet-holes.
</p><p>"There's where these prize Mexicans of yourn pulled off the biggest
killing in Sonora. I was over here yesterday with that old prospector
and he told me that that wall is the bull-ring. After the first big
fight they gathered up three hundred and fifty men, more or less, and
throwed 'em in a trench along by the wall--then they blowed it over
on 'em with a few sticks of dynamite and let 'em pass for buried. No
crosses or nothing. Excuse <u>me</u>, if they ever break loose like that--we
might get planted with the rest!"
</p><p>"By Jove, old top!" exclaimed De Lancey, laughing teasingly, "you've
certainly got the blues to-day. Here, take something out of this bottle
and see if it won't help."
</p><p>He brought out a quart bottle from his saddle-bags and Bud drank, and
shuddered at the bite of it.
</p><p>"All right," he said, as he passed it back, "and while we're talking,
what's the matter with cutting it out on booze for this trip?"
</p><p>"What are we going to drink, then?" cried De Lancey in feigned alarm.
"Water?"
</p><p>"Well, something like that," admitted Bud. "Come on--what do you say?
We might get lit up and tell something."
</p><p>"Now lookee here, Bud," clamored Phil, who had had a few drinks
already, "you don't mean to insinuate, do you? Next thing I know you'll
be asking me to cut it out on the hay--might talk in my sleep, you
know, and give the whole snap away!"
</p><p>"No, you're a good boy when you're asleep, Phil," responded Bud, "but
when you get about half shot it's different. Come on, now--I'll quit if
you will. That's fair, ain't it?"
</p><p>"What? No little toots around town? No serenading the <u>señoritas</u> and
giving the <u>rurales</u> the hotfoot? Well, what's the use of living, Bud,
if you can't have a little fun? Drinking don't make any difference, as
long as we stick together. What's the use of swearing off--going on
record in advance? We may find some fellow that we can't work any other
way--we may have to go on a drunk with him in order to get his goat.
But will you stick? That's the point!"
</p><p>Bud glanced at him and grunted, and for a long time he rode on in
silence. Before them lay a rolling plain, dipping by broad gulches
and dwindling ridges to the lower levels of Old Mexico, and on the
sky-line, thin and blue, stood the knifelike edges of the Fortunas
miles away.
</p><p>With desert-trained eyes he noted the landmarks, San Juan mountain
to the right, Old Niggerhead to the left, and the feather-edge of
mountains far below; and as he looked he stored it away in his mind in
case he should come back on the run some night.
</p><p>It was not a foreboding, but the training of his kind, to note the lay
of the ground, and he planned just where he would ride to keep under
cover if he ever made a dash for the line. But all the time his pardner
was talking of friendship and of the necessity of their sticking
together.
</p><p>"I'll tell you, Bud," he said at last, his voice trembling with
sentiment, "whether we win or lose, I won't have a single regret as
long as I know we've been true to one another. You may know Texas and
Arizona, Bud, but I know Old Mexico, the land of <u>mañana</u> and broken
promises. I know the country, Bud--and the climate--and the women!
</p><p>"They play the devil with the best of us, Bud, these dark-eyed
<u>señoritas</u>! That's what makes all the trouble down here between man
and man, it's these women and their ways. They're not satisfied to win
a man's heart--they want him to kill somebody to show that he really
loves them. By Jove! they're a fickle lot, and nothing pleases 'em more
than setting man against man, one pardner against another."
</p><p>"We never had no trouble yet," observed Bud sententiously.
</p><p>"No, but we're likely to," protested De Lancey. "Those Indian women up
in the Sierras wouldn't turn anybody's head, but we're going down into
the hot country now, where the girls are pretty, ta-ra, ta-ra, and we
talk through the windows at midnight."
</p><p>"Well, if you'll cut out the booze," said Hooker shortly, "you can have
'em all, for all of me."
</p><p>"Sure, that's what you say, but wait till you see them! Oh, la, la,
la!"--he kissed his fingers ecstatically--"I'll be glad to see 'em
myself! But listen, Bud, here's the proposition: Let's take an oath
right now, while we're starting out, that whatever comes up we'll
always be true to each other. If one of us is wounded, the other stays
with him; if he's in prison, he gets him out; if he's killed, he
avenges his--"
</p><p>"Say," broke in Bud, jostling him rudely as he reached into the
saddle-bags, "let me carry that bottle for a while."
</p><p>He took a big drink out of it to prevent De Lancey from getting it all
and shoved it inside his overalls.
</p><p>"All right, pardner," he continued, with a mocking smile, "anything
you say. I never use oaths myself much, but anything to oblige."
</p><p>"No, but I mean it, Bud!" cried De Lancey. "Here's the proposition now:
Whatever happens, we stay with each other till this deal is finished;
on all scratch cases we match money to see who's it; and if we tangle
over some girl the best man wins and the other one stays away. We leave
it to the girl which one wins. Will you shake hands on that?"
</p><p>"Don't need to," responded Bud; "I'll do it anyway."
</p><p>"Well, shake on it, then!" insisted De Lancey, holding out his hand.
</p><p>"Oh, Sally!" burst out Bud, hanging his head in embarrassment, "what's
the use of getting mushy?"
</p><p>But a moment later he leaned over in his saddle and locked hands with a
viselike grip.
</p><p>"My old man told me not to make no such promises," he muttered, "but
I'll do it, being's it's you."
