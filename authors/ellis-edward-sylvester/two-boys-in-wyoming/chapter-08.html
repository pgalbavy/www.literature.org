<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Crouching behind the friendly boulder, Fred Greenwood rested
the barrel of his Winchester upon it and took careful aim at the
buck, which seemed scarcely to have moved from the moment he was
seen by the youths. That he maintained his pose thus long was
certainly remarkable, and the fact was due to a cause suspected
by neither of the boys.</p>

<p>That the antelope has the bump of curiosity developed to a most
amazing degree is well known. It is this peculiarity which has
proved fatal to the animals in numberless instances. The curiosity
of the <em>cervus</em> species, while much less, sometimes manifests
itself in an extraordinary fashion. Fred Greenwood managed his
approach with so much skill that he was not noticed; but his comrade,
further away, was seen by the vigilant animal, when Jack, becoming
impatient over the delay, began the attempt to follow him. The
sight of the young hunter startled the buck. He was on the point
of whirling about and making off, but waited to learn something
more definite. The caution of Jack rendered this difficult, and
it was because of the animal's hesitation that Fred succeeded
in reaching the spot from which to try a shot.</p>

<p>The lad sighted at the front of the game and his finger was pressing
the trigger, when, perhaps because of a sudden sight of Jack,
the buck turned about to flee. It was at this juncture that Fred
fired.</p>

<p>The result was better than he expected. It is almost impossible
to kill a deer instantly, instances being known of one running
a number of rods with a bullet through his heart; but in this
instance the buck, gathering his forelegs under him, as if to
leap a high obstruction, bounded straight up in air and dropped
back so close to the edge of the cliff that he toppled over and
came tumbling downward like a log of wood.</p>

<p>The point where he fell was some distance away and out of sight
of the young hunter, who, with a delighted exclamation, rose to
his feet and began scrambling toward his prize. But for his excitement
Fred would have noted a singular thing. When the report of his
rifle rang out in the stillness, the echo from the face of the
cliff sounded as sharp and loud as the crack of his own weapon.
The explanation of this speedily became manifest.</p>

<p>Although the way was rough, the distance was so short that it
took Fred only a brief time to reach the inanimate body of the
buck.</p>

<p>"Hank couldn't have beaten that shot himself! I must have driven
the bullet through his heart, which I shouldn't have done if he
hadn't started to flee at the instant I pulled trigger&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that moment an Indian, rifle in hand, stepped into view from
among the rocks, and with a grin on his face came toward the youth.
Fred was not dreaming of anything of the kind, and looked at the
red man in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Eh! howdy, brother? That my buck," said the Indian, with his
painted face still bisected by a tremendous smile.</p>

<p>The lad flared up on the instant.</p>

<p>"How do you make that out? I just shot him."</p>

<p>"No; me shoot him&mdash;he mine."</p>

<p>Fred's gorge continued to rise.</p>

<p>"You are not speaking the truth. I fired at him a few minutes
ago and saw him spring in air and fall over the cliff."</p>

<p>"Where you hit him?"</p>

<p>Ready to prove the truth of his own words, the youth stooped
over the carcass, which was lying on its left side. A crimson
orifice was seen just back of the foreleg, which showed where
the tiny messenger of death had entered.</p>

<p>"That's where I struck him! What have you to say to <em>that</em>?"</p>

<p>"I shoot at the same time as brother. That where my bullet go
in. Dere where it come out."</p>

<p>Reflection convinced Fred of the unpleasant fact that this Indian
was speaking the truth. The relative position of the lad and the
dead buck had been such that it was impossible for his bullet
to take the course of the one that had slain the animal. The decisive
shot, therefore, was not his.</p>

<p>"But I know mine struck him somewhere," was Fred's desperate
exclamation; "could it have taken the same course as yours?"</p>

<p>The tantalizing smile came back to the face of the red man, who
shook his head.</p>

<p>"My brother's bullet strike dere&mdash;hurt antler bad."</p>

<p>The Indian thrust the toe of his moccasin against the buck's
antlers. It was plain that one of the prongs had been chipped
off, as if by the impact of a glancing bullet. Fred could no longer
deny the mortifying fact that his shot had no more to do with
the death of the animal than if it had been a pebble tossed up
the cliff by hand.</p>

<p>The discovery did not add to his temper, and he was in an unreasonable
mood.</p>

<p>"You hadn't any business to fire at the buck when I did! I had
picked him out for my game and it was a mean act on your part.
We both struck him, and I shall claim one-half of him, for I'm
hungry, and it will soon be supper-time."</p>

<p>A dangerous light shone in the black eyes of the Indian. Evidently
he had no liking for the race of the young man, and his resentment
was roused by his words and manner.</p>

<p>"He mine; me take him; you thief!"</p>

<p>It occurred to Fred Greenwood at this moment that it would be
unwise as well as perilous to quarrel with this denizen of the
wilderness. He was in middle life, active, powerful, wiry and
unscrupulous. The youth was no match for him in a personal encounter;
besides which he noticed that the fellow carried a Winchester
like his own, not to mention the formidable knife at his waist.</p>

<p>Still the lad was too proud to yield the point without protest.
Besides, he was growing anxious about that supper which hung suspended
in the balance.</p>

<p>"It's only fair that you should give me a part of the body; you
can't eat a tenth part of it. You must divide."</p>

<p>"He mine&mdash;me take all&mdash;white dog have none&mdash;me kill him."</p>

<p>"You will, eh? I shall have something to say about that."</p>

<p>It was Jack Dudley who uttered these words as he strode into
view from the direction taken a few minutes before by his comrade.</p>

<p>The Indian had detected the approach of Jack before he spoke
and before Fred knew of his coming. He raised his head like a
flash, and the dark, threatening expression vanished, succeeded
by the grin that was there when he first appeared to the younger
lad.</p>

<p>"Howdy, brother?" he said, extending his hand, which was taken
rather gingerly by the surprised youth, who recognized him as
Motoza, the vagrant Sioux, with whom he had had the singular experience
some nights before, when encamped in the grove on the prairie.</p>

<p>"Why, I didn't suspect it was <em>you</em>," added Jack, hardly
knowing how to address him.</p>

<p>Motoza would have lacked ordinary perception had he failed to
see that the boys were friends. What impulse led him to do what
he did it would be hard to explain, but without making any response
to the remark of Jack he drew his knife, stooped over the carcass,
and dextrously cut two large pieces from the haunches. Straightening
up, he handed one to Jack and the other to Fred, with the words:</p>

<p>"Take, brothers."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," replied Fred, accepting the "peace offering,"
while his friend made similar acknowledgment.</p>

<p>"Brothers want more?"</p>

<p>"That is plenty. We are obliged, and hope you will pardon our
hasty words."</p>

<p>With the chronic grin on his painted face Motoza stood silent,
as if the business was closed between them.</p>

<p>"That gives us our supper, Fred, and we may as well go back to
camp. Good-by, Motoza."</p>

<p>The Sioux slightly nodded, but did not speak. Each boy, carrying
his food, turned his back upon him and moved away in the direction
of the camp. When they had gone a slight distance, Jack looked
back and saw the Indian bent over the carcass of the buck and
busy with his knife in securing a meal for himself. A few minutes
later the parties were out of sight of each other.</p>

<p>At the first water they reached the lads carefully washed and
dressed the venison and resumed their return to camp.</p>

<p>"What do you make of it, Jack?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"I don't know enough about Indians to judge them correctly, but
I think their nature must be similar to our own. Motoza formed
a respect for me because of the manner in which I handled him
the other night."</p>

<p>"That is my belief; and it is not only respect, but friendship.
He likes you, and will never do you harm."</p>

<p>"What about <em>you</em>?"</p>

<p>"I am not so clear there. He and I were quarrelling when you
came up. I thought it was I who killed the buck, but he proved
it was himself, and that I had no claim to him. But I had set
my heart on making a supper off venison to-night, and did not
like the thought of giving it up. He was ugly, and if you hadn't
come up just when you did there would have been trouble, with
the chances against me."</p>

<p>"It was a mistake on your part."</p>

<p>"I fear it was. It may be, however, that Motoza feels better
disposed toward me since he has learned we are friends."</p>

<p>"That is my belief. But it is rather curious that we should run
across him again, so many miles from the spot where we last met;
but, Fred, we must keep our bearings."</p>

<p>They were in a wild section of the mountains, which they had
not seen before, but by carefully noting the position of the sun
in the sky and observing a towering, snow-covered peak that had
been fixed upon as a landmark, they agreed as to the right direction.
They were confirmed in their belief shortly after by coming to
the edge of the canyon which they had leaped on their outward
trip; but the width was fully twenty feet, with no diminishing,
so far as they could see, to the right or left.</p>

<p>"I hardly think it will do to make the venture here," remarked
Jack, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"No; for not only is it too wide, but the other side is several
feet higher than this."</p>

<p>They cautiously approached the edge and peered down into the
frightful depth. There was the same foamy stream, apparently a
half-mile below, clashing over the rocky bottom, and sending up
the faint roar that impressed them when the canyon was first seen.
It was, in short, a reproduction on a reduced scale of the magnificent
Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, which is a source of admiring
wonder to thousands of tourists.</p>

<p>Something away down in the bottom caught the attention of Fred,
and, at his suggestion, they laid aside their rifles and venison
and crept forward on their faces until their heads projected over
the edge of the dizzying depth.</p>

<p>"Do you see him?" asked Fred.</p>

<p>"Yes; who would have thought of such a thing?"</p>

<p>At many points in the yeasty foam black masses of rocks rose
so high above the roaring stream that the water whirled and eddyed
around them. It was mostly these obstructions that kept the current
in a state of turmoil, and made it show distinctly in the twilight
gloom of the canyon. On one of the dripping rocks was a man, standing
so like a statue that in the indistinct light Fred Greenwood took
him for some fantastic formation of stone, worn by the eroding
action of the angry waters, but the suggestion of a living person
was so striking that the two called their spy-glasses into use.</p>

<p>The result was astounding. Instead of being an Indian, as they
had believed at first, it was a white man. Furthermore, the instruments
proved beyond question that he was their old friend, Hank Hazletine.</p>

<p>"What in the name of wonder is he doing down there?" exclaimed
the amazed Jack.</p>

<p>"Standing on a rock," was the reply. "He finds some amusement
in that, or he wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"He must have entered at the mouth of the canyon, which cannot
be far off."</p>

<p>"That may be so. The sides are so broken and rough that he could
use them for stairs in going down or coming up."</p>

<p>"Whew!" exclaimed Jack, with a shudder; "the thought scares me.
I wouldn't undertake it for the world! Suppose, when you had picked
your steps half-way down, you couldn't find a place to rest your
hands or feet; or, in climbing up, you should be stopped within
a yard or two of the top?"</p>

<p>"It would be the end of the chapter for us; but Hank knows the
country so well that he is in no danger of making such a mistake;
but none for us."</p>

<p>In the hope of attracting the notice of their friend the boys
shouted to him, but the roar of the waters was in the ears of
the hunter, who would not have heard the boom of a cannon fired
on the cliffs above. He did not look up or give any heed to their
hail. Fred thought of throwing down a piece of rock, but it was
too dangerous. It was liable to be so deflected from its course
as to kill the unsuspicious hunter, who had assumed great risk
as it was.</p>

<p>"Do you see that?" asked Jack.</p>

<p>The question was caused by the action of Hank, who made a leap
that carried him to the top of the boulder nearest him. Then he
sprang to a second and a third, when, to the astonishment of the
watchers, he disappeared.</p>

<p>The reason was apparent. After his last leap he had passed under
a projecting ledge, from which, of course, he would emerge whenever
he chose to do so. But, though the boys watched for a considerable
time, he did not appear; and, realizing that the afternoon was
drawing to a close, they rose to their feet, with the purpose
of pushing on to camp.</p>

<p>But to do that they must find a place where the canyon could
be crossed, and they set out on their hunt, which proved less
difficult than was anticipated. Not far off a portion of the rocks
on their side projected like a tongue so far over the ravine that
it was barely two yards from its extremity to the other bank.
Moreover, the sides of the canyon were on a level, so that a more
favorable spot for crossing could not have been desired.</p>

<p>An examination of this formation showed that twenty feet below
them the canyon was as wide as at the point from which they had
watched their friend. The ledge, therefore, arched over, and was
in the nature of a partial bridge, whose thickness would have
sustained a great many tons.</p>

<p>They peered downward in quest of Hank, but the gorge had taken
an abrupt turn since they saw him and he was not in sight.</p>

<p>The task before them seemed so simple that the two gave it scarcely
a thought, but it brought them an experience which, in some respects,
was the most terrifying of their lives.</p>

<p>While the banks were substantially on the same level, the opposite
one was fringed with a species of stunted bush, two or three feet
high, quite dense, and bearing a species of red berry such as
is found on the fragrant wintergreen. Hazletine had cautioned
the lads against eating any vegetable whatever in this section,
since many are violently poisonous and have caused the death of
more than one thoughtless tenderfoot.</p>

<p>Fred Greenwood made ready for the first jump. As in the former
instance, the distance was so slight that it was not necessary
to toss any of their impedimenta in advance of their own passage.
It was easy to jump with the Winchester in one hand and the goodly
piece of meat in the other. Since Fred had beaten his friend some
time before, Jack quietly resolved to turn the tables by doing
his best, and he was confident of far surpassing him, especially
as Fred had no suspicion of his intention.</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Jack; "night isn't far off, and it will be dark
by the time we reach camp."</p>

<p>Fred took only a couple of paces for a start, when he bounded
across the chasm with the ease of a chamois. Jack had sauntered
a rod back, as if with no special purpose in mind, when his object
was to secure the impetus that would land him far in advance of
his comrade. Standing thus, he complacently watched Fred, as his
body rose in air, gracefully curved over, and landed at a safe
distance beyond the edge of the canyon.</p>

<p>It was while Jack Dudley was standing thus that he fancied he
saw a disturbance in the bushes where Fred was about to alight.
It was so slight that he did not think it meant anything; and,
without noticing it further, he started on a series of quick,
short steps, which were to give him the necessary momentum to
win the victory over his friend. At that instant Fred landed and
emitted a cry of terror and warning.</p>

<p>"Look out, Jack! Don't jump! Stop! stop!"</p>

<p>But, though Jack heard the cry, it was too late to heed it. He
was so near the edge of the canyon that had he checked himself
he would have gone spinning to death down the abyss. The leap
must be made, and, gathering his muscles, he rose in the air,
with his legs gathered under him, and with the certainty that
the jump would far surpass the one that he had just witnessed.</p>

<p>In that critical moment, when his body rose and seemed suspended
over the gorge, Jack's attention was fixed upon the strange actions
of Fred. The instant he landed he darted to one side, and with
his rifle struck at something in the bushes which Jack could not
see. As he did so he recoiled, and was in the act of advancing
and striking again, when Jack landed upon the ground beyond.</p>

<p>As he did so he heard a vicious, locust-like whir, whose meaning
he recognized. An immense rattlesnake was in the bushes, and Fred
had descended almost upon it. But for the tremendous effort of
Jack he would have dropped squarely upon the velvety body, with
consequences too frightful to be thought of; but his great leap
carried him over it, while the attack of Fred upon the reptile,
in the effort to save his companion, diverted the attention of
the rattlesnake for an instant.</p>

<p>Jack saw the flat, pitted head, the gleaming coil, the distended
jaws, while the slightly elevated tail vibrated so rapidly with
the warning which, once heard, can never be forgotten, that it
looked hazy and mist-like. Before Fred, at imminent risk to himself,
could bring down his clubbed gun with crushing force, Jack felt
a sharp sting in his ankle and called out, in the extremity of
terror:</p>

<p><em>"I'm bitten!"</em></p>

<p>He was not only terrified but angered, and whirling about, he
brought down his gun with spiteful violence on the writhing body.
The reptile struck again, but it was already wounded to that extent
that its blow was erratic, and, though it came near reaching the
hand of Jack, it missed by a safe margin.</p>
