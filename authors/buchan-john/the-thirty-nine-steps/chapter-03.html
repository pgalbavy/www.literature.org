<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>I had a solemn time travelling north that day. It was fine May
weather, with the hawthorn flowering on every hedge, and I asked
myself why, when I was still a free man, I had stayed on in London
and not got the good of this heavenly country. I didn’t dare face
the restaurant car, but I got a luncheon-basket at Leeds and shared
it with the fat woman. Also I got the morning’s papers, with news
about starters for the Derby and the beginning of the cricket
season, and some paragraphs about how Balkan affairs were settling
down and a British squadron was going to Kiel.</p>

<p>When I had done with them I got out Scudder’s little black pocket-book
and studied it. It was pretty well filled with jottings, chiefly
figures, though now and then a name was printed in. For example,
I found the words "Hofgaard", "Luneville", and "Avocado" pretty
often, and especially the word "Pavia".</p>

<p>Now I was certain that Scudder never did anything without a reason,
and I was pretty sure that there was a cypher in all this. That
is a subject which has always interested me, and I did a bit at
it myself once as intelligence officer at Delagoa Bay during the
Boer War. I have a head for things like chess and puzzles, and
I used to reckon myself pretty good at finding out cyphers. This
one looked like the numerical kind where sets of figures correspond
to the letters of the alphabet, but any fairly shrewd man can
find the clue to that sort after an hour or two’s work, and I
didn’t think Scudder would have been content with anything so
easy. So I fastened on the printed words, for you can make a pretty
good numerical cypher if you have a key word which gives you the
sequence of the letters.</p>

<p>I tried for hours, but none of the words answered. Then I fell
asleep and woke at Dumfries just in time to bundle out and get
into the slow Galloway train. There was a man on the platform
whose looks I didn’t like, but he never glanced at me, and when
I caught sight of myself in the mirror of an automatic machine
I didn’t wonder. With my brown face, my old tweeds, and my slouch,
I was the very model of one of the hill farmers who were crowding
into the third-class carriages.</p>

<p>I travelled with half a dozen in an atmosphere of shag and clay
pipes. They had come from the weekly market, and their mouths
were full of prices. I heard accounts of how the lambing had gone
up the Cairn and the Deuch and a dozen other mysterious waters.
Above half the men had lunched heavily and were highly flavoured
with whisky, so they took no notice of me. We rumbled slowly into
a land of little wooded glens and then to a great wide moorland
place, gleaming with lochs, with high blue hills showing northwards.</p>

<p>About five o’clock the carriage had emptied, and I was left alone
as I had hoped. I got out at the next station, a little place
whose name I scarcely noted, set right in the heart of a bog.
It reminded me of one of those forgotten little stations in the
Karroo. An old station-master was digging in his garden, and with
his spade over his shoulder sauntered to the train, took charge
of a parcel, and went back to his potatoes. A child of ten received
my ticket, and I emerged on a white road that straggled over the
brown moor.</p>

<p>It was a gorgeous spring evening, with every hill showing as
clear as a cut amethyst. The air had the queer, rooty smell of
bogs, but it was as fresh as mid-ocean, and it had the strangest
effect on my spirits. I actually felt light-hearted. I might have
been a boy out for a spring holiday tramp, instead of a man of
thirty-seven very much wanted by the police. I felt just as I
used to feel when I was starting for a big trek on a frosty morning
on the high veld. If you believe me, I swung along that road whistling.
There was no plan of campaign in my head, only just to go on and
on in this blessed, honest-smelling hill country, for every mile
put me in better humour with myself.</p>

<p>In a roadside planting I cut a walking-stick of hazel, and presently
struck off the highway up a by-path which followed the glen of
a brawling stream. I reckoned that I was still far ahead of any
pursuit, and for that night might please myself. It was some hours
since I had tasted food, and I was getting very hungry when I
came to a herd’s cottage set in a nook beside a waterfall. A brown-faced
woman was standing by the door, and greeted me with the kindly
shyness of moorland places. When I asked for a night’s lodging
she said I was welcome to the "bed in the loft", and very soon
she set before me a hearty meal of ham and eggs, scones, and thick
sweet milk.</p>

<p>At the darkening her man came in from the hills, a lean giant,
who in one step covered as much ground as three paces of ordinary
mortals. They asked me no questions, for they had the perfect
breeding of all dwellers in the wilds, but I could see they set
me down as a kind of dealer, and I took some trouble to confirm
their view. I spoke a lot about cattle, of which my host knew
little, and I picked up from him a good deal about the local Galloway
markets, which I tucked away in my memory for future use. At ten
I was nodding in my chair, and the "bed in the loft" received
a weary man who never opened his eyes till five o’clock set the
little homestead a-going once more.</p>

<p>They refused any payment, and by six I had breakfasted and was
striding southwards again. My notion was to return to the railway
line a station or two farther on than the place where I had alighted
yesterday and to double back. I reckoned that that was the safest
way, for the police would naturally assume that I was always making
farther from London in the direction of some western port. I thought
I had still a good bit of a start, for, as I reasoned, it would
take some hours to fix the blame on me, and several more to identify
the fellow who got on board the train at St Pancras.</p>

<p>It was the same jolly, clear spring weather, and I simply could
not contrive to feel careworn. Indeed I was in better spirits
than I had been for months. Over a long ridge of moorland I took
my road, skirting the side of a high hill which the herd had called
Cairnsmore of Fleet. Nesting curlews and plovers were crying everywhere,
and the links of green pasture by the streams were dotted with
young lambs. All the slackness of the past months was slipping
from my bones, and I stepped out like a four-year-old. By-and-by
I came to a swell of moorland which dipped to the vale of a little
river, and a mile away in the heather I saw the smoke of a train.</p>

<p>The station, when I reached it, proved to be ideal for my purpose.
The moor surged up around it and left room only for the single
line, the slender siding, a waiting-room, an office, the station-master’s
cottage, and a tiny yard of gooseberries and sweet-william. There
seemed no road to it from anywhere, and to increase the desolation
the waves of a tarn lapped on their grey granite beach half a
mile away. I waited in the deep heather till I saw the smoke of
an east-going train on the horizon. Then I approached the tiny
booking-office and took a ticket for Dumfries.</p>

<p>The only occupants of the carriage were an old shepherd and his
dog—a wall-eyed brute that I mistrusted. The man was asleep, and
on the cushions beside him was that morning’s <em>Scotsman</em>.
Eagerly I seized on it, for I fancied it would tell me something.</p>

<p>There were two columns about the Portland Place Murder, as it
was called. My man Paddock had given the alarm and had the milkman
arrested. Poor devil, it looked as if the latter had earned his
sovereign hardly; but for me he had been cheap at the price, for
he seemed to have occupied the police for the better part of the
day. In the latest news I found a further instalment of the story.
The milkman had been released, I read, and the true criminal,
about whose identity the police were reticent, was believed to
have got away from London by one of the northern lines. There
was a short note about me as the owner of the flat. I guessed
the police had stuck that in, as a clumsy contrivance to persuade
me that I was unsuspected.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the paper, nothing about foreign politics
or Karolides, or the things that had interested Scudder. I laid
it down, and found that we were approaching the station at which
I had got out yesterday. The potato-digging station-master had
been gingered up into some activity, for the west-going train
was waiting to let us pass, and from it had descended three men
who were asking him questions. I supposed that they were the local
police, who had been stirred up by Scotland Yard, and had traced
me as far as this one-horse siding. Sitting well back in the shadow
I watched them carefully. One of them had a book, and took down
notes. The old potato-digger seemed to have turned peevish, but
the child who had collected my ticket was talking volubly. All
the party looked out across the moor where the white road departed.
I hoped they were going to take up my tracks there.</p>

<p>As we moved away from that station my companion woke up. He fixed
me with a wandering glance, kicked his dog viciously, and inquired
where he was. Clearly he was very drunk.</p>

<p>"That’s what comes o’ bein’ a teetotaller," he observed in bitter
regret.</p>

<p>I expressed my surprise that in him I should have met a blue-ribbon
stalwart.</p>

<p>"Ay, but I’m a strong teetotaller," he said pugnaciously. "I
took the pledge last Martinmas, and I havena touched a drop o’
whisky sinsyne. Not even at Hogmanay, though I was sair temptit."</p>

<p>He swung his heels up on the seat, and burrowed a frowsy head
into the cushions.</p>

<p>"And that’s a’ I get," he moaned. "A heid better than hell fire,
and twae een lookin’ different ways for the Sabbath."</p>

<p>"What did it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"A drink they ca’ brandy. Bein’ a teetotaller I keepit off the
whisky, but I was nip-nippin’ a’ day at this brandy, and I doubt
I’ll no be weel for a fortnicht." His voice died away into a splutter,
and sleep once more laid its heavy hand on him.</p>

<p>My plan had been to get out at some station down the line, but
the train suddenly gave me a better chance, for it came to a standstill
at the end of a culvert which spanned a brawling porter-coloured
river. I looked out and saw that every carriage window was closed
and no human figure appeared in the landscape. So I opened the
door, and dropped quickly into the tangle of hazels which edged
the line.</p>

<p>It would have been all right but for that infernal dog. Under
the impression that I was decamping with its master’s belongings,
it started to bark, and all but got me by the trousers. This woke
up the herd, who stood bawling at the carriage door in the belief
that I had committed suicide. I crawled through the thicket, reached
the edge of the stream, and in cover of the bushes put a hundred
yards or so behind me. Then from my shelter I peered back, and
saw the guard and several passengers gathered round the open carriage
door and staring in my direction. I could not have made a more
public departure if I had left with a bugler and a brass band.</p>

<p>Happily the drunken herd provided a diversion. He and his dog,
which was attached by a rope to his waist, suddenly cascaded out
of the carriage, landed on their heads on the track, and rolled
some way down the bank towards the water. In the rescue which
followed the dog bit somebody, for I could hear the sound of hard
swearing. Presently they had forgotten me, and when after a quarter
of a mile’s crawl I ventured to look back, the train had started
again and was vanishing in the cutting.</p>

<p>I was in a wide semicircle of moorland, with the brown river
as radius, and the high hills forming the northern circumference.
There was not a sign or sound of a human being, only the plashing
water and the interminable crying of curlews. Yet, oddly enough,
for the first time I felt the terror of the hunted on me. It was
not the police that I thought of, but the other folk, who knew
that I knew Scudder’s secret and dared not let me live. I was
certain that they would pursue me with a keenness and vigilance
unknown to the British law, and that once their grip closed on
me I should find no mercy.</p>

<p>I looked back, but there was nothing in the landscape. The sun
glinted on the metals of the line and the wet stones in the stream,
and you could not have found a more peaceful sight in the world.
Nevertheless I started to run. Crouching low in the runnels of
the bog, I ran till the sweat blinded my eyes. The mood did not
leave me till I had reached the rim of mountain and flung myself
panting on a ridge high above the young waters of the brown river.</p>

<p>From my vantage-ground I could scan the whole moor right away
to the railway line and to the south of it where green fields
took the place of heather. I have eyes like a hawk, but I could
see nothing moving in the whole countryside. Then I looked east
beyond the ridge and saw a new kind of landscape—shallow green
valleys with plentiful fir plantations and the faint lines of
dust which spoke of highroads. Last of all I looked into the blue
May sky, and there I saw that which set my pulses racing....</p>

<p>Low down in the south a monoplane was climbing into the heavens.
I was as certain as if I had been told that that aeroplane was
looking for me, and that it did not belong to the police. For
an hour or two I watched it from a pit of heather. It flew low
along the hill-tops, and then in narrow circles over the valley
up which I had come. Then it seemed to change its mind, rose to
a great height, and flew away back to the south.</p>

<p>I did not like this espionage from the air, and I began to think
less well of the countryside I had chosen for a refuge. These
heather hills were no sort of cover if my enemies were in the
sky, and I must find a different kind of sanctuary. I looked with
more satisfaction to the green country beyond the ridge, for there
I should find woods and stone houses.</p>

<p>About six in the evening I came out of the moorland to a white
ribbon of road which wound up the narrow vale of a lowland stream.
As I followed it, fields gave place to bent, the glen became a
plateau, and presently I had reached a kind of pass where a solitary
house smoked in the twilight. The road swung over a bridge, and
leaning on the parapet was a young man.</p>

<p>He was smoking a long clay pipe and studying the water with spectacled
eyes. In his left hand was a small book with a finger marking
the place. Slowly he repeated—</p>

<p>As when a Gryphon through the wilderness With wingèd step, o’er
hill and moory dale Pursues the Arimaspian.</p>

<p>He jumped round as my step rung on the keystone, and I saw a
pleasant sunburnt boyish face.</p>

<p>"Good evening to you," he said gravely. "It’s a fine night for
the road."</p>

<p>The smell of peat smoke and of some savoury roast floated to
me from the house.</p>

<p>"Is that place an inn?" I asked.</p>

<p>"At your service," he said politely. "I am the landlord, sir,
and I hope you will stay the night, for to tell you the truth
I have had no company for a week."</p>

<p>I pulled myself up on the parapet of the bridge and filled my
pipe. I began to detect an ally.</p>

<p>"You’re young to be an innkeeper," I said.</p>

<p>"My father died a year ago and left me the business. I live there
with my grandmother. It’s a slow job for a young man, and it wasn’t
my choice of profession."</p>

<p>"Which was?"</p>

<p>He actually blushed. "I want to write books," he said.</p>

<p>"And what better chance could you ask?" I cried. "Man, I’ve often
thought that an innkeeper would make the best story-teller in
the world."</p>

<p>"Not now," he said eagerly. "Maybe in the old days when you had
pilgrims and ballad-makers and highwaymen and mail-coaches on
the road. But not now. Nothing comes here but motor-cars full
of fat women, who stop for lunch, and a fisherman or two in the
spring, and the shooting tenants in August. There is not much
material to be got out of that. I want to see life, to travel
the world, and write things like Kipling and Conrad. But the most
I’ve done yet is to get some verses printed in <em>Chambers’s
Journal</em>."</p>

<p>I looked at the inn standing golden in the sunset against the
brown hills.</p>

<p>"I’ve knocked a bit about the world, and I wouldn’t despise such
a hermitage. D’you think that adventure is found only in the tropics
or among gentry in red shirts? Maybe you’re rubbing shoulders
with it at this moment."</p>

<p>"That’s what Kipling says," he said, his eyes brightening, and
he quoted some verse about "Romance brings up the 9.15."</p>

<p>"Here’s a true tale for you then," I cried, "and a month from
now you can make a novel out of it."</p>

<p>Sitting on the bridge in the soft May gloaming I pitched him
a lovely yarn. It was true in essentials, too, though I altered
the minor details. I made out that I was a mining magnate from
Kimberley, who had had a lot of trouble with <em>I.D.B. </em>and
had shown up a gang. They had pursued me across the ocean, and
had killed my best friend, and were now on my tracks.</p>

<p>I told the story well, though I say it who shouldn’t. I pictured
a flight across the Kalahari to German Africa, the crackling,
parching days, the wonderful blue-velvet nights. I described an
attack on my life on the voyage home, and I made a really horrid
affair of the Portland Place murder. "You’re looking for adventure,"
I cried; "well, you’ve found it here. The devils are after me,
and the police are after them. It’s a race that I mean to win."</p>

<p>"By God!" he whispered, drawing his breath in sharply, "it is
all pure Rider Haggard and Conan Doyle."</p>

<p>"You believe me," I said gratefully.</p>

<p>"Of course I do," and he held out his hand. "I believe everything
out of the common. The only thing to distrust is the normal."</p>

<p>He was very young, but he was the man for my money.</p>

<p>"I think they’re off my track for the moment, but I must lie
close for a couple of days. Can you take me in?"</p>

<p>He caught my elbow in his eagerness and drew me towards the house.
"You can lie as snug here as if you were in a moss-hole. I’ll
see that nobody blabs, either. And you’ll give me some more material
about your adventures?"</p>

<p>As I entered the inn porch I heard from far off the beat of an
engine. There silhouetted against the dusky West was my friend,
the monoplane.</p>

<p>He gave me a room at the back of the house, with a fine outlook
over the plateau, and he made me free of his own study, which
was stacked with cheap editions of his favourite authors. I never
saw the grandmother, so I guessed she was bedridden. An old woman
called Margit brought me my meals, and the innkeeper was around
me at all hours. I wanted some time to myself, so I invented a
job for him. He had a motor bicycle, and I sent him off next morning
for the daily paper, which usually arrived with the post in the
late afternoon. I told him to keep his eyes skinned, and make
note of any strange figures he saw, keeping a special sharp look-out
for motors and aeroplanes. Then I sat down in real earnest to
Scudder’s note-book.</p>

<p>He came back at midday with the <em>Scotsman</em>. There was
nothing in it, except some further evidence of Paddock and the
milkman, and a repetition of yesterday’s statement that the murderer
had gone North. But there was a long article, reprinted from the
<em>Times</em>, about Karolides and the state of affairs in the
Balkans, though there was no mention of any visit to England.
I got rid of the innkeeper for the afternoon, for I was getting
very warm in my search for the cypher.</p>

<p>As I told you, it was a numerical cypher, and by an elaborate
system of experiments I had pretty well discovered what were the
nulls and stops. The trouble was the key word, and when I thought
of the odd million words he might have used I felt pretty hopeless.
But about three o’clock I had a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>The name Julia Czechenyi flashed across my memory. Scudder had
said it was the key to the Karolides business, and it occurred
to me to try it on his cypher.</p>

<p>It worked. The five letters of "Julia" gave me the position of
the vowels. A was J, the tenth letter of the alphabet, and so
represented by X in the cypher. E was U=<em>XXI, </em>and so on.
"Czechenyi’ gave me the numerals for the principal consonants.
I scribbled that scheme on a bit of paper and sat down to read
Scudder’s pages.</p>

<p>In half an hour I was reading with a whitish face and fingers
that drummed on the table.</p>

<p>I glanced out of the window and saw a big touring-car coming
up the glen towards the inn. It drew up at the door, and there
was the sound of people alighting. There seemed to be two of them,
men in aquascutums and tweed caps.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the innkeeper slipped into the room, his eyes
bright with excitement.</p>

<p>"There’s two chaps below looking for you," he whispered. "They’re
in the dining-room having whiskies-and-sodas. They asked about
you and said they had hoped to meet you here. Oh! and they described
you jolly well, down to your boots and shirt. I told them you
had been here last night and had gone off on a motor bicycle this
morning, and one of the chaps swore like a navvy."</p>

<p>I made him tell me what they looked like. One was a dark-eyed
thin fellow with bushy eyebrows, the other was always smiling
and lisped in his talk. Neither was any kind of foreigner; on
this my young friend was positive.</p>

<p>I took a bit of paper and wrote these words in German as if they
were part of a letter—</p>

<p>... "Black Stone. Scudder had got on to this, but he could not
act for a fortnight. I doubt if I can do any good now, especially
as Karolides is uncertain about his plans. But if Mr T. advises
I will do the best I...."</p>

<p>I manufactured it rather neatly, so that it looked like a loose
page of a private letter.</p>

<p>"Take this down and say it was found in my bedroom, and ask them
to return it to me if they overtake me."</p>

<p>Three minutes later I heard the car begin to move, and peeping
from behind the curtain caught sight of the two figures. One was
slim, the other was sleek; that was the most I could make of my
reconnaissance.</p>

<p>The innkeeper appeared in great excitement. "Your paper woke
them up," he said gleefully. "The dark fellow went as white as
death and cursed like blazes, and the fat one whistled and looked
ugly. They paid for their drinks with half-a-sovereign and wouldn’t
wait for change."</p>

<p>"Now I’ll tell you what I want you to do," I said. "Get on your
bicycle and go off to Newton-Stewart to the Chief Constable. Describe
the two men, and say you suspect them of having had something
to do with the London murder. You can invent reasons. The two
will come back, never fear. Not tonight, for they’ll follow me
forty miles along the road, but first thing tomorrow morning.
Tell the police to be here bright and early."</p>

<p>He set off like a docile child, while I worked at Scudder’s notes.
When he came back we dined together, and in common decency I had
to let him pump me. I gave him a lot of stuff about lion hunts
and the Matabele War, thinking all the while what tame businesses
these were compared to this I was now engaged in! When he went
to bed I sat up and finished Scudder. I smoked in a chair till
daylight, for I could not sleep.</p>

<p>About eight next morning I witnessed the arrival of two constables
and a sergeant. They put their car in a coach-house under the
innkeeper’s instructions, and entered the house. Twenty minutes
later I saw from my window a second car come across the plateau
from the opposite direction. It did not come up to the inn, but
stopped two hundred yards off in the shelter of a patch of wood.
I noticed that its occupants carefully reversed it before leaving
it. A minute or two later I heard their steps on the gravel outside
the window.</p>

<p>My plan had been to lie hid in my bedroom, and see what happened.
I had a notion that, if I could bring the police and my other
more dangerous pursuers together, something might work out of
it to my advantage. But now I had a better idea. I scribbled a
line of thanks to my host, opened the window, and dropped quietly
into a gooseberry bush. Unobserved I crossed the dyke, crawled
down the side of a tributary burn, and won the highroad on the
far side of the patch of trees. There stood the car, very spick
and span in the morning sunlight, but with the dust on her which
told of a long journey. I started her, jumped into the chauffeur’s
seat, and stole gently out on to the plateau.</p>

<p>Almost at once the road dipped so that I lost sight of the inn,
but the wind seemed to bring me the sound of angry voices.</p>
