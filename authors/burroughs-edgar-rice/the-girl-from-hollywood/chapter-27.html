<p>Federal officers, searching the hills found the camp above Jackknife
Cañon. They collected a number of empty bottles bearing labels
identical with those on the bottles in the cases carried by the
burros, and those found in Custer Pennington’s room. That was all they
discovered, except that the camp was located on the Pennington property.
</p>
<p>The district attorney, realizing the paucity of evidence calculated to
convict the prisoner on any serious charge, was inclined to drop the
prosecution; but the prohibition enforcement agents, backed by a band
of women, most of whom had never performed a woman’s first duty to the
state and society, and therefore had ample time to meddle in affairs
far beyond the scope of their intellects, seized upon the prominence
of the Pennington name to gain notoriety for themselves on the score
that the conviction of a member of a prominent family would have an
excellent moral effect upon the community at large.
</p><p>Just how they arrived at this conclusion it is difficult to discern.
Similarly one might argue that if it could be proved that the Pope was
a pickpocket, it would be tremendously effective in regenerating the
morals of the world.
</p><p>Be that as it may, the works of the righteous were not without fruit,
for on the 12th of October Custer Pennington was found guilty and
sentenced to six months in the county jail for having had several
hundred dollars’ worth of stolen whisky in his possession. He was
neither surprised nor disheartened. His only concern was for the
sensibilities of his family, and these--represented at the trial in the
person of his father--seemed far from overwhelmed, for the colonel was
unalterably convinced of his son’s innocence.
</p><p>Eva, who had remained at home with her mother, was more deeply affected
than the others, though through a sense of injustice rather than of
shame. Shannon, depressed by an unwarranted sense of responsibility
for the wrong that Custer had suffered, and chagrined that force of
circumstances should have prevented her from saving the Penningtons
from a stain upon their escutcheon, found it increasingly difficult to
continue her intimacy with these loved friends. Carrying in her heart
the knowledge and the proof of his innocence, she regarded herself as a
traitor among them, and in consequence held herself more and more aloof
from their society, first upon one pretext and then upon another.
</p><p>At a loss to account for her change toward them, Eva, in a moment of
depression, attributed it to the disgrace of Custer’s imprisonment.
</p><p>“She is ashamed to associate with the family of a--a--jailbird!” she
cried.
</p><p>“I don’t believe anything of the kind,” replied the colonel. “Shannon’s
got too much sense, and she’s too loyal. That’s all damned poppycock!”
</p><p>“I’m sure she couldn’t feel that way,” said Mrs. Pennington. “She has
been just as positive in her assertions of Custer’s innocence as any of
us.”
</p><p>“You might as well think the same about Guy,” said the colonel. “He’s
scarcely been up here since Custer’s arrest.”
</p><p>“He’s very busy on a new story. Anyway, I asked him about that very
thing, and offered to break the engagement if he felt our disgrace too
keenly to want to marry into the family.”
</p><p>The colonel drew her down to his knee.
</p><p>“You silly little girl!” he said. “Do you suppose that this has made
any difference in the affection that Guy or any other of our real
friends feel for us? Not in the slightest. Even if Cus were guilty,
they would not change. Those who did we would be better off not to
know. I am rather jealous of the Pennington honor myself, but I have
never felt that this affair is any reflection upon it, and you need
not.”
</p><p>“But I can’t help it, popsy. My brother, my dear brother, in jail with
a lot of thieves and murderers and horrible people like that! It is
just too awful! I lie awake at night thinking about it. I am ashamed to
go to the village, for fear some one will point at me and say, ‘There
goes the girl whose brother is in jail!’”
</p><p>“You are taking it much too hard, dear,” said her mother. “One would
think that our boy was really guilty.”
</p><p>“Oh, if he really were, I should kill myself!”
</p><p>The only person, other than the officious reformers, to derive any
happiness from young Pennington’s fate was Slick Allen. He occupied
a cell not far from Custer’s, and there were occasions when they
were thrown together. Several times Allen saw fit to fling gibes at
his former employer, much to the amusement of his fellows. They were
usually indirect.
</p><p>One day, as Custer was passing, Allen remarked in a loud tone:
</p><p>“There’s a lot more of these damn fox-trottin’ dudes that put on airs,
but ain’t nothin’ but common thieves!”
</p><p>Pennington turned and faced him.
</p><p>“You remember what you got the last time you tried calling me names,
Allen? Well, don’t think for a minute that just because we’re in
jail I won’t hand you the same thing again some day, if you get too
funny. The trouble with you, Allen, is that you are laboring under the
misapprehension that you are a humorist. You’re not, and if I were you
I wouldn’t make faces at the only man in this jail who knows about you,
and Bartolo, and--Gracial. Don’t forget Gracial!”
</p><p>Allen paled, and his eyes closed to two very narrow slits. He made no
more observations concerning Pennington; but he devoted much thought
to him, trying to arrive at some reasonable explanation of the man’s
silence, when it was evident that he must have sufficient knowledge of
the guilt of others to clear himself of the charge upon which he had
been convicted.
</p><p>To Allen’s hatred of Custer was now added a real fear, for he had been
present when Bartolo killed Gracial. The other two witnesses had been
Mexicans, and Allen had no doubt but that if Bartolo were accused, the
three of them would swear that the American committed the murder.
</p><p>One of the first things to do, when he was released from jail, would
be to do away with Bartolo. Bartolo disposed of, the other witnesses
would join with Allen to lay the guilt upon the departed. Such pleasant
thoughts occupied the time and mind of Slick Allen, as did also his
plans for paying one Wilson Crumb a little debt he felt due this
one-time friend.
</p><p>Nor was Crumb free from apprehension for the time that would see
Allen’s jail sentence fulfilled. He well knew the nature of the man.
It is typical of drug addicts to disregard the effect of their acts
further than the immediate serving of their own interests, and the
director had encompassed Allen’s arrest merely to meet the emergency of
the moment. Later, as time gave him the opportunity to consider what
must inevitably follow Allen’s release, he began to take thought as to
means whereby he might escape the just deserts of his treachery.
</p><p>He knew enough of Allen’s activities to send the man to a Federal
prison for a long term, but these matters he could not divulge without
equally incriminating himself. There was, however, one little item of
Allen’s past which might be used against him without signal danger to
Crumb, and that was the murder of Gracial. It would not be necessary
for Crumb to appear in the matter at all. An anonymous letter to the
police would suffice to direct suspicion of the crime toward Allen, and
to insure for Crumb, if not permanent immunity, at least a period of
reprieve.
</p><p>With the natural predilection of the weak for avoiding or delaying the
consummation of their intentions, Crumb postponed the writing of this
letter of accusation. There was no cause for hurry, he argued, since
Allen’s time would not expire until the 6th of the following August.
</p><p>Crumb led a lonely life after the departure of Gaza. His infatuation
for the girl had as closely approximated love as a creature of his
type could reach. He had come to depend upon her, and to look forward
to finding her at the Vista del Paso bungalow on his return from the
studio. Since her departure his evenings had been unbearable, and with
the passing weeks he developed a hatred for the place that constantly
reminded him of his loss. He had been so confident that she would have
to return to him after she had consumed the small quantity of morphine
he had allotted her that only after the weeks had run into months did
he realize that she had probably gone out of his life forever. How she
had accomplished it he could not understand, unless she had found means
of obtaining the narcotic elsewhere.
</p><p>Not knowing where she had gone, he had no means of searching for her.
In his own mind, however, he was convinced that she must have returned
to Los Angeles. Judging others by himself, he could conceive of no
existence that would be supportable beyond the limits of a large city,
where the means for the gratification of his vice might be obtained.
</p><p>That Gaza de Lure had successfully thrown off the fetters into which he
had tricked her never for a moment entered his calculations. Finally,
however, it was borne in upon him that there was little likelihood of
her returning; and so depressing had become the familiar and suggestive
furnishings of the Vista del Paso bungalow that he at last gave it up,
stored his furniture, and took a room at a local hotel. He took with
him, carefully concealed in a trunk, his supply of narcotics--which
he did not find it so easy to dispose of since the departure of his
accomplice.
</p><p>During the first picture in which Grace Evans had worked with him,
Crumb had become more and more impressed with her beauty and the subtle
charm of her refinement, which appealed to him by contrast with the
ordinary surroundings and personalities of the K. K. S. studio. There
was a quiet restfulness about her which soothed his diseased nerves,
and after Gaza’s desertion he found himself more and more seeking her
society. As was his accustomed policy, his attentions were at first so
slight, and increased by such barely perceptible degrees, that, taken
in connection with his uniform courtesy, they gave the girl no warning
of his ultimate purposes.
</p><p>The matter of the test had shocked and disgusted her for the moment;
but the thing having been done, and no harm coming from it, she began
to consider even that with less revulsion than formerly. The purpose of
it she had never been able to fathom; but if Crumb had intended it to
place him insidiously upon a plane of greater intimacy with the girl,
he had succeeded. That the effect was subjective rendered it none the
less effective.
</p><p>Added to these factors in the budding intimacy between the director and
the extra girl was the factor which is always most potent in similar
associations--the fear that the girl holds of offending a potent ally,
and the hope of propitiating a power in which lies the potentiality of
success upon the screen.
</p><p>Lunches at Frank’s, dinners at the Ship, dances at the Country Club,
led by easy gradations to more protracted parties at the Sunset
Inn and the Green Mill. The purposes of Crumb’s shrewdly conceived
and carefully executed plan were twofold. Primarily, he sought a
companionship to replace that of which Gaza de Lure had robbed him.
Secondarily, he needed a new tool to assist in the disposal of the
considerable store of narcotics that he had succeeded in tricking Allen
and his accomplices into delivering to him with the understanding that
he would divide the profits of the sales with them--which, however,
Crumb had no intention of doing if he could possibly avoid it.
</p><p>In much the same manner that he had tricked Gaza de Lure, he tricked
Grace Evans into the use of cocaine; and after that the rest was easy.
Renting another and less pretentious bungalow on Circle Terrace, he
installed the girl there, and transferred the trunk of narcotics to her
care, retaining his room at the hotel for himself.
</p><p>Grace’s fall was more easily accomplished than in the case of Gaza,
and was more complete, for the former had neither the courage nor the
strength of character that had enabled the other to withstand the
more degrading advances of her tempter. To assume that the girl made
no effort to oppose his importunings would be both unfair and unjust,
for both heredity and training had endowed her with a love of honor
and a horror of the sordidness of vice; but the gradual undermining of
her will by the subtle inroads of narcotics rendered her powerless to
withstand the final assault upon the citadel of her scruples.
</p><p>One evening, toward the middle of October, they were dining together
at the Winter Garden. Crumb had bought an evening paper on the street,
and was glancing through it as they sat waiting for their dinner to be
served. Presently he looked up at the girl seated opposite him.
</p><p>“Didn’t you come from a little jerk-water place up the line, called
Ganado?” he asked.
</p><p>She nodded affirmatively.
</p><p>“Why?”
</p><p>“Here’s a guy from there been sent up for bootlegging--fellow by the
name of Pennington.”
</p><p>She half closed her eyes, as if in pain.
</p><p>“I know,” she said. “It has been in the newspapers for the last couple
of weeks.”
</p><p>“Did you know him?”
</p><p>“Yes--he has been out to see me since his arrest, and he called up
once.”
</p><p>“Did you see him?”
</p><p>“No--I would be ashamed to see any decent person!”
</p><p>“Decent!” snorted Crumb. “You don’t call a damned bootlegger decent, do
you?”
</p><p>“I don’t believe he ever did it,” said the girl. “I have known him all
my life, and his family. I’m certain that he couldn’t have done it.”
</p><p>A sudden light came into Crumb’s eye.
</p><p>“By God!” he exclaimed, bringing his fist down upon the table.
</p><p>“What is the matter?” Grace inquired.
</p><p>“Well, wouldn’t that get you?” he exclaimed. “I never connected you at
all!”
</p><p>“What do you mean?”
</p><p>“This fellow Pennington may not be guilty, but I know who is.”
</p><p>“How do you know? I don’t understand you. Why do you look at me that
way?”
</p><p>“Well, if that isn’t the best ever!” exclaimed the man. “And here you
have been handing me a long line of talk about the decent family you
came from, and how it would kill them if they knew you sniffed a little
coke now and then. Well, wouldn’t that get you? You certainly are a
fine one to preach!”
</p><p>“I don’t understand you,” said the girl. “What has this to do with me?
I am not related to Mr. Pennington, but it would make no difference if
I were, for I know he never did anything of the sort. The idea of a
Pennington bootlegging! Why, they have more money than they need, and
always have had.”
</p><p>“It isn’t Pennington who ought to be in jail,” he said. “It’s your
brother.”
</p><p>She looked at him in surprise, and then she laughed.
</p><p>“You must have been hitting it up strong to-day, Wilson,” she said.
</p><p>“Oh, no, I haven’t; but it’s funny I never thought of it before.
Allen told me a long while ago that a fellow by the name of Evans was
handling the hootch for him. He said he got a job from the Penningtons
as stableman in order to be near the camp where they had the stuff
cached in the hills. He described Evans as a young blood, so I guess
there isn’t any doubt about it. You have a brother--I’ve heard you
speak of him.”
</p><p>“I don’t believe you,” she said.
</p><p>“It don’t make any difference whether you believe me or not. I could
put your brother in the pen, and they’ve only got Pennington in the
county jail. All they could get on him, according to this article, was
having stolen goods in his possession; but your brother was in on the
whole proposition. It was hidden in his hay barn. He delivered it to a
fellow who came up there every week, ostensibly to get hay, and your
brother collected the money. Gosh, they’d send him up for sure if I
ever tipped them off to what I know!”
</p><p>And thus was fashioned the power he used to force her to his will.
</p><p>A week later the bungalow on Circle Terrace was engaged, and Grace
Evans took up the work of peddling narcotics, which Shannon Burke had
laid down a few months before. With this difference--Gaza de Lure had
shared in the profits of the traffic, while Grace Evans got nothing
more than her living, and what drugs she craved for her personal use.
</p><p>Her life, her surroundings, every environment of this new and terrible
world into which her ambition had introduced her, tended rapidly to
ravish her beauty. She faded with a rapidity that was surprising even
to Crumb--surprising and annoying. He had wanted her for her beauty,
and now she was losing it; but still he must keep her, because of her
value in his nefarious commerce.
</p><p>As weeks and months went by, he no longer took pleasure in her
society, and was seldom at the bungalow save when he came to demand
an accounting and to collect the proceeds of her sales. Her pleas and
reproaches had no other effect upon him than to arouse his anger. One
day, when she clung to him, begging him not to desert her, he pushed
her roughly from him so that she fell, and in falling she struck the
edge of a table and hurt herself.
</p><p>This happened in April. On the following day Custer Pennington, his
term in the county jail expired, was liberated.
