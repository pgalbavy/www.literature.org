found only in the Pal&aelig;ozoic rocks, and most abundantly in those
of Silurian age.

<DD>  An order of plants in which the
flowers, which contain five stamens and a pistil with two styles, are
supported upon footstalks which spring from the top of the flower stem
and spread out like the wires of an umbrella, so as to bring all the
flowers in the same head (<I>umbel</I>) nearly to
the same level. (<I>Examples</I>, Parsley and
Carrot).

cases of a backbone composed of numerous joints or <I>vertebroe</I>,
which constitutes the centre of the skeleton and at the same time
supports and protects the central parts of the nervous system.

<DD>  In many of the lower animals (such as the
Corals, Medus&aelig;, &amp;c.) reproduction takes place in two ways,
namely, by means of eggs and by a process of budding with or without
separation from the parent of the product of the latter, which is
often very different from that of the egg.  The individuality of the
species is represented by the whole of the form produced between two
sexual reproductions; and these forms, which are apparently individual
animals, have been called <I>zooids</I>.
