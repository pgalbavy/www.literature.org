<p>It was singular that the youngest member of the cattlemen should
make an important discovery, which not only escaped them, but,
as subsequent events proved, was not noticed, or at least did
not receive due attention from the Comanches themselves.</p>

<p>Avon Burnet, from his place on the crest of elevation, was watching
the interview between Gleeson and the two red men, when he awoke
to the fact that the ridge joined and formed a part of the hills
among which the Comanches had taken refuge. That is to say, one
had only to follow the former to reach the broken swell containing
the warriors and their prisoner.</p>

<p>If such a ride were made along the right slope, the person must
be in plain sight of the Indians; if along the crest, he would
be visible to those on the right and left, and, if along the left
slope, the cowboys could see him while he would not be perceived
by the red men themselves, unless they were on the watch.</p>

<p>These facts were apparent to Avon at the first sweeping glance
he cast to the eastward. He wondered that they escaped the notice
of his friends, but this was probably due to their attention being
diverted for the time by the cattle, and because, too, of their
disposition to wait the report of Gleeson before deciding upon
their course of action.</p>

<p>The thought instantly came to Avon that if the cowboys would
make a sudden break along the base of the slope to the left, they
could reach the rear of the Comanches, always provided the latter
had taken no precautions against such a flank movement. The plan
of campaign was so inviting that he could hardly believe it had
been overlooked by the red men. At any rate, before urging his
friends to adopt it, he decided to make a little investigation
on his own account, especially as he believed sufficient time
was at command.</p>

<p>Riding, therefore, to the bottom of the slope, he spurred Thunderbolt
to a sharp gait, and quickly covered the intervening space, which
was hardly a fourth of a mile. His mustang showed no ill effects
from the slight wounds received during the sharp scrimmage some
time before.</p>

<p>Avon was well aware of the risk he ran, for, if the Comanches
were maintaining guard, they could readily pick him off before
he could withdraw or adopt the least precaution, but he did not
hesitate. When the ground became more broken, he urged his pony
a short way among the hills, and then dismounted. He did this,
because he wished to hold his line of retreat open. The way behind
him was clear, whereas, if he took his horse further, the course
would become so obstructed that he could not mount and dash out
upon the plain if it became necessary.</p>

<p>He expected to make a long and tedious search, with the probable
result of failure, so far as helping his relative was concerned,
and with the certainty of great danger to himself, but events
moved along with a rush, before he could anticipate them.</p>

<p>Convinced that he was to the rear of the main party, he advanced
with the utmost care. The hills were no more than a hundred feet
high at their greatest elevation, and were broken by gullies,
ravines, and trails that appeared to have been partly made by
the feet of animals, greatly helped by the washing of the severe
storms which often sweep over that section.</p>

<p>The youth had penetrated barely a hundred yards from the point
where he left his mustang, and was picking his way cautiously
forward, when he was startled by hearing voices. The words were
too low for him to distinguish them, but he instantly stopped
with his Winchester ready for use. A collision seemed unavoidable,
since there was no means of concealing himself except by turning
about and running back, and that could hardly avail him.</p>

<p>The next minute he was face to face with Shackaye, the young
Comanche that was the cause of all the trouble. The fellow was
as much startled as he, and stopping short, partly raised his
gun, as if to defend himself.</p>

<p>Before, however, either could speak or make any movements, Avon
was astounded to catch sight of his uncle, Captain Shirril, walking
slowly and evidently in pain, close behind him along the narrow
path. The instant he descried his nephew, he raised his hand as
a signal for him to do nothing.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he said, in a guarded voice; "Shackaye is our
friend, though he hasn't been until now."</p>

<p>"How is this?" asked the youth, motionless and undecided whether
to advance or retreat.</p>

<p>The broad face of the dusky youth expanded with a slight grin,
and he replied:</p>

<p>"Shackaye fall on ground&mdash;Baby shoot steer &mdash;Shackaye tell
warriors Baby dead&mdash;leaving him alone&mdash;bringing way captain&mdash;den
Shackaye show captain way home&mdash;must hurry &mdash;Comanche come!"</p>

<p>"Have you a horse with you?" asked Captain Shirril, crowding
forward, impatient to improve the precious moments.</p>

<p>"Yes; follow me."</p>

<p>The prisoner had been deprived of all his weapons, and was suffering
from the severe hurts received, but he roused himself and moved
forward at a brisk walk, Avon taking the lead, with the young
Indian close behind him and the captain at his heels.</p>

<p>Very few minutes were required to pass over the intervening space,
but while doing so Captain Shirril made clear several facts which
needed explanation. To these may be added others that came to
light afterward.</p>

<p>As has been intimated elsewhere, the suspicions of Gleeson regarding
Shackaye were correct. He had joined the cattlemen for the purpose
of helping Wygwind and his band to despoil them. He was unable
to do this at the time the cabin was attacked, and therefore kept
in the background until the present opportunity presented itself.
The intention of the Comanches, as first formed, was to stampede
the animals on some favorable night, and thus secure possession
of a large number; but there was great risk in the attempt, since
the cowboys were watchful, and the cattle being branded, it would
have been almost impossible for the thieves to dispose of them,
even if able to run them beyond reach of their owners. The Great
Cattle Trail is about a hundred yards in width, with smaller paths
weaving in and out along the edges, all so distinctly marked that
no one can go astray, unless the path is temporarily obliterated
by snow. The diversion of a considerable number of cattle would
leave footprints that could be readily followed, and Captain Dohm
Shirril was not the man to submit to such despoilment, so long
as there remained the possibility of preventing it.</p>

<p>The Comanches, however, in the vicinity of the herd kept track
of all its movements. The cunning Shackaye succeeded in holding
occasional communication with them, and learned of their change
of plan. It was decided to make the captain prisoner on the first
opportunity, and hold him for ransom.</p>

<p>Since it was his practice to take his nephew with him on almost
every excursion he made from camp, Shackaye conceived it necessary
to the success of the plot that Avon should be put out of the
way. It has been shown that he made the attempt on the preceding
night and came within a hair of success. It was characteristic
of his race that the atrocious crime was undertaken by him as
a matter of course.</p>

<p>The very chance for which Wygwind and his band were waiting came
that morning when Captain Shirril, his nephew, and Shackaye set
out to hunt the estray cattle. While Avon was engaged in conquering
the troublesome steer, with the captain attentively watching him,
Shackaye remounted his horse, from which he had been thrown, and
made all haste to the hills.</p>

<p>Wygwind and his warriors were ready, and indeed met him on his
way thither. He took no part in the fight, but watched it from
his refuge. When the last desperate struggle took place he spurred
forward and joined the assailants.</p>

<p>The intention of the Comanches had been to shoot down Avon, but
to spare his uncle, and it was curious that the very opposite
result was effected. It was impossible that Captain Shirril should
escape in the mêlée, though his foes meant only to shoot down
the horses and slay his companion.</p>

<p>Shackaye arrived at the critical moment, when the helpless leader
was being lifted upon the horse of Wygwind in front of him, and
Avon lay senseless beneath the body of the mustang. The fact that
Thunderbolt was still lying on the ground bleeding from his two
flesh wounds led to the belief that he was mortally hurt, and
no effort, therefore, was made to take him away.</p>

<p>Despite the savage nature of Shackaye, a feeling of gratitude
had been roused within him by the act of Avon in saving him from
the enraged steer. Whether the white youth was already dead or
not he did not know, but he interposed a vigorous plea that no
further harm should be done him. He had performed his own part
so well that his prayers had some effect, while the necessity
for urgent haste in leaving before the arrival of the cowboys,
who were coming over the ridge, led to the flight of the whole
party of Comanches without harming a hair of his head.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that none of the warriors could
hold any suspicion of Shackaye's loyalty toward them and their
interests. When, therefore, the time came for the opening of the
negotiations with the cowboys, the wounded and unarmed captain
was left in charge of Shackaye, while the others went forward
and maintained their places within reach of Wygwind and Richita,
during their interview with Gleeson. This was simply prudence
on their part, since they knew there was the best reason for believing
the whites would instantly seize any advantage offered them.</p>

<p>Captain Shirril now did an exceedingly clever thing. He saw it
was useless to appeal to Shackaye's kindly feelings toward himself,
but he had noticed his vigorous efforts to save his nephew from
harm, when he lay senseless under the body of the mustang. He
saw that, despite the villainous nature of the youth, he entertained
a strong regard for Avon, and upon that regard he wrought, by
representing the sorrow that would come to him, if his uncle suffered
further. He knew his heart would be broken and he could never,
never recover from his woe.</p>

<p>To Shackaye's reply that the chief Wygwind meant to allow the
friends of the prisoner to buy him back, Captain Shirril dwelt
upon the impossibility of such a thing. He pressed his view of
the case with such vigor that Shackaye, influenced alone by his
gratitude to Avon, agreed to conduct the captain out of the hills,
where he could make his way to camp undetected, provided the interview
between Wygwind and the Texan was not ended in time for the Comanches
to discover what had been done.</p>

<p>It need not be said that Captain Shirril seized the opportunity
thus offered, and began limping forward, behind his guide, who
encountered Avon Burnet a few minutes later.</p>

<p>The expectation was that Shackaye would return to camp with his
two friends, since he would be assured of good treatment despite
his former unfaithfulness, and especially since it was unsafe
for him to remain among those to whom he could never justify his
course of action. But after the captain was assisted on the back
of Thunderbolt, and his nephew took his place, so as to help him
in keeping his seat, the young Comanche obstinately refused.</p>

<p>They tarried to urge him to save his life by such a course, but
he ended the argument by abruptly turning about and hurrying along
the path, where he speedily vanished.</p>

<p>"There's no use of waiting," said the captain, starting Thunderbolt
forward; "I can't understand his obduracy."</p>

<p>"He must be afraid of our men."</p>

<p>"But he knows the danger is a thousandfold greater among his
own people&mdash;hark!"</p>

<p>The sharp report of a rifle rang among the hills behind them,
accompanied by a wild cry of mortal pain.</p>

<p>"He has paid with his life for his friendship!" whispered the
captain, instantly spurring up Thunderbolt to a dead run.</p>

<p>Such was the truth. Shackaye could offer no excuse for what he
had done, nor did he attempt to do so. His act was discovered
sooner than he anticipated, and he died at the hands of the infuriated
chieftain Wygwind, before those whom he had saved were beyond
reach of the sound which told of the completion of the tragedy.</p>

<p>The Comanches attempted pursuit, but the start obtained by the
fugitives, brief as it was, sufficed, and they had not ridden
far when they met the whole band of cowboys galloping to their
defence. Gleeson and his comrades would have been glad had the
red men ventured out upon the plain beyond the shelter of the
hills, but Wygwind and his warriors were too wise to do so.</p>
