<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p> Mr. Van Wyk, the white man of Batu Beru, an ex-naval officer
who, for reasons best known to himself, had thrown away the promise
of a brilliant career to become the pioneer of tobacco-planting
on that remote part of the coast, had learned to like Captain
Whalley. The appearance of the new skipper had attracted his attention.
Nothing more unlike all the diverse types he had seen succeeding
each other on the bridge of the Sofala could be imagined.</p>

<p>At that time Batu Beru was not what it has become since: the
center of a prosperous tobacco-growing district, a tropically
suburban-looking little settlement of bungalows in one long street
shaded with two rows of trees, embowered by the flowering and
trim luxuriance of the gardens, with a three-mile-long carriage-road
for the afternoon drives and a first-class Resident with a fat,
cheery wife to lead the society of married estate-managers and
unmarried young fellows in the service of the big companies.</p>

<p>All this prosperity was not yet; and Mr. Van Wyk prospered alone
on the left bank on his deep clearing carved out of the forest,
which came down above and below to the water’s edge. His lonely
bungalow faced across the river the houses of the Sultan: a restless
and melancholy old ruler who had done with love and war, for whom
life no longer held any savor (except of evil forebodings) and
time never had any value. He was afraid of death, and hoped he
would die before the white men were ready to take his country
from him. He crossed the river frequently (with never less than
ten boats crammed full of people), in the wistful hope of extracting
some information on the subject from his own white man. There
was a certain chair on the veranda he always took: the dignitaries
of the court squatted on the rugs and skins between the furniture:
the inferior people remained below on the grass plot between the
house and the river in rows three or four deep all along the front.
Not seldom the visit began at daybreak. Mr. Van Wyk tolerated
these inroads. He would nod out of his bedroom window, tooth-brush
or razor in hand, or pass through the throng of courtiers in his
bathing robe. He appeared and disappeared humming a tune, polished
his nails with attention, rubbed his shaved face with <em>eau-de-Cologne</em>,
drank his early tea, went out to see his coolies at work: returned,
looked through some papers on his desk, read a page or two in
a book or sat before his cottage piano leaning back on the stool,
his arms extended, fingers on the keys, his body swaying slightly
from side to side. When absolutely forced to speak he gave evasive
vaguely soothing answers out of pure compassion: the same feeling
perhaps made him so lavishly hospitable with the aerated drinks
that more than once he left himself without soda-water for a whole
week. That old man had granted him as much land as he cared to
have cleared: it was neither more nor less than a fortune.</p>

<p>Whether it was fortune or seclusion from his kind that Mr. Van
Wyk sought, he could not have pitched upon a better place. Even
the mail-boats of the subsidized company calling on the veriest
clusters of palm-thatched hovels along the coast steamed past
the mouth of Batu Beru river far away in the offing. The contract
was old: perhaps in a few years’ time, when it had expired, Batu
Beru would be included in the service; meantime all Mr. Van Wyk’s
mail was addressed to Malacca, whence his agent sent it across
once a month by the Sofala. It followed that whenever Massy had
run short of money (through taking too many lottery tickets),
or got into a difficulty about a skipper, Mr. Van Wyk was deprived
of his letter and newspapers. In so far he had a personal interest
in the fortunes of the Sofala. Though he considered himself a
hermit (and for no passing whim evidently, since he had stood
eight years of it already), he liked to know what went on in the
world.</p>

<p>Handy on the veranda upon a walnut <em>etagere</em> (it had come
last year by the Sofala)&mdash;everything came by the Sofala there
lay, piled up under bronze weights, a pile of the Times’ weekly
edition, the large sheets of the Rotterdam Courant, the Graphic
in its world-wide green wrappers, an illustrated Dutch publication
without a cover, the numbers of a German magazine with covers
of the "<em>Bismarck malade</em>" color. There were also parcels
of new music&mdash;though the piano (it had come years ago by the Sofala
in the damp atmosphere of the forests was generally out of tune.)
It was vexing to be cut off from everything for sixty days at
a stretch sometimes, without any means of knowing what was the
matter. And when the Sofala reappeared Mr. Van Wyk would descend
the steps of the veranda and stroll over the grass plot in front
of his house, down to the waterside, with a frown on his white
brow.</p>

<p>"You’ve been laid up after an accident, I presume."</p>

<p>He addressed the bridge, but before anybody could answer Massy
was sure to have already scrambled ashore over the rail and pushed
in, squeezing the palms of his hands together, bowing his sleek
head as if gummed all over the top with black threads and tapes.
And he would be so enraged at the necessity of having to offer
such an explanation that his moaning would be positively pitiful,
while all the time he tried to compose his big lips into a smile.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Van Wyk. You would not believe it. I couldn’t get one
of those wretches to take the ship out. Not a single one of the
lazy beasts could be induced, and the law, you know, Mr. Van Wyk
. . ."</p>

<p>He moaned at great length apologetically; the words conspiracy,
plot, envy, came out prominently, whined with greater energy.
Mr. Van Wyk, examining with a faint grimace his polished finger-nails,
would say, "H’m. Very unfortunate," and turn his back on him.</p>

<p>Fastidious, clever, slightly skeptical, accustomed to the best
society (he had held a much-envied shore appointment at the Ministry
of Marine for a year preceding his retreat from his profession
and from Europe), he possessed a latent warmth of feeling and
a capacity for sympathy which were concealed by a sort of haughty,
arbitrary indifference of manner arising from his early training;
and by a something an enemy might have called foppish, in his
aspect&mdash;like a distorted echo of past elegance. He managed to
keep an almost military discipline amongst the coolies of the
estate he had dragged into the light of day out of the tangle
and shadows of the jungle; and the white shirt he put on every
evening with its stiff glossy front and high collar looked as
if he had meant to preserve the decent ceremony of evening-dress,
but had wound a thick crimson sash above his hips as a concession
to the wilderness, once his adversary, now his vanquished companion.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was a hygienic precaution. Worn wide open in front,
a short jacket of some airy silken stuff floated from his shoulders.
His fluffy, fair hair, thin at the top, curled slightly at the
sides; a carefully arranged mustache, an ungarnished forehead,
the gleam of low patent shoes peeping under the wide bottom of
trowsers cut straight from the same stuff as the gossamer coat,
completed a figure recalling, with its sash, a pirate chief of
romance, and at the same time the elegance of a slightly bald
dandy indulging, in seclusion, a taste for unorthodox costume.</p>

<p>It was his evening get-up. The proper time for the Sofala to
arrive at Batu Beru was an hour before sunset, and he looked picturesque,
and somehow quite correct too, walking at the water’s edge on
the background of grass slope crowned with a low long bungalow
with an immensely steep roof of palm thatch, and clad to the eaves
in flowering creepers. While the Sofala was being made fast he
strolled in the shade of the few trees left near the landing-place,
waiting till he could go on board. Her white men were not of his
kind. The old Sultan (though his wistful invasions were a nuisance)
was really much more acceptable to his fastidious taste. But still
they were white; the periodical visits of the ship made a break
in the well-filled sameness of the days without disturbing his
privacy. Moreover, they were necessary from a business point of
view; and through a strain of preciseness in his nature he was
irritated when she failed to appear at the appointed time.</p>

<p>The cause of the irregularity was too absurd, and Massy, in his
opinion, was a contemptible idiot. The first time the Sofala reappeared
under the new agreement swinging out of the bend below, after
he had almost given up all hope of ever seeing her again, he felt
so angry that he did not go down at once to the landing-place.
His servants had come running to him with the news, and he had
dragged a chair close against the front rail of the veranda, spread
his elbows out, rested his chin on his hands, and went on glaring
at her fixedly while she was being made fast opposite his house.
He could make out easily all the white faces on board. Who on
earth was that kind of patriarch they had got there on the bridge
now?</p>

<p>At last he sprang up and walked down the gravel path. It was
a fact that the very gravel for his paths had been imported by
the Sofala. Exasperated out of his quiet superciliousness, without
looking at anyone right or left, he accosted Massy straightway
in so determined a manner that the engineer, taken aback, began
to stammer unintelligibly. Nothing could be heard but the words:
"Mr. Van Wyk . . . Indeed, Mr. Van Wyk . . . For the future, Mr.
Van Wyk"&mdash;and by the suffusion of blood Massy’s vast bilious face
acquired an unnatural orange tint, out of which the disconcerted
coal-black eyes shone in an extraordinary manner.</p>

<p>"Nonsense. I am tired of this. I wonder you have the impudence
to come alongside my jetty as if I had it made for your convenience
alone."</p>

<p>Massy tried to protest earnestly. Mr. Van Wyk was very angry.
He had a good mind to ask that German firm&mdash;those people in Malacca&mdash;what
was their name?&mdash;boats with green funnels. They would be only
too glad of the opening to put one of their small steamers on
the run. Yes; Schnitzler, Jacob Schnitzler, would in a moment.
Yes. He had decided to write without delay.</p>

<p>In his agitation Massy caught up his falling pipe.</p>

<p>"You don’t mean it, sir!" he shrieked.</p>

<p>"You shouldn’t mismanage your business in this ridiculous manner."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk turned on his heel. The other three whites on the
bridge had not stirred during the scene. Massy walked hastily
from side to side, puffed out his cheeks, suffocated.</p>

<p>"Stuck up Dutchman!"</p>

<p>And he moaned out feverishly a long tale of griefs. The efforts
he had made for all these years to please that man. This was the
return you got for it, eh? Pretty. Write to Schnitzler&mdash;let in
the green-funnel boats&mdash;get an old Hamburg Jew to ruin him. No,
really he could laugh. . . . He laughed sobbingly. . . . Ha! ha!
ha! And make him carry the letter in his own ship presumably.</p>

<p>He stumbled across a grating and swore. He would not hesitate
to fling the Dutchman’s correspondence overboard&mdash;the whole confounded
bundle. He had never, never made any charge for that accommodation.
But Captain Whalley, his new partner, would not let him probably;
besides, it would be only putting off the evil day. For his own
part he would make a hole in the water rather than look on tamely
at the green funnels overrunning his trade.</p>

<p>He raved aloud. The China boys hung back with the dishes at the
foot of the ladder. He yelled from the bridge down at the deck,
"Aren’t we going to have any chow this evening at all?" then turned
violently to Captain Whalley, who waited, grave and patient, at
the head of the table, smoothing his beard in silence now and
then with a forbearing gesture.</p>

<p>"You don’t seem to care what happens to me. Don’t you see that
this affects your interests as much as mine? It’s no joking matter."</p>

<p>He took the foot of the table growling between his teeth.</p>

<p>"Unless you have a few thousands put away somewhere. I haven’t."</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk dined in his thoroughly lit-up bungalow, putting
a point of splendor in the night of his clearing above the dark
bank of the river. Afterwards he sat down to his piano, and in
a pause he became aware of slow footsteps passing on the path
along the front. A plank or two creaked under a heavy tread; he
swung half round on the music-stool, listening with his fingertips
at rest on the keyboard. His little terrier barked violently,
backing in from the veranda. A deep voice apologized gravely for
"this intrusion." He walked out quickly.</p>

<p>At the head of the steps the patriarchal figure, who was the
new captain of the Sofala apparently (he had seen a round dozen
of them, but not one of that sort), towered without advancing.
The little dog barked unceasingly, till a flick of Mr. Van Wyk’s
handkerchief made him spring aside into silence. Captain Whalley,
opening the matter, was met by a punctiliously polite but determined
opposition.</p>

<p>They carried on their discussion standing where they had come
face to face. Mr. Van Wyk observed his visitor with attention.
Then at last, as if forced out of his reserve&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am surprised that you should intercede for such a confounded
fool."</p>

<p>This outbreak was almost complimentary, as if its meaning had
been, "That such a man as you should intercede!" Captain Whalley
let it pass by without flinching. One would have thought he had
heard nothing. He simply went on to state that he was personally
interested in putting things straight between them. Personally
. . .</p>

<p>But Mr. Van Wyk, really carried away by his disgust with Massy,
became very incisive&mdash;</p>

<p>"Indeed&mdash;if I am to be frank with you&mdash;his whole character does
not seem to me particularly estimable or trustworthy . . ."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, always straight, seemed to grow an inch taller
and broader, as if the girth of his chest had suddenly expanded
under his beard.</p>

<p>"My dear sir, you don’t think I came here to discuss a man with
whom I am &mdash;I am&mdash;h’m&mdash;closely associated."</p>

<p>A sort of solemn silence lasted for a moment. He was not used
to asking favors, but the importance he attached to this affair
had made him willing to try. . . . Mr. Van Wyk, favorably impressed,
and suddenly mollified by a desire to laugh, interrupted&mdash;</p>

<p>"That’s all right if you make it a personal matter; but you can
do no less than sit down and smoke a cigar with me."</p>

<p>A slight pause, then Captain Whalley stepped forward heavily.
As to the regularity of the service, for the future he made himself
responsible for it; and his name was Whalley&mdash;perhaps to a sailor
(he was speaking to a sailor, was he not?) not altogether unfamiliar.
There was a lighthouse now, on an island. Maybe Mr. Van Wyk himself
. . .</p>

<p>"Oh yes. Oh indeed." Mr. Van Wyk caught on at once. He indicated
a chair. How very interesting. For his own part he had seen some
service in the last Acheen War, but had never been so far East.
Whalley Island? Of course. Now that was very interesting. What
changes his guest must have seen since.</p>

<p>"I can look further back even&mdash;on a whole half-century."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley expanded a bit. The flavor of a good cigar (it
was a weakness) had gone straight to his heart, also the civility
of that young man. There was something in that accidental contact
of which he had been starved in his years of struggle.</p>

<p>The front wall retreating made a square recess furnished like
a room. A lamp with a milky glass shade, suspended below the slope
of the high roof at the end of a slender brass chain, threw a
bright round of light upon a little table bearing an open book
and an ivory paper-knife. And, in the translucent shadows beyond,
other tables could be seen, a number of easy-chairs of various
shapes, with a great profusion of skin rugs strewn on the teakwood
planking all over the veranda. The flowering creepers scented
the air. Their foliage clipped out between the uprights made as
if several frames of thick unstirring leaves reflecting the lamplight
in a green glow. Through the opening at his elbow Captain Whalley
could see the gangway lantern of the Sofala burning dim by the
shore, the shadowy masses of the town beyond the open lustrous
darkness of the river, and, as if hung along the straight edge
of the projecting eaves, a narrow black strip of the night sky
full of stars&mdash;resplendent. The famous cigar in hand he had a
moment of complacency.</p>

<p>"A trifle. Somebody must lead the way. I just showed that the
thing could be done; but you men brought up to the use of steam
cannot conceive the vast importance of my bit of venturesomeness
to the Eastern trade of the time. Why, that new route reduced
the average time of a southern passage by eleven days for more
than half the year. Eleven days! It’s on record. But the remarkable
thing&mdash;speaking to a sailor &mdash;I should say was . . ."</p>

<p>He talked well, without egotism, professionally. The powerful
voice, produced without effort, filled the bungalow even into
the empty rooms with a deep and limpid resonance, seemed to make
a stillness outside; and Mr. Van Wyk was surprised by the serene
quality of its tone, like the perfection of manly gentleness.
Nursing one small foot, in a silk sock and a patent leather shoe,
on his knee, he was immensely entertained. It was as if nobody
could talk like this now, and the overshadowed eyes, the flowing
white beard, the big frame, the serenity, the whole temper of
the man, were an amazing survival from the prehistoric times of
the world coming up to him out of the sea.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley had been also the pioneer of the early trade
in the Gulf of Pe-tchi-li. He even found occasion to mention that
he had buried his "dear wife" there six-and-twenty years ago.
Mr. Van Wyk, impassive, could not help speculating in his mind
swiftly as to the sort of woman that would mate with such a man.
Did they make an adventurous and well-matched pair? No. Very possible
she had been small, frail, no doubt very feminine&mdash;or most likely
commonplace with domestic instincts, utterly insignificant. But
Captain Whalley was no garrulous bore, and shaking his head as
if to dissipate the momentary gloom that had settled on his handsome
old face, he alluded conversationally to Mr. Van Wyk’s solitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk affirmed that sometimes he had more company than
he wanted. He mentioned smilingly some of the peculiarities of
his intercourse with "My Sultan." He made his visits in force.
Those people damaged his grass plot in front (it was not easy
to obtain some approach to a lawn in the tropics) and the other
day had broken down some rare bushes he had planted over there.
And Captain Whalley remembered immediately that, in ‘forty-seven,
the then Sultan, "this man’s grandfather," had been notorious
as a great protector of the piratical fleets of praus from farther
East. They had a safe refuge in the river at Batu Beru. He financed
more especially a Balinini chief called Haji Daman. Captain Whalley,
nodding significantly his bushy white eyebrows, had very good
reason to know something of that. The world had progressed since
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk demurred with unexpected acrimony. Progressed in
what? he wanted to know.</p>

<p>Why, in knowledge of truth, in decency, in justice, in order&mdash;in
honesty too, since men harmed each other mostly from ignorance.
It was, Captain Whalley concluded quaintly, more pleasant to live
in.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk whimsically would not admit that Mr. Massy, for instance,
was more pleasant naturally than the Balinini pirates.</p>

<p>The river had not gained much by the change. They were in their
way every bit as honest. Massy was less ferocious than Haji Daman
no doubt, but . . .</p>

<p>"And what about you, my good sir?" Captain Whalley laughed a
deep soft laugh. "<em>You</em> are an improvement, surely."</p>

<p>He continued in a vein of pleasantry. A good cigar was better
than a knock on the head&mdash;the sort of welcome he would have found
on this river forty or fifty years ago. Then leaning forward slightly,
he became earnestly serious. It seems as if, outside their own
sea-gypsy tribes, these rovers had hated all mankind with an incomprehensible,
bloodthirsty hatred. Meantime their depredations had been stopped,
and what was the consequence? The new generation was orderly,
peaceable, settled in prosperous villages. He could speak from
personal knowledge. And even the few survivors of that time&mdash;old
men now&mdash;had changed so much, that it would have been unkind to
remember against them that they had ever slit a throat in their
lives. He had one especially in his mind’s eye: a dignified, venerable
headman of a certain large coast village about sixty miles sou’west
of Tampasuk. It did one’s heart good to see him&mdash;to hear that
man speak. He might have been a ferocious savage once. What men
wanted was to be checked by superior intelligence, by superior
knowledge, by superior force too&mdash;yes, by force held in trust
from God and sanctified by its use in accordance with His declared
will. Captain Whalley believed a disposition for good existed
in every man, even if the world were not a very happy place as
a whole. In the wisdom of men he had not so much confidence. The
disposition had to be helped up pretty sharply sometimes, he admitted.
They might be silly, wrongheaded, unhappy; but naturally evil&mdash;no.
There was at bottom a complete harmlessness at least . . .</p>

<p>"Is there?" Mr. Van Wyk snapped acrimoniously.</p>

<p>Captain Whalley laughed at the interjection, in the good humor
of large, tolerating certitude. He could look back at half a century,
he pointed out. The smoke oozed placidly through the white hairs
hiding his kindly lips.</p>

<p>"At all events," he resumed after a pause, "I am glad that they’ve
had no time to do you much harm as yet."</p>

<p>This allusion to his comparative youthfulness did not offend
Mr. Van Wyk, who got up and wriggled his shoulders with an enigmatic
half-smile. They walked out together amicably into the starry
night towards the river-side. Their footsteps resounded unequally
on the dark path. At the shore end of the gangway the lantern,
hung low to the handrail, threw a vivid light on the white legs
and the big black feet of Mr. Massy waiting about anxiously. From
the waist upwards he remained shadowy, with a row of buttons gleaming
up to the vague outline of his chin.</p>

<p>"You may thank Captain Whalley for this," Mr. Van Wyk said curtly
to him before turning away.</p>

<p>The lamps on the veranda flung three long squares of light between
the uprights far over the grass. A bat flitted before his face
like a circling flake of velvety blackness. Along the jasmine
hedge the night air seemed heavy with the fall of perfumed dew;
flowerbeds bordered the path; the clipped bushes uprose in dark
rounded clumps here and there before the house; the dense foliage
of creepers filtered the sheen of the lamplight within in a soft
glow all along the front; and everything near and far stood still
in a great immobility, in a great sweetness.</p>

<p>Mr. Van Wyk (a few years before he had had occasion to imagine
himself treated more badly than anybody alive had ever been by
a woman) felt for Captain Whalley’s optimistic views the disdain
of a man who had once been credulous himself. His disgust with
the world (the woman for a time had filled it for him completely)
had taken the form of activity in retirement, because, though
capable of great depth of feeling, he was energetic and essentially
practical. But there was in that uncommon old sailor, drifting
on the outskirts of his busy solitude, something that fascinated
his skepticism. His very simplicity (amusing enough) was like
a delicate refinement of an upright character. The striking dignity
of manner could be nothing else, in a man reduced to such a humble
position, but the expression of something essentially noble in
the character. With all his trust in mankind he was no fool; the
serenity of his temper at the end of so many years, since it could
not obviously have been appeased by success, wore an air of profound
wisdom. Mr. Van Wyk was amused at it sometimes. Even the very
physical traits of the old captain of the Sofala, his powerful
frame, his reposeful mien, his intelligent, handsome face, the
big limbs, the benign courtesy, the touch of rugged severity in
the shaggy eyebrows, made up a seductive personality. Mr. Van
Wyk disliked littleness of every kind, but there was nothing small
about that man, and in the exemplary regularity of many trips
an intimacy had grown up between them, a warm feeling at bottom
under a kindly stateliness of forms agreeable to his fastidiousness.</p>

<p>They kept their respective opinions on all worldly matters. His
other convictions Captain Whalley never intruded. The difference
of their ages was like another bond between them. Once, when twitted
with the uncharitableness of his youth, Mr. Van Wyk, running his
eye over the vast proportions of his interlocutor, retorted in
friendly banter&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh. You’ll come to my way of thinking yet. You’ll have plenty
of time. Don’t call yourself old: you look good for a round hundred."</p>

<p>But he could not help his stinging incisiveness, and though moderating
it by an almost affectionate smile, he added&mdash;</p>

<p>"And by then you will probably consent to die from sheer disgust."</p>

<p>Captain Whalley, smiling too, shook his head. "God forbid!"</p>

<p>He thought that perhaps on the whole he deserved something better
than to die in such sentiments. The time of course would have
to come, and he trusted to his Maker to provide a manner of going
out of which he need not be ashamed. For the rest he hoped he
would live to a hundred if need be: other men had been known;
it would be no miracle. He expected no miracles.</p>

<p>The pronounced, argumentative tone caused Mr. Van Wyk to raise
his head and look at him steadily. Captain Whalley was gazing
fixedly with a rapt expression, as though he had seen his Creator’s
favorable decree written in mysterious characters on the wall.
He kept perfectly motionless for a few seconds, then got his vast
bulk on to his feet so impetuously that Mr. Van Wyk was startled.</p>

<p>He struck first a heavy blow on his inflated chest: and, throwing
out horizontally a big arm that remained steady, extended in the
air like the limb of a tree on a windless day&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not a pain or an ache there. Can you see this shake in the least?"</p>

<p>His voice was low, in an awing, confident contrast with the headlong
emphasis of his movements. He sat down abruptly.</p>

<p>"This isn’t to boast of it, you know. I am nothing," he said
in his effortless strong voice, that seemed to come out as naturally
as a river flows. He picked up the stump of the cigar he had laid
aside, and added peacefully, with a slight nod, "As it happens,
my life is necessary; it isn’t my own, it isn’t &mdash;God knows."</p>

<p>He did not say much for the rest of the evening, but several
times Mr. Van Wyk detected a faint smile of assurance flitting
under the heavy mustache.</p>

<p>Later on Captain Whalley would now and then consent to dine "at
the house." He could even be induced to drink a glass of wine.
"Don’t think I am afraid of it, my good sir," he explained. "There
was a very good reason why I should give it up."</p>

<p>On another occasion, leaning back at ease, he remarked, "You
have treated me most&mdash;most humanely, my dear Mr. Van Wyk, from
the very first."</p>

<p>"You’ll admit there was some merit," Mr. Van Wyk hinted slyly.
"An associate of that excellent Massy. . . . Well, well, my dear
captain, I won’t say a word against him."</p>

<p>"It would be no use your saying anything against him," Captain
Whalley affirmed a little moodily. "As I’ve told you before, my
life&mdash;my work, is necessary, not for myself alone. I can’t choose"
. . . He paused, turned the glass before him right round. . .
. "I have an only child&mdash;a daughter."</p>

<p>The ample downward sweep of his arm over the table seemed to
suggest a small girl at a vast distance. "I hope to see her once
more before I die. Meantime it’s enough to know that she has me
sound and solid, thank God. You can’t understand how one feels.
Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh; the very image of my poor
wife. Well, she . . ."</p>

<p>Again he paused, then pronounced stoically the words, "She has
a hard struggle."</p>

<p>And his head fell on his breast, his eyebrows remained knitted,
as by an effort of meditation. But generally his mind seemed steeped
in the serenity of boundless trust in a higher power. Mr. Van
Wyk wondered sometimes how much of it was due to the splendid
vitality of the man, to the bodily vigor which seems to impart
something of its force to the soul. But he had learned to like
him very much.</p>
