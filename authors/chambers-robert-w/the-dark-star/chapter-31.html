<p>Their adieux to Fifi and Nini were elaborate and complicated
by bursts of laughter. The Tziganes recommended Captain Sengoun
to go home and seek further adventures on his pillow; and had
it not been for the gay babble of the fountain and the persistent
perfume of flowers, he might have followed their advice.</p>

<p>It was after the two young men had left the Jardin Russe that
Captain Sengoun positively but affectionately refused to relinquish
possession of Neeland's arm.</p>

<p>"Dear friend," he explained, "I am just waking up and I do not
wish to go to bed for days and days."</p>

<p>"But I do," returned Neeland, laughing. "Where do you want to
go now, Prince Erlik?"</p>

<p>The champagne was singing loudly in the Cossack's handsome head;
the distant brilliancy beyond the Place de la Concorde riveted
his roving eyes.</p>

<p>"Over there," he said joyously. "Listen, old fellow, I'll teach
you the skating step as we cross the Place! Then, in the first
<em>Bal</em>, you shall try it on the fairest form since Helen
fell and Troy burned&mdash;or Troy fell and Helen burned&mdash;it's all
the same, old fellow&mdash;what you call fifty-fifty, eh?"</p>

<p>Neeland tried to free his arm&mdash;to excuse himself; two policemen
laughed; but Sengoun, linking his arm more firmly in Neeland's,
crossed the Place in a series of Dutch rolls and outer edges,
in which Neeland was compelled to join. The Russian was as light
and graceful on his feet as one of the dancers of his own country;
Neeland's knowledge of skating aided his own less agile steps.
There was sympathetic applause from passing taxis and <em>fiacres</em>;
and they might, apparently, have had any number of fair partners
for the asking, along the way, except for Sengoun's headlong dive
toward the brightest of the boulevard lights beyond.</p>

<p>In the rue Royal, however, Sengoun desisted with sudden access
of dignity, remarking that such gambols were not worthy of the
best traditions of his Embassy; and he attempted to bribe the
drivers of a couple of hansom cabs to permit him and his comrade
to take the reins and race to the Arc de Triomphe.</p>

<p>Failing in this, he became profusely autobiographical, informing
Neeland of his birth, education, aims, aspirations.</p>

<p>"When I was twelve," he said, "I had known already the happiness
of the battle-shock against Kurd, Mongol, and Tartar. At eighteen
my ambition was to slap the faces of three human monsters. I told
everybody that I was making arrangements to do this, and I started
for Brusa after my first monster &mdash;Fehim Effendi&mdash;but the
Vali telegraphed to the Grand Vizier, and the Grand Vizier ran
to Abdul the Damned, and Abdul yelled for Sir Nicholas O'Connor;
and they caught me in the Pera Palace and handed me over to my
Embassy."</p>

<p>Neeland shouted with laughter:</p>

<p>"Who were the other monsters?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The other two whose countenances I desired to slap? Oh, one
was Abdul Houda, the Sultan's star-reader, who chattered about
my Dark Star horoscope in the Yildiz. And the other was the Sultan."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Abdul Hamid."</p>

<p>"What? You wished to slap <em>his</em> face?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. But Kutchuk Saïd and Kiamil Pasha requested me not
to&mdash;accompanied by gendarmes."</p>

<p>"You'd have lost your life," remarked Neeland.</p>

<p>"Yes. But then war would surely have come, and today my Emperor
would have held the Dardanelles where the Turkish flag is now
flying over German guns and German gunners."</p>

<p>He shook his head:</p>

<p>"Great mistake on my part," he muttered. "Should have pulled
Abdul's lop ears. Now, everything in Turkey is 'Yasak' except
what Germans do and say; and God knows we are farther than ever
from St. Sophia.... I'm very thirsty with thinking so much, old
fellow. Did you ever drink German champagne?"</p>

<p>"I believe not&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Come on, then. You shall drink several gallons and never feel
it. It's the only thing German I could ever swallow."</p>

<p>"Prince Erlik, you have had considerable refreshment already."</p>

<p>"<em>Copain, t'en fais pas!</em>"</p>

<p>The spectacle of two young fellows in evening dress, in a friendly
tug-of-war under the lamp-posts of the Boulevard, amused the passing
populace; and Sengoun, noticing this, was inclined to mount a
boulevard bench and address the wayfarers, but Neeland pulled
him down and persuaded him into a quieter street, the rue Vilna.</p>

<p>"There's a German place, now!" exclaimed Sengoun, delighted.</p>

<p>And Neeland, turning to look, perceived the illuminated sign
of the Café des Bulgars.</p>

<p>German champagne had now become Sengoun's fixed idea; nothing
could dissuade him from it, nothing persuade him into a homeward
bound taxi. So Neeland, with a rather hazy idea that he ought
not to do it, entered the café with Senguon; and they seated themselves
on a leather wall-lounge before one of the numerous marble-topped
tables.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said in a low voice to his companion, "this is a
German café, and we must be careful what we say. I'm not any too
prudent and I may forget this; but don't <em>you</em>!"</p>

<p>"Quite right, old fellow!" replied Sengoun, giving him an owlish
look. "I must never forget I'm a diplomat among these <em>sales
Boches</em>&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Be careful, Sengoun! That expression is not diplomatic."</p>

<p>"Careful is the word, <em>mon vieux</em>," returned the other
loudly and cheerfully. "I'll bet you a dollar, three kopeks, and
two sous that I go over there and kiss the cashier&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No! Be a real diplomat, Sengoun!"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry you feel that way, Neeland, because she's unusually
pretty. And we might establish a triple entente until you find
some Argive Helen to quadruple it. Aha! Here is our German champagne!
Positively the only thing German a Russian can&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Listen! This won't do. People are looking at us&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Right, old fellow&mdash;always right! You know, Neeland, this friendship
of ours is the most precious, most delightful, and most inspiring
experience of my life. Here's a full goblet to our friendship!
Hurrah! As for Enver Pasha, may Erlik seize him!"</p>

<p>After they had honoured the toast, Sengoun looked about him pleasantly,
receptive, ready for any eventuality. And observing no symptoms
of any eventuality whatever, he suggested creating one.</p>

<p>"Dear comrade," he said, "I think I shall arise and make an incendiary
address&#11834;"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"Very well, if you feel that way about it. But there is another
way to render the evening agreeable. You see that sideboard?"
he continued, pointing to a huge carved buffet piled to the ceiling
with porcelain and crystal. "What will you wager that I can not
push it over with one hand?"</p>

<p>But Neeland declined the wager with an impatient gesture, and
kept his eyes riveted on a man who had just entered the café.
He could see only the stranger's well-groomed back, but when,
a moment later, the man turned to seat himself, Neeland was not
surprised to find himself looking at Doc Curfoot.</p>

<p>"Sengoun," he said under his breath, "that <em>type</em> who
just came in is an American gambler named Doc Curfoot; and he
is here with other gamblers for the purpose of obtaining political
information for some government other than my own."</p>

<p>Sengoun regarded the new arrival with amiable curiosity:</p>

<p>"That worm? Oh, well, every city in Europe swarms with such maggots,
you know. It would be quite funny if he tries any blandishments
on us, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"He may. He's a capper. He's looking at us now. I believe he
remembers having seen me in the train."</p>

<p>"As for an hour or two at chemin-de-fer, baccarat, or roulette,"
remarked Sengoun, "I am not averse to a&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Watch him! The waiter who is taking his order may know who you
are&mdash;may be telling that gambler.... I believe he <em>did</em>!
Now, let us see what happens...."</p>

<p>Sengoun, delighted at the prospect of an eventuality, blandly
emptied his goblet and smiled generally upon everybody.</p>

<p>"I hope he will make our acquaintance and ask us to play," he
said. "I'm very lucky at chemin-de-fer. And if I lose I shall
conclude that there is trickery. Which would make it very lively
for everybody," he added with a boyish smile. But his dark eyes
began to glitter and he showed his beautiful, even teeth when
he laughed.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he said. "A little what you call a mix-up might not come
amiss! That gives one an appetite; that permits one to perspire;
that does good to everybody and makes one sleep soundly! Shall
we, as you say in America, start something?"</p>

<p>Neeland, thinking of Ali-Baba and Golden Beard and of their undoubted
instigation by telegraph of the morning's robbery, wondered whether
the rendezvous of the robbers might not possibly be here in the
Café des Bulgars.</p>

<p>The gang of Americans in the train had named Kestner, Breslau,
and Weishelm&mdash;the one man of the gang whom he had never seen&mdash;as
prospective partners in this enterprise.</p>

<p>Here, somewhere in this building, were their gambling headquarters.
Was there any possible chance that the stolen box and its contents
might have been brought here for temporary safety?</p>

<p>Might it not now be hidden somewhere in this very building by
men too cunning to risk leaving the city when every train and
every road would be watched within an hour of the time that the
robbery was committed?</p>

<p>Leaning back carelessly on the lounge and keeping his eyes on
the people in the café, Neeland imparted these ideas to Sengoun
in a low voice&mdash;told him everything he knew in regard to the affair,
and asked his opinion.</p>

<p>"My opinion," said Sengoun, who was enchanted at any prospect
of trouble, "is that this house is 'suspect' and is worth searching.
Of course the Prefect could be notified, arrangements made, and
a search by the secret police managed. But, Neeland, my friend,
think of what pleasure <em>we</em> should be deprived!"</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why not search the place ourselves?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, we could be picturesque, go to my Embassy,
and fill our pockets with automatic pistols, and come back here
and&mdash;well, make them stand around and see how high they could
reach with both hands."</p>

<p>Neeland laughed.</p>

<p>"That would be a funny jest, wouldn't it?" said Sengoun.</p>

<p>"Very funny. But&#11834;" He nudged Sengoun and directed his attention
toward the terrace outside, where waiters were already removing
the little iron tables and the chairs, and the few lingering guests
were coming inside the café.</p>

<p>"I see," muttered Sengoun; "it is already Sunday morning, and
they're closing. It's too late to go to the Embassy. They'd not
let us in here when we returned."</p>

<p>Neeland summoned a waiter with a nod:</p>

<p>"When do you close up inside here?"</p>

<p>"Tomorrow being Sunday, the terrace closes now, monsieur; but
the café remains open all night," explained the waiter with a
noticeable German accent.</p>

<p>"Thank you." And, to Sengoun: "I'd certainly like to go upstairs.
I'd like to see what it looks like up there&mdash;take a glance around."</p>

<p>"Very well, let us go up&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We ought to have some excuse&#11834;"</p>

<p>"We'll think of several on the way," rising with alacrity, but
Neeland pulled him back.</p>

<p>"Wait a moment! It would only mean a fight&#11834;"</p>

<p>"All fights," explained Sengoun seriously, "are agreeable&mdash;some
more so. So if you are ready, dear comrade&#11834;"</p>

<p>"But a row will do us no good&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Pardon, dear friend, I have been in serious need of one for
an hour or two&#11834;"</p>

<p>"I don't mean that sort of 'good,'" explained Neeland, laughing.
"I mean that I wish to look about up there&mdash;explore&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Quite right, old fellow&mdash;always right! But&mdash;here's an idea!
I could stand at the head of the stairs and throw them down as
they mounted, while you had leisure to look around for your stolen
box&#11834;"</p>

<p>"My dear Prince Erlik, we've nothing to shoot with, and it's
likely they have. There's only one way to get upstairs with any
chance of learning anything useful. And that is to start a row
between ourselves." And, raising his voice as though irritated,
he called for the reckoning, adding in a tone perfectly audible
to anybody in the vicinity that he knew where roulette was played,
and that he was going whether or not his friend accompanied him.</p>

<p>Sengoun, delighted, recognised his cue and protested in loud,
nasal tones that the house to which his comrade referred was suspected
of unfair play; and a noisy dispute began, listened to attentively
by the pretty but brightly painted cashier, the waiters, the <em>gérant</em>,
and every guest in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>"As for me," cried Sengoun, feigning to lose his temper, "I have
no intention of being tricked. I was not born yesterday&mdash;not I!
If there is to be found an honest wheel in Paris that would suit
me. Otherwise, I go home to bed!"</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> an honest wheel, I tell you&#11834;"</p>

<p>"It is not! I know that place!"</p>

<p>"Be reasonable&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Reasonable!" repeated Sengoun appealingly to the people around
them. "Permit me to ask these unusually intelligent gentlemen
whether it is reasonable to play roulette in a place where the
wheel is notoriously controlled and the management a dishonest
one! Could a gentleman be expected to frequent or even to countenance
places of evil repute? <em>Messieurs</em>, I await your verdict!"
And he folded his arms dramatically.</p>

<p>Somebody said, from a neighbouring table:</p>

<p>"<em>Vous avez parfaitement raison, monsieur!</em>"</p>

<p>"I thank you," cried Sengoun, with an admirably dramatic bow.
"Therefore, I shall now go home to bed!"</p>

<p>Neeland, maintaining his gravity with difficulty, followed Sengoun
toward the door, still pretending to plead with him; and the <em>gérant</em>,
a tall, blond, rosy and unmistakable German, stepped forward to
unlock the door.</p>

<p>As he laid his hand on the bolt he said in a whisper:</p>

<p>"If the gentlemen desire the privilege of an exclusive club where
everything is unquestionably conducted&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Where?" demanded Neeland, abruptly.</p>

<p>"On the third floor, <em>monsieur</em>."</p>

<p>"Here?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. If the gentlemen will honour me with their names,
and will be seated for one little moment, I shall see what can
be accomplished."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Sengoun, with a short, incredulous laugh. "I'm
Prince Erlik, of the Mongol Embassy, and my comrade is Mr. Neeland,
Consul General of the United States of America in the Grand Duchy
of Gerolstein!"</p>

<p>The <em>gérant</em> smiled. After he had gone away toward the
further room in the café, Neeland remarked to Sengoun that doubtless
their real names were perfectly well known, and Sengoun disdainfully
shrugged his indifference:</p>

<p>"What can one expect in this dirty rat-nest of Europe? Abdul
the Damned employed one hundred thousand spies in Constantinople
alone! And William the Sudden admired him. Why, Neeland, <em>mon
ami</em>, I never take a step in the streets without being absolutely
certain that I am watched and followed. What do I care! Except
that towns make me sick. But the only cure is a Khirgiz horse
and a thousand lances. God send them. I'm sick of cities."</p>

<p>A few moments later the <em>gérant</em> returned and, in a low
voice, requested them to accompany him.</p>

<p>They passed leisurely through the café, between tables where
lowered eyes seemed to deny any curiosity; but guests and waiters
looked after them after they had passed, and here and there people
whispered together&mdash;particularly two men who had followed them
from the sun-dial fountain in the rue Soleil d'Or to the Jardin
Russe, across the Place de la Concorde, and into the Café des
Bulgars in the rue Vilna.</p>

<p>On the stairs Neeland heard Sengoun still muttering to himself:</p>

<p>"Certainly I am sick of cities and narrow strips of sky. What
I need is a thousand lances at a gallop, and a little Kirghiz
horse between my knees."</p>
