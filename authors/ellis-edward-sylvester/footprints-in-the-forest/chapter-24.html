<p>The ear of the American Indian, like his eye, is trained to wonderful
fineness, and the faint, tremulous note, which seemed to float
from among the tree tops, stirred the suspicions of the Pawnees.
They stopped in their straggling pursuit, and showed such interest
that Deerfoot was compelled, for safety's sake, to steal further
to the rear. If they should locate the point whence the call was
sent, it would be advisable for him to move still further away.</p>

<p>But the result of the signal, if disappointing in one or two
respects (for it brought no response from his friends), was gratifying
from another point of view. It was apparent that the call of the
Shawanoe produced uneasiness among the Pawnees. It showed that,
while they were hunting for their enemies in one direction, one
of them, at least, was in another place. It must have deepened
the old fear that a large number of foes was in the neighborhood,
maneuvering on the outer part of the circle which inclosed the
Pawnees. Enormous advantage was thus placed at the command of
the strangers, and the situation of the warriors bore a suggestive
similarity to that of the hunter who, while hunting the tiger,
discovered that the tiger was hunting him.</p>

<p>Deerfoot did not withdraw so far that he lost his surveillance
of the Pawnees. He smiled in his faint way, when he noticed their
glances toward different points of the compass, and saw them gather
for consultation.</p>

<p>They stood thus only a few moments, when a singular movement
followed. Three of the Pawnees took each a different direction
through the wood, while the main body continued its advance in
a more stealthy manner than before. Their line was along the river
and close to it, which looked as if they were following the trail
of the Sauk and Jack Carleton. Whether or not such was the fact
could not be determined by Deerfoot, since the footprints of the
Pawnees, covering the same course, hid those of the two in advance.</p>

<p>In fact Deerfoot did not care, for, if the Sauk and Jack Carleton
knew no better than to allow a party of hostiles to overhaul them
in the wilderness, they deserved the consequences; but cool and
collected as was the young Shawanoe, his heart gave a quick throb
when he noticed the other movements which I have named.</p>

<p>One of the dusky scouts took a south-westerly course, another
went almost due south, while the third faced the south-east, the
paths of the three diverging like so many spokes of a wheel. The
course of the last named, if persisted in, would take him within
a hundred feet of the tree behind which the Shawanoe screened
himself.</p>

<p>What rendered this prospect more gratifying was the fact that
this Pawnee was Lone Bear, the very warrior whom the Shawanoe
was so eager to detach from the main party, so as to gain the
chance to "operate" on him; the opportunity he sought was thrust
into his hands so unexpectedly that he believed it was in answer
to his prayer.</p>

<p>It would seem that Deerfoot ought not to have found any difficulty
in manipulating matters to suit himself, but his situation was
exceptionally delicate; for, above everything else, it was necessary
that he should not be discovered, or have his presence suspected.
It would seem, however, that the signal should have given the
clew.</p>

<p>Lone Bear had started on a scout, and, recalling his experience
on the other side of the river, he was sure to put forth all the
cunning of his nature to escape any surprise from his enemies.
He was alert, and glanced from side to side, and indeed in all
directions, while advancing on a slow, loping trot. It was easy
enough to avoid discovery from him, but, in moving round the trunk
of the tree (so as to interpose it as a guard), there came a time
when the Shawanoe was likely to be seen by the main party, which
was not only close, but showed no hurry to move on.</p>

<p>This danger was avoided by Deerfoot with characteristic deftness.
He lay flat on his face, in which posture he could not be detected
by any one a dozen yards away, and skillfully shifted his position
until the back of Lone Bear was toward him. Peering around the
trunk, he kept his eyes on the Pawnee until the intervening trees
and vegetation shut him from sight. Then Deerfoot rose to his
feet, and took his trail like a bloodhound.</p>

<p>The Shawanoe felt the battle was won. There could be no doubt
that Lone Bear had started on the same errand as the other two&mdash;that
of scouting through the neighborhood for the main party of Pawnees.
Deerfoot might have wondered that he should do so, after the wild
panic into which he had been thrown by him, but like enough he
felt the need of some such action in order to repair his damaged
reputation. It was not impossible that he volunteered for the
perilous duty.</p>

<p>But having taken such a step, it must not be supposed that Lone
Bear forgot the perils to which he would be exposed. His vigilance
was unremitting, and it need not be said that he looked well to
the rear.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the pursuer and his unconscious fugitive were
beyond danger of discovery from the main party, and there was
little fear of Lone Bear escaping Deerfoot. He had his trail and
was sure to run him down.</p>

<p>The Pawnee scout followed an almost direct course for twenty
rods, when he stopped, and, standing erect, slowly turned his
head and body, using eyes, and ears for all they were worth. He
seemed to be satisfied with what he failed to discover, and advanced
at a slower gait in the direction of the river, displaying the
same vigilance shown from the first.</p>

<p>The distance between Lone Bear and his friends was great enough
to suit the purpose of Deerfoot, who now began to maneuver with
a view of getting near his man without the latter suspecting it.
Great as were the cunning and woodcraft of the Shawanoe, it is
difficult to believe such an exploit possible, in view of the
watchfulness of the Pawnee. He was scouting against his enemies,
and to suppose he would permit one to approach him unobserved
is to declare him a stupid Indian&mdash;which he was far from being.</p>

<p>But a guarded pursuit and study of his actions, made it clear
what his line of conduct was to be, and like the most successful
of woodmen, Deerfoot in adopting a certain policy anticipated
the action of his adversary.</p>

<p>The latter had not proceeded far in the direction of the river
when he again stopped, and, standing motionless, looked and listened,
just as he had done many a time when stealing through the country
of an enemy, and just as he did years before when fleeing for
so many miles through the wilderness to escape the Shawanoes.</p>

<p>For aught that he saw, the Pawnee might have been the only living
person within a thousand miles of the lonely spot. Looking aloft
at the arching trunks, the branching boughs, and the spread of
the leafy roof, he saw no sign of life, except a gray squirrel,
which, running lightly along the shaggy bark of a huge limb, whisked
out of sight in the wealth of vegetation beyond. Here and there
patches of blue sky could be detected, with the white flecks of
clouds drifting past, but neither the ground nor the trees nor
the air showed aught else. Not even a bird, sailing high overhead,
flitted to sight, and the leaves below were rustled by no step
of bear or deer or smaller animal.</p>

<p>But such might be the case, with a score of red men prowling
near at hand. They would flit hither and thither like so many
phantoms, and all the acuteness the Pawnee possessed was needed
to elude the traps they were likely to set for his feet. He seemed
to believe he was alone, and, resuming his noiseless advance,
he did not stop until the listening ear detected the soft flow
of the stream, and the daylight between the trees showed the river
close at hand.</p>

<p>Again, having satisfied himself, he moved forward until he caught
the gleam of water. The same form of scrutiny which has been described
was repeated, after which Lone Bear faced down stream and hurried
toward the main party fully a half mile distant.</p>

<p>The course of the Pawnee may be described as similar to that
of starting from the hub of a wheel, following one of the spokes
to the tire, and after traveling some distance along that, returning
to the hub by another spoke. Lone Bear had gone to the limit of
his tramp, and as the other scouts had taken the same course through
different portions of the wood, it will be seen that the neighborhood
was sure to be thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>Lone Bear must have concluded that, wherever their enemies had
located, they were not within his bailiwick, for, having faced
to the westward, he dropped into his loping trot, which, in the
case of many Indians, appeared to be more natural than the ordinary
walking gait.</p>

<p>It is not impossible that when the dark eyes of the warrior rested
on the large trunk of a white oak almost in his path, he reflected
what a capital armor it would make against an enemy. At any rate,
whether he thought of it or not, he made the discovery in the
most astounding manner.</p>

<p>Less than a dozen steps intervened between him and the dark,
corrugated bark of the towering wood king, and he was surveying
it with a curious expression, when Deerfoot, the Shawanoe, stepped
from behind it, and with his tomahawk raised over his head, faced
the Pawnee.</p>

<p>"Let Lone Bear stand still and make no outcry, and Deerfoot will
not harm him; let him disobey, and the Shawanoe shall split the
skull of the Pawnee before he can utter a cry."</p>

<p>The previous experience of Lone Bear had taught him that it was
lost time to argue the question; indeed, no choice remained but
to accept the situation, and he did so with a certain meekness
which was not without its effect on the Shawanoe.</p>

<p>"Deerfoot is the greatest hunter of the Shawanoes, and the Pawnee
bows his head before him."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Lone Bear surprised the other by the completeness
of his submission, doing that which was unexpected to his conqueror.
The rifle which he was holding in his right hand, when summoned
to surrender, was thrown on the ground; then the tomahawk was
flung from the girdle, the knife from the sheath, and all three
lay beside each other on the leaves. Not only that, but Lone Bear
moved three steps backward and signified to the Shawanoe that
he was at liberty to come forward and take them without molestation
from him.</p>

<p>"Let my brother, Lone Bear, listen," said Deerfoot, lowering
the left hand which held the tomahawk aloft and resting it against
his hip, where it could be used the instant needed; "let the words
of Deerfoot be heeded, and it shall be well with Lone Bear; his
rifle and tomahawk and knife shall be given to him, and his brothers,
the Pawnees, shall never know he was vanquished by Deerfoot."</p>

<p>This was promising a great deal, and the Pawnee looked questioningly
at the other, though it could be seen that he placed much reliance
on his pledges.</p>

<p>"The ears of Lone Bear are open; he hears the words of the great
Deerfoot; his words reach his heart; what is it my brother, the
mighty Shawanoe, would say to him?"</p>

<p>It must have been that Lone Bear had some suspicion of the business
of Deerfoot, though it was impossible for him to know his full
purpose before Deerfoot made it known.</p>

<p>"My brother will be wise if he heeds the words of Deerfoot; he
will please the Great Spirit, for Deerfoot asks him to speak only
with a single tongue."</p>

<p>"Lone Bear will speak with a single tongue."</p>

<p>"Then," said Deerfoot, "he will make known the truth of the pale-faced
boy for whom the heart of Deerfoot mourns."</p>
