<p>For some days after his return home&mdash;in fact, until his friend's
arrival, Tom was thoroughly beaten down and wretched, notwithstanding
his efforts to look hopefully forward, and keep up his spirits.
His usual occupations were utterly distasteful to him; and, instead
of occupying himself, he sat brooding over his late misfortune,
and hopelessly puzzling his head as to what he could do to set
matters right. The conviction in which he always landed was that
there was nothing to be done, and that he was a desolate and blighted
being, deserted of gods and men. Hardy's presence and company
soon shook him out of this maudlin nightmare state, and he began
to recover as soon as he had his old sheet-anchor friend to hold
on to and consult with. Their consultations were held chiefly
in the intervals of woodcraft, in which they spent most of their
hours between breakfast and dinner. Hardy did not take out a certificate
and wouldn't shoot without one; so, as the best autumn exercise,
they selected a tough old pollard elm, infinitely ugly, with knotted
and twisted roots, curiously difficult to get at and cut through,
which had been long marked as a blot by Mr. Brown, and condemned
to be felled as soon as there was nothing more pressing for his
men to do. But there was always something of more importance;
so that the cross-grained old tree might have remained until this
day, had not Hardy and Tom pitched on him as a foeman worthy of
their axes. They shoveled, and picked, and hewed away with great
energy. The woodman who visited them occasionally, and who, on
examining their first efforts, had remarked that the severed roots
looked a little "as tho' the dogs had been a gnawin' at 'em,"
began to hold them in respect, and to tender his advice with some
deference. By the time the tree was felled and shrouded, Tom was
in a convalescent state.</p>

<p>Their occupation had naturally led to discussions on the advantages
of emigration, the delights of clearing one's own estate, building
one's own house, and getting away from conventional life with
a few tried friends. Of course the pictures which were painted
included foregrounds with beautiful children playing about the
clearing, and graceful women, wives of the happy squatters, flitting
in and out of log houses and sheds, clothed and occupied after
the manner of our ideal grandmothers; with the health and strength
of Amazons, the refinement of high-bred ladies, and wondrous skill
in all domestic works, confections, and contrivances. The log-houses
would also contain fascinating select libraries, continually reinforced
from home, sufficient to keep all the dwellers in the happy clearing
in communion with all the highest minds of their own and former
generations. Wonderous games in the neighbouring forest, dear
old home customs established and taking root in the wilderness,
with ultimate dainty flower gardens, conservatories, and pianofortes&mdash;a
millennium on a small scale, with universal education, competence,
prosperity, and equal rights! Such castle-building, as an accompaniment
to the hard exercise of woodcraft, worked wonders for Tom in the
next week, and may be safely recommended to parties in like evil
case with him.</p>

<p>But more practical discussions were not neglected, and it was
agreed that they should make a day at Englebourn together before
their return to Oxford, Hardy undertaking to invade the Rectory
with the view of re-establishing his friend's character there.</p>

<p>Tom wrote a letter to Katie to prepare her for a visit. The day
after the ancient elm was fairly disposed of, they started early
for Englebourn, and separated at the entrance to the village &mdash;Hardy
proceeding to the Rectory to fulfill his mission, which he felt
to be rather an embarrassing one, and Tom to look after the constable,
or whoever else could give him information about Harry.</p>

<p>He arrived at the "Red Lion," their appointed trysting place,
before Hardy, and spent a restless half-hour in the porch and
bar waiting for his return. At last Hardy came, and Tom hurried
him into the inn's best room, where bread and cheese and ale awaited
them; and, as soon as the hostess could be got out of the room,
began impatiently&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well you have seen her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have come straight here from the Rectory."</p>

<p>"And is it all right, eh? Has she got my letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she had had your letter."</p>

<p>"And you think she is satisfied?"</p>

<p>"Satisfied? No, you can't expect her to be satisfied."</p>

<p>"I mean, is she satisfied that it isn't so bad after all as it
looked the other day? What does Katie think of me?"</p>

<p>"I think she is still very fond of you, but that she has been
puzzled and outraged by this discovery, and cannot get over it
all at once."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell her the whole story from beginning to end?"</p>

<p>"I tried to do so as well as I could."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can see you haven't done it. She doesn't really understand
how it is."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not; but you must remember it is an awkward subject
to be talking about to a young woman. I would sooner stand another
fellowship examination than go through it again."</p>

<p>"Thank you, old fellow," said Tom, laying his hand on Hardy's
shoulder; "I feel that I'm unreasonable and impatient; but you
can excuse it; you know that I don't mean it."</p>

<p>"Don't say another word; I only wish I could have done more for
you."</p>

<p>"But what do you suppose Katie thinks of me?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, it sums itself up in this; she sees that you have
been making serious love to Patty, and have turned the poor girl's
head, more or less, and that now you are in love with somebody
else. Why, put it how we will, we can't get out of that. There
are the facts, pure and simple, and she wouldn't be half a woman
if she didn't resent it."</p>

<p>"But it's hard lines, too, isn't it, old fellow? No, I won't
say that? I deserve it all, and much worse. But you think I may
come round all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, all in good time. I hope there's no danger in any other
quarter?"</p>

<p>"Goodness knows. There's the rub, you see. She will go back to
town disgusted with me. I sha'n't see her again, and she won't
hear of me for I don't know how long; and she will be meeting
heaps of men. Has Katie been over to Barton?"</p>

<p>"Yes; she was there last week, just before they left."</p>

<p>"Well, what happened?"</p>

<p>"She wouldn't say much; but I gathered that they are very well."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, bother it. Of course they are very well. But didn't
she talk to Katie about what happened last week?"</p>

<p>"Of couse they did! What else should they talk about?"</p>

<p>"But you don't know what they said?"</p>

<p>"No. But you may depend on it that Miss Winter will be your friend.
My dear fellow, there is nothing for it but time."</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose not," said Tom, with a groan. "Do you think
I should call and see Katie?"</p>

<p>"No; I think better not."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we may as well get back," said Tom, who was not
sorry for his friend's decision. So they paid their bill and started
for home, taking the Hawk's Lynch on the way, that Hardy might
see the view.</p>

<p>"And what did you find out about young Winburn?" he said as they
passed down the street.</p>

<p>"Oh, no good," said Tom; "he was turned out, as I thought, and
has gone to live with an old woman on the heath here, who is no
better than she should be; and none of the farmers will employ
him.</p>

<p>"You didn't see him, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, he is away with some of the heath people, hawking besoms
and chairs about the country. They make them when there is no
harvest work, and loaf about in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire,
and other counties, selling them."</p>

<p>"No good will come of that sort of life, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"No, but what is he to do?"</p>

<p>"I called at the lodge as I came away, and saw Patty and her
mother. It's all right in that quarter. The old woman doesn't
seem to think anything of it, and Patty is a good girl, and will
make Harry Winburn, or anybody else, a capital wife. Here are
your letters."</p>

<p>"And the locket?"</p>

<p>"I quite forgot it. Why didn't you remind me of it? You talked
of nothing but the letters this morning."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of it. It can do no harm now, and as it is worth something,
I should have been ashamed to take it back. I hope she'll put
Harry's hair in it soon. Did she seem to mind giving up the letters?"</p>

<p>"Not very much. No, you are lucky there. She will get over it."</p>

<p>"But you told her that I am her friend for life, and that she
is to let me know if I can ever do anything for her?"</p>

<p>"Yes. And now I hope this is the last job of the kind I shall
ever have to do for you."</p>

<p>"But what bad luck it has been? If I had only seen her before,
or known who she was, nothing of all this would have happened."</p>

<p>To this Hardy made no reply; and the subject was not alluded
to again in their walk home.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards they returned to Oxford, Hardy to begin
his work as fellow and assistant-tutor of the College, and Tom
to see whether he could not make a better hand of his second year
than he had of his first. He began with a much better chance of
doing so, for he was thoroughly humbled. The discovery that he
was not altogether such a hero as he had fancied himself, had
dawned upon him very distinctly by the end of his first year;
and the events of the long vacation had confirmed the impression,
and pretty well taken all the conceit out of him for the time.
The impotency of his own will, even when he was bent on doing
the right thing, his want of insight and foresight in whatever
matter he took in hand, the unruliness of his temper and passions
just at the moments when it behooved him to have them most thoroughly
in hand and under control, were a set of disagreeable facts which
had been driven well home to him. The results, being even such
as we have seen, he did not much repine at, for he felt he had
deserved them; and there was a sort of grim satisfaction, dreary
as the prospect was, in facing them, and taking his punishment
like a man. This was what he had felt at the first blush on the
Hawk's Lynch; and, as he thought over matters again by his fire,
with his oak sported, on the first evening of term, he was still
in the same mind. This was clearly what he had to do now. How
to do it, was the only question.</p>

<p>At first he was inclined to try to set himself right with the
Porters and the Englebourn circle, by writing further explanations
and confessions to Katie. But, on trying his hand at a letter,
he found that he could not trust himself. The temptation of putting
everything in the best point of view for himself was too great;
so he gave up the attempt, and merely wrote a few lines to David,
to remind him that he was always ready and anxious to do all he
could for his friend, Harry Winburn, and to beg that he might
have news of anything which happened to him, and how he was getting
on. He did not allude to what had lately happened, for he did
not know whether the facts had become known, and was in no hurry
to open the subject himself.</p>

<p>Having finished his letter, he turned again to his meditations
over the fire, and, considering that he had some little right
to reward resolution, took off the safety valve, and allowed the
thoughts to bubble up freely which were always underlying all
others that passed through his brain, and making constant low,
delicious, but just now somewhat melancholy music, in his head
and heart. He gave himself up to thinking of Mary, and their walk
in the wood, and the sprained ankle, and all the sayings and doings
of that eventful autumn day. And then he opened his desk, and
examined certain treasures therein concealed, including a withered
rose-bud, a sprig of heather, a cut boot-lace, and a scrap or
two of writing. Having gone through some extravagant forms of
worship, not necessary to be specified, he put them away. Would
it ever all come right?</p>

<p>He made his solitary tea, and sat down again to consider the
point. But the point would not be considered alone. He began to
feel more strongly what he had had several hints of already, that
there was a curiously close connexion between his own love story
and that of Harry Winburn and Patty&mdash;that he couldn't separate
them, even in his thoughts. Old Simon's tumble, which had recalled
his daughter from Oxford at so critical a moment for him; Mary's
visit to Englebourn at this very time; the curious yet natural
series of little accidents which had kept him in ignorance of
Patty's identity until the final catastrophe&mdash;then, again, the
way in which Harry Winburn and his mother had come across him
on the very day of his leaving Barton; the fellowship of a common
mourning which had seemed to bind them together so closely; and
this last discovery, which he could not help fearing must turn
Harry into a bitter enemy, when he heard the truth, as he must,
sooner or later&mdash;as all these things passed before him, he gave
in to a sort of superstitious feeling that his own fate hung,
in some way or another, upon that of Harry Winburn. If he helped
on his suit, he was helping on his own; but whether he helped
on his own or not, was, after all, not that which was uppermost
in his thoughts, He was much changed in this respect since he
last sat in those rooms, just after his first days with her. Since
then an angel had met him, and had touched the cord of self, which,
trembling, was passing "in music out of sight."</p>

<p>The thought of Harry and his trials enabled him to indulge in
some good honest indignation, for which there was no room in his
own case. That the prospects in life of such a man should be in
the power, to a great extent, of such people as Squire Wurley
and Farmer Tester; that, because he happened to be poor, he should
be turned out of the cottage where his family had lived for a
hundred years, at a week's notice, through the caprice of a drunken
gambler; that because he had stood up for his rights, and had
thereby offended the worst farmer in the parish, he should be
a marked man, and unable to get work&mdash;these things appeared so
monstrous to Tom, and made him so angry, that he was obliged to
get up and stamp about the room. And from the particular case
he very soon got to generalizations.</p>

<p>Questions which had before now puzzled him gained a new significance
every minute, and became real to him. Why a few men should be
rich, and all the rest poor; above all, why he should be one of
the few? Why the mere possession of property should give a man
power over all his neighbors? Why poor men who were ready and
willing to work should only be allowed to work as a sort of favor,
and should after all get the merest tithe of what their labor
produced, and be tossed aside as soon as their work was done,
or no longer required? These, and other such problems, rose up
before him, crude and sharp, asking to be solved. Feeling himself
quite unable to give any but one answer to them&mdash;viz. that he
was getting out of his depth, and that the whole business was
in a muddle&mdash;he had recourse to his old method when in difficulties,
and putting on his cap, started off to Hardy's rooms to talk the
matter over, and see whether he could not get some light on it
from that quarter.</p>

<p>He returned in an hour or so, somewhat less troubled in his mind
inasmuch as he had found his friend in pretty much the same state
of mind on such topics as himself. But one step he had gained.
Under his arm he carried certain books from Hardy's scanty library,
the perusal of which he hoped, at least, might enable him sooner
or later to feel that he had got on to some sort of firm ground,
At any rate, Hardy had advised him to read them; so, without more
ado, he drew his chair to the table and began to look into them.</p>

<p>This glimpse of the manner in which Tom spent the first evening
of his second year at Oxford, will enable intelligent readers
to understand why, though he took to reading far more kindly and
honestly than he had ever done before, he made no great advance
in the proper studies of the place. Not that he wholly neglected
these, for Hardy kept him pretty well up to the collar, and he
passed his little go creditably, and was fairly placed at the
college examinations. In some of the books which he had to get
up for lectures he was genuinely interested. The politics of Athens,
the struggle between the Roman plebs and patricians, Mons Sacer
and the Agrarian laws&mdash;these began to have a new meaning to him,
but chiefly because they bore more or less on the great Harry
Winburn problem; which problem, indeed, for him had now fairly
swelled into the condition-of-England problem, and was becoming
every day more and more urgent and importunate, shaking many old
beliefs, and leading him whither he knew not.</p>

<p>This very matter of leading was a sore trial to him. The further
he got on his new road, the more he felt the want of guidance&mdash;the
guidance of some man; for that of books he soon found to be bewildering.
His college tutor, whom he consulted, only deprecated the waste
of tune; but on finding it impossible to dissuade him, at last
recommended the economic works of that day as the proper well
springs of truth on such matters. To them Tom accordingly went,
and read with the docility and faith of youth, bent on learning
and feeling itself in the presence of men who had, or assumed,
the right of speaking with authority.</p>

<p>And they spoke to him with authority, and he read on, believing
much and hoping more; but somehow they did not really satisfy
him, though they silenced him for the time. It was not the fault
of the books, most of which laid down clearly enough, that what
they professed to teach was the science of man's material interests,
and the laws of the making and employment of capital. But this
escaped him in his eagerness, and he wandered up and down their
pages in search of quite another science, and of laws with which
they did not meddle. Nevertheless, here and there they seemed
to touch upon what he was in search of. He was much fascinated,
for instance, by the doctrine of "the greatest happiness of the
greatest number," and for its sake swallowed for a time, though
not without wry faces, the dogmas, that self-interest is the true
pivot of all social action, that population has a perpetual tendency
to outstrip the means of living, and that to establish a preventive
check on population is the duty of all good citizens. And so he
lived on for some time in a dreary uncomfortable state, fearing
for the future of his country, and with little hope about his
own. But, when he came to take stock of his newly acquired knowledge,
to weigh it and measure it, and found it to consist of a sort
of hazy conviction that society would be all right and ready for
the millennium, when every man could do what he liked, and nobody
could interfere with him, and there should be a law against marriage,
the result was more than he could stand. He roused himself and
shook himself, and began to think, "Well, these my present teachers
are very clever men, and well-meaning men, too. I see all that;
but, if their teaching is only to land me here, why it was scarcely
worth while going through so much to get so little."</p>

<p>Casting about still for guidance, Grey occurred to him. Grey
was in residence as a bachelor, attending divinity lectures, and
preparing for ordination. He was still working hard at the night-school,
and Tom had been there once or twice to help him when the curate
was away. In short he was in very good books with Grey, who had
got the better of his shyness with him. He saw that Tom was changed
and sobered, and in his heart hoped some day to wean him from
the pursuits of the body, to which he was still fearfully addicted,
and to bring him into the fold. This hope was not altogether unfounded;
for, notwithstanding the strong bias against them which Tom had
brought with him from school, he was now at times much attracted
by many of the High Church doctrines, and the men who professed
them. Such men as Grey, he saw, did really believe something,
and were in earnest about carrying their beliefs into action.
The party might and did comprise many others of the weakest sort,
who believed and were in earnest about nothing, but who liked
to be peculiar. Nevertheless, while he saw it laying hold of many
of the best men of his time, it is not to be wondered at that
he was drawn towards it. Some help might lie in these men if he
could only get at it!</p>

<p>So he propounded his doubts and studies, and their results to
Grey. But it was a failure. Grey felt no difficulty or very little,
in the whole matter; but Tom found that it was because he believed
the world to belong to the devil. "<em>Laissez faire</em>," "buying
cheap and selling dear," Grey held might be good enough for laws
for the world&mdash;very probably were. The laws of the Church were
"self-sacrifice," and "bearing one another's burdens" her children
should come out from the regions where the world's laws were acknowledged.</p>

<p>Tom listened, was dazzled at first, and thought he was getting
on the right track. But very soon he found that Grey's specific
was not of the least use to him. It was no good to tell him of
the rules of a society to which he felt that he neither belonged,
nor wished to belong, for clearly it could not be the Church of
England. He was an outsider! Grey would probably admit it to be
so, if he asked him! He had no longing to be anything else, <em>if</em>
the Church meant an exclusive body, which took no care of any
but its own people, and had nothing to say to the great world
in which he and most people had to live, and buying and selling,
and hiring and working, had to go on. The close corporation might
have very good laws, but they were nothing to him. What he wanted
to know about was the law which this great world&mdash;the devil's
world, as Grey called it&mdash;was ruled by, or rather ought to be
ruled by. Perhaps, after all, Bentham and the others, whose books
he had been reading, might be right! At any rate, it was clear
that they had had in their thoughts the same world that he had&mdash;the
world which included himself and Harry Winburn, and all labourers
and squires, and farmers. So he turned to them again, not hopefully,
but more inclined to listen to them than he had been before he
had spoken to Grey.</p>

<p>Hardy was so fully occupied with college lectures and private
pupils, that Tom had scruples about taking up much of his spare
time in the evenings. Nevertheless, as Grey had broken down, and
there was nobody else on whose judgment he could rely who would
listen to him, whenever he had a chance he would propound some
of his puzzles to his old friend. In some respects he got little
help, for Hardy was almost as much at sea as he himself on such
subjects as "value," and "wages," and the "laws of supply and
demand." But there was an indomitable belief in him that all men's
intercourse with one another, and not merely that of Churchmen,
must be founded on the principal of "doing as they would be done
by," and not on "buying cheap and selling dear," and that these
never would or could be reconciled with one another, or mean the
same thing, twist them how you would. This faith of his friend's
comforted Tom greatly, and he was never tired of bringing it out;
but at times he had his doubts whether Grey might not be right&mdash;whether,
after all, that and the like maxims and principles were meant
to be the laws of the kingdoms of this world. He wanted some corroborative
evidence on the subject from an impartial and competent witness,
and at last hit upon what he wanted. For, one evening, on entering
Hardy's rooms, he found him on the last pages of a book, which
he shut up with an air of triumph on recognizing his visitor.
Taking it up, he thrust it into Tom's hands, and slapping him
on the shoulder, said, "There, my boy, that's what we want, or
pretty near it at any rate. Now, don't say a word, but go back
to your rooms, and swallow it whole and digest it, and then come
back and tell me what you think of it."</p>

<p>"But I want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I can't talk. I have spent the better part of two days over
that book, and have no end of papers to look over. There; get
back to your rooms, and do what I tell you, or sit down here and
hold your tongue."</p>

<p>So Tom sat down and held his tongue, and was soon deep in Carlyle's
"Past and Present." How he did revel in it&mdash;in the humor, the
power, the pathos, but, above all, in the root and branch denunciations
of many of the doctrines in which he had been so lately voluntarily
and wearily chaining himself! The chains went snapping off one
after another, and, in his exultation, he kept spouting out passage
after passage in a song of triumph, "Enlightened egoism never
so luminous is not the rule by which man's life can be led&mdash;<em>laissez-faire</em>,
supply and demand, cash payment for the sole nexus, and so forth,
were not, are not, and never will be, a practical law of union
for a society of men," &amp;c., &amp;c., until Hardy fairly got
up and turned him out, and he retired with his new-found treasure
to his own rooms.</p>

<p>He had scarcely ever in his life been so moved by a book before.
He laughed over it, and cried over it, and began half a dozen
letters to the author to thank him, which he fortunately tore
up. He almost forgot Mary for several hours during his first enthusiasm.
He had no notion how he had been mastered and oppressed before.
He felt as the crew of a small fishing-smack, who are being towed
away by an enemy's cruiser, might feel on seeing a frigate with
the Union Jack flying, bearing down and opening fire on their
captor; or as a small boy at school, who is being fagged against
rules by the right of the strongest, feels when he sees his big
brother coming around the corner. The help which he had found
was just what he wanted. There was no narrowing of the ground
here&mdash;no appeal to men as members of any exclusive body whatever
to separate themselves and come out of the devil's world; but
to men as men, to every man as a man&mdash;to the weakest and meanest,
as well as to the strongest and most noble&mdash;telling them that
the world is God's world, that everyone of them has a work in
it, and bidding them find their work and set about it.</p>

<p>The strong tinge of sadness which ran through the whole book,
and its unsparing denunciations of the established order of things,
suited his own unsettled and restless frame of mind. So he gave
himself up to his new bondage, and rejoiced in it, as though he
had found at last what he was seeking for; and, by the time that
long vacation came round again, to which we are compelled to hurry
him, he was filled full of a set of contradictory notions and
beliefs, which were destined to astonish and perplex the mind
of that worthy J. P. for the county of Berks, Brown the elder,
whatever other effect they might have on society at large.</p>

<p>Readers must not suppose, however, that our hero had given up
his old pursuits; on the contrary, he continued to boat, and cricket,
and spar, with as much vigor as ever. His perplexities only made
him a little more silent at his pastimes than he used to be. But,
as we have already seen him thus employed, and know the ways of
the animal in such matters, it is needless to repeat. What we
want to do is to follow him into new fields of thought and action,
and mark, if it may be, how he develops, and gets himself educated
in one way and another; and this plunge into the great sea of
social, political, and economical questions is the noticeable
fact (so far as any is noticeable) of his second year's residence.</p>

<p>During the year he had only very meagre accounts of matters at
Englebourn. Katie, indeed, had come round sufficiently to write
to him; but she scarcely alluded to her cousin. He only knew that
Mary had come out in London, and was much admired; and that the
Porters had not taken Barton again, but were going abroad for
the autumn and winter. The accounts of Harry were bad; he was
still living at Daddy Collins's, nobody knew how, and working
gang-work occasionally with the outlaws of the heath.</p>

<p>The only fact of importance in the neighborhood had been the
death of Squire Wurley, which happened suddenly in the spring.
A distant cousin had succeeded him, a young man of Tom's own age.</p>

<p>He was also in residence at Oxford, and Tom knew him. They were
not very congenial; so he was much astonished when young Wurley,
on his return to College, after his relative's funeral, rather
sought him out, and seemed to wish to know more of him. The end
of it was an invitation to Tom to come to the Grange, and spend
a week or so at the beginning of the long vacation. There was
to be a party of Oxford men there, and nobody else; and they meant
to enjoy themselves thoroughly, Wurley said.</p>

<p>Tom felt much embarrassed how to act, and, after some hesitation,
told his inviter of his last visit to the mansion in question,
thinking that a knowledge of the circumstances might change his
mind. But he found that young Wurley knew the facts already; and,
in fact, he couldn't help suspecting that his quarrel with the
late owner had something to say to his present invitation. However,
it did not lie in his mouth to be curious on the subject; and
so he accepted the invitation gladly, much delighted at the notion
of beginning his vacation so near Englebourn, and having the run
of the Grange fishing, which was justly celebrated.</p>
