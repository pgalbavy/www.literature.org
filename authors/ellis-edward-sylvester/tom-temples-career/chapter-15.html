<p><em>THERE </em>was another tea-table in Plympton where Tom’s
affairs were discussed the same afternoon. As the reader will
conjecture, I refer to that of Lawyer Davenport.</p>

<p>"Was Thomas Temple here this afternoon?" he asked when they were
all seated.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Imogene promptly.</p>

<p>"Imogene is setting her cap for him," said James.</p>

<p>"You should not tease your sister, James," said his mother. "It
is perfectly natural that Tom should be polite to your sister.
He is in her own social rank, and will possess a fine fortune.
What do you say, Mr. Davenport?"</p>

<p>"That the intimacy had better cease," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"Really, I can’t understand your reasons," said Mrs. Davenport.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with Tom?" demanded Imogene.</p>

<p>"I have heard some news about him this afternoon," said the lawyer,
"which influences me in what I have said."</p>

<p>"We shouldn’t be too hard upon his boyish scrapes," said Mrs.
Davenport charitably. "Boys will be boys."</p>

<p>"It isn’t any boyish scrape."</p>

<p>"What is it, then?"</p>

<p>"Much worse than that. He has lost his entire fortune!"</p>

<p>"You don’t mean it!" ejaculated his wife.</p>

<p>"It can’t be true, papa," said Imogene.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly true. I had it from Mr. Middleton, and he received
the information this very day from Mr. Sharp, the boy’s guardian."</p>

<p>"But how could he lose it?" asked James.</p>

<p>"By bad investments and the failure of large creditors."</p>

<p>"Has he lost everything?"</p>

<p>"All but a few hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Of course, that alters the case very much," said Mrs. Davenport.
"He is a poor boy now."</p>

<p>"To be sure. He will have to work for a living. Probably he will
become a common mechanic."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" exclaimed Imogene, with a shudder.</p>

<p>"Of course, he is no fit companion for our children now."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," said Mrs. Davenport decidedly.</p>

<p>"I am not sorry," said James. "I never liked him. I always thought
him low."</p>

<p>"I hope, Imogene," said her mother, "you won’t think of encouraging
his visits now," said her mother. "He is far below you in the
social scale."</p>

<p>"I understand that well enough, mother. I should not be willing
to associate with a working boy."</p>

<p>"Right, my love! I see that you cherish sentiments worthy of
my daughter. There is nothing like having a proper sense of your
own dignity."</p>

<p>"You won’t have to complain of me," said Imogene, tossing her
head.</p>

<p>"Nor of me," said James. "I’ll keep him at a distance, never
fear."</p>

<p>"If he persists in coming here, you must tell him decidedly that
he is not wanted," said Mrs. Davenport.</p>

<p>"There will be no difficulty," said the lawyer. "He is to leave
town at once, and probably Mr. Sharp will find him a place."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that."</p>

<p>"I am not," said James. "I should like to see him working at
some trade here in town, so that I could snub him and so pay him
off for his independent airs."</p>

<p>The family had just risen from the supper-table when Tom was
ushered into the room by the servant. The four who had been discussing
him and his affairs looked at each other in a significant manner.
Tom was sharp enough to see that the change in his fortunes was
known, and he smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Thomas," said the lawyer, in a reserved tone.
"Do you bring any message from Mr. Middleton?"</p>

<p>"No, I don’t," said Tom independently. "I board with Mr. Middleton.
I don’t carry messages for him."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that you exhibit an unbecoming pride," said
the village magnate.</p>

<p>"Do I?" cried Tom. "I was only stating a fact, which you didn’t
appear to understand. I came on my own business. You may know
that I am to leave Plympton to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Have you got a place yet?" asked James with a sneer.</p>

<p>"What kind of a place?"</p>

<p>"I had an idea that you were going to learn a trade."</p>

<p>"Did you? Where did you get the idea from?"</p>

<p>"You’ve lost your money, haven’t you?"</p>

<p>"So they say."</p>

<p>"And have got to earn your living."</p>

<p>"You appear to know all about my affairs. Probably you’re right.
Perhaps you could assist me by some suggestion."</p>

<p>"If we hadn’t a stable-boy already, I would ask father to take
you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom quietly. "It’s a good thing to have friends
when you’re hard up, but I don’t think I’ll trouble you. There
is one favor you can do me, however."</p>

<p>"If James can conscientiously do you a favor," said the lawyer
guardedly, "I shall not object to his doing it."</p>

<p>"Oh, it won’t hurt his conscience," said Tom laughing. "At any
rate it ought not."</p>

<p>"I think the tone you employ is hardly appropriate, as you are
going to ask a favor."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked James, who felt rather curious, and had no
idea what Tom meant. If he had he would not have felt so complacent.</p>

<p>"Why," said Tom, "I feel a little delicate, but as I am leaving
Plympton, and am likely to need the money, I should like to have
James pay me the money I have lent him at different times."</p>

<p>James flushed and looked uncomfortable. His father asked hastily:</p>

<p>"James, have you borrowed money of Thomas?"</p>

<p>"I borrowed a trifle on two or three occasions," James admitted
reluctantly.</p>

<p>"A trifle! How much?"</p>

<p>"Here is the statement," said Tom. "It amounts to fifteen dollars
and a half altogether."</p>

<p>"It can’t be!" said James.</p>

<p>"You may look over the items," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Give me the paper," said the lawyer.</p>

<p>"James, is this correct?" he demanded rather sternly.</p>

<p>"I am almost sure it isn’t," said James. "I am sure he has put
down more than I borrowed."</p>

<p>"You know that is false, James Davenport," said Tom contemptuously.</p>

<p>"I didn’t think you were so mean as to get everything down,"
said James.</p>

<p>"I did it because I always keep an account of the money I spend,"
said Tom; "but I will tell you frankly I should never have asked
you to repay it, if you had not chosen to sneer at my loss of
fortune."</p>

<p>"Did you expect my son to treat you just the same as when you
were rich?" asked Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>"No, for I knew him too well," said Tom significantly.</p>

<p>"He has acted in a manner entirely proper," said Mrs. Davenport
with emphasis, "and I venture to say that my daughter, Imogene,
agrees with me."</p>

<p>"I do, ma," said Imogene.</p>

<p>"Right, my daughter," said her mother approvingly.</p>

<p>Tom looked at Imogene attentively, but made no comment. He expressed
no surprise, for he felt none.</p>

<p>"If you were about to remain in Plympton," said Mrs. Davenport,
"I should feel compelled to say that my son and daughter could
no longer associate with you on terms of equality."</p>

<p>"It is fortunate that I am going then," said Tom. "I really don’t
think I could live in Plympton if I were deprived of their society."</p>

<p>"You might see us occasionally if you became our stable-boy,"
said James.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tom, "but I must decline. I am afraid you would
want to borrow all my wages."</p>

<p>"You are impertinent," said James angrily.</p>

<p>"So are you," said Tom with spirit.</p>

<p>"Hush, James!" said his father. "Such discussion is unseemly.
In regard to these sums you have lent my son, Thomas," he proceeded,
"I should be justified in refusing to repay them, since they were
lent to a minor, who, in the eyes of the law, has no right to
contract debts."</p>

<p>"Do as you like," said Tom. "If you are unwilling to pay it,
James may regard it as a present from me."</p>

<p>"I should not wish my son to remain under such an obligation,
and I am quite aware that your present circumstances will not
justify you in making so large a present, or indeed any at all.
I therefore repay you."</p>

<p>Tom received the bank-notes and put them in his pocket-book.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said, "both for the money and the consideration
for my poverty. I won’t occupy any more of your time, but will
bid you all good-by. I should be glad to have you send good-by
to Mary Somers when you write."</p>

<p>"I’ll do it," said James. "By the way, you would be a good match
for her. She hasn’t got a cent, and can’t expect anything better
than being a mechanic’s wife."</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to accept a mechanic for a cousin?" asked
Tom, smiling.</p>

<p>"We shouldn’t need to be intimate."</p>

<p>"Very true. That’s a comfort. But we won’t look too far ahead.
Good-by."</p>

<p>And Tom withdrew.</p>

<p>"What a ridiculous pride that boy has," said Mrs. Davenport.</p>

<p>"He’s very impudent," said James.</p>

<p>"I’m glad he’s gone," said Imogene.</p>

<p>"Very probably you will never meet again," said her father; "if
you do, you can be very distant."</p>

<p>Poor Tom! A few hours had made a great difference in the demeanor
of the Davenports toward him. Such is life!</p>
