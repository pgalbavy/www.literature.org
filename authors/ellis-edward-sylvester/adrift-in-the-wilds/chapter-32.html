<p>The Newfoundland, Terror, occasioned more apprehension to his
friends than did anything else. They came to see that no personal
danger threatened so long as the fire kept burning, and as there
was an abundance of fuel, this settled that point; but the dog
grew enraged at the furious uproar, which drove away all sleep,
and appeared to give him fear that the entire party were in danger.</p>

<p>Several times, when some of the wolverines came too close, he
made a spring at them, and they snapped back. But the good sense
of the dog kept him from venturing among the ravenous brutes,
and they in turn were in too much dread of the fire to do more
than spring at him and then as quickly dart back again.</p>

<p>It was an impressive sight and one which could never be forgotten.
The large, noble Newfoundland, standing out in relief against
the glare of the camp-fire, his eyes aflame with anger, every
muscle braced, the jaws parted and his eyes fixed upon the dark
bodies plunging over each other, darting forward and back again,
snapping, snarling and furious; the Pah Utah stretched upon the
ground, deliberately smoking, all unheedful of the deafening clangor
and the savage brutes that sometimes approached almost within
striking distance; the two boys, so close to the fire that they
were often scorched by it, gazing at the animals with an expression
of half fear and half wonder, starting when one of them came unusually
near, and now and then sending the fatal bullet among them; the
nervous Irishman, darting hither and thither, taking great care
that the fire was kept fully burning; all these, we say, made
a scene impressive in the highest degree.</p>

<p>Terror, when sharply spoken to, would withdraw from his dangerous
proximity to the wolverines, but almost immediately he stepped
forward to the same spot he first occupied, and his obedience
to the commands of the boys was so sullen and ill-natured that
they forebore speaking to him except when his safety seemed absolutely
to demand it.</p>

<p>At times there was an interruption in the clamor, but the wolverines
did not appear to relax their vigilance in the least. It was as
if they had determined to make their evening meal upon the party
though they were forced to wait until morning for it. During these
intervals of comparative silence our friends gained opportunity
for the exchange of a few words, but they were often compelled
to shout at the top of their voices to make themselves heard.</p>

<p>During one of these lulls Elwood spoke to Howard.</p>

<p>"What will take place in the morning, when these creatures are
not afraid of our fire?"</p>

<p>"I think they will go away."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so: but we are not so sure of that."</p>

<p>"Shasta will no doubt turn the whole thing over in his mind,
and be prompt enough to act when the danger comes. I suppose we
can take to our canoes and give them the slip in that manner."</p>

<p>"Yes; the Indian appears to have rather a contemptible opinion
of them. He scarcely heeds their wrangling."</p>

<p>"He is not so timid as we and Tim are; but he doesn't forget
to look at them once in a while, so as not to forget what they
are doing."</p>

<p>"They are a savage set of animals. How angry Terror is! Don't
you notice that they are trying to entice him to venture out a
little nearer them? They hate him more than all of us."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"You can see it in their manner. If they can once get hold of
him they will tear him to shreds."</p>

<p>"And they will catch him, too, if he isn't careful. He is so
surly and cross himself that it is dangerous to touch or speak
to him."</p>

<p>"We can't afford to lose him. We must watch, and if he gets too
close to any of them, why, all we shall have to do is to crack
them over, and give the others warning to keep their distance."</p>

<p>While they were speaking a huge wolverine darted close enough
to strike Terror. Instantly the two closed and rolled upon the
ground in the fierce death struggle. Over and over, snapping,
snarling, growling, biting, scratching with lightning-like fierceness,
now one below and then the other, and finally the dog on top.</p>

<p>The conflict was as short as it was furious. The massive jaws
of the Newfoundland closed on the throat of his antagonist and
his teeth met through his windpipe. There they stuck for a minute,
and when he relaxed his hold it was all over with the reckless
animal.</p>

<p>Still it would have fared ill with the dog but for Shasta, for
the other wolverines would have sprung upon him and destroyed
him before he could have escaped. At the moment the two closed
the Indian darted forward, seized a brand and flourished it over
the combatants. This so terrified the others that they kept their
distance until the conqueror resumed his place in triumph by the
fire.</p>

<p>This encounter proved it lesson to both the dog and the wolverines.
The latter appeared to comprehend the disadvantage under which
they were placed, while Terror, having had a taste of their mettle,
was satisfied for the time, and kept a safe position further away
from the brutes that were so eager to fasten their teeth in him.</p>

<p>It was now verging toward morning, and the Pah Utah looked about
him as if he were going to make his preparations for moving. He
looked toward the raging creatures, still fierce and furious,
and then glanced at the canoes drawn up within a few feet of the
camp-fire, and pointed toward them and the river.</p>

<p>Fortunately but a few feet intervened between their present position
and the stream, so that the latter was easy of access in case
it should become necessary to retreat before the wolverines. Still
the fire did not protect this enough to make it a safe undertaking
in their present situation.</p>

<p>Shasta picked up several blazing sticks, and carrying them to
the water's edge, placed them together and covered them with some
dry brush-wood. They speedily fanned themselves into a flame,
and the gathering brutes withdrew and offered a fine approach
to the river.</p>

<p>The Indian's next proceeding was to launch the two boats. This
was done easily and without difficulty. The blankets and guns
were placed within, and then motioned for the dog to follow; but
Terror did not seem disposed to leave his present quarters. Perhaps
the idea worked its way into his shaggy head that it savored too
much of deserting his friends, or it may be that he still coveted
a taste for another collision with the audacious animals that
had pressed him so sorely.</p>

<p>Our brave soldier boys, who abhor bloodshed from a principle,
still have a love for the wild abandon of camp life, and many
a one looks back with a sigh to the rough experiences which we
all pray may never come again. So it may be the Newfoundland,
naturally peaceful, having had his blood fairly roused by his
tussle and triumph, yet longed for more of victory.</p>

<p>Finally Howard and Elwood took their seats, and Tim O'Rooney
followed; then Terror, casting one reluctant look behind him,
jumped into the boat and lay down in his usual position; and so,
at length, they all were embarked in safety.</p>
