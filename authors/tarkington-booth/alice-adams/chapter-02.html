<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>In fact, the agitation of Mrs. Adams was genuine, but so well
under her control that its traces vanished during the three short
steps she took to cross the narrow hall between her husband's
door and the one opposite. Her expression was matter-of-course,
rather than pathetic, as she entered the pretty room where her
daughter, half dressed, sat before a dressing-table and played
with the reflections of a three-leafed mirror framed in blue enamel.
That is, just before the moment of her mother's entrance, Alice
had been playing with the mirror's reflections&mdash;posturing her
arms and her expressions, clasping her hands behind her neck,
and tilting back her head to foreshorten the face in a tableau
conceived to represent sauciness, then one of smiling weariness,
then one of scornful toleration, and all very piquant; but as
the door opened she hurriedly resumed the practical, and occupied
her hands in the arrangement of her plentiful brownish hair.</p>

<p>They were pretty hands, of a shapeliness delicate and fine. "The
best things she's got!" a cold-blooded girl friend said of them,
and meant to include Alice's mind and character in the implied
list of possessions surpassed by the notable hands. However that
may have been, the rest of her was well enough. She was often
called "a right pretty girl"&mdash;temperate praise meaning a girl
rather pretty than otherwise, and this she deserved, to say the
least. Even in repose she deserved it, though repose was anything
but her habit, being seldom seen upon her except at home. On exhibition
she led a life of gestures, the unkind said to make her lovely
hands more memorable; but all of her usually accompanied the gestures
of the hands, the shoulders ever giving them their impulses first,
and even her feet being called upon, at the same time, for eloquence.</p>

<p>So much liveliness took proper place as only accessory to that
of the face, where her vivacity reached its climax; and it was
unfortunate that an ungifted young man, new in the town, should
have attempted to define the effect upon him of all this generosity
of emphasis. He said that "the way she used her cute hazel eyes
and the wonderful glow of her facial expression gave her a mighty
spiritual quality." His actual rendition of the word was "spirichul";
but it was not his pronunciation that embalmed this outburst in
the perennial laughter of Alice's girl friends; they made the
misfortune far less his than hers.</p>

<p>Her mother comforted her too heartily, insisting that Alice had
"plenty enough spiritual qualities," certainly more than possessed
by the other girls who flung the phrase at her, wooden things,
jealous of everything they were incapable of themselves; and then
Alice, getting more championship than she sought, grew uneasy
lest Mrs. Adams should repeat such defenses "outside the family";
and Mrs. Adams ended by weeping because the daughter so distrusted
her intelligence. Alice frequently thought it necessary to instruct
her mother.</p>

<p>Her morning greeting was an instruction to-day; or, rather, it
was an admonition in the style of an entreaty, the more petulant
as Alice thought that Mrs. Adams might have had a glimpse of the
posturings to the mirror. This was a needless worry; the mother
had caught a thousand such glimpses, with Alice unaware, and she
thought nothing of the one just flitted.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, mama, come clear inside the room and shut
the door! <em>PLEASE </em>don't leave it open for everybody to
look at me!"</p>

<p>"There isn't anybody to see you," Mrs. Adams explained, obeying.
"Miss Perry's gone downstairs, and&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Mama, I heard you in papa's room," Alice said, not dropping
the note of complaint. "I could hear both of you, and I don't
think you ought to get poor old papa so upset&mdash;not in his present
condition, anyhow."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams seated herself on the edge of the bed. "He's better
all the time," she said, not disturbed. "He's almost well. The
doctor says so and Miss Perry says so; and if we don't get him
into the right frame of mind now we never will. The first day
he's outdoors he'll go back to that old hole&mdash;you'll see! And
if he once does that, he'll settle down there and it'll be too
late and we'll never get him out."</p>

<p>"Well, anyhow, I think you could use a little more tact with
him."</p>

<p>"I do try to," the mother sighed. "It never was much use with
him. I don't think you understand him as well as I do, Alice."</p>

<p>"There's one thing I don't understand about either of you," Alice
returned, crisply. "Before people get married they can do anything
they want to with each other. Why can't they do the same thing
after they're married? When you and papa were young people and
engaged, he'd have done anything you wanted him to. That must
have been because you knew how to manage him then. Why can't you
go at him the same way now?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams sighed again, and laughed a little, making no other
response; but Alice persisted. "Well, <em>WHY </em>can't you?
Why can't you ask him to do things the way you used to ask him
when you were just in love with each other? Why don't you anyhow
try it, mama, instead of ding-donging at him?"</p>

<p>"'Ding-donging at him,' Alice?" Mrs. Adams said, with a pathos
somewhat emphasized. "Is that how my trying to do what I can for
you strikes you?"</p>

<p>"Never mind that; it's nothing to hurt your feelings." Alice
disposed of the pathos briskly. "Why don't you answer my question?
What's the matter with using a little more tact on papa? Why can't
you treat him the way you probably did when you were young people,
before you were married? I never have understood why people can't
do that."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you <em>WILL </em>understand some day," her mother said,
gently. "Maybe you will when you've been married twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"You keep evading. Why don't you answer my question right straight
out?"</p>

<p>"There are questions you can't answer to young people, Alice."</p>

<p>"You mean because we're too young to understand the answer? I
don't see that at all. At twenty-two a girl's supposed to have
some intelligence, isn't she? And intelligence is the ability
to understand, isn't it? Why do I have to wait till I've lived
with a man twenty-five years to understand why you can't be tactful
with papa?"</p>

<p>"You may understand some things before that," Mrs. Adams said,
tremulously. "You may understand how you hurt me sometimes. Youth
can't know everything by being intelligent, and by the time you
could understand the answer you're asking for you'd know it, and
wouldn't need to ask. You don't understand your father, Alice;
you don't know what it takes to change him when he's made up his
mind to be stubborn."</p>

<p>Alice rose and began to get herself into a skirt. "Well, I don't
think making scenes ever changes anybody," she grumbled. "I think
a little jolly persuasion goes twice as far, myself."</p>

<p>"'A little jolly persuasion!'" Her mother turned the echo of
this phrase into an ironic lament. "Yes, there was a time when
I thought that, too! It didn't work; that's all."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you left the 'jolly' part of it out, mama."</p>

<p>For the second time that morning&mdash;it was now a little after seven
o'clock&mdash;tears seemed about to offer their solace to Mrs. Adams.
"I might have expected you to say that, Alice; you never do miss
a chance,"  she said, gently. "It seems queer you don't some time
miss just <em>ONE </em>chance!"</p>

<p>But Alice, progressing with her toilet, appeared to be little
concerned. "Oh, well, I think there are better ways of managing
a man than just hammering at him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams uttered a little cry of pain. "'Hammering,' Alice?"</p>

<p>"If you'd left it entirely to me," her daughter went on, briskly,
"I believe papa'd already be willing to do anything we want him
to."</p>

<p>"That's it; tell me I spoil everything. Well, I won't interfere
from now on, you can be sure of it."</p>

<p>"Please don't talk like that," Alice said, quickly. "I'm old
enough to realize that papa may need pressure of all sorts; I
only think it makes him more obstinate to get him cross. You probably
do understand him better, but that's one thing I've found out
and you haven't. There!"  She gave her mother a friendly tap on
the shoulder and went to the door. "I'll hop in and say hello
to him now."</p>

<p>As she went, she continued the fastening of her blouse, and appeared
in her father's room with one hand still thus engaged, but she
patted his forehead with the other.</p>

<p>"Poor old papa-daddy!" she said, gaily. "Every time he's better
somebody talks him into getting so mad he has a relapse. It's
a shame!"</p>

<p>Her father's eyes, beneath their melancholy brows, looked up
at her wistfully. "I suppose you heard your mother going for me,"
he said.</p>

<p>"I heard you going for her, too!" Alice laughed. "What was it
all about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the same danged old story!"</p>

<p>"You mean she wants you to try something new when you get well?"
Alice asked, with cheerful innocence. "So we could all have a
lot more money?"</p>

<p>At this his sorrowful forehead was more sorrowful than ever.
The deep horizontal lines moved upward to a pattern of suffering
so familiar to his daughter that it meant nothing to her; but
he spoke quietly. "Yes; so we wouldn't have any money at all,
most likely."</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she laughed, and, finishing with her blouse, patted
his cheeks with both hands. "Just think how many grand openings
there must be for a man that knows as much as you do! I always
did believe you could get rich if you only cared to, papa."</p>

<p>But upon his forehead the painful pattern still deepened. "Don't
you think we've always had enough, the way things are, Alice?"</p>

<p>"Not the way things <em>ARE!" </em>She patted his cheeks again;
laughed again. "It used to be enough, maybe anyway we did skimp
along on it&mdash;but the way things are now I expect mama's really
pretty practical in her ideas, though, I think it's a shame for
her to bother you about it while you're so weak. Don't you worry
about it, though; just think about other things till you get strong."</p>

<p>"You know," he said; "you know it isn't exactly the easiest thing
in the world for a man of my age to find these grand openings
you speak of. And when you've passed half-way from fifty to sixty
you're apt to see some risk in giving up what you know how to
do and trying something new."</p>

<p>"My, what a frown!" she cried, blithely. "Didn't I tell you to
stop thinking about it till you get <em>ALL </em>well?" She bent
over him, giving him a gay little kiss on the bridge of his nose.
"There! I must run to breakfast. Cheer up now! Au 'voir!" And
with her pretty hand she waved further encouragement from the
closing door as she departed.</p>

<p>Lightsomely descending the narrow stairway, she whistled as she
went, her fingers drumming time on the rail; and, still whistling,
she came into the dining-room, where her mother and her brother
were already at the table. The brother, a thin and sallow boy
of twenty, greeted her without much approval as she took her place.</p>

<p>"Nothing seems to trouble you!" he said.</p>

<p>"No; nothing much," she made airy response. "What's troubling
yourself, Walter?"</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you!" he returned, seeming to consider
this to be repartee of an effective sort; for he furnished a short
laugh to go with it, and turned to his coffee with the manner
of one who has satisfactorily closed an episode.</p>

<p>"Walter always seems to have so many secrets!" Alice said, studying
him shrewdly, but with a friendly enough amusement in her scrutiny.
"Everything he does or says seems to be acted for the benefit
of some mysterious audience inside himself, and he always gets
its applause. Take what he said just now: he seems to think it
means something, but if it does, why, that's just another secret
between him and the secret audience inside of him! We don't really
know anything about Walter at all, do we, mama?"</p>

<p>Walter laughed again, in a manner that sustained her theory well
enough; then after finishing his coffee, he took from his pocket
a flattened packet in glazed blue paper; extracted with stained
fingers a bent and wrinkled little cigarette, lighted it, hitched
up his belted trousers with the air of a person who turns from
trifles to things better worth his attention, and left the room.</p>

<p>Alice laughed as the door closed. "He's <em>ALL </em>secrets,"
she said. "Don't you think you really ought to know more about
him, mama?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure he's a good boy," Mrs. Adams returned, thoughtfully.
"He's been very brave about not being able to have the advantages
that are enjoyed by the boys he's grown up with. I've never heard
a word of complaint from him."</p>

<p>"About his not being sent to college?" Alice cried. "I should
think you wouldn't! He didn't even have enough ambition to finish
high school!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams sighed. "It seemed to me Walter lost his ambition
when nearly all the boys he'd grown up with went to Eastern schools
to prepare for college, and we couldn't afford to send him. If
only your father would have listened&#11834;"</p>

<p>Alice interrupted: "What nonsense! Walter hated books and studying,
and athletics, too, for that matter. He doesn't care for anything
nice that I ever heard of. What do you suppose he does like, mama?
He must like something or other somewhere, but what do you suppose
it is? What does he do with his time?"</p>

<p>"Why, the poor boy's at Lamb and Company's all day. He doesn't
get through until five in the afternoon; he doesn't <em>HAVE </em>much
time."</p>

<p>"Well, we never have dinner until about seven, and he's always
late for dinner, and goes out, heaven knows where, right afterward!"
Alice shook her head. "He used to go with our friends' boys, but
I don't think he does now."</p>

<p>"Why, how could he?" Mrs. Adams protested. "That isn't his fault,
poor child! The boys he knew when he was younger are nearly all
away at college."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he doesn't see anything of 'em when they're here at
holiday-time or vacation. None of 'em come to the house any more."</p>

<p>"I suppose he's made other friends. It's natural for him to want
companions, at his age."</p>

<p>"Yes," Alice said, with disapproving emphasis. "But who are they?
I've got an idea he plays pool at some rough place down-town."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; I'm sure he's a steady boy," Mrs. Adams protested, but
her tone was not that of thoroughgoing conviction, and she added,
"Life might be a very different thing for him if only your father
can be brought to see&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Never mind, mama! It isn't me that has to be convinced, you
know; and we can do a lot more with papa if we just let him alone
about it for a day or two. Promise me you won't say any more to
him until&mdash;well, until he's able to come downstairs to table.
Will you?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams bit her lip, which had begun to tremble. "I think
you can trust me to know a <em>FEW </em>things, Alice," she said.
"I'm a little older than you, you know."</p>

<p>"That's a good girl!" Alice jumped up, laughing. "Don't forget
it's the same as a promise, and do just cheer him up a little.
I'll say good-bye to him before I go out."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got lots to do. I thought I'd run out to Mildred's
to see what she's going to wear to-night, and then I want to go
down and buy a yard of chiffon and some narrow ribbon to make
new bows for my slippers&mdash;you'll have to give me some money&#11834;"</p>

<p>"If he'll give it to me!" her mother lamented, as they went toward
the front stairs together; but an hour later she came into Alice's
room with a bill in her hand.</p>

<p>"He has some money in his bureau drawer," she said. "He finally
told me where it was."</p>

<p>There were traces of emotion in her voice, and Alice, looking
shrewdly at her, saw moisture in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Mama!" she cried. "You didn't do what you promised me you wouldn't,
did you &mdash;<em>NOT </em>before Miss Perry!"</p>

<p>"Miss Perry's getting him some broth," Mrs. Adams returned, calmly.
"Besides, you're mistaken in saying I promised you anything; I
said I thought you could trust me to know what is right."</p>

<p>"So you did bring it up again!" And Alice swung away from her,
strode to her father's door, flung it open, went to him, and put
a light hand soothingly over his unrelaxed forehead.</p>

<p>"Poor old papa!" she said. "It's a shame how everybody wants
to trouble him. He shan't be bothered any more at all! He doesn't
need to have everybody telling him how to get away from that old
hole he's worked in so long and begin to make us all nice and
rich. HE knows how!"</p>

<p>Thereupon she kissed him a consoling good-bye, and made another
gay departure, the charming hand again fluttering like a white
butterfly in the shadow of the closing door.</p>
