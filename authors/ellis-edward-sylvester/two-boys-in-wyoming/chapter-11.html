<p>The boys remained standing at the mouth of the cavern until the
guide disappeared on the other side of the little plateau. Then
they looked at each other and smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, it appears that we are to have another day to ourselves,"
said Jack; "and we can't gain anything by waiting, so let's be
off."</p>

<p>Nothing could be more satisfactory to Fred, and the two took
nearly the same course as their friend, who passed from sight
but a short time before. They had no intention, however, of following
him, for that would have been displeasing to the veteran, who,
had he desired their company, would have asked for it.</p>

<p>Without any definite object in mind, they took substantially
the route of the previous afternoon. Sooner than they anticipated,
they found themselves on the margin of the canyon that had been
the scene of so stirring an experience, but the point where they
reached it was deeper in the mountains.</p>

<p>"Jack, we can't be very far from that break that Hank spoke of;
let's hunt it up."</p>

<p>"I am willing; but before we do so we'll peep over the side,
to see whether he or anyone else is there."</p>

<p>No change was to be noted in the appearance of the tiny stream
at the enormous depth, but neither friend nor stranger was in
sight. They did not expect to see any one, and began moving along
the side of the stupendous fissure in their search for the place
where Hank had entered it. From what he said it could not be far
off, but they were disappointed before reaching the right point.
A gradual descent of the sides was notable, and continued until
the depth of the canyon was decreased one-half, while the roar
became more audible.</p>

<p>"We can't be far from the break," said Jack; "that is, if this
descent continues."</p>

<p>They found, however, a few minutes later, that it did not continue,
but began to increase, until they were fully as elevated above
the bottom of the gorge as at the point where they had leaped
it. The width also varied continually, sometimes being only three
or four feet, while in others it expanded to nearly ten times
that extent. They did not pause to look over the margin again,
for their aim was to reach the place referred to by their friend.</p>

<p>At the moment when they began to wonder whether a mistake had
not been made they came upon the break. Both banks sloped downward
so abruptly that it would have been laborious for the two to work
their way to the bottom, or from the bottom to the top, though
the masses of boulders, with the tough pines growing almost the
whole distance, offered secure foothold.</p>

<p>The picture was an interesting one. At the point where the stream
issued from the canyon, its width was about twenty yards. It flowed
swiftly, but quickly slackened its pace, since its expansion was
fully a hundred feet. This flowed for probably double that distance,
when the high banks again appeared, and what may be called the
regular canyon was resumed.</p>

<p>Jack and Fred sat down to survey the curious picture. They noticed
that the canyon seemed to be dotted at intervals with rocks, some
of which rose to a considerable height above the current. Many
were near one side or the other, while others were in the middle
of the swift stream, which dashed against them with a violence
that threw the spray and foam high in air. It was easy to believe
that Hank Hazletine had made his way up the canyon by leaping
from rock to rock, with little more result than the wetting of
his shoes.</p>

<p>"It might be done in the daytime," said Jack, "but I should not
want to try it at night."</p>

<p>"The water must be very deep in many places; and flows so fast
that the strongest swimmer couldn't help himself. I should prefer
to climb the wall, as Hank did."</p>

<p>"But that would be dangerous in the darkness."</p>

<p>"The best thing we can do is to do neither," observed Fred, with
a laugh. "I have a good deal of curiosity to know what led Hank
to pick his way up the canyon, but I haven't enough to lead me
to follow him&#11834;"</p>

<p>Jack Dudley suddenly gripped the arm of his friend and drew him
back from the boulder on which they had been sitting. Fred nearly
lost his balance, and did not know what to make of the proceeding
until both checked themselves at a safe distance and cautiously
peeped forth. Then the cause of Jack's excitement became apparent.</p>

<p>From the pines on the other side of the stream, and near the
middle of the depressed portion, three Indians stepped into view.
The first anxiety of the youths was to learn whether Motoza was
one of them; but he was not. All were strangers.</p>

<p>They were dressed much the same as the vagrant Sioux, and, like
him, their faces were painted, and their coarse black hair dangled
loosely about their shoulders. They were armed with rifles; but
two of the weapons seemed to be the long, old-fashioned muzzle-loaders,
while the third carried a Winchester. Although they emerged from
the pines in Indian file, they spread apart and walked beside
one another to the edge of the broad stream, where they stopped,
as if that were the end of their journey.</p>

<p>Their gestures showed they were talking energetically, though
of course not the slightest murmur reached the youths, who took
care to screen themselves from view while cautiously peeping forth.
Even after the warning words of their guide they felt no special
alarm, for they believed the red men were from the reservation
near by, and would not harm any one. If they attempted it, Jack
and Fred felt they had the advantage of position, sheltered behind
the rocks, far above their enemies, down upon whom they could
fire with their Winchesters, should the necessity arise.</p>

<p>It was quite certain that the three belonged to one of the hunting
parties whose signal-smoke the boys had seen earlier in the day.
Their action was curious. They did not look up the bank, so that
the boys might have been more careless without being discovered;
but it was apparent that two of them were arguing with the third,
who was more excited than either of his companions. Finally he
turned away and made as if to pass up the canyon, after the manner
of Hank Hazletine. He leaped out upon one of the rocks, then bounded
as lightly to another, and then to a third, which took him within
the canyon. The others watched him without protest or action.</p>

<p>Evidently the Indian who had started off so hurriedly was more
impulsive than his companions, for after his third leap he remained
standing on the rock; and, although it would have been easy for
him to spring to the next leading up the canyon, he refrained
from doing do. Instead, he looked around, and then deliberately
rejoined his friends, who showed no surprise over his reverse
movement. They spoke only a few words to one another, when they
moved back in Indian file toward the growth of pines, among which
they passed from sight and were seen no more.</p>

<p>"That was a queer performance," remarked Jack; "it looked to
me as if that first fellow wanted his companions to go up the
canyon with him, and when they refused he started off by himself."</p>

<p>"Only to change his mind."</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of that; but it strikes me as strange
that there should be something up there to attract them as well
as Hank."</p>

<p>"Some day Hank will tell us about it. Do you observe, young man,
that the forenoon is well along and we haven't had a sight of
any game?"</p>

<p>With no thought of the Indians whom they had just seen, the boys
began retracing their steps. Inasmuch as it was on the other side
of the gorge that they had gained the shot at the buck, the feeling
was strong that they should pass it again and push their hunt
in that direction.</p>

<p>It did not require long to find a spot where the fissure was
easily leaped. In fact, the exploit was becoming quite an everyday
thing with them.</p>

<p>"We are not far from the spot where we killed that rattler yesterday,"
said Fred, recognizing several landmarks. "I wonder whether there
are any more near us&#11834;"</p>

<p>At that instant Fred uttered a gasp and leaped several feet from
the ground, while his companion was hardly a second behind him.
Both had heard the well-remembered whir at the same moment, and
bounded away several steps before pausing to look back.</p>

<p>Remarkable as it might seem, a second specimen of the <em>crotalus</em>,
fully as large as the other, lay on the flat surface of a rock
only a few inches above the ground. Evidently it was sunning itself
when thus disturbed by the approach of the young hunters, at sight
of whom it threw itself into coil. The boys were not in danger,
for the warning was sounded while they were still a number of
paces distant.</p>

<p>Feeling safe, they stood still and surveyed the hideous thing.
They agreed that it was larger than the other, and seemed to be
darker in color. But for the fact that the reptiles were on opposite
sides of the canyon, it might be believed they were mates. The
head and tail were elevated, the latter vibrating with the swift,
hazy appearance at the end of the rattles which they had noted
before.</p>

<p>Jack repeated the oft-quoted expression: "The heel of the woman
shall bruise the serpent's head," and added: "I suppose nine persons
out of every ten, when they see any kind of a snake, are seized
with an impulse to kill it."</p>

<p>"Even though many are harmless and useful."</p>

<p>"I think the best use you can put a rattlesnake to is to blow
him into smithereens, which is what I am going to do."</p>

<p>As he spoke, Jack brought his Winchester to a level and sighted
carefully at the pitted head of the serpent. He was deliberate,
and did not press the trigger until sure his aim was accurate
to a hair.</p>

<p>Fred kept his eye on that head. At the instant the sharp crack
of the rifle rang out the frightful object vanished, and the long
body broke into fierce writhings. Jack had clipped off the head
as neatly as if with the blow of a scimitar, the bullet shattering
the neck just below, and at its narrowest portion.</p>

<p>"That's as well as I could have done myself," commented Fred,
as his friend lowered his weapon and watched the struggles of
his victim, which quickly ceased, for, as has been said, the <em>crotalus</em>
species is easily killed, and when one of them has been decapitated
he cannot keep up appearances very long.</p>

<p>When it became certain the reptile was dead the boys drew near
for a closer inspection. They counted the rattles, which were
seventeen in number, proving the reptile of extraordinary size.</p>

<p>"We didn't think to count those of the other," said Fred, "but
I am sure it was not so large as this."</p>

<p>"No; but I wonder whether we are going to stumble over them at
every step?"</p>

<p>"This is only the second one; we may not see another for a week."</p>

<p>"I hope we shall not; but so long as they are kind enough to
give us notice of their intentions we ought to be able to avoid
their bites."</p>

<p>It looked as if their experience of the previous day was to be
repeated, for within a hundred yards from the spot an animal was
discovered on a rock, a considerable distance above them. Fred
was the first to see it, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"There's another buck, Jack! It's your turn."</p>

<p>But before Jack could bring his weapon to a level the animal
saw them and was off like a flash. In fact they had no more than
a glimpse of it&mdash;barely enough to see that it had no antlers,
and probably was not a deer at all.</p>

<p>"It isn't going to be as easy work as we thought," said Fred;
"I shouldn't be surprised if we fail to get a shot to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, we shall have the fun of tramping ourselves tired. It
seems to me that when any sort of game shows itself it comes out
in plain sight and is not scared up by us. Let's sit down a while
and watch things around us."</p>

<p>This singular proposal was acted upon. After picking their way
some distance further among the rocks they chose a seat, and then
looked searchingly here and there at the different elevations
and prominent points, in the hope of catching sight of some game
which would give them a shot before dashing off with headlong
haste.</p>

<p>"Right over that part of the mountain peak yonder," said Jack,
pointing at the place, "I saw the moon rise last night. I have
watched it come out of the ocean many a time, but never saw anything
so beautiful before."</p>

<p>He described as best he could the impressive scene, while Fred
listened, and for the first time felt regret that he had not been
awakened that he, too, might have enjoyed the view.</p>

<p>When he had studied the mountain peak for some minutes, he raised
his glass and surveyed it steadily for a while longer.</p>

<p>"I thought so," he remarked; "turn your glass, Jack, in that
direction."</p>

<p>Jack did as requested, and saw to what his comrade referred.
Perched on the highest portion was an immense gray-headed eagle.
Sailing thither from the depths of space, he had paused for a
while, with the grand view spread out before him, and what a view
it must have been!</p>

<p>It was easy to identify the bird with the aid of their glasses,
which were kept pointed for some time at him.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether he sees us?" said Fred.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt of it, for their eyes detect the smallest
object on a landscape. He is probably studying us with as much
interest as we are watching him."</p>

<p>"Our rifles couldn't carry a ball half-way to him."</p>

<p>"And what if they could? Would you wish to harm the emblem of
our country?"</p>

<p>"No; unless he attacked us, which I don't think is likely. Halloo!"</p>

<p>Just then the immense bird spread his wings and began skimming
through the air with majestic grace. More than that, he was coming
in the direction of the boys.</p>

<p>"I believe he means to make a meal off of us!" exclaimed Fred;
"we would better be ready for him."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be frightened at. If he intends to attack
us we have only to wait until he is near, when we can puncture
him."</p>

<p>If the king of birds held any such intention he changed his mind.
Swooping far across the intervening space, seemingly aiming straight
at them, he suddenly changed his course, and, ascending high in
the sky, swept around in a wide circle and finally disappeared
over the peak where first seen.</p>

<p>The boys sat for a while in silence, gazing away in the distance,
where the noble bird had vanished, half-expecting it to reappear
and probably press its attack; but it had taken its flight for
good and was seen no more.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether we would have done any better if we had brought
a dog with us?" said Jack, beginning to feel a trifle discouraged
over their failure to secure a shot at any game.</p>

<p>"I proposed bringing my dog, you remember, when we left home,
but you thought we could do better out here. Hank and the rest
of them don't seem to place much value on the animals in hunting.
Did you hear that?"</p>

<p>From some point not very far off came the report of a rifle,
though whether it was the weapon of Hank Hazletine or one of the
Indians that had been discharged, neither could guess.</p>

<p>"Somebody else is in luck, and I don't see why we should not&#11834;"</p>

<p>Before Fred could finish his sentence both heard the rustling
of bushes behind them. They turned on the instant, and saw a sight
which held them transfixed, for never had they expected to view
anything of the kind.</p>

<p>They had read and heard much of grizzly bears. They knew they
grew to an enormous size, and are the most formidable animals
found in the great West, but had they been told that there were
such monsters as the one before them they could not have believed
it had it been related by Hazletine himself.</p>

<p>To Jack and Fred he seemed fully four times the size of the largest
black bear they had ever seen in any zoological garden. Had his
legs been longer, Fred Greenwood would have pronounced him the
equal of Jumbo himself.</p>

<p>Where this Colossus among beasts had come from it was impossible
to say, but the terrifying fact was self-evident that he was advancing
to attack the boys!</p>

<p>He must have caught sight of them as they sat on the rock with
their backs toward him, and, angered at the intrusion, he was
sweeping down upon them like a cyclone, furious and determined
to crush them out of existence.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "He was sweeping down upon them like a cyclone."]</p>

<p>The gait of the animal was awkward, but speedier even than the
youths suspected. He swung along with a swaying motion, and his
claws, striking the flinty rocks as he passed over them, rattled
like iron nails. His vast mouth was open, his long red tongue
lolling out, and his white teeth gleaming. As if no element of
terror was to be omitted he uttered a deep, cavernous growl at
every step or two, while his comparatively small black eyes seemed
to glow with a savage light, altogether foreign to the species.</p>

<p>All this was taken in at the first glance of the boys, who, petrified
for one moment, realized in the next their fearful peril.</p>

<p>"There's no time to shoot!" exclaimed Jack; "we must run!"</p>

<p>"But he can run faster than we!" replied Fred, who stood his
ground long enough to bring his Winchester to his shoulder and
let fly straight at the front of the beast. That he struck the
bear was certain, but it served only to add to his towering rage,
and he plunged forward without halt.</p>

<p>Jack had made no attempt to fire, but was running at headlong
speed. Fred was eager to thrust another cartridge into the chamber
of his Winchester from the magazine, but to do so would detain
him until old Ephraim was upon him, and even then it was not likely
the bullet would stay or affect his attack.</p>

<p>Accordingly, instead of firing a second shot he whirled about
and dashed after Jack, who was thus placed about a rod in advance.
Although the ground was not favorable for running, it may be safely
said that neither Jack Dudley nor Fred Greenwood ever gave such
an exhibition of speed. They held fast to their rifles, for it
looked as if the weapons were to be their final reliance.</p>

<p>Fred glanced over his shoulder to learn how he was making out
in the race. With an awful sinking he saw that the grizzly was
gaining fast upon him. Still he dared not pause long enough to
fire, but redoubled his energies, only to catch his foot in a
running vine and plunge forward on his face.</p>
