<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>The journalist from Kansas City was a man of action. He wasted
no words in introducing himself or unfolding his plan of campaign.
"You’ve got to follow me, mister, and not deviate one inch from
my tracks. The explaining part will come later. There’s big business
in this shack tonight." He unlocked the little door with scarcely
a sound, slid the crust of snow from his boots, and preceded me
into a passage as black as a cellar. The door swung smoothly behind
us, and after the sharp out-of-doors the air smelt stuffy as the
inside of a safe.</p>

<p>A hand reached back to make sure that I followed. We appeared
to be in a flagged passage under the main level of the house.
My hobnailed boots slipped on the floor, and I steadied myself
on the wall, which seemed to be of undressed stone. Mr Donne moved
softly and assuredly, for he was better shod for the job than
me, and his guiding hand came back constantly to make sure of
my whereabouts.</p>

<p>I remember that I felt just as I had felt when on that August
night I had explored the crevice of the Coolin—the same sense
that something queer was going to happen, the same recklessness
and contentment. Moving a foot at a time with immense care, we
came to a right-hand turning. Two shallow steps led us to another
passage, and then my groping hands struck a blind wall. The American
was beside me, and his mouth was close to my ear.</p>

<p>"Got to crawl now," he whispered. "You lead, mister, while I
shed this coat of mine. Eight feet on your stomach and then upright."</p>

<p>I wriggled through a low tunnel, broad enough to take three men
abreast, but not two feet high. Half-way through I felt suffocated,
for I never liked holes, and I had a momentary anxiety as to what
we were after in this cellar pilgrimage. Presently I smelt free
air and got on to my knees.</p>

<p>"Right, mister?" came a whisper from behind. My companion seemed
to be waiting till I was through before he followed.</p>

<p>"Right," I answered, and very carefully rose to my feet.</p>

<p>Then something happened behind me. There was a jar and a bump
as if the roof of the tunnel had subsided. I turned sharply and
groped at the mouth. I stuck my leg down and found a block.</p>

<p>"Donne," I said, as loud as I dared, "are you hurt? Where are
you?"</p>

<p>But no answer came.</p>

<p>Even then I thought only of an accident. Something had miscarried,
and I was cut off in the cellars of an unfriendly house away from
the man who knew the road and had a plan in his head. I was not
so much frightened as exasperated. I turned from the tunnel-mouth
and groped into the darkness before me. I might as well prospect
the kind of prison into which I had blundered.</p>

<p>I took three steps—no more. My feet seemed suddenly to go from
me and fly upward. So sudden was it that I fell heavy and dead
like a log, and my head struck the floor with a crash that for
a moment knocked me senseless. I was conscious of something falling
on me and of an intolerable pressure on my chest. I struggled
for breath, and found my arms and legs pinned and my whole body
in a kind of wooden vice. I was sick with concussion, and could
do nothing but gasp and choke down my nausea. The cut in the back
of my head was bleeding freely and that helped to clear my wits,
but I lay for a minute or two incapable of thought. I shut my
eyes tight, as a man does when he is fighting with a swoon.</p>

<p>When I opened them there was light. It came from the left side
of the room, the broad glare of a strong electric torch. I watched
it stupidly, but it gave me the fillip needed to pick up the threads.
I remembered the tunnel now and the Kansas journalist. Then behind
the light I saw a face which pulled my flickering senses out of
the mire.</p>

<p>I saw the heavy ulster and the cap, which I had realised, though
I had not seen, outside in the dark laurels. They belonged to
the journalist, Clarence Donne, the trusted emissary of Blenkiron.
But I saw his face now, and it was that face which I had boasted
to Bullivant I could never mistake again upon earth. I did not
mistake it now, and I remember I had a faint satisfaction that
I had made good my word. I had not mistaken it, for I had not
had the chance to look at it till this moment. I saw with acid
clearness the common denominator of all its disguises—the young
man who lisped in the seaside villa, the stout philanthropist
of Biggleswick, the pulpy panic-stricken creature of the Tube
station, the trim French staff officer of the Picardy château....
I saw more, for I saw it beyond the need of disguise. I was looking
at von Schwabing, the exile, who had done more for Germany than
any army commander.... Mary’s words came back to me—"the most
dangerous man in the world".... I was not afraid, or broken-hearted
at failure, or angry—not yet, for I was too dazed and awestruck.
I looked at him as one might look at some cataclysm of nature
which had destroyed a continent.</p>

<p>The face was smiling.</p>

<p>"I am happy to offer you hospitality at last," it said.</p>

<p>I pulled my wits farther out of the mud to attend to him. The
cross-bar on my chest pressed less hard and I breathed better.
But when I tried to speak, the words would not come.</p>

<p>"We are old friends," he went on. "We have known each other quite
intimately for four years, which is a long time in war. I have
been interested in you, for you have a kind of crude intelligence,
and you have compelled me to take you seriously. If you were cleverer
you would appreciate the compliment. But you were fool enough
to think you could beat me, and for that you must be punished.
Oh no, don’t flatter yourself you were ever dangerous. You were
only troublesome and presumptuous like a mosquito one flicks off
one’s sleeve."</p>

<p>He was leaning against the side of a heavy closed door. He lit
a cigar from a little gold tinder box and regarded me with amused
eyes.</p>

<p>"You will have time for reflection, so I propose to enlighten
you a little. You are an observer of little things. So? Did you
ever see a cat with a mouse? The mouse runs about and hides and
manœuvres and thinks it is playing its own game. But at any moment
the cat can stretch out its paw and put an end to it. You are
the mouse, my poor General—for I believe you are one of those
funny amateurs that the English call Generals. At any moment during
the last nine months I could have put an end to you with a nod."</p>

<p>My nausea had stopped and I could understand what he said, though
I had still no power to reply.</p>

<p>"Let me explain," he went on. "I watched with amusement your
gambols at Biggleswick. My eyes followed you when you went to
the Clyde and in your stupid twistings in Scotland. I gave you
rope, because you were futile, and I had graver things to attend
to. I allowed you to amuse yourself at your British Front with
childish investigations and to play the fool in Paris. I have
followed every step of your course in Switzerland, and I have
helped your idiotic Yankee friend to plot against myself. While
you thought you were drawing your net around me, I was drawing
mine around you. I assure you, it has been a charming relaxation
from serious business."</p>

<p>I knew the man was lying. Some part was true, for he had clearly
fooled Blenkiron; but I remembered the hurried flight from Biggleswick
and Eaucourt Sainte-Anne when the game was certainly against him.
He had me at his mercy, and was wreaking his vanity on me. That
made him smaller in my eyes, and my first awe began to pass.</p>

<p>"I never cherish rancour, you know," he said. "In my business
it is silly to be angry, for it wastes energy. But I do not tolerate
insolence, my dear General. And my country has the habit of doing
justice on her enemies. It may interest you to know that the end
is not far off. Germany has faced a jealous world in arms and
she is about to be justified of her great courage. She has broken
up bit by bit the clumsy organisation of her opponents. Where
is Russia today, the steam-roller that was to crush us? Where
is the poor dupe Rumania? Where is the strength of Italy, who
was once to do wonders for what she called Liberty? Broken, all
of them. I have played my part in that work and now the need is
past. My country with free hands is about to turn upon your armed
rabble in the West and drive it into the Atlantic. Then we shall
deal with the ragged remains of France and the handful of noisy
Americans. By midsummer there will be peace dictated by triumphant
Germany."</p>

<p>"By God, there won’t!" I had found my voice at last.</p>

<p>"By God, there will," he said pleasantly. "It is what you call
a mathematical certainty. You will no doubt die bravely, like
the savage tribes that your Empire used to conquer. But we have
the greater discipline and the stronger spirit and the bigger
brain. Stupidity is always punished in the end, and you are a
stupid race. Do not think that your kinsmen across the Atlantic
will save you. They are a commercial people and by no means sure
of themselves. When they have blustered a little they will see
reason and find some means of saving their faces. Their comic
President will make a speech or two and write us a solemn note,
and we will reply with the serious rhetoric which he loves, and
then we shall kiss and be friends. You know in your heart that
it will be so."</p>

<p>A great apathy seemed to settle on me. This bragging did not
make me angry, and I had no longer any wish to contradict him.
It may have been the result of the fall, but my mind had stopped
working. I heard his voice as one listens casually to the ticking
of a clock.</p>

<p>"I will tell you more," he was saying. "This is the evening of
the 18th day of March. Your generals in France expect an attack,
but they are not sure where it will come. Some think it may be
in Champagne or on the Aisne, some at Ypres, some at St Quentin.
Well, my dear General, you alone will I take into our confidence.
On the morning of the 21st, three days from now, we attack the
right wing of the British Army. In two days we shall be in Amiens.
On the third we shall have driven a wedge as far as the sea. Then
in a week or so we shall have rolled up your army from the right,
and presently we shall be in Boulogne and Calais. After that Paris
falls, and then Peace."</p>

<p>I made no answer. The word "Amiens" recalled Mary, and I was
trying to remember the day in January when she and I had motored
south from that pleasant city.</p>

<p>"Why do I tell you these things? Your intelligence, for you are
not altogether foolish, will have supplied the answer. It is because
your life is over. As your Shakespeare says, the rest is silence....
No, I am not going to kill you. That would be crude, and I hate
crudities. I am going now on a little journey, and when I return
in twenty-four hours’ time you will be my companion. You are going
to visit Germany, my dear General."</p>

<p>That woke me to attention, and he noticed it, for he went on
with gusto.</p>

<p>"You have heard of the <em>Untergrundbahn</em>? No? And you boast
of an Intelligence service! Yet your ignorance is shared by the
whole of your General Staff. It is a little organisation of my
own. By it we can take unwilling and dangerous people inside our
frontier to be dealt with as we please. Some have gone from England
and many from France. Officially I believe they are recorded as
‘missing’, but they did not go astray on any battle-field. They
have been gathered from their homes or from hotels or offices
or even the busy streets. I will not conceal from you that the
service of our Underground Railway is a little irregular from
England and France. But from Switzerland it is smooth as a trunk
line. There are unwatched spots on the frontier, and we have our
agents among the frontier guards, and we have no difficulty about
passes. It is a pretty device, and you will soon be privileged
to observe its working.... In Germany I cannot promise you comfort,
but I do not think your life will be dull."</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, his urbane smile changed to a grin of
impish malevolence. Even through my torpor I felt the venom and
I shivered.</p>

<p>"When I return I shall have another companion." His voice was
honeyed again. "There is a certain pretty lady who was to be the
bait to entice me into Italy. It was so? Well, I have fallen to
the bait. I have arranged that she shall meet me this very night
at a mountain inn on the Italian side. I have arranged, too, that
she shall be alone. She is an innocent child, and I do not think
that she has been more than a tool in the clumsy hands of your
friends. She will come with me when I ask her, and we shall be
a merry party in the Underground Express."</p>

<p>My apathy vanished, and every nerve in me was alive at the words.</p>

<p>"You cur!" I cried. "She loathes the sight of you. She wouldn’t
touch you with the end of a barge-pole."</p>

<p>He flicked the ash from his cigar. "I think you are mistaken.
I am very persuasive, and I do not like to use compulsion with
a woman. But, willing or not, she will come with me. I have worked
hard and I am entitled to my pleasure, and I have set my heart
on that little lady."</p>

<p>There was something in his tone, gross, leering, assured, half
contemptuous, that made my blood boil. He had fairly got me on
the raw, and the hammer beat violently in my forehead. I could
have wept with sheer rage, and it took all my fortitude to keep
my mouth shut. But I was determined not to add to his triumph.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. "Time passes," he said. "I must depart
to my charming assignation. I will give your remembrances to the
lady. Forgive me for making no arrangements for your comfort till
I return. Your constitution is so sound that it will not suffer
from a day’s fasting. To set your mind at rest I may tell you
that escape is impossible. This mechanism has been proved too
often, and if you did break loose from it my servants would deal
with you. But I must speak a word of caution. If you tamper with
it or struggle too much it will act in a curious way. The floor
beneath you covers a shaft which runs to the lake below. Set a
certain spring at work and you may find yourself shot down into
the water far below the ice, where your body will rot till the
spring.... That, of course, is an alternative open to you, if
you do not care to wait for my return."</p>

<p>He lit a fresh cigar, waved his hand, and vanished through the
doorway. As it shut behind him, the sound of his footsteps instantly
died away. The walls must have been as thick as a prison’s.</p>

<p>I suppose I was what people in books call "stunned". The illumination
during the past few minutes had been so dazzling that my brain
could not master it. I remember very clearly that I did not think
about the ghastly failure of our scheme, or the German plans which
had been insolently unfolded to me as to one dead to the world.
I saw a single picture—an inn in a snowy valley (I saw it as a
small place like Peter’s cottage), a solitary girl, that smiling
devil who had left me, and then the unknown terror of the Underground
Railway. I think my courage went for a bit, and I cried with feebleness
and rage. The hammer in my forehead had stopped for it only beat
when I was angry in action. Now that I lay trapped, the manhood
had slipped out of my joints, and if Ivery had still been in the
doorway, I think I would have whined for mercy. I would have offered
him all the knowledge I had in the world if he had promised to
leave Mary alone.</p>

<p>Happily he wasn’t there, and there was no witness of my cowardice.
Happily, too, it is just as difficult to be a coward for long
as to be a hero. It was Blenkiron’s phrase about Mary that pulled
me together—"She can’t scare and she can’t soil". No, by heavens,
she couldn’t. I could trust my lady far better than I could trust
myself. I was still sick with anxiety, but I was getting a pull
on myself. I was done in, but Ivery would get no triumph out of
me. Either I would go under the ice, or I would find a chance
of putting a bullet through my head before I crossed the frontier.
If I could do nothing else I could perish decently.... And then
I laughed, and I knew I was past the worst. What made me laugh
was the thought of Peter. I had been pitying him an hour ago for
having only one leg, but now he was abroad in the living, breathing
world with years before him, and I lay in the depths, limbless
and lifeless, with my number up.</p>

<p>I began to muse on the cold water under the ice where I could
go if I wanted. I did not think that I would take that road, for
a man’s chances are not gone till he is stone dead, but I was
glad the way existed.... And then I looked at the wall in front
of me, and, very far up, I saw a small square window.</p>

<p>The stars had been clouded when I entered that accursed house,
but the mist must have cleared. I saw my old friend Orion, the
hunter’s star, looking through the bars. And that suddenly made
me think.</p>

<p>Peter and I had watched them by night, and I knew the place of
all the chief constellations in relation to the St Anton valley.
I believed that I was in a room on the lake side of the Pink Chalet:
I must be, if Ivery had spoken the truth. But if so, I could not
conceivably see Orion from its window.... There was no other possible
conclusion, I must be in a room on the east side of the house,
and Ivery had been lying. He had already lied in his boasting
of how he had outwitted me in England and at the Front. He might
be lying about Mary.... No, I dismissed that hope. Those words
of his had rung true enough.</p>

<p>I thought for a minute and concluded that he had lied to terrorise
me and keep me quiet; therefore this infernal contraption had
probably its weak point. I reflected, too, that I was pretty strong,
far stronger probably than Ivery imagined, for he had never seen
me stripped. Since the place was pitch dark I could not guess
how the thing worked, but I could feel the cross-bars rigid on
my chest and legs and the side-bars which pinned my arms to my
sides.... I drew a long breath and tried to force my elbows apart.
Nothing moved, nor could I raise the bars on my legs the smallest
fraction.</p>

<p>Again I tried, and again. The side-bar on my right seemed to
be less rigid than the others. I managed to get my right hand
raised above the level of my thigh, and then with a struggle I
got a grip with it on the cross-bar, which gave me a small leverage.
With a mighty effort I drove my right elbow and shoulder against
the side-bar. It seemed to give slightly.... I summoned all my
strength and tried again. There was a crack and then a splintering,
the massive bar shuffled limply back, and my right arm was free
to move laterally, though the cross-bar prevented me from raising
it.</p>

<p>With some difficulty I got at my coat pocket where reposed my
electric torch and my pistol. With immense labour and no little
pain I pulled the former out and switched it on by drawing the
catch against the cross-bar. Then I saw my prison house.</p>

<p>It was a little square chamber, very high, with on my left the
massive door by which Ivery had departed. The dark baulks of my
rack were plain, and I could roughly make out how the thing had
been managed. Some spring had tilted up the flooring, and dropped
the framework from its place in the right-hand wall. It was clamped,
I observed, by an arrangement in the floor just in front of the
door. If I could get rid of that catch it would be easy to free
myself, for to a man of my strength the weight would not be impossibly
heavy.</p>

<p>My fortitude had come back to me, and I was living only in the
moment, choking down any hope of escape. My first job was to destroy
the catch that clamped down the rack, and for that my only weapon
was my pistol. I managed to get the little electric torch jammed
in the corner of the cross-bar, where it lit up the floor towards
the door. Then it was hell’s own business extricating the pistol
from my pocket. Wrist and fingers were always cramping, and I
was in terror that I might drop it where I could not retrieve
it.</p>

<p>I forced myself to think out calmly the question of the clamp,
for a pistol bullet is a small thing, and I could not afford to
miss. I reasoned it out from my knowledge of mechanics, and came
to the conclusion that the centre of gravity was a certain bright
spot of metal which I could just see under the cross-bars. It
was bright and so must have been recently repaired, and that was
another reason for thinking it important. The question was how
to hit it, for I could not get the pistol in line with my eye.
Let anyone try that kind of shooting, with a bent arm over a bar,
when you are lying flat and looking at the mark from under the
bar, and he will understand its difficulties. I had six shots
in my revolver, and I must fire two or three ranging shots in
any case. I must not exhaust all my cartridges, for I must have
a bullet left for any servant who came to pry, and I wanted one
in reserve for myself. But I did not think shots would be heard
outside the room; the walls were too thick.</p>

<p>I held my wrist rigid above the cross-bar and fired. The bullet
was an inch to the right of the piece of bright steel. Moving
a fraction I fired again. I had grazed it on the left. With aching
eyes glued on the mark, I tried a third time. I saw something
leap apart, and suddenly the whole framework under which I lay
fell loose and mobile.... I was very cool and restored the pistol
to my pocket and took the torch in my hand before I moved....
Fortune had been kind, for I was free. I turned on my face, humped
my back, and without much trouble crawled out from under the contraption.</p>

<p>I did not allow myself to think of ultimate escape, for that
would only flurry me, and one step at a time was enough. I remember
that I dusted my clothes, and found that the cut in the back of
my head had stopped bleeding. I retrieved my hat, which had rolled
into a corner when I fell.... Then I turned my attention to the
next step.</p>

<p>The tunnel was impossible, and the only way was the door. If
I had stopped to think I would have known that the chances against
getting out of such a house were a thousand to one. The pistol
shots had been muffled by the cavernous walls, but the place,
as I knew, was full of servants and, even if I passed the immediate
door, I would be collared in some passage. But I had myself so
well in hand that I tackled the door as if I had been prospecting
to sink a new shaft in Rhodesia.</p>

<p>It had no handle nor, so far as I could see, a keyhole.... But
I noticed, as I turned my torch on the ground, that from the clamp
which I had shattered a brass rod sunk in the floor led to one
of the door-posts. Obviously the thing worked by a spring and
was connected with the mechanism of the rack.</p>

<p>A wild thought entered my mind and brought me to my feet. I pushed
the door and it swung slowly open. The bullet which freed me had
released the spring which controlled it.</p>

<p>Then for the first time, against all my maxims of discretion,
I began to hope. I took off my hat and felt my forehead burning,
so that I rested it for a moment on the cool wall.... Perhaps
my luck still held. With a rush came thoughts of Mary and Blenkiron
and Peter and everything we had laboured for, and I was mad to
win.</p>

<p>I had no notion of the interior of the house or where lay the
main door to the outer world. My torch showed me a long passage
with something like a door at the far end, but I clicked it off,
for I did not dare to use it now. The place was deadly quiet.
As I listened I seemed to hear a door open far away, and then
silence fell again.</p>

<p>I groped my way down the passage till I had my hands on the far
door. I hoped it might open on the hall, where I could escape
by a window or a balcony, for I judged the outer door would be
locked. I listened, and there came no sound from within. It was
no use lingering, so very stealthily I turned the handle and opened
it a crack.</p>

<p>It creaked and I waited with beating heart on discovery, for
inside I saw the glow of light. But there was no movement, so
it must be empty. I poked my head in and then followed with my
body.</p>

<p>It was a large room, with logs burning in a stove, and the floor
thick with rugs. It was lined with books, and on a table in the
centre a reading-lamp was burning. Several dispatch-boxes stood
on the table, and there was a little pile of papers. A man had
been here a minute before, for a half-smoked cigar was burning
on the edge of the inkstand.</p>

<p>At that moment I recovered complete use of my wits and all my
self-possession. More, there returned to me some of the old devil-may-careness
which before had served me well. Ivery had gone, but this was
his sanctum. Just as on the roofs of Erzerum I had burned to get
at Stumm’s papers, so now it was borne in on me that at all costs
I must look at that pile.</p>

<p>I advanced to the table and picked up the topmost paper. It was
a little typewritten blue slip with the lettering in italics,
and in a corner a curious, involved stamp in red ink. On it I
read:</p>

<p>"<em>Die Wildvögel müssen heimkehren.</em>"</p>

<p>At the same moment I heard steps and the door opened on the far
side, I stepped back towards the stove, and fingered the pistol
in my pocket.</p>

<p>A man entered, a man with a scholar’s stoop, an unkempt beard,
and large sleepy dark eyes. At the sight of me he pulled up and
his whole body grew taut. It was the Portuguese Jew, whose back
I had last seen at the smithy door in Skye, and who by the mercy
of God had never seen my face.</p>

<p>I stopped fingering my pistol, for I had an inspiration. Before
he could utter a word I got in first.</p>

<p>"<em>Die Vögelein schweigen im Walde,</em>" I said.</p>

<p>His face broke into a pleasant smile, and he replied:</p>

<p>"<em>Warte nur, balde ruhest du auch.</em>"</p>

<p>"Ach," he said in German, holding out his hand, "you have come
this way, when we thought you would go by Modane. I welcome you,
for I know your exploits. You are Conradi, who did so nobly in
Italy?"</p>

<p>I bowed. "Yes, I am Conradi," I said.</p>
