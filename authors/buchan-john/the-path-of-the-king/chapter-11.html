<p>He was hoisted on his horse by an ostler and two local sots from
the tap-room, his valise was strapped none too securely before
him, and with a farewell, which was meant to be gracious but was
only foolish, he tittuped into the rain. He was as drunk as an
owl, though he did not know it. All afternoon he had been mixing
strong Cumberland ale with the brandy he had got from the Solway
free-traders, and by five o'clock had reached that state when
he saw the world all gilt and rosy and himself as an applauded
actor on a splendid stage. He had talked grandly to his fellow
topers, and opened to their rustic wits a glimpse of the great
world. They had bowed to a master, even those slow Cumbrians who
admired little but fat cattle and blood horses. He had made a
sensation, had seen wonder and respect in dull eyes, and tasted
for a moment that esteem which he had singularly failed to find
elsewhere.</p>

<p>But he had been prudent. The Mr. Gilbert Craster who had been
travelling on secret business in Nithsdale and the Ayrshire moorlands
had not been revealed in the change-house of Newbigging. There
he had passed by the name, long since disused, of Gabriel Lovel,
which happened to be his true one. It was a needful precaution,
for the times were crooked. Even in a Border hamlet the name of
Craster might be known and since for the present it had a Whig
complexion it was well to go warily in a place where feeling ran
high and at an hour when the Jacobites were on the march. But
that other name of Lovel was buried deep in the forgotten scandal
of London by-streets.</p>

<p>The gentleman late re-christened Lovel had for the moment no
grudge against life. He was in the pay of a great man, no less
than the lord Duke of Marlborough, and he considered that he was
earning his wages. A soldier of fortune, he accepted the hire
of the best paymaster; only he sold not a sword, but wits. A pedant
might have called it honour, but Mr. Lovel was no pedant. He had
served a dozen chiefs on different sides. For Blingbroke he had
scoured France and twice imperilled his life in Highland bogs.
For Somers he had travelled to Spain, and for Wharton had passed
unquiet months on the Welsh marches. After his fashion he was
an honest servant and reported the truth so far as his ingenuity
could discern it. But, once quit of a great man's service, he
sold his knowledge readily to an opponent, and had been like to
be out of employment, since unless his masters gave him an engagement
for life he was certain some day to carry the goods they had paid
for to their rivals. But Marlborough had seen his uses, for the
great Duke sat loose to parties and earnestly desired to know
the facts. So for Marlborough he went into the conclaves of both
Whig and Jacobite, making his complexion suit his company.</p>

<p>He was new come from the Scottish south-west, for the Duke was
eager to know if the malcontent moorland Whigs were about to fling
their blue bonnets for King James. A mission of such discomfort
Mr. Lovel had never known, not even when he was a go-between for
Ormonde in the Irish bogs. He had posed as an emissary from the
Dutch brethren, son of an exiled Brownist, and for the first time
in his life had found his regicide great-grandfather useful. The
jargon of the godly fell smoothly from his tongue, and with its
aid and that of certain secret letters he had found his way to
the heart of the sectaries. He had sat through weary sermons in
Cameronian sheilings, and been present at the childish parades
of the Hebronite remnant. There was nothing to be feared in that
quarter, for to them all in authority were idolaters and George
no worse than James. In those moorland sojournings, too, he had
got light on other matters, for he had the numbers of Kenmure's
levies in his head, had visited my lord Stair at his grim Galloway
castle, and had had a long midnight colloquy with Roxburghe on
Tweedside. He had a pretty tale for his master, once he could
get to him. But with Northumberland up and the Highlanders at
Jedburgh and Kenmure coming from the west, it had been a ticklish
business to cross the Border. Yet by cunning and a good horse
it had been accomplished, and he found himself in Cumberland with
the road open southward to the safe Lowther country. Wherefore
Mr. Lovel had relaxed, and taken his ease in an inn.</p>

<p>He would not have admitted that he was drunk, but he presently
confessed that he was not clear about his road. He had meant to
lie at Brampton, and had been advised at the tavern of a short
cut, a moorland bridle-path. Who had told him of it? The landlord,
he thought, or the merry fellow in brown who had stood brandy
to the company? Anyhow, it was to save him five miles, and that
was something in this accursed weather. The path was clear&mdash;he
could see it squelching below him, pale in the last wet daylight&mdash;but
where the devil did it lead? Into the heart of a moss, it seemed,
and yet Brampton lay out of the moors in the tilled valley.</p>

<p>At first the fumes in his head raised him above the uncertainty
of his road and the eternal downpour. His mind was far away in
a select world of his own imagining. He saw himself in a privy
chamber, to which he had been conducted by reverent lackeys, the
door closed, the lamp lit, and the Duke's masterful eyes bright
with expectation. He saw the fine thin lips, like a woman's, primmed
in satisfaction. He heard words of compliment&mdash;"none so swift
and certain as you"&mdash;"in truth, a master-hand"&mdash;"I know not where
to look for your like." Delicious speeches seemed to soothe his
ear. And gold, too, bags of it, the tale of which would never
appear in any accompt-book. Nay, his fancy soared higher. He saw
himself presented to Ministers as one of the country's saviours,
and kissing the hand of Majesty. What Majesty and what Ministers
he knew not, and did not greatly care&mdash;that was not his business.
The rotundity of the Hanoverian and the lean darkness of the Stuart
were one to him. Both could reward an adroit servant.... His vanity,
terribly starved and cribbed in his normal existence, now blossomed
like a flower. His muddled head was fairly ravished with delectable
pictures. He seemed to be set at a great height above mundane
troubles, and to look down on men like a benignant God. His soul
glowed with a happy warmth.</p>

<p>But somewhere he was devilish cold. His wretched body was beginning
to cry out with discomfort. A loop of his hat was broken and the
loose flap was a conduit for the rain down his back. His old ridingcoat
was like a dish-clout, and he felt icy about the middle. Separate
streams of water entered the tops of his ridingboots&mdash;they were
a borrowed pair and too big for him&mdash;and his feet were in puddles.
It was only by degrees that he realised this misery. Then in the
boggy track his horse began to stumble. The fourth or fifth peck
woke irritation, and he jerked savagely at the bridle, and struck
the beast's dripping flanks with his whip. The result was a jib
and a flounder, and the shock squeezed out the water from his
garments as from a sponge. Mr. Lovel descended from the heights
of fancy to prosaic fact, and cursed.</p>

<p>The dregs of strong drink were still in him, and so soon as exhilaration
ebbed they gave edge to his natural fears. He perceived that it
had grown very dark and lonely. The rain, falling sheer, seemed
to shut him into a queer wintry world. All around the land echoed
with the steady drum of it, and the rumour of swollen runnels.
A wild bird wailed out of the mist and startled Mr. Lovel like
a ghost. He heard the sound of men talking and drew rein; it was
only a larger burn foaming by the wayside. The sky was black above
him, yet a faint grey light seemed to linger, for water glimmered
and he passed what seemed to be the edge of a loch.... At another
time the London-bred citizen would have been only peevish, for
Heaven knew he had faced ill weather before in ill places. But
the fiery stuff he had swallowed had woke a feverish fancy. Exaltation
suddenly changed to foreboding.</p>

<p>He halted and listened. Nothing but the noise of the weather,
and the night dark around him like a shell. For a moment he fancied
he caught the sound of horses, but it was not repeated. Where
did this accursed track mean to lead him? Long ago he should have
been in the valley and nearing Brampton. He was as wet as if he
had wallowed in a pool, cold, and very weary. A sudden disgust
at his condition drove away his fears and he swore lustily at
fortune. He longed for the warmth and the smells of his favourite
haunts &mdash;Gilpin's with oysters frizzling in a dozen pans,
and noble odours stealing from the tap-room, the Green Man with
its tripe-suppers, Wanless's Coffee House, noted for its cuts
of beef and its white puddings. He would give much to be in a
chair by one of those hearths and in the thick of that blowsy
fragrance. Now his nostrils were filled with rain and bog water
and a sodden world. It smelt sour, like stale beer in a mouldy
cellar. And cold! He crushed down his hat on his head and precipitated
a new deluge.</p>

<p>A bird skirled again in his ear, and his fright returned. He
felt small and alone in a vast inhospitable universe. And mingled
with it all was self-pity, for drink had made him maudlin. He
wanted so little&mdash;only a modest comfort, a little ease. He had
forgotten that half an hour before he had been figuring in princes'
cabinets. He would give up this business and be quit of danger
and the high road. The Duke must give him a reasonable reward,
and with it he and his child might dwell happily in some country
place. He remembered a cottage at Guildford all hung with roses....
But the Duke was reputed a miserly patron, and at the thought
Mr. Lovel's eyes overflowed. There was that damned bird again,
wailing like a lost soul. The eeriness of it struck a chill to
his heart, so that if he had been able to think of any refuge
he would have set spurs to his horse and galloped for it in blind
terror. He was in the mood in which men compose poetry, for he
felt himself a midget in the grip of immensities. He knew no poetry,
save a few tavern songs; but in his youth he had had the Scriptures
drubbed into him. He remembered ill-omened texts&mdash;one especially
about wandering through dry places seeking rest. Would to Heaven
he were in a dry place now!...</p>

<p>The horse sprang aside and nearly threw him. It had blundered
against the stone pillar of a gateway. It was now clear even to
Mr. Lovel's confused wits that he was lost. This might be the
road to Tophet, but it was no road to Brampton. He felt with numbed
hands the face of the gateposts. Here was an entrance to some
dwelling, and it stood open. The path led through it, and if he
left the path he would without doubt perish in a bog-hole. In
his desolation he longed for a human face. He might find a good
fellow who would house him; at the worst he would get direction
about the road. So he passed the gateway and entered an avenue.</p>

<p>It ran between trees which took the force of the downpour, so
that it seemed a very sanctuary after the open moor. His spirits
lightened. The infernal birds had stopped crying, but again he
heard the thud of hooves. That was right, and proved the place
was tenanted. Presently he turned a corner and faced a light which
shone through the wet, rayed like a heraldic star.</p>

<p>The sight gave him confidence, for it brought him back to a familiar
world. He rode straight to it, crossing a patch of rough turf,
where a fallen log all but brought him down. As he neared it the
light grew till he saw its cause. He stood before the main door
of a house and it was wide open. A great lantern, hung from a
beam just inside, showed a doorway of some size and magnificence.
And below it stood a servant, an old man, who at the sight of
the stranger advanced to hold his stirrup.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my lord," said the man. "All is ready for you."</p>

<p>The last hour had partially sobered the traveller, but, having
now come safe to port, his drunkenness revived. He saw nothing
odd in the open door or the servant's greeting. As he scrambled
to the ground he was back in his first exhilaration. "My lord!"
Well, why not? This was an honest man who knew quality when he
met it.</p>

<p>Humming a tune and making a chain of little pools on the stone
flags of the hall, Mr. Lovel followed his guide, who bore his
shabby valise, another servant having led away the horse. The
hall was dim with flickering shadows cast by the lamp in the doorway,
and smelt raw and cold as if the house had been little dwelt in.
Beyond it was a stone passage where a second lamp burned and lit
up a forest of monstrous deer horns on the wall. The butler flung
open a door.</p>

<p>"I trust your lordship will approve the preparations," he said.
"Supper awaits you, and when you have done I will show you your
chamber. There are dry shoes by the hearth." He took from the
traveller his sopping overcoat and drew from his legs the pulpy
riding-boots. With a bow which might have graced a court he closed
the door, leaving Mr. Lovel alone to his entertainment.</p>

<p>It was a small square room panelled to the ceiling in dark oak,
and lit by a curious magnificence of candles. They burned in sconces
on the walls and in tall candlesticks on the table, while a log
fire on the great stone hearth so added to the glow that the place
was as bright as day. The windows were heavily shuttered and curtained,
and in the far corner was a second door. On the polished table
food had been laid&mdash;a noble ham, two virgin pies, a dish of fruits,
and a group of shining decanters. To one coming out of the wild
night it was a transformation like a dream, but Mr. Lovel, half
drunk, accepted it as no more than his due. His feather brain
had been fired by the butler's "my lord," and he did not puzzle
his head with questions. From a slim bottle he filled himself
a glass of brandy, but on second thoughts set it down untasted.
He would sample the wine first and top off with the spirit. Meantime
he would get warm.</p>

<p>He stripped off his coat, which was dampish, and revealed a dirty
shirt and the dilapidated tops of his small clothes. His stockings
were torn and soaking, so he took them off, and stuck his naked
feet into the furred slippers which stood waiting by the hearth.
Then he sat himself in a great brocaded arm-chair and luxuriously
stretched his legs to the blaze.</p>

<p>But his head was too much afire to sit still. The comfort soaked
into his being through every nerve and excited rather than soothed
him. He did not want to sleep now, though little before he had
been crushed by weariness.... There was a mirror beside the fireplace,
the glass painted at the edge with slender flowers and cupids
in the Caroline fashion. He saw his reflection and it pleased
him. The long face with the pointed chin, the deep-set dark eyes,
the skin brown with weather&mdash;he seemed to detect a resemblance
to Wharton. Or was it Beaufort? Anyhow, now that the shabby coat
was off, he might well be a great man in undress. "My lord!" Why
not? His father had always told him he came of an old high family.
Kings, he had said&mdash;of France, or somewhere... A gold ring he
wore on his left hand slipped from his finger and jingled on the
hearthstone. It was too big for him, and when his fingers grew
small with cold or wet it was apt to fall off. He picked it up
and laid it beside the decanters on the table. That had been his
father's ring, and he congratulated himself that in all his necessities
he had never parted from it. It was said to have come down from
ancient kings.</p>

<p>He turned to the table and cut himself a slice of ham. But he
found he had no appetite. He filled himself a bumper of claret.
It was a ripe velvety liquor and cooled his hot mouth. That was
the drink for gentlemen. Brandy in good time, but for the present
this soft wine which was in keeping with the warmth and light
and sheen of silver.... His excitement was dying now into complacence.
He felt himself in the environment for which Providence had fitted
him. His whole being expanded in the glow of it. He understood
how able he was, how truly virtuous&mdash;a master of intrigue, but
one whose eye was always fixed on the star of honour. And then
his thoughts wandered to his son in the mean London lodgings.
The boy should have his chance and walk some day in silks and
laces. Curse his aliases! He should be Lovel, and carry his head
as high as any Villiers or Talbot.</p>

<p>The reflection sent his hand to an inner pocket of the coat now
drying by the hearth. He took from it a thin packet of papers
wrapped in oil-cloth. These were the fruits of his journey, together
with certain news too secret to commit to writing which he carried
in his head. He ran his eye over them, approved them, and laid
them before him on the table. They started a train of thought
which brought him to the question of his present quarters....
A shadow of doubt flickered over his mind. Whose house was this
and why this entertainment? He had been expected, or someone like
him. An old campaigner took what gifts the gods sent, but there
might be questions to follow. There was a coat of arms on the
plate, but so dim that he could not read it. The one picture in
the room showed an old man in a conventional suit of armour. He
did not recognise the face or remember any like it.... He filled
himself another bumper of claret, and followed it with a little
brandy. This latter was noble stuff, by which he would abide.
His sense of ease and security returned. He pushed the papers
farther over, sweeping the ring with them, and set his elbows
on the table, a gentleman warm, dry, and content, but much befogged
in the brain.</p>

<p>He raised his eyes to see the far door open and three men enter.
The sight brought him to his feet with a start, and his chair
clattered on the oak boards. He made an attempt at a bow, backing
steadily towards the fireplace and his old coat.</p>

<p>The faces of the new-comers exhibited the most lively surprise.
All three were young, and bore marks of travel, for though they
had doffed their riding coats, they were splashed to the knees
with mud and their unpowdered hair lay damp on their shoulders.
One was a very dark man who might have been a Spaniard but for
his blue eyes. The second was a mere boy with a ruddy face and
eyes full of dancing merriment. The third was tall and red-haired,
tanned of countenance and lean as a greyhound. He wore trews of
a tartan which Mr. Lovel, trained in such matters, recognised
as that of the house of Atholl.</p>

<p>Of the three he only recognised the leader, and the recognition
sobered him. This was that Talbot, commonly known from his swarthiness
as the Crow, who was Ormonde's most trusted lieutenant. He had
once worked with him; he knew his fierce temper, his intractable
honesty. His bemused wits turned desperately to concocting a conciliatory
tale.</p>

<p>But he seemed to be unrecognised. The three stared at him in
wild-eyed amazement.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you, sir?" the Highlander stammered.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel this time brought off his bow. "A stormstayed traveller,"
he said, his eyes fawning, "who has stumbled on this princely
hospitality. My name at your honour's service is Gabriel Lovel."</p>

<p>There was a second of dead silence and then the boy laughed.
It was merry laughter and broke in strangely on the tense air
of the room.</p>

<p>"Lovel," he cried, and there was an Irish burr in his speech.
"Lovel! And that fool Jobson mistook it for Lovat! I mistrusted
the tale, for Simon is too discreet even in his cups to confess
his name in a changehouse. It seems we have been stalking the
cailzie-cock and found a common thrush."</p>

<p>The dark man Talbot did not smile. "We had good reason to look
for Lovat. Widrington had word from London that he was on his
way to the north by the west marches. Had we found him we had
found a prize, for he will play hell with Mar if he crosses the
Highland line. What say you, Lord Charles?"</p>

<p>The Highlander nodded. "I would give my sporran filled ten times
with gold to have my hand on Simon. What devil's luck to be marching
south with that old fox in our rear!"</p>

<p>The boy pulled up a chair to the table. "Since we have missed
the big game, let us follow the less. I'm for supper, if this
gentleman will permit us to share a feast destined for another.
Sit down, sir, and fill your glass. You are not to be blamed for
not being a certain Scots lord. Lovel, I dare say, is an honester
name than Lovat!"</p>

<p>But Talbot was regarding the traveller with hard eyes. "You called
him a thrush, Nick, but I have a notion he is more of a knavish
jackdaw. I have seen this gentleman before. You were with Ormonde?"</p>

<p>"I had once the honour to serve his Grace," said Lovel, still
feverishly trying to devise a watertight tale.</p>

<p>"Ah, I remember now. You thought his star descending and carried
your wares to the other side. And who is your new employer, Mr.
Lovel? His present Majesty?"</p>

<p>His glance caught the papers on the table and he swept them towards
him.</p>

<p>"What have we here?" and his quick eye scanned the too legible
handwriting. Much was in cipher and contractions, but some names
stood out damningly. In that month of October in that year 1715
"Ke" could only stand for "Kenmure" and "Ni" for "Nithsdale."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel made an attempt at dignity.</p>

<p>"These are my papers, sir," he blustered. "I know not by what
authority you examine them." But his protest failed because of
the instability of his legs, on which his potations early and
recent had suddenly a fatal effect. He was compelled to collapse
heavily in the arm-chair by the hearth.</p>

<p>"I observe that the gentleman has lately been powdering his hair,"
said the boy whom they called Nick.</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel was wroth. He started upon the usual drunkard's protestations,
but was harshly cut short by Talbot.</p>

<p>"You ask me my warrant 'Tis the commission of his Majesty King
James in whose army I have the honour to hold a command."</p>

<p>He read on, nodding now and then, pursing his mouth at a word,
once copying something on to his own tablets. Suddenly he raised
his head.</p>

<p>"When did his Grace dismiss you?" he asked.</p>

<p>Now Ormonde had been the Duke last spoken of, but Mr. Lovel's
precarious wits fell into the trap. He denied indignantly that
he had fallen from his master's favour.</p>

<p>A grim smile played round Talbot's mouth.</p>

<p>"You have confessed," he said. Then to the others: "This fellow
is one of Malbrouck's pack. He has been nosing in the Scotch westlands.
Here are the numbers of Kenmure and Nithsdale to enable the great
Duke to make up his halting mind. See, he has been with Roxburghe
too.... We have a spy before us, gentlemen, delivered to our hands
by a happy incident. Whig among the sectaries and with Stair and
Roxburghe, and Jacobite among our poor honest folk, and wheedling
the secrets out of both sides to sell to one who disposes of them
at a profit in higher quarters. Faug! I know the vermin. An honest
Whig like John Argyll I can respect and fight, but for such rats
as this &mdash;What shall we do with it now that we have trapped
it?"</p>

<p>"Let it go," said the boy, Nick Wogan. "The land crawls with
them and we cannot go rat-hunting when we are aiming at a throne."
He picked up Lovel's ring and spun it on a finger tip. "The gentleman
has found more than news in the north. He has acquired a solid
lump of gold."</p>

<p>The implication roused Mr. Lovel out of his embarrassment. "I
wear the ring by right. I had it from my father." His voice was
tearful with offended pride</p>

<p>"The creature claims gentility," said Talbot, as he examined
the trinket. "Lovel you call yourself. But Lovel bears barry nebuly
or chevronels. This coat has three plain charges. Can you read
them, Nick, for my eyes are weak! I am curious to know from whom
he stole it."</p>

<p>The boy scanned it closely. "Three of something I think they
are fleur-de-lys, which would spell Montgomery. Or lions' heads,
maybe, for Buchan?"</p>

<p>He passed it to Lord Charles, who held it to a candle's light.
"Nay, I think they are Cummin garbs. Some poor fellow dirked and
spoiled."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel was outraged and forgot his fears. He forgot, indeed,
most things which he should have remembered. He longed only to
establish his gentility in the eyes of those three proud gentlemen.
The liquor was ebbing in him and with it had flown all his complacence.
He felt small and mean and despised, and the talents he had been
pluming himself on an hour before had now shrunk to windlestraws.</p>

<p>"I do assure you, sirs," he faltered, "the ring is mine own.
I had it from my father, who had it from his. I am of an ancient
house, though somewhat decayed."</p>

<p>His eyes sought those of his inquisitors with the pathos of a
dog. But he saw only hostile faces &mdash;Talbot's grave and grim,
Lord Charles' contemptuous, the boy's smiling ironically.</p>

<p>"Decayed, indeed," said the dark man, "pitifully decayed. If
you be gentle the more shame on you."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel was almost whining. "I swear I am honest. I do my master's
commissions and report what I learn."</p>

<p>"Aye, sir, but how do you learn it? By playing the imposter and
winning your way into an unsuspecting confidence. To you friendship
is a tool and honour a convenience. You cheat in every breath
you draw. And what a man gives you in his innocence may bring
him to the gallows. By God! I'd rather slit throats on a highway
for a purse or two than cozen men to their death by such arts
as yours."</p>

<p>In other circumstances Mr. Lovel might have put up a brazen defence,
but now he seemed to have lost assurance. "I do no ill," was all
he could stammer, "for I have no bias. I am for no side in politics."</p>

<p>"So much the worse. A man who spies for a cause in which he believes
may redeem by that faith a dirty trade. But in cold blood you
practise infamy."</p>

<p>The night was growing wilder, and even in that sheltered room
its echoes were felt. Wind shook the curtains and blew gusts of
ashes from the fire. The place had become bleak and tragic and
Mr. Lovel felt the forlornness in his bones. Something had woke
in him which shivered the fabric of a lifetime. The three faces,
worn, anxious, yet of a noble hardihood, stirred in him a strange
emotion. Hopes and dreams, long forgotten, flitted like spectres
across his memory. He had something to say, something which demanded
utterance, and his voice grew bold.</p>

<p>"What do you know of my straits?" he cried. "Men of fortune like
you! My race is old, but I never had the benefit of it. I was
bred in a garret and have all my days been on nodding terms with
starvation.... What should I know about your parties? What should
I care for Whig and Tory or what king has his hinderend on the
throne? Tell me in God's name how should such as I learn loyalty
except to the man who gives me gold to buy food and shelter? Heaven
knows I have never betrayed a master while I served him."</p>

<p>The shabby man with the lean face had secured an advantage. For
a moment the passion in his voice dominated the room.</p>

<p>"Cursed if this does not sound like truth," said the boy, and
his eyes were almost friendly.</p>

<p>But Talbot did not relax.</p>

<p>"By your own confession you are outside the pale of gentility.
I do not trouble to blame you, but I take leave to despise you.
By your grace, sir, we will dispense with your company."</p>

<p>The ice of his scorn did not chill the strange emotion which
seemed to have entered the air. The scarecrow by the fire had
won a kind of dignity.</p>

<p>"I am going," he said. "Will you have the goodness to send for
my horse?... If you care to know, gentleman, you have cut short
a promising career.... To much of what you say I submit. You have
spoken truth&mdash;not all the truth, but sufficient to unman me. I
am a rogue by your reckoning, for I think only of my wages. Pray
tell me what moves you to ride out on what at the best is a desperate
venture?"</p>

<p>There was nothing but sincerity in the voice, and Talbot answered.</p>

<p>"I fight for the King ordained by God and for a land which cannot
flourish under the usurper. My loyalty to throne, Church, and
fatherland constrains me."</p>

<p>Lovel's eye passed to Lord Charles. The Highlander whistled very
softly a bar or two of a wild melody with longing and a poignant
sorrow in it.</p>

<p>"That," he said. "I fight for the old ways and the old days that
are passing."</p>

<p>Nick Wogan smiled. "And I for neither&mdash;wholly. I have a little
of Talbot in me and more of Charles. But I strike my blow for
romance&mdash;the little against the big, the noble few against the
base many. I am for youth against all dull huckstering things."</p>

<p>Mr. Lovel bowed. "I am answered. I congratulate you, gentlemen,
on your good fortune. It is my grief that I do not share it. I
have not Mr. Talbot's politics, nor am I a great Scotch lord,
nor have I the felicity to be young.... I would beg you not to
judge me harshly."</p>

<p>By this time he had struggled into his coat and boots He stepped
to the table and picked up the papers.</p>

<p>"By your leave," he said, and flung them into the fire.</p>

<p>"You were welcome to them," said Talbot. "Long ere they got to
Marlborough they would be useless."</p>

<p>"That is scarcely the point," said Lovel "I am somewhat dissatisfied
