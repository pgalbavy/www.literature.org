"That wull be the doctor's launch," said Captain MacElrath.
<P>
The pilot grunted, while the skipper swept on with his glass from
the launch to the strip of beach and to Kingston beyond, and then
slowly across the entrance to Howth Head on the northern side.
<P>
"The tide's right, and we'll have you docked in two hours," the
pilot vouchsafed, with an effort at cheeriness.  "Ring's End Basin,
is it?"
<P>
This time the skipper grunted.
<P>
"A dirty Dublin day."
<P>
Again the skipper grunted.  He was weary with the night of wind in
the Irish Channel behind him, the unbroken hours of which he had
spent on the bridge.  And he was weary with all the voyage behind
him - two years and four months between home port and home port,
eight hundred and fifty days by his log.
<P>
"Proper wunter weather," he answered, after a silence.  "The town
is undistinct.  Ut wull be rainun' guid an' hearty for the day."
<P>
Captain MacElrath was a small man, just comfortably able to peep
over the canvas dodger of the bridge.  The pilot and third officer
loomed above him, as did the man at the wheel, a bulky German,
deserted from a warship, whom he had signed on in Rangoon.  But his
lack of inches made Captain MacElrath a no less able man.  At least
so the Company reckoned, and so would he have reckoned could he
have had access to the carefully and minutely compiled record of
him filed away in the office archives.  But the Company had never
given him a hint of its faith in him.  It was not the way of the
Company, for the Company went on the principle of never allowing an
employee to think himself indispensable or even exceedingly useful;
wherefore, while quick to censure, it never praised.  What was
Captain MacElrath, anyway, save a skipper, one skipper of the
eighty-odd skippers that commanded the Company's eighty-odd
freighters on all the highways and byways of the sea?
<P>
Beneath them, on the main deck, two Chinese stokers were carrying
breakfast for'ard across the rusty iron plates that told their own
grim story of weight and wash of sea.  A sailor was taking down the
life-line that stretched from the forecastle, past the hatches and
cargo-winches, to the bridge-deck ladder.
<P>
"A rough voyage," suggested the pilot.
<P>
"Aye, she was fair smokin' ot times, but not thot I minded thot so
much as the lossin' of time.  I hate like onythun' tull loss time."
<P>
So saying, Captain MacElrath turned and glanced aft, aloft and
alow, and the pilot, following his gaze, saw the mute but
convincing explanation of that loss of time.  The smoke-stack,
buff-coloured underneath, was white with salt, while the whistle-
pipe glittered crystalline in the random sunlight that broke for
the instant through a cloud-rift.  The port lifeboat was missing,
its iron davits, twisted and wrenched, testifying to the mightiness
of the blow that had been struck the old Tryapsic.  The starboard
davits were also empty.  The shattered wreck of the lifeboat they
had held lay on the fiddley beside the smashed engine-room
skylight, which was covered by a tarpaulin.  Below, to star-board,
on the bridge deck, the pilot saw the crushed mess-room door,
roughly bulkheaded against the pounding seas.  Abreast of it, on
the smokestack guys, and being taken down by the bos'n and a
sailor, hung the huge square of rope netting which had failed to
break those seas of their force.
<P>
"Twice afore I mentioned thot door tull the owners," said Captain
MacElrath.  "But they said ut would do.  There was bug seas thot
time.  They was uncreditable bug.  And thot buggest one dud the
domage.  Ut fair carried away the door an' laid ut flat on the mess
table an' smashed out the chief's room.  He was a but sore about
ut."
<P>
"It must 'a' been a big un," the pilot remarked sympathetically.
<P>
"Aye, ut was thot.  Thungs was lively for a but.  Ut finished the
mate.  He was on the brudge wuth me, an' I told hum tull take a
look tull the wedges o' number one hatch.  She was takin' watter
freely an' I was no sure o' number one.  I dudna like the look o'
ut, an' I was fuggerin' maybe tull heave to tull the marn, when she
took ut over abaft the brudge.  My word, she was a bug one.  We got
a but of ut ourselves on the brudge.  I dudna miss the mate ot the
first, what o' routin' out Chips an' bulkheadun' thot door an'
stretchun' the tarpaulin over the sky-light.  Then he was nowhere
to be found.  The men ot the wheel said as he seen hum goin' down
the lodder just afore she hut us.  We looked for'ard, we looked
tull hus room, aye looked tull the engine-room, an' we looked along
aft on the lower deck, and there he was, on both sides the cover to
the steam-pipe runnun' tull the after-wunches."
<P>
The pilot ejaculated an oath of amazement and horror.
<P>
"Aye," the skipper went on wearily, "an' on both sides the steam-
pipe uz well.  I tell ye he was in two pieces, splut clean uz a
herrin'.  The sea must a-caught hum on the upper brudge deck,
carried hum clean across the fiddley, an' banged hum head-on tull
the pipe cover.  It sheered through hum like so much butter, down
atween the eyes, an' along the middle of hum, so that one leg an'
arm was fast tull the one piece of hum, an' one leg an' arm fast
tull the other piece of hum.  I tull ye ut was fair grewsome.  We
putt hum together an' rolled hum in canvas uz we pulled hum out."
<P>
The pilot swore again.
<P>
"Oh, ut wasna onythun' tull greet about," Captain MacElrath assured
him.  "'Twas a guid ruddance.  He was no a sailor, thot mate-
fellow.  He was only fut for a pugsty, an' a dom puir apology for
thot same."
<P>
It is said that there are three kinds of Irish - Catholic,
Protestant, and North-of-Ireland - and that the North-of-Ireland
Irishman is a transplanted Scotchman.  Captain MacElrath was a
North-of-Ireland man, and, talking for much of the world like a
Scotchman, nothing aroused his ire quicker than being mistaken for
a Scotchman.  Irish he stoutly was, and Irish he stoutly abided,
though it was with a faint lip-lift of scorn that he mentioned mere
South-of-Ireland men, or even Orange-men.  Himself he was
Presbyterian, while in his own community five men were all that
ever mustered at a meeting in the Orange Men's Hall.  His community
was the Island McGill, where seven thousand of his kind lived in
such amity and sobriety that in the whole island there was but one
policeman and never a public-house at all.
<P>
Captain MacElrath did not like the sea, and had never liked it.  He
wrung his livelihood from it, and that was all the sea was, the
place where he worked, as the mill, the shop, and the counting-
house were the places where other men worked.  Romance never sang
to him her siren song, and Adventure had never shouted in his
sluggish blood.  He lacked imagination.  The wonders of the deep
were without significance to him.  Tornadoes, hurricanes,
waterspouts, and tidal waves were so many obstacles to the way of a
ship on the sea and of a master on the bridge - they were that to
him, and nothing more.  He had seen, and yet not seen, the many
marvels and wonders of far lands.  Under his eyelids burned the
brazen glories of the tropic seas, or ached the bitter gales of the
North Atlantic or far South Pacific; but his memory of them was of
mess-room doors stove in, of decks awash and hatches threatened, of
undue coal consumption, of long passages, and of fresh paint-work
spoiled by unexpected squalls of rain.
<P>
"I know my buzz'ness," was the way he often put it, and beyond his
business was all that he did not know, all that he had seen with
the mortal eyes of him and yet that he never dreamed existed.  That
he knew his business his owners were convinced, or at forty he
would not have held command of the Tryapsic, three thousand tons
net register, with a cargo capacity of nine thousand tons and
valued at fifty-thousand pounds.
<P>
He had taken up seafaring through no love of it, but because it had
been his destiny, because he had been the second son of his father
instead of the first.  Island McGill was only so large, and the
land could support but a certain definite proportion of those that
dwelt upon it.  The balance, and a large balance it was, was driven
to the sea to seek its bread.  It had been so for generations.  The
eldest sons took the farms from their fathers; to the other sons
remained the sea and its salt-ploughing.  So it was that Donald
MacElrath, farmer's son and farm-boy himself, had shifted from the
soil he loved to the sea he hated and which it was his destiny to
farm.  And farmed it he had, for twenty years, shrewd, cool-headed,
sober, industrious, and thrifty, rising from ship's boy and
forecastle hand to mate and master of sailing-ships and thence into
steam, second officer, first, and master, from small command to
larger, and at last to the bridge of the old Tryapsic - old, to be
sure, but worth her fifty thousand pounds and still able to bear up
in all seas, and weather her nine thousand tons of freight.
<P>
From the bridge of the Tryapsic, the high place he had gained in
the competition of men, he stared at Dublin harbour opening out, at
the town obscured by the dark sky of the dreary wind-driven day,
and at the tangled tracery of spars and rigging of the harbour
shipping.  Back from twice around the world he was, and from
interminable junketings up and down on far stretches, home-coming
to the wife he had not seen in eight-and-twenty months, and to the
child he had never seen and that was already walking and talking.
He saw the watch below of stokers and trimmers bobbing out of the
forecastle doors like rabbits from a warren and making their way
aft over the rusty deck to the mustering of the port doctor.  They
were Chinese, with expressionless, Sphinx-like faces, and they
walked in peculiar shambling fashion, dragging their feet as if the
clumsy brogans were too heavy for their lean shanks.
<P>
He saw them and he did not see them, as he passed his hand beneath
his visored cap and scratched reflectively his mop of sandy hair.
For the scene before him was but the background in his brain for
the vision of peace that was his - a vision that was his often
during long nights on the bridge when the old Tryapsic wallowed on
the vexed ocean floor, her decks awash, her rigging thrumming in
the gale gusts or snow squalls or driving tropic rain.  And the
vision he saw was of farm and farm-house and straw-thatched
outbuildings, of children playing in the sun, and the good wife at
the door, of lowing kine, and clucking fowls, and the stamp of
horses in the stable, of his father's farm next to him, with,
beyond, the woodless, rolling land and the hedged fields, neat and
orderly, extending to the crest of the smooth, soft hills.  It was
his vision and his dream, his Romance and Adventure, the goal of
all his effort, the high reward for the salt-ploughing and the
long, long furrows he ran up and down the whole world around in his
farming of the sea.
<P>
In simple taste and homely inclination this much-travelled map was
more simple and homely than the veriest yokel.  Seventy-one years
his father was, and had never slept a night out of his own bed in
his own house on Island McGill.  That was the life ideal, so
Captain MacElrath considered, and he was prone to marvel that any
man, not under compulsion, should leave a farm to go to sea.  To
this much-travelled man the whole world was as familiar as the
village to the cobbler sitting in his shop.  To Captain MacElrath
the world was a village.  In his mind's eye he saw its streets a
thousand leagues long, aye, and longer; turnings that doubled
earth's stormiest headlands or were the way to quiet inland ponds;
cross-roads, taken one way, that led to flower-lands and summer
seas, and that led the other way to bitter, ceaseless gales and the
perilous bergs of the great west wind drift.  And the cities,
bright with lights, were as shops on these long streets - shops
where business was transacted, where bunkers were replenished,
cargoes taken or shifted, and orders received from the owners in
London town to go elsewhere and beyond, ever along the long sea-
lanes, seeking new cargoes here, carrying new cargoes there,
running freights wherever shillings and pence beckoned and
underwriters did not forbid.  But it was all a weariness to
contemplate, and, save that he wrung from it his bread, it was
without profit under the sun.
<P>
The last good-bye to the wife had been at Cardiff, twenty-eight
months before, when he sailed for Valparaiso with coals - nine
thousand tons and down to his marks.  From Valparaiso he had gone
to Australia, light, a matter of six thousand miles on end with a
stormy passage and running short of bunker coal.  Coals again to
Oregon, seven thousand miles, and nigh as many more with general
cargo for Japan and China.  Thence to Java, loading sugar for
Marseilles, and back along the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, and
on to Baltimore, down to her marks with crome ore, buffeted by
hurricanes, short again of bunker coal and calling at Bermuda to
replenish.  Then a time charter, Norfolk, Virginia, loading
mysterious contraband coal and sailing for South Africa under
orders of the mysterious German supercargo put on board by the
charterers.  On to Madagascar, steaming four knots by the
supercargo's orders, and the suspicion forming that the Russian
fleet might want the coal.  Confusion and delays, long waits at
sea, international complications, the whole world excited over the
old Tryapsic and her cargo of contraband, and then on to Japan and
the naval port of Sassebo.  Back to Australia, another time charter
and general merchandise picked up at Sydney, Melbourne, and
Adelaide, and carried on to Mauritius, Lourenco Marques, Durban,
Algoa Bay, and Cape Town.  To Ceylon for orders, and from Ceylon to
Rangoon to load rice for Rio Janeiro.  Thence to Buenos Aires and
loading maize for the United Kingdom or the Continent, stopping at
St. Vincent, to receive orders to proceed to Dublin.  Two years and
four months, eight hundred and fifty days by the log, steaming up
and down the thousand-league-long sea-lanes and back again to
Dublin town.  And he was well aweary.
<P>
A little tug had laid hold of the Tryapsic, and with clang and
clatter and shouted command, with engines half-ahead, slow-speed,
or half-astern, the battered old sea-tramp was nudged and nosed and
shouldered through the dock-gates into Ring's End Basin.  Lines
were flung ashore, fore and aft, and a 'midship spring got out.
Already a small group of the happy shore-staying folk had clustered
on the dock.
<P>
"Ring off," Captain MacElrath commanded in his slow thick voice;
and the third officer worked the lever of the engine-room
telegraph.
<P>
"Gangway out!" called the second officer; and when this was
accomplished, "That will do."
<P>
It was the last task of all, gangway out.  "That will do" was the
dismissal.  The voyage was ended, and the crew shambled eagerly
forward across the rusty decks to where their sea-bags were packed
and ready for the shore.  The taste of the land was strong in the
men's mouths, and strong it was in the skipper's mouth as he
muttered a gruff good day to the departing pilot, and himself went
down to his cabin.  Up the gangway were trooping the customs
officers, the surveyor, the agent's clerk, and the stevedores.
Quick work disposed of these and cleared his cabin, the agent
waiting to take him to the office.
<P>
"Dud ye send word tull the wife?" had been his greeting to the
clerk.
<P>
"Yes, a telegram, as soon as you were reported."
<P>
"She'll likely be comin' down on the marnin' train," the skipper
had soliloquized, and gone inside to change his clothes and wash.
<P>
He took a last glance about the room and at two photographs on the
wall, one of the wife the other of an infant - the child he had
never seen.  He stepped out into the cabin, with its panelled walls
of cedar and maple, and with its long table that seated ten, and at
which he had eaten by himself through all the weary time.  No
laughter and clatter and wordy argument of the mess-room had been
his.  He had eaten silently, almost morosely, his silence emulated
by the noiseless Asiatic who had served him.  It came to him
suddenly, the overwhelming realization of the loneliness of those
two years and more.  All his vexations and anxieties had been his
own.  He had shared them with no one.  His two young officers were
too young and flighty, the mate too stupid.  There was no
consulting with them.  One tenant had shared the cabin with him,
that tenant his responsibility.  They had dined and supped
together, walked the bridge together, and together they had bedded.
<P>
"Och!" he muttered to that grim companion, "I'm quit of you, an'
wull quit . . . for a wee."
<P>
Ashore he passed the last of the seamen with their bags, and, at
the agent's, with the usual delays, put through his ship business.
When asked out by them to drink he took milk and soda.
<P>
"I am no teetotaler," he explained; "but for the life o' me I canna
bide beer or whusky."
<P>
In the early afternoon, when he finished paying off his crew, he
hurried to the private office where he had been told his wife was
waiting.
<P>
His eyes were for her first, though the temptation was great to
have more than a hurried glimpse of the child in the chair beside
her.  He held her off from him after the long embrace, and looked
into her face long and steadily, drinking in every feature of it
and wondering that he could mark no changes of time.  A warm man,
his wife thought him, though had the opinion of his officers been
asked it would have been:  a harsh man and a bitter one.
<P>
"Wull, Annie, how is ut wi' ye?" he queried, and drew her to him
again.
<P>
And again he held her away from him, this wife of ten years and of
whom he knew so little.  She was almost a stranger - more a
stranger than his Chinese steward, and certainly far more a
stranger than his own officers whom he had seen every day, day and
day, for eight hundred and fifty days.  Married ten years, and in
that time he had been with her nine weeks - scarcely a honeymoon.
Each time home had been a getting acquainted again with her.  It
was the fate of the men who went out to the salt-ploughing.  Little
they knew of their wives and less of their children.  There was his
chief engineer - old, near-sighted MacPherson - who told the story
of returning home to be locked out of his house by his four-year
kiddie that never had laid eyes on him before.
<P>
"An' thus 'ull be the loddie," the skipper said, reaching out a
hesitant hand to the child's cheek.
<P>
But the boy drew away from him, sheltering against the mother's
side.
<P>
"Och!" she cried, "and he doesna know his own father."
<P>
"Nor I hum.  Heaven knows I could no a-picked hum out of a crowd,
though he'll be havin' your nose I'm thunkun'."
<P>
"An' your own eyes, Donald.  Look ut them.  He's your own father,
laddie.  Kiss hum like the little mon ye are."
<P>
But the child drew closer to her, his expression of fear and
distrust growing stronger, and when the father attempted to take
him in his arms he threatened to cry.
<P>
The skipper straightened up, and to conceal the pang at his heart
he drew out his watch and looked at it.
<P>
"Ut's time to go, Annie," he said.  "Thot train 'ull be startun'."
<P>
He was silent on the train at first, divided between watching the
wife with the child going to sleep in her arms and looking out of
the window at the tilled fields and green unforested hills vague
and indistinct in the driving drizzle that had set in.  They had
the compartment to themselves.  When the boy slept she laid him out
on the seat and wrapped him warmly.  And when the health of
relatives and friends had been inquired after, and the gossip of
Island McGill narrated, along with the weather and the price of
land and crops, there was little left to talk about save
themselves, and Captain MacElrath took up the tale brought home for
the good wife from all his world's-end wandering.  But it was not a
tale of marvels he told, nor of beautiful flower-lands nor
mysterious Eastern cities.
<P>
"What like is Java?" she asked once.
<P>
"Full o' fever.  Half the crew down wuth ut an' luttle work.  Ut
was quinine an' quinine the whole blessed time.  Each marnun' 'twas
quinine an' gin for all hands on an empty stomach.  An' they who
was no sick made ut out to be hovun' ut bad uz the rest."
<P>
Another time she asked about Newcastle.
<P>
"Coals an' coal-dust - thot's all.  No a nice sutty.  I lost two
Chinks there, stokers the both of them.  An' the owners paid a fine
tull the Government of a hundred pounds each for them.  'We regret
tull note,' they wrut me - I got the letter tull Oregon - 'We
regret tull note the loss o' two Chinese members o' yer crew ot
Newcastle, an' we recommend greater carefulness un the future.'
Greater carefulness!  And I could no a-been more careful.  The
Chinks hod forty-five pounds each comun' tull them in wages, an' I
was no a-thunkun' they 'ud run.
<P>
"But thot's their way - 'we regret tull note,' 'we beg tull
advise,' 'we recommend,' 'we canna understand' - an' the like o'
thot.  Domned cargo tank!  An' they would thunk I could drive her
like a Lucania, an' wi'out burnun' coals.  There was thot
propeller.  I was after them a guid while for ut.  The old one was
iron, thuck on the edges, an' we couldna make our speed.  An' the
new one was bronze - nine hundred pounds ut cost, an' then wantun'
their returns out o' ut, an' me wuth a bod passage an' lossin' time
every day.  'We regret tull note your long passage from Voloparaiso
tull Sydney wuth an average daily run o' only one hundred an'
suxty-seven.  We hod expected better results wuth the new
propeller.  You should a-made an average daily run o' two hundred
and suxteen.'
<P>
"An' me on a wunter passage, blowin' a luvin' gale half the time,
wuth hurricane force in atweenwhiles, an' hove to sux days, wuth
engines stopped an' bunker coal runnun' short, an' me wuth a mate
thot stupid he could no pass a shup's light ot night wi'out callun'
me tull the brudge.  I wrut an' told 'em so.  An' then:  'Our
nautical adviser suggests you kept too far south,' an' 'We are
lookun' for better results from thot propeller.'  Nautical adviser!
- shore pilot!  Ut was the regular latitude for a wunter passage
from Voloparaiso tull Sydney.
<P>
"An' when I come un tull Auckland short o' coal, after lettun' her
druft sux days wuth the fires out tull save the coal, an' wuth only
twenty tons in my bunkers, I was thunkun' o' the lossin' o' time
an' the expense, an' tull save the owners I took her un an' out
wi'out pilotage.  Pilotage was no compulsory.  An' un Yokohama, who
should I meet but Captun Robinson o' the Dyapsic.  We got a-talkun'
about ports an' places down Australia-way, an' first thing he says:
'Speakun' o' Auckland - of course, Captun, you was never un
Auckland?'  'Yus,' I says, 'I was un there very recent.'  'Oh, ho,'
he says, very angry-like, 'so you was the smart Aleck thot fetched
me thot letter from the owners:  "We note item of fufteen pounds
for pilotage ot Auckland.  A shup o' ours was un tull Auckland
recently an' uncurred no such charge.  We beg tull advise you thot
we conseeder thus pilotage an onnecessary expense which should no
be uncurred un the future.'"
<P>
"But dud they say a word tull me for the fufteen pounds I saved
tull them?  No a word.  They send a letter tull Captun Robinson for
no savun' them the fufteen pounds, an' tull me:  'We note item of
two guineas doctor's fee at Auckland for crew.  Please explain thus
onusual expunditure.'  Ut was two o' the Chinks.  I was thunkun'
they hod beri-beri, an' thot was the why o' sendun' for the doctor.
I buried the two of them ot sea not a week after.  But ut was:
'Please explain thus onusual expunditure,' an' tull Captun
Robinson, 'We beg tull advise you thot we conseeder thus pilotage
an onnecessary expense.'
<P>
"Dudna I cable them from Newcastle, tellun' them the old tank was
thot foul she needed dry-dock?  Seven months out o' drydock, an'
the West Coast the quickest place for foulun' un the world.  But
freights was up, an' they hod a charter o' coals for Portland.  The
Arrata, one o' the Woor Line, left port the same day uz us, bound
for Portland, an' the old Tryapsic makun' sux knots, seven ot the
best.  An' ut was ot Comox, takun' un bunker coal, I got the letter
from the owners.  The boss humself hod signed ut, an' ot the bottom
he wrut un hus own bond:  'The Arrata beat you by four an' a half
days.  Am dusappointed.'  Dusappointed!  When I had cabled them
from Newcastle.  When she drydocked ot Portland, there was whuskers
on her a foot long, barnacles the size o' me fust, oysters like
young sauce plates.  Ut took them two days afterward tull clean the
dock o' shells an' muck.
<P>
"An' there was the motter o' them fire-bars ot Newcastle.  The firm
ashore made them heavier than the engineer's speecifications, an'
then forgot tull charge for the dufference.  Ot the last moment,
wuth me ashore gettun' me clearance, they come wuth the bill:
'Tull error on fire-bars, sux pounds.'  They'd been tull the shup
an' MacPherson hod O.K.'d ut.  I said ut was strange an' would no
pay.  'Then you are dootun' the chief engineer,' says they.  'I'm
no dootun',' says I, 'but I canna see my way tull sign.  Come wuth
me tull the shup.  The launch wull cost ye naught an' ut 'ull brung
ye back.  An' we wull see what MacPherson says.'
<P>
"But they would no come.  Ot Portland I got the bill un a letter.
I took no notice.  Ot Hong-Kong I got a letter from the owners.
The bill hod been sent tull them.  I wrut them from Java
explainun'.  At Marseilles the owners wrut me:  'Tull extra work un
engine-room, sux pounds.  The engineer has O.K.'d ut, an' you have
no O.K.'d ut.  Are you dootun' the engineer's honesty?'  I wrut an'
told them I was no dootun' his honesty; thot the bill was for extra
weight o' fire-bars; an' thot ut was O.K.  Dud they pay ut?  They
no dud.  They must unvestigate.  An' some clerk un the office took
sick, an' the bill was lost.  An' there was more letters.  I got
letters from the owners an' the firm -'Tull error on fire-bars, sux
pounds' - ot Baltimore, ot Delagoa Bay, ot Moji, ot Rangoon, ot
Rio, an' ot Montevuddio.  Ut uz no settled yut.  I tell ye, Annie,
the owners are hard tull please."
<P>
He communed with himself for a moment, and then muttered
indignantly:  "Tull error on fire-bars, sux pounds."
<P>
"Hov ye heard of Jamie?" his wife asked in the pause.
<P>
Captain MacElrath shook his head.
<P>
"He was washed off the poop wuth three seamen."
<P>
"Whereabouts?"
<P>
"Off the Horn.  'Twas on the Thornsby."
<P>
"They would be runnun' homeward bound?"
<P>
"Aye," she nodded.  "We only got the word three days gone.  His
wife is greetin' like tull die."
<P>
"A good lod, Jamie," he commented, "but a stiff one ot carryun' on.
I mind me when we was mates together un the Abion.  An' so Jamie's
gone."
<P>
Again a pause fell, to be broken by the wife.
<P>
"An' ye will no a-heard o' the Bankshire?  MacDougall lost her in
Magellan Straits.  'Twas only yesterday ut was in the paper."
<P>
"A cruel place, them Magellan Straits," he said.  "Dudna thot
domned mate-fellow nigh putt me ashore twice on the one passage
through?  He was a eediot, a lunatuc.  I wouldna have hum on the
brudge a munut.  Comun' tull Narrow Reach, thuck weather, wuth snow
squalls, me un the chart-room, dudna I guv hum the changed course?
'South-east-by-east,' I told hum.  'South-east-by-east, sir,' says
he.  Fufteen munuts after I comes on tull the brudge.  'Funny,'
says thot mate-fellow, 'I'm no rememberun' ony islands un the mouth
o' Narrow Reach.  I took one look ot the islands an' yells, 'Putt
your wheel hard a-starboard,' tull the mon ot the wheel.  An' ye
should a-seen the old Tryapsic turnun' the sharpest circle she ever
turned.  I waited for the snow tull clear, an' there was Narrow
Reach, nice uz ye please, tull the east'ard an' the islands un the
mouth o' False Bay tull the south'ard.  'What course was ye
steerun'?' I says tull the mon ot the wheel.  'South-by-east, sir,'
says he.  I looked tull the mate-fellow.  What could I say?  I was
thot wroth I could a-kult hum.  Four points dufference.  Five
munuts more an' the old Tryapsic would a-been funushed.
<P>
"An' was ut no the same when we cleared the Straits tull the
east'ard?  Four hours would a-seen us guid an' clear.  I was forty
hours then on the brudge.  I guv the mate his course, an' the
bearun' o' the Askthar Light astern.  'Don't let her bear more tull
the north'ard than west-by-north,' I said tull hum, 'an' ye wull be
all right.'  An' I went below an' turned un.  But I couldna sleep
for worryun'.  After forty hours on the brudge, what was four hours
more? I thought.  An' for them four hours wull ye be lettun' the
mate loss her on ye?  'No,' I says to myself.  An' wuth thot I got
up, hod a wash an' a cup o' coffee, an' went tull the brudge.  I
took one look ot the bearun' o' Askthar Light.  'Twas nor'west-by-
west, and the old Tryapsic down on the shoals.  He was a eediot,
thot mate-fellow.  Ye could look overside an' see the duscoloration
of the watter.  'Twas a close call for the old Tryapsic I'm tellun'
ye.  Twice un thirty hours he'd a-hod her ashore uf ut hod no been
for me."
<P>
Captain MacElrath fell to gazing at the sleeping child with mild
wonder in his small blue eyes, and his wife sought to divert him
from his woes.
<P>
"Ye remember Jummy MacCaul?" she asked.  "Ye went tull school wuth
hus two boys.  Old Jummy MacCaul thot hoz the farm beyond Doctor
Haythorn's place."
<P>
"Oh, aye, an' what o' hum?  Uz he dead?"
<P>
"No, but he was after askun' your father, when he sailed last time
for Voloparaiso, uf ye'd been there afore.  An' when your father
says no, then Jummy says, 'An' how wull he be knowun a' tull find
hus way?'  An' with thot your father says:  'Verry sumple ut uz,
Jummy.  Supposun' you was goin' tull the mainland tull a mon who
luved un Belfast.  Belfast uz a bug sutty, Jummy, an' how would ye
be findun' your way?'  'By way o' me tongue,' says Jummy; 'I'd be
askun' the folk I met.'  'I told ye ut was sumple,' says your
father.  'Ut's the very same way my Donald finds the road tull
Voloparaiso.  He asks every shup he meets upon the sea tull ot last
he meets wuth a shup thot's been tull Voloparaiso, an' the captun
o' thot shup tells hum the way.'  An' Jummy scratches hus head an'
says he understands an' thot ut's a very sumple motter after all."
<P>
The skipper chuckled at the joke, and his tired blue eyes were
merry for the moment.
<P>
"He was a thun chap, thot mate-fellow, oz thun oz you an' me putt
together," he remarked after a time, a slight twinkle in his eye of
appreciation of the bull.  But the twinkle quickly disappeared and
the blue eyes took on a bleak and wintry look.  "What dud he do ot
Voloparaiso but land sux hundred fathom o' chain cable an' take
never a receipt from the lighter-mon.  I was gettun' my clearance
ot the time.  When we got tull sea, I found he hod no receipt for
the cable.
<P>
"'An' ye no took a receipt for ut?' says I.
<P>
"'No,' says he.  'Wasna ut goin' direct tull the agents?'
<P>
"'How long ha' ye been goin' tull sea,' says I, 'not tull be
knowin' the mate's duty uz tull deluver no cargo wuthout receipt
for same?  An' on the West Coast ot thot.  What's tull stop the
lighter-mon from stealun' a few lengths o' ut?'
<P>
"An' ut come out uz I said.  Sux hundred hundred went over the
side, but four hundred an' ninety-five was all the agents received.
The lighter-mon swore ut was all he received from the mate - four
hundred an' ninety-five fathom.  I got a letter from the owners ot
Portland.  They no blamed the mate for ut, but me, an' me ashore ot
the time on shup's buzz'ness.  I could no be in the two places ot
the one time.  An' the letters from the owners an' the agents uz
still comun' tull me.
<P>
"Thot mate-fellow was no a proper sailor, an' no a mon tull work
for owners.  Dudna he want tull break me wuth the Board of Trade
for bein' below my marks?  He said as much tull the bos'n.  An' he
told me tull my face homeward bound thot I'd been half an inch
under my marks.  'Twas at Portland, loadun' cargo un fresh watter
an' goin' tull Comox tull load bunker coal un salt watter.  I tell
ye, Annie, ut takes close fuggerin', an' I WAS half an inch under
the load-line when the bunker coal was un.  But I'm no tellun' any
other body but you.  An' thot mate-fellow untendun' tull report me
tull the Board o' Trade, only for thot he saw fut tull be sliced un
two pieces on the steam-pipe cover.
<P>
"He was a fool.  After loadun' ot Portland I hod tull take on suxty
tons o' coal tull last me tull Comox.  The charges for lighterun'
was heavy, an' no room ot the coal dock.  A French barque was lyin'
alongside the dock an' I spoke tull the captun, askun' hum what he
would charge when work for the day was done, tull haul clear for a
couple o' hours an' let me un.  'Twenty dollars,' said he.  Ut was
savun' money on lighters tull the owner, an' I gave ut tull hum.
An' thot night, after dark, I hauled un an' took on the coal.  Then
I started tull go out un the stream an' drop anchor - under me own
steam, of course.
<P>
"We hod tull go out stern first, an' somethun' went wrong wuth the
reversun' gear.  Old MacPherson said he could work ut by hond, but
very slow ot thot.  An' I said 'All right.'  We started.  The pilot
was on board.  The tide was ebbun' stuffly, an' right abreast an' a
but below was a shup lyin' wuth a lighter on each side.  I saw the
shup's ridun' lights, but never a light on the lighters.  Ut was
close quarters to shuft a bug vessel onder steam, wuth MacPherson
workun' the reversun' gear by hond.  We hod to come close down upon
the shup afore I could go ahead an' clear o' the shups on the dock-
ends.  An' we struck the lighter stern-on, just uz I rung tull
MacPherson half ahead.
<P>
"'What was thot?' says the pilot, when we struck the lighter.
<P>
"'I dunna know,' says I, 'an' I'm wonderun'.'
<P>
"The pilot was no keen, ye see, tull hus job.  I went on tull a
guid place an' dropped anchor, an' ut would all a-been well but for
thot domned eediot mate.
<P>
"'We smashed thot lighter,' says he, comun' up the lodder tull the
brudge - an' the pilot stondun' there wuth his ears cocked tull
hear.
<P>
"'What lighter?' says I.
<P>
"'Thot lighter alongside the shup,' says the mate.
<P>
"'I dudna see no lighter,' says I, and wuth thot I steps on hus fut
guid an' hard.
<P>
"After the pilot was gone I says tull the mate:  'Uf you dunna know
onythun', old mon, for Heaven's sake keep your mouth shut.'
<P>
"'But ye dud smash thot lighter, dudn't ye?' says he.
<P>
"'Uf we dud,' says I, 'ut's no your buzz'ness tull be tellun' the
pilot - though, mind ye, I'm no admuttun' there was ony lighter.'
<P>
"An' next marnun', just uz I'm after dressun', the steward says, 'A
mon tull see ye, sir.'  'Fetch hum un,' says I.  An' un he come.
'Sut down,' says I.  An' he sot down.
<P>
"He was the owner of the lighter, an' when he hod told hus story, I
says, 'I dudna see ony lighter.'
<P>
"'What, mon?' says he.  'No see a two-hundred-ton lighter, bug oz a
house, alongside thot shup?'
<P>
"'I was goin' by the shup's lights,' says I, 'an' I dudna touch the
shup, thot I know.'
<P>
"'But ye dud touch the lighter,' says he.  'Ye smashed her.
There's a thousand dollars' domage done, an' I'll see ye pay for
ut.'
<P>
'Look here, muster,' says I, 'when I'm shuftun' a shup ot night I
follow the law, an' the law dustunctly says I must regulate me
actions by the lights o' the shuppun'.  Your lighter never hod no
ridun' light, nor dud I look for ony lighter wuthout lights tull
show ut.'
<P>
"'The mate says - ' he beguns.
<P>
"'Domn the mate,' says I.  'Dud your lighter hov a ridun' light?'
<P>
"'No, ut dud not,' says he, 'but ut was a clear night wuth the moon
a-showun'.'
<P>
"'Ye seem tull know your buzz'ness,' says I.  'But let me tell ye
thot I know my buzz'ness uz well, an' thot I'm no a-lookun' for
lighters wuthout lights.  Uf ye thunk ye hov a case, go ahead.  The
steward will show ye out.  Guid day.'
<P>
"An' thot was the end o' ut.  But ut wull show ye what a puir
fellow thot mate was.  I call ut a blessun' for all masters thot he
was sliced un two on thot steam-pipe cover.  He had a pull un the
office an' thot was the why he was kept on."
<P>
"The Wekley farm wull soon be for sale, so the agents be tellun'
me," his wife remarked, slyly watching what effect her announcement
would have upon him.
<P>
His eyes flashed eagerly on the instant, and he straightened up as
might a man about to engage in some agreeable task.  It was the
farm of his vision, adjoining his father's, and her own people
farmed not a mile away.
<P>
"We wull be buyun' ut," he said, "though we wull be no tellun' a
soul of ut ontul ut's bought an' the money paid down.  I've savun'
consuderable these days, though pickun's uz no what they used to
be, an' we hov a tidy nest-egg laid by.  I wull see the father an'
hove the money ready tull hus hond, so uf I'm ot sea he can buy
whenever the land offers."
<P>
He rubbed the frosted moisture from the inside of the window and
peered out at the pouring rain, through which he could discern
nothing.
<P>
"When I was a young men I used tull be afeard thot the owners would
guv me the sack.  Stull afeard I am of the sack.  But once thot
farm is mine I wull no be afeard ony longer.  Ut's a puir job thus
sea-farmun'.  Me managin' un all seas an' weather an' perils o' the
deep a shup worth fufty thousand pounds, wuth cargoes ot times
worth fufty thousand more - a hundred thousand pounds, half a
million dollars uz the Yankees say, an' me wuth all the
responsubility gettun' a screw o' twenty pounds a month.  What mon
ashore, managin' a buz'ness worth a hundred thousand pounds wull be
gettun' uz small a screw uz twenty pounds?  An' wuth such masters
uz a captun serves - the owners, the underwriters, an' the Board o'
Trade, all pullun' an wantun' dufferent thungs - the owners wantun'
quick passages an' domn the rusk, the underwriters wantun' safe
passages an' domn the delay, an' the Board o' Trade wantun'
cautious passages an' caution always meanun' delay.  Three
dufferent masters, an' all three able an' wullun' to break ye uf ye
don't serve their dufferent wushes."
<P>
He felt the train slackening speed, and peered again through the
misty window.  He stood up, buttoned his overcoat, turned up the
collar, and awkwardly gathered the child, still asleep, in his
arms.
<P>
"I wull see the father," he said, "an' hov the money ready tull hus
hond so uf I'm ot sea when the land offers he wull no muss the
chance tull buy.  An' then the owners can guv me the sack uz soon
uz they like.  Ut will be all night un, an' I wull be wuth you,
Annie, an' the sea can go tull hell."
<P>
Happiness was in both their faces at the prospect, and for a moment
both saw the same vision of peace.  Annie leaned toward him, and as
the train stopped they kissed each other across the sleeping child.
