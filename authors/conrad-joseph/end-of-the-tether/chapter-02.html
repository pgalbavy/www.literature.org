<p> His age sat lightly enough on him; and of his ruin he was not
ashamed. He had not been alone to believe in the stability of
the Banking Corporation. Men whose judgment in matters of finance
was as expert as his seamanship had commended the prudence of
his investments, and had themselves lost much money in the great
failure. The only difference between him and them was that he
had lost his all. And yet not his all. There had remained to him
from his lost fortune a very pretty little bark, Fair Maid, which
he had bought to occupy his leisure of a retired sailor&mdash;"to play
with," as he expressed it himself.</p>

<p>He had formally declared himself tired of the sea the year preceding
his daughter’s marriage. But after the young couple had gone to
settle in Melbourne he found out that he could not make himself
happy on shore. He was too much of a merchant sea-captain for
mere yachting to satisfy him. He wanted the illusion of affairs;
and his acquisition of the Fair Maid preserved the continuity
of his life. He introduced her to his acquaintances in various
ports as "my last command." When he grew too old to be trusted
with a ship, he would lay her up and go ashore to be buried, leaving
directions in his will to have the bark towed out and scuttled
decently in deep water on the day of the funeral. His daughter
would not grudge him the satisfaction of knowing that no stranger
would handle his last command after him. With the fortune he was
able to leave her, the value of a 500-ton bark was neither here
nor there. All this would be said with a jocular twinkle in his
eye: the vigorous old man had too much vitality for the sentimentalism
of regret; and a little wistfully withal, because he was at home
in life, taking a genuine pleasure in its feelings and its possessions;
in the dignity of his reputation and his wealth, in his love for
his daughter, and in his satisfaction with the ship&mdash;the plaything
of his lonely leisure.</p>

<p>He had the cabin arranged in accordance with his simple ideal
of comfort at sea. A big bookcase (he was a great reader) occupied
one side of his stateroom; the portrait of his late wife, a flat
bituminous oil-painting representing the profile and one long
black ringlet of a young woman, faced his bed-place. Three chronometers
ticked him to sleep and greeted him on waking with the tiny competition
of their beats. He rose at five every day. The officer of the
morning watch, drinking his early cup of coffee aft by the wheel,
would hear through the wide orifice of the copper ventilators
all the splashings, blowings, and splutterings of his captain’s
toilet. These noises would be followed by a sustained deep murmur
of the Lord’s Prayer recited in a loud earnest voice. Five minutes
afterwards the head and shoulders of Captain Whalley emerged out
of the companion-hatchway. Invariably he paused for a while on
the stairs, looking all round at the horizon; upwards at the trim
of the sails; inhaling deep draughts of the fresh air. Only then
he would step out on the poop, acknowledging the hand raised to
the peak of the cap with a majestic and benign "Good morning to
you." He walked the deck till eight scrupulously. Sometimes, not
above twice a year, he had to use a thick cudgel-like stick on
account of a stiffness in the hip&mdash;a slight touch of rheumatism,
he supposed. Otherwise he knew nothing of the ills of the flesh.
At the ringing of the breakfast bell he went below to feed his
canaries, wind up the chronometers, and take the head of the table.
From there he had before his eyes the big carbon photographs of
his daughter, her husband, and two fat-legged babies &mdash;his grandchildren&mdash;set
in black frames into the maplewood bulkheads of the cuddy. After
breakfast he dusted the glass over these portraits himself with
a cloth, and brushed the oil painting of his wife with a plumate
kept suspended from a small brass hook by the side of the heavy
gold frame. Then with the door of his stateroom shut, he would
sit down on the couch under the portrait to read a chapter out
of a thick pocket Bible&mdash;her Bible. But on some days he only sat
there for half an hour with his finger between the leaves and
the closed book resting on his knees. Perhaps he had remembered
suddenly how fond of boat-sailing she used to be.</p>

<p>She had been a real shipmate and a true woman too. It was like
an article of faith with him that there never had been, and never
could be, a brighter, cheerier home anywhere afloat or ashore
than his home under the poop-deck of the Condor, with the big
main cabin all white and gold, garlanded as if for a perpetual
festival with an unfading wreath. She had decorated the center
of every panel with a cluster of home flowers. It took her a twelvemonth
to go round the cuddy with this labor of love. To him it had remained
a marvel of painting, the highest achievement of taste and skill;
and as to old Swinburne, his mate, every time he came down to
his meals he stood transfixed with admiration before the progress
of the work. You could almost smell these roses, he declared,
sniffing the faint flavor of turpentine which at that time pervaded
the saloon, and (as he confessed afterwards) made him somewhat
less hearty than usual in tackling his food. But there was nothing
of the sort to interfere with his enjoyment of her singing. "Mrs.
Whalley is a regular out-and-out nightingale, sir," he would pronounce
with a judicial air after listening profoundly over the skylight
to the very end of the piece. In fine weather, in the second dog-watch,
the two men could hear her trills and roulades going on to the
accompaniment of the piano in the cabin. On the very day they
got engaged he had written to London for the instrument; but they
had been married for over a year before it reached them, coming
out round the Cape. The big case made part of the first direct
general cargo landed in Hong-kong harbor&mdash;an event that to the
men who walked the busy quays of to-day seemed as hazily remote
as the dark ages of history. But Captain Whalley could in a half
hour of solitude live again all his life, with its romance, its
idyl, and its sorrow. He had to close her eyes himself. She went
away from under the ensign like a sailor’s wife, a sailor herself
at heart. He had read the service over her, out of her own prayer-book,
without a break in his voice. When he raised his eyes he could
see old Swinburne facing him with his cap pressed to his breast,
and his rugged, weather-beaten, impassive face streaming with
drops of water like a lump of chipped red granite in a shower.
It was all very well for that old sea-dog to cry. He had to read
on to the end; but after the splash he did not remember much of
what happened for the next few days. An elderly sailor of the
crew, deft at needlework, put together a mourning frock for the
child out of one of her black skirts.</p>

<p>He was not likely to forget; but you cannot dam up life like
a sluggish stream. It will break out and flow over a man’s troubles,
it will close upon a sorrow like the sea upon a dead body, no
matter how much love has gone to the bottom. And the world is
not bad. People had been very kind to him; especially Mrs. Gardner,
the wife of the senior partner in Gardner, Patteson, &amp; Co.,
the owners of the Condor. It was she who volunteered to look after
the little one, and in due course took her to England (something
of a journey in those days, even by the overland mail route) with
her own girls to finish her education. It was ten years before
he saw her again.</p>

<p>As a little child she had never been frightened of bad weather;
she would beg to be taken up on deck in the bosom of his oilskin
coat to watch the big seas hurling themselves upon the Condor.
The swirl and crash of the waves seemed to fill her small soul
with a breathless delight. "A good boy spoiled," he used to say
of her in joke. He had named her Ivy because of the sound of the
word, and obscurely fascinated by a vague association of ideas.
She had twined herself tightly round his heart, and he intended
her to cling close to her father as to a tower of strength; forgetting,
while she was little, that in the nature of things she would probably
elect to cling to someone else. But he loved life well enough
for even that event to give him a certain satisfaction, apart
from his more intimate feeling of loss.</p>

<p>After he had purchased the Fair Maid to occupy his loneliness,
he hastened to accept a rather unprofitable freight to Australia
simply for the opportunity of seeing his daughter in her own home.
What made him dissatisfied there was not to see that she clung
now to somebody else, but that the prop she had selected seemed
on closer examination "a rather poor stick"&mdash;even in the matter
of health. He disliked his son-in-law’s studied civility perhaps
more than his method of handling the sum of money he had given
Ivy at her marriage. But of his apprehensions he said nothing.
Only on the day of his departure, with the hall-door open already,
holding her hands and looking steadily into her eyes, he had said,
"You know, my dear, all I have is for you and the chicks. Mind
you write to me openly." She had answered him by an almost imperceptible
movement of her head. She resembled her mother in the color of
her eyes, and in character&mdash;and also in this, that she understood
him without many words.</p>

<p>Sure enough she had to write; and some of these letters made
Captain Whalley lift his white eye-brows. For the rest he considered
he was reaping the true reward of his life by being thus able
to produce on demand whatever was needed. He had not enjoyed himself
so much in a way since his wife had died. Characteristically enough
his son-in-law’s punctuality in failure caused him at a distance
to feel a sort of kindness towards the man. The fellow was so
perpetually being jammed on a lee shore that to charge it all
to his reckless navigation would be manifestly unfair. No, no!
He knew well what that meant. It was bad luck. His own had been
simply marvelous, but he had seen in his life too many good men&mdash;seamen
and others&mdash;go under with the sheer weight of bad luck not to
recognize the fatal signs. For all that, he was cogitating on
the best way of tying up very strictly every penny he had to leave,
when, with a preliminary rumble of rumors (whose first sound reached
him in Shanghai as it happened), the shock of the big failure
came; and, after passing through the phases of stupor, of incredulity,
of indignation, he had to accept the fact that he had nothing
to speak of to leave.</p>

<p>Upon that, as if he had only waited for this catastrophe, the
unlucky man, away there in Melbourne, gave up his unprofitable
game, and sat down&mdash;in an invalid’s bath-chair at that too. "He
will never walk again," wrote the wife. For the first time in
his life Captain Whalley was a bit staggered.</p>

<p>The Fair Maid had to go to work in bitter earnest now. It was
no longer a matter of preserving alive the memory of Dare-devil
Harry Whalley in the Eastern Seas, or of keeping an old man in
pocket-money and clothes, with, perhaps, a bill for a few hundred
first-class cigars thrown in at the end of the year. He would
have to buckle-to, and keep her going hard on a scant allowance
of gilt for the ginger-bread scrolls at her stem and stern.</p>

<p>This necessity opened his eyes to the fundamental changes of
the world. Of his past only the familiar names remained, here
and there, but the things and the men, as he had known them, were
gone. The name of Gardner, Patteson, &amp; Co. was still displayed
on the walls of warehouses by the waterside, on the brass plates
and window-panes in the business quarters of more than one Eastern
port, but there was no longer a Gardner or a Patteson in the firm.
There was no longer for Captain Whalley an arm-chair and a welcome
in the private office, with a bit of business ready to be put
in the way of an old friend, for the sake of bygone services.
The husbands of the Gardner girls sat behind the desks in that
room where, long after he had left the employ, he had kept his
right of entrance in the old man’s time. Their ships now had yellow
funnels with black tops, and a time-table of appointed routes
like a confounded service of tramways. The winds of December and
June were all one to them; their captains (excellent young men
he doubted not) were, to be sure, familiar with Whalley Island,
because of late years the Government had established a white fixed
light on the north end (with a red danger sector over the Condor
Reef), but most of them would have been extremely surprised to
hear that a flesh-and-blood Whalley still existed&mdash;an old man
going about the world trying to pick up a cargo here and there
for his little bark.</p>

<p>And everywhere it was the same. Departed the men who would have
nodded appreciatively at the mention of his name, and would have
thought themselves bound in honor to do something for Dare-devil
Harry Whalley. Departed the opportunities which he would have
known how to seize; and gone with them the white-winged flock
of clippers that lived in the boisterous uncertain life of the
winds, skimming big fortunes out of the foam of the sea. In a
world that pared down the profits to an irreducible minimum, in
a world that was able to count its disengaged tonnage twice over
every day, and in which lean charters were snapped up by cable
three months in advance, there were no chances of fortune for
an individual wandering haphazard with a little bark&mdash;hardly indeed
any room to exist.</p>

<p>He found it more difficult from year to year. He suffered greatly
from the smallness of remittances he was able to send his daughter.
Meantime he had given up good cigars, and even in the matter of
inferior cheroots limited himself to six a day. He never told
her of his difficulties, and she never enlarged upon her struggle
to live. Their confidence in each other needed no explanations,
and their perfect understanding endured without protestations
of gratitude or regret. He would have been shocked if she had
taken it into her head to thank him in so many words, but he found
it perfectly natural that she should tell him she needed two hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>He had come in with the Fair Maid in ballast to look for a freight
in the Sofala’s port of registry, and her letter met him there.
Its tenor was that it was no use mincing matters. Her only resource
was in opening a boarding-house, for which the prospects, she
judged, were good. Good enough, at any rate, to make her tell
him frankly that with two hundred pounds she could make a start.
He had torn the envelope open, hastily, on deck, where it was
handed to him by the ship-chandler’s runner, who had brought his
mail at the moment of anchoring. For the second time in his life
he was appalled, and remained stock-still at the cabin door with
the paper trembling between his fingers. Open a boarding-house!
Two hundred pounds for a start! The only resource! And he did
not know where to lay his hands on two hundred pence.</p>

<p>All that night Captain Whalley walked the poop of his anchored
ship, as though he had been about to close with the land in thick
weather, and uncertain of his position after a run of many gray
days without a sight of sun, moon, or stars. The black night twinkled
with the guiding lights of seamen and the steady straight lines
of lights on shore; and all around the Fair Maid the riding lights
of ships cast trembling trails upon the water of the roadstead.
Captain Whalley saw not a gleam anywhere till the dawn broke and
he found out that his clothing was soaked through with the heavy
dew.</p>

<p>His ship was awake. He stopped short, stroked his wet beard,
and descended the poop ladder backwards, with tired feet. At the
sight of him the chief officer, lounging about sleepily on the
quarterdeck, remained open-mouthed in the middle of a great early-morning
yawn.</p>

<p>"Good morning to you," pronounced Captain Whalley solemnly, passing
into the cabin. But he checked himself in the doorway, and without
looking back, "By the bye," he said, "there should be an empty
wooden case put away in the lazarette. It has not been broken
up&mdash;has it?"</p>

<p>The mate shut his mouth, and then asked as if dazed, "What empty
case, sir?"</p>

<p>"A big flat packing-case belonging to that painting in my room.
Let it be taken up on deck and tell the carpenter to look it over.
I may want to use it before long."</p>

<p>The chief officer did not stir a limb till he had heard the door
of the captain’s state-room slam within the cuddy. Then he beckoned
aft the second mate with his forefinger to tell him that there
was something "in the wind."</p>

<p>When the bell rang Captain Whalley’s authoritative voice boomed
out through a closed door, "Sit down and don’t wait for me." And
his impressed officers took their places, exchanging looks and
whispers across the table. What! No breakfast? And after apparently
knocking about all night on deck, too! Clearly, there was something
in the wind. In the skylight above their heads, bowed earnestly
over the plates, three wire cages rocked and rattled to the restless
jumping of the hungry canaries; and they could detect the sounds
of their "old man’s" deliberate movements within his state-room.
Captain Whalley was methodically winding up the chronometers,
dusting the portrait of his late wife, getting a clean white shirt
out of the drawers, making himself ready in his punctilious unhurried
manner to go ashore. He could not have swallowed a single mouthful
of food that morning. He had made up his mind to sell the Fair
Maid.</p>
