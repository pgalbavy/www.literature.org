<p>One of the most quarrelsome of all Sandy Chipmunk's neighbors was Rowdy
Red-Squirrel. He was happiest when he was fighting. But perhaps that was
because he had never lost a fight. If Rowdy had had a sound beating,
maybe fighting would not have seemed so pleasant to him.
</p>
<p>Ever since Rowdy whipped Frisky Squirrel, who (being a gray squirrel) was
bigger than he was, Rowdy bullied every squirrel in the neighborhood--no
matter what color he might be. As for chipmunks, Rowdy Red-Squirrel
boasted that he could whip six chipmunks at a time.
</p><p>"That is, I could if they would stand still," he said. "Of course, if
they ran off in six different directions it might be a hard thing to do."
</p><p>Rowdy was talking to Jasper Jay, who sat in a tree not far away. His
boasting amused Jasper. First Jasper smiled. Then he laughed aloud. And
after that he gave a hoarse shriek, which rang through the woods most
unpleasantly. At least, that was what Rowdy Red-Squirrel thought.
</p><p>"What's the joke?" he asked.
</p><p>"The joke?" Jasper answered. "Why--ha! ha!--<u>you</u> are the joke! I don't
believe you can whip <u>one</u> chipmunk. And when you talk of whipping <u>six</u>,
I can't help laughing."
</p><p>"You wouldn't laugh if I could catch you," Rowdy Red-Squirrel growled.
And if he hadn't known that Jasper Jay would fly away, he would have
jumped into Jasper's tree and chased him.
</p><p>"You mustn't expect me to believe you can whip <u>six</u> until I've seen you
whip <u>one</u>," Jasper went on. "There's Sandy Chipmunk in that beech tree.
Why don't you steal over there and show me whether you can whip him?"
</p><p>"I'll do it!" Rowdy cried. "Not that I find much pleasure in fighting a
single chipmunk--for I can whip <u>one</u> with my hands tied behind me."
</p><p>"Can you?" Jasper Jay asked. "Then let me see you tie your hands."
</p><p>"I can't!" Rowdy Red-Squirrel replied. "Who ever heard of anybody who
could tie his own hands behind him?... <u>You</u> will have to do that for
me," he said.
</p><p>Jasper Jay gave another loud shriek and rocked back and forth on the limb
where he sat.
</p><p>"Another joke!" he gasped--for he was too clever to be caught like that.
He had no idea of going near enough to Rowdy Red-Squirrel to tie his
hands behind his back.
</p><p>"Well, I see I'll have to whip Sandy Chipmunk just as I am," Rowdy
grumbled. "It won't be much fun for me."
</p><p>"I don't believe it will," Jasper Jay agreed.
</p><p>"After I whip him, you'll have to find six more chipmunks for me, if you
want to see me fight them all at once," Rowdy Red-Squirrel told Jasper
Jay.
</p><p>"I'll do it--if you whip Sandy," Jasper promised. And he laughed so hard
that he almost tumbled off the limb.
