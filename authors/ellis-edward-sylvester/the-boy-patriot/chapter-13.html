<article class="w3-container w3-justify">
<p>Derry Duck was no mean ally. The strength of his arm, and his
position as second in command, gave him great influence on board
the Molly. There were traditions of the power of his bare fist
to deal death with a single blow&mdash;traditions which won for him
an odd kind of respect, and insured for him the obedience he never
failed to exact. Derry having avowed himself the friend of Blair
Robertson, it was well understood that there must be an end to
the peculiar persecutions to which the boy had been subjected.
He could not of course escape such rough usage of word and act
as the crew had for each other, but he was to be no longer their
chosen butt and scape-goat.</p>

<p>Blair felt at once the advantage of having so powerful "a friend
at court," and he eagerly seized upon the favorable turn in affairs
to carry out his new plans and wishes for his associates. It had
struck him that there was but one way to avoid having his ears
pained and his soul polluted by the conversation that was the
entertainment of the mess. He must do his share of the talking,
and so adapt it to his own taste and principles. The lion's share
Blair determined it should be, and that without unfairness, as
he had to make up for lost time. Once assured that Brimstone's
unwashed hand was not to be placed over his mouth if he attempted
to speak, and the cry, "Shut up, Mum," raised by his companions,
Blair's tongue was set loose.</p>

<p>We have said that Blair was by no means averse to hearing his
own voice; and much as his guiding motives and aims had changed,
the Blair on board the Molly was still the same human being that
he was in Joe Robertson's little parlor in Fairport. Never did
city belle strive more earnestly to make her conversation attractive
to her hearers, than did our young patriot, actuated by a motive
which is in comparison with hers as the sunlight to the glow-worm's
uncertain ray.</p>

<p>Blair had songs to sing and speeches to make. He had wild stories
of the struggles of the early settlers of Maine, caught long ago
from the lips of gray-haired men and treasured in the boy's heart,
that had little reckoned the coming use for these hoarded wonders.
The captains who had shared the services of the pilot of Fairport
had filled his willing ears with tales of their adventures in
every sea and on every coast, and the fond father had garnered
these marvellous legends to tell to his little listener at home,
till the child's eyes glowed bright as he panted to taste of peril,
and do and dare amid the stormy waves.</p>

<p>Now indeed came a time of peril to Blair. With secret delight
he found he had a power to charm and move even the rough band
who gathered round him to catch every word of the glowing narratives
he poured forth from his crowded storehouse. There is something
within us all which prompts us to adapt our conversation to the
taste and capacity of our companions. A kindly inclination it
may be, and yet it is full of danger. He who may dare to be "all
things to all men," must, like St. Paul, have set his feet on
the rock Christ Jesus, and be exalted by the continual remembrance
of the "cloud of witnesses" in the heavenly kingdom, and the fixed,
all-searching glance of the pure eye of God, reading the inmost
soul.</p>

<p>Insensibly Blair inclined to use the language in which his hearers
couched their own thoughts. As we speak baby-talk to the infant,
and broken English to the Frenchman, he unconsciously dealt in
expressions adapted to the wild eager faces that looked into his.
Here had surely been a temptation that would have dragged the
young speaker down to the pit which the great adversary had made
ready for him, but for the strong Deliverer who walked amid the
flames of fire with the three faithful "children" of old.</p>

<p>Blair saw his danger, and met it not in his own strength. Whether
he sat down at table, or mingled in the groups on deck, or shared
the watch of a companion, by a determined and prayerful effort
he strove to keep in his mind the presence of "One like unto the
Son of man." To him that face, unsullied by taint of sin or shame,
was in the midst of the weather-beaten, guilt-marked countenances
of the crew of the Molly. He who "turned and looked on Peter"
was asking his young servant in a tender, appealing glance, "Will
you blaspheme my name? Will you offend Him in whose eyes the heavens
are not pure, and who chargeth even his angels with folly?"</p>

<p>A deep "No; so help me God," was the full response of the whole
being of Blair Robertson. He would watch his tongue and guard
his lips by the continual prayer which should stir in his heart
in the midst of speech, song, or tale of wild adventure.</p>

<p>When the young sailor had taught his listeners gladly to hear
when he would give them pleasure, he by degrees gave full utterance
to the natural language and interests of his heart. They learned
to love to listen even when he poured forth in his peculiarly
melodious voice some majestic mariner's hymn, or told in thrilling
tones how some God-fearing seaman had stood at the helm of a burning
ship and headed her to land, until he passed from amid the devouring
flames to the glory of the kingdom of heaven. They heard and could
not but admire the story of the unselfish Christian captain, who
saw himself left alone on the sinking ship, but would not crowd
the already overloaded boats with his manly form. He preferred
to meet his doom in the path of duty, and on the deck where God
had placed him go down to the depths of the sea, sure that his
Saviour would there receive him and give him an abundant entrance
into heaven.</p>

<p>Thus in his own way Blair was laboring for the welfare of his
shipmates, ever praying that some good seed might be blessed by
the Lord of the vineyard, and spring up unto eternal life.</p>
