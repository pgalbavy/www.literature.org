<p>It was a dull and dreary day, as Betty had foreseen it would be. Heavy
rain clouds hung and threatened, and the atmosphere was damp and chill.
It was one of those days of the English autumn which speak only of the
end of things, bereaving one of the power to remember next year's spring
and summer, which, after all, must surely come. Sky is grey, trees are
grey, dead leaves lie damp beneath the feet, sunlight and birds seem
forgotten things. All that has been sad and to be regretted or feared
hangs heavy in the air and sways all thought. In the passing of these
hours there is no hope anywhere. Betty appeared at breakfast in short
dress and close hat. She wore thick little boots, as if for walking.
</p><p>“I am going to make visits in the village,” she said. “I want a basket
of good things to take with me. Stourton's children need feeding after
their measles. They looked very thin when I saw them playing in the road
yesterday.”
</p><p>“Yes, dear,” Rosalie answered. “Mrs. Noakes shall prepare the basket.
Good chicken broth, and jelly, and nourishing things. Jennings,” to the
butler, “you know the kind of basket Miss Vanderpoel wants. Speak to
Mrs. Noakes, please.”
</p><p>“Yes, my lady,” Jennings knew the kind of basket and so did Mrs. Noakes.
Below stairs a strong sympathy with Miss Vanderpoel's movements had
developed. No one resented the preparation of baskets. Somehow they were
always managed, even if asked for at untimely hours.
</p><p>Betty was sitting silent, looking out into the greyness of the
autumn-smitten park.
</p><p>“Are--are you listening for anything, Betty?” Lady Anstruthers asked
rather falteringly. “You have a sort of listening look in your eyes.”
</p><p>Betty came back to the room, as it were.
</p><p>“Have I,” she said. “Yes, I think I was listening for--something.”
</p><p>And Rosalie did not ask her what she listened for. She was afraid she
knew.
</p><p>It was not only the Stourtons Betty visited this morning. She passed
from one cottage to another--to see old women, and old men, as well as
young ones, who for one reason or another needed help and encouragement.
By one bedside she read aloud; by another she sat and told cheerful
stories; she listened to talk in little kitchens, and in one house
welcomed a newborn thing. As she walked steadily over grey road and
down grey lanes damp mist rose and hung about her. And she did not walk
alone. Fear walked with her, and anguish, a grey ghost by her side. Once
she found herself standing quite still on a side path, covering her face
with her hands. She filled every moment of the morning, and walked until
she was tired. Before she went home she called at the post office,
and Mr. Tewson greeted her with a solemn face. He did not wait to be
questioned.
</p><p>“There's been no news to-day, miss, so far,” he said. “And that seems
as if they might be so given up to hard work at a dreadful time that
there's been no chance for anything to get out. When people's hanging
over a man's bed at the end, it's as if everything stopped but
that--that's stopping for all time.”
</p><p>After luncheon the rain began to fall softly, slowly, and with a
suggestion of endlessness. It was a sort of mist itself, and became a
damp shadow among the bare branches of trees which soon began to drip.
</p><p>“You have been walking about all morning, and you are tired, dear,” Lady
Anstruthers said to her. “Won't you go to your room and rest, Betty?”
</p><p>Yes, she would go to her room, she said. Some new books had arrived from
London this morning, and she would look over them. She talked a little
about her visits before she went, and when, as she talked, Ughtred came
over to her and stood close to her side holding her hand and stroking
it, she smiled at him sweetly--the smile he adored. He stroked the hand
and softly patted it, watching her wistfully. Suddenly he lifted it to
his lips, and kissed it again and again with a sort of passion.
</p><p>“I love you so much, Aunt Betty,” he cried. “We both love you so much.
Something makes me love you to-day more than ever I did before. It
almost makes me cry. I love you so.”
</p><p>She stooped swiftly and drew him into her arms and kissed him close and
hard. He held his head back a little and looked into the blue under her
lashes.
</p><p>“I love your eyes,” he said. “Anyone would love your eyes, Aunt Betty.
But what is the matter with them? You are not crying at all, but--oh!
what is the matter?”
</p><p>“No, I am not crying at all,” she said, and smiled--almost laughed.
</p><p>But after she had kissed him again she took her books and went upstairs.
</p><p>She did not lie down, and she did not read when she was alone in her
room. She drew a long chair before the window and watched the slow
falling of the rain. There is nothing like it--that slow weeping of the
rain on an English autumn day. Soft and light though it was, the park
began to look sodden. The bare trees held out their branches like
imploring arms, the brown garden beds were neat and bare. The same rain
was drip-dripping at Mount Dunstan--upon the desolate great house--upon
the village--upon the mounds and ancient stone tombs in the churchyard,
sinking into the earth--sinking deep, sucked in by the clay beneath--the
cold damp clay. She shook herself shudderingly. Why should the thought
come to her--the cold damp clay? She would not listen to it, she would
think of New York, of its roaring streets and crash of sound, of the
rush of fierce life there--of her father and mother. She tried to force
herself to call up pictures of Broadway, swarming with crowds of black
things, which, seen from the windows of its monstrous buildings,
seemed like swarms of ants, burst out of ant-hills, out of a thousand
ant-hills. She tried to remember shop windows, the things in them, the
throngs going by, and the throngs passing in and out of great, swinging
glass doors. She dragged up before her a vision of Rosalie, driving
with her mother and herself, looking about her at the new buildings and
changed streets, flushed and made radiant by the accelerated pace and
excitement of her beloved New York. But, oh, the slow, penetrating
rainfall, and--the cold damp clay!
</p><p>She rose, making an involuntary sound which was half a moan. The long
mirror set between two windows showed her momentarily an awful young
figure, throwing up its arms. Was that Betty Vanderpoel--that?
</p><p>“What does one do,” she said, “when the world comes to an end? What does
one do?”
</p><p>All her days she had done things--there had always been something to do.
Now there was nothing. She went suddenly to her bell and rang for her
maid. The woman answered the summons at once.
</p><p>“Send word to the stable that I want Childe Harold. I do not want Mason.
I shall ride alone.”
</p><p>“Yes, miss,” Ambleston answered, without any exterior sign of emotion.
She was too well-trained a person to express any shade of her internal
amazement. After she had transmitted the order to the proper manager she
returned and changed her mistress's costume.
</p><p>She had contemplated her task, and was standing behind Miss Vanderpoel's
chair, putting the last touch to her veil, when she became conscious of
a slight stiffening of the neck which held so well the handsome head,
then the head slowly turned towards the window giving upon the front
park. Miss Vanderpoel was listening to something, listening so intently
that Ambleston felt that, for a few moments, she did not seem to
breathe. The maid's hands fell from the veil, and she began to listen
also. She had been at the service the day before. Miss Vanderpoel rose
from her chair slowly--very slowly, and took a step forward. Then she
stood still and listened again.
</p><p>“Open that window, if you please,” she commanded--“as if a stone image
was speaking”--Ambleston said later. The window was thrown open, and for
a few seconds they both stood still again. When Miss Vanderpoel spoke,
it was as if she had forgotten where she was, or as if she were in a
dream.
</p><p>“It is the ringers,” she said. “They are tolling the passing bell.”
</p><p>The serving woman was soft of heart, and had her feminine emotions.
There had been much talk of this thing in the servant's hall. She turned
upon Betty, and forgot all rules and training.
</p><p>“Oh, miss!” she cried. “He's gone--he's gone! That good man--out of this
hard world. Oh, miss, excuse me--do!” And as she burst into wild tears,
she ran out of the room.
</p><p>. . . . .
</p><p>Rosalie had been sitting in the morning room. She also had striven to
occupy herself with work. She had written to her mother, she had read,
she had embroidered, and then read again. What was Betty doing--what was
she thinking now? She laid her book down in her lap, and covering her
face with her hands, breathed a desperate little prayer. That life
should be pain and emptiness to herself, seemed somehow natural since
she had married Nigel--but pain and emptiness for Betty--No! No! No! Not
for Betty! Piteous sorrow poured upon her like a flood. She did not know
how the time passed. She sat, huddled together in her chair, with hidden
face. She could not bear to look at the rain and ghost mist out of
doors. Oh, if her mother were only here, and she might speak to her! And
as her loving tears broke forth afresh, she heard the door open.
</p><p>“If you please, my lady--I beg your pardon, my lady,” as she started and
uncovered her face.
</p><p>“What is it, Jennings?”
</p><p>The figure at the door was that of the serious, elderly butler, and he
wore a respectfully grave air.
</p><p>“As your ladyship is sitting in this room, we thought it likely you
would not hear, the windows being closed, and we felt sure, my lady,
that you would wish to know----”
</p><p>Lady Anstruthers' hands shook as they clung to the arms of her chair.
</p><p>“To know----” she faltered. “Hear what?”
</p><p>“The passing bell is tolling, my lady. It has just begun. It is for
Lord Mount Dunstan. There's not a dry eye downstairs, your ladyship, not
one.”
</p><p>He opened the windows, and she stood up. Jennings quietly left the room.
The slow, heavy knell struck ponderously on the damp air, and she stood
and shivered.
</p><p>A moment or two later she turned, because it seemed as if she must.
</p><p>Betty, in her riding habit, was standing motionless against the door,
her wonderful eyes still as death, gazing at her, gazing in an awful,
simple silence.
</p><p>Oh, what was the use of being afraid to speak at such a time as this?
In one moment Rosy was kneeling at her feet, clinging about her knees,
kissing her hands, the very cloth of her habit, and sobbing aloud.
</p><p>“Oh, my darling--my love--my own Betty! I don't know--and I won't
ask--but speak to me--speak just a word--my dearest dear!”
</p><p>Betty raised her up and drew her within the room, closing the door
behind them.
</p><p>“Kind little Rosy,” she said. “I came to speak--because we two love each
other. You need not ask, I will tell you. That bell is tolling for the
man who taught me--to KNOW. He never spoke to me of love. I have not one
word or look to remember. And now---- Oh, listen--listen! I have been
listening since the morning of yesterday.” It was an awful thing--her
white face, with all the flame of life swept out of it.
</p><p>“Don't listen--darling--darling!” Rosy cried out in anguish. “Shut your
ears--shut your ears!” And she tried to throw her arms around the high
black head, and stifle all sound with her embrace.
</p><p>“I don't want to shut them,” was the answer. “All the unkindness and
misery are over for him, I ought to thank God--but I don't. I shall
hear--O Rosy, listen!--I shall hear that to the end of my days.”
</p><p>Rosy held her tight, and rocked and sobbed.
</p><p>“My Betty,” she kept saying. “My Betty,” and she could say no more. What
more was there to say? At last Betty withdrew herself from her arms, and
then Rosalie noticed for the first time that she wore the habit.
</p><p>“Dearest,” she whispered, “what are you going to do?”
</p><p>“I was going to ride, and I am going to do it still. I must do
something. I shall ride a long, long way--and ride hard. You won't try
to keep me, Rosy. You will understand.”
</p><p>“Yes,” biting her lip, and looking at her with large, awed eyes, as she
patted her arm with a hand that trembled. “I would not hold you back,
Betty, from anything in the world you chose to do.”
</p><p>And with another long, clinging clasp of her, she let her go.
</p><p>Mason was standing by Childe Harold when she went down the broad steps.
He also wore a look of repressed emotion, and stood with bared head
bent, his eyes fixed on the gravel of the drive, listening to the heavy
strokes of the bell in the church tower, rather as if he were taking
part in some solemn ceremony.
</p><p>He mounted her silently, and after he had given her the bridle, looked
up, and spoke in a somewhat husky voice:
</p><p>“The order was that you did not want me, miss? Was that correct?”
</p><p>“Yes, I wish to ride alone.”
</p><p>“Yes, miss. Thank you, miss.”
</p><p>Childe Harold was in good spirits. He held up his head, and blew the
breath through his delicate, dilated, red nostrils as he set out with
his favourite sidling, dancing steps. Mason watched him down the avenue,
saw the lodge keeper come out to open the gate, and curtsy as her
ladyship's sister passed through it. After that he went slowly back to
the stables, and sat in the harness-room a long time, staring at the
floor, as the bell struck ponderously on his ear.
</p><p>The woman who had opened the gate for her Betty saw had red eyes. She
knew why.
</p><p>“A year ago they all thought of him as an outcast. They would have
believed any evil they had heard connected with his name. Now, in every
cottage, there is weeping--weeping. And he lies deaf and dumb,” was her
thought.
</p><p>She did not wish to pass through the village, and turned down a side
road, which would lead her to where she could cross the marshes, and
come upon lonely places. The more lonely, the better. Every few moments
she caught her breath with a hard short gasp. The slow rain fell upon
her, big round, crystal drops hung on the hedgerows, and dripped upon
the grass banks below them; the trees, wreathed with mist, were like
waiting ghosts as she passed them by; Childe Harold's hoof upon the
road, made a hollow, lonely sound.
</p><p>A thought began to fill her brain, and make insistent pressure upon it.
She tried no more to thrust thought away. Those who lay deaf and dumb,
those for whom people wept--where were they when the weeping seemed to
sound through all the world? How far had they gone? Was it far? Could
they hear and could they see? If one plead with them aloud, could they
draw near to listen? Did they begin a long, long journey as soon as they
had slipped away? The “wonder of the world,” she had said, watching life
swelling and bursting the seeds in Kedgers' hothouses! But this was a
greater wonder still, because of its awesomeness. This man had been, and
who dare say he was not--even now? The strength of his great body, the
look in his red-brown eyes, the sound of his deep voice, the struggle,
the meaning of him, where were they? She heard herself followed by the
hollow echo of Childe Harold's hoofs, as she rode past copse and hedge,
and wet spreading fields. She was this hour as he had been a month
ago. If, with some strange suddenness, this which was Betty Vanderpoel,
slipped from its body----She put her hand up to her forehead. It was
unthinkable that there would be no more. Where was he now--where was he
now?
</p><p>This was the thought that filled her brain cells to the exclusion of all
others. Over the road, down through by-lanes, out on the marshes. Where
was he--where was he--WHERE? Childe Harold's hoofs began to beat it out
as a refrain. She heard nothing else. She did not know where she was
going and did not ask herself. She went down any road or lane which
looked empty of life, she took strange turnings, without caring; she did
not know how far she was afield.
</p><p>Where was he now--this hour--this moment--where was he now? Did he know
the rain, the greyness, the desolation of the world?
</p><p>Once she stopped her horse on the loneliness of the marsh land, and
looked up at the low clouds about her, at the creeping mist, the dank
grass. It seemed a place in which a newly-released soul might wander
because it did not yet know its way.
</p><p>“If you should be near, and come to me, you will understand,” her clear
voice said gravely between the caught breaths, “what I gave you was
nothing to you--but you took it with you. Perhaps you know without my
telling you. I want you to know. When a man is dead, everything melts
away. I loved you. I wish you had loved me.”
