When the light of day broke upon the little craft to
whose deck the Princess of Ptarth had been snatched
from her father's garden, Thuvia saw that the night had
wrought a change in her abductors.
<P>
No longer did their trappings gleam with the metal of Dusar,
but instead there was emblazoned there the insignia of the
Prince of Helium.
<P>
The girl felt renewed hope, for she could not believe that
in the heart of Carthoris could lie intent to harm her.
<P>
She spoke to the warrior squatting before the control board.
<P>
"Last night you wore the trappings of a Dusarian,"
she said.  "Now your metal is that of Helium.
What means it?"
<P>
The man looked at her with a grin.
<P>
"The Prince of Helium is no fool," he said.
<P>
Just then an officer emerged from the tiny cabin.  He
reprimanded the warrior for conversing with the prisoner,
nor would he himself reply to any of her inquiries.
<P>
No harm was offered her during the journey, and so
they came at last to their destination with the girl no
wiser as to her abductors or their purpose than at first.
<P>
Here the flier settled slowly into the plaza of one of
those mute monuments of Mars' dead and forgotten past--
the deserted cities that fringe the sad ochre sea-bottoms
where once rolled the mighty floods upon whose bosoms moved
the maritime commerce of the peoples that are gone for ever.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth was no stranger to such places.
During her wanderings in search of the River Iss,
that time she had set out upon what, for countless ages,
had been the last, long pilgrimage of Martians, toward
the Valley Dor, where lies the Lost Sea of Korus,
she had encountered several of these sad reminders
of the greatness and the glory of ancient Barsoom.
<P>
And again, during her flight from the temples of the
Holy Therns with Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, she had
seen them, with their weird and ghostly inmates, the
great white apes of Barsoom.
<P>
She knew, too, that many of them were used now by
the nomadic tribes of green men, but that among them
all was no city that the red men did not shun, for without
exception they stood amidst vast, waterless tracts,
unsuited for the continued sustenance of the dominant
race of Martians.
<P>
Why, then, should they be bringing her to such a place?
There was but a single answer.  Such was the nature
of their work that they must needs seek the seclusion
that a dead city afforded.  The girl trembled at thought
of her plight.
<P>
For two days her captors kept her within a huge palace
that even in decay reflected the splendour of the age
which its youth had known.
<P>
Just before dawn on the third day she had been aroused
by the voices of two of her abductors.
<P>
"He should be here by dawn," one was saying.  "Have her
in readiness upon the plaza--else he will never land.
The moment he finds that he is in a strange country
he will turn about--methinks the prince's plan is weak
in this one spot."
<P>
"There was no other way," replied the other.  "It is
wondrous work to get them both here at all, and even
if we do not succeed in luring him to the ground,
we shall have accomplished much."
<P>
Just then the speaker caught the eyes of Thuvia upon him,
revealed by the quick-moving patch of light cast by Thuria
in her mad race through the heavens.
<P>
With a quick sign to the other, he ceased speaking,
and advancing toward the girl, motioned her to rise. 
Then he led her out into the night toward the centre
of the great plaza.
<P>
"Stand here," he commanded, "until we come for you. 
We shall be watching, and should you attempt to escape
it will go ill with you--much worse than death.
Such are the prince's orders."
<P>
Then he turned and retraced his steps toward the palace,
leaving her alone in the midst of the unseen terrors of
the haunted city, for in truth these places are haunted
in the belief of many Martians who still cling to an ancient
superstition which teaches that the spirits of Holy Therns
who die before their allotted one thousand years, pass,
on occasions, into the bodies of the great white apes.
<P>
To Thuvia, however, the real danger of attack by one
of these ferocious, manlike beasts was quite sufficient. 
She no longer believed in the weird soul transmigration
that the therns had taught her before she was rescued
from their clutches by John Carter; but she well knew the
horrid fate that awaited her should one of the terrible
beasts chance to spy her during its nocturnal prowlings.
<P>
What was that?
<P>
Surely she could not be mistaken.  Something had moved,
stealthily, in the shadow of one of the great monoliths
that line the avenue where it entered the plaza opposite her!
<P>
Thar Ban, jed among the hordes of Torquas, rode
swiftly across the ochre vegetation of the dead sea-
bottom toward the ruins of ancient Aaanthor.
<P>
He had ridden far that night, and fast, for he had but
come from the despoiling of the incubator of a neighbouring
green horde with which the hordes of Torquas were
perpetually warring.
<P>
His giant thoat was far from jaded, yet it would be
well, thought Thar Ban, to permit him to graze upon
the ochre moss which grows to greater height within the
protected courtyards of deserted cities, where the soil is
richer than on the sea-bottoms, and the plants partly
shaded from the sun during the cloudless Martian day.
<P>
Within the tiny stems of this dry-seeming plant is
sufficient moisture for the needs of the huge bodies of
the mighty thoats, which can exist for months without
water, and for days without even the slight moisture
which the ochre moss contains.
<P>
As Thar Ban rode noiselessly up the broad avenue
which leads from the quays of Aaanthor to the great
central plaza, he and his mount might have been mistaken
for spectres from a world of dreams, so grotesque the man
and beast, so soundless the great thoat's padded, nailless
feet upon the moss-grown flagging of the ancient pavement.
<P>
The man was a splendid specimen of his race.  Fully
fifteen feet towered his great height from sole to pate.
The moonlight glistened against his glossy green hide,
sparkling the jewels of his heavy harness and the ornaments
that weighted his four muscular arms, while the
upcurving tusks that protruded from his lower jaw
gleamed white and terrible.
<P>
At the side of his thoat were slung his long radium
rifle and his great, forty-foot, metal-shod spear, while
from his own harness depended his long-sword and his
short-sword, as well as his lesser weapons.
<P>
His protruding eyes and antennae-like ears were turning
constantly hither and thither, for Thar Ban was yet
in the country of the enemy, and, too, there was always
the menace of the great white apes, which, John Carter
was wont to say, are the only creatures that can arouse
in the breasts of these fierce denizens of the dead
sea-bottoms even the remotest semblance of fear.
<P>
As the rider neared the plaza, he reined suddenly in.
His slender, tubular ears pointed rigidly forward.
An unwonted sound had reached them.  Voices!  And where
there were voices, outside of Torquas, there, too,
were enemies.  All the world of wide Barsoom contained
naught but enemies for the fierce Torquasians.
<P>
Thar Ban dismounted.  Keeping in the shadows of the
great monoliths that line the Avenue of Quays of sleeping
Aaanthor, he approached the plaza.  Directly behind him,
as a hound at heel, came the slate-grey thoat, his white
belly shadowed by his barrel, his vivid yellow feet merging
into the yellow of the moss beneath them.
<P>
In the centre of the plaza Thar Ban saw the figure
of a red woman.  A red warrior was conversing with
her.  Now the man turned and retraced his steps toward
the palace at the opposite side of the plaza.
<P>
Thar Ban watched until he had disappeared within
the yawning portal.  Here was a captive worth having!
Seldom did a female of their hereditary enemies fall to
the lot of a green man.  Thar Ban licked his thin lips.
<P>
Thuvia of Ptarth watched the shadow behind the monolith at
the opening to the avenue opposite her.  She hoped that it
might be but the figment of an overwrought imagination.
<P>
But no!  Now, clearly and distinctly, she saw it move.
It came from behind the screening shelter of the ersite shaft.
<P>
The sudden light of the rising sun fell upon it.
The girl trembled.  The THING was a huge green warrior!
<P>
Swiftly it sprang toward her.  She screamed and tried
to flee; but she had scarce turned toward the palace when
a giant hand fell upon her arm, she was whirled about,
and half dragged, half carried toward a huge thoat
that was slowly grazing out of the avenue's mouth
on to the ochre moss of the plaza.
<P>
At the same instant she turned her face upward toward
the whirring sound of something above her, and there
she saw a swift flier dropping toward her, the head
and shoulders of a man leaning far over the side;
but the man's features were deeply shadowed, so that
she did not recognize them.
<P>
Now from behind her came the shouts of her red abductors.
They were racing madly after him who dared to steal what
they already had stolen.
<P>
As Thar Ban reached the side of his mount he snatched
his long radium rifle from its boot, and, wheeling,
poured three shots into the oncoming red men.
<P>
Such is the uncanny marksmanship of these Martian
savages that three red warriors dropped in their tracks
as three projectiles exploded in their vitals.
<P>
The others halted, nor did they dare return the fire
for fear of wounding the girl.
<P>
Then Thar Ban vaulted to the back of his thoat, Thuvia of Ptarth
still in his arms, and with a savage cry of triumph disappeared
down the black canyon of the Avenue of Quays between the sullen
palaces of forgotten Aaanthor.
<P>
Carthoris' flier had not touched the ground before he
had sprung from its deck to race after the swift thoat,
whose eight long legs were sending it down the avenue
at the rate of an express train; but the men of Dusar
who still remained alive had no mind to permit so valuable
a capture to escape them.
<P>
They had lost the girl.  That would be a difficult thing
to explain to Astok; but some leniency might be expected
could they carry the Prince of Helium to their
master instead.
<P>
So the three who remained set upon Carthoris with
their long-swords, crying to him to surrender; but they
might as successfully have cried aloud to Thuria to
cease her mad hurtling through the Barsoomian sky, for
Carthoris of Helium was a true son of the Warlord of Mars
and his incomparable Dejah Thoris.
<P>
Carthoris' long-sword had been already in his hand
as he leaped from the deck of the flier, so the instant
that he realized the menace of the three red warriors,
he wheeled to face them, meeting their onslaught as only
John Carter himself might have done.
<P>
So swift his sword, so mighty and agile his half-earthly
muscles, that one of his opponents was down, crimsoning
the ochre moss with his life-blood, when he had scarce
made a single pass at Carthoris.
<P>
Now the two remaining Dusarians rushed simultaneously
upon the Heliumite.  Three long-swords clashed and
sparkled in the moonlight, until the great white apes,
roused from their slumbers, crept to the lowering windows
of the dead city to view the bloody scene beneath them.
<P>
Thrice was Carthoris touched, so that the red blood
ran down his face, blinding him and dyeing his broad
chest.  With his free hand he wiped the gore from his
eyes, and with the fighting smile of his father touching
his lips, leaped upon his antagonists with renewed fury.
<P>
A single cut of his heavy sword severed the head of
one of them, and then the other, backing away clear of
that point of death, turned and fled toward the palace
at his back.
<P>
Carthoris made no step to pursue.  He had other concern
than the meting of even well-deserved punishment to strange
men who masqueraded in the metal of his own house,
for he had seen that these men were tricked out in
the insignia that marked his personal followers.
<P>
Turning quickly toward his flier, he was soon rising
from the plaza in pursuit of Thar Ban.
<P>
The red warrior whom he had put to flight turned in the
entrance to the palace, and, seeing Carthoris' intent,
snatched a rifle from those that he and his fellows
had left leaning against the wall as they had rushed out
with drawn swords to prevent the theft of their prisoner.
<P>
Few red men are good shots, for the sword is their
chosen weapon; so now as the Dusarian drew bead upon
the rising flier, and touched the button upon his rifle's
stock, it was more to chance than proficiency that he
owed the partial success of his aim.
<P>
The projectile grazed the flier's side, the opaque
coating breaking sufficiently to permit daylight to
strike in upon the powder phial within the bullet's nose.
There was a sharp explosion.  Carthoris felt his craft reel
drunkenly beneath him, and the engine stopped.
<P>
The momentum the air boat had gained carried her on
over the city toward the sea-bottom beyond.
<P>
The red warrior in the plaza fired several more shots,
none of which scored.  Then a lofty minaret shut the
drifting quarry from his view.
<P>
In the distance before him Carthoris could see the
green warrior bearing Thuvia of Ptarth away upon his
mighty thoat.  The direction of his flight was toward
the north-west of Aaanthor, where lay a mountainous
country little known to red men.
<P>
The Heliumite now gave his attention to his injured craft.
A close examination revealed the face that one of the
buoyancy tanks had been punctured, but the engine
itself was uninjured.
<P>
A splinter from the projectile had damaged one of
the control levers beyond the possibility of repair
outside a machine shop; but after considerable tinkering,
Carthoris was able to propel his wounded flier at low
speed, a rate which could not approach the rapid gait
of the thoat, whose eight long, powerful legs carried it
over the ochre vegetation of the dead sea-bottom at
terrific speed.
<P>
The Prince of Helium chafed and fretted at the slowness
of his pursuit, yet he was thankful that the damage
was no worse, for now he could at least move more
rapidly than on foot.
<P>
But even this meagre satisfaction was soon to be denied
him, for presently the flier commenced to sag toward
the port and by the bow.  The damage to the buoyancy
tanks had evidently been more grievous than he had at
first believed.
<P>
All the balance of that long day Carthoris crawled
erratically through the still air, the bow of the flier
sinking lower and lower, and the list to port becoming more
and more alarming, until at last, near dark, he was floating
almost bowdown, his harness buckled to a heavy
deck ring to keep him from being precipitated to the
ground below.
<P>
His forward movement was now confined to a slow drifting
with the gentle breeze that blew out of the south-east,
and when this died down with the setting of the sun,
he let the flier sink gently to the mossy carpet beneath.
<P>
Far before him loomed the mountains toward which
the green man had been fleeing when last he had seen
him, and with dogged resolution the son of John Carter,
endowed with the indomitable will of his mighty sire,
took up the pursuit on foot.
<P>
All that night he forged ahead until, with the dawning
of a new day, he entered the low foothills that guard
the approach to the fastness of the mountains of Torquas.
<P>
Rugged, granitic walls towered before him.  Nowhere
could he discern an opening through the formidable
barrier; yet somewhere into this inhospitable world
of stone the green warrior had borne the woman of
the red man's heart's desire.
<P>
Across the yielding moss of the sea-bottom there had
been no spoor to follow, for the soft pads of the thoat
but pressed down in his swift passage the resilient
vegetation which sprang up again behind his fleeting
feet, leaving no sign.
<P>
But here in the hills, where loose rock occasionally
strewed the way; where black loam and wild flowers
partially replaced the sombre monotony of the waste
places of the lowlands, Carthoris hoped to find some
sign that would lead him in the right direction.
<P>
Yet, search as he would, the baffling mystery of the
trail seemed likely to remain for ever unsolved.
<P>
It was drawing toward the day's close once more when
the keen eyes of the Heliumite discerned the tawny
yellow of a sleek hide moving among the boulders
several hundred yards to his left.
<P>
Crouching quickly behind a large rock, Carthoris
watched the thing before him.  It was a huge banth,
one of those savage Barsoomian lions that roam the
desolate hills of the dying planet.
<P>
The creature's nose was close to the ground.  It was
evident that he was following the spoor of meat by scent.
<P>
As Carthoris watched him, a great hope leaped into
the man's heart.  Here, possibly, might lie the solution
to the mystery he had been endeavouring to solve.  This
hungry carnivore, keen always for the flesh of man,
might even now be trailing the two whom Carthoris sought.
<P>
Cautiously the youth crept out upon the trail of the
man-eater.  Along the foot of the perpendicular cliff the
creature moved, sniffing at the invisible spoor, and now
and then emitting the low moan of the hunting banth.
<P>
Carthoris had followed the creature for but a few
minutes when it disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously
as though dissolved into thin air.
<P>
The man leaped to his feet.  Not again was he to be
cheated as the man had cheated him.  He sprang forward
at a reckless pace to the spot at which he last had
seen the great, skulking brute.
<P>
Before him loomed the sheer cliff, its face unbroken
by any aperture into which the huge banth might have
wormed its great carcass.  Beside him was a small, flat
boulder, not larger than the deck of a ten-man flier, nor
standing to a greater height than twice his own stature.
<P>
Perhaps the banth was in hiding behind this?  The brute
might have discovered the man upon his trail, and even
now be lying in wait for his easy prey.
<P>
Cautiously, with drawn long-sword, Carthoris crept
around the corner of the rock.  There was no banth
there, but something which surprised him infinitely more
than would the presence of twenty banths.
<P>
Before him yawned the mouth of a dark cave leading
downward into the ground.  Through this the banth must
have disappeared.  Was it his lair?  Within its dark and
forbidding interior might there not lurk not one but many
of the fearsome creatures?
<P>
Carthoris did not know, nor, with the thought that had
been spurring him onward upon the trail of the creature
uppermost in his mind, did he much care; for into this
gloomy cavern he was sure the banth had trailed the
green man and his captive, and into it he, too, would
follow, content to give his life in the service of the
woman he loved.
<P>
Not an instant did he hesitate, nor yet did he
advance rashly; but with ready sword and cautious steps,
for the way was dark, he stole on.  As he advanced,
the obscurity became impenetrable blackness.
<P>
