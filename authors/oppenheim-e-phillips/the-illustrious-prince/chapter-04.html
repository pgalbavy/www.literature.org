<P>
It was already a little past the customary luncheon hour at the
Carlton, and the restaurant was well filled. The orchestra had
played their first selection, and the stream of incoming guests
had begun to slacken. A young lady who had been sitting in the
palm court for at least half an hour rose to her feet, and,
glancing casually at her watch, made her way into the hotel. She
entered the office and addressed the chief reception clerk.
<P>
"Can you tell me," she asked, "if Mr. Hamilton Fynes is staying
here? He should have arrived by the Lusitania last night or early
this morning."
<P>
It is not the business of a hotel reception clerk to appear
surprised at anything. Nevertheless the man looked at her, for a
moment, with a curious expression in his eyes.
<P>
"Mr. Hamilton Fynes!" he repeated. "Did you say that you were
expecting him by the Lusitania, madam?"
<P>
"Yes!" the young lady answered. "He asked me to lunch with him
here today. Can you tell me whether he has arrived yet? If he is
in his room, I should be glad if you would send up to him."
<P>
There were several people in the office who were in a position to
overhear their conversation. With a word of apology, the man came
round from his place behind the mahogany counter. He stood by the
side of the young lady, and he seemed to be suffering from some
embarrassment.
<P>
"Will you pardon my asking, madam, if you have seen the
newspapers this morning?" he inquired.
<P>
Without a doubt, her first thought was that the question savored
of impertinence. She looked at him with slightly upraised
eyebrows. She was slim, of medium complexion, with dark brown
hair parted in the middle and waving a little about her temples.
She was irreproachably dressed, from the tips of her patent shoes
to the black feathers in her Paris hat.
<P>
"The newspapers!" she repeated. "Why, no, I don't think that I
have seen them this morning. What have they to do with Mr.
Hamilton Fynes?"
<P>
The clerk pointed to the open door of a small private office.
<P>
"If you will step this way for one moment, madam," he begged.
<P>
She tapped the floor with her foot and looked at him curiously.
Certainly the people around seemed to be taking some interest in
their conversation.
<P>
"Why should I?" she asked. "Cannot you answer my question here?"
<P>
"If madam will be so good," he persisted.
<P>
She shrugged her shoulders and followed him. Something in the
man's earnest tone and almost pleading look convinced her, at
least, of his good intentions. Besides, the interest which her
question had undoubtedly aroused amongst the bystanders was, to
say the least of it, embarrassing. He pulled the door to after
them.
<P>
"Madam," he said, "there was a Mr. Hamilton Fynes who came over
by the Lusitania, and who had certainly engaged rooms in this
hotel, but he unfortunately, it seems, met with an accident on
his way from Liverpool."
<P>
Her manner changed at once. She began to understand what it all
meant. Her lips parted, her eyes were wide open.
<P>
"An accident?" she faltered.
<P>
He gently rolled a chair up to her. She sank obediently into it.
<P>
"Madam," he said, "it was a very bad accident indeed. I trust
that Mr. Hamilton Fynes was not a very intimate friend or a
relative of yours. It would perhaps be better for you to read the
account for yourself."
<P>
He placed a newspaper in her hands. She read the first few lines
and suddenly turned upon him. She was white to the lips now, and
there was real terror in her tone. Yet if he had been in a
position to have analyzed the emotion she displayed, he might
have remarked that there was none of the surprise, the blank,
unbelieving amazement which might have been expected from one
hearing for the first time of such a calamity.
<P>
"Murdered!" she exclaimed. "Is this true?"
<P>
"It appears to be perfectly true, madam, I regret to say," the
clerk answered. "Even the earlier editions were able to supply
the man's name, and I am afraid that there is no doubt about his
identity. The captain of the Lusitania confirmed it, and many of
the passengers who saw him leave the ship last night have been
interviewed."
<P>
"Murdered!" she repeated to herself with trembling lips. "It
seems such a horrible death! Have they any idea who did it?" she
asked. "Has any one been arrested?"
<P>
"At present, no, madam," the clerk answered. "The affair, as you
will see if you read further, is an exceedingly mysterious one."
<P>
She rocked a little in her chair, but she showed no signs of
fainting. She picked up the paper and found the place once more.
There were two columns filled with particulars of the tragedy.
<P>
"Where can I be alone and read this?" she asked.
<P>
"Here, if you please, madam," the clerk answered. "I must go back
to my desk. There are many arrivals just now. Will you allow me
to send you something--a little brandy, perhaps?"
<P>
"Nothing, thank you," she answered. "I wish only to be alone
while I read this."
<P>
He left her with a little sympathetic murmur, and closed the door
behind him. The girl raised her veil now and spread the newspaper
out on the table before her. There was an account of the tragedy;
there were interviews with some of the passengers, a message from
the captain. In all, it seemed that wonderfully little was known
of Mr. Hamilton Fynes. He had spoken to scarcely a soul on board,
and had remained for the greater part of the time in his
stateroom. The captain had not even been aware of his existence
till the moment when Mr. Hamilton Fynes had sought him out and
handed him an order, signed by the head of his company,
instructing him to obey in any respect the wishes of this
hitherto unknown passenger. The tug which had been hired to meet
him had gone down the river, so it was not possible, for the
moment, to say by whom it had been chartered. The station-master
at Liverpool knew nothing except that the letter presented to him
by the dead man was a personal one from a great railway magnate,
whose wishes it was impossible to disregard. There had not been a
soul, apparently, upon the steamer who had known anything worth
mentioning of Mr. Hamilton Fynes or his business. No one in
London had made inquiries for him or claimed his few effects.
Half a dozen cables to America remained unanswered.
<P>
That papers had been stolen from him--papers or money--was
evident from the place of concealment in his coat, where the
lining had been torn away, but there was not the slightest
evidence as to the nature of these documents or the history of
the murdered man. All that could be done was to await the news
from the other side, which was momentarily expected.
<P>
The girl went through it all, line by line, almost word by word.
Whatever there might have been of relationship or friendship
between her and the dead man, the news of his terrible end left
her shaken, indeed, but dry-eyed. She was apparently more
terrified than grieved, and now that the first shock had passed
away, her mind seemed occupied with thoughts which may indeed
have had some connection with this tragedy, but were scarcely
wholly concerned with it. She sat for a long while with her hands
still resting upon the table but her eyes fixed out of the
window. Then at last she rose and made her way outside. Her
friend the reception clerk was engaged in conversation with one
or two men, a conversation of which she was obviously the
subject. As she opened the door, one of them broke off in the
midst of what he was saying and would have accosted her. The
clerk, however, interposed, and drew her a step or two back into
the room.
<P>
"Madam," he said, "one of these gentlemen is from Scotland Yard,
and the others are reporters. They are all eager to know anything
about Mr. Hamilton Fynes. I expect they will want to ask you some
questions."
<P>
The girl opened her lips and closed them again.
<P>
"I regret to say that I have nothing whatever to tell them," she
declared. "Will you kindly let them know that?"
<P>
The clerk shook his head.
<P>
"I am afraid you will find them quite persistent, madam," he
said.
<P>
"I cannot tell them things which I do not know myself," she
answered, frowning.
<P>
"Naturally," the clerk admitted; "yet these gentlemen from
Scotland Yard have special privileged, of course, and there
remains the fact that you were engaged to lunch with Mr. Fynes
here."
<P>
"If it will help me to get rid of them," she said, "I will speak
to the representative of Scotland Yard. I will have nothing
whatever to say to the reporters."
<P>
The clerk turned round and beckoned to the foremost figure in the
little group. Inspector Jacks, tall, lantern-jawed, dressed with
the quiet precision of a well-to-do-man of affairs, and with no
possible suggestion of his calling in his manner or attire, was
by her side almost at once.
<P>
"Madam," he said, "I understand that Mr. Hamilton Fynes was a
friend of yours?"
<P>
"An acquaintance," she corrected him.
<P>
"And your name?" he asked.
<P>
"I am Miss Morse," she replied,--"Miss Penelope Morse."
<P>
"You were to have lunched here with Mr. Hamilton Fynes," the
detective continued. "When, may I ask, did the invitation reach
you?"
<P>
"Yesterday," she told him, "by marconigram from Queenstown."
<P>
"You can tell us a few things about the deceased, without doubt,"
Mr. Jacks said,--"his profession, for instance, or his social
standing? Perhaps you know the reason for his coming to Europe?"
<P>
The girl shook her head.
<P>
"Mr. Fynes and I were not intimately acquainted," she answered.
"We met in Paris some years ago, and when he was last in London,
during the autumn, I lunched with him twice."
<P>
"You had no letter from him, then, previous to the marconigram?"
the inspector asked.
<P>
"I have scarcely ever received a letter from him in my life," she
answered. "He was as bad a correspondent as I am myself."
<P>
"You know nothing, then, of the object of his present visit to
England?"
<P>
"Nothing whatever," she answered.
<P>
"When he was over here before," the inspector asked, "do you know
what his business was then?"
<P>
"Not in the least," she replied.
<P>
"You can tell us his address in the States?" Inspector Jacks
suggested.
<P>
She shook her head.
<P>
"I cannot," she answered. "As I told you just now, I have never
had a letter from him in my life. We exchanged a few notes,
perhaps, when we were in Paris, about trivial matters, but
nothing more than that."
<P>
"He must at some time, in Paris, for instance, or when you
lunched with him last year, have said something about his
profession, or how he spent his time?"
<P>
"He never alluded to it in any way," the girl answered. "I have
not the slightest idea how he passed his time."
<P>
The inspector was a little nonplussed. He did not for a moment
believe that the girl was telling the truth.
<P>
"Perhaps," he said tentatively, "you do not care to have your
name come before the public in connection with a case so
notorious as this?"
<P>
"Naturally," the girl answered. "That, however, would not prevent
my telling you anything that I knew. You seem to find it hard to
believe, but I can assure you that I know nothing. Mr. Fynes was
almost a stranger to me."
<P>
The detective was thoughtful.
<P>
"So you really cannot help us at all, madam?" he said at length.
<P>
"I am afraid not," she answered.
<P>
"Perhaps," he suggested, "after you have thought the matter over,
something may occur to you. Can I trouble you for your address?"
<P>
"I am staying at Devenham House for the moment," she answered.
<P>
He wrote it down in his notebook.
<P>
"I shall perhaps do myself the honor of waiting upon you a little
later on," he said. "You may be able, after reflection, to recall
some small details, at any rate, which will be interesting to us.
At present we are absurdly ignorant as to the man's affairs."
<P>
She turned away from him to the clerk, and pointed to another
door.
<P>
"Can I go out without seeing those others?" she asked. "I really
have nothing to say to them, and this has been quite a shock to
me."
<P>
"By all means, madam," the clerk answered. "If you will allow me,
I will escort you to the entrance."
<P>
Two of the more enterprising of the journalists caught them up
upon the pavement. Miss Penelope Morse, however, had little to
say to them.
<P>
"You must not ask me any more questions about Mr. Hamilton
Fynes," she declared. "My acquaintance with him was of the
slightest. It is true that I came here to lunch today without
knowing what had happened. It has been a shock to me, and I do
not wish to talk about it, and I will not talk about it, for the
present."
<P>
She was deaf to their further questions. The hotel clerk handed
her into a taximeter cab, and gave the address to the driver.
Then he went back to his office, where Inspector Jacks was still
sitting.
<P>
"This Mr. Hamilton Fynes," he remarked, "seems to have been what
you might call a secretive sort of person. Nobody appears to know
anything about him. I remember when he was staying here before
that he had no callers, and seemed to spend most of his time
sitting in the palm court."
<P>
The inspector nodded.
<P>
"He was certainly a man who knew how to keep his own counsel," he
admitted. "Most Americans are ready enough to talk about
themselves and their affairs, even to comparative strangers."
<P>
The hotel clerk nodded.
<P>
"Makes it difficult for you," he remarked.
<P>
"It makes the case very interesting, the inspector declared,
"especially when we find him engaged to lunch with a young lady
of such remarkable discretion as miss Penelope Morse."
<P>
"You know her?" the clerk asked a little eagerly.
<P>
The inspector was engaged, apparently, in studying the pattern of
the carpet.
<P>
"Not exactly," he answered. "No, I have no absolute knowledge of
Miss Penelope Morse. By the bye, that was rather an interesting
address that she gave."
<P>
"Devenham House," the hotel clerk remarked. "Do you know who
lives there?"
<P>
The inspector nodded.
<P>
"The Duke of Devenham," he answered. "A very interesting young
lady, I should think, that. I wonder what she and Mr. Hamilton
Fynes would have talked about if they had lunched here today."
<P>
The hotel clerk looked dubious. He did not grasp the significance
of the question.
