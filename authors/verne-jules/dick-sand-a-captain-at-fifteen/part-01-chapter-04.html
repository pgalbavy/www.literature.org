<p>The slave trade was still carried on, on a large scale, in all
equinoctial Africa. Notwithstanding the English and French cruisers,
ships loaded with slaves leave the coasts of Angola and Mozambique
every year to transport negroes to various parts of the world, and, it
must be said, of the civilized world.</p>

<p>Captain Hull was not ignorant of it. Though these parts were not
ordinarily frequented by slave-ships, he asked himself if these blacks,
whose salvage he had just effected, were not the survivors of a cargo
of slaves that the &quot;Waldeck&quot; was going to sell to some Pacific colony.
At all events, if that was so, the blacks became free again by the sole
act of setting foot on his deck, and he longed to tell it to them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the most earnest care had been lavished on the shipwrecked
men from the &quot;Waldeck.&quot; Mrs. Weldon, aided by Nan and Dick Sand, had
administered to them a little of that good fresh water of which they
must have been deprived for several days, and that, with some
nourishment, sufficed to restore them to life.</p>

<p>The eldest of these blacks - he might be about sixty years old - was soon
able to speak, and he could answer in English the questions which were
addressed to him.</p>

<p>&quot;The ship which carried you was run into?&quot; asked Captain Hull, first of
all.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; replied the old black. &quot;Ten days ago our ship was struck, during
a very dark night. We were asleep -  - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the men of the 'Waldeck' - what has become of them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were no longer there, sir, when my companions and I reached the
deck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, was the crew able to jump on board the ship which struck the
'Waldeck'?&quot; demanded Captain Hull.</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps, and we must indeed hope so for their sakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that ship, after the collision, did it not return to pick you up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did she then go down herself?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She did not founder,&quot; replied the old black, shaking his head, &quot;for we
could see her running away in the night.&quot;</p>

<p>This fact, which was attested by all the survivors of the &quot;Waldeck,&quot;
may appear incredible. It is only too true, however, that captains,
after some terrible collision, due to their imprudence, have often
taken flight without troubling themselves about the unfortunate ones
whom they had put in danger, and without endeavoring to carry
assistance to them.</p>

<p>That drivers do as much and leave to others, on the public way, the
trouble of repairing the misfortune which they have caused, that is
indeed to be condemned. Still, their victims are assured of finding
immediate help. But, that men to men, abandon each other thus at sea,
it is not to be believed, it is a shame!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Hull knew several examples of such inhumanity, and
he was obliged to tell Mrs. Weldon that such facts, monstrous as they
might be, were unhappily not rare.</p>

<p>Then, continuing:</p>

<p>&quot;Whence came the 'Waldeck?'&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;From Melbourne.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you are not slaves?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir!&quot; the old black answered quickly, as he stood up straight. &quot;We
are subjects of the State of Pennsylvania, and citizens of free
America!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My friends,&quot; replied Captain Hull, &quot;believe me that you have not
compromised your liberty in coming on board of the American brig, the
'Pilgrim.'&quot;</p>

<p>In fact, the five blacks which the &quot;Waldeck&quot; carried belonged to the
State of Pennsylvania. The oldest, sold in Africa as a slave at the age
of six years, then brought to the United States, had been freed already
many years ago by the Emancipation Proclamation. As to his companions,
much younger than he, sons of slaves liberated before their birth, they
were born free; no white had ever had the right of property over them.
They did not even speak that &quot;negro&quot; language, which does not use the
article, and only knows the infinitive of the verbs - a language which
has disappeared little by little, indeed, since the anti-slavery war.
These blacks had, then, freely left the United States, and they were
returning to it freely.</p>

<p>As they told Captain Hull, they were engaged as laborers at an
Englishman's who owned a vast mine near Melbourne, in Southern
Australia. There they had passed three years, with great profit to
themselves; their engagement ended, they had wished to return to
America.</p>

<p>They then had embarked on the &quot;Waldeck,&quot; paying their passage like
ordinary passengers. On the 5th of December they left Melbourne, and
seventeen days after, during a very black night, the &quot;Waldeck&quot; had been
struck by a large steamer.</p>

<p>The blacks were in bed. A few seconds after the collision, which was
terrible, they rushed on the deck.</p>

<p>Already the ship's masts had fallen, and the &quot;Waldeck&quot; was lying on the
side; but she would not sink, the water not having invaded the hold
sufficiently to cause it.</p>

<p>As to the captain and crew of the &quot;Waldeck,&quot; all had disappeared,
whether some had been precipitated into the sea, whether others were
caught on the rigging of the colliding ship, which, after the
collision, had fled to return no more.</p>

<p>The five blacks were left alone on board, on a half-capsized hull,
twelve hundred miles from any land.</p>

<p>Then oldest of the negroes was named Tom. His age, as well as his
energetic character, and his experience, often put to the proof during
a long life of labor, made him the natural head of the companions who
were engaged with him.</p>

<p>The other blacks were young men from twenty-five to thirty years old,
whose names were Bat (abbreviation of Bartholomew), son of old Tom,
Austin, Acteon, and Hercules, all four well made and vigorous, and who
would bring a high price in the markets of Central Africa. Even though
they had suffered terribly, one could easily recognize in them
magnificent specimens of that strong race, on which a liberal
education, drawn from the numerous schools of North America, had
already impressed its seal.</p>

<p>Tom and his companions then found themselves alone on the &quot;Waldeck&quot;
after the collision, having no means of raising that inert hull,
without even power to leave it, because the two boats on board had been
shattered in the boarding. They were reduced to waiting for the passage
of a ship, while the wreck drifted little by little under the action of
the currents. This action explained why she had been encountered so far
out of her course, for the &quot;Waldeck,&quot; having left Melbourne, ought to
be found in much lower latitude.</p>

<p>During the ten days which elapsed between the collision and the moment
when the &quot;Pilgrim&quot; arrived in sight of the shipwrecked vessel the five
blacks were sustained by some food which they had found in the office
of the landing-place. But, not being able to penetrate into the
steward's room, which the water entirely covered, they had had no
spirits to quench their thirst, and they had suffered cruelly, the
water casks fastened to the deck having been stove in by the collision.
Since the night before, Tom and his companions, tortured by thirst, had
become unconscious.</p>

<p>Such was the recital which Tom gave, in a few words, to Captain Hull.
There was no reason to doubt the veracity of the old black. His
companions confirmed all that he had said; besides, the facts pleaded
for the poor men.</p>

<p>Another living being, saved on the wreck, would doubtless have spoken
with the same sincerity if it had been gifted with speech.</p>

<p>It was that dog, that the sight of Negoro seemed to affect in such a
disagreeable manner. There was in that some truly inexplicable
antipathy.</p>

<p>Dingo - that was the name of the dog - belonged to that race of mastiffs
which is peculiar to New Holland. It was not in Australia, however,
that the captain of the &quot;Waldeck&quot; had found it. Two years before Dingo,
wandering half dead of hunger, had been met on the western coast of
Africa, near the mouth of the Congo. The captain of the &quot;Waldeck&quot; had
picked up this fine animal, who, being not very sociable, seemed to be
always regretting some old master, from whom he had been violently
separated, and whom it would be impossible to find again in that desert
country. S. V. - those two letters engraved on his collar - were all that
linked this animal to a past, whose mystery one would seek in vain to
solve.</p>

<p>Dingo, a magnificent and robust beast, larger than the dogs of the
Pyrenees, was then a superb specimen of the New Holland variety of
mastiffs. When it stood up, throwing its head back, it equaled the
height of a man. Its agility - its muscular strength, would be
sufficient for one of those animals which without hesitation attack
jaguars and panthers, and do not fear to face a bear. Its long tail of
thick hair, well stocked and stiff like a lion's tail, its general hue
dark fawn-color, was only varied at the nose by some whitish streaks.
This animal, under the influence of anger, might become formidable, and
it will be understood that Negoro was not satisfied with the reception
given him by this vigorous specimen of the canine race.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dingo, if it was not sociable, was not bad. It seemed rather
to be sad. An observation which had been made by old Tom on board the
&quot;Waldeck&quot; was that this dog did not seem to like blacks. It did not
seek to harm them, but certainly it shunned them. May be, on that
African coast where it wandered, it had suffered some bad treatment
from the natives. So, though Tom and his companions were honest men,
Dingo was never drawn toward them. During the ten days that the
shipwrecked dog had passed on the &quot;Waldeck,&quot; it had kept at a distance,
feeding itself, they knew not how, but having also suffered cruelly
from thirst.</p>

<p>Such, then, were the survivors of this wreck, which the first surge of
the sea would submerge. No doubt it would have carried only dead bodies
into the depths of the ocean if the unexpected arrival of the
&quot;Pilgrim,&quot; herself kept back by calms and contrary winds, had not
permitted Captain Hull to do a work of humanity.</p>

<p>This work had only to be completed by bringing back to their country
the shipwrecked men from the &quot;Waldeck,&quot; who, in this shipwreck, had
lost their savings of three years of labor. This is what was going to
be done. The &quot;Pilgrim,&quot; after having effected her unloading at
Valparaiso, would ascend the American coast as far as California. There
Tom and his companions would be well received by James W. Weldon - his
generous wife assured them of it - and they would be provided with all
that would be necessary for them to return to the State of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>These honest men, reassured about the future, had only to thank Mrs.
Weldon and Captain Hull. Certainly they owed them a great deal, and
although they were only poor negroes, perhaps, they did not despair of
some day paying this debt of gratitude.</p>
