<P>
To return to my business affairs. When I was comfortably settled
in the prison, and knew exactly what I owed, I thought it my duty
to my father to give him the first chance of getting me out. His
answer to my letter contained a quotation from Shakespeare on the
subject of thankless children, but no remittance of money. After
that, my only course was to employ a lawyer and be declared a
bankrupt. I was most uncivilly treated, and remanded two or three
times. When everything I possessed had been sold for the benefit
of my creditors, I was reprimanded and let out. It is pleasant to
think that, even then, my faith in myself and in human nature was
still not shaken.
<P>
About ten days before my liberation, I was thunderstruck at
receiving a visit from my sister's mahogany-colored husband, Mr.
Batterbury. When I was respectably settled at home, this
gentleman would not so much as look at me without a frown; and
now, when I was a scamp, in prison, he mercifully and fraternally
came to condole with me on my misfortunes. A little dexterous
questioning disclosed the secret of this prodigious change in our
relations toward each other, and informed me of a family event
which altered my position toward my sister in the most whimsical
manner.
<P>
While I was being removed to the bankruptcy court, my uncle in
the soap and candle trade was being removed to the other world.
His will took no notice of my father or my mother; but he left to
my sister (always supposed to be his favorite in the family) a
most extraordin ary legacy of possible pin-money, in the shape of
a contingent reversion to the sum of three thousand pounds,
payable on the death of Lady Malkinshaw, provided I survived her.
<P>
Whether this document sprang into existence out of any of his
involved money transactions with his mother was more than Mr.
Batterbury could tell. I could ascertain nothing in relation to
it, except that the bequest was accompanied by some cynical
remarks, to the effect that the testator would feel happy if his
legacy were instrumental in reviving the dormant interest of only
one member of Doctor Softly's family in the fortunes of the
hopeful young gentleman who had run away from home. My esteemed
uncle evidently felt that he could not in common decency avoid
doing something for his sister's family; and he had done it
accordingly in the most malicious and mischievous manner. This
was characteristic of him; he was just the man, if he had not
possessed the document before, to have had it drawn out on his
death-bed for the amiable purpose which it was now devoted to
serve.
<P>
Here was a pretty complication! Here was my sister's handsome
legacy made dependent on my outliving my grandmother! This was
diverting enough; but Mr. Batterbury's conduct was more amusing
still.
<P>
The miserly little wretch not only tried to conceal his greedy
desire to save his own pockets by securing the allowance of
pin-money left to his wife, but absolutely persisted in ignoring
the plain fact that his visit to me sprang from the serious
pecuniary interest which he and Annabella now had in the life and
health of your humble servant. I made all the necessary jokes
about the strength of the vital principle in Lady Malkinshaw, and
the broken condition of my own constitution; but he solemnly
abstained from understanding one of them. He resolutely kept up
appearances in the very face of detection; not the faintest shade
of red came over his wicked old mahogany face as he told me how
shocked he and his wife were at my present position, and how
anxious Annabella was that he should not forget to give me her
love. Tenderhearted creature! I had only been in prison six
months when that overwhelming testimony of sisterly affection
came to console me in my captivity. Ministering angel! you shall
get your three thousand pounds. I am fifty years younger than
Lady Malkinshaw, and I will take care of myself, Annabella, for
thy dear sake!
<P>
The next time I saw Mr. Batterbury was on the day when I at last
got my discharge. He was not waiting to see where I was going
next, or what vital risks I was likely to run on the recovery of
my freedom, but to congratulate me, and to give me Annabella's
love. It was a very gratifying attention, and I said as much, in
tones of the deepest feeling.
<P>
"How is dear Lady Malkinshaw?" I asked, when my grateful emotions
had subsided.
<P>
Mr. Batterbury shook his head mournfully. "I regret to say, not
quite so well as her friends could wish," he answered. "The last
time I had the pleasure of seeing her ladyship, she looked so
yellow that if we had been in Jamaica I should have said it was a
case of death in twelve hours. I respectfully endeavored to
impress upon her ladyship the necessity of keeping the functions
of the liver active by daily walking exercise; time, distance,
and pace being regulated with proper regard to her age--you
understand me?--of course, with proper regard to her age."
<P>
"You could not possibly have given her better advice," I said.
"When I saw her, as long as two years ago, Lady Malkinshaw's
favorite delusion was that she was the most active woman of
seventy-five in all England. She used to tumble downstairs two or
three times a week, then, because she never would allow any one
to help her; and could not be brought to believe that she was as
blind as a mole, and as rickety on her legs as a child of a year
old. Now you have encouraged her to take to walking, she will be
more obstinate than ever, and is sure to tumble down daily, out
of doors as well as in. Not even the celebrated Malkinshaw
toughness can last out more than a few weeks of that practice.
Considering the present shattered condition of my constitution,
you couldn't have given her better advice--upon my word of honor,
you couldn't have given her better advice!"
<P>
"I am afraid," said Mr. Batterbury, with a power of face I
envied; "I am afraid, my dear Frank (let me call you Frank), that
I don't quite apprehend your meaning: and we have unfortunately
no time to enter into explanations. Five miles here by a
roundabout way is only half my daily allowance of walking
exercise; five miles back by a roundabout way remain to be now
accomplished. So glad to see you at liberty again! Mind you let
us know where you settle, and take care of yourself; and do
recognize the importance to the whole animal economy of daily
walking exercise--do now! Did I give you Annabella's love? She's
so well. Good-by."
<P>
Away went Mr. Batterbury to finish his walk for the sake of his
health, and away went I to visit my publisher for the sake of my
pocket.
<P>
An unexpected disappointment awaited me. My "Scenes of Modern
Prison Life" had not sold so well as had been anticipated, and my
publisher was gruffly disinclined to speculate in any future
works done in the same style. During the time of my imprisonment,
a new caricaturist had started, with a manner of his own; he had
already formed a new school, and the fickle public were all
running together after him and his disciples. I said to myself:
"This scene in the drama of your life, my friend, has closed in;
you must enter on another, or drop the curtain at once." Of
course I entered on another.
<P>
Taking leave of my publisher, I went to consult an artist-friend
on my future prospects. I supposed myself to be merely on my way
to a change of profession. As destiny ordered it, I was also on
my way to the woman who was not only to be the object of my first
love, but the innocent cause of the great disaster of my life.
<P>
I first saw her in one of the narrow streets leading from
Leicester Square to the Strand. There was something in her face
(dimly visible behind a thick veil) that instantly stopped me as
I passed her. I looked back and hesitated. Her figure was the
perfection of modest grace. I yielded to the impulse of the
moment. In plain words, I did what you would have done, in my
place--I followed her.
<P>
She looked round--discovered me--and instantly quickened her
pace. Reaching the westward end of the Strand, she crossed the
street and suddenly entered a shop.
<P>
I looked through the window, and saw her speak to a respectable
elderly person behind the counter, who darted an indignant look
at me, and at once led my charming stranger into a back office.
For the moment, I was fool enough to feel puzzled; it was out of
my character you will say--but remember, all men are fools when
they first fall in love. After a little while I recovered the use
of my senses. The shop was at the corner of a side street,
leading to the market, since removed to make room for the
railway. "There's a back entrance to the house!" I thought to
myself--and ran down the side street. Too late! the lovely
fugitive had escaped me. Had I lost her forever in the great
world of London? I thought so at the time. Events will show that
I never was more mistaken in my life.
<P>
I was in no humor to call on my friend. It was not until another
day had passed that I sufficiently recovered my composure to see
poverty staring me in the face, and to understand that I had
really no alternative but to ask the good-natured artist to lend
me a helping hand.
<P>
I had heard it darkly whispered that he was something of a
vagabond. But the term is so loosely applied, and it seems so
difficult, after all, to define what a vagabond is, or to strike
the right moral balance between the vagabond work which is boldly
published, and the vagabond work which is reserved for private
circulation only, that I did not feel justified in holding aloof
from my former friend. Accordingly, I renewed our acquaintance,
and told him my present difficulty. He was a sharp man, and he
showed me a way out of it directly.
<P>
"You have a good eye for a likeness," he said; "and you have made
it keep you hitherto. Very well. Make it keep you still. You
can't profitably caricature people's faces any longer--never
mind! go to the other extreme, and flatter them now. Turn
portrait-painter. You shall have the use of this study three days
in the week, for ten shillings a week--sleeping on the hearth-rug
included, if you like. Get your paints, rouse up your friends,
set to work at once. Drawing is of no consequence; painting is of
no consequence; perspective is of no consequence; ideas are of no
consequence. Everything is of no consequence, except catching a
likeness and flattering your sitter--and that you know you can
do."
<P>
I felt that I could; and left him for the nearest colorman's.
<P>
Before I got to the shop, I met Mr. Batterbury taking his walking
exercise. He stopped, shook hands with me affectionately, and
asked where I was going. A wonderful idea struck me. Instead of
answering his question, I asked after Lady Malkinshaw.
<P>
"Don't be alarmed," said Mr. Batterbury; "her ladyship tumbled
downstairs yesterday morning."
<P>
"My dear sir, allow me to congratulate you!"
<P>
"Most fortunately," continued Mr. Batterbury, with a strong
emphasis on the words, and a fixed stare at me; "most
fortunately, the servant had been careless enough to leave a
large bundle of clothes for the wash at the foot of the stairs,
while she went to answer the door. Falling headlong from the
landing, her ladyship pitched (pardon me the expression)--pitched
into the very middle of the bundle. She was a little shaken at
the time, but is reported to be going on charmingly this morning.
Most fortunate, was it not? Seen the papers? Awful news from
Demerara--the yellow fever--"
<P>
"I wish I was at Demerara," I said, in a hollow voice.
<P>
"You! Why?" exclaimed Mr. Batterbury, aghast.
<P>
"I am homeless, friendless, penniless," I went on, getting more
hollow at every word. "All my intellectual instincts tell me that
I could retrieve my position and live respectably in the world,
if I might only try my hand at portrait-painting--the thing of
all others that I am naturally fittest for. But I have nobody to
start me; no sitter to give me a first chance; nothing in my
pocket but three-and-sixpence; and nothing in my mind but a doubt
whether I shall struggle on a little longer, or end it
immediately in the Thames. Don't let me detain you from your
walk, my dear sir. I'm afraid Lady Malkinshaw will outlive me,
after all!"
<P>
"Stop!" cried Mr. Batterbury; his mahogany face actually getting
white with alarm. "Stop! Don't talk in that dreadfully
unprincipled manner--don't, I implore, I insist! You have plenty
of friends--you have me, and your sister. Take to
portrait-painting--think of your family, and take to
portrait-painting!"
<P>
"Where am I to get a sitter?' I inquired, with a gloomy shake of
the head.
<P>
"Me," said Mr. Batterbury, with an effort. "I'll be your first
sitter. As a beginner, and especially to a member of the family,
I suppose your terms will be moderate. Small beginnings--you know
the proverb?" Here he stopped; and a miserly leer puckered up his
mahogany cheeks.
<P>
"I'll do you, life-size, down to your waistcoat, for fifty
pounds," said I.
<P>
Mr. Batterbury winced, and looked about him to the right and
left, as if he wanted to run away. He had five thousand a year,
but he contrived to took, at that moment, as if his utmost income
was five hundred. I walked on a few steps.
<P>
"Surely those terms are rather high to begin with?" he said,
walking after me. "I should have thought five-and-thirty, or
perhaps forty--"
<P>
"A gentleman, sir, cannot condescend to bargain," said I, with
mournful dignity. "Farewell!" I waved my hand, and crossed over
the way.
<P>
"Don't do that!" cried Mr. Batterbury. "I accept. Give me your
address. I'll come tomorrow. Will it include the frame! There!
there! it doesn't include the frame, of course. Where are you
going now? To the colorman? He doesn't live in the Strand, I
hope--or near one of the bridges. Think of Annabella, think of
the family, think of the fifty pounds--an income, a year's income
to a prudent man. Pray, pray be careful, and compose your mind:
promise me, my dear, dear fellow--promise me, on your word of
honor, to compose your mind!"
<P>
I left him still harping on that string, and suffering, I
believe, the only serious attack of mental distress that had ever
affected him in the whole course of his life.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Behold me, then, now starting afresh in the world, in the
character of a portrait-painter; with the payment of my
remuneration from my first sitter depending whimsically on the
life of my grandmother. If you care to know how Lady Malkinshaw's
health got on, and how I succeeded in my new profession, you have
only to follow the further course of these confessions, in the
next chapter.
