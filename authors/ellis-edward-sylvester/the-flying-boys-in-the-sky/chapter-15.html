<p>Like a sensible young man, Harvey Hamilton had made a study of
his itinerary before leaving home. Allowing himself a margin of
several days, he expected to rejoin his friends at the end of
a fortnight. If all went well he would do so earlier, while there
was always the possibility that he might be absent still longer.</p>

<p>He knew that the little town nestling several miles to the left
was Darmore. It was at the base of a spur of the Alleghanies toward
which he had been working his way from the first. His wish was
to pass beyond the thickly settled districts. Nothing palls sooner
upon an aviator than the endless succession of towns, villages,
cultivated sections and monotonous scenery. While there must be
a certain sameness in the expanses of forest there was always
the chance of adventure which a normal youngster craves as he
does his meals when hungry.</p>

<p>Harvey had meditated going to Darmore to renew his supply of
fuel, but recalled that after passing the mountain ridge, another
and larger town lay some miles away in the broad forest valley.
He had enough gasoline to carry him thither and he decided to
make the trip. He followed his general rule of not rising far
above the altitude necessary to clear the tallest trees and elevations.
Thus, viewed far from the rear, the aeroplane suggested that it
was climbing the mountain side by resting upon and sailing over
the billowy sea of foliage.</p>

<p>The summit proper was no more than two or three hundred yards
in height, and having cleared it the young aviator mounted higher
than before in order to secure a comprehensive view of the surrounding
country and learn how correct his impressions were.</p>

<p>He was vastly pleased. Almost in a direct line and not far away
lay Chesterton, a town of several thousand population and in the
midst of a thriving section of the country. He traced the winding
highways, the scattered farm houses, the broad, cultivated fields,
the signs of busy life everywhere, and the enormous wealth of
forest which continued up the farther slope, crowned the top of
the ridge and stretched down the incline beyond.</p>

<p>The noisy motor in the sky and the queer looking object which
seemed to be advancing sideways and at a rapid pace, drew attention
wherever it was seen. Farmers riding over the dusty roads stopped
their teams and stared aloft until they got kinks in their necks;
men and women climbed to the roofs of their houses, as if the
slight decrease of distance would help them, and breathlessly
studied the strange sight, some of the spectators with the aid
of spy-glasses; groups gathered on lawns, porches and in front
of their homes; every window of a passenger train, to say nothing
of the platforms, was wedged with curious observers, while several
white puffs which shot upward from the steam whistle showed that
the engineer was sending out a salutation to the aerial wanderer
who could not hear it. Everybody had read of aeroplanes and seen
pictures of them, but this was the first time the real thing had
sailed into their sea of vision and no picture can stir like the
actuality itself.</p>

<p>Two men, one of them carrying a gun, were walking over the high
road, a little way to the right, and probably two hundred yards
from the aeroplane. They had stopped and were surveying the strange
object overhead. One of them abruptly raised his weapon and the
little faint blue puff showed he had used the machine as his target.
Instead of a shotgun the fellow fired a rifle. It was impossible
of course to hear the report, but the sudden appearance of a small
white spot on the framework of the upper wing, showed where the
bullet had nipped off a splinter. Strange that so many people
cannot observe a curious object without yearning to shoot it.</p>

<p>Harvey looked around at Bohunkus, and by a nod and the expression
of his face asked whether he wished to be set down that he might
properly chastise the scamp. The colored youth shook his head.
He had gone through enough in that line to satisfy him. Harvey
shied off and speedily passed beyond range. The fellow did not
try a second shot.</p>

<p>Thus far the weather had been ideal, but a disagreeable change
threatened. The sun was hidden by clouds, which increased in density
and number, and the air became so chilly that both shivered. Harvey
headed for Chesterton, for it was evident that soon all pleasure
in aerial sailing would be ended for the time.</p>

<p>The approach of the aeroplane roused the usual excitement in
the little country town, and when Harvey descended in an open
space near the collection of houses, half a hundred people rushed
thither to greet and give him whatever help he needed. He aimed
to make a graceful landing so as properly to impress the spectators,
but he got another reminder of the astonishing sensitiveness of
the aeroplane, which must be handled far differently from an automobile.
He was not quick enough in shifting the lever and hit the ground
with so violent a bump that Bohunkus, who was not expecting anything
of the kind, was thrown headlong from his perch and landed in
a sitting posture with so loud a grunt that the onlookers laughed.</p>

<p>"What’s de matter wid yo’?" he asked angrily; "dat’s de right
way to come down in an airyplane. Hab yo’ any ’bjections?"</p>

<p>"It’s the way <em>you</em> land," replied one of the men, "because
you don’t know any better."</p>

<p>Bohunkus would have been glad to make a scathing retort, but
was unable to think of one. So he said in the way of reproof to
his companion:</p>

<p>"De next time yo’s gwine to try to knock a hole fru de airth,
let me know so I can jump."</p>

<p>"It will do you as much good to jump afterward as before. It
looks to me as if a storm is coming, Bunk, and we must get the
machine under shelter."</p>

<p>The pleasant feature about the situation was that the crowd which
had gathered and continued to gather was a friendly one. No one
spoke an ill-natured word and all were eager to help in every
way possible.</p>

<p>When Harvey stood on the ground, facing the group, he asked:</p>

<p>"Are we going to have a rain?"</p>

<p>"<em>He’s</em> the man that’ll tell you all about the weather
for a week to come and hit it every time."</p>

<p>The one who spoke pointed to an old farmer, without coat or waistcoat,
with a ragged straw hat, chin whiskers and bent shoulders, who
was chewing tobacco after the manner of a cow masticating her
cud.</p>

<p>"How is it, Uncle Tommy?" asked the man who had just spoken.</p>

<p>The old fellow, still chewing, looked up at the sky and then
around the heavens, squinting one eye as he carefully studied
the signs.</p>

<p>"It’ll rain like all creation inside of a couple of hours; then
it’ll hold up a little while and bime by start in agin and drizzle
all night."</p>

<p>"How about to-morrow?" asked Harvey.</p>

<p>"It’ll be bright and clear, but a little cooler than to-day."</p>

<p>"Tell the young gentleman how the rest of the week will be,"
insisted his neighbor.</p>

<p>"The next three days will be clear and rayther warmish; I won’t
say anything beyond that this afternoon, but if ye wanter know,
I’ll obleege ye to-morrer when I’ve had a snifter and my breakfast."</p>

<p>"I am much obliged; you have told me what I wanted to know. I
shall need shelter for this aeroplane; can any of you gentlemen
help me?"</p>

<p>There was less difficulty than Harvey anticipated. Chesterton
had a single large hotel or tavern as the townspeople called it,
with the usual rows of sheds for the convenience of countrymen
when they drove in from the neighborhood. With the help of several
bystanders the machine was shoved over the road and through the
alley—where much care was necessary to save the wings from injury—to
the sheds at the rear. There, after some delicate maneuvering,
the machine was worked into the shelter at the corner, where a
fair hangar was secured.</p>

<p>"Here we stay till the weather clears," said Harvey to Bunk,
as they strolled into the hotel to get their dinner, for which
each had a keen appetite.</p>

<p>Where all showed so hospitable a disposition, Harvey felt little
fear of any harm to the aeroplane, though Bohunkus strolled out
once or twice to make sure everything was right. After the meal
the young aviator seated himself in the utility room, as it may
be called. This was connected by a door that was always open with
the bar, and was intended for the convenience of those who wished
something a little less public. It was provided with several chairs,
a round table standing in the middle of the apartment, and had
a sanded floor and a few cheap sporting prints on the walls. A
half dozen men were seated around, most of them with feet elevated
on other chairs or the window sills, while they gossiped of the
affairs of the neighborhood. They showed little interest in Harvey
and Bunk. The former obtained pen, paper and ink from the landlord
and spent a part of the afternoon in writing to his parents and
to brother Dick in the Adirondacks. He named a town in advance
which he expected to reach at the end of a week, as the proper
one to which to address their replies. This duty attended to,
Harvey looked at Bunk, whose cap had fallen on the floor as he
leaned back in his chair and slept. There was no prejudice so
far as yet shown against his race in that section and he was not
annoyed by any one.</p>

<p>Recalling the words of the old weather prophet, Harvey went out
on the long covered porch in front of the hotel. The two hours
had passed and the rain was coming down in torrents. Then, just
as the venerable farmer had said would be the case, it slackened,
with the promise of renewal before nightfall.</p>

<p>"Some of those old fellows can beat the government every time,"
reflected Harvey; "I shall believe Uncle Tommy until I see the
proof of his mistake. Well, I declare!"</p>

<p>It happened at that moment that Harvey Hamilton was the only
person on the porch, where several wooden chairs awaited occupants.
Here and there a man or woman could be seen hurrying along the
sloppy street, all eager to reach home or shelter. The youth’s
exclamation was caused by sight of an unusually tall man, in a
long, flapping linen duster, striding forward on the same side
as the tavern, so that he passed within a dozen paces of where
the astonished youth stared wonderingly at him, for, without his
distinctive attire, the long grizzled beard and glowing black
eyes identified him at once.</p>

<p>"How are you, Professor?" called Harvey; "I’m mighty glad to
see you again."</p>

<p>The individual upon being hailed looked at the young man as if
he had never seen him before, and then, without the slightest
sign of recognition, stalked up the street and out of sight. </p>
