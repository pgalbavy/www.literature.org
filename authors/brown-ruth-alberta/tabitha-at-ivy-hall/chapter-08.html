<p>With the melon resting securely in the cooler at home, Tabitha
felt better, but the weight of her sins was not wholly lifted
yet, and she dreaded to meet the doctor's wife after the encounter
she had had with Jerome the previous day; so the ride through
town to the little brown cottage high on the mountainside overlooking
the "flat" was very silent, and when the doctor lifted her from
the carriage at his door, her eyes wore their frightened look,
so pathetic in one so young. He noted the unchildlike expression
on the thin face and felt her trembling in his arms, but before
he could think of anything cheerful to say, Jerome bounded out
of the house and met her half way up the steps with the impulsive
words,</p>

<p>"I was very rude to you yesterday, Tabitha, and I am truly sorry.
I was <em>all</em> to blame and I should have told Miss Brooks
so. Won't you be friends with me now?"</p>

<p>Sincerity rang in his voice and his face was full of contrition.
Tabitha's resentment was wholly conquered and her last fear vanished.
She gravely extended her hand to meet his and the hatchet was
buried in that handclasp.</p>

<p>"Come now and see Mamma. She's lying down because she has been
awfully sick. That's what we came here for, and she is anxious
to see you."</p>

<p>The next instant Tabitha stood in the presence of a tiny, white-faced
woman with the most wonderful eyes she had ever seen. They shone
like stars but held the warmth of the sun in their glance, and
instinctively the child recognized in this frail invalid a friend.
Without waiting for the formality of an introduction, without
stopping to think of consequences, Tabitha flew to the couch and
dropped down beside it, crying remorsefully,</p>

<p>"I hit him an awful whack right on the nose, and I <em>meant</em>
to. I just itched to thrash him good. If I'd been a boy I reckon
I would have pitched into him. I nearly drowned him in the water-bucket
and wouldn't say I was sorry. I wasn't then, but I am now. Will&mdash;will&mdash;will
you be friends with me after all that?"</p>

<p>"Poor little girl, poor little girl," said the weak voice, as
the thin arms clasped her gently around. "Of course I'll be your
friend. I am sorry Jerome teased you. I am afraid he likes to
plague folks whenever he can, but he doesn't mean to be bad. You
mustn't pay any attention to what he says and he will soon get
tired of tormenting."</p>

<p>"That's just what Mr. Carson said, and I promised I would try
not to get mad, but I forgot. I've got a perfectly terrible temper,
and when it boils up inside of me it just sizzles all over everything
before I can stop it. Why, I even sassed Dad! I thought sure he'd
lick me, but he didn't."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," urged the tender-hearted woman, and Tabitha
poured out her pent-up griefs and longings into those sympathetic
ears with a passion that astonished her listeners.</p>

<p>"I don't know what I'd do without Tom. He's my 'Guardian Angel.'
Did you ever read the book called <em>The Guardian Angel</em>?
The surveyor let me take it. It's about a girl who had almost
as ugly a temper as mine. She didn't have any mother or father.
I've got Dad, but he hates us. I reckon it must be a job to move
us everywhere he wants to go, and it is particularly bad now,
'cause Aunt Maria doesn't like it and she keeps saying she won't
stay. Tom's most grown up now though, and when he gets through
college and has a surveying office of his own, I'm going to keep
house for him. In two more years now he'll be ready to go to Reno
to college. Mr. Carson and the surveyor are helping him with his
lessons, so he doesn't have very much time to teach me any more;
but I am way ahead of Carrie and Nettie and the other girls of
my age and I'm going to learn all I can so's I can help Tom. If
I only had a pretty name, I think I could stand Dad, but it's
awfully trying to have two such things to bother you all the time.
There, now, I didn't mean to say that! Miss Brooks says it is
wicked to talk so, and I made up my mind to forever quit saying
mean things. I guess I am pretty bad, for I do forget so awfully
often&mdash;so very often. 'Awfully' isn't a nice word to use, Miss
Brooks says. Do you know, her first name is Stella and it means
'star.' Isn't that a pretty name? My first name is Tabitha and
it means cat; so I am a double cat, for you see my last name is
Catt, too."</p>

<p>"But, my dear," interrupted the woman gently, "nobody is going
to care what your name is if you are sweet and happy and sunny.
They will like you without ever thinking what the name means."</p>

<p>"Now isn't it funny that two people should think the same way?
Mr. Carson told me all that, but I was afraid he didn't know for
certain, because he isn't a Catt. But then, you aren't a Catt,
either."</p>

<p>"Other people can have bad tempers, dear. I used to get just
terribly angry when I was a little girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You don't look like it now. How did you get over it?" The black
eyes glistened with eagerness and the little face was full of
wistfulness.</p>

<p>"My mother used to talk to me and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I might be better if I had a mother. Aunt Maria doesn't know
how to mother anything."</p>

<p>"I didn't have my mother always, dear, but long after she was
gone, I remembered the things she used to tell me, and they helped
me so much to control my temper."</p>

<p>"What did she say?" she asked curiously.</p>

<p>"Many, many things, Tabitha; too many to think of now. But she
gave me a rule to help me from getting mad, which I have never
forgotten. She told me to count ten when I was angry before I
spoke a word to anyone; and by the time I had counted ten I had
hold of my temper, so it couldn't get away. Sometimes, of course,
I made mistakes and said things I regretted afterwards, and then
my mother taught me to go to the people I had hurt and ask their
forgiveness. It was often very hard to do, but I felt so much
happier afterward, and I have never been sorry for begging a person's
pardon."</p>

<p>"Even if they weren't nice to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, even if they were horrid. I knew I had done my part
and could forget all about the trouble; but if I hadn't told them
I was sorry, then I was unhappy all the time."</p>

<p>Tabitha looked thoughtfully out of the window far across the
desert to the mountains beyond, and finally answered slowly, "Well,
that's worth trying, though being a Catt seems to make everything
different for me. Maybe&mdash;" The noon whistle blew, and the child
leaped to her feet with a startled exclamation. "I must be going
now. Aunt Maria wasn't at home when we took the melon down, and
no one knows where I've gone. Good-by!"</p>

<p>Away she rushed down the mountain path and up the main street
of the town toward home. As she neared the schoolhouse, she saw
through the open window the teacher correcting papers at her desk,
her head bowed low over her work and one hand shading her eyes.</p>

<p>"I was real wicked to her," said Tabitha to herself. "I ought
to tell her how sorry I am&mdash;for I am sorry now."</p>

<p>Impulsively she ran across the yard, threw open the door and
burst into the room.</p>

<p>"Teacher &mdash;Miss Brooks, I was real ugly and wicked yesterday.
He did make me awfully mad when he said such horrid things about
my name, but I oughtn't to have thrown water in his face nor dumped
him in that puddle. He said I did&mdash;but I never saw that part of
it. He says he's sorry and I'll believe him now. Will&mdash;will you
be friends with me again? I forgot my manners when I sassed you.
I didn't mean to. It was real hateful of me to tromp on your toes
and bear down hard on your knee, and I'm ever so sorry. Can you&mdash;forgive
me?"</p>

<p>Oh, but it was hard to say that, and the culprit stood shifting
from one foot to the other in embarrassment and shame with eyes
down-cast and cheeks aflame. There was a quick step on the rough
floor, a strong arm encircled her gently, and for a brief moment
she was held in a close embrace while Miss Brooks whispered tenderly
in her ear. Then they had a long talk &mdash;Tabitha had forgotten
all about the dinner hour&mdash;and when they parted it was with a
better understanding of each other.</p>

<p>"She kissed me," breathed the child in ecstasy as she hurried
up the hill. "That's the first time a lady ever kissed me, except
Mrs. Carson. It is so nice to have friends! And Mrs. Vane is right,
it does feel good when you've told folks you are sorry. I wonder&mdash;there's
Dad &mdash;I sassed him and stole his watermelon. But he's hated
me ever since I was born. I wonder if it would be worth while
to tell him I'm sorry. I wonder if I would be lying if I said
that to him. I wish he was like Carrie's father or Dr. Vane; I
could tell them I was sorry and really feel sorry. Perhaps if
I told him I knew how wicked I was, the sorriness would come later.
I'll try it this time, and if it doesn't work&mdash;well, I needn't
do it again."</p>

<p>With fluttering heart and breathing quickly, she boldly entered
the small kitchen where the rest of the family were just rising
from dinner. The father scowled disapprovingly at her tardiness,
but before he could utter a word of reproof, Tabitha marched up
to him and rapidly began,</p>

<p>"I was real mad at your saying I had been fighting when I hadn't
hit Jerome but once and he had never hit me at all, and I was
madder still when you said I couldn't have any watermelon; so
I stole the whole thing out of the cooler and hid it up among
the rocks, but it got smashed when I dragged it over the stones,
so it wasn't fit to bring back when I began to think it was a
licking this time sure.</p>

<p>"The doctor came along just then and told me maybe if I bought
another melon it would be all right, so I did, borrowing eight
cents of him, for which I must work until I get it paid back.
I think this melon is better than the one you got anyhow, but
if you still think it's got to be a licking, why, I'm ready."</p>

<p>She paused for breath, while he, speechless with astonishment
at this lengthy confession, stared at her with uncomprehending
eyes. Was this Tabitha? What could have happened to bring about
this state of affairs?</p>

<p>"Teacher and Mrs. Vane say it is wicked to get mad and we always
ought to beg folks'&mdash;" she could not say 'forgiveness' to him&mdash;"folks'
pardon when we say or do things we ought not to. I ought not to
have toted that melon off. What are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>She was trembling from head to foot with excitement and nervous
dread, and it seemed to her that he had never looked so formidable
before; but though her heart quaked, she courageously stood her
ground, and waited for him to name her sentence.</p>

<p>"You better eat your dinner and help your aunt clear away the
dishes and do up the other work instead of gadding all over the
neighborhood," he said gruffly to hide his feelings, and taking
his hat, he passed out of the door, leaving a surprised but much
relieved little girl to enjoy a huge slice of watermelon which
she found on her plate.</p>
