<p>I was smoking peacefully in the conservatory of the hotel, when
a bellboy brought me the card of Captain le Vicômte de Cluny.</p>

<p>In due time Monsieur the Viscount himself appeared, elegant,
graceful, smart; black and scarlet uniform glittering with triple-gold
arabesques on sleeve and Képi, spurs chiming with every step.</p>

<p>We chatted amiably for a few moments; then the Captain, standing
very erect and stiff, made me a beautiful bow and delivered the
following remarkable question:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Van Twillaire, I am come to-day according to the American
custom, to beg your permission to pay my addresses to mademoiselle,
your daughter."</p>

<p>I inhaled the smoke of my cigarette in my astonishment. That
was bad for me. After a silence I asked:</p>

<p>"Which daughter?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Dulcima, monsieur."</p>

<p>After another silence I said:</p>

<p>"I will give you an answer to-morrow at this hour."</p>

<p>We bowed to each other, solemnly shook hands, and parted.</p>

<p>I was smoking restlessly in the conservatory of the hotel when
a bellboy brought me the card of Captain le Vicômte de Barsac.</p>

<p>In due time the Vicômte himself appeared, elegant, graceful,
smart; black, scarlet, and white uniform glittering with triple-gold
arabesques on sleeve and Képi, spurs chiming with every step.</p>

<p>We chatted amiably for a few moments; then the Captain, standing
very erect and stiff, made me a beautiful bow and delivered the
following remarkable question:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Van Twillaire, I am come to-day according to the American
custom, to beg your permission to pay my addresses to mademoiselle,
your daughter."</p>

<p>I dropped my cigarette into the empty fireplace.</p>

<p>"Which daughter?" I asked, coldly.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Dulcima, monsieur."</p>

<p>After a silence I said:</p>

<p>"I will give you an answer to-morrow at this hour."</p>

<p>We bowed to each other, solemnly shook hands, and parted.</p>

<p>I was smoking violently in the conservatory of the hotel, when
a bellboy brought me a card of my old friend, Gillian Van Dieman.</p>

<p>In due time Van Dieman appeared, radiant, smiling, faultlessly
groomed.</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "it's about time you came over from Long Island,
isn't it? My daughters expected you last week."</p>

<p>"I know," he said, smiling; "I couldn't get away, Peter. Didn't
Alida explain?"</p>

<p>"Explain what?" I asked.</p>

<p>"About our engagement."</p>

<p>In my amazement I swallowed some smoke that was not wholesome
for me.</p>

<p>"Didn't she tell you she is engaged to marry me?" he asked, laughing.</p>

<p>After a long silence, in which I thought of many things, including
the formal offers of Captains de Barsac and Torchon de Cluny,
I said I had not heard of it, and added sarcastically that I hoped
both he and Alida would pardon my ignorance on any matters which
concerned myself.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know that Alida came over here to buy her trousseau?"
he inquired coolly.</p>

<p>I did not, and I said so.</p>

<p>"Didn't you know about the little plot that she and I laid to
get you to bring her to Paris?" he persisted, much amused.</p>

<p>I glared at him.</p>

<p>"Why, Peter," he said, "when you declared to me in the clubhouse
that nothing could get you to Paris unless, through your own stupidity,
something happened to your pig&#11834;"</p>

<p>I turned on him as red as a beet.</p>

<p>"I know you stole that pig, Van!"</p>

<p>"Yes," he muttered guiltily.</p>

<p>"Then," said I earnestly, "for God's sake let it rest where it
is, and marry Alida whenever you like!"</p>

<p>"With your blessing, Peter?" asked Van Dieman, solemnly.</p>

<p>"With my blessing&mdash;dammit!"</p>

<p>We shook hands in silence.</p>

<p>"Where is Alida?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"In her room, surrounded by thousands of dressmakers, hatmakers,
mantua-makers, furriers, experts in shoes, lingerie, jewelry,
and other inexpensive trifles," said I with satisfaction.</p>

<p>But the infatuated man never winced.</p>

<p>"<em>You</em> will attend to that sort of thing in the future,"
I remarked.</p>

<p>The reckless man grinned in unfeigned delight.</p>

<p>"Come," said I, wearily, "Alida is in for all day with her trousseau.
I've a cab at the door; come on! I was going out to watch the
parade at Longchamps. Now you've got to go with me and tell me
something about this temperamental French army that seems more
numerous in Paris than the civilians."</p>

<p>"What do you want to see soldiers for?" he objected.</p>

<p>"Because," said I, "I had some slight experience with the army
this morning just before you arrived; and I want to take a bird's-eye
view of the whole affair."</p>

<p>"But I&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll return for dinner and then you can see Alida," I added.
"But only in my company. You see we are in France, Van, and she
is the <em>jeune fille</em> of romance."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" he muttered, following me out to the cab.</p>

<p>"We will drive by the Pont Neuf," he suggested. "You know the
proverb?"</p>

<p>"No," said I; "what proverb?"</p>

<p>"The bridegroom who passes by the Pont Neuf will always meet
a priest, a soldier, and a white horse. The priest will bless
his marriage, the soldier will defend it, the white horse will
bear his burdens through life."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, passing the Pont Neuf, we did see a priest,
a soldier, and a white horse. But it is a rare thing not to meet
this combination on the largest, longest, oldest, and busiest
bridge in Paris. All three mascots are as common in Paris as are
English sparrows in the Bois de Boulogne.</p>

<p>I bought a book on the quay, then re-entered the taxi and directed
the driver to take us to the race-course at Longchamps.</p>

<p>Our way led up the Champs Elysées, and, while we whirled along,
Van Dieman very kindly told me as much about the French army as
I now write, and for the accuracy of which I refer to my future
son-in-law.</p>

<p>There are, in permanent garrison in Paris, about thirty thousand
troops stationed. This does not include the famous Republican
Guard corps, which is in reality a sort of municipal gendarmerie,
composed of several battalions of infantry, several squadrons
of gorgeous cavalry, and a world-famous band, which corresponds
in functions to our own Marine Band at Washington.</p>

<p>The barracks of the regular troops are scattered about the city,
and occupy strategic positions as the armouries of our National
Guard are supposed to do. All palaces, museums of importance,
and government buildings are guarded day and night by infantry.
The cavalry guard only their own barracks; the marines, engineers,
and artillery the same.</p>

<p>At night the infantry and cavalry of the Republican Guard post
sentinels at all theatres, balls, and public functions. In front
of the Opera only are the cavalry mounted on their horses, except
when public functions occur at the Elysées or the Hôtel de Ville.</p>

<p>In the dozen great fortresses that surround the walls of Paris,
thousands of fortress artillery are stationed. In the suburbs
and outlying villages artillery and regiments of heavy and light
cavalry have their permanent barracks&mdash;dragoons, cuirassiers,
chasseurs-à-cheval, field batteries, and mounted batteries. At
Saint Cloud are dragoons and remount troopers; at Versailles the
engineers and cuirassiers rule the region; and the entire Department
of the Seine is patrolled by gendarmes, mounted and on foot.</p>

<p>When we reached the beautiful meadow of Longchamps, with its
grand-stand covered with waving flags and the sunshine glowing
on thousands of brilliant parasols, we left the taxi, and found
a place on what a New Yorker would call "the bleachers." The bleachers
were covered with pretty women, so we were not in bad company.
As for the great central stand, where the President of the Republic
sat surrounded by shoals of brilliant officers, it was a mass
of colour from flagstaff to pelouse.</p>

<p>The band of the Republican Guards was thundering out one of Sousa's
marches; the vast green plain glittered with masses of troops.
Suddenly three cannon-shots followed one another in quick order;
the band ended its march with a long double roll of drums; the
Minister of War had arrived.</p>

<p>"They're coming," said Van Dieman. "Look! Here come the Saint-Cyrians.
They lead the march one year, and the Polytechnic leads it the
next. But I wish they could see West Point&mdash;just once."</p>

<p>The cadets from Saint-Cyr came marching past, solid ranks of
scarlet, blue, and silver. They marched pretty well; they ride
better, I am told. After them came the Polytechnic, in black and
red and gold, the queer cocked hats of the cadets forming a quaint
contrast to the toy soldier headgear of the Saint-Cyr soldiers.
Following came battalion after battalion of engineers in sombre
uniforms of red and dark blue, then a bizarre battalion of Turcos
or Algerian Riflemen in turbans and pale blue Turkish uniforms,
then a company of Zouaves in scarlet and white and blue, then
some special corps which was not very remarkable for anything
except the bad fit of its clothing.</p>

<p>After them marched solid columns of line infantry, great endless
masses of dull red and blue, passing steadily until the eye wearied
of the monotony.</p>

<p>Trumpets were sounding now; and suddenly, the superb French artillery
passed at a trot, battery after battery, the six guns and six
caissons of each in mathematically perfect alignment, all the
gunners mounted, and not a man sitting on limber or caisson.</p>

<p>In my excitement I rose and joined the roar of cheers which greeted
the artillerymen as battery after battery passed, six guns abreast.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Van Dieman, laughing. "Look! Here come the cavalry!"</p>

<p>In two long double ranks, ten thousand horsemen were galloping
diagonally across the plain &mdash;Hussars in pale robin's-egg
blue and black and scarlet, Chasseurs-à-cheval in light blue and
silver tunics, Dragoons armed with long lances from which fluttered
a forest of red-and-white pennons, Cuirassiers cased in steel
helmets and corselets&mdash;all coming at a gallop, sweeping on with
the earth shaking under the thunder of forty thousand horses'
hoofs, faster, faster, while in the excitement the vast throng
of spectators leaped up on the benches to see.</p>

<p>There was a rumble, a rolling shock, a blast from a hundred trumpets.
"Halt!"</p>

<p>Then, with the sound of the rushing of an ocean, ten thousand
swords swept from their steel scabbards, and a thundering cheer
shook the very sky: "<em>VIVE LA RÉPUBLIC</em>!"</p>

<p>That evening we dined together at the Hôtel &mdash;Alida, Dulcima,
Van Dieman, and I.</p>

<p>Alida wore a new ring set with a brilliant that matched her shining,
happy eyes. I hoped Van Dieman might appear foolish and ill at
ease, but he did not.</p>

<p>"There is," said he, "a certain rare brand of champagne in the
secret cellars of this famous café. It is pink as a rose in colour,
and drier than a British cigar. It is the only wine, except the
Czar's Tokay, fit to drink to the happiness of the only perfect
woman in the world."</p>

<p>"And her equally perfect sister, father and fiancé," said I.
"So pray order this wonderful wine, Van, and let me note the brand;
for I very much fear that we shall need another bottle at no distant
date."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Dulcima, colouring to her hair.</p>

<p>"Because," said I, "the French army is expected to encamp to-morrow
before this hotel."</p>

<p>"Cavalry or artillery?" she asked faintly.</p>

<p>"Both," said I; "so let us thank Heaven that we escape the infantry,
at least. Alida, my dear, your health, happiness, and long, long
life!"</p>

<p>We drank the toast standing.</p>
