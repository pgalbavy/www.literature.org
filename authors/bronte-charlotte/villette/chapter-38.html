<p>But it is not so for all. What then? His will be done, as done it
surely will be, whether we humble ourselves to resignation or not. The
impulse of creation forwards it; the strength of powers, seen and
unseen, has its fulfilment in charge. Proof of a life to come must be
given. In fire and in blood, if needful, must that proof be written.
In fire and in blood do we trace the record throughout nature. In fire
and in blood does it cross our own experience. Sufferer, faint not
through terror of this burning evidence. Tired wayfarer, gird up thy
loins; look upward, march onward. Pilgrims and brother mourners, join
in friendly company. Dark through the wilderness of this world
stretches the way for most of us: equal and steady be our tread; be
our cross our banner. For staff we have His promise, whose &quot;word is
tried, whose way perfect:&quot; for present hope His providence, &quot;who gives
the shield of salvation, whose gentleness makes great;&quot; for final home
His bosom, who &quot;dwells in the height of Heaven;&quot; for crowning prize a
glory, exceeding and eternal. Let us so run that we may obtain: let us
endure hardness as good soldiers; let us finish our course, and keep
the faith, reliant in the issue to come off more than conquerors: &quot;Art
thou not from everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!&quot;</p>

<p>On a Thursday morning we were all assembled in classe, waiting for the
lesson of literature. The hour was come; we expected the master.</p>

<p>The pupils of the first classe sat very still; the cleanly-written
compositions prepared since the last lesson lay ready before them,
neatly tied with ribbon, waiting to be gathered by the hand of the
Professor as he made his rapid round of the desks. The month was July,
the morning fine, the glass-door stood ajar, through it played a fresh
breeze, and plants, growing at the lintel, waved, bent, looked in,
seeming to whisper tidings.</p>

<p>M. Emanuel was not always quite punctual; we scarcely wondered at his
being a little late, but we wondered when the door at last opened and,
instead of him with his swiftness and his fire, there came quietly
upon us the cautious Madame Beck.</p>

<p>She approached M. Paul's desk; she stood before it; she drew round her
the light shawl covering her shoulders; beginning to speak in low, yet
firm tones, and with a fixed gaze, she said, &quot;This morning there will
be no lesson of literature.&quot;</p>

<p>The second paragraph of her address followed, after about two minutes'
pause.</p>

<p>&quot;It is probable the lessons will be suspended for a week. I shall
require at least that space of time to find an efficient substitute
for M. Emanuel. Meanwhile, it shall be our study to fill the blanks
usefully.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Professor, ladies,&quot; she went on, &quot;intends, if possible, duly to
take leave of you. At the present moment he has not leisure for that
ceremony. He is preparing for a long voyage. A very sudden and urgent
summons of duty calls him to a great distance. He has decided to leave
Europe for an indefinite time. Perhaps he may tell you more himself.
Ladies, instead of the usual lesson with M. Emanuel, you will, this
morning, read English with Mademoiselle Lucy.&quot;</p>

<p>She bent her head courteously, drew closer the folds of her shawl, and
passed from the classe.</p>

<p>A great silence fell: then a murmur went round the room: I believe
some pupils wept.</p>

<p>Some time elapsed. The noise, the whispering, the occasional sobbing
increased. I became conscious of a relaxation of discipline, a sort of
growing disorder, as if my girls felt that vigilance was withdrawn,
and that surveillance had virtually left the classe. Habit and the
sense of duty enabled me to rally quickly, to rise in my usual way, to
speak in my usual tone, to enjoin, and finally to establish quiet. I
made the English reading long and close. I kept them at it the whole
morning. I remember feeling a sentiment of impatience towards the
pupils who sobbed. Indeed, their emotion was not of much value: it was
only an hysteric agitation. I told them so unsparingly. I half
ridiculed them. I was severe. The truth was, I could not do with their
tears, or that gasping sound; I could not bear it. A rather weak-
minded, low-spirited pupil kept it up when the others had done;
relentless necessity obliged and assisted me so to accost her, that
she dared not carry on the demonstration, that she was forced to
conquer the convulsion.</p>

<p>That girl would have had a right to hate me, except that, when school
was over and her companions departing, I ordered her to stay, and when
they were gone, I did what I had never done to one among them before - 
pressed her to my heart and kissed her cheek. But, this impulse
yielded to, I speedily put her out of the classe, for, upon that
poignant strain, she wept more bitterly than ever.</p>

<p>I filled with occupation every minute of that day, and should have
liked to sit up all night if I might have kept a candle burning; the
night, however, proved a bad time, and left bad effects, preparing me
ill for the next day's ordeal of insufferable gossip. Of course this
news fell under general discussion. Some little reserve had
accompanied the first surprise: that soon wore off; every mouth
opened; every tongue wagged; teachers, pupils, the very servants,
mouthed the name of &quot;Emanuel.&quot; He, whose connection with the school
was contemporary with its commencement, thus suddenly to withdraw! All
felt it strange.</p>

<p>They talked so much, so long, so often, that, out of the very
multitude of their words and rumours, grew at last some intelligence.
About the third day I heard it said that he was to sail in a week;
then - that he was bound for the West Indies. I looked at Madame Beck's
face, and into her eyes, for disproof or confirmation of this report;
I perused her all over for information, but no part of her disclosed
more than what was unperturbed and commonplace.</p>

<p>&quot;This secession was an immense loss to her,&quot; she alleged. &quot;She did not
know how she should fill up the vacancy. She was so used to her
kinsman, he had become her right hand; what should she do without him?
She had opposed the step, but M. Paul had convinced her it was his
duty.&quot;</p>

<p>She said all this in public, in classe, at the dinner-table, speaking
audibly to Z&eacute;lie St. Pierre.</p>

<p>&quot;Why was it his duty?&quot; I could have asked her that. I had impulses to
take hold of her suddenly, as she calmly passed me in classe, to
stretch out my hand and grasp her fast, and say, &quot;Stop. Let us hear
the conclusion of the whole matter. <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">Why</span> is it his duty to go
into banishment?&quot; But Madame always addressed some other teacher, and
never looked at me, never seemed conscious I could have a care in the
question.</p>

<p>The week wore on. Nothing more was said about M. Emanuel coming to bid
us good-by; and none seemed anxious for his coming; none questioned
whether or not he would come; none betrayed torment lest he should
depart silent and unseen; incessantly did they talk, and never, in all
their talk, touched on this vital point. As to Madame, she of course
could see him, and say to him as much as she pleased. What should
<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">she</span> care whether or not he appeared in the schoolroom?</p>

<p>The week consumed. We were told that he was going on such a day, that
his destination was &quot;Basseterre in Guadaloupe:&quot; the business which
called him abroad related to a friend's interests, not his own: I
thought as much.</p>

<p>&quot;Basseterre in Guadaloupe.&quot; I had little sleep about this time, but
whenever I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> slumber, it followed infallibly that I was
quickly roused with a start, while the words &quot;Basseterre,&quot;
&quot;Guadaloupe,&quot; seemed pronounced over my pillow, or ran athwart the
darkness round and before me, in zigzag characters of red or violet
light.</p>

<p>For what I felt there was no help, and how could I help feeling? M.
Emanuel had been very kind to me of late days; he had been growing
hourly better and kinder. It was now a month since we had settled the
theological difference, and in all that time there had been no
quarrel. Nor had our peace been the cold daughter of divorce; we had
not lived aloof; he had come oftener, he had talked with me more than
before; he had spent hours with me, with temper soothed, with eye
content, with manner home-like and mild. Kind subjects of conversation
had grown between us; he had inquired into my plans of life, and I had
communicated them; the school project pleased him; he made me repeat
it more than once, though he called it an Alnaschar dream. The jar was
over; the mutual understanding was settling and fixing; feelings of
union and hope made themselves profoundly felt in the heart; affection
and deep esteem and dawning trust had each fastened its bond.</p>

<p>What quiet lessons I had about this time! No more taunts on my
&quot;intellect,&quot; no more menaces of grating public shows! How sweetly, for
the jealous gibe, and the more jealous, half-passionate eulogy, were
substituted a mute, indulgent help, a fond guidance, and a tender
forbearance which forgave but never praised. There were times when he
would sit for many minutes and not speak at all; and when dusk or duty
brought separation, he would leave with words like these, &quot;Il est
doux, le repos! Il est pr&eacute;cieux le calme bonheur!&quot;</p>

<p>One evening, not ten short days since, he joined me whilst walking in
my alley. He took my hand. I looked up in his face. I thought he meant
to arrest my attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Bonne petite amie!&quot; said he, softly; &quot;douce consolatrice!&quot; But
through his touch, and with his words, a new feeling and a strange
thought found a course. Could it be that he was becoming more than
friend or brother? Did his look speak a kindness beyond fraternity or
amity?</p>

<p>His eloquent look had more to say, his hand drew me forward, his
interpreting lips stirred. No. Not now. Here into the twilight alley
broke an interruption: it came dual and ominous: we faced two bodeful
forms - a woman's and a priest's - Madame Beck and P&egrave;re Silas.</p>

<p>The aspect of the latter I shall never forget. On the first impulse it
expressed a Jean-Jacques sensibility, stirred by the signs of
affection just surprised; then, immediately, darkened over it the
jaundice of ecclesiastical jealousy. He spoke to <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">me</span> with
unction. He looked on his pupil with sternness. As to Madame Beck,
she, of course, saw nothing - nothing; though her kinsman retained in
her presence the hand of the heretic foreigner, not suffering
withdrawal, but clasping it close and fast.</p>

<p>Following these incidents, that sudden announcement of departure had
struck me at first as incredible. Indeed, it was only frequent
repetition, and the credence of the hundred and fifty minds round me,
which forced on me its full acceptance. As to that week of suspense,
with its blank, yet burning days, which brought from him no word of
explanation - I remember, but I cannot describe its passage.</p>

<p>The last day broke. Now would he visit us. Now he would come and speak
his farewell, or he would vanish mute, and be seen by us nevermore.</p>

<p>This alternative seemed to be present in the mind of not a living
creature in that school. All rose at the usual hour; all breakfasted
as usual; all, without reference to, or apparent thought of their late
Professor, betook themselves with wonted phlegm to their ordinary
duties.</p>

<p>So oblivious was the house, so tame, so trained its proceedings, so
inexpectant its aspect - I scarce knew how to breathe in an atmosphere
thus stagnant, thus smothering. Would no one lend me a voice? Had no
one a wish, no one a word, no one a prayer to which I could say - Amen?</p>

<p>I had seen them unanimous in demand for the merest trifle - a treat, a
holiday, a lesson's remission; they could not, they <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">would</span> not
now band to besiege Madame Beck, and insist on a last interview with a
Master who had certainly been loved, at least by some - loved as
<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">they</span> could love - but, oh! what <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">is</span> the love of the multitude?</p>

<p>I knew where he lived: I knew where he was to be heard of, or
communicated with; the distance was scarce a stone's-throw: had it
been in the next room - unsummoned, I could make no use of my
knowledge. To follow, to seek out, to remind, to recall - for these
things I had no faculty.</p>

<p>M. Emanuel might have passed within reach of my arm: had he passed
silent and unnoticing, silent and stirless should I have suffered him
to go by.</p>

<p>Morning wasted. Afternoon came, and I thought all was over. My heart
trembled in its place. My blood was troubled in its current. I was
quite sick, and hardly knew how to keep at my post - or do my work. Yet
the little world round me plodded on indifferent; all seemed jocund,
free of care, or fear, or thought: the very pupils who, seven days
since, had wept hysterically at a startling piece of news, appeared
quite to have forgotten the news, its import, and their emotion.</p>

<p>A little before five o'clock, the hour of dismissal, Madame Beck sent
for me to her chamber, to read over and translate some English letter
she had received, and to write for her the answer. Before settling to
this work, I observed that she softly closed the two doors of her
chamber; she even shut and fastened the casement, though it was a hot
day, and free circulation of air was usually regarded by her as
indispensable. Why this precaution? A keen suspicion, an almost fierce
distrust, suggested such question. Did she want to exclude sound? what
sound?</p>

<p>I listened as I had never listened before; I listened like the evening
and winter-wolf, snuffing the snow, scenting prey, and hearing far off
the traveller's tramp. Yet I could both listen and write. About the
middle of the letter I heard - what checked my pen - a tread in the
vestibule. No door-bell had rung; Rosine - acting doubtless by orders - 
had anticipated such r&eacute;veill&eacute;e. Madame saw me halt. She coughed, made
a bustle, spoke louder. The tread had passed on to the classes.</p>

<p>&quot;Proceed,&quot; said Madame; but my hand was fettered, my ear enchained, my
thoughts were carried off captive.</p>

<p>The classes formed another building; the hall parted them from the
dwelling-house: despite distance and partition, I heard the sudden
stir of numbers, a whole division rising at once.</p>

<p>&quot;They are putting away work,&quot; said Madame.</p>

<p>It was indeed the hour to put away work, but why that sudden hush - 
that instant quell of the tumult?</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Madame - I will see what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>And I put down my pen and left her. Left her? No: she would not be
left: powerless to detain me, she rose and followed, close as my
shadow. I turned on the last step of the stair.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you coming, too?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said she; meeting my glance with a peculiar aspect - a look,
clouded, yet resolute.</p>

<p>We proceeded then, not together, but she walked in my steps.</p>

<p>He was come. Entering the first classe, I saw him. There, once more
appeared the form most familiar. I doubt not they had tried to keep
him away, but he was come.</p>

<p>The girls stood in a semicircle; he was passing round, giving his
farewells, pressing each hand, touching with his lips each cheek. This
last ceremony, foreign custom permitted at such a parting - so solemn,
to last so long.</p>

<p>I felt it hard that Madame Beck should dog me thus; following and
watching me close; my neck and shoulder shrunk in fever under her
breath; I became terribly goaded.</p>

<p>He was approaching; the semicircle was almost travelled round; he came
to the last pupil; he turned. But Madame was before me; she had
stepped out suddenly; she seemed to magnify her proportions and
amplify her drapery; she eclipsed me; I was hid. She knew my weakness
and deficiency; she could calculate the degree of moral paralysis - the
total default of self-assertion - with which, in a crisis, I could be
struck. She hastened to her kinsman, she broke upon him volubly, she
mastered his attention, she hurried him to the door - the glass-door
opening on the garden. I think he looked round; could I but have
caught his eye, courage, I think, would have rushed in to aid feeling,
and there would have been a charge, and, perhaps, a rescue; but
already the room was all confusion, the semicircle broken into groups,
my figure was lost among thirty more conspicuous. Madame had her will;
yes, she got him away, and he had not seen me; he thought me absent.
Five o'clock struck, the loud dismissal-bell rang, the school
separated, the room emptied.</p>

<p>There seems, to my memory, an entire darkness and distraction in
some certain minutes I then passed alone - a grief inexpressible over
a loss unendurable. <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">What</span> should I do; oh! <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">what</span> should I do;
when all my life's hope was thus torn by the roots out of my riven,
outraged heart?</p>

<p>What I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">should</span> have done, I know not, when a little child - the
least child in the school - broke with its simplicity and its
unconsciousness into the raging yet silent centre of that inward
conflict.</p>

<p>&quot;Mademoiselle,&quot; lisped the treble voice, &quot;I am to give you that. M.
Paul said I was to seek you all over the house, from the grenier to
the cellar, and when I found you, to give you that.&quot;</p>

<p>And the child delivered a note; the little dove dropped on my knee,
its olive leaf plucked off. I found neither address nor name, only
these words: - </p>

<p>&quot;It was not my intention to take leave of you when I said good-by to
the rest, but I hoped to see you in classe. I was disappointed. The
interview is deferred. Be ready for me. Ere I sail, I must see you at
leisure, and speak with you at length. Be ready; my moments are
numbered, and, just now, monopolized; besides, I have a private
business on hand which I will not share with any, nor communicate - 
even to you. - PAUL.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be ready?&quot; Then it must be this evening: was he not to go on the
morrow? Yes; of that point I was certain. I had seen the date of his
vessel's departure advertised. Oh! <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">I</span> would be ready, but could
that longed-for meeting really be achieved? the time was so short, the
schemers seemed so watchful, so active, so hostile; the way of access
appeared strait as a gully, deep as a chasm - Apollyon straddled across
it, breathing flames. Could my Greatheart overcome? Could my guide
reach me?</p>

<p>Who might tell? Yet I began to take some courage, some comfort; it
seemed to me that I felt a pulse of his heart beating yet true to the
whole throb of mine.</p>

<p>I waited my champion. Apollyon came trailing his Hell behind him. I
think if Eternity held torment, its form would not be fiery rack, nor
its nature despair. I think that on a certain day amongst those days
which never dawned, and will not set, an angel entered Hades - stood,
shone, smiled, delivered a prophecy of conditional pardon, kindled a
doubtful hope of bliss to come, not now, but at a day and hour
unlooked for, revealed in his own glory and grandeur the height and
compass of his promise: spoke thus - then towering, became a star, and
vanished into his own Heaven. His legacy was suspense - a worse boon
than despair.</p>

<p>All that evening I waited, trusting in the dove-sent olive-leaf, yet
in the midst of my trust, terribly fearing. My fear pressed heavy.
Cold and peculiar, I knew it for the partner of a rarely-belied
presentiment. The first hours seemed long and slow; in spirit I clung
to the flying skirts of the last. They passed like drift cloud - like
the wrack scudding before a storm.</p>

<p>They passed. All the long, hot summer day burned away like a Yule-log;
the crimson of its close perished; I was left bent among the cool blue
shades, over the pale and ashen gleams of its night.</p>

<p>Prayers were over; it was bed-time; my co-inmates were all retired. I
still remained in the gloomy first classe, forgetting, or at least
disregarding, rules I had never forgotten or disregarded before.</p>

<p>How long I paced that classe I cannot tell; I must have been afoot
many hours; mechanically had I moved aside benches and desks, and had
made for myself a path down its length. There I walked, and there,
when certain that the whole household were abed, and quite out of
hearing - there, I at last wept. Reliant on Night, confiding in
Solitude, I kept my tears sealed, my sobs chained, no longer; they
heaved my heart; they tore their way. In this house, what grief could
be sacred?</p>

<p>Soon after eleven o'clock - a very late hour in the Rue Fossette - the
door unclosed, quietly but not stealthily; a lamp's flame invaded the
moonlight; Madame Beck entered, with the same composed air, as if
coming on an ordinary occasion, at an ordinary season. Instead of at
once addressing me, she went to her desk, took her keys, and seemed to
seek something: she loitered over this feigned search long, too long.
She was calm, too calm; my mood scarce endured the pretence; driven
beyond common range, two hours since I had left behind me wonted
respects and fears. Led by a touch, and ruled by a word, under usual
circumstances, no yoke could now be borne - no curb obeyed.</p>

<p>&quot;It is more than time for retirement,&quot; said Madame; &quot;the rule of the
house has already been transgressed too long.&quot;</p>

<p>Madame met no answer: I did not check my walk; when she came in my
way, I put her out of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Let me persuade you to calm, Meess; let me lead you to your chamber,&quot;
said she, trying to speak softly.</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; I said; &quot;neither you nor another shall persuade or lead me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your bed shall be warmed. Goton is sitting up still. She shall make
you comfortable: she shall give you a sedative.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Madame,&quot; I broke out, &quot;you are a sensualist. Under all your serenity,
your peace, and your decorum, you are an undenied sensualist. Make
your own bed warm and soft; take sedatives and meats, and drinks
spiced and sweet, as much as you will. If you have any sorrow or
disappointment - and, perhaps, you have - nay, I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">know</span> you have - 
seek your own palliatives, in your own chosen resources. Leave me,
however. <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">Leave me</span>, I say!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I must send another to watch you, Meess: I must send Goton.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I forbid it. Let me alone. Keep your hand off me, and my life, and my
troubles. Oh, Madame! in <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">your</span> hand there is both chill and
poison. You envenom and you paralyze.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What have I done, Meess? You must not marry Paul. He cannot marry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dog in the manger!&quot; I said: for I knew she secretly wanted him, and
had always wanted him. She called him &quot;insupportable:&quot; she railed at
him for a &quot;d&eacute;vot:&quot; she did not love, but she wanted to marry, that she
might bind him to her interest. Deep into some of Madame's secrets I
had entered - I know not how: by an intuition or an inspiration which
came to me - I know not whence. In the course of living with her too, I
had slowly learned, that, unless with an inferior, she must ever be a
rival. She was <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> rival, heart and soul, though secretly, under
the smoothest bearing, and utterly unknown to all save her and myself.</p>

<p>Two minutes I stood over Madame, feeling that the whole woman was in
my power, because in some moods, such as the present - in some
stimulated states of perception, like that of this instant - her
habitual disguise, her mask and her domino, were to me a mere network
reticulated with holes; and I saw underneath a being heartless, self-
indulgent, and ignoble. She quietly retreated from me: meek and self-
possessed, though very uneasy, she said, &quot;If I would not be persuaded
to take rest, she must reluctantly leave me.&quot; Which she did
incontinent, perhaps even more glad to get away, than I was to see her
vanish.</p>

<p>This was the sole flash-eliciting, truth-extorting, rencontre which
ever occurred between me and Madame Beck: this short night-scene was
never repeated. It did not one whit change her manner to me. I do not
know that she revenged it. I do not know that she hated me the worse
for my fell candour. I think she bucklered herself with the secret
philosophy of her strong mind, and resolved to forget what it irked
her to remember. I know that to the end of our mutual lives there
occurred no repetition of, no allusion to, that fiery passage.</p>

<p>That night passed: all nights - even the starless night before
dissolution - must wear away. About six o'clock, the hour which called
up the household, I went out to the court, and washed my face in its
cold, fresh well-water. Entering by the carr&eacute;, a piece of mirror-
glass, set in an oaken cabinet, repeated my image. It said I was
changed: my cheeks and lips were sodden white, my eyes were glassy,
and my eyelids swollen and purple.</p>

<p>On rejoining my companions, I knew they all looked at me - my heart
seemed discovered to them: I believed myself self-betrayed. Hideously
certain did it seem that the very youngest of the school must guess
why and for whom I despaired.</p>

<p>&quot;Isabelle,&quot; the child whom I had once nursed in sickness, approached
me. Would she, too, mock me!</p>

<p>&quot;Que vous &ecirc;tes p&acirc;le! Vous &ecirc;tes donc bien malade, Mademoiselle!&quot; said
she, putting her finger in her mouth, and staring with a wistful
stupidity which at the moment seemed to me more beautiful than the
keenest intelligence.</p>

<p>Isabelle did not long stand alone in the recommendation of ignorance:
before the day was over, I gathered cause of gratitude towards the
whole blind household. The multitude have something else to do than to
read hearts and interpret dark sayings. Who wills, may keep his own
counsel - be his own secret's sovereign. In the course of that day,
proof met me on proof, not only that the cause of my present sorrow
was unguessed, but that my whole inner life for the last six months,
was still mine only. It was not known - it had not been noted - that I
held in peculiar value one life among all lives. Gossip had passed me
by; curiosity had looked me over; both subtle influences, hovering
always round, had never become centred upon me. A given organization
may live in a full fever-hospital, and escape typhus. M. Emanuel had
come and gone: I had been taught and sought; in season and out of
season he had called me, and I had obeyed him: &quot;M. Paul wants Miss
Lucy&quot; - &quot;Miss Lucy is with M. Paul&quot; - such had been the perpetual
bulletin; and nobody commented, far less condemned. Nobody hinted,
nobody jested. Madame Beck read the riddle: none else resolved it.
What I now suffered was called illness - a headache: I accepted the
baptism.</p>

<p>But what bodily illness was ever like this pain? This certainty that
he was gone without a farewell - this cruel conviction that fate and
pursuing furies - a woman's envy and a priest's bigotry - would suffer
me to see him no more? What wonder that the second evening found me
like the first - untamed, tortured, again pacing a solitary room in an
unalterable passion of silent desolation?</p>

<p>Madame Beck did not herself summon me to bed that night - she did not
come near me: she sent Ginevra Fanshawe - a more efficient agent for
the purpose she could not have employed. Ginevra's first words - &quot;Is
your headache very bad to-night?&quot; (for Ginevra, like the rest, thought
I had a headache - an intolerable headache which made me frightfully
white in the face, and insanely restless in the foot) - her first
words, I say, inspired the impulse to flee anywhere, so that it were
only out of reach. And soon, what followed - plaints about her own
headaches - completed the business.</p>

<p>I went up-stairs. Presently I was in my bed - my miserable bed - haunted
with quick scorpions. I had not been laid down five minutes, when
another emissary arrived: Goton came, bringing me something to drink.
I was consumed with thirst - I drank eagerly; the beverage was sweet,
but I tasted a drug.</p>

<p>&quot;Madame says it will make you sleep, chou-chou,&quot; said Goton, as she
received back the emptied cup.</p>

<p>Ah! the sedative had been administered. In fact, they had given me a
strong opiate. I was to be held quiet for one night.</p>

<p>The household came to bed, the night-light was lit, the dormitory
hushed. Sleep soon reigned: over those pillows, sleep won an easy
supremacy: contented sovereign over heads and hearts which did not
ache - he passed by the unquiet.</p>

<p>The drug wrought. I know not whether Madame had overcharged or under-
charged the dose; its result was not that she intended. Instead of
stupor, came excitement. I became alive to new thought - to reverie
peculiar in colouring. A gathering call ran among the faculties, their
bugles sang, their trumpets rang an untimely summons. Imagination was
roused from her rest, and she came forth impetuous and venturous. With
scorn she looked on Matter, her mate - &quot;Rise!&quot; she said. &quot;Sluggard!
this night I will have <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">my</span> will; nor shalt thou prevail.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Look forth and view the night!&quot; was her cry; and when I lifted the
heavy blind from the casement close at hand - with her own royal
gesture, she showed me a moon supreme, in an element deep and
splendid.</p>

<p>To my gasping senses she made the glimmering gloom, the narrow limits,
the oppressive heat of the dormitory, intolerable. She lured me to
leave this den and follow her forth into dew, coolness, and glory.</p>

<p>She brought upon me a strange vision of Villette at midnight.
Especially she showed the park, the summer-park, with its long alleys
all silent, lone and safe; among these lay a huge stone basin - that
basin I knew, and beside which I had often stood - deep-set in the
tree-shadows, brimming with cool water, clear, with a green, leafy,
rushy bed. What of all this? The park-gates were shut up, locked,
sentinelled: the place could not be entered.</p>

<p>Could it not? A point worth considering; and while revolving it, I
mechanically dressed. Utterly incapable of sleeping or lying still - 
excited from head to foot - what could I do better than dress?</p>

<p>The gates were locked, soldiers set before them: was there, then, no
admission to the park?</p>

<p>The other day, in walking past, I had seen, without then attending to
the circumstance, a gap in the paling - one stake broken down: I now
saw this gap again in recollection - saw it very plainly - the narrow,
irregular aperture visible between the stems of the lindens, planted
orderly as a colonnade. A man could not have made his way through that
aperture, nor could a stout woman, perhaps not Madame Beck; but I
thought I might: I fancied I should like to try, and once within, at
this hour the whole park would be mine - the moonlight, midnight park!</p>

<p>How soundly the dormitory slept! What deep slumbers! What quiet
breathing! How very still the whole large house! What was the time? I
felt restless to know. There stood a clock in the classe below: what
hindered me from venturing down to consult it? By such a moon, its
large white face and jet black figures must be vividly distinct.</p>

<p>As for hindrance to this step, there offered not so much as a creaking
hinge or a clicking latch. On these hot July nights, close air could
not be tolerated, and the chamber-door stood wide open. Will the
dormitory-planks sustain my tread untraitorous? Yes. I know wherever a
board is loose, and will avoid it. The oak staircase creaks somewhat
as I descend, but not much: - I am in the carr&eacute;.</p>

<p>The great classe-doors are close shut: they are bolted. On the other
hand, the entrance to the corridor stands open. The classes seem to my
thought, great dreary jails, buried far back beyond thoroughfares, and
for me, filled with spectral and intolerable Memories, laid miserable
amongst their straw and their manacles. The corridor offers a cheerful
vista, leading to the high vestibule which opens direct upon the
street.</p>

<p>Hush! - the clock strikes. Ghostly deep as is the stillness of this
convent, it is only eleven. While my ear follows to silence the hum of
the last stroke, I catch faintly from the built-out capital, a sound
like bells or like a band - a sound where sweetness, where victory,
where mourning blend. Oh, to approach this music nearer, to listen to
it alone by the rushy basin! Let me go - oh, let me go! What hinders,
what does not aid freedom?</p>

<p>There, in the corridor, hangs my garden-costume, my large hat, my
shawl. There is no lock on the huge, heavy, porte-coch&egrave;re; there is no
key to seek: it fastens with a sort of spring-bolt, not to be opened
from the outside, but which, from within, may be noiselessly
withdrawn. Can I manage it? It yields to my hand, yields with
propitious facility. I wonder as that portal seems almost
spontaneously to unclose - I wonder as I cross the threshold and step
on the paved street, wonder at the strange ease with which this prison
has been forced. It seems as if I had been pioneered invisibly, as if
some dissolving force had gone before me: for myself, I have scarce
made an effort.</p>

<p>Quiet Rue Fossette! I find on this pavement that wanderer-wooing
summer night of which I mused; I see its moon over me; I feel its dew
in the air. But here I cannot stay; I am still too near old haunts: so
close under the dungeon, I can hear the prisoners moan. This solemn
peace is not what I seek, it is not what I can bear: to me the face of
that sky bears the aspect of a world's death. The park also will be
calm - I know, a mortal serenity prevails everywhere - yet let me seek
the park.</p>

<p>I took a route well known, and went up towards the palatial and royal
Haute-Ville; thence the music I had heard certainly floated; it was
hushed now, but it might re-waken. I went on: neither band nor bell
music came to meet me; another sound replaced it, a sound like a
strong tide, a great flow, deepening as I proceeded. Light broke,
movement gathered, chimes pealed - to what was I coming? Entering on
the level of a Grande Place, I found myself, with the suddenness of
magic, plunged amidst a gay, living, joyous crowd.</p>

<p>Villette is one blaze, one broad illumination; the whole world seems
abroad; moonlight and heaven are banished: the town, by her own
flambeaux, beholds her own splendour - gay dresses, grand equipages,
fine horses and gallant riders throng the bright streets. I see even
scores of masks. It is a strange scene, stranger than dreams. But
where is the park? - I ought to be near it. In the midst of this glare
the park must be shadowy and calm - <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">there</span>, at least, are neither
torches, lamps, nor crowd?</p>

<p>I was asking this question when an open carriage passed me filled with
known faces. Through the deep throng it could pass but slowly; the
spirited horses fretted in their curbed ardour. I saw the occupants of
that carriage well: me they could not see, or, at least, not know,
folded close in my large shawl, screened with my straw hat (in that
motley crowd no dress was noticeably strange). I saw the Count de
Bassompierre; I saw my godmother, handsomely apparelled, comely and
cheerful; I saw, too, Paulina Mary, compassed with the triple halo of
her beauty, her youth, and her happiness. In looking on her
countenance of joy, and eyes of festal light, one scarce remembered to
note the gala elegance of what she wore; I know only that the drapery
floating about her was all white and light and bridal; seated opposite
to her I saw Graham Bretton; it was in looking up at him her aspect
had caught its lustre - the light repeated in <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">her</span> eyes beamed
first out of his.</p>

<p>It gave me strange pleasure to follow these friends viewlessly, and I
<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">did</span> follow them, as I thought, to the park. I watched them
alight (carriages were inadmissible) amidst new and unanticipated
splendours. Lo! the iron gateway, between the stone columns, was
spanned by a flaming arch built of massed stars; and, following them
cautiously beneath that arch, where were they, and where was I?</p>

<p>In a land of enchantment, a garden most gorgeous, a plain sprinkled
with coloured meteors, a forest with sparks of purple and ruby and
golden fire gemming the foliage; a region, not of trees and shadow,
but of strangest architectural wealth - of altar and of temple, of
pyramid, obelisk, and sphinx: incredible to say, the wonders and the
symbols of Egypt teemed throughout the park of Villette.</p>

<p>No matter that in five minutes the secret was mine - the key of the
mystery picked up, and its illusion unveiled - no matter that I quickly
recognised the material of these solemn fragments - the timber, the
paint, and the pasteboard - these inevitable discoveries failed to
quite destroy the charm, or undermine the marvel of that night. No
matter that I now seized the explanation of the whole great f&ecirc;te - a
f&ecirc;te of which the conventual Rue Fossette had not tasted, though it
had opened at dawn that morning, and was still in full vigour near
midnight.</p>

<p>In past days there had been, said history, an awful crisis in the fate
of Labassecour, involving I know not what peril to the rights and
liberties of her gallant citizens. Rumours of wars there had been, if
not wars themselves; a kind of struggling in the streets - a bustle - a
running to and fro, some rearing of barricades, some burgher-rioting,
some calling out of troops, much interchange of brickbats, and even a
little of shot. Tradition held that patriots had fallen: in the old
Basse-Ville was shown an enclosure, solemnly built in and set apart,
holding, it was said, the sacred bones of martyrs. Be this as it may,
a certain day in the year was still kept as a festival in honour of
the said patriots and martyrs of somewhat apocryphal memory - the
morning being given to a solemn Te Deum in St. Jean Baptiste, the
evening devoted to spectacles, decorations, and illuminations, such as
these I now saw.</p>

<p>While looking up at the image of a white ibis, fixed on a column - 
while fathoming the deep, torch-lit perspective of an avenue, at the
close of which was couched a sphinx - I lost sight of the party which,
from the middle of the great square, I had followed - or, rather, they
vanished like a group of apparitions. On this whole scene was
impressed a dream-like character: every shape was wavering, every
movement floating, every voice echo-like - half-mocking, half-
uncertain. Paulina and her friends being gone, I scarce could avouch
that I had really seen them; nor did I miss them as guides through the
chaos, far less regret them as protectors amidst the night.</p>

<p>That festal night would have been safe for a very child. Half the
peasantry had come in from the outlying environs of Villette, and the
decent burghers were all abroad and around, dressed in their best. My
straw-hat passed amidst cap and jacket, short petticoat, and long
calico mantle, without, perhaps, attracting a glance; I only took the
precaution to bind down the broad leaf gipsy-wise, with a
supplementary ribbon - and then I felt safe as if masked.</p>

<p>Safe I passed down the avenues - safe I mixed with the crowd where it
was deepest. To be still was not in my power, nor quietly to observe.
I took a revel of the scene; I drank the elastic night-air - the swell
of sound, the dubious light, now flashing, now fading. As to Happiness
or Hope, they and I had shaken hands, but just now - I scorned Despair.</p>

<p>My vague aim, as I went, was to find the stone-basin, with its clear
depth and green lining: of that coolness and verdure I thought, with
the passionate thirst of unconscious fever. Amidst the glare, and
hurry, and throng, and noise, I still secretly and chiefly longed to
come on that circular mirror of crystal, and surprise the moon
glassing therein her pearly front.</p>

<p>I knew my route, yet it seemed as if I was hindered from pursuing it
direct: now a sight, and now a sound, called me aside, luring me down
this alley and down that. Already I saw the thick-planted trees which
framed this tremulous and rippled glass, when, choiring out of a glade
to the right, broke such a sound as I thought might be heard if Heaven
were to open - such a sound, perhaps, as <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> heard above the
plain of Bethlehem, on the night of glad tidings.</p>

<p>The song, the sweet music, rose afar, but rushing swiftly on fast-
strengthening pinions - there swept through these shades so full a
storm of harmonies that, had no tree been near against which to lean,
I think I must have dropped. Voices were there, it seemed to me,
unnumbered; instruments varied and countless - bugle, horn, and trumpet
I knew. The effect was as a sea breaking into song with all its waves.</p>

<p>The swaying tide swept this way, and then it fell back, and I followed
its retreat. It led me towards a Byzantine building - a sort of kiosk
near the park's centre. Round about stood crowded thousands, gathered
to a grand concert in the open air. What I had heard was, I think, a
wild J&auml;ger chorus; the night, the space, the scene, and my own mood,
had but enhanced the sounds and their impression.</p>

<p>Here were assembled ladies, looking by this light most beautiful: some
of their dresses were gauzy, and some had the sheen of satin, the
flowers and the blond trembled, and the veils waved about their
decorated bonnets, as that host-like chorus, with its greatly-
gathering sound, sundered the air above them. Most of these ladies
occupied the little light park-chairs, and behind and beside them
stood guardian gentlemen. The outer ranks of the crowd were made up of
citizens, plebeians and police.</p>

<p>In this outer rank I took my place. I rather liked to find myself the
silent, unknown, consequently unaccosted neighbour of the short
petticoat and the sabot; and only the distant gazer at the silk robe,
the velvet mantle, and the plumed chapeau. Amidst so much life and
joy, too, it suited me to be alone - quite alone. Having neither wish
nor power to force my way through a mass so close-packed, my station
was on the farthest confines, where, indeed, I might hear, but could
see little.</p>

<p>&quot;Mademoiselle is not well placed,&quot; said a voice at my elbow. Who dared
accost <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">me</span>, a being in a mood so little social? I turned, rather
to repel than to reply. I saw a man - a burgher - an entire stranger, as
I deemed him for one moment, but the next, recognised in him a certain
tradesman - a bookseller, whose shop furnished the Rue Fossette with
its books and stationery; a man notorious in our pensionnat for the
excessive brittleness of his temper, and frequent snappishness of his
manner, even to us, his principal customers: but whom, for my solitary
self, I had ever been disposed to like, and had always found civil,
sometimes kind; once, in aiding me about some troublesome little
exchange of foreign money, he had done me a service. He was an
intelligent man; under his asperity, he was a good-hearted man; the
thought had sometimes crossed me, that a part of his nature bore
affinity to a part of M. Emanuel's (whom he knew well, and whom I had
often seen sitting on Miret's counter, turning over the current
month's publications); and it was in this affinity I read the
explanation of that conciliatory feeling with which I instinctively
regarded him.</p>

<p>Strange to say, this man knew me under my straw-hat and closely-folded
shawl; and, though I deprecated the effort, he insisted on making a
way for me through the crowd, and finding me a better situation. He
carried his disinterested civility further; and, from some quarter,
procured me a chair. Once and again, I have found that the most cross-
grained are by no means the worst of mankind; nor the humblest in
station, the least polished in feeling. This man, in his courtesy,
seemed to find nothing strange in my being here alone; only a reason
for extending to me, as far as he could, a retiring, yet efficient
attention. Having secured me a place and a seat, he withdrew without
asking a question, without obtruding a remark, without adding a
superfluous word. No wonder that Professor Emanuel liked to take his
cigar and his lounge, and to read his feuilleton in M. Miret's shop - 
the two must have suited.</p>

<p>I had not been seated five minutes, ere I became aware that chance and
my worthy burgher friend had brought me once more within view of a
familiar and domestic group. Right before me sat the Brettons and de
Bassompierres. Within reach of my hand - had I chosen to extend it - sat
a figure like a fairy-queen, whose array, lilies and their leaves
seemed to have suggested; whatever was not spotless white, being
forest-green. My godmother, too, sat so near, that, had I leaned
forward, my breath might have stirred the ribbon of her bonnet. They
were too near; having been just recognised by a comparative stranger,
I felt uneasy at this close vicinage of intimate acquaintance.</p>

<p>It made me quite start when Mrs. Bretton, turning to Mr. Home, and
speaking out of a kind impulse of memory, said, - &quot;I wonder what my
steady little Lucy would say to all this if she were here? I wish we
had brought her, she would have enjoyed it much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So she would, so she would, in her grave sensible fashion; it is a
pity but we had asked her,&quot; rejoined the kind gentleman; and added, &quot;I
like to see her so quietly pleased; so little moved, yet so content.&quot;</p>

<p>Dear were they both to me, dear are they to this day in their
remembered benevolence. Little knew they the rack of pain which had
driven Lucy almost into fever, and brought her out, guideless and
reckless, urged and drugged to the brink of frenzy. I had half a mind
to bend over the elders' shoulders, and answer their goodness with the
thanks of my eyes. M. de Bassompierre did not well know <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">me</span>, but
I knew <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">him</span>, and honoured and admired his nature, with all its
plain sincerity, its warm affection, and unconscious enthusiasm.
Possibly I might have spoken, but just then Graham turned; he turned
with one of his stately firm movements, so different from those, of a
sharp-tempered under-sized man: there was behind him a throng, a
hundred ranks deep; there were thousands to meet his eye and divide
its scrutiny - why then did he concentrate all on me - oppressing me
with the whole force of that full, blue, steadfast orb? Why, if he
<span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">would</span> look, did not one glance satisfy him? why did he turn on
his chair, rest his elbow on its back, and study me leisurely? He
could not see my face, I held it down; surely, he <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">could</span> not
recognise me: I stooped, I turned, I <span class="hft-underline" style="text-decoration: underline">would</span> not be known. He
rose, by some means he contrived to approach, in two minutes he would
have had my secret: my identity would have been grasped between his,
never tyrannous, but always powerful hands. There was but one way to
evade or to check him. I implied, by a sort of supplicatory gesture,
that it was my prayer to be let alone; after that, had he persisted,
he would perhaps have seen the spectacle of Lucy incensed: not all
that was grand, or good, or kind in him (and Lucy felt the full
amount) should have kept her quite tame, or absolutely inoffensive and
shadowlike. He looked, but he desisted. He shook his handsome head,
but he was mute. He resumed his seat, nor did he again turn or disturb
me by a glance, except indeed for one single instant, when a look,
rather solicitous than curious, stole my way - speaking what somehow
stilled my heart like &quot;the south-wind quieting the earth.&quot; Graham's
thoughts of me were not entirely those of a frozen indifference, after
all. I believe in that goodly mansion, his heart, he kept one little
place under the sky-lights where Lucy might have entertainment, if she
chose to call. It was not so handsome as the chambers where he lodged
his male friends; it was not like the hall where he accommodated his
philanthropy, or the library where he treasured his science, still
less did it resemble the pavilion where his marriage feast was
splendidly spread; yet, gradually, by long and equal kindness, he
proved to me that he kept one little closet, over the door of which
was written &quot;Lucy's Room.&quot; I kept a place for him, too - a place of
which I never took the measure, either by rule or compass: I think it
was like the tent of Peri-Banou. All my life long I carried it folded
in the hollow of my hand yet, released from that hold and
constriction, I know not but its innate capacity for expanse might
have magnified it into a tabernacle for a host.</p>

<p>Forbearing as he was to-night, I could not stay in this proximity;
this dangerous place and seat must be given up: I watched my
opportunity, rose, and stole away. He might think, he might even
believe that Lucy was contained within that shawl, and sheltered under
that hat; he never could be certain, for he did not see my face.</p>

<p>Surely the spirit of restlessness was by this time appeased? Had I not
had enough of adventure? Did I not begin to flag, quail, and wish for
safety under a roof? Not so. I still loathed my bed in the school
dormitory more than words can express: I clung to whatever could
distract thought. Somehow I felt, too, that the night's drama was but
begun, that the prologue was scarce spoken: throughout this woody and
turfy theatre reigned a shadow of mystery; actors and incidents
unlooked-for, waited behind the scenes: I thought so foreboding told
me as much.</p>

<p>Straying at random, obeying the push of every chance elbow, I was
brought to a quarter where trees planted in clusters, or towering
singly, broke up somewhat the dense packing of the crowd, and gave it
a more scattered character. These confines were far from the music,
and somewhat aloof even from the lamps, but there was sound enough to
soothe, and with that full, high moon, lamps were scarce needed. Here
had chiefly settled family-groups, burgher-parents; some of them, late
as was the hour, actually surrounded by their children, with whom it
had not been thought advisable to venture into the closer throng.</p>

<p>Three fine tall trees growing close, almost twined stem within stem,
lifted a thick canopy of shade above a green knoll, crowned with a
seat - a seat which might have held several, yet it seemed abandoned to
one, the remaining members of the fortunate party in possession of
this site standing dutifully round; yet, amongst this reverend circle
was a lady, holding by the hand a little girl.</p>

<p>When I caught sight of this little girl, she was twisting herself
round on her heel, swinging from her conductress's hand, flinging
herself from side to side with wanton and fantastic gyrations. These
perverse movements arrested my attention, they struck me as of a
character fearfully familiar. On close inspection, no less so appeared
the child's equipment; the lilac silk pelisse, the small swansdown
boa, the white bonnet - the whole holiday toilette, in short, was the
gala garb of a cherub but too well known, of that tadpole, D&eacute;sir&eacute;e
Beck - and D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Beck it was - she, or an imp in her likeness.</p>

<p>I might have taken this discovery as a thunder-clap, but such
hyperbole would have been premature; discovery was destined to rise
more than one degree, ere it reached its climax.</p>

<p>On whose hand could the amiable D&eacute;sir&eacute;e swing thus selfishly, whose
glove could she tear thus recklessly, whose arm thus strain with
impunity, or on the borders of whose dress thus turn and trample
insolently, if not the hand, glove, arm, and robe of her lady-mother?
And there, in an Indian shawl and a pale-green crape bonnet - there,
fresh, portly, blithe, and pleasant - there stood Madame Beck.</p>

<p>Curious! I had certainly deemed Madame in her bed, and D&eacute;sir&eacute;e in her
crib, at this blessed minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the
just, within the sacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the
Rue Fossette. Most certainly also they did not picture &quot;Meess Lucie&quot;
otherwise engaged; and here we all three were taking our &quot;&eacute;bats&quot; in
the f&ecirc;te-blazing park at midnight!</p>

<p>The fact was, Madame was only acting according to her quite
justifiable wont. I remembered now I had heard it said among the
teachers - though without at the time particularly noticing the gossip
 - that often, when we thought Madame in her chamber, sleeping, she
was gone, full-dressed, to take her pleasure at operas, or plays, or
balls. Madame had no sort of taste for a monastic life, and took care
 - largely, though discreetly - to season her existence with a relish of
the world.</p>

<p>Half a dozen gentlemen of her friends stood about her. Amongst these,
I was not slow to recognise two or three. There was her brother, M.
Victor Kint; there was another person, moustached and with long hair - 
a calm, taciturn man, but whose traits bore a stamp and a semblance I
could not mark unmoved. Amidst reserve and phlegm, amidst contrasts of
character and of countenance, something there still was which recalled
a face - mobile, fervent, feeling - a face changeable, now clouded, and
now alight - a face from my world taken away, for my eyes lost, but
where my best spring-hours of life had alternated in shadow and in
glow; that face, where I had often seen movements so near the signs of
genius - that why there did not shine fully out the undoubted fire, the
thing, the spirit, and the secret itself - I could never tell. Yes - 
this Josef Emanuel - this man of peace - reminded me of his ardent
brother.</p>

<p>Besides Messieurs Victor and Josef, I knew another of this party. This
third person stood behind and in the shade, his attitude too was
stooping, yet his dress and bald white head made him the most
conspicuous figure of the group. He was an ecclesiastic: he was P&egrave;re
Silas. Do not fancy, reader, that there was any inconsistency in the
priest's presence at this f&ecirc;te. This was not considered a show of
Vanity Fair, but a commemoration of patriotic sacrifice. The Church
patronised it, even with ostentation. There were troops of priests in
the park that night.</p>

<p>P&egrave;re Silas stooped over the seat with its single occupant, the rustic
bench and that which sat upon it: a strange mass it was - bearing no
shape, yet magnificent. You saw, indeed, the outline of a face, and
features, but these were so cadaverous and so strangely placed, you
could almost have fancied a head severed from its trunk, and flung at
random on a pile of rich merchandise. The distant lamp-rays glanced on
clear pendants, on broad rings; neither the chasteness of moonlight,
nor the distance of the torches, could quite subdue the gorgeous dyes
of the drapery. Hail, Madame Walravens! I think you looked more witch-
like than ever. And presently the good lady proved that she was indeed
no corpse or ghost, but a harsh and hardy old woman; for, upon some
aggravation in the clamorous petition of D&eacute;sir&eacute;e Beck to her mother,
to go to the kiosk and take sweetmeats, the hunchback suddenly fetched
her a resounding rap with her gold-knobbed cane.</p>

<p>There, then, were Madame Walravens, Madame Beck, P&egrave;re Silas - the whole
conjuration, the secret junta. The sight of them thus assembled did me
good. I cannot say that I felt weak before them, or abashed, or
dismayed. They outnumbered me, and I was worsted and under their feet;
but, as yet, I was not dead.</p>
