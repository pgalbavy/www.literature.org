<p>Penrod went home in splendour, pretending that he and Duke were
a long procession; and he made enough noise to render the auricular
part of the illusion perfect. His own family were already at the
lunch-table when he arrived, and the parade halted only at the
door of the dining-room.</p>

<p>"Oh <em>SOMETHING!" </em>shouted Mr. Schofield, clasping his
bilious brow with both hands. "Stop that noise! Isn't it awful
enough for you to <em>SING? </em>Sit <em>DOWN! </em>Not with that
thing on! Take that green rope off your shoulder! Now take that
thing out of the dining-room and throw it in the ash-can! Where
did you get it?"</p>

<p>"Where did I get what, papa?" asked Penrod meekly, depositing
the accordion in the hall just outside the dining-room door.</p>

<p>"That da&mdash;that third-hand concertina."</p>

<p>"It's a 'cordian," said Penrod, taking his place at the table,
and noticing that both Margaret and Mr. Robert Williams (who happened
to be a guest) were growing red.</p>

<p>"I don't care what you call it," said Mr. Schofield irritably.
"I want to know where you got it."</p>

<p>Penrod's eyes met Margaret's: hers had a strained expression.</p>

<p>She very slightly shook her head. Penrod sent Mr. Williams a
grateful look, and might have been startled if he could have seen
himself in a mirror at that moment; for he regarded Mitchy-Mitch
with concealed but vigorous aversion and the resemblance would
have horrified him.</p>

<p>"A man gave it to me," he answered gently, and was rewarded by
the visibly regained ease of his patron's manner, while Margaret
leaned back in her chair and looked at her brother with real devotion.</p>

<p>"I should think he'd have been glad to," said Mr. Schofield.
"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Sir?" In spite of the candy which he had consumed in company
with Marjorie and Mitchy-Mitch, Penrod had begun to eat lobster
croquettes earnestly.</p>

<p>"Who <em>WAS </em>he?"</p>

<p>"Who do you mean, papa?"</p>

<p>"The man that gave you that ghastly Thing!"</p>

<p>"Yessir. A man gave it to me."</p>

<p>"I say, Who <em>WAS </em>he?" shouted Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>"Well, I was just walking along, and the man came up to me&mdash;it
was right down in front of Colgate's, where most of the paint's
rubbed off the fence&#11834;"</p>

<p>"Penrod!" The father used his most dangerous tone.</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"Who was the man that gave you the concertina?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I was walking along&#11834;"</p>

<p>"You never saw him before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I was just walk&#11834;"</p>

<p>"That will do," said Mr. Schofield, rising. "I suppose every
family has its secret enemies and this was one of ours. I must
ask to be excused!"</p>

<p>With that, he went out crossly, stopping in the hall a moment
before passing beyond hearing. And, after lunch, Penrod sought
in vain for his accordion; he even searched the library where
his father sat reading, though, upon inquiry, Penrod explained
that he was looking for a misplaced schoolbook. He thought he
ought to study a little every day, he said, even during vacation-time.
Much pleased, Mr. Schofield rose and joined the search, finding
the missing work on mathematics with singular ease&mdash;which cost
him precisely the price of the book the following September.</p>

<p>Penrod departed to study in the backyard. There, after a cautious
survey of the neighbourhood, he managed to dislodge the iron cover
of the cistern, and dropped the arithmetic within. A fine splash
rewarded his listening ear. Thus assured that when he looked for
that book again no one would find it for him, he replaced the
cover, and betook himself pensively to the highway, discouraging
Duke from following by repeated volleys of stones, some imaginary
and others all too real.</p>

<p>Distant strains of brazen horns and the throbbing of drums were
borne to him upon the kind breeze, reminding him that the world
was made for joy, and that the Barzee and Potter Dog and Pony
Show was exhibiting in a banlieue not far away. So, thither he
bent his steps&mdash;the plentiful funds in his pocket burning hot
holes all the way. He had paid twenty-two cents for the accordion,
and fifteen for candy; he had bought the mercenary heart of Mitchy-Mitch
for two: it certainly follows that there remained to him of his
dollar, sixty-one cents&mdash;a fair fortune, and most unusual.</p>

<p>Arrived upon the populous and festive scene of the Dog and Pony
Show, he first turned his attention to the brightly decorated
booths which surrounded the tent. The cries of the peanut vendors,
of the popcorn men, of the toy-balloon sellers, the stirring music
of the band, playing before the performance to attract a crowd,
the shouting of excited children and the barking of the dogs within
the tent, all sounded exhilaratingly in Penrod's ears and set
his blood a-tingle. Nevertheless, he did not squander his money
or fling it to the winds in one grand splurge. Instead, he began
cautiously with the purchase of an extraordinarily large pickle,
which he obtained from an aged negress for his odd cent, too obvious
a bargain to be missed. At an adjacent stand he bought a glass
of raspberry lemonade (so alleged) and sipped it as he ate the
pickle. He left nothing of either.</p>

<p>Next, he entered a small restaurant-tent and for a modest nickel
was supplied with a fork and a box of sardines, previously opened,
it is true, but more than half full. He consumed the sardines
utterly, but left the tin box and the fork, after which he indulged
in an inexpensive half-pint of lukewarm cider, at one of the open
booths. Mug in hand, a gentle glow radiating toward his surface
from various centres of activity deep inside him, he paused for
breath&mdash;and the cool, sweet cadences of the watermelon man fell
delectably upon his ear:</p>

<p>"Ice-cole <em>WATER-</em>melon; ice-cole water-<em>MELON; </em>the
biggest slice of <em>ICE-</em>cole, ripe, red, <em>ICE-</em>cole,
rich an' rare; the biggest slice of ice-cole watermelon ever cut
by the hand of man! <em>BUY </em>our <em>ICE-</em>cole water-melon?"</p>

<p>Penrod, having drained the last drop of cider, complied with
the watermelon man's luscious entreaty, and received a round slice
of the fruit, magnificent in circumference and something over
an inch in thickness. Leaving only the really dangerous part of
the rind behind him, he wandered away from the vicinity of the
watermelon man and supplied himself with a bag of peanuts, which,
with the expenditure of a dime for admission, left a quarter still
warm in his pocket. However, he managed to "break" the coin at
a stand inside the tent, where a large, oblong paper box of popcorn
was handed him, with twenty cents change. The box was too large
to go into his pocket, but, having seated himself among some wistful
Polack children, he placed it in his lap and devoured the contents
at leisure during the performance. The popcorn was heavily larded
with partially boiled molasses, and Penrod sandwiched mouthfuls
of peanuts with gobs of this mass until the peanuts were all gone.
After that, he ate with less avidity; a sense almost of satiety
beginning to manifest itself to him, and it was not until the
close of the performance that he disposed of the last morsel.</p>

<p>He descended a little heavily to the outflowing crowd in the
arena, and bought a caterwauling toy balloon, but showed no great
enthusiasm in manipulating it. Near the exit, as he came out,
was a hot-waffle stand which he had overlooked, and a sense of
duty obliged him to consume the three waffles, thickly powdered
with sugar, which the waffle man cooked for him upon command.</p>

<p>They left a hottish taste in his mouth; they had not been quite
up to his anticipation, indeed, and it was with a sense of relief
that he turned to the "hokey-pokey" cart which stood close at
hand, laden with square slabs of "Neapolitan ice-cream" wrapped
in paper. He thought the ice-cream would be cooling, but somehow
it fell short of the desired effect, and left a peculiar savour
in his throat.</p>

<p>He walked away, too languid to blow his balloon, and passed a
fresh-taffy booth with strange indifference. A bare-armed man
was manipulating the taffy over a hook, pulling a great white
mass to the desired stage of "candying," but Penrod did not pause
to watch the operation; in fact, he averted his eyes (which were
slightly glazed) in passing. He did not analyze his motives: simply,
he was conscious that he preferred not to look at the mass of
taffy.</p>

<p>For some reason, he put a considerable distance between himself
and the taffy-stand, but before long halted in the presence of
a red-faced man who flourished a long fork over a small cooking
apparatus and shouted jovially: "Winnies! <em>HERE'S </em>your
hot winnies! Hot winny-<em>WURST! </em>Food for the over-worked
brain, nourishing for the weak stummick, entertaining for the
tired business man! <em>HERE'S </em>your hot winnies, three for
a nickel, a half-a-dime, the twentieth-pot-of-a-dollah!"</p>

<p>This, above all nectar and ambrosia, was the favourite dish of
Penrod Schofield. Nothing inside him now craved it&mdash;on the contrary!
But memory is the great hypnotist; his mind argued against his
inwards that opportunity knocked at his door: "winny-wurst" was
rigidly forbidden by the home authorities. Besides, there was
a last nickel in his pocket; and nature protested against its
survival. Also, the redfaced man had himself proclaimed his wares
nourishing for the weak stummick.</p>

<p>Penrod placed the nickel in the red hand of the red-faced man.</p>

<p>He ate two of the three greasy, cigarlike shapes cordially pressed
upon him in return. The first bite convinced him that he had made
a mistake; these winnies seemed of a very inferior flavour, almost
unpleasant, in fact. But he felt obliged to conceal his poor opinion
of them, for fear of offending the red-faced man. He ate without
haste or eagerness&mdash;so slowly, indeed, that he began to think
the redfaced man might dislike him, as a deterrent of trade. Perhaps
Penrod's mind was not working well, for he failed to remember
that no law compelled him to remain under the eye of the red-faced
man, but the virulent repulsion excited by his attempt to take
a bite of the third sausage inspired him with at least an excuse
for postponement.</p>

<p>"Mighty good," he murmured feebly, placing the sausage in the
pocket of his jacket with a shaking hand. "Guess I'll save this
one to eat at home, after&mdash;after dinner."</p>

<p>He moved sluggishly away, wishing he had not thought of dinner.
A side-show, undiscovered until now, failed to arouse his interest,
not even exciting a wish that he had known of its existence when
he had money. For a time he stared without attraction; the weather-worn
colours conveying no meaning to comprehension at a huge canvas
poster depicting the chief his torpid eye. Then, little by little,
the poster became more vivid to his consciousness. There was a
greenish-tinted person in the tent, it seemed, who thrived upon
a reptilian diet.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Penrod decided that it was time to go home.</p>
